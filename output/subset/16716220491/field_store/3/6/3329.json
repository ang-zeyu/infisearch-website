There's nothing in the fortification line for miles.  No, it's not that.  But _cave_, here he comes.\"  The lads crouched behind the crumbling parapet, and by means of conveniently placed gaps in the masonry watched the stranger's approach.  There was nothing about the man's appearance to suggest that he was anything but an ordinary holiday-maker.  He was slightly above average height, rather heavily built, and inclined to flabbiness.  His complexion was undoubtedly florid, although his face and hands were tanned a deep brown.  He was dressed in a light-grey lounge suit, with a straw hat and brown shoes, while in his right hand he carried a thick Malacca cane.  The exertion of climbing up the hill on which the ruined chapel stood apparently told upon him, for he was considerably out of breath when he passed under the ivy-clad arch.  Here he stopped to wipe his face with a handkerchief, and while doing so dropped his cane.  It fell upon the stones with a dull thud.  At the same time the stranger gave vent to an exclamation that certainly was not English.  The lads exchanged glances.  Here was the beginning of a mystery.  The heaviest Malacca cane would not have made that dull metallic sound in falling, while it was evident by the careful examination the stranger made of the retrieved article that he was more than considerate for its appearance.  The man made no attempt to explore the ruins.  The weather-worn fane had no attractions for him.  It was apparently only a rendezvous, as far as he was concerned, for at frequent intervals he would walk stealthily through the archway, and look attentively down the hill leading to the coves on the side facing the mainland.  It had now begun to rain--big drops that were the precursors of a heavy shower.  The lads, in their exposed position on the tower, paid scant heed.  Their interest and attention were centred upon the anxiously awaiting stranger fifty feet beneath them.  Presently Ross happened to glance towards the stretch of water that separated St. Mena's Island from the mainland.  A boat was approaching. Already it was more than half-way across.  It was a rowing-boat, containing only one person.  What object would anyone have in rowing across on a wet afternoon like this? wondered the lad.  Just then the stranger began rubbing his hands with ill-concealed satisfaction.  Although he had been frequently on the look-out, he had evidently only just caught sight of the approaching boat.  The lads watched the little craft till it was hidden by the intervening high ground, but already Ross felt certain that it was making for Main Beach Cove.  There were three landing-places on St. Mena's Island--Half Tide Cove, where the lads had left their stranded boat; Main Beach Cove, a little to the north-east; and Deadman's Cove, farther away.  Of these, only Main Beach was available between one hour on either side of low water. The fact that the boat was making for it, and had already successfully skirted the submerged reef lying off it, proved that its occupant had local knowledge.  Some considerable time elapsed between the temporary disappearance of the boat and the appearance of the new-comer; but at length he came into view, walking rapidly up the steep incline without showing anything of the physical strain that the first stranger had betrayed.  Suddenly Ross Trefusis recognized the man.  He almost felt inclined to laugh at his suspicions.  It was Dr. Ramblethorne, the medical practitioner at St. Bedal--a town of considerable importance about seven miles from Killigwent Hall.  The doctor was a frequent guest of Admiral Trefusis, and was generally considered a good, all-round sportsman.  He was about thirty years of age, over six feet in height, of sinewy frame and of great muscular power.  He was the wildest motorist in that part of Cornwall, as the endorsements on his driver's licence testified.  A keen golfer, good shot, and fisherman, he was also a botanist; and that, perhaps, thought Ross, might account for his presence on St. Mena's Island, although it was difficult to reconcile the fact that Ramblethorne had an appointment with a stranger at this desolate spot.  If a joint botanic expedition had been fixed up, why had not the two men met on the mainland?  The unknown made no attempt to advance to meet the doctor.  Instead, he remained within the ruins until Ramblethorne entered.  Their greeting was a surprise even to the lads, for the doctor, holding out his hand, exclaimed in German:  \"Well met, von Ruhle!  Let us hope that your arrangements will prove satisfactory.\"     CHAPTER II  The Tables Turned  Both Ross Trefusis and Vernon Haye understood and could speak German. Ross was especially good in his knowledge of the language of the modern Hun, for in his early youth he had been inflicted with a German governess.  Since German is one of the subjects for Sandhurst--for which both lads were preparing--their knowledge had been considerably improved under the cast-iron rule of a native professor.  \"Eminently satisfactory,\" replied von Ruhle.  \"We will go into details later.  You had no difficulty in coming here, I hope?\"  \"None whatever.\"  \"No suspicions?\" asked von Ruhle anxiously.  Ramblethorne smiled.  \"My dear von Ruhle,\" he replied.  \"A medical practitioner is above suspicion.  He is free to go anywhere at any hour of the day or night without question.  No man would suspect----\"  \"You are clever, von Hauptwald----\"  \"Ssh!\" interrupted the doctor.  \"Call me Ramblethorne, if you please. Of course there is no danger here, but at other times and in other places you might incautiously give the show away.  You had a good passage?\"  \"Excellent,\" replied von Ruhle.  \"I am getting well-known to the strafed English custom-house officers at Queenboro' and Harwich.  They recognize me by my stick, I believe, but they little know that it is a new one every time.  What do you think of this?  I have brought it as a specimen for you to see.  Just fancy! every time I cross to Holland twenty kilogrammes of good copper are on their way to the Fatherland. By this time Herr Stabb of Essen is well acquainted with my Malacca canes.\"  \"A good weight to carry about,\" remarked Ramblethorne, wielding the disguised bar of copper.  \"I wonder you troubled.\"  \"Mein Gott!  I could not leave it,\" declared von Ruhle.  \"Someone might take a fancy to it, and then the secret would be out.  But tell me: have you succeeded in getting that commission you spoke of?\"  \"I am still living in hopes,\" replied Ramblethorne.  \"Of course I could have obtained a post of temporary surgeon in the British Navy, but it wasn't good enough.  It's no fun running the risk of being torpedoed by our own Submarines.  The English Army offers a wider scope.  Believe me, I am worth more than a division to the Emperor.  I'll get a commission, never you fear, for I have heaps of influence.  Then, of course, I will do my utmost to fight against a terrible epidemic that will mysteriously break out amongst the troops.\"  Ramblethorne, otherwise von Hauptwald, threw back his shoulders and laughed uproariously.  \"Careful!\" hissed his companion.  \"You will be heard over the whole island.\"  \"What matters?  There is not another soul in sight besides ourselves. How much petrol have you?\"  \"Fifty two-gallon tins.  I expect some more by boat to-morrow.  It's safely stored in a cave on the side of the creek.  It is a nuisance it is raining.  I do not fancy a night's work in weather like this. Himmel, what's that?\"  Accidentally Vernon's foot had dislodged a small piece of stone.  \"Nerves, my dear von Ruhle,\" said Ramblethorne, with his usual good-natured smile.  \"A bit of masonry has fallen from the tower.  See, the floor is covered with similar pieces.\"  \"If anyone should be up there----\" suggested von Ruhle, pointing to the top of the tower.  The lads could feel their hearts thumping against their ribs.  Through a small crack in the planking they could see the eyes of the two Germans directed upwards.  \"Impossible; there are no steps,\" declared Ramblethorne.  \"Besides, what object would anyone have in ascending a tower on a day like this? I fully appreciate the danger of being overheard, of course.  We've said enough to find ourselves faced by a firing-party in the Tower of London, my friend.\"  \"Don't!\" expostulated von Ruhle, closing his eyes as if to shut out the unpleasant mental vision.  Then: \"You have the signalling apparatus, I hope?\"  \"Trust me for that, von Ruhle,\" replied his companion, tapping his breast-pocket.  \"All we have to do is to wait until yonder lighthouse exposes its light.  Really the ways of these English pass understanding.  They rigorously forbid the showing of lights in private houses on shore, imagining that our agents would be so foolish as to start blinking with a lamp; yet they allow these lighthouses to work as usual, and obligingly enable us to communicate to our hearts' content.\"  Von Hauptwald was not far wrong in his remarks, for the instrument he had enabled him to flash a message to a confederate without having to be in possession of a lamp.  The flash was obtained from any distant and visible light by means of a complicated system of mirrors.  The reflected rays could then be projected in any desired direction so as to be quite invisible except on a certain bearing.  It was one of the carefully-thought-out plans adopted by the German Government to permit its spies to communicate with their submarines without running any great risk of detection.  \"It's two hours to sunset,\" remarked the doctor; \"three before we commence operations.  I would suggest that we adjourn to the cave and partake of refreshment.  You see, I have not omitted to make suitable provision.\"  \"Very good!\" agreed von Ruhle; \"but I only wish I had a waterproof. The rain is most annoying.\"  Arm-in-arm the two men left the building, and presently disappeared from view behind a slight rise in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26641"],["title","The Submarine Hunters: A Story of the Naval Patrol Work in the Great War (#2)"],["body","ground.  \"I say!\" exclaimed Ross; \"we've tumbled on something this time.  Fancy Ramblethorne a rotten German spy.  I always thought he was a rattling good chap.\"  \"Evidently he isn't,\" rejoined Vernon.  \"But the point is: what do you propose to do?  It's beastly wet here.\"  \"It is, now I come to think of it,\" agreed his chum.  \"The fact is, that until you mentioned it I was hardly aware that it was raining. We'll discuss this knotty point.\"  \"I vote we make tracks for the boat,\" suggested Haye.  \"The tide must be rising by this time.  We can then slip off and raise the alarm.\"  Ross shook his head.  \"No go,\" he decided.  \"We might get nabbed ourselves.  Besides, who would be able to lay these chaps by the heels?  There's only that motor-boat chap at Penydwick Cove, and he's precious little use.  There are no soldiers nearer than at St. Bedal.  I propose we hang on here. There's a snug, sheltered hole in these ruins, just big enough for us to lie hidden.  Then we stand a good chance of hearing more of the conversation between those beggars.\"  \"Three hours more, remember.\"  \"Yes, I know.  In the meanwhile we might slip down to Main Beach Cove. There's plenty of cover amongst the rocks.\"  \"What for?\" asked Vernon.  \"To see what these fellows are up to.  I'm rather anxious to renew my slight acquaintance with friend Copperstick.  By Jove, what a cute move to get contraband metal into Germany!\"  \"Not much at a time.  It shows how hard up the Germans must be for copper when it pays a fellow to carry over about half a hundredweight at a time.\"  \"Well, let's get a move on,\" said Ross.  \"Be careful how you descend. The ivy will be fairly slippery with the wet.\"  Cautiously the two lads descended, reaching the ground without mishap.  \"Our sweaters!\" exclaimed Vernon.  \"Dash it all!  Yes,\" agreed his companion.  \"I had forgotten all about them.\"  The sweaters, carefully rolled up, had been placed for security in one corner of the chapel.  Unless anyone actually came close to the spot, they were hidden from sight.  \"Neither of those fellows stood about here, I think,\" remarked Ross as the chums retrieved and donned the additional clothing.  \"It's jolly lucky, or they would have smelt a rat.\"  Trefusis and his companion went out into the rain, walking rapidly towards a slight mound capped by a few irregularly shaped stones.  It was behind this rise of ground that the two spies had gone.  Up to this point, Ross argued, there was little need for caution; beyond, it would be necessary to keep well under cover until they reached Main Beach.  \"'Ware the skyline,\" cautioned Ross as the chums approached the hillock.  \"Ay; 'ware the skyline,\" said a deep voice mockingly, \"It's bad strategy.\"  Turning, the lads made the disconcerting discovery that Ramblethorne and von Ruhle were within five yards of their would-be trackers.  Ross realized that he and his chum had been badly outmanoeuvred. Evidently the Germans suspected that they had been overheard, and ostentatiously leaving the ruins for Main Beach Cove, they had made a detour from the hillock, and had waited until Ross and Vernon had emerged from the chapel.  Then, taking advantage of the wet grass that effectually deadened the sound of their footsteps, they had turned the tables on their shadowers.  So completely taken aback were the two lads that they stood stock-still as if rooted to the earth.  \"Not a nice evening to be out, Trefusis,\" continued the doctor.  \"What brings you on St. Mena's Island at this late hour of the day?\"  \"Our boat was left high and dry by the tide, so we had to wait and take shelter,\" replied Ross.  \"And so you chose a place where there was no shelter,\" remarked Ramblethorne.  \"Idiotic thing to do--very idiotic.  Now tell me: what were you doing on the top of the tower?\"  Ross did not hesitate in his reply.  Perhaps it would have been better had he done so, for he had never betrayed his knowledge of German to the doctor on any of their previous meetings, and it would have been judicious to keep up the deception.  \"What were we doing?  Listening to your precious schemes,\" he retorted boldly.  \"Now we know all about you, and it will be our duty to report you as spies to the authorities.  We are expecting a search-party from Killigwent Hall at any moment, you see.\"  \"So that's the line of defence you propose to adopt, eh?\" sneered Ramblethorne.  \"Well, look out!\"  With a sudden spring the athletic man flung himself upon Ross, while von Ruhle with equal promptitude made a rush to secure Vernon.  Strong and active though he was, Ross was no match for his huge and powerful antagonist.  Knowing that flight was impossible, the lad feinted, and aimed a blow with his left straight for the doctor's chin. This Ramblethorne parried easily, and grasping the lad's wrist, held it as in a vice, and in such a manner that rendered fruitless any attempt on Trefusis' part to make use of his right arm.  Having thus secured his opponent, Ramblethorne watched the result of the encounter between his fellow-spy and young Haye.  Von Ruhle had opened the attack by brandishing his heavy stick, and calling upon Vernon to surrender.  Haye returned the compliment by closing, and dealing the German such a terrific blow upon the chest that von Ruhle recoiled quite a couple of yards.  The lad's onslaught had only missed the German's solar plexus by a few inches; had it not, the chances were that von Ruhle would have lost all interest in life for the next quarter of an hour.  But instead of following up his initial success Vernon, seeing Ross helpless in the doctor's grip, rushed to his chum's aid.  For a few seconds he feinted, striving to find an opening, while Ramblethorne, dragging his captive with him, pivoted in order to keep his front towards his new antagonist.  Those few seconds were Vernon's undoing.  Quickly recovering himself, von Ruhle sprang forward with the agility of a panther.  The imitation Malacca cane descended with a dull thud upon the lad's head, and like a felled ox Vernon fell inertly upon the sodden grass.  \"Hold him--so,\" exclaimed Ramblethorne, handing Ross over to the custody of von Ruhle.  Then drawing a small hypodermic syringe from a case, the former inserted the needle into the lad's forearm.  Five seconds later Ross Trefusis lay unconscious beside his companion in misfortune.     CHAPTER III  Kidnapped  \"I thought you had killed him, von Ruhle,\" said the doctor, bending over Vernon and making a cursory examination of the unconscious lad.  \"I thought I had,\" was the unconcerned reply.  \"Dead men tell no tales.\"  \"There I beg to differ,\" protested Ramblethorne.  \"Corpses have a nasty way of turning up at inopportune moments.  These youngsters are worth more to us alive than dead.\"  \"How so?\"  \"One is a son of Admiral Trefusis; his companion is, I believe, also a son of a distinguished English naval officer.\"  \"Well, and what of it?\" asked von Ruhle.  \"Hostages,\" replied the doctor briefly.  \"Later I will explain. Meanwhile we'll carry them to the cave.  It's farther than back to the ruins; but perhaps, as young Trefusis said, there may be a search-party, and the ruins would be one of the first objects of investigation.\"  Although, with the exception of periodical visits abroad, Dr. Ramblethorne had lived in England all his life and was a fully qualified medical man, he was a highly trusted and talented agent of the German Secret Service.  Months before the outbreak of war, he had been ordered to report upon the defences of Devonport, and in order to do this he had bought a practice on the outskirts of Plymouth.  Upon the commencement of hostilities, he was detailed to keep under observation the military preparations of the Duchy of Cornwall, and also to take necessary steps for communicating with German submarines that, under von Tirpitz's prearranged scheme, were to operate in the Bristol Channel.  Von Ruhle was one of the few subordinates he actually knew.  There were others with whom he communicated only through an intermediary, and who knew him only by a number.  Von Ruhle was almost as mentally clever as his superior. Ostentatiously he was an Englishman.  Sometimes he posed as a mining engineer; at others as a commercial traveller; as an accredited representative of the British Red Cross Society he was in the habit of making frequent journeys to Holland, presumably in connection with work at Groningen Internment Camp.  At the present time, his activities were centred upon the formation of a secret petrol depot for the supply of fuel to unterseebooten operating in the Bristol Channel and off the south coast of Ireland.  A couple of slight incidents had served to put the cautious Ramblethorne on his guard during his interview with von Ruhle in the ruined chapel.  Although he verbally deprecated his subordinate's alarm when the lads accidentally dislodged a stone from the tower, it was merely to disarm possible eavesdroppers of any suspicion that their presence was suspected.  The ability to control his feelings was one of the super-spy's chief assets.  Suspicion once aroused, he proceeded without the faintest sign to investigate his surroundings.  His keen eye soon lighted upon the lads' sweaters.  Then it was that an adjournment was suggested to Main Beach Cove.  This was simply and solely a \"blind\", for on gaining the cover of the boulder-strewn hillock the doctor communicated his suspicions to his companion.  The pair then crouched behind the rocks, whence they were able to command a view of the tower.  It was not long before their enterprise met with success.  They saw Trefusis and his chum cautiously descend by means of the ivy; then, directly the lads set out upon their ill-starred tracking expedition, the Germans, as before related, succeeded in outflanking them and effecting their capture.  \"Time!\" announced Ramblethorne, consulting his watch.  \"Are these safe?\" asked von Ruhle, stirring Vernon's unconscious form with his foot.  \"Quite;"]]]
