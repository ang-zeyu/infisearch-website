In the home, the little sheltered, love-guarded home of the farmer, the mechanic and the artizen (makin' special mention of the buzz sawyers). And also in the palace walls and the throne. There and every _where_ men would fain shelter wimmen from every care, and every labor, even the lightest and slightest.  Then lastly came the _howsumever_. He proceeded to show _how_ this could be done. And he proved it right out (or thought he did) that the first great requisit' to accomplish all this, wuz to keep wimmen in her place. Keep her from settin' on the Conference, and all other tottlin' eminences, fitted only for man's stalwart strength.  And the end of the article wuz so sort of tragick and skairful that Josiah wept when he read it. He pictured it out in such strong colors, the danger there wuz of puttin' wimmen, or allowin' her to put herself in such a high and percipitous place, such a skairful and dangerous posture as settin' up on a Conference.  [Illustration: “JOSIAH WEPT WHEN HE READ IT.”]  “To have her set up on it,” sez the writer, in conclusion, “would endanger her life, her spiritual, her mental and her moral growth. It would shake the permanency of the sacred home relations to its downfall. It would hasten anarchy, and he thought sizm.”  Why, Josiah Allen handled that paper as if it wuz pure gold. I know he asked me anxiously as he handed it to me to read, “if my hands wuz perfectly clean,” and we had some words about it.  And till he could pass it on to Deacon Sypher to read he kep it in the Bible. He put it right over in Galatians, for I looked to see--Second Galatians.  And he wrapped it up in a soft handkerchief when he carried it over to Deacon Sypherses. And Deacon Sypher treasured it like a pearl of great price (so I spoze) till he could pass it on to Deacon Henzy.  And Deacon Henzy was to carry it with care to a old male Deacon in Zoar, bed rid.  Wall, as I say, that is the very first I had read about their bein' any idee promulgated of wimmens settin' up on the Conference.  And I, in spite of Josiah Allen's excitement, wuz in favor on't from the very first.  Yes, I wuz awfully in favor of it, and all I went through durin' the next and ensuin' weeks didn't put the idee out of my head. No, far from it. It seemed as if the severer my sufferin's wuz, the much more this idee flourished in my soul. Just as a heavy plow will meller up the soil so white lilies can take root, or any other kind of sweet posies.  And oh! my heart! wuz not my sufferin's with Lodema Trumble, a hard plow and a harrowin' one, and one that turned up deep furrows?  But of this, more anon and bimeby.     CHAPTER II.   Wall, it wuz on the very next day--on a Thursday as I remember well, for I wuz a-thinkin' why didn't Lodema's letter come the next day--Fridays bein' considered onlucky--and it being a day for punishments, hangin's, and so forth.  But it didn't, it came on a Thursday. And my companion had been to Jonesville and brung me back two letters; he brung 'em in, leavin' the old mair standin' at the gate, and handed me the letters, ten pounds of granulated sugar, a pound of tea, and the request I should have supper on the table by the time that he got back from Deacon Henzy's.  (On that old buzz-saw business agin, so I spozed, but wouldn't ask.)  Wall, I told him supper wuz begun any way, and he had better hurry back. But he wuz belated by reason of Deacon Henzy's bein' away, so I set there for some time alone.  Wall, I wuz goin' to have some scolloped oysters for supper, so the first thing I did wuz to put 'em into the oven--they wuz all ready, I had scolloped 'em before Josiah come, and got 'em all ready for the oven--and then I set down and read my letters.  Wall, the first one I opened wuz from Lodema Trumble, Josiah's cousin on his own side. And her letter brought the sad and harrowin' intelligence that she was a-comin' to make us a good long visit. The letter had been delayed. She was a-comin' that very night, or the next day. Wall, I sithed deep. I love company dearly, but--oh my soul, is there not a difference, a difference in visitors?  Wall, suffice it to say, I sithed deep, and opened the other letter, thinkin' it would kind o' take my mind off.  And for all the world! I couldn't hardly believe my eyes. But it wuz! It wuz from Serena Fogg. It wuz from the Authoress of “Wedlock's Peaceful Repose.”  I hadn't heard a word from her for upwards of four years. And the letter brung me startlin' intelligence.  It opened with the unexpected information that she wuz married. She had been married three years and a half to a butcher out to the Ohio.  And I declare my first thought wuz as I read it, “Wall, she has wrote dretful flowery on wedlock, and its perfect, onbroken calm, and peaceful repose, and now she has had a realizin' sense of what it really is.”  But when I read a little further, I see what the letter wuz writ for. I see why, at this late day, she had started up and writ me a letter. I see it wuz writ on duty.  She said she had found out that I wuz in the right on't and she wuzn't. She said that when in the past she had disputed me right up and down, and insisted that wedlock wuz a state of perfect serenity, never broken in upon by any cares or vexations whatsomever, she wuz in the wrong on't.  She said she had insisted that when anybody had moored their barks into that haven of wedded life, that they wuz forever safe from any rude buffetin's from the world's waves; that they wuz exempt from any toil, any danger, any sorrow, any trials whatsomever. And she had found she was mistook.  She said I told her it wuz a first-rate state, and a satisfactory one for wimmen; but still it had its trials, and she had found it so. She said that I insisted its serenity wuz sometimes broken in upon, and she had found it so. The last day at my house had tottled her faith, and her own married experience had finished the work. Her husband wuz a worthy man, and she almost worshipped him. But he had a temper, and he raved round considerable when meals wuzn't ready on time, and she havin' had two pairs of twins durin' her union (she comes from a family on her mother's side, so I had hearn before, where twins wuz contagious), she couldn't always be on the exact minute. She had to work awful hard; this broke in on her serenity.  Her husband devotedly loved her, so she said; but still, she said, his bootjack had been throwed voyalent where corns wuz hit onexpected.  [Illustration: “FOUR TWINS BROKE IN ALSO ON HER WAVELESS CALM.”]  Their souls wuz mated firm as they could be in deathless ties of affection and confidence, yet doors _had_ been slammed and oaths emitted, when clothin' rent and buttons tarried not with him. Strange actions and demeanors had been displayed in hours of high-headedness and impatience, which had skaired her almost to death before gettin' accustomed to 'em.  The four twins broke in also on her waveless calm. They wuz lovely cherubs, and the four apples of her eyes. But they did yell at times, they kicked, they tore round and acted; they made work--lots of work. And one out of each pair snored. It broke up each span, as you may say. The snorin' filled each room devoted to 'em.  _He_ snored, loud. A good man and a noble man he wuz, so she repeated it, but she found out too late--too late, that he snored. The house wuz small; she could _not_ escape from snores, turn she where she would. She got tired out with her work days, and couldn't rest nights. Her husband, as he wuz doin' such a flourishin' business, had opened a cattle-yard near the house. She wuz proud of his growin' trade, but the bellerin' of the cattle disturbed her fearfully. Also the calves bleating and the lambs callin' on their dams.  It wuz a long letter, filled with words like these, and it ended up by saying that for years now she had wanted to write and tell me that I had been in the right on't and she in the wrong. I had been megum and she hadn't. And she ended by sayin', “God bless me and adoo.”  [Illustration: THE LECTURE.]  The fire crackled softly on the clean hearth. The teakettle sung a song of welcome and cheer. The oysters sent out an agreeable atmosphere. The snowy table, set out in pretty china and glassware, looked invitin', and I set there comfortable and happy and so peaceful in my frame, that the events of the past, in which Serena Fogg had flourished, seemed but as yesterday.  I thought it all over, that pleasant evenin' in the past, when Josiah Allen had come in unexpected, and brung the intelligence to me that there wuz goin' to be a lectur' give that evenin' by a young female at the Jonesville school-house, and beset me to go.  And I give my consent. Then my mind travelled down that pleasant road, moongilded, to the school-house. It stopped on the door-step while Josiah hitched the mair.  We found the school-house crowded full, fur a female lecturer wuz a rarity, and she wuz a pretty girl, as pretty a girl as I ever see in my life.  And it wuz a pretty lecture, too, dretful pretty. The name of the lecture wuz, “Wedlock's Peaceful and Perfect Repose.”  A pretty name, I think, and it wuz a beautiful lecture, very, and extremely flowery. It affected some of the hearers awfully; they wuz all carried away with it. Josiah Allen wept like a child durin' the rehearsin' of it. I myself didn't weep, but I enjoyed it, some of it, first rate.  I can't begin to tell it all as she did, 'specially after this length of time, in such a lovely, flowery way, but I can probably give a few of the heads of it.  It hain't no ways likely that I can give the heads half the stylish, eloquent look that she did as she held 'em up, but I can jest give the bare heads.  She said that there had been a effort made in some directions to try to speak against the holy state of matrimony. The papers had been full of the subject, “Is Marriage a Failure, or is it not?”  She had even read these dreadful words--“Marriage is a Failure.” She"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9456"],["title","Opera Stories from Wagner (#1)"],["body","yment.\"  \"What payment do you want?\" asked Wotan.  \"What payment do I want?\" shouted Fafner. \"Surely you have not forgotten your promise? The price was Freya, and I shall take her home with me.\"  \"Oh, that was only in jest,\" said Wotan. \"I could not think of letting Freya go. But I shall pay you well for the castle. I shall give you something else that will be just as good for you.\"  Fafner grew very angry and screamed:--  \"Cease your foolish talk. I built your beautiful stone palace. I drudged and toiled and heaped the massive rocks. Each stone lies firm and solid in its place, and I will have my pay!\"  \"But, surely,\" said Wotan, \"you did not think I meant to give you Freya? 'T is she who feeds us golden apples. No one but Freya knows how to make them grow. If it were not for her fresh fruits my family would grow old. They would wither like the autumn flowers.\"  \"Yes,\" raged Fafner; \"I know it is fair Freya's golden apples that keep you young. But now Freya belongs to me. Nothing else will I have.\"  Just then Wotan saw his brother, Loki, coming over the mountain.  \"Wait, Fafner! Wait until I can talk with my brother about this!\"   LOKI  \"Loki, why are you so late?\" complained Wotan, when Loki came.  Loki was much excited.  \"The Rhine-daughters are in great trouble, Wotan. As I was coming by the river I heard them weeping and wailing. Black Alberich has stolen their gold, and I promised them that I would tell you about it. Perhaps you could help them.\"  \"I have no time for the Rhine-daughters now,\" said Wotan. \"I have trouble of my own. Tell me how I can save poor Freya!\"  For many years Fafner had heard of this lump of gold. So he listened to all that Loki told. Then he asked: \"Why does Alberich want the gold?\"  \"Because,\" replied Loki, \"the gold can be made into a magic ring; if the one who would make the ring will forever give up all love, the magic ring will make its owner master of the whole wide world. Alberich declared that love was nothing to him if he could have all the gold he wanted.\"  To himself Fafner thought: \"Perhaps it would be better for me to have the gold than to have Freya and her golden apples.\" Then aloud he said: \"Let me tell you what I am willing to do, Wotan. If you will get that gold for me, I will accept it in place of Freya.\"  \"You rascal!\" roared Wotan. \"How can I give you gold that is not mine?\"  \"Very well,\" said Fafner. \"I did not come here to quarrel. Already I have waited too long. I shall take my pay. Come, Freya, you must go with me.\"  Poor, frightened Freya wept and cried aloud as Fafner picked her up and carried her off over the mountain.  He called back to Wotan and Loki: \"I will keep Freya until evening. Then I shall come again, and if you have that glittering Rhine-gold for me, then you may have your sister. If you do not give me the gold, then Freya is mine and I will keep her always.\"   YOUTH OR AGE?  As soon as Freya was gone, the flowers began to droop their heads.  Wotan and his family began to grow old and gray.  It seemed to Wotan like some awful dream.  Suddenly Loki cried out: \"We have not eaten Freya's fruit to-day! Now she is gone, we shall all wither and die!\"  Wotan had stood gazing at the ground, trying hard to think what he could do to save himself and his family.  \"Come, Loki,\" he said. \"We must go to the deep dark kingdom of the Nibelungs. I must have the gold! Let us go by way of the brimstone gorge. I cannot go by way of the river. I do not want to hear the wailing of the Rhine-daughters.\"  Wotan called back to his anxious family: \"Only wait till evening and I promise I shall bring your lost youth back to you.\"   NIBELHEIM    \"Far, far below the ground are gloomy depths,--   A mighty cavern, rocky, dark and vast.\"  It was as dark as night down in the kingdom of the Nibelungs, except for the light which flared from the smoking torches, or glowed in the coals upon the anvils.  The family of dwarfs were skilled blacksmiths and metal-workers.  From every little niche and corner came the sound of clinking anvils. Before Alberich stole the gold, the Nibelungs often sang as they worked.  They sometimes made pretty ornaments for their wives to wear or toys for their little children.  But now Alberich had made the ring of gold which bound them to do his will.  He had no love in his heart, so he drove and scolded all the time.  He made them work, work, work, both day and night, and all that they made belonged to him.  So Alberich was daily becoming mightier than ever.   THE BEST SMITH IN NIBELHEIM  Mimi, who was Alberich's brother, was the best smith in all this swarm of black slaves.  Alberich forced Mimi to make for him a strange wishing-cap.  It was made of woven steel.  Mimi had to make it just as Alberich said, but Mimi did not know how it was to be used. When it was finished, Mimi feared it had some wonderful power, and he did not want Alberich to have it.  He wished he might keep it for himself.  He had worked hard to make it.  \"Give me that helmet,\" said Alberich. \"I want you to know, Mimi, that everything in this cave belongs to me!\"  Mimi had to give it up.  Alberich put it on his head. \"Now I shall see what magic there is in this wishing-cap. Come, Night and Darkness!\" he called. \"Make me so no one can see me!\"  In an instant he was gone, and there was only a cloud of smoke where he had stood.  \"Now, Mimi!\" he called, \"look sharp! Can you see me?\"  \"No,\" gasped Mimi. \"I cannot see you at all.\"  The cloud of smoke moved down the gloomy cave and Alberich's cruel voice laughed: \"Ha! ha! Now I shall make you black slaves work! Now you dare not be idle, for when you do not see me I shall be watching you!\"  His voice sank deeper. \"Now I will make you dig, dig, dig, to the very depths of the earth to bring me gold!\"  Mimi was so frightened.  When the cloud of smoke had gone out of sight, he lay down upon the rocks and cried.   THE MASTER  Wotan and Loki swung themselves over the ledge and slid down into the murky cave where Alberich lived.  Wotan looked around and said:--  \"So this is the Kingdom of the Nibelungs! What an awful place it is!\"  From far down the passages came the sound of hundreds of slaves melting and welding precious metals for their master.  \"Loki,\" said Wotan, \"I believe it is always dark and gloomy where there is no love. What is that strange cry I hear?\"  \"Ho, Mimi, is that you?\" said Loki.  \"Leave me alone!\" cried Mimi.  \"Then tell me what you are crying about?\"  \"Oh,\" replied Mimi, \"that wretched Alberich, with his ring of gold, has made us all his slaves! With it he drives us down into the earth to dig more gold. What we get is all his. We slave for him both day and night.  \"This curse of gold has filled our cavern with despair. Lately he made me forge a wishing-cap for him. With it he makes himself so none can see him. Now we slaves can never rest. _Sh! sh!_ He is coming now!\"  Wotan and Loki, peering through the darkness, could see him now and then as he passed under the light of a flaring torch.  He was driving a swarm of bent black slaves who were carrying great packs of gold and silver and precious ore upon their backs.  The helmet was hanging at his waist.  In his hand he was swinging a whip and the giants could hear him yelling:--  \"Pile up the gold! Hurry! Hurry, you lazy rogues!\"   THE BOASTER  Suddenly Alberich saw the giants.  \"Who is this that dares come into my cave?\" he cried. \"Mimi, get back to your work!\"  Then to all the other slaves he called:--  \"Get below, every one of you! Crawl into your dingy shafts and dig the gold! Begone, I say! You must obey the master of the ring!\"  As soon as the black swarm had crept away, Alberich spoke angrily to Wotan and Loki. \"What do you want in here?\"  \"We just came to see you,\" said Wotan. \"We hoped you might be glad to have us. We think you must be a very clever man. We have heard a great deal about the wonderful things you can do.\"  This pleased Alberich. He grew very proud and began to boast.  \"See all this gold of mine!\" he said.  \"Yes,\" answered Loki; \"it is the most gold I have ever seen, but what use is it? It does no one any good in here where nothing useful can be bought with it.\"  \"I am heaping it up,\" said Alberich. \"Some day, with this same treasure, heaped and hid, I hope to work some wonders. You shall see! I shall be master of the whole wide world! Ha! the smoke of Alberich's kingdom shall smudge even your flowery mountain-sides and your sparkling rivers. Everybody shall be my slave! Beware of this black Nibelung, I say, for he shall rule the world!\"   THE WISHING-CAP  Loki was very sly and cunning. While Alberich boasted, he was planning how he might trick the dwarf and take his gold.  To Alberich he said: \"Surely, you will be the mightiest of men. But suppose that while you sleep, one of your slaves should creep upon you and steal your ring?\"  Alberich smiled. \"There is no danger of that,\" he said. \"I will show you a trick or two. Do you see this helmet? It is a magic helmet. With it I can make myself so no one can see me, or I can change myself, quick as a flash, into anything I wish to be. So, you see, I am perfectly safe.\"  \"I never heard of such wonders,\" answered Loki. \"I really cannot believe it.\"  \"I shall prove it to you,\" said the dwarf, never dreaming that the sly Loki was only laying a trap for him. \"What form will you have me take?\"  \"Turn into anything you wish. Only let me see it done and then I shall believe.\"  Alberich put on the helmet. \"Ho! Monster Dragon, come!\" And quick as a flash he turned into a huge dragon.  Loki pretended to be frightened. As the fierce monster squirmed toward him, he made believe that he was going to rush from the cave.   THE TRICK  The dragon vanished and there stood Alberich again.  \"Now do you believe?\" he asked.  \"Indeed, I do,\" replied Loki. \"It is wonderful. But if you could shrink to some tiny thing, it would be even much more clever, because you could creep into a crevice and spy upon your enemies. But, of"]]]
