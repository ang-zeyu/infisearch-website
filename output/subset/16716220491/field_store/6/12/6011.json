His earnings were enough just to keep his head above water, but not enough to make us two one.  Perhaps, because everything is clear and easy for us now, I am gradually losing a proper appreciation of his struggle. That should never be. He did not win. But he did not lose; which means nearly as much. For it is almost less difficult to win than not to lose, so my mother has told me, in modern journalistic London. And I know that he would have won. The fact that he continued the fight as he did was in itself a pledge of ultimate victory. What he went through while trying with his pen to make a living for himself and me I learned from his letters.  \"London,\" he wrote, \"is not paved with gold; but in literary fields there are nuggets to be had by the lightest scratching. And those nuggets are plays. A successful play gives you money and a name automatically. What the ordinary writer makes in a year the successful dramatist receives, without labour, in a fortnight.\" He went on to deplore his total lack of dramatic intuition. \"Some men,\" he said, \"have some of the qualifications while falling short of the others. They have a sense of situation without the necessary tricks of technique. Or they sacrifice plot to atmosphere, or atmosphere to plot. I, worse luck, have not one single qualification. The nursing of a climax, the tremendous omissions in the dialogue, the knack of stage characterisation--all these things are, in some inexplicable way, outside me.\"  It was this letter that set me thinking. Ever since James had left the island, I had been chafing at the helplessness of my position. While he toiled in London, what was I doing? Nothing. I suppose I helped him in a way. The thought of me would be with him always, spurring him on to work, that the time of our separation might be less. But it was not enough. I wanted to be _doing_ something.... And it was during these restless weeks that I wrote my play.  I think nothing will ever erase from my mind the moment when the central idea of _The Girl who Waited_ came to me. It was a boisterous October evening. The wind had been rising all day. Now the branches of the lilac were dancing in the rush of the storm, and far out in the bay one could see the white crests of the waves gleaming through the growing darkness. We had just finished tea. The lamp was lit in our little drawing-room, and on the sofa, so placed that the light fell over her left shoulder in the manner recommended by oculists, sat my mother with Schopenhauer's _Art of Literature_. Ponto slept on the rug.  Something in the unruffled peace of the scene tore at my nerves. I have seldom felt so restless. It may have been the storm that made me so. I think myself that it was James's letter. The boat had been late that morning, owing to the weather, and I had not received the letter till after lunch. I listened to the howl of the wind, and longed to be out in it.  My mother looked at me over her book.  \"You are restless, Margie,\" she said. \"There is a volume of Marcus Aurelius on the table beside you, if you care to read.\"  \"No, thank you, mother,\" I said. \"I think I shall go for a walk.\"  \"Wrap up well, my dear,\" she replied.  She then resumed her book.  I went out of our little garden, and stood on the cliff. The wind flew at me like some wild thing. Spray stung my face. I was filled with a wild exhilaration.  And then the idea came to me. The simplest, most dramatic idea. Quaint, whimsical, with just that suggestion of pathos blended with it which makes the fortunes of a play. The central idea, to be brief, of _The Girl who Waited_.  Of my Maenad tramp along the cliff-top with my brain afire, and my return, draggled and dripping, an hour late for dinner; of my writing and re-writing, of my tears and black depression, of the pens I wore out and the quires of paper I spoiled, and finally of the ecstasy of the day when the piece began to move and the characters to live, I need not speak. Anyone who has ever written will know the sensations. James must have gone through a hundred times what I went through once. At last, at long last, the play was finished.  For two days I gloated alone over the great pile of manuscript.  Then I went to my mother.  My diffidence was exquisite. It was all I could do to tell her the nature of my request, when I spoke to her after lunch. At last she understood that I had written a play, and wished to read it to her. She took me to the bow-window with gentle solicitude, and waited for me to proceed.  At first she encouraged me, for I faltered over my opening words. But as I warmed to my work, and as my embarrassment left me, she no longer spoke. Her eyes were fixed intently upon the blue space beyond the lilac.  I read on and on, till at length my voice trailed over the last line, rose gallantly at the last fence, the single word _Curtain_, and abruptly broke. The strain had been too much for me.  Tenderly my mother drew me to the sofa; and quietly, with closed eyelids, I lay there until, in the soft cool of the evening, I asked for her verdict.  Seeing, as she did instantly, that it would be more dangerous to deny my request than to accede to it, she spoke.  \"That there is an absence, my dear Margie, of any relationship with life, that not a single character is in any degree human, that passion and virtue and vice and real feeling are wanting--this surprises me more than I can tell you. I had expected to listen to a natural, ordinary, unactable episode arranged more or less in steichomuthics. There is no work so scholarly and engaging as the amateur's. But in your play I am amazed to find the touch of the professional and experienced playwright. Yes, my dear, you have proved that you happen to possess the quality--one that is most difficult to acquire--of surrounding a situation which is improbable enough to be convincing with that absurdly mechanical conversation which the theatre-going public demands. As your mother, I am disappointed. I had hoped for originality. As your literary well-wisher, I stifle my maternal feelings and congratulate you unreservedly.\"  I thanked my mother effusively. I think I cried a little.  She said affectionately that the hour had been one of great interest to her, and she added that she would be glad to be consulted with regard to the steps I contemplated taking in my literary future.  She then resumed her book.  I went to my room and re-read the last letter I had had from James.                                    _The Barrel Club,                                   Covent Garden,                                   London._     MY DARLING MARGIE,--I am writing this line simply and solely for    the selfish pleasure I gain from the act of writing to you. I know    everything will come right some time or other, but at present I am    suffering from a bad attack of the blues. I am like a general who    has planned out a brilliant attack, and realises that he must fail    for want of sufficient troops to carry a position, on the taking of    which the whole success of the assault depends. Briefly, my position    is like this. My name is pretty well known in a small sort of way    among editors and the like as that of a man who can turn out fairly    good stuff. Besides this, I have many influential friends. You see    where this brings me? I am in the middle of my attacking movement,    and I have not been beaten back; but the key to the enemy's position    is still uncaptured. You know what this key is from my other letters.    It's the stage. Ah, Margie, one acting play! Only one! It would mean    everything. Apart from the actual triumph and the direct profits, it    would bring so much with it. The enemy's flank would be turned, and    the rest of the battle would become a mere rout. I should have an    accepted position in the literary world which would convert all the    other avenues to wealth on which I have my eye instantly into royal    roads. Obstacles would vanish. The fact that I was a successful    playwright would make the acceptance of the sort of work I am doing    now inevitable, and I should get paid ten times as well for it. And    it would mean--well, you know what it would mean, don't you? Darling    Margie, tell me again that I have your love, that the waiting is not    too hard, that you believe in me. Dearest, it will come right in the    end. Nothing can prevent that. Love and the will of a man have always    beaten Time and Fate. Write to me, dear.                                    _Ever your devoted                                    James._  How utterly free from thought of self! His magnificent loyalty forgot the dreadful tension of his own great battle, and pictured only the tedium of waiting which it was my part to endure.  I finished my letter to James very late that night. It was a very long and explanatory letter, and it enclosed my play.  The main point I aimed at was not to damp his spirits. He would, I knew well, see that the play was suitable for staging. He would, in short, see that I, an inexperienced girl, had done what he, a trained professional writer, had failed to do. Lest, therefore, his pique should kill admiration and pleasure when he received my work, I wrote as one begging a favour. \"Here,\" I said, \"we have the means to achieve all we want. Do not--oh, do not--criticise. I have written down the words. But the conception is yours. The play was inspired by you. But for you I should never have begun it. Take my play, James; take it as your own. For yours it is. Put your name to it, and produce it, if you love me, under your own signature. If this hurts your pride, I will word my request differently. You alone are able to manage the business side of the production. You know the right men to go to. To approach them on behalf of a stranger's work is far less likely to lead to success. I have assumed, you will see, that the play is certain to be produced. But that will only be so if"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7231"],["title","Light O' the Morning: The Story of an Irish Girl (#1)"],["body"," then he seated himself by his wife's side.  “Better, Eileen?” he said, looking at her anxiously.  “I wish you would not call me Eileen,” she said. “I hate to have my name Irishized.”  The Squire's eyes filled with suppressed fun.  “Ah, but you are half-Irish, whether you like it or not,” he said. “Is not she, colleen? Bless me, what a day it has turned out! We are getting summer weather at last. What do you say to going for a drive, Eileen--Ellen, I mean? Black Bess is eating her head off in the stables. I want to go as far as Murphy's place, and you might as well come with me.”  “And I too?” said Nora.  “To be sure, child. Why not? You run round to the stables, Norrie, and give the order.”  Nora instantly left the room, the dogs following her.  “What ails her?” said the Squire, looking at his wife.  “Ails her, Pat? Nothing that I know of.”  “Then you know very little,” was his answer. “I never see that sort of anxious frown between the colleen's brows without knowing there's mischief in the wind. Somebody has been worrying her, and I won't have it.” He put down his great hand with a thump on the nearest table.  “Don't, Pat. You quite shatter my nerves.”  “Bless you and your nerves, Ellen. I want to give them all possible consideration; but I won't have Light o' the Morning worried.”  “You'll spoil that girl; you'll rue it yet.”  “Bless her heart! I couldn't spoil her; she's unspoilable. Did you ever see a sweeter bit of a thing, sound to the core, through and through?”  “Sweet or not,” said the mother, “she has got to learn her lesson of life; and it is no good to be too tender with her; she wants a little bracing.”  “You have been trying that on--eh?”  “Well, not exactly, Pat; but you cannot expect me to keep all our troubles to ourselves. There's that mortgage, you know.”  “Bother the mortgage!” said the Squire. “Why do you harp on things the way you do? I'll manage it right enough. I am going round to see Dan Murphy now; he won't be hard on an old friend.”  “Yes; but have you not to pay up?”  “Some day, I suppose.”  “Now listen, Patrick. Do be reasonable. Whenever I speak of money you fight shy of the subject.”  “I don't--I don't,” said the Squire restlessly; “but I am dead tired. I have had a ride of thirty miles; I want my tea. Where is Nora? Do you mind my calling her? She'll order Pegeen to bring the tea here.”  “No; I won't have it. We'll have tea in the dining room presently. I thought you objected to afternoon tea.”  “So I do, as a rule; but I am mighty dhry--thirsty, I mean, Ellen. Well, all the better; I'll get more to drink in the dining room. Order the tea as soon as you please.”  “Ring the bell, Patrick.”  The Squire strode to the mantelpiece, pulled a bell-cord which hung from the ceiling, a distant bell was heard ringing in noisy fashion, and a moment afterward Pegeen put in her head.  “Come right in, Margaret,” said her mistress.  “Aw! then, I'm sorry, ma'am, I forgot,” said the girl. She came in, hiding both her hands under her apron.  Mrs. O'Shanaghgan uttered an impatient sigh.  “It is impossible to train these creatures,” she said under her breath. Aloud, she gave her order in quiet, impassive tones:  “Tea as soon as possible in the west parlor, and sound the gong when it is ready.”  “Why, then, wasn't I getting it?” said Pegeen. She left the room, leaving the door wide open.  “Just like them,” said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan. “When you want the door open they invariably shut it, and when you want it shut they leave it open.”  “They do that in England too, as far as I can tell,” said the Squire, with a slightly nettled tone in his voice.  “Well, now, Patrick, while we have a few moments to ourselves, I want to know what you mean to do about that ten thousand pounds?”  “I am sure, Ellen, it is more than I can tell you.”  “You will have to pay it, you know.”  “I suppose so, some day. I'll speak to Dan to-night. He is the last man to be hard on a chap.”  “Some more of the land must go,” said the wife in a fretful tone. “Our rent-roll will be still smaller. There will be still less money to educate Terence. I had set my heart on his going to Cambridge or Oxford. You quite forget that he is eighteen now.”  “Cambridge or Oxford!” said the Squire. “Not a bit of it. My son shall either go to Old Trinity or he does without a university education. Cambridge or Oxford indeed! You forget, Ellen, that the lad is my son as well as yours.”  “I don't; but he is half an Englishman, three parts an Englishman, whatever his fatherhood,” said the Squire's wife in a tone of triumph.  “Well, well! he is Terence O'Shanaghgan, for all that, and he will inherit this old place some day.”  “Much there will be for him to inherit.”  Eager steps were heard on the gravel, and the next instant Nora entered by the open window.  “I have given the order,” she said; “Angus will have the trap round in a quarter of an hour.”  “That's right, my girl; you didn't let time drag,” said her father.  “Angus wants you and mother to be quite ready, for he says Black Bess is nearly off her head with spirit. Now, then, mother, shall I go upstairs and bring down your things?”  “I don't mind if you do, Nora; my back aches a good bit.”  “We'll put the air-cushion in the trap,” said the Squire, who, notwithstanding her fine-lady airs, had a great respect and admiration for his wife. “We'll make you right cozy, Ellen, and a rattle through the air will do you a sight of good.”  “May I drive, father?” said Nora.  “You, little one? Suppose you bring Black Bess down on her knees? That horse is worth three hundred pounds, if she's worth a penny.”  “Do you think I would?” said the girl reproachfully. “Now, dad, that is about the cruelest word you have said to your Nora for many a day.”  “Come and give me a hug, colleen,” said the Squire.  Nora ran to him, clasped her arms round his neck, and kissed him once or twice. He had moved away to the other end of the room, and now he looked her full in the face.  “You are fretting about something?”  “Not I--not I,” said the girl; but she flushed.  “Listen to me, colleen,” said the Squire; “if it is that bit of a mortgage, you get it right out of your head. It's not going to worry _me_. I am going this very evening to have a talk with Dan.”  “Oh, if it is Dan Murphy you owe it to,” said the girl.  “Ah, he's all right; he's the right sort; a chip of the old block--eh? He wouldn't be hard on a brother in adversity?”  “He wouldn't if he could help it,” said Nora; but the cloud had not left her sensitive face. Then, seeing that father looked at her with intense anxiety, she made a valiant effort.  “Of course, I believe in you,” she said; “and, indeed, what does the loss of money matter while we are together?”  “Right you are! right you are!” said the Squire, with a laugh. He clapped her on the shoulder. “Trust Light o' the Morning to look at things in the right direction,” he said.     CHAPTER III.   THE WILD MURPHYS.  Terence made his appearance at the tea table. In every respect he was a contrast to Nora. He was very good-looking--strikingly handsome, in fact; tall, with a graceful elegance of deportment which was in striking contrast to the burly figure of the old Squire. His face was of a nut-brown hue; his eyes dark and piercing; his features straight. Young as he was, there were the first indications of a black silky mustache on his short upper lip, and his clustering black curls grew in a high ridge off a lofty brow. Terence had the somewhat languid air which more or less characterized all his mother's movements. He was devoted to her, and took his seat now by her side. She laid her very thin and slender hand on his arm. He did not respond by look or movement to the gesture of affection; but had a very close observer been present he would have noticed that he drew his chair about the tenth of an inch nearer to hers.  Nora and her father at the other end of the table were chattering volubly. Nora's face was all smiles; every vestige of that little cloud which had sat between her dark brows a few moments before had vanished. Her blue eyes were sparkling with fun.  The Squire made brilliant sally after sally, to which she responded with all an Irish girl's aptitude for repartee.  Terence and his mother conversed in low tones.  “Yes, mother,” he was saying, “I had a letter from Uncle George this morning; he wants me to go next week. Do you think you can manage?”  “How long will you be away, Terence?”  “I don't know; a couple of months, perhaps.”  “How much money will it cost?”  “I shall want an evening suit, and a new dress-suit, and something for everyday. These things are disgraceful,” said the lad, just glancing at the frayed coat-sleeve, beneath which showed a linen cuff of immaculate whiteness.  Terence was always the personification of fastidiousness in his dress, and for this trait in his character alone Mrs. O'Shanaghgan adored him.  “You shall have it,” she said--“somehow.”  “Well, I must reply tonight,” he continued. “Shall I ask the governor, or will you?”  “We won't worry him, Terry; I can manage.”  He looked at her a little anxiously.  “You are not going to sell any more of them?” he said.  “There is a gold chain and that diamond ring; I never wear either. I would fifty times rather think that you were enjoying yourself with my relations in England. You are fitted to grace any society. Do not say another word, my boy.”  “You are the very best and noblest mother in the world,” said the lad with enthusiasm.  Meanwhile, Nora and her father continued their gay conversation.  “We will take a basket with us,” said Nora, “and Bridget shall give me a couple of dozen more of those little brown eggs. Mrs. Perch shall have a brood of chicks if I can manage it.”  “Trust the girleen for that,” said the Squire, and then they rose from table.  “Ellen,” he continued, addressing his wife, “have you and Terence done colloguing together? for I hear Black Bess coming to the front door.”  “Oh, hasten, mother; hasten!”"]]]
