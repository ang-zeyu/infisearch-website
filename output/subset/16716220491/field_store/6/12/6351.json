Each of her four legs is held in position by two gods, and the god Shu, with outstretched uplifted arms, supports her body.  The Cow was published by Champollion,[FN#5] without the text.  This most important mythological text was first published and translated by Professor E. Naville in 1874.[FN#6]  It was republished by Bergmann[FN#7] and Brugsch,[FN#8] who gave a transcription of the text, with a German translation.  Other German versions by Lauth,[FN#9] Brugsch,[FN#10] and Wiedemann[FN#11] have appeared, and a part of the text was translated into French by Lefebure.[FN#12]  The latest edition of the text was published by Lefebure,[FN#13] and text of a second copy, very much mutilated, was published by Professor Naville, with a French translation in 1885.[FN#14]  The text printed in this volume is that of M.

The legend takes us back to the time when the gods of Egypt went about in the country, and mingled with men and were thoroughly acquainted with their desires and needs.  The king who reigned over Egypt was Ra, the Sun-god, who was not, however, the first of the Dynasty of Gods who ruled the land.  His predecessor on the throne was Hephaistos, who, according to Manetho, reigned 9000 years, whilst Ra reigned only 992 years; Panodorus makes his reign to have lasted less than 100 years. Be this as it may, it seems that the \"self-created and self-begotten\" god Ra had been ruling over mankind for a very long time, for his subjects were murmuring against him, and they were complaining that he was old, that his bones were like silver, his body like gold, and his hair like lapis-lazuli.  When Ra heard these murmurings he ordered his bodyguard to summon all the gods who had been with him in the primeval World-ocean, and to bid them privately to assemble in the Great House, which can be no other than the famous temple of Heliopolis.  This statement is interesting, for it proves that the legend is of Heliopolitan origin, like the cult of Ra itself, and that it does not belong, at least in so far as it applies to Ra, to the Predynastic Period.  When Ra entered the Great Temple, the gods made obeisance to him, and took up their positions on each side of him, and informed him that they awaited his words.  Addressing Nu, the personification of the World- ocean, Ra bade them to take notice of the fact that the men and women whom his Eye had created were murmuring against him.  He then asked them to consider the matter and to devise a plan of action for him, for he was unwilling to slay the rebels without hearing what his gods had to say.  In reply the gods advised Ra to send forth his Eye to destroy the blasphemers, for there was no eye on earth that could resist it, especially when it took the form of the goddess Hathor.  Ra accepted their advice and sent forth his Eye in the form of Hathor to destroy them, and, though the rebels had fled to the mountains in fear, the Eye pursued them and overtook them and destroyed them.  Hathor rejoiced in her work of destruction, and on her return was praised by Ra, for what she had done.  The slaughter of men began at Suten-henen (Herakleopolis), and during the night Hathor waded about in the blood of men.  Ra asserted his intention of being master of the rebels, and this is probably referred to in the Book of the Dead, Chapter XVII., in which it is said that Ra rose as king for the first time in Suten- henen.  Osiris also was crowned at Suten-henen, and in this city lived the great Bennu bird, or Phoenix, and the \"Crusher of Bones\" mentioned in the Negative Confession.  The legend now goes on to describe an act of Ra, the significance of which it is difficult to explain.  The god ordered messengers to be brought to him, and when they arrived, he commanded them to run like the wind to Abu, or the city of Elephantine, and to bring him large quantities of the fruit called tataat.  What kind of fruit this was is not clear, but Brugsch thought they were \"mandrakes,\" the so-called \"love-apples,\" and this translation of tataat may be used provisionally.  The mandrakes were given to Sekti, a goddess of Heliopolis, to crush and grind up, and when this was done they were mixed with human blood, and put in a large brewing of beer which the women slaves had made from wheat.  In all they made 7,000 vessels of beer.  When Ra saw the beer he approved of it, and ordered it to be carried up the river to where the goddess Hathor was still, it seems, engaged in slaughtering men.  During the night he caused this beer to be poured out into the meadows of the Four Heavens, and when Hathor came she saw the beer with human blood and mandrakes in it, and drank of it and became drunk, and paid no further attention to men and women. In welcoming the goddess, Ra, called her \"Amit,\" i.e., \"beautiful one,\" and from this time onward \"beautiful women were found in the city of Amit,\" which was situated in the Western Delta, near Lake Mareotis.[FN#15]  Ra also ordered that in future at every one of his festivals vessels of \"sleep-producing beer\" should be made, and that their number should be the same as the number of the handmaidens of Ra. Those who took part in these festivals of Hathor and Ra drank beer in very large quantities, and under the influence of the \"beautiful women,\" i.e., the priestesses, who were supposed to resemble Hathor in their physical attractions, the festal celebrations degenerated into drunken and licentious orgies.    [FN#15]  It was also called the \"City of Apis,\" (Brugsch, Dict. Geog., p. 491), and is the Apis city of classical writers.  It is, perhaps, represented by the modern Kom al-Hisn.    Soon after this Ra complained that he was smitten with pain, and that he was weary of the, children of men.  He thought them a worthless remnant, and wished that more of them had been slain.  The gods about him begged him to endure, and reminded him that his power was in proportion to his will.  Ra was, however, unconsoled, and he complained that his limbs were weak for the first time in his life.  Thereupon the god Nu told Shu to help Ra, and he ordered Nut to take the great god Ra on her back.  Nut changed herself into a cow, and with the help of Shu Ra got on her back. As soon as men saw that Ra was on the back of the Cow of Heaven, and was about to leave them, they became filled with fear and repentance, and cried out to Ra to remain with them and to slay all those who had blasphemed against him.  But the Cow moved on her way, and carried Ra to Het-Ahet, a town of the nome of Mareotis, where in later days the right leg of Osiris was said to be preserved. Meanwhile darkness covered the land.  When day broke the men who had repented of their blasphemies appeared with their bows, and slew the enemies of Ra.  At this result Ra was pleased, and he forgave those who had repented because of their righteous slaughter of his enemies.  From this time onwards human sacrifices were offered up at the festivals of Ra celebrated in this place, and at Heliopolis and in other parts of Egypt.  After these things Ra declared to Nut that he intended to leave this world, and to ascend into heaven, and that all those who would see his face must follow him thither.  Then he went up into heaven and prepared a place to which all might come.  Then he said, \"Hetep sekhet aa,\" i.e., \"Let a great field be produced,\" and straightway \"Sekhet-hetep,\" or the \"Field of peace,\" came into being.  He next said, \"Let there be reeds (aaru) in it,\" and straightway \"Sekhet Aaru,\" or the \"Field of Reeds,\" came into being.  Sekhet-hetep was the Elysian Fields of the Egyptians, and the Field of Reeds was a well-known section of it. Another command of the god Ra resulted in the creation of the stars, which the legend compares to flowers.  Then the goddess Nut trembled in all her body, and Ra, fearing that she might fall, caused to come into being the Four Pillars on which the heavens are supported.  Turning to Shu, Ra entreated him to protect these supports, and to place himself under Nut, and to hold her up in position with his hands.  Thus Shu became the new Sun-god in the place of Ra, and the heavens in which Ra lived were supported and placed beyond the risk of falling, and mankind would live and rejoice in the light of the new sun.  At this place in the legend a text is inserted called the \"Chapter of the Cow.\"  It describes how the Cow of Heaven and the two Boats of the Sun shall be painted, and gives the positions of the gods who stand by the legs of the Cow, and a number of short magical names, or formulae, which are inexplicable.  The general meaning of the picture of the Cow is quite clear.  The Cow represents the sky in which the Boats of Ra, sail, and her four legs are the four cardinal points which cannot be changed.  The region above her back is the heaven in which Ra reigns over the beings who pass thereto from this earth when they die, and here was situated the home of the gods and the celestial spirits who govern this world.  When Ra had made a heaven for himself, and had arranged for a continuance of life on the earth, and the welfare of human beings, he remembered that at one time when reigning on earth he had been bitten by a serpent, and had nearly lost his life through the bite.

I bought them in exchange for a good he goat from Klerkon Flatface. Very soon I found the younger lad was worthless. There was little that I could do with him; so I sold him to a dalesman named Reas, who gave me a very fine rain cloak for him; nor do I rue my bargain, for the cloak is still in use and the lad is scarcely of the value of his food and shelter.\"  \"How do men name the lad?\" inquired Sigurd. \"And whose son is he?\"  \"Whose son he may be is no concern of mine,\" answered the merchant. \"Some viking's brat, it may be; for he has the viking spirit in him, and the salt of the sea is in his veins. No landman can tame him. As to his name, if ever he had one, 'tis certain he has none now, and is only known as Reasthrall, for he is the thrall of Reas the bonder.\"  \"If it be that Reas will sell his thrall,\" said Sigurd, \"then I would willingly buy the lad, and take him back with me into Holmgard as an offering to the Queen Allogia.\"  \"Think twice ere you act so unkindly towards the queen,\" said the merchant. \"A goodlier gift for Allogia would surely be the jewelled brooch that I showed you yesternight; and you shall have it very cheap. The price is but twelve gold marks.\"  But before Sigurd could reply a heavy hand was laid upon his shoulder, and a gruff voice called out his name. He turned and saw at his side the tall red bearded viking chief, whose broken nose and coarse scarred face were now shielded from the sun's rays by a wide hat made of dry reeds.  \"Well met, Hersir Sigurd!\" said the warrior. \"And what lordly business brings you north to the coast? 'Tis long since last we met--not since the yuletide feast at Holmgard, two winters back, when we had the horse fight. How fares the Flanders mare that won such glory at that time?\"  \"A sickness killed her,\" answered Sigurd. \"But I have a foal in training that will soon beat any horse in Holmgard; ay, even in Norway. So if you have a mind to see a good horse fight, come when you will with the best horses you can find. I wager you that mine will beat them all.\"  \"If I meet not my death before the end of the cruising season,\" said the viking, \"then will I engage to bring you the best horse in all the Norseland to fight against.\" He looked among the crowd of boys that still loitered near the ship, and added--\"Where has the youngster gone who stood just now upon the plank? He has in him the makings of a good war man. Such lads as he are scarce, and I would buy him if he be for sale.\"  And then the merchant spoke.  \"Why,\" said he, addressing the viking, \"'tis but six summers since that you sold that self same boy, here on this marketplace. 'Twas I who bought him from you, Klerkon. Have you forgotten the white haired he goat that you got from me?\"  \"Life is too full for me to keep mind of such small events,\" answered Klerkon. \"But since the lad is yours, what price do you now put upon him?\"  \"Nay, he is no chattel of mine,\" said the merchant. \"He is the thrall of goodman Reas, over in Rathsdale--a morning's walk from here. If you would deal with him a guide will soon be got to take you over the hill.\"  \"Young flesh will keep,\" returned the warrior. \"I will buy the lad next time we come to Esthonia.\"  Sigurd said: \"It may be that ere that time he will already be sold, Jarl Klerkon; for it chances that I also have taken a fancy to him.\"  \"In that case,\" said the viking, \"we may make him the stake to be fought for in our coming horse fight. And if my horse overcomes yours, then the lad shall be my prize, and I will make a viking of him.\"  \"And how if the victory be mine and not yours?\" asked Sigurd.  \"You shall have value equal to the boy, be assured of that, hersir.\"  \"Agreed,\" said Sigurd. \"And now, what news have you from west over sea?\"  \"Ill news and good. There has fallen a great famine in Norway. In Thrandheim the folk are dying for lack of corn and fish, and in Halogaland the snow has lain over the valleys nigh until midsummer, so that all the livestock have been bound in stall and fed upon birch buds. Men lay the famine to the account of Gunnhild's sons, who are over greedy of money and deal hardly with the husbandmen. There is little peace in the land, for the kings are for ever quarrelling over their jointures; but it seems that Harald Greyfell is having the upper hand over his brothers. Little joy is there in ruling over a realm these days. I had rather be as I am, an honest sea rover.\"  \"Doubtless the viking life is, after all, the most joyful that a man can live,\" said Sigurd. \"How fare our friends at Jomsburg?\"  \"Right well, as always,\" answered Klerkon. \"Sigvaldi has built himself a fine new dragonship of five and twenty seats, and the Jomsvikings now number in all seven times ten hundred men. They speak of making a sally across the sea to Angle land, where there is corn and ale in plenty, with fine clothes, good arms, and vessels of silver and gold to be won; for these Christian folk are very rich, and there is abundance of treasure in their churches, with many a golden bowl and well wrought drinking horn as booty for those who are bold enough to make the adventure.\"  \"But these Angles are good fighting men, I hear,\" said Sigurd. \"And they have many well built ships.\"  \"They are ill matched against the vikings, with all their ships,\" returned Klerkon. \"And I am told that their king is a man of peace; Edgar the Peaceable, they name him. And talking of kings, how fares King Valdemar?\"  \"As sunny as a summer's noon,\" answered Sigurd.  \"Come, then, on board my ship, and let us pledge to him in a full horn of mead,\" said the viking. And he drew Sigurd with him across the gangplank, and they went below and sat drinking until one of the shipmen standing on the vessel's lypting, or poop deck, sounded a shrill horn as a sign that the ship was about to leave the harbour.  Then Sigurd came ashore and went about the town on the king's business, and he thought no more of the yellow haired slave boy until the evening time.  It chanced then that he was again beside the sea.  Down there on the shore he stood alone, idly watching the white winged seabirds--some floating in their own reflections on the calm pools of water left by the outgoing tide, others seeking food amid the green and crimson weeds that lay in bright patches on the rocks--and often he turned his eyes in the direction of the setting sun, where, in the mid sea, Jarl Klerkon's dragonship moved slowly outward, with her wet oars glistening in the rosy light.  Suddenly from behind him there came a merry childish laugh, and he turned quickly round, and saw very near to him the white clothed slave boy of the gangplank. The lad was standing at the brink of a deep pool of seawater, and had, as it seemed, started a fleet of empty mussel shells to float upon the calm surface. He was dropping pebbles from his full hand into the water, to give movement to the tiny boats.  Sigurd stepped quietly behind him, and then said:  \"Why do you thus set these shells to sail?\"  The boy looked up in surprise, and his blue eyes rested for a long time upon the tall strange man. Then he answered:  \"Because, hersir, they are my warships, setting out upon a viking cruise.\"  At this Sigurd smiled.  \"It may be, my boy,\" said he, \"that you will yourself command great ships of war in time to come.\"  \"That is what I should wish,\" said the boy, \"for then I might take blood vengeance upon my enemies.\"  \"Not often do I hear one so young thus speak of enemies,\" said Sigurd. \"What is your age?\"  \"Ten winters.\"  \"And your name?\"  The boy looked up once more into the stranger's face, and at his large crested helmet of bronze and gold. He glanced, too, at the man's great sword and his cloak of rich blue cloth, and guessed rightly that he was of noble rank. There was a smile upon his lips, and his eyes were tender and kindly, winning confidence.  \"My name is Olaf,\" answered the boy.  \"Whose son?\" asked Sigurd.  At this question Olaf turned aside, threw his pebbles away into the water, and wiped his wet hands on his coarse kirtle. Then stepping nearer to the stranger he stood upright and said, almost in a whisper, as though fearing that even the seagulls might overhear him:  \"I am King Triggvi's son.\"  Sigurd drew back with a little start.  \"King Triggvi's son!\" he echoed in surprise. And then he looked yet more keenly into the boy's face, as if to seek some likeness there.  \"Even so,\" returned Olaf. \"And what of that? Little good can it do me to be a king's son if I am also a slave, made to work hard for my daily portion of black bread and tough horse flesh. Triggvi is in Valhalla, with Harald Fairhair and the rest of them, and he cannot help me now. But Odin be thanked, he died not like a cow upon a bed of straw, but with sword in hand like a brave good man.\"  \"A brave good man in truth he was,\" said Sigurd. \"But tell me, boy, what token have you to prove that you are indeed the child of Triggvi Olafson? You are but ten winters old, you say; and yet, as I reckon it, Triggvi was slain full ten winters back. How can I know the truth of what you tell?\"  \"No token have I but my bare words,\" answered Olaf proudly.  Sigurd caught him by the hand and led him up the beach to a ledge of rock, and sat him down before him, bidding him tell how it came about that he was here in bondage in a foreign land.  So Olaf answered him thus:  \"I came into the world an orphan,\" said he, \"and never heard my father's voice. But my mother bade me ever remember that I was a king's son, and to make myself worthy. Astrid was the name of my mother. She was the daughter of Erik Biodaskalli, who dwelt at Ofrestead, in the Uplands, a mighty man. Now, after the slaying of Triggvi, Queen Astrid was forced to fly from the realm of Viken, lest she too should fall into the hands of Gunnhild and her wicked sons and be slain. And she travelled as a fugitive through many lands. In her company was her foster father, Thoralf Loosebeard by name. He never departed from her, but"]]]
