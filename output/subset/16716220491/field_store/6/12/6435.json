They were face to face, and it was hard to tell to which one of them the other was the least welcome. But Andrew spoke first. A thick silence had fallen in the saloon. Most of the onlookers wore careless smiles, for the caliber of these two was known, and no one expected violence; but Jasper Lanning, at the door, stood with a sick face. He was praying in the silence.  Every one could hear Andrew say: \"I hear you've been making a talk about me, Buck?\"  It was a fair enough opening. The blood ran more freely in the veins of Jasper. Perhaps the quiet of his boy had not been altogether the quiet of cowardice.  \"Aw,\" answered Buck Heath, \"don't you be takin' everything you hear for gospel. What kind of talk do you mean?\"  \"He's layin' down,\" said Bill Dozier, and his voice was soft but audible in the saloon. \"The skunk!\"  \"I was about to say,\" said Andrew, \"that I think you had no cause for talk. I've done you no harm, Buck.\"  The hush in the saloon became thicker; eyes of pity turned on that proved man, Jasper Lanning. He had bowed his head. And the words of the younger man had an instant effect on Buck Heath. They seemed to infuriate him.  \"You've done me no harm?\" he echoed. He let his voice out; he even glanced back and took pleasurable note of the crowded faces behind the dim windows of the saloon. Just then Geary, the saloon keeper, lighted one of the big lamps, and at once all the faces at the windows became black silhouettes. \"You done me no harm?\" repeated Buck Heath. \"Ain't you been goin' about makin' a talk that you was after me? Well, son, here I am. Now let's see you eat!\"  \"I've said nothing about you,\" declared Andy. There was a groan from the saloon. Once more all eyes flashed across to Jasper Lanning.  \"Bah!\" snorted Buck Heath, and raised his hand. To crown the horror, the other stepped back. A little puff of alkali dust attested the movement.  \"I'll tell you,\" roared Buck, \"you ain't fittin' for a man's hand to touch, you ain't. A hosswhip is more your style.\"  From the pommel of his saddle he snatched his quirt. It whirled, hummed in the air, and then cracked on the shoulders of Andrew. In the dimness of the saloon door a gun flashed in the hand of Jasper Lanning. It was a swift draw, but he was not in time to shoot, for Andy, with a cry, ducked in under the whip as it raised for the second blow and grappled with Buck Heath. They swayed, then separated as though they had been torn apart. But the instant of contact had told Andy a hundred things. He was much smaller than the other, but he knew that he was far and away stronger after that grapple. It cleared his brain, and his nerves ceased jumping.  \"Keep off,\" he said. \"I've no wish to harm you.\"  \"You houn' dog!\" yelled Buck, and leaped in with a driving fist.  It bounced off the shoulder of Andrew. At the same time he saw those banked heads at the windows of the saloon, and knew it was a trap for him. All the scorn and the grief which had been piling up in him, all the cold hurt went into the effort as he stepped in and snapped his fist into the face of Buck Heath. He rose with the blow; all his energy, from wrist to instep, was in that lifting drive. Then there was a jarring impact that made his arm numb to the shoulder. Buck Heath looked blankly at him, wavered, and pitched loosely forward on his face. And his head bounced back as it struck the ground. It was a horrible thing to see, but it brought one wild yell of joy from the saloon--the voice of Jasper Lanning.  Andrew had dropped to his knees and turned the body upon its back. The stone had been half buried in the dust, but it had cut a deep, ragged gash on the forehead of Buck. His eyes were open, glazed; his mouth sagged; and as the first panic seized Andy he fumbled at the heart of the senseless man and felt no beat.  \"Dead!\" exclaimed Andy, starting to his feet. Men were running toward him from the saloon, and their eagerness made him see a picture he had once seen before. A man standing in the middle of a courtroom; the place crowded; the judge speaking from behind the desk: \"--to be hanged by the neck until--\"  A revolver came into the hand of Andrew. And when he found his voice, there was a snapping tension in it.  \"Stop!\" he called. The scattering line stopped like horses thrown back on their haunches by jerked bridle reins. \"And don't make no move,\" continued Andy, gathering the reins of Buck's horse behind him. A blanket of silence had dropped on the street.  \"The first gent that shows metal,\" said Andy, \"I'll drill him. Keep steady!\"  He turned and flashed into the saddle. Once more his gun covered them. He found his mind working swiftly, calmly. His knees pressed the long holster of an old-fashioned rifle. He knew that make of gun from toe to foresight; he could assemble it in the dark.  \"You, Perkins! Get your hands away from your hip. Higher, blast you!\"  He was obeyed. His voice was thin, but it kept that line of hands high above their heads. When he moved his gun the whole line winced; it was as if his will were communicated to them on electric currents. He sent his horse into a walk; into a trot; then dropped along the saddle, and was plunging at full speed down the street, leaving a trail of sharp alkali dust behind him and a long, tingling yell.     CHAPTER 4   Only one man in the crowd was old enough to recognize that yell, and the one man was Jasper Lanning. A great, singing happiness filled his heart and his throat. But the shouting of the men as they tumbled into their saddles cleared his brain. He called to Deputy Bill Dozier, who was kneeling beside the prostrate form of Buck Heath: \"Call 'em off, Bill. Call 'em off, or, by the Lord, I'll take a hand in this! He done it in self-defense. He didn't even pull a gun on Buck. Bill, call 'em off!\"  And Bill did it most effectually. He straightened, and then got up. \"Some of you fools get some sense, will you?\" he called. \"Buck ain't dead; he's just knocked out!\"  It brought them back, a shamefaced crew, laughing at each other. \"Where's a doctor?\" demanded Bill Dozier.  Someone who had an inkling of how wounds should be cared for was instantly at work over Buck. \"He's not dead,\" pronounced this authority, \"but he's danged close to it. Fractured skull, that's what he's got. And a fractured jaw, too, looks to me. Yep, you can hear the bone grate!\"  Jasper Lanning was in the midst of a joyous monologue. \"You seen it, boys? One punch done it. That's what the Lannings are--the one-punch kind. And you seen him get to his gun? Handy! Lord, but it done me good to see him mosey that piece of iron off'n his hip. And see him take that saddle? Where was you with your gal, Joe? Nowhere! Looked to me like--\"  The voice of Bill Dozier broke in: \"I want a posse. Who'll ride with Bill Dozier tonight?\"  It sobered Jasper Lanning. \"What d'you mean by that?\" he asked. \"Didn't the boy fight clean?\"  \"Maybe,\" admitted Dozier. \"But Buck may kick out. And if he dies they's got to be a judge talk to your boy. Come on. I want volunteers.\"  \"Dozier, what's all this fool talk?\"  \"Don't bother me, Lanning. I got a duty to perform, ain't I? Think I'm going to let 'em say later on that anybody done this and then got away from Bill Dozier? Not me!\"  \"Bill,\" said Jasper, \"I read in your mind. You're lookin' for action, and you want to get it out of Andy.\"  \"I want nothin' but to get him back.\"  \"Think he'll let you come close enough to talk? He'll think you want him for murder, that's what. Keep off of this boy, Bill. Let him hear the news; then he'll come back well enough.\"  \"You waste my time,\" said Bill, \"and all the while a man that the law wants is puttin' ground between him and Martindale. Now, boys, you hear me talk. Who's with Bill Dozier to bring back this milk-fed kid?\"  It brought a snarl from Jasper Lanning. \"Why don't you go after him by yourself, Dozier? I had your job once and I didn't ask no helpers on it.\"  But Bill Dozier apparently had no liking for a lonely ride. He made his demand once more, and the volunteers came out. In five minutes he had selected five sturdy men, and every one of the five was a man whose name was known.  They went down the street of Martindale without shouting and at a steady lope which their horses could keep up indefinitely. Old Jasper followed them to the end of the village and kept on watching through the dusk until the six horsemen loomed on the hill beyond against the sky line. They were still cantering, and they rode close together like a tireless pack of wolves. After this old Jasper went back to his house, and when the door closed behind him a lonely echo went through the place.  \"Bah!\" said Jasper. \"I'm getting soft!\"  In the meantime the posse went on, regardless of direction. There were only two possible paths for a horseman out of Martindale; east and west the mountains blocked the way, and young Lanning had started north. Straight ahead of them the mountains shot up on either side of Grant's Pass, and toward this natural landmark Bill Dozier led the way. Not that he expected to have to travel as far as this. He felt fairly certain that the fugitive would ride out his horse at full speed, and then he would camp for the night and make a fire.  Andrew Lanning was town bred and soft of skin from the work at the forge. When the biting night air got through his clothes he would need warmth from a fire.  Bill Dozier led on his men for three hours at a steady pace until they came to Sullivan's ranch house in the valley. The place was dark, but the deputy threw a loose circle of his men around the house, and then knocked at the front door. Old man Sullivan answered in his bare feet. Did he know of the passing of young Lanning? Not only that, but he had sold Andrew a horse. It seemed that Andrew was making a hurried trip; that Buck Heath had loaned him his horse for the first leg of it, and that Buck would call later for the animal. It had sounded strange, but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9905"],["title","A Deal in Wheat and Other Stories of the New and Old West (#1)"],["body","upon the strangeness of the circumstance. (That was for afterward.) Their response to the offer was as unconscious, as reflex action and almost as rapid, and before the pit was well aware of what had happened the transaction of one thousand bushels was down upon Going's trading-card and fifteen hundred dollars had changed hands. But here was a marvel--the whole available supply of wheat cornered, Hornung master of the situation, invincible, unassailable; yet behold a man willing to sell, a Bear bold enough to raise his head.  \"That was Kennedy, wasn't it, who made that offer?\" asked Kimbark, as Going noted down the trade--\"Kennedy, that new man?\"  \"Yes; who do you suppose he's selling for; who's willing to go short at this stage of the game?\"  \"Maybe he ain't short.\"  \"Short! Great heavens, man; where'd he get the stuff?\"  \"Blamed if I know. We can account for every handful of May. Steady! Oh, there he goes again.\"  \"Sell a thousand May at one-fifty,\" vociferated the bear-broker, throwing out his hand, one finger raised to indicate the number of \"contracts\" offered. This time it was evident that he was attacking the Hornung crowd deliberately, for, ignoring the jam of traders that swept toward him, he looked across the pit to where Going and Kimbark were shouting _\"Sold! Sold!\"_ and nodded his head.  A second time Going made memoranda of the trade, and either the Hornung holdings were increased by two thousand bushels of May wheat or the Hornung bank account swelled by at least three thousand dollars of some unknown short's money.  Of late--so sure was the bull crowd of its position--no one had even thought of glancing at the inspection sheet on the bulletin board. But now one of Going's messengers hurried up to him with the announcement that this sheet showed receipts at Chicago for that morning of twenty-five thousand bushels, and not credited to Hornung. Some one had got hold of a line of wheat overlooked by the \"clique\" and was dumping it upon them.  \"Wire the Chief,\" said Going over his shoulder to Merriam. This one struggled out of the crowd, and on a telegraph blank scribbled:  \"Strong bear movement--New man--Kennedy--Selling in lots of five contracts--Chicago receipts twenty-five thousand.\"  The message was despatched, and in a few moments the answer came back, laconic, of military terseness:  \"Support the market.\"  And Going obeyed, Merriam and Kimbark following, the new broker fairly throwing the wheat at them in thousand-bushel lots.  \"Sell May at 'fifty; sell May; sell May.\" A moment's indecision, an instant's hesitation, the first faint suggestion of weakness, and the market would have broken under them. But for the better part of four hours they stood their ground, taking all that was offered, in constant communication with the Chief, and from time to time stimulated and steadied by his brief, unvarying command:  \"Support the market.\"  At the close of the session they had bought in the twenty-five thousand bushels of May. Hornung's position was as stable as a rock, and the price closed even with the opening figure--one dollar and a half.  But the morning's work was the talk of all La Salle Street. Who was back of the raid?  What was the meaning of this unexpected selling? For weeks the pit trading had been merely nominal. Truslow, the Great Bear, from whom the most serious attack might have been expected, had gone to his country seat at Geneva Lake, in Wisconsin, declaring himself to be out of the market entirely. He went bass-fishing every day.   IV. THE BELT LINE  On a certain day toward the middle of the month, at a time when the mysterious Bear had unloaded some eighty thousand bushels upon Hornung, a conference was held in the library of Hornung's home. His broker attended it, and also a clean-faced, bright-eyed individual whose name of Cyrus Ryder might have been found upon the pay-roll of a rather well-known detective agency. For upward of half an hour after the conference began the detective spoke, the other two listening attentively, gravely.  \"Then, last of all,\" concluded Ryder, \"I made out I was a hobo, and began stealing rides on the Belt Line Railroad. Know the road? It just circles Chicago. Truslow owns it. Yes? Well, then I began to catch on. I noticed that cars of certain numbers--thirty-one nought thirty-four, thirty-two one ninety--well, the numbers don't matter, but anyhow, these cars were always switched onto the sidings by Mr. Truslow's main elevator D soon as they came in. The wheat was shunted in, and they were pulled out again. Well, I spotted one car and stole a ride on her. Say, look here, _that car went right around the city on the Belt, and came back to D again, and the same wheat in her all the time_. The grain was reinspected--it was raw, I tell you--and the warehouse receipts made out just as though the stuff had come in from Kansas or Iowa.\"  \"The same wheat all the time!\" interrupted Hornung.  \"The same wheat--your wheat, that you sold to Truslow.\"  \"Great snakes!\" ejaculated Hornung's broker. \"Truslow never took it abroad at all.\"  \"Took it abroad! Say, he's just been running it around Chicago, like the supers in 'Shenandoah,' round an' round, so you'd think it was a new lot, an' selling it back to you again.\"  \"No wonder we couldn't account for so much wheat.\"  \"Bought it from us at one-ten, and made us buy it back--our own wheat--at one-fifty.\"  Hornung and his broker looked at each other in silence for a moment. Then all at once Hornung struck the arm of his chair with his fist and exploded in a roar of laughter. The broker stared for one bewildered moment, then followed his example.  \"Sold! Sold!\" shouted Hornung almost gleefully. \"Upon my soul it's as good as a Gilbert and Sullivan show. And we--Oh, Lord! Billy, shake on it, and hats off to my distinguished friend, Truslow. He'll be President some day. Hey! What? Prosecute him? Not I.\"  \"He's done us out of a neat hatful of dollars for all that,\" observed the broker, suddenly grave.  \"Billy, it's worth the price.\"  \"We've got to make it up somehow.\"  \"Well, tell you what. We were going to boost the price to one seventy-five next week, and make that our settlement figure.\"  \"Can't do it now. Can't afford it.\"  \"No. Here; we'll let out a big link; we'll put wheat at two dollars, and let it go at that.\"  \"Two it is, then,\" said the broker.   V. THE BREAD LINE  The street was very dark and absolutely deserted. It was a district on the \"South Side,\" not far from the Chicago River, given up largely to wholesale stores, and after nightfall was empty of all life. The echoes slept but lightly hereabouts, and the slightest footfall, the faintest noise, woke them upon the instant and sent them clamouring up and down the length of the pavement between the iron shuttered fronts. The only light visible came from the side door of a certain \"Vienna\" bakery, where at one o'clock in the morning loaves of bread were given away to any who should ask. Every evening about nine o'clock the outcasts began to gather about the side door. The stragglers came in rapidly, and the line--the \"bread line,\" as it was called--began to form. By midnight it was usually some hundred yards in length, stretching almost the entire length of the block.  Toward ten in the evening, his coat collar turned up against the fine drizzle that pervaded the air, his hands in his pockets, his elbows gripping his sides, Sam Lewiston came up and silently took his place at the end of the line.  Unable to conduct his farm upon a paying basis at the time when Truslow, the \"Great Bear,\" had sent the price of grain down to sixty-two cents a bushel, Lewiston had turned over his entire property to his creditors, and, leaving Kansas for good, had abandoned farming, and had left his wife at her sister's boarding-house in Topeka with the understanding that she was to join him in Chicago so soon as he had found a steady job. Then he had come to Chicago and had turned workman. His brother Joe conducted a small hat factory on Archer Avenue, and for a time he found there a meager employment. But difficulties had occurred, times were bad, the hat factory was involved in debts, the repealing of a certain import duty on manufactured felt overcrowded the home market with cheap Belgian and French products, and in the end his brother had assigned and gone to Milwaukee.  Thrown out of work, Lewiston drifted aimlessly about Chicago, from pillar to post, working a little, earning here a dollar, there a dime, but always sinking, sinking, till at last the ooze of the lowest bottom dragged at his feet and the rush of the great ebb went over him and engulfed him and shut him out from the light, and a park bench became his home and the \"bread line\" his chief makeshift of subsistence.  He stood now in the enfolding drizzle, sodden, stupefied with fatigue. Before and behind stretched the line. There was no talking. There was no sound. The street was empty. It was so still that the passing of a cable-car in the adjoining thoroughfare grated like prolonged rolling explosions, beginning and ending at immeasurable distances. The drizzle descended incessantly. After a long time midnight struck.  There was something ominous and gravely impressive in this interminable line of dark figures, close-pressed, soundless; a crowd, yet absolutely still; a close-packed, silent file, waiting, waiting in the vast deserted night-ridden street; waiting without a word, without a movement, there under the night and under the slow-moving mists of rain.  Few in the crowd were professional beggars. Most of them were workmen, long since out of work, forced into idleness by long-continued \"hard times,\" by ill luck, by sickness. To them the \"bread line\" was a godsend. At least they could not starve. Between jobs here in the end was something to hold them up--a small platform, as it were, above the sweep of black water, where for a moment they might pause and take breath before the plunge.  The period of waiting"]]]
