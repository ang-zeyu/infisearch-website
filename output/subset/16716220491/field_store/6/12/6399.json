Let this pass.  My lord rejects the belief in the agencies of the angels; doth he still retain belief in the wisdom of mortal men?\"  \"Yes!\" returned Boabdil, quickly; \"for of the one I know nought; of the other, mine own senses can be the judge.  Almamen, my fiery kinsman, Muza, hath this evening been with me.  He hath urged me to reject the fears of my people, which chain my panting spirit within these walls; he hath urged me to gird on yonder shield and cimiter, and to appear in the Vivarrambla, at the head of the nobles of Granada.  My heart leaps high at the thought! and if I cannot live, at least I will die--a king!\"  \"It is nobly spoken,\" said Almamen, coldly.  \"You approve, then, my design?\"  \"The friends of the king cannot approve the ambition of the king to die.\"  \"Ha!\" said Boabdil, in an altered voice, \"thou thinkest, then, that I am doomed to perish in this struggle?\"  \"As the hour shall be chosen, wilt thou fall or triumph.\"  \"And that hour?\"  \"Is not yet come.\"  \"Dost thou read the hour in the stars?\"  \"Let Moorish seers cultivate that frantic credulity: thy servant sees but in the stars worlds mightier than this little earth, whose light would neither wane nor wink, if earth itself were swept from the infinities of space.\"  \"Mysterious man!\" said Boabdil; \"whence, then, is thy power?--whence thy knowledge of the future?\"  Almamen approached the king, as he now stood by the open balcony.  \"Behold!\" said he, pointing to the waters of the Darro--\"yonder stream is of an element in which man cannot live nor breathe: above, in the thin and impalpable air, our steps cannot find a footing, the armies of all earth cannot build an empire.  And yet, by the exercise of a little art, the fishes and the birds, the inhabitants of the air and the water, minister to our most humble wants, the most common of our enjoyments; so it is with the true science of enchantment.  Thinkest thou that, while the petty surface of the world is crowded with living things, there is no life in the vast centre within the earth, and the immense ether that surrounds it?  As the fisherman snares his prey, as the fowler entraps the bird, so, by the art and genius of our human mind, we may thrall and command the subtler beings of realms and elements which our material bodies cannot enter--our gross senses cannot survey.  This, then, is my lore.  Of other worlds know I nought; but of the things of this world, whether men, or, as your legends term them, ghouls and genii, I have learned something.  To the future, I myself am blind; but I can invoke and conjure up those whose eyes are more piercing, whose natures are more gifted.\"  \"Prove to me thy power,\" said Boabdil, awed less by the words than by the thrilling voice and the impressive aspect of the enchanter.  \"Is not the king's will my law?\" answered Almamen; \"be his will obeyed. To-morrow night I await thee.\"  \"Where?\"  Almamen paused a moment, and then whispered a sentence in the king's ear: Boabdil started, and turned pale.  \"A fearful spot!\"  \"So is the Alhambra itself, great Boabdil; while Ferdinand is without the walls and Muza within the city.\"  \"Muza!  Darest thou mistrust my bravest warrior?\"  \"What wise king will trust the idol of the king's army?  Did Boabdil fall to-morrow by a chance javelin, in the field, whom would the nobles and the warriors place upon his throne?  Doth it require an enchanter's lore to whisper to thy heart the answer in the name of 'Muza'?\"  \"Oh, wretched state! oh, miserable king!\" exclaimed Boabdil, in a tone of great anguish.  \"I never had a father.  I have now no people; a little while, and I shall have no country.  Am I never to have a friend?\"  \"A friend! what king ever had?\" returned Almamen, drily.  \"Away, man--away!\" cried Boabdil, as the impatient spirit of his rank and race shot dangerous fire from his eyes; \"your cold and bloodless wisdom freezes up all the veins of my manhood!  Glory, confidence, human sympathy, and feeling--your counsels annihilate them all.  Leave me! I would be alone.\"  \"We meet to-morrow, at midnight, mighty Boabdil,\" said Almamen, with his usual unmoved and passionless tones.  \"May the king live for ever.\"  The king turned; but his monitor had already disappeared.  He went as he came--noiseless and sudden as a ghost.     CHAPTER III.  THE LOVERS.  When Muza parted from Almamen, he bent his steps towards the hill that rises opposite the ascent crowned with the towers of the Alhambra; the sides and summit of which eminence were tenanted by the luxurious population of the city.  He selected the more private and secluded paths; and, half way up the hill, arrived, at last, before a low wall of considerable extent, which girded the gardens of some wealthier inhabitant of the city.  He looked long and anxiously round; all was solitary; nor was the stillness broken, save as an occasional breeze, from the snowy heights of the Sierra Nevada, rustled the fragrant leaves of the citron and pomegranate; or as the silver tinkling of waterfalls chimed melodiously within the gardens.  The Moor's heart beat high: a moment more, and he had scaled the wall; and found himself upon a green sward, variegated by the rich colours of many a sleeping flower, and shaded by groves and alleys of luxuriant foliage and golden fruits.  It was not long before he stood beside a house that seemed of a construction anterior to the Moorish dynasty.  It was built over low cloisters formed by heavy and timeworn pillars, concealed, for the most part by a profusion of roses and creeping shrubs: the lattices above the cloisters opened upon large gilded balconies, the super-addition of Moriscan taste.  In one only of the casements a lamp was visible; the rest of the mansion was dark, as if, save in that chamber, sleep kept watch over the inmates.  It was to this window that the Moor stole; and, after a moment's pause, he murmured rather than sang, so low and whispered was his voice, the following simple verses, slightly varied from an old Arabian poet:--                 Light of my soul, arise, arise!                Thy sister lights are in the skies;                          We want thine eyes,                          Thy joyous eyes;                The Night is mourning for thine eyes!                The sacred verse is on my sword,                But on my heart thy name                The words on each alike adored;                The truth of each the same,                The same!--alas! too well I feel                The heart is truer than the steel!                Light of my soul! upon me shine;                Night wakes her stars to envy mine.                          Those eyes of thine,                          Wild eyes of thine,                What stars are like those eyes of thine?  As he concluded, the lattice softly opened; and a female form appeared on the balcony.  \"Ah, Leila!\" said the  Moor, \"I see thee, and I am blessed!\"  \"Hush!\" answered Leila; \"speak low, nor tarry long I fear that our interviews are suspected; and this,\" she added in a trembling voice, \"may perhaps be the last time we shall meet.\"  \"Holy Prophet!\" exclaimed Muza, passionately, \"what do I hear?  Why this mystery? why cannot I learn thine origin, thy rank, thy parents?  Think you, beautiful Leila, that Granada holds a rouse lofty enough to disdain the alliance with Muza Ben Abil Gazan? and oh!\" he added (sinking the haughty tones of his voice into accents of the softest tenderness), \"if not too high to scorn me, what should war against our loves and our bridals?  For worn equally on my heart were the flower of thy sweet self, whether the mountain top or the valley gave birth to the odour and the bloom.\"  \"Alas!\" answered Leila, weeping, \"the mystery thou complainest of is as dark to myself as thee.  How often have I told thee that I know nothing of my birth or childish fortunes, save a dim memory of a more distant and burning clime; where, amidst sands and wastes, springs the everlasting cedar, and the camel grazes on stunted herbage withering in the fiery air?  Then, it seemed to me that I had a mother: fond eyes looked on me, and soft songs hushed me into sleep.\"  \"Thy mother's soul has passed into mine,\" said the Moor, tenderly.  Leila continued:--\"Borne hither, I passed from childhood into youth within these walls.  Slaves ministered to my slightest wish; and those who have seen both state and poverty, which I have not, tell me that treasures and splendour, that might glad a monarch, are prodigalised around me: but of ties and kindred know I little: my father, a stern and silent man, visits me but rarely--sometimes months pass, and I see him not; but I feel he loves me; and, till I knew thee, Muza, my brightest hours were in listening to the footsteps and flying to the arms of that solitary friend.\"  \"Know you not his name?\"  \"Nor, I nor any one of the household; save perhaps Ximen, the chief of the slaves, an old and withered man, whose very eye chills me into fear and silence.\"  \"Strange!\" said the Moor, musingly; \"yet why think you our love is discovered, or can be thwarted?\"  \"Hush!  Ximen sought me this day: 'Maiden,' said he, 'men's footsteps have been tracked within the gardens; if your sire know this, you will have looked your last on Granada.  Learn,' he added, in a softer voice, as he saw me tremble, 'that permission were easier given to thee to wed the wild tiger than to mate with the loftiest noble of Morisca!  Beware!' He spoke, and left me.  O Muza!\" she continued, passionately wringing her hands, \"my heart sinks within me, and omen and doom rise dark before my sight!\"  \"By my father's head, these obstacles but fire my love, and I would scale to thy possession, though every step in the ladder were the corpses"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9757"],["title","Leila or, the Siege of Granada, Book II. (#1)"],["body","  \"But it is the promise of a king, a Christian, and a knight,\" said the king, with dignity rather mild than arrogant; \"among monarchs, what hostage can be more sacred?  Let this pass: how proceed affairs in the rebel city?\"  \"May this maiden withdraw, ere I answer my lord the king?\" said Almamen.  The young prince started to his feet.  \"Shall I conduct this new charge to my mother?\" he asked, in a low voice, addressing Ferdinand.  The king half smiled: \"The holy father were a better guide,\" he returned, in the same tone.  But, though the Dominican heard the hint, he retained his motionless posture; and Ferdinand, after a momentary gaze on the friar, turned away.  \"Be it so, Juan,\" said he, with a look meant to convey caution to the prince; \"Perez shall accompany you to the queen: return the moment your mission is fulfilled--we want your presence.\"  While this conversation was carried on between the father and son, the Hebrew was whispering, in his sacred tongue, words of comfort and remonstrance to the maiden; but they appeared to have but little of the desired effect; and, suddenly falling on his breast, she wound her arms around the Hebrew, whose breast shook with strong emotions, and exclaimed passionately, in the same language, \"Oh, my father!  what have I done?-- why send me from thee?--why intrust thy child to the stranger?  Spare me, spare me!\"  \"Child of my heart!\" returned the Hebrew, with solemn but tender accents, \"even as Abraham offered up his son, must I offer thee, upon the altars of our faith; but, O Leila!  even as the angel of the Lord forbade the offering, so shall thy youth be spared, and thy years reserved for the glory of generations yet unborn.  King of Spain!\" he continued in the Spanish tongue, suddenly and eagerly, \"you are a father, forgive my weakness, and speed this parting.\"  Juan approached; and with respectful courtesy attempted to take the hand of the maiden.  \"You?\" said the Israelite, with a dark frown.  \"O king! the prince is young.\"  \"Honour knoweth no distinction of age,\" answered the king.  \"What ho, Perez! accompany this maiden and the prince to the queen's pavilion.\"  The sight of the sober years and grave countenance of the attendant seemed to re-assure the Hebrew.  He strained Leila in his arms; printed a kiss upon her forehead without removing her veil; and then, placing her almost in the arms of Perez, turned away to the further end of the tent, and concealed his face with his hands.  The king appeared touched; but the Dominican gazed upon the whole scene with a sour scowl.  Leila still paused for a moment; and then, as if recovering her self- possession, said, aloud and distinctly,--\"Man deserts me; but I will not forget that God is over all.\"  Shaking off the hand of the Spaniard, she continued, \"Lead on; I follow thee!\" and left the tent with a steady and even majestic step.  \"And now,\" said the king, when alone with the Dominican and Almamen, \"how proceed our hopes?\"  \"Boabdil,\" replied the Israelite, \"is aroused against both his army and their leader, Muza; the king will not quit the Alhambra; and this morning, ere I left the city, Muza himself was in the prisons of the palace.\"  \"How!\" cried the king, starting from his seat.  \"This is my work,\" pursued the Hebrew.  coldly.  \"It is these hands that are shaping for Ferdinand of Spain the keys of Granada.\"  \"And right kingly shall be your guerdon,\" said the Spanish monarch: \"meanwhile, accept this earnest of our favour.\"  So saying, he took from his breast a chain of massive gold, the links of which were curiously inwrought with gems, and extended it to the Israelite.  Almamen moved not.  A dark flush upon his countenance bespoke the feelings he with difficulty restrained.  \"I sell not my foes for gold, great king,\" said he, with a stern smile: \"I sell my foes to buy the ransom of my friends.\"  \"Churlish!\" said Ferdinand, offended: \"but speak on, man, speak on!\"  \"If I place Granada, ere two weeks are past, within thy power, what shall be my reward?\"  \"Thou didst talk to me, when last we met, of immunities to the Jews.\"  The calm Dominican looked up as the king spoke, crossed himself, and resumed his attitude of humility.  \"I demand for the people of Israel,\" returned Almamen, \"free leave to trade and abide within the city, and follow their callings, subjected only to the same laws and the same imposts as the Christian population.\"  \"The same laws, and the same imposts!  Humph! there are difficulties in the concession.  If we refuse?\"  \"Our treaty is ended.  Give me back the maiden--you will have no further need of the hostage you demanded: I return to the city, and renew our interviews no more.\"  Politic and cold-blooded as was the temperament of the great Ferdinand, he had yet the imperious and haughty nature of a prosperous and long- descended king; and he bit his lip in deep displeasure at the tone of the dictatorial and stately stranger.  \"Thou usest plain language, my friend,\" said he; \"my words can be as rudely spoken.  Thou art in my power, and canst return not, save at my permission.\"  \"I have your royal word, sire, for free entrance and safe egress,\" answered Almamen.  \"Break it, and Granada is with the Moors till the Darro runs red with the blood of her heroes, and her people strew the vales as the leaves in autumn.\"  \"Art thou then thyself of the Jewish faith?\" asked the king.  \"If thou art not, wherefore are the outcasts of the world so dear to thee?\"  \"My fathers were of that creed, royal Ferdinand; and if I myself desert their creed, I do not desert their cause.  O king!  are my terms scorned or accepted?\"  \"I accept them: provided, first, that thou obtainest the exile or death of Muza; secondly, that within two weeks of this date thou bringest me, along with the chief councillors of Granada, the written treaty of the capitulation, and the keys of the city.  Do this: and though the sole king in Christendom who dares the hazard, I offer to the Israelites throughout Andalusia the common laws and rights of citizens of Spain; and to thee I will accord such dignity as may content thy ambition.\"  The Hebrew bowed reverently, and drew from his breast a scroll, which he placed on the table before the king.  \"This writing, mighty Ferdinand, contains the articles of our compact.\"  \"How, knave! wouldst thou have us commit our royal signature to conditions with such as thou art, to the chance of the public eye?  The king's word is the king's bond!\"  The Hebrew took up the scroll with imperturbable composure, \"My child!\" said he; \"will your majesty summon back my child?  we would depart.\"  \"A sturdy mendicant this, by the Virgin!\" muttered the king; and then, speaking aloud, \"Give me the paper, I will scan it.\"  Running his eyes hastily over the words, Ferdinand paused a moment, and then drew towards him the implements of writing, signed the scroll, and returned it to Almamen.  The Israelite kissed it thrice with oriental veneration, and replaced it in his breast.  Ferdinand looked at him hard and curiously.  He was a profound reader of men's characters; but that of his guest baffled and perplexed him.  \"And how, stranger,\" said he, gravely,--\"how can I trust that man who thus distrusts one king and sells another?\"  \"O king!\" replied Almamen (accustomed from his youth to commune with and command the possessors of thrones yet more absolute),--\"O king! if thou believest me actuated by personal and selfish interests in this our compact, thou has but to make, my service minister to my interest, and the lore of human nature will tell thee that thou hast won a ready and submissive slave.  But if thou thinkest I have avowed sentiments less abject, and developed qualities higher than those of the mere bargainer for sordid power, oughtest thou not to rejoice that chance has thrown into thy way one whose intellect and faculties may be made thy tool?  If I betray another, that other is my deadly foe.  Dost not thou, the lord of armies, betray thine enemy?  The Moor is an enemy bitterer to myself than to thee.  Because I betray an enemy, am I unworthy to serve a friend?  If I, a single man, and a stranger to the Moor, can yet command the secrets of palaces, and render vain the counsels of armed men, have I not in that attested that I am one of whom a wise king can make an able servant?\"  \"Thou art a subtle reasoner, my friend,\" said Ferdinand, smiling gently. \"Peace go with thee!  our conference for the time is ended.  What ho, Perez!\"  The attendant appeared.  \"Thou hast left the maiden with the queen?\"  \"Sire, you have been obeyed.\"  \"Conduct this stranger to the guard who led him through the camp.  He quits us under the same protection.  Farewell!  yet stay--thou art assured that Muza Ben Abil Gazan is in the prisons of the Moor?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Blessed be the Virgin!\"  \"Thou hast heard our conference, Father Tomas?\" said the king, anxiously, when the Hebrew had withdrawn.  \"I have, son.\"  \"Did thy veins freeze with horror?\"  \"Only when my son signed the scroll.  It seemed to me then that I saw the cloven foot of the tempter.\"  \"Tush, father, the tempter would have been more wise than to reckon upon a faith which no ink and no parchment can render valid, if the Church absolve the compact.  Thou understandest me, father?\"  \"I do.  I know your pious heart and well-judging mind.\"  \"Thou wert right,\" resumed the king, musingly, \"when thou didst tell us that these caitiff Jews were waxing strong in the fatness of their substance.  They would have equal laws--the insolent blasphemers!\"  \"Son!\" said the Dominican, with earnest adjuration, \"God, who has prospered your arms and councils, will require at your hands an account of the power intrusted to you.  Shall there be no difference between His friends and His foes--His disciples and His crucifiers?\"  \"Priest,\" said the king, laying his hand on the monk's shoulder, and with a saturnine smile upon his countenance, \"were religion silent in this matter, policy has a voice loud"]]]
