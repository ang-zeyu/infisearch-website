So, also, a mode of extension and the idea  of that mode are one and the same thing, though expressed in two ways.  This truth seems  to have been dimly recognized by those Jews who maintained that God, God's intellect,  and the things understood by God are identical.  For instance, a circle existing in nature,  and the idea of a circle existing, which is also in God, are one and the same thing displayed  through different attributes.  Thus, whether we conceive nature under the attribute of  extension, or under the attribute of thought, or under any other attribute, we shall find the  same order, or one and the same chain of causes--that is, the same things following in  either case.  I said that God is the cause of an idea--for instance, of the idea of a circle,--in so far as he  is a thinking thing; and of a circle, in so far as he is an extended thing, simply because the actual being of the idea of a circle can only be perceived as a proximate cause through  another mode of thinking, and that again through another, and so on to infinity; so that, so  long as we consider things as modes of thinking, we must explain the order of the whole of  nature, or the whole chain of causes, through the attribute of thought only.  And, in so far  as we consider things as modes of extension, we must explain the order of the whole of  nature through the attributes of extension only; and so on, in the case of the other  attributes.  Wherefore of things as they are in themselves God is really the cause, inasmuch  as he consists of infinite attributes.  I cannot for the present explain my meaning more  clearly.  VIII.  The ideas of particular things, or of modes, that do not exist, must be comprehended  in the infinite idea of God, in the same way as the formal essences of particular things or  modes are contained in the attributes of God.  >>>>>Proof--This proposition is evident from the last; it is understood more clearly from  the preceding note.  <<<<<Corollary--Hence, so long as particular things do not exist, except in so far as they  are comprehended in the attributes of God, their representations in thought or ideas do not  exist, except in so far as the infinite idea of God exists; and when the particular things are  said to exist, not only in so far as they are involved in the attributes of God, but also in so  far as they are said to continue, their ideas will also involve existence, through which they  are said to continue.  *****Note--If anyone desires an example to throw more light on this question, I shall, I  fear, not be able to give him any, which adequately explains the thing of which I here  speak, inasmuch as it is unique; however, I will endeavour to illustrate it as far as possible.   The nature of a circle is such that if any number of straight lines intersect within it, the  rectangles formed by their segments will be equal to one another; thus, infinite equal  rectangles are contained in a circle.  Yet none of these rectangles can be said to exist, except in so far as the circle exists; nor can the idea of any of these rectangles be said to  exist, except in so far as they are comprehended in the idea of the circle.  Let us grant that, from this infinite number of rectangles, two only exist.  The ideas of these two not only  exist, in so far as they are contained in the idea of the circle, but also as they involve the  existence of those rectangles; wherefore they are distinguished from the remaining ideas of  the remaining rectangles.  IX.  The idea of an individual thing actually existing is caused by God, not in so far as he  is infinite, but in so far as he is considered as affected by another idea of a thing actually existing, of which he is the cause, in so far as he is affected by a third idea, and so on to  infinity.  >>>>>Proof--The idea of an individual thing actually existing is an individual mode of  thinking, and is distinct from other modes (by the Cor. and Note to Prop. viii. of this part);  thus (by Prop. vi. of this part) it is caused by God, in so far only as he is a thinking thing.   But not (by Prop. xxviii. of Part i.) in so far as he is a thing thinking absolutely, only in so  far as he is considered as affected by another mode of thinking; and he is the cause of this  latter, as being affected by a third, and so on to infinity.  Now, the order and connection  of ideas is (by Prop. vii. of this book) the same as the order and connection of causes.   Therefore of a given individual idea another individual idea, or God, in so far as he is  considered as modified by that idea, is the cause; and of this second idea God is the  cause, in so far as he is affected by another idea, and so on to infinity.  Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--Whatsoever takes place in the individual object of any idea, the  knowledge thereof is in God, in so far only as he has the idea of the object.  >>>>>Proof--Whatsoever takes place in the object of any idea, its idea is in God (by  Prop. iii. of this part), not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as he is considered as  affected by another idea of an individual thing (by the last Prop.); but (by Prop. vii. of  this part) the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of  things.  The knowledge, therefore, of that which takes place in any individual object will  be in God, in so far only as he has the idea of that object.  Q.E.D.  X.  The being of substance does not appertain to the essence of man--in other words,  substance does not constitute the actual being (forma) of man.  >>>>>Proof--The being of substance involves necessary existence (Part i., Prop. vii.).   If, therefore, the being of substance appertains to the essence of man, substance being  granted, man would necessarily be granted also (II. Def. ii.), and, consequently, man would  necessarily exist, which is absurd (II. Ax. i.).  Therefore &c.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--This proposition may also be proved from I.v., in which it is shown that there  cannot be two substances of the same nature; for as there may be many men, the being of substance is not that which constitutes the actual being of man. Again, the proposition is  evident from the other properties of substance--namely, that substance is in its nature  infinite, immutable, indivisible, &c., as anyone may see for himself.  <<<<<Corollary--Hence it follows, that the essence of man is constituted by certain  modifications of the attributes of God. For (by the last Prop.) the being of substance does  not belong to the essence of man.  That essence therefore (by I. xv.) is something which is  in God, and which without God can neither be nor be conceived, whether it be a  modification (I. xxv. Cor.), or a mode which expresses God's nature in a certain  conditioned manner.  *****Note--Everyone must surely admit, that nothing can be or be conceived without  God.  All men agree that God is the one and only cause of all things, both of their essence  and of their existence; that is, God is not only the cause of things in respect to their being  made (secundum fieri), but also in respect to their being (secundum esse).  At the same time many assert, that that, without which a thing cannot be nor be conceived,  belongs to the essence of that thing; wherefore they believe that either the nature of God appertains to the essence of created things, or else that created things can be or be  conceived without God; or else, as is more probably the case, they hold inconsistent  doctrines.  I think the cause for such confusion is mainly, that they do not keep to the  proper order of philosophic thinking.  The nature of God, which should be reflected on  first, inasmuch as it is prior both in the order of knowledge and the order of nature, they  have taken to be last in the order of knowledge, and have put into the first place what they  call the objects of sensation; hence, while they are considering natural phenomena, they  give no attention at all to the divine nature, and, when afterwards they apply their mind to  the study of the divine nature, they are quite unable to bear in mind the first hypotheses,  with which they have overlaid the knowledge of natural phenomena, inasmuch as such  hypotheses are no help towards understanding the divine nature.  So that it is hardly to be  wondered at, that these persons contradict themselves freely.  However, I pass over this point.  My intention her was only to give a reason for not saying,  that that, without which a thing cannot be or be conceived, belongs to the essence of that  thing: individual things cannot be or be conceived without God, yet God does not  appertain to their essence.  I said that \"I considered as belonging to the essence of a thing  that, which being given, the thing is necessarily given also, and which being removed, the thing is necessarily removed also; or that without which the thing, and which itself without  the thing can neither be nor be conceived.\"  (II. Def. ii.)  XI.  The first element, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is the idea of  some particular thing actually existing.  >>>>>Proof--The essence of man (by the Cor. of the last Prop.) is constituted by certain  modes of the attributes of God, namely (by II. Ax. ii.), by the modes of thinking, of all  which (by II. Ax. iii.) the idea is prior in nature, and, when the idea is given, the other  modes (namely, those of which the idea is prior in nature) must be in the same individual  (by the same Axiom). Therefore an idea is the first element constituting the human mind.   But not the idea of a non-existent thing, for then (II. viii. Cor.) the idea itself cannot be  said to exist; it must therefore be the idea of something actually existing.  But not of an  infinite thing.  For an infinite thing (I. xxi., xxii.), must always"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/920"],["title","Ethics — Part 2 (#2)"],["body","exist; this would  (by II. Ax. i.) involve an absurdity.  Therefore the first element, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is the idea of something actually existing.  Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--Hence it follows, that the human mind is part of the infinite intellect of  God; thus when we say, that the human mind perceives this or that, we make the assertion,  that God has this or that idea, not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as he is displayed  through the nature of the human mind, or in so far as he constitutes the essence of the  human mind; and when we say that God has this or that idea, not only in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind, but also in so far as he, simultaneously with the  human mind, has the further idea of another thing, we assert that the human mind  perceives a thing in part or inadequately.  *****Note--Here, I doubt not, readers will come to a stand, and will call to mind many  things which will cause them to hesitate; I therefore beg them to accompany me slowly,  step by step, and not to pronounce on my statements, till they have read to the end.  XII.  Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of the idea, which constitutes the human  mind, must be perceived by the human mind, or there will necessarily be an idea in the  human mind of the said occurrence.  That is, if the object of the idea constituting the  human mind be a body, nothing can take place in that body without being perceived by  the mind.  >>>>>Proof--Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of any idea, the knowledge  thereof is necessarily in God (II. ix. Cor.), in so far as he is considered as affected by  the idea of the said object, that is (II. xi.), in so far as he constitutes the mind of anything.   Therefore, whatsoever takes place in the object constituting the idea of the human mind,  the knowledge thereof is necessarily in God, in so far as he constitutes the essence of the  human mind; that is (by II. xi. Cor.) the knowledge of the said thing will necessarily be  in the mind, in other words the mind perceives it.  *****Note--This proposition is also evident, and is more clearly to be understood from  II. vii., which see.  XIII.  The object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body, in other words a  certain mode of extension which actually exists, and nothing else.  >>>>>Proof--If indeed the body were not the object of the human mind, the ideas of the  modifications of the body would not be in God (II. ix. Cor.) in virtue of his constituting  our mind, but in virtue of his constituting the mind of something else; that is (II. xi. Cor.)  the ideas of the modifications of the body would not be in our mind:  now (by II. Ax. iv.)  we do possess the idea of the modifications of the body.  Therefore the object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body, and the body as it actually exists (II. xi.).   Further, if there were any other object of the idea constituting the mind besides body,  then, as nothing can exist from which some effect does not follow (I. xxxvi.) there would  necessarily have to be in our mind an idea, which would be the effect of that other object  (II. xi.); but (I. Ax. v.) there is no such idea.  Wherefore the object of our mind is the body  as it exists, and nothing else.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--We thus comprehend, not only that the human mind is united to the body,  but also the nature of the union between mind and body.  However, no one will be able  to grasp this adequately or distinctly, unless he first has adequate knowledge of the nature  of our body.  The propositions we have advanced hitherto have been entirely general,  applying not more to men than to other individual things, all of which, though in different  degrees, are animated (animata).  For of everything there is necessarily an idea in God, of  which God is the cause, in the same way as there is an idea of the human body; thus whatever we have asserted of the idea of the human body must necessarily also be asserted  of the idea of everything else. Still, on the other hand, we cannot deny that ideas, like objects, differ one from the other, one being more excellent than another and containing  more reality, just as the object of one idea is more excellent than the object of another idea,  and contains more reality.  Wherefore, in order to determine, wherein the human mind differs from other things, and  wherein it surpasses them, it is necessary for us to know the nature of its object, that is,  of the human body.  What this nature is, I am not able here to explain, nor is it necessary  for the proof of what I advance, that I should do so.  I will only say generally, that in proportion as any given body is more fitted than others for doing many actions or receiving  many impressions at once, so also is the mind, of which it is the object, more fitted than  others for forming many simultaneous perceptions; and the more the actions of the body  depend on itself alone, and the fewer other bodies concur with it in action, the more fitted  is the mind of which it is the object for distinct comprehension.  We may thus recognize  the superiority of one mind over others, and may further see the cause, why we have only a  very confused knowledge of our body, and also many kindred questions, which I will, in  the following propositions, deduce from what has been advanced.  Wherefore I have  thought it worth while to explain and prove more strictly my present statements.  In order  to do so, I must premise a few propositions concerning the nature of bodies.  ---Axiom I.  All bodies are either in motion or at rest.  ---Axiom II.  Every body is moved sometimes more slowly, sometimes more quickly.  Lemma I.  Bodies are distinguished from one another in respect of motion and rest,  quickness and slowness, and not in respect of substance.  >>>>>Proof--The first part of this proposition is, I take it, self-evident.  That bodies are  not distinguished in respect of substance, is plain both from I. v. and I. viii.  It is brought out still more clearly from I. xv., Note.  Lemma II.  All bodies agree in certain respects.  >>>>>Proof--All bodies agree in the fact, that they involve the conception of one and the  same attribute (II., Def. i.). Further, in the fact that they may be moved less or more quickly, and may be absolutely in motion or at rest.  Lemma III.  A body in motion or at rest must be determined to motion or rest by another  body, which other body has been determined to motion or rest by a third body, and that  third again by a fourth, and so on to infinity.  >>>>>Proof--Bodies are individual things (II., Def. i.), which (Lemma i.) are distinguished  one from the other in respect to motion and rest; thus (I. xxviii.) each must necessarily be determined to motion or rest by another individual thing, namely (II. vi.) by another body,  which other body is also (Ax. i.) in motion or at rest.  And this body again can only have  been set in motion or caused to rest by being determined by a third body to motion or rest.   This third body again by a fourth, and so on to infinity.  Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--Hence it follows, that a body in motion keeps in motion, until it is  determined to a state of rest by some other body; and a body at rest remains so, until it is  determined to a state of motion by some other body.  This is indeed self-evident. For  when I suppose, for instance, that a given body, A, is at rest, and do not take into  consideration other bodies in motion, I cannot affirm anything concerning the body A,  except that it is at rest.  If it afterwards comes to pass that A is in motion, this cannot have  resulted from its having been at rest, for no other consequence could have been involved  than its remaining at rest.  If, on the other hand, A be given in motion, we shall, so long as  we only consider A, be unable to affirm anything concerning it, except that it is in motion.   If A is subsequently found to be at rest, this rest cannot be the result of A's previous  motion, for such motion can only have led to continued motion; the state of rest therefore  must have resulted from something, which was not in A, namely, from an external cause  determining A to a state of rest.  -----Axiom I--All modes, wherein one body is affected by another body, follow  simultaneously from the nature of the body affected and the body affecting; so that one  and the same body may be moved in different modes, according to the difference in the  nature of the bodies moving it; on the other hand, different bodies may be moved in  different modes by one and the same body.  -----Axiom II--When a body in motion impinges on another body at rest, which it is  unable to move, it recoils, in order to continue its motion, and the angle made by the line  of motion in the recoil and the plane of the body at rest, whereon the moving body has  impinged, will be equal to the angle formed by the line of motion of incidence and the  same plane.  So far we have been speaking only of the most simple bodies, which are only distinguished  one from the other by motion and rest, quickness and slowness.  We now pass on to  compound bodies.  Definition--When any given bodies of the same or different magnitude are compelled by  other bodies to remain in contact, or if they be moved at the same or different rates of  speed, so that their mutual movements should preserve among themselves a certain fixed  relation, we say that such bodies are 'in union,' and that together they compose one body  or individual, which is distinguished from other bodies by the fact of this union.  -----Axiom III--In proportion as the parts of an individual, or a compound body, are in  contact over a greater or less superficies, they will with greater or less difficulty admit of being moved from their position; consequently the individual will, with greater or less  difficulty, be brought to assume another form.  Those bodies, whose"]]]
