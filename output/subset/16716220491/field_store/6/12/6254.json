One night the bells of the three churches had been rung simultaneously and violently, and the idea that either the town was in flames, or that the French had landed, or that the whole country was up in arms, brought all the inhabitants to their doors in a state of violent excitement and scanty attire. No clew was ever obtained as to the author of this outrage, nor was anyone able to discover the origin of the rumour that circulated through the town, that a large amount of gunpowder had been stored in some house or other in the market-place, and that on a certain night half the town would be blown into the air.  So circumstantial were the details that a deputation waited on Colonel Corcoran, and a strong search-party was sent down to examine the cellars of all the houses in the market-place and for some distance round. These and some similar occurrences had much alarmed the good people of Athlone, and it was certain that more than one person must have been concerned in them.  \"I have come, Colonel,\" Captain O'Connor said, when he called upon his commanding officer, \"to speak to you about Terence.\"  The colonel smiled grimly. \"It is a comfort to think that we are going to get rid of him, O'Connor; he is enough to demoralize a whole brigade, to say nothing of a battalion, and the worst of it is he respects no one. I am as convinced as can be that it was he who fastened that baste of a bird in my shako the other day, and made me the laughing stock of the whole regiment on parade. Faith, I could not for the life of me make out what was the matter, there was a tugging and a jumping and a fluttering overhead, and I thought the shako was going to fly away. It fairly gave me a scare, for I thought the shako had gone mad, and that the divil was in it. I have often overlooked his tricks for your sake, but when it comes to his commanding officer, it is too serious altogether.\"  \"Well, you see, Colonel, the lad proved clearly enough that he was out of the way at the time; and besides, you know he has given you many a hearty laugh.\"  \"He has that,\" the colonel admitted.  \"And, moreover,\" Captain O'Connor went on, \"even if he did do this, which I don't know, for I never asked him\" (\"Trust you for that,\" the colonel muttered), \"you are not his commanding officer, though you are mine, and that is the matter that I came to speak to you about. You see there is no one in whose charge I can leave him, and the lad wants to go with us; he would enlist as a drummer, if he could go no other way, and when he got out there I should get the adjutant to tell him off as my soldier servant.\"  \"It would not do, O'Connor,\" the colonel laughed.  \"Then I thought, Colonel, that possibly he might go as a volunteer--most regiments take out one or two young fellows, who have not interest enough to obtain a commission.\"  \"He is too young, O'Connor; besides, the boy is enough to corrupt a whole regiment; he has made half the lads as wild as he is himself. Sure you can never be after asking me to saddle the regiment with him, now that there is a good chance of getting quit of him altogether.\"  \"I think that he would not be so bad when we are out there, Colonel; it is just because he has nothing to do that he gets into mischief. With plenty of hard work and other things to think of I don't believe that he would be any trouble.\"  \"Do you think that you can answer for him, O'Connor?\"  \"Indeed and I cannot,\" the captain laughed; \"but I will answer for it that he will not joke with you, Colonel. The lad is really steady enough, and I am sure that if he were in the regiment he would not dream of playing tricks with his commanding officer, whatever else he might do.\"  \"That goes a long way towards removing my objection,\" the colonel said, with a twinkle in his eye; \"but he is too young for a volunteer--a volunteer is the sort of man to be the first to climb a breach, or to risk his life in some desperate enterprise, so as to win a commission. But there is another way. I had a letter yesterday from the Horse Guards, saying that as I am two ensigns short, they had appointed one who will join us at Cork, and that they gave me the right of nominating another. I own that Terence occurred to me, but sixteen is the youngest limit of age, and he must be certified and all that by the doctor. Now Daly is away on leave, and is to join us at Cork; but O'Flaherty would do; still, I don't know how he would get over the difficulty about the age.\"  \"Trust him for that. I am indeed obliged to you, Colonel.\"  \"Don't say anything about it, O'Connor; if we had been going to stay at home I don't think that I could have brought myself to take him into the regiment, but as we are going on service he won't have much opportunity for mischief, and even if he does let out a little--not at my expense, you know--a laugh does the men good when they are wet through and their stomachs are empty.\" He rang a bell. \"Orderly, tell the adjutant and Doctor O'Flaherty that I wish to see them. Mr. Cleary,\" he went on, as soon as the former entered, \"I have been requested by the Horse Guards to nominate an ensign, so as to fill up our ranks before starting, and I have determined to give the appointment to Terence O'Connor.\"  \"Very well, sir, I am glad to hear it; he is a favourite with us all, but I am afraid that he is under age.\"  \"Is there any regular form to be filled up?\"  \"None that I know of in the case of officers, sir. I fancy they pass some sort of medical examination at the Horse Guards, but, of course, in this case it would be impossible. Still, I should say that, in writing to state that you have nominated him, it would be better to send a medical certificate, and certainly it ought to be mentioned that he is of the right age.\"  At this moment the assistant-surgeon entered. \"Doctor O'Flaherty,\" the colonel said, \"I wish you to write a certificate to the effect that Terence O'Connor is physically fit to take part in a campaign as an officer.\"  \"I can do that, Colonel, without difficulty; he is as fit as a fiddle, and can march half the regiment off their legs.\"  \"Yes, I know that, but there is one difficulty, Doctor, he is under the regulation age.\"  O'Flaherty thought for a moment and then sat down at the table, and taking a sheet of paper, be began:  _I certify that Terence O' Connor is going on for seventeen years of age, he is five feet eight in height, thirty-four inches round the chest, is active, and fully capable of the performance of his duties as an officer either at home or abroad._  Then he added another line and signed his name.  \"As a member of a learned profession, Colonel,\" he said, gravely, \"I would scorn to tell a lie even for the son of Captain O'Connor;\" and he passed the paper across to him.  The colonel looked grave, and Captain O'Connor disappointed. He was reassured, however, when his commanding officer broke into a laugh.  \"That will do well, O'Flaherty,\" he said; \"I thought that you would find some way of getting us out of the difficulty.\"  \"I have told the strict truth, Colonel,\" the doctor said, gravely. \"I have certified that Terence O'Connor is going on for seventeen; I defy any man to say that he is not. He will get there one of these days, if a French bullet does not stop him on the way, a contingency that it is needless for me to mention.\"  \"I suppose that it is not strictly regular to omit the date of his birth,\" the colonel said; \"but just at present I expect they are not very particular. I suppose that that will do, Mr. Cleary?\"  \"I think that you can countersign that, Colonel,\" the adjutant said, with a laugh. \"The Horse Guards do not move very rapidly, and by the time that letter gets to London we may be on board ship, and they would hardly bother to send a letter for further particulars to us in Spain, but will no doubt gazette him at once. The fact, too--which of course you will mention--that he is the son of the senior captain of your regiment, will in itself render them less likely to bother about the matter.\"  \"Well, just write out the letter of nomination, Cleary; I am a mighty bad hand at doing things neatly.\"  The adjutant drew a sheet of foolscap to him and wrote:--  _To the Adjutant-general, Horse Guards,_  _Sir, I have the honour to inform you that, in accordance with the privilege granted to me in your communication of--_  and he looked at the colonel.  \"The 14th inst.,\" the latter said, after consulting the letter.  _--I beg to nominate as an ensign in this regiment, Terence O' Connor, the son of Captain Lawrence O' Connor, its senior captain. I inclose certificate of Assistant-surgeon O' Flaherty,--the surgeon being at present absent on leave--certifying to his physical fitness for a commission in his Majesty's service. Mr. O' Connor having been brought up from childhood in the regiment is already perfectly acquainted with the work, and will therefore be able to take up his duties without difficulty. This fact has had some influence in my choice, as a young officer who had to be taught all his duties would have been of no use for service in the field for a considerable time after landing in Portugal. Relying on the nomination being approved by the commander-in-chief, I shall at once put him on the staff of the regiment for foreign service, as there will be no time to wait your reply._  _I have the honour to be_  _Your humble, obedient servant,_  Then he left a space, and added:  _Colonel Mayo Fusiliers._  \"Now, if you will sign it, Colonel, the matter will be complete, and I will send it off with O'Flaherty's certificate today.\"  \"That is a good stroke, Cleary,\" the colonel said, as he read it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8651"],["title","With Moore at Corunna (#2)"],["body","oud. \"They will see that it is too late to raise any questions, and the 'going on for seventeen' will be accepted as sufficient.\"  He touched a bell.  \"Orderly, tell Mr. Terence O'Connor that I wish to see him.\"  Terence was sitting in a state of suppressed excitement at his father's quarters. He had a strong belief that the matter would be managed somehow, for he knew that the colonel had no malice in his disposition, and would not let the episode of the bird--for which he was now heartily sorry--stand in the way. On receiving the message he at once went across to the colonel's quarters. The latter rose and held out his hand to him as he entered.  \"Terence O'Connor,\" he said, \"I am pleased to be able to inform you that from the present moment you are to consider yourself an officer in his Majesty's Mayo Fusiliers. The Horse Guards have given me the privilege of nominating a gentleman to the vacant ensigncy, and I have had great pleasure in nominating your father's son. Now, lad,\" he said, in different tone of voice, \"I feel sure that you will do credit my nomination, and that you will keep your love of fun and mischief within reasonable bounds.\"  \"I will try to do so, Colonel,\" the lad said, in a low voice, \"and I am grateful indeed for the kindness that you have shown me. I have always hoped that some day I might obtain a commission in your regiment, but never even hoped that it would be until after I had done something to deserve it. Indeed I did not think that it was even possible that I could obtain a commission until----\"  \"Tut, tut, lad, don't say a word about age! Doctor O'Flaherty had certified that you are going on for seventeen, which is quite sufficient for me, and at any rate you will see that boyish tricks are out of place in the case of an officer going on for seventeen. Now, your father had best take you down into the town and get you measured for your uniforms at once. You must make them hurry on with his undress clothes, O'Connor. I should not bother about full-dress till we get back again; it is not likely to be wanted, and the lad will soon grow out of them. If there should happen to be full-dress parade in Portugal, Cleary will put him on as officer of the day, or give him some duties that will keep him from parade. We may get the route any day, and the sooner he gets his uniform the better.\"  Two days later Terence took his place on parade as an officer of the regiment. He had witnessed such numberless drills that he had picked up every word of command, knew his proper place in every formation, and fell into the work as readily as if he had been at it for years. He had been heartily congratulated by the officers of the regiment.  \"I am awfully glad that you are one of us, Terence,\" Dick Ryan said. \"I don't know what we should have done without you. I expect we shall have tremendous fun in Portugal.\"  \"I expect we shall, Dick; but we shall have to be careful. We shall be on active service, you see, and from what they say of him I don't think Sir Arthur Wellesley is the sort of man to appreciate jokes.\"  \"No, I should say not. Of course, we shall have to draw in a bit. It would not do to set the bells of Lisbon ringing.\"  \"I should think not, Dick. Still, I dare say we shall have plenty of fun, and at any rate we are likely, from what they say, to have plenty of fighting. I don't expect the Portuguese will be much good, and as there are forty or fifty thousand Frenchmen in Portugal, we shall have all our work to do, unless they send out a much bigger force than is collecting at Cork. It is a pity that the 10,000 men who have been sent out to Sweden on what my father says is a fool's errand are not going with us instead. We might make a good stand-up fight of it then, whereas I don't see that with only 6,000 or 7,000 we can do much good against Junot's 40,000.\"  \"Oh, I dare say we shall get on somehow!\" Dick said, carelessly. \"Sir Arthur knows what he is about, and it is our turn to do something now. The navy has had it all its own way so far, and it is quite fair that we should do our share. I have a brother in the navy, and the fellows are getting too cheeky altogether. They seem to think that no one can fight but themselves. Except in Egypt we have never had a chance at all of showing we can lick the French just as easily on land as we can at sea.\"  \"I hope we shall, Dick. They have certainly had a great deal more practice at it than we have.\"  \"Now I think we ought to do something here that they will remember us for before we start, Terence.\"  \"Well, if you do, I am not with you this time, Dick. I am not going to begin by getting in the colonel's bad books after he has been kind enough to nominate me for a commission. I promised him that I would try and not get into any scrapes, and I am not going to break my word. When we once get out there I shall be game to join in anything that is not likely to make a great row, but I have done with it for the present.\"  \"I should like to have one more good bit of fun,\" Ryan said; \"but I expect you are right, Terence, in what you say about yourself, and it is no use our thinking to humbug Athlone again if you are not in it with us; besides, they are getting too sharp. They did not half turn out last time, and, indeed, we had a narrow escape of being caught. Well, I shall be very glad when we are off; it is stupid work waiting for the route, with all leave stopped, and we not even allowed to go out for a day's fishing.\"  Three days later the expected order arrived. As the baggage had all been packed up, that which was to be left behind being handed over to the care of the barrack-master, and a considerable portion of the heavy baggage sent on by cart, there was no delay. Officers and men were alike delighted that the period of waiting had come to an end, and there was loud cheering in the barrack-yard as soon as the news came. At daybreak next morning the rest of the baggage started under a guard, and three hours later the Mayo Fusiliers marched through the town with their band playing at their head, and amid the cheers of the populace.  As yet the martial spirit that was roused by the struggle in the Peninsula had scarcely begun to show itself, but there was a strong animosity to France throughout England, and a desire to aid the people of Spain and Portugal in their efforts for freedom. In Ireland, for the most part, there was no such feeling. Since the battle of the Boyne and the siege of Limerick, France had been regarded by the greater portion of the peasantry, and a section of the population of the towns, as the  natural ally of Ireland, and there was a hope that when Napoleon had all Europe prostrate under his feet he would come as the deliverer of Ireland from the English yoke. Consequently, although the townspeople of Athlone cheered the regiment as it marched away, the country people held aloof from it as it passed along the road. Scowling looks from the women greeted it in the villages, while the men ostentatiously continued their work in the fields without turning to cast a glance at them.  Terence was not posted to his father's company, but was in that of Captain O'Driscol, although the lad himself would have preferred to be with Captain O'Grady, with whom he was a great favourite. The latter was one of the captains whose companies were unprovided with an ensign, and he had asked the adjutant to let him have the lad instead of the ensign who was to join at Cork.  \"The matter has been settled the other way, O'Grady; in the colonel's opinion he will be much better with O'Driscol, who is more likely to keep him in order than you are.\"  O'Grady was one of the most original characters in the regiment. He was rather under middle height, and had a smooth face, a guileless and innocent expression, and a habit of opening his light-blue eyes as in wonder. His hair was short, and stuck up aggressively; his brogue was the strongest in the regiment; his blunders were innumerable, and his look of amazement at the laughter they called forth was admirably feigned, save that the twinkle of his eye induced a suspicion that he himself enjoyed the joke as well as anyone. His good-humour was imperturbable, and he was immensely popular both among men and officers.  \"O'Driscol!\" he repeated, in mild astonishment. \"Do you mean to say that O'Driscol will keep him in better order than meself? If there is one man in this regiment more than another who would get on well with the lad it is meself, barring none.\"  \"You would get on well enough with him, O'Grady, I have no doubt, but it would be by letting him have his own way, and in encouraging him in mischief of all kinds.\"  O'Grady's eyebrows were elevated, and his eyes expressed hopeless bewilderment.  \"You are wrong entirely, Cleary; nature intended me for a schoolmaster, and it is just an accident that I have taken to soldiering. I flatter meself that no one looks after his subalterns more sharply than I do. My only fear is that I am too severe with them. I may be mild in my manners, but they know me well enough to tremble if I speak sternly to them.\"  \"The trembling would be with amusement,\" the adjutant grumbled. \"Well, the colonel has settled the matter, and Terence will be in Orders to-morrow as appointed to O'Driscol's company, and the other to yours.\"  \"Thank you for nothing, Cleary,\" O'Grady said, with dignity. \"You would have seen that under my tuition the lad would have turned out one of the smartest officers in the regiment.\"  \"You have heard of the Spartan way of teaching their sons to avoid drunkenness, Captain O'Grady?\"  \"Divil a word, Cleary; but I reckon that the best way with the haythens was to keep them from touching whisky. It is what I always recommend to the men of my company when I come across one of them the worse for liquor.\"  The adjutant laughed. \"That was not the Spartan way, O'Grady; but the advice, if taken, would doubtless have the same effect.\"  \"And who were the Spartans at all?\""]]]
