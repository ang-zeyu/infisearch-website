For as sleep to the young, is the bath to the old.\"  Hilda shook her head.  \"Bringer of sleep am I, and the baths I prepare are in the halls of Valhalla.  Offer not to the Vala the bath for mortal weariness, and the wine and the food meet for human guests.  Sit thee down, daughter of the Dane, and thank thy new gods for the past that hath been thine. Not ours is the present, and the future escapes from our dreams; but the past is ours ever, and all eternity cannot revoke a single joy that the moment hath known.\"  Then seating herself in Godwin's large chair, she leant over her seid- staff, and was silent, as if absorbed in her thoughts.  \"Githa,\" she said at last, \"where is thy lord?  I came to touch his hands and to look on his brow.\"  \"He hath gone forth into the mart, and my sons are from home; and Harold comes hither, ere night, from his earldom.\"  A faint smile, as of triumph, broke over the lips of the Vala, and then as suddenly yielded to an expression of great sadness.  \"Githa,\" she said, slowly, \"doubtless thou rememberest in thy young days to have seen or heard of the terrible hell-maid Belsta?\"  \"Ay, ay,\" answered Githa shuddering; \"I saw her once in gloomy weather, driving before her herds of dark grey cattle.  Ay, ay; and my father beheld her ere his death, riding the air on a wolf, with a snake for a bridle.  Why askest thou?\"  \"Is it not strange,\" said Hilda, evading the question, that Belsta, and Heidr, and Hulla of old, the wolf-riders, the men-devourers, could win to the uttermost secrets of galdra, though applied only to purposes the direst and fellest to man, and that I, though ever in the future,--I, though tasking the Nornas not to afflict a foe, but to shape the careers of those I love,--I find, indeed, my predictions fulfilled; but how often, alas! only in horror and doom!\"  \"How so, kinswoman, how so?\" said Githa, awed yet charmed in the awe, and drawing her chair nearer to the mournful sorceress.  \"Didst thou not fortell our return in triumph from the unjust outlawry, and, lo, it hath come to pass? and hast thou not\" (here Githa's proud face flushed) \"foretold also that my stately Harold shall wear the diadem of a king?\"  \"Truly, the first came to pass,\" said Hilda; \"but----\" she paused, and her eye fell on the cyst; then breaking off she continued, speaking to herself rather than to Githa--\"And Harold's dream, what did that portend? the runes fail me, and the dead give no voice.  And beyond one dim day, in which his betrothed shall clasp him with the arms of a bride, all is dark to my vision--dark--dark.  Speak not to me, Githa; for a burthen, heavy as the stone on a grave, rests on a weary heart!\"  A dead silence succeeded, till, pointing with her staff to the fire, the Vala said, \"Lo, where the smoke and the flame contend--the smoke rises in dark gyres to the air, and escapes, to join the wrack of clouds.  From the first to the last we trace its birth and its fall; from the heart of the fire to the descent in the rain, so is it with human reason, which is not the light but the smoke; it struggles but to darken us; it soars but to melt in the vapour and dew.  Yet, lo, the flame burns in our hearth till the fuel fails, and goes at last, none know whither.  But it lives in the air though we see it not; it lurks in the stone and waits the flash of the steel; it coils round the dry leaves and sere stalks, and a touch re-illumines it; it plays in the marsh--it collects in the heavens--it appals us in the lightning--it gives warmth to the air--life of our life, and the element of all elements.  O Githa, the flame is the light of the soul, the element everlasting; and it liveth still, when it escapes from our view; it burneth in the shapes to which it passes; it vanishes, but its never extinct.\"  So saying, the Vala's lips again closed; and again both the women sate silent by the great fire, as it flared and flickered over the deep lines and high features of Githa, the Earl's wife, and the calm, unwrinkled, solemn face of the melancholy Vala.     CHAPTER II.   While these conferences took place in the house of Godwin, Harold, on his way to London, dismissed his train to precede him to his father's roof, and, striking across the country, rode fast and alone towards the old Roman abode of Hilda.  Months had elapsed since he had seen or heard of Edith.  News at that time, I need not say, was rare and scarce, and limited to public events, either transmitted by special nuncius or passing pilgrim, or borne from lip to lip by the talk of the scattered multitude.  But even in his busy and anxious duties, Harold had in vain sought to banish from his heart the image of that young girl, whose life he needed no Vala to predict to him was interwoven with the fibres of his own.  The obstacles which, while he yielded to, he held unjust and tyrannical, obstacles allowed by his reluctant reason and his secret ambition--not sanctified by conscience--only inflamed the deep strength of the solitary passion his life had known; a passion that, dating from the very childhood of Edith, had, often unknown to himself, animated his desire of fame, and mingled with his visions of power.  Nor, though hope was far and dim, was it extinct.  The legitimate heir of Edward the Confessor was a prince living in the Court of the Emperor, of fair repute, and himself wedded; and Edward's health, always precarious, seemed to forbid any very prolonged existence to the reigning king.  Therefore, he thought that through the successor, whose throne would rest in safety upon Harold's support, he might easily obtain that dispensation from the Pope which he knew the present king would never ask--a dispensation rarely indeed, if ever, accorded to any subject, and which, therefore, needed all a king's power to back it.  So in that hope, and fearful lest it should be quenched for ever by Edith's adoption of the veil and the irrevocable vow, with a beating, disturbed, but joyful heart he rode over field and through forest to the old Roman house.  He emerged at length to the rear of the villa, and the sun, fast hastening to its decline, shone full upon the rude columns of the Druid temple.  And there, as he had seen her before, when he had first spoken of love and its barriers, he beheld the young maiden.  He sprang from his horse, and leaving the well-trained animal loose to browse on the waste land, he ascended the knoll.  He stole noiselessly behind Edith, and his foot stumbled against the grave-stone of the dead Titan-Saxon of old.  But the apparition, whether real or fancied, and the dream that had followed, had long passed from his memory, and no superstition was in the heart springing to the lips, that cried \"Edith\" once again.  The girl started, looked round, and fell upon his breast. It was some moments before she recovered consciousness, and then, withdrawing herself gently from his arms, she leant for support against the Teuton altar.  She was much changed since Harold had seen her last: her cheek had grown pale and thin, and her rounded form seemed wasted; and sharp grief, as he gazed, shot through the soul of Harold.  \"Thou hast pined, thou hast suffered,\" said he, mournfully: \"and I, who would shed my life's blood to take one from thy sorrows, or add to one of thy joys, have been afar, unable to comfort, perhaps only a cause of thy woe.\"  \"No, Harold,\" said Edith, faintly, \"never of woe; always of comfort, even in absence.  I have been ill, and Hilda hath tried rune and charm all in vain.  But I am better, now that Spring hath come tardily forth, and I look on the fresh flowers, and hear the song of the birds.\"  But tears were in the sound of her voice, while she spoke.  \"And they have not tormented thee again with the thoughts of the convent?\"  \"They? no;--but my soul, yes.  O Harold, release me from my promise; for the time already hath come that thy sister foretold to me; the silver cord is loosened, and the golden bowl is broken, and I would fain take the wings of the dove, and be at peace.\"  \"Is it so?--Is there peace in the home where the thought of Harold becomes a sin?\"  \"Not sin then and there, Harold, not sin.  Thy sister hailed the convent when she thought of prayer for those she loved.\"  \"Prate not to me of my sister!\" said Harold, through his set teeth. \"It is but a mockery to talk of prayer for the heart that thou thyself rendest in twain.  Where is Hilda?  I would see her.\"  \"She hath gone to thy father's house with a gift; and it was to watch for her return that I sate on the green knoll.\"  The Earl then drew near and took her hand, and sate by her side, and they conversed long.  But Harold saw with a fierce pang that Edith's heart was set upon the convent, and that even in his presence, and despite his soothing words, she was broken-spirited and despondent. It seemed as if her youth and life had gone from her, and the day had come in which she said, \"There is no pleasure.\"  Never had he seen her thus; and, deeply moved as well as keenly stung, he rose at length to depart; her hand lay passive in his parting clasp, and a slight shiver went over her frame.  \"Farewell, Edith; when I return from Windshore, I shall be at my old home yonder, and we shall meet again.\"  Edith's lips murmured inaudibly, and she bent her eyes to the ground.  Slowly Harold regained his steed, and as he rode on, he looked behind and waved oft his hand.  But Edith sate motionless, her eyes still on the ground, and he saw not the tears that fell from them fast and burning; nor heard he the low voice that groaned amidst the heathen ruins, \"Mary, sweet mother, shelter me from my own heart!\"  The sun had set before Harold gained the long and spacious abode of his father.  All around it lay the roofs and huts of the great Earl's special tradesmen, for even his goldsmith was but his freed ceorl. The house itself stretched far from the Thames inland, with several low courts built only of timber,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7676"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 05 (#2)"],["body"," rugged and shapeless, but filled with bold men, then the great furniture of a noble's halls.  Amidst the shouts of hundreds, eager to hold his stirrup, the Earl dismounted, passed the swarming hall, and entered the room, in which he found Hilda and Githa, and Godwin, who had preceded his entry but a few minutes.  In the beautiful reverence of son to father, which made one of the loveliest features of the Saxon character [126] (as the frequent want of it makes the most hateful of the Norman vices), the all-powerful Harold bowed his knee to the old Earl, who placed his hand on his head in benediction, and then kissed him on the cheek and brow.  \"Thy kiss, too, dear mother,\" said the younger Earl; and Githa's embrace, if more cordial than her lord's, was not, perhaps, more fond.  \"Greet Hilda, my son,\" said Godwin, \"she hath brought me a gift, and she hath tarried to place it under thy special care.  Thou alone must heed the treasure, and open the casket.  But when and where, my kinswoman?\"  \"On the sixth day after thy coming to the King's hall,\" answered Hilda, not returning the smile with which Godwin spoke,--\"on the sixth day, Harold, open the chest, and take out the robe which hath been spun in the house of Hilda for Godwin the Earl.  And now, Godwin, I have clasped thine hand, and I have looked on thy brow, and my mission is done, and I must wend homeward.\"  \"That shalt thou not, Hilda,\" said the hospitable Earl; \"the meanest wayfarer hath a right to bed and board in this house for a night and a day, and thou wilt not disgrace us by leaving our threshold, the bread unbroken, and the couch unpressed.  Old friend, we were young together, and thy face is welcome to me as the memory of former days.\"  Hilda shook her head, and one of those rare, and for that reason most touching, expressions of tenderness of which the calm and rigid character of her features, when in repose, seemed scarcely susceptible, softened her eye, and relaxed the firm lines of her lips.  \"Son of Wolnoth,\" said she, gently, \"not under thy roof-tree should lodge the raven of bode.  Bread have I not broken since yestere'en, and sleep will be far from my eyes to-night.  Fear not, for my people without are stout and armed, and for the rest there lives not the man whose arm can have power over Hilda.\"  She took Harold's hand as she spoke, and leading him forth, whispered in his ear, \"I would have a word with thee ere we part.\"  Then, reaching the threshold, she waved her hand thrice over the floor, and muttered in the Danish tongue a rude verse, which, translated, ran somewhat thus:      \"All free from the knot        Glide the thread of the skein,      And rest to the labour,        And peace to the pain!\"  \"It is a death-dirge,\" said Githa, with whitening lips, but she spoke inly, and neither husband nor son heard her words.  Hilda and Harold passed in silence through the hall, and the Vala's attendants, with spears and torches, rose from the settles, and went before to the outer court, where snorted impatiently her black palfrey.  Halting in the midst of the court, she said to Harold, in a low voice:  \"At sunset we part--at sunset we shall meet again.  And behold, the star rises on the sunset; and the star, broader and brighter, shall rise on the sunset then!  When thy hand draws the robe from the chest, think on Hilda, and know that at that hour she stands by the grave of the Saxon warrior, and that from the grave dawns the future.  Farewell to thee!\"  Harold longed to speak to her of Edith, but a strange awe at his heart chained his lips; so he stood silent by the great wooden gates of the rude house.  The torches flamed round him, and Hilda's face seemed lurid in the glare.  There he stood musing long after torch and ceorl had passed away, nor did he wake from his reverie till Gurth, springing from his panting horse, passed his arm round the Earl's shoulder, and cried:  \"How did I miss thee, my brother? and why didst thou forsake thy train?\"  \"I will tell thee anon.  Gurth, has my father ailed?  There is that in his face which I like not.\"  \"He hath not complained of misease,\" said Gurth, startled; \"but now thou speakest of it, his mood hath altered of late, and he hath wandered much alone, or only with the old hound and the old falcon.\"  Then Harold turned back, and, his heart was full; and, when he reached the house, his father was sitting in the hall on his chair of state; and Githa sate on his right hand, and a little below her sate Tostig and Leofwine, who had come in from the bear-hunt by the river-gate, and were talking loud and merrily; and thegns and cnehts sate all around, and there was wassail as Harold entered.  But the Earl looked only to his father, and he saw that his eyes were absent from the glee, and that he was bending his head over the old falcon, which sate on his wrist.     CHAPTER III.   No subject of England, since the race of Cerdic sate on the throne, ever entered the courtyard of Windshore with such train and such state as Earl Godwin.--Proud of that first occasion, since his return, to do homage to him with whose cause that of England against the stranger was bound, all truly English at heart amongst the thegns of the land swelled his retinue.  Whether Saxon or Dane, those who alike loved the laws and the soil, came from north and from south to the peaceful banner of the old Earl.  But most of these were of the past generation, for the rising race were still dazzled by the pomp of the Norman; and the fashion of English manners, and the pride in English deeds, had gone out of date with long locks and bearded chins.  Nor there were the bishops and abbots and the lords of the Church,--for dear to them already the fame of the Norman piety, and they shared the distaste of their holy King to the strong sense and homely religion of Godwin, who founded no convents, and rode to war with no relics round his neck.  But they with Godwin were the stout and the frank and the free, in whom rested the pith and marrow of English manhood; and they who were against him were the blind and willing and fated fathers of slaves unborn.  Not then the stately castle we now behold, which is of the masonry of a prouder race, nor on the same site, but two miles distant on the winding of the river shore (whence it took its name), a rude building partly of timber and partly of Roman brick, adjoining a large monastery and surrounded by a small hamlet, constituted the palace of the saint-king.  So rode the Earl and his four fair sons, all abreast, into the courtyard of Windshore [127].  Now when King Edward heard the tramp of the steeds and the hum of the multitudes, as he sate in his closet with his abbots and priests, all in still contemplation of the thumb of St. Jude, the King asked:  \"What army, in the day of peace, and the time of Easter, enters the gates of our palace?\"  Then an abbot rose and looked out of the narrow window, and said with a groan:  \"Army thou mayst well call it, O King!--and foes to us and to thee head the legions----\"  \"Inprinis,\" quoth our abbot the scholar; \"thou speakest, I trow, of the wicked Earl and his sons.\"  The King's face changed.  \"Come they,\" said he, \"with so large a train?  This smells more of vaunt than of loyalty; naught--very naught.\"  \"Alack!\" said one of the conclave, \"I fear me that the men of Belial will work us harm; the heathen are mighty, and----\"  \"Fear not,\" said Edward, with benign loftiness, observing that his guests grew pale, and himself, though often weak to childishness, and morally wavering and irresolute,--still so far king and gentleman, that he knew no craven fear of the body.  \"Fear not for me, my fathers; humble as I am, I am strong in the faith of heaven and its angels.\"  The Churchmen looked at each other, sly yet abashed; it was not precisely for the King that they feared.  Then spoke Alred, the good prelate and constant peacemaker--fair column and lone one of the fast-crumbling Saxon Church.  \"It is ill in you, brethren to arraign the truth and good meaning of those who honour your King; and in these days that lord should ever be the most welcome who brings to the halls of his king the largest number of hearts, stout and leal.\"  \"By your leave, brother Alred,\" said Stigand, who, though from motives of policy he had aided those who besought the King not to peril his crown by resisting the return of Godwin, benefited too largely by the abuses of the Church to be sincerely espoused to the cause of the strong-minded Earl; \"By your leave, brother Alred, to every leal heart is a ravenous mouth; and the treasures of the King are well-nigh drained in feeding these hungry and welcomeless visitors.  Durst I counsel my lord I would pray him, as a matter of policy, to baffle this astute and proud Earl.  He would fain have the King feast in public, that he might daunt him and the Church with the array of his friends.\"  \"I conceive thee, my father,\" said Edward, with more quickness than habitual, and with the cunning, sharp though guileless, that belongs to minds undeveloped, \"I conceive thee; it is good and most politic. This our orgulous Earl shall not have his triumph, and, so fresh from his exile, brave his King with the mundane parade of his power.  Our health is our excuse for our absence from the banquet, and, sooth to say, we marvel much why Easter should be held a fitting time for feasting and mirth.  Wherefore, Hugoline, my chamberlain, advise the Earl that to-day we keep fast till the sunset, when temperately, with eggs, bread, and fish, we will sustain Adam's nature.  Pray him and his sons to attend us--they alone be our guests.\"  And with a sound that seemed a laugh, or the ghost of a laugh, low and chuckling--for Edward had at moments an innocent humour which his monkish biographer disdained not to note [128],--he flung himself back in his chair.  The priests took the cue, and shook their sides heartily, as Hugoline left the room, not ill pleased, by the way, to escape an"]]]
