Only when your mother came last week and said she wanted me to come here to live, why it did seem kind of wonderful to find out what a beautiful home was like, and then most of all I wanted to know you.  You will think it strange of me, but I have been seeing you with your mother or nurse ever since you were a little girl of three or four and I a little older, and I have always been interested in you.\"  Betty smiled, showing a dimple which sometimes appeared after an exhibition of temper of which she felt ashamed.  \"Oh, you will be sorry enough to know what I am really like,\" she answered, \"and will probably think I am dreadfully spoiled.  But do please stay for a while if you wish, at least until we find how we get on together.\"  Since Betty's first speech at the door had startled her, Esther had never for a moment taken her eyes from her face.  Never in all her life, even when she had seen and learned far more of the ways of the world, could this girl learn not to speak the truth.  So now she slowly shook her head. \"Your mother did say you were spoiled; it was one reason why she wished me to come here to live,\" she replied.  \"You see, she said that you had been too much alone and had too much done for you and that your brother was so much older that he only helped to spoil you. But,\" Esther was hardly conscious of her listener and seemed only to be thinking aloud, \"I shall not mind if you are spoiled, for how can you help being when you are so pretty and fortunate and have all the things that other girls have just to dream of possessing.\"  It was odd, perhaps, but the new girl's speech was made so simply and sincerely that Betty Ashton instead of feeling angry or complimented was instead a little ashamed.  Had fortune been kinder to her than to other girls, kinder than to the awkward girl in front of her in her plain gray linen dress?  Betty now backed toward the door which she had so lately opened.  \"I am sorry to have disturbed you, but usually this room isn't occupied and I was curious to know who could be in here.  I should have knocked.  Some day you must sing that lovely song to me, again, for I think I would like very much to know just what my soul's desire is.  The worst of life is not knowing just what you want.\"  Esther had followed Betty toward the hall.  \"How funny that sounds to me,\" she returned shyly, \"because I think the hard part of life is not having what you want.  I know very well.  But can't I do something for you now? Your mother said you were not well and perhaps would not wish to see me this afternoon, but I could read to you or--\"  Betty's irritability returned.  \"Thank you very much,\" she returned coldly, \"but I can think of nothing in the world that would amuse me at present.  I simply wish not to freeze, and to save my life I can't get one of our tiresome maids to answer my bell.\"  Betty's grand manner had returned, but in spite of her haughtiness the newcomer persisted.  \"Do let me make the fire for you. I am only a wood-gatherer at present, but pretty soon I shall be a real fire-maker, for I have already been working for two months.\"  \"A wood-gatherer and fire-maker; what extraordinary things a girl was forced to become at an orphan asylum!\"  Betty's sympathies were immediately aroused and her cheeks burned with resentment at the sudden vision of this girl at her side trudging through the woods, her back bent under heavy burdens.  No wonder her shoulders stooped and her hands were coarse.  Betty slipped her arm through the stranger's.  \"No, I won't trouble you to make my fire, but do come into my room and let us just talk.  None of my friends have been in to see me this afternoon, not even the faithless Polly!  They are too busy getting ready for the end of school to think about poor, ill me.\"  And Betty laughed gayly at the untruthfulness of this picture of herself.  Once inside the blue room, without asking permission, Esther knelt straightway down before the brass andirons and with deft fingers placed a roll of twisted paper under a lattice-like pile of kindling, arranging three small pine logs in a triangle above it.  But before setting a match to the paper she turned toward the other girl hovering about her like a butterfly.  \"I wonder if you would like me to recite the fire-maker's song?\" she asked.  \"I haven't the right to say it yet, but it is so lovely that I would like you to hear it.\"  Betty stared and laughed.  \"Do fire-makers have songs?\" she demanded. \"How queer that sounds!  Perhaps the Indians used to have fire songs long ago when a fire really meant so much.  But I can't imagine a maid's chanting a song before one's fire in the morning and I don't think I should like being wakened up by it.\"  \"You would like this one,\" the other girl persisted.  Little yellow spurts of flame were now creeping forth from between the sticks, some leaping away into nothingness, others curling and enfolding them.  The paper in the grate crackled noisily as the cold May wind swept down the chimney with a defiant roar and both girls silently watched the newly kindled fire with the fascination that is eternal.  Betty had also dropped down on her knees.  \"What is your song?\" she asked curiously an instant later, raising her hands before her face to let the firelight shine through.  Esther's head was bent so that her face could not be seen, but the beauty of her speech was reflected in the other girl's changing expression.  \"As fuel is brought to the fire, So I purpose to bring My strength, my ambition, My heart's desire, My joy And my sorrow To the fire Of humankind.\"  Purposely Esther's voice dropped with these last words, and she did not continue until a hand was placed gently on her shoulder and a voice urged: \"Please go on; what is the 'fire of humankind'?\"  \"For I will tend As my fathers have tended And my fathers' fathers Since time began, The fire that is called The love of man for man, The love of man for God.\"  At the end, Esther glancing around at the girl beside her was surprised to see a kind of mist over her gray eyes.  But Betty laughed as she got up to her feet and going over to her table stooped to pick up the book she had thrown on the floor half an hour before.  \"I might have made my own fire if I had known that song,\" she said, switching on the electric light under the rose-colored shade.  For the clouds outside had broken at last, the rain was pouring and the blue room save for the firelight would have been in darkness.  Betty sat down, putting her feet under her and resting her chin on her hands.  \"I wonder what it feels like to be useful?\" she asked, evidently questioning herself, for afterwards she turned toward her companion. \"You must have learned a great many things by being brought up at an orphan asylum, how to care for, other people and all that, but I never would have dreamed that poetry would have played any part in your education.\"  Esther had turned and was about to leave the room, but now at Betty's words, she looked at her strangely.  Her face had reddened again and because of the intensity of her feelings her big hands were once more pressed nervously together.  \"Why, no, I never learned anything at the asylum but work,\" she answered slowly, \"just dull, hateful, routine work; doing the same things over again every day in the same way, cooking and washing dishes and scrubbing.  I suppose I was being useful, but there isn't much fun in being useful when nobody cares or seems to be helped by what you do.  I know I am ugly and not clever, but I love beautiful people and, beautiful things.\"  Unconsciously her glance traveled from her listener's face to the small piano in the corner of the room.  \"And it never seemed to me that things, were divided quite fairly in this world, but now that I know about the Camp Fire Girls I am ever so much happier.\"  \"Camp Fire Girls?\" Betty queried.  \"Do sit down, child, I don't wish you to leave me, and please don't say horrid things about yourself, for it isn't polite and you never can tell how things are going to turn out. But who are the Camp Fire Girls; what are the Camp Fire Girls; are they Indians or Esquimaux or the fire-maidens in 'The Nibelungen'?  Perhaps, after all, something new has been invented for girls, and a little while ago I felt as discouraged as King Solomon and believed there was nothing new and nothing worth while under the sun.\"  Betty's eyes were dancing with fun and anticipation, her bored look had entirely disappeared, but the other girl evidently took her question seriously.  She had seated herself in a small desk chair and kept her eyes fixed on the fire.  \"It seems very queer to me that you don't know about the 'Camp Fire Girls',\" she answered slowly, \"and it may take me a long time to tell you even the little bit I know, but I think it the most splendid thing that has ever happened.\"     CHAPTER II  \"METHINKS YOU ARE MY GLASS\"   Just across the street from the old Ashton place was another house equally old and yet wholly unlike it, for instead of being a stately, well-kept-up mansion with great rooms and broad halls and half an acre of garden about it, this was a cottage of the earliest New England type. It was low and rambling, covering a good deal of ground and yet without any porch and very little yard, because as the village closed about it and Elm Street became a fashionable quarter the land had been gradually sold until now its white picket fence was only a dozen feet from the front door and passers-by could easily have looked inside its parlor windows save for the tall bushes that served as a shield.  By immemorial custom the cottage had always been painted white and green, but for a good many years it had not been troubled by any paint at all, \"but had lived,\" as Polly said, \"on its past, and like a good many persons in Woodford had gotten considerably run down by the process.\"  Now there were no lights at any of the front windows,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8662"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls at Sunrise Hill (#2)"],["body","it was eight o'clock in the evening, but as the warm steady glow of a lamp shone from the rear of the house, it was plainly occupied.  There was no doubt of this in the mind of the girl who stood knocking noisily at the closed door, saying in an imploring voice:  \"Oh, do please hurry, Polly dear, you know it is only me and that I can't bear to be kept waiting.\"  At this moment a candle was evidently being borne down the hall, for the door opened so quickly afterwards that two girls, one on either side the door, fell into, one another's arms.  \"Dear me, it's 'The Princess' and she is no more ill than I am, though we were told she couldn't possibly be at school to-day on account of her ill health,\" the girl on the inside spoke first, recovering her breath. \"I suppose royal persons may lie abed and nurse their dispositions, while poor ones have to keep on washing dishes.  But come on into the kitchen, Betty, we are in there to-night and I haven't yet finished my chores.\"  She led the way with the candle down the shabby hall until both girls entered the lighted room.  There, with a little cry of surprise, Betty ran over and dropped down on her knees by the side of a lounge.  The woman on the lounge was not so large as the girl, although her brown hair showed a good deal of gray and her face looked tired and worn.  She had been holding a magazine in her hands, but evidently had not been reading, for her eyes had turned from the girl, who stood only a few feet away from her drying some cups and saucers, to the two others who had just come in, without an instant's delay.  \"I am quite all right, dear,\" she answered the newcomer, \"only the kitchen seemed so warm and cozy after the wet day and I was tired.\"  Betty was too familiar with the lovely, old-fashioned kitchen of her dearest friends even to think about it, but to-night she did look about her for a moment.  The room was the largest in the cottage; the walls were of oak so dark a brown from age that they were almost black; there were heavy rafters across the ceiling and swinging from them bunches of dried, sweet-smelling herbs. The windows had broad sills filled with pots of red geraniums and ground ivy, and as they were wide open the odor of the wet, spring earth outside mingled with the aromatic fragrance of the flowers.  An old stove was set deep into the farthest wall with a Dutch oven at one side and above it a high, severely plain mantel holding a number of venerable pots and pans of pewter and copper and two tall, copper candlesticks.  The candles were lighted, as the room was too large for the single light of the lamp on the table near the lounge.  Polly O'Neill had gone straight to her sister and putting both hands on her shoulders had pushed her steadily back inch by inch until she forced her into a large armchair.  \"Mollie Mavourneen, you know I hate washing dishes like an owl does the day light, but I am not going to let you do my work and to-night you know the agreeable task of cleaning up belongs to me.  I asked you to leave things alone when I went to the door and I don't think you play fair.\"  Polly seized a cup with such vehemence that it slipped from her hand and crashed onto the floor, but neither her mother nor Mollie showed the least sign of surprise and only Betty's eyes widened with understanding.  Strangers always insisted that there were never twin sisters in the world so exactly alike as Mollie and Polly O'Neill (not that their names had ever been intended to rhyme in this absurd fashion, for they had started quite sensibly, as Mary and Pauline), but to the friends who knew them both well this idea was absurd.  It was true they were of the same height and their hair and eyes of the same color, their noses and mouths of somewhat the same shape, but with these superficial likenesses the resemblance ended. Anybody should have been able to see that in each detail Polly was the more intense; her hair was blacker and longer, her eyes bluer, her cheek bones a little higher with brighter color and her chin and delicate nose a trifle longer and more pointed.  Of the two girls, however, Mollie was the prettier because her features were more regular and her expression more serene; but once under the spell of her sister, one never thought much of her appearance.  Polly had a temperament and she was having an attack of it to-night; the room was fairly electric with it.  From some far off Irish ancestor she must have inherited it, for though her father had been an Irishman and had spent forty out of the fifty years of his life in Ireland, he had quite a different disposition and had been as amazed by Polly in her babyhood as the rest of her family.  Captain O'Neill had resigned from the English army eighteen years before and crossed the ocean to spend a few years in the neighborhood of the White Mountains on account of his health; he had no more money than most Irish gentlemen, but had charming manners, was extremely handsome and had soon fallen in love and married a girl twenty years younger than himself.  Mary Poindexter had been the girl most loved in Woodford, one of its belles and heiresses, but her money had not amounted to much and soon disappeared after her marriage, until now she had only the cottage in which she and her daughters lived and the income earned by her work as private secretary to Mr. Edward Wharton of \"The Wharton Granite Co.\" Captain O'Neill had lived only until his twin daughters were eight years old and since then the girls and their mother had kept up their small home together.  \"You are dead tired and Polly is cross as two sticks and poor Mollie does not know what to do with you.  Would you rather I should go away? I only came to tell you something wonderful,\" Betty whispered in Mrs. O'Neill's ear.  The older woman shook her head.  \"No, you have come just at the right time. I am not very tired, only my daughters chose to think so and wouldn't let me help with dinner and so, as I am an obedient, well brought-up mother, I am doing as I am told.  And Polly is not in a bad humor, at least I hope--\"  The girl, who had been picking up the bits of broken china from the kitchen floor, now straightened up and for the first time Betty discovered that she must have been crying a short while before.  \"Oh, yes, I am anything you may like to call me,\" Polly announced indifferently, \"and I am not in the least ashamed to have 'The Princess' know it.  If Betty had to stand all the things I have stood to-day, she would be in a far worse humor.  She and I are not angels like Mary and Mollie, so I suppose that is the reason why we love one another part of the time and hate one another the rest.  I am sure I never pretend not to being dreadfully envious of 'The Princess'.\"  Polly came over and sat down cross-legged on the old rug near her mother and best friend, and though she smiled a little to remove the sting from her words, something in her expression kept Betty from answering at once. In the meantime Mollie joined the group, taking her place at the foot of the lounge.  The three girls were nearly the same age and the closest friends, and Betty probably spent nearly as much of her waking time, at the cottage as she did in her own home, for whenever she was lonely or bored, or, tired perhaps of having too much done for her, she had been used to run across the street to play or work with her friends from the time they were children.  Mrs. O'Neill had never seemed very much older than her daughters and had always been called \"Mary\" by the three girls.  Now Betty reached over and laid one and lightly on Polly.  \"Don't say we hate no another just because we quarrel now and then and both have bad tempers.  I never hate Polly, do I Mary?\"  But before Mrs. O'Neill could answer, Polly suddenly faced fiercely about. \"I hate you to-night, Betty,\" she insisted, and then to make her words entirely unlike her actions, slipped one arm around her friend. \"Oh, you know that I don't really mean I hate you, I only mean that I am horribly envious and jealous of your having all the money you want and being able to do things without worry, not just things for yourself, but things for other people.\"  And Polly bit her lips and ceased speaking, both because of the note of warning in her mother's face and because the brightness had died away from Betty's.  \"I wish you would understand, Polly, that just having things does not necessarily make one happy; I often think it must be nicer to be poor and to have to help like you and Mollie do.  This afternoon I was feeling quite forlorn myself, as I had a kind of headache and no one came to see me, and then just like magic from out our haunted chamber there appeared well, I can hardly call her a good fairy, she was too homely, but at least a girl who told me of something so delightful that it sounds almost like a fairy tale.  I talked of it to father at dinner and then rushed over to tell you, as I thought you might be interested, but perhaps I had better wait--\"  From the foot of the lounge Mollie O'Neill now interrupted.  Utterly unlike either her sister or friend in her disposition, her influence often held them together.  \"We do want to hear what you have to tell us, Betty, most dreadfully. Just because we happen to be specially worried about something to-night is no reason why Polly should be so mysterious.  I vote we tell you what our trouble is and then you tell us your secret.\"  Polly got up from the floor.  She was always curiously intense, not deliberately, but perhaps as a part of her inheritance.  Now she made a little bow to Betty.  \"I am sorry I was rude to you, Princess,\" she said gently, \"but tell you the reason for my special tirade against poverty to-night, I will not and Mollie shall not tell either.\"  Without replying Betty turned to pick up her blue cloak which had dropped from her shoulders as she knelt by the lounge.  It had a cap attached with a blue silk lining and this she slipped over her "]]]
