Brother, bring a seat, and thereto what cheer ye have, withal.  Now 'tis right.\"  \"Not quite, not wholly right.  You have asked for one, not _us_ --for one, not both; food for one, a seat for one.\"  The king looked puzzled--he wasn't a very heavy weight, intellectually. His head was an hour-glass; it could stow an idea, but it had to do it a grain at a time, not the whole idea at once.  \"Would _you_ have a seat also--and sit?\"  \"If I did not sit, the man would perceive that we were only pretending to be equals--and playing the deception pretty poorly, too.\"  \"It is well and truly said!  How wonderful is truth, come it in whatsoever unexpected form it may!  Yes, he must bring out seats and food for both, and in serving us present not ewer and napkin with more show of respect to the one than to the other.\"  \"And there is even yet a detail that needs correcting.  He must bring nothing outside; we will go in--in among the dirt, and possibly other repulsive things,--and take the food with the household, and after the fashion of the house, and all on equal terms, except the man be of the serf class; and finally, there will be no ewer and no napkin, whether he be serf or free.  Please walk again, my liege.  There--it is better--it is the best yet; but not perfect.  The shoulders have known no ignobler burden than iron mail, and they will not stoop.\"  \"Give me, then, the bag.  I will learn the spirit that goeth with burdens that have not honor.  It is the spirit that stoopeth the shoulders, I ween, and not the weight; for armor is heavy, yet it is a proud burden, and a man standeth straight in it.... Nay, but me no buts, offer me no objections.  I will have the thing. Strap it upon my back.\"  He was complete now with that knapsack on, and looked as little like a king as any man I had ever seen.  But it was an obstinate pair of shoulders; they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any sort of deceptive naturalness.  The drill went on, I prompting and correcting:  \"Now, make believe you are in debt, and eaten up by relentless creditors; you are out of work--which is horse-shoeing, let us say--and can get none; and your wife is sick, your children are crying because they are hungry--\"  And so on, and so on.  I drilled him as representing in turn all sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes.  But lord, it was only just words, words--they meant nothing in the world to him, I might just as well have whistled. Words realize nothing, vivify nothing to you, unless you have suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to describe.  There are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about \"the working classes,\" and satisfy themselves that a day's hard intellectual work is very much harder than a day's hard manual toil, and is righteously entitled to much bigger pay.  Why, they really think that, you know, because they know all about the one, but haven't tried the other.  But I know all about both; and so far as I am concerned, there isn't money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pickaxe thirty days, but I will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as near nothing as you can cipher it down--and I will be satisfied, too.  Intellectual \"work\" is misnamed; it is a pleasure, a dissipation, and is its own highest reward.  The poorest paid architect, engineer, general, author, sculptor, painter, lecturer, advocate, legislator, actor, preacher, singer is constructively in heaven when he is at work; and as for the musician with the fiddle-bow in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him--why, certainly, he is at work, if you wish to call it that, but lord, it's a sarcasm just the same.  The law of work does seem utterly unfair--but there it is, and nothing can change it: the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it, the higher shall be his pay in cash, also.  And it's also the very law of those transparent swindles, transmissible nobility and kingship.    CHAPTER XXIX  THE SMALLPOX HUT  When we arrived at that hut at mid-afternoon, we saw no signs of life about it.  The field near by had been denuded of its crop some time before, and had a skinned look, so exhaustively had it been harvested and gleaned.  Fences, sheds, everything had a ruined look, and were eloquent of poverty.  No animal was around anywhere, no living thing in sight.  The stillness was awful, it was like the stillness of death.  The cabin was a one-story one, whose thatch was black with age, and ragged from lack of repair.  The door stood a trifle ajar.  We approached it stealthily--on tiptoe and at half-breath--for that is the way one's feeling makes him do, at such a time.  The king knocked.  We waited.  No answer.  Knocked again.  No answer.  I pushed the door softly open and looked in. I made out some dim forms, and a woman started up from the ground and stared at me, as one does who is wakened from sleep.  Presently she found her voice:  \"Have mercy!\" she pleaded.  \"All is taken, nothing is left.\"  \"I have not come to take anything, poor woman.\"  \"You are not a priest?\"  \"No.\"  \"Nor come not from the lord of the manor?\"  \"No, I am a stranger.\"  \"Oh, then, for the fear of God, who visits with misery and death such as be harmless, tarry not here, but fly!  This place is under his curse--and his Church's.\"  \"Let me come in and help you--you are sick and in trouble.\"  I was better used to the dim light now.  I could see her hollow eyes fixed upon me.  I could see how emaciated she was.  \"I tell you the place is under the Church's ban.  Save yourself --and go, before some straggler see thee here, and report it.\"  \"Give yourself no trouble about me; I don't care anything for the Church's curse.  Let me help you.\"  \"Now all good spirits--if there be any such--bless thee for that word.  Would God I had a sup of water!--but hold, hold, forget I said it, and fly; for there is that here that even he that feareth not the Church must fear: this disease whereof we die. Leave us, thou brave, good stranger, and take with thee such whole and sincere blessing as them that be accursed can give.\"  But before this I had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing past the king on my way to the brook.  It was ten yards away. When I got back and entered, the king was within, and was opening the shutter that closed the window-hole, to let in air and light. The place was full of a foul stench.  I put the bowl to the woman's lips, and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came open and a strong light flooded her face.  Smallpox!  I sprang to the king, and said in his ear:  \"Out of the door on the instant, sire! the woman is dying of that disease that wasted the skirts of Camelot two years ago.\"  He did not budge.  \"Of a truth I shall remain--and likewise help.\"  I whispered again:  \"King, it must not be.  You must go.\"  \"Ye mean well, and ye speak not unwisely.  But it were shame that a king should know fear, and shame that belted knight should withhold his hand where be such as need succor.  Peace, I will not go.  It is you who must go.  The Church's ban is not upon me, but it forbiddeth you to be here, and she will deal with you with a heavy hand an word come to her of your trespass.\"  It was a desperate place for him to be in, and might cost him his life, but it was no use to argue with him.  If he considered his knightly honor at stake here, that was the end of argument; he would stay, and nothing could prevent it; I was aware of that. And so I dropped the subject.  The woman spoke:  \"Fair sir, of your kindness will ye climb the ladder there, and bring me news of what ye find?  Be not afraid to report, for times can come when even a mother's heart is past breaking --being already broke.\"  \"Abide,\" said the king, \"and give the woman to eat.  I will go.\" And he put down the knapsack.  I turned to start, but the king had already started.  He halted, and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light, and had not noticed us thus far, or spoken.  \"Is it your husband?\" the king asked.  \"Yes.\"  \"Is he asleep?\"  \"God be thanked for that one charity, yes--these three hours. Where shall I pay to the full, my gratitude! for my heart is bursting with it for that sleep he sleepeth now.\"  I said:  \"We will be careful.  We will not wake him.\"  \"Ah, no, that ye will not, for he is dead.\"  \"Dead?\"  \"Yes, what triumph it is to know it!  None can harm him, none insult him more.  He is in heaven now, and happy; or if not there, he bides in hell and is content; for in that place he will find neither abbot nor yet bishop.  We were boy and girl together; we were man and wife these five and twenty years, and never separated till this day.  Think how long that is to love and suffer together. This morning was he out of his mind, and in his fancy we were boy and girl again and wandering in the happy fields; and so in that innocent glad converse wandered he far and farther, still lightly gossiping, and entered into those other fields we know not of, and was shut away from mortal sight.  And so there was no parting, for in his fancy I went with him; he knew not but I went with him, my hand in his--my young soft hand, not this withered claw.  Ah, yes, to go, and know it not; to separate and know it not; how could one go peace--fuller than that?  It was his reward for a cruel life patiently borne.\"  There was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where the ladder was.  It was the king descending.  I could see that he was bearing something in one arm, and assisting himself with the other.  He came forward into the light; upon his breast lay a slender girl of fifteen.  She was but half conscious; she was dying of smallpox.  Here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility, its utmost summit; this was challenging death in the open field"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7248"],["title","A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 7.

There was a pale and awful silence.  Not a limb stirred. Not a nostril betrayed the passage of breath.  \"Is that all?\" I asked, in a voice of the most perfect calmness.  \"All, fair sir, save that certain matters of light moment are placed together under a head hight sundries.  If it would like you, I will sepa--\"  \"It is of no consequence,\" I said, accompanying the words with a gesture of the most utter indifference; \"give me the grand total, please.\"  The clerk leaned against the tree to stay himself, and said:  \"Thirty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty milrays!\"  The wheelwright fell off his stool, the others grabbed the table to save themselves, and there was a deep and general ejaculation of:  \"God be with us in the day of disaster!\"  The clerk hastened to say:  \"My father chargeth me to say he cannot honorably require you to pay it all at this time, and therefore only prayeth you--\"  I paid no more heed than if it were the idle breeze, but, with an air of indifference amounting almost to weariness, got out my money and tossed four dollars on to the table.  Ah, you should have seen them stare!  The clerk was astonished and charmed.  He asked me to retain one of the dollars as security, until he could go to town and --I interrupted:  \"What, and fetch back nine cents?  Nonsense!  Take the whole. Keep the change.\"  There was an amazed murmur to this effect:  \"Verily this being is _made_ of money!  He throweth it away even as if it were dirt.\"  The blacksmith was a crushed man.  The clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune.  I said to Marco and his wife:  \"Good folk, here is a little trifle for you\"--handing the miller-guns as if it were a matter of no consequence, though each of them contained fifteen cents in solid cash; and while the poor creatures went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude, I turned to the others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day:  \"Well, if we are all ready, I judge the dinner is.  Come, fall to.\"  Ah, well, it was immense; yes, it was a daisy.  I don't know that I ever put a situation together better, or got happier spectacular effects out of the materials available.  The blacksmith--well, he was simply mashed.  Land! I wouldn't have felt what that man was feeling, for anything in the world.  Here he had been blowing and bragging about his grand meat-feast twice a year, and his fresh meat twice a month, and his salt meat twice a week, and his white bread every Sunday the year round--all for a family of three; the entire cost for the year not above 69.2.6 (sixty-nine cents, two mills and six milrays), and all of a sudden here comes along a man who slashes out nearly four dollars on a single blow-out; and not only that, but acts as if it made him tired to handle such small sums.  Yes, Dowley was a good deal wilted, and shrunk-up and collapsed; he had the aspect of a bladder-balloon that's been stepped on by a cow.    CHAPTER XXXIII  SIXTH CENTURY POLITICAL ECONOMY  However, I made a dead set at him, and before the first third of the dinner was reached, I had him happy again.  It was easy to do--in a country of ranks and castes.  You see, in a country where they have ranks and castes, a man isn't ever a man, he is only part of a man, he can't ever get his full growth.  You prove your superiority over him in station, or rank, or fortune, and that's the end of it--he knuckles down.  You can't insult him after that.  No, I don't mean quite that; of course you _can_ insult him, I only mean it's difficult; and so, unless you've got a lot of useless time on your hands it doesn't pay to try.  I had the smith's reverence now, because I was apparently immensely prosperous and rich; I could have had his adoration if I had had some little gimcrack title of nobility.  And not only his, but any commoner's in the land, though he were the mightiest production of all the ages, in intellect, worth, and character, and I bankrupt in all three. This was to remain so, as long as England should exist in the earth.  With the spirit of prophecy upon me, I could look into the future and see her erect statues and monuments to her unspeakable Georges and other royal and noble clothes-horses, and leave unhonored the creators of this world--after God--Gutenburg, Watt, Arkwright, Whitney, Morse, Stephenson, Bell.  The king got his cargo aboard, and then, the talk not turning upon battle, conquest, or iron-clad duel, he dulled down to drowsiness and went off to take a nap.  Mrs. Marco cleared the table, placed the beer keg handy, and went away to eat her dinner of leavings in humble privacy, and the rest of us soon drifted into matters near and dear to the hearts of our sort--business and wages, of course.  At a first glance, things appeared to be exceeding prosperous in this little tributary kingdom--whose lord was King Bagdemagus--as compared with the state of things in my own region.  They had the \"protection\" system in full force here, whereas we were working along down toward free-trade, by easy stages, and were now about half way.  Before long, Dowley and I were doing all the talking, the others hungrily listening.  Dowley warmed to his work, snuffed an advantage in the air, and began to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me, and they did have something of that look:  \"In your country, brother, what is the wage of a master bailiff, master hind, carter, shepherd, swineherd?\"  \"Twenty-five milrays a day; that is to say, a quarter of a cent.\"  The smith's face beamed with joy.  He said:  \"With us they are allowed the double of it!  And what may a mechanic get--carpenter, dauber, mason, painter, blacksmith, wheelwright, and the like?\"  \"On the average, fifty milrays; half a cent a day.\"  \"Ho-ho!  With us they are allowed a hundred!  With us any good mechanic is allowed a cent a day!  I count out the tailor, but not the others--they are all allowed a cent a day, and in driving times they get more--yes, up to a hundred and ten and even fifteen milrays a day.  I've paid a hundred and fifteen myself, within the week.  'Rah for protection--to Sheol with free-trade!\"  And his face shone upon the company like a sunburst.  But I didn't scare at all.  I rigged up my pile-driver, and allowed myself fifteen minutes to drive him into the earth--drive him _all_ in --drive him in till not even the curve of his skull should show above ground.  Here is the way I started in on him.  I asked:  \"What do you pay a pound for salt?\"  \"A hundred milrays.\"  \"We pay forty.  What do you pay for beef and mutton--when you buy it?\"  That was a neat hit; it made the color come.  \"It varieth somewhat, but not much; one may say seventy-five milrays the pound.\"  \"_We_ pay thirty-three.  What do you pay for eggs?\"  \"Fifty milrays the dozen.\"  \"We pay twenty.  What do you pay for beer?\"  \"It costeth us eight and one-half milrays the pint.\"  \"We get it for four; twenty-five bottles for a cent. What do you pay for wheat?\"  \"At the rate of nine hundred milrays the bushel.\"  \"We pay four hundred.  What do you pay for a man's tow-linen suit?\"  \"Thirteen cents.\"  \"We pay six.  What do you pay for a stuff gown for the wife of the laborer or the mechanic?\"  \"We pay eight cents, four mills.\"  \"Well, observe the difference: you pay eight cents and four mills, we pay only four cents.\"  I prepared now to sock it to him.  I said: \"Look here, dear friend, _what's become of your high wages you were bragging so about a few minutes ago?_\"--and I looked around on the company with placid satisfaction, for I had slipped up on him gradually and tied him hand and foot, you see, without his ever noticing that he was being tied at all.  \"What's become of those noble high wages of yours?--I seem to have knocked the stuffing all out of them, it appears to me.\"  But if you will believe me, he merely looked surprised, that is all! he didn't grasp the situation at all, didn't know he had walked into a trap, didn't discover that he was _in_ a trap.  I could have shot him, from sheer vexation.  With cloudy eye and a struggling intellect he fetched this out:  \"Marry, I seem not to understand.  It is _proved_ that our wages be double thine; how then may it be that thou'st knocked therefrom the stuffing?--an miscall not the wonderly word, this being the first time under grace and providence of God it hath been granted me to hear it.\"  Well, I was stunned; partly with this unlooked-for stupidity on his part, and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with him and were of his mind--if you might call it mind.  My position was simple enough, plain enough; how could it ever be simplified more?  However, I must try:  \"Why, look here, brother Dowley, don't you see?  Your wages are merely higher than ours in _name_, not in _fact_.\"  \"Hear him!  They are the _double_--ye have confessed it yourself.\"  \"Yes-yes, I don't deny that at all.  But that's got nothing to do with it; the _amount_ of the wages in mere coins, with meaningless names attached to them to know them by, has got nothing to do with it.  The thing is, how much can you _buy_ with your wages? --that's the idea.  While it is true that with you a good mechanic is allowed about three dollars and a half a year, and with us only about a dollar and seventy-five--\"  \"There--ye're confessing it again, ye're confessing it again!\"  \"Confound it, I've never denied it, I tell you!  What I say is this.  With us _half_ a dollar buys more than a _dollar_ buys with you--and THEREFORE it stands to reason and the commonest kind of common-sense, that our wages are _higher_ than yours.\"  He looked dazed, and said, despairingly:  \"Verily, I cannot make it out.  Ye've just said ours are the higher, and with the same breath ye take it back.\"  \"Oh, great Scott, isn't it possible to"]]]
