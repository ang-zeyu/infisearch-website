He brought the horses dexterously into the road and quieted them.  “Aren't you going to get my coyote?” she ventured to ask.  “Certainly. The road swings back, down that same coulee, and we'll pass right by it. Then I'll get out and pick him up, while you hold the horses.”  “You'll hold those horses yourself,” returned Miss Whitmore, with considerable spirit. “I'd much rather pick up the coyote, thank you.”  Chip said nothing to this, whatever he may have thought. He drove up to the coyote with much coaxing of Pet and Polly, who eyed the gray object askance. Miss Whitmore sprang out and seized the animal by its coarse, bushy tail.  “Gracious, he's heavy!” she exclaimed, after one tug.  “He's been fattening up on Flying U calves,” remarked Chip, his foot upon the brake.  Miss Whitmore knelt and examined the cattle thief curiously.  “Look,” she said, “here's where I hit him the first time; the bullet took a diagonal course from the shoulder back to the other side. It must have gone within an inch of his heart, and would have finished him in a short time, without that other shot--that penetrated his brain, you see; death was instantaneous.”  Chip had taken advantage of the halt to roll a cigarette, holding the reins tightly between his knees while he did so. He passed the loose edge of the paper across the tip of his tongue, eying the young woman curiously the while.  “You seem to be pretty well onto your job,” he remarked, dryly.  “I ought to be,” she said, laughing a little. “I've been learning the trade ever since I was sixteen.”  “Yes? You began early.”  “My Uncle John is a doctor. I helped him in the office till he got me into the medical school. I was brought up in an atmosphere of antiseptics and learned all the bones in Uncle John's 'Boneparte'--the skeleton, you know--before I knew all my letters.” She dragged the coyote close to the wheel.  “Let me get hold of the tail.” Chip carefully pinched out the blaze of his match and threw it away before he leaned over to help. With a quick lift he landed the animal, limp and bloody, squarely upon the top of Miss Whitmore's largest trunk. The pointed nose hung down the side, the white fangs exposed in a sinister grin. The girl gazed upon him proudly at first, then in dismay.  “Oh, he's dripping blood all over my mandolin case--and I just know it won't come out!” She tugged frantically at the instrument.  “'Out, damned spot!'” quoted Chip in a sepulchral tone before he turned to assist her.  Miss Whitmore let go the mandolin and stared blankly up at him, and Chip, offended at her frank surprise that he should quote Shakespeare, shut his lips tightly and relapsed into silence.       CHAPTER II. -- Over the “Hog's Back.”    “That's Flying U ranch,” volunteered Chip, as they turned sharply to the right and began to descend a long grade built into the side of a steep, rocky bluff. Below them lay the ranch in a long, narrow coulee. Nearest them sprawled the house, low, white and roomy, with broad porches and wide windows; further down the coulee, at the base of a gentle slope, were the sheds, the high, round corrals and the haystacks. Great, board gates were distributed in seemingly useless profusion, while barbed wire fences stretched away in all directions. A small creek, bordered with cottonwoods and scraggly willows, wound aimlessly away down the coulee.  “J. G. doesn't seem to have much method,” remarked Miss Whitmore, after a critical survey. “What are all those log cabins scattered down the hill for? They look as though J. G. had a handful that he didn't want, and just threw them down toward the stable and left them lying where they happened to fall.”  “It does, all right,” conceded Chip. “They're the bunk house--where us fellows sleep--and the mess house, where we eat, and then come the blacksmith shop and a shack we keep all kinds of truck in, and--”  “What--in--the world--”  A chorus of shouts and shots arose from below. A scurrying group of horsemen burst over the hill behind the house, dashed half down the slope, and surrounded the bunk house with blood-curdling yells. Chip held the creams to a walk and furtively watched his companion. Miss Whitmore's eyes were very wide open; plainly, she was astonished beyond measure at the uproar. Whether she was also frightened, Chip could not determine.  The menacing yells increased in volume till the very hills seemed to cower in fear. Miss Whitmore gasped when a limp form was dragged from the cabin and lifted to the back of a snorting pony.  “They've got a rope around that man's neck,” she breathed, in a horrified half whisper. “Are--they--going to HANG him?”  “It kinda looks that way, from here,” said Chip, inwardly ashamed. All at once it struck him as mean and cowardly to frighten a lady who had traveled far among strangers and who had that tired droop to her mouth. It wasn't a fair game; it was cheating. Only for his promise to the boys, he would have told her the truth then and there.  Miss Whitmore was not a stupid young woman; his very indifference told her all that she needed to know. She tore her eyes from the confused jumble of gesticulating men and restive steeds to look sharply at Chip. He met her eyes squarely for an instant, and the horror oozed from her and left only amused chagrin that they should try to trick her so.  “Hurry up,” she commanded, “so I can be in at the death. Remember, I'm a doctor. They're tying him to his horse--he looks half dead with fright.”  Inwardly she added: “He overacts the part dreadfully.”  The little cavalcade in the coulee fired a spectacular volley into the air and swept down the slope like a dry-weather whirlwind across a patch of alkali ground. Through the big gate and up the road past the stables they thundered, the prisoner bound and helpless in their midst.  Then something happened. A wide-open River Press, flapping impotently in the embrace of a willow, caught the eye of Banjo, a little blaze--faced bay who bore the captive. He squatted, ducked backward so suddenly that his reins slipped from Slim's fingers and lowered his head between his white front feet. His rider seemed stupid beyond any that Banjo had ever known--and he had known many. Snorting and pitching, he was away before the valiant band realized what was happening in their midst. The prisoner swayed drunkenly in the saddle. At the third jump his hat flew off, disclosing the jagged end of a two-by-four.  The Happy Family groaned as one man and gave chase.  Banjo, with almost human maliciousness, was heading up the road straight toward Chip and the woman doctor--and she must be a poor doctor indeed, and a badly frightened one, withal, if she failed to observe a peculiarity in the horse thief's cranium.  Cal Emmett dug his spurs into his horse and shot by Slim like a locomotive, shouting profanity as he went.  “Head him into the creek,” yelled Happy Jack, and leaned low over the neck of his sorrel.  Weary Willie stood up in his stirrups and fanned Glory with his hat. “Yip, yee--e-e! Go to it, Banjo, old boy! Watch his nibs ride, would yuh? He's a broncho buster from away back.” Weary Willie was the only man of them all who appeared to find any enjoyment in the situation.  “If Chip only had the sense to slow up and give us a chance--or spill that old maid over the bank!” groaned Jack Bates, and plied whip and spur to overtake the runaway.  Now the captive was riding dizzily, head downward, frightening Banjo half out of his senses. What he had started as a grim jest, he now continued in deadly earnest; what was this uncanny semblance of a cow-puncher which he could not unseat, yet which clung so precariously to the saddle? He had no thought now of bucking in pure devilment--he was galloping madly, his eyes wild and staring.  Of a sudden, Chip saw danger lurking beneath the fun of it. He leaned forward a little, got a fresh grip on the reins and took the whip.  “Hang tight, now--I'm going to beat that horse to the Hog's Back.”  Miss Whitmore, laughing till the tears stood in her eyes, braced herself mechanically. Chip had been laughing also--but that was before Banjo struck into the hill road in his wild flight from the terror that rode in the saddle.  A smart flick of the whip upon their glossy backs, and the creams sprang forward at a run. The buggy was new and strong, and if they kept the road all would be well--unless they met Banjo upon the narrow ridge between two broad-topped knolls, known as the Hog's Back. Another tap, and the creams ran like deer. One wheel struck a cobble stone, and the buggy lurched horribly.  “Stop! There goes my coyote!” cried Miss Whitmore, as a gray object slid down under the hind wheel.  “Hang on or you'll go next,” was all the comfort she got, as Chip braced himself for the struggle before him. The Hog's Back was reached, but Banjo was pounding up the hill beyond, his nostrils red and flaring, his sides reeking with perspiration. Behind him tore the Flying U boys in a vain effort to head him back into the coulee before mischief was done.  Chip drew his breath sharply when the creams swerved out upon the broad hilltop, just as Banjo thundered past with nothing left of his rider but the legs, and with them shorn of their plumpness as the hay dribbled out upon the road.  A fresh danger straightway forced itself upon Chip's consciousness. The creams, maddened by the excitement, were running away. He held them sternly to the road and left the stopping of them to Providence, inwardly thanking the Lord that Miss Whitmore did not seem to be the screaming kind of woman.  The “vigilantes” drew hastily out of the road and scudded out of sight down a gully as the creams lunged down the steep grade and across the shallow creek bed. Fortunately the great gate by the stable swung wide open and they galloped through and up the long slope "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9297"],["title","The Orange-Yellow Diamond (#1)"],["body"," its owner's hand.  \"You go round into Praed Street, mister,\" he said, in business-like fashion. \"You'll see a shop there with Daniel Multenius over it. He's a relation o' mine--he'll do what you want. Mention my name, if you like. He'll deal fair with you. And if you ever want to sell, don't forget me.\"  Lauriston laughed, and went down the stairs, and out into the dismal evening. It was only a step round to Praed Street, and within five minutes of leaving Melky he was looking into Daniel Multenius's window. He remembered now that he had often looked into it, without noticing the odd name above it. It was a window in which there were all sorts of curious things, behind a grille of iron bars, from diamonds and pearls to old ivory and odds and ends of bric-à-brac. A collector of curiosities would have found material in that window to delay him for half-an-hour--but Lauriston only gave one glance at it before hastening down a dark side-passage to a door, over which was a faintly-illuminated sign, showing the words: PLEDGE OFFICE.  He pushed open that door and found himself before several small, boxed-off compartments, each just big enough to contain one person. They were all empty at that moment; he entered one, and seeing nobody about, tapped gently on the counter. He expected to see some ancient and Hebraic figure present itself--instead, light steps came from some recess of the shop, and Lauriston found himself gazing in surprise at a young and eminently pretty girl, who carried some fancy needle-work in her hand, and looked over it at him out of a pair of large, black eyes. For a moment the two gazed at each other, in silence.  \"Yes?\" said the girl at last. \"What can I do for you?\"  Lauriston found his tongue.  \"Er--is Mr. Multenius in?\" he asked. \"I--the fact is, I want to see him.\"  \"Mr. Multenius is out,\" answered the girl. \"But I'm in charge--if it's business.\"  She was quietly eyeing Lauriston over, and she saw his fresh-complexioned face colour vividly.  \"I do my grandfather's business when he's out,\" she continued. \"Do you want to borrow some money?\"  Lauriston pulled out the watch, with more blushes, and pushed it towards her.  \"That's just it,\" he answered. \"I want to borrow money on that. A friend of mine--fellow-lodger--Mr. Melky Rubinstein--said I could borrow something here. That's a real good watch, you know.\"  The girl glanced at her customer with a swift and almost whimsical recognition of his innocence, and almost carelessly picked up the watch.  \"Oh, Melky sent you here, did he?\" she said, with a smile. \"I see!\" She looked the watch over, and snapped open the case. Then she glanced at Lauriston. \"How much do you want on this?\" she asked.    CHAPTER TWO   MRS. GOLDMARK'S EATING-HOUSE  Lauriston thrust his hands in his pockets and looked at the girl in sheer perplexity. She was a very pretty, dark girl, nearly as tall as himself, slender and lissom of figure, and decidedly attractive. There was evident sense of fun and humour in her eyes, and about the corners of her lips: he suddenly got an idea that she was amused at his embarrassment.  \"How much can you lend me?\" he asked. \"What--what's it worth?\"  \"No, that's not it!\" she answered. \"It's--what do you want to borrow? You're not used to pledging things, are you?\"  \"No,\" replied Lauriston. \"This is the first time. Can--can you lend me a few pounds?\"  The girl picked up the watch again, and again, examined it.  \"I'll lend you three pounds fifteen on it,\" she said suddenly, in business-like tones. \"That do?\"  \"Thank you,\" replied Lauriston. \"That'll do very well--I'm much obliged. I suppose I can have it back any time.\"  \"Any time you bring the money, and pay the interest,\" replied the girl. \"Within twelve calendar months and seven days.\" She picked up a pen and began to fill out a ticket. \"Got any copper?\" she asked presently.  \"Copper?\" exclaimed Lauriston. \"What for?\"  \"The ticket,\" she answered. Then she gave him a quick glance and just as quickly looked down again. \"Never mind!\" she said. \"I'll take it out of the loan. Your name and address, please.\"  Lauriston presently took the ticket and the little pile of gold, silver, and copper which she handed him. And he lingered.  \"You'll take care of that watch,\" he said, suddenly. \"It was my father's, you see.\"  The girl smiled, reassuringly, and pointed to a heavily-built safe in the rear.  \"We've all sorts of family heirlooms in there,\" she observed. \"Make yourself easy.\"  Lauriston thanked her, raised his hat, and turned away--unwillingly. He would have liked an excuse to stop longer--and he did not quite know why. But he could think of none, so he went--with a backward look when he got to the door. The pretty pawnbroker smiled and nodded. And the next moment he was out in the street, with money in his pocket, and a strange sense of relief, which was mingled with one of surprise. For he had lived for the previous four days on a two-shilling piece--and there, all the time, close by him, had been a place where you could borrow money, easily and very pleasantly.  His first thought was to hurry to his lodgings and pay his landlady. He owed her six weeks' rent, at ten shillings a week--that would take three pounds out of the money he had just received. But he would still have over fourteen shillings to be going on with--and surely those expected letters would come within the next few postal deliveries. He had asked the editor who had taken two short stories from him to let him have a cheque for them, and in his inexperience had expected to see it arrive by return of post. Also he had put his pride in his pocket, and had written a long letter to his old schoolmate, John Purdie, in far-away Scotland, explaining his present circumstances, and asking him, for old times' sake, to lend him some money until he had finished and sold a novel, which, he was sure, would turn out to be a small gold-mine. John Purdie, he knew, was now a wealthy young man--successor to his father in a fine business; Lauriston felt no doubt that he would respond. And meantime, till the expected letters came, he had money--and when you have lived for four days on two shillings, fourteen shillings seems a small fortune. Certainly, within the last half-hour, life had taken on a roseate tinge--all due to a visit to the pawnshop.  Hurrying back along Praed Street, Lauriston's steps were suddenly arrested. He found himself unconsciously hurrying by an old-fashioned eating-house, from whence came an appetizing odour of cooking food. He remembered then that he had eaten nothing for four-and-twenty hours. His landlady supplied him with nothing: ever since he had gone to her he had done his own catering, going out for his meals. The last meal, on the previous evening, had been a glass of milk and a stale, though sizable bun, and now he felt literally ravenous. It was only by an effort that he could force himself to pass the eating-house; once beyond its door, he ran, ran until he reached his lodgings and slipped three sovereigns into Mrs. Flitwick's hands.  \"That'll make us right to this week end, Mrs. Flitwick,\" he said. \"Put the receipt in my room.\"  \"And greatly obliged I am to you, Mr. Lauriston,\" answered the landlady. \"And sorry, indeed, you should have had to put yourself to the trouble, but--\"  \"All right, all right--no trouble--no trouble at all,\" exclaimed Lauriston. \"Quite easy, I assure you!\"  He ran out of the house again and back to where he knew there was food. He was only one-and-twenty, a well-built lad, with a healthy appetite, which, until very recently, had always been satisfied, and just then he was feeling that unless he ate and drank, something--he knew not what--would happen. He was even conscious that his voice was weakening, when, having entered the eating-house and dropped into a seat in one of the little boxes into which the place was divided, he asked the waitress for the food and drink which he was now positively aching for. And he had eaten a plateful of fish and two boiled eggs and several thick slices of bread and butter, and drunk the entire contents of a pot of tea before he even lifted his eyes to look round him. But by that time he was conscious of satisfaction, and he sat up and inspected the place to which he had hurried so eagerly. And in the same moment he once more saw Melky.  Melky had evidently just entered the little eating-house. Evidently, too, he was in no hurry for food or drink. He had paused, just within the entrance, at a desk which stood there, whereat sat Mrs. Goldmark, the proprietress, a plump, pretty young woman, whose dark, flashing eyes turned alternately from watching her waitresses to smiling on her customers as they came to the desk to pay their bills. Melky, his smart billy-cock hat cocked to one side, his sporting-looking overcoat adorned with a flower, was evidently paying compliments to Mrs. Goldmark as he leaned over her desk: she gave him a playful push and called to a waitress to order Mr. Rubinstein a nice steak. And Melky, turning from her with a well satisfied smile, caught sight of Lauriston, and sauntered down to the table at which he sat.  \"Get your bit of business done all right?\" he asked, confidentially, as he took a seat opposite his fellow-lodger and bent towards him. \"Find the old gent accommodating?\"  \"I didn't see him,\" answered Lauriston. \"I saw a young lady.\"  \"My cousin Zillah,\" said Melky. \"Smart girl, that, mister--worth a pile o' money to the old man--she knows as much about the business as what he does! You wouldn't think, mister,\" he went on in his soft, lisping tones, \"but that girl's had a college education--fact! Old Daniel, he took her to live with him when her father and mother died, she being a little 'un then, and he give her--ah, such an education as I wish I'd had--see? She's quite the lady--is Zillah--but sticks to the old shop--not half, neither!\"  \"She seems very business-like,\" remarked Lauriston, secretly pleased that he had now"]]]
