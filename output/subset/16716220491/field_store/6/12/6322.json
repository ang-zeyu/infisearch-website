It is my misfortune seldom to fructify, in a regular way, by any but printed sermons.  The first strong idea, which the preacher utters, gives birth to a train of thought, and leads me onward, step by step, quite out of hearing of the good man's voice, unless he be indeed a son of thunder.  At my open window, catching now and then a sentence of the \"parson's saw,\" I am as well situated as at the foot of the pulpit stairs.  The broken and scattered fragments of this one discourse will be the texts of many sermons, preached by those  colleague pastors,--colleagues, but often disputants,--my Mind and Heart.  The former pretends to be a  scholar, and perplexes me with doctrinal points; the latter takes me on the score of feeling; and both, like several other preachers, spend their strength to very little purpose. I, their sole auditor, cannot always understand them.  Suppose that a few hours have passed, and behold me still behind my curtain, just before the close of the afternoon service.  The hour-hand on the dial has passed beyond four o'clock.  The declining sun is hidden behind the steeple, and throws its shadow straight across the street, so that my chamber is darkened, as with a cloud.  Around the church-door all is solitude, and an impenetrable obscurity beyond the threshold.  A commotion is heard.  The seats are slammed down, and the pew-doors thrown back,--a multitude of feet are trampling along the unseen aisles,--and the congregation bursts suddenly through the portal.  Foremost, scampers a rabble of boys, behind whom moves a dense and dark phalanx of grown men, and lastly, a crowd of females, with young children, and a few scattered husbands.  This instantaneous outbreak of life into loneliness is one of the pleasantest scenes of the day.  Some of the good people are rubbing their eyes, thereby intimating that they have been wrapped, as it were, in a sort of holy trance, by the fervor of their devotion.  There is a young man, a third-rate coxcomb, whose first care is always to flourish a white handkerchief, and brush the seat of a tight pair of black silk pantaloons, which shine as if varnished.  They must have been made of the stuff called \"everlasting,\" or perhaps of the same piece as Christian's garments in the Pilgrim's Progress, for he put them on two summers ago, and has not yet worn the gloss off.  I have taken a great liking to those black silk pantaloons.  But, now, with nods and greetings among friends, each matron takes her husband's arm, and paces gravely homeward, while the girls also flutter away, after arranging sunset walks with their favored bachelors.  The Sabbath eve is the eve of love.  At length, the whole congregation is dispersed.  No; here, with faces as glossy as black satin, come two sable ladies and a sable gentleman, and close in their rear the minister, who softens his severe visage, and bestows a kind word on each.  Poor souls!  To them the most captivating picture of bliss in heaven is--\"There we shall be white!\"  All is solitude again.  But, hark!--a broken warbling of voices, and now, attuning its grandeur to their sweetness, a stately peal of the organ. Who are the choristers?  Let me dream that the angels, who came down from heaven, this blessed morn, to blend themselves with the worship of the truly good, are playing and singing their farewell to the earth.  On the wings of that rich melody they were borne upward.  This, gentle reader, is merely a flight of poetry.  A few of the singing men and singing women had lingered behind their fellows, and raised their voices fitfully, and blew a careless note upon the organ.  Yet, it lifted my soul higher than all their former strains.  They are gone, the sons and daughters of music,--and the gray sexton is just closing the portal.  For six days more, there will be no face of man in the pews, and aisles, and galleries, nor a voice in the pulpit, nor music in the choir.  Was it worth while to rear this massive edifice, to be a desert in the heart of the town, and populous only for a few hours of each seventh day?  O, but the church is a symbol of religion!  May its site, which was consecrated on the day when the first tree was felled, be kept holy forever, a spot of solitude and peace, amid the trouble and vanity of our week-day world! There is a moral, and a religion too, even in the silent walls.  And may the steeple still point heavenward, and be decked with the hallowed sunshine of the Sabbath morn!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9202"],["title","Little Annie's Ramble (From \"Twice Told Tales\") (#1)"],["body","yellow cat upon a window-sill, a very corpulent and comfortable cat, gazing at this transitory world, with owl's eyes, and making pithy comments, doubtless, or what appear such, to the silly beast.  O sage puss, make room for me beside you, and we will be a pair of philosophers!  Here we see something to remind us of the town crier, and his ding-dong bell!  Look! look at that great cloth spread out in the air, pictured all over with wild beasts, as if they had met together to choose a king, according to their custom in the days of AEsop.  But they are choosing neither a king nor a president; else we should hear a most horrible snarling!  They have come from the deep woods, and the wild mountains, and the desert sands, and the polar snows, only to do homage to my little Annie.  As we enter among them, the great elephant makes us a bow, in the best style of elephantine courtesy, bending lowly down his mountain bulk, with trunk abased, and leg thrust out behind.  Annie returns the salute, much to the gratification of the elephant, who is certainly the best-bred monster in the caravan.  The lion and the lioness are busy with two beef-bones.  The royal tiger, the beautiful, the untamable, keeps pacing his narrow cage with a haughty step, unmindful of the spectators, or recalling the fierce deeds of his former life, when he was wont to leap forth upon such inferior animals, from the jungles of Bengal. Here we see the very same wolf,--do not go near him, Annie!--the self-same wolf that devoured little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother. In the next cage, a hyena from Egypt, who has doubtless howled around the pyramids, and a black bear from our own forests are fellow-prisoners, and most excellent friends.  Are there any two living creatures who have so few sympathies that they cannot possibly be friends?  Here sits a great white bear, whom common observers would call a very stupid beast, though I perceive him to be only absorbed in contemplation; he is thinking of his voyages on an iceberg, and of his comfortable home in the vicinity of the north pole, and of the little cubs whom he left rolling in the eternal snows.  In fact, he is a bear of sentiment.  But, O, those unsentimental monkeys the ugly, grinning, aping, chattering, ill-natured, mischievous, and queer little brutes.  Annie does not love the monkeys. Their ugliness shocks her pure, instinctive delicacy of taste, and makes her mind unquiet, because it bears a wild and dark resemblance to humanity. But here is a little pony, just big enough for Annie to ride, and round and round he gallops in a circle, keeping time with his trampling hoofs to a band of music.  And here,--with a laced coat and a cocked hat, and a riding whip in his hand,--here comes a little gentleman, small enough to be king of the fairies, and ugly enough to be king of the gnomes, and takes a flying leap into the saddle.  Merrily, merrily plays the music, and merrily gallops the pony, and merrily rides the little old gentleman.  Come, Annie, into the street again; perchance we may see monkeys on horseback there!  Mercy on us, what a noisy world we quiet people live in!  Did Annie ever read the Cries of London City? With what lusty lungs doth yonder man proclaim that his wheelbarrow is full of lobsters!  Here comes another mounted on a cart, and blowing a hoarse and dreadful blast from a tin horn, as much as to say, \"Fresh fish!\"  And hark! a voice on high, like that of a muezzin from the summit of a mosque, announcing that some chimney-sweeper has emerged from smoke and soot, and darksome caverns, into the upper air.  What cares the world for that?  But, well-a-day, we hear a shrill voice of affliction, the scream of a little child, rising louder with every repetition of that smart, sharp, slapping sound, produced by an open hand on tender flesh. Annie sympathizes, though without experience of such direful woe.  Lo! the town crier again, with some new secret for the public ear.  Will he tell us of an auction, or of a lost pocketbook, or a show of beautiful wax figures, or of some monstrous beast more horrible than any in the caravan?  I guess the latter.  See how he uplifts the bell in his right hand, and shakes it slowly at first, then with a hurried motion, till the clapper seems to strike both sides at once, and the sounds are scattered forth in quick succession, far and near.  Ding-dong!  Ding-dong!  Ding-dong!  Now he raises his clear, loud voice, above all the din of the town; it drowns the buzzing talk of many tongues, and draws each man's mind from his own business; it rolls up and down the echoing street and ascends to the hushed chamber of the sick, and penetrates downward to the cellar kitchen, where the hot cook turns from the fire to listen.  Who, of all that address the public ear, whether in church, or court-house, or hall of state, has such an attentive audience as the town crier?  What saith the people's orator?  \"Strayed from her home, a LITTLE GIRL, of five years old, in a blue silk frock and white pantalets, with brown curling hair and hazel eyes. Whoever will bring her back to her afflicted mother--\"  Stop, stop, town crier!  The lost is found.  O, my pretty Annie, we forgot to tell your mother of our ramble, and she is in despair, and has sent the town crier to bellow up and down the streets, afrighting old and young, for the loss of a little girl who has not once let go my hand! Well, let us hasten homeward; and as we go, forget not to thank Heaven, my Annie, that, after wandering a little way into the world, you may return at the first summons, with an untainted and unwearied heart, and be a happy child again.  But I have gone too far astray for the town crier to call me back.  Sweet has been the charm of childhood on my spirit, throughout my ramble with little Annie!  Say not that it has been a waste of precious moments, an idle matter, a babble of childish talk, and a revery of childish imaginations, about topics unworthy of a grown man's notice.  Has it been merely this?  Not so; not so.  They are not truly wise who would affirm it.  As the pure breath of children revives the life of aged men, so is our moral nature revived by their free and simple thoughts, their native feeling, their airy mirth, for little cause or none, their grief, soon roused and soon allayed.  Their influence on us is at least reciprocal with ours on them.  When our infancy is almost forgotten, and our boyhood long departed, though it seems but as yesterday; when life settles darkly down upon us, and we doubt whether to call ourselves young any more, then it is good to steal away from the society of bearded men, and even of gentler woman, and spend an hour or two with children.  After drinking from those fountains of still fresh existence, we shall return into the crowd, as I do now, to struggle onward and do our part in life, perhaps as fervently as ever, but, for a time, with a kinder and purer heart, and a spirit more lightly wise.  All this by thy sweet magic, dear little Annie!"]]]
