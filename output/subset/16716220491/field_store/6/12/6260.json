You didn't think I was going to steal them, did you?\"  The young man laughed, and drew her into a quiet corner of the Gardens of the Tuileries.  \"I will not have time to go with you to the Rue de Lille to-night,\" he said.  \"But you will come as usual to-morrow night?\" she asked, anxiously.  \"Certainly, certainly.\" he replied, as he rapidly concealed the packages in his pockets.  The next night the girl waited patiently for her lover at the corner where they were in the habit of meeting, but he did not come. She stood under the glaring light of a lamp-post so that he would recognize her at once. Many people accosted her as she stood there, but she answered none, looking straight before her with clear honest eyes, and they passed on after a moment's hesitation. At last she saw a man running rapidly down the street, and as he passed a brilliantly-lighted window she recognized Jean. He came quickly towards her.  \"Here I am,\" she cried, running forward. She caught him by the arm, saying, \"Oh, Jean, what is the matter?\"  He shook her rudely, and shouted at her--\"Let me go, you fool!\" But she clung to him, until he raised his fist and struck her squarely in the face. Lurine staggered against the wall, and Jean ran on. A stalwart man who had spoken to Lurine a few moments before, and, not understanding her silence, stood in a doorway near watching her, sprang out when he saw the assault, and thrust his stick between the feet of the flying man, flinging him face forward on the pavement. The next instant he placed his foot upon Jean's neck holding him down as if he were a snake.  \"You villain!\" he cried. \"Strike a woman, would you?\"  Jean lay there as if stunned, and two gens d'armes came pantingly upon the scene.  \"This scoundrel,\" said the man, \"has just assaulted a woman. I saw him.\"  \"He has done more than that,\" said one of the officers, grimly, as if, after all, the striking of a woman was but a trivial affair.  They secured the young man, and dragged him with them. The girl came up to them and said, falteringly--  \"It is all a mistake, it was an accident. He didn't mean to do it.\"  \"Oh, he didn't, and pray how do you know?\" asked one of the officers.  \"You little devil,\" said Jean to the girl, through his clinched teeth, \"it's all your fault.\"  The officers hurried him off.  \"I think,\" said one, \"that we should have arrested the girl; you heard what she said.\"  \"Yes,\" said the other, \"but we have enough on our hands now, if the crowd find out who he is.\"  Lurine thought of following them, but she was so stunned by the words that her lover had said to her, rather than by the blow he had given her that she turned her steps sadly towards the Pont Royal and went to her room.  The next morning she did not go through the gardens, as usual, to her work, and when she entered the Pharmacie de Siam, the proprietor cried out, \"Here she is, the vixen! Who would have thought it of her? You wretch, you stole my drugs to give to that villain!\"  \"I did not,\" said Lurine, stoutly. \"I put the money in the till for them.\"  \"Hear her! She confesses!\" said the proprietor.  The two concealed officers stepped forward and arrested her where she stood as the accomplice of Jean Duret, who, the night before, had flung a bomb in the crowded Avenue de l'Op√©ra.  Even the prejudiced French judges soon saw that the girl was innocent of all evil intent, and was but the victim of the scoundrel who passed by the name of Jean Duret. He was sentenced for life; she was set free. He had tried to place the blame on her, like the craven he was, to shield another woman. This was what cut Lurine to the heart. She might have tried to find an excuse for his crime, but she realized that he had never cared for her, and had but used her as his tool to get possession of the chemicals he dared not buy.  In the drizzling rain she walked away from her prison, penniless, and broken in body and in spirit. She passed the little Pharmacie de Siam, not daring to enter. She walked in the rain along the Rue des Pyramides, and across the Rue de Rivoli, and into the Tuileries Gardens. She had forgotten about her stone woman, but, unconsciously her steps were directed to her. She looked up at her statue with amazement, at first not recognizing it. It was no longer the statue of a smiling woman. The head was thrown back, the eyes closed. The last mortal agony was on the face. It was a ghastly monument to Death. The girl was so perplexed by the change in her statue that for the moment she forgot the ruin of her own life. She saw that the smiling face was but a mask, held in place by the curving of the left arm over it. Life, she realized now, was made up of tragedy and comedy, and he who sees but the smiling face, sees but the half of life. The girl hurried on to the bridge, sobbing quietly to herself, and looked down at the grey river water. The passers-by paid no attention to her. Why, she wondered, had she ever thought the river cold and cruel and merciless? It is the only home of the homeless, the only lover that does not change. She turned back to the top of the flight of steps which lead down, to the water's brink. She looked toward the Tuileries Gardens, but she could not see her statue for the trees which intervened. \"I, too, will be a woman of stone,\" she said, as she swiftly descended the steps.     THE CHEMISTRY OF ANARCHY.   It has been said in the London papers that the dissolution of the Soho Anarchist League was caused by want of funds. This is very far from being the case. An Anarchist League has no need for funds and so long as there is money enough to buy beer the League is sure of continued existence. The truth about the scattering of the Soho organization was told me by a young newspaper-man who was chairman at the last meeting.  The young man was not an anarchist, though he had to pretend to be one in the interests of his paper, and so joined the Soho League, where he made some fiery speeches that were much applauded. At last Anarchist news became a drug in the market, and the editor of the paper young Marshall Simkins belonged to, told him that he would now have to turn his attention to Parliamentary work, as he would print no more Anarchist news in the sheet.  One might think that young Simkins would have been glad to get rid of his anarchist work, as he had no love for the cause. He was glad to get rid of it, but he found some difficulty in sending in his resignation. The moment he spoke of resigning, the members became suspicious of him. He had always been rather better dressed than the others, and, besides, he drank less beer. If a man wishes to be in good standing in the League he must not be fastidious as to dress, and he must be constructed to hold at least a gallon of beer at a sitting. Simkins was merely a \"quart\" man, and this would have told against him all along if it had not been for the extra gunpowder he put in his speeches. On several occasions seasoned Anarchists had gathered about him and begged him to give up his designs on the Parliament buildings.  The older heads claimed that, desirable as was the obliteration of the Houses of Parliament, the time was not yet ripe for it. England, they pointed out, was the only place where Anarchists could live and talk unmolested, so, while they were quite anxious that Simkins should go and blow up Vienna, Berlin, or Paris, they were not willing for him to begin on London. Simkins was usually calmed down with much difficulty, and finally, after hissing \"Cowards!\" two or three times under his breath, he concluded with, \"Oh, very well, then, you know better than I do--I am only a young recruit; but allow me at least to blow up Waterloo Bridge, or spring a bomb in Fleet Street just to show that we are up and doing.\"  But this the Anarchists would not sanction. If he wanted to blow up bridges, he could try his hand on those across the Seine. They had given their word that there would be no explosions in London so long as England afforded them an asylum.  \"But look at Trafalgar Square,\" cried Simkins angrily; \"we are not allowed to meet there.\"  \"Who wants to meet there?\" said the chairman. \"It is ever so much more comfortable in these rooms, and there is no beer in Trafalgar Square.\" \"Yes, yes,\" put in several others; \"the time is not yet ripe for it.\" Thus was Simkins calmed down, and beer allowed to flow again in tranquillity, while some foreign Anarchist, who was not allowed to set foot in his native country, would get up and harangue the crowd in broken English and tell them what great things would yet be done by dynamite.  But when Simkins sent in his resignation a change came over their feelings towards him, and he saw at once that he was a marked man. The chairman, in a whisper, advised him to withdraw his resignation. So Simkins, who was a shrewd young fellow, understanding the temper of the assembly, arose and said:--  \"I have no desire to resign, but you do nothing except talk, and I want to belong to an Anarchist Society that acts.\" He stayed away from the next meeting, and tried to drop them in that way, but a committee from the League called upon him at his lodgings, and his landlady thought that young Simkins had got into bad ways when he had such evil-looking men visiting him.  Simkins was in a dilemma, and could not make up his mind what to do. The Anarchists apparently were not to be shaken off. He applied to his editor for advice on the situation, but that good man could think of no way out of the trouble.  \"You ought to have known better,\" he said, \"than to mix up with such people.\"  \"But how was I to get the news?\" asked Simkins, with some indignation. The editor shrugged his shoulders. That was not his part of the business; and if the Anarchists chose to make"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8681"],["title","The Face and the Mask (#2)"],["body","uncomfortable for the young man, he could not help it.  Simkins' fellow-lodger, a student who was studying chemistry in London, noticed that the reporter was becoming gaunt with anxiety.  \"Simkins,\" said Sedlitz to him one morning, \"you are haggard and careworn: what is the matter with you? Are you in love, or is it merely debt that is bothering you?\"  \"Neither,\" replied Simkins.  \"Then cheer up,\" said Sedlitz. \"If one or the other is not interfering with you, anything else is easily remedied.\"  \"I am not so sure of that,\" rejoined Simkins; and then he sat down and told his friend just what was troubling him.  \"Ah,\" said Sedlitz, \"that accounts for it. There has been an unkempt ruffian marching up and down watching this house. They are on your track, Simkins, my boy, and when they discover that you are a reporter, and therefore necessarily a traitor, you will be nabbed some dark night.\"  \"Well, that's encouraging,\" said Simkins, with his head in his hands.  \"Are these Anarchists brave men, and would they risk their lives in any undertaking?\" asked Sedlitz.  \"Oh, I don't know. They talk enough, but I don't know what they would do. They are quite capable, though, of tripping me up in a dark lane.\"  \"Look here,\" said Sedlitz, \"suppose you let me try a plan. Let me give them a lecture on the Chemistry of Anarchy. It's a fascinating subject.\"  \"What good would that do?\"  \"Oh, wait till you have heard the lecture. If I don't make the hair of some of them stand on end, they are braver men than I take them to be. We have a large room in Clement's Inn, where we students meet to try experiments and smoke tobacco. It is half club, and half a lecture- room. Now, I propose to get those Anarchists in there, lock the doors, and tell them something about dynamite and other explosives. You give out that I am an Anarchist from America. Tell them that the doors will be locked to prevent police interference, and that there will be a barrel of beer. You can introduce me as a man from America, where they know as much about Anarchism in ten minutes as they do here in ten years. Tell them that I have spent my life in the study of explosives. I will have to make-up a little, but you know that I am a very good amateur actor, and I don't think there will be any trouble about that. At the last you must tell them that you have an appointment and will leave me to amuse them for a couple of hours.\"  \"But I don't see what good it is all going to do, though I am desperate,\" said Simkins, \"and willing to try anything. I have thought some of firing a bomb off myself at an Anarchist meeting.\"  When the Friday night of meeting arrived the large hall in Clement's Inn was filled to the doors. Those assembled there saw a platform at one end of the apartment, and a door that led from it to a room at the back of the hall. A table was on the platform, and boxes, chemical apparatus, and other scientific-looking paraphernalia were on it. At the hour of eight young Simkins appeared before the table alone.  \"Fellow Anarchists,\" he said, \"you are well aware that I am tired of the great amount of talk we indulge in, and the little action which follows it. I have been fortunate enough to secure the co-operation of an Anarchist from America, who will tell you something of the cause there. We have had the doors locked, and those who keep the keys are now down at the entrance of the Inn, so that if a fire should occur, they can quickly come and let us out. There is no great danger of fire, however, but the interruption of the police must be guarded against very carefully. The windows, as you see, are shuttered and barred, and no ray of light can penetrate from this room outside. Until the lecture is over no one can leave the room, and by the same token no one can enter it, which is more to the purpose.  \"My friend, Professor Josiah P. Slivers, has devoted his life to the Chemistry of Anarchy, which is the title of this lecture. He will tell you of some important discoveries, which are now to be made known for the first time. I regret to say that the Professor is not in a very good state of health, because the line of life which he has adopted has its drawbacks. His left eye has been blown away by a premature explosion during his experiments. His right leg is also permanently disabled. His left arm, as you will notice, is in a sling, having been injured by a little disaster in his workshop since he came to London. He is a man, as you will see, devoted body and soul to the cause, so I hope you will listen to him attentively. I regret that I am unable to remain with you to-night, having other duties to perform which are imperative. I will therefore, if you will permit me, leave by the back entrance after I have introduced the Professor to you.\"  At this moment the stumping of a wooden leg was heard, and those in the audience saw appear a man on crutches, with one arm in a sling and a bandage over an eye, although he beamed upon them benevolently with the other.  \"Fellow Anarchists,\" said Simkins, \"allow me to introduce to you Professor Josiah P. Slivers, of the United States.\"  The Professor bowed and the audience applauded. As soon as the applause began the Professor held up his unmaimed arm and said, \"Gentlemen, I beg that you will not applaud.\"  It seems the fashion in America to address a11 sorts and conditions of men as \"Gentlemen.\"  The Professor continued, \"I have here some explosives so sensitive that the slightest vibration will cause them to go off, and I therefore ask you to listen in silence to what I have to say. I must particularly ask you also not to stamp on the floor.\"  Before these remarks were concluded Simkins had slipped out by the back entrance, and somehow his desertion seemed to have a depressing effect upon the company, who looked upon the broken-up Professor with eyes of wonder and apprehension.  The Professor drew towards him one of the boxes and opened the lid. He dipped his one useful hand into the box and, holding it aloft, allowed something which looked like wet sawdust to drip through his fingers. \"That, gentlemen,\" he said, with an air of the utmost contempt, \"is what is known to the world as dynamite. I have nothing at all to say against dynamite. It has, in its day, been a very powerful medium through which our opinions have been imparted to a listening world, but its day is past. It is what the lumbering stage-coach is to the locomotive, what the letter is to the telegram, what the sailing-vessel is to the steamship. It will be my pleasant duty to-night to exhibit to you an explosive so powerful and deadly that hereafter, having seen what it can accomplish, you will have nothing but derision for such simple and harmless compounds as dynamite and nitro-glycerine.\"  The Professor looked with kindly sympathy over his audience as he allowed the yellow mixture to percolate slowly through his fingers back into the box again. Ever and anon he took up a fresh handful and repeated the action.  The Anarchists in the audience exchanged uneasy glances one with the other.  \"Yet,\" continued the Professor, \"it will be useful for us to consider this substance for a few moments, if but for the purpose of comparison. Here,\" he said, diving his hand into another box and bringing up before their gaze a yellow brick, \"is dynamite in a compressed form. There is enough here to wreck all this part of London, were it exploded. This simple brick would lay St. Paul's Cathedral in ruins, so, however antiquated dynamite may become, we must always look upon it with respect, just as we look upon reformers of centuries ago who perished for their opinions, even though their opinions were far behind what ours are now. I shall take the liberty of performing some experiments with this block of dynamite.\" Saying which the Professor, with his free arm, flung the block of dynamite far down the aisle, where it fell on the floor with a sickening thud. The audience sprang from their seats and tumbled back one over the other. A wild shriek went up into the air, but the Professor gazed placidly on the troubled mob below him with a superior smile on his face. \"I beg you to seat yourselves,\" he said, \"and for reasons which I have already explained, I trust that you will not applaud any of my remarks. You have just now portrayed one of the popular superstitions about dynamite, and you show by your actions how necessary a lecture of this sort is in order that you may comprehend thoroughly the substance with which you have to deal. That brick is perfectly harmless, because it is frozen. Dynamite in its frozen state will not explode--a fact well understood by miners and all those who have to work with it, and who, as a rule, generally prefer to blow themselves to pieces trying to thaw the substance before a fire. Will you kindly bring that brick back to me, before it thaws out in the heated atmosphere of this room?\"  One of the men stepped gingerly forward and picked up the brick, holding it far from his body, as he tip-toed up to the platform, where he laid it down carefully on the desk before the Professor.  \"Thank you,\" said the Professor, blandly.  The man drew a long breath of relief as he went back to his seat.  \"That is frozen dynamite,\" continued the Professor, \"and is, as I have said, practically harmless. Now, it will be my pleasure to perform two startling experiments with the unfrozen substance,\" and with that he picked up a handful of the wet sawdust and flung it on a small iron anvil that stood on the table. \"You will enjoy these experiments,\" he said, \"because it will show you with what ease dynamite may be handled. It is a popular error that concussion will cause dynamite to explode. There is enough dynamite here to blow up this hall and to send into oblivion every person in it, yet you will see whether or not concussion will explode it.\" The Professor seized a hammer and struck the substance on the anvil two or three sharp blows, while those in front of him"]]]
