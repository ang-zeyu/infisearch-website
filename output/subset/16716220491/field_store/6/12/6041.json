And he was sent out here to get him out of the zone of danger, and now he's been nipped?\"  The boys looked at Ned with redoubled interest. It had been interesting, the very idea of going into the mountains in quest of an abducted child, but the thought of going after a boy who would one day be a king! That was exciting indeed!  \"I can't tell you who the boy is.\" Ned went on, \"but I can tell you that he must be found! The Secret Service men at Washington have a pretty good idea as to who got him, and they believe the criminals are not above committing the crime of murder. In a certain sense, this boy is in the way in the old country!\"  \"Oh, they wouldn't kill a kid like that!\" Jimmie asserted.  \"Wouldn't they?\" demanded Teddy Green. \"If you read up on history, you'll soon find out whether ambitious men will murder children who stand in their way! I half believe the boy was murdered at the very moment he was taken!\"  \"He has been seen alive since that time,\" Ned responded. \"This is Thursday. He was taken on Monday, and was seen yesterday. Or a boy believed to be the prince was seen yesterday, on a launch on the Potomac river.\"  \"Prince, eh?\" cried Frank. \"It is a prince, is it? Say, but won't dad be glad to hear about this? I'd like to write the headlines!\"  \"We may as well call him the prince,\" Ned laughed.  Before more could be said, a servant knocked at the door and Jack opened it so as to look out. In a moment he turned back inside with a flushed face.  \"Say, boys,\" he said, \"there's something strange going on here to-night!\"     CHAPTER II  THE HOLE IN THE ATTIC FLOOR   Ned sprang to his feet in an instant and beckoned Jack to one side. The others gathered around, but Ned motioned them back.  \"Let us find out exactly what Jack means before any remarks are made,\" he said.  \"Well,\" Jack began, almost in a whisper, \"the servant who came to the door said--\"  \"Wait a moment!\" Ned requested. \"Let us get this at first hand. Is the servant you refer to still out in the corridor? Look and see.\"  Jack opened the door an inch and looked out.  \"Yes,\" he reported, facing Ned, with the door still ajar, \"he is still there.\"  \"Then ask him to come in here,\" Ned suggested, \"and you, boys,\" he added, turning to the wondering faces at the other side of the apartment, \"you get as close as you wish while this man is talking, but don't interrupt. It may be that we shall have to do something right soon. I reckon our hunt for the prince starts right here, in the Black Bear Patrol clubroom, in the heart of little old New York.\"  The servant Jack had beckoned to now entered the room and stood with his back to the door, looking from one boyish face to another. He was a heavily built, muscular fellow, evidently an Irishman, judging from his face and manner.  \"Will you kindly come over here and sit down?\" Ned asked.  The servant complied and the others gathered around him.  \"Now,\" Jack began, \"tell Ned what you just told me--about the man in the attic, and about the hole in the ceiling.\"  Every eye in the room was instantly turned toward the lofty ceiling, but nothing out of the ordinary was to be seen there.  \"The hole he refers to,\" Jack, smiling, explained, \"is not in sight. It is under the ornamental brass piece that circles the rod from which the chandelier hangs. It was made to listen at, and not to see through, I take it!\"  \"That makes a good starter,\" Ned smiled, \"so go on.\"  \"Half an hour ago,\" the servant began, \"I was called to this floor by one of the maids, Mary Murphy it was, and she was that scared she looked like a bag of flour! She pointed to the staircase leading to the attic and asked me to go up there.  \"So I says to her: 'Why do you want me to go up there? If there's a haunt there, or a burglar, or a man after one of the girls, why should I risk the precious neck of me, when it's the only one I've got, with no prospect of ever getting another in case this one was damaged beyond repair?' So she says to me, she says--\"  \"Never mind what she said,\" Ned interrupted, fearful of a long, involved dialogue between the two servants. \"Tell me what you did.\"  \"I went up the staircase, three steps at a jump, an' bumped the head of me on the edge of the door at the top of it. You can see the dent in my coco now!\"  \"And what did you find there?\" asked Ned.  \"There was a rug on the floor and a hole in the floor, and a twinkle of light shining into the attic from this room. Some one had been listening there!\"  \"You saw no one?\"  \"Never a soul! I'm that sorry I can't express it!\"  \"When were you in that attic before--the last time before to-night?\"  \"Late yesterday afternoon it was.\"  \"Was there a rug in the middle of the floor at that time?\" Ned went on.  \"No more than there is a bold lion in the middle of this floor, sir.\"  \"Well, what did you do after you got up there to-night?\"  \"I hunted around for the man who had been lying there listening to the talk in this room, but I didn't find him, sir.\"  \"Did you ascertain where all the servants were at the time the listening must have been going on?\" asked Jack, after a short pause.  \"All but one,\" was the reply.  \"And that one? Where is he now? That is, tell, if you know where he is?\"  \"I don't know, sir. He has left the house, I reckon--bag and baggage.\"  \"Who was it?\" demanded Jack, moving toward the door.  \"Chang Chu, the Chink, may the Evil One get into his bed!\"  \"And then you came here and notified Jack?\" asked Ned. \"As soon as you learned that Chang Chu was not in the house?\"  \"Indeed I did--within a minute and a half.\"  \"Where is this girl, Mary Murphy?\" asked Ned, turning to Jack. \"We must get hold of her right away. I want to hear her story of what she saw in the attic.\"  Jack went out of the room, but was back in a minute with the girl, a pretty, modest maid of about eighteen. She looked frightened at finding herself the center of interest, but was soon in the midst of her story.  \"I went up to the attic to get a piece of cloth for a bandage, Sally having cut her hand with the bread knife. When I got to the door of that room I heard some one inside of it. I listened at the crack there is between the panel and the stile and heard footsteps, slow and soft like. I thought it was one of the maids, and opened the door quick, so as to give her a scare.\"  The girl paused and wiped her face with a white apron bordered with pink.  \"Go on,\" Ned requested. \"Tell us what you saw in the attic.\"  \"It wasn't much, sir,\" was the agitated answer. \"I saw just a flash of dark blue, coming at me like the lightning express, and then I was keeled over--just as if I had been a bag of meal, sir!\"  \"He bunted into you, did he?\" asked Jack. \"Who was it?\"  \"Indeed I don't know, sir,\" was the reply. \"It was dim in the room, there being only the light from the hall as I opened the door. Then he came at me with such a bunt that it took the breath out of me body!\"  \"And what followed?\" asked Ned.  \"She wint down f'r the count!\" chuckled the servant who had been first questioned.  \"I did not!\" was the indignant retort. \"When I got up the man was still on the stairs leading to this floor, and I picked up the great shears which had tumbled out of me hand and heaved thim at him. I had brought the shears up to cut a bandage, sir.\"  \"Did you hit him?\" asked Jack with a smile. \"Where are the shears?\"  \"I never went back after them!\" answered the girl. \"I'll go this minute.\"  \"Wait,\" Ned said, \"and I'll get them. Now, you say you saw a blue streak coming at you, head-on! Who wears blue clothes around the house?\"  \"Chang Chu, the Chink, sir.\"  \"You saw him dressed in blue to-day?\" asked Ned.  \"All in blue he was!\" the male servant interrupted, \"with his shirt on the outside of his trousers, like the bloody heathen he is.\"  \"And so you looked for him and failed to find him on the premises?\" asked Jack.  \"He's gone, bag and baggage,\" answered Terance, the coachman. \"Bad luck to him!\"  \"Still, you don't really know that it was the Chinaman?\" asked Ned.  \"He was dressed like the Chink,\" was the reply. \"He smelled like a saloon!\"  \"Does the Chinaman drink?\" asked Ned, facing Terance. \"Does he get drunk?\"  \"He does not,\" was the reply. \"He doesn't know the taste of good liquor!\"  \"That's all,\" Ned concluded. \"Now you two keep on looking for the Chinaman. He may be hiding in the house, or he may be at some of the dens such people frequent. You, Mary, look for him in the house, and you, Terance, see if you can learn where he usually went when he left the house.\"  \"Pell street!\" cried Jimmie. \"Look in Pell street!\"  \"Or Doyers!\" Jack exclaimed. \"Look in the dumps in Doyers street.\"  The two went away, forgetting all about the shears which Mary had hurled at the mysterious man she had caught in the attic. Asking the boys to remain where they were, Ned went out to the staircase and secured the article. Taking it carefully by the handle, he returned to the room and held up one blade.  Jack looked at the blade casually at first, then cried out that there was blood on it, and that Mary had speared the sneak.  \"Yes,\" Ned explained, \"there is blood on it. Mary hit the fellow on the head with this blade. What else do you see on the steel?\" he asked with a smile.  Jimmie looked and backed away in disgust. His freckled face was thrust out of the door for an instant, and they heard him calling to Mary, who, being in the kitchen, beyond sound of his voice, did not respond.  \"What do you want of Mary?\" demanded Jack. \"Shall I call her?\"  \"She said it was the Chink, didn't she?\" the boy asked. \"Or, she said it was a man dressed like the Chink? Well, it wasn't the Chink.\"  Ned laughed and looked at the boy admiringly.  \"How do you know that?\" he asked. \"Why are you so sure it was not the Chink?\"  Jimmie looked up into Ned's face with a provoking grin.  \"You know just as well as I do that it wasn't the Chink,\" he said. \"Just you look on that blade again! Ever see a Chink with light brown hair?\"  \"Now, what do you think of that?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7356"],["title","The Boy Scout Camera Club; Or, the Confession of a Photograph (#2)"],["body","Jack. \"Sometimes this boy, Jimmie, seems to me to be possessed of almost human intelligence!\"  The lads gathered closer around the shears, one blade of which Ned was still holding out for inspection. There was the blood, and there was the long, blonde hair!  \"Hit him on the belfry!\" Jimmie grinned. \"Knocked off a shingle and brought away a piece of it! Now, why did the Chink run away? That's what I'd like to know!\"  \"Where did the man get the Chink's dress?\" asked Oliver. \"That's what you'd better be asking? Why did the Chink let him in and then loan him the dress?\"  \"I rather think that's why the Chinaman ran away!\" laughed Ned. \"You boys seem to have reasoned it all out. He might have let the sneak in and then let him have some of his own clothes to wear! And that will make trouble for us!\"  \"Do you think the fellow heard about the Camera Club trip, and the object of it?\" asked Oliver. \"If he was scared away half an hour ago he didn't learn much, for we hadn't begun to talk much about it at that time!\"  \"He may not have heard anything important,\" Ned replied, \"but the fact that he was sent here to listen is significant! Some one in Washington knows that we have been chosen to search the mountains for the prince! Some one knows that we are going out as an innocent-looking Boy Scout Camera Club, but really to find the boy. Now, what will that person do to the Camera Club, after we get out into the mountains?\"  \"The question in my mind,\" Jimmie broke in, \"is what we shall do to him!\"  \"I'm sorry the information about our going leaked out,\" Ned said, gravely. \"As boy snapshot friends we might have been able to do things which the Secret Service men could not do. No one would pay much attention to a group of boys roaming over the mountains. But now I'm afraid our investigations will be all in the limelight!\"  \"Tell you what,\" Jimmie cut in, \"suppose we find the Chink and make him point out the man who was in the house--listening?\"     CHAPTER III  WHAT THE BOX CONTAINED   \"All right,\" Oliver encouraged. \"Let's go out and make a throw at finding him, anyway! He may be in the garage, or the carriage house right this minute.\"  Jimmie and Oliver rushed away to find Terance, the coachman, and undertake the search suggested, while Ned, Jack, Frank and Teddy sat at the open windows looking out on the street.  \"Chang Chu was at liberty to go into the attic at any time?\" asked Ned, tentatively.  \"Oh, yes,\" Jack answered, \"the other servants sent him about on errands. He is a handy man about the premises--or was, rather.\"  \"Is he a man to do such a thing as we are accusing him of?\" Ned then asked.  \"I never thought so,\" was the puzzled reply. \"I hope you don't think that he was beaten up by the man who secured his blue clothes! That would be tough on the fellow.\"  \"I have been thinking of that,\" Ned responded, \"and while the boys are looking for the Chinaman in the outbuildings suppose we look for him in the upper part of the house.\"  \"But if the sneak could get into the upper part of the house without the use of the disguise,\" reasoned Jack, \"he wouldn't need it at all, would he?\"  \"He might have been surprised while at work by the Chinaman,\" Ned suggested. \"In that case he might have taken the clothes as an afterthought. Suppose we look and see?\"  Leaving Frank and Teddy sitting by the window, looking out on a perfect May night, Ned and Jack climbed the staircase to the attic and entered the room directly over the Black Bear Patrol clubroom. It was a large room, more of a storeroom than an attic, with a hardwood floor and papered walls and ceiling.  A great sack upon which clothing and odds and ends of all descriptions were hanging stood at the south end of the apartment, while a long row of boxes and packing trunks occupied the floor at the north end. The rug, which had been thrown down on the floor near the hole bored through a plank, was still there where the servants had seen it. The listener had, at least, a good notion of personal comfort!  \"Where was this rug taken from?\" asked Ned.  \"It was on the rack the last time I saw it,\" Jack answered.  \"Was it clean at that time?\" Ned continued, examining the rug with a glass.  \"What do you mean by clean? It was dusty, of course, like everything else here.\"  \"Were there any stains on it--stains like blood?\" Ned went on, dragging the rug under the electric lights which had been switched on.  \"Why, of course not. It was originally in the little den off the library, but father became tired of it and told Terance to bring it here.\"  \"How long ago was that?\"  \"Oh, a month or two. I can't be exact as to the date, you know.\"  Ned handed his chum the glass and indicated a certain portion of the rug.  \"What do you call that?\" he asked. \"What does it look like?\"  \"It looks like a spot of blood,\" Jack declared. \"And it is wet, too! What do you make of this, Ned? Was Chang Chu attacked and killed by that sneak thief?\"  \"That is for us to find out,\" Ned answered. \"At the present moment, it looks as if Chang Chu wouldn't be found on Pell or Doyers street. What is there is those boxes--the large ones sitting against the wall?\"  \"About everything, I take it. I never looked into them. Why?\"  \"We may as well see what they contain,\" Ned replied, advancing to the largest box and throwing up the cover. \"What do you think now?\" he asked, as a huddled figure stirred in the box and opened a pair of suffering eyes. \"This is the Chink, I suppose?\"  Before Jack could reply, Ned had the man out of the box, with the cords cut from his hands and feet, the cruel gag removed from his mouth. His blue blouse was gone! Chang Chu tumbled over on the floor when Ned tried to stand him on his feet. There was a small cut on his head.  \"Chang velly much bum!\" he said, with his hands on his stomach.  \"Chang never forgets a word of slang,\" Jack laughed. \"He will remember the slang word for anything when he forgets the real word! What did they do to you, Chang?\" he continued, addressing the Chinaman.  Chang pressed his hands to his nose significantly and dropped his head back.  \"Chloroform!\" Ned declared, sniffing at the contents of the box.  The Chinaman could not describe the man who had attacked him. He had been alone in the attic, putting away old clothes, when he had been struck and seized from behind by a man he described as a giant for strength, stripped of his blouse, and lifted bodily into the box. There he had been bound, gagged and rendered unconscious by the use of the drug.  \"The man who did it,\" mused Ned, \"is an adept at crime, resourceful, daring. The chloroform would have attracted the attention of the servants at once if it had been administered in the open air. Then his taking the Chink's blouse as a disguise shows that he is quick to take advantage of his opportunities. A clever man.\"  \"And he left no clue!\" Jack complained. \"Just our luck, Ned!\"  \"All we know is that he is tall, has light brown hair, and is very strong,\" Ned replied. \"But there are ten thousand people in New York this minute who answer to that description.\"  \"How do you know he is tall?\" demanded Jack.  \"When he lay on the rug,\" Ned explained, \"he stretched out on his stomach to look through the hole, if he could. He couldn't; he could only listen, for the cut was made so as to be hidden by the ornamental brass piece that circles the rod from which the chandelier swings. The marks of his elbows and toes were on the soft fiber of the rug, showing him to be a man at least six feet tall.\"  Ned walked over to the large box again and bent over it.  \"Crumbs!\" he exclaimed, in a second. \"Crumbs!\"  \"Then he must have brought a lunch up with him,\" Jack exclaimed excitedly. \"There is no knowing how long he was here!\"  \"Some one in Washington has leaked!\" Ned declared, angrily.  \"Why Washington?\" demanded Jack. \"Why not New York?\"  \"Because no one in this city knows about our being engaged to hunt down the abductor. My instructions have all come in cypher, and some of them have, as you know, been addressed to this house. And there you are!\"  Chang Chu arose limply, rubbing a small wound in his head from which blood had come, and tottered off toward the staircase. As he did so, Ned noticed that his pigtail was very black, very long, and very greasy.  \"Did he take you by the cue?\" asked the boy. \"Did he pull your hair?\"  \"Velly much lough-neck pull--dam!\" answered the Chinaman.  Ned went back to the box where the Chink had been hidden and began taking out the articles it held, slowly and one by one.  \"The cloth he poured the chloroform on must be here,\" he said. \"He would naturally throw it into the box before shutting down the cover, as there might still be enough of the drug in it to put the Chink to sleep.\"  \"Here it is,\" Jack said, reaching into the box and lifting out a rag and smelling of it. \"Here is the dope cloth, all right and pretty strong yet.\"  \"That's it, all right,\" Ned answered. \"A worn white handkerchief, eh?\"  \"Name or mark on it?\" asked Jack, passing the cloth to Ned.  \"Nothing of the sort,\" was the answer, \"but there's something better. When the fellow pulled at the Chink's greasy pigtail he got his hand smeared with oil. Then he grasped this white cloth fiercely, and there you are! See! The mark of the thumb couldn't be plainer if it had been printed on. Observe the long cicatrice on the ball of the thumb? I'll take this down and photograph it.\"  \"Tall, strong, blonde, scar on the thumb!\" laughed Jack. \"We are getting on.\"  \"It would be interesting to know how he got into the house,\" Ned mused.  \"If we could only catch him and shut his mouth,\" Jack muttered, \"we wouldn't have such a rotten bad time in the mountains.\"  \"It is not what he knows,\" Ned suggested. \"It is what his master as Washington knows. We might put this chap under ten feet of earth, but the opposition from Washington would go right on.\"  \"When was the child abducted?\" asked Jack. \"When and how?\"  \"He was taken from in front of the embassy early in"]]]
