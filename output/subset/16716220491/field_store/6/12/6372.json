From an inner pocket the sailor drew a small flask of battered metal and unscrewing the cap handed it to Trot.  She took but one swallow of the water although she wanted more, and she noticed that Cap'n Bill merely wet his lips with it.  \"S'pose,\" said she, staring at the glowing seaweed fire and speaking slowly, \"that we can catch all the fish we need; how 'bout the drinking-water, Cap'n?\"  He moved uneasily but did not reply. Both of them were thinking about the dark hole, but while Trot had little fear of it the old man could not overcome his dislike to enter the place. He knew that Trot was right, though. To remain in the cavern, where they now were, could only result in slow but sure death.  It was nighttime up on the earth's surface, so the little girl became drowsy and soon fell asleep. After a time the old sailor slumbered on the sands beside her. It was very still and nothing disturbed them for hours. When at last they awoke the cavern was light again.  They had divided one of the biscuits and were munching it for breakfast when they were startled by a sudden splash in the pool. Looking toward it they saw emerging from the water the most curious creature either of them had ever beheld. It wasn't a fish, Trot decided, nor was it a beast. It had wings, though, and queer wings they were: shaped like an inverted chopping-bowl and covered with tough skin instead of feathers. It had four legs--much like the legs of a stork, only double the number--and its head was shaped a good deal like that of a poll parrot, with a beak that curved downward in front and upward at the edges, and was half bill and half mouth. But to call it a bird was out of the question, because it had no feathers whatever except a crest of wavy plumes of a scarlet color on the very top of its head. The strange creature must have weighed as much as Cap'n Bill, and as it floundered and struggled to get out of the water to the sandy beach it was so big and unusual that both Trot and her companion stared at it in wonder--in wonder that was not unmixed with fear.     Chapter Three  The Ork   The eyes that regarded them, as the creature stood dripping before them, were bright and mild in expression, and the queer addition to their party made no attempt to attack them and seemed quite as surprised by the meeting as they were.  \"I wonder,\" whispered Trot, \"what it is.\"  \"Who, me?\" exclaimed the creature in a shrill, high-pitched voice. \"Why, I'm an Ork.\"  \"Oh!\" said the girl. \"But what is an Ork?\"  \"I am,\" he repeated, a little proudly, as he shook the water from his funny wings; \"and if ever an Ork was glad to be out of the water and on dry land again, you can be mighty sure that I'm that especial, individual Ork!\"  \"Have you been in the water long?\" inquired Cap'n Bill, thinking it only polite to show an interest in the strange creature.  \"Why, this last ducking was about ten minutes, I believe, and that's about nine minutes and sixty seconds too long for comfort,\" was the reply. \"But last night I was in an awful pickle, I assure you. The whirlpool caught me, and--\"  \"Oh, were you in the whirlpool, too?\" asked Trot eagerly.  He gave her a glance that was somewhat reproachful.  \"I believe I was mentioning the fact, young lady, when your desire to talk interrupted me,\" said the Ork. \"I am not usually careless in my actions, but that whirlpool was so busy yesterday that I thought I'd see what mischief it was up to. So I flew a little too near it and the suction of the air drew me down into the depths of the ocean. Water and I are natural enemies, and it would have conquered me this time had not a bevy of pretty mermaids come to my assistance and dragged me away from the whirling water and far up into a cavern, where they deserted me.\"  \"Why, that's about the same thing that happened to us,\" cried Trot. \"Was your cavern like this one?\"  \"I haven't examined this one yet,\" answered the Ork; \"but if they happen to be alike I shudder at our fate, for the other one was a prison, with no outlet except by means of the water.  I stayed there all night, however, and this morning I plunged into the pool, as far down as I could go, and then swam as hard and as far as I could. The rocks scraped my back, now and then, and I barely escaped the clutches of an ugly sea-monster; but by and by I came to the surface to catch my breath, and found myself here. That's the whole story, and as I see you have something to eat I entreat you to give me a share of it. The truth is, I'm half starved.\"  With these words the Ork squatted down beside them. Very reluctantly Cap'n Bill drew another biscuit from his pocket and held it out. The Ork promptly seized it in one of its front claws and began to nibble the biscuit in much the same manner a parrot might have done.  \"We haven't much grub,\" said the sailor-man, \"but we're willin' to share it with a comrade in distress.\"  \"That's right,\" returned the Ork, cocking its head sidewise in a cheerful manner, and then for a few minutes there was silence while they all ate of the biscuits. After a while Trot said:  \"I've never seen or heard of an Ork before. Are there many of you?\"  \"We are rather few and exclusive, I believe,\" was the reply. \"In the country where I was born we are the absolute rulers of all living things, from ants to elephants.\"  \"What country is that?\" asked Cap'n Bill.  \"Orkland.\"  \"Where does it lie?\"  \"I don't know, exactly. You see, I have a restless nature, for some reason, while all the rest of my race are quiet and contented Orks and seldom stray far from home. From childhood days I loved to fly long distances away, although father often warned me that I would get into trouble by so doing.  \"'It's a big world, Flipper, my son,' he would say, 'and I've heard that in parts of it live queer two-legged creatures called Men, who war upon all other living things and would have little respect for even an Ork.'  \"This naturally aroused my curiosity and after I had completed my education and left school I decided to fly out into the world and try to get a glimpse of the creatures called Men. So I left home without saying good-bye, an act I shall always regret. Adventures were many, I found. I sighted men several times, but have never before been so close to them as now. Also I had to fight my way through the air, for I met gigantic birds, with fluffy feathers all over them, which attacked me fiercely. Besides, it kept me busy escaping from floating airships. In my rambling I had lost all track of distance or direction, so that when I wanted to go home I had no idea where my country was located. I've now been trying to find it for several months and it was during one of my flights over the ocean that I met the whirlpool and became its victim.\"  Trot and Cap'n Bill listened to this recital with much interest, and from the friendly tone and harmless appearance of the Ork they judged he was not likely to prove so disagreeable a companion as at first they had feared he might be.  The Ork sat upon its haunches much as a cat does, but used the finger-like claws of its front legs almost as cleverly as if they were hands. Perhaps the most curious thing about the creature was its tail, or what ought to have been its tail. This queer arrangement of skin, bones and muscle was shaped like the propellers used on boats and airships, having fan-like surfaces and being pivoted to its body. Cap'n Bill knew something of mechanics, and observing the propeller-like tail of the Ork he said:  \"I s'pose you're a pretty swift flyer?\"  \"Yes, indeed; the Orks are admitted to be Kings of the Air.\"  \"Your wings don't seem to amount to much,\" remarked Trot.  \"Well, they are not very big,\" admitted the Ork, waving the four hollow skins gently to and fro, \"but they serve to support my body in the air while I speed along by means of my tail. Still, taken altogether, I'm very handsomely formed, don't you think?\"  Trot did not like to reply, but Cap'n Bill nodded gravely. \"For an Ork,\" said he, \"you're a wonder. I've never seen one afore, but I can imagine you're as good as any.\"  That seemed to please the creature and it began walking around the cavern, making its way easily up the slope. While it was gone, Trot and Cap'n Bill each took another sip from the water-flask, to wash down their breakfast.  \"Why, here's a hole--an exit--an outlet!\" exclaimed the Ork from above.  \"We know,\" said Trot. \"We found it last night.\"  \"Well, then, let's be off,\" continued the Ork, after sticking its head into the black hole and sniffing once or twice. \"The air seems fresh and sweet, and it can't lead us to any worse place than this.\"  The girl and the sailor-man got up and climbed to the side of the Ork.  \"We'd about decided to explore this hole before you came,\" explained Cap'n Bill; \"but it's a dangerous place to navigate in the dark, so wait till I light a candle.\"  \"What is a candle?\" inquired the Ork.  \"You'll see in a minute,\" said Trot.  The old sailor drew one of the candles from his right-side pocket and the tin matchbox from his left-side pocket. When he lighted the match the Ork gave a startled jump and eyed the flame suspiciously; but Cap'n Bill proceeded to light the candle and the action interested the Ork very much.  \"Light,\" it said, somewhat nervously, \"is valuable in a hole of this sort. The candle is not dangerous, I hope?\"  \"Sometimes it burns your fingers,\" answered Trot, \"but that's about the worst it can do--'cept to blow out when you don't want it to.\"  Cap'n Bill shielded the flame with his hand and crept into the hole. It wasn't any too big for a grown man, but after he had crawled a few feet it grew larger.  Trot came close behind him and then the Ork followed.  \"Seems like a reg'lar tunnel,\" muttered the sailor-man, who was creeping along awkwardly because of his wooden leg. The rocks,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/958"],["title","Rinkitink in Oz (#1)"],["body","their existence from anyone else. But, lest I should die, and the secret be lost, I have decided to tell you what these talismans are and where they are hidden. Come with me, my son.\"  He led the way through the rooms of the palace until they came to the great banquet hall. There, stopping in the center of the room, he stooped down and touched a hidden spring in the tiled floor. At once one of the tiles sank downward and the King reached within the cavity and drew out a silken bag.  This bag he proceeded to open, showing Inga that it contained three great pearls, each one as big around as a marble. One had a blue tint and one was of a delicate rose color, but the third was pure white.  \"These three pearls,\" said the King, speaking in a solemn, impressive voice, \"are the most wonderful the world has ever known. They were gifts to one of my ancestors from the Mermaid Queen, a powerful fairy whom he once had the good fortune to rescue from her enemies. In gratitude for this favor she presented him with these pearls. Each of the three possesses an astonishing power, and whoever is their owner may count himself a fortunate man. This one having the blue tint will give to the person who carries it a strength so great that no power can resist him. The one with the pink glow will protect its owner from all dangers that may threaten him, no matter from what source they may come. The third pearl--this one of pure white--can speak, and its words are always wise and helpful.\"  \"What is this, my father!\" exclaimed the Prince, amazed; \"do you tell me that a pearl can speak? It sounds impossible.\"  \"Your doubt is due to your ignorance of fairy powers,\" returned the King, gravely. \"Listen, my son, and you will know that I speak the truth.\"  He held the white pearl to Inga's ear and the Prince heard a small voice say distinctly: \"Your father is right. Never question the truth of what you fail to understand, for the world is filled with wonders.\"  \"I crave your pardon, dear father,\" said the Prince, \"for clearly I heard the pearl speak, and its words were full of wisdom.\"  \"The powers of the other pearls are even greater,\" resumed the King. \"Were I poor in all else, these gems would make me richer than any other monarch the world holds.\"  \"I believe that,\" replied Inga, looking at the beautiful pearls with much awe. \"But tell me, my father, why do you fear the warriors of Regos and Coregos when these marvelous powers are yours?\"  \"The powers are mine only while I have the pearls upon my person,\" answered King Kitticut, \"and I dare not carry them constantly for fear they might be lost. Therefore, I keep them safely hidden in this recess. My only danger lies in the chance that my watchmen might fail to discover the approach of our enemies and allow the warrior invaders to seize me before I could secure the pearls. I should, in that case, be quite powerless to resist. My father owned the magic pearls at the time of the Great Fight, of which you have so often heard, and the pink pearl protected him from harm, while the blue pearl enabled him and his people to drive away the enemy. Often have I suspected that the destroying storm was caused by the fairy mermaids, but that is a matter of which I have no proof.\"  \"I have often wondered how we managed to win that battle,\" remarked Inga thoughtfully. \"But the pearls will assist us in case the warriors come again, will they not?\"  \"They are as powerful as ever,\" declared the King. \"Really, my son, I have little to fear from any foe. But lest I die and the secret be lost to the next King, I have now given it into your keeping. Remember that these pearls are the rightful heritage of all Kings of Pingaree. If at any time I should be taken from you, Inga, guard this treasure well and do not forget where it is hidden.\"  \"I shall not forget,\" said Inga.  Then the King returned the pearls to their hiding place and the boy went to his own room to ponder upon the wonderful secret his father had that day confided to his care.     Chapter Two  The Coming of King Rinkitink   A few days after this, on a bright and sunny morning when the breeze blew soft and sweet from the ocean and the trees waved their leaf-laden branches, the Royal Watchman, whose duty it was to patrol the shore, came running to the King with news that a strange boat was approaching the island.  At first the King was sore afraid and made a step toward the hidden pearls, but the next moment he reflected that one boat, even if filled with enemies, would be powerless to injure him, so he curbed his fear and went down to the beach to discover who the strangers might be. Many of the men of Pingaree assembled there also, and Prince Inga followed his father. Arriving at the water's edge, they all stood gazing eagerly at the oncoming boat.  It was quite a big boat, they observed, and covered with a canopy of purple silk, embroidered with gold. It was rowed by twenty men, ten on each side. As it came nearer, Inga could see that in the stern, seated upon a high, cushioned chair of state, was a little man who was so very fat that he was nearly as broad as he was high This man was dressed in a loose silken robe of purple that fell in folds to his feet, while upon his head was a cap of white velvet curiously worked with golden threads and having a circle of diamonds sewn around the band. At the opposite end of the boat stood an oddly shaped cage, and several large boxes of sandalwood were piled near the center of the craft.  As the boat approached the shore the fat little man got upon his feet and bowed several times in the direction of those who had assembled to greet him, and as he bowed he flourished his white cap in an energetic manner. His face was round as an apple and nearly as rosy. When he stopped bowing he smiled in such a sweet and happy way that Inga thought he must be a very jolly fellow.  The prow of the boat grounded on the beach, stopping its speed so suddenly that the little man was caught unawares and nearly toppled headlong into the sea. But he managed to catch hold of the chair with one hand and the hair of one of his rowers with the other, and so steadied himself. Then, again waving his jeweled cap around his head, he cried in a merry voice:  \"Well, here I am at last!\"  \"So I perceive,\" responded King Kitticut, bowing with much dignity.  The fat man glanced at all the sober faces before him and burst into a rollicking laugh. Perhaps I should say it was half laughter and half a chuckle of merriment, for the sounds he emitted were quaint and droll and tempted every hearer to laugh with him.  \"Heh, heh--ho, ho, ho!\" he roared. \"Didn't expect me, I see. Keek-eek-eek-eek! This is funny--it's really funny. Didn't know I was coming, did you? Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! This is certainly amusing. But I'm here, just the same.\"  \"Hush up!\" said a deep, growling voice. \"You're making yourself ridiculous.\"  Everyone looked to see where this voice came from; but none could guess who had uttered the words of rebuke. The rowers of the boat were all solemn and silent and certainly no one on the shore had spoken. But the little man did not seem astonished in the least, or even annoyed.  King Kitticut now addressed the stranger, saying courteously:  \"You are welcome to the Kingdom of Pingaree. Perhaps you will deign to come ashore and at your convenience inform us whom we have the honor of receiving as a guest.\"  \"Thanks; I will,\" returned the little fat man, waddling from his place in the boat and stepping, with some difficulty, upon the sandy beach. \"I am King Rinkitink, of the City of Gilgad in the Kingdom of Rinkitink, and I have come to Pingaree to see for myself the monarch who sends to my city so many beautiful pearls. I have long wished to visit this island; and so, as I said before, here I am!\"  \"I am pleased to welcome you,\" said King Kitticut. \"But why has Your Majesty so few attendants? Is it not dangerous for the King of a great country to make distant journeys in one frail boat, and with but twenty men?\"  \"Oh, I suppose so,\" answered King Rinkitink, with a laugh. \"But what else could I do? My subjects would not allow me to go anywhere at all, if they knew it. So I just ran away.\"  \"Ran away!\" exclaimed King Kitticut in surprise.  \"Funny, isn't it? Heh, heh, heh--woo, hoo!\" laughed Rinkitink, and this is as near as I can spell with letters the jolly sounds of his laughter. \"Fancy a King running away from his own ple--hoo, hoo--keek, eek, eek, eek! But I had to, don't you see!\"  \"Why?\" asked the other King.  \"They're afraid I'll get into mischief. They don't trust me. Keek-eek-eek--Oh, dear me! Don't trust their own King. Funny, isn't it?\"  \"No harm can come to you on this island,\" said Kitticut, pretending not to notice the odd ways of his guest. \"And, whenever it pleases you to return to your own country, I will send with you a fitting escort of my own people. In the meantime, pray accompany me to my palace, where everything shall be done to make you comfortable and happy.\"  \"Much obliged,\" answered Rinkitink, tipping his white cap over his left ear and heartily shaking the hand of his brother monarch. \"I'm sure you can make me comfortable if you've plenty to eat. And as for being happy--ha, ha, ha, ha!--why, that's my trouble. I'm too happy. But stop! I've brought you some presents in those boxes. Please order your men to carry them up to the palace.\"  \"Certainly,\" answered King Kitticut, well pleased, and at once he gave his men the proper orders.  \"And, by the way,\" continued the fat little King, \"let them also take my goat from his cage.\"  \"A goat!\" exclaimed the King of Pingaree.  \"Exactly; my goat Bilbil. I always ride him wherever I go, for I'm not at all fond of walking, being a trifle stout--eh, Kitticut?--a trifle stout! Hoo, hoo, hoo-keek, eek!\"  The Pingaree people started to lift the big cage out of the boat, but just then a gruff voice cried: \"Be careful, you villains!\" and as the words seemed to come from the goat's"]]]
