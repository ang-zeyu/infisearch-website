I told you so!\" cried the voice angrily. \"You've rubbed the skin off my left knee. Why on earth didn't you handle me gently?\"  \"There, there, Bilbil,\" said King Rinkitink soothingly; \"don't scold, my boy. Remember that these are strangers, and we their guests.\" Then he turned to Kitticut and remarked: \"You have no talking goats on your island, I suppose.\"  \"We have no goats at all,\" replied the King; \"nor have we any animals, of any sort, who are able to talk.\"  \"I wish my animal couldn't talk, either,\" said Rinkitink, winking comically at Inga and then looking toward the cage. \"He is very cross at times, and indulges in language that is not respectful. I thought, at first, it would be fine to have a talking goat, with whom I could converse as I rode about my city on his back; but--keek-eek-eek-eek!--the rascal treats me as if I were a chimney sweep instead of a King. Heh, heh, heh, keek, eek! A chimney sweep-hoo, hoo, hoo!--and me a King! Funny, isn't it?\" This last was addressed to Prince Inga, whom he chucked familiarly under the chin, to the boy's great embarrassment.  \"Why do you not ride a horse?\" asked King Kitticut.  \"I can't climb upon his back, being rather stout; that's why. Kee, kee, keek, eek!--rather stout--hoo, hoo, hoo!\" He paused to wipe the tears of merriment from his eyes and then added: \"But I can get on and off Bilbil's back with ease.\"  He now opened the cage and the goat deliberately walked out and looked about him in a sulky manner. One of the rowers brought from the boat a saddle made of red velvet and beautifully embroidered with silver thistles, which he fastened upon the goat's back. The fat King put his leg over the saddle and seated himself comfortably, saying:  \"Lead on, my noble host, and we will follow.\"  \"What! Up that steep hill?\" cried the goat. \"Get off my back at once, Rinkitink, or I won't budge a step.  \"But-consider, Bilbil,\" remonstrated the King. \"How am I to get up that hill unless I ride?\"  \"Walk!\" growled Bilbil.  \"But I'm too fat. Really, Bilbil, I'm surprised at you. Haven't I brought you all this distance so you may see something of the world and enjoy life? And now you are so ungrateful as to refuse to carry me! Turn about is fair play, my boy. The boat carried you to this shore, because you can't swim, and now you must carry me up the hill, because I can't climb. Eh, Bilbil, isn't that reasonable?\"  \"Well, well, well,\" said the goat, surlily, \"keep quiet and I'll carry you. But you make me very tired, Rinkitink, with your ceaseless chatter.\"  After making this protest Bilbil began walking up the hill, carrying the fat King upon his back with no difficulty whatever.  Prince Inga and his father and all the men of Pingaree were much astonished to overhear this dispute between King Rinkitink and his goat; but they were too polite to make critical remarks in the presence of their guests. King Kitticut walked beside the goat and the Prince followed after, the men coming last with the boxes of sandalwood.  When they neared the palace, the Queen and her maidens came out to meet them and the royal guest was escorted in state to the splendid throne room of the palace. Here the boxes were opened and King Rinkitink displayed all the beautiful silks and laces and jewelry with which they were filled. Every one of the courtiers and ladies received a handsome present, and the King and Queen had many rich gifts and Inga not a few. Thus the time passed pleasantly until the Chamberlain announced that dinner was served.  Bilbil the goat declared that he preferred eating of the sweet, rich grass that grew abundantly in the palace grounds, and Rinkitink said that the beast could never bear being shut up in a stable; so they removed the saddle from his back and allowed him to wander wherever he pleased.  During the dinner Inga divided his attention between admiring the pretty gifts he had received and listening to the jolly sayings of the fat King, who laughed when he was not eating and ate when he was not laughing and seemed to enjoy himself immensely.  \"For four days I have lived in that narrow boat,\" said he, \"with no other amusement than to watch the rowers and quarrel with Bilbil; so I am very glad to be on land again with such friendly and agreeable people.\"  \"You do us great honor,\" said King Kitticut, with a polite bow.  \"Not at all--not at all, my brother. This Pingaree must be a wonderful island, for its pearls are the admiration of all the world; nor will I deny the fact that my kingdom would be a poor one without the riches and glory it derives from the trade in your pearls. So I have wished for many years to come here to see you, but my people said: 'No! Stay at home and behave yourself, or we'll know the reason why.'\"  \"Will they not miss Your Majesty from your palace at Gilgad?\" inquired Kitticut.  \"I think not,\" answered Rinkitink. \"You see, one of my clever subjects has written a parchment entitled 'How to be Good,' and I believed it would benefit me to study it, as I consider the accomplishment of being good one of the fine arts. I had just scolded severely my Lord High Chancellor for coming to breakfast without combing his eyebrows, and was so sad and regretful at having hurt the poor man's feelings that I decided to shut myself up in my own room and study the scroll until I knew how to be good--hee, heek, keek, eek, eek!--to be good! Clever idea, that, wasn't it? Mighty clever! And I issued a decree that no one should enter my room, under pain of my royal displeasure, until I was ready to come out. They're awfully afraid of my royal displeasure, although not a bit afraid of me. Then I put the parchment in my pocket and escaped through the back door to my boat--and here I am. Oo, hoo-hoo, keek-eek! Imagine the fuss there would be in Gilgad if my subjects knew where I am this very minute!\"  \"I would like to see that parchment,\" said the solemn-eyed Prince Inga, \"for if it indeed teaches one to be good it must be worth its weight in pearls.\"  \"Oh, it's a fine essay,\" said Rinkitink, \"and beautifully written with a goosequill. Listen to this: You'll enjoy it--tee, hee, hee!--enjoy it.\"  He took from his pocket a scroll of parchment tied with a black ribbon, and having carefully unrolled it, he proceeded to read as follows:  \"'A Good Man is One who is Never Bad.' How's that, eh? Fine thought, what? 'Therefore, in order to be Good, you must avoid those Things which are Evil.' Oh, hoo-hoo-hoo!--how clever! When I get back I shall make the man who wrote that a royal hippolorum, for, beyond question, he is the wisest man in my kingdom--as he has often told me himself.\" With this, Rinkitink lay back in his chair and chuckled his queer chuckle until he coughed, and coughed until he choked and choked until he sneezed. And he wrinkled his face in such a jolly, droll way that few could keep from laughing with him, and even the good Queen was forced to titter behind her fan.  When Rinkitink had recovered from his fit of laughter and had wiped his eyes upon a fine lace handkerchief, Prince Inga said to him:  \"The parchment speaks truly.\"  \"Yes, it is true beyond doubt,\" answered Rinkitink, \"and if I could persuade Bilbil to read it he would be a much better goat than he is now. Here is another selection: 'To avoid saying Unpleasant Things, always Speak Agreeably.' That would hit Bilbil, to a dot. And here is one that applies to you, my Prince: 'Good Children are seldom punished, for the reason that they deserve no punishment.' Now, I think that is neatly put, and shows the author to be a deep thinker. But the advice that has impressed me the most is in the following paragraph: 'You may not find it as Pleasant to be Good as it is to be Bad, but Other People will find it more Pleasant.' Haw-hoo-ho! keek-eek! 'Other people will find it more pleasant!'--hee, hee, heek, keek!--'more pleasant.' Dear me--dear me! Therein lies a noble incentive to be good, and whenever I get time I'm surely going to try it.\"  Then he wiped his eyes again with the lace handkerchief and, suddenly remembering his dinner, seized his knife and fork and began eating.     Chapter Three  The Warriors from the North   King Rinkitink was so much pleased with the Island of Pingaree that he continued his stay day after day and week after week, eating good dinners, talking with King Kitticut and sleeping. Once in a while he would read from his scroll. \"For,\" said he, \"whenever I return home, my subjects will be anxious to know if I have learned 'How to be Good,' and I must not disappoint them.\"  The twenty rowers lived on the small end of the island, with the pearl fishers, and seemed not to care whether they ever returned to the Kingdom of Rinkitink or not. Bilbil the goat wandered over the grassy slopes, or among the trees, and passed his days exactly as he pleased. His master seldom cared to ride him. Bilbil was a rare curiosity to the islanders, but since there was little pleasure in talking with the goat they kept away from him. This pleased the creature, who seemed well satisfied to be left to his own devices.  Once Prince Inga, wishing to be courteous, walked up to the goat and said: \"Good morning, Bilbil.\"  \"It isn't a good morning,\" answered Bilbil grumpily. \"It is cloudy and damp, and looks like rain.\"  \"I hope you are contented in our kingdom,\" continued the boy, politely ignoring the other's harsh words.  \"I'm not,\" said Bilbil. \"I'm never contented; so it doesn't matter to me whether I'm in your kingdom or in some other kingdom. Go away--will you?\"  \"Certainly,\" answered the Prince, and after this rebuff he did not again try to make friends with Bilbil.  Now that the King, his father, was so much occupied with his royal guest, Inga was often left to amuse himself, for a boy could not be allowed to take part in the conversation of two great monarchs. He devoted himself to his studies, therefore, and day "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9580"],["title","Anti-Slavery Poems and Songs of Labor and Reform, Complete (#1)"],["body","once more,      Save ocean chafing on his shore,      The sighing of the wind between      The broad banana's leaves of green,      Or bough by restless plumage shook,      Or murmuring voice of mountain brook.      Brief was the silence. Once again      Pealed to the skies that frantic yell,      Glowed on the heavens a fiery stain,      And flashes rose and fell;      And painted on the blood-red sky,      Dark, naked arms were tossed on high;      And, round the white man's lordly hall,      Trod, fierce and free, the brute he made;      And those who crept along the wall,      And answered to his lightest call      With more than spaniel dread,      The creatures of his lawless beck,      Were trampling on his very neck      And on the night-air, wild and clear,      Rose woman's shriek of more than fear;      For bloodied arms were round her thrown,      And dark cheeks pressed against her own!      Where then was he whose fiery zeal      Had taught the trampled heart to feel,      Until despair itself grew strong,      And vengeance fed its torch from wrong?      Now, when the thunderbolt is speeding;      Now, when oppression's heart is bleeding;      Now, when the latent curse of Time      Is raining down in fire and blood,      That curse which, through long years of crime,      Has gathered, drop by drop, its flood,--      Why strikes he not, the foremost one,      Where murder's sternest deeds are done?       He stood the aged palms beneath,      That shadowed o'er his humble door,      Listening, with half-suspended breath,      To the wild sounds of fear and death,      Toussaint L'Ouverture!      What marvel that his heart beat high!      The blow for freedom had been given,      And blood had answered to the cry      Which Earth sent up to Heaven!      What marvel that a fierce delight      Smiled grimly o'er his brow of night,      As groan and shout and bursting flame      Told where the midnight tempest came,      With blood and fire along its van,      And death behind! he was a Man!       Yes, dark-souled chieftain! if the light      Of mild Religion's heavenly ray      Unveiled not to thy mental sight      The lowlier and the purer way,      In which the Holy Sufferer trod,      Meekly amidst the sons of crime;      That calm reliance upon God      For justice in His own good time;      That gentleness to which belongs      Forgiveness for its many wrongs,      Even as the primal martyr, kneeling      For mercy on the evil-dealing;      Let not the favored white man name      Thy stern appeal, with words of blame.      Then, injured Afric! for the shame      Of thy own daughters, vengeance came      Full on the scornful hearts of those,      Who mocked thee in thy nameless woes,      And to thy hapless children gave      One choice,--pollution or the grave!       Has he not, with the light of heaven      Broadly around him, made the same?      Yea, on his thousand war-fields striven,      And gloried in his ghastly shame?      Kneeling amidst his brother's blood,      To offer mockery unto God,      As if the High and Holy One      Could smile on deeds of murder done!      As if a human sacrifice      Were purer in His holy eyes,      Though offered up by Christian hands,      Than the foul rites of Pagan lands!             . . . . . . . . . . .       Sternly, amidst his household band,      His carbine grasped within his hand,      The white man stood, prepared and still,      Waiting the shock of maddened men,      Unchained, and fierce as tigers, when      The horn winds through their caverned hill.      And one was weeping in his sight,      The sweetest flower of all the isle,      The bride who seemed but yesternight      Love's fair embodied smile.      And, clinging to her trembling knee,      Looked up the form of infancy,      With tearful glance in either face      The secret of its fear to trace.       \"Ha! stand or die!\" The white man's eye      His steady musket gleamed along,      As a tall Negro hastened nigh,      With fearless step and strong.      \"What, ho, Toussaint!\" A moment more,      His shadow crossed the lighted floor.      \"Away!\" he shouted; \"fly with me,      The white man's bark is on the sea;      Her sails must catch the seaward wind,      For sudden vengeance sweeps behind.      Our brethren from their graves have spoken,      The yoke is spurned, the chain is broken;      On all the bills our fires are glowing,      Through all the vales red blood is flowing      No more the mocking White shall rest      His foot upon the Negro's breast;      No more, at morn or eve, shall drip      The warm blood from the driver's whip      Yet, though Toussaint has vengeance sworn      For all the wrongs his race have borne,      Though for each drop of Negro blood      The white man's veins shall pour a flood;      Not all alone the sense of ill      Around his heart is lingering still,      Nor deeper can the white man feel      The generous warmth of grateful zeal.      Friends of the Negro! fly with me,      The path is open to the sea:      Away, for life!\" He spoke, and pressed      The young child to his manly breast,      As, headlong, through the cracking cane,      Down swept the dark insurgent train,      Drunken and grim, with shout and yell      Howled through the dark, like sounds from hell.       Far out, in peace, the white man's sail      Swayed free before the sunrise gale.      Cloud-like that island hung afar,      Along the bright horizon's verge,      O'er which the curse of servile war      Rolled its red torrent, surge on surge;      And he, the Negro champion, where      In the fierce tumult struggled he?      Go trace him by the fiery glare      Of dwellings in the midnight air,      The yells of triumph and despair,      The streams that crimson to the sea!       Sleep calmly in thy dungeon-tomb,      Beneath Besancon's alien sky,      Dark Haytien! for the time shall come,      Yea, even now is nigh,      When, everywhere, thy name shall be      Redeemed from color's infamy;      And men shall learn to speak of thee      As one of earth's great spirits, born      In servitude, and nursed in scorn,      Casting aside the weary weight      And fetters of its low estate,      In that strong majesty of soul      Which knows no color, tongue, or clime,      Which still hath spurned the base control      Of tyrants through all time!      Far other hands than mine may wreathe      The laurel round thy brow of death,      And speak thy praise, as one whose word      A thousand fiery spirits stirred,      Who crushed his foeman as a worm,      Whose step on human hearts fell firm:       Be mine the better task to find      A tribute for thy lofty mind,      Amidst whose gloomy vengeance shone      Some milder virtues all thine own,      Some gleams of feeling pure and warm,      Like sunshine on a sky of storm,      Proofs that the Negro's heart retains      Some nobleness amid its chains,--      That kindness to the wronged is never      Without its excellent reward,      Holy to human-kind and ever      Acceptable to God.       1833.     THE SLAVE-SHIPS.       \"That fatal, that perfidious bark,      Built I' the eclipse, and rigged with curses dark.\"                                MILTON'S Lycidas.  \"The French ship Le Rodeur, with a crew of twenty-two men, and with one hundred and sixty negro slaves, sailed from Bonny, in Africa, April, 1819. On approaching the line, a terrible malady broke out,--an obstinate disease of the eyes,--contagious, and altogether beyond the resources of medicine. It was aggravated by the scarcity of water among the slaves (only half a wine-glass per day being allowed to an individual), and by the extreme impurity of the air in which they breathed. By the advice of the physician, they were brought upon deck occasionally; but some of the poor wretches, locking themselves in each other's arms, leaped overboard, in the hope, which so universally prevails among them, of being swiftly transported to their own homes in Africa. To check this, the captain ordered several who were stopped in the attempt to be shot, or hanged, before their companions. The disease extended to the crew; and one after another were smitten with it, until only one remained unaffected. Yet even this dreadful condition did not preclude calculation: to save the expense of supporting slaves rendered unsalable, and to obtain grounds for a claim against the underwriters, thirty-six of the negroes, having become blind, were thrown into the sea and drowned!\" Speech of M. Benjamin Constant, in the French Chamber of Deputies, June 17, 1820.  In the midst of their dreadful fears lest the solitary individual, whose sight remained unaffected, should also be seized with the malady, a sail was discovered. It was the Spanish slaver, Leon. The same disease had been there; and, horrible to tell, all the crew had become blind! Unable to assist each other, the vessels parted. The Spanish ship has never since been heard of. The Rodeur reached Guadaloupe on the 21st of June; the only man who had escaped the disease, and had thus been enabled to steer the slaver into port, caught it in three days after its arrival.-- Bibliotheque Ophthalmologique for November, 1819.       \"ALL ready?\" cried the captain;      \"Ay, ay!\" the seamen said;      \"Heave up the worthless lubbers,--      The dying and the dead.\"      Up from the slave-ship's prison      Fierce, bearded heads were thrust:      \"Now let the sharks look to it,--      Toss up the dead ones first!\"       Corpse after corpse came up,      Death had been busy there;      Where every blow is mercy,      Why should the spoiler spare?      Corpse after corpse they cast      Sullenly from the ship,      Yet bloody with the traces      Of fetter-link and whip.       Gloomily stood the captain,      With his arms upon his breast,      With his cold brow sternly knotted,      And his iron lip compressed.       \"Are all the dead "]]]
