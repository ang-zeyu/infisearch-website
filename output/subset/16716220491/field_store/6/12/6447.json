A further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 by Peter Motteux, who had then recently combined tea-dealing with literature. It is described as “translated from the original by several hands,” but if so all Spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under the manipulation of the several hands. The flavour that it has, on the other hand, is distinctly Franco-cockney. Anyone who compares it carefully with the original will have little doubt that it is a concoction from Shelton and the French of Filleau de Saint Martin, eked out by borrowings from Phillips, whose mode of treatment it adopts. It is, to be sure, more decent and decorous, but it treats “Don Quixote” in the same fashion as a comic book that cannot be made too comic.  To attempt to improve the humour of “Don Quixote” by an infusion of cockney flippancy and facetiousness, as Motteux’s operators did, is not merely an impertinence like larding a sirloin of prize beef, but an absolute falsification of the spirit of the book, and it is a proof of the uncritical way in which “Don Quixote” is generally read that this worse than worthless translation—worthless as failing to represent, worse than worthless as misrepresenting—should have been favoured as it has been.  It had the effect, however, of bringing out a translation undertaken and executed in a very different spirit, that of Charles Jervas, the portrait painter, and friend of Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. Jervas has been allowed little credit for his work, indeed it may be said none, for it is known to the world in general as Jarvis’s. It was not published until after his death, and the printers gave the name according to the current pronunciation of the day. It has been the most freely used and the most freely abused of all the translations. It has seen far more editions than any other, it is admitted on all hands to be by far the most faithful, and yet nobody seems to have a good word to say for it or for its author. Jervas no doubt prejudiced readers against himself in his preface, where among many true words about Shelton, Stevens, and Motteux, he rashly and unjustly charges Shelton with having translated not from the Spanish, but from the Italian version of Franciosini, which did not appear until ten years after Shelton’s first volume. A suspicion of incompetence, too, seems to have attached to him because he was by profession a painter and a mediocre one (though he has given us the best portrait we have of Swift), and this may have been strengthened by Pope’s remark that he “translated ‘Don Quixote’ without understanding Spanish.” He has been also charged with borrowing from Shelton, whom he disparaged. It is true that in a few difficult or obscure passages he has followed Shelton, and gone astray with him; but for one case of this sort, there are fifty where he is right and Shelton wrong. As for Pope’s dictum, anyone who examines Jervas’s version carefully, side by side with the original, will see that he was a sound Spanish scholar, incomparably a better one than Shelton, except perhaps in mere colloquial Spanish. He was, in fact, an honest, faithful, and painstaking translator, and he has left a version which, whatever its shortcomings may be, is singularly free from errors and mistranslations.  The charge against it is that it is stiff, dry—“wooden” in a word,—and no one can deny that there is a foundation for it. But it may be pleaded for Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrence of the light, flippant, jocose style of his predecessors. He was one of the few, very few, translators that have shown any apprehension of the unsmiling gravity which is the essence of Quixotic humour; it seemed to him a crime to bring Cervantes forward smirking and grinning at his own good things, and to this may be attributed in a great measure the ascetic abstinence from everything savouring of liveliness which is the characteristic of his translation. In most modern editions, it should be observed, his style has been smoothed and smartened, but without any reference to the original Spanish, so that if he has been made to read more agreeably he has also been robbed of his chief merit of fidelity.  Smollett’s version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these. At any rate it is plain that in its construction Jervas’s translation was very freely drawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original Spanish.  The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly’s, which appeared in 1769, “printed for the Translator,” was an impudent imposture, being nothing more than Motteux’s version with a few of the words, here and there, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot’s (1774) was only an abridgment like Florian’s, but not so skilfully executed; and the version published by Miss Smirke in 1818, to accompany her brother’s plates, was merely a patchwork production made out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield’s, it would be in every sense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not even seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since then I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr. Duffield’s reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.  From the foregoing history of our translations of “Don Quixote,” it will be seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in a form that amuses them, care very little whether that form is the one in which Cervantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there are many who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it, so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstances permit, and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator, even though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.  But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes; there is no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other, or why a translator who makes it his aim to treat “Don Quixote” with the respect due to a great classic, should not be as acceptable even to the careless reader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest-book. It is not a question of caviare to the general, or, if it is, the fault rests with him who makes so. The method by which Cervantes won the ear of the Spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to be equally effective with the great majority of English readers. At any rate, even if there are readers to whom it is a matter of indifference, fidelity to the method is as much a part of the translator’s duty as fidelity to the matter. If he can please all parties, so much the better; but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a representation of his author as it is in his power to give them, faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is practicable, faithful to the spirit so far as he can make it.  My purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but to indicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow, in the present instance. One which, it seems to me, cannot be too rigidly followed in translating “Don Quixote,” is to avoid everything that savours of affectation. The book itself is, indeed, in one sense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it more than Cervantes. For this reason, I think, any temptation to use antiquated or obsolete language should be resisted. It is after all an affectation, and one for which there is no warrant or excuse. Spanish has probably undergone less change since the seventeenth century than any language in Europe, and by far the greater and certainly the best part of “Don Quixote” differs but little in language from the colloquial Spanish of the present day. Except in the tales and Don Quixote’s speeches, the translator who uses the simplest and plainest everyday language will almost always be the one who approaches nearest to the original.  Seeing that the story of “Don Quixote” and all its characters and incidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar as household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old familiar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason. Of course a translator who holds that “Don Quixote” should receive the treatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by the injunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or add anything.     CERVANTES   Four generations had laughed over “Don Quixote” before it occurred to anyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for a satisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life of the author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret’s instance in 1738. All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by that time disappeared. Any floating traditions that may once have existed, transmitted from men who had known him, had long since died out, and of other record there was none; for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were incurious as to “the men of the time,” a reproach against which the nineteenth has, at any rate, secured itself, if it has produced no Shakespeare or Cervantes. All that Mayans y Siscar, to whom the task was entrusted, or any of those who followed him, Rios, Pellicer, or Navarrete, could do was to eke out the few allusions Cervantes makes to himself in his various prefaces with such pieces of documentary evidence bearing upon his life as they could find.

If you wish to copy any one let it be Miss Allison, for she is a perfect lady in every respect.\"  Elsie looked very much pleased. \"Yes, indeed, papa,\" she said, \"I should be glad if I could be just like Miss Rose, she is always kind and gentle to everybody; even the servants, whom Miss Stevens orders about so crossly.\"  \"Elsie!\"  \"What, papa?\" she asked, blushing again, for his tone was reproving.  \"Come here and sit on my knee; I want to talk to you. I am afraid my little daughter is growing censorious,\" he said, with a very grave look as he drew her to his side. \"You forget that we ought not to speak of other people's faults.\"  \"I will try not to do it any more, papa,\" she replied, the tears springing to her eyes; \"but you don't know how very annoying Miss Stevens is. I have been near telling her several times that I did wish she would let me alone.\"  \"No, daughter, don't do that. You must behave in a lady-like manner whether she does or not. We must expect annoyances in this world, my child; and must try to bear them with patience, remembering that God sends the little trials as well as the great, and that He has commanded us to 'let patience have her perfect work.' I fear it is a lack of the spirit of forgiveness that makes it so difficult for us to bear these trifling vexations with equanimity. And you must remember too, dear, that the Bible bids us be courteous, and teaches us to treat others as we ourselves would wish to be treated.\"  \"I think you always remember the command to be courteous, papa,\" she said, looking affectionately into his face. \"I was wondering all the time how you could be so very polite to Miss Stevens; for I was quite sure you would rather not have had her along. And then, what right had she to take your arm without being asked?\" and Elsie's face flushed with indignation.  Her father laughed a little. \"And thus deprive my little girl of her rights,\" he said, softly kissing the glowing cheek. \"Ah! I doubt if you would have been angry had it been Miss Rose,\" he added, a little mischievously.  \"Oh, papa, you know Miss Rose would never have done such a thing!\" exclaimed the little girl warmly.  \"Ah! well, dear,\" he said in a soothing tone; \"we won't talk any more about it. I acknowledge that I do not find Miss Stevens the most agreeable company in the world, but I must treat her politely, and show her a little attention sometimes; both because she is a lady and because her father once saved my father's life; for which I owe a debt of gratitude to him and his children.\"  \"Did he, papa? I am sure it was very good of him, and I will try to like Miss Stevens for that. But won't you tell me about it?\"  \"It was when they were both quite young men,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, \"before either of them was married: they were skating together and your grandfather broke through the ice, and would have been drowned, but for the courage and presence of mind of Mr. Stevens, who saved him only by very great exertion, and at the risk of his own life.\"  A few days after this, Elsie was playing on the veranda, with several other little girls. \"Do you think you shall like your new mamma, Elsie?\" asked one of them in a careless tone, as she tied on an apron she had just been making for her doll, and turned it around to see how it fitted.  \"My new mamma!\" exclaimed Elsie, with unfeigned astonishment, dropping the scissors with which she had been cutting paper dolls for some of the little ones. \"What can you mean, Annie? I am not going to have any new mamma.\"  \"Yes, indeed, but you are though,\" asserted Annie positively; \"for I heard my mother say so only yesterday; and it must be so, for she Miss Stevens told it herself.\"  \"Miss Stevens! and what does she know about it? what has she to do with my papa's affairs?\" asked Elsie indignantly, the color rushing over face, neck, and arms.  \"Well, I should think she might know, when she is going to marry him,\" returned the other, with a laugh.  \"She isn't! it's false! my\"--but Elsie checked herself and shut her teeth hard to keep down the emotion that was swelling in her breast.  \"It's true, you may depend upon it,\" replied Annie; \"everybody in the house knows it, and they are all talking about what a splendid match Miss Stevens is going to make; and mamma was wondering if you knew it, and how you would like her; and papa said he thought Mr. Dinsmore wouldn't think much of her if he knew how she flirted and danced until he came, and now pretends not to approve of balls, just because he doesn't.\"  Elsie made no reply, but dropping scissors, paper, and everything, sprang up and ran swiftly along the veranda, through the hall, upstairs, and without pausing to take breath, rushed into her father's room, where he sat quietly reading.  \"Why, Elsie, daughter, what is the matter?\" he asked in a tone of surprise and concern, as he caught sight of her flushed and agitated face.  \"Oh, papa, it's that hateful Miss Stevens; I can't bear her!\" she cried, throwing herself upon his breast, and bursting into a fit of passionate weeping.  Mr. Dinsmore said nothing for a moment; but thinking tears would prove the best relief to her overwrought feelings, contented himself with simply stroking her hair in a soothing way, and once or twice pressing his lips gently to her forehead.  \"You feel better now, dearest, do you not?\" he asked presently, as she raised her head to wipe away her tears.  \"Yes, papa.\"  \"Now tell me what it was all about.\"  \"Miss Stevens does say such hateful things, papa!\"  He laid his finger upon her lips. \"Don't use that word again. It does not sound at all like my usually gentle sweet-tempered little girl.\"  \"I won't, papa,\" she murmured, blushing and hanging her head. Then hiding her face on his breast, she lay there for several minutes perfectly silent and still.  \"What is my little girl thinking of?\" he asked at length.  \"How everybody talks about you, papa; last evening I was out on the veranda, and I heard John and Miss Stevens' maid, Phillis, talking together. It was moonlight, you know, papa,\" she went on, turning her face toward him again: \"and they were out under the trees and John had his arm round her, and he was kissing her, and telling her how pretty she was; and then they began talking about Miss Stevens and you, and John told Phillis that he reckoned you were going to marry her--\"  \"Who? Phillis?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore, looking excessively amused.  \"Oh, papa; no; you know I mean Miss Stevens,\" Elsie answered in a tone of annoyance.  \"Well, dear, and what of it all?\" he asked, soothingly. \"I don't think the silly nonsense of the servants need trouble you. John is a sad fellow, I know; he courts all the pretty colored girls wherever he goes. I shall have to read him a serious lecture on the subject. But it is very kind of you to be so concerned for Phillis.\"  \"Oh, papa, don't!\" she said, turning away her face. \"Please don't tease me so. You know I don't care for Phillis or John; but that isn't all.\" And then she repeated what had passed between Annie and herself.  He looked a good deal provoked as she went on with her story; then very grave indeed. He was quite silent for a moment after she had done. Then drawing her closer to him, he said tenderly, \"My poor little girl, I am sorry you should be so annoyed; but you know it is not true, daughter, and why need you care what other people think and say?\"  \"I don't like them to talk so, papa! I can't bear to have them say such things about you!\" she exclaimed indignantly.  He was silent again for a little; then said kindly, \"I think I had better take you away from these troublesome talkers. What do you say to going home?\"  \"Oh, yes, papa, do take me home,\" she answered eagerly. \"I wish we were there now. I think it is the pleasantest place in the world and it seems such a long, long while since we came away. Let us start to-morrow, papa; can't we?\"  \"But you know you will have to leave Miss Rose.\"  \"Ah! I forgot that,\" she said a little sadly; but brightening again, she asked: \"Couldn't you invite her to go home with us and spend the winter? Ah! papa, do! it would be so pleasant to have her.\"  \"No, my dear, it wouldn't do,\" he replied with a grave shake of the head.  \"Why, papa?\" she asked with a look of keen disappointment.  \"You are too young to understand why,\" he said in the same grave tone, and then relapsed into silence; sitting there for some time stroking her hair in an absent way, with his eyes on the carpet.  At last he said, \"Elsie!\" in a soft, low tone that quite made the little girl start and look up into his face; for she, too, had been in a deep reverie.  \"What, papa?\" she asked, and she wondered to see how the color had spread over his face, and how bright his eyes looked.  \"I have been thinking,\" he said, in a half hesitating way, \"that though it would not do to invite Miss Rose to spend the winter with us, it might do very nicely to ask her to come and live at the Oaks.\"  Elsie looked at him for a moment with a bewildered expression; then suddenly comprehending, her face lighted up.  \"Would you like it, dearest?\" he asked; \"or would you prefer to go on living just as we have been, you and I together? I would consult your happiness before my own, for it lies very near my heart, my precious one. I can never forgive myself for all I have made you suffer, and when you were restored to me almost from the grave, I made a vow to do all in my power to make your future life bright and happy.\"  His tones were full of deep feeling, and as he spoke he drew her closer and closer to him and kissed her tenderly again and again.  \"Speak, daughter, and tell me what you wish,\" he"]]]
