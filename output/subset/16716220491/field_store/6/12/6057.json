Chaucer gives many of them as dissyllables.  The verb _to be_ retains much of its primitive form: thus _I be, thou,_ or _thee, beest,_ or _bist, we be, you be, they be, thä be_, are continually heard for _I am_, &c., _he be_ is rarely used: but _he is_. In the past tense, _war_ is used for _was_, and _were_: _I war, thou_ or _thee wart_, he _war_, &c., we have besides, _we'm, you'm, they'm_, for _we, you, they, are_, there is a constant tendency to pleonasm in some cases, as well as to contraction, and elision in others. Thus we have _a lost, agone, abought_, &c., for _lost, gone, bought_, &c., Chaucer has many of these prefixes; but he often uses _y_ instead of _a_, as _ylost_. The frequent use of Z and V, the softened musical sounds for S and F, together with the frequent increase and multiplication of vowel sounds, give the dialect a by no means inharmonious expression, certainly it would not be difficult to select many words which may for their modulation compete with others of French extraction, and, perhaps be superior to many others which we have borrowed from other languages, much less analogous to the polished dialect of our own. I have added, in pursuance of these ideas, some poetical and prose pieces in the dialect of Somersetshire, in which the idiom is tolerably well preserved, and the pronunciation is conveyed in letters, the nearest to the sound of the words, as there are in truth many sounds for which we have neither letters, nor combinations of letters to express them. [I might at some future period, if thought advisable, go into a comparison between the sound of all the letters of the alphabet pronounced in Somersetshire, and in our polished dialect, but I doubt if the subject is entitled to this degree of criticism]. The reader will bear in mind that these poems are composed in the dialect of Somerset, north east of the Parret, which is by far the most general.  In the Guardian, published about a century ago, is a paper No. 40, concerning pastoral poetry, supposed to have been written by _Pope_, to extol his own pastorals and degrade those of Ambrose Phillips. In this essay there is a quotation from a pretended _Somersetshire_ poem. But it is evident Pope knew little or nothing about the Somersetshire dialect. Here are a few lines from \"this old West country bard of ours,\" as Pope calls him:    \"_Cicely._ Ah Rager, Rager, cher was zore avraid,   When in yond vield you kiss'd the parson's maid:   Is this the love that once to me you zed,   When from tha wake thou broughtst me gingerbread?\"  Now first, this is a strange admixture of dialects, but neither east, west, north, nor south.  _Chez_ is nowhere used; but in the southern part _utche_ or _iche_, is sometimes spoken contractedly _che_. [See _utchy_ in the Glossary].  _Vield_ for _field_, should be _veel_.  _Wake_ is not used in Somersetshire; but _revel_ is the word.  _Parson_, in Somersetshire, dealer, is _pâson_.  In another line he calls the cows, _kee_, which is not Somersetian; nor is, _be go_ for begone: it should, _be gwon_; nor is _I've a be_; but _I've a bin_, Somersetian.  The idiomatic expressions in this dialect are numerous, many will be found in the Glossary; the following may be mentioned. _I'd 'sley do it_, for _I would as lief do it_. I have occasionally in the Glossary suggested the etymology of some words; by far the greater part have an Anglo-Saxon, some perhaps a Danish origin; [and when we recollect that _Alfred the Great_, a good Anglo-Saxon scholar, was born at Wantage in Berks, on the border of Wilts, had a palace at Chippenham, and was for some time resident in Athelney, we may presume that traditional remains of him may have influenced the language or dialect of Somersetshire, and I am inclined to think that the present language and pronunciation of Somersetshire were some centuries past, general in the south portion of our island.]  In compiling this Glossary, I give the fruits of twenty-five years' assiduity, and have defined words, not from books, but from actual usage; I have however carefully consulted _Junius_, _Skinner_, _Minshew_, and some other old lexicographers, and find many of their definitions correspond with my own; but I avoid _conjectural_ etymology. Few dictionaries of our language are to be obtained, published from the invention of printing to the end of the 16th century, a period of about 150 years. They throw much light on our provincial words, yet after all, our _old writers_ are our chief resource, [and doubtless many MSS. in various depositories, written at different periods, and recently brought to light, from the Record and State Paper Office, and historical societies, will throw much light on the subject]; and an abundant harvest offers in examining them, by which to make an amusing book, illustrative of our provincial words and ancient manners. I think we cannot avoid arriving at the conclusion, that the Anglo-Saxon dialect, of which I conceive the Western dialect to be a striking portion, has been gradually giving way to our polished idiom; and is considered a barbarism, and yet many of the _sounds_ of that dialect are found in Holland and Germany, as a part of the living language of these countries. I am contented with having thus far elucidated the language of my native county. I have omitted several words, which I supposed provincial, and which are frequent to the west, as they are found in the modern dictionaries, still I have allowed a few, which are in Richardson's Johnson.  _Thee_ is used for the nominative _thou_; which latter word is seldom used, diphthong sounds used in this dialect are:    uai, uoa, uoi, uoy, as   guain, (gwain), quoat, buoil, buoy;  such is the disposition to pleonasm in the use of the demonstrative pronouns, that they are very often used with the adverb _there_. _Theäze here, thick there_, [_thicky there_, west of the Parret] _theäsam_ here, _theazamy here, them there, themmy there_. The substitution of V for F, and Z (_Izzard_, _Shard_, for S, is one of the strongest words of numerous dialects.)  In words ending with _p_ followed by _s_, the letters change places as:    hasp--haps;   clasp--claps,   wasp--waps;  In a paper by General Vallancey in the second volume of the _Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy_, read Dec. 27, 1788, it appears that a colony of English soldiers settled in the _Baronies_ of _Forth Bargie_, in the county of Wexford, in Ireland, in 1167, 1168, and 1169; and that colony preserved their customs, manners, and language to 1788. There is added in that paper a _vocabulary_ of their language, and a _song_, handed down by tradition from the arrival of the colony more than 600 years since. I think there can be no question that these Irish colonists were from the West of England, from the apparent admixture of dialects in the _vocabulary_ and _song_, although the language is much altered from the Anglo- Saxon of Somersetshire. [Footnote: This subject has been more fully treated in the following work: A Glossary, with some pieces of verse of the old dialect of the English colony in the Baronies of Forth and Bargy, Co. Wexford, Ireland. Formerly collected by Jacob Poole, of Growton, now edited with Notes and Introduction by the Rev. W. Barnes, author of the Dorset Poems and Glossary, fcap. 8vo, 1867.] The words _nouth_, knoweth; _zin_, sin, _vrast_, frost; _die_, day; _Zathardie_, Saturday; _Zindii_, Sunday; and a few others, indicate an origin west of the Parret. There are many words which with a trifling alteration in spelling, would suit at the present time the north eastern portion of the county: as _blauther_, bladder: _crwest_, crust; _smill_, smell; _skir_, to rise in the air [see _skeer_]; _vier_, fire; _vier_, a weasel; _zar_, to serve; _zatch_, such, &c. From such words as _ch'am_, and _ch'uh_, the southern part of the county is clearly indicated. I think the disposition to elision and contraction is as evident here as it is at present in Somersetshire. In the song, there are marks of its having undergone change since its first introduction.  _Lowthee_ is evidently derived from _lewth_ [see Glossary] _lewthy_, will be, _abounding in lewth_, i. e. sheltered.  The line    \"_As by mizluck wus I pit t' drive in._\"  would in the present Somerset dialect stand thus:    \"_That by misluck war a put ta dreav in.\"    That by mis-luck was placed to drive in.  In the line    \"_Chote well ar aim wai t' yie ouz n'eer a blowe_.\"  the word _chete_ is, I suspect, compounded of _'ch'_ [_iche_] and _knew_, implying _I knew_, or rather _I knew'd_, or _knewt_. [Footnote: The following is from, an amatory poem, written, in or about the reign of Henry II., during which the colony of the English was established in the county of Wexford.    \"Ichot from heune it is me sent.\"  In Johnson's _History of the English Language_, page liii. it is thus translated--    \"I wot (believe) it is sent me from heaven.\"  To an admirer of our Anglo-Saxon all the lines, twelve in number, quoted by M. Todd with the above, will be found a rich treat: want of space only prevents my giving them here.]  The modern English of the line will then be,    _I knew well their aim was to give us ne'r a blow_.  I suspect _zitckel_ is compounded of _zitch_, such, and the auxiliary verb _will_. _I view ame_, is _a veo o'm_; that is, _a few of them_. _Emethee_, is _emmtey_, that is, abounding with ants. _Meulten away_, is melting away.    _Th'ast ee pait it, thee'st a paid it_; thou hast paid it.  In the _English translation_ which accompanies the original _song_ in _General Vallancey's_ paper, some of the words are, I think, beyond controversy misinterpreted, but I have not room to go critically through it.

To Barenhond', To Banehond'. _v. n._ (used chiefly in the third person singular) to signify intention; to intimate.  These words are in very common use in the West of England. It is curious to note their gradation from Chaucer, whose expression is _Beren hem on hond_, or _bare him on hand_; implying always, it appears to me, the same meaning as I have given to the words above. There is, I think, no doubt, that these expressions of Chaucer, which he has used several times in his works, are figurative; when Chaucer tells us he _beren hem, in hond,_ the literal meaning is, he carried it in, or on, his hand so that it might be readily seen. \"_To bear on hand_, to affirm, to relate.\"--JAMIESON'S Etymological Scots Dictionary. But, whatever be the meaning of these words in Chaucer, and at the present time in Scotland, the above is the meaning of them in the west of England.  Banes. _s. pl._ The banns of matrimony.

To Begird'ge, To Begrud'ge. _v. a._ To grudge; to envy.  LORD BYRON has used the verb _begrudge_ in his notes to the 2nd canto of Childe Harold.  Begor'z, Begum'mers. _interj._  These words are, most probably, oaths of asseveration. The last appears to be a corruption of _by godmothers_. Both are thrown into discourse very frequently: _Begummers, I ont tell; I cant do it begorz._  Begrumpled. _part._ Soured; offended.  To Belg. _v. n._ To cry aloud; to bellow.

FIELDING uses the expression.  Bird-battin-net. _s._ The net used in bird-battin.  Birch'en. _adj._ Made of birch; relating to birch.  Bis'gee. _s._ (g hard), A rooting axe.  Bisky. _s._ Biscuit. The pronunciation of this word approximates nearer to the sound of the French _cuit_ [\"twice baked\"] the t being omitted in this dialect.  To Bi'ver. _v. n._ To quiver; to shake.

Boar. _s._ The peculiar head or first flowing of water from one to two feet high at spring tides, in the river Parret a few miles below and at Bridgewater, and in some other rivers.  [In Johnson's Dictionary this is spelt _bore_; I prefer the above spelling. I believe the word is derived from the animal _Boar_, from the noise, rushing, and impetuosity of the water, Todd gives it \"a tide swelling above another tide.\" Writers vary in their opinions on the causes of this phenomenon. St. Pierre. Ouvres, tom vi., p. 234, Ed. Hamburgh, 1797, describes it not exactly the same in the Seine as in the Parret:--\"Cette montagne d'eau est produite par les marčes qui entrent, de la mer dans la Seine, et la font refluer contre son cours. On l'appelle la _Barre_, parce-qu'elle _barre_ le cours de la Seine. Cette barre est suivée d'une seconde barre plus elevče, qui la suit a cent toises de distance. Elles courent beaucoup plus vîte qu'un cheval au galop.\" He says it is called _Bar_, because it _bars_ the current. In the Encyclop. Metropol., art. _Bore_, the editor did not seem more fortunate in his derivation.]  Bobbish. _adj._ In health, and spirits. [_Pirty bobbish_, pretty well.] Bonk. _s._ Bank.  Booät. _s._ Boat.
