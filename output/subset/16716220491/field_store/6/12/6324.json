Fair ladies, there is nothing more to tell.  Must the simple mystery be revealed, then, that Rachel was the daughter of the village squire, and had left home for a boarding-school, the morning after I arrived, and returned the day before my departure?  If I transformed her to an angel, it is what every youthful lover does for his mistress.  Therein consists the essence of my story.

There he sat alone, a silver-haired and highly venerated old man, in the rich gloom of the crimson-curtained room, with no box of pictures on the table, but only a decanter of most excellent Madeira.  Yet his heart still seemed to fester with the venom of the dagger.  Nevertheless, the unfortunate old gentleman might have argued the matter with Conscience, and alleged many reasons wherefore she should not smite him so pitilessly.  Were we to take up his cause, it should be somewhat in the following fashion: A scheme of guilt, till it be put in execution, greatly resembles a train of incidents in a projected tale.  The latter, in order to produce a sense of reality in the reader's mind, must be conceived with such proportionate strength by the author as to seem, in the glow of fancy, more like truth, past, present, or to come, than purely fiction.  The prospective sinner, on the other hand, weaves his plot of crime, but seldom or never feels a perfect certainty that it will be executed.  There is a dreaminess diffused about his thoughts; in a dream, as it were, he strikes the death-blow into his victim's heart, and starts to find an indelible blood-stain on his hand.  Thus a novel-writer, or a dramatist, in creating a villain of romance, and fitting him with evil deeds, and the villain of actual life, in projecting crimes that will be perpetrated, may almost meet each other, half-way between reality and fancy.  It is not until the crime is accomplished, that guilt clinches its gripe upon the guilty heart, and claims it for its own. Then, and not before, sin is actually felt and acknowledged, and, if unaccompanied by repentance, grows a thousand-fold more virulent by its self-consciousness.  Be it considered, also, that men often overestimate their capacity for evil.  At a distance, while its attendant circumstances do not press upon their notice, and its results are dimly seen, they can bear to contemplate it.  They may take the steps which lead to crime, impelled by the same sort of mental action as in working out a mathematical problem, yet be powerless with compunction, at the final moment.  They knew not what deed it was that they deemed themselves resolved to do.  In truth, there is no such thing in man's nature as a settled and full resolve, either for good or evil, except at the very moment of execution.  Let us hope, therefore, that all the dreadful consequences of sin will not be incurred, unless the act have set its seal upon the thought.  Yet, with the slight fancy-work which we have framed, some sad and awful truths are interwoven.  Man must not disclaim his brotherhood, even with the guiltiest, since, though his hand be clean, his heart has surely been polluted by the flitting phantoms of iniquity.  He must feel, that, when he shall knock at the gate of heaven, no semblance of an unspotted life can entitle him to entrance there.  Penitence must kneel, and Mercy come from the footstool of the throne, or that golden gate will never open!"]]]
