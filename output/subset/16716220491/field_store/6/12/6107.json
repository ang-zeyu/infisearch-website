After the first greetings, the prelate, according to the custom of the day, conducted Edward into a chamber, that he might refresh himself with a brief rest and the bath, previous to the banquet.  Edward seized the occasion, and told his tale; but however softened, enough was left to create the liveliest dismay in his listener.  The lofty scaffolding of hope upon which the ambitious prelate was to mount to the papal throne seemed to crumble into the dust. The king and the earl were equally necessary to the schemes of George Nevile. He chid the royal layman with more than priestly unction for his offence; but Edward so humbly confessed his fault, that the prelate at length relaxed his brow, and promised to convey his penitent assurances to the earl.  \"Not an hour should be lost,\" he said; the only one who can soothe his wrath is your Highness's mother, our noble kinswoman.  Permit me to despatch to her grace a letter, praying her to seek the earl, while I write by the same courier to himself.\"  \"Be it all as you will,\" said Edward, doffing his surcoat, and dipping his hands in a perfumed ewer; \"I shall not know rest till I have knelt to the Lady Anne, and won her pardon.\"  The prelate retired, and scarcely had he left the room when Sir John Ratcliffe, [Afterwards Lord Fitzwalter.  See Lingard (note, vol. iii. p. 507, quarto edition), for the proper date to be assigned to this royal visit to the More,--a date we have here adopted, not, as Sharon Turner and others place (namely, upon the authority of Hearne's Fragm., 302, which subsequent events disprove), after the open rebellion of Warwick, but just before it; that is, not after Easter, but before Lent.] one of the king's retinue, and in waiting on his person, entered the chamber, pale and trembling.  \"My liege,\" he said, in a whisper, \"I fear some deadly treason awaits you.  I have seen, amongst the trees below this tower, the gleam of steel; I have crept through the foliage, and counted no less than a hundred armed men,--their leader is Sir Marmaduke Nevile, Earl Warwick's kinsman!\"  \"Ha!\" muttered the king, and his bold face fell, \"comes the earl's revenge so soon?\"  \"And,\" continued Ratcliffe, \"I overheard Sir Marmaduke say, 'The door of the Garden Tower is unguarded,--wait the signal!'  Fly, my liege! Hark! even now I hear the rattling of arms!\"  The king stole to the casement; the day was closing; the foliage grew thick and dark around the wall; he saw an armed man emerge from the shade,--a second, and a third.  \"You are right, Ratcliffe!  Flight--but how?\"  \"This way, my liege.  By the passage I entered, a stair winds to a door on the inner court; there I have already a steed in waiting. Deign, for precaution, to use my hat and manteline.\"  The king hastily adopted the suggestion, followed the noiseless steps of Ratcliffe, gained the door, sprang upon his steed, and dashing right through a crowd assembled by the gate, galloped alone and fast, untracked by human enemy, but goaded by the foe that mounts the rider's steed, over field, over fell, over dyke, through hedge, and in the dead of night reined in at last before the royal towers of Windsor.     CHAPTER II.  MANY THINGS BRIEFLY TOLD.  The events that followed the king's escape were rapid and startling. The barons assembled at the More, enraged at Edward's seeming distrust of them, separated in loud anger.  The archbishop learned the cause from one of his servitors, who detected Marmaduke's ambush, but he was too wary to make known a circumstance suspicious to himself.  He flew to London, and engaged the mediation of the Duchess of York to assist his own.  [Lingard.  See for the dates, Fabyan, 657.]  The earl received their joint overtures with stern and ominous coldness, and abruptly repaired to Warwick, taking with him the Lady Anne.  There he was joined, the same day, by the Duke and Duchess of Clarence.  The Lincolnshire rebellion gained head: Edward made a dexterous feint in calling, by public commission, upon Clarence and Warwick to aid in dispersing it; if they refused, the odium of first aggression would seemingly rest with them.  Clarence, more induced by personal ambition than sympathy with Warwick's wrong, incensed by his brother's recent slights, looking to Edward's resignation and his own consequent accession to the throne, and inflamed by the ambition and pride of a wife whom he at once feared and idolized, went hand in heart with the earl; but not one lord and captain whom Montagu had sounded lent favour to the deposition of one brother for the advancement of the next.  Clarence, though popular, was too young to be respected: many there were who would rather have supported the earl, if an aspirant to the throne; but that choice forbidden by the earl himself, there could be but two parties in England,--the one for Edward IV., the other for Henry VI.  Lord Montagu had repaired to Warwick Castle to communicate in person this result of his diplomacy.  The earl, whose manner was completely changed, no longer frank and hearty, but close and sinister, listened in gloomy silence.  \"And now,\" said Montagu, with the generous emotion of a man whose nobler nature was stirred deeply, \"if you resolve on war with Edward, I am willing to renounce my own ambition, the hand of a king's daughter for my son, so that I may avenge the honour of our common name.  I confess that I have so loved Edward that I would fain pray you to pause, did I not distrust myself, lest in such delay his craft should charm me back to the old affection.  Nathless, to your arm and your great soul I have owed all, and if you are resolved to strike the blow, I am ready to share the hazard.\"  The earl turned away his face, and wrung his brother's hand.  \"Our father, methinks, hears thee from the grave!\" said he, solemnly, and there was a long pause.  At length Warwick resumed: \"Return to London; seem to take no share in my actions, whatever they be; if I fail, why drag thee into my ruin?--and yet, trust me, I am rash and fierce no more.  He who sets his heart on a great object suddenly becomes wise.  When a throne is in the dust, when from St. Paul's Cross a voice goes forth to Carlisle and the Land's End, proclaiming that the reign of Edward the Fourth is past and gone, then, Montagu, I claim thy promise of aid and fellowship,--not before!\"  Meanwhile, the king, eager to dispel thought in action, rushed in person against the rebellious forces.  Stung by fear into cruelty, he beheaded, against all kingly faith, his hostages, Lord Welles and Sir Thomas Dymoke, summoned Sir Robert Welles, the leader of the revolt, to surrender; received for answer, that Sir Robert Welles would not trust the perfidy of the man who had murdered his father!--pushed on to Erpingham, defeated the rebels in a signal battle, and crowned his victory by a series of ruthless cruelties, committed to the fierce and learned Earl of Worcester, \"Butcher of England.\"  [Stowe. \"Warkworth Chronicle\"--Cont. Croyl.  Lord Worcester ordered Clapham (a squire to Lord Warwick) and nineteen others, gentlemen and yeomen, to be impaled, and from the horror the spectacle inspired, and the universal odium it attached to Worcester, it is to be feared that the unhappy men were still sensible to the agony of this infliction, though they appear first to have been drawn, and partially hanged,--outrage confined only to the dead bodies of rebels being too common at that day to have excited the indignation which attended the sentence Worcester passed on his victims.  It is in vain that some writers would seek to cleanse the memory of this learned nobleman from the stain of cruelty by rhetorical remarks on the improbability that a cultivator of letters should be of a ruthless disposition.  The general philosophy of this defence is erroneous.  In ignorant ages a man of superior acquirements is not necessarily made humane by the cultivation of his intellect, on the contrary, he too often learns to look upon the uneducated herd as things of another clay.  Of this truth all history is pregnant,--witness the accomplished tyrants of Greece, the profound and cruel intellect of the Italian Borgias. Richard III. and Henry VIII. were both highly educated for their age. But in the case of Tiptoft, Lord Worcester, the evidence of his cruelty is no less incontestable than that which proves his learning-- the Croyland historian alone is unimpeachable.  Worcester's popular name of \"the Butcher\" is sufficient testimony in itself.  The people are often mistaken, to be sure, but can scarcely be so upon the one point, whether a man who has sat in judgment on themselves be merciful or cruel.]  With the prompt vigour and superb generalship which Edward ever displayed in war, he then cut his gory way to the force which Clarence and Warwick (though their hostility was still undeclared) had levied, with the intent to join the defeated rebels.  He sent his herald, Garter King-at-arms, to summon the earl and the duke to appear before him within a certain day.  The time expired; he proclaimed them traitors, and offered rewards for their apprehension.  [One thousand pounds in money, or one hundred pounds a year in land; an immense reward for that day.]  So sudden had been Warwick's defection, so rapid the king's movements, that the earl had not time to mature his resources, assemble his vassals, consolidate his schemes.  His very preparations, upon the night on which Edward had repaid his services by such hideous ingratitude, had manned the country with armies against himself.  Girt but with a scanty force collected in haste (and which consisted merely of his retainers in the single shire of Warwick), the march of Edward cut him off from the counties in which his name was held most dear, in which his trumpet could raise up hosts.  He was disappointed in the aid he had expected from his powerful but self-"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7723"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 09 (#2)"],["body","brother-in- law, Lord Stanley.  Revenge had become more dear to him than life: life must not be hazarded, lest revenge be lost. On still marched the king; and the day that his troops entered Exeter, Warwick, the females of his family, with Clarence, and a small but armed retinue, took ship from Dartmouth, sailed for Calais (before which town, while at anchor, Isabel was confined of her first-born).  To the earl's rage and dismay his deputy Vauclerc fired upon his ships.  Warwick then steered on towards Normandy, captured some Flemish vessels by the way, in token of defiance to the earl's old Burgundian foe, and landed at Harfleur, where he and his companions were received with royal honours by the Admiral of France, and finally took their way to the court of Louis XI. at Amboise.  \"The danger is past forever!\" said King Edward, as the wine sparkled in his goblet.  \"Rebellion hath lost its head,--and now, indeed, and for the first time, a monarch I reign alone!\"  [Before leaving England, Warwick and Clarence are generally said to have fallen in with Anthony Woodville and Lord Audley, and ordered them to execution, from which they were saved by a Dorsetshire gentleman.  Carte, who, though his history is not without great mistakes, is well worth reading by those whom the character of Lord Warwick may interest, says, that the earl had \"too much magnanimity to put them to death immediately, according to the common practice of the times, and only imprisoned them in the castle of Wardour, from whence they were soon rescued by John Thornhill, a gentleman of Dorsetshire.\"  The whole of this story is, however, absolutely contradicted by the \"Warkworth Chronicle\" (p. 9, edited by Mr. Halliwell), according to which authority Anthony Woodville was at that time commanding a fleet upon the Channel, which waylaid Warwick on his voyage; but the success therein attributed to the gallant Anthony, in dispersing or seizing all the earl's ships, save the one that bore the earl himself and his family, is proved to be purely fabulous, by the earl's well-attested capture of the Flemish vessels, as he passed from Calais to the coasts of Normandy, an exploit he could never have performed with a single vessel of his own.  It is very probable that the story of Anthony Woodville's capture and peril at this time originates in a misadventure many years before, and recorded in the \"Paston Letters,\" as well as in the \"Chronicles.\"--In the year 1459, Anthony Woodville and his father, Lord Rivers (then zealous Lancastrians), really did fall into the hands of the Earl of March (Edward IV.), Warwick and Salisbury, and got off with a sound \"rating\" upon the rude language which such \"knaves' sons\" and \"little squires\" had held to those \"who were of king's blood.\"]     CHAPTER III.  THE PLOT OF THE HOSTELRY--THE MAID AND THE SCHOLAR IN THEIR HOME.  The country was still disturbed, and the adherents, whether of Henry or the earl, still rose in many an outbreak, though prevented from swelling into one common army by the extraordinary vigour not only of Edward, but of Gloucester and Hastings,--when one morning, just after the events thus rapidly related, the hostelry of Master Sancroft, in the suburban parish of Marybone, rejoiced in a motley crowd of customers and topers.  Some half-score soldiers, returned in triumph from the royal camp, sat round a table placed agreeably enough in the deep recess made by the large jutting lattice; with them were mingled about as many women, strangely and gaudily clad.  These last were all young; one or two, indeed, little advanced from childhood.  But there was no expression of youth in their hard, sinister features: coarse paint supplied the place of bloom; the very youngest had a wrinkle on her brow; their forms wanted the round and supple grace of early years.  Living principally in the open air, trained from infancy to feats of activity, their muscles were sharp and prominent, their aspects had something of masculine audacity and rudeness; health itself seemed in them more loathsome than disease.  Upon those faces of bronze, vice had set its ineffable, unmistaken seal.  To those eyes never had sprung the tears of compassion or woman's gentle sorrow; on those brows never had flushed the glow of modest shame: their very voices half belied their sex,--harsh and deep and hoarse, their laughter loud and dissonant.  Some amongst them were not destitute of a certain beauty, but it was a beauty of feature with a common hideousness of expression,--an expression at once cunning, bold, callous, licentious. Womanless through the worst vices of woman, passionless through the premature waste of passion, they stood between the sexes like foul and monstrous anomalies, made up and fashioned from the rank depravities of both.  These creatures seemed to have newly arrived from some long wayfaring; their shoes and the hems of their robes were covered with dust and mire; their faces were heated, and the veins in their bare, sinewy, sunburned arms were swollen by fatigue.  Each had beside her on the floor a timbrel, each wore at her girdle a long knife in its sheath: well that the sheaths hid the blades, for not one--not even that which yon cold-eyed child of fifteen wore--but had on its steel the dark stain of human blood!  The presence of soldiers fresh from the scene of action had naturally brought into the hostelry several of the idle gossips of the suburb, and these stood round the table, drinking into their large ears the boasting narratives of the soldiers.  At a small table, apart from the revellers, but evidently listening with attention to all the news of the hour, sat a friar, gravely discussing a mighty tankard of huffcap, and ever and anon, as he lifted his head for the purpose of drinking, glancing a wanton eye at one of the tymbesteres.  \"But an' you had seen,\" said a trooper, who was the mouthpiece of his comrades--\"an' you had seen the raptrils run when King Edward himself led the charge!  Marry, it was like a cat in a rabbit burrow!  Easy to see, I trow, that Earl Warwick was not amongst them!  His men, at least, fight like devils!\"  \"But there was one tall fellow,\" said a soldier, setting down his tankard, \"who made a good fight and dour, and, but for me and my comrades, would have cut his way to the king.\"  \"Ay, ay, true; we saved his highness, and ought to have been knighted,--but there's no gratitude nowadays!\"  \"And who was this doughty warrior?\" asked one of the bystanders, who secretly favoured the rebellion.  \"Why, it was said that he was Robin of Redesdale,--he who fought my Lord Montagu off York.\"  \"Our Robin!\" exclaimed several voices.  \"Ay, he was ever a brave fellow--poor Robin!\"  \"'Your Robin,' and 'poor Robin,' varlets!\" cried the principal trooper.  \"Have a care!  What do ye mean by your Robin?\"  \"Marry, sir soldier,\" quoth a butcher, scratching his head, and in a humble voice, \"craving your pardon and the king's, this Master Robin sojourned a short time in this hamlet, and was a kind neighbour, and mighty glib of the tongue.  Don't ye mind, neighbours,\" he added rapidly, eager to change the conversation, \"how he made us leave off when we were just about burning Adam Warner, the old nigromancer, in his den yonder?  Who else could have done that?  But an' we had known Robin had been a rebel to sweet King Edward, we'd have roasted him along with the wizard!\"  One of the timbrel-girls, the leader of the choir, her arm round a soldier's neck, looked up at the last speech, and her eye followed the gesture of the butcher, as he pointed through the open lattice to the sombre, ruinous abode of Adam Warner.  \"Was that the house ye would have burned?\" she asked abruptly.  \"Yes; but Robin told us the king would hang those who took on them the king's blessed privilege of burning nigromancers; and, sure enough, old Adam Warner was advanced to be wizard-in-chief to the king's own highness a week or two afterwards.\"  The friar had made a slight movement at the name of Warner; he now pushed his stool nearer to the principal group, and drew his hood completely over his countenance.  \"Yea!\" exclaimed the mechanic, whose son had been the innocent cause of the memorable siege to poor Adam's dilapidated fortress, related in the first book of this narrative\"--yea; and what did he when there? Did he not devise a horrible engine for the destruction of the poor,-- an engine that was to do all the work in England by the devil's help? --so that if a gentleman wanted a coat of mail, or a cloth tunic; if his dame needed a Norwich worsted; if a yeoman lacked a plough or a wagon, or his good wife a pot or a kettle; they were to go, not to the armourer, and the draper, and the tailor, and the weaver, and the wheelwright, and the blacksmith,--but, hey presto!  Master Warner set his imps a-churning, and turned ye out mail and tunic, worsted and wagon, kettle and pot, spick and span new, from his brewage of vapour and sea-coal.  Oh, have I not heard enough of the sorcerer from my brother, who works in the Chepe for Master Stokton, the mercer!--and Master Stokton was one of the worshipful deputies to whom the old nigromancer had the front to boast his devices.\"  \"It is true,\" said the friar, suddenly.  \"Yes, reverend father, it is true,\" said the mechanic, doffing his cap, and inclining his swarthy face to this unexpected witness of his veracity.  A murmur of wrath and hatred was heard amongst the bystanders.  The soldiers indifferently turned to their female companions.  There was a brief silence; and, involuntarily, the gossips stretched over the table to catch sight of the house of so demoniac an oppressor of the poor.  \"See,\" said the baker, \"the smoke still curls from the rooftop!  I heard he had come back.  Old Madge, his handmaid, has bought cimnel- cakes of me the last week or so; nothing less than the finest wheat serves him now, I trow.  However, right's right, and--\"  \"Come back!\" cried the fierce mechanic; \"the"]]]
