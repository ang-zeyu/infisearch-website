FLOOD-TIDE OF FLOWERS    IN HOLLAND     The laggard winter ebbed so slow   With freezing rain and melting snow,   It seemed as if the earth would stay   Forever where the tide was low,   In sodden green and watery gray.    But now from depths beyond our sight,   The tide is turning in the night,   And floods of color long concealed   Come silent rising toward the light,   Through garden bare and empty field.    And first, along the sheltered nooks,   The crocus runs in little brooks   Of joyance, till by light made bold   They show the gladness of their looks   In shining pools of white and gold.    The tiny scilla, sapphire blue,   Is gently sweeping in, to strew   The earth with heaven; and sudden rills   Of sunlit yellow, sweeping through,   Spread into lakes of daffodils.    The hyacinths, with fragrant heads,   Have overflowed their sandy beds,   And fill the earth with faint perfume,   The breath that Spring around her sheds.   And now the tulips break in bloom!    A sea, a rainbow-tinted sea,   A splendor and a mystery,   Floods o'er the fields of faded gray:   The roads are full of folks in glee,   For lo,--to-day is Easter Day!     April, 1916.       ENTER AMERICA       AMERICA'S PROSPERITY     They tell me thou art rich, my country: gold     In glittering flood has poured into thy chest;     Thy flocks and herds increase, thy barns are pressed   With harvest, and thy stores can hardly hold   Their merchandise; unending trains are rolled     Along thy network rails of East and West;     Thy factories and forges never rest;   Thou art enriched in all things bought and sold!    But dost _thou_ prosper? Better news I crave.     O dearest country, is it well with thee       Indeed, and is thy soul in health?   A nobler people, hearts more wisely brave,     And thoughts that lift men up and make them free.--       These are prosperity and vital wealth!     The Hague, October 1, 1916.       THE GLORY OF SHIPS     The glory of ships is an old, old song,     since the days when the sea-rovers ran   In their open boats through the roaring surf,     and the spread of the world began;   The glory of ships is a light on the sea,     and a star in the story of man.    When Homer sang of the galleys of Greece     that conquered the Trojan shore,   And Solomon lauded the barks of Tyre that     brought great wealth to his door,   'Twas little they knew, those ancient men,     what would come of the sail and the oar.    The Greek ships rescued the West from the East,     when they harried the Persians home;   And the Roman ships were the wings of strength     that bore up the empire, Rome;   And the ships or Spain found a wide new world     far over the fields of foam.    Then the tribes of courage at last saw clear     that the ocean was not a bound,   But a broad highway, and a challenge to seek     for treasure as yet unfound;   So the fearless ships fared forth to the search,     in joy that the globe was round.    Their hulls were heightened, their sails spread out.     they grew with the growth of their quest;   They opened the secret doors of the East,     and the golden gates of the West;   And many a city of high renown     was proud of a ship on its crest.    The fleets of England and Holland and France     were at strife with each other and Spain;   And battle and storm sent a myriad ships     to sleep in the depths of the main;   But the seafaring spirit could never be drowned,     and it filled up the fleets again.    They greatened and grew, with the aid of steam,     to a wonderful, vast array,   That carries the thoughts and the traffic of men     into every harbor and bay;   And now in the world-wide work of the ships     'tis England that leads the way.    O well for the leading that follows the law     of a common right on the sea!   But ill for the leader who tries to hold     what belongs to mankind in fee!   The way of the ships is an open way,     and the ocean must ever be free!    Remember, O first of the maritime folk,     how the rise of your greatness began.   It will live if you safeguard the round-the-world road     from the shame of a selfish ban;   For the glory of ships is a light on the sea,     and a star in the story of man!     September 12, 1916.       MARE LIBERUM     I    You dare to say with perjured lips,   \"We fight to make the ocean free\"?   _You_, whose black trail of butchered ships   Bestrews the bed of every sea   Where German submarines have wrought   Their horrors! Have you never thought,--   What you call freedom, men call piracy!     II    Unnumbered ghosts that haunt the wave,   Where you have murdered, cry you down;   And seamen whom you would not save,   Weave now in weed grown depths a crown   Of shame for your imperious head,--   A dark memorial of the dead,--   Women and children whom you sent to drown.     III    Nay, not till thieves are set to guard   The gold, and corsairs called to keep   O'er peaceful commerce watch and ward   And wolves do herd the helpless sheep,   Shall men and women look to thee,   Thou ruthless Old Man of the Sea,   To safeguard law and freedom on the deep!     IV    In nobler breeds we put our trust;   The nations in whose sacred lore   The \"Ought\" stands out above the \"Must,\"   And honor rules in peace and war.   With these we hold in soul and heart,   With these we choose our lot and part,   Till Liberty is safe on sea and shore.     _London Times_, February 12, 1917.       \"LIBERTY ENLIGHTENING THE WORLD\"     Thou warden of the western gate, above Manhattan Bay,   The fogs of doubt that hid thy face are driven clean away:   Thine eyes at last look far and clear, thou liftest high thy hand   To spread the light of liberty world-wide for every land.    No more thou dreamest of a peace reserved alone for thee,   While friends are fighting for thy cause beyond the guardian sea;   The battle that they wage is thine; thou fallest if they fall;   The swollen flood of Prussian pride will sweep unchecked o'er all.    O cruel is the conquer-lust in Hohenzollern brains;   The paths they plot to gain their goal are dark with shameful stains:   No faith they keep, no law revere, no god but naked Might;--   They are the foemen of mankind. Up, Liberty; and smite!    Britain, and France, and Italy, and Russia newly born,   Have waited for thee in the night. Oh, come as comes the morn!   Serene and strong and full of faith, America, arise,   With steady hope and mighty help to join thy brave Allies.    O dearest country of my heart, home of the high desire,   Make clean thy soul for sacrifice on Freedom's altar-fire;   For thou must suffer, thou must fight, until the war-lords cease,   And all the peoples lift their heads in liberty and peace.     _London Times_, April 12, 1917.       THE OXFORD THRUSHES    FEBRUARY, 1917     I never thought again to hear   The Oxford thrushes singing clear,   Amid the February rain,   Their sweet, indomitable strain.    A wintry vapor lightly spreads   Among the trees, and round the beds   Where daffodil and jonquil sleep,   Only the snowdrop wakes to weep.    It is not springtime yet. Alas,   What dark, tempestuous days must pass,   Till England's trial by battle cease,   And summer comes again with peace.    The lofty halls, the tranquil towers,   Where Learning in untroubled hours   Held her high court, serene in fame,   Are lovely still, yet not the same.    The novices in fluttering gown   No longer fill the ancient town,   But fighting men in khaki drest--   And in the Schools the wounded rest.    Ah, far away, 'neath stranger skies   Full many a son of Oxford lies,   And whispers from his warrior grave,   \"I died to keep the faith you gave.\"    The mother mourns, but does not fail,   Her courage and her love prevail   O'er sorrow, and her spirit hears   The promise of triumphant years.    Then sing, ye thrushes, in the rain   Your sweet, indomitable strain.   Ye bring a word from God on high   And voices in our hearts reply.       HOMEWARD BOUND     Home, for my heart still calls me;     Home, through the danger zone;   Home, whatever befalls me,     I will sail again to my own!    Wolves of the sea are hiding     Closely along the way,   Under the water biding     Their moment to rend and slay.    Black is the eagle that brands them,     Black are their hearts as the night,   Black is the hate that sends them     To murder but not to fight.    Flower of the German Culture,     Boast of the Kaiser's Marine,   Choose for your emblem the vulture,     Cowardly, cruel, obscene!    Forth from her sheltered haven     Our peaceful ship glides slow,   Noiseless in flight as a raven,     Gray as a hoodie crow.    She doubles and turns in her bearing,     Like a twisting plover she goes;   The way of her westward faring     Only the captain knows.    In a lonely bay concealing     She lingers for days, and slips   At dusk from her covert, stealing     Thro' channels feared by the ships.    Brave are the men, and steady,     Who guide her over the deep,--   British mariners, ready     To face the sea-wolf's leap.    Lord of the winds and waters,     Bring our ship to her mark,   Safe from this game of hide-and-seek     With murderers in the dark!

The lengthened sheet of the Champlain stretched from the frontiers of Canada, deep within the borders of the neighboring province of New York, forming a natural passage across half the distance that the French were compelled to master in order to strike their enemies. Near its southern termination, it received the contributions of another lake, whose waters were so limpid as to have been exclusively selected by the Jesuit missionaries to perform the typical purification of baptism, and to obtain for it the title of lake “du Saint Sacrément.” The less zealous English thought they conferred a sufficient honor on its unsullied fountains, when they bestowed the name of their reigning prince, the second of the house of Hanover. The two united to rob the untutored possessors of its wooded scenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of “Horican.”[1]   [1] As each nation of the Indians had its language or its dialect, they usually gave different names to the same places, though nearly all of their appellations were descriptive of the object. Thus a literal translation of the name of this beautiful sheet of water, used by the tribe that dwelt on its banks, would be “The Tail of the Lake.” Lake George, as it is vulgarly, and now, indeed, legally, called, forms a sort of tail to Lake Champlain, when viewed on the map. Hence, the name.   Winding its way among countless islands, and imbedded in mountains, the “holy lake” extended a dozen leagues still further to the south. With the high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of the water, commenced a portage of as many miles, which conducted the adventurer to the banks of the Hudson, at a point where, with the usual obstructions of the rapids, or rifts, as they were then termed in the language of the country, the river became navigable to the tide.  While, in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance, the restless enterprise of the French even attempted the distant and difficult gorges of the Alleghany, it may easily be imagined that their proverbial acuteness would not overlook the natural advantages of the district we have just described. It became, emphatically, the bloody arena, in which most of the battles for the mastery of the colonies were contested. Forts were erected at the different points that commanded the facilities of the route, and were taken and retaken, razed and rebuilt, as victory alighted on the hostile banners. While the husbandman shrank back from the dangerous passes, within the safer boundaries of the more ancient settlements, armies larger than those that had often disposed of the scepters of the mother countries, were seen to bury themselves in these forests, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands, that were haggard with care or dejected by defeat. Though the arts of peace were unknown to this fatal region, its forests were alive with men; its shades and glens rang with the sounds of martial music, and the echoes of its mountains threw back the laugh, or repeated the wanton cry, of many a gallant and reckless youth, as he hurried by them, in the noontide of his spirits, to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness.  It was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall attempt to relate occurred, during the third year of the war which England and France last waged for the possession of a country that neither was destined to retain.  The imbecility of her military leaders abroad, and the fatal want of energy in her councils at home, had lowered the character of Great Britain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed by the talents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen. No longer dreaded by her enemies, her servants were fast losing the confidence of self-respect. In this mortifying abasement, the colonists, though innocent of her imbecility, and too humble to be the agents of her blunders, were but the natural participators. They had recently seen a chosen army from that country, which, reverencing as a mother, they had blindly believed invincible—an army led by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors, for his rare military endowments, disgracefully routed by a handful of French and Indians, and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a Virginian boy, whose riper fame has since diffused itself, with the steady influence of moral truth, to the uttermost confines of Christendom.[2] A wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster, and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers. The alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west. The terrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare. Numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their recollections; nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder, in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors. As the credulous and excited traveler related the hazardous chances of the wilderness, the blood of the timid curdled with terror, and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of the largest towns. In short, the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason, and to render those who should have remembered their manhood, the slaves of the basest passions. Even the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming doubtful; and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers, who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the English crown in America subdued by their Christian foes, or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies.   [2] Washington, who, after uselessly admonishing the European general of the danger into which he was heedlessly running, saved the remnants of the British army, on this occasion, by his decision and courage. The reputation earned by Washington in this battle was the principal cause of his being selected to command the American armies at a later day. It is a circumstance worthy of observation, that while all America rang with his well-merited reputation, his name does not occur in any European account of the battle; at least the author has searched for it without success. In this manner does the mother country absorb even the fame, under that system of rule.   When, therefore, intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the Hudson and the lakes, that Montcalm had been seen moving up the Champlain, with an army “numerous as the leaves on the trees,” its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel, in finding an enemy within reach of his blow. The news had been brought, toward the decline of a day in midsummer, by an Indian runner, who also bore an urgent request from Munro, the commander of a work on the shore of the “holy lake,” for a speedy and powerful reinforcement. It has already been mentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues. The rude path, which originally formed their line of communication, had been widened for the passage of wagons; so that the distance which had been traveled by the son of the forest in two hours, might easily be effected by a detachment of troops, with their necessary baggage, between the rising and setting of a summer sun. The loyal servants of the British crown had given to one of these forest-fastnesses the name of William Henry, and to the other that of Fort Edward, calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family. The veteran Scotchman just named held the first, with a regiment of regulars and a few provincials; a force really by far too small to make head against the formidable power that Montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds. At the latter, however, lay General Webb, who commanded the armies of the king in the northern provinces, with a body of more than five thousand men. By uniting the several detachments of his command, this officer might have arrayed nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising Frenchman, who had ventured so far from his reinforcements, with an army but little superior in numbers.  But under the influence of their degraded fortunes, both officers and men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists, within their works, than to resist the progress of their march, by emulating the successful example of the French at Fort du Quesne, and striking a blow on their advance.  After the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated, a rumor was spread through the entrenched camp, which stretched along the margin of the Hudson, forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself, that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart, with the dawn, for William Henry, the post at the northern extremity of the portage. That which at first was only rumor, soon became certainty, as orders passed from the quarters of the commander-in-chief to the several corps he had selected for this service, to prepare for their speedy departure. All doubts as to the intention of Webb now vanished, and an hour or two of hurried footsteps and anxious faces succeeded. The novice in the military art flew from point to point, retarding his own preparations by the excess of his violent and somewhat distempered zeal; while the more practiced veteran made his arrangements with a deliberation that scorned every appearance of haste; though his sober lineaments and anxious eye sufficiently betrayed that he had no very strong professional relish for the, as yet, untried and dreaded warfare of the "]]]
