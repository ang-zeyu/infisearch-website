O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend.\"    The moon gives you light,   And the bugles and drums give you music,   And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,   My heart gives you love.  \"Yours for you,\" he exclaims, welding in a phrase his unparalleled egotism, his beautiful charity, \"yours for you, who ever you are, as mine for me.\" It is the essence of philosophy and of religion, for all the wonders of heaven and earth are significant \"only because of the Me in the centre.\"  This was the secret of his tender, unassuming ministrations. He had none of that shrinking timidity, that fear of intrusion, that uneasiness in the presence of the tragic and the pitiful, which so often numb and oppress those who would willingly give themselves and their best to the needy and suffering, but whose intellect misgives them. He was that formidable phenomenon, a dreamer of action. But he possessed a sovran good sense. Food and rest and clean clothes were his scrupulous preparation for his visits. He always assumed as cheerful an appearance as possible. Armed with bright new five-cent and ten-cent bills (the wounded, he found, were often \"broke,\" and the sight of a little money \"helped their spirits\"), with books and stationery and tobacco, for one a twist of good strong green tea, for another a good home-made rice-pudding, or a jar of sparkling but innocent blackberry and cherry syrup, a small bottle of horse-radish pickle, or a large handsome apple, he would \"make friends.\" \"What I have I also give you,\" he cried from the bottom of his grieved, tempestuous heart. He would talk, or write letters--passionate love-letters, too--or sit silent, in mute and tender kindness. \"Long, long, I gazed ... leaning my chin in my hands, passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours, with you, dearest comrade--not a tear, not a word, Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier.\" And how many a mother must have blessed the stranger who could bring such last news of a son as this: \"And now like many other noble and good men, after serving his country as a soldier, he has yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service. Such things are gloomy--yet there is a text, 'God doeth all things well'--the meaning of which, after due time, appears to the soul.\" It is only love that can comfort the loving.  He forced nothing on these friends of a day, so many of them near their last farewell. A poor wasted young man asks him to read a chapter in the New Testament, and Whitman chooses that which describes Christ's Crucifixion. He \"ask'd me to read the following chapter also, how Christ rose again. I read very slowly, for he was feeble. It pleased him very much, yet the tears were in his eyes. He ask'd me if I enjoy'd religion. I said 'Perhaps not, my dear, in the way you mean, yet maybe, it is the same thing.'\" This is only one of many such serene intimacies in Whitman's experiences of the war. Through them we reach to an understanding of a poet who chose not signal and beautiful episodes out of the past, nor the rare moments of existence, for theme, but took all life, within and around him in vast bustling America, for his poetic province. Like a benign barbaric sun he surveys the world, ever at noon. I am the man, I suffer'd, I was there, he cries in the \"Song of Myself.\" I do not despise you priests, all times, the world over.... He could not despise anything, not even his fellow-poets, because he himself was everything. His verse sometimes seems mere verbiage, but it is always a higgledy-piggledy, Santa Claus bagful of _things_. And he could penetrate to the essential reality. He tells in his \"Drum-Taps\" how one daybreak he arose in camp, and saw three still forms stretched out in the eastern radiance, how with light fingers he just lifted the blanket from each cold face in turn: the first elderly, gaunt, and grim--Who are you, my dear comrade? The next with cheeks yet blooming--Who are you, sweet boy? The third--Young man, I think I know you. I think this face is the face of the Christ Himself, Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies.  True poetry focuses experience, not merely transmits it. It must redeem it for ever from transitoriness and evanescence. Whitman incontinently pours experience out in a Niagara-like cataract. But in spite of his habitual publicity he was at heart of a \"shy, brooding, impassioned devotional type\"; in spite of his self-conscious, arrogant virility, he was to the end of his life an entranced child. He came into the world, saw and babbled. His deliberate method of writing could have had no other issue. A subject would occur to him, a kind of tag. He would scribble it down on a scrap of paper and drop it into a drawer. Day by day this first impulse would evoke fresh \"poemets,\" until at length the accumulation was exhaustive. Then he merely gutted his treasury and the ode was complete. It was only when sense and feeling attained a sort of ecstasy that he succeeded in distilling the true essence that is poetry and in enstopping it in a crystal phial of form.  The prose of his \"Specimen Days,\" indeed, is often nearer to poetry than his verse:      Much of the time he sleeps, or half sleeps.... I often come and     sit by him in perfect silence; he will breathe for ten minutes as     softly and evenly as a young babe asleep. Poor youth, so     handsome, athletic, with profuse beautiful shining hair. One time     as I sat looking at him while he lay asleep, he suddenly, without     the least start awaken'd, open'd his eyes, gave me a long steady     look, turning his face very slightly to gaze easier--one long,     clear, silent look--a slight sigh--then turn'd back and went into     his doze again. Little he knew, poor death-stricken boy, the     heart of the stranger that hover'd near.      The western star, Venus, in the earlier hours of evening has     never been so large, so clear; it seems as if it told something,     as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity, with us Americans.     The sky dark blue, the transparent night, the planets, the     moderate west wind, the elastic temperature, the miracle of that     great star, and the young and swelling moon swimming in the west,     suffused the soul. Then I heard slow and clear the deliberate     notes of a bugle come up out of the silence ... firm and     faithful, floating along, rising, falling leisurely, with here     and there a long-drawn note.... sounding tattoo.  \"A steady rain, dark and thick and warm,\" he writes again, two days after Gettysburg. \"The cavalry camp is a ceaseless field of observation to me. This forenoon there stood the horses, tether'd together, dripping, steaming, chewing their hay. The men emerge from their tents, dripping also. The fires are half-quench'd.\" There is a poetic poise in this brief, vivid statement, apart from its bare economy of means. It is the lump awaiting the leaven no less than is \"Cavalry Crossing a Ford.\" To this supreme spectator an apple orchard in May, even the White House in moonlight, no more and no less than these battle-scenes, rendered up their dignity, life, and beauty, their true human significance. But in \"Drum-Taps\" the witness is not always so satisfactory. The secret has evaporated in the effort to _make_ poetry, or half-consciously to inject a moral, to play the Universal Bard. There creeps into the words a tinge of the raw and the grotesque. The poet has the look of a cowboy off the stage, tanned with grease-paint. But again and again the secret creeps back and some lovely emanation of poetry is added to it:    Look down fair moon and bathe this scene,   Pour softly down night's nimbus floods on faces ghastly, swollen,             purple,   On the dead on their backs with arms toss'd wide,   Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon.  Or this, called \"Reconciliation\":    Word over all, beautiful as the sky,   Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be             utterly lost,   That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly wash             again, and ever again, this soil'd world;   For my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,   I look where he lies white-faced and still in the coffin--I draw             near,   Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the             coffin.  The bonds of rhyme shackled him, deprived him of more than freedom. He is like a wild bird that suddenly perceives the bars of its small cage across the blue of the sky. And yet the finer his poems are, the nearer they approach to definite rhythmical design. One has only to compare \"O Captain! my Captain!\" with \"Hushed be the Camps To-day\" to perceive this curious paradox. They are both of them memories of his beloved Lincoln, whom he had many times seen, with that peculiarly close and transatlantic curiosity of his, riding at a jog-trot, on a good-sized, easy-going grey horse, with his escort of yellow-striped cavalry behind him, through the streets of Washington--dressed in black, somewhat rusty and dusty, with a black, stiff hat, almost as ordinary in attire as the commonest man. That heroic face, too, he had pierced; and caught from it the deep, subtle, indirect expression, that only the long-gone master-painters of the Old World could have seized and immortalized. And in yet another memory of this great American Whitman attains to his best and highest, \"When Lilacs Last in the Doorway Bloom'd.\" It is one of the most beautiful of poems, of the purest intuition, of a consummate, if unconscious, artistry. Whose voice is it that rings and echoes, now low and tender, now solemn and desolate, now clear, full, victorious, out of its cloistral solitude--that of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8801"],["title","Drum-Taps (#2)"],["body","mourner himself, of all-heedfull, heedless Nature, of the immortal soul of man, or just a bird, the shy and hidden, sweet, small hermit thrush? The last division of his life's work--his fond Epic, his cosmic \"inventory\"--as Whitman planned it, was to be devoted to the chaunting of songs of death and immortality. The soldier to whom he read of Christ's Resurrection talked of death to him, and said he did not fear it. He talked to a man who did not enjoy religion in the way a Christian means, to whom the mystery of Easter is an all-sufficing \"reliance.\" But Whitman not only did not fear death. The thought of it was to him the strangest of raptures, the reverie of a child dreaming of a distant mother, soon to come again. Death and immortality were but two aspects of the same blessed hope to this man, who poured out his life in a turgid fount of ecstatic joy in living:    ... And I saw askant the armies,   I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,   Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles I             saw them,   And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,   And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs (and all in silence),   And the staffs all splintered and broken.    I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,   And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,   I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,   But I saw they were not as was thought,   They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,   The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,   And the wives and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,   And the armies that remain'd suffer'd....    _Come lovely and soothing death,   Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,   In the night, in the day, to all, to each,   Sooner or later delicate death._    _Prais'd be the fathomless universe,   For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,   And for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!   For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death._    _Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet   Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?   Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,   I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come             unfalteringly._      DRUM-TAPS     FIRST O SONGS FOR A PRELUDE.     First O songs for a prelude,   Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in my city,   How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,   How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,   (O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!   O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than             steel!)   How you sprang--how you threw off the costumes of peace with             indifferent hand,   How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard             in their stead,   How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of             soldiers,)   How Manhattan drum-taps led.    Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,   Forty years as a pageant, still unawares the lady of this teeming and             turbulent city,   Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,   With her million children around her, suddenly,   At dead of night, at news from the south,   Incens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.    A shock electric, the night sustain'd it,   Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its myriads.   From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways,   Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming.    To the drum-taps prompt,   The young men falling in and arming,   The mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith's             hammer, tost aside with precipitation,)   The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving the             court,   The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down, throwing             the reins abruptly down on the horses' backs,   The salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper, porter, all             leaving;   Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,   The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear their             accoutrements, they buckle the straps carefully,   Outdoors arming, indoors arming, the flash of the musketbarrels,   The white tents cluster in camps, the arm'd sentries around, the             sunrise cannon and again at sunset,   Arm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark             from the wharves,   (How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with             their guns on their shoulders!   How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces and             their clothes and knapsacks cover'd with dust!)   The blood of the city up--arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere,   The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the             public buildings and stores,   The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his             mother,   (Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to detain             him,)   The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing the             way,   The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their             favorites,   The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along, rumble             lightly over the stones,   (Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,   Soon unlimber'd to begin the red business;)   All the mutter of preparation, all the determin'd arming,   The hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines,   The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest, no             mere parade now;   War! an arm'd race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no turning             away;   War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm'd race is advancing to             welcome it.    Mannahatta a-march--and it's O to sing it well!   It's O for a manly life in the camp.    And the sturdy artillery,   The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the guns,   Unlimber them! (no more as the past forty years for salutes for             courtesies merely,   Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)    And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,   Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,   Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown'd amid             all your children,   But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.     EIGHTEEN SIXTY-ONE.     Arm'd year--year of the struggle,   No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year,   Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas             piano,   But as a strong man erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing,             carrying a rifle on your shoulder,   With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands, with a knife in             the belt at your side,   As I heard you shouting loud, your sonorous voice ringing across the             continent,   Your masculine voice O year, as rising amid the great cities,   Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen, the             dwellers in Manhattan,   Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and             Indiana,   Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the             Alleghanies,   Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along the             Ohio river,   Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at             Chattanooga on the mountain top,   Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue, bearing             weapons, robust year,   Heard your determin'd voice launch'd forth again and again,   Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp'd cannon,   I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year.     BEAT! BEAT! DRUMS!     Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!   Through the windows-through doors-burst like a ruthless force,   Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,   Into the school where the scholar is studying;   Leave not the bridegroom quiet--no happiness must he have now with             his bride,   Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering             his grain,   So fierce you whirr and pound you drums--so shrill you bugles blow.    Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!   Over the traffic of cities--over the rumble of wheels in the streets;   Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers             must sleep in those beds,   No bargainers' bargains by day--no brokers or speculators--would they             continue?   Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?   Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the             judge?   Then rattle quicker, heavier drums--you bugles wilder blow.    Beat! beat! drums!--blow! bugles! blow!   Make no parley--stop for no expostulation,   Mind not the timid--mind not the weeper or prayer,   Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,   Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties,   Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the             hearses,   So strong you thump O terrible drums--so loud you bugles blow.     FROM PAUMANOK STARTING I FLY LIKE A BIRD     From Paumanok starting I fly like a bird,   Around and around to soar to sing the idea of all,   To the north betaking myself to sing there arctic songs,   To Kanada till I absorb Kanada in myself, to Michigan then,   To Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, to sing their songs, (they are             inimitable;)   Then to Ohio and Indiana to sing theirs, to Missouri and Kansas and             Arkansas to sing theirs,   To Tennessee and Kentucky, to the Carolinas and Georgia to sing             theirs,   To Texas and so along up toward California, to roam accepted             everywhere;   To sing first, (to the "]]]
