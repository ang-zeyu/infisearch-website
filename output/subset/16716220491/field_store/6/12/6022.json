You might better keep your reputation, seeing the strain would not be for long.\"  \"It will stand it, I reckon.  Before to-morrow we shall be out of prison, and free to go where we will, besides.\"  The witty officer lifted at his left ear with his thumb, made a rasping noise in his throat, and said:  \"Out of prison--yes--ye say true.  And free likewise to go where ye will, so ye wander not out of his grace the Devil's sultry realm.\"  I kept my temper, and said, indifferently:  \"Now I suppose you really think we are going to hang within a day or two.\"  \"I thought it not many minutes ago, for so the thing was decided and proclaimed.\"  \"Ah, then you've changed your mind, is that it?\"  \"Even that.  I only _thought_, then; I _know_, now.\"  I felt sarcastical, so I said:  \"Oh, sapient servant of the law, condescend to tell us, then, what you _know_.\"  \"That ye will all be hanged _to-day_, at mid-afternoon!  Oho! that shot hit home!  Lean upon me.\"  The fact is I did need to lean upon somebody.  My knights couldn't arrive in time.  They would be as much as three hours too late. Nothing in the world could save the King of England; nor me, which was more important.  More important, not merely to me, but to the nation--the only nation on earth standing ready to blossom into civilization.  I was sick.  I said no more, there wasn't anything to say.  I knew what the man meant; that if the missing slave was found, the postponement would be revoked, the execution take place to-day.  Well, the missing slave was found.    CHAPTER XXXVIII  SIR LAUNCELOT AND KNIGHTS TO THE RESCUE  Nearing four in the afternoon.  The scene was just outside the walls of London.  A cool, comfortable, superb day, with a brilliant sun; the kind of day to make one want to live, not die.  The multitude was prodigious and far-reaching; and yet we fifteen poor devils hadn't a friend in it.  There was something painful in that thought, look at it how you might.  There we sat, on our tall scaffold, the butt of the hate and mockery of all those enemies.  We were being made a holiday spectacle.  They had built a sort of grand stand for the nobility and gentry, and these were there in full force, with their ladies.  We recognized a good many of them.  The crowd got a brief and unexpected dash of diversion out of the king.  The moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang up, in his fantastic rags, with face bruised out of all recognition, and proclaimed himself Arthur, King of Britain, and denounced the awful penalties of treason upon every soul there present if hair of his sacred head were touched.  It startled and surprised him to hear them break into a vast roar of laughter.  It wounded his dignity, and he locked himself up in silence.  Then, although the crowd begged him to go on, and tried to provoke him to it by catcalls, jeers, and shouts of:  \"Let him speak!  The king!  The king! his humble subjects hunger and thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master his Serene and Sacred Raggedness!\"  But it went for nothing.  He put on all his majesty and sat under this rain of contempt and insult unmoved.  He certainly was great in his way.  Absently, I had taken off my white bandage and wound it about my right arm.  When the crowd noticed this, they began upon me.  They said:  \"Doubtless this sailor-man is his minister--observe his costly badge of office!\"  I let them go on until they got tired, and then I said:  \"Yes, I am his minister, The Boss; and to-morrow you will hear that from Camelot which--\"  I got no further.  They drowned me out with joyous derision.  But presently there was silence; for the sheriffs of London, in their official robes, with their subordinates, began to make a stir which indicated that business was about to begin.  In the hush which followed, our crime was recited, the death warrant read, then everybody uncovered while a priest uttered a prayer.  Then a slave was blindfolded; the hangman unslung his rope.  There lay the smooth road below us, we upon one side of it, the banked multitude wailing its other side--a good clear road, and kept free by the police--how good it would be to see my five hundred horsemen come tearing down it!  But no, it was out of the possibilities. I followed its receding thread out into the distance--not a horseman on it, or sign of one.  There was a jerk, and the slave hung dangling; dangling and hideously squirming, for his limbs were not tied.  A second rope was unslung, in a moment another slave was dangling.  In a minute a third slave was struggling in the air.  It was dreadful.  I turned away my head a moment, and when I turned back I missed the king!  They were blindfolding him!  I was paralyzed; I couldn't move, I was choking, my tongue was petrified.  They finished blindfolding him, they led him under the rope.  I couldn't shake off that clinging impotence.  But when I saw them put the noose around his neck, then everything let go in me and I made a spring to the rescue--and as I made it I shot one more glance abroad--by George! here they came, a-tilting!--five hundred mailed and belted knights on bicycles!  The grandest sight that ever was seen.  Lord, how the plumes streamed, how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession of webby wheels!  I waved my right arm as Launcelot swept in--he recognized my rag --I tore away noose and bandage, and shouted:  \"On your knees, every rascal of you, and salute the king!  Who fails shall sup in hell to-night!\"  I always use that high style when I'm climaxing an effect.  Well, it was noble to see Launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that scaffold and heave sheriffs and such overboard.  And it was fine to see that astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg their lives of the king they had just been deriding and insulting. And as he stood apart there, receiving this homage in rags, I thought to myself, well, really there is something peculiarly grand about the gait and bearing of a king, after all.  I was immensely satisfied.  Take the whole situation all around, it was one of the gaudiest effects I ever instigated.  And presently up comes Clarence, his own self! and winks, and says, very modernly:  \"Good deal of a surprise, wasn't it?  I knew you'd like it.  I've had the boys practicing this long time, privately; and just hungry for a chance to show off.\"    CHAPTER XXXIX  THE YANKEE'S FIGHT WITH THE KNIGHTS  Home again, at Camelot.  A morning or two later I found the paper, damp from the press, by my plate at the breakfast table.  I turned to the advertising columns, knowing I should find something of personal interest to me there.  It was this:               DE PAR LE ROI.     Know that the great lord and illus-    trious Kni8ht, SIR SAGRAMOR LE    DESIROUS having condescended to    meet the King's Minister, Hank Mor-     gan, the which is surnamed The Boss,    for satisfgction of offence anciently given,    these wilL engage in the lists by    Camelot about the fourth hour of the    morning of the sixteenth day of this    next succeeding month. The battle    will be a l outrance, sith the said offence    was of a deadly sort, admitting of no    comPosition.               DE PAR LE ROI   Clarence's editorial reference to this affair was to this effect:     It will be observed, by a gl7nce at our    advertising columns, that the commu-    nity is to be favored with a treat of un-    usual interest in the tournament line.    The n ames of the artists are warrant of    good enterTemment. The box-office    will be open at noon of the 13th; ad-    mission 3 cents, reserved seatsh 5; pro-    ceeds to go to the hospital fund  The    royal pair and all the Court will be pres-    ent. With these exceptions, and the    press and the clergy, the free list is strict-    ly susPended. Parties are hereby warn-    ed against buying tickets of speculators;    they will not be good at the door.    Everybody knows and likes The Boss,    everybody knows and likes Sir Sag.;    come, let us give the lads a good send-    off. ReMember, the proceeds go to a    great and free charity, and one whose    broad begevolence stretches out its help-    ing hand, warm with the blood of a lov-    ing heart, to all that suffer, regardless of    race, creed, condition or color--the    only charity yet established in the earth    which has no politico-religious stop-    cock on its compassion, but says Here    flows the stream, let ALL come and    drink! Turn out, all hands! fetch along    your dou3hnuts and your gum-drops    and have a good time. Pie for sale on    the grounds, and rocks to crack it with;    and ciRcus-lemonade--three drops of    lime juice to a barrel of water.    N.B. This is the first tournament    under the new law, whidh allow each    combatant to use any weapon he may pre-    fer. You may want to make a note of that.  Up to the day set, there was no talk in all Britain of anything but this combat.  All other topics sank into insignificance and passed out of men's thoughts and interest.  It was not because a tournament was a great matter, it was not because Sir Sagramor had found the Holy Grail, for he had not, but had failed; it was not because the second (official) personage in the kingdom was one of the duellists; no, all these features were commonplace. Yet there was abundant reason for the extraordinary interest which this coming fight was creating.  It was born of the fact that all the nation knew that this was not to be a duel between mere men, so to speak, but a duel between two mighty magicians; a duel not of muscle but of mind, not of human skill but of superhuman art and craft; a final struggle for supremacy between the two master enchanters of the age.  It was realized that the most prodigious achievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthy of comparison with a spectacle like this; they could be but child's play, contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7250"],["title","A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 9.

Well, when they had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths, they rested-up that side by shifting the laugh to the other side. That was when they compromised with the Invincible at 283!\"  \"Good land!\"  \"He skinned them alive, and they deserved it--anyway, the whole kingdom rejoiced.  Well, among the flayed were Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, nephews to the king.  End of the first act.  Act second, scene first, an apartment in Carlisle castle, where the court had gone for a few days' hunting.  Persons present, the whole tribe of the king's nephews.  Mordred and Agravaine propose to call the guileless Arthur's attention to Guenever and Sir Launcelot.  Sir Gawaine, Sir Gareth, and Sir Gaheris will have nothing to do with it.  A dispute ensues, with loud talk; in the midst of it enter the king.  Mordred and Agravaine spring their devastating tale upon him.  _Tableau_.  A trap is laid for Launcelot, by the king's command, and Sir Launcelot walks into it.  He made it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnesses--to wit, Mordred, Agravaine, and twelve knights of lesser rank, for he killed every one of them but Mordred; but of course that couldn't straighten matters between Launcelot and the king, and didn't.\"  \"Oh, dear, only one thing could result--I see that.  War, and the knights of the realm divided into a king's party and a Sir Launcelot's party.\"  \"Yes--that was the way of it.  The king sent the queen to the stake, proposing to purify her with fire.  Launcelot and his knights rescued her, and in doing it slew certain good old friends of yours and mine--in fact, some of the best we ever had; to wit, Sir Belias le Orgulous, Sir Segwarides, Sir Griflet le Fils de Dieu, Sir Brandiles, Sir Aglovale--\"  \"Oh, you tear out my heartstrings.\"  \"--wait, I'm not done yet--Sir Tor, Sir Gauter, Sir Gillimer--\"  \"The very best man in my subordinate nine.

Come, I can't stand this!\"  \"--Sir Driant, Sir Lambegus, Sir Herminde, Sir Pertilope, Sir Perimones, and--whom do you think?\"  \"Rush!  Go on.\"  \"Sir Gaheris, and Sir Gareth--both!\"  \"Oh, incredible!  Their love for Launcelot was indestructible.\"  \"Well, it was an accident.  They were simply onlookers; they were unarmed, and were merely there to witness the queen's punishment. Sir Launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his blind fury, and he killed these without noticing who they were.  Here is an instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle; it's for sale on every news-stand.  There--the figures nearest the queen are Sir Launcelot with his sword up, and Sir Gareth gasping his latest breath.  You can catch the agony in the queen's face through the curling smoke.  It's a rattling battle-picture.\"  \"Indeed, it is.  We must take good care of it; its historical value is incalculable.  Go on.\"  \"Well, the rest of the tale is just war, pure and simple.  Launcelot retreated to his town and castle of Joyous Gard, and gathered there a great following of knights.  The king, with a great host, went there, and there was desperate fighting during several days, and, as a result, all the plain around was paved with corpses and cast-iron.  Then the Church patched up a peace between Arthur and Launcelot and the queen and everybody--everybody but Sir Gawaine. He was bitter about the slaying of his brothers, Gareth and Gaheris, and would not be appeased.  He notified Launcelot to get him thence, and make swift preparation, and look to be soon attacked. So Launcelot sailed to his Duchy of Guienne with his following, and Gawaine soon followed with an army, and he beguiled Arthur to go with him.  Arthur left the kingdom in Sir Mordred's hands until you should return--\"  \"Ah--a king's customary wisdom!\"  \"Yes.  Sir Mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship permanent.  He was going to marry Guenever, as a first move; but she fled and shut herself up in the Tower of London.  Mordred attacked; the Bishop of Canterbury dropped down on him with the Interdict.  The king returned; Mordred fought him at Dover, at Canterbury, and again at Barham Down.  Then there was talk of peace and a composition.  Terms, Mordred to have Cornwall and Kent during Arthur's life, and the whole kingdom afterward.\"  \"Well, upon my word!  My dream of a republic to _be_ a dream, and so remain.\"  \"Yes.  The two armies lay near Salisbury.  Gawaine--Gawaine's head is at Dover Castle, he fell in the fight there--Gawaine appeared to Arthur in a dream, at least his ghost did, and warned him to refrain from conflict for a month, let the delay cost what it might. But battle was precipitated by an accident.  Arthur had given order that if a sword was raised during the consultation over the proposed treaty with Mordred, sound the trumpet and fall on! for he had no confidence in Mordred.  Mordred had given a similar order to _his_ people.  Well, by and by an adder bit a knight's heel; the knight forgot all about the order, and made a slash at the adder with his sword.  Inside of half a minute those two prodigious hosts came together with a crash!  They butchered away all day. Then the king--however, we have started something fresh since you left--our paper has.\"  \"No?  What is that?\"  \"War correspondence!\"  \"Why, that's good.\"  \"Yes, the paper was booming right along, for the Interdict made no impression, got no grip, while the war lasted.  I had war correspondents with both armies.  I will finish that battle by reading you what one of the boys says:     'Then the king looked about him, and then was he    ware of all his host and of all his good knights    were left no more on live but two knights, that    was Sir Lucan de Butlere, and his brother Sir    Bedivere: and they were full sore wounded.  Jesu    mercy, said the king, where are all my noble    knights becomen?  Alas that ever I should see this    doleful day.  For now, said Arthur, I am come to    mine end.  But would to God that I wist where were    that traitor Sir Mordred, that hath caused all    this mischief.  Then was King Arthur ware where Sir    Mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap    of dead men.  Now give me my spear, said Arthur    unto Sir Lucan, for yonder I have espied the    traitor that all this woe hath wrought.  Sir, let    him be, said Sir Lucan, for he is unhappy; and if    ye pass this unhappy day, ye shall be right well    revenged upon him.  Good lord, remember ye of your    night's dream, and what the spirit of Sir Gawaine    told you this night, yet God of his great goodness    hath preserved you hitherto.  Therefore, for God's    sake, my lord, leave off by this. For blessed be    God ye have won the field: for here we be three    on live, and with Sir Mordred is none on live.    And if ye leave off now, this wicked day of    destiny is past.  Tide me death, betide me life,    saith the king, now I see him yonder alone, he    shall never escape mine hands, for at a better    avail shall I never have him.  God speed you well,    said Sir Bedivere.  Then the king gat his spear    in both his hands, and ran toward Sir Mordred    crying, Traitor, now is thy death day come.  And    when Sir Mordred heard Sir Arthur, he ran until    him with his sword drawn in his hand.  And then    King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield,    with a foin of his spear throughout the body more    than a fathom.  And when Sir Mordred felt that he    had his death's wound, he thrust himself, with    the might that he had, up to the butt of King    Arthur's spear.  And right so he smote his father    Arthur with his sword holden in both his hands,    on the side of the head, that the sword pierced    the helmet and the brain-pan, and therewithal    Sir Mordred fell stark dead to the earth.  And    the noble Arthur fell in a swoon to the earth,    and there he swooned oft-times--'\"  \"That is a good piece of war correspondence, Clarence; you are a first-rate newspaper man.  Well--is the king all right?  Did he get well?\"  \"Poor soul, no.  He is dead.\"  I was utterly stunned; it had not seemed to me that any wound could be mortal to him.  \"And the queen, Clarence?\"  \"She is a nun, in Almesbury.\"  \"What changes! and in such a short while.  It is inconceivable. What next, I wonder?\"  \"I can tell you what next.\"  \"Well?\"  \"Stake our lives and stand by them!\"  \"What do you mean by that?\"  \"The Church is master now.  The Interdict included you with Mordred; it is not to be removed while you remain alive.  The clans are gathering.  The Church has gathered all the knights that are left alive, and as soon as you are discovered we shall have business on our hands.\"  \"Stuff!  With our deadly scientific war-material; with our hosts of trained--\"  \"Save your breath--we haven't sixty faithful left!\"  \"What are you saying?  Our schools, our colleges, our vast workshops, our--\"  \"When those knights come, those establishments will empty themselves and go over to the enemy.  Did you think you had educated the superstition out of those people?\"  \"I certainly did think it.\"  \"Well, then, you may unthink it.  They stood every strain easily --until the Interdict.  Since then, they merely put on a bold outside--at heart they are quaking.  Make up your mind to it --when the armies come, the mask will fall.\"  \"It's hard news.  We are lost.  They will turn our own science against us.\"  \"No they won't.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because I and a handful of the faithful have blocked that game. I'll tell you what I've done, and what moved me to it.  Smart as you are, the Church was smarter.  It was the Church that sent you cruising--through her servants, the doctors.\"  \"Clarence!\"  \"It is the truth. "]]]
