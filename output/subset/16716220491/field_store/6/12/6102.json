Then, with a sigh, she turned to Hilyard, and resumed more calmly, \"Yes, thou art right, --adversity hath taught me much.  And though adversity will too often but feed and not starve our pride, yet thou--thou hast made me know that there is more of true nobility in the blunt Children of the People than in many a breast over which flows the kingly robe. Forgive me, and the daughter of Charlemagne shall yet be a mother to the Commons, who claim thee as their brother!\"  Thoroughly melted, Robin of Redesdale bowed over the hand held to his lips, and his rough voice trembled as he answered, though that answer took but the shape of prayer.  \"And now,\" said the princess, smiling, \"to make peace lasting between us, I conquer myself, I yield to thy counsels.  Once more the fugitive, I abandon the city that contains Henry's unheeded prison. See, I am ready.  Who will know Margaret in this attire?  Lead on!\"  Rejoiced to seize advantage of this altered and submissive mood, Robin instantly took the way through a narrow passage, to a small door communicating with the river.  There Hugh was waiting in a small boat, moored to the damp and discoloured stairs.  Robin, by a gesture, checked the man's impulse to throw himself at the feet of the pretended priest, and bade him put forth his best speed. The princess seated herself by the helm, and the little boat cut rapidly through the noble stream.  Galleys, gay and gilded, with armorial streamers, and filled with nobles and gallants, passed them, noisy with mirth or music, on their way.  These the fallen sovereign heeded not; but, with all her faults, the woman's heart beating in her bosom--she who in prosperity had so often wrought ruin, and shame, and woe to her gentle lord; she who had been reckless of her trust as queen; and incurred grave--but, let us charitably hope, unjust-- suspicion of her faith as wife, still fixed her eyes on the gloomy tower that contained her captive husband, and felt that she could have forgotten a while even the loss of power if but permitted to fall on that plighted heart, and weep over the past with the woe-worn bridegroom of her youth.     CHAPTER II.  IN WHICH ARE LAID OPEN TO THE READER THE CHARACTER OF EDWARD THE FOURTH AND THAT OF HIS COURT, WITH THE MACHINATIONS OF THE WOODVILLES AGAINST THE EARL OF WARWICK.  Scarcely need it be said to those who have looked with some philosophy upon human life, that the young existence of Master Marmaduke Nevile, once fairly merged in the great common sea, will rarely reappear before us individualized and distinct.  The type of the provincial cadet of the day hastening courtwards to seek his fortune, he becomes lost amidst the gigantic characters and fervid passions that alone stand forth in history.  And as, in reading biography, we first take interest in the individual who narrates, but if his career shall pass into that broader and more stirring life, in which he mingles with men who have left a more dazzling memory than his own, we find the interest change from the narrator to those by whom he is surrounded and eclipsed,--so, in this record of a time, we scarce follow our young adventurer into the court of the brilliant Edward ere the scene itself allures and separates us from our guide; his mission is, as it were, well-nigh done.  We leave, then, for a while this bold, frank nature-fresh from the health of the rural life--gradually to improve, or deprave itself, in the companionship it finds.  The example of the Lords Hastings, Scales, and Worcester, and the accomplishments of the two younger Princes of York, especially the Duke of Gloucester, had diffused among the younger and gayer part of the court that growing taste for letters which had somewhat slept during the dynasty of the House of Lancaster; and Marmaduke's mind became aware that learning was no longer the peculiar distinction of the Church, and that Warwick was behind his age when he boasted \"that the sword was more familiar to him than the pen.\"  He had the sagacity to perceive that the alliance with the great earl did not conduce to his popularity at court; and even in the king's presence, the courtiers permitted themselves many taunts and jests at the fiery Warwick, which they would have bitten out their tongues ere they would have vented before the earl himself.  But though the Nevile sufficiently controlled his native candour not to incur unprofitable quarrel by ill-mannered and unseasonable defence of the hero-baron when sneered at or assailed, he had enough of the soldier and the man in him not to be tainted by the envy of the time and place,--not to lose his gratitude to his patron, nor his respect for the bulwark of the country.  Rather, it may be said, that Warwick gained in his estimation whenever compared with the gay and silken personages who avenged themselves by words for his superiority in deeds.  Not only as a soldier, but as a statesman, the great and peculiar merits of the earl were visible in all those measures which emanated solely from himself.  Though so indifferently educated, his busy, practical career, his affable mixing with all classes, and his hearty, national sympathies made him so well acquainted with the interests of his country and the habits of his countrymen, that he was far more fitted to rule than the scientific Worcester or the learned Scales.  The Young Duke of Gloucester presented a marked contrast to the general levity of the court, in speaking of this powerful nobleman.  He never named him but with respect, and was pointedly courteous to even the humblest member of the earl's family.  In this he appeared to advantage by the side of Clarence, whose weakness of disposition made him take the tone of the society in which he was thrown, and who, while really loving Warwick, often smiled at the jests against him,--not, indeed, if uttered by the queen or her family, of whom he ill concealed his jealousy and hatred.  The whole court was animated and pregnant with a spirit of intrigue, which the artful cunning of the queen, the astute policy of Jacquetta, and the animosity of the different factions had fomented to a degree quite unknown under former reigns.  It was a place in which the wit of young men grew old rapidly; amidst stratagem, and plot, and ambitious design, and stealthy overreaching, the boyhood of Richard III.  passed to its relentless manhood: such is the inevitable fruit of that era in civilization when a martial aristocracy first begins to merge into a voluptuous court.  Through this moving and shifting web of ambition and intrigue the royal Edward moved with a careless grace: simple himself, because his object was won, and pleasure had supplanted ambition.  His indolent, joyous temper served to deaden his powerful intellect; or, rather, his intellect was now lost in the sensual stream through which it flowed. Ever in pursuit of some new face, his schemes and counterschemes were limited to cheat a husband or deceive a wife; and dexterous and successful no doubt they were.  But a vice always more destructive than the love of women began also to reign over him,--namely, the intemperance of the table.  The fastidious and graceful epicurism of the early Normans, inclined to dainties but abhorring excess, and regarding with astonished disdain the heavy meals and deep draughts of the Saxon, had long ceased to characterize the offspring of that noblest of all noble races.  Warwick, whose stately manliness was disgusted with whatever savoured of effeminacy or debauch, used to declare that he would rather fight fifty battles for Edward IV. than once sup with him!  Feasts were prolonged for hours, and the banquets of this king of the Middle Ages almost resembled those of the later Roman emperors.  The Lord Montagu did not share the abstemiousness of his brother of Warwick.  He was, next to Hastings, the king's chosen and most favourite companion.  He ate almost as much as the king, and drank very little less.  Of few courtiers could the same be said! Over the lavish profligacy and excess of the court, however, a veil dazzling to the young and high-spirited was thrown.  Edward was thoroughly the cavalier, deeply imbued with the romance of chivalry, and, while making the absolute woman his plaything, always treated the ideal woman as a goddess.  A refined gallantry, a deferential courtesy to dame and demoiselle, united the language of an Amadis with the licentiousness of a Gaolor; and a far more alluring contrast than the court of Charles II. presented to the grim Commonwealth seduced the vulgar in that of this most brave and most beautiful prince, when compared with the mournful and lugubrious circles in which Henry VI. had reigned and prayed.  Edward himself, too, it was so impossible to judge with severe justice, that his extraordinary popularity in London, where he was daily seen, was never diminished by his faults; he was so bold in the field, yet so mild in the chamber; when his passions slept, he was so thoroughly good-natured and social, so kind to all about his person, so hearty and gladsome in his talk and in his vices, so magnificent and so generous withal; and, despite his indolence, his capacities for business were marvellous,--and these last commanded the reverence of the good Londoners; he often administered justice himself, like the caliphs of the East, and with great acuteness and address.  Like most extravagant men, he had a wholesome touch of avarice.  That contempt for commerce which characterizes a modern aristocracy was little felt by the nobles of that day, with the exception of such blunt patricians as Lord Warwick or Raoul de Fulke.  The great House of De la Pole (Duke of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7718"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 04 (#2)"],["body","Suffolk), the heir of which married Edward's sister Elizabeth, had been founded by a merchant of Hull.  Earls and archbishops scrupled not to derive revenues from what we should now esteem the literal resources of trade.  [The Abbot of St. Alban's (temp. Henry III.) was a vendor of Yarmouth bloaters.  The Cistercian Monks were wool-merchants; and Macpherson tells us of a couple of Iceland bishops who got a license from Henry VI. for smuggling. (Matthew Paris.  Macpherson's \"Annals of Commerce,\" 10.)  As the Whig historians generally have thought fit to consider the Lancastrian cause the more \"liberal\" of the two, because Henry IV. was the popular choice, and, in fact, an elected, not an hereditary king, so it cannot be too emphatically repeated, that the accession of Edward IV. was the success of two new and two highly-- popular principles,--the one that of church reform, the other that of commercial calculation.  All that immense section, almost a majority of the people, who had been persecuted by the Lancastrian kings as Lollards, revenged on Henry the aggrieved rights of religious toleration.  On the other hand, though Henry IV., who was immeasurably superior to his warlike son in intellect and statesmanship, had favoured the growing commercial spirit, it had received nothing but injury under Henry V., and little better than contempt under Henry VI. The accession of the Yorkists was, then, on two grounds a great popular movement; and it was followed by a third advantage to the popular cause,--namely, in the determined desire both of Edward and Richard III. to destroy the dangerous influence of the old feudal aristocracy.  To this end Edward laboured in the creation of a court noblesse; and Richard, with the more dogged resolution that belonged to him, went at once to the root of the feudal power, in forbidding the nobles to give badges and liveries (this also was forbidden, it is true, by the edict of Edward IV. as well as by his predecessors from the reign of Richard II.; but no king seems to have had the courage to enforce the prohibition before Richard III.),--in other words, to appropriate armies under the name of retainers.  Henry VII., in short, did not originate the policy for which he has monopolized the credit; he did but steadily follow out the theory of raising the middle class and humbling the baronial, which the House of York first put into practice.] shown itself on this point more liberal in its policy, more free from feudal prejudices, than that of the Plantagenets.  Even Edward II. was tenacious of the commerce with Genoa, and an intercourse with the merchant princes of that republic probably served to associate the pursuits of commerce with the notion of rank and power.  Edward III. is still called the Father of English Commerce; but Edward IV. carried the theories of his ancestors into far more extensive practice, for his own personal profit.  This king, so indolent in the palace, was literally the most active merchant in the mart.  He traded largely in ships of his own, freighted with his own goods; and though, according to sound modern economics, this was anything but an aid to commerce, seeing that no private merchant could compete with a royal trader who went out and came in duty-free, yet certainly the mere companionship and association in risk and gain, and the common conversation that it made between the affable monarch and the homeliest trader, served to increase his popularity, and to couple it with respect for practical sense.  Edward IV. was in all this pre- eminently THE MAN OF HIS AGE,--not an inch behind it or before!  And, in addition to this happy position, he was one of those darlings of Nature, so affluent and blest in gifts of person, mind, and outward show, that it is only at the distance of posterity we ask why men of his own age admired the false, the licentious, and the cruel, where those contemporaries, over-dazzled, saw but the heroic and the joyous, the young, the beautiful,--the affable to friend, and the terrible to foe!  It was necessary to say thus much on the commercial tendencies of Edward, because, at this epoch, they operated greatly, besides other motives shortly to be made clear, in favour of the plot laid by the enemies of the Earl of Warwick, to dishonour that powerful minister and drive him from the councils of the king.  One morning Hastings received a summons to attend Edward, and on entering the royal chamber, he found already assembled Lord Rivers, the queen's father, Anthony Woodville, and the Earl of Worcester.  The king seemed thoughtful; he beckoned Hastings to approach, and placed in his hand a letter, dated from Rouen.  \"Read and judge, Hastings,\" said Edward.  The letter was from a gentleman in Warwick's train.  It gave a glowing account of the honours accorded to the earl by Louis XI., greater than those ever before manifested to a subject, and proceeded thus:--  \"But it is just I should apprise you that there be strange rumours as to the marvellous love that King Louis shows my lord the earl.  He lodgeth in the next house to him, and hath even had an opening made in the partition-wall between his own chamber and the earl's.  Men do say that the king visits him nightly, and there be those who think that so much stealthy intercourse between an English ambassador and the kinsman of Margaret of Anjou bodeth small profit to our grace the king.\"  \"I observe,\" said Hastings, glancing to the superscription, \"that this letter is addressed to my Lord Rivers.  Can he avouch the fidelity of his correspondent?\"  \"Surely, yes,\" answered Rivers; \"it is a gentleman of my own blood.\"  \"Were he not so accredited,\" returned Hastings, \"I should question the truth of a man who can thus consent to play the spy upon his lord and superior.\"  \"The public weal justifies all things,\" said the Earl of Worcester (who, though by marriage nearly connected to Warwick, eyed his power with the jealous scorn which the man of book-lore often feels for one whose talent lies in action),--\"so held our masters in all state- craft, the Greek and Roman.\"  \"Certes,\" said Sir Anthony Woodville, \"it grieveth the pride of an English knight that we should be beholden for courtesies to the born foe of England, which I take the Frenchman naturally to be.\"  \"Ah,\" said Edward, smiling sternly, \"I would rather be myself, with banner and trump, before the walls of Paris, than sending my cousin the earl to beg the French king's brother to accept my sister as a bride.  And what is to become of my good merchant-ships if Burgundy take umbrage and close its ports?\"  \"Beau sire,\" said Hastings,\" thou knowest how little cause I have to love the Earl of Warwick.  We all here, save your gracious self, bear the memory of some affront rendered to us by his pride and heat of mood! but in this council I must cease to be William de Hastings, and be all and wholly the king's servant.  I say first, then, with reference to these noble peers, that Warwick's faith to the House of York is too well proven to become suspected because of the courtesies of King Louis,--an artful craft, as it clearly seems to me, of the wily Frenchman, to weaken your throne, by provoking your distrust of its great supporter.  Fall we not into such a snare!  Moreover, we may be sure that Warwick cannot be false, if he achieve the object of his embassy,--namely, detach Louis from the side of Margaret and Lancaster by close alliance with Edward and York.  Secondly, sire, with regard to that alliance, which it seems you would repent,--I hold now, as I have held ever, that it is a master-stroke in policy, and the earl in this proves his sharp brain worthy his strong arm; for as his highness the Duke of Gloucester hath now clearly discovered that Margaret of Anjou has been of late in London, and that treasonable designs were meditated, though now frustrated, so we may ask why the friends of Lancaster really stood aloof; why all conspiracy was, and is, in vain?--Because, sire, of this very alliance with France; because the gold and subsidies of Louis are not forthcoming; because the Lancastrians see that if once Lord Warwick win France from the Red Rose, nothing short of such a miracle as their gaining Warwick instead can give a hope to their treason.  Your Highness fears the anger of Burgundy, and the suspension of your trade with the Flemings; but-- forgive me--this is not reasonable.  Burgundy dare not offend England, matched, as its arms are, with France; the Flemings gain more by you than you gain by the Flemings, and those interested burghers will not suffer any prince's quarrel to damage their commerce.  Charolois may bluster and threat, but the storm will pass, and Burgundy will be contented, if England remain neutral in the feud with France.  All these reasons, sire, urge me to support my private foe, the Lord Warwick, and to pray you to give no ear to the discrediting his Honour and his embassy.\"  The profound sagacity of these remarks, the repute of the speaker, and the well-known grudge between him and Warwick, for reasons hereafter to be explained, produced a strong effect upon the intellect of Edward, always vigorous, save when clouded with passion.  But Rivers, whose malice to the earl was indomitable, coldly recommenced,--  \"With submission to the Lord Hastings, sire, whom we know that love sometimes blinds, and whose allegiance to the earl's fair sister, the Lady of Bonville, perchance somewhat moves him to forget the day when Lord Warwick--\"  \"Cease, my lord,\" said Hastings, white with suppressed anger; \"these references beseem not the councils of grave men.\"  \"Tut, Hastings,\" said Edward, laughing merrily, \"women mix themselves up in all things: board or council, bed or battle,--wherever there is mischief astir, there, be sure, peeps a woman's sly face from her wimple.  Go on, Rivers.\"  \"Your pardon, my Lord Hastings,\" said Rivers, \"I knew not my thrust went so home; there is another letter I have not yet laid before "]]]
