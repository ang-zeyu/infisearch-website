But it did for me what it does for many a fellow. It made me forget my soul. Sport did a lot for me, I know, but sport became my world. The life I lived there was wholesome enough, but at the best what a poor, contracted, limited thing is the body, and its joy. And what a big, splendid world I've found the door to now.\"  \"How did it come about, Harry?\" I said, and the frost and the bitterness and the anger against God were all gone out of my heart and voice.  \"Well, I don't quite know. That's the queer thing about it. I don't deny I was a bit savage at first at what had happened. And I often wished I were dead, for I saw my old self wasn't much good for this new life I was up against. Then one Sunday the padre, who was a very decent sort, gave us a straight talk that opened my eyes a bit. He was speaking about Paul and the difference Christ made in his life. Paul was a splendid fellow, and as good as good could be, and just like many a man to-day who seems all right without Christ. But what a difference Christ made in him for all that! And how He made the old Saul of Tarsus seem a poor thing in comparison with Paul the apostle! There was something, too, about Paul's thorn in the flesh, but I forget that bit. Anyhow I did some furious thinking that Sunday in Cairo, though I saw nothing clearly, and didn't lay much store by my own future.  \"That night the strange thing happened. I woke up in the early hours when no one was astir, and I saw a man come in by the door and walk down the ward. He gave a sort of understanding, tender look at every face as he passed, and when he saw that I was awake he came close beside me and held my hand for a moment. Then he said, 'Will you let me help you with this burden of yours?' I thought at first it was the new doctor we were expecting. Then I knew quite suddenly that it was _The Comrade in White_, and that He wanted me very much to say 'Yes.' And as I said it I felt the first real happiness that I had known since I was wounded. And then He smiled and went away.  \"I told myself next day that it was a dream, and perhaps it was, but that strange, odd happiness has never left me since. I wouldn't be back again in the old way, not for all the world could give me, not even to have my leg restored.\"  \"And is He really helping you with your burden?\" I whispered.  \"Why, Mary child, can't you see,\" he exclaimed, with his merry laugh; \"can't you see that He has carried my burden quite away? I was but half a man before. He has made me whole.\"     IV. THE PRAYER CIRCLE     \" ... More things are wrought by prayer   Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice   Rise like a fountain for me night and day.   For what are men better than sheep or goats   That nourish a blind life within the brain,   If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer   Both for themselves and those who call them friend?   For so the whole round earth is every way   Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.\"     --_The Passing of Arthur_, ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON.     \"Fight the good fight with all thy might,   Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right,   Lay hold on life, and it shall be   Thy joy and crown eternally.\"         *       *       *       *       *    \"Faint not, nor fear, His arms are near,   He changeth not, and thou art dear:   Only believe, and thou shalt see   That Christ is all in all to thee.\"    --J.S.B. MONSELL.    THE PRAYER CIRCLE  Lieutenant Roger Fenton had a lump in his throat when he said good-bye to his boys. There they were in a bunch on the station platform, the ten wayward lads into whom he had sought to instil the fear of God on Tuesday evenings in winter, and with whom he had rambled and played cricket every Saturday afternoon in summer. Boys of fourteen to seventeen are a tough proposition, and though Fenton would answer for their bowling and batting he wasn't over sanguine about their religion. But they had filled a big place in his lonely life in the dull little country town, and now he had to leave them and lose them. For the great call had reached him, and he bore the King's commission, and in his heart of hearts he had the feeling that he would never come back.  Now the chaff and the parting words of good luck were over, and the train was panting to be off. \"Boys,\" he cried suddenly, \"I want you to do something for me, something hard.\" \"Anything you like, sir,\" they answered eagerly. But their faces fell when they heard their teacher's word. \"Look here,\" he said, \"it's this. You'll meet in the old place every Tuesday evening for a few minutes and pray for me that I may do my duty, and, if it please God, that I may come back to you all. And I'll pray for you at the same time even if I'm in the thick of battle. Is it a bargain?\"  I wish you had seen the dismay on those ten faces. It was any odds on their blurting out a shamefaced refusal, but Ted Harper, their acknowledged chief, pulled himself together just in time, and called out as the train began to move:--\"We'll do it, sir. I don't know how we'll manage it, but we'll do our best. We'll not go back on you.\"  As Fenton sank into his corner he was aware of the mocking looks of his brother officers. \"I say,\" said one of them, \"you don't really think those chaps are going to hold a prayer-meeting for you every week, and if they did you can't believe it would stop an enemy's bullet or turn an enemy's shell. It's all very well to be pious, but that's a bit too thick.\" Fenton flushed, but he took it in good part. \"Prayer's a big bit of our religion,\" he said, \"and I've a notion these prayers will help me. Anyhow I'm sure my lads will do their part. Where Ted Harper leads, they follow.\"  And sure enough the boys did their part. It was fine to see them starting out in the wrong direction, and twisting and doubling through the crooked lanes till they worked round to the Mission Hall, and then in with a rush and a scuttle, that as few as possible might see. The doings of the Fenton crowd, as they were known locally, were the talk of the town in those first days after Roger departed. Would they meet? Would they keep it up? Would they bear the ridicule of the other boys of their own age? And how in the world would they pray?  Time answered all these questions except the last. They met, they continued to meet, they faced ridicule like heroes. But how did they pray? That mystery was as deep and insoluble as before, for whatever awful oath of secrecy bound them to silence not a whisper of the doings of those Tuesday evenings was divulged to the outside world.  I was the only one who ever knew, and I found out by chance. Ted Harper had borrowed \"Fights for the Flag\" from me, and when I got it back there was a soiled piece of paper in it with something written in Ted's ungainly hand. I thought he had been copying a passage, and anxious to see what had struck him, I opened the sheet out and read these words:--\"O God, it's a hard business praying. But Roger made me promise. And you know how decent he's been to me and the crowd. Listen to us now, and excuse the wrong words, and bring him back safe. And, O God, make him the bravest soldier that ever was, and give him the V.C. That's what we all want for him. And don't let the war be long, for Christ's sake. Amen.\"  I felt a good deal ashamed of myself when I came to the end of this artless prayer. I had got their secret. I could see them kneeling round the Mission forms, two or three with crumpled papers in their hands. They were unutterably shy of religious expression, and to read was their only chance. The boys on whom the fatal lot fell the previous Tuesday were bound to appear with their written devotions a week later. This war has given us back the supernatural, but no miracle seems more wonderful to me than those ten lads and their ill-written prayers. And, remember, that liturgical service lasted six months, and never a break in the Tuesday meeting. What a grand thing a boy's heart is, when you capture its loyalty and its affection!  It was a black day when the news came. The local Territorials had advanced too far on the wing of a great offensive, and had been almost annihilated. The few survivors had dug themselves in, and held on till that bitter Tuesday faded into darkness and night. When relief came, one man was left alive. He was wounded in four places, but he was still loading and firing, and he wept when they picked him up and carried him away for first aid. That solitary hero, absolutely the only survivor of our local regiment, was Lieutenant Roger Fenton, V.C.  When his wounds were healed, and the King had done the needful bit of decoration, we got him home. We did not make the fuss they did in some places. Our disaster was too awful, and the pathos of that solitary survivor too piercing. But some of us were at the station, and there in the front row were the ten men of prayer. Poor Roger quite broke down when he saw them. And he could find no words to thank them. But he wrung their hands till they winced with the pain of that iron grip.  That night I got a chance of a talk with him alone. He was too modest to tell me anything of his own great exploit. But there was evidently something he wanted to say, and it was as if he did not know how to begin. At last he said, \"I have a story to tell that not one in fifty would listen to. That Tuesday evening when I was left alone, and had given up all hope, I remembered it was the hour of the old meeting, and I kept my promise and prayed for the boys of my Class. Then everything around me faded from my mind, and I saw the dear lads in the Mission Room at prayer. I don't mean that I went back in memory. I knew with an absolute certainty that I was there invisible in that night's meeting. Whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot say, but there I was, watching and listening.\"  \"How wonderful!\" I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9388"],["title","The Red Flower: Poems Written in War Time (#1)"],["body"," mounting wind in the pines;   And the sobs of the mounting waves that rise     In the dark of the troubled deep   To break on the beach in fiery lines.     Echo the far-off roll of thunder,         Rumbling loud     And ever louder, under     The blue-black curtain of cloud,     Where the lightning serpents gleam,       Echo the moaning     Of the forest in its sleep     Like a giant groaning   In the torment of a dream.      Now an interval of quiet     For a moment holds the air     In the breathless hush     Of a silent prayer.      Then the sudden rush     Of the rain, and the riot     Of the shrieking, tearing gale     Breaks loose in the night,     With a fusillade of hail!     Hear the forest fight,   With its tossing arms that crack and clash     In the thunder's cannonade,     While the lightning's forkèd flash   Brings the old hero-trees to the ground with a crash!   Hear the breakers' deepening roar,     Driven like a herd of cattle     In the wild stampede of battle,   Trampling, trampling, trampling, to overwhelm the shore.      Is it the end of all?     Will the land crumble and fall?     Nay, for a voice replies     Out of the hidden skies,   \"Thus far, O sea, shalt thou go,   So long, O wind, shalt thou blow:   Return to your bounds and cease,   And let the earth have peace!\"      O Music, lead the way--       The stormy night is past,   Lift up our heads to greet the day,       And the joy of things that last.

FRANCE AND BELGIUM       THE BELLS OF MALINES    AUGUST 17, 1914     The gabled roofs of old Malines   Are russet red and gray and green,   And o'er them in the sunset hour   Looms, dark and huge, St. Rombold's tower.   High in that rugged nest concealed,   The sweetest bells that ever pealed,   The deepest bells that ever rung,   The lightest bells that ever sung,   Are waiting for the master's hand   To fling their music o'er the land.    And shall they ring to-night, Malines?   In nineteen hundred and fourteen,   The frightful year, the year of woe,   When fire and blood and rapine flow   Across the land from lost Liége,   Storm-driven by the German rage?   The other carillons have ceased;   Fallen is Hasselt, fallen Diesl,   From Ghent and Bruges no voices come,   Antwerp is silent, Brussels dumb!    But in thy belfry, O Malines,   The master of the bells unseen   Has climbed to where the keyboard stands,--   To-night his heart is in his hands!   Once more, before invasion's hell   Breaks round the tower he loves so well,   Once more he strikes the well-worn keys,   And sends aërial harmonies   Far-floating through the twilight dim   In patriot song and holy hymn.    O listen, burghers of Malines!   Soldier and workman, pale béguine.   And mother with a trembling flock   Of children clinging to thy frock,--   Look up and listen, listen all!   What tunes are these that gently fall   Around you like a benison?   \"The Flemish Lion,\" \"Brabançonne,\"   \"O brave Liége,\" and all the airs   That Belgium in her bosom bears.    Ring up, ye silvery octaves high,   Whose notes like circling swallows fly;   And ring, each old sonorous bell,--   \"Jesu,\" \"Maria,\" \"Michaël!\"   Weave in and out, and high and low,   The magic music that you know,   And let it float and flutter down   To cheer the heart of the troubled town.   Ring out, \"Salvator,\" lord of all,--   \"Roland\" in Ghent may hear thee call!    O brave bell-music of Malines,   In this dark hour how much you mean!   The dreadful night of blood and tears   Sweeps down on Belgium, but she hears   Deep in her heart the melody   Of songs she learned when she was free.   She will not falter, faint, nor fail,   But fight until her rights prevail   And all her ancient belfries ring   \"The Flemish Lion,\" \"God Save the King!\"       THE NAME OF FRANCE     Give us a name to fill the mind   With the shining thoughts that lead mankind,   The glory of learning, the joy of art,--   A name that tells of a splendid part.   In long, long toil and the strenuous fight   Of the human race to win its way   From the feudal darkness into the day   Of Freedom, Brotherhood, Equal Right,--   A name like a star, a name of light.   I give you _France_!    Give us a name to stir the blood   With a warmer glow and a swifter flood,   At the touch of a courage that knows not fear,--   A name like the sound of a trumpet, clear.   And silver-sweet, and iron-strong,   That calls three million men to their feet,   Ready to march, and steady to meet   The foes who threaten that name with wrong,--   A name that rings like a battle-song.   I give you _France_!    Give us a name to move the heart   With the strength that noble griefs impart,   A name that speaks of the blood outpoured   To save mankind from the sway of the sword,--   A name that calls on the world to share   In the burden of sacrificial strife   When the cause at stake is the world's free life   And the rule of the people everywhere,--   A name like a vow, a name like a prayer.   I give you _France_!    The Hague, September, 1916.       JEANNE D'ARC RETURNS    1914 1916     What hast thou done, O womanhood of France,     Mother and daughter, sister, sweetheart, wife,     What hast thou done, amid this fateful strife,   To prove the pride of thine inheritance.

I hear thy voice with tears and courage rife,--     Smiling against the swords that seek thy life--   Make answer in a noble utterance:   \"I give France all I have, and all she asks.     Would it were more! Ah, let her ask and take;   My hands to nurse her wounded, do her tasks,--     My feet to run her errands through the dark,--   My heart to bleed in triumph for her sake,--     And all my soul to follow thee, Jeanne d'Arc!\"     April 16, 1916.       INTERLUDES IN HOLLAND       THE HEAVENLY HILLS OF HOLLAND     The heavenly hills of Holland,--     How wondrously they rise   Above the smooth green pastures     Into the azure skies!   With blue and purple hollows,     With peaks of dazzling snow,   Along the far horizon     The clouds are marching slow,    No mortal fool has trodden     The summits of that range,   Nor walked those mystic valleys     Whose colors ever change;   Yet we possess their beauty,     And visit them in dreams,   While the ruddy gold of sunset     From cliff and canyon gleams.    In days of cloudless weather     They melt into the light;   When fog and mist surround us     They're hidden from our sight;   But when returns a season     Clear shining after rain,   While the northwest wind is blowing,     We see the hills again.    The old Dutch painters loved them,     Their pictures show them clear,--   Old Hobbema and Ruysduel,     Van Goyen and Vermeer,   Above the level landscape,     Rich polders, long-armed mills,   Canals and ancient cities,--     Float Holland's heavenly hills.     The Hague, November, 1916.       THE PROUD LADY     When Stävoren town was in its prime     And queened the Zuyder Zee,   Its ships went out to every clime     With costly merchantry.    A lady dwelt in that rich town,     The fairest in all the land;   She walked abroad in a velvet gown,     With many rings on her hand.    Her hair was bright as the beaten gold,     Her lips as coral red,   Her roving eyes were blue and bold,     And her heart with pride was fed.    For she was proud of her father's ships,     As she watched them gayly pass;   And pride looked out of her eyes and lips     When she saw herself in the glass.    \"Now come,\" she said to the captains ten,     Who were ready to put to sea,   \"Ye are all my men and my father's men,     And what will ye do for me?\"    \"Go north and south, go east and west,     And get me gifts,\" she said.   \"And he who bringeth me home the best,     With that man will I wed.\"    So they all fared forth, and sought with care     In many a famous mart,   For satins and silks and jewels rare,     To win that lady's heart.    She looked at them all with never a thought     And careless put them by;   \"I am not fain of the things ye brought,     Enough of these have I.\"    The last that came was the head of the fleet,     His name was Jan Borel;   He bent his knee at the lady's feet,--     In truth he loved her well.    \"I've brought thee home the best i' the world,     A shipful of Danzig corn!\"   She stared at him long; her red lips curled,     Her blue eyes filled with scorn.    \"Now out on thee, thou feckless kerl,     A loon thou art,\" she said.   \"Am I a starving beggar girl?     Shall I ever lack for bread?\"    \"Go empty all thy sacks of grain     Into the nearest sea,   And never show thy face again     To make a mock of me.\"    Young Jan Borel, he answered naught,     But in the harbor cast   The sacks of golden corn he brought,     And groaned when fell the last.    Then Jan Borel, he hoisted sail,     And out to sea he bore;   He passed the Helder in a gale     And came again no more.    But the grains of corn went drifting down     Like devil-scattered seed,   To sow the harbor of the town     With a wicked growth of weed.    The roots were thick and the silt and sand     Were gathered day by day,   Till not a furlong out from land     A shoal had barred the way.    Then Stävoren town saw evil years,     No ships could out or in.   The boats lay rolling at the piers,     And the mouldy grain in the bin.    The grass-grown streets were all forlorn,     The town in ruin stood,   The lady's velvet gown was torn,     Her rings were sold for food.    Her father had perished long ago,     But the lady held her pride.   She walked with a scornful step and slow,     Till at last in her rags she died.
