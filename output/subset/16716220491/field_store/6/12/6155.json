One of the pimps for Albani with billets doux very impressive      Called me to Ostia once. Quattro Fontani next time.    Who was it did not appear there? Why, who but the very same girl who      Hated with all of her heart stockings both violet and red.    For: 'In the end you poor girls are the ones who are sure to be cheated.'      So said my father although--Mother was not much impressed.    Father was right. Here I stand in the end being cheated and scolded.      You don't believe your own words. They're your excuse to escape.    Go, then. Unworthy of women are men. We, who carry your children      Next to our hearts, in these hearts loyalty we bear you, too.    As for you men, when you've poured out your potency in our embraces      And your desires dissipate, love with them passes away.\"    These things expressed, and taking her child from its chair, my beloved      Presses it close to her heart, kisses it, tears in her eyes.    I'm now so very ashamed of myself for having permitted      Gossip of neighbors to spoil picture so eloquent.    For a short moment a fire may burn darkly while smoke swirls about it.      Water dashed on the coals suddenly smothers their glow.    Rapidly then renewed heat overcomes those lowering vapors,      Sends up a flame that anew bright and more powerful gleams.     IX    How very happy I am here in Rome when I think of the bad days      Far back there in the north, wrapped in a grayish light.    Over my head there the heavens weighed down so dismal and gloomy;      Colorless, formless, that world round this exhausted man lay.    Seeking myself in myself, an unsatisfied spirit, I brooded,      Spying out pathways dark, lost in dreary reflection.    Here in an æther more clear now a luster encircles my forehead.      Phoebus the god evokes forms, clear are his colors by day.    Bright with the stars comes the evening, ringing with songs that are tender,      And the glow of the moon, brighter than northern sun.    What blessedness mortals may know! Am I now dreaming? Or welcomes      Jupiter, Father, as guest--me, to ambrosial halls?    See, I lie here extending my arms toward your knees. I am praying:      Hospitality's god, Jupiter Xenius! Hear:    How I am come to this place I no longer can say--I was      Seized up by Hebe.  'Twas she led to this sacred hill.    Did you command her a hero to seek and deliver before you?      May be she erred. Then forgive. Let her mistake profit me!    Does not Fortuna, your daughter, when strewing her glorious presents,      After the manner of girls, yield to each passing whim?    You, O hospitable god, will by no means now banish a stranger      From your Olympian heights back to the base earth again.    \"Poet, come to your senses!\"--Forgive me, Jupiter, is not      Rome's Capitoline Hill second Olympus to you?    Suffer me, Jupiter, here and let Hermes guide me at last then      Past Cestius' Tomb gently to Orkus below.     X    When you were small, you say, neither did others consider you f air, nor      Even your mother find praise--and I believe it--    Till you grew bigger, developing quietly over the years. I      Picture you to myself as an unusual child.    Also the blossoms on grapevines are wanting in shape and in color,      Although the fruit when it's ripe pleases both mankind and gods.     XI    Kindling autumnal fire in a rustic, convivial fireplace      (How the sticks crackle and spew flames and glittering sparks!)    Strikes me especially pleasant this evening.  Before all my tinder      Dies away into coals, coals then to ashes decline,    She will be back and new faggots as well as big logs will be blazing,      Making a festival where lovers will warm up the night.    Then in the morning, officious, she'll leave the bed of her lover,      Rouse adroitly the flames out from their ashes anew.    Cupid has lent to her above others the gift of cajoling      Up from the ashes desire, just when slumber's begun.     XII    All of those greats: Alexander, Caesar and Henry and Fredrick,      Gladly would share with me half of their hard fought renown,    Could I but grant them my bed for one single night, and its comfort,      But the poor wretches are held stark in cold Orkian grip.    Therefore, ye living, rejoice that love keeps you warm for a while yet,      Until cold Lethe anoints, captures your foot in its flight.     XIII    They are for you, O ye graces, just a few leaves by a poet      Onto your pure altar laid, buds of the rose beside,    Offered in confidence.  Artists enjoy ateliers which are furnished      So as to make for a space Pantheon-like in decor:    Jupiter lowers that godly brow while his Juno looks upward;      Phoebus takes forward strides, shaking his curly head;    While phlegmatic Minerva peers down on us, frivolous Hermes      Seems to be looking askance, roguish, though tender as well.    But it's to Bacchus, the sensuous dreamer, Cythera sends glances      Bathed in sweetest desire--even in marble they're damp.    Thinking about his embrace and its pleasures, she seems to be asking      Shouldn't our glorious son here at our side stand erect?     XIV    Can't you hear voices, beloved, out on the Via Flamina?      Reapers are now going home, back from harvesting grain.    They had journeyed to Rome from afar, and here plaited for Ceres      Wreaths which the Romans today scorn to make for themselves.    Festivals no longer celebrate Ceres, the nourishing goddess      Who replaced acorns of old, giving man golden wheat.    Let us commemorate her then ourselves in festival private      (Two constitute a whole tribe, when they are two in love).    Have you by any chance heard how that mystical, strange celebration      Followed victorious troops back from Eleusis to Rome?    Greeks were the ones who began it, and only to Greeks they proclaimed it      Even within Roman walls: \"Come to the sanctified night.\"    Those who were not of the cult kept their distance; neophytes trembled,      Waiting in garments of white, symbol of all that is pure.    Then the initiates must aimlessly wander about through the eerie      Circles of figures as if pilgriming through their own dreams.    Snakes on the ground were writhing about. Now virgins came bearing      Caskets securely locked, richly wreathéd with grain.    Surely the gestures of murmuring priests must contain some deep meaning--      Impatient acolytes wait, anxiously hoping for light.    Not until after many a testing and trial did they discover      What, within sacred ring, secretive image concealed.    What was this mystery other than this:   that Demeter, goddess,      Once upon a time had to a hero been kind.    It was to Jason, powerful king of the Cretans, she granted      Of her immortal self hidden sweet parts to explore.    That made the fortune of Crete! The marital bed of the goddess      Soon grew pregnant with grain, heavy her bounteous fields.    As for the rest of the world, it languished away, while Ceres,      Derelict of her true task, dalliance offered in love.    --Now the initiate youths, having followed this tale, all astonished,      Turned and beckoned their loves--love, do you comprehend?    See there the sacred shade beneath that bushy-boughed myrtle?      Our satisfaction will there scarcely endanger a world.     XV    Cupid is always a scoundrel, and if you believe him he'll cheat you.      Here's what the hypocrite said: \"Trust me just once more, this time.    I have the best of intentions toward you who have now dedicated--      I recognize it with thanks--life and writings to me.    Lo, I have followed you hither to Rome, and I'd like to do something      Here in this far away land pleasing to such an old friend.    Every traveller I've ever known has complained of poor treatment:      He whom I recommend treatment delicious receives.    You've now regarded with awe all the structures which lie here in ruins,      Cultivated your eye, sensing each hallowéd space.    How you've revered the formative will of those ancient artists!      In their own ateliers often I 've visited them.    As for their works, why, I formed those myself--now this time I'm boasting      Not. Oh come now, admit what I am saying is true.    Where are your own creations, your service to me having slackened?      Where is invention's glow now? Where is the color all gone?    Friend, do you hope you can create again? --The school of the Ancients      Yet remains open.  Its gates, years have not closed them to you.    I am eternally young, and as teacher I still love the young ones.      Wisdom that comes with old age pleases me not. Listen here:    Wasn't antiquity young when those fortunate Ancients were living?      Happy then be your life, too: in it antiquity lives.    Where will you find a fit theme for your song? --It is I must provide it.      As for a style truly grand, love can alone give you that.\"    All of these claims that sophist asserted. Could I contradict him?      I am wont to obey, when my commander decrees.    Treacherous now he is keeping his word: giving me themes for my poems      While he is stealing my time, potency, presence of mind.    Gazing into her eyes, holding hands, giving kisses, exchanging      Syllables sweet and those words lovers alone understand,    Murmuring our conversations we stutter in sweet oratory.      Hymns of such sort pass away, wanting prosodical tact.    Goddess of morning, Aurora, as friend of my muse I once knew you.      Has the unprincipled god, Cupid, seduced you now too?    So that these mornings you come as his sweetheart, awakening me at      His festive altar again, where I must celebrate him?    Here on my breast flows her hair, an abundance of curls, while her head rests,      Pressing my arm as it's bent, so as to pillow her neck.    What a delicious condition, if only these"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7889"],["title","Erotica Romana (#2)"],["body","tranquil moments      Could in my memory fix firmly that image of joy    When the night rocked us to sleep--but in slumber she's moving away now,      From my side turns, as she goes leaving her hand in my hand.    Love in our hearts makes us one, as the genuine need there stays constant;      Only returning desire knows oscillation or change.    Gently her hand presses mine, now she opens her eyes and is looking      Into my own eyes. No--don't. Let my thoughts rest on your form!    Please close your eyes. They're inebriation, confusion, they rob me      All too soon of the joy quiet reflection affords.    Grand are the forms of this body and nobly positioned each member.      Had Ariadne lain thus, Theseus never had fled.    Only a single kiss for these lips and then, O Theseus, leave her;      Look at her eyes--she's awake! Now you're eternally bound.     XVI    Boy, won't you light me a lamp. \"But dear master, there's light in the sky yet.      Don't waste your oil and the wick. Don't close the shutters so soon.    Only the houses are blocking the sun there, it's not yet the mountains.      Until the curfew shall ring, full half an hour must pass.\"    Wretched young fellow, be gone and obey me! My loved one is coming.      Lamplight, console me till then, harbinger warm of the night.     XVII    Poets of old in chorus cried out against those two serpents,      Making them horrible names, hated in all of the world:    Python the one, the other the Hydra of Lerna. These monsters      Both have now been destroyed, thanks to the deeds of the gods.    Fire-breathing, venomous once, they no longer now depredate our      Flocks and meadows and woods, fields of golden grain.    How is it then that some spiteful god in his wrath has      Raised from the poisonous slime offspring so monstrous again?    There's an insidious viper creeps into the loveliest gardens,      Lying in wait to attack all who seek pleasure therein.    Noble Hesperian dragon, I call you courageous and forthright.      Boldly defending your own beautiful apples of gold.    As for this worm, why he is not guarding at all, for his presence      Sullies both garden and fruit, till they deserve no defense.    Secretly coiled beneath bushes, where he befouls the sweet wellsprings,      Turning to poisonous drool Cupid's lifegiving dew.    Happy Lucretius knew how in his day to forego love completely,      Fearing not to enjoy pleasure in anyone's arms.    Fortunate Ancient, Propertius, for you a slave fetched the girls down      From the Aventine Hill, from Tarpeia's grove.    Cynthia then, when driving you out of such unchaste embraces,      Found you unfaithful, it's true, but she did find you whole.    Who would today dare attempt to escape from fidelity's ennui?      Love does not hold one back--only concern for one's health.    Even the woman we love may afford us uncertain enjoyment;      Nowhere can feminine lap safely encouch a man's head.    Matrimonial bed's insecure and so's fornication;      Husband, lover and wife pass to each other the hurt.    Think of those ages of gold when Jupiter followed his urges,      Chose Callisto one day, turned to Semel the next.    It was important to him to find thresholds of temples so sacred      Pure when, enamoured, he sought powerful entry to them.    Can you imagine the ragings of Juno if in love's skirmish      Poisonous weapons on her by her own spouse had been turned?    But we neo-pagans may not after all be abandoned entirely:      Yet there is speeding a god mercifully over the earth,    Quick and assiduous. Everyone knows him and ought to adore him,      Herald of Zeus: Hermes, the healing god.    Although his father's temple be fallen, and though of its pillars      Scarcely a pair yet records ancient glory adored,    Nevertheless the son's place of worship still stands, and forever      Will there the ardent requests alternate with the thanks.    Only one favor I beg of you, Graces (I ask it in secret--      Fervent my prayer and deep, out of a passionate breast):    My little garden, my sweet one, protect it and do not let any      Evil come near it nor me. Cupid will hold out his hand:    O, and entrusting myself to the rascal, I beg you please may I      Do so in pleasure with no danger or worry or fear.     XVIII    I cannot think I'd have gone with Julius Caesar to Britain;      To the Popina right here, Florus would tug me with ease.    Fogs of the dreary north remain a more baleful remembrance      Than in the kitchens of Rome tribes of assiduous fleas.    After today, I'll remember you even more kindly, tavernas,      You osterias, as you are called, aptly by those here in Rome.    That was the place I encountered my mistress today with the uncle      Whom she so often deceives, so that she can have me.    Here's where I sat at a table surrounded by good-natured Germans;      Over on that side the girl, finding a seat for herself    Next to her mother where, frequently shifting her bench, she arranged      Nicely for me to perceive profile and curve of her neck;    Speaks just a little more loudly than women in Rome are accustomed;      Significant glance as she pours--misses the glass with the wine    So that it spills on the table, and she with a delicate finger      Over its surface can draw circles in damp arabesque:    Her name entwining in mine, while my eyes most eagerly follow      All that her fingertip writes. She is of course well aware    That I am watching, so finally makes the V of the Roman      Five, with a virgule before. Quickly, as soon as I've seen,    She interlaces the circles, reducing them all to ornatest      Patterns--but still the sweet IV stood as engraved in my eye.    I sat there mutely and biting my passionate lips almost bloody      Half from delight at the ruse, partly from stifled desire:    Such a long time until dark, then another four hours of waiting.      --Sun, who tarries on high, contemplating Rome:    Greater never you've nor shall you in future see greater      Than Rome, O sun, as your priest, Horace, enraptured foretold.    Tarry no longer today. Go seek other realms beneath heaven.      Sooner depart and leave Rome's seven famed hills to me.    Please do the poet a favor and shorten the glorious hours      Which the painter devours, eagerly filling his eyes.    Cast now but one ardent glance, while descending, on noble façades and      Cupolas, pillars, and--last--up at the obelisks. Then    Hastily plunge to the ocean. Come view all the sooner tomorrow      That which, for centuries now, gods have let you enjoy:    Italy's shoreline so long overgrown with moist reeds, elevations      Somberly rising to shades cast by the bushes and trees.    First were but few simple dwellings here, suddenly sunlight discovered      Nations enlivening hills teeming with fortunate thieves.    Onto this spot they assembled such plunder, in your eye so splendid      All earth's remaining orb scarcely was worthy of note.    You watched a world being born here, watched the same world sink to ruin,      And from those ruins yet arise world again greater, perhaps.    O may I long by your light now behold this Rome. May the Parcæ      Spin the fine thread of my life slowly, taking great care.    O but come rushing the moment my love designated so sweetly.      Wonderful! Sound already the chimes? --No, but I heard at least three.    Thus, my dear muses, again you've beguiled the monotony for me.      Of this long interval while I was apart from my love.    All of you now, farewell! I'll be going now--don't be offended.      For, though you're proud, you'll concede: Cupid in my heart comes first.     XIX    Why did you fail to appear at the cot in the vineyard today, Love?      As I had promised I would, long I awaited you there.    \"Dear, I had almost arrived when I saw, by good fortune, your uncle      Standing right there by the vines, looking now this way, now that.    Stealthily I slipped away.\" --Alas, what a misapprehension!      You saw the scarecrow, that's all. Nothing else drove you away.    Reeds and some discarded garments all hastily cobbled together--      I helped to make it myself: diligent in my own grief.    \"Well, now his wish is fulfilled. The old gardner's most dissolute crow has      Left on this day unscathed nice little garden and niece.\"     XX    While there is many an unpleasant sound, I hate to hear barking      Worse than anything else. Bellowing dogs split my ears.    Nevertheless I do like to hear, and take pleasure in listening      To the loud howl of the dog raised from a pup next door.    That is the dog that so bayed one time at my girl that he almost      Gave our secret away (when she was visiting me).    Now, when I hear the dog barking I think my beloved is coming--      Or I remember the time, when long awaited she came.     XXI    I can tell not only about a discomfort far greater than others,      But of a horror besides, thinking of which will arouse    Every fiber in me to revulsion. My friends, I confess it:      Great displeasure I take lying alone in my bed.    But it's a horror to fear on the pathways of love you'll discover      Snakes and their venom beneath roses of eager desire--    That at the moment supreme, when I'm yielding to pleasure so fully,      Right at my head as it droops, hissing disease may approach.    That's why Faustina as my companion in bed makes me happy:      Loving she always remains faithful, as I am to her.    Young men are aroused in their passions by obstacles and by excitement;      I prefer to go slow, savoring pleasures secure.    Is it not bliss to exchange tender kisses containing no dangers,      Sucking into our lungs, carefree, our partner's own life?    That is the way our long nights of enjoyment are passed. We listen,      Breast against breast, to the storm, pouring down rain in the wind    Morning begins to dawn, we expect from these hours approaching      Blossoms "]]]
