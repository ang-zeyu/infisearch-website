But Mallet's acuteness readily perceived, that in much Edward's mind had been alienated from William.  It was clear, that the Duke's marriage and the pledges that had crowned the union were distasteful to the asceticism of the saint king: and with Godwin's death, and Tostig's absence from the court, seemed to have expired all Edward's bitterness towards that powerful family of which Harold was now the head.  Still, as no subject out of the House of Cerdic had ever yet been elected to the Saxon throne, there was no apprehension on Mallet's mind that in Harold was the true rival to William's cherished aspirations.  Though Edward the Atheling was dead, his son Edgar lived, the natural heir to the throne; and the Norman, (whose liege had succeeded to the Duchy at the age of eight,) was not sufficiently cognisant of the invariable custom of the Anglo-Saxons, to set aside, whether for kingdoms or for earldoms, all claimants unfitted for rule by their tender years.  He could indeed perceive that the young Atheling's minority was in favour of his Norman liege, and would render him but a weak defender of the realm, and that there seemed no popular attachment to the infant orphan of the Germanised exile: his name was never mentioned at the court, nor had Edward acknowledged him as heir,--a circumstance which he interpreted auspiciously for William.  Nevertheless, it was clear that, both at court and amongst the people, the Norman influence in England was at the lowest ebb; and that the only man who could restore it, and realise the cherished dreams of his grasping lord, was Harold the all-powerful.     CHAPTER III.   Trusting, for the time, to the success of Edward's urgent demand for the release of his kinsmen, as well as his own, Harold was now detained at the court by all those arrears of business which had accumulated fast under the inert hands of the monk-king during the prolonged campaigns against the Welch; but he had leisure at least for frequent visits to the old Roman house; and those visits were not more grateful to his love than to the harder and more engrossing passion which divided his heart.  The nearer he grew to the dazzling object, to the possession of which Fate seemed to have shaped all circumstances, the more he felt the charm of those mystic influences which his colder reason had disdained.  He who is ambitious of things afar, and uncertain, passes at once into the Poet-Land of Imagination; to aspire and to imagine are yearnings twin-born.  When in his fresh youth and his calm lofty manhood, Harold saw action, how adventurous soever, limited to the barriers of noble duty; when he lived but for his country, all spread clear before his vision in the sunlight of day; but as the barriers receded, while the horizon extended, his eye left the Certain to rest on the Vague.  As self, though still half concealed from his conscience, gradually assumed the wide space love of country had filled, the maze of delusion commenced: he was to shape fate out of circumstance,--no longer defy fate through virtue; and thus Hilda became to him as a voice that answered the questions of his own restless heart.  He needed encouragement from the Unknown to sanction his desires and confirm his ends.  But Edith, rejoicing in the fair fame of her betrothed, and content in the pure rapture of beholding him again, reposed in the divine credulity of the happy hour; she marked not, in Harold's visits, that, on entrance, the Earl's eye sought first the stern face of the Vala--she wondered not why those two conversed in whispers together, or stood so often at moonlight by the Runic grave.  Alone, of all womankind, she felt that Harold loved her, that that love had braved time, absence, change, and hope deferred; and she knew not that what love has most to dread in the wild heart of aspiring man, is not persons, but things,--is not things, but their symbols.  So weeks and months rolled on, and Duke William returned no answer to the demands for his hostages.  And Harold's heart smote him, that he neglected his brother's prayer and his mother's accusing tears.  Now Githa, since the death of her husband, had lived in seclusion and apart from town; and one day Harold was surprised by her unexpected arrival at the large timbered house in London, which had passed to his possession.  As she abruptly entered the room in which he sate, he sprang forward to welcome and embrace her; but she waved him back with a grave and mournful gesture, and sinking on one knee, she said thus:  \"See, the mother is a suppliant to the son for the son.  No, Harold, no--I will not rise till thou hast heard me.  For years, long and lonely, have I lingered and pined,--long years!  Will my boy know his mother again?  Thou hast said to me, 'Wait till the messenger returns.'  I have waited.  Thou hast said, 'This time the Count cannot resist the demand of the King.'  I bowed my head and submitted to thee as I had done to Godwin my lord.  And I have not till now claimed thy promise; for I allowed thy country, thy King, and thy fame to have claims more strong than a mother.  Now I tarry no more; now no more will I be amused and deceived.  Thine hours are thine own--free thy coming and thy going.  Harold, I claim thine oath.  Harold, I touch thy right hand.  Harold, I remind thee of thy troth and thy plight, to cross the seas thyself, and restore the child to the mother.\"  \"Oh, rise, rise!\" exclaimed Harold, deeply moved.  \"Patient hast thou been, O my mother, and now I will linger no more, nor hearken to other voice than your own.  I will see the King this day, and ask his leave to cross the sea to Duke William.\"  Then Githa rose, and fell on the Earl's breast weeping.     CHAPTER IV.   It so chanced, while this interview took place between Githa and the Earl, that Gurth, hawking in the woodlands round Hilda's house, turned aside to visit his Danish kinswoman.  The prophetess was absent, but he was told that Edith was within; and Gurth, about to be united to a maiden who had long won his noble affections, cherished a brother's love for his brother's fair betrothed.  He entered the gynoecium, and there still, as when we were first made present in that chamber, sate the maids, employed on a work more brilliant to the eye, and more pleasing to the labour, than that which had then tasked their active hands.  They were broidering into a tissue of the purest gold the effigy of a fighting warrior, designed by Hilda for the banner of Earl Harold: and, removed from the awe of their mistress, as they worked their tongues sang gaily, and it was in the midst of song and laughter that the fair young Saxon lord entered the chamber.  The babble and the mirth ceased at his entrance; each voice was stilled, each eye cast down demurely.  Edith was not amongst them, and in answer to his inquiry the eldest of the maidens pointed towards the peristyle without the house.  The winning and kindly thegn paused a few moments, to admire the tissue and commend the work, and then sought the peristyle.  Near the water-spring that gushed free and bright through the Roman fountain, he found Edith, seated in an attitude of deep thought and gloomy dejection.  She started as he approached, and, springing forward to meet him, exclaimed:  \"O Gurth, Heaven hath sent thee to me, I know well, though I cannot explain to thee why, for I cannot explain it to myself; but know I do, by the mysterious bodements of my own soul, that some great danger is at this moment encircling thy brother Harold.  Go to him, I pray, I implore thee, forthwith; and let thy clear sense and warm heart be by his side.\"  \"I will go instantly,\" said Gurth, startled.  \"But do not suffer, I adjure thee, sweet kinswoman, the superstition that wraps this place, as a mist wraps a marsh, to infect thy pure spirit.  In my early youth I submitted to the influence of Hilda; I became man, and outgrew it. Much, secretly, has it grieved me of late, to see that our kinswoman's Danish lore has brought even the strong heart of Harold under his spell; and where once he only spoke of duty, I now hear him speak of fate.\"  \"Alas! alas!\" answered Edith, wringing her hands; \"when the bird hides its head in the brake, doth it shut out the track of the hound?  Can we baffle fate by refusing to heed its approaches?  But we waste precious moments.  Go, Gurth, dear Gurth!  Heavier and darker, while we speak, gathers the cloud on my heart.\"  Gurth said no more, but hastened to remount his steed; and Edith remained alone by the Roman fountain, motionless and sad, as if the nymph of the old religion stood there to see the lessening stream well away from the shattered stone, and know that the life of the nymph was measured by the ebb of the stream.  Gurth arrived in London just as Harold was taking a boat for the palace of Westminster, to seek the King; and, after interchanging a hurried embrace with his mother, he accompanied Harold to the palace, and learned his errand by the way.  While Harold spoke, he did not foresee any danger to be incurred by a friendly visit to the Norman court; and the interval that elapsed between Harold's communication and their entrance into the King's chamber, allowed no time for mature and careful reflection.  Edward, on whom years and infirmity had increased of late with rapid ravage, heard Harold's request with a grave and deep attention, which he seldom vouchsafed to earthly affairs.  And he remained long silent after his brother-in-law had finished;--so long silent, that the Earl, at first, deemed that he was absorbed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7679"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 08 (#2)"],["body"," one of those mystic and abstracted reveries, in which, more and more as he grew nearer to the borders of the World Unseen, Edward so strangely indulged.  But, looking more close, both he and Gurth were struck by the evident dismay on the King's face, while the collected light of Edward's cold eye showed that his mind was awake to the human world.  In truth, it is probable that Edward, at that moment, was recalling rash hints, if not promises, to his rapacious cousin of Normandy, made during his exile.  And, sensible of his own declining health, and the tender years of the young Edgar, he might be musing over the terrible pretender to the English throne, whose claims his earlier indiscretion might seem to sanction.  Whatever his thoughts, they were dark and sinister, as at length he said, slowly:  \"Is thine oath indeed given to thy mother, and doth she keep thee to it?\"  \"Both, O King,\" answered Harold, briefly.  \"Then I can gainsay thee not.  And thou, Harold, art a man of this living world; thou playest here the part of a centurion; thou sayst 'Come,' and men come--'Go,' and men move at thy will.  Therefore thou mayest well judge for thyself.  I gainsay thee not, nor interfere between man and his vow.  But think not,\" continued the King in a more solemn voice, and with increasing emotion, \"think not that I will charge my soul that I counselled or encouraged this errand.  Yea, I foresee that thy journey will lead but to great evil to England, and sore grief or dire loss to thee.\" [175]  \"How so, dear lord and King?\" said Harold, startled by Edward's unwonted earnestness, though deeming it but one of the visionary chimeras habitual to the saint.  \"How so?  William thy cousin hath ever borne the name of one fair to friend, though fierce to foe.  And foul indeed his dishonour, if he could meditate harm to a man trusting his faith, and sheltered by his own roof-tree.\"  \"Harold, Harold,\" said Edward, impatiently, \"I know William of old. Nor is he so simple of mind, that he will cede aught for thy pleasure, or even to my will, unless it bring some gain to himself [176].  I say no more.--Thou art cautioned, and I leave the rest to Heaven.\"  It is the misfortune of men little famous for worldly lore, that in those few occasions when, in that sagacity caused by their very freedom from the strife and passion of those around, they seem almost prophetically inspired,--it is their misfortune to lack the power of conveying to others their own convictions; they may divine, but they cannot reason: and Harold could detect nothing to deter his purpose, in a vague fear, based on no other argument than as vague a perception of the Duke's general character.  But Gurth, listening less to his reason than his devoted love for his brother, took alarm, and said, after a pause:  \"Thinkest thou, good my King, that the same danger were incurred if Gurth, instead of Harold, crossed the seas to demand the hostages?\"  \"No,\" said Edward, eagerly, \"and so would I counsel.  William would not have the same objects to gain in practising his worldly guile upon thee.  No; methinks that were the prudent course.\"  \"And the ignoble one for Harold,\" said the elder brother, almost indignantly.  \"Howbeit, I thank thee, gratefully, dear King, for thy affectionate heed and care.  And so the saints guard thee!\"  On leaving the King, a warm discussion between the brothers took place.  But Gurth's arguments were stronger than those of Harold, and the Earl was driven to rest his persistence on his own special pledge to Githa.  As soon, however, as they had gained their home, that plea was taken from him; for the moment Gurth related to his mother Edward's fears and cautions, she, ever mindful of Godwin's preference for the Earl, and his last commands to her, hastened to release Harold from his pledge; and to implore him at least to suffer Gurth to be his substitute to the Norman court.  \"Listen dispassionately,\" said Gurth; \"rely upon it that Edward has reasons for his fears, more rational than those he has given to us.  He knows William from his youth upward, and hath loved him too well to hint doubts of his good faith without just foundation.  Are there no reasons why danger from William should be special against thyself?  While the Normans abounded in the court, there were rumours that the Duke had some designs on England, which Edward's preference seemed to sanction: such designs now, in the altered state of England, were absurd--too frantic, for a prince of William's reputed wisdom to entertain.  Yet he may not unnaturally seek to regain the former Norman influence in these realms.  He knows that in you he receives the most powerful man in England; that your detention alone would convulse the country from one end of it to the other; and enable him, perhaps, to extort from Edward some measures dishonourable to us all.  But against me he can harbour no ill design --my detention would avail him nothing.  And, in truth, if Harold be safe in England, Gurth must be safe in Rouen?  Thy presence here at the head of our armies guarantees me from wrong.  But reverse the case, and with Gurth in England, is Harold safe in Rouen?  I, but a simple soldier, and homely lord, with slight influence over Edward, no command in the country, and little practised of speech in the stormy Witan,--I am just so great that William dare not harm me, but not so great that he should even wish to harm me.\"  \"He detains our kinsmen, why not thee!\" said Harold.  \"Because with our kinsmen he has at least the pretext that they were pledged as hostages: because I go simply as guest and envoy.  No, to me danger cannot come.  Be ruled, dear Harold.\"  \"Be ruled, O my son,\" cried Githa, clasping the Earl's knees, \"and do not let me dread in the depth of the night to see the shade of Godwin, and hear his voice say, 'Woman, where is Harold?'\"  It was impossible for the Earl's strong understanding to resist the arguments addressed to it; and, to say truth, he had been more disturbed that he liked to confess by Edward's sinister forewarnings. Yet, on the other hand, there were reasons against his acquiescence in Gurth's proposal.  The primary, and, to do him justice, the strongest, was in his native courage and his generous pride.  Should he for the first time in his life shrink from a peril in the discharge of his duty; a peril, too, so uncertain and vague?  Should he suffer Gurth to fulfil the pledge he himself had taken?  And granting even that Gurth were safe from whatever danger he individually might incur, did it become him to accept the proxy?  Would Gurth's voice, too, be as potent as his own in effecting the return of the hostages?  The next reasons that swayed him were those he could not avow.  In clearing his way to the English throne, it would be of no mean importance to secure the friendship of the Norman Duke, and the Norman acquiescence in his pretensions; it would be of infinite service to remove those prepossessions against his House, which were still rife with the Normans, who retained a bitter remembrance of their countrymen decimated [177], it was said, with the concurrence if not at the order of Godwin, when they accompanied the ill-fated Alfred to the English shore, and who were yet sore with their old expulsion from the English court at the return of his father and himself.  Though it could not enter into his head that William, possessing no party whatever in England, could himself aspire to the English crown, yet at Edward's death, there might be pretenders whom the Norman arms could find ready excuse to sanction.  There was the boy Atheling, on the one side, there was the valiant Norwegian King Hardrada on the other, who might revive the claims of his predecessor Magnus as heir to the rights of Canute.  So near and so formidable a neighbour as the Court of the Normans, every object of policy led him to propitiate; and Gurth, with his unbending hate of all that was Norman, was not, at least, the most politic envoy he could select for that end.  Add to this, that despite their present reconciliation, Harold could never long count upon amity with Tostig: and Tostig's connection with William, through their marriages into the House of Baldwin, was full of danger to a new throne, to which Tostig would probably be the most turbulent subject: the influence of this connection how desirable to counteract! [178]  Nor could Harold, who, as patriot and statesman, felt deeply the necessity of reform and regeneration in the decayed edifice of the English monarchy, willingly lose an occasion to witness all that William had done to raise so high in renown and civilisation, in martial fame and commercial prosperity, that petty duchy, which he had placed on a level with the kingdoms of the Teuton and the Frank. Lastly, the Normans were the special darlings of the Roman Church. William had obtained the dispensation to his own marriage with Matilda; and might not the Norman influence, duly conciliated, back the prayer which Harold trusted one day to address to the pontiff, and secure to him the hallowed blessing, without which ambition lost its charm, and even a throne its splendour?  All these considerations, therefore, urged the Earl to persist in his original purpose: but a warning voice in his heart, more powerful than all, sided with the prayer of Githa, and the arguments of Gurth.  In this state of irresolution, Gurth said seasonably:  \"Bethink thee, Harold, if menaced but with peril to thyself, thou wouldst have a brave man's right to resist us; but it was of 'great evil to England' that Edward spoke, and thy reflection must tell thee, that in this crisis of our country, danger to thee is evil to England --evil to England thou hast no right to incur.\"  \"Dear mother, and generous Gurth,\" said Harold, then joining the two in one embrace, \"ye have well nigh conquered.  Give me but two days to ponder well, and be assured that I will not decide from the rash promptings of an ill-considered"]]]
