By the time the talk was over, she hurried off with a radiant face, and Pickering with an expression only one remove from that of absolute gloom, retraced his steps to lay one of \"the lovely seats\" for the D'Albert concert, before Miss Rhys, for her acceptance.  Phronsie came slowly down the hall to meet Polly as usual; this day with one of her company white gowns on. Polly always knew when these were donned that something unusual was to be expected from the daily routine of the household.  \"Are you really and truly home, Polly?\" asked Phronsie, taking the music-roll to tuck it under her own arm.  \"Yes, Pet;\" Polly set a kiss on the red lips. \"And I am as hungry as a beaver, Phronsie.\"  \"So you must be,\" said Phronsie, with a little sigh, \"for you were so long in coming home. Well, do hurry now, Polly.\" This last as Polly was skipping over the stairs to her own room to freshen up a bit. Then Phronsie turned into the dining-room to be quite sure that the butler had made the belated luncheon as fine as Polly could desire it.  \"She didn't ask why I had on this gown,\" mused Phronsie, softly disposing again the flowers at Polly's plate, \"and it's funny, I think, for Polly always sees everything;\" and she began to look troubled at once.  [Illustration: PHRONSIE CAME SLOWLY DOWN THE HALL.]  \"This is just as splendid as it can be,\" cried Polly, coming in, and picking up one of the roses at her plate. \"Phronsie, you are just a dear to have everything so nice,\" and she fastened it at her belt. \"Why, dear me! You've a fine gown on! What is going to happen?\"  \"And you didn't see it,\" said Phronsie, a bit reproachfully, as she gently smoothed the front breadth of mull.  \"Forgive me, dear,\" begged Polly. \"Well, what is it, Pet? Do tell me; for I'm dying of curiosity, as the Salisbury girls say.\"  Phronsie stood up on tiptoe, and achieved Polly's ear.  \"Who do you think is coming to-night?\" she whispered impressively.  \"To-night? Oh, dear me! I can't possibly guess,\" said Polly, beginning to think that this one evening of all the year held supreme moments for her. \"Who is it, Phronsie? do tell me quickly.\"  \"Well,\" said Phronsie, drawing off to see the surprised delight sure to come on Polly's face, \"it's Jasper himself.\"  \"Not Jasper?\" exclaimed Polly, quite gone with joy. \"Oh, Phronsie Pepper, you can't mean that?\"  \"But I do,\" said Phronsie, forgetting her age, to hop up and down on the rug, \"we've a letter while you were at the school, and I wasn't to tell you suddenly, so I put on one of my nice gowns, so you would know.\"  \"But how could I possibly suppose that Jasper would come now,\" cried Polly, seizing Phronsie's hands to execute one of the old-time dances. \"Now I almost know he is going to stay over Christmas.\"  \"He is--he is!\" cried Phronsie in a little scream; \"you've guessed it, Polly. And Mamsie said--she's gone down town with Grandpapa; he's going to get tickets for the concert to-night, so that you can all go together, even if you can't sit together, and she said that\"--  \"Oh, Phronsie!\" exclaimed Polly in dismay and she stood quite still.  \"Aren't you glad?\" asked Phronsie, her joy suddenly hushed.  \"And I've done it myself--spoiled all this loveliness,\" cried Polly passionately, little white lines coming around her mouth, \"and Jasper here!\"  \"Oh, Polly, Polly!\" Phronsie clasped her gown imploringly, \"don't, Polly.\"  \"I just won't go to the school,\" declared Polly at white heat; \"I don't care for the concert, but I'll send a note over to say that I am detained at home.\"  \"What is it, Polly?\" begged Phronsie, all sorts of dreadful surmises seizing her, \"do tell me, Polly, won't you?\"  \"It's--nothing; you wouldn't understand, child,\" said Polly quickly. \"There, don't ask.\"  Phronsie crept away in a grieved fashion, to be presently folded into Polly's warm arms. \"I'm bad to-day, Phronsie dear. There, Pet, now you are all right, aren't you?\" as she hugged her close.  \"I am, if you are, Polly,\" said Phronsie doubtfully.  \"Well, I'm all right now,\" said Polly, her brow clearing; \"the bad has gone at last, I hope, to stay away, Phronsie. Now I must hurry and eat this nice luncheon you've fixed for me;\" and she sprang toward the table.  \"Don't you want to write a note first?\" asked Phronsie, wondering at Polly's strange mood, and following her to the table-edge, \"you said so.\"  \"No; I've given it up,\" said Polly, sitting down and beginning on her chop and toast. \"Bless you, dear, you've given me an orchid,\" glancing down between her mouthfuls to the bouquet at her plate; \"you should have saved them all for Jasper.\"  \"Turner said I might have it,\" said Phronsie triumphantly, \"and I knew you'd give it to Jasper, so it's all right.\"  \"It surely shall do double duty,\" said Polly merrily, with a tender glance for the orchid. \"Well, how's Baby?\"  \"He is very nice,\" said Phronsie, with a grown-up air, \"and didn't cry a bit for Mamsie. And now if you are really all right, Polly, I'll go up to the nursery and look at him.\"  \"So I would,\" said Polly approvingly. \"Yes, I'm all right; see, I'm on my chop No. 2.\"  Phronsie smiled with great satisfaction at this, and went off. At a quarter of seven, Polly, in a storm of remonstrance from all but one, hurried off to help poor Amy Loughead through her Slough of Despond.  Jasper alone, just arrived for dinner, was the only one who remained silent when the storm of disapproval broke forth over Polly and her doings. After the first astonished exclamation, he had absolutely refused to say anything save \"Polly knows best.\"  \"I don't know how to thank you,\" said Polly out in the wide hall, where he hurried to meet her, as she ran downstairs with her plainest walking things on, \"for I don't believe they would have let me go. I never saw Mamsie feel so, Jasper.\" And now Polly could not keep the tears back.  \"She'll see it all right to-morrow,\" said Jasper soothingly.  He put his hand out and grasped hers, as in the old days in the little brown house, and Polly answered through her tears, \"I know, Jasper.\"  And then the maid appearing, who was to accompany her to Miss Salisbury's, Polly came out from her tears, and said, \"I'm ready, Barbara.\"  \"You are not needed, Barbara,\" said Jasper, reaching up for his top-coat from the oaken rack.  \"What are you going to do?\" gasped Polly, her hand on the door-knob, and glancing back.  \"Walk over with you to that center of culture and wisdom,\" said Jasper coolly, close beside her now, his hat in his hand.  \"O, Jasper!\" exclaimed Polly in dismay, her face growing quite pale, \"don't; you'll be late for the concert. Barbara, Barbara!\" Polly looked past him to summon the departing maid.  \"Barbara is a good girl, and understands the duty of obedience,\" said Jasper laughingly. \"There's no help for it, Polly; you must accept my escort,\" and he opened the door.  \"But Grandpapa! he will be terribly disappointed not to have you go to the concert with him,\" cried Polly, getting down the steps with a dreadful weight at her heart.  \"I made it all right with father,\" said Jasper, \"as soon as I heard of your plan; and Mr. Alstyne is on his way over to take my place; at least he ought to be in response to my note. Don't worry, Polly; come.\"  \"Oh! what perfectly elegant seats,\" exclaimed Alexia Rhys, waving her big ostrich fan contentedly, and sweeping the audience with a long gaze. \"Everybody is here to-night, Pickering.\"  \"That's not so,\" said Pickering savagely, and bestowing a thump on his unoffending opera hat, already reduced to the smallest possible bulk.  \"Don't spoil it,\" advised Alexia coolly, with a sidelong gaze at his face. \"Well, of course I mean everybody except Polly; and I'm sure, Pickering, it isn't my fault that she didn't come; Polly always was queer about some things.\"  Pickering did not answer, but bestowed his glance on the programme in his hand.  \"And now she is queerer than ever,\" said Alexia, glad to think that the dainty blue affair on her head, she called a bonnet, was already doing its work, as she heard a lady in the seat back of them, question if it were not one of the newest of Madame Marchaud's creations. So she sat more erect, and played nonchalantly with her fan. \"Yes, and it's all because of those dreadfully horrid music lessons.\"  Pickering coughed, and rattled his programme ominously, which Alexia pretended not to hear.  \"Why Mr. King lets her do it, I can't see,\" she went on.  \"Do stop,\" said Pickering shortly, and casting a nervous glance back of her shoulder.  \"Never mind if they do hear,\" said Alexia sweetly, \"all the better; then they'll know we don't approve of her doing so, at any rate.\"  \"I do approve,\" said Pickering, his face flaming, \"if she wants to; and we've got to, any way, because we can't help ourselves. I do wish, Alexia, you wouldn't discuss our friends in this public way.\"  \"And I don't think it is a very sweet thing to invite a girl to a concert, and then get up a fight,\" said Alexia, back at him.  \"Goodness--who's fighting?\" exclaimed Pickering under his breath.  \"You are--I wish you could see your face; it's as black as a thunder cloud,\" said Alexia, with the consciousness that her own was as calm as a June morning. \"And I'm sure if you don't want to attract people to our conversation, you might at least look a little pleasanter.\"  Pickering threw two or three nervous glances on either side, to prove her words, and was by no means reassured to see the countenance of Billy Harlow, one of his young business friends, across the aisle, suffused with an attempt to appear as if he hadn't been a witness to the little by-play.  \"Well, I'm morally certain I won't trouble you with another invitation to a concert,\" he said, too furious to quite know his own words.  \"You needn't,\" said Alexia, swinging her fan with an even hand, and still smiling sweetly, this time including in it Billy, who had "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7498"],["title","Five Little Peppers Grown Up (#2)"],["body","girl with him. \"I really could endure life at home better than this bliss.\" And then D'Albert came on the stage, and it was the proper thing to keep quiet, so the hostilities died down.  Going out of the Opera House, Billy Harlow ran up to the two. \"Lovely time you've had,\" he said on Alexia's side, and with a little grimace.  \"Haven't I?\" said Alexia back again, with the air of a martyr. Pickering stalking along by her side, had the air of a man who didn't care what was being said about him.  \"Just look at him now,\" said Alexia softly, \"isn't he sweet? And fancy my bearing it for two hours. I don't think any other girl in our set, could.\"  \"Why didn't Miss Pepper come this evening?\" asked Mr. Harlow curiously; \"Pickering said he'd asked her.\"  \"Oh! she gave it up to help some girl,\" said Alexia carelessly. \"She's the music teacher at Miss Salisbury's school, you know.\"  \"Oh! is she?\" asked Mr. Harlow innocently, forgetting to mention the daily interviews he sustained with his sisters Kitty and Grace who were \"Salisbury girls,\" on Miss Pepper's movements.  \"And at the last minute he asked me to take her place,\" said Alexia with perfect frankness, \"and I was goose enough to do it.\"  \"Isn't Miss Pepper going to give a Recital pretty soon?\" asked Mr. Harlow, incidentally, as they worked their way along to the entrance.  \"Yes, she is,\" said Alexia sharply, \"at the Exeter--we can't stop her; she says she's proud to do it, and it shows the girls' wonderful ability; and all that sort of thing--and--and--oh dear me! after she's once done that, she'll always be 'Miss Pepper the music teacher.' Isn't it horrid!\"  \"I believe that is our carriage,\" said Pickering stiffly, and without so much as a half-glance at Billy. \"Come, Alexia.\"     CHAPTER II  GETTING READY FOR CHRISTMAS.   \"Baby ought to have a Christmas Tree,\" said Phronsie slowly.  \"Ah--King-Fisher, how is that? Do you want a Christmas Tree?\" Jasper dropped to all-fours by the side of the white bundle in the center of the library rug, as he propounded the momentous question.  The Baby plunged forward and buried both fat hands in the crop of brown hair so suddenly brought to his notice.  \"Is that the way to show your acknowledgment, sir?\" cried Jasper, springing to his feet, Baby and all. \"Well, there you go--there, and there, and there!\" tossing the white bundle high in the air.  \"Goodness! what a breeze you two contrive to raise,\" exclaimed Joel; \"Mamsie,\" as Mother Fisher put her head in the doorway, \"the little chap is getting the worst of it, I tell you.\"  \"Joel's jealous,\" said Jasper, with a laugh. \"Take care, King-Fisher, that really is my hair, sir.\"  Mrs. Fisher nodded and chuckled to the baby, and hurried off.  \"He didn't really mean to pull your hair, Jasper,\" said Phronsie in a worried way; and getting up from the floor where she had been deserted by the baby, she hurried over to the two flying around in the center of the room.  \"But he does pull dreadfully, though,\" said Polly, laughing, \"don't you, you little King!\" pinching Baby's toes as Jasper spun him past her.  \"My goodness!\" exclaimed Mr. King, coming in the opposite doorway, \"I should think it was a menagerie here! What's the matter, Phronsie?\"  \"Baby is pulling Jasper's hair,\" said Phronsie slowly, and revolving around the two dancers, \"but he really doesn't mean to, Grandpapa.\"  \"Oh! I hope he does,\" said old Mr. King cheerfully, coming in and sitting down in his favorite chair. \"I'm sure it speaks well for the young man's powers of self-defense, if he gives Jasper a good tweak.\"  \"Father!\" cried Jasper in pretended astonishment. \"Well, King-Fisher, as popular opinion is against me, I'll set you down again, and nurse my poor scalp,\" and down went the white bundle again to the floor, Phronsie going back to her post as nurse.  \"There's been a terrible scheme worked up since you were out, sir,\" announced Joel to the old gentleman.  \"Hey--what's that?\" demanded Mr. King, staring at Polly.  \"Oh! it isn't Polly this time,\" said Joel with a laugh. \"Generally it is Polly that sets all dreadful things going; but this time, it is some other ringleader.\"  \"Then I am sure I sha'n't approve if Polly isn't in it,\" declared the old gentleman flatly.  \"But I am in it, Grandpapa,\" Polly made haste to say. \"I think it is very, very nice.\"  \"That alters the case,\" said Mr. King. \"So what is it, Joe? Out with it.\"  \"It's nothing more nor less than to upset this house from top to bottom,\" said Joel, \"and get up a dreadful howling, tearing Christmas Tree.\"  [Illustration: \"BABY OUGHT TO HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE,\" SAID PHRONSIE SLOWLY.]  \"Oh, Joe Pepper!\" ejaculated Polly reproachfully, \"and you've always had such fun over our Christmas Trees. How can you!\"  \"It's for Baby,\" cried Phronsie, with a pink flush on her cheek. \"He's never seen one, you know, Grandpapa.\"  \"No, I should think not,\" said the old gentleman, looking down at the white bundle. \"Well, and so you want a Christmas Tree for him, Phronsie child?\"  \"I think we ought to have one,\" said Phronsie, \"because you know, he's never, never seen one. And we all have had so many beautiful Trees, Grandpapa.\"  \"To be sure, to be sure,\" said Mr. King. \"Well now, Phronsie child, come here and tell me all about it,\" and he held out his hand.  Phronsie cast an anxious glance at the bundle. \"Can I leave him, Grandpapa?\" she asked.  \"Leave him? Mercy, yes; it does babies good to be left alone. He'll suck his thumbs or his toes.\"  \"I'll stay with him,\" said Polly, running out of her corner to get on her knees before the baby. \"There now, sir, do you know what a blessed old care you are?\" smothering him with kisses.  \"Yes, I really think we ought to have a Christmas Tree,\" Phronsie was saying, \"Grandpapa dear,\" huddling up against his waistcoat as usual.  \"Then we surely will have one,\" declared old Mr. King, \"so that is settled. Do you hear, young people,\" raising his voice, \"or does that little scamp of a baby take all your ears?\"  \"We hear, Grandpapa,\" said Polly from the floor, \"and I'm very glad. It will be good fun to get up a Christmas Tree.\"  \"Seeing you never have had that pleasing employment,\" said Jasper _sotto voce_, on the rug before the fire.  \"Never mind; it'll be just as good fun again,\" said Polly.  \"And not a bit of work--oh, no!\"  \"Don't throw cold water on it,\" begged Polly under her breath, while the baby scrambled all over her, \"don't, Jasper; Phronsie has set her heart on it.\"  \"All right; but I thought you wanted every bit of time to get ready for your Recital, and the other things; and then, besides, there's Phronsie's performance down at Dunraven.\"  \"Well, so I did,\" confessed Polly, with a sigh, \"but I can get the time some way.\"  \"Out of 'the other things,'\" said Jasper grimly. \"Polly, you'll have no fun from the holidays. It isn't too late to stop this now.\" He darted over toward his father.  \"Jasper!\" cried Polly imploringly.  \"What is it, my boy?\" asked Mr. King, quite deep in the plans for the Tree, Joel having added himself to their company.  \"Oh, nothing; Polly wants it, and we must make it a good one,\" said Jasper, rather incoherently, and beginning to retreat.  \"Of course it will be a good one,\" said his father, a trifle testily, \"if we have it at all. When did we ever get up a poor Tree, pray tell?\"  Polly drew a relieved breath, and gathering the baby up in her arms, she hurried over to the old gentleman's chair with a \"Now when do you want to have the Tree, Phronsie?\"  \"Must we have it Christmas Day?\" asked Phronsie, looking at her anxiously.  \"Christmas Day? Dear me, no! Why, what would the Dunraven children do, Phronsie, if you took that day away from them?\" cried old Mr. King in astonishment.  Phronsie turned slowly back to him. \"I thought perhaps we ought to let Baby have the Tree Christmas Day,\" she said.  \"No, indeed,\" again said Mr. King. \"Come here, you little scamp,\" catching the baby out of Polly's hand, to set him on his other knee; \"there now, speak up like a man, and tell your sister that you are not particular about the time you have your Tree.\"  \"Ar--goo!\" said the Fisher baby.  \"That's it,\" said the old gentleman with approval, while the others shouted. \"So now, as long as your brother says so, Phronsie, why, I should have your Tree the day before Christmas.\"  \"Oh, Polly wants to go\"--began Jasper.  \"Ugh!\" cried Polly warningly to him. \"Yes, Phronsie; you much better have it the day before, as Grandpapa says.\"  \"And you don't suppose Baby will feel badly afterwards when he gets bigger, and cry because we didn't give him Christmas Day,\" said Phronsie, \"do you, Grandpapa?\"  \"Indeed, I don't,\" declared the old gentleman, pinching the set of pink toes nearest to his hand; \"if he does, why, we'll all let him know what we think of such conduct.\"  \"Then,\" said Phronsie, clasping her hands, \"I should very much rather not take Christmas Day from the Dunraven children, because you know, Grandpapa, they expect it.\"  \"Of course they do,\" said old Mr. King. \"Bless me! why, we shouldn't know it was Christmas at all, if we didn't go down to Bedford and carry it; and as for those children\"--  The picture that this brought up, of Dunraven without a Christmas, threw such a shadow over Phronsie's face, that Polly hastened to say reassuringly:  \"Oh, Grandpapa! we wouldn't ever think of not carrying a Christmas to Dunraven, would we, Pet?\" and she threw her arms around Phronsie.  \"Of course not,\" chimed in Jasper and Joel, in a way to bring back the smiles to the little downcast face.  And the baby crowed, and seized Phronsie's floating yellow hair with both hands, and they all got in one another's way to rescue it; and Mrs. Pepper hurried in again, this time for Baby; and he was kissed all around, Phronsie giving him two for fear he might think she was hurt; and one of the maids popped in with \"There is a gentleman in the reception room to see Miss Mary.\"  Jasper turned off with an impatient gesture.  \"I do suppose it is Mr."]]]
