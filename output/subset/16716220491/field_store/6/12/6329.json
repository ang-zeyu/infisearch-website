Verily, past times were present to me, and I deemed that I was to make a funeral prayer, as many a time heretofore, from the head of this staircase.  “Of a truth, I saw the shades of many that are gone.  Yea, I have prayed at their burials, one after another, and the ‘Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet’ hath seen them to their graves!”  Being now more thoroughly awake to their present purpose, he took his staff, and struck forcibly on the floor, till there came an echo from each deserted chamber, but no menial, to answer their summons.  They therefore walked along the passage, and again paused, opposite to the great front window, through which was seen the crowd, in the shadow and partial moonlight of the street beneath.  On their right hand was the open door of a chamber, and a closed one on their left.  The clergyman pointed his cane to the carved oak panel of the latter.  “Within that chamber,” observed he, “a whole lifetime since, did I sit by the death-bed of a goodly young man, who, being now at the last gasp--”  Apparently, there was some powerful excitement in the ideas which had now flashed across his mind.  He snatched the torch from his companion’s hand, and threw open the door with such sudden violence, that the flame was extinguished, leaving them no other light than the moonbeams, which fell through two windows into the spacious chamber. It was sufficient to discover all that could be known.  In a high-backed oaken arm-chair, upright, with her hands clasped across her breast, and her head thrown back, sat the  “Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.”  The stately dame had fallen on her knees, with her forehead on the holy knees of the Old Maid, one hand upon the floor, and the other pressed convulsively against her heart.  It clutched a lock of hair, once sable, now discolored with a greenish mould.  As the priest and layman advanced into the chamber, the Old Maid’s features assumed such a resemblance of shifting expression, that they trusted to hear the whole mystery explained, by a single word.  But it was only the shadow of a tattered curtain, waving betwixt the dead face and the moonlight.  “Both dead!” said the venerable man.  “Then who shall divulge the secret?  Methinks it glimmers to and fro in my mind, like the light and shadow across the Old Maid’s face.  And now’t is gone!”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9215"],["title","Chippings with a Chisel (From \"Twice Told Tales\") (#1)"],["body","the bridal dewdrops fresh around her memory.  My observations gave me the idea, and Mr. Wigglesworth confirmed it, that husbands were more faithful in setting up memorials to their dead wives than widows to their dead husbands.  I was not ill-natured enough to fancy that women, less than men, feel so sure of their own constancy as to be willing to give a pledge of it in marble.  It is more probably the fact, that while men are able to reflect upon their lost companions as remembrances apart from themselves, women, on the other hand, are conscious that a portion of their being has gone with the departed whithersoever he has gone.  Soul clings to soul; the living dust has a sympathy with the dust of the grave; and, by the very strength of that sympathy, the wife of the dead shrinks the more sensitively from reminding the world of its existence.  The link is already strong enough; it needs no visible symbol.  And, though a shadow walks ever by her side, and the touch of a chill hand is on her bosom, yet life, and perchance its natural yearnings, may still be warm within her, and inspire her with new hopes of happiness.  Then would she mark out the grave, the scent of which would be perceptible on the pillow of the second bridal?  No--but rather level its green mound with the surrounding earth, as if, when she dug up again her buried heart, the spot had ceased to be a grave. Yet, in spite of these sentimentalities, I was prodigiously amused by an incident, of which I had not the good fortune to be a witness, but which Mr. Wigglesworth related with considerable humor.  A gentlewoman of the town, receiving news of her husband’s loss at sea, had bespoken a handsome slab of marble, and came daily to watch the progress of my friend’s chisel.  One afternoon, when the good lady and the sculptor were in the very midst of the epitaph, which the departed spirit might have been greatly comforted to read, who should walk into the workshop but the deceased himself, in substance as well as spirit!  He had been picked up at sea, and stood in no present need of tombstone or epitaph.  “And how,” inquired I, “did his wife bear the shock of joyful surprise?”  “Why,” said the old man, deepening the grin of a death’s-head, on which his chisel was just then employed,  “I really felt for the poor woman; it was one of my best pieces of marble,--and to be thrown away on a living man!”  A comely woman, with a pretty rosebud of a daughter, came to select a gravestone for a twin-daughter, who had died a month before.  I was impressed with the different nature of their feelings for the dead; the mother was calm and wofully resigned, fully conscious of her loss, as of a treasure which she had not always possessed, and, therefore, had been aware that it might be taken from her; but the daughter evidently had no real knowledge of what death’s doings were.  Her thoughts knew, but not her heart.  It seemed to me, that by the print and pressure which the dead sister had left upon the survivor’s spirit, her feelings were almost the same as if she still stood side by side, and arm in arm, with the departed, looking at the slabs of marble; and once or twice she glanced around with a sunny smile, which, as its sister smile had faded forever, soon grew confusedly overshadowed.  Perchance her consciousness was truer than her reflection,--perchance her dead sister was a closer companion than in life.  The mother and daughter talked a long while with Mr. Wigglesworth about a suitable epitaph, and finally chose an ordinary verse of ill-matched rhymes, which had already been inscribed upon innumerable tombstones.  But, when we ridicule the triteness of monumental verses, we forget that Sorrow reads far deeper in them than we can, and finds a profound and individual purport in what seems so vague and inexpressive, unless interpreted by her.  She makes the epitaph anew, though the self-same words may have served for a thousand graves.  “And yet,” said I afterwards to Mr. Wigglesworth, “they might have made a better choice than this.  While you were discussing the subject, I was struck by at least a dozen simple and natural expressions from the lips of both mother and daughter.  One of these would have formed an inscription equally original and appropriate.”  “No, no,” replied the sculptor, shaking his head, “there is a good deal of comfort to be gathered from these little old scraps of poetry; and so I always recommend them in preference to any new-fangled ones.  And somehow, they seem to stretch to suit a great grief, and shrink to fit a small one.”  It was not seldom that ludicrous images were excited by what took place between Mr. Wigglesworth and his customers.  A shrewd gentlewoman, who kept a tavern in the town, was anxious to obtain two or three gravestones for the deceased members of her family, and to pay for these solemn commodities by taking the sculptor to board. Hereupon a fantasy arose in my mind, of good Mr. Wigglesworth sitting down to dinner at a broad, flat tombstone, carving one of his own plump little marble cherubs, gnawing a pair of cross-bones, and drinking out of a hollow death’s-head, or perhaps a lachrymatory vase, or sepulchral urn; while his hostess’s dead children waited on him at the ghastly banquet.  On communicating this nonsensical picture to the old man, he laughed heartily, and pronounced my humor to be of the right sort.  “I have lived at such a table all my days,” said he, “and eaten no small quantity of slate and marble.”  “Hard fare!” rejoined I, smiling; “but you seemed to have found it excellent of digestion, too.”  A man of fifty, or thereabouts, with a harsh, unpleasant countenance, ordered a stone for the grave of his bitter enemy with whom he had waged warfare half a lifetime, to their mutual misery and ruin.  The secret of this phenomenon was, that hatred had become the sustenance and enjoyment of the poor wretch’s soul; it had supplied the place of all kindly affections; it had been really a bond of sympathy between himself and the man who shared the passion; and when its object died, the unappeasable foe was the only mourner for the dead.  He expressed a purpose of being buried side by side with his enemy.  “I doubt whether their dust will mingle,” remarked the old sculptor to me; for often there was an earthliness in his conceptions.  “O yes,” replied I, who had mused long upon the incident; “and when they rise again, these bitter foes may find themselves dear friends. Methinks what they mistook for hatred was but love under a mask.”  A gentleman of antiquarian propensities provided a memorial for an Indian of Chabbiquidick, one of the few of untainted blood remaining in that region, and said to be an hereditary chieftain, descended from the sachem who welcomed Governor Mayhew to the Vineyard.  Mr. Wigglesworth exerted his best skill to carve a broken bow and scattered sheaf of arrows, in memory of the hunters and warriors whose race was ended here; but he likewise sculptured a cherub, to denote that the poor Indian had shared the Christian’s hope of immortality.  “Why,” observed I, taking a perverse view of the winged boy and the bow and arrows, “it looks more like Cupid’s tomb than an Indian chief’s!”  “You talk nonsense,” said the sculptor, with the offended pride of art; he then added, with his usual good-nature,  “How can Cupid die when there are such pretty maidens in the Vineyard?”  “Very true,” answered I; and for the rest of the day I thought of other matters than tombstones.  At our next meeting I found him chiselling an open book upon a marble headstone, and concluded that it was meant to express the erudition of some black-letter clergyman of the Cotton Mather school.  It turned out, however, to be emblematical of the scriptural knowledge of an old woman who had never read anything but her Bible; and the monument was a tribute to her piety and good works, from the Orthodox church, of which she had been a member.  In strange contrast with this Christian woman’s memorial, was that of an infidel, whose gravestone, by his own direction, bore an avowal of his belief that the spirt within him would be extinguished like a flame, and that the nothingness whence he sprang would receive him again.  Mr. Wigglesworth consulted me as to the propriety of enabling a dead man’s dust to utter this dreadful creed.  “If I thought,” said he, “that a single mortal would read the inscription without a shudder, my chisel should never cut a letter of it.  But when the grave speaks such falsehoods, the soul of man will know the truth by its own horror.”  “So it will,” said I, struck by the idea; “the poor infidel may strive to preach blasphemies from his grave; but it will be only another method of impressing the soul with a consciousness of immortality.”  There was an old man by the name of Norton, noted throughout the island for his great wealth, which he had accumulated by the exercise of strong and shrewd faculties, combined with a most penurious disposition.  This wretched miser, conscious that he had not a friend to be mindful of him in his grave, had himself taken the needful precautions for posthumous remembrance, by bespeaking an immense slab of white marble, with a long epitaph in raised letters, the whole to be as magnificent as Mr. Wigglesworth’s skill could make it.  There was something very characteristic in this contrivance to have his money’s worth even from his own tombstone, which, indeed, afforded him more enjoyment in the few months that he lived thereafter, than it probably will in a whole century, now that it is laid over his bones. This incident reminds me of a young girl, a pale, slender, feeble creature, most unlike the other rosy and healthful damsels of the Vineyard, amid whose brightness she was fading away.  Day after day did the poor maiden come to the sculptor’s shop, and pass from one piece of marble to another, till at last she pencilled her name upon a slender slab, which, I think,"]]]
