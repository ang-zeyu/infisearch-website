I clap my hands in triumph, and see!  my shadow clapping its unreal hands, and claiming the triumph for itself.  What a simpleton must I have been all day,--since my own shadow makes a mock of my fooleries!  Homeward! homeward!  It is time to hasten home.  It is time; it is time; for as the sun sinks over the western wave, the sea grows melancholy, and the surf has a saddened tone.  The distant sails appear astray, and not of earth, in their remoteness amid the desolate waste.  My spirit wanders forth afar, but finds no resting-place, and comes shivering back.  It is time that I were hence.  But grudge me not the day that has been spent in seclusion, which yet was not solitude, since the great sea has been my companion, and the little sea-birds my friends, and the wind has told me his secrets, and airy shapes have flitted around me in my hermitage.  Such companionship works an effect upon a man's character, as if he had been admitted to the society of creatures that are not mortal.  And when, at noontide, I tread the crowded streets, the influence of this day will still be felt; so that I shall walk among men kindly and as a brother, with affection and sympathy, but yet shall not melt into the indistinguishable mass of humankind.  I shall think my own thoughts, and feel my own emotions, and possess my individuality unviolated.  But it is good, at the eve of such a day, to feel and know that there are men and women in the world.  That feeling and that knowledge are mine, at this moment; for, on the shore, far below me, the fishing-party have landed from their skiff, and are cooking their scaly prey by a fire of drift-wood, kindled in the angle of two rude rocks.  The three visionary girls are likewise there.  In the deepening twilight, while the surf is dashed near their hearth, the ruddy gleam of the fire throws a strange air of comfort over the wild cove, bestrewn as it is with pebbles and sea-weed, and exposed to the \"melancholy main.\" Moreover, as the smoke climbs up the precipice, it brings with it a savory smell from a pan of fried fish, and a black kettle of chowder, and reminds me that my dinner was nothing but bread and water, and a tuft of samphire, and an apple.  Methinks the party night find room for another guest, at that flat rock which serves them for a table; and if spoons be scarce, I could pick up a clamshell on the beach. They see me now; and--the blessing of a hungry man upon him!--one of them sends up a hospitable shout,--halloo, Sir Solitary! come down and sup with us!  The ladies wave their handkerchiefs.  Can I decline? No; and be it owned, after all my solitary joys, that this is the sweetest moment of a Day by the Sea-shore."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9219"],["title","Edward Fane's Rosebud (From \"Twice Told Tales\") (#1)"],["body","that cold bed,  \"Rose! Rose! come put a blanket on my feet.\"  So now the Rosebud was the Widow Toothaker.  Her troubles had come early, and, tedious as they seemed, had passed before all her bloom was fled.  She was still fair enough to captivate a bachelor, or, with a widow's cheerful gravity, she might have won a widower, stealing into his heart in the very guise of his dead wife.  But the Widow Toothaker had no such projects.  By her watchings and continual cares, her heart had become knit to her first husband with a constancy which changed its very nature, and made her love him for his infirmities, and infirmity for his sake.  When the palsied old man was gone, even her early lover could not have supplied his place.  She had dwelt in a sick-chamber, and been the companion of a half-dead wretch, till she could scarcely breathe in a free air, and felt ill at ease with the healthy and the happy.  She missed the fragrance of the doctor's stuff.  She walked the chamber with a noiseless footfall.  If visitors came in, she spoke in soft and soothing accents, and was startled and shocked by their loud voices. Often in the lonesome evening, she looked timorously from the fireside to the bed, with almost a hope of recognizing a ghastly face upon the pillow.  Then went her thoughts sadly to her husband's grave.  If one impatient throb bad wronged him in his lifetime,--if she had secretly repined, because her buoyant youth was imprisoned with his torpid age,--if ever, while slumbering beside him, a treacherous dream had admitted another into her heart,--yet the sick man had been preparing a revenge, which the dead now claimed.  On his painful pillow, he had cast a spell around her; his groans and misery had proved more captivating charms than gayety and youthful grace; in his semblance, Disease itself had won the Rosebud for a bride; nor could his death dissolve the nuptials.  By that indissoluble bond she had gained a home in every sick-chamber, and nowhere else; there were her brethren and sisters; thither her husband summoned her, with that voice which had seemed to issue from the grave of Toothaker.  At length she recognized her destiny.  We have beheld her as the maid, the wife, the widow; now we see her in a separate and insulated character; she was, in all her attributes, Nurse Toothaker.  And Nurse Toothaker alone, with her own shrivelled lips, could make known her experience in that capacity.  What a history might she record of the great sicknesses, in which she has gone hand in hand with the exterminating angel!  She remembers when the small-pox hoisted a red banner on almost every house along the street.  She has witnessed when the typhus fever swept off a whole household, young and old, all but a lonely mother, who vainly shrieked to follow her last loved one.  Where would be Death's triumph, if none lived to weep?  She can speak of strange maladies that have broken out, as if spontaneously, but were found to have been imported from foreign lands, with rich silks and other merchandise, the costliest portion of the cargo.  And once, she recollects, the people died of what was considered a new pestilence, till the doctors traced it to the ancient grave of a young girl, who thus caused many deaths a hundred years after her own burial.  Strange that such black mischief should lurk in a maiden's grave!  She loves to tell how strong men fight with fiery fevers, utterly refusing to give up their breath; and how consumptive virgins fade out of the world, scarcely reluctant, as if their lovers were wooing them to a far country.  Tell us, thou fearful woman! tell us the death-secrets!  Fain would I search out the meaning of words, faintly gasped with intermingled sobs, and broken sentences, half audibly spoken between earth and the judgment-seat!  An awful woman!  She is the patron saint of young physicians, and the bosom friend of old ones.  In the mansions where she enters, the inmates provide themselves black garments; the coffin-maker follows her; and the bell tolls as she comes away from the threshold.  Death himself has met her at so many a bedside, that he puts forth his bony hand to greet Nurse Toothaker.  She is an awful woman!  And, O, is it conceivable, that this handmaid of human infirmity and affliction--so darkly stained, so thoroughly imbued with all that is saddest in the doom of mortals--can ever again be bright and gladsome, even though bathed in the sunshine of eternity?  By her long communion with woe, has she not forfeited her inheritance of immortal joy?  Does any germ of bliss survive within her?  Hark! an eager knocking at Nurse Toothaker's door.  She starts from her drowsy revery, sets aside the empty tumbler and teaspoon, and lights a lamp at the dim embers of the fire.  Rap, rap, rap! again; and she hurries a-down the staircase, wondering which of her friends can be at death's door now, since there is such an earnest messenger at Nurse Toothaker's.  Again the peal resounds, just as her hand is on the lock.   \"Be quick, Nurse Toothaker!\" cries a man on the doorstep; \"old General Fane is taken with the gout in his stomach, and has sent for you to watch by his death-bed.  Make haste, for there is no time to lose!\"  \"Fane! Edward Fane!  And has he sent for me at last?  I am ready!  I will get on my cloak and begone.  So,\" adds the sable-gowned, ashen-visaged, funereal old figure, \"Edward Fane remembers his Rosebud!\"  Our question is answered.  There is a germ of bliss within her. Her long-hoarded constancy--her memory of the bliss that was--remaining amid the gloom of her after life, like a sweet-smelling flower in a coffin, is a symbol that all maybe renewed.  In some happier clime, the Rosebud may revive again with all the dewdrops in its bosom."]]]
