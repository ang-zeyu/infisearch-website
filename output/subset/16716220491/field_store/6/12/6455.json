He's gone away for the day.\"  \"That'll pay me for my broken cane,\" said Halbert, adding, in a tone of satisfaction: \"I shall be glad to see him walking round the streets in rags. Perhaps he'll be a little more respectful then.\"  Meanwhile Robert decided not to mention to his mother his encounter with the young aristocrat. He knew that it would do no good, and would only make her feel troubled. He caught the malignant glance of Halbert on parting, and he knew him well enough to suspect that he would do what he could to have him turned out of the factory. This would certainly be a serious misfortune.  Probably the entire income upon which his mother and himself had to depend did not exceed eight dollars a week, and of this he himself earned six. They had not more than ten dollars laid by for contingencies, and if he were deprived of work, that would soon melt away. The factory furnished about the only avenue of employment open in Millville, and if he were discharged it would be hard to find any other remunerative labor.  At one o'clock Robert went back to the factory rather thoughtful. He thought it possible that he might hear something before evening of the dismission which probably awaited him, but the afternoon passed and he heard nothing.  On leaving the factory, he chanced to see Halbert again on the sidewalk a little distance in front and advancing toward him. This time, however, the young aristocrat did not desire a meeting, for, with a dark scowl, he crossed the street in time to avoid it.  \"Is he going to pass it over, I wonder?\" thought Robert. \"Well, I won't borrow trouble. If I am discharged I think I can manage to pick up a living somehow. I've got two strong arms, and if I don't find something to do, it won't be for the want of trying.\"  Two years before, Captain Rushton, on the eve of sailing upon what proved to be his last voyage, called in the evening at the house of Mr. Davis, the superintendent of the Millville factory. He found the superintendent alone, his wife and Halbert having gone out for the evening. He was seated at a table with a variety of papers spread out before him. These papers gave him considerable annoyance. He was preparing his semi-annual statement of account, and found himself indebted to the corporation in a sum three thousand dollars in excess of the funds at his command. He had been drawn into the whirlpool of speculation, and, through a New York broker, had invested considerable amounts in stocks, which had depreciated in value. In doing this he had made use, to some extent, of the funds of the corporation, which he was now at a loss how to replace. He was considering where he could apply for a temporary loan of three thousand dollars when the captain entered. Under the circumstances he was sorry for the intrusion.  \"Good-evening, Captain Rushton,\" he said, with a forced smile. \"Sit down. I am glad to see you.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Davis. It will be the last call I shall make upon you for a considerable time.\"  \"Indeed--how is that?\"  \"I sail to-morrow for Calcutta.\"  \"Indeed--that is a long voyage.\"  \"Yes, it takes considerable time. I don't like to leave my wife and boy for so long, but we sailors have to suffer a good many privations.\"  \"True; I hardly think I should enjoy such a life.\"  \"Still,\" said the captain, \"it has its compensations. I like the free, wild life of the sea. The ocean, even in its stormiest aspects, has a charm for me.\"  \"It hasn't much for me,\" said the superintendent, shrugging his shoulders. \"Seasickness takes away all the romance that poets have invested it with.\"  Captain Rushton laughed.  \"Seasickness!\" he repeated. \"Yes, that is truly a disagreeable malady. I remember once having a lady of rank as passenger on board my ship--a Lady Alice Graham. She was prostrated by seasickness, which is no respecter of persons, and a more forlorn, unhappy mortal I never expect to see. She would have been glad, I am convinced, to exchange places with her maid, who seemed to thrive upon the sea air.\"  \"I wish you a prosperous voyage, captain.\"  \"Thank you. If things go well, I expect to come home with quite an addition to my little savings. And that brings me to the object of my visit this evening. You must know, Mr. Davis, I have saved up in the last ten years a matter of five thousand dollars.\"  \"Five thousand dollars!\" repeated the superintendent, pricking up his ears.  \"Yes, it has been saved by economy and self-denial. Wouldn't my wife be surprised if she knew her husband were so rich?\"  \"Your wife doesn't know of it?\" asked the superintendent, surprised.  \"Not at all. I have told her I have something, and she may suppose I have a few hundred dollars, but I have never told her how much. I want to surprise her some day.\"  \"Just so.\"  \"Now, Mr. Davis, for the object of my errand. I am no financier, and know nothing of investments. I suppose you do. I want you to take this money, and take care of it, while I am gone on my present voyage. I meant to make inquiries myself for a suitable investment, but I have been summoned by my owners to leave at a day's notice, and have no time for it. Can you oblige me by taking care of the money?\"  \"Certainly, captain,\" said the superintendent, briskly. \"I shall have great pleasure in obliging an old friend.\"  \"I am much obliged to you.\"  \"Don't mention it. I have large sums of my own to invest, and it is no extra trouble to look after your money. Am I to pay the interest to your wife?\"  \"No. I have left a separate fund in a savings bank for her to draw upon. As I told you, I want to surprise her by and by. So not a word, if you please, about this deposit.\"  \"Your wishes shall be regarded,\" said the superintendent. \"Have you brought the money with you?\"  \"Yes,\" said the captain, drawing from his pocket a large wallet. \"I have got the whole amount here in large bills. Count it, if you please, and see that it is all right.\"  The superintendent took the roll of bills from the hands of his neighbor, and counted them over twice.  \"It is quite right,\" he said. \"Here are five thousand dollars. Now let me write you a receipt for them.\"  He drew before him a sheet of paper, and dipping his pen in the inkstand, wrote a receipt in the usual form, which he handed back to the captain, who received it and put it back in his wallet.  \"Now,\" said the captain, in a tone of satisfaction, \"my most important business is transacted. You will keep this money, investing it according to your best judgment. If anything should happen to me,\" he added, his voice faltering a little, \"you will pay it over to my wife and child.\"  \"Assuredly,\" said the superintendent; \"but don't let us think of such a sad contingency. I fully expect to pay it back into your own hands with handsome interest.\"  \"Let us hope so,\" said the captain, recovering his cheerfulness. \"Our destinies are in the hands of a kind Providence. And now good-by! I leave early to-morrow morning, and I must pass the rest of the evening with my own family.\"  \"Good-night, captain,\" said the superintendent, accompanying him to the door. \"I renew my wish that you have a prosperous and profitable voyage, and be restored in good time to your family and friends.\"  \"Amen!\" said the captain.  The superintendent went back to his study, his heart lightened of its anxiety.  \"Could anything be more fortunate?\" he ejaculated, \"This help comes to me just when it is most needed. Thanks to my special deposit, I can make my semi-annual settlement, and have two thousand dollars over. It's lucky the captain knows nothing of my Wall Street speculations. He might not have been quite so ready to leave his money in my hands. It's not a bad thing to be a banker,\" and he rubbed his hands together with hilarity.     CHAPTER IV.   THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE.  When the superintendent accepted Captain Rushton's money, he did not intend to act dishonestly. He hailed it as a present relief, though he supposed he should have to repay it some time. His accounts being found correct, he went on with his speculations. In these he met with varying success. But on the whole he found himself no richer, while he was kept in a constant fever of anxiety.  After some months, he met Mrs. Rushton in the street one day.  \"Have you heard from your husband, Mrs. Rushton?\" he inquired.  \"No, Mr. Davis, not yet. I am beginning to feel anxious.\"  \"How long has he been gone?\"  \"Between seven and eight months.\"  \"The voyage is a long one. There are many ways of accounting for his silence.\"  \"He would send by some passing ship. He has been to Calcutta before, but I have never had to wait so long for a letter.\"  The superintendent uttered some commonplace phrases of assurance, but in his own heart there sprang up a wicked hope that the _Norman_ would never reach port, and that he might never set eyes on Captain Rushton again. For in that case, he reflected, it would be perfectly safe for him to retain possession of the money with which he had been intrusted. The captain had assured him that neither his wife nor son knew aught of his savings. Who then could detect his crime? However, it was not yet certain that the _Norman_ was lost. He might yet have to repay the money.  Six months more passed, and still no tidings of the ship or its commander. Even the most sanguine now gave her up for lost, including the owners. The superintendent called upon them, ostensibly in behalf of Mrs. Rushton, and learned that they had but slender hopes of her safety. It was a wicked thing to rejoice over such a calamity, but his affairs were now so entangled that a sudden demand for the five thousand dollars would have ruined him.

At last, it began to snow.  It snowed for months and months and months.  [Illustration: THE CAVE-MAN.]  All the plants died. The animals fled in search of the southern sun. The valley became uninhabitable. Man hoisted his children upon his back, took the few pieces of stone which he had used as a weapon and went forth to find a new home.  Why the world should have grown cold at that particular moment, we do not know. We can not even guess at the cause.  The gradual lowering of the temperature, however, made a great difference to the human race.  For a time it looked as if every one would die. But in the end this period of suffering proved a real blessing. It killed all the weaker people and forced the survivors to sharpen their wits lest they perish, too.  Placed before the choice of hard thinking or quick dying the same brain that had first turned a stone into a hatchet now solved difficulties which had never faced the older generations.  In the first place, there was the question of clothing. It had grown much too cold to do without some sort of artificial covering. Bears and bisons and other animals who live in northern regions are protected against snow and ice by a heavy coat of fur. Man possessed no such coat. His skin was very delicate and he suffered greatly.  He solved his problem in a very simple fashion. He dug a hole and he covered it with branches and leaves and a little grass. A bear came by and fell into this artificial cave. Man waited until the creature was weak from lack of food and then killed him with many blows of a big stone. With a sharp piece of flint he cut the fur of the animal's back. Then he dried it in the sparse rays of the sun, put it around his own shoulders and enjoyed the same warmth that had formerly kept the bear happy and comfortable.  Then there was the housing problem. Many animals were in the habit of sleeping in a dark cave. Man followed their example and searched until he found an empty grotto. He shared it with bats and all sorts of creeping insects but this he did not mind. His new home kept him warm and that was enough.  Often, during a thunderstorm a tree had been hit by lightning. Sometimes the entire forest had been set on fire. Man had seen these forest-fires. When he had come too near he had been driven away by the heat. He now remembered that fire gave warmth.  Thus far, fire had been an enemy.  Now it became a friend.  A dead tree, dragged into a cave and lighted by means of smouldering branches from a burning forest filled the room with unusual but very pleasant heat.  Perhaps you will laugh. All these things seem so very simple. They are very simple to us because some one, ages and ages ago, was clever enough to think of them. But the first cave that was made comfortable by the fire of an old log attracted more attention than the first house that ever was lighted by electricity.  When at last, a specially brilliant fellow hit upon the idea of throwing raw meat into the hot ashes before eating it, he added something to the sum total of human knowledge which made the cave-man feel that the height of civilization had been reached.  Nowadays, when we hear of another marvelous invention we are very proud.  \"What more,\" we ask, \"can the human brain accomplish?\"  And we smile contentedly for we live in the most remarkable of all ages and no one has ever performed such miracles as our engineers and our chemists.  Forty thousand years ago when the world was on the point of freezing to death, an unkempt and unwashed cave-man, pulling the feathers out of a half-dead chicken with the help of his brown fingers and his big white teeth--throwing the feathers and the bones upon the same floor that served him and his family as a bed, felt just as happy and just as proud when he was taught how the hot cinders of a fire would change raw meat into a delicious meal.  \"What a wonderful age,\" he would exclaim and he would lie down amidst the decaying skeletons of the animals which had served him as his dinner and he would dream of his own perfection while bats, as large as small dogs, flew restlessly through the cave and while rats, as big as small cats, rummaged among the left overs.  Quite often the cave gave way to the pressure of the surrounding rock. Then man was hurled amidst the bones of his own victims.  Thousands of years later the anthropologist (ask your father what that means) comes along with his little spade and his wheelbarrow.  He digs and he digs and at last he uncovers this age-old tragedy and makes it possible for me to tell you all about it.    THE END OF THE STONE AGE  The struggle to keep alive during the cold period was terrible. Many races of men and animals, whose bones we have found, disappeared from the face of the earth.  Whole tribes and clans were wiped out by hunger and cold and want. First the children would die and then the parents. The old people were left to the mercy of the wild animals who hastened to occupy the undefended cave. Until another change in the climate or the slowly decreasing moisture of the air made life impossible for these wild invaders and forced them to find a retreat in the heart of the African jungle where they have lived ever since.  This part of my history is very difficult because the changes which I must describe were so very slow and so very gradual.  Nature is never in a hurry. She has all eternity in which to accomplish her task and she can afford to bring about the necessary changes with deliberate care.  Prehistoric man lived through at least four definite eras when the ice descended far down into the valleys and covered the greater part of the European continent.  The last one of these periods came to an end almost thirty thousand years ago.  From that moment on man left behind him concrete evidence of his existence in the form of tools and arms and pictures and in a general way we can say that history begins when the last cold period had become a thing of the past.  The endless struggle for life had taught the survivors many things.  Stone and wooden implements had become as common as steel tools are in our own days.  Gradually the rudely chipped flint axe had been replaced by one of polished flint which was infinitely more practical. It allowed man to attack many animals at whose mercy he had been since the beginning of time.  The mammoth was no longer seen.  The musk-ox had retreated to the polar circle.  The tiger had left Europe for good.  The cave-bear no longer ate little children.  The powerful brain of the weakest and most helpless of all living creatures--Man--had devised such terrible instruments of destruction that he was now the master of all the other animals.  The first great victory over Nature had been gained but many others were to follow.  Equipped with a full set of tools both for hunting and fishing, the cave-dweller looked for new living quarters.  The shores of rivers and lakes offered the best opportunity for a regular livelihood.  The old caves were deserted and the human race moved toward the water.  Now that man could handle heavy axes, the felling of trees no longer offered any great difficulties.  For countless ages birds had been constructing comfortable houses out of chips of wood and grass amidst the branches of trees.  Man followed their example.  He, too, built himself a nest and called it his \"home.\"  He did not, except in a few parts of Asia, take to the trees which were a bit too small and unsteady for his purpose.  He cut down a number of logs. These he drove firmly into the soft bottom of a shallow lake. On top of them he constructed a wooden platform and upon this platform he erected his first wooden house.  It offered many advantages over the old cave.  No wild animals could break into it and robbers could not enter it. The lake itself was an inexhaustible store-room containing an endless supply of fresh fish.  These houses built on piles were much healthier than the old caves and they gave the children a chance to grow up into strong men. The population increased steadily and man began to occupy vast tracts of wilderness which had been unoccupied since the beginning of time.  And all the time new inventions were made which made life more comfortable and less dangerous.  Often enough these innovations were not due to the cleverness of man's brain.  He simply copied the animals.  You know of course that there are a large number of beasties who prepare for the long winter by burying nuts and acorns and other food which is abundant during the summer. Just think of the squirrels who are for ever filling their larder in gardens and parks with supplies for the winter and the early spring.  Early man, less intelligent in many respects than the squirrels, had not known how to preserve anything for the future.  He ate until his hunger was stilled, but what he did not need right away he allowed to rot. As a result he often went without his meals during the cold period and many of his children died from hunger and want.  Until he followed the example of the animals and prepared for the future by laying in sufficient stores when the harvest had been good and there was an abundance of wheat and grain.  We do not know which genius first discovered the use of pottery but he deserves a statue.  Very likely it was a woman who had got tired of the eternal chores of the kitchen and wanted to make her household duties a little less exacting. She noticed that chunks of clay, when exposed to the rays of the sun, got baked into a hard substance.  If a flat piece of clay could be transformed into a brick, a slightly curved piece of the same material must produce a similar result.  And behold, the brick grew into a piece of pottery and the human race was able to save for the day of tomorrow.  If you think that my praises of this invention are exaggerated, look at the breakfast table and see what pottery, in one form and the other, means in your own life.  Your oatmeal is served in "]]]
