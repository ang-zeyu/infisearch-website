Marcolf fails, and the king condemns him to sit up all night in his company, threatening him with death in the morning, should he fall asleep. This, of course, Marcolf does immediately, and he snores aloud. Solomon asks, \"Sleepest thou?\"--And Marcolf replies, \"No, I think.\"--\"What thinkest thou?\"--\"That there are as many vertebrae in the hare's tail as in his backbone.\"--The king, assured that he has now entrapped his adversary, replies: \"If thou provest not this, thou diest in the morning!\" Over and over again Marcolf snores, and is awakened by Solomon, but he is always _thinking_. He gives various answers during the night: There are as many white feathers as black in the magpie.--There is nothing whiter than daylight, daylight is whiter than milk.--Nothing can be safely entrusted to a woman.--Nature is stronger than education.  Next day Marcolf proves all his statements. Thus, he places a pan of milk in a dark closet, and suddenly calls the king. Solomon steps into the milk, splashes himself, and nearly falls. \"Son of perdition! what does this mean?\" roars the monarch. \"May it please Your Majesty,\" says Marcolf, \"merely to show you that milk is not whiter than daylight.\" That nature is stronger than education, Marcolf proves by throwing three mice, one after the other, before a cat trained to hold a lighted candle in its paws during the king's supper; the cat drops the taper, and chases the mice. Marcolf further enters into a bitter abuse of womankind, and ends by inducing Solomon himself to join in the diatribe. When the king perceives the trick, he turns Marcolf out of court, and eventually orders him to be hanged. One favor is granted to him: he may select his own tree. Marcolf and his guards traverse the valley of Jehoshaphat, pass to Jericho over Jordan, through Arabia and the Red Sea, but \"never more could Marcolf find a tree that he would choose to hang on.\" By this device, Marcolf escapes from Solomon's hands, returns home, and passes the rest of his days in peace.  The legend, no doubt Oriental in origin, enjoyed popularity in the Middle Ages largely because it became the frame into which could be placed collections of proverbial lore. Hence, as happened also with the legend of the Queen of Sheba and her riddles, the versions vary considerably as to the actual content of the questions and answers bandied between Solomon and Marcolf. In the German and English versions, the proverbs and wisdom are largely Teutonic; in Zabara they are Oriental, and, in particular, Arabic. Again, Marcolf in the French version of Mauclerc is much more completely the reviler of woman. Mauclerc wrote almost contemporaneously with Zabara (about 1216-1220, according to Kemble). But, on the other hand, Mauclerc has no story, and his Marcolf is a punning clown rather than a cunning sage. Marcolf, who is Solomon's brother in a German version, has no trust in a woman even when dead. So, in another version, Marcolf is at once supernaturally cunning, and extremely skeptical as to the morality and constancy of woman. But it is unnecessary to enter into the problem more closely. Suffice it to have established that in Zabara's \"Book of Delight\" we have a hitherto unsuspected adaptation of the Solomon-Marcolf legend. Zabara handles the legend with rare originality, and even ventures to cast himself for the title r√¥le in place of the wisest of kings.  In the summary of the book which follows, the rhymed prose of the original Hebrew is reproduced only in one case. This form of poetry is unsuited to the English language. What may have a strikingly pleasing effect in Oriental speech, becomes, in English, indistinguishable from doggerel. I have not translated at full length, but I have endeavored to render Zabara accurately, without introducing thoughts foreign to him.  I have not thought it necessary to give elaborate parallels to Zabara's stories, nor to compare minutely the various details of the Marcolf legend with Zabara's poem. On the whole, it may be said that the parallel is general rather than specific. I am greatly mistaken, however, if the collection of stories that follows does not prove of considerable interest to those engaged in the tracking of fables to their native lairs. Here, in Zabara, we have an earlier instance than was previously known in Europe, of an intertwined series of fables and witticisms, partly Indian, partly Greek, partly Semitic, in origin, welded together by the Hebrew poet by means of a framework. The use of the framework by a writer in Europe in the year 1200 is itself noteworthy. And when it is remembered what the framework is, it becomes obvious that the \"Book of Delight\" occupies a unique position in medieval literature.   THE GIANT GUEST    Once on a night, I, Joseph, lay upon my bed; sleep was sweet upon me, my   one return for all my toil. Things there are which weary the soul and   rest the body, others that weary the body and rest the soul, but sleep   brings calm to the body and the soul at once.... While I slept, I dreamt;   and a gigantic but manlike figure appeared before me, rousing me from my   slumber. \"Arise, thou sleeper, rouse thyself and see the wine while it is   red; come, sit thee down and eat of what I provide.\" It was dawn when I   hastily rose, and I saw before me wine, bread, and viands; and in the   man's hand was a lighted lamp, which cast a glare into every corner. I   said, \"What are these, my master?\" \"My wine, my bread, my viands; come,   eat and drink with me, for I love thee as one of my mother's sons.\" And I   thanked him, but protested: \"I cannot eat or drink till I have prayed to   the Orderer of all my ways; for Moses, the choice of the prophets, and   the head of those called, hath ordained, 'Eat not with the blood';   therefore no son of Israel will eat until he prays for his soul, for the   blood is the soul....\"    Then said he, \"Pray, if such be thy wish\"; and I bathed my hands and   face, and prayed. Then I ate of all that was before me, for my soul loved   him.... Wine I would not drink, though he pressed me sore. \"Wine,\" I   said, \"blindeth the eyes, robbeth the old of wisdom and the body of   strength, it revealeth the secrets of friends, and raiseth dissension   between brothers.\" The man's anger was roused. \"Why blasphemest thou   against wine, and bearest false witness against it? Wine bringeth joy;   sorrow and sighing fly before it. It strengtheneth the body, maketh the   heart generous, prolongeth pleasure, and deferreth age; faces it maketh   shine, and the senses it maketh bright.\"    \"Agreed, but let thy servant take the water first, as the ancient   physicians advise; later I will take the wine, a little, without water.\"    When I had eaten and drunk with him, I asked for his name and his   purpose. \"I come,\" said he, \"from a distant land, from pleasant and   fruitful hills, my wisdom is as thine, my laws as thine, my name Enan   Hanatash, the son of Arnan ha-Desh.\" I was amazed at the name, unlike any   I had ever heard. \"Come with me from this land, and I will tell thee all   my secret lore; leave this spot, for they know not here thy worth and thy   wisdom. I will take thee to another place, pleasant as a garden, peopled   by loving men, wise above all others.\" But I answered: \"My lord, I cannot   go. Here are many wise and friendly; while I live, they bear me on the   wing of their love; when I die, they will make my death sweet.... I fear   thee for thy long limbs, and in thy face I see, clear-cut, the marks of   unworthiness; I fear thee, and I will not be thy companion, lest there   befall me what befell the leopard with the fox.\" And I told him the   story.  In this manner, illustrative tales are introduced throughout the poem. Zabara displays rare ingenuity in fitting the illustrations into his framework. He proceeds:   THE FOX AND THE LEOPARD    A leopard once lived in content and plenty; ever he found easy sustenance   for his wife and children. Hard by there dwelt his neighbor and friend,   the fox. The fox felt in his heart that his life was safe only so long as   the leopard could catch other prey, and he planned out a method for   ridding himself of this dangerous friendship. Before the evil cometh, say   the wise, counsel is good. \"Let me move him hence,\" thought the fox; \"I   will lead him to the paths of death; for the sages say, 'If one come to   slay thee, be beforehand with him, and slay him instead.'\" Next day the   fox went to the leopard, and told him of a spot he had seen, a spot of   gardens and lilies, where fawns and does disported themselves, and   everything was fair. The leopard went with him to behold this paradise,   and rejoiced with exceeding joy. \"Ah,\" thought the fox, \"many a smile   ends in a tear.\" But the leopard was charmed, and wished to move to this   delightful abode; \"but, first,\" said he, \"I will go to consult my wife,   my lifelong comrade, the bride of my youth.\" The fox was sadly   disconcerted. Full well he knew the wisdom and the craft of the leopard's   wife. \"Nay,\" said he, \"trust not thy wife. A woman's counsel is evil and   foolish, her heart hard like marble; she is a plague in a house. Yes, ask   her advice, and do the opposite.\".... The leopard told his wife that he   was resolved to go. \"Beware of the fox,\" she exclaimed; \"two small   animals there are, the craftiest they, by far--the serpent and the fox.   Hast thou not heard how the fox bound the lion and slew him with   cunning?\" \"How did the fox dare,\" asked the leopard, \"to come near enough   to the lion to do it?\"  The wife than takes up the parable, and cites the incident of   THE FOX AND THE LION    Then said the leopard's wife: The lion loved the fox, but the fox had no   faith in him, and plotted his death. One day the fox went to the lion   whining that a pain had seized him in the head. \"I have heard,\" said the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9887"],["title","Essays in War-Time: Further Studies in the Task of Social Hygiene (#1)"],["body","and turbulent when back again in their ships, they were all teaching and learning at once, and counted even shipwreck as good training. One would think, the Bishop remarks, that each oarsman was himself the arch-pirate.[1] These were the men who so largely went to the making of the \"Anglo-Saxon,\" and Sidonius might doubtless still utter the same comment could he observe their descendants in England to-day. Every Englishman believes in his heart, however modestly he may conceal the conviction, that he could himself organise as large an army as Kitchener and organise it better. But there is not only the instinct to order and to teach but also to learn and to obey. For every Englishman is the descendant of sailors, and even this island of Britain seemed to men of old like a great ship anchored in the sea. Nothing can overcome the impulse of the sailor to stand by his post at the moment of danger, and to play his sailorly part, whatever his individual convictions may be concerning the expedition to Rochelle or the expedition to the Dardanelles, or even concerning his right to play no part at all. That has ever been the Englishman's impulse in the hour of peril of his island Ship of State, as to-day we see illustrated in an almost miraculous degree. It is the saving grace of an obstinately independent and indisciplinable people.  Yet let us not forget that this same English temper is shown not only in warfare, not only in adventure in the physical world, but also in the greater, and--may we not say?--equally arduous tasks of peace. For to build up is even yet more difficult than to pull down, to create new life a still more difficult and complex task than to destroy it. Our English habits of restless adventure, of latent revolt subdued to the ends of law and order, of uncontrollable freedom and independence, are even more fruitful here, in the organisation of the progressive tasks of life, than they are in the organisation of the tasks of war.  That is the spirit in which these essays have been written by an Englishman of English stock in the narrowest sense, whose national and family instincts of independence and warfare have been transmuted into a preoccupation with the more constructive tasks of life. It is a spirit which may give to these little essays--mostly produced while war was in progress--a certain unity which was not designed when I wrote them.

II   EVOLUTION AND WAR  The Great War of to-day has rendered acute the question of the place of warfare in Nature and the effect of war on the human race. These have long been debated problems concerning which there is no complete agreement. But until we make up our minds on these fundamental questions we can gain no solid ground from which to face serenely, or at all events firmly, the crisis through which mankind is now passing.  It has been widely held that war has played an essential part in the evolutionary struggle for survival among our animal ancestors, that war has been a factor of the first importance in the social development of primitive human races, and that war always will be an essential method of preserving the human virtues even in the highest civilisation. It must be observed that these are three separate and quite distinct propositions. It is possible to accept one, or even two, of them without affirming them all. If we wish to clear our minds of confusion on this matter, so vital to our civilisation, we must face each of the questions by itself.  It has sometimes been maintained--never more energetically than to-day, especially among the nations which most eagerly entered the present conflict--that war is a biological necessity. War, we are told, is a manifestation of the \"Struggle for Life\"; it is the inevitable application to mankind of the Darwinian \"law\" of natural selection. There are, however, two capital and final objections to this view. On the one hand it is not supported by anything that Darwin himself said, and on the other hand it is denied as a fact by those authorities on natural history who speak with most knowledge. That Darwin regarded war as an insignificant or even non-existent part of natural selection must be clear to all who have read his books. He was careful to state that he used the term \"struggle for existence\" in a \"metaphorical sense,\" and the dominant factors in the struggle for existence, as Darwin understood it, were natural suitability to the organic and inorganic environment and the capacity for adaptation to circumstances; one species flourishes while a less efficient species living alongside it languishes, yet they may never come in actual contact and there is nothing in the least approaching human warfare. The conditions much more resemble what, among ourselves, we may see in business, where the better equipped species, that is to say, the big capitalist, flourishes, while the less well equipped species, the small capitalist, succumbs. Mr. Chalmers Mitchell, Secretary of the London Zoological Society and familiar with the habits of animals, has lately emphasised the contention of Darwin and shown that even the most widely current notions of the extermination of one species by another have no foundation in fact.[1] Thus the thylacine or Tasmanian wolf, the fiercest of the marsupials, has been entirely driven out of Australia and its place taken by a later and higher animal, of the dog family, the dingo. But there is not the slightest reason to believe that the dingo ever made war on the thylacine. If there was any struggle at all it was a common struggle against the environment, in which the dingo, by superior intelligence in finding food and rearing young, and by greater resisting power to climate and disease, was able to succeed where the thylacine failed. Again, the supposed war of extermination waged in Europe by the brown rat against the black rat is (as Chalmers Mitchell points out) pure fiction. In England, where this war is said to have been ferociously waged, both rats exist and flourish, and under conditions which do not usually even bring them into competition with each other. The black rat (_Mus rattus_) is smaller than the other, but more active and a better climber; he is the rat of the barn and the granary. The brown or Norway rat (_Mus decumanus_) is larger but less active, a burrower rather than a climber, and though both rats are omnivorous the brown rat is more especially a scavenger; he is the rat of sewers and drains. The black rat came to Northern Europe first--both of them probably being Asiatic animals--and has no doubt been to some extent replaced by the brown rat, who has been specially favoured by the modern extension of drains and sewers, which exactly suit his peculiar tastes. But each flourishes in his own environment; neither of them is adapted to the other's environment; there is no war between them, nor any occasion for war, for they do not really come into competition with each other. The cockroaches, or \"blackbeetles,\" furnish another example. These pests are comparatively modern and their great migrations in recent times are largely due to the activity of human commerce. There are three main species of cockroach--the Oriental, the American, and the German (or Croton bug)--and they flourish near together in many countries, though not with equal success, for while in England the Oriental is most prosperous, in America the German cockroach is most abundant. They are seldom found in actual association, each is best adapted to a particular environment; there is no reason to suppose that they fight. It is so throughout Nature. Animals may utilise other species as food; but that is true of even, the most peaceable and civilised human races. The struggle for existence means that one species is more favoured by circumstances than another species; there is not the remotest resemblance anywhere to human warfare.  We may pass on to the second claim for war: that it is an essential factor in the social development of primitive human races. War has no part, though competition has a very large part, in what we call \"Nature.\" But, when we come to primitive man the conditions are somewhat changed; men, unlike the lower animals, are able to form large communities--\"tribes,\" as we call them--with common interests, and two primitive tribes can come into a competition which is acute to the point of warfare because being of the same, and not of two different, species, the conditions of life which they both demand are identical; they are impelled to fight for the possession of these conditions as animals of different species are not impelled to fight. We are often told that animals are more \"moral\" than human beings, and it is largely to the fact that, except under the immediate stress of hunger, they are better able to live in peace with each other, that the greater morality of animals is due. Yet, we have to recognise, this mischievous tendency to warfare, so often (though by no means always, and in the earliest stages probably never) found in primitive man, was bound up with his superior and progressive qualities. His intelligence, his quickness of sense, his muscular skill, his courage and endurance, his aptitude for discipline and for organisation--all of them qualities on which civilisation is based--were fostered by warfare. With warfare in primitive life was closely associated the still more fundamental art, older than humanity, of dancing. The dance was the training school for all the activities which man developed in a supreme degree--for love, for religion, for art, for organised labour--and in primitive days dancing was the chief military school, a perpetual exercise in mimic warfare during times of peace, and in times of war the most powerful stimulus to military prowess by the excitement it aroused. Not only was war a formative and developmental social force of the first importance among early men, but it was"]]]
