Every officer of your ship was the Church's picked servant, and so was every man of the crew.\"  \"Oh, come!\"  \"It is just as I tell you.  I did not find out these things at once, but I found them out finally.  Did you send me verbal information, by the commander of the ship, to the effect that upon his return to you, with supplies, you were going to leave Cadiz--\"  \"Cadiz!  I haven't been at Cadiz at all!\"  \"--going to leave Cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely, for the health of your family?  Did you send me that word?\"  \"Of course not.  I would have written, wouldn't I?\"  \"Naturally.  I was troubled and suspicious.  When the commander sailed again I managed to ship a spy with him.  I have never heard of vessel or spy since.  I gave myself two weeks to hear from you in.  Then I resolved to send a ship to Cadiz.  There was a reason why I didn't.\"  \"What was that?\"  \"Our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared!  Also, as suddenly and as mysteriously, the railway and telegraph and telephone service ceased, the men all deserted, poles were cut down, the Church laid a ban upon the electric light!  I had to be up and doing--and straight off.  Your life was safe--nobody in these kingdoms but Merlin would venture to touch such a magician as you without ten thousand men at his back--I had nothing to think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your coming.  I felt safe myself--nobody would be anxious to touch a pet of yours.  So this is what I did.  From our various works I selected all the men--boys I mean--whose faithfulness under whatsoever pressure I could swear to, and I called them together secretly and gave them their instructions.  There are fifty-two of them; none younger than fourteen, and none above seventeen years old.\"  \"Why did you select boys?\"  \"Because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition and reared in it.  It is in their blood and bones.  We imagined we had educated it out of them; they thought so, too; the Interdict woke them up like a thunderclap!  It revealed them to themselves, and it revealed them to me, too.  With boys it was different.  Such as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had no acquaintance with the Church's terrors, and it was among these that I found my fifty-two.  As a next move, I paid a private visit to that old cave of Merlin's--not the small one--the big one--\"  \"Yes, the one where we secretly established our first great electric plant when I was projecting a miracle.\"  \"Just so.  And as that miracle hadn't become necessary then, I thought it might be a good idea to utilize the plant now.  I've provisioned the cave for a siege--\"  \"A good idea, a first-rate idea.\"  \"I think so.  I placed four of my boys there as a guard--inside, and out of sight.  Nobody was to be hurt--while outside; but any attempt to enter--well, we said just let anybody try it!  Then I went out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires which connected your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite deposits under all our vast factories, mills, workshops, magazines, etc., and about midnight I and my boys turned out and connected that wire with the cave, and nobody but you and I suspects where the other end of it goes to.  We laid it under ground, of course, and it was all finished in a couple of hours or so.  We sha'n't have to leave our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization.\"  \"It was the right move--and the natural one; military necessity, in the changed condition of things.  Well, what changes _have_ come! We expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other, but --however, go on.\"  \"Next, we built a wire fence.\"  \"Wire fence?\"  \"Yes.  You dropped the hint of it yourself, two or three years ago.\"  \"Oh, I remember--the time the Church tried her strength against us the first time, and presently thought it wise to wait for a hopefuler season.  Well, how have you arranged the fence?\"  \"I start twelve immensely strong wires--naked, not insulated --from a big dynamo in the cave--dynamo with no brushes except a positive and a negative one--\"  \"Yes, that's right.\"  \"The wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level ground a hundred yards in diameter; they make twelve independent fences, ten feet apart--that is to say, twelve circles within circles--and their ends come into the cave again.\"  \"Right; go on.\"  \"The fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart, and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground.\"  \"That is good and strong.\"  \"Yes.  The wires have no ground-connection outside of the cave. They go out from the positive brush of the dynamo; there is a ground-connection through the negative brush; the other ends of the wire return to the cave, and each is grounded independently.\"  \"No, no, that won't do!\"  \"Why?\"  \"It's too expensive--uses up force for nothing.  You don't want any ground-connection except the one through the negative brush. The other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave and fastened independently, and _without_ any ground-connection. Now, then, observe the economy of it.  A cavalry charge hurls itself against the fence; you are using no power, you are spending no money, for there is only one ground-connection till those horses come against the wire; the moment they touch it they form a connection with the negative brush _through the ground_, and drop dead.  Don't you see?--you are using no energy until it is needed; your lightning is there, and ready, like the load in a gun; but it isn't costing you a cent till you touch it off.  Oh, yes, the single ground-connection--\"  \"Of course!  I don't know how I overlooked that.  It's not only cheaper, but it's more effectual than the other way, for if wires break or get tangled, no harm is done.\"  \"No, especially if we have a tell-tale in the cave and disconnect the broken wire.  Well, go on.  The gatlings?\"  \"Yes--that's arranged.  In the center of the inner circle, on a spacious platform six feet high, I've grouped a battery of thirteen gatling guns, and provided plenty of ammunition.\"  \"That's it.  They command every approach, and when the Church's knights arrive, there's going to be music.  The brow of the precipice over the cave--\"  \"I've got a wire fence there, and a gatling.  They won't drop any rocks down on us.\"  \"Well, and the glass-cylinder dynamite torpedoes?\"  \"That's attended to.  It's the prettiest garden that was ever planted.  It's a belt forty feet wide, and goes around the outer fence--distance between it and the fence one hundred yards--kind of neutral ground that space is.  There isn't a single square yard of that whole belt but is equipped with a torpedo.  We laid them on the surface of the ground, and sprinkled a layer of sand over them.  It's an innocent looking garden, but you let a man start in to hoe it once, and you'll see.\"  \"You tested the torpedoes?\"  \"Well, I was going to, but--\"  \"But what?  Why, it's an immense oversight not to apply a--\"  \"Test?  Yes, I know; but they're all right; I laid a few in the public road beyond our lines and they've been tested.\"  \"Oh, that alters the case.  Who did it?\"  \"A Church committee.\"  \"How kind!\"  \"Yes.  They came to command us to make submission.  You see they didn't really come to test the torpedoes; that was merely an incident.\"  \"Did the committee make a report?\"  \"Yes, they made one.  You could have heard it a mile.\"  \"Unanimous?\"  \"That was the nature of it.  After that I put up some signs, for the protection of future committees, and we have had no intruders since.\"  \"Clarence, you've done a world of work, and done it perfectly.\"  \"We had plenty of time for it; there wasn't any occasion for hurry.\"  We sat silent awhile, thinking.  Then my mind was made up, and I said:  \"Yes, everything is ready; everything is shipshape, no detail is wanting.  I know what to do now.\"  \"So do I; sit down and wait.\"  \"No, _sir_! rise up and _strike_!\"  \"Do you mean it?\"  \"Yes, indeed!  The _de_fensive isn't in my line, and the _of_fensive is.  That is, when I hold a fair hand--two-thirds as good a hand as the enemy.  Oh, yes, we'll rise up and strike; that's our game.\"  \"A hundred to one you are right.  When does the performance begin?\"  \"_Now!_  We'll proclaim the Republic.\"  \"Well, that _will_ precipitate things, sure enough!\"  \"It will make them buzz, I tell you!  England will be a hornets' nest before noon to-morrow, if the Church's hand hasn't lost its cunning--and we know it hasn't.  Now you write and I'll dictate thus:                        \"PROCLAMATION                             ---     \"BE IT KNOWN UNTO ALL.  Whereas the king having died    and left no heir, it becomes my duty to continue the    executive authority vested in me, until a government    shall have been created and set in motion.  The    monarchy has lapsed, it no longer exists.  By    consequence, all political power has reverted to its    original source, the people of the nation.  With the    monarchy, its several adjuncts died also; wherefore    there is no longer a nobility, no longer a privileged    class, no longer an Established Church; all men are    become exactly equal; they are upon one common    level, and religion is free.  _A Republic is hereby    proclaimed_, as being the natural estate of a nation    when other authority has ceased.  It is the duty of    the British people to meet together immediately,    and by their votes elect representatives and deliver    into their hands the government.\"  I signed it \"The Boss,\" and dated it from Merlin's Cave. Clarence said--  \"Why, that tells where we are, and invites them to call right away.\"  \"That is the idea.  We _strike_--by the Proclamation--then it's their innings.  Now have the thing set up and printed and posted, right off; that is, give the order; then, if you've got a couple of bicycles handy at the foot of the hill, ho for Merlin's Cave!\"  \"I shall be ready in ten minutes."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7251"],["title","Sweet Cicely — or Josiah Allen as a Politician (#1)"],["body","turn round in his downward course, how can she expect he will after he has got her, and has let down his watch, so to speak?  But she loved him. And when I warned her with tears in my eyes, warned her that mebby it wus more than her own safety and happiness that wus imperilled, I could see by the look in her eyes, though she didn't say much, that it wusn't no use for me to talk; for she wus one of the constant natures that can't wobble round. And though I don't like wobblin', still I do honestly believe that the wobblers are happier than them that can't wobble.  I could see jest how it wuz, and I couldn't bear to have her blamed. And I would tell folks,--some of the relations on her mother's side,--when they would say, “What a fool she wus to have him!”--I'd say to 'em, “Wall, when a woman sees the man she loves goin' down to ruination, and tries to unlove him, she'll find out jest how much harder it is to unlove him than to love him in the first place: they'll find out it is a tough job to tackle.”  [Illustration: SAMANTHA AND THE “BLAMERS.”]  I said this to blamers of Cicely (relatives, the best blamers you can find anywhere). But, at the same time, it would have been my way, when he had come a courtin' me so far gone with liquor that he could hardly stand up--why, I should have told him plain, that I wouldn't try to set myself up as a rival to alcohol, and he might pay to that his attentions exclusively hereafter.  But she didn't. And he promised sacred to abstain, and could, and did, for most a year; and she married him.  But, jest before the marriage, I got so rousted up a thinkin' about what I had heard of him at college,--and I studied on his picture, which she had sent me, took sideways too, and I could see plain (why, he hadn't no chin at all, as you may say; and his lips was weak and waverin' as ever lips was, though sort o' amiable and fascinating),--and I got to forebodin' so about that chin, and my love for her wus a hunchin' me up so all the time, that I went to see her on a short tower, to beset her on the subject. But, good land! I might have saved my breath, I might have saved my tower.  I cried, and she cried too. And I says to her before I thought,--  “He'll be the ruin of you, Cicely.”  And she says, “I would rather be beaten by his hand, than to be crowned by another. Why, I love him, aunt Samantha.”  You see, that meant a awful sight to her. And as she looked at me so earnest and solemn, with tears in them pretty brown eyes, there wus in her look all that that word could possibly mean to any soul.  But I cried into my white linen handkerchief, and couldn't help it, and couldn't help sayin', as I see that look,--  “Cicely, I am afraid he will break your heart--kill you”--  “Why, I am not afraid to die when I am with him. I am afraid of nothing--of life, or death, or eternity.”  Well, I see my talk was no use. I see she'd have him, chin or no chin. If I could have taken her up in my arms, and run away with her then and there, how much misery I could have saved her from! But I couldn't: I had the rheumatiz. And I had to give up, and go home disappointed, but carryin' this thought home with me on my tower,--that I had done my duty by our sweet Cicely, and could do no more.  As I said, he promised firm to give up drinking. But, good land! what could you expect from that chin? That chin couldn't stand temptation if it came in his way. At the same time, his love for Cicely was such, and his good heart and his natural gentlemanly intuitions was such, that, if he could have been kep' out of the way of temptation, he would have been all right.  If there hadn't been drinking-saloons right in front of that chin, if it could have walked along the road without runnin' right into 'em, it would have got along. That chin, and them waverin'-lookin', amiable lips, wouldn't have stirred a step out of their ways to get ruined and disgraced: they wouldn't have took the trouble to.  And for a year or so he and the chin kep' out of the way of temptation, or ruther temptation kep' out of their way; and Cicely was happy,--radiently happy, as only such a nature as hern can be. Her face looked like a mornin' in June, it wus so bright, and glowing with joy and happy love.  I visited her, stayed 3 days and 2 nights with her; and I almost forgot to forebode about the lower part of his face, I found 'em so happy and prosperous and likely.  Paul wus very rich. He wus the only child: and his pa left 2 thirds of his property to him, and the other third to his ma, which wus more than she could ever use while she wus alive; and at her death it wus to go to Paul and his heirs.  They owned most all of the village they lived in. His pa had owned the township the village was built on, and had built most all the village himself, and rented the buildings. He owned a big manufactory there, and the buildings rented high.  Wall, it wus in the second year of their marriage that that old college chumb--(and I wish he had been chumbed by a pole, before he had ever gone there). He had lost his property, and come down in the world, and had to work for a livin'; moved into that village, and opened a drinking-saloon and billiard-room.  He had been Paul's most intimate friend at college, and his evil genius, so his mother said. But he was bright, witty, generous in a way, unprincipled, dissipated. And he wanted Paul's company, and he wanted Paul's money; and he had a chin himself, and knew how to manage them that hadn't any.  Wall, Cicely and his mother tried to keep Paul from that bad influence. But he said it would look shabby to not take any notice of a man because he wus down in the world. He wouldn't have much to do with him, but it wouldn't do to not notice him at all. How curius, that out of good comes bad, and out of bad, good. That was a good-natured idee of Paul's if he had had a chin that could have held up his principle; but he didn't.  So he gradually fell under the old influence again. He didn't mean to. He hadn't no idee of doin' so when he begun. It was the chin.  He begun to drink hard, spent his nights in the saloon, gambled,--slipped right down the old, smooth track worn by millions of jest such weak feet, towards ruin. And Cicely couldn't hold him back after he had got to slippin': her arms wuzn't strong enough.  She went to the saloon-keeper, and cried, and begged of him not to sell her husband any more liquor. He was very polite to her, very courteous: everybody was to Cicely. But in a polite way he told her that Paul wus his best customer, and he shouldn't offend him by refusing to sell him liquor. She knelt at his feet, I hearn,--her little, tender limbs on that rough floor before that evil man,--and wept, and said,--  “For the sake of her boy, wouldn't he have mercy on the boy's father.”  But in a gentle way he gave her to understand that he shouldn't make no change.  And he told her, speakin' in a dretful courteous way, “that he had the law on his side: he had a license, and he should keep right on as he was doing.”  [Illustration: CICELY IN THE SALOON.]  And so what could Cicely do? And time went on, carryin' Paul further and further down the road that has but one ending. Lower and lower he sunk, carryin' her heart, her happiness, her life, down with him.  And they said one cold night Paul didn't come home at all, and Cicely and his mother wus half crazy; and they wus too proud, to the last, to tell the servants more than they could help: so, when it got to be most mornin', them two delicate women started out through the deep snow, to try to find him, tremblin' at every little heap of snow that wus tumbled up in the path in front of 'em; tremblin' and sick at heart with the agony and dread that wus rackin' their souls, as they would look over the cold fields of snow stretching on each side of the road, and thinkin' how that face would look if it wus lying there staring with lifeless eyes up towards the cold moonlight,--the face they had kissed, the face they had loved,--and thinkin', too, that the change that had come to it--was comin' to it all the time--was more cruel and hopeless than the change of death.  So they went on, clear to the saloon; and there they found him,--there he lay, perfectly stupid, and dead with liquor.  And they both, the broken-hearted mother and the broken-hearted wife, with the tears running down their white cheeks, besought the saloon-keeper to let him alone from that night.  The mother says, “Paul is so good, that if you did not tempt him, entice him here, he would, out of pity to us, stop his evil ways.”  And the saloon-keeper was jest as polite as any man wus ever seen to be,--took his hat off while he told 'em, so I hearn, “that he couldn't go against his own interests: if Paul chose to spend his money there, he should take it.”  “Will you break our hearts?” cried the mother.  “Will you ruin my husband, the father of my boy?” sobbed out Cicely, her big, sorrowful eyes lookin' right through his soul--if he _had_ a soul.  And then the man, in a pleasant tone, reminded 'em,--  “That it wuzn't him that wus a doin' this. It wus the law: if they wanted things changed, they must look further than him. He had a license. The great Government of the United States had sold him, for a few dollars, the right to do just what he was doing. The law, and all the respectability that the laws of our great and glorious Republic can give, bore him out in all his acts. The law was responsible for all the consequenses of his acts: the men were responsible who voted for license--it was not him.”  “But you _can_ do what we ask if you will, out of pity to Paul, pity to us who love him so, and who are forced to stand by powerless, and see him going to ruin--we who would die for him willingly if it would do any good. You _can_ do this.”  He was a little bit intoxicated, or he wouldn't have gid 'em the cruel sneer he did at the last,--though he sneeren polite,--a holdin' his hat in his hand.  “As I said, my"]]]
