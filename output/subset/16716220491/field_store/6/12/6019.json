I knew he had lately been offered a situation in the Great Sahara, where lions and sandflies made the hermit-life peculiarly attractive and difficult, and had gone to Africa to take possession, so I thought I would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed with its reputation.  My surprise was great: the place was newly swept and scoured. Then there was another surprise.  Back in the gloom of the cavern I heard the clink of a little bell, and then this exclamation:  \"Hello Central!  Is this you, Camelot?--Behold, thou mayst glad thy heart an thou hast faith to believe the wonderful when that it cometh in unexpected guise and maketh itself manifest in impossible places--here standeth in the flesh his mightiness The Boss, and with thine own ears shall ye hear him speak!\"  Now what a radical reversal of things this was; what a jumbling together of extravagant incongruities; what a fantastic conjunction of opposites and irreconcilables--the home of the bogus miracle become the home of a real one, the den of a mediaeval hermit turned into a telephone office!  The telephone clerk stepped into the light, and I recognized one of my young fellows.  I said:  \"How long has this office been established here, Ulfius?\"  \"But since midnight, fair Sir Boss, an it please you.  We saw many lights in the valley, and so judged it well to make a station, for that where so many lights be needs must they indicate a town of goodly size.\"  \"Quite right.  It isn't a town in the customary sense, but it's a good stand, anyway.  Do you know where you are?\"  \"Of that I have had no time to make inquiry; for whenas my comradeship moved hence upon their labors, leaving me in charge, I got me to needed rest, purposing to inquire when I waked, and report the place's name to Camelot for record.\"  \"Well, this is the Valley of Holiness.\"  It didn't take; I mean, he didn't start at the name, as I had supposed he would.  He merely said:  \"I will so report it.\"  \"Why, the surrounding regions are filled with the noise of late wonders that have happened here!  You didn't hear of them?\"  \"Ah, ye will remember we move by night, and avoid speech with all. We learn naught but that we get by the telephone from Camelot.\"  \"Why _they_ know all about this thing.  Haven't they told you anything about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain?\"  \"Oh, _that_?  Indeed yes.  But the name of _this_ valley doth woundily differ from the name of _that_ one; indeed to differ wider were not pos--\"  \"What was that name, then?\"  \"The Valley of Hellishness.\"  \"_That_ explains it.  Confound a telephone, anyway.  It is the very demon for conveying similarities of sound that are miracles of divergence from similarity of sense.  But no matter, you know the name of the place now.  Call up Camelot.\"  He did it, and had Clarence sent for.  It was good to hear my boy's voice again.  It was like being home.  After some affectionate interchanges, and some account of my late illness, I said:  \"What is new?\"  \"The king and queen and many of the court do start even in this hour, to go to your valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye have restored, and cleanse themselves of sin, and see the place where the infernal spirit spouted true hell-flames to the clouds --an ye listen sharply ye may hear me wink and hear me likewise smile a smile, sith 'twas I that made selection of those flames from out our stock and sent them by your order.\"  \"Does the king know the way to this place?\"  \"The king?--no, nor to any other in his realms, mayhap; but the lads that holp you with your miracle will be his guide and lead the way, and appoint the places for rests at noons and sleeps at night.\"  \"This will bring them here--when?\"  \"Mid-afternoon, or later, the third day.\"  \"Anything else in the way of news?\"  \"The king hath begun the raising of the standing army ye suggested to him; one regiment is complete and officered.\"  \"The mischief!  I wanted a main hand in that myself.  There is only one body of men in the kingdom that are fitted to officer a regular army.\"  \"Yes--and now ye will marvel to know there's not so much as one West Pointer in that regiment.\"  \"What are you talking about?  Are you in earnest?\"  \"It is truly as I have said.\"  \"Why, this makes me uneasy.  Who were chosen, and what was the method?  Competitive examination?\"  \"Indeed, I know naught of the method.  I but know this--these officers be all of noble family, and are born--what is it you call it?--chuckleheads.\"  \"There's something wrong, Clarence.\"  \"Comfort yourself, then; for two candidates for a lieutenancy do travel hence with the king--young nobles both--and if you but wait where you are you will hear them questioned.\"  \"That is news to the purpose.  I will get one West Pointer in, anyway.  Mount a man and send him to that school with a message; let him kill horses, if necessary, but he must be there before sunset to-night and say--\"  \"There is no need.  I have laid a ground wire to the school. Prithee let me connect you with it.\"  It sounded good!  In this atmosphere of telephones and lightning communication with distant regions, I was breathing the breath of life again after long suffocation.  I realized, then, what a creepy, dull, inanimate horror this land had been to me all these years, and how I had been in such a stifled condition of mind as to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it.  I gave my order to the superintendent of the Academy personally. I also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and a box or so of safety matches.  I was getting tired of doing without these conveniences.  I could have them now, as I wasn't going to wear armor any more at present, and therefore could get at my pockets.  When I got back to the monastery, I found a thing of interest going on.  The abbot and his monks were assembled in the great hall, observing with childish wonder and faith the performances of a new magician, a fresh arrival.  His dress was the extreme of the fantastic; as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an Indian medicine-man wears.  He was mowing, and mumbling, and gesticulating, and drawing mystical figures in the air and on the floor,--the regular thing, you know.  He was a celebrity from Asia--so he said, and that was enough.  That sort of evidence was as good as gold, and passed current everywhere.  How easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellow's terms.  His specialty was to tell you what any individual on the face of the globe was doing at the moment; and what he had done at any time in the past, and what he would do at any time in the future.  He asked if any would like to know what the Emperor of the East was doing now?  The sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing of hands made eloquent answer--this reverend crowd _would_ like to know what that monarch was at, just as this moment.  The fraud went through some more mummery, and then made grave announcement:  \"The high and mighty Emperor of the East doth at this moment put money in the palm of a holy begging friar--one, two, three pieces, and they be all of silver.\"  A buzz of admiring exclamations broke out, all around:  \"It is marvelous!\"  \"Wonderful!\"  \"What study, what labor, to have acquired a so amazing power as this!\"  Would they like to know what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing? Yes.  He told them what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing.  Then he told them what the Sultan of Egypt was at; also what the King of the Remote Seas was about.  And so on and so on; and with each new marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher. They thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time; but no, he never had to hesitate, he always knew, and always with unerring precision.  I saw that if this thing went on I should lose my supremacy, this fellow would capture my following, I should be left out in the cold.  I must put a cog in his wheel, and do it right away, too.  I said:  \"If I might ask, I should very greatly like to know what a certain person is doing.\"  \"Speak, and freely.  I will tell you.\"  \"It will be difficult--perhaps impossible.\"  \"My art knoweth not that word.  The more difficult it is, the more certainly will I reveal it to you.\"  You see, I was working up the interest.  It was getting pretty high, too; you could see that by the craning necks all around, and the half-suspended breathing.  So now I climaxed it:  \"If you make no mistake--if you tell me truly what I want to know--I will give you two hundred silver pennies.\"  \"The fortune is mine!  I will tell you what you would know.\"  \"Then tell me what I am doing with my right hand.\"  \"Ah-h!\"  There was a general gasp of surprise.  It had not occurred to anybody in the crowd--that simple trick of inquiring about somebody who wasn't ten thousand miles away.  The magician was hit hard; it was an emergency that had never happened in his experience before, and it corked him; he didn't know how to meet it.  He looked stunned, confused; he couldn't say a word.  \"Come,\" I said, \"what are you waiting for?  Is it possible you can answer up, right off, and tell what anybody on the other side of the earth is doing, and yet can't tell what a person is doing who isn't three yards from you?  Persons behind me know what I am doing with my right hand--they will indorse you if you tell correctly.\"  He was still dumb.  \"Very well, I'll tell you why you don't speak up and tell; it is because you don't know.  _You_ a magician!  Good friends, this tramp is a mere fraud and liar.\"  This distressed the monks and terrified them.  They were not used to hearing these awful beings called names, and they did not know what might be the consequence.  There was a dead silence now; superstitious bodings were in every mind.  The magician began to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7247"],["title","A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 6.

In truth, the law of prophecy doth contradict the likelihoods, most strangely making the difficult easy, and the easy difficult.\"  It was a wise head.  A peasant's cap was no safe disguise for it; you could know it for a king's under a diving-bell, if you could hear it work its intellect.  I had a new trade now, and plenty of business in it.  The king was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live in them.  From that time out, I prophesied myself bald-headed trying to supply the demand.  I have done some indiscreet things in my day, but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the worst.  Still, it had its ameliorations.  A prophet doesn't have to have any brains.  They are good to have, of course, for the ordinary exigencies of life, but they are no use in professional work.  It is the restfulest vocation there is.  When the spirit of prophecy comes upon you, you merely cake your intellect and lay it off in a cool place for a rest, and unship your jaw and leave it alone; it will work itself: the result is prophecy.  Every day a knight-errant or so came along, and the sight of them fired the king's martial spirit every time.  He would have forgotten himself, sure, and said something to them in a style a suspicious shade or so above his ostensible degree, and so I always got him well out of the road in time.  Then he would stand and look with all his eyes; and a proud light would flash from them, and his nostrils would inflate like a war-horse's, and I knew he was longing for a brush with them.  But about noon of the third day I had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been suggested by the whip-stroke that had fallen to my share two days before; a precaution which I had afterward decided to leave untaken, I was so loath to institute it; but now I had just had a fresh reminder: while striding heedlessly along, with jaw spread and intellect at rest, for I was prophesying, I stubbed my toe and fell sprawling.  I was so pale I couldn't think for a moment; then I got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack. I had that dynamite bomb in it, done up in wool in a box.  It was a good thing to have along; the time would come when I could do a valuable miracle with it, maybe, but it was a nervous thing to have about me, and I didn't like to ask the king to carry it. Yet I must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get along with its society.  I got it out and slipped it into my scrip, and just then here came a couple of knights.  The king stood, stately as a statue, gazing toward them--had forgotten himself again, of course--and before I could get a word of warning out, it was time for him to skip, and well that he did it, too.  He supposed they would turn aside.  Turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt under foot?  When had he ever turned aside himself--or ever had the chance to do it, if a peasant saw him or any other noble knight in time to judiciously save him the trouble?  The knights paid no attention to the king at all; it was his place to look out himself, and if he hadn't skipped he would have been placidly ridden down, and laughed at besides.  The king was in a flaming fury, and launched out his challenge and epithets with a most royal vigor.  The knights were some little distance by now.  They halted, greatly surprised, and turned in their saddles and looked back, as if wondering if it might be worth while to bother with such scum as we.  Then they wheeled and started for us.  Not a moment must be lost.  I started for _them_. I passed them at a rattling gait, and as I went by I flung out a hair-lifting soul-scorching thirteen-jointed insult which made the king's effort poor and cheap by comparison.  I got it out of the nineteenth century where they know how.  They had such headway that they were nearly to the king before they could check up; then, frantic with rage, they stood up their horses on their hind hoofs and whirled them around, and the next moment here they came, breast to breast.  I was seventy yards off, then, and scrambling up a great bowlder at the roadside.  When they were within thirty yards of me they let their long lances droop to a level, depressed their mailed heads, and so, with their horse-hair plumes streaming straight out behind, most gallant to see, this lightning express came tearing for me!  When they were within fifteen yards, I sent that bomb with a sure aim, and it struck the ground just under the horses' noses.  Yes, it was a neat thing, very neat and pretty to see.  It resembled a steamboat explosion on the Mississippi; and during the next fifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic fragments of knights and hardware and horse-flesh.  I say we, for the king joined the audience, of course, as soon as he had got his breath again.  There was a hole there which would afford steady work for all the people in that region for some years to come --in trying to explain it, I mean; as for filling it up, that service would be comparatively prompt, and would fall to the lot of a select few--peasants of that seignory; and they wouldn't get anything for it, either.  But I explained it to the king myself. I said it was done with a dynamite bomb.  This information did him no damage, because it left him as intelligent as he was before.  However, it was a noble miracle, in his eyes, and was another settler for Merlin.  I thought it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort that it couldn't be done except when the atmospheric conditions were just right.  Otherwise he would be encoring it every time we had a good subject, and that would be inconvenient, because I hadn't any more bombs along.    CHAPTER XXVIII  DRILLING THE KING  On the morning of the fourth day, when it was just sunrise, and we had been tramping an hour in the chill dawn, I came to a resolution: the king _must_ be drilled; things could not go on so, he must be taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled, or we couldn't ever venture to enter a dwelling; the very cats would know this masquerader for a humbug and no peasant.  So I called a halt and said:  \"Sire, as between clothes and countenance, you are all right, there is no discrepancy; but as between your clothes and your bearing, you are all wrong, there is a most noticeable discrepancy.  Your soldierly stride, your lordly port--these will not do.  You stand too straight, your looks are too high, too confident.  The cares of a kingdom do not stoop the shoulders, they do not droop the chin, they do not depress the high level of the eye-glance, they do not put doubt and fear in the heart and hang out the signs of them in slouching body and unsure step.  It is the sordid cares of the lowly born that do these things.  You must learn the trick; you must imitate the trademarks of poverty, misery, oppression, insult, and the other several and common inhumanities that sap the manliness out of a man and make him a loyal and proper and approved subject and a satisfaction to his masters, or the very infants will know you for better than your disguise, and we shall go to pieces at the first hut we stop at.  Pray try to walk like this.\"  The king took careful note, and then tried an imitation.  \"Pretty fair--pretty fair.  Chin a little lower, please--there, very good.  Eyes too high; pray don't look at the horizon, look at the ground, ten steps in front of you.  Ah--that is better, that is very good.  Wait, please; you betray too much vigor, too much decision; you want more of a shamble.  Look at me, please--this is what I mean....  Now you are getting it; that is the idea--at least, it sort of approaches it....  Yes, that is pretty fair.  _But!_ There is a great big something wanting, I don't quite know what it is.  Please walk thirty yards, so that I can get a perspective on the thing....  Now, then--your head's right, speed's right, shoulders right, eyes right, chin right, gait, carriage, general style right--everything's right!  And yet the fact remains, the aggregate's wrong.  The account don't balance.  Do it again, please....  _Now_ I think I begin to see what it is.  Yes, I've struck it.  You see, the genuine spiritlessness is wanting; that's what's the trouble.  It's all _amateur_--mechanical details all right, almost to a hair; everything about the delusion perfect, except that it don't delude.\"  \"What, then, must one do, to prevail?\"  \"Let me think... I can't seem to quite get at it.  In fact, there isn't anything that can right the matter but practice.  This is a good place for it: roots and stony ground to break up your stately gait, a region not liable to interruption, only one field and one hut in sight, and they so far away that nobody could see us from there.  It will be well to move a little off the road and put in the whole day drilling you, sire.\"  After the drill had gone on a little while, I said:  \"Now, sire, imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder, and the family are before us.  Proceed, please--accost the head of the house.\"  The king unconsciously straightened up like a monument, and said, with frozen austerity:  \"Varlet, bring a seat; and serve to me what cheer ye have.\"  \"Ah, your grace, that is not well done.\"  \"In what lacketh it?\"  \"These people do not call _each other_ varlets.\"  \"Nay, is that true?\"  \"Yes; only those above them call them so.\"  \"Then must I try again.  I will call him villein.\"  \"No-no; for he may be a freeman.\"  \"Ah--so.  Then peradventure I should call him goodman.\"  \"That would answer, your grace, but it would be still better if you said friend, or brother.\"  \"Brother!--to dirt like that?\"  \"Ah, but _we_ are"]]]
