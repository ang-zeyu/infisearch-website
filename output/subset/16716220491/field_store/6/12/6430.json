(50) From these considerations I pass on to the Hebrew State, which I describe at some length, in order to trace the manner in which Religion acquired the force of law, and to touch on other noteworthy points. (51) I then prove, that the holders of sovereign power are the depositories and interpreters of religious no less than of civil ordinances, and that they alone have the right to decide what is just or unjust, pious or impious; lastly, I conclude by showing, that they best retain this right and secure safety to their state by allowing every man to think what he likes, and say what he thinks.  (52) Such, Philosophical Reader, are the questions I submit to your notice, counting on your approval, for the subject matter of the whole book and of the several chapters is important and profitable. (53) I would say more, but I do not want my preface to extend to a volume, especially as I know that its leading propositions are to Philosophers but common places. (54) To the rest of mankind I care not to commend my treatise, for I cannot expect that it contains anything to please them: I know how deeply rooted are the prejudices embraced under the name of religion; I am aware that in the mind of the masses superstition is no less deeply rooted than fear; I recognize that their constancy is mere obstinacy, and that they are led to praise or blame by impulse rather than reason. (55) Therefore the multitude, and those of like passions with the multitude, I ask not to read my book; nay, I would rather that they should utterly neglect it, than that they should misinterpret it after their wont. (56) They would gain no good themselves, and might prove a stumbling-block to others, whose philosophy is hampered by the belief that Reason is a mere handmaid to Theology, and whom I seek in this work especially to benefit. (57) But as there will be many who have neither the leisure, nor, perhaps, the inclination to read through all I have written, I feel bound here, as at the end of my treatise, to declare that I have written nothing, which I do not most willingly submit to the examination and judgment of my country's rulers, and that I am ready to retract anything, which they shall decide to be repugnant to the laws or prejudicial to the public good. (58) I know that I am a man and, as a man, liable to error, but against error I have taken scrupulous care, and striven to keep in entire accordance with the laws of my country, with loyalty, and with morality.     CHAPTER I. - Of Prophecy  (1) Prophecy, or revelation is sure knowledge revealed by God to man. (2) A prophet is one who interprets the revelations of God to those who are unable to attain to sure knowledge of the matters revealed, and therefore can only apprehend them by simple faith.  (3) The Hebrew word for prophet is \"_nabi_,\"[Endnote 1] i.e. speaker or interpreter, but in Scripture its meaning is restricted to interpreter of God, as we may learn from Exodus vii:1, where God says to Moses, \"See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet;\" implying that, since in interpreting Moses' words to Pharaoh, Aaron acted the part of a prophet, Moses would be to Pharaoh as a god, or in the attitude of a god.  (4) Prophets I will treat of in the next chapter, and at present consider prophecy.  (5) Now it is evident, from the definition above given, that prophecy really includes ordinary knowledge; for the knowledge which we acquire by our natural faculties depends on knowledge of God and His eternal laws; but ordinary knowledge is common to all men as men, and rests on foundations which all share, whereas the multitude always strains after rarities and exceptions, and thinks little of the gifts of nature; so that, when prophecy is talked of, ordinary knowledge is not supposed to be included. (6) Nevertheless it has as much right as any other to be called Divine, for God's nature, in so far as we share therein, and God's laws, dictate it to us; nor does it suffer from that to which we give the preeminence, except in so far as the latter transcends its limits and cannot be accounted for by natural laws taken in themselves. (7) In respect to the certainty it involves, and the source from which it is derived, i.e. God, ordinary knowledge is no whit inferior to prophetic, unless indeed we believe, or rather dream, that the prophets had human bodies but superhuman minds, and therefore that their sensations and consciousness were entirely different from our own.  (8) But, although ordinary knowledge is Divine, its professors cannot be called prophets [Endnote 2], for they teach what the rest of mankind could perceive and apprehend, not merely by simple faith, but as surely and honourably as themselves.  (9) Seeing then that our mind subjectively contains in itself and partakes of the nature of God, and solely from this cause is enabled to form notions explaining natural phenomena and inculcating morality, it follows that we may rightly assert the nature of the human mind (in so far as it is thus conceived) to be a primary cause of Divine revelation. (10) All that we clearly and distinctly understand is dictated to us, as I have just pointed out, by the idea and nature of God; not indeed through words, but in a way far more excellent and agreeing perfectly with the nature of the mind, as all who have enjoyed intellectual certainty will doubtless attest. (11) Here, however, my chief purpose is to speak of matters having reference to Scripture, so these few words on the light of reason will suffice.  (12) I will now pass on to, and treat more fully, the other ways and means by which God makes revelations to mankind, both of that which transcends ordinary knowledge, and of that within its scope; for there is no reason why God should not employ other means to communicate what we know already by the power of reason.  (13) Our conclusions on the subject must be drawn solely from Scripture; for what can we affirm about matters transcending our knowledge except what is told us by the words or writings of prophets? (14) And since there are, so far as I know, no prophets now alive, we have no alternative but to read the books of prophets departed, taking care the while not to reason from metaphor or to ascribe anything to our authors which they do not themselves distinctly state. (15) I must further premise that the Jews never make any mention or account of secondary, or particular causes, but in a spirit of religion, piety, and what is commonly called godliness, refer all things directly to the Deity. (16) For instance if they make money by a transaction, they say God gave it to them; if they desire anything, they say God has disposed their hearts towards it; if they think anything, they say God told them. (17) Hence we must not suppose that everything is prophecy or revelation which is described in Scripture as told by God to anyone, but only such things as are expressly announced as prophecy or revelation, or are plainly pointed to as such by the context.  (18) A perusal of the sacred books will show us that all God's revelations to the prophets were made through words or appearances, or a combination of the two. (19) These words and appearances were of two kinds; 1.- real when external to the mind of the prophet who heard or saw them, 2.- imaginary when the imagination of the prophet was in a state which led him distinctly to suppose that he heard or saw them.  (20) With a real voice God revealed to Moses the laws which He wished to be transmitted to the Hebrews, as we may see from Exodus xxv:22, where God says, \"And there I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from the mercy seat which is between the Cherubim.\" (21) Some sort of real voice must necessarily have been employed, for Moses found God ready to commune with him at any time. This, as I shall shortly show, is the only instance of a real voice.  (22) We might, perhaps, suppose that the voice with which God called Samuel was real, for in 1 Sam. iii:21, we read, \"And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh, for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord;\" implying that the appearance of the Lord consisted in His making Himself known to Samuel through a voice; in other words, that Samuel heard the Lord speaking. (23) But we are compelled to distinguish between the prophecies of Moses and those of other prophets, and therefore must decide that this voice was imaginary, a conclusion further supported by the voice's resemblance to the voice of Eli, which Samuel was in the habit of hearing, and therefore might easily imagine; when thrice called by the Lord, Samuel supposed it to have been Eli.  (24) The voice which Abimelech heard was imaginary, for it is written, Gen. xx:6, \"And God said unto him in a dream.\" (25) So that the will of God was manifest to him, not in waking, but only in sleep, that is, when the imagination is most active and uncontrolled. (26) Some of the Jews believe that the actual words of the Decalogue were not spoken by God, but that the Israelites heard a noise only, without any distinct words, and during its continuance apprehended the Ten Commandments by pure intuition; to this opinion I myself once inclined, seeing that the words of the Decalogue in Exodus are different from the words of the Decalogue in Deuteronomy, for the discrepancy seemed to imply (since God only spoke once) that the Ten Commandments were not intended to convey the actual words of the Lord, but only His meaning.

Some men were afraid that the new   art might do more harm than good. The king to whom the secret was told   thought that the children would be unwilling to work hard and try to   remember because everything could be written down and they would not   need to use their memories. The Egyptians at first used pictures to   put their words upon rocks or paper, and even after they made several   letters of the alphabet their writing seemed like a mixture of little   pictures and queer marks.    [Illustration: Cleopatra EGYPTIAN PHONETIC WRITING]  OLD AND NEW INVENTIONS. Those who first discover how to make things   are called inventors, and what they make are called inventions. Now if   we should write out a list of the most useful inventions, we could   place in one column the inventions which were made before the days of   Columbus and in another those which have been made since. With this   list before us we may ask which inventions we could live without and   which we could not spare unless we were willing to become like the   savages. We should find that a large number of the inventions which we   use every day belong to the set of things older than Columbus. This is   another reason why, if we wish to understand our ways of living and   working, we must ask about the history of the countries where our   forefathers lived. It is the beginning of our own history.    [Illustration: Phoenician Early Greek Early Latin English   GROWTH OF LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET]  A PLAN OF STUDY. The discovery of America was made in 1492, at the   beginning of what we call Modern Times. Before Modern Times were the   Middle Ages, lasting about a thousand years. These began three or four   hundred years after the time of Christ or what we call the beginning   of the Christian Era. All the events that took place earlier we say   happened in Ancient Times. Much that we know was learned first by the   Greeks or Romans who lived in Ancient Times.    It is in the Middle Ages that we first hear of peoples called   Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Dutchmen, Italians, Spaniards, and   many others now living in Great Britain and on the Continent of   Europe. We shall learn first of the Greeks and Romans and of what they   knew and succeeded in doing, and then shall find out how these things   were learned by the peoples of the Middle Ages and what they added to   them. This will help us to find out what our forefathers started with   when they came to live in America.       QUESTIONS      1. What does the emigrant from Europe bring to America besides his     baggage?      2. Why are all Americans emigrants?      3. What did the earliest emigrants from Europe to America bring with     them?      4. Which do you think the more useful invention--the telephone or     the art of writing? Who invented this art? Find Egypt on the map.     How did Egyptian writing look?      5. Why was it a help to Columbus that gunpowder and guns were     invented before he discovered America?      6. When did the Christian Era begin? What is meant by Ancient Times?     By the Middle Ages? By Modern Times? In what Times was the art of     writing invented? In what Times was the compass invented? In what     Times was the telephone invented?      EXERCISES      1. Collect from illustrated papers, magazines, or advertising     folders, pictures of ocean steamships. Collect pictures of sailing     ships, ships used now and those used long ago.      2. Collect from persons who have recently come to this country     stories of how they traveled from Europe to America, and from ports     like Boston, New York, and Philadelphia to where they now live.      3. Let each boy and girl in the schoolroom point out on the map the     European country from which his parents or his grandparents or his     forefathers came.      4. Let each boy and girl make a list of the holidays which his     forefathers had in the \"fatherland\" or \"mother country.\" Let each     find out the manner in which the holidays were kept. Let each tell     the most interesting hero story from among the stories of the mother     country or fatherland. Let each find out whether the tools used in     the old home were like the tools his parents use here.     CHAPTER II   OUR EARLIEST TEACHERS  ANCIENT CITIES THAT STILL EXIST. In Ancient Times the most   important peoples lived on the shores of the Mediterranean. The   northern shore turns and twists around four peninsulas. The first is   Spain, which separates the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean;   the second, shaped like a boot, is Italy; and the third, the end of   which looks like a mulberry leaf, is Greece. Beyond Greece is Asia   Minor, the part of Asia which lies between the Mediterranean Sea and   the Black Sea.    The Italians now live in Italy, but the Romans lived there in Ancient   Times. The people who live in Greece are called Greeks, just as they   were more than two thousand years ago. Many of the cities that the   Greeks and Romans built are still standing. Alexandria was founded by   the great conqueror Alexander. Constantinople used to be the Greek   city of Byzantium. Another Greek city, Massilia, has become the modern   French city of Marseilles. Rome had the same name in Ancient Times,   except that it was spelled Roma. The Romans called Paris by the name   of Lutetia, and London they called Lugdunum.  RUINS WHICH SHOW HOW THE ANCIENTS LIVED. In many of these cities   are ancient buildings or ruins of buildings, bits of carving, vases,   mosaics, sometimes even wall paintings, which we may see and from   which we may learn how the Greeks and Romans lived. Near Naples are   the ruins of Pompeii, a Roman city suddenly destroyed during an   eruption of the volcano Vesuvius.    For hundreds of years the city lay buried under fifteen or twenty feet   of ashes. When these were taken away, the old streets and the walls of   the houses could be seen. No roofs were left and the walls in many   places were only partly standing, but things which in other ancient   cities had entirely disappeared were kept safe in Pompeii under the   volcanic ashes.    The traveler who walks to-day along the ruined streets can see how its   inhabitants lived two thousand years ago. He can visit their public   buildings and their private houses, can handle their dishes and can   look at the paintings on their walls or the mosaics in the floors. But   interesting as Pompeii is, we must not think that its ruins teach us   more than the ruins of Rome or Athens or many other ancient cities.   Each has something important to tell us of the people who lived long   ago.  ANCIENT WORDS STILL IN USE. The ancient Greeks and Romans have left   us some things more useful than the ruins of their buildings. These   are the words in our language which once were theirs, and which we use   with slight changes in spelling. Most of our words came in the   beginning from Germany, where our English forefathers lived before   they settled in England. To the words they took over from Germany they   added words borrowed from other peoples, just as we do now. We have   recently borrowed several words from the French, such as tonneau and   limousine, words used to describe parts of an automobile, besides the   name automobile itself, which is made up of a Latin and a Greek word.    [Illustration: RUINS OF A HOUSE AT POMPEII The houses of the   better sort were built with an open court in the center]    In this way, for hundreds of years, words have been coming into our   language from other languages. Several thousand have come from Latin,   the language of the Romans; several hundred from Greek, either   directly or passed on to us by the Romans or the French. The word   school is Greek, and the word arithmetic was borrowed from the French,   who took it from the Greeks. Geography is another word which came,   through French and Latin, from the Greeks, to whom it meant that which   is written about the earth. The word grammar came in the same way. The   word alphabet is made by joining together the names of the first two   Greek letters, alpha and beta.    Many words about religion are borrowed from the Greeks, and this is   not strange, for the New Testament was written in Greek. Some of these   are Bible, church, bishop, choir, angel, devil, apostle, and martyr.   The Greeks have handed down to us many words about government,   including the word itself, which in the beginning meant \"to steer.\"   Politics meant having to do with a _polis_ or city. Several of the   words most recently made up of Greek words are telegraph, telephone,   phonograph, and thermometer.  MANY WORDS BORROWED FROM THE ROMANS. Nearly ten times as many of   our words are borrowed from the Romans as from the Greeks, and it is   not strange, because at one time the Romans ruled over all the country   now occupied by the Italians, the French, the Spaniards, a part of the   Germans, and the English, so that these peoples naturally learned the   words used by their conquerors and governors.  INTERESTING ANCIENT STORIES. In the poems and tales which we learn   at home or at school are stories which Greek and Roman parents and   teachers taught their children many hundred years ago. We learn them   partly because they are interesting, and because they please or amuse   us, and partly because they appear so often in our books that it is   necessary to know them if we would understand our own books and   language. Who has not heard of Hercules and his Labors, of the Search   for the Golden Fleece, the Siege of Troy, or the Wanderings of   Ulysses? We love modern fairy stories and tales of adventure, but they   are not more pleasing than these ancient stories.    [Illustration: THE PLAIN OF MARATHON]  THE STORY OF THE GREEKS. Our language and our books are full of   memories of Greek and Roman deeds of courage. The story of the Greeks   comes before the story of the Romans, for the "]]]
