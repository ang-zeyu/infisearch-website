But you said you would be back to-night; and you weren't here when I came. I telephoned and found that the train had come in all right, and that there wasn't another until the morning. Tomorrow morning's my limit, and to-morrow's the match.\" He stopped as he saw what Raffles was doing. \"Don't, Raffles, I don't deserve it!\" he added in fresh distress.  But Raffles had unlocked the tantalus and found a syphon in the corner cupboard, and it was a very yellow bumper that he handed to the guilty youth.  \"Drink some,\" he said, \"or I won't listen to another word.\"  \"I'm going to be ruined before the match begins. I am!\" the poor fellow insisted, turning to me when Raffles shook his head. \"And it'll break my father's heart, and--and--\"  I thought he had worse still to tell us, he broke off in such despair; but either he changed his mind, or the current of his thoughts set inward in spite of him, for when he spoke again it was to offer us both a further explanation of his conduct.  \"I only came up to leave a line for Raffles,\" he said to me, \"in case he did get back in time. It was the porter himself who fixed me up at that bureau. He'll tell you how many times I had called before. And then I saw before my nose in one pigeon-hole your cheque-book, Raffles, and your pass-book bulging with old cheques.\"  \"And as I wasn't back to write one for you,\" said Raffles, \"you wrote it for me. And quite right, too!\"  \"Don't laugh at me!\" cried the boy, his lost colour rushing back. And he looked at me again as though my long face hurt him less than the sprightly sympathy of his friend.  \"I'm not laughing, Teddy,\" replied Raffles kindly. \"I was never more serious in my life. It was playing the friend to come to me at all in your fix, but it was the act of a real good pal to draw on me behind my back rather than let me feel I'd ruined you by not turning up in time. You may shake your head as hard as you like, but I never was paid a higher compliment.\"  And the consummate casuist went on working a congenial vein until a less miserable sinner might have been persuaded that he had done nothing really dishonourable; but young Garland had the grace neither to make nor to accept any excuse for his own conduct. I never heard a man more down upon himself, or confession of error couched in stronger terms; and yet there was something so sincere and ingenuous in his remorse, something that Raffles and I had lost so long ago, that in our hearts I am sure we took his follies more seriously than our own crimes. But foolish he indeed had been, if not criminally foolish as he said. It was the old story of the prodigal son of an indulgent father. There had been, as I suspected, a certain amount of youthful riot which the influence of Raffles had already quelled; but there had also been much reckless extravagance, of which Raffles naturally knew less, since your scapegrace is constitutionally quicker to confess himself as such than as a fool. Suffice it that this one had thrown himself on his father's generosity, only to find that the father himself was in financial straits.  \"What!\" cried Raffles, \"with that house on his hands?\"  \"I knew it would surprise you,\" said Teddy Garland. \"I can't understand it myself; he gave me no particulars, but the mere fact was enough for me. I simply couldn't tell my father everything after that. He wrote me a cheque for all I did own up to, but I could see it was such a tooth that I swore I'd never come on him to pay another farthing. And I never will!\"  The boy took a sip from his glass, for his voice had faltered, and then he paused to light another cigarette, because the last had gone out between his fingers. So sensitive and yet so desperate was the blonde young face, with the creased forehead and the nervous mouth, that I saw Raffles look another way until the match was blown out.  \"But at the time I might have done worse, and did,\" said Teddy, \"a thousand times! I went to the Jews. That's the whole trouble. There were more debts--debts of honour--and to square up I went to the Jews. It was only a matter of two or three hundred to start with; but you may know, though I didn't, what a snowball the smallest sum becomes in the hands of those devils. I borrowed three hundred and signed a promissory note for four hundred and fifty-six.\"  \"Only fifty per cent!\" said Raffles. \"You got off cheap if the percentage was per annum.\"  \"Wait a bit! It was by way of being even more reasonable than that. The four hundred and fifty-six was repayable in monthly instalments of twenty quid, and I kept them up religiously until the sixth payment fell due. That was soon after Christmas, when one's always hard up, and for the first time I was a day or two late--not more, mind you; yet what do you suppose happened? My cheque was returned, and the whole blessed balance demanded on the nail!\"  Raffles was following intently, with that complete concentration which was a signal force in his equipment. His face no longer changed at anything he heard; it was as strenuously attentive as that of any judge upon the bench. Never had I clearer vision of the man he might have been but for the kink in his nature which had made him what he was.  \"The promissory note was for four-fifty-six,\" said he, \"and this sudden demand was for the lot less the hundred you had paid?\"  \"That's it.\"  \"What did you do?\" I asked, not to seem behind Raffles in my grasp of the case.  \"Told them to take my instalment or go to blazes for the rest!\"  \"And they?\"  \"Absolutely drop the whole thing until this very week, and then come down on me for--what do you suppose?\"  \"Getting on for a thousand,\" said Raffles after a moment's thought.  \"Nonsense!\" I cried. Garland looked astonished too.  \"Raffles knows all about it,\" said he. \"Seven hundred was the actual figure. I needn't tell you I have given the bounders a wide berth since the day I raised the wind; but I went and had it out with them over this. And half the seven hundred is for default interest, I'll trouble you, from the beginning of January down to date!\"  \"Had you agreed to that?\"  \"Not to my recollection, but there it was as plain as a pikestaff on my promissory note. A halfpenny in the shilling per week over and above everything else when the original interest wasn't forthcoming.\"  \"Printed or written on your note of hand?\"  \"Printed--printed small, I needn't tell you--but quite large enough for me to read when I signed the cursed bond. In fact I believe I did read it; but a halfpenny a week! Who could ever believe it would mount up like that? But it does; it's right enough, and the long and short of it is that unless I pay up by twelve o'clock to-morrow the governor's to be called in to say whether he'll pay up for me or see me made a bankrupt under his nose. Twelve o'clock, when the match begins! Of course they know that, and are trading on it. Only this evening I had the most insolent ultimatum, saying it was my 'dead and last chance.'\"  \"So then you came round here?\"  \"I was coming in any case. I wish I'd shot myself first!\"  \"My dear fellow, it was doing me proud; don't let us lose our sense of proportion, Teddy.\"  But young Garland had his face upon his hand, and once more he was the miserable man who had begun brokenly to unfold the history of his shame. The unconscious animation produced by the mere unloading of his heart, the natural boyish slang with which his tale had been freely garnished, had faded from his face, had died upon his lips. Once more he was a soul in torments of despair and degradation; and yet once more did the absence of the abject in man and manner redeem him from the depths of either. In these moments of reaction he was pitiful, but not contemptible, much less unlovable. Indeed, I could see the qualities that had won the heart of Raffles as I had never seen them before. There is a native nobility not to be destroyed by a single descent into the ignoble, an essential honesty too bright and brilliant to be dimmed by incidental dishonour; and both remained to the younger man, in the eyes of the other two, who were even then determining to preserve in him all that they themselves had lost. The thought came naturally enough to me. And yet I may well have derived it from a face that for once was easy to read, a clear-cut face that had never looked so sharp in profile, or, to my knowledge, half so gentle in expression.  \"And what about these Jews?\" asked Raffles at length.  \"There's really only one.\"  \"Are we to guess his name?\"  \"No, I don't mind telling you. It's Dan Levy.\"  \"Of course it is!\" cried Raffles with a nod for me. \"Our Mr. Shylock in all his glory!\"  Teddy snatched his face from his hands.  \"You don't know him, do you?\"  \"I might almost say I know him at home,\" said Raffles. \"But as a matter of fact I met him abroad.\"  Teddy was on his feet.  \"But do you know him well enough--\"  \"Certainly. I'll see him in the morning. But I ought to have the receipts for the various instalments you have paid, and perhaps that letter saying it was your last chance.\"  \"Here they all are,\" said Garland, producing a bulky envelope. \"But of course I'll come with you--\"  \"Of course you'll do nothing of the kind, Teddy! I won't have your eye put out for the match by that old ruffian, and I'm not going to let you sit up all night either. Where are you staying, my man?\"  \"Nowhere yet. I left my kit at the club. I was going out home if I'd caught you early enough.\"  \"Stout fellow! You stay here.\"  \"My dear old man, I couldn't think of it,\" said Teddy gratefully.  \"My dear young man, I don't care whether you think of it or not. Here you stay, and moreover you turn in at once. I can fix you up with all you want, and Barraclough shall bring your kit round before you're awake.\"  \"But you haven't got a bed, Raffles?\"  \"You shall have mine. I hardly ever go to bed--do I, Bunny?\"  \"I've seldom seen you there,\" said I.

There's something wrong,\" replied Hackett. \"I'm sure of it. I feel it! You ought to go and look for him, some of you gentlemen.\"  \"Where?\" asked Stafford. \"We don't know anything about him. He's not come to the 'Angel,' as he ought to have done, yesterday. I believe you're the last person who saw him, Hackett. Aren't you, now?\"  \"I saw him at the 'Golden Apple' at Northborough at twelve o'clock Saturday night, sir,\" answered Hackett. \"I took a bag of his to his rooms there. He was all right then. He knew I was going off first thing next morning to see an uncle of mine who's a farmer on the coast between here and Northborough, and he told me he shouldn't want me until one o'clock today. So of course, I came straight here to the theatre--I didn't call in at the 'Angel' at all this morning.\"  \"Did he say anything about his own movements yesterday?\" asked Stafford. \"Did he tell you that he was going anywhere?\"  \"Not a word, Mr. Stafford,\" replied Hackett. \"But you know his habits as well as I do.\"  \"Just so,\" agreed Stafford. \"Mr. Oliver,\" he continued, turning to Copplestone, \"is a great lover of outdoor life. On Sundays, when we're travelling from one town to another, he likes to do the journey by motor--alone. In a case like this, where the two towns are not very far apart, it's his practice to find out if there's any particular beauty spot or place of interest between them, and to spend his Sunday there. I daresay that's what he did yesterday. You see, all last week we were at Northborough. That, like Norcaster, is a coast town--there's fifty miles between them. If he followed out his usual plan he'd probably hire a motor-car and follow the coast-road, and if he came to any place that was of special interest, he'd stop there. But--in the usual way of things--he'd have turned up at his rooms at the 'Angel' hotel here last night. He didn't--and he hasn't turned up here, either. So where is he?\"  \"Have you made inquiries of the company, Mr. Stafford?\" asked Hackett. \"Most of 'em wander about a bit of a Sunday--they might have seen him.\"  \"Good idea!\" agreed Stafford. He beckoned Copplestone to follow him on to the stage, where the members of the company sat or stood about in groups, each conscious that something unusual had occurred. \"It's really a queer, and perhaps a serious thing,\" he whispered as he steered his companion through a maze of scenery. \"And if Oliver doesn't turn up, we shall be in a fine mess. Of course, there's an understudy for his part, but--I say!\" he went on, as they stepped upon the stage, \"Have any of you seen Mr. Oliver, anywhere, since Saturday night? Can anybody tell anything about him--anything at all? Because--it's useless to deny the fact--he's not come here, and he's not come to town at all, so far as we know. So--\"  Rothwell came hurrying on to the stage from the opposite wings. He hastened across to Stafford and drew him and Copplestone a little aside.  \"I've heard from Northborough,\" he said. \"I 'phoned Waters, the manager there, to run across to the 'Golden Apple' and make inquiries. The 'Golden Apple' people say that Oliver left there at eleven o'clock yesterday morning. He was alone. He simply walked out of the hotel. And they know nothing more.\"     CHAPTER II  GREY ROCK AND GREY SEA   The three men stood for a while silently looking at each other. Copplestone, as a stranger, secretly wondered why the two managers seemed so concerned; to him a delay of half an hour in keeping an appointment did not appear to be quite as serious as they evidently considered it. But he had never met Bassett Oliver, and knew nothing of his ways; he only began to comprehend matters when Rothwell turned to Stafford with an air of decision.  \"Look here!\" he said. \"You'd better go and make inquiry at Northborough. See if you can track him. Something must be wrong--perhaps seriously wrong. You don't quite understand, do you, Mr. Copplestone?\" he went on, giving the younger man a sharp glance. \"You see, we know Mr. Oliver so well--we've both been with him a good many years. He's a model of system, regularity, punctuality, and all the rest of it. In the ordinary course of events, wherever he spent yesterday, he'd have been sure to turn up at his rooms at the 'Angel' hotel last night, and he'd have walked in here this morning at half-past twelve. As he hasn't done either, why, then, something unusual has happened. Stafford, you'd better get a move on.\"  \"Wait a minute,\" said Stafford. He turned again to the groups behind him, repeating his question.  \"Has anybody anything to tell?\" he asked anxiously. \"We've just heard that Mr. Oliver left his hotel at Northborough yesterday morning at eleven o'clock, alone, walking. Has anybody any idea of any project, any excursion, that he had in mind?\"  An elderly man who had been in conversation with the leading lady stepped forward.  \"I was talking to Oliver about the coast scenery between here and Northborough the other day--Friday,\" he remarked. \"He'd never seen it--I told him I used to know it pretty well once. He said he'd try and see something of it on Sunday--yesterday, you know. And, I say--\" here he came closer to the two managers and lowered his voice--\"that coast is very wild, lonely, and a good bit dangerous--sharp and precipitous cliffs. Eh?\"  Rothwell clapped a hand on Stafford's arm.  \"You'd really better be off to Northborough,\" he said with decision. \"You're sure to come across traces of him. Go to the 'Golden Apple'--then the station. Wire or telephone me--here. Of course, this rehearsal's off. About this evening--oh, well, a lot may happen before then. But go at once--I believe you can get expresses from here to Northborough pretty often.\"  \"I'll go with you--if I may,\" said Copplestone suddenly. \"I might be of use. There's that cab still at the door, you know--shall we run up to the station?\"  \"Good!\" assented Stafford. \"Yes, come by all means.\" He turned to Rothwell for a moment. \"If he should turn up here, 'phone to Waters at the Northborough theatre, won't you?\" he said. \"We'll look in there as soon as we arrive.\"  He hurried out with Copplestone and together they drove up to the station, where an express was just leaving for the south. Once on their way to Northborough, Stafford turned to his companion with a grave shake of the head.  \"I daresay you don't quite see the reason of our anxiety,\" he observed. \"You see, we know Oliver. He's a trick of wandering about by himself on Sundays--when he gets the chance. Of course when there's a long journey between two towns, he doesn't get the chance, and then he's all right. But when, as in this case, the town of one week is fairly close to the town of the next, he invariably spots some place of interest, an old castle, or a ruined abbey, or some famous house, and goes looking round it. And if he's been exploring some spot on this coast yesterday, and it's as that chap Rutherford said, wild and dangerous, why, then--\"  \"You think he may have had an accident--fallen over the cliffs or something?\" suggested Copplestone.  \"I don't like to think anything,\" replied Stafford. \"But I shall be a good deal relieved if we can get some definite news about him.\"  The first half-hour at Northborough yielded nothing definite. A telephone message from Rothwell had just come to the theatre when they drove up to it--nothing had so far been heard of the missing man at Norcaster--either at theatre or hotel. Stafford and Copplestone hurried across to the \"Golden Apple\" and interviewed its proprietor; he, keenly interested in the affair, could tell no more than that Mr. Bassett Oliver, having sent his luggage forward to Norcaster, had left the house on foot at eleven o'clock the previous morning, and had been seen to walk across the market-place in the direction of the railway station. But an old head-waiter, who had served the famous actor's breakfast, was able to give some information; Mr. Oliver, he said, had talked a little to him about the coast scenery between Northborough and Norcaster, and had asked him which stretch of it was worth seeing. It was his impression that Mr. Oliver meant to break his journey somewhere along the coast.  \"Of course, that's it,\" said Stafford, as he and Copplestone drove off again. \"He's gone to some place between the two towns. But where? Anyhow, nobody's likely to forget Oliver if they've once seen him, and wherever he went, he'd have to take a ticket. Therefore--the booking-office.\"  Here at last, was light. One of the clerks in the booking-office came forward at once with news. Mr. Bassett Oliver, whom he knew well enough, having seen him on and off the stage regularly for the past five years, had come there the previous morning, and had taken a first-class single ticket for Scarhaven. He would travel to Scarhaven by the 11.35 train, which arrived at Scarhaven at 12.10. Where was Scarhaven? On the coast, twenty miles off, on the way to Norcaster; you changed for it at Tilmouth Junction. Was there a train leaving soon for Scarhaven? There was--in five minutes.  Stafford and Copplestone presently found themselves travelling back along the main line. A run of twenty minutes brought them to the junction, where, at an adjacent siding they found a sort of train in miniature which ran over a narrow-gauge railway towards the sea. Its course lay through a romantic valley hidden between high heather-clad moorland; they saw nothing of their destination nor of the coast until, coming to a stop in a little station perched high on the side of a hill they emerged to see shore and sea lying far beneath them.
