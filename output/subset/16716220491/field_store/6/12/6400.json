The Jews demand equal rights; when men demand equality with their masters, treason is at work, and justice sharpens her sword.  Equality! these wealthy usurers!  Sacred Virgin! they would be soon buying up our kingdoms.\"  The Dominican gazed hard on the king.  \"Son, I trust thee,\" he said, in a low voice, and glided from the tent.     CHAPTER II.  THE AMBUSH, THE STRIFE, AND THE CAPTURE.  The dawn was slowly breaking over the wide valley of Granada, as Almamen pursued his circuitous and solitary path back to the city.  He was now in a dark and entangled hollow, covered with brakes and bushes, from amidst which tall forest trees rose in frequent intervals, gloomy and breathless in the still morning air.  As, emerging from this jungle, if so it may be called, the towers of Granada gleamed upon him, a human countenance peered from the shade; and Almamen started to see two dark eyes fixed upon his own.  He halted abruptly, and put his hand on his dagger, when a low sharp whistle from the apparition before him was answered around--behind; and, ere he could draw breath, the Israelite was begirt by a group of Moors, in the garb of peasants.  \"Well, my masters,\" said Almamen, calmly, as he encountered the wild savage countenances that glared upon him, \"think you there is aught to fear from the solitary santon?\"  \"It is the magician,\" whispered one man to his neighbour--\"let him pass.\"  \"Nay,\" was the answer, \"take him before the captain; we have orders to seize upon all we meet.\"  This counsel prevailed; and gnashing his teeth with secret rage, Almamen found himself hurried along by the peasants through the thickest part of the copse.  At length, the procession stopped in a semicircular patch of rank sward, in which several head of cattle were quietly grazing, and a yet more numerous troop of peasants reclined around upon the grass.  \"Whom have we here?\" asked a voice which startled back the dark blood from Almamen's cheek; and a Moor of commanding presence rose from the midst of his brethren.  \"By the beard of the prophet, it is the false santon! What dost thou from Granada at this hour?\"  \"Noble Muza,\" returned Almamen--who, though indeed amazed that one whom he had imagined his victim was thus unaccountably become his judge, retained, at least, the semblance of composure--\"my answer is to be given only to my lord the king; it is his commands that I obey.\"  \"Thou art aware,\" said Muza, frowning, \"that thy life is forfeited without appeal?  Whatsoever inmate of Granada is found without the walls between sunrise and sunset, dies the death of a traitor and deserter.\"  \"The servants of the Alhambra are excepted,\" answered the Israelite, without changing countenance.  \"Ah!\" muttered Muza, as a painful and sudden thought seemed to cross him, \"can it be possible that the rumour of the city has truth, and that the monarch of Granada is in treaty with the foe?\" He mused a little; and then, motioning the Moors to withdraw, he continued aloud, \"Almamen, answer me truly: hast thou sought the Christian camp with any message from the king?\"  \"I have not.\"  \"Art thou without the walls on the mission of the king?\"  \"If I be so, I am a traitor to the king should I reveal his secret.\"  \"I doubt thee much, santon,\" said Muza, after a pause; \"I know thee for my enemy, and I do believe thy counsels have poisoned the king's ear against me, his people and his duties.  But no matter, thy life is spared a while; thou remainest with us, and with us shalt thou return to the king.\"  \"But, noble Muza----\"  \"I have said!  Guard the santon; mount him upon one of our chargers; he shall abide with us in our ambush.\"  While Almamen chafed in vain at his arrest, all in the Christian camp was yet still.  At length, as the sun began to lift himself above the mountains, first a murmur, and then a din, betokened warlike preparations.  Several parties of horse, under gallant and experienced leaders, formed themselves in different quarters, and departed in different ways, on expeditions of forage, or in the hope of skirmish with the straggling detachments of the enemy.  Of these, the best equipped, was conducted by the Marquess de Villena, and his gallant brother Don Alonzo de Pacheco.  In this troop, too, rode many of the best blood of Spain; for in that chivalric army, the officers vied with each other who should most eclipse the meaner soldiery in feats of personal valour; and the name of Villena drew around him the eager and ardent spirits that pined at the general inactivity of Ferdinand's politic campaign.  The sun, now high in heaven, glittered on the splendid arms and gorgeous pennons of Villena's company, as, leaving the camp behind, it entered a rich and wooded district that skirts the mountain barrier of the Vega. The brilliancy of the day, the beauty of the scene, the hope and excitement of enterprise, animated the spirits of the whole party. In these expeditions strict discipline was often abandoned, from the certainty that it could be resumed at need.  Conversation, gay and loud, interspersed at times with snatches of song, was heard amongst the soldiery; and in the nobler group that rode with Villena, there was even less of the proverbial gravity of Spaniards.  \"Now, marquess,\" said Don Estevon de Suzon, \"what wager shall be between us as to which lance this day robs Moorish beauty of the greatest number of its worshippers?\"  \"My falchion against your jennet,\" said Don Alonzo de Pacheco, taking up the challenge.  \"Agreed.  But, talking of beauty, were you in the queen's pavilion last night, noble marquess? it was enriched by a new maiden, whose strange and sudden apparition none can account for.  Her eyes would have eclipsed the fatal glance of Cava; and had I been Rodrigo, I might have lost a crown for her smile.\"  \"Ay,\" said Villena, \"I heard of her beauty; some hostage from one of the traitor Moors, with whom the king (the saints bless him!) bargains for the city.  They tell me the prince incurred the queen's grave rebuke for his attentions to the maiden.\"  \"And this morning I saw that fearful Father Tomas steal into the prince's tent.  I wish Don Juan well through the lecture.  The monk's advice is like the algarroba;--[The algarroba is a sort of leguminous plant common in Spain]--when it is laid up to dry it may be reasonably wholesome, but it is harsh and bitter enough when taken fresh.\"  At this moment one of the subaltern officers rode up to the marquess, and whispered in his ear.  \"Ha!\" said Villena, \"the Virgin be praised!  Sir knights, booty is at hand.  Silence! close the ranks.\"  With that, mounting a little eminence, and shading his eyes with his hand, the marquess surveyed the plain below; and, at some distance, he beheld a horde of Moorish peasants driving some cattle into a thick copse.  The word was hastily given, the troop dashed on, every voice was hushed, and the clatter of mail, and the sound of hoofs, alone broke the delicious silence of the noon-day landscape.  Ere they reached the copse, the peasants had disappeared within it.  The marquess marshalled his men in a semicircle round the trees, and sent on a detachment to the rear, to cut off every egress from the wood.  This done the troop dashed within.  For the first few yards the space was more open than they had anticipated: but the ground soon grew uneven, rugged, and almost precipitous, and the soil, and the interlaced trees, alike forbade any rapid motion to the horse.  Don Alonzo de Pacheco, mounted on a charger whose agile and docile limbs had been tutored to every description of warfare, and himself of light weight and incomparable horsemanship--dashed on before the rest.  The trees hid him for a moment; when suddenly, a wild yell was heard, and as it ceased uprose the solitary voice of the Spaniard, shouting, \"_Santiago, y cierra_, Espana; St. Jago, and charge, Spain!\"  Each cavalier spurred forward; when suddenly, a shower of darts and arrows rattled on their armour; and upsprung from bush and reeds, and rocky clift, a number of Moors, and with wild shouts swarmed around the Spaniards.  \"Back for your lives!\" cried Villena; \"we are beset--make for the level ground!\"  He turned-spurred from the thicket, and saw the Paynim foe emerging through the glen, line after line of man and horse; each Moor leading his slight and fiery steed by the bridle, and leaping on it as he issued from the wood into the plain.  Cased in complete mail, his visor down, his lance in its rest, Villena (accompanied by such of his knights as could disentangle themselves from the Moorish foot) charged upon the foe.  A moment of fierce shock passed: on the ground lay many a Moor, pierced through by the Christian lance; and on the other side of the foe was heard the voice of Villena--\"St. Jago to the rescue!\"  But the brave marquess stood almost alone, save his faithful chamberlain, Solier. Several of his knights were dismounted, and swarms of Moors, with lifted knives, gathered round them as they lay, searching for the joints of the armour, which might admit a mortal wound.  Gradually, one by one, many of Villena's comrades joined their leader, and now the green mantle of Don Alonzo de Pacheco was seen waving without the copse, and Villena congratulated himself on the safety of his brother.  Just at that moment, a Moorish cavalier spurred from his troop, and met Pacheco in full career.  The Moor was not clad, as was the common custom of the Paynim nobles, in the heavy Christian armour.  He wore the light flexile mail of the ancient heroes of Araby or Fez.  His turban, which was protected by chains of the finest steel interwoven with the folds, was of the most dazzling white--white, also, were his tunic and short mantle; on his left arm hung a short circular shield, in his right hand was poised a long and slender lance.  As this Moor, mounted on a charger in whose raven hue not a white hair could be detected, dashed forward against Pacheco, both Christian and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9758"],["title","Leila or, the Siege of Granada, Book III. (#1)"],["body","to the scanty society of the castle.  Under any other circumstances, the strangeness of all she saw, and the frowning gloom of the chamber to which she was consigned, would have damped the spirits of one whose destiny had so suddenly passed from the deepest quiet into the sternest excitement.  But any change was a relief to the roar of the camp, the addresses of the prince, and the ominous voice and countenance of Torquemada; and Leila looked around her, with the feeling that the queen's promise was fulfilled, and that she was already amidst the blessings of shelter and repose.  It was long, however, before sleep revisited her eyelids, and when she woke the noonday sun streamed broadly through the lattice.  By the bedside sat a matron advanced in years, but of a mild and prepossessing countenance, which only borrowed a yet more attractive charm from an expression of placid and habitual melancholy. She was robed in black; but the rich pearls that were interwoven in the sleeves and stomacher, the jewelled cross that was appended from a chain of massive gold, and, still more, a certain air of dignity and command,-- bespoke, even to the inexperienced eye of Leila, the evidence of superior station.  \"Thou hast slept late, daughter,\" said the lady, with a benevolent smile; \"may thy slumbers have refreshed thee!  Accept my regrets that I knew not till this morning of thine arrival, or I should have been the first to welcome the charge of my royal mistress.\"  There was in the look, much more than in the words of the Donna Inez de Quexada, a soothing and tender interest that was as balm to the heart of Leila; in truth, she had been made the guest of, perhaps, the only lady in Spain, of pure and Christian blood, who did not despise or execrate the name of Leila's tribe.  Donna Inez had herself contracted to a Jew a debt of gratitude which she had sought to return to the whole race.  Many years before the time in which our tale is cast, her husband and herself had been sojourning at Naples, then closely connected with the politics of Spain, upon an important state mission.  They had then an only son, a youth of a wild and desultory character, whom the spirit of adventure allured to the East.  In one of those sultry lands the young Quexada was saved from the hands of robbers by the caravanserai of a wealthy traveller.  With this stranger he contracted that intimacy which wandering and romantic men often conceive for each other, without any other sympathy than that of the same pursuits.  Subsequently, he discovered that his companion was of the Jewish faith; and, with the usual prejudice of his birth and time, recoiled from the friendship he had solicited, and shrank from the sense of the obligation he had incurred he--quitted his companion.  Wearied, at length, with travel, he was journeying homeward, when he was seized with a sudden and virulent fever, mistaken for plague: all fled from the contagion of the supposed pestilence--he was left to die.  One man discovered his condition-- watched, tended, and, skilled in the deeper secrets of the healing art, restored him to life and health: it was the same Jew who had preserved him from the robbers.  At this second and more inestimable obligation the prejudices of the Spaniard vanished: he formed a deep and grateful attachment for his preserver; they lived together for some time, and the Israelite finally accompanied the young Quexada to Naples.  Inez retained a lively sense of the service rendered to her only son, and the impression had been increased not only by the appearance of the Israelite, which, dignified and stately, bore no likeness to the cringing servility of his brethren, but also by the singular beauty and gentle deportment of his then newly-wed bride, whom he had wooed and won in that holy land, sacred equally to the faith of Christian and of Jew.  The young Quexada did not long survive his return: his constitution was broken by long travel, and the debility that followed his fierce disease. On his deathbed he had besought the mother whom he left childless, and whose Catholic prejudices were less stubborn than those of his sire, never to forget the services a Jew had conferred upon him; to make the sole recompense in her power--the sole recompense the Jew himself had demanded--and to lose no occasion to soothe or mitigate the miseries to which the bigotry of the time often exposed the oppressed race of his deliverer.  Donna Inez had faithfully kept the promise she gave to the last scion of her house; and, through the power and reputation of her husband and her own connections, and still more through an early friendship with the queen, she had, on her return to Spain, been enabled to ward off many a persecution, and many a charge on false pretences, to which the wealth of some son of Israel made the cause, while his faith made the pretext.  Yet, with all the natural feelings of a rigid Catholic, she had earnestly sought to render the favor she had thus obtained amongst the Jews minister to her pious zeal for their more than temporal welfare.  She had endeavored, by gentle means, to make the conversions which force was impotent to effect; and, in some instances, her success had been signal.  The good senora had thus obtained high renown for sanctity; and Isabel thought rightly that she could not select a protectress for Leila who would more kindly shelter her youth, or more strenuously labor for her salvation.  It was, indeed, a dangerous situation for the adherence of the maiden to that faith which it had cost her fiery father so many sacrifices to preserve and to advance.  It was by little and little that Donna Inez sought rather to undermine than to storm the mental fortress she hoped to man with spiritual allies; and, in her frequent conversation with Leila, she was at once perplexed and astonished by the simple and sublime nature of the belief upon which she waged war.  For whether it was that, in his desire to preserve Leila as much as possible from contact even with Jews themselves, whose general character (vitiated by the oppression which engendered meanness, and the extortion which fostered avarice) Almamen regarded with lofty though concealed repugnance; or whether it was, that his philosophy did not interpret the Jewish formula of belief in the same spirit as the herd,-- the religion inculcated in the breast of Leila was different from that which Inez had ever before encountered amongst her proselytes.  It was less mundane and material--a kind of passionate rather than metaphysical theism, which invested the great ONE, indeed, with many human sympathies and attributes, but still left Him the August and awful God of the Genesis, the Father of a Universe though the individual Protector of a fallen sect.  Her attention had been less directed to whatever appears, to a superficial gaze, stern and inexorable in the character of the Hebrew God, and which the religion of Christ so beautifully softened and so majestically refined, than to those passages in which His love watched over a chosen people, and His forbearance bore with their transgressions. Her reason had been worked upon to its belief by that mysterious and solemn agency, by which--when the whole world beside was bowed to the worship of innumerable deities, and the adoration of graven images,--in a small and secluded portion of earth, amongst a people far less civilised and philosophical than many by which they were surrounded, had been alone preserved a pure and sublime theism, disdaining a likeness in the things of heaven or earth.  Leila knew little of the more narrow and exclusive tenets of her brethren; a Jewess in name, she was rather a deist in belief; a deist of such a creed as Athenian schools might have taught to the imaginative pupils of Plato, save only that too dark a shadow had been cast over the hopes of another world.  Without the absolute denial of the Sadducee, Almamen had, probably, much of the quiet scepticism which belonged to many sects of the early Jews, and which still clings round the wisdom of the wisest who reject the doctrine of Revelation; and while he had not sought to eradicate from the breast of his daughter any of the vague desire which points to a Hereafter, he had never, at least, directed her thoughts or aspirations to that solemn future.  Nor in the sacred book which was given to her survey, and which so rigidly upheld the unity of the Supreme Power, was there that positive and unequivocal assurance of life beyond \"the grave where all things are forgotten,\" that might supply the deficiencies of her mortal instructor.  Perhaps, sharing those notions of the different value of the sexes, prevalent, from the remotest period, in his beloved and ancestral East, Almamen might have hopes for himself which did not extend to his child.  And thus she grew up, with all the beautiful faculties of the soul cherished and unfolded, without thought, without more than dim and shadowy conjectures, of the Eternal Bourne to which the sorrowing pilgrim of the earth is bound.  It was on this point that the quick eye of Donna Inez discovered her faith was vulnerable: who would not, if belief were voluntary, believe in the world to come?  Leila's curiosity and interest were aroused: she willingly listened to her new guide--she willingly inclined to conclusions pressed upon her, not with menace, but persuasion.  Free from the stubborn associations, the sectarian prejudices, and unversed in the peculiar traditions and accounts of the learned of her race, she found nothing to shock her in the volume which seemed but a continuation of the elder writings of her faith.  The sufferings of the Messiah, His sublime purity, His meek forgiveness, spoke to her woman's heart; His doctrines elevated, while they charmed, her reason: and in the Heaven that a Divine hand opened to all,--the humble as the proud, the oppressed as the oppressor, to the woman as to the lords of the earth,--she found a"]]]
