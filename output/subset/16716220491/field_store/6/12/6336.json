And Hercules was rejoiced, as any other hero would have been, to know that these fair young girls had heard of the valiant deeds which it had cost him so much toil and danger to achieve.  But, still, he was not satisfied.  He could not think that what he had already done was worthy of so much honor, while there remained any bold or difficult adventure to be undertaken.  “Dear maidens,” said he, when they paused to take breath, “now that you know my name, will you not tell me how I am to reach the garden of the Hesperides?”  “Ah! must you go so soon?” they exclaimed.  “You--that have performed so many wonders, and spent such a toilsome life--cannot you content yourself to repose a little while on the margin of this peaceful river?”  Hercules shook his head.  “I must depart now,” said he.  “We will then give you the best directions we can,” replied the damsels. “You must go to the sea-shore, and find out the Old One, and compel him to inform you where the golden apples are to be found.”  “The Old One!” repeated Hercules, laughing at this odd name.  “And, pray, who may the Old One be?”  “Why, the Old Man of the Sea, to be sure!” answered one of the damsels. “He has fifty daughters, whom some people call very beautiful; but we do not think it proper to be acquainted with them, because they have sea-green hair, and taper away like fishes.  You must talk with this Old Man of the Sea.  He is a sea-faring person, and knows all about the garden of the Hesperides; for it is situated in an island which he is often in the habit of visiting.”  Hercules then asked whereabouts the Old One was most likely to be met with.  When the damsels had informed him, he thanked them for all their kindness,--for the bread and grapes with which they had fed him, the lovely flowers with which they had crowned him, and the songs and dances wherewith they had done him honor,--and he thanked them, most of all, for telling him the right way,--and immediately set forth upon his Journey.  But, before he was out of hearing, one of the maidens called after him.  “Keep fast hold of the Old-One, when you catch him!” cried she, smiling, and lifting her finger to make the caution more impressive.  “Do not be astonished at anything that may happen.  Only hold him fast, and he will tell you what you wish to know.”  Hercules again thanked her, and pursued his way, while the maidens resumed their pleasant labor of making flower-wreaths.  They talked about the hero, long after he was gone.  “We will crown him with the loveliest of our garlands,” said they, “when he returns hither with the three golden apples, after slaying the dragon with a hundred heads.”  Meanwhile, Hercules travelled constantly onward, over hill and dale, and through the solitary woods.  Sometimes he swung his club aloft, and splintered a mighty oak with a downright blow.  His mind was so full of the giants and monsters with whom it was the business of his life to fight, that perhaps he mistook the great tree for a giant or a monster. And so eager was Hercules to achieve what he had undertaken, that he almost regretted to have spent so much time with the damsels, wasting idle breath upon the story of his adventures.  But thus it always is with persons who are destined to perform great things.  What they have already done seems less than nothing.  What they have taken in hand to do seems worth toil, danger, and life itself.  Persons who happened to be passing through the forest must have been affrighted to see him smite the trees with his great club.  With but a single blow, the trunk was riven as by the stroke of lightning, and the broad boughs came rustling and crashing down.  Hastening forward, without ever pausing or looking behind, he by and by heard the sea roaring at a distance.  At this sound, he increased his speed, and soon came to a beach, where the great surf-waves tumbled themselves upon the hard sand, in a long line of snowy foam.  At one end of the beach, however, there was a pleasant spot, where some green shrubbery clambered up a cliff, making its rocky face look soft and beautiful.  A carpet of verdant grass, largely intermixed with sweet-smelling clover, covered the narrow space between the bottom of the cliff and the sea.  And what should Hercules espy there, but an old man, fast asleep!  But was it really and truly an old man?  Certainly, at first sight, it looked very like one; but, on closer inspection, it rather seemed to be some kind of a creature that lived in the sea.  For, on his legs and arms there were scales, such as fishes have; he was web-footed and web-fingered, after the fashion of a duck; and his long beard, being of a greenish tinge, had more the appearance of a tuft of sea-weed than of an ordinary beard.  Have you never seen a stick of timber, that has been long tossed about by the waves, and has got all overgrown with barnacles, and, at last drifting ashore, seems to have been thrown up from the very deepest bottom of the sea?  Well, the old man would have put you in mind of just such a wave-tost spar!  But Hercules, the instant he set eyes on this strange figure, was convinced that it could be no other than the Old One, who was to direct him on his way.  Yes; it was the selfsame Old Man of the Sea, whom the hospitable maidens had talked to him about.  Thanking his stars for the lucky accident of finding the old fellow asleep, Hercules stole on tiptoe towards him, and caught him by the arm and leg.  “Tell me,” cried he, before the Old One was well awake, “which is the way to the garden of the Hesperides?”  As you may easily imagine, the Old Man of the Sea awoke in a fright. But his astonishment could hardly have been greater than was that of Hercules, the next moment.  For, all of a sudden, the Old One seemed to disappear out of his grasp, and he found himself holding a stag by the fore and hind leg!  But still he kept fast hold.  Then the stag disappeared, and in its stead there was a sea-bird, fluttering and screaming, while Hercules clutched it by the wing and claw!  But the bird could not get away.  Immediately afterwards, there was an ugly three-headed dog, which growled and barked at Hercules, and snapped fiercely at the hands by which he held him!  But Hercules would not let him go.  In another minute, instead of the three-headed dog, what should appear but Geryon, the six-legged man-monster, kicking at Hercules with five of his legs, in order to get the remaining one at liberty!  But Hercules held on.  By and by, no Geryou was there, but a huge snake, like one of those which Hercules had strangled in his babyhood, only a hundred times as big, and it twisted and twined about the hero’s neck and body, and threw its tail high into the air, and opened its deadly jaws as if to devour him outright; so that it was really a very terrible spectacle!  But Hercules was no whit disheartened, and squeezed the great snake so tightly that he soon began to hiss with pain.  You must understand that the Old Man of the Sea, though he generally looked so much like the wave-beaten figure-head of a vessel, had the power of assuming any shape he pleased.  When he found himself so roughly seized by Hercules, he had been in hopes of putting him into such surprise and terror, by these magical transformations, that the hero would be glad to let him go.  If Hercules had relaxed his grasp, the Old One would certainly have plunged down to the very bottom of the sea, whence he would not soon have given himself the trouble of coming up, in order to answer any impertinent questions.  Ninety-nine people out of a hundred, I suppose, would have been frightened out of their wits by the very first of his ugly shapes, and would have taken to their heels at once.  For, one of the hardest things in this world is, to see the difference between real dangers and imaginary ones.  But, as Hercules held on so stubbornly, and only squeezed the Old One so much the tighter at every change of shape, and really put him to no small torture, he finally thought it best to reappear in his own figure. So there he was again, a fishy, scaly, webfooted sort of personage, with something like a tuft of sea-weed at his chin.  “Pray, what do you want with me?” cried the Old One, as soon as he could take breath; for it is quite a tiresome affair to go through so many false shapes.  “Why do you squeeze me so hard?  Let me go, this moment, or I shall begin to consider you an extremely uncivil person!”  “My name is Hercules!” roared the mighty stranger.  “And you will never get out of my clutch, until you tell me the nearest way to the garden of the Hesperides!”  When the old fellow heard who it was that had caught him, he saw, with half an eye, that it would be necessary to tell him everything that he wanted to know.  The Old One was an inhabitant of the sea, you must recollect, and roamed about everywhere, like other sea-faring people. Of course, he had often heard of the fame of Hercules, and of the wonderful things that he was constantly performing, in various parts of the earth, and how determined he always was to accomplish whatever he undertook.  He therefore made no more attempts to escape, but told the hero how to find the garden of the Hesperides, and likewise warned him of many difficulties which must be overcome, before he could arrive thither.  “You must go on, thus and thus,” said the Old Man of the Sea, after taking the points of the compass, “till you come in sight of a very tall giant, who holds the sky on his shoulders.  And the giant, if he happens to be in the humor, will tell you exactly where the garden of the Hesperides lies.”  “And if the giant happens not to be in the humor,” remarked Hercules, balancing his club on the tip of his finger, “perhaps I shall find means to persuade him!”  Thanking the Old Man of the Sea, and begging his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9258"],["title","The Miraculous Pitcher (#1)"],["body","than try to pass through the village again.  What made the matter seem worse, if possible, was that when rich persons came in their chariots, or riding on beautiful horses, with their servants in rich liveries attending on them, nobody could be more civil and obsequious than the inhabitants of the village.  They would take off their hats, and make the humblest bows you ever saw.  If the children were rude, they were pretty certain to get their ears boxed; and as for the dogs, if a single cur in the pack presumed to yelp, his master instantly beat him with a club, and tied him up without any supper. This would have been all very well, only it proved that the villagers cared much about the money that a stranger had in his pocket, and nothing whatever for the human soul, which lives equally in the beggar and the prince.  So now you can understand why old Philemon spoke so sorrowfully, when he heard the shouts of the children and the barking of the dogs, at the farther extremity of the village street.  There was a confused din, which lasted a good while, and seemed to pass quite through the breadth of the valley.  “I never heard the dogs so loud!” observed the good old man.  “Nor the children so rude!” answered his good old wife.  They sat shaking their heads, one to another, while the noise came nearer and nearer; until, at the foot of the little eminence on which their cottage stood, they saw two travellers approaching on foot.  Close behind them came the fierce dogs, snarling at their very heels.  A little farther off, ran a crowd of children, who sent up shrill cries, and flung stones at the two strangers, with all their might.  Once or twice, the younger of the two men (he was a slender and very active figure) turned about, and drove back the dogs with a staff which he carried in his hand.  His companion, who was a very tall person, walked calmly along, as if disdaining to notice either the naughty children, or the pack of curs, whose manners the children seemed to imitate.  Both of the travellers were very humbly clad, and looked as if they might not have money enough in their pockets to pay for a night’s lodging.  And this, I am afraid, was the reason why the villagers had allowed their children and dogs to treat them so rudely.  “Come, wife,” said Philemon to Baucis, “let us go and meet these poor people.  No doubt, they feel almost too heavy-hearted to climb the hill.”  “Go you and meet them,” answered Baucis, “while I make haste within doors, and see whether we can get them anything for supper.  A comfortable bowl of bread and milk would do wonders towards raising their spirits.”  Accordingly, she hastened into the cottage.  Philemon, on his part, went forward, and extended his hand with so hospitable an aspect that there was no need of saying, what nevertheless he did say, in the heartiest tone imaginable,--  “Welcome, strangers! welcome!”  “Thank you!” replied the younger of the two, in a lively kind of way, notwithstanding his weariness and trouble.  “This is quite another greeting than we have met with yonder, in the village.  Pray, why do you live in such a bad neighborhood?”  “Ah!” observed old Philemon, with a quiet and benign smile, “Providence put me here, I hope, among other reasons, in order that I may make you what amends I can for the inhospitality of my neighbors.”  “Well said, old father!” cried the traveller, laughing; “and, if the truth must be told, my companion and myself need some amends.  Those children (the little rascals!) have bespattered us finely with their mud-ball; and one of the curs has torn my cloak, which was ragged enough already.  But I took him across the muzzle with my staff; and I think you may have heard him yelp, even thus far off.”  Philemon was glad to see him in such good spirits; nor, indeed, would you have fancied, by the traveller’s look and manner, that he was weary with a long day’s journey, besides being disheartened by rough treatment at the end of it.  He was dressed in rather an odd way, with a sort of cap on his head, the brim of which stuck out over both ears.  Though it was a summer evening, he wore a cloak, which he kept wrapt closely about him, perhaps because his under garments were shabby.  Philemen perceived, too, that he had on a singular pair of shoes; but, as it was now growing dusk, and as the old man’s eyesight was none the sharpest, he could not precisely tell in what the strangeness consisted.  One thing, certainly, seemed queer.  The traveller was so wonderfully light and active, that it appeared as if his feet sometimes rose from the ground of their own accord, or could only be kept down by an effort.  “I used to be light-footed, in my youth,” said Philemen to the traveller.  “But I always found my feet grow heavier towards nightfall.”  “There is nothing like a good staff to help one along,” answered the stranger; “and I happen to have an excellent one, as you see.”  This staff, in fact, was the oddest-looking staff that Philemon had ever beheld.  It was made of olive-wood, and had something like a little pair of wings near the top.  Two snakes, carved in the wood, were represented as twining themselves about the staff, and were so very skilfully executed that old Philemon (whose eyes, you know, were getting rather dim) almost thought them alive, and that he could see them wriggling and twisting.  “A curious piece of work, sure enough!” said he.  “A staff with wings! It would be an excellent kind of stick for a little boy to ride astride of!”  By this time, Philemon and his two guests had reached the cottage-door.  “Friends,” said the old man, “sit down and rest yourselves here on this bench.  My good wife Baucis has gone to see what you can have for supper.  We are poor folks; but you shall be welcome to whatever we have in the cupboard.”  The younger stranger threw himself carelessly on the bench, letting his staff fall, as he did so.  And here happened something rather marvellous, though trifling enough, too.  The staff seemed to get up from the ground of its own accord, and, spreading its little pair of wings, it half hopt, half flew, and leaned itself against the wall of the cottage.  There it stood quite still, except that the snakes continued to wriggle.  But, in my private opinion, old Philemon’s eyesight had been playing him tricks again.  Before he could ask any questions, the elder stranger drew his attention from the wonderful staff, by speaking to him.  “Was there not,” asked the stranger, in a remarkably deep tone of voice, “a lake, in very ancient times, covering the spot where now stands yonder village?”  “Not in my day, friend,” answered Philemon; “and yet I am an old man, as you see.  There were always the fields and meadows, just as they are now, and the old trees, and the little stream murmuring through the midst of the valley.  My father, nor his father before him, ever saw it otherwise, so far as I know; and doubtless it will still be the same, when old Philemon shall be gone and forgotten!”  “That is more than can be safely foretold,” observed the stranger; and there was something very stern in his deep voice.  He shook his head, too, so that his dark and heavy curls were shaken with the movement, “Since the inhabitants of yonder village have forgotten the affections and sympathies of their nature, it were better that the lake should be rippling over their dwellings again!”  The traveller looked so stern, that Philemon was really almost frightened; the more so, that, at his frown, the twilight seemed suddenly to grow darker, and that, when he shook his head, there was a roll as of thunder in the air.  But, in a moment afterwards, the stranger’s face became so kindly and mild, that the old man quite forgot his terror.  Nevertheless, he could not help feeling that this elder traveller must be no ordinary personage, although he happened now to be attired so humbly, and to be journeying on foot.  Not that Philemon fancied him a prince in disguise, or any character of that sort; but rather some exceedingly wise man, who went about the world in this poor garb, despising wealth and all worldly objects, and seeking everywhere to add a mite to his wisdom.  This idea appeared the more probable, because, when Philemon raised his eyes to the stranger’s face, he seemed to see more thought there, in one look, than he could have studied out in a lifetime.  While Baucis was getting the supper, the travellers both began to talk very sociably with Philemon.  The younger, indeed, was extremely loquacious, and made such shrewd and witty remarks, that the good old man continually burst out a-laughing, and pronounced him the merriest fellow whom he had seen for many a day.  “Pray, my young friend,” said he, as they grew familiar together, “what may I call your name?”  “Why, I am very nimble, as you see,” answered the traveller.  “So, if you call me Quicksilver, the name will fit tolerably well.”  “Quicksilver?  Quicksilver?” repeated Philemon, looking in the traveller’s face, to see if he were making fun of him.  “It is a very odd name!  And your companion there?  Has he as strange a one?”  “You must ask the thunder to tell it you!” replied Quicksilver, putting on a mysterious look.  “No other voice is loud enough.”  This remark, whether it were serious or in jest, might have caused Philemon to conceive a very great awe of the elder stranger, if, on venturing to gaze at him, he had not beheld so much beneficence in his visage; But, undoubtedly, here was the grandest figure that ever sat so humbly beside a cottage-door.  When the stranger conversed, it was with gravity, and in such a way that Philemon felt irresistibly moved to tell him everything which he had most at heart.  This is always the feeling that people have, when they meet with any one wise enough to comprehend all their good and evil, and to despise not a tittle of it.  But Philemon, simple and kind-hearted old man that he was, had not many secrets to disclose.  He"]]]
