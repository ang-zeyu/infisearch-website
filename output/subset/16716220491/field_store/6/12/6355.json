[Illustration: \"SHE PROPOSED THAT SHE SHOULD RIDE BACK WITH THE LIVERY MAN.\"]  I smiled some, I thought I must. But they wuz curius smiles, very, strange-lookin' smiles, sort o' gloomy ones, and mournful lookin'. I have got lots of different smiles that I keep by me for different occasions, every woman has, and this wuz one of my most mournfulest and curiusest ones.  Wall, the author of \"Wedlock's Peaceful and Perfect Repose\" insisted on goin', and she went. And I sez to her as she went down the steps, \"That if she would come up some other day when I didn't have quite so much work round, I would be as good as my word to her about hearin' her rehearse the lecture.\"  But she said, as she hurried out to the gate, lookin' pale an' wan (as wan agin as she did when she came, if not wanner): \"That she should make _changes_ in it before she ever rehearsed it agin--_deep changes_!\"  And I should dare to persume to say that she did. Though, as I say, she went off most awful sudden, and I hadn't seen nor heard from her sence till I got this letter.  Wall, jest as I got through with the authoresses letter, and Lodema Trumble's, Josiah Allen came. And I hurried up the supper. I got it all on the table while I wuz a steepin' my tea (it wuz good tea). And we sot down to the table happy as a king and his queen. I don't s'pose queens make a practice of steepin' tea, but mebby they would be better off if they did--and have better appetites and better tea. Any way we felt well, and the supper tasted good. And though Josiah squirmed some when I told him Lodema wuz approachin' and would be there that very night or the next day--still the cloud wore away and melted off in the glowin' mellowness of the hot tea and cream, the delicious oysters and other good things.  [Illustration: \"MY PARDNER ENJOYS GOOD VITTLES.\"]  My pardner, though, as he often says, is not a epicack, still he duz enjoy good vittles dretful well and appreciates 'em. And I make a stiddy practice of doin' the best I can by him in this direction.  And if more females would foller on and cipher out this simple rule, and get the correct answer to it, the cramp in the right hands of divorce lawyers would almost entirely disappear.  For truly it seems that _no_ human man _could be_ more worrysome, and curius, and hard to get along with than Josiah Allen is at times; still, by stiddy keepin' of my table set out with good vittles from day to day, and year to year, the golden cord of affection has bound him to me by ties that can't never be broken into.  He worships me! And the better vittles I get, the more he thinks on me. For love, however true and deep it is, is still a tumultous sea; it has its high tides, and its low ones, its whirlpools, and its calms.  He loves me a good deal better some days than he does others; I see it in his mean. And mark you! mark it well, female reader, these days are the ones that I cook up sights and sights of good food, and with a cheerful countenance and clean apron, set it before him in a bright room, on a snowy table-cloth!  Great--great is the mystery of men's love.  I have often and often repeated this simple fact and truth that underlies married life, and believe me, dear married sisters, too much cannot be said about it, by those whose hearts beat for the good of female and male humanity--and it _cannot_ be too closely followed up and practised by female pardners.  But I am a-eppisodin'; and to resoom.  Wall, Lodema Trumble arrove the next mornin' bright and early--I mean the mornin' wuz bright, not Lodema--oh no, fur from it; Lodema is never bright and cheerful--she is the opposite and reverse always.  She is a old maiden. I do think it sounds so much more respectful to call 'em so rather than \"old maid\" (but I had to tutor Josiah dretful sharp before I could get him into it).  I guess Lodema is one of the regular sort. There is different kinds of old maidens, some that could marry if they would, and some that would but couldn't. And I ruther mistrust she is one of the \"would-but-couldn't's,\" though I wouldn't dast to let her know I said so, not for the world.  Josiah never could bear the sight of her, and he sort o' blamed her for bein' a old maiden. But I put a stop to that sudden, for sez I:  \"She hain't to blame, Josiah.\"  And she wuzn't. I hain't a doubt of it.  Wall, how long she calculated to stay this time we didn't know. But we had our fears and forebodin's about it; for she wuz in the habit of makin' awful long visits. Why, sometimes she would descend right down onto us sudden and onexpected, and stay fourteen weeks right along--jest like a famine or a pestilence, or any other simely that you are a mind to bring up that is tuckerin' and stiddy.  And she wuz disagreeable, I'll confess, and she wuz tuckerin', but I done well by her, and stood between her and Josiah all I could. He loved to put on her, and she loved to impose on him. I don't stand up for either on 'em, but they wuz at regular swords' pints all the time a'most. And it come fearful tuff on me, fearful tuff, for I had to stand the brunt on it.  But she is a disagreeable creeter, and no mistake. She is one of them that can't find one solitary thing or one solitary person in this wide world to suit 'em. If the weather is cold she is pinin' for hot weather, and if the weather is hot she is pantin' for zero.  [Illustration: \"BUT SHE IS A DISAGREEABLE CREETER.\"]  If it is a pleasant day the sun hurts her eyes, and if it is cloudy she groans aloud and says \"she can't see.\"  And no human bein' wuz ever known to suit her. She gets up early in the mornin' and puts on her specs, and goes out (as it were) a-huntin' up faults in folks. And she finds 'em, finds lots of 'em. And then she spends the rest of the day a-drivin' 'em ahead of her, and groanin' at 'em.  You know this world bein' such a big place and so many different sort o' things in it that you can generally find in it the perticuler sort of game you set out to hunt in the mornin'.  If you set out to hunt beauty and goodness, if you take good aim and are perseverin'--if you jest track 'em and foller 'em stiddy from mornin' till night, and don't get led away a-follerin' up some other game, such as meanness and selfishness and other such worthless head o' cattle--why, at night you will come in with a sight of good game. You will be a noble and happy hunter.  [Illustration: \"BUT FIT WITH THEIR TONGUES, FEARFUL.\"]  At the same time, if you hunt all day for faults you will come in at night with sights of pelts. You will find what you hunt for, track 'em right along and chase 'em down.  Wall, Lodema never got led away from her perticuler chase. She just hunted faults from mornin' till night, and done well at it. She brought in sights of skins.  But oh! wuzn't it disagreeable in the extreme to Samantha, who had always tried to bend her bow and bring down Beauty, to have her familiar huntin' grounds turned into so different a warpath. It wuz disagreeable! It wuz! It wuz!  And then, havin' to stand between her and Josiah too, wuz fearful wearin' on me. I had always stood there in the past, and now in this visit it wuz jest the same; all the hull time, till about the middle of the fifth week, I had to stand between their two tongues--they didn't fight with their hands, but fit with their tongues, fearful."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9445"],["title","Samantha among the Brethren — Volume 3 (#1)"],["body","somethin' I couldn't help approvin' of, and it wuz somethin' that would happify me, and be a solid comfort to her, and a great gain and honor.\"  So (though I trembled some for the result) I had to let it go on, for she wuz one of the relations on his own side, and I knew it wouldn't do for me to interfere too much, and meddle.  Why, he did come right out one day and give hints to me to that effect.  Sez I, \"Why do you go on and be so secret about it? Why don't you tell your companion all about it, what you are a-goin' to do, and advise with her?\"  And he sez, \"I guess I know what I am about. She is one of the relations on my side, and I guess I have got a few rights left, and a little spunk.\"  \"Yes,\" sez I, sadly, \"you have got the spunk.\"  \"Wall,\" sez he, \"I guess I can spunk up, and do somethin' for one of my own relations, without any interference or any advice from any of the Smith family, or anybody else.\"  Sez I, \"I don't want to stop your doin' all you can for Lodema, but why not tell what you are a-goin' to do?\"  \"It will be time enough when the time comes,\" sez he. \"You will find it out in the course of next week.\"  Wall, it run along to the middle of the next week. And one day I had jest sot down to tie off a comforter.  It wuz unbleached cheese cloth that I had bought and colored with tea leaves. It wuz a sort of a light mice color, a pretty soft gray, and I wuz goin' to tie it in with little balls of red zephyr woosted, and work it in buttonhole stitch round the edge with the same.  It wuz fur our bed, Josiah's and mine, and it wuz goin' to be soft and warm and very pretty, though I say it, that shouldn't.  [Illustration: \"I HAD JEST SOT DOWN TO TIE OFF A COMFORTER.\"]  It wuzn't quite so pretty as them that hain't colored. I had 'em for my spare beds, cream color tied with pale blue and pink, that wuz perfectly beautiful and very dressy; but I thought for everyday use a colored one would be better.  Wall, I had brought it out and wuz jest a-goin' to put it onto the frames (some new-fashioned ones I had borrowed from Tirzah Ann for the occasion).  And Cousin Lodema had jest observed, \"that the new-fashioned frames with legs wuzn't good for nothin', and she didn't like the color of gray, it looked too melancholy, and would be apt to depress our feelin's too much, and would be tryin' to our complexions.\"  And I told her \"that I didn't spoze there would be a very great congregation in our bedroom, as a general thing in the dead of night, to see whether it wuz becomin' to Josiah and me or not. And, it bein' as dark as Egypt, our complexions wouldn't make a very bad show any way.\"  \"Wall,\" she said, \"to tie it with red wuzn't at all appropriate, it wuz too dressy a color for folks of our age, Josiah's and mine.\" \"Why,\" sez she, \"even _I_, at _my_ age, would skurcely care to sleep under one so gay. And she wouldn't have a cheese cloth comforter any way.\" She sort o' stopped to ketch breath, and Josiah sez:  \"Oh, wall, Lodema, a cheese cloth comforter is better than none, and I should think you would be jest the one to like any sort of a frame on legs.\"  But I wunk at him, a real severe and warnin' wink, and he stopped short off, for all the world as if he had forgot bein' on his good behavior; he stopped short off, and went right to behavin', and sez he to me:  \"Don't put on your comforter to-day, Samantha, for Tirzah Ann and Whitfield and the babe are a-comin' over here bimeby, and Maggie is a-comin', and Thomas Jefferson.\"  \"Wall,\" sez I, \"that is a good reason why I should keep on with it; the girls can help me if I don't get it off before they get here.\"  And then he sez, \"Miss Minkley is a-comin', too, and the Elder.\"  \"Why'ee,\" sez I, \"Josiah Allen, why didn't you tell me before, so I could have baked up somethin' nice? What a man you are to keep things; how long have you known it?\"  \"Oh, a week or so!\"  \"A week!\" sez I; \"Josiah Allen, where is your conscience? if you have got a conscience.\"  \"In the same old place,\" sez he, kinder hittin' himself in the pit of his stomach.  \"Wall, I should think as much,\" sez I.  And Lodema sez, sez she: \"A man that won't tell things is of all creeters that walks the earth the most disagreeable. And I should think the girls, Maggie and Tirzah Ann, would want to stay to home and clean house such a day as this is. And I should think a Elder would want to stay to home so's to be on hand in case of anybody happenin' to be exercised in their minds, and wantin to talk to him on religious subjects. And if I wuz a Elder's wife, I should stay to home with him; I should think it wuz my duty and my privilege. And if I wuz a married woman, I would have enough baked up in the house all the time, so's not to be afraid of company.\"  But I didn't answer back. I jest sot away my frames, and went out and stirred up a cake; I had one kind by me, besides cookies and jell tarts.  But I felt real worked up to think I hadn't heard. Wall, I hadn't more'n got that cake fairly into the oven when the children come, and Elder Minkley and his wife. And I thought they looked queer, and I thought the Elder begun to tell me somethin', and I thought I see Josiah wink at him. But I wouldn't want to take my oath whether he wunk or not, but I _thought_ he wunk.  I wuz jest a turnin' this over in my mind, and a carryin' away their things, when I glanced out of the settin' room winder, and lo, and behold! there wuz Abi Adsit a comin' up to the front door, and right behind her wuz her Pa and Ma Adsit, and Deacon Henzy and his wife, and Miss Henn and Metilda, and Lute Pitkins and his wife, and Miss Petengill, and Deacon Sypher and Drusilly, and Submit Tewksbury--a hull string of 'em as long as a procession.  Sez I, and I spoke it right out before I thought--sez I--  \"Why'ee!\" sez I. \"For the land's sake!\" sez I, \"has there been a funeral, or anything? And are these the mourners?\" sez I. \"Are they stoppin' here to warm?\"  For it wuz a cold day--and I repeated the words to myself mechanically as it wuz, as I see 'em file up the path.  \"They be mourners, hain't they?\"  \"No,\" sez Josiah, who had come in and wuz a standin' by the side of me, as I spoke out to myself unbeknown to me--sez he in a proud axent--  \"No, they hain't mourners, they are Happyfiers; they are Highlariers; they have come to our party. We are givin' a party, Samantha. We are havin' a diamond weddin' here for Lodema.\"  \"A diamond weddin'!\" I repeated mechanically.  \"Yes, this is my happy surprise for Lodema.\"  I looked at Lodema Trumble. She looked strange. She had sunk back in her chair. I thought she wuz a-goin' to faint, and she told somebody the next day, \"that she did almost lose her conscientiousness.\"  \"Why,\" sez I, \"she hain't married.\"  [Illustration: \"WE ARE GIVIN' A PARTY, SAMANTHA.\"]  \"Wall, she ort to be, if she hain't,\" sez he. \"I say it is high time for her to have some sort of a weddin'. Everybody is a havin' 'em--tin, and silver and wooden, and basswood, and glass, and etc.--and I thought it wuz a perfect shame that Lodema shouldn't have none of no kind--and I thought I'd  lay to, and surprise her with one. Every other man seemed to be a-holdin' off, not willin' seemin'ly that she should have one, and I jest thought I would happify her with one.\"  \"Wall, why didn't you make her a silver one, or a tin?\" sez I.  \"Or a paper one!\" screamed Lodema, who had riz up out of her almost faintin' condition. \"That would have been much more appropriate,\" sez she.  \"Wall, I thought a diamond one would be more profitable to her. For I asked 'em all to bring diamonds, if they brought anything. And then I thought it would be more suitable to her age.\"  \"Why!\" she screamed out. \"They have to be married seventy-five years before they can have one.\"  \"Yes,\" sez he dreemily, \"I thought that would be about the right figure.\"  Lodema wuz too mad to find fault or complain or anything. She jest marched up-stairs and didn't come down agin that night. And the young folks had a splendid good time, and the old ones, too.  Tirzah Ann and Maggie had brought some refreshments with 'em, and so had some of the other wimmen, and, with what I had, there wuz enough, and more than enough, to refresh ourselves with.  Wall, the very next mornin' Lodema marched down like a grenideer, and ordered Josiah to take her to the train. And she eat breakfast with her things on, and went away immegiately after, and hain't been back here sense.  And I wuz truly glad to see her go, but wuz sorry she went in such a way, and I tell Josiah he wuz to blame,  But he acts as innocent as you pleese. And he goes all over the arguments agin every time I take him to do about it. He sez \"she wuz old enough to have a weddin' of some kind.\"  And of course I can't dispute that, when he faces me right down, and sez:  \"Hain't she old enough?\"  And I'll say, kinder short--  \"Why, I spoze so!\"  \"Wall,\" sez he, \"wouldn't it have been profitable to her if they had brought diamonds? Wouldn't it have been both surprisin' and profitable?\" And sez he, \"I told 'em expressly to bring diamonds if they had more than they wanted. I charged old Bobbet and Lute Pitkins specially on the subject. I didn't want 'em to scrimp themselves; but,\" sez I, \"if you have got more diamonds than you want, Lute, bring over a few to Lodema.\"  [Illustration: \"IF YOU HAVE GOT MORE DIAMONDS THAN YOU WANT.\"]  \"Yes,\" sez I, coldly, \"he wuz dretful likely to have diamonds more then he wanted, workin' out by day's work to support his family. You know there wuzn't a soul you invited that owned a diamond.\"  \"How did I know what they owned? I never have prowled round into their bureau draws and things, tryin' to find out what they had; they might have had quarts of 'em, and I not know it.\"  Sez I, \"You did it to make fun of Lodema and get rid of her. And it only makes it worse to try to smooth it over.\" Sez I, \"I'd be honorable about it if I wuz in your place, and own up.\"  \"Own up? What have I got to own up? I shall always"]]]
