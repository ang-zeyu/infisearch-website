But as it was, he stood aloof from the rude superstition of his age, and early in life made himself the arbiter of his own conscience.  Reducing his religion to the simplest elements of our creed, he found rather in the books of Heathen authors than in the lives of the saints, his notions of the larger morality which relates to the citizen and the man.  The love of country; the sense of justice; fortitude in adverse and temperance in prosperous fortune, became portions of his very mind.  Unlike his father, he played no actor's part in those qualities which had won him the popular heart.  He was gentle and affable; above all, he was fair- dealing and just, not because it was politic to seem, but his nature to be, so.  Nevertheless, Harold's character, beautiful and sublime in many respects as it was, had its strong leaven of human imperfection in that very self-dependence which was born of his reason and his pride. In resting so solely on man's perceptions of the right, he lost one attribute of the true hero--faith.  We do not mean that word in the religious sense alone, but in the more comprehensive.  He did not rely on the Celestial Something pervading all nature, never seen, only felt when duly courted, stronger and lovelier than what eye could behold and mere reason could embrace.  Believing, it is true, in God, he lost those fine links that unite God to man's secret heart, and which are woven alike from the simplicity of the child and the wisdom of the poet.  To use a modern illustration, his large mind was a \"cupola lighted from below.\"  His bravery, though inflexible as the fiercest sea-king's, when need arose for its exercise, was not his prominent characteristic.  He despised the brute valour of Tostig,--his bravery was a necessary part of a firm and balanced manhood--the bravery of Hector, not Achilles. Constitutionally averse to bloodshed, be could seem timid where daring only gratified a wanton vanity, or aimed at a selfish object.  On the other hand, if duty demanded daring, no danger could deter, no policy warp him;--he could seem rash; he could even seem merciless.  In the what ought to be, he understood a must be.  And it was natural to this peculiar, yet thoroughly English temperament, to be, in action, rather steadfast and patient than quick and ready.  Placed in perils familiar to him, nothing could exceed his vigour and address; but if taken unawares, and before his judgment could come to his aid, he was liable to be surprised into error. Large minds are rarely quick, unless they have been corrupted into unnatural vigilance by the necessities of suspicion.  But a nature more thoroughly unsuspecting, more frank, trustful, and genuinely loyal than that young Earl's, it was impossible to conceive.  All these attributes considered, we have the key to much of Harold's character and conduct in the later events of his fated and tragic life.  But with this temperament, so manly and simple, we are not to suppose that Harold, while rejecting the superstitions of one class, was so far beyond his time as to reject those of another.  No son of fortune, no man placing himself and the world in antagonism, can ever escape from some belief in the Invisible.  Caesar could ridicule and profane the mystic rites of Roman mythology, but he must still believe in his fortune, as in a god.  And Harold, in his very studies, seeing the freest and boldest minds of antiquity subjected to influences akin to those of his Saxon forefathers, felt less shame in yielding to them, vain as they might be, than in monkish impostures so easily detected. Though hitherto he had rejected all direct appeal to the magic devices of Hilda, the sound of her dark sayings, heard in childhood, still vibrated on his soul as man.  Belief in omens, in days lucky or unlucky, in the stars, was universal in every class of the Saxon. Harold had his own fortunate day, the day of his nativity, the 14th of October.  All enterprises undertaken on that day had hitherto been successful.  He believed in the virtue of that day, as Cromwell believed in his 3d of September.  For the rest, we have described him as he was in that part of his career in which he is now presented. Whether altered by fate and circumstances, time will show.  As yet, no selfish ambition leagued with the natural desire of youth and intellect for their fair share of fame and power.  His patriotism, fed by the example of Greek and Roman worthies, was genuine, pure, and ardent; he could have stood in the pass with Leonidas, or leaped into the gulf with Curtius.     CHAPTER II.   At dawn, Harold woke from uneasy and broken slumbers, and his eyes fell upon the face of Hilda, large, and fair, and unutterably calm, as the face of Egyptian sphinx.  \"Have thy dreams been prophetic, son of Godwin?\" said the Vala.  \"Our Lord forfend,\" replied the Earl, with unusual devoutness.  \"Tell them, and let me read the rede; sense dwells in the voices of the night.\"  Harold mused, and after a short pause, he said:  \"Methinks, Hilda, I can myself explain how those dreams came to haunt me.\"  Then raising himself on his elbow, he continued, while he fixed his clear penetrating eyes upon his hostess:  \"Tell me frankly, Hilda, didst thou not cause some light to shine on yonder knoll, by the mound and stone, within the temple of the Druids?\"  But if Harold had suspected himself to be the dupe of some imposture, the thought vanished when he saw the look of keen interest, even of awe, which Hilda's face instantly assumed.  \"Didst thou see a light, son of Godwin, by the altar of Thor, and over the bautastein of the mighty dead? a flame, lambent and livid, like moonbeams collected over snow?\"  \"So seemed to me the light.\"  \"No human hand ever kindled that flame, which announces the presence of the Dead,\" said Hilda, with a tremulous voice; \"though seldom, uncompelled by the seid and the rune, does the spectre itself warn the eyes of the living.\"  \"What shape, or what shadow of shape, does that spectre assume?\"  \"It rises in the midst of the flame, pale as the mist on the mountain, and vast as the giants of old; with the saex, and the spear, and the shield, of the sons of Woden.--Thou hast seen the Scin-laeca,\" continued Hilda, looking full on the face of the Earl.  \"If thou deceivest me not,\" began Harold, doubting still.  \"Deceive thee! not to save the crown of the Saxon dare I mock the might of the dead.  Knowest thou not--or hath thy vain lore stood in place of the lore of thy fathers--that where a hero of old is buried, his treasures lie in his grave; that over that grave is at times seen at night the flame that thou sawest, and the dead in his image of air? Oft seen in the days that are gone, when the dead and the living had one faith--were one race; now never marked, but for portent, and prophecy, and doom:--glory or woe to the eyes that see!  On yon knoll, Aesc (the first-born of Cerdic, that Father-King of the Saxons,) has his grave where the mound rises green, and the stone gleams wan by the altar of Thor.  He smote the Britons in their temple, and he fell smiting.  They buried him in his arms, and with the treasures his right hand had won.  Fate hangs on the house of Cerdic, or the realm of the Saxon, when Woden calls the laeca of his son from the grave.\"  Hilda, much troubled bent her face over her clasped hands, and, rocking to and fro, muttered some runes unintelligible to the ear of her listener.  Then she turned to him, commandingly, and said:  \"Thy dreams now, indeed, are oracles, more true than living Vala could charm with the wand and the rune: Unfold them.\"  Thus adjured, Harold resumed:  \"Methought, then, that I was on a broad, level plain, in the noon of day; all was clear to my eye, and glad to my heart.  I was alone and went on my way rejoicing.  Suddenly the earth opened under my feet, and I fell deep, fathom-deep;--deep, as if to that central pit, which our heathen sires called Niffelheim--the Home of Vapour--the hell of the dead who die without glory.  Stunned by the fall, I lay long, locked as in a dream in the midst of a dream.  When I opened my eyes, behold, I was girt round with dead men's bones; and the bones moved round me, undulating, as the dry leaves that wirble round in the winds of the winter.  And from midst of them peered a trunkless skull, and on the skull was a mitre, and from the yawning jaws a voice came hissing, as a serpent's hiss, 'Harold, the scorner, thou art ours!' Then, as from the buzz of an army, came voices multitudinous, 'Thou art ours!'  I sought to rise, and behold my limbs were bound, and the gyves were fine and frail, as the web of the gossamer, and they weighed on me like chains of iron.  And I felt an anguish of soul that no words can speak--an anguish both of horror and shame; and my manhood seemed to ooze from me, and I was weak as a child new born. Then suddenly there rushed forth a freezing wind, as from an air of ice, and the bones from their whirl stood still, and the buzz ceased, and the mitred skull grinned on me still and voiceless; and serpents darted their arrowy tongues from the eyeless sockets.  And, lo, before me stood (O Hilda, I see it now!) the form of the spectre that had risen from yonder knoll.  With his spear, and saex, and his shield, he stood before me; and his face, though pale as that of one long dead, was stern as the face of a warrior in the van of armed men; he stretched his hand, and he smote his saex on his shield, and the clang sounded hollow; the gyves broke at the clash--I sprang to my feet, and I stood side by side with the phantom, dauntless.  Then,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7675"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 04 (#2)"],["body","uddenly, the mitre on the skull changed to a helm; and where the skull had grinned, trunkless and harmless, stood a shape like War, made incarnate;--a Thing above giants, with its crest to the stars and its form an eclipse between the sun and the day.  The earth changed to ocean, and the ocean was blood, and the ocean seemed deep as the seas where the whales sport in the North, but the surge rose not to the knee of that measureless image.  And the ravens came round it from all parts of the heaven, and the vultures with the dead eyes and dull scream.  And all the bones, before scattered and shapeless, sprung to life and to form, some monks and some warriors; and there was a hoot, and a hiss, and a roar, and the storm of arms.  And a broad pennon rose out of the sea of blood, and from the clouds came a pale hand, and it wrote on the pennon, 'Harold, the Accursed!'  Then said the stern shape by my side, 'Harold, fearest thou the dead men's bones?' and its voice was as a trumpet that gives strength to the craven, and I answering, 'Niddering, indeed, were Harold, to fear the bones of the dead!'\"  \"As I spoke, as if hell had burst loose, came a gibber of scorn, and all vanished at once, save the ocean of blood.  Slowly came from the north, over the sea, a bird like a raven, save that it was blood- red, like the ocean; and there came from the south, swimming towards me, a lion.  And I looked to the spectre; and the pride of war had gone from its face, which was so sad that methought I forgot raven and lion, and wept to see it.  Then the spectre took me in its vast arms, and its breath froze my veins, and it kissed my brow and my lips, and said, gently and fondly, as my mother in some childish sickness, 'Harold, my best beloved, mourn not.  Thou hast all which the sons of Woden dreamed in their dreams of Valhalla!'  Thus saying, the form receded slowly, slowly, still gazing on me with its sad eyes.  I stretched forth my hand to detain it, and in my grasp was a shadowy sceptre.  And, lo! round me, as if from the earth, sprang up thegns and chiefs, in their armour; and a board was spread, and a wassail was blithe around me.  So my heart felt cheered and light, and in my hand was still the sceptre.  And we feasted long and merrily; but over the feast flapped the wings of the blood-red raven, and over the blood-red sea beyond, swam the lion, near and near.  And in the heavens there were two stars, one pale and steadfast, the other rushing and luminous; and a shadowy hand pointed from the cloud to the pale star, and a voice said, 'Lo, Harold! the star that shone on thy birth.'  And another hand pointed to the luminous star, and another voice said, 'Lo, the star that shone on the birth of the victor.'  Then, lo! the bright star grew fiercer and larger; and, rolling on with a hissing sound, as when iron is dipped into water, it rushed over the disc of the mournful planet, and the whole heavens seemed on fire.  So methought the dream faded away, and in fading, I heard a full swell of music, as the swell of an anthem in an aisle; a music like that which but once in my life I heard; when I stood on the train of Edward, in the halls of Winchester, the day they crowned him king.\"  Harold ceased, and the Vala slowly lifted her head from her bosom, and surveyed him in profound silence, and with a gaze that seemed vacant and meaningless.  \"Why dost thou look on me thus, and why art thou so silent?\" asked the Earl.  \"The cloud is on my sight, and the burthen is on my soul, and I cannot read thy rede,\" murmured the Vala.  \"But morn, the ghost-chaser, that waketh life, the action, charms into slumber life, the thought.  As the stars pale at the rising of the sun, so fade the lights of the soul when the buds revive in the dews, and the lark sings to the day. In thy dream lies thy future, as the wing of the moth in the web of the changing worm; but, whether for weal or for woe, thou shalt burst through thy mesh, and spread thy plumes in the air.  Of myself I know nought.  Await the hour when Skulda shall pass into the soul of her servant, and thy fate shall rush from my lips as the rush of the waters from the heart of the cave.\"  \"I am content to abide,\" said Harold, with his wonted smile, so calm and so lofty; \"but I cannot promise thee that I shall heed thy rede, or obey thy warning, when my reason hath awoke, as while I speak it awakens, from the fumes of the fancy and the mists of the night.\"     CHAPTER III.   Githa, Earl Godwin's wife, sate in her chamber, and her heart was sad. In the room was one of her sons, the one dearer to her than all, Wolnoth, her darling.  For the rest of her sons were stalwart and strong of frame, and in their infancy she had known not a mother's fears.  But Wolnoth had come into the world before his time, and sharp had been the travail of the mother, and long between life and death the struggle of the newborn babe.  And his cradle had been rocked with a trembling knee, and his pillow been bathed with hot tears.  Frail had been his childhood--a thing that hung on her care; and now, as the boy grew, blooming and strong, into youth, the mother felt that she had given life twice to her child.  Therefore was he more dear to her than the rest; and, therefore, as she gazed upon him now, fair and smiling, and hopeful, she mourned for him more than for Sweyn, the outcast and criminal, on his pilgrimage of woe, to the waters of Jordan, and the tomb of our Lord.  For Wolnoth, selected as the hostage for the faith of his house, was to be sent from her arms to the Court of William the Norman.  And the youth smiled and was gay, choosing vestment and mantle, and ateghars of gold, that he might be flaunting and brave in the halls of knighthood and the beauty,--the school of the proudest chivalry of the Christian world.  Too young, and too thoughtless, to share the wise hate of his elders for the manners and forms of the foreigners, their gaiety and splendour, as his boyhood had seen them, relieving the gloom of the cloister court, and contrasting the spleen and the rudeness of the Saxon temperament, had dazzled his fancy and half Normanised his mind.  A proud and happy boy was he, to go as hostage for the faith, and representative of the rank, of his mighty kinsmen; and step into manhood in the eyes of the dames of Rouen.  By Wolnoth's side stood his young sister, Thyra, a mere infant; and her innocent sympathy with her brother's pleasure in gaud and toy saddened Githa yet more.  \"O my son!\" said the troubled mother, \"why, of all my children, have they chosen thee?  Harold is wise against danger, and Tostig is fierce against foes, and Gurth is too loving to awake hate in the sternest, and from the mirth of sunny Leofwine sorrow glints aside, as the shaft from the sheen of a shield.  But thou, thou, O beloved!--cursed be the king that chose thee, and cruel was the father that forgot the light of the mother's eyes!\"  \"Tut, mother the dearest,\" said Wolnoth, pausing from the contemplation of a silk robe, all covered with broidered peacocks, which had been sent him as a gift from his sister the Queen, and wrought with her own fair hands; for a notable needle-woman, despite her sage lere, was the wife of the Saint King, as sorrowful women mostly are,--\"Tut! the bird must leave the nest when the wings are fledged.  Harold the eagle, Tostig the kite, Gurth the ring-dove, and Leofwine the stare.  See, my wings are the richest of all, mother, and bright is the sun in which thy peacock shall spread his pranked plumes.\"  Then, observing that his liveliness provoked no smile from his mother, he approached and said more seriously:  \"Bethink thee, mother mine.  No other choice was left to king or to father.  Harold, and Tostig, and Leofwine, have their lordships and offices.  Their posts are fixed, and they stand as the columns of our house.  And Gurth is so young, and so Saxish and so the shadow of Harold, that his hate to the Norman is a by-word already among our youths; for hate is the more marked in a temper of love, as the blue of this border seems black against the white of the woof.  But I;--the good King knows that I shall be welcome, for the Norman knights love Wolnoth, and I have spent hours by the knees of Montgommeri and Grantmesnil, listening to the feats of Rolf-ganger, and playing with their gold chains of knighthood.  And the stout Count himself shall knight me, and I shall come back with the spurs of gold which thy ancestors, the brave Kings of Norway and Daneland, wore ere knighthood was known.  Come, kiss me, my mother, and come see the brave falcons Harold has sent me:--true Welch!\"  Githa rested her face on her son's shoulder, and her tears blinded her.  The door opened gently, and Harold entered; and with the Earl, a pale dark-haired boy, Haco; the son of Sweyn.  But Githa, absorbed in her darling Wolnoth, scarce saw the grandchild reared afar from her knees, and hurried at once to Harold.  In his presence she felt comfort and safety; for Wolnoth leant on her heart, and her heart leant on Harold.  \"O son, son!\" she cried, \"firmest of hand, surest of faith, and wisest of brain, in the house of Godwin, tell me that he yonder, he thy young brother, risks no danger in the halls of the Normans!\"  \"Not more than in these, mother,\" answered Harold, soothing her, with caressing lip and gentle tone.  \"Fierce and ruthless, men say, is William the Duke against foes with their swords in their hands, but debonnair and mild to the gentle [105], frank host and kind lord.  And these Normans have a code of their own, more grave than all morals, more binding than even their fanatic religion.  Thou knowest it well, mother, for it comes from thy race of the North, and this code of honour, they call it, makes Wolnoth's head as sacred as the relics of a saint set in zimmes.  Ask only, my brother, when thou comest in sight of the Norman Duke, ask only 'the kiss of peace,' and, that kiss on thy brow, thou wilt sleep more safe than if "]]]
