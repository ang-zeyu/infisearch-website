Louvier is no relation of that well-born _vaurien_; why should he summon your family council?\"  \"Louvier excused his interference on the ground of early and intimate friendship with De Mauleon, who, he said, came to consult him on arriving at Paris, and who felt too proud or too timid to address relations with whom he had long dropped all intercourse.  An intermediary was required, and Louvier volunteered to take that part on himself; nothing more natural nor more simple.  By the way, Alain, you dine with Louvier to-morrow, do you not?--a dinner in honour of our rehabilitated kinsman. I and Raoul go.\"  \"Yes, I shall be charmed to meet again a man who, whatever might be his errors in youth, on which,\" added Alain, slightly colouring, \"it certainly does not become me to be severe, must have suffered the most poignant anguish a man of honour can undergo,--namely, honour suspected; and who now, whether by years or sorrow, is so changed that I cannot recognize a likeness to the character I have just heard given to him as _mauvais sujet_ and _vaurien_.\"  \"Bravo!\" cried Enguerrand; \"all honour to courage!--and at Paris it requires great courage to defend the absent.\"  \"Nay,\" answered Alain, in a low voice.  \"The _gentilhomme_ who will not defend another _gentilhomme_ traduced, would, as a soldier, betray a citadel and desert a flag.\"  \"You say M. de Mauleon is changed,\" said De Breze; \"yes, he must be growing old.  No trace left of his good looks?\"  \"Pardon me,\" said Enguerrand; \"he is _bien conserve_, and has still a very handsome head and an imposing presence.  But one cannot help doubting whether he deserved the formidable reputation he acquired in youth; his manner is so singularly mild and gentle, his conversation so winningly modest, so void of pretence, and his mode of life is as simple as that of a Spanish hidalgo.\"  \"He does not, then, affect the role of Monte Cristo,\" said Duplessis, \"and buy himself into notice like that hero of romance?\"  \"Certainly not: he says very frankly that he has but a very small income, but more than enough for his wants,--richer than in his youth, for he has learned content.  We may dismiss the hint in 'Le Sens Commun' about his future political career,--at least he evinces no such ambition.\"  \"How could he as a Legitimist?\" said Alain, bitterly.  \"What department would elect him?\"  \"But is he a Legitimist?\" asked De Breze.  \"I take it for granted that he must be that,\" answered Alain, haughtily, \"for he is a De Mauleon.\"  \"His father was as good a De Mauleon as himself, I presume,\" rejoined De Breze, dryly; \"and he enjoyed a place at the Court of Louis Philippe, which a Legitimist could scarcely accept.  Victor did not, I fancy, trouble his head about politics at all, at the time I remember him; but to judge by his chief associates, and the notice he received from the Princes of the House of Orleans, I should guess that he had no predilections in favour of Henri V.\"  \"I should regret to think so,\" said Alain, yet more haughtily, \"since the De Mauleons acknowledge the head of their house in the representative of the Rochebriants.\"  \"At all events,\" said Duplessis, \"M. de Mauleon appears to be a philosopher of rare stamp.  A Parisian who has known riches and is contented to be poor is a phenomenon I should like to study.\"  \"You have that chance to-morrow evening, Monsieur Duplessis,\" said Enguerrand.  \"What! at M. Louvier's dinner?  Nay, I have no other acquaintance with M. Louvier than that of the Bourse, and the acquaintance is not cordial.\"  \"I did not mean at M. Louvier's dinner, but at the Duchesse de Tarascon's ball.  You, as one of her special favourites, will doubtless honour her _reunion_.\"  \"Yes; I have promised my daughter to go to the ball.  But the Duchesse is Imperialist.  M. de Mauleon seems to be either a Legitimist, according to Monsieur le Marquis, or an Orleanist, according to our friend De Breze.\"  \"What of that?  Can there be a more loyal Bourbonite than De Rochebriant?--and he goes to the ball.  It is given out of the season, in celebration of a family marriage.  And the Duchesse de Tarascon is connected with Alain, and therefore with De Mauleon, though but distantly.\"  \"Ah! excuse my ignorance of genealogy.\"  \"As if the genealogy of noble names were not the history of France,\" muttered Alain, indignantly.     CHAPTER II.  Yes, the \"Sens Commun\" was a success: it had made a sensation at starting; the sensation was on the increase.  It is difficult for an Englishman to comprehend the full influence of a successful journal at Paris; the station--political, literary, social--which it confers on the contributors who effect the success.  M. Lebeau had shown much more sagacity in selecting Gustave Rameau for the nominal editor than Savarin supposed or my reader might detect.  In the first place, Gustave himself, with all his defects of information and solidity of intellect, was not without real genius,--and a sort of genius that when kept in restraint, and its field confined to sentiment or sarcasm, was in unison with the temper of the day; in the second place, it was only through Gustave that Lebeau could have got at Savarin, and the names which that brilliant writer had secured at the outset would have sufficed to draw attention to the earliest numbers of the \"Sens Commun,\" despite a title which did not seem alluring.  But these names alone could not have sufficed to circulate the new journal to the extent it had already reached.  This was due to the curiosity excited by leading articles of a style new to the Parisian public, and of which the authorship defied conjecture.  They were signed Pierre Firmin,--supposed to be a _nom de plume_, as, that name was utterly unknown in the world of letters.  They affected the tone of an impartial observer; they neither espoused nor attacked any particular party; they laid down no abstract doctrines of government. But somehow or other, in language terse yet familiar, sometimes careless yet never vulgar, they expressed a prevailing sentiment of uneasy discontent, a foreboding of some destined change in things established, without defining the nature of such change, without saying whether it would be for good or for evil.  In his criticisms upon individuals, the writer was guarded and moderate--the keenest-eyed censor of the press could not have found a pretext for interference with expression of opinions so polite.  Of the Emperor these articles spoke little, but that little was not disrespectful; yet, day after day, the articles contributed to sap the Empire.  All malcontents of every shade comprehended, as by a secret of freemasonry, that in this journal they had an ally.  Against religion not a word was uttered, yet the enemies of religion bought that journal; still, the friends of religion bought it too, for those articles treated with irony the philosophers on paper who thought that their contradictory crotchets could fuse themselves into any single Utopia, or that any social edifice, hurriedly run up by the crazy few, could become a permanent habitation for the turbulent many, without the clamps of a creed.  The tone of these articles always corresponded with the title of the journal,--\"Common-sense.\"  It was to common-sense that it appealed,-- appealed in the utterance of a man who disdained the subtle theories, the vehement declamation, the credulous beliefs, or the inflated bombast, which constitute so large a portion of the Parisian press.  The articles rather resembled certain organs of the English press, which profess to be blinded by no enthusiasm for anybody or anything, which find their sale in that sympathy with ill-nature to which Huet ascribes the popularity of Tacitus, and, always quietly undermining institutions with a covert sneer, never pretend to a spirit of imagination so at variance with common-sense as a conjecture how the institutions should be rebuilt or replaced.  Well, somehow or other the journal, as I was saying, hit the taste of the Parisian public.  It intimated, with the easy grace of an unpremeditated agreeable talker, that French society in all its classes was rotten; and each class was willing to believe that all the others were rotten, and agreed that unless the others were reformed, there was something very unsound in itself.  The ball at the Duchesse de Tarascon's was a brilliant event.  The summer was far advanced; many of the Parisian holiday-makers had returned to the capital, but the season had not commenced, and a ball at that time of year was a very unwonted event.  But there was a special occasion for this fete,--a marriage between a niece of the Duchesse and the son of a great official in high favour at the Imperial Court.  The dinner at Louvier's broke up early, and the music for the second waltz was sounding when Enguerrand, Alain, and the Vicomte de Mauleon ascended the stairs.  Raoul did not accompany them; he went very rarely to any balls,--never to one given by an Imperialist, however nearly related to him the Imperialist might be.  But in the sweet indulgence of his good-nature, he had no blame for those who did go,--not for Enguerrand, still less, of course, for Alain.  Something too might well here be said as to his feeling towards Victor de Mauleon.  He had joined in the family acquittal of that kinsman as to the grave charge of the jewels; the proofs of innocence thereon seemed to him unequivocal and decisive, therefore he had called on the Vicomte and acquiesced in all formal civilities shown to him.  But such acts of justice to a fellow-gentilhomme and a kinsman duly performed, he desired to see as little as possible of the Vicomte de Mauleon.  He reasoned thus: \"Of every charge which society made against this man he is guiltless; but of all the claims to admiration which society accorded to him before it erroneously condemned, there are none which make me covet his friendship, or suffice to dispel doubts as to what he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7742"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 06 (#2)"],["body","be when society once more receives him.  And the man is so captivating that I should dread his influence over myself did I see much of him.\"  Raoul kept his reasonings to himself, for he had that sort of charity which indisposes an amiable man to be severe on bygone offences.  In the eyes of Enguerrand and Alain, and such young votaries of the mode as they could influence, Victor de Mauleon assumed almost heroic proportions.  In the affair which had inflicted on him a calumny so odious, it was clear that he had acted with chivalrous delicacy of honour.  And the turbulence and recklessness of his earlier years, redeemed as they were, in the traditions of his contemporaries, by courage and generosity, were not offences to which young Frenchmen are inclined to be harsh.  All question as to the mode in which his life might have been passed during his long absence from the capital was merged in the respect due to the only facts known, and these were clearly proved in his pieces justificatives: First, that he had served under another name in the ranks of the army in Algiers; had distinguished himself there for signal valour, and received, with promotion, the decoration of the cross.  His real name was known only to his colonel, and on quitting the service, the colonel placed in his hands a letter of warm eulogy on his conduct, and identifying him as Victor de Mauleon.  Secondly, that in California he had saved a wealthy family from midnight murder, fighting single-handed against and overmastering three ruffians, and declining all other reward from those he had preserved than a written attestation of their gratitude.  In all countries, valour ranks high in the list of virtues; in no country does it so absolve from vices as it does in France.  But as yet Victor de Mauleon's vindication was only known by a few, and those belonging to the gayer circles of life.  How he might be judged by the sober middle class, which constitutes the most important section of public opinion to a candidate for political trusts and distinctions, was another question.  The Duchesse stood at the door to receive her visitors.  Duplessis was seated near the entrance, by the side of a distinguished member of the Imperial Government, with whom he was carrying on a whispered conversation.  The eye of the financier, however, turned towards the doorway as Alain and Enguerrand entered, and passing over their familiar faces, fixed itself attentively on that of a mach older man whom Enguerrand was presenting to the Duchesse, and in whom Duplessis rightly divined the Vicomte de Mauleon.  Certainly if no one could have recognized M. Lebeau in the stately personage who had visited Louvier, still less could one who had heard of the wild feats of the _roi des viveurs_ in his youth reconcile belief in such tales with the quiet modesty of mien which distinguished the cavalier now replying, with bended head and subdued accents, to the courteous welcome of the brilliant hostess.  But for such difference in attributes between the past and the present De Mauleon, Duplessis had been prepared by the conversation at the Maison Doree.  And now, as the Vicomte, yielding his place by the Duchesse to some new-comer, glided on, and, leaning against a column, contemplated the gay scene before him with that expression of countenance, half sarcastic, half mournful, with which men regard, after long estrangement, the scenes of departed joys, Duplessis felt that no change in that man had impaired the force of character which had made him the hero of reckless coevals.  Though wearing no beard, not even a mustache, there was something emphatically masculine in the contour of the close-shaven cheek and resolute jaw; in a forehead broad at the temples, and protuberant in those organs over the eyebrows which are said to be significant of quick perception and ready action; in the lips, when in repose compressed, perhaps somewhat stern in their expression, but pliant and mobile when speaking, and wonderfully fascinating when they smiled.  Altogether, about this Victor de Mauleon there was a nameless distinction, apart from that of conventional elegance.  You would have said, \"That is a man of some marked individuality, an eminence of some kind in himself.\"  You would not be surprised to hear that he was a party-leader, a skilled diplomatist, a daring soldier, an adventurous traveller; but you would not guess him to be a student, an author, an artist.  While Duplessis thus observed the Vicomte de Mauleon, all the while seeming to lend an attentive ear to the whispered voice of the Minister by his side, Alain passed on into the ball-room.  He was fresh enough to feel the exhilaration of the dance.  Enguerrand (who had survived that excitement, and who habitually deserted any assembly at an early hour for the cigar and whist of his club) had made his way to De Mauleon, and there stationed himself.  The lion of one generation has always a mixed feeling of curiosity and respect for the lion of a generation before him, and the young Vandemar had conceived a strong and almost an affectionate interest in this discrowned king of that realm in fashion which, once lost, is never to be regained; for it is only Youth that can hold its sceptre and command its subjects.  \"In this crowd, Vicomte,\" said Enguerrand, \"there must be many old acquaintances of yours?\"  \"Perhaps so, but as yet I have only seen new faces.\"  As he thus spoke, a middle-aged man, decorated with the grand cross of the Legion and half-a-dozen foreign orders, lending his arm to a lady of the same age radiant in diamonds, passed by towards the ball-room, and in some sudden swerve of his person, occasioned by a pause of his companion to adjust her train, he accidentally brushed against De Mauleon, whom he had not before noticed.  Turning round to apologize for his awkwardness, he encountered the full gaze of the Vicomte, started, changed countenance, and hurried on his companion.  \"Do you not recognize his Excellency?\" said Enguerrand, smiling.  \"His cannot be a new face to you.\"  \"Is it the Baron de Lacy?\" asked De Mauleon.  \"The Baron de Lacy, now Comte d'Epinay, ambassador at the Court of -----, and, if report speak true, likely soon to exchange that post for the _porte feuille_ of Minister.\"  \"He has got on in life since I saw him last, the little Baron.  He was then my devoted imitator, and I was not proud of the imitation.\"  \"He has got on by always clinging to the skirts of some one stronger than himself,--to yours, I dare say, when, being a _parvenu_ despite his usurped title of baron, he aspired to the entree into clubs and salons. The entree thus obtained, the rest followed easily; he became a millionaire through a wife's dot, and an ambassador through the wife's lover, who is a power in the State.\"  \"But he must have substance in himself.  Empty bags can not be made to stand upright.  Ah!  unless I mistake, I see some one I knew better.  Yon pale, thin man, also with the grand cross--surely that is Alfred Hennequin.  Is he too a decorated Imperialist?  I left him a socialistic Republican.\"  \"But, I presume, even then an eloquent avocat.  He got into the Chamber, spoke well, defended the _coup-d'etat_.  He has just been made _Prefet_ of the great department of the a popular appointment.  He bears a high character.  Pray renew your acquaintance with him; he is coming this way.\"  \"Will so grave a dignitary renew acquaintance with me?  I doubt it.\"  But as De Mauleon said this, he moved from the column, and advanced towards the Prefet.  Enguerrand followed him, and saw the Vicomte extend his hand to his old acquaintance.  The Prefet stared, and said, with frigid courtesy, \"Pardon me,--some mistake.\"  \"Allow me, Monsieur Hennequin,\" said Enguerrand, interposing, and wishing good-naturedly to save De Mauleon the awkwardness of introducing himself,--\"allow me to reintroduce you to my kinsman, whom the lapse of years may well excuse you for forgetting, the Vicomte de Mauleon.\"  Still the Prefet did not accept the hand.  He bowed with formal ceremony, said, \"I was not aware that Monsieur le Vicomte had returned to Paris,\" and moving to the doorway, made his salutation to the hostess and disappeared.  \"The insolent!\" muttered Enguerrand.  \"Hush!\" said De Mauleon, quietly, \"I can fight no more duels,--especially with a Prefet.  But I own I am weak enough to feel hurt at such a reception from Hennequin, for he owed me some obligations,--small, perhaps, but still they were such as might have made me select him, rather than Louvier, as the vindicator of my name, had I known him to be so high placed.  But a man who has raised himself into an authority may well be excused for forgetting a friend whose character needs defence. I forgive him.\"  There was something pathetic in the Vicomte's tone which touched Enguerrand's warm if light heart.  But De Mauleon did not allow him time to answer.  He went on quickly through an opening in the gay crowd, which immediately closed behind him, and Enguerrand saw him no more that evening.  Duplessis ere this had quitted his seat by the Minister, drawn thence by a young and very pretty girl resigned to his charge by a cavalier with whom she had been dancing.  She was the only daughter of Duplessis, and he valued her even more than the millions he had made at the Bourse. \"The Princess,\" she said, \"has been swept off in the train of some German Royalty; so, _petit pere_, I must impose myself on thee.\"  The Princess, a Russian of high rank, was the _chaperon_ that evening of Mademoiselle Valerie Duplessis.  \"And I suppose I must take thee back into the ballroom,\" said the financier, smiling proudly, \"and find thee partners.\"  \"I don't want your aid for that, Monsieur; except this quadrille, my list is pretty well filled up.\"  \"And I hope the partners will be pleasant.  Let me know who they are,\" he whispered, as they threaded their way into the ball-room.  The girl glanced at her tablet.  \"Well,"]]]
