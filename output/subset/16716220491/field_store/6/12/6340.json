Now, between you and me, mister, what did she lend you on that bit o' stuff?\"  \"Three pounds fifteen,\" replied Lauriston.  \"That's about it,\" assented Melky, with a nod. He leaned a little nearer. \"You don't want to sell the ticket?\" he suggested. \"Give you a couple o' quid for it, if you do.\"  \"You seem very anxious to buy that watch,\" said Lauriston, laughing. \"No--I don't want to sell the ticket--not I! I wouldn't part with that watch for worlds.\"  \"Well, if you don't, you don't,\" remarked Melky. \"And as to wanting to buy--that's my trade. I ain't no reg'lar business--I buy and sell, anything that comes handy, in the gold and silver line. And as you ain't going to part with that ticket on no consideration, I'll tell you what it's worth, old as it is. Fifteen quid!\"  \"That's worth knowing, any way,\" said Lauriston. \"I shall always have something by me then, while I have that. You'd have made a profit of a nice bit, then, if I'd sold it to you?\"  \"It 'ud be a poor world, mister, if you didn't get no profit, wouldn't it?\" assented Melky calmly. \"We're all of us out to make profit. Look here!--between you and me--you're a lit'ry gent, ain't you? Write a bit, what? Do you want to earn a fiver--comfortable?\"  \"I should be very glad,\" replied Lauriston.  \"There's a friend o' mine,\" continued Melky, \"wholesale jeweller, down Shoreditch way, wants to get out a catalogue. He ain't no lit'ry powers, d'you see? Now, he'd run to a fiver--cash down--if some writing feller 'ud touch things up a bit for him, like. Lor' bless you!--it wouldn't take you more'n a day's work! What d'ye say to it?\"  \"I wouldn't mind earning five pounds at that,\" answered Lauriston.  \"Right-oh!\" said Melky. \"Then some day next week, I'll take you down to see him--he's away till then. And--you'll pay me ten per cent. on the bit o' business, won't you, mister? Business is business, ain't it?\"  \"All right!\" agreed Lauriston. \"That's a bargain, of course.\"  Melky nodded and turned to his steak, and Lauriston presently left him and went away. The plump lady at the desk gave him a smile as she handed him his change.  \"Hope to see you again, sir,\" she said.  Lauriston went back to his room, feeling that the world had changed. He had paid his landlady, he had silver and copper in his pocket, he had the chance of earning five pounds during the coming week--and he expected a cheque for his two stories by every post. And if John Purdie made him the loan he had asked for, he would be able to devote a whole month to finishing his novel--and then, perhaps, there would be fame and riches. The dismal November evening disappeared in a dream of hope.  But by the end of the week hope was dropping to zero again with Lauriston. No letters had arrived--either from John Purdie or the editor. On the Sunday morning he was again face to face with the last half-crown. He laid out his money very cautiously that day, but when he had paid for a frugal dinner at a cheap coffee-shop, he had only a shilling left. He wandered into Kensington Gardens that Sunday afternoon, wondering what he had best do next. And as he stood by the railings of the ornamental water, watching the water-fowls' doings, somebody bade him good-day, and he turned to find the pretty girl of the pawnshop standing at his side and smiling shyly at him.    CHAPTER THREE   THE DEAD MAN  Lauriston was thinking about Zillah at the very moment in which she spoke to him: the memory of her dark eyes and the friendly smile that she had given him as he left the pawnshop had come as a relief in the midst of his speculations as to his immediate future. And now, as he saw her real self, close to him, evidently disposed to be friendly, he blushed like any girl, being yet at that age when shyness was still a part of his character. Zillah blushed too--but she was more self-possessed than Lauriston.  \"I've been talking to my Cousin Melky about you,\" she said quickly. \"Or, rather, he's been talking to me. He says he's going to introduce you to a man who wants his catalogue put in shape--for five pounds. Don't you do it for five pounds! I know that man--charge him ten!\"  Lauriston moved away with her down the walk.  \"Oh, but I couldn't do that, now!\" he said eagerly. \"You see I promised I'd do it for five.\"  Zillah gave him a quick glance.  \"Don't you be silly!\" she said. \"When anybody like Melky offers you five pounds for anything, ask them double. They'll give it. You don't know much about money matters, do you?\"  Lauriston laughed, and gaining confidence, gave the girl a knowing look.  \"Not much,\" he admitted, \"else I wouldn't have had to do that bit of business with you the other day.\"  \"Oh--that!\" she said indifferently. \"That's nothing. You'd be astonished if you knew what sort of people just have to run round to us, now and then--I could tell you some secrets! But--I guessed you weren't very well up in money matters, all the same. Writing people seldom are.\"  \"I suppose you are?\" suggested Lauriston.  \"I've been mixed up in them all my life, more or less,\" she answered. \"Couldn't help being, with my surroundings. You won't think me inquisitive if I ask you something? Were you--hard up--when you came round the other night?\"  \"Hard up's a mild term,\" replied Lauriston, frankly. \"I hadn't a penny!\"  \"Excepting a gold watch worth twelve or fifteen pounds,\" remarked Zillah, drily. \"And how long had you been like that?\"  \"Two or three days--more or less,\" answered Lauriston. \"You see, I've been expecting money for more than a week--that was it.\"  \"Has it come?\" she asked.  \"No--it hasn't,\" he replied, with a candid blush. \"That's a fact!\"  \"Will it come--soon?\" she demanded.  \"By George!--I hope so!\" he exclaimed. \"I'll be hard up again, if it doesn't.\"  \"And then you offer to do for five what you might easily get ten for!\" she said, almost reproachfully. \"Let me give you a bit of advice--never accept a first offer. Stand out for a bit more--especially from anybody like my cousin Melky.\"  \"Is Melky a keen one, then?\" enquired Lauriston.  \"Melky's a young Jew,\" said Zillah, calmly. \"I'm not--I'm half-and-half--a mixture. My mother was Jew--my father wasn't. Well--if you want money to be going on with, and you've got any more gold watches, you know where to come. Don't you ever go with empty pockets in London while you've got a bit of property to pledge! You're not a Londoner, of course?\"  \"I'm a Scotsman!\" said Lauriston.  \"To be sure--I knew it by your tongue,\" asserted Zillah. \"And trying to make a living by writing! Well, you'll want courage--and money. Have you had any luck?\"  \"I've sold two stories,\" answered Lauriston, who by that time was feeling as if the girl was an old friend. \"They come to twenty pounds for the two, at the rate that magazine pays, and I've asked for a cheque--it's that I'm waiting for. It ought to come--any time.\"  \"Oh, but I know that game!\" said Zillah. \"I've two friends--girls--who write. I know how they have to wait--till publication, or till next pay-day. What a pity that some of you writers don't follow some other profession that would bring in a good income--then you could do your writing to please yourselves, and not be dependent on it. Haven't you thought of that?\"  \"Often!\" answered Lauriston. \"And it wouldn't do--for me, anyway. I've made my choice. I'll stick to my pen--and swim or sink with it. And I'm not going to sink!\"  \"That's the way to talk--to be sure!\" said the girl. \"But--keep yourself in money, if you can. Don't go without money for three days when you've anything you can raise money on. You see how practical I am! But you've got to be in this world. Will you tell me something?\"  \"It strikes me,\" answered Lauriston, looking at her narrowly and bringing the colour to her cheeks, \"that I'm just about getting to this--that I'd tell you anything! And so--what is it?\"  \"How much money have you left?\" she asked softly.  \"Precisely a shilling--and a copper or two,\" he answered.  \"And--if that cheque doesn't arrive?\" she suggested.  \"Maybe I'll be walking round to Praed Street again,\" he said, laughing. \"I've a bit of what you call property, yet.\"  The girl nodded, and turned towards a side-walk that led across the Gardens.  \"All right,\" she said. \"Don't think me inquisitive--I don't like to think of--of people like you being hard up: I'm not wrapped up in business as much as all that. Let's talk of something else--tell me what you write about.\"  Lauriston spent the rest of that afternoon with Zillah, strolling about Kensington Gardens. He had lived a very lonely life since coming to London, and it was a new and pleasant experience to him to have an intelligent companion to talk to. There was a decided sense of exhilaration within him when he finally left her; as for Zillah, she went homewards in a very thoughtful mood, already conscious that she was more than half in love with this good-looking lad who had come so strangely into her life. And at the corner of Praed Street she ran up against Mr. Melky Rubinstein, and button-holed him, and for ten minutes talked seriously to him. Melky, who had good reasons of his own for keeping in his cousin's favour, listened like a lamb to all she had to say, and went off promising implicit obedience to her commandments.  \"Zillah ain't half gone on that chap!\" mused Melky, as he pursued his way. \"Now, ain't it extraordinary that a girl who'll come into a perfect fortune should go and fall head over ears in love with a red-headed young feller what ain't got a penny to bless hisself with! Not but what he ain't got good looks--and brains. And brains is brains, when all's said!\"  That night, as Lauriston sat writing in his shabby little room, a knock came at his door--the door opened, and Melky slid in, laying his finger to the side of his large nose in token of confidence.  \"Hope I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9304"],["title","Initiation into Philosophy (#1)"],["body","rs. The fundamental and supreme reality is _one_; the being who is one is God; from this number, which is one, are derived all the other numbers which are the foundation of beings, their inward cause, their essence; we are all more or less perfect numbers; each created thing is a more or less perfect number. The world, governed thus by combinations of numbers, has always existed and will always exist. It develops itself, however, according to a numerical series of which we do not possess the key, but which we can guess. As for human destiny it is this: we have been animated beings, human or animal; according as we have lived well or ill we shall be reincarnated either as superior men or as animals more or less inferior. This is the doctrine of _metempsychosis_, which had many adherents in ancient days, and also in a more or less fanciful fashion in modern times.  To Pythagoras have been attributed a certain number of maxims which are called the _Golden Verses_.  XENOPHANES; PARMENIDES.--Xenophanes of Colophon is also a \"unitarian.\" He accepts only one God, and of all the ancient philosophers appears to be the most opposed to mythology, to belief in a multiplicity of gods resembling men, a doctrine which he despises as being immoral. There is one God, eternal, immutable, immovable, who has no need to transfer Himself from one locality to another, who is _without place_, and who governs all things by His thought alone.  Advancing further, Parmenides told himself that if He alone really exists who is one and eternal and unchangeable, all else is not only inferior to Him, but is only a _semblance_, and that mankind, earth, sky, plants, and animals are only a vast illusion--phantoms, a mirage, which would disappear, which would no longer exist, and _would never have existed_ if we could perceive the Self-existent.  ZENO; DEMOCRITUS.--Zeno of Elea, who must be mentioned more especially because he was the master of that Gorgias of whom Socrates was the adversary, was pre-eminently a subtle dialectician in whom the sophist already made his appearance, and who embarrassed the Athenians by captious arguments, at the bottom of which always could be found this fundamental principle: apart from the Eternal Being all is only semblance; apart from Him who is all, all is nothing.  Democritus of Abdera, disciple of Leucippus of Abdera (about whom nothing is known), is the inventor of the theory of atoms. Matter is composed of an infinite number of tiny indivisible bodies which are called atoms; these atoms from all eternity, or at least since the commencement of matter, have been endued with certain movements by which they attach themselves to one another, and agglomerate or separate, and thence is caused the formation of all things, and the destruction, which is only the disintegration, of all things. The soul itself is only an aggregation of specially tenuous and subtle atoms. It is probable that when a certain number of these atoms quit the body, sleep ensues; that when nearly all depart, it causes the appearance of death (lethargy, catalepsy); that when they all depart, death occurs. We are brought into relation with the external world by the advent in us of extremely subtle atoms--reflections of things, semblances of things--which enter and mingle with the constituent atoms of our souls. There is nothing in our intelligence which has not been brought there by our senses, and our intelligence is only the combination of the atoms composing our souls with the atoms that external matter sends, so to speak, into our souls. The doctrines of Democritus will be found again in those of Epicurus and Lucretius.    CHAPTER II  THE SOPHISTS   Logicians and Professors of Logic, and of the Analysis of Ideas, and of Discussion.   DOCTRINES OF THE SOPHISTS.--The Sophists descend from Parmenides and Zeno of Elea; Gorgias was the disciple of the latter. By dint of thinking that all is semblance save the Supreme Being, who alone is real, it is very easy to arrive at belief in all being semblance, including that Being; or at least what is almost tantamount, that all is semblance, inclusive of any idea we can possibly conceive of the Supreme Being. To believe nothing, and to demonstrate that there is no reason to believe in anything, is the cardinal principle of all the Sophists. Then, it may be suggested, there is nothing for it but to be silent. No, there is the cultivation of one's mind (the only thing of the existence of which we are sure), so as to give it ability, readiness, and strength. With what object? To become a dexterous thinker, which in itself is a fine thing; to be also a man of consideration, listened to in one's city, and to arrive at its government.  The Sophists accordingly gave lessons, especially in psychology, dialectics, and eloquence. They further taught philosophy, but in order to demonstrate that all philosophy is false; and, as Pascal observed later, that to ridicule philosophy is truly philosophical. They seem to have been extremely intellectual, very learned, and most serious despite their scepticism, and to have rendered Greece the very great service of making a penetrating analysis--the first recorded--of our faculty of knowledge and of the limitations, real, possible, or probable, of that faculty.  PROTAGORAS; GORGIAS; PRODICUS.--They were very numerous, the taste for their art, which might be called philosophical criticism, being widespread in Attica. It may be believed, as Plato maintains, that some were of very mediocre capacity, and this is natural; but there were also some who clearly were eminent authorities. The most illustrious were Protagoras, Gorgias, and Prodicus of Ceos. Protagoras seems to have been the most philosophical of them all, Gorgias the best orator and the chief professor of rhetoric, Prodicus the most eminent moralist and poet. Protagoras rejected all metaphysics--that is, all investigation of first causes and of the universe--and reduced all philosophy to the science of self-control with a view to happiness, and control of others with a view to their happiness. Like Anaxagoras, he was banished from the city under the charge of impiety, and his books were publicly burnt.  Gorgias appears to have maintained the same ideas with more moderation and also with less profundity. He claimed, above all, to be able to make a good orator. According to Plato, it was he whom Socrates most persistently made the butt of his sarcasms.  Prodicus, whom Plato himself esteemed, appears to have been principally preoccupied with the moral problem. He was the author of the famous apologue which represented Hercules having to choose between two paths, the one being that of virtue, the other of pleasure. Like Socrates later on, he too was subject to the terrible accusation of impiety, and underwent capital punishment. The Sophists furnish the most important epoch in the history of ancient philosophy; until their advent the philosophic systems were great poems on the total of all things, known and unknown. The Sophists opposed these ambitious and precipitate generalizations, in which imagination had the larger share, and their discovery was to bring philosophy back to its true starting point by affirming that the first thing to do, and that before all else, was to know our own mind and its mechanism. Their error possibly was, while saying that it was the first thing to do, too often to affirm that it was the only thing to do; still the fact remains that they were perfectly accurate in their assurance that it was primary.    CHAPTER III  SOCRATES   Philosophy Entirely Reduced to Morality, and Morality Considered as the End of all Intellectual Activity.   THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOCRATES.--Of Socrates nothing is known except that he was born at Athens, that he held many public discussions with all and sundry in the streets of Athens, and that he died under the Thirty Tyrants. Of his ideas we know nothing, because he wrote nothing, and because his disciples were far too intelligent; in consequence of which it is impossible to know if what they said was thought by him, had really been his ideas or theirs. What seems certain is that neither Aristophanes nor the judges at the trial of Socrates were completely deceived in considering him a Sophist; for he proceeded from them. It is true he proceeded from them by reaction, because evidently their universal scepticism had terrified him; but nevertheless he was their direct outcome, for like them he was extremely mistrustful of the old vast systems of philosophy, and to those men who pretended to know everything he opposed a phrase which is probably authentic: \"I know that I know nothing;\" for, like the Sophists, he wished to recall philosophy to earth from heaven, namely from metaphysics to the study of man, and nothing else; for, like the Sophists, he confined and limited the field with a kind of severe and imperious modesty which was none the less contemptuous of the audacious; for, finally, like the Sophists, but in this highly analogous to many philosophers preceding the Sophists, he had but a very moderate and mitigated respect for the religion of his fellow-citizens.  According to what we know of Socrates from Xenophon, unquestionably the least imaginative of his disciples, Socrates, like the Sophists, reduced philosophy to the study of man; but his great and incomparable originality lay in the fact that whereas the Sophists wished man to study himself in order to be happy, Socrates wished him to study himself in order to be moral, honest, and just, without any regard to happiness. For Socrates, everything had to tend towards morality, to contribute to it, and to be subordinated to it as the goal and as the final aim. He applied himself unceasingly, relates Xenophon, to examine and to determine what is good and evil, just and unjust, wise and foolish, brave and cowardly, etc. He incessantly applied himself, relates Aristotle--and therein he was as much a true professor"]]]
