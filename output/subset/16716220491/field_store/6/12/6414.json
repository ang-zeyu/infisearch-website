All the offspring of my parents were, in their infancy, uncommonly handsome, excepting myself. The boys were fair and lusty, with auburn hair, light blue eyes, and countenances peculiarly animated and lovely, I was swarthy; my eyes were singularly large in proportion to my face, which was small and round, exhibiting features peculiarly marked with the most pensive and melancholy cast.  The great difference betwixt my brothers and myself, in point of personal beauty, tended much to endear me to my parents, particularly to my father, whom I strongly resembled. The early propensities of my life were tinctured with romantic and singular characteristics; some of which I shall here mention, as proofs that the mind is never to be diverted from its original bent, and that every event of my life has more or less been marked by the progressive evils of a too acute sensibility.  The nursery in which I passed my hours of infancy was so near the great aisle of the minster that the organ, which reechoed its deep tones, accompanied by the chanting of the choristers, was distinctly heard both at morning and evening service. I remember with what pleasure I used to listen, and how much I was delighted whenever I was permitted to sit on the winding steps which led from the aisle to the cloisters. I can at this moment recall to memory the sensations I then experienced--the tones that seemed to thrill through my heart, the longing which I felt to unite my feeble voice to the full anthem, and the awful though sublime impression which the church service never failed to make upon my feelings. While my brothers were playing on the green before the minster, the servant who attended us has often, by my earnest entreaties, suffered me to remain beneath the great eagle which stood in the centre of the aisle, to support the book from which the clergyman read the lessons of the day; and nothing could keep me away, even in the coldest seasons, but the stern looks of an old man, whom I named Black John from the colour of his beard and complexion, and whose occupations within the sacred precincts were those of a bell-ringer and sexton.  As soon as I had learned to read, my great delight was that of learning epitaphs and monumental inscriptions. A story of melancholy import never failed to excite my attention; and before I was seven years old I could correctly repeat Pope's \"Lines to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady;\" Mason's \"Elegy on the Death of the Beautiful Countess of Coventry,\" and many smaller poems on similar subjects. I had then been attended two years by various masters. Mr. Edmund Broadrip taught me music, my father having presented me with one of Kirkman's finest harpsichords, as an incitement to emulation. Even there my natural bent of mind evinced itself. The only melody which pleased me was that of the mournful and touching kind. Two of my earliest favourites were the celebrated ballad by Gay, beginning, \"'Twas when the sea was roaring,\" and the simple pathetic stanzas of \"The Heavy Hours,\" by the poet Lord Lyttelton. These, though nature had given me but little voice, I could at seven years of age sing so pathetically that my mother, to the latest hour of her life,' never could bear to hear the latter of them repeated. They reminded her of sorrows in which I have since painfully learned to sympathise.  The early hours of boarding-school study I passed under the tuition of the Misses More, sisters to the lady of that name whose talents have been so often celebrated.[4] The education of their young pupils was undertaken by the five sisters. \"In my mind's eye,\" I see them now before me; while every circumstance of those early days is minutely and indelibly impressed upon my memory.  I remember the first time I ever was present at a dramatic representation: it was the benefit of that great actor[5] who was proceeding rapidly toward the highest paths of fame, when death, dropped the oblivious curtain, and closed the scene for ever. The part which he performed was King Lear; his wife, afterward Mrs. Fisher, played Cordelia, but not with sufficient _Ã©clat_ to render the profession an object for her future exertions. The whole school attended, Mr. Powel's two daughters being then pupils of the Misses More. Mrs. John Kemble, then Miss P. Hopkins, was also one of my schoolfellows, as was the daughter of Mrs. Palmer, formerly Miss Pritchard, and afterward Mrs. Lloyd. I mention these circumstances merely to prove that memory does not deceive me.  In my early days my father was prosperous, and my mother was the happiest of wives. She adored her children; she devoted her thoughts and divided her affections between them and the tenderest of husbands. Their spirits now, I trust, are in happier regions, blest, and reunited for ever.  If there could be found a fault in the conduct of my mother toward her children, it was that of a too unlimited indulgence, a too tender care, which but little served to arm their breast against the perpetual arrows of mortal vicissitude. My father's commercial concerns were crowned with prosperity. His house was opened by hospitality, and his generosity was only equalled by the liberality of fortune: every day augmented his successes; every hour seemed to increase his domestic felicity, till I attained my ninth year, when a change took place as sudden as it was unfortunate, at a moment when every luxury, every happiness, not only brightened the present, but gave promise of future felicity. A scheme was suggested to my father, as wild and romantic as it was perilous to hazard, which was no less than that of establishing a whale fishery on the coast of Labrador, and of civilising the Esquimaux Indians, in order to employ them in the extensive undertaking. During two years this eccentric plan occupied his thoughts by day, his dreams by night: all the smiles of prosperity could not tranquillise the restless spirit, and while he anticipated an acquirement of fame, he little considered the perils that would attend his fortune.  My mother (who, content with affluence and happy in beholding the prosperity of her children, trembled at the fear of endangering either), in vain endeavoured to dissuade my father from putting his favourite scheme in practice. In the early part of his youth he had been accustomed to a sea life, and, being born an American, his restless spirit was ever busied in plans for the increase of wealth and honour to his native country, whose fame and interest were then united to those of Britain. After many dreams of success and many conflicts betwixt prudence and ambition, he resolved on putting his scheme in practice; the potent witchery possessed his brain, and all the persuasive powers of reason shrunk before its magic.  Full of the important business, my misguided parent repaired to the metropolis, and on his arrival laid the plan before the late Earl of Hilsborough, Sir Hugh Palliser, the late Earl of Bristol, Lord Chatham (father to the present Mr. William Pitt), the chancellor Lord Northington, who was my godfather, and several other equally distinguished personages; who all not only approved the plan, but commended the laudable and public spirit which induced my father to suggest it. The prospect appeared full of promise, and the Labrador whale fishery was expected to be equally productive with that of Greenland. My parent's commercial connections were of the highest respectability, while his own name for worth and integrity gave a powerful sanction to the eccentric undertaking.  In order to facilitate this plan, my father deemed it absolutely necessary to reside at least two years in America. My mother, who felt an invincible antipathy to the sea, heard his determination with grief and horror. All the persuasive powers of affection failed to detain him; all the pleadings of reason, prudence, a fond wife, and an infant family, proved ineffectual. My father was determined on departing, and my mother's unconquerable timidity prevented her being the companion of his voyage. From this epocha I date the sorrows of my family.  He sailed for America. His eldest son, John, was previously placed in a mercantile house at Leghorn. My younger brothers and myself remained with my mother at Bristol. Two years was the limited time of his absence, and, on his departure, the sorrow of my parents was reciprocal. My mother's heart was almost bursting with anguish; but even death would to her have been preferable to the horrors of crossing a tempestuous ocean and quitting her children, my father having resolved on leaving my brothers and myself in England for education.  Still the comforts, and even the luxuries of life distinguished our habitation. The tenderness of my mother's affection made her lavish of every elegance; and the darlings of her bosom were dressed, waited on, watched, and indulged with a degree of fondness bordering on folly. My clothes were sent for from London; my fancy was indulged to the extent of its caprices; I was flattered and praised into a belief that I was a being of superior order. To sing, to play a lesson on the harpsichord, to recite an elegy, and to make doggerel verses, made the extent of my occupations, while my person improved, and my mother's indulgence was almost unexampled.  My father, several years before his departure for America, had removed from the Minster House, and resided in one larger and more convenient for his increased family. This habitation was elegantly arranged; all the luxuries of plate, silk furniture, foreign wines, etc., evinced his knowledge of what was worth enjoying, and displayed that warm hospitality which is often the characteristic of a British merchant. This disposition for the good things of the world influenced even the disposal of his children's comforts.

Let me have fruitful gardens of great girth     Filled with the strife of birds,       With water-springs and beasts that house i' the earth.      Let me seem Solomon for lore of words,       Samson for strength, for beauty Absalom.      Knights as my serfs be given;       And as I will, let music go and come,     Till, when I will, I will to enter Heaven.  _As the singing ends, the curtain rises upon a corner of Balthazar Valori's garden near the northern border of Tuscany. The garden is walled. There is a shrine in the wall: the tortured figure upon the crucifix is conspicuous. To the right stands a rather high-backed stone bench: by mounting from the seat to the top of the bench it is possible to scale the wall. To the left a crimson pennant on a pole shows against the sky. The period is 1533, and a few miles southward the Florentines, after three years of formally recognizing Jesus Christ as the sole lord and king of Florence, have lately altered matters as profoundly as was possible by electing Alessandro de Medici to be their Duke._  _GRACIOSA is seated upon the bench, with a lute. The girl is, to our modern taste, very quaintly dressed in gold-colored satin, with a short tight bodice, cut square and low at the neck, and with long full skirts. When she stands erect, her preposterous \"flowing\" sleeves, lined with sky blue, reach to the ground. Her blonde hair, of which she has a great deal, is braided, in the intricate early sixteenth fashion, under a jeweled cap and a veil the exact color of this hair._  _There is a call. Smiling, GRACIOSA answers this call by striking her lute. She pats straight her hair and gown, and puts aside the instrument. GUIDO appears at the top of the wall. All you can see of the handsome young fellow, in this posture, is that he wears a green skull-cap and a dark blue smock, the slashed sleeves of which are lined with green._  GUIDO Ah, madonna....  GRACIOSA Welcome, Ser Guido. Your journey has been brief.  GUIDO It has not seemed brief to me.  GRACIOSA Why, it was only three days ago you told me it would be a fortnight before you came this way again.  GUIDO Yes, but I did not then know that each day spent apart from you, Madonna Graciosa, would be a century in passing.  GRACIOSA Dear me, but your search must have been desperate!  GUIDO (_Who speaks, as almost always hereinafter, with sober enjoyment of the fact that he is stating the exact truth unintelligibly._) Yes, my search is desperate.  GRACIOSA Did you find gems worthy of your search?  GUIDO Very certainly, since at my journey's end I find Madonna Graciosa, the chief jewel of Tuscany.  GRACIOSA Such compliments, Guido, make your speech less like a merchant's than a courtier's.  GUIDO Ah, well, to balance that, you will presently find courtiers in Florence who will barter for you like merchants. May I descend?  GRACIOSA Yes, if you have something of interest to show me.  GUIDO Am I to be welcomed merely for the sake of my gems? You were more gracious, you were more beautifully like your lovely name, on the fortunate day that I first encountered you ... only six weeks ago, and only yonder, where the path crosses the highway. But now that I esteem myself your friend, you greet me like a stranger. You do not even invite me into your garden. I much prefer the manner in which you told me the way to the inn when I was an unknown passer-by. And yet your pennant promised greeting.  GRACIOSA (_With the smile of an exceptionally candid angel._) Ah, Guido, I flew it the very minute the boy from the inn brought me your message!  GUIDO Now, there is the greeting I had hoped for! But how do you escape your father's watch so easily?  GRACIOSA My father has no need to watch me in this lonely hill castle. Ever since I can remember I have wandered at will in the forest. My father knows that to me every path is as familiar as one of the corridors in his house; and in no one of them did I ever meet anybody except charcoal-burners, and sometimes a nun from the convent, and--oh, yes!--you. But descend, friend Guido.  _Thus encouraged, GUIDO descends from the top of the wall to the top of the bench, and thence, via its seat, to the ground. You are thereby enabled to discover that his nether portions are clad in dark blue tights and soft leather shoes with pointed turned-up toes. It is also noticeable that he carries a jewel pack of purple, which, when opened, reveals an orange lining._  GUIDO (_With as much irony as the pleasure he takes in being again with this dear child permits._) That \"Oh, yes, you!\" is a very fitting reward for my devotion. For I find that nowadays I travel about the kingdom buying jewels less for my patrons at court than for the pleasure of having your eyes appraise them, and smile at me.  GRACIOSA (_With the condescension of a great lady._) Guido, you have in point of fact been very kind to me, and very amusing, too, in my loneliness on the top of this hill. (_Drawing back the sleeve from her left arm, she reveals the trinket there._) See, here is the turquoise bracelet I had from you the second time you passed. I wear it always--secretly.  GUIDO That is wise, for the turquoise is a talisman. They say that the woman who wears a turquoise is thereby assured of marrying the person whom she prefers.  GRACIOSA I do not know about that, nor do I expect to have much choice as to what rich nobleman marries me, but I know that I love this bracelet--  GUIDO In fact, they are handsome stones.  GRACIOSA Because it reminds me constantly of the hours which I have spent here with my lute--  GUIDO Oh, with your lute!  GRACIOSA And with your pack of lovely jewels--  GUIDO Yes, to be sure! with my jewels.  GRACIOSA And with you.  GUIDO There is again my gracious lady. Now, in reward for that, you shall feast your eyes.  GRACIOSA (_All eagerness._) And what have you to-day?  _GUIDO opens his pack. She bends above it with hands outstretched._  GUIDO (_Taking out a necklace._) For one thing, pearls, black pearls, set with a clasp of emeralds. See! They will become you.  GRACIOSA (_Taking them, pressing them to her cheek._) How cool! But I--poor child of a poor noble--I cannot afford such.  GUIDO Oh, I did not mean to offer them to you to-day. No, this string is intended for the Duke's favorite, Count Eglamore.  GRACIOSA (_Stiffening._) Count Eglamore! These are for him?  GUIDO For Count Eglamore.  GRACIOSA Has the upstart such taste?  GUIDO If it be taste to appreciate pearls, then the Duke's chief officer has excellent taste. He seeks them far and wide. He will be very generous in paying for this string.  _GRACIOSA drops the pearls, in which she no longer delights. She returns to the bench, and sits down and speaks with a sort of disappointment._  GRACIOSA I am sorry to learn that this Eglamore is among your patrons.  GUIDO (_Still half engrossed by the contents of his pack. The man loves jewels equally for their value and their beauty._) Oh, the nobles complain of him, but we merchants have no quarrel with Eglamore. He buys too lavishly.  GRACIOSA Do you think only of buying and selling, Guido?  GUIDO It is a pursuit not limited to us who frankly live by sale and purchase. Count Eglamore, for example, knows that men may be bought as readily as merchandise. It is one reason why he is so hated--by the unbought.  GRACIOSA (_Irritated by the title._) Count Eglamore, indeed! I ask in my prayers every night that some honest gentleman may contrive to cut the throat of this abominable creature.  GUIDO (_His hand going to his throat._) You pray too much, madonna. Even very pious people ought to be reasonable.  GRACIOSA (_Rising from the bench._) Have I not reason to hate the man who killed my kinsman?  GUIDO (_Rising from his gems._) The Marquis of Cibo conspired, or so the court judged--  GRACIOSA I know nothing of the judgment. But it was this Eglamore who discovered the plot, if there indeed was any plot, and who sent my cousin Cibo to a death--(_pointing to the shrine_)--oh, to a death as horrible as that. So I hate him.  GUIDO Yet you have never even seen him, I believe?  GRACIOSA And it would be better for him never to see me or any of my kin. My father, my uncles and my cousins have all sworn to kill him--  GUIDO So I have gathered. They remain among the unbought.  GRACIOSA (_Returning, sits upon the bench, and speaks regretfully._) But they have never any luck. Cousin Pietro contrived to have a beam dropped on Eglamore's head, and it missed him by not half a foot--  GUIDO Ah, yes, I remember.  GRACIOSA And Cousin Georgio stabbed him in the back one night, but the coward had on chain-armor under his finery--  GUIDO I remember that also.  GRACIOSA And Uncle Lorenzo poisoned his soup, but a pet dog got at it first. That was very unfortunate.  GUIDO Yes, the dog seemed to think so, I remember.  GRACIOSA However, perseverance is always rewarded. So I still hope that one or another of my kinsmen will contrive to kill this Eglamore before I go to court.  GUIDO (_Sits at her feet._) Has my Lord Balthazar yet set a day for that presentation?  GRACIOSA Not yet.  GUIDO I wish to have this Eglamore's accounts all settled by that date.  GRACIOSA But in three months, Guido, I shall be sixteen. My sisters went to court when they were sixteen.  GUIDO In fact, a noble who is not rich cannot afford to continue supporting a daughter who is salable in marriage.  GRACIOSA No,"]]]
