Did you see the party go?\"  \"I did,\" said Mathias.  The latter was no other than the captain of the brigands. Already they were upon a footing of equality, for the two adventurers had had opportunities, which they had not failed to seize.  They had courage, ready wit, presence of mind, boldness daring, and cunning, and so it fell out that they who had made the acquaintance of the brigand's gang under such very unpleasant auspices, became two of the principal members of it within a few days.  But to resume.  \"Tell me, Hunston,\" said Toro, \"does Jefferson go to the ball?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How disguised?\"  \"Julius Caesar.\"  The Italian said nothing, but his lips moved, and his lowering brow was as expressive as words could be to his old comrade.  It boded ill for Jefferson.  They had met in fair fight, and he, Toro, had been defeated.  That defeat was as bitter as gall to him.  He would be avenged.  And if he could not cope with the doughty Anglo-American, then let him look to it.  What strength and skill failed to achieve, the assassin's knife would accomplish.  \"Did you see the girl that attended him to the gate?\" demanded the mendicant friar, or Hunston, as it would be better to call him, since there is no further need of concealment.  \"I did.\"  \"And recognised her, Mathias?\" he asked of the brigand captain.  \"Yes; it is the pretty girl we stopped with her lover, the coy Marietta.\"  \"Now that they are well off, we may as well set to work,\" said Hunston.  \"Good.\"  Hunston threw back his friar's cowl and produced a key.  \"They have had many a good hunt for this,\" he said, with his old sinister laugh.  \"I dare say.\"  \"It was a lucky thing that the dainty little Marietta dropped it.\"  \"Yes, it makes matters much easier for us to begin with.\"  The door yielded to the touch of the sham mendicant friar, and the three worthies entered the grounds.  Silently they stepped across a grassplot, keeping a thick shrubbery between them and the house as far as they could, when just as they gained the shelter of a trellissed verandah, a dog within set up a most alarming noise.  The three robbers exchanged uneasy glances.  \"Curse the beast!\" muttered Mathias the captain; \"he will ruin us.\"  Toro got ready his long hunting-knife and looked about.  But the dog was out of sight.  A lucky thing it was too for our old friend little Mike, for a touch with that ugly instrument would soon have stopped his singing.  Now, just above the verandah was a half-opened window, and into this Mathias peered anxiously.  No signs of Mike.  A voice was heard now calling to the faithful guardian of the house to be silent, but Mike refused emphatically to be comforted; thereupon, the person very imprudently called the dog to her and tied him up.  This did not quiet him.  So the person in question tripped down the garden to see if there was really any reason for the dog's singular behaviour.  In passing down the path she went so close to the verandah, that the skirts of her dress actually brushed aside the creeping plants which garnished the trellis work.  \"Snarling, barking little beast!\" quoth Marietta to herself, \"and all about nothing; I wish they would lose him.\"  But when she got to the bottom of the garden and discovered the garden door open, she altered her tone.  \"How very silly of me to leave the door unlocked,\" she said to herself. \"Poor little fellow, poor Mike, I'm coming, good dog. Heard someone, I suppose. Good gracious, what's that? I thought I saw something move there. I'm getting as nervous as a cat ever since those men stopped us and made me kiss them, the beasts. Ugh I how I loathe them, although there was one of them that was really not very bad-looking. I wonder where that poor old friar went to. What was that? Oh, how nervous I feel. I wish they had left me some one in the house besides that old deaf Constantino; he's nice company truly for a girl. Bother the dog, what a noise he is kicking up.\"  And chatting thus, Marietta re-entered the house.  Meanwhile Mathias had clambered up the iron balcony and pushing open the glass door, or rather window, he entered the room.  It was the dining-room, and the remnants of a very sumptuous repast were yet upon the table.  \"I'll just take a glass of wine.\"  He did, too.  He took several glasses of wine, and then, as the fumes of the good liquor mounted to his brain, he grew generous, and he lowered a bottle out of the window to his two comrades beneath.  Toro grasped it, and sucked down a good half of it before it left his lips.  Then Hunston finished it off at a draught.  When Mathias had regaled himself, he made a move to the door.  There was no one about.  Not a sound.  Now was his time.  His object was to explore the house, and ascertain in what particular part of it the cash, the jewels, and the plate were kept.  When they had secured these, they could content themselves for the present at least.  Firstly, therefore, he tied up the silver spoons and knives and forks from the dinner table in a napkin, and dropped the bundle into Toro's hat below.  Then he crept back through the room into the passage.  This done, he waited for a while to listen, and assuring himself that the coast was clear, he crept up.  On the next landing there were seven doors.  Six were shut, so he peeped into the seventh room, and just then he heard a noise below.  Someone coming up stairs.  What could he do?  He stole back to the stairs and listened. It was Marietta.  It was really a most embarrassing job now, for there was no retreat, so he crept upon tip-toe into the room, of which the door stood ajar.  It was a bedroom, dimly lighted by an oil lamp.  A cursory glance showed him that this room had only been lately vacated, and that one or more of the ladies had been dressing here for the ball.  Within a few feet of the door was a looking-glass let into the wall as a panel, and reaching from floor to ceiling.  Mathias listened in great anxiety for the footsteps on the stairs, and every moment they sounded nearer and nearer.  \"I hope she will not come in here,\" thought the robber, \"else I shall have to make her sure.\"  He showed how he meant to \"make her sure\" by toying with the hilt of his dagger.  Mathias crouched down, and crept under the bed, just in time, as the pert young lady skipped into the room.  Her first care was to turn up the lamp, and by its light she looked about her.  \"I think they might have taken me to the ball with them,\" she said, saucily shaking her curls off her face. \"I should have looked better than some of them, I'll be bound. I'm dead beat with fatigue. I've had all the work dressing them, and they are to get all the fun.\"  She was silent for some few minutes, and Mathias grew anxious.  What could be going forward?  He would vastly like to know.  Unable to control his curiosity, he peeped out, and then he saw pretty Marietta's portrait in the long looking-glass panel.  She looked prettier than ever now, for, shocking to relate, the young lady was undressing.  Mathias was not to say a bashful man, so he did not draw back.  On the contrary, he stared with all his eyes.  Pretty Marietta little thought, as she stood before the glass, that such a desperate villain was watching every movement.  Marietta, wholly unconscious that she was watched by the vile brigand chief, walked up and down before the glass, shooting admiring glances at herself over her white and well rounded shoulders.  \"Dress, and rank, and money do wonders,\" she said. \"Why are we not all about equal? I'm as good as the best of them, I'm sure, and very much better looking.\"  With this mixture of feminine vanity and republican sentiments, she bustled about, putting the room a bit in order.  Now her first job was to put away several dresses.  The first of these was a short Spanish skirt of pink satin, with deep black lace flounces.  \"I wonder how I should look in this?\" she murmured.  She held up the dress beside her to test the colour against her complexion.  \"Beautiful!\"  Beautiful; yes, this was her frank opinion, and, really, we are by no means sure but that her own estimate was very near the mark.  On went the dress.  She strutted up and down, and then, when she had feasted her eyes enough upon her own loveliness, she plaited her hair, and, twisting it up into a rich knot behind, she stuck a high comb into it, and fastened the thick lace veil about her.  Mathias watched it all.  He gloated over that pretty little picture, and, shameless rascal! chuckled to think how little she suspected his presence.  \"There,\" she said, folding the veil about her head with the most coquettish manner, \"if I don't look the prettiest señorita alive, why, call me--call me anything odious--yes, even an Englishwoman--ha, ha, ha! How that would please my mistress!\"  And then she figured about before the glass, and capered through a Spanish bolero with considerable grace and dexterity, while she sang an impromptu verse to an old air.  The verse was naturally doggerel, and maybe given in English as follows--                        \"Sweet Marietta,                          Rarely has been                        A sweeter or better                          Face or form seen;                        My chestnut tresses,                          And my Spanish fall,                        Would eclipse all the dresses                          At the masked ball.                        Then why, Marietta.                          Dally?--ah, no!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7335"],["title","Jack Harkaway and His Son's Escape from the Brigands of Greece (#2)"],["body","up, you'd better,                          Your courage and go!\"  And as she came to the last line, this impudent little maid whirled round, spinning her skirts about her like a top.  Mathias was enraptured.  With difficulty he kept himself from applauding.  \"She'd make her fortune upon the stage,\" he said to himself.  Marietta had made quite a conquest; a double conquest, it might almost be said.  The hidden robber was enraptured, and she was scarcely less pleased with herself.  \"I'll go,\" she said to herself, \"Why should I not? They'll never find it out; I can do just as Cenerentola (Cinderella) did, and who knows but that some prince might fall over head and ears in love with me? I can get back long before they do.\"  Out she skipped too, and tripped down the stairs.  She was off to the ball.  Little dreamt she that for the last half hour her life hung upon the most slender thread.  And now, the coast being clear, the three brigands prepared to carry out their plans.     CHAPTER II.  AT THE CONTESSA'S FETE--A ROMANTIC ADVENTURE BETWEEN CERTAIN OLD FRIENDS.   The most brilliant fête of the year was that given by the rich Contessa Maraviglia at her palazzo.  All the rank and fashion of the land were there.  The palazzo itself was a building of great beauty, and stood in grounds of great extent.  The contessa, who was a widow, had a princely fortune, and she spent it lavishly too.  Upon the night of the masquerade the gardens were brilliantly lighted.  Upon the miniature lake there was a fairy gondola, with a coloured lantern dangling at the prow, and hung with curtains of pale blue silk gauze.  In this gondola a lady was seated.  She had taken to the gondola, not alone for the sake of the freshness of the breeze upon the water, but to read without interruption a letter she had received from a mysterious man who professed to be deeply smitten with her charms, and who, the messenger of love let fall, was a prince.  She wore a black domino, but was not masked, for as she threw back its folds to breathe more freely, you could see that her only veil was a thick fall of black lace, fastened to a high comb in the back of her head.  \"I hope he will not be long,\" said she to herself, while her heart beat high with expectation. \"His note says clearly enough on the lake in the fairy gondola. Well, it will certainly be nice to be a princess, but I do hope that his highness may prove to be a dashing, handsome youth, such as a Cinderella might sigh for. Hush, boatman!\"  \"Lady?\"  \"Do you hear?\"  \"Someone singing on the bank yonder? Yes! I hear, lady.\"  \"Row that way.\"  A voice was heard carolling gently the serenade--\"Fair shines the moon to-night.\"  The voice meant well, evidently, but something rather spoilt the effect.  It was not altogether in tune, nor had the singer the best idea in the world of time.  Perhaps his singing was spoilt by excess of love.  Perhaps by liquor.  The latter idea was suggested by a certain unsteadiness that would appear to indicate both love and liquor.  Be that as it may, the singer was not at all aware of the disadvantages under which he laboured.  On the contrary, he had the greatest belief in himself.  \"Boatman,\" exclaimed the lady, impatiently, \"row me ashore.\"  \"Yes, lady.\"  He obeyed, as he spoke, and as the boat grounded, the hidden minstrel stepped forward.  The gallant was rather a tall man, masked and habited in a long cloak, which almost concealed a glittering and gorgeous costume beneath.  This cavalier hastened to tender the lady his hand and to assist her to disembark.  As soon as she was fairly upon _terra firma_ the gentleman led her away to a more secluded part of the garden, and then ensued a brief but highly interesting conversation.  It took place in the Italian language.  That beautiful tongue was not to say elegantly spoken upon either side.  The gentleman spoke as a foreigner, but imperfectly acquainted with the idiom.  \"Sir,\" said the lady, after an embarrassing silence upon his part, \"I scarcely know if I ought to be here.\"  \"Nor I either, my dear lady,\" began the gallant.  But then, aware that this was not exactly what might have been expected of him, he stammered and broke down.  \"Poor prince,\" thought the lady, with a very unladylike chuckle to herself. \"How embarrassed he is.\"  The cavalier stared at her through the great eyes in his mask, as he muttered to himself--  \"She is evidently in love with me very badly; I am curious to learn how a princess makes love. I am anxious only of course to study it as a matter of curiosity.\"  \"I ought not to have come here, prince,\" said the lady, in a nervous tone.  Prince!  The word made the masked gentleman stare.  \"Prince! I suppose that she can't know I am a married man, and goes straight to the question. This is popping the question sharply.\"  He had never been made love to before by a lady of any degree, much less by a princess, so he was exceedingly anxious to see how she would begin upon this occasion.  But after they had got to a quiet and remote part of the garden, they came to a dead lock.  Not a word was spoken upon either side.  \"I wish he would say something to me,\" thought the lady.  She was not used to such bashful suitors.  \"I have kept your appointment, sir,\" she said, \"although I fear I am very wrong.\"  \"My appointment,\" muttered the cavalier in English, \"Come, I like that.\"  However, he added in the softest tones he could assume--  \"Fear nothing, princess, I am not a dangerous man.\"  She thought he was, though, for as he said this he chuckled.  The lady dropped her eyes before his bold glance and looked as timid as you could wish.  Now this appeared only to encourage the gentleman, for he seized her round the waist and pressed a kiss upon the only part of her cheek which was left uncovered by her veil.  She struggled feebly, oh, very feebly to release herself; but that libertine masker held her firmly; that is, as firmly as possible, for he was not very strong upon his pins.  \"Sir, you must not take advantage of my unprotected situation,\" she faltered.  \"I should be very sorry to, my coy princess,\" said the gallant.  These words set her heart beating like clockwork.  \"He means well,\" she thought, growing quite easy in her mind.  Meanwhile the ardent young lover, growing bolder by encouragement, wanted to remove her veil.  \"Grant me one favour, my princess,\" he said. \"Let me bask in the sunshine of your eyes; let me feast my vision upon your rare beauty.\"  The lady was enraptured at such poetical imagery.  \"It sounds like a lovely book,\" she murmured in ecstasy.  But she would not accede to his request.  She was so filled with joy, so supremely happy, that she feared to break the enchanting spell by any accident.  \"Desist, prince,\" she said, struggling gently in his embrace,  \"I must gaze on that angelic face,\" said the passionate Adonis.  \"Why,\" exclaimed the lady, \"since you know it so well?\"  \"Know it!\" exclaimed the gallant in surprise.  \"Yes.\"  \"I have never seen it.\"  \"Yet your letter praises each feature to the skies.\"  \"My letter!\"  He was staggered evidently.  \"Undoubtedly.\"  \"I sent no letter.\"  The lady was amazed \"If you sent no letter, why are you here?\" she demanded.  \"In obedience to yours,\" responded the gallant.  \"My what?\"  \"Your note--your ever-to-be-treasured missive,\" gushed the swain.  Now what would have followed in the way of explanations it is impossible to say, for at the momentous crisis, a voice close by was heard repeating softly a couplet heard before--                     \"Dear Marietta,                       Never had been                     A sweeter or neater                       Face or form seen.\"  The lady started and screamed, and would have fallen had not the protecting arm of the gentleman been there to catch her.  But her veil fell aside.  When the lover saw her face, he was staggered, and he nearly let her fall.  \"Marietta!\" he exclaimed, \"Marietta! Mrs. Harkaway's maid, by all that's wonderful.\"  \"Oho,\" screamed the lady, \"you're standing on my toe!\" saying which she jerked herself back, and dragging his foot away too, down he went.  \"It's Mr. Mole,\" shrieked the lady; and catching up her pink skirt and black lace flounces, she fled precipitately along the path, leaving her admirer scrambling in the most undignified manner upon the gravel walk.  Poor Mr. Mole.  But oh, poor Marietta; how sadly was she disappointed with her prince.     CHAPTER III.  MR. MOLE--THE THREE DEVILS AND THEIR DEVILMENT--THE CONTESSA'S JEWELS--AN ALARM.   \"Mr. Mole--Mr. Mole!\"  It was Harvey's voice.  Now Mr. Mole was convinced at once that Dick was at the bottom of this comical conspiracy in which he had been made to look so ridiculous. So he resolved at first not to make any reply.  But Harvey was guided to the spot by information which had been furnished him concerning Mr. Mole, and soon he appeared in sight.  \"Mr. Mole--Mr. Mole!\" exclaimed Dick, in grave reproof.  \"Help me up, Harvey,\" said Mole, \"and don't be a fool.\"  \"Well, that's polite.\"  \"Quite as polite as you can expect.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Oh, you know what I mean well enough.\"  \"I'm hanged if I do!\" protested Harvey, stoutly.  His manner caught Mr. Mole immediately.  So this led the old gentleman to reflect.  If Dick did not know, it would be as well to keep the adventure to himself.  \"Is it possible, Harvey, that you don't know what has occurred?\"  \"No.\"  \"You don't know about Marietta?\"  \"No.\"  This decided Mole.  \"Marietta is here.\"  \"Never!\" said Dick, in accents of deep mystery.  \"A fact.\"  \"Never! And who the dickens is Marietta when she is at home?\"  \"Mrs. Harkaway's maid, to be sure.\"  Dick burst out laughing at this.  \"Why, Mr. Mole,\" he cried, \"what a sly old fox you are.\"  Mr. Mole stared again.  \"I don't quite understand what you are driving at, Mr. Harvey,\" said he.  \"Don't you, though?--well, I do, old Slyboots.\"  \"Harvey!\"  \"Oh, don't you try to come the old soldier over me.\"  \"Sir!\" said Mr. Mole,"]]]
