I will show you what a good job I did,\" and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors.  Then back she came, lugging in her arms the Patchwork Girl, which she set upon the bench and propped up so that the figure would not tumble over.     Chapter Three  The Patchwork Girl   Ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder. The Patchwork Girl was taller than he, when she stood upright, and her body was plump and rounded because it had been so neatly stuffed with cotton. Margolotte had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it--using the same gay material throughout. Upon the feet she had sewn a pair of red leather shoes with pointed toes. All the fingers and thumbs of the girl's hands had been carefully formed and stuffed and stitched at the edges, with gold plates at the ends to serve as finger-nails.  \"She will have to work, when she comes to life,\" said Margolotte.  The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her. While she waited for her husband to finish making his Powder of Life the woman had found ample time to complete the head as her fancy dictated, and she realized that a good servant's head must be properly constructed. The hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids. Her eyes were two silver suspender-buttons cut from a pair of the Magician's old trousers, and they were sewed on with black threads, which formed the pupils of the eyes. Margolotte had puzzled over the ears for some time, for these were important if the servant was to hear distinctly, but finally she had made them out of thin plates of gold and attached them in place by means of stitches through tiny holes bored in the metal. Gold is the most common metal in the Land of Oz and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable.  The woman had cut a slit for the Patchwork Girl's mouth and sewn two rows of white pearls in it for teeth, using a strip of scarlet plush for a tongue. This mouth Ojo considered very artistic and lifelike, and Margolotte was pleased when the boy praised it. There were almost too many patches on the face of the girl for her to be considered strictly beautiful, for one cheek was yellow and the other red, her chin blue, her forehead purple and the center, where her nose had been formed and padded, a bright yellow.  \"You ought to have had her face all pink,\" suggested the boy.  \"I suppose so; but I had no pink cloth,\" replied the woman. \"Still, I cannot see as it matters much, for I wish my Patchwork Girl to be useful rather than ornamental. If I get tired looking at her patched face I can whitewash it.\"  \"Has she any brains?\" asked Ojo.  \"No; I forgot all about the brains!\" exclaimed the woman. \"I am glad you reminded me of them, for it is not too late to supply them, by any means. Until she is brought to life I can do anything I please with this girl. But I must be careful not to give her too much brains, and those she has must be such as are fitted to the station she is to occupy in life. In other words, her brains mustn't be very good.\"  \"Wrong,\" said Unc Nunkie.  \"No; I am sure I am right about that,\" returned the woman.  \"He means,\" explained Ojo, \"that unless your servant has good brains she won't know how to obey you properly, nor do the things you ask her to do.\"  \"Well, that may be true,\" agreed Margolotte; \"but, on the contrary, a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high-and-mighty and feel above her work. This is a very delicate task, as I said, and I must take care to give the girl just the right quantity of the right sort of brains. I want her to know just enough, but not too much.\"  With this she went to another cupboard which was filled with shelves. All the shelves were lined with blue glass bottles, neatly labeled by the Magician to show what they contained. One whole shelf was marked: \"Brain Furniture,\" and the bottles on this shelf were labeled as follows: \"Obedience,\" \"Cleverness,\" \"Judgment,\" \"Courage,\" \"Ingenuity,\" \"Amiability,\" \"Learning,\" \"Truth,\" \"Poesy,\" \"Self Reliance.\"  \"Let me see,\" said Margolotte; \"of those qualities she must have 'Obedience' first of all,\" and she took down the bottle bearing that label and poured from it upon a dish several grains of the contents. \"'Amiability' is also good and 'Truth.'\" She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles. \"I think that will do,\" she continued, \"for the other qualities are not needed in a servant.\"  Unc Nunkie, who with Ojo stood beside her, touched the bottle marked \"Cleverness.\"  \"Little,\" said he.  \"A little 'Cleverness'? Well, perhaps you are right, sir,\" said she, and was about to take down the bottle when the Crooked Magician suddenly called to her excitedly from the fireplace.  \"Quick, Margolotte! Come and help me.\"  She ran to her husband's side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire. Their contents had all boiled away, leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder. Very carefully the Magician removed this powder, placing it all together in a golden dish, where he mixed it with a golden spoon. When the mixture was complete there was scarcely a handful, all told.  \"That,\" said Dr. Pipt, in a pleased and triumphant tone, \"is the wonderful Powder of Life, which I alone in the world know how to make. It has taken me nearly six years to prepare these precious grains of dust, but the little heap on that dish is worth the price of a kingdom and many a king would give all he has to possess it. When it has become cooled I will place it in a small bottle; but meantime I must watch it carefully, lest a gust of wind blow it away or scatter it.\"  Unc Nunkie, Margolotte and the Magician all stood looking at the marvelous Powder, but Ojo was more interested just then in the Patchwork Girl's brains. Thinking it both unfair and unkind to deprive her of any good qualities that were handy, the boy took down every bottle on the shelf and poured some of the contents in Margolotte's dish. No one saw him do this, for all were looking at the Powder of Life; but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing, and came back to the cupboard.  \"Let's see,\" she remarked; \"I was about to give my girl a little 'Cleverness,' which is the Doctor's substitute for 'Intelligence'--a quality he has not yet learned how to manufacture.\" Taking down the bottle of \"Cleverness\" she added some of the powder to the heap on the dish. Ojo became a bit uneasy at this, for he had already put quite a lot of the \"Cleverness\" powder in the dish; but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness.  Margolotte now carried the dish of brains to the bench. Ripping the seam of the patch on the girl's forehead, she placed the powder within the head and then sewed up the seam as neatly and securely as before.  \"My girl is all ready for your Powder of Life, my dear,\" she said to her husband. But the Magician replied:  \"This powder must not be used before to-morrow morning; but I think it is now cool enough to be bottled.\"  He selected a small gold bottle with a pepper-box top, so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes. Very carefully he placed the Powder of Life in the gold bottle and then locked it up in a drawer of his cabinet.  \"At last,\" said he, rubbing his hands together gleefully, \"I have ample leisure for a good talk with my old friend Unc Nunkie. So let us sit down cosily and enjoy ourselves. After stirring those four kettles for six years I am glad to have a little rest.\"  \"You will have to do most of the talking,\" said Ojo, \"for Unc is called the Silent One and uses few words.\"  \"I know; but that renders your uncle a most agreeable companion and gossip,\" declared Dr. Pipt. \"Most people talk too much, so it is a relief to find one who talks too little.\"  Ojo looked at the Magician with much awe and curiosity.  \"Don't you find it very annoying to be so crooked?\" he asked.  \"No; I am quite proud of my person,\" was the reply. \"I suppose I am the only Crooked Magician in all the world. Some others are accused of being crooked, but I am the only genuine.\"  He was really very crooked and Ojo wondered how he managed to do so many things with such a twisted body. When he sat down upon a crooked chair that had been made to fit him, one knee was under his chin and the other near the small of his back; but he was a cheerful man and his face bore a pleasant and agreeable expression.  \"I am not allowed to perform magic, except for my own amusement,\" he told his visitors, as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began to smoke. \"Too many people were working magic in the Land of Oz, and so our lovely Princess Ozma put a stop to it. I think she was quite right. There were several wicked Witches who caused a lot of trouble; but now they are all out of business and only the great Sorceress, Glinda the Good, is permitted to practice her arts, which never harm anybody. The Wizard of Oz, who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all, has been taking lessons of Glinda, and I'm told he is getting to be a pretty good Wizard; but he is merely the assistant of the great Sorceress. I've the right to make a servant girl for my wife, you know, or a Glass Cat to catch our mice--which she refuses to do--but I am forbidden to work magic for others, or to use it as a profession.\"  \"Magic must be a very interesting study,\" said Ojo.  \"It truly is,\" asserted the Magician. \"In my time I've performed some magical feats that were worthy of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],["title","Tik-Tok of Oz (#1)"],["body","me years ago, for she can fight better than I. Take her, Your Majesty, instead of me, and I'll bless you for the favor.\"  \"This must be an army of men--fierce, ferocious warriors,\" declared Ann, looking sternly upon the mild little man.  \"And you will leave my wife here in Oogaboo?\" he asked.  \"Yes; and make you a General.\"  \"I'll go,\" said Jo Cone, and Ann went on to the cottage of Jo Clock, who had an orchard of clock-trees. This man at first insisted that he would not join the army, but Queen Ann's promise to make him a General finally won his consent.  \"How many Generals are there in your army?\" he asked.  \"Four, so far,\" replied Ann.  \"And how big will the army be?\" was his next question.  \"I intend to make every one of the eighteen men in Oogaboo join it,\" she said.  \"Then four Generals are enough,\" announced Jo Clock. \"I advise you to make the rest of them Colonels.\"  Ann tried to follow his advice. The next four men she visited--who were Jo Plum, Jo Egg, Jo Banjo and Jo Cheese, named after the trees in their orchards--she made Colonels of her Army; but the fifth one, Jo Nails, said Colonels and Generals were getting to be altogether too common in the Army of Oogaboo and he preferred to be a Major. So Jo Nails, Jo Cake, Jo Ham and Jo Stockings were all four made Majors, while the next four--Jo Sandwich, Jo Padlocks, Jo Sundae and Jo Buttons--were appointed Captains of the Army.  But now Queen Ann was in a quandary. There remained but two other men in all Oogaboo, and if she made these two Lieutenants, while there were four Captains, four Majors, four Colonels and four Generals, there was likely to be jealousy in her army, and perhaps mutiny and desertions.  One of these men, however, was Jo Candy, and he would not go at all. No promises could tempt him, nor could threats move him. He said he must remain at home to harvest his crop of jackson-balls, lemon-drops, bonbons and chocolate-creams. Also he had large fields of crackerjack and buttered pop corn to be mowed and threshed, and he was determined not to disappoint the children of Oogaboo by going away to conquer the world and so let the candy crop spoil.  Finding Jo Candy so obstinate, Queen Ann let him have his own way and continued her journey to the house of the eighteenth and last man in Oogaboo, who was a young fellow named Jo Files. This Files had twelve trees which bore steel files of various sorts; but also he had nine book-trees, on which grew a choice selection of story-books. In case you have never seen books growing upon trees, I will explain that those in Jo Files' orchard were enclosed in broad green husks which, when fully ripe, turned to a deep red color. Then the books were picked and husked and were ready to read. If they were picked too soon, the stories were found to be confused and uninteresting and the spelling bad. However, if allowed to ripen perfectly, the stories were fine reading and the spelling and grammar excellent.  Files freely gave his books to all who wanted them, but the people of Oogaboo cared little for books and so he had to read most of them himself, before they spoiled. For, as you probably know, as soon as the books were read the words disappeared and the leaves withered and faded--which is the worst fault of all books which grow upon trees.  When Queen Ann spoke to this young man Files, who was both intelligent and ambitious, he said he thought it would be great fun to conquer the world. But he called her attention to the fact that he was far superior to the other men of her army. Therefore, he would not be one of her Generals or Colonels or Majors or Captains, but claimed the honor of being sole Private.  Ann did not like this idea at all.  \"I hate to have a Private Soldier in my army,\" she said; \"they're so common. I am told that Princess Ozma once had a private soldier, but she made him her Captain-General, which is good evidence that the private was unnecessary.\"  \"Ozma's army doesn't fight,\" returned Files; \"but your army must fight like fury in order to conquer the world. I have read in my books that it is always the private soldiers who do the fighting, for no officer is ever brave enough to face the foe. Also, it stands to reason that your officers must have some one to command and to issue their orders to; therefore I'll be the one. I long to slash and slay the enemy and become a hero. Then, when we return to Oogaboo, I'll take all the marbles away from the children and melt them up and make a marble statue of myself for all to look upon and admire.\"  Ann was much pleased with Private Files. He seemed indeed to be such a warrior as she needed in her enterprise, and her hopes of success took a sudden bound when Files told her he knew where a gun-tree grew and would go there at once and pick the ripest and biggest musket the tree bore.     Chapter Two  Out of Oogaboo   Three days later the Grand Army of Oogaboo assembled in the square in front of the royal palace. The sixteen officers were attired in gorgeous uniforms and carried sharp, glittering swords. The Private had picked his gun and, although it was not a very big weapon, Files tried to look fierce and succeeded so well that all his commanding officers were secretly afraid of him.  The women were there, protesting that Queen Ann Soforth had no right to take their husbands and fathers from them; but Ann commanded them to keep silent, and that was the hardest order to obey they had ever received.  The Queen appeared before her Army dressed in an imposing uniform of green, covered with gold braid. She wore a green soldier-cap with a purple plume in it and looked so royal and dignified that everyone in Oogaboo except the Army was glad she was going. The Army was sorry she was not going alone.  \"Form ranks!\" she cried in her shrill voice.  Salye leaned out of the palace window and laughed.  \"I believe your Army can run better than it can fight,\" she observed.  \"Of course,\" replied General Bunn, proudly. \"We're not looking for trouble, you know, but for plunder. The more plunder and the less fighting we get, the better we shall like our work.\"  \"For my part,\" said Files, \"I prefer war and carnage to anything. The only way to become a hero is to conquer, and the story-books all say that the easiest way to conquer is to fight.\"  \"That's the idea, my brave man!\" agreed Ann. \"To fight is to conquer and to conquer is to secure plunder and to secure plunder is to become a hero. With such noble determination to back me, the world is mine! Good-bye, Salye. When we return we shall be rich and famous. Come, Generals; let us march.\"  At this the Generals straightened up and threw out their chests. Then they swung their glittering swords in rapid circles and cried to the Colonels:  \"For-ward March!\"  Then the Colonels shouted to the Majors: \"For-ward March!\" and the Majors yelled to the Captains: \"For-ward March!\" and the Captains screamed to the Private:  \"For-ward March!\"  So Files shouldered his gun and began to march, and all the officers followed after him. Queen Ann came last of all, rejoicing in her noble army and wondering why she had not decided long ago to conquer the world.  In this order the procession marched out of Oogaboo and took the narrow mountain pass which led into the lovely Fairyland of Oz.     Chapter Three  Magic Mystifies the Marchers   Princess Ozma was all unaware that the Army of Oogaboo, led by their ambitious Queen, was determined to conquer her Kingdom. The beautiful girl Ruler of Oz was busy with the welfare of her subjects and had no time to think of Ann Soforth and her disloyal plans. But there was one who constantly guarded the peace and happiness of the Land of Oz and this was the Official Sorceress of the Kingdom, Glinda the Good.  In her magnificent castle, which stands far north of the Emerald City where Ozma holds her court, Glinda owns a wonderful magic Record Book, in which is printed every event that takes place anywhere, just as soon as it happens.  The smallest things and the biggest things are all recorded in this book. If a child stamps its foot in anger, Glinda reads about it; if a city burns down, Glinda finds the fact noted in her book.  The Sorceress always reads her Record Book every day, and so it was she knew that Ann Soforth, Queen of Oogaboo, had foolishly assembled an army of sixteen officers and one private soldier, with which she intended to invade and conquer the Land of Oz.  There was no danger but that Ozma, supported by the magic arts of Glinda the Good and the powerful Wizard of Oz--both her firm friends--could easily defeat a far more imposing army than Ann's; but it would be a shame to have the peace of Oz interrupted by any sort of quarreling or fighting. So Glinda did not even mention the matter to Ozma, or to anyone else. She merely went into a great chamber of her castle, known as the Magic Room, where she performed a magical ceremony which caused the mountain pass that led from Oogaboo to make several turns and twists. The result was that when Ann and her army came to the end of the pass they were not in the Land of Oz at all, but in an adjoining territory that was quite distinct from Ozma's domain and separated from Oz by an invisible barrier.  As the Oogaboo people emerged into this country, the pass they had traversed disappeared behind them and it was not likely they would ever find their way back into the valley of Oogaboo. They were greatly puzzled, indeed, by their surroundings and did not know which way to go. None of them had ever visited Oz, so it took them some time to discover they were not in Oz at all, but in an unknown country.  \"Never mind,\" said Ann, trying to conceal her disappointment; \"we have started out to conquer the world, and here is part of it. In time, as we pursue our victorious journey, we will doubtless come to Oz; but, until we get there, we may as well conquer whatever land we find ourselves in.\"  \"Have we conquered this place, Your Majesty?\" anxiously"]]]
