His wife Baucis and himself had dwelt in the cottage from their youth upward, earning their bread by honest labor, always poor, but still contented.  He told what excellent butter and cheese Baucis made, and how nice were the vegetables which he raised in his garden.  He said, too, that, because they loved one another so very much, it was the wish of both that death might not separate them, but that they should die, as they had lived, together.  As the stranger listened, a smile beamed over his countenance, and made its expression as sweet as it was grand.  “You are a good old man,” said he to Philemon, “and you have a good old wife to be your helpmeet.  It is fit that your wish be granted.”  And it seemed to Philemon, just then, as if the sunset clouds threw up a bright flash from the west, and kindled a sudden light in the sky.  Baucis had now got supper ready, and, coming to the door, began to make apologies for the poor fare which she was forced to set before her guests.  “Had we known you were coming,” said she, “my good man and myself would have gone without a morsel, rather than you should lack a better supper. But I took the most part of to-day’s milk to make cheese; and our last loaf is already half eaten.  Ah me!  I never feel the sorrow of being poor, save when a poor traveller knocks at our door.”  “All will be very well; do not trouble yourself, my good dame,” replied the elder stranger, kindly.  “An honest, hearty welcome to a guest works miracles with the fare, and is capable of turning the coarsest food to nectar and ambrosia.”  “A welcome you shall have,” cried Baucis, “and likewise a little honey that we happen to have left, and a bunch of purple grapes besides.”  “Why, Mother Baucis, it, is a feast!” exclaimed Quicksilver, laughing, “an absolute feast! and you shall see how bravely I will play my part at it!  I think I never felt hungrier in my life.”  “Mercy on us!” whispered Baucis to her husband.  “If the young man has such a terrible appetite, I am afraid there will not be half enough supper!”  They all went into the cottage.  And now, my little auditors, shall I tell you something that will make you open your eyes very wide?  It is really one of the oddest circumstances in the whole story.  Quicksilver’s staff, you recollect, had set itself up against the wall of the cottage.  Well; when its master entered the door, leaving this wonderful staff behind, what should it do but immediately spread its little wings, and go hopping and fluttering up the doorsteps!  Tap, tap, went the staff, on the kitchen floor; nor did it rest until it had stood itself on end, with the greatest gravity and decorum, beside Quicksilver’s chair.  Old Philemon, however, as well as his wife, was so taken up in attending to their guests, that no notice was given to what the staff had been about.  As Baucis had said, there was but a scanty supper for two hungry travellers.  In the middle of the table was the remnant of a brown loaf, with a piece of cheese on one side of it, and a dish of honeycomb on the other.  There was a pretty good bunch of grapes for each of the guests. A moderately sized earthen pitcher, nearly full of milk, stood at a corner of the board; and when hands had filled two bowls, and set them before the strangers, only a little milk remained in the bottom of the pitcher.  Alas! it is a very sad business, when a bountiful heart finds itself pinched and squeezed among narrow circumstances.  Poor Baucis kept wishing that she might starve for a week to come, if it were possible, by so doing, to provide these hungry folks a more plentiful supper.  And, since the supper was so exceedingly small, she could not help wishing that their appetites had not been quite so large.  Why, at their very first sitting down, the travellers both drank off all the milk in their two bowls, at a draught.  “A little more milk, kind Mother Baucis, if you please,” said Quicksilver.  “The day has been hot, and I am very much athirst.”  “Now, my dear people,” answered Baucis, in great confusion, “I am so sorry and ashamed!  But the truth is, there is hardly a drop more milk in the pitcher.  O husband! husband! why did n’t we go without our supper?”  “Why, it appears to me,” cried Quicksilver, starting up from table and taking the pitcher by the handle, “it really appears to me that matters are not quite so bad as you represent them.  Here is certainly more milk in the pitcher.”  So saying, and to the vast astonishment of Baucis, he proceeded to fill, not only his own bowl, but his companion’s likewise, from the pitcher, that was supposed to be almost empty.  The good woman could scarcely believe her eyes.  She had certainly poured out nearly all the milk, and had peeped in afterwards, and seen the bottom of the pitcher, as she set it down upon the table.  “But I am old,” thought Baucis to herself, “and apt to be forgetful.  I suppose I must have made a mistake.  At all events, the pitcher cannot, help being empty now, after filling the bowls twice over.”  “What excellent milk!” observed Quicksilver, after quaffing the contents of the second bowl.  “Excuse me, my kind hostess, but I must really ask you for a little more.”  Now Baucis had seen, as plainly as she could see anything, that Quicksilver had turned the pitcher upside down, and consequently had poured out every drop of milk, in filling the last bowl.  Of course, there could not possibly be any left.  However, in order to let him know precisely how the case was, she lifted the pitcher, and made a gesture as if pouring milk into Quicksilver’s bowl, but without the remotest idea that any milk would stream forth.  What was her surprise, therefore, when such an abundant cascade fell bubbling into the bowl, that it was immediately filled to the brim, and overflowed upon the table!  The two snakes that were twisted about Quicksilver’s staff (but neither Baucis nor Philemon happened to observe this circumstance) stretched out their heads, and began to lap up the spilt milk.  And then what a delicious fragrance the milk had!  It seemed as if Philemon’s only cow must have pastured, that day, on the richest herbage that could be found anywhere in the world.  I only wish that each of you, my beloved little souls, could have a bowl of such nice milk, at supper-time!  “And now a slice of your brown loaf, Mother Baucis,” said Quicksilver, “and a little of that honey!”  Baucis cut him a slice, accordingly; and though the loaf, when she and her husband ate of it, had been rather too dry and crusty to be palatable, it was now as light and moist as if but a few hours out of the oven.  Tasting a crumb, which had fallen on the table, she found it more delicious than bread ever was before, and could hardly believe that it was a loaf of her own kneading and baking.  Yet, what other loaf could it possibly be?  But, oh the honey!  I may just as well let it alone, without trying to describe how exquisitely it smelt and looked.  Its color was that of the purest and most transparent gold; and it had the odor of a thousand flowers; but of such flowers as never grew in an earthly garden, and to seek which the bees must have flown high above the clouds.  The wonder is, that, after alighting on a flower-bed of so delicious fragrance and immortal bloom, they should have been content to fly down again to their hive in Philemon’s garden.  Never was such honey tasted, seen, or smelt. The perfume floated around the kitchen, and made it so delightful, that, had you closed your eyes, you would instantly have forgotten the low ceiling and smoky walls, and have fancied yourself in an arbor, with celestial honeysuckles creeping over it.  Although good Mother Baucis was a simple old dame, she could not but think that there was something rather out of the common way, in all that had been going on.  So, after helping the guests to bread and honey, and laying a bunch of grapes by each of their plates, she sat down by Philemon, and told him what she had seen, in a whisper.  “Did you ever hear the like?” asked she.  “No, I never did,” answered Philemon, with a smile.  “And I rather think, my dear old wife, you have been walking about in a sort of a dream.  If I had poured out the milk, I should have seen through the business, at once.  There happened to be a little more in the pitcher than you thought,--that is all.”  “Ah, husband,” said Baucis, “say what you will, these are very uncommon people.”  “Well, well,” replied Philemon, still smiling, “perhaps they are.  They certainly do look as if they had seen better days; and I am heartily glad to see them making so comfortable a supper.”  Each of the guests had now taken his bunch of grapes upon his plate. Baucis (who rubbed her eyes, in order to see the more clearly) was of opinion that the clusters had grown larger and richer, and that each separate grape seemed to be on the point of bursting with ripe juice. It was entirely a mystery to her how such grapes could ever have been produced from the old stunted vine that climbed against the cottage-wall.  “Very admirable grapes these!” observed Quicksilver, as he swallowed one after another, without apparently diminishing his cluster.  “Pray, my good host, whence did you gather them?”  “From my own vine,” answered Philemon.  “You may see one of its branches twisting across the window, yonder.  But wife and I never thought the grapes very fine ones.”  “I never tasted better,” said the guest.  “Another cup of this delicious milk, if you please, and I shall then have supped better than a prince.”  This time, old Philemon bestirred himself, and took up the pitcher; for he was curious to discover whether there was any reality in the marvels which Baucis had whispered to him.  He knew that his good old wife was incapable of falsehood, and that she was seldom mistaken in what "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/926"],["title","Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted; Or, What's in a Dream (#1)"],["body","to us some power unknown.  ``No doubt it is difficult to apportion what belongs to the spirit, the soul, and what belongs to the brain.  We can only let ourselves be guided in our judgment and our appreciations by the same feeling that is created in us by the discussion of phenomena. This is how all science has been started.  Well, and does not every one feel that we have here to do with manifestations from beings capable of thought, and not with material physiological facts only?  ``This impression is superabundantly confirmed by investigation concerning the unknown faculties of the soul, when active in dreams and somnambulism.  ``A brother learns the death of his young sister by a terrible nightmare.  ``A young girl sees beforehand, in a dream, the man whom she will marry.  ``A mother sees her child lying in a road, covered with blood.  ``A lady goes, in a dream, to visit her husband on a distant steamer, and her husband really receives this visit, which is seen by a third person.  ``A magnetized lady sees and describes the interior of the body of her dying mother; what she said is confirmed by the autopsy.  ``A gentleman sees, in a dream, a lady whom he knows arriving at night in a railroad station, her journey having been undertaken suddenly.  ``A magistrate sees three years in advance the commission of a crime, down to its smallest details.  ``Several persons report that they have seen towns and landscapes before they ever visited them, and have seen themselves in situations in which they found themselves long after.  ``A mother hears her daughter announce her intended marriage six months before it has been thought of.  ``Frequent cases of death are foretold with precision.  ``A theft is seen by a somnambulist, and the execution of the criminal is foretold.  ``A young girl sees her fiance', or an intimate friend dying (these are frequent cases), etc.  ``All these show unknown faculties in the soul.  Such at least is my own impression.  It seems to me that we cannot reasonably attribute the prevision of the future and mental sight to a nervous action of the brain.  ``I think we must either deny these facts or admit that they must have had an intellectual and spiritual cause of the psychic order, and I recommend sceptics who do not desire to be convinced, to deny them outright; to treat them as illusions and cases of a fortuitous coincidence of circumstances.  They will find this easier. Uncompromising deniers of facts, rebels against evidence, may be all the more positive, and may declare that the writers of these extraordinary narratives are persons fond of a joke, who have written them to hoax me, and that there have been persons in all ages who have done the same thing to mystify thinkers who have taken up such questions.  ``These phenomena prove, I think, that the soul exists, and that it is endowed with faculties at present unknown. That is the logical way of commencing our study, which in the end may lead us to the problem of the after-life and immortality. A thought can be transmitted to the mind of another. There are mental transmissions, communications of thoughts, and psychic currents between human souls.  Space appears to be no obstacle in these cases, and time sometimes seems to be annihilated.''  A few years ago a person whom I will designate as ``A'' related a dream to me as follows:  ``I take no interest in pugilism or pugilists, but I saw, in a dream, every detail of the Corbett and Fitzsimmons mill, four days before it took place out West.  Two nights before the fight I had a second dream in which a favorite horse was running, but suddenly, just before the judge's stand was passed, a hitherto unobserved little black horse ran ahead and the crowd shouted in my ears, `Fitzsimmons wins!' ''  ``B'' relates the following as a dream:  ``I saw the American soldiers, in clay-colored uniform, bearing the flag of victory two weeks before the Spanish-American war was declared, and of course before any living being could have known the uniform to be adopted. Later I saw, several days before the actual occurrence happened, the destruction of Cervera's fleet by the American navy.'' Signed ``B.''  ``Just after the South African hostilities began, I saw in a dream a fierce struggle between the British and Boers, in which the former suffered severe losses.  A few nights after I had a second dream in which I saw the contending forces in a long-drawn contest, very disastrous to both, and in which neither could claim a victory. They seemed to be fighting to a frazzle.''  Signed ``C.''  ``D'' related to me at the time of the occurrence of the dream the following: ``It had been suggested to me that the two cereals, corn and wheat, were too far apart, and that I ought to buy corn.  At noon I lay down on a lounge to await luncheon; I had barely closed my eyes before a voice whispered: `Don't buy, but sell that corn.'  `What do you mean?'  I asked. `Sell at the present price, and buy at 23 7/8.' '' The foregoing dream was related to me by a practical, successful business man who never speculates. I watched the corn market and know it took the turns indicated in the dream.  In this dream we find the dreamer conversing with some strange intelligence possessed of knowledge unknown to objective reason. It could not, therefore, have been the waking thoughts of the dreamer, for he possessed no such information. Was the message superinduced through the energies and activities of the waking mind on the subjective mind? This could not have been, because he had no such thoughts; besides, the intelligence given was free from the errors of the calculating and anxious waking mind.  We must therefore look to other sources for an explanation.  Was it the higher self that manifested to Abraham in the dim ages of the world? Was it the Divine Voice that gave solace to Krishna in his abstraction? Was it the unerring light that preceded Gautama into the strange solitudes of Asia?  Was it the small voice that Elijah heard in the desert of Shurr?  Was it the Comforter of Jesus in the wilderness and the garden of distress?  Or, was it Paul's indwelling spirit of this earthly tabernacle? One thing we may truthfully affirm--that it did not proceed from the rational, objective mind of the rank materialist, who would close all doors to that inner life and consciousness where all true religion finds its birthmark, its hope, its promises and its faith; which, rightly understood, will leave to the horrors of the Roman crucifixion the twin thieves, superstition and scepticism, while the angel of ``Goodwill'' will go free to solace the world with the fruit and fragrance of enduring power and promise{.} The steel chains that fasten these hydra-headed crocodiles of sensuous poison around love and destiny can only be severed by the diamond of wisdom and knowledge.  A citizen worthy of confidence relates the following dream: ``In December, 1878, I saw in a dream my brother-in-law, Henry Yarnell, suffering from a bloody knife wound; after this I awoke, but soon fell asleep again.  The second time I dreamed of a similar scene, except that the wound was the result of a shotgun.  After this I did not go to sleep again.  I was much troubled about my dream, and soon started in the direction of my brother-in-law's house. I had not gone far, when I met an acquaintance who promptly informed me that my brother-in-law had been shot.''  Signed ``E.''  A well-known resident of Chattanooga, Tenn., formerly of New York City, will vouch for the accuracy of the following incident in his life:  ``On February 19, 1878, I was boarding with a family on Christopher street, New York, while my wife and baby were visiting my parents in the country, a short distance from the city.  Our baby was taken sick. The malady developed into brain fever, followed by water on the brain, causing the little one's death.  ``At our boarding-place there was at the time a quartette of us grass widowers, as we called ourselves, and in order to pass away the time pleasantly we had organized a `grass widowers' euchre club.' We used to meet almost every evening after dinner in the dining-room, and play until about eleven o'clock, when we would retire. On the above date I dreamed that after playing our usual evening games we took our departure for our rooms, and on the way up the second flight of stairs I heard a slight movement behind me; on looking around I found I was being followed by a tall figure robed in a long, loose white gown, which came down to the floor. The figure seemed to be that of a man--I would say, about seven feet tall--who followed me up the second flight and along the hallway, entering my room.  After coming in the door he made a circle of the room and seemed to be looking for something, and when he approached the door to make his exit he stopped still, and with a gesture of his hand remarked, `I have taken all you have.' On the following morning, about 9:30 o'clock, I received a telegram from my wife announcing the death of our only baby.''  Signed ``F.''  A well-known citizen of Chattanooga, Tenn., relates and vouches for the truth of the following occurrence:  ``Several years ago, when a boy, I had a schoolmate and friend, Willie T., between whom and myself there sprung up a mutual feeling of high regard. We were chums in the sense that we were almost constantly together, both at school and at home, and among the partnerships we formed was one of having amateur shadowgraph and panoramic shows in the basement of Willie's home. This much to show the mental and social relationship that existed between us. Some time during this association (I cannot recall the exact night now) I had a strange dream, in which my chum appeared to me with outstretched hand, asking me to shake, saying, `I shall not see you any more.'  With that, the dream lapsed and was over.  I thought nothing of the occurrence, and had almost forgotten it, when one day, about a week later, during"]]]
