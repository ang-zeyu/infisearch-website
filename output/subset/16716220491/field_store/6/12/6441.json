The bay was in the air more than he was on the ground, eleven or twelve hundred pounds of might, writhing, snapping, bolting, halting, sunfishing with devilish cunning, dropping out of the air on one stiff foreleg with an accompanying sway to one side that gave the rider the effect of a cudgel blow at the back of the head and then a whip-snap to part the vertebrae. Whirling on his hind legs, and again flinging himself desperately on the ground, only to fail, come to his feet with the clinging burden once more maddeningly in place, and go again through a maze of fence-rowing and sun-fishing until suddenly he straightened out and bolted down the slope like a runaway locomotive on a downgrade. A terrifying spectacle, but the rider sat erect, with one arm raised high above his head in triumph, and his yell trailing off behind him. From a running gait the stallion fell into a smooth pace--a true wild pacer, his hoofs beating the ground with the force and speed of pistons and hurling himself forward with incredible strides. Horse and rider lurched out of sight among the silver spruce.  \"By the Lord, wonderful!\" cried Vance Cornish.  He heard a stifled cry beside him, a cry of infinite pain.  \"Is--is it over?\"  And there sat Elizabeth the Indomitable with her face buried in her hands like a girl of sixteen!  \"Of course it's over,\" said Vance, wondering profoundly.  She seemed to dread to look up. \"And--Terence?\"  \"He's all right. Ever hear of a horse that could get that young wildcat out of the saddle? He clings as if he had claws. But--where did he get that red devil?\"  \"Terence ran him down--in the mountains--somewhere,\" she answered, speaking as one who had only half heard the question. \"Two months of constant trailing to do it, I think. But oh, you're right! The horse is a devil! And sometimes I think--\"  She stopped, shuddering. Vance had returned to the ranch only the day before after a long absence. More and more, after he had been away, he found it difficult to get in touch with things on the ranch. Once he had been a necessary part of the inner life. Now he was on the outside. Terence and Elizabeth were a perfectly completed circle in themselves.    CHAPTER 3   \"If Terry worries you like this,\" suggested her brother kindly, \"why don't you forbid these pranks?\"  She looked at him as if in surprise.  \"Forbid Terry?\" she echoed, and then smiled. Decidedly this was her first tone, a soft tone that came from deep in her throat. Instinctively Vance contrasted it with the way she had spoken to him. But it was always this way when Terry was mentioned. For the first time he saw it clearly. It was amazing how blind he had been. \"Forbid Terence? Vance, that devil of a horse is part of his life. He was on a hunting trip when he saw Le Sangre--\"  \"Good Lord, did they call the horse that?\"  \"A French-Canadian was the first to discover him, and he gave the name. And he's the color of blood, really. Well, Terence saw Le Sangre on a hilltop against the sky. And he literally went mad. Actually, he struck out on foot with his rifle and lived in the country and never stopped walking until he wore down Le Sangre somehow and brought him back hobbled--just skin and bones, and Terence not much more. Now Le Sangre is himself again, and he and Terence have a fight--like that--every day. I dream about it; the most horrible nightmares!\"  \"And you don't stop it?\"  \"My dear Vance, how little you know Terence! You couldn't tear that horse out of his life without breaking his heart. I _know!_\"  \"So you suffer, day by day?\"  \"I've done very little else all my life,\" said Elizabeth gravely. \"And I've learned to bear pain.\"  He swallowed. Also, he was beginning to grow irritated. He had never before had a talk with Elizabeth that contained so many reefs that threatened shipwreck. He returned to the gist of their conversation rather too bluntly.  \"But to continue, Elizabeth, any banker would lend me money on my prospects.\"  \"You mean the property which will come to you when I die?\"  He used all his power, but he could not meet her glance. \"You know that's a nasty way to put it, Elizabeth.\"  \"Dear Vance,\" she sighed, \"a great many people say that I'm a hard woman. I suppose I am. And I like to look facts squarely in the face. Your prospects begin with my death, of course.\"  He had no answer, but bit his lip nervously and wished the ordeal would come to an end.  \"Vance,\" she went on, \"I'm glad to have this talk with you. It's something you have to know. Of course I'll see that during my life or my death you'll be provided for. But as for your main prospects, do you know where they are?\"  \"Well?\"  She was needlessly brutal about it, but as she had told him, her education had been one of pain.  \"Your prospects are down there by the river on the back of Le Sangre.\"  Vance Cornish gasped.  \"I'll show you what I mean, Vance. Come along.\"  The moment she rose, some of her age fell from her. Her carriage was erect. Her step was still full of spring and decision, as she led the way into the house. It was a big, solid, two-story building which the mightiest wind could not shake. Henry Cornish had merely founded the house, just as he had founded the ranch; the main portion of the work had been done by his daughter. And as they passed through, her stern old eye rested peacefully on the deep, shadowy vistas, and her foot fell with just pride on the splendid rising sweep of the staircase. They passed into the roomy vault of the upper hall and went down to the end. She took out a big key from her pocket and fitted it into the lock; then Vance dropped his hand on her arm. His voice lowered.  \"You've made a mistake, Elizabeth. This is Father's room.\"  Ever since his death it had been kept unchanged, and practically unentered save for an occasional rare day of work to keep it in order. Now she nodded and resolutely turned the key and swung the door open. Vance went in with an exclamation of wonder. It was quite changed from the solemn old room and the brown, varnished woodwork which he remembered. Cream-tinted paint now made the walls cool and fresh. The solemn engravings no longer hung above the bookcases. And the bookcases themselves had been replaced with built-in shelves pleasantly filled with rich bindings, black and red and deep yellow-browns. A tall cabinet stood open at one side filled with rifles and shotguns of every description, and another cabinet was loaded with fishing apparatus. The stiff-backed chairs had given place to comfortable monsters of easy lines. Vance Cornish, as one in a dream, peered here and there.  \"God bless us!\" he kept repeating. \"God bless us! But where's there a trace of Father?\"  \"I left it out,\" said Elizabeth huskily, \"because this room is meant for--but let's go back. Do you remember that day twenty-four years ago when we took Jack Hollis's baby?\"  \"When _you_ took it,\" he corrected. \"I disclaim all share in the idea.\"  \"Thank you,\" she answered proudly. \"At any rate, I took the boy and called him Terence Colby.\"  \"Why that name,\" muttered Vance, \"I never could understand.\"  \"Haven't I told you? No, and I hardly know whether to trust even you with the secret, Vance. But you remember we argued about it, and you said that blood would out; that the boy would turn out wrong; that before he was twenty-five he would have shot a man?\"  \"I believe the talk ran like that.\"  \"Well, Vance, I started out with a theory; but the moment I had that baby in my arms, it became a matter of theory, plus, and chiefly plus. I kept remembering what you had said, and I was afraid. That was why I worked up the Colby idea.\"  \"That's easy to see.\"  \"It wasn't so easy to do. But I heard of the last of an old Virginia family who had died of consumption in Arizona. I traced his family. He was the last of it. Then it was easy to arrange a little story: Terence Colby had married a girl in Arizona, died shortly after; the girl died also, and I took the baby. Nobody can disprove what I say. There's not a living soul who knows that Terence is the son of Jack Hollis--except you and me.\"  \"How about the woman I got the baby from?\"  \"I bought her silence until fifteen years ago. Then she died, and now Terry is convinced that he is the last representative of the Colby family.\"  She laughed with excitement and beckoned him out of the room and into another--Terry's room, farther down the hall. She pointed to a large photograph of a solemn-faced man on the wall. \"You see that?\"  \"Who is it?\"  \"I got it when I took Terry to Virginia last winter--to see the old family estate and go over the ground of the historic Colbys.\"  She laughed again happily.  \"Terry was wild with enthusiasm. He read everything he could lay his hands on about the Colbys. Discovered the year they landed in Virginia; how they fought in the Revolution; how they fought and died in the Civil War. Oh, he knows every landmark in the history of 'his' family. Of course, I encouraged him.\"  \"I know,\" chuckled Vance. \"Whenever he gets in a pinch, I've heard you say: 'Terry, what should a Colby do?'\"  \"And,\" cut in Elizabeth, \"you must admit that it has worked. There isn't a prouder, gentler, cleaner-minded boy in the world than Terry. Not blood. It's the blood of Jack Hollis. But it's what he thinks himself to be that counts. And now, Vance, admit that your theory is exploded.\"  He shook his head.  \"Terry will do well enough. But wait till the pinch comes. You don't know how he'll turn out when the rub comes. _Then_ blood will tell!\"  She shrugged her shoulders angrily.  \"You're simply being perverse now, Vance. At any rate, that picture is one of Terry's old 'ancestors,' Colonel Vincent Colby, of prewar days. Terry has discovered family resemblances, of course--same black hair, same black eyes, and a great many other things.\"  \"But suppose he should ever learn the truth?\" murmured Vance.  She caught her breath.  \"That would be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],["title","The Last Trail (#1)"],["body","found us. I take it you are from Fort Henry, and will guide us there? I am an old friend of Colonel Zane's. He will appreciate any kindness you may show us. Of course you know him?\"  \"I am Jonathan Zane.\"  Sheppard suddenly realized that he was facing the most celebrated scout on the border. In Revolutionary times Zane's fame had extended even to the far Atlantic Colonies.  \"And your companion?\" asked Sheppard with keen interest. He guessed what might be told. Border lore coupled Jonathan Zane with a strange and terrible character, a border Nemesis, a mysterious, shadowy, elusive man, whom few pioneers ever saw, but of whom all knew.  \"Wetzel,\" answered Zane.  With one accord the travelers gazed curiously at Zane's silent companion. In the dim background of the glow cast by the fire, he stood a gigantic figure, dark, quiet, and yet with something intangible in his shadowy outline.  Suddenly he appeared to merge into the gloom as if he really were a phantom. A warning, \"Hist!\" came from the bushes.  With one swift kick Zane scattered the camp-fire.  The travelers waited with bated breaths. They could hear nothing save the beating of their own hearts; they could not even see each other.  \"Better go to sleep,\" came in Zane's calm voice. What a relief it was! \"We'll keep watch, an' at daybreak guide you to Fort Henry.\"     CHAPTER II  Colonel Zane, a rugged, stalwart pioneer, with a strong, dark face, sat listening to his old friend's dramatic story. At its close a genial smile twinkled in his fine dark eyes.  \"Well, well, Sheppard, no doubt it was a thrilling adventure to you,\" he said. \"It might have been a little more interesting, and doubtless would, had I not sent Wetzel and Jonathan to look you up.\"  \"You did? How on earth did you know I was on the border? I counted much on the surprise I should give you.\"  \"My Indian runners leave Fort Pitt ahead of any travelers, and acquaint me with particulars.\"  \"I remembered a fleet-looking Indian who seemed to be asking for information about us, when we arrived at Fort Pitt. I am sorry I did not take the fur-trader's advice in regard to the guide. But I was in such a hurry to come, and didn't feel able to bear the expense of a raft or boat that we might come by river. My nephew brought considerable gold, and I all my earthly possessions.\"  \"All's well that ends well,\" replied Colonel Zane cheerily. \"But we must thank Providence that Wetzel and Jonathan came up in the nick of time.\"  \"Indeed, yes. I'm not likely to forget those fierce savages. How they slipped off into the darkness! I wonder if Wetzel pursued them? He disappeared last night, and we did not see him again. In fact we hardly had a fair look at him. I question if I should recognize him now, unless by his great stature.\"  \"He was ahead of Jonathan on the trail. That is Wetzel's way. In times of danger he is seldom seen, yet is always near. But come, let us go out and look around. I am running up a log cabin which will come in handy for you.\"  They passed out into the shade of pine and maples. A winding path led down a gentle slope. On the hillside under a spreading tree a throng of bearded pioneers, clad in faded buckskins and wearing white-ringed coonskin caps, were erecting a log cabin.  \"Life here on the border is keen, hard, invigorating,\" said Colonel Zane. \"I tell you, George Sheppard, in spite of your gray hair and your pretty daughter, you have come out West because you want to live among men who do things.\"  \"Colonel, I won't gainsay I've still got hot blood,\" replied Sheppard; \"but I came to Fort Henry for land. My old home in Williamsburg has fallen into ruin together with the fortunes of my family. I brought my daughter and my nephew because I wanted them to take root in new soil.\"  \"Well, George, right glad we are to have you. Where are your sons? I remember them, though 'tis sixteen long years since I left old Williamsburg.\"  \"Gone. The Revolution took my sons. Helen is the last of the family.\"  \"Well, well, indeed that's hard. Independence has cost you colonists as big a price as border-freedom has us pioneers. Come, old friend, forget the past. A new life begins for you here, and it will be one which gives you much. See, up goes a cabin; that will soon be your home.\"  Sheppard's eye marked the sturdy pioneers and a fast diminishing pile of white-oak logs.  \"Ho-heave!\" cried a brawny foreman.  A dozen stout shoulders sagged beneath a well-trimmed log.  \"Ho-heave!\" yelled the foreman.  \"See, up she goes,\" cried the colonel, \"and to-morrow night she'll shed rain.\"  They walked down a sandy lane bounded on the right by a wide, green clearing, and on the left by a line of chestnuts and maples, outposts of the thick forests beyond.  \"Yours is a fine site for a house,\" observed Sheppard, taking in the clean-trimmed field that extended up the hillside, a brook that splashed clear and noisy over the stones to tarry in a little grass-bound lake which forced water through half-hollowed logs into a spring house.  \"I think so; this is the fourth time I've put up a' cabin on this land,\" replied the colonel.  \"How's that?\"  \"The redskins are keen to burn things.\"  Sheppard laughed at the pioneer's reply. \"It's not difficult, Colonel Zane, to understand why Fort Henry has stood all these years, with you as its leader. Certainly the location for your cabin is the finest in the settlement. What a view!\"  High upon a bluff overhanging the majestic, slow-winding Ohio, the colonel's cabin afforded a commanding position from which to view the picturesque valley. Sheppard's eye first caught the outline of the huge, bold, time-blackened fort which frowned protectingly over surrounding log-cabins; then he saw the wide-sweeping river with its verdant islands, golden, sandy bars, and willow-bordered shores, while beyond, rolling pastures of wavy grass merging into green forests that swept upward with slow swell until lost in the dim purple of distant mountains.  \"Sixteen years ago I came out of the thicket upon yonder bluff, and saw this valley. I was deeply impressed by its beauty, but more by its wonderful promise.\"  \"Were you alone?\"  \"I and my dog. There had been a few white men before me on the river; but I was the first to see this glorious valley from the bluff. Now, George, I'll let you have a hundred acres of well-cleared land. The soil is so rich you can raise two crops in one season. With some stock, and a few good hands, you'll soon be a busy man.\"  \"I didn't expect so much land; I can't well afford to pay for it.\"  \"Talk to me of payment when the farm yields an income. Is this young nephew of yours strong and willing?\"  \"He is, and has gold enough to buy a big farm.\"  \"Let him keep his money, and make a comfortable home for some good lass. We marry our young people early out here. And your daughter, George, is she fitted for this hard border life?\"  \"Never fear for Helen.\"  \"The brunt of this pioneer work falls on our women. God bless them, how heroic they've been! The life here is rough for a man, let alone a woman. But it is a man's game. We need girls, girls who will bear strong men. Yet I am always saddened when I see one come out on the border.\"  \"I think I knew what I was bringing Helen to, and she didn't flinch,\" said Sheppard, somewhat surprised at the tone in which the colonel spoke.  \"No one knows until he has lived on the border. Well, well, all this is discouraging to you. Ah! here is Miss Helen with my sister.\"  The colonel's fine, dark face lost its sternness, and brightened with a smile.  \"I hope you rested well after your long ride.\"  \"I am seldom tired, and I have been made most comfortable. I thank you and your sister,\" replied the girl, giving Colonel Zane her hand, and including both him and his sister in her grateful glance.  The colonel's sister was a slender, handsome young woman, whose dark beauty showed to most effective advantage by the contrast with her companion's fair skin, golden hair, and blue eyes.  Beautiful as was Helen Sheppard, it was her eyes that held Colonel Zane irresistibly. They were unusually large, of a dark purple-blue that changed, shaded, shadowed with her every thought.  \"Come, let us walk,\" Colonel Zane said abruptly, and, with Mr. Sheppard, followed the girls down the path. He escorted them to the fort, showed a long room with little squares cut in the rough-hewn logs, many bullet holes, fire-charred timbers, and dark stains, terribly suggestive of the pain and heroism which the defense of that rude structure had cost.  Under Helen's eager questioning Colonel Zane yielded to his weakness for story-telling, and recited the history of the last siege of Fort Henry; how the renegade Girty swooped down upon the settlement with hundreds of Indians and British soldiers; how for three days of whistling bullets, flaming arrows, screeching demons, fire, smoke, and attack following attack, the brave defenders stood at their posts, there to die before yielding.  \"Grand!\" breathed Helen, and her eyes glowed. \"It was then Betty Zane ran with the powder? Oh! I've heard the story.\"  \"Let my sister tell you of that,\" said the colonel, smiling.  \"You! Was it you?\" And Helen's eyes glowed brighter with the light of youth's glory in great deeds.  \"My sister has been wedded and widowed since then,\" said Colonel Zane, reading in Helen's earnest scrutiny of his sister's calm, sad face a wonder if this quiet woman could be the fearless and famed Elizabeth Zane.  Impulsively Helen's hand closed softly over her companion's. Out of the girlish sympathetic action a warm friendship was born.  \"I imagine things do happen here,\" said Mr. Sheppard, hoping to hear more from Colonel Zane.  The colonel smiled grimly.  \"Every summer during fifteen years has been a bloody one on the border. The sieges of Fort Henry, and Crawford's defeat, the biggest things we ever knew out here, are matters of history; of course you are familiar with them. But the numberless Indian forays and attacks,"]]]
