I have helped a good many young men through adventures that looked difficult enough beforehand.  Perhaps you may have heard of me.  I have more names than one; but the name of Quicksilver suits me as well as any other.  Tell me what your trouble is, and we will talk the matter over, and see what can be done.”  The stranger’s words and manner put Perseus into quite a different mood from his former one.  He resolved to tell Quicksilver all his difficulties, since he could not easily be worse off than he already was, and, very possibly, his new friend might give him some advice that would turn out well in the end.  So he let the stranger know, in few words, precisely what the case was;--how that King Polydeetes wanted the head of Medusa with the snaky locks as a bridal gift for the beautiful Princess Hippodamia, and how that he had undertaken to get it for him, but was afraid of being turned into stone.  “And that would be a great pity,” said Quicksilver, with his mischievous smile.  “You would make a very handsome marble statue, it is true, and it would be a considerable number of centuries before you crumbled away; but, on the whole, one would rather be a young man for a few years, than a stone image for a great many.”  “O, far rather!” exclaimed Perseus, with the tears again standing in his eyes.  “And, besides, what would my dear mother do, if her beloved son were turned into a stone?”  “Well, well; let us hope that the affair will not turn out so very badly,” replied Quicksilver, in an encouraging tone.  “I am the very person to help you, if anybody can.  My sister and myself will do our utmost to bring you safe through the adventure, ugly as it now looks.”  “Your sister?” repeated Perseus.  “Yes, my sister,” said the stranger.  “She is very wise, I promise you; and as for myself, I generally have all my wits about me, such as they are.  If you show yourself bold and cautious, and follow our advice, you need not fear being a stone image yet awhile.  But, first of all, you must polish your shield, till you can see your face in it as distinctly as in a mirror.”  This seemed to Perseus rather an odd beginning of the adventure; for he thought it of far more consequence that the shield should be strong enough to defend him from the Gorgon’s brazen claws, than that it should be bright enough to show him the reflection of his face.  However, concluding that Quicksilver knew better than himself, he immediately set to work, and scrubbed the shield with so much diligence and good-will, that it very quickly shone like the moon at harvest-time.  Quicksilver looked at it with a smile, and nodded his approbation.  Then, taking off his own short and crooked sword, he girded it about Perseus, instead of the one which he had before worn.  “No sword but mine will answer your purpose,” observed he; “the blade has a most excellent temper, and will cut through iron and brass as easily as through the slenderest twig.  And now we will set out.  The next thing is to find the Three Gray Women, who will tell us where to find the Nymphs.”  “The Three Gray Women!” cried Perseus, to whom this seemed only a new difficulty in the path of his adventure; “pray, who may the Three Gray Women be? I never heard of them before.”  “They are three very strange old ladies,” said Quicksilver, laughing. “They have but one eye among them, and only one tooth.  Moreover, you must find them out by starlight, or in the dusk of the evening; for they never show themselves by the light either of the sun or moon.”  “But,” said Perseus, “why should I waste my time with these Three Gray Women?  Would it not be better to set out at once in search of the terrible Gorgons?”  “No, no,” answered his friend.  “There are other things to be done, before you can find your way to the Gorgons.  There is nothing for it but to hunt up these old ladies; and when we meet with them, you may be sure that the Gorgons are not a great way off.  Come, let us be stirring!”  Perseus, by this time, felt so much confidence in his companion’s sagacity, that he made no more objections, and professed himself ready to begin the adventure immediately.  They accordingly set out, and walked at a pretty brisk pace; so brisk, indeed, that Perseus found it rather difficult to keep up with his nimble friend Quicksilver.  To say the truth, he had a singular idea that Quicksilver was furnished with a pair of winged shoes, which, of course, helped him along marvellously. And then, too, when Perseus looked sideways at him, out of the corner of his eye, he seemed to see wings on the side of his head; although, if he turned a full gaze, there were no such things to be perceived, but only an odd kind of cap.  But, at all events, the twisted staff was evidently a great convenience to Quicksilver, and enabled him to proceed so fast, that Perseus, though a remarkably active young man, began to be out of breath.  “Here!” cried Quicksilver, at last,--for he knew well enough, rogue that he was, how hard Perseus found it to keep pace with him,--“take you the staff, for you need it a great deal more than I.  Are there no better walkers than yourself, in the island of Seriphus?”  “I could walk pretty well,” said Perseus, glancing slyly at his companion’s feet, “if I had only a pair of winged shoes.”  “We must see about getting you a pair,” answered Quicksilver.  But the staff helped Perseus along so bravely, that he no longer felt the slightest weariness.  In fact, the stick seemed to be alive in his hand, and to lend some of its life to Perseus.  He and Quicksilver now walked onward at their ease, talking very sociably together; and Quicksilver told so many pleasant stories about his former adventures, and how well his wits had served him on various occasions, that Perseus began to think him a very wonderful person.  He evidently knew the world; and nobody is so charming to a young man as a friend who has that kind of knowledge.  Perseus listened the more eagerly, in the hope of brightening his own wits by what he heard.  At last, he happened to recollect that Quicksilver had spoken of a sister, who was to lend her assistance in the adventure which they were now bound upon.  “Where is she?” he inquired.  “Shall we not meet her soon?”  “All at the proper time,” said his companion.  “But this sister of mine, you must understand, is quite a different sort of character from myself. She is very grave and prudent, seldom smiles, never laughs, and makes it a rule not to utter a word unless she has something particularly profound to say.  Neither will she listen to any but the wisest conversation.”  “Dear me!” ejaculated Perseus; “I shall be afraid to say a syllable.”  “She is a very accomplished person, I assure you,” continued Quicksilver, “and has all the arts and sciences at her fingers’ ends. In short, she is so immoderately wise, that many people call her wisdom personified.  But, to tell you the truth, she has hardly vivacity enough for my taste; and I think you would scarcely find her so pleasant a travelling companion as myself.  She has her good points, nevertheless; and you will find the benefit of them, in your encounter with the Gorgons.”  By this time it had grown quite dusk.  They were now come to a very wild and desert place, overgrown with shaggy bushes, and so silent and solitary that nobody seemed ever to have dwelt or journeyed there.  All was waste and desolate, in the gray twilight, which grew every moment more obscure.  Perseus looked about him, rather disconsolately, and asked Quicksilver whether they had a great deal farther to go.  “Hist!  Hist!” whispered his companion.  “Make no noise!  This is just the time and place to meet the Three Gray Women.  Be careful that they do not see you before you see them; for, though they have but a single eye among the three, it is as sharp-sighted as half a dozen common eyes.”  “But what must I do,” asked Perseus, “when we meet them?”  Quicksilver explained to Perseus how the Three Gray Women managed with their one eye.  They were in the habit, it seems, of changing it from one to another, as if it had been a pair of spectacles, or--which would have suited them better--quizzing-glass.  When one of the three had kept the eye a certain time, she took it out of the socket and passed it to one of her sisters, whose turn it might happen to be, and who immediately clapped it into her own head, and enjoyed a peep at the visible world.  Thus it will easily be understood that only one of the Three Gray Women could see, while the other two were in utter darkness; and, moreover, at the instant when the eye was passing from hand to hand, neither of the poor old ladies was able to see a wink.  I have heard of a great many strange things, in my day, and have witnessed not a few; but none, it seems to me, that can compare with the oddity of these Three Gray Women, all peeping through a single eye.  So thought Perseus, likewise, and was so astonished that he almost fancied his companion was joking with him, and that there were no such old women in the world.  “You will soon find whether I tell the truth or no,” observed Quicksilver.  “Hark! hush! Hist! hist!  There they come, now!”  Perseus looked earnestly through the dusk of the evening, and there, sure enough, at no great distance off, he descried the Three Gray Women. The light being so faint, he could not well make out what sort of figures they were; only he discovered that they had long gray hair; and, as they came nearer, he saw that two of them had but the empty socket of an eye, in the middle of their foreheads.  But, in the middle of the third sister’s forehead, there was a very large, bright, and piercing eye, which sparkled like a great diamond in a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9256"],["title","The Paradise of Children (#1)"],["body","to him on the condition of his never opening it, that Pandora thought it best not to suggest it any more.  Still, however, she could not help thinking and talking about the box.  “At least,” said she, “you can tell me how it came here.”  “It was left at the door,” replied Epimetheus, “just before you came, by a person who looked very smiling and intelligent, and who could hardly forbear laughing as he put it down.  He was dressed in an-odd kind of a cloak, and had on a cap that seemed to be made partly of feathers, so that it looked almost as if it had wings.”  “What sort of a staff had he?” asked Pandora.  “O, the most curious staff you ever saw!”  cried Epimetheus.  “It was like two serpents twisting around a stick, and was carved so naturally that I, at first, bought the serpents were alive.”  “I know him,” said Pandora, thoughtfully.  “Nobody else has such a staff.  It was Quicksilver; and he brought one hither, as well as the box.  No doubt he intended it for me; and, most probably, it contains pretty dresses for me to wear, or toys for you and me to play with, or something very nice for us both to eat!”  “Perhaps so,” answered Epimetheus, turning away.  “But until Quicksilver comes back and tells us so, we have neither of us any right to lift the lid of the box.”  “What a dull boy he is!”  muttered Pandora, as Epimetheus left the cottage.  “I do wish he had a little more enterprise!”  For the first time since her arrival, Epimetheus had gone out without asking Pandora to accompany him.  He went to gather figs and grapes by himself, or to seek whatever amusement he could find, in other society than his little playfellow’s.  He was tired to death of hearing about the box, and heartily wished that Quicksilver, or whatever was the messenger’s name, had left it at some other child’s door, where Pandora would never have set eyes on it.  So perseveringly as she did babble about this one thing!  The box, the box, and nothing but the box!  It seemed as if the box were bewitched, and as if the cottage were not big enough to hold it, without Pandora’s continually stumbling over it, and making Epimetheus stumble over it likewise, and bruising all four of their shins.  Well, it was really hard that poor Epimetheus should have a box in his ears from morning till night; especially as the little people of the earth were so unaccustomed to vexations, in those happy days, that they knew not how to deal with them.  Thus, a small vexation made as much disturbance, then, as a far bigger one would, in our own times.  After Epimetheus was gone, Pandora stood gazing at the box.  She had called it ugly, above a hundred times; but, in spite of all that she had said against it, it was positively a very handsome article of furniture, and would have been quite an ornament to any room in which it should be placed.  It was made of a beautiful kind of wood, with dark and rich veins spreading over its surface, which was so highly polished that little Pandora could see her face in it.  As the child had no other looking-glass, it is odd that she did not value the box, merely on this account.  The edges and corners of the box were carved with most wonderful skill. Around the margin there were figures of graceful men and women, and the prettiest children ever seen, reclining or sporting amid a profusion of flowers and foliage; and these various objects were so exquisitely represented, and were wrought together in such harmony, that flowers, foliage, and human beings seemed to combine into a wreath of mingled beauty.  But here and there, peeping forth from behind the carved foliage, Pandora once or twice fancied that she saw a face not so lovely, or something or other that was disagreeable, and which stole the beauty out of all the rest.  Nevertheless, on looking more closely, and touching the spot with her finger, she could discover nothing of the kind.  Some face, that was really beautiful, had been made to look ugly by her catching a sideway glimpse at it.  The most beautiful face of all was done in what is called high relief, in the centre of the lid.  There was nothing else, save the dark, smooth richness of the polished wood, and this one face in the centre, with a garland of flowers about its brow.  Pandora had looked at this face a great many times, and imagined that the mouth could smile if it liked, or be grave when it chose, the same as any living mouth.  The features, indeed, all wore a very lively and rather mischievous expression, which looked almost as if it needs must burst out of the carved lips, and utter itself in words.  Had the mouth spoken, it would probably have been something like this:  “Do not be afraid, Pandora!  What harm can there be in opening the box? Never mind that poor, simple Epimetheus!  You are wiser than he, and have ten times as much spirit.  Open the box, and see if you do not find something very pretty!”  The box, I had almost forgotten to say, was fastened; not by a lock, nor by any other such contrivance, but by a very intricate knot of gold cord.  There appeared to be no end to this knot, and no beginning. Never was a knot so cunningly twisted, nor with so many ins and outs, which roguishly defied the skilfullest fingers to disentangle them.  And yet, by the very difficulty that there was in it, Pandora was the more tempted to examine the knot, and just see how it was made.  Two or three times, already, she had stooped over the box, and taken the knot between her thumb and forefinger, but without positively trying to undo it.  “I really believe,” said she to herself, “that I begin to see how it was done.  Nay, perhaps I could tie it up again, after undoing it.  There would be no harm in that, surely.  Even Epimetheus would not blame me for that.  I need not open the box, and should not, of course, without the foolish boy’s consent, even if the knot were untied.”  It might have been better for Pandora if she had had a little work to do, or anything to employ her mind upon, so as not to be so constantly thinking of this one subject.  But children led so easy a life, before any Troubles came into the world, that they had really a great deal too much leisure.  They could not be forever playing at hide-and-seek among the flower-shrubs, or at blind-man’s-buff with garlands over their eyes, or at whatever other games had been found out, while Mother Earth was in her babyhood.  When life is all sport, toil is the real play.  There was absolutely nothing to do.  A little sweeping and dusting about the cottage, I suppose, and the gathering of fresh flowers (which were only too abundant everywhere), and arranging them in vases,--and poor little Pandora’s day’s work was over.  And then, for the rest of the day, there was the box!  After all, I am not quite sure that the box was not a blessing to her in its way.  It supplied her with such a variety of ideas to think of, and to talk about, whenever she had anybody to listen!  When she was in good humor, she could admire the bright polish of its sides, and the rich border of beautiful faces and foliage that ran all around it.  Or, if she chanced to be ill-tempered, she could give it a push, or kick it with her naughty little foot.  And many a kick did the box--(but it was a mischievous box, as we shall see, and deserved all it got)--many a kick did it receive.  But, certain it is, if it had not been for the box, our active-minded little Pandora would not have known half so well how to spend her time as she now did.  For it was really an endless employment to guess what was inside.  What could it be, indeed?  Just imagine, my little hearers, how busy your wits would be, if there were a great box in the house, which, as you might have reason to suppose, contained something new and pretty for your Christmas or New-Year’s gifts.  Do you think that you should be less curious than Pandora?  If you were left alone with the box, might you not feel a little tempted to lift the lid?  But you would not do it. O, fie!  No, no!  Only, if you thought there were toys in it, it would be so very hard to let slip an opportunity of taking just one peep!  I know not whether Pandora expected any toys; for none had yet begun to be made, probably, in those days, when the world itself was one great plaything for the children that dwelt upon it.  But Pandora was convinced that there was something very beautiful and valuable in the box; and therefore she felt just as anxious to take a peep as any of these little girls, here around me, would have felt.  And, possibly, a little more so; but of that I am not quite so certain.  On this particular day, however, which we have so long been talking about, her curiosity grew so much greater than it usually was, that, at last, she approached the box.  She was more than half determined to open it, if she could.  Ah, naughty Pandora!  First, however, she tried to lift it.  It was heavy; quite too heavy for the slender strength of a child, like Pandora.  She raised one end of the box a few inches from the floor, and let it fall again, with a pretty loud thump.  A moment afterwards, she almost fancied that she heard something stir, inside of the box.  She applied her ear as closely as possible, and listened. Positively, there did seem to be a kind of stifled murmur, within!  Or was it merely the singing in Pandora’s ears? Or could it be the beating of her heart?  The child could not quite satisfy herself whether she had heard anything or no.  But, at all events, her curiosity was stronger than ever.  As she drew back her head, her eyes fell upon the knot of gold cord.  “It must have been a very ingenious person who tied this knot,” said Pandora to herself.  “But I think I could untie it, nevertheless.  I am resolved, at least, to find the two ends of the cord.”  So she took the golden knot in her fingers, and pried into its intricacies as sharply as she could.  Almost without intending it, or quite knowing what she was about, she was soon busily "]]]
