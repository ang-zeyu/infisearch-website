It was on both sides a marriage of love.  It is popularly said that a man uplifts a wife to his own rank: it as often happens that a woman uplifts her husband to the dignity of her own character.  Richard King rose greatly in public estimation after his marriage with Lady Janet.  She united to a sincere piety a very active and a very enlightened benevolence.  She guided his ambition aside from mere party politics into subjects of social and religious interest, and in devoting himself to these he achieved a position more popular and more respected than he could ever have won in the strife of party.  When the Government of which the elder Vane became a leading Minister was formed, it was considered a great object to secure a name as high in the religious world, so beloved by the working classes, as that of Richard King; and he accepted one of those places which, though not in the cabinet, confers the rank of Privy Councillor.  When that brief-lived Administration ceased, he felt the same sensation of relief that Vane had felt, and came to the same resolution never again to accept office, but from different reasons, all of which need not now be detailed.  Amongst them, however, certainly this: he was exceedingly sensitive to opinion, thin-skinned as to abuse, and very tenacious of the respect due to his peculiar character of sanctity and philanthropy.  He writhed under every newspaper article that had made \"the blameless King\" responsible for the iniquities of the Government to which he belonged. In the loss of office he seemed to recover his former throne.  Mr. King heard Graham's resolution with a grave approving smile, and his interest in the young man became greatly increased.  He devoted himself strenuously to the object of saving to Graham some wrecks of his paternal fortunes, and having a clear head and great experience in the transaction of business, he succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectations formed by the family solicitor.  A rich manufacturer was found to purchase at a fancy price the bulk of the estate with the palatial mansion, which the estate alone could never have sufficed to maintain with suitable establishments.  So that when all debts were paid, Graham found himself in possession of a clear income of about L500 a year, invested in a mortgage secured on a part of the hereditary lands, on which was seated an old hunting-lodge bought by a brewer.  With this portion of the property Graham parted very reluctantly.  It was situated amid the most picturesque scenery on the estate, and the lodge itself was a remnant of the original residence of his ancestors before it had been abandoned for that which, built in the reign of Elizabeth, had been expanded into a Trenthain-like palace by the last owner.  But Mr. King's argument reconciled him to the sacrifice.  \"I can manage,\" said the prudent adviser, \"if you insist on it, to retain that remnant of the hereditary estate which you are so loath to part with.  But how?  by mortgaging it to an extent that will scarcely leave you L50. a year net from the rents.  This is not all.  Your mind will then be distracted from the large object of a career to the small object of retaining a few family acres; you will be constantly hampered by private anxieties and fears; you could do nothing for the benefit of those around you,--could not repair a farmhouse for a better class of tenant, could not rebuild a labourer's dilapidated cottage.  Give up an idea that might be very well for a man whose sole ambition was to remain a squire, however beggarly. Launch yourself into the larger world of metropolitan life with energies wholly unshackled, a mind wholly undisturbed, and secure of an income which, however modest, is equal to that of most young men who enter that world as your equals.\"  Graham was convinced, and yielded, though with a bitter pang.  It is hard for a man whose fathers have lived on the soil to give up all trace of their whereabouts.  But none saw in him any morbid consciousness of change of fortune, when, a year after his father's death, he reassumed his place in society.  If before courted for his expectations, he was still courted for himself; by many of the great who had loved his father, perhaps even courted more.  He resigned the diplomatic career, not merely because the rise in that profession is slow, and in the intermediate steps the chances of distinction are slight and few, but more because he desired to cast his lot in the home country, and regarded the courts of other lands as exile.  It was not true, however, as Lemercier had stated on report, that he lived on his pen.  Curbing all his old extravagant tastes, L500 a year amply supplied his wants.  But he had by his pen gained distinction, and created great belief in his abilities for a public career.  He had written critical articles, read with much praise, in periodicals of authority, and had published one or two essays on political questions which had created yet more sensation.  It was only the graver literature, connected more or less with his ultimate object of a public career, in which he had thus evinced his talents of composition.  Such writings were not of a nature to bring him much money, but they gave him a definite and solid station.  In the old time, before the first Reform Bill, his reputation would have secured him at once a seat in Parliament; but the ancient nurseries of statesmen are gone, and their place is not supplied.  He had been invited, however, to stand for more than one large and populous borough, with very fair prospects of success; and, whatever the expense, Mr. King had offered to defray it.  But Graham would not have incurred the latter obligation; and when he learned the pledges which his supporters would have exacted, he would not have stood if success had been certain and the cost nothing.  \"I cannot,\" he said to his friends, \"go into the consideration of what is best for the country with my thoughts manacled; and I cannot be both representative and slave of the greatest ignorance of the greatest number.  I bide my time, and meanwhile I prefer to write as I please, rather than vote as I don't please.\"  Three years went by, passed chiefly in England, partly in travel; and at the age of thirty, Graham Vane was still one of those of whom admirers say, \"He will be a great man some day;\" and detractors reply, \"Some day seems a long way off.\"  The same fastidiousness which had operated against that entrance into Parliament, to which his ambition not the less steadily adapted itself, had kept him free from the perils of wedlock.  In his heart he yearned for love and domestic life, but he had hitherto met with no one who realized the ideal he had formed.  With his person, his accomplishments, his connections, and his repute, he might have made many an advantageous marriage.  But somehow or other the charm vanished from a fair face, if the shadow of a money-bag fell on it; on the other hand, his ambition occupied so large a share in his thoughts that he would have fled in time from the temptation of a marriage that would have overweighted him beyond the chance of rising.  Added to all, he desired in a wife an intellect that, if not equal to his own, could become so by sympathy,--a union of high culture and noble aspiration, and yet of loving womanly sweetness which a man seldom finds out of books; and when he does find it, perhaps it does not wear the sort of face that he fancies.  Be that as it may, Graham was still unmarried and heart-whole.  And now a new change in his life befell him.  Lady Janet died of a fever contracted in her habitual rounds of charity among the houses of the poor.  She had been to him as the most tender mother, and a lovelier soul than hers never alighted on the earth.  His grief was intense; but what was her husband's?--one of those griefs that kill.  To the side of Richard King his Janet had been as the guardian angel. His love for her was almost worship: with her, every object in a life hitherto so active and useful seemed gone.  He evinced no noisy passion of sorrow.  He shut himself up, and refused to see even Graham.  But after some weeks had passed, he admitted the clergyman in whom on spiritual matters he habitually confided, and seemed consoled by the visits; then he sent for his lawyer and made his will; after which he allowed Graham to call on him daily, on the condition that there should be no reference to his loss.  He spoke to the young man on other subjects, rather drawing him out about himself, sounding his opinion on various grave matters, watching his face while he questioned, as if seeking to dive into his heart, and sometimes pathetically sinking into silence, broken but by sighs.  So it went on for a few more weeks; then he took the advice of his physician to seek change of air and scene. He went away alone, without even a servant, not leaving word where he had gone.  After a little while he returned, more ailing, more broken than before.  One morning he was found insensible,--stricken by paralysis. He regained consciousness, and even for some days rallied strength. He might have recovered, but he seemed as if he tacitly refused to live. He expired at last, peacefully, in Graham's arms.  At the opening of his will it was found that he had left Graham his sole heir and executor.  Deducting government duties, legacies to servants, and donations to public charities, the sum thus bequeathed to his lost wife's nephew was two hundred and twenty thousand pounds.  With such a fortune, opening indeed was made for an ambition so long obstructed.  But Graham affected no change in his mode of life; he still retained his modest bachelor's apartments, engaged no servants, bought no horses, in no way exceeded the income he had posesssed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7738"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 02 (#2)"],["body","e.  He seemed, indeed, depressed rather than elated by the succession to a wealth which he had never anticipated.  Two children had been born from the marriage of Richard King: they had died young, it is true, but Lady Janet at the time of her own decease was not too advanced in years for the reasonable expectation of other offspring; and even after Richard King became a widower, he had given to Graham no hint of his testamentary dispositions.  The young man was no blood-relation to him, and naturally supposed that such relations would become the heirs.  But in truth the deceased seemed to have no blood- relations: none had ever been known to visit him; none raised a voice to question the justice of his will.  Lady Janet had been buried at Kensal Green; her husband's remains were placed in the same vault.  For days and days Graham went his way lonelily to the cemetery.  He might be seen standing motionless by that tomb, with tears rolling down his cheeks; yet his was not a weak nature,--not one of those that love indulgence of irremediable grief.  On the contrary, people who did not know him well said \"that he had more head than heart,\" and the character of his pursuits, as of his writings, was certainly not that of a sentimentalist.  He had not thus visited the tomb till Richard King had been placed within it.  Yet his love for his aunt was unspeakably greater than that which he could have felt for her husband.  Was it, then, the husband that he so much more acutely mourned; or was there something that, since the husband's death, had deepened his reverence for the memory of her whom he had not only loved as a mother, but honoured as a saint?  These visits to the cemetery did not cease till Graham was confined to his bed by a very grave illness,--the only one he had ever known.  His physician said it was nervous fever, and occasioned by moral shock or excitement; it was attended with delirium.  His recovery was slow, and when it was sufficiently completed he quitted England; and we find him now, with his mind composed, his strength restored, and his spirits braced, in that gay city of Paris; hiding, perhaps, some earnest purpose amid his participation in its holiday enjoyments.  He is now, as I have said, seated before his writing-table in deep thought.  He takes up a letter which he had already glanced over hastily, and reperuses it with more care.  The letter is from his cousin, the Duke of Alton, who had succeeded a few years since to the family honours,--an able man, with no small degree of information, an ardent politician, but of very rational and temperate opinions; too much occupied by the cares of a princely estate to covet office for himself; too sincere a patriot not to desire office for those to whose hands he thought the country might be most safely entrusted; an intimate friend of Graham's.  The contents of the letter are these:--       MY DEAR GRAHAM,--I trust that you will welcome the brilliant opening      into public life which these lines are intended to announce to you.      Vavasour has just been with me to say that he intends to resign his      seat for the county when Parliament meets, and agreeing with me that      there is no one so fit to succeed him as yourself, he suggests the      keeping his intention secret until you have arranged your committee      and are prepared to take the field.  You cannot hope to escape a      contest; but I have examined the Register, and the party has gained      rather than lost since the last election, when Vavasour was so      triumphantly returned.  The expenses for this county, where there      are so many outvoters to bring up, and so many agents to retain, are      always large in comparison with some other counties; but that      consideration is all in your favour, for it deters Squire Hunston,      the only man who could beat you, from starting; and to your      resources a thousand pounds more or less are a trifle not worth      discussing.  You know how difficult it is nowadays to find a seat      for a man of moderate opinions like yours and mine.  Our county      would exactly suit you.  The constituency is so evenly divided      between the urban and rural populations, that its representative      must fairly consult the interests of both.  He can be neither an      ultra-Tory nor a violent Radical.  He is left to the enviable      freedom, to which you say you aspire, of considering what is best      for the country as a whole.       Do not lose so rare an opportunity.  There is but one drawback to      your triumphant candidature.  It will be said that you have no      longer an acre in the county in which the Vanes have been settled so      long.  That drawback can be removed.  It is true that you can never      hope to buy back the estates which you were compelled to sell at      your father's death: the old manufacturer gripes them too firmly to      loosen his hold; and after all, even were your income double what it      is, you would be overhoused in the vast pile in which your father      buried so large a share of his fortune.  But that beautiful old      hunting-lodge, the Stamm Schloss of your family, with the adjacent      farms, can be now repurchased very reasonably.  The brewer who      bought them is afflicted with an extravagant son, whom he placed in      the--Hussars, and will gladly sell the property for L5,000 more than      he gave: well worth the difference, as he has improved the farm-      buildings and raised the rental.  I think, in addition to the sum      you have on mortgage, L3,000 will be accepted, and as a mere      investment pay you nearly three per cent.  But to you it is worth      more than double the money; it once more identifies your ancient      name with the county.  You would be a greater personage with that      moderate holding in the district in which your race took root, and      on which your father's genius threw such a lustre, than you would be      if you invested all your wealth in a county in which every squire      and farmer would call you \"the new man.\"  Pray think over this most      seriously, and instruct your solicitor to open negotiations with the      brewer at once.  But rather put yourself into the train, and come      back to England straight to me.  I will ask Vavasour to meet you.      What news from Paris?  Is the Emperor as ill as the papers      insinuate?  And is the revolutionary party gaining ground?       Your affectionate cousin,                                     ALTON.  As he put down this letter, Graham heaved a short impatient sigh.  \"The old Stamm Schloss,\" he muttered,--\"a foot on the old soil once more! and an entrance into the great arena with hands unfettered.  Is it possible!--is it?--is it?\"  At this moment the door-bell of the apartment rang, and a servant whom Graham had hired at Paris as a _laquais de place_ announced \"Ce Monsieur.\"  Graham hurried the letter into his portfolio, and said, \"You mean the person to whom I am always at home?\"  \"The same, Monsieur.\"  \"Admit him, of course.\"  There entered a wonderfully thin man, middle-aged, clothed in black, his face cleanly shaven, his hair cut very short, with one of those faces which, to use a French expression, say \"nothing.\"  It was absolutely without expression: it had not even, despite its thinness, one salient feature.  If you had found yourself anywhere seated next to that man, your eye would have passed him over as too insignificant to notice; if at a cafe, you would have gone on talking to your friend without lowering your voice.  What mattered it whether a _bete_ like that overheard or not?  Had you been asked to guess his calling and station, you might have said, minutely observing the freshness of his clothes and the undeniable respectability of his _tout ensemble_, \"He must be well off, and with no care for customers on his mind,--a ci-devant chandler who has retired on a legacy.\"  Graham rose at the entrance of his visitor, motioned him courteously to a seat beside him, and waiting till the _laquais_ had vanished, then asked, \"What news?\"  \"None, I fear, that will satisfy Monsieur.  I have certainly hunted out, since I had last the honour to see you, no less than four ladies of the name of Duval, but only one of them took that name from her parents, and was also christened Louise.\"  \"Ah--Louise!\"  \"Yes, the daughter of a perfumer, aged twenty-eight.  She, therefore, is not the Louise you seek.  Permit me to refer to your instructions.\"  Here M. Renard took out a note-book, turned over the leaves, and resumed, \"Wanted, Louise Duval, daughter of Auguste Duval, a French drawing- master, who lived for many years at Tours, removed to Paris in 1845, lived at No. 12, Rue de S---- at Paris for some years, but afterwards moved to a different guartier of the town, and died 1848, in Rue I----, No. 39.  Shortly after his death, his daughter Louise left that lodging, and could not be traced.  In 1849 official documents reporting her death were forwarded from Munich to a person (a friend of yours, Monsieur). Death, of course, taken for granted; but nearly five years afterwards, this very person encountered the said Louise Duval at Aix-la-Chapelle, and never heard nor saw more of her.  Demande submitted, to find out said Louise Duval or any children of hers born in 1848-9; supposed in 1852-3 to have one child, a girl, between four and five years old.  Is that right, Monsieur?\"  \"Quite right.\"  \"And this is the whole information given to me.  Monsieur on giving it asked me if I thought it desirable that he should commence inquiries at Aix-la-Chapelle, where Louise Duval was last seen by the person interested to discover her.  I reply, No; pains thrown away.  Aix-la- Chapelle is not a place where any Frenchwoman not settled there by marriage would remain.  Nor does it seem probable that the said Duval would venture to select for her residence Munich, a city in which she had contrived to obtain"]]]
