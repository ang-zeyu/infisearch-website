Your eggs are carried from the kitchen to the dining-room table on a plate.  Your milk is brought to you in a china mug. Then go to the store-room (if there is no store-room in your house go to the nearest Delicatessen store). You will see how all the things which we are supposed to eat tomorrow and next week and next year have been put away in jars and cans and other artificial containers which Nature did not provide for us but which man was forced to invent and perfect before he could be assured of his regular meals all the year around.  Even a gas-tank is nothing but a large pitcher, made of iron because iron does not break as easily as china and is less porous than clay. So are barrels and bottles and pots and pans. They all serve the same purpose--of providing us in the future with those things of which we happen to have an abundance at the present moment.  And because he could preserve eatable things for the day of need, man began to raise vegetables and grain and saved the surplus for future consumption.  This explains why, during the late Stone Age, we find the first wheat-fields and the first gardens, grouped around the settlements of the early pile-dwellers.  It also tells us why man gave up his habit of wandering and settled down in one fixed spot where he raised his children until the day of his death when he was decently buried among his own people.  [Illustration: PREHISTORIC MAN IS DISCOVERED.]  It is safe to say that these earliest ancestors of ours would have given up the ways of savages of their own accord if they had been left to their fate.  But suddenly there was an end to their isolation.  Prehistoric man was discovered.  A traveler from the unknown south-land who had dared to cross the turbulent sea and the forbidding mountain passes had found his way to the wild people of Central Europe.  On his back he carried a pack.  When he had spread his wares before the gaping curiosity of the bewildered natives, their eyes beheld wonders of which their minds had never dared to dream.  They saw bronze hammers and axes and tools made of iron and helmets made of copper and beautiful ornaments consisting of a strangely colored substance which the foreign visitor called \"glass.\"  And overnight the Age of Stone came to an end.  It was replaced by a new civilization which had discarded wooden and stone implements centuries before and had laid the foundations for that \"Age of Metal\" which has endured until our own day.  It is of this new civilization that I shall tell you in the rest of my book and if you do not mind, we shall leave the northern continent for a couple of thousand years and pay a visit to Egypt and to western Asia.  \"But,\" you will say, \"this is not fair. You promise to tell us about prehistoric man and then, just when the story is going to be interesting, you close the chapter and you jump to another part of the world and we must jump with you whether we like it or not.\"  I know. It does not seem the right thing to do.  Unfortunately, history is not at all like mathematics.  When you solve a sum you go from \"a\" to \"b\" and from \"b\" to \"c\" and from \"c\" to \"d\" and so on.  History on the other hand jumps from \"a\" to \"z\" and then back to \"f\" and next to \"m\" without any apparent respect for neatness and order.  There is a good reason for this.  History is not exactly a science.  It tells the story of the human race and most people, however much we may try to change their nature, refuse to behave with the regularity and the precision of the tables of multiplication.  No two men ever do precisely the same thing.  No two human brains ever reach exactly the same conclusion.  You will notice that for yourself when you grow up.  It was not different a few hundred centuries ago.  Prehistoric man, as I just told you, was on a fair way to progress.  He had managed to survive the ice and the snow and the wild animals and that in itself, was a great deal.  He had invented many useful things.  Suddenly, however, other people in a different part of the world entered the race.  They rushed forward at a terrible speed and within a very short space of time they reached a height of civilization which had never before been seen upon our planet. Then they set forth to teach what they knew to the others who had been less intelligent than themselves.  Now that I have explained this to you, does it not seem just to give the Egyptians and the people of western Asia their full share of the chapters of this book?    THE EARLIEST SCHOOL OF THE HUMAN RACE  We are the children of a practical age.  We travel from place to place in our own little locomotives which we call automobiles.  When we wish to speak to a friend whose home is a thousand miles away, we say \"Hello\" into a rubber tube and ask for a certain telephone number in Chicago.  At night when the room grows dark we push a button and there is light.  If we happen to be cold we push another button and the electric stove spreads its pleasant glow through our study.  On the other hand in summer when it is hot the same electric current will start a small artificial storm (an electric fan) which keeps us cool and comfortable.  We seem to be the masters of all the forces of nature and we make them work for us as if they were our very obedient slaves.  But do not forget one thing when you pride yourself upon our splendid achievements.  We have constructed the edifice of our modern civilization upon the fundament of wisdom that had been built at great pains by the people of the ancient world.  Do not be afraid of their strange names which you will meet upon every page of the coming chapters.  Babylonians and Egyptians and Chaldeans and Sumerians are all dead and gone, but they continue to influence our own lives in everything we do, in the letters we write, in the language we use, in the complicated mathematical problems which we must solve before we can build a bridge or a skyscraper.  And they deserve our grateful respect as long as our planet continues to race through the wide space of the high heavens.  These ancient people of whom I shall now tell you lived in three definite spots.  Two of these were found along the banks of vast rivers.  The third was situated on the shores of the Mediterranean.  The oldest center of civilization developed in the valley of the Nile, in a country which was called Egypt.  The second was located in the fertile plains between two big rivers of western Asia, to which the ancients gave the name of Mesopotamia.  The third one which you will find along the shore of the Mediterranean, was inhabited by the Phoenicians, the earliest of all colonizers and by the Jews who bestowed upon the rest of the world the main principles of their moral laws.  This third center of civilization is known by its ancient Babylonian name of Suri, or as we pronounce it, Syria.  The history of the people who lived in these regions covers more than five thousand years.  It is a very, very complicated story.  I can not give you many details.  I shall try and weave their adventures into a single fabric, which will look like one of those marvelous rugs of which you read in the tales which Scheherazade told to Harun the Just.    THE KEY OF STONE  Fifty years before the birth of Christ, the Romans conquered the land along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean and among this newly acquired territory was a country called Egypt.  The Romans, who are to play such a great role in our history, were a race of practical men.  They built bridges, they constructed roads, and with a small but highly trained army of soldiers and civil officers, they managed to rule the greater part of Europe, of eastern Africa and western Asia.  As for art and the sciences, these did not interest them very much. They regarded with suspicion a man who could play the lute or who could write a poem about Spring and only thought him little better than the clever fellow who could walk the tightrope or who had trained his poodle dog to stand on its hind legs. They left such things to the Greeks and to the Orientals, both of whom they despised, while they themselves spent their days and nights keeping order among the thousand and one nations of their vast empire.  When they first set foot in Egypt that country was already terribly old.  More than six thousand and five hundred years had gone by since the history of the Egyptian people had begun.  Long before any one had dreamed of building a city amidst the swamps of the river Tiber, the kings of Egypt had ruled far and wide and had made their court the center of all civilization.  While the Romans were still savages who chased wolves and bears with clumsy stone axes, the Egyptians were writing books, performing intricate medical operations and teaching their children the tables of multiplication.  This great progress they owed chiefly to one very wonderful invention, to the art of preserving their spoken words and their ideas for the benefit of their children and grandchildren.  We call this the art of writing.  We are so familiar with writing that we can not understand how people ever managed to live without books and newspapers and magazines.  But they did and it was the main reason why they made such slow progress during the first million years of their stay upon this planet.  They were like cats and dogs who can only teach their puppies and their kittens a few simple things (barking at a stranger and climbing trees and such things) and who, because they can not write, possess no way in which they can use the experience of their countless ancestors.  This sounds almost funny, doesn't it?  And why make such a fuss about so simple a matter?  But did you ever stop to think what happens when you write a letter?  Suppose that you are taking a trip in the mountains and you have seen a deer.  You want to tell this to your father who is in the city.  What do you do?

PREPARATIONS FOR THE TRIP.  The best time for us to visit Puerto Rico, then, is after the hurricane season, in the winter. January, February, and March are the favorite months of travelers.  But if we wish to celebrate the four hundred and seventh anniversary of the discovery of the island, we must go in November. It was the 17th day of this month that Columbus first visited Puerto Rico.  We will need to take our thinnest clothing for use on the island, but we should have light wraps for the cool evenings.  We should also go well provided with umbrellas, rubber overshoes, and rain coats, if we do not wish to spend many afternoons indoors.  Now the best way to reach Puerto Rico is not, as many people think, from Cuba. San Juan, the capital, is nearly as far from Havana as from New York.  We will take the steamer from New York that goes directly to San Juan. If the weather is good, we may expect to make the voyage in four days.         *       *       *       *       *   THE VOYAGE.   What a busy crowd it is through which we pass to the New York wharf! Dozens of large ships and hundreds of small vessels and sailboats crowd the harbor.  There is a large steamer just going out. It is loaded with hardware, kerosene, pine lumber, and codfish, and is probably bound for South America.  Crowds of people are going on deck with departing friends. Many of the friends have brought or sent flowers and steamer-letters, to be enjoyed by the travelers, during the voyage.  [Illustration: OUR OCEAN STEAMER.]  Now the bell sounds a warning to our visitors to say good-by. They leave the boat, and soon we are off. As we leave the harbor we listen to the band playing \"America\" and the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" and take the last glimpse of our native land which we shall have for a month.  It is not far from the dinner hour, so we now visit the dining-room for the purpose of securing our place at the table from the head steward.  We next secure a steamer chair, and have the deck steward place it in a comfortable, sheltered place on deck. It is well, before long, to visit our staterooms, and put our clothes and other belongings in order for the trip.  By the time this is done dinner is announced. Somehow we do not feel very hungry. The vessel rolls about so that we begin to feel dizzy. We think we would rather go to bed, and we try to do so, but find it rather difficult.  The stewardess comes in just then, and asks if she may help us. With her assistance we climb into our berths. Rock, rock, rock! If the boat would only be quiet one moment! We are very seasick by this time, and feel as if we never wish to eat another meal. The motion of the boat lulls us to sleep by and by, and the next thing we know it is morning.  The air in our stateroom seems close and \"stuffy,\" so we gladly leave it and go on deck, where we remain for the rest of the day. The steward serves our meals to us here, and we spend the time in our steamer chairs, watching the white-capped waves, the sea gulls over us, and the porpoises following the boat for food.  After the first day out we sail into smoother seas and warmer weather. We throw aside our wraps and put on lighter clothing. We also don broad shade-hats to protect our eyes from the glare of the light upon the water.  A favorable wind bears us southward to the tropical sea, which many people consider among the most beautiful things in the world.  The water of the Bahama sea is wonderful because of its clearness and its deep purple color. A cloud shadow changes the purple into emerald.  Looking down into the clear depths, we see the dolphins as distinctly as the birds overhead. Shoals of flying fish dart out of the water, their fins serving as sails for an instant; then they drop back again.  Many other new and interesting objects and scenes add to the pleasure of our voyage from the great northern metropolis to the capital of the island in the southern seas. These we can not tell about now.         *       *       *       *       *   SAN JUAN.   While we are learning of the plant and animal life about and beneath us, the good ship bears us swiftly on, and all too soon we are at our journey's end.  We seem hardly to have left the shadow of Liberty's towering torch in New York harbor, before the gray walls of Morro Castle appear above the horizon. Far out at sea, this massive stone fort with its beacon light attracts our attention.  Across the harbor entrance the white-capped waves rush furiously over each other in a mad race toward the shore. Passing through this narrow channel, the ship glides into the harbor under the guns of the two picturesque old forts which guard it, and we get our first glimpse of San Juan.  [Illustration: STATUE OF LIBERTY--NEW YORK HARBOR.]  Our first view of this beautiful old city fills us with anticipations of pleasure. We find that the ground upon which the city lies slopes upward from the calm, broad harbor to the forts that guard its heights.  Here and there a tall palm-tree rears its graceful head above the tops of the gayly colored buildings that glisten in the sunlight.  Our guide tells us that San Juan is one of the most perfectly fortified cities in the world. It is easy to believe this when, from the ocean and from the bay, we see the massive walls and battlements of the forts that guard the north and east.  We learn that they are cut from the solid rock which crowns the crest of the narrow peninsula. The steep walls of the vast castle of San Cristobal overshadow the whole city.  The city is built on an island, connected with the mainland by a bridge.  It is surrounded by a high, thick stone wall: that is, it was once upon a time; but the city is now extended far beyond the walls. Inside is the city proper, or old San Juan. Outside are the more modern buildings and the suburbs.  San Juan is not only the seat of government, but it is considered the first city of Puerto Rico in interest and in importance. Ponce, however, disputes this claim. It has the best harbor, and the best public buildings, churches and schools on the island.  The palace of the governor-general and the headquarters of the American administration we find located in San Juan.  Over thirty thousand people make their homes in this city, and a goodly number of them we find at the shore to meet our vessel. They do not wait for us to land. They come out to meet us.  Dusky natives in landing boats are soon alongside, and we learn to our surprise that our ship does not go to the dock. We are to go ashore in these small awning-covered boats. This is a new experience for us, but it is an old Spanish custom.  [Illustration: LANDING FROM OUR STEAMER AT SAN JUAN.]  The steward of the ship tells us that we may retain our rooms and use the ship as a hotel during the stay in port, going ashore for sight-seeing when we like.  We have heard that the hotels in San Juan are very poor; but of course we wish to see for ourselves what they are like, and so we decide to give them a trial.  We are in no hurry to seek the hotels, however. The streets of San Juan present so many novel sights to our wandering eyes that we wish to look about first.  STREET SCENES.  We have been told that we could walk all over the town in an hour, and we resolve to try it.  [Illustration: A STREET IN SAN JUAN.]  The streets are narrow and dark, but well paved and clean. They ought to be clean, for they are swept by hand every day. The sidewalks are so narrow that only two of us can walk abreast, so we take to the road. This is used as a highway for people as well as vehicles.  Naked little children of all ages and colors play about the streets and on the sidewalks. Colored men and women, smoking black cigars, saunter idly about. Street venders carrying their stores upon their heads or backs, or in large panniers upon tiny ponies, fill the air with cries announcing their wares.  Judging from the number of the venders of drinks we see on the streets, every one in San Juan is thirsty. We are, at any rate, and very delicious we find their ices and sherbets, their iced orange, lemon and strawberry waters, iced cherries, milk, coffee and chocolate.  [Illustration: DULCE (SWEETMEAT) SELLERS IN PUERTO RICO.]  Fruit sellers under the arcades and in stalls tempt us with their attractive wares; but the fruits are new and strange to us, and we hesitate about buying.  The hack drivers are asleep on closed carriages at the hack stand. Long lines of clumsy carts, with high wheels, rumble over the cobblestone pavements with a dreadful clatter.  In the open doorways of shops we see men and women manufacturing articles for sale. Some are making chairs, some shoes, some jewelry, some boxes, and, in one place, we see a number of workmen making coffins.  We are interested in observing that flags of different colors are used as signs, and that the walls are painted with brilliant pictures. In the quarter near the sea, the brandy stores, built of reeds, have round them swarms of beggars of every degree.  The laundry shop we find just outside the city, beside a large creek. A laundry not built by hands! Here women stand knee-deep in the stream, with the hot sun beating down upon their heads. They are doing their laundry work. The clothes are cleaned by soaking them in water and pounding them with stones. We wonder if there are any buttons left on the clothes after this treatment, and resolve not to trust our clothes to this laundry.  We note outside the city wall a broad concrete walk; along this walk seats, trees, and rude statues; and between the walk and the wall an ornamental garden.  Having now taken a general stroll, we will rest up preparatory to our visit to the points of special interest.  POINTS OF INTEREST IN SAN JUAN.
