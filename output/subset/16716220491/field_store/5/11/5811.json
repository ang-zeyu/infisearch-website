Straight it went, without an error,     And the target, bathed in blood,   Lurched, and lunged, and fell to _terra     Firma_, landing with a thud.    \"Bird of freedom,\" quoth the urchin,     With an unrelenting frown,   \"You shall decorate a perch in     The menagerie in town;   But of feathers quite a cluster     I shall first remove for Ma:   Thanks to you, she'll have a duster     For her precious _objets d'art_.\"    And THE MORAL is that pride is     The precursor of a fall.   Those beneath you to deride is     Not expedient at all.   Howsoever meek and humble     Your inferiors may be,   They perchance may make you tumble,     So respect them.  Q. E. D.           THE ICONOCLASTIC RUSTIC                  AND          THE APROPOS ACORN    Reposing 'neath some spreading trees,     A populistic bumpkin   Amused himself by offering these     Reflections on a pumpkin:   \"I would not, if the choice were mine,   Grow things like that upon a vine,   For how imposing it would be   If pumpkins grew upon a tree.\"    Like other populists, you'll note,     Of views enthusiastic,   He'd learned by heart, and said by rote     A creed iconoclastic;   And in his dim, uncertain sight   Whatever wasn't must be right,   From which it follows he had strong   Convictions that what was, was wrong.    As thus he sat beneath an oak     An acorn fell abruptly   And smote his nose: whereat he spoke     Of acorns most corruptly.   \"Great Scott!\" he cried. \"The Dickens!\" too,   And other authors whom he knew,   And having duly mentioned those,   He expeditiously arose.    Then, though with pain he nearly swooned,     He bathed his organ nasal   With arnica, and soothed the wound     With extract of witch hazel;   And surely we may well excuse   The victim if he changed his views:   \"If pumpkins fell from trees like that,\"   He murmured, \"Where would I be at?\"    Of course it's wholly clear to you     That when these words he uttered   He proved conclusively he knew     Which side his bread was buttered;   And, if this point you have not missed,   You'll learn to love this populist,   The only one of all his kind   With sense enough to change his mind.    THE MORAL: In the early spring   A pumpkin-tree would be a thing   Most gratifying to us all,   But how about the early fall?             THE UNUSUAL GOOSE                 AND       THE IMBECILIC WOODCUTTER    A woodcutter bought him a gander,     Or at least that was what he supposed,   As a matter of fact, 'twas a slander     As a later occurrence disclosed;   For they locked the bird up in the garret     To fatten, the while it grew old,   And it laid there a twenty-two carat     Fine egg of the purest of gold!    There was much unaffected rejoicing     In the home of the woodcutter then,   And his wife, her exuberance voicing,     Proclaimed him most lucky of men.   \"'Tis an omen of fortune, this gold egg,\"     She said, \"and of practical use,   For this fowl doesn't lay any old egg,     She's a highly superior goose.\"    Twas this creature's habitual custom,     This laying of superfine eggs,   And they made it their practice to dust 'em     And pack them by dozens in kegs:   But the woodcutter's mind being vapid     And his foolishness more than profuse,   In order to get them more rapid     He slaughtered the innocent goose.    He made her a gruel of acid     Which she very obligingly ate,   And at once with a touchingly placid     Demeanor succumbed to her fate.   With affection that passed the platonic     They buried her under the moss,   And her epitaph wasn't ironic     In stating, \"We mourn for our loss.\"    And THE MORAL: It isn't much use,     As the woodcutter found to be true,   To lay for an innocent goose     Just because she is laying for you.                THE RUDE RAT                 AND        THE UNOSTENTATIOUS OYSTER    Upon the shore, a mile or more     From traffic and confusion,   An oyster dwelt, because he felt     A longing for seclusion;   Said he: \"I love the stillness of     This spot. It's like a cloister.\"   (These words I quote because, you note,     They rhyme so well with oyster.)    A prying rat, believing that     She needed change of diet,   In search of such disturbed this much-     To-be-desired quiet.   To say the least, this tactless beast     Was apt to rudely roister:   She tapped his shell, and called him--well,     A name that hurt the oyster.    \"I see,\" she cried, \"you're open wide,     And, searching for a reason,   September's here, and so it's clear     That oysters are in season.\"   She smiled a smile that showed this style     Of badinage rejoiced her,   Advanced a pace with easy grace,     And _sniffed_ the silent oyster.    The latter's pride was sorely tried,     He thought of what he _could _say,   Reflected what the common lot     Of vulgar molluscs _would_ say;   Then caught his breath, grew pale as death,     And, as his brow turned moister,   Began to close, and nipped her nose!     Superb, dramatic oyster!    We note with joy that oi polloi,     Whom maidens bite the thumb at,   Are apt to try some weak reply     To things they should be dumb at.   THE MORAL, then, for crafty men     Is: When a maid has voiced her   Contemptuous heart, don't think you're smart,     But shut up--like the oyster.                 THE URBAN RAT                 AND             THE SUBURBAN RAT    A metropolitan rat invited     His country cousin in town to dine:   The country cousin replied, \"Delighted.\"     And signed himself, \"Sincerely thine.\"   The town rat treated the country cousin                        To half a dozen                          Kinds of wine.    He served him terrapin, kidneys devilled,     And roasted partridge, and candied fruit;   In Little Neck Clams at first they revelled,     And then in Pommery,  _sec_ and _brut_;   The country cousin exclaimed: \"Such feeding                        Proclaims your breeding                          Beyond dispute!\"    But just as, another bottle broaching,     They came to chicken _en casserole_   A ravenous cat was heard approaching,     And, passing his guest a finger-bowl,   The town rat murmured, \"The feast is ended.\"                       And then descended                         The nearest hole.    His cousin followed him, helter-skelter,     And, pausing beneath the pantry floor,   He glanced around at their dusty shelter     And muttered, \"This is a beastly bore.   My place as an epicure resigning,                       I'll try this dining                         In town no more.    \"You must dine some night at my rustic cottage;     I'll warn you now that it's simple fare:   A radish or two, a bowl of pottage,     And the wine that's known as _ordinaire_,   But for holes I haven't to make a bee-line,                        No prowling feline                          Molests me there.    \"You smile at the lot of a mere commuter,     You think that my life is hard, mayhap,   But I'm sure than you I am far acuter:     I ain't afraid of no cat nor trap.\"   The city rat could but meekly stammer,                        \"Don't use such grammar,                          My worthy chap.\"    He dined next night with his poor relation,     And caught dyspepsia, and lost his train,   He waited an hour in the lonely station,     And said some things that were quite profane.   \"I'll never,\" he cried, in tones complaining,                         \"Try entertaining                           That rat again.\"    It's easy to make a memorandum     About THE MORAL these verses teach:     _De gustibus non est disputandum;_     The meaning of which Etruscan speech   Is wheresoever you're hunger quelling                       Pray keep your dwelling                       In easy reach.           THE IMPECUNIOUS CRICKET                 AND            THE FRUGAL ANT    There was an ant, a spinster ant,     Whose virtues were so many   That she became intolerant     Of those who hadn't any:   She had a small and frugal mind     And lived a life ascetic,   Nor was her temperament the kind     That's known as sympathetic.    I skip details. Suffice to say     That, knocking at her wicket,   There chanced to come one autumn day     A common garden cricket   So ragged, poor, and needy that,     Without elucidation,   One saw the symptoms of a bat     Of several months' duration.    He paused beside her door-step, and,     With one pathetic gesture,   He called attention with his hand     To both his shoes and vesture.   \"I joined,\" said he, \"an opera troupe.     They suddenly disbanded,   And left me on the hostel stoop,     Lugubriously stranded.    \"I therefore lay aside my pride     And frankly ask for clothing.\"   \"Begone!\" the frugal ant replied.     \"I look on you with loathing.   Your muddy shoes have spoiled the lawn,     Your hands have soiled the fence, too.   If you need money, go and pawn     Your watch--if you have sense to.\"    THE MORAL is: Albeit lots   Of people follow Dr. Watts,   The sluggard, when his means are scant,   Should seek an uncle, not an ant!             THE PAMPERED LAPDOG                 AND           THE MISGUIDED ASS    A woolly little terrier pup     Gave vent to yelps distressing,   Whereat his mistress took him up     And soothed him with caressing,       And yet he was not in the least       What one would call a handsome beast.    He might have been a Javanese,     He might have been a Jap dog,   And also neither one of these,     But just a common lapdog,       The kind that people send, you know,       Done up in cotton, to the Show.    At all events, whate'er his race,     The pretty girl who owned him   Caressed his unattractive face     And petted and cologned him,       While, watching her with mournful eye,       A patient ass stood silent by.    \"If thus,\" he mused, \"the feminine     And fascinating gender   Is led to love, I, too, can win     Her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6438"],["title","Fables for the Frivolous (#2)"],["body","tender.\"       And then the poor, misguided chap       Sat down upon the lady's lap.    Then, as her head with terror swam,     \"This method seems to suit you,\"   Observed the ass, \"so here I am.\"     Said she, \"Get up, you brute you!\"       And promptly screamed aloud for aid:       No ass was ever more dismayed.  [Illustration: \"SAID SHE, 'GET UP, YOU BRUTE YOU!'\"]    They took the ass into the yard     And there, with whip and truncheon,   They beat him, and they beat him hard,     From breakfast-time till luncheon.       He only gave a tearful gulp,       Though almost pounded to a pulp.    THE MORAL is (or seems, at least,     To be): In etiquette you   Will find that while enough's a feast     A surplus will upset you.    _Toujours, toujours la politesse_, if       The quantity be not excessive.              THE VAINGLORIOUS OAK                 AND           THE MODEST BULRUSH    A bulrush stood on a river's rim,     And an oak that grew near by   Looked down with cold _hauteur_ on him,     And addressed him this way: \"Hi!\"   The rush was a proud patrician, and    He retorted, \"Don't you know,   What the veriest boor should understand,               That 'Hi' is low?\"    This cutting rebuke the oak ignored.     He returned, \"My slender friend,   I will frankly state that I'm somewhat bored     With the way you bow and bend.\"   \"But you quite forget,\" the rush replied,     \"It's an art these bows to do,   An art I wouldn't attempt if I'd                Such boughs as you.\"    \"Of course,\" said the oak, \"in my sapling days     My habit it was to bow,   But the wildest storm that the winds could raise     Would never disturb me now.   I challenge the breeze to make me bend,     And the blast to make me sway.\"   The shrewd little bulrush answered, \"Friend,                 Don't get so gay.\"    And the words had barely left his mouth     When he saw the oak turn pale,   For, racing along south-east-by-south,     Came ripping a raging gale.   And the rush bent low as the storm went past,     But stiffly stood the oak,   Though not for long, for he found the blast                 No idle joke.      *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    Imagine the lightning's gleaming bars,     Imagine the thunder's roar,   For that is exactly what eight stars     Are set in a row here for!   The oak lay prone when the storm was done,     While the rush, still quite erect,   Remarked aside, \"What under the sun                Could one expect?\"    And THE MORAL, I'd have you understand,     Would have made La Fontaine blush,   For it's this: Some storms come early, and                Avoid the rush!                  THE INHUMAN WOLF                    AND             THE LAMB SANS GENE    A gaunt and relentless wolf, possessed     Of a quite insatiable thirst,   Once paused at a stream to drink and rest,   And found that, bound on a similar quest,     A lamb had arrived there first.    The lamb was a lamb of a garrulous mind     And frivolity most extreme:   In the fashion common to all his kind,   He cantered in front and galloped behind.     And troubled the limpid stream.    \"My friend,\" said the wolf, with a winsome air,     \"Your capers I can't admire.\"   \"Go to!\" quoth the lamb. (Though he said not where,   He showed what he meant by his brazen stare     And the way that he gambolled higher.)    \"My capers,\" he cried, \"are the kind that are     Invariably served with lamb.   Remember, this is a public bar,   And I'll do as I please. If your drink I mar,     I don't give a tinker's ----.\"    He paused and glanced at the rivulet,     And that pause than speech was worse,   For his roving eye a saw-mill met,   And, near it, the word which should be set     At the end of the previous verse.    Said the wolf: \"You are tough and may bring remorse,     But of such is the world well rid.   I've swallowed your capers, I've swallowed your sauce,   And it's plain to be seen that my only course     Is swallowing you.\"  He did.    THE MORAL: The wisest lambs they are     Who, when they're assailed by thirst,   Keep well away from a public bar;   For of all black sheep, or near, or far,     The public bar-lamb's worst!              THE SYCOPHANTIC FOX                   AND            THE GULLIBLE RAVEN    A raven sat upon a tree,     And not a word he spoke, for   His beak contained a piece of Brie,     Or, maybe, it was Roquefort:       We'll make it any kind you please--       At all events, it was a cheese.    Beneath the tree's umbrageous limb     A hungry fox sat smiling;   He saw the raven watching him,     And spoke in words beguiling.       \"_J'admire_,\" said he, \"_ton beau plumage_.\"       (The which was simply persiflage.)    Two things there are, no doubt you know,     To which a fox is used:   A rooster that is bound to crow,     A crow that's bound to roost,       And whichsoever he espies      He tells the most unblushing lies.    \"Sweet fowl,\" he said, \"I understand     You're more than merely natty,   I hear you sing to beat the band     And Adelina Patti.       Pray render with your liquid tongue       A bit from 'Gotterdammerung.'\"    This subtle speech was aimed to please     The crow, and it succeeded:   He thought no bird in all the trees     Could sing as well as he did.       In flattery completely doused,       He gave the \"Jewel Song\" from \"Faust.\"  [Illustration: \"'_J'ADMIRE_,' SAID HE, '_TON BEAU PLUMAGE_'\"]    But gravitation's law, of course,     As Isaac Newton showed it,   Exerted on the cheese its force,     And elsewhere soon bestowed it.       In fact, there is no need to tell       What happened when to earth it fell.    I blush to add that when the bird     Took in the situation   He said one brief, emphatic word,     Unfit for publication.       The fox was greatly startled, but       He only sighed and answered \"Tut.\"    THE MORAL is: A fox is bound     To be a shameless sinner.   And also: When the cheese comes round     You know it's after dinner.       But (what is only known to few)       The fox is after dinner, too.             THE MICROSCOPIC TROUT                 AND        THE MACHIAVELIAN FISHERMAN    A fisher was casting his flies in a brook,     According to laws of such sciences,   With a patented reel and a patented hook     And a number of other appliances;   And the thirty-fifth cast, which he vowed was the last     (It was figured as close as a decimal),   Brought suddenly out of the water a trout     Of measurements infinitesimal.    This fish had a way that would win him a place     In the best and most polished society,   And he looked at the fisherman full in the face     With a visible air of anxiety:   He murmered \"Alas!\" from his place in the grass,     And then, when he'd twisted and wriggled, he   Remarked in a pet that his heart was upset     And digestion all higgledy-piggledy.    \"I request,\" he observed, \"to be instantly flung     Once again in the pool I've been living in.\"   The fisherman said, \"You will tire out your tongue.     Do you see any signs of my giving in?   Put you back in the pool? Why, you fatuous fool,     I have eaten much smaller and thinner fish.   You're not salmon or sole, but I think, on the whole,     You're a fairly respectable dinner-fish.\"    The fisherman's cook tried her hand on the trout     And with various herbs she embellished him;   He was lovely to see, and there isn't a doubt     That the fisherman's family relished him,   And, to prove that they did, both his wife and his kid     Devoured the trout with much eagerness,   Avowing no dish could compare with that fish,     Notwithstanding his singular meagreness.    And THE MORAL, you'll find, is although it is kind     To grant favors that people are wishing for,   Still a dinner you'll lack if you chance to throw back     In the pool little trout that you're fishing for;   If their pleading you spurn you will certainly learn     That herbs will deliciously vary 'em:   It is needless to state that a trout on a plate     Beats several in the aquarium.            THE CONFIDING PEASANT                 AND           THE MALADROIT BEAR    A peasant had a docile bear,     A bear of manners pleasant,   And all the love she had to spare     She lavished on the peasant:       She proved her deep affection plainly       (The method was a bit ungainly).    The peasant had to dig and delve,     And, as his class are apt to,   When all the whistles blew at twelve     He ate his lunch, and napped, too,       The bear a careful outlook keeping       The while her master lay a-sleeping.    As thus the peasant slept one day,     The weather being torrid,   A gnat beheld him where he lay     And lit upon his forehead,       And thence, like all such winged creatures,       Proceeded over all his features.    The watchful bear, perceiving that     The gnat lit on her master,   Resolved to light upon the gnat     And plunge him in disaster;       She saw no sense in being lenient       When stones lay round her, most convenient.    And so a weighty rock she aimed     With much enthusiasm:   \"Oh, lor'!\" the startled gnat exclaimed,     And promptly had a spasm:       A natural proceeding this was,       Considering how close the miss was.  [Illustration: AND SO A WEIGHTY ROCK SHE AIMED]    Now by his dumb companion's pluck,     Which caused the gnat to squall so,   The sleeping man was greatly struck     (And by the bowlder, also).       In fact, his friends who idolized him       Remarked they hardly recognized him.    Of course the bear was greatly grieved,     But, being just a dumb thing,   She only thought: \"I was deceived,     But still, I did hit _something!_\"       Which showed this masculine achievement       Had somewhat soothed her deep bereavement.    THE MORAL: If you prize your bones   Beware of females throwing stones.            THE   PRECIPITATE   COCK                 AND        THE   UNAPPRECIATED   PEARL    A rooster once pursued a worm     That lingered not to brave him,"]]]
