Once did I sit, thou bridegroom gay, at board as rich as thine,   And by my side as fair a bride, with all her charms, was mine.    \"'But time traced furrows on my face, and I grew silver hair'd,   For locks of brown, and cheeks of youth, she left this brow and beard;   Once rich, but now a palmer poor, I tread life's latest stage,   And mingle with your bridal mirth the lay of frozen age.'\"  The lady, moved at the doleful recollections which the palmer's song recalled, sent to him a cup of wine. The palmer, having exhausted the goblet, returned it, and having first dropped in the cup his nuptial ring, requested the lady to pledge her venerable guest.    \"The ring hath caught the lady's eye, she views it close and near,   Then might you hear her shriek aloud, 'The Moringer is here!'   Then might you see her start from seat, while tears in torrents fell,   But if she wept for joy or wo, the ladies best can tell.    \"Full loud she utter'd thanks to Heaven, and every saintly power,   That had restored the Moringer before the midnight hour;   And loud she utter'd vow on vow, that never was there bride,   That had like her preserved her troth, or been so sorely tried.    \"'Yes, here I claim the praise,' she said, 'to constant matrons due,   Who keep the troth, that they have plight, so stedfastly and true;   For count the term howe'er you will, so that you count aright,   Seven twelvemonths and a day are out when bells toll twelve to-night.'     \"It was Marstetten then rose up, his falchion there he drew,    He kneeled before The Moringer, and down his weapon threw;    'My oath and knightly faith are broke,' these were the words he said;    'Then take, my liege, thy vassal's sword, and take thy vassal's head.     \"The noble Moringer, he smiled, and then aloud did say,    'He gathers wisdom that hath roamed seven twelvemonths and a day,    My daughter now hath fifteen years, fame speaks her sweet and fair;    I give her for the bride you lose, and name her for my heir.     \"'The young bridegroom hath youthful bride, the old bridegroom the old,    Whose faith were kept till term and tide so punctually were told.    But blessings on the warder kind that oped my castle gate,    For had I come at morrow tide, I came a day too late.'\"  There is also, in the rich field of German romance, another edition of this story, which has been converted by M. Tieck (whose labours of that kind have been so remarkable) into the subject of one of his romantic dramas. It is, however, unnecessary to detail it, as the present author adopted his idea of the tale chiefly from the edition preserved in the mansion of Haighhall, of old the mansion-house of the family of Braidshaigh, now possessed by their descendants on the female side, the Earls of Balcarras. The story greatly resembles that of the Noble Moringer, only there is no miracle of St. Thomas to shock the belief of good Protestants. I am permitted, by my noble friends, the lord and lady of Haighhall, to print the following extract from the family genealogy.     Sir William Bradshaghe 2d    Sone to Sr John was a    great traveller and a    Souldyer and married    To    Mabell daughter and    Sole heire of Hugh    Noris de Haghe and    Blackrode and had issue    EN. 8. E 2.    of this Mabel is a story by tradition of undouted    verity that in Sr William Bradshage's absence    (being 10 yeares away in the wares) she    married a welsh kt. Sr William retorninge    from the wars came in a Palmers habit amongst    the Poore to haghe. Who when she saw &    congetringe that that he favoured her former    husband wept, for which the kt chasticed her    at wich Sr William went and made him selfe    Knawne to his Tennants in wch space the kt    fled, but neare to Newton Parke Sr William overtooke    him and slue him.

An: Dom: 1315.  There were many vestiges around Haighhall, both of the Catholic penances of the Lady Mabel, and the history of this unfortunate transaction in particular; the whole history was within the memory of man portrayed upon a glass window in the hall, where unfortunately it has not been preserved. Mab's Cross is still extant. An old ruinous building is said to have been the place where the Lady Mabel was condemned to render penance, by walking hither from Haighhall barefooted and barelegged for the performance of her devotions. This relic, to which an anecdote so curious is annexed, is now unfortunately ruinous. Time and whitewash, says Mr. Roby, have altogether defaced the effigies of the knight and lady on the tomb. The particulars are preserved in Mr. Roby's Traditions of Lancashire, [Footnote: A very elegant work, 2 vols. 1829. By J. Roby, M.R.S.L.] to which the reader is referred for further particulars. It does not appear that Sir William Braidshaigh was irreparably offended against the too hasty Lady Mabel, although he certainly showed himself of a more fiery mould than the Scottish and German barons who were heroes of the former tales. The tradition, which the author knew very early in life, was told to him by the late Lady Balcarras. He was so much struck with it, that being at that time profuse of legendary lore, he inserted it in the shape of a note to Waverley, the first of his romantic offences. Had he then known, as he now does, the value of such a story, it is likely that, as directed in the inimitable receipt for making an epic poem, preserved in the Guardian, he would have kept it for some future opportunity.  As, however, the tale had not been completely told, and was a very interesting one, and as it was sufficiently interwoven with the Crusades, the wars between the Welsh and the Norman lords of the Marches was selected as a period when all freedoms might be taken with the strict truth of history without encountering any well known fact which might render the narrative improbable. Perhaps, however, the period which vindicates the probability of the tale, will, with its wars and murders, be best found described in the following passage of Gryffyth Ap Edwin's wars.  \"This prince in conjunction with Algar, Earl of Chester, who had been banished from England as a traitor, in the reign of Edward the Confessor, marched into Herefordshire and wasted all that fertile country with fire and sword, to revenge the death of his brother Rhees, whose head had been brought to Edward in pursuance of an order sent by the King on account of the depredations which he had committed against the English on the borders. To stop these ravages the Earl of Hereford, who was nephew to Edward, advanced with an army, not of English alone, but of mercenary Normans and French, whom he had entertained in his service, against Gryffyth and Algar. He met them near Hereford, and offered them battle, which the Welsh monarch, who had won five pitched battles before, and never had fought without conquering, joyfully accepted. The earl had commanded his English forces to fight on horseback, in imitation of the Normans, against their usual custom; but the Welsh making a furious and desperate charge, that nobleman himself, and the foreign cavalry led by him, were so daunted at the view of them, that they shamefully fled without fighting; which being seen by the English, they also turned their backs on the enemy, who, having killed or wounded as many of them as they could come up with in their flight, entered triumphantly into Hereford, spoiled and fired the city, razed the walls to the ground, slaughtered some of the citizens, led many of them captive, and (to use the words of the Welsh Chronicle) left nothing in the town but blood and ashes. After this exploit they immediately returned into Wales, undoubtedly from a desire of securing their prisoners, and the rich plunder they had gained. The King of England hereupon commanded Earl Harold to collect a great army from all parts of the kingdom, and assembling them at Gloucester, advanced from thence to invade the dominions of Gryffyth in North Wales. He performed his orders, and penetrated into that country without resistance from the Welsh; Gryffyth and Algar returning into some parts of South Wales. What were their reasons for this conduct we are not well informed; nor why Harold did not pursue his advantage against them; but it appears that he thought it more advisable at this time to treat with, than subdue, them; for he left North Wales, and employed himself in rebuilding the walls of Hereford, while negotiations were carrying on with Gryffyth which soon after produced the restoration of Algar, and a peace with that king, not very honourable to England, as he made no satisfaction for the mischief he had done in the war, nor any submissions to Edward. Harold must doubtless have had some private and forcible motives to conclude such a treaty. The very next year the Welsh monarch, upon what quarrel we, know not, made a new incursion into England, and killed the Bishop of Hereford, the Sheriff of the county, and many more of the English, both ecclesiastics and laymen. Edward was counselled by Harold, and Leofrick, Earl of Mercia, to make peace with him again; which he again broke; nor could he be restrained by any means, from these barbarous inroads, before the year one, thousand and sixty-three; when Edward, whose patience and pacific disposition had been too much abused, commissioned Harold to assemble the whole strength of the kingdom, and make war upon him in his own country till he had subdued or destroyed him. That general acted so vigorously, and with so much celerity, that he had like to have surprised him in his palace: but just before the English forces arrived"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6490"],["title","The Betrothed (#2)"],["body","his gate, having notice of the danger that threatened him, and seeing no other means of safety, he threw himself with a few of his household into one of his ships which happened at the instant to be ready to sail and put to sea.\"--LYTTLETON'S _Hist. of England_, vol. ii. p. 338.  This passage will be found to bear a general resemblance to the fictitious tale told, in the Romance.  ABBOTSFORD, 1_st June_, 1832.     INTRODUCTION.  MINUTES OF SEDERUNT OF A GENERAL MEETING OF THE SHAREHOLDERS DESIGNING TO FORM A JOINT-STOCK COMPANY, UNITED FOR THE PURPOSE OF WRITING AND PUBLISHING THE CLASS OF WORKS CALLED THE WAVERLEY NOVELS,  HELD IN THE WATERLOO TAVERN, REGENT'S BRIDGE, EDINBURGH, 1_st June_, 1825.  [The reader must have remarked, that the various editions of the proceedings at this meeting were given in the public papers with rather more than usual inaccuracy. The cause of this was no ill- timed delicacy on the part of the gentlemen of the press to assert their privilege of universal presence wherever a few are met together, and to commit to the public prints whatever may then and there pass of the most private nature. But very unusual and arbitrary methods were resorted to on the present occasion to prevent the reporters using a right which is generally conceded to them by almost all meetings, whether of a political or commercial description. Our own reporter, indeed, was bold enough to secrete himself under the Secretary's table, and was not discovered till the meeting was well-nigh over. We are sorry to say, he suffered much in person from fists and toes, and two or three principal pages were torn out of his note-book, which occasions his report to break off abruptly. We cannot but consider this behaviour as more particularly illiberal on the part of men who are themselves a kind of gentlemen of the press; and they ought to consider themselves as fortunate that the misused reporter has sought no other vengeance than from the tone of acidity with which he has seasoned his account of their proceedings.--_Edinburgh Newspaper_.]  A meeting of the gentlemen and others interested in the celebrated publications called the Waverley Novels, having been called by public advertisement, the same was respectably attended by various literary characters of eminence. And it being in the first place understood that individuals were to be denominated by the names assigned to them in the publications in question, the Eidolon, or image of the author, was unanimously called to the chair, and Jonathan Oldbuck, Esq. of Monkbarns, was requested to act as Secretary.  The Preses then addressed the meeting to the following purpose:--  \"Gentlemen, I need scarcely remind you, that we have a joint interest in the valuable property which has accumulated under our common labours. While the public have been idly engaged in ascribing to one individual or another the immense mass of various matter, which the labours of many had accumulated, you, gentlemen, well know, that every person in this numerous assembly has had his share in the honours and profits of our common success. It is, indeed, to me a mystery, how the sharp-sighted could suppose so huge a mass of sense and nonsense, jest and earnest, humorous and pathetic, good, bad, and indifferent, amounting to scores of volumes, could be the work of one hand, when we know the doctrine so well laid down by the immortal Adam Smith, concerning the division of labour. Were those who entertained an opinion so strange, not wise enough to know, that it requires twenty pairs of hands to make a thing so trifling as a pin--twenty couple of dogs to kill an animal so insignificant as a fox?--\"  \"Hout, man!\" said a stout countryman, \"I have a grew-bitch at home will worry the best tod in Pomoragrains, before ye could say, Dumpling.\"  \"Who is that person?\" said the Preses, with some warmth, as it appeared to us.  \"A son of Dandy Dinmont's,\" answered the unabashed rustic. \"God, ye may mind him, I think!--ane o' the best in your aught, I reckon. And, ye see, I am come into the farm, and maybe something mair, and a whoen shares in this buik-trade of yours.\"  \"Well, well,\" replied the Preses, \"peace, I pray thee, peace. Gentlemen, when thus interrupted, I was on the point of introducing the business of this meeting, being, as is known to most of you, the discussion of a proposition now on your table, which I myself had the honour to suggest at last meeting, namely, that we do apply to the Legislature for an Act of Parliament in ordinary, to associate us into a corporate body, and give us a _personi standi in judicio_, with full power to prosecute and bring to conviction all encroachers upon our exclusive privilege, in the manner therein to be made and provided. In a letter from the ingenious Mr. Dousterswivel which I have received---\"  Oldbuck, warmly--\"I object to that fellow's name being mentioned; he is a common swindler.\"  \"For shame, Mr. Oldbuck,\" said the Preses, \"to use such terms respecting the ingenious inventor of the great patent machine erected at Groningen, where they put in raw hemp at one end, and take out ruffled shirts at the other, without the aid of hackle or rippling-comb--loom, shuttle, or weaver--scissors, needle, or seamstress. He had just completed it, by the addition of a piece of machinery to perform the work of the laundress; but when it was exhibited before his honour the burgomaster, it had the inconvenience of heating the smoothing-irons red-hot; excepting which, the experiment was entirely satisfactory. He will become as rich as a Jew.\"  \"Well,\" added Mr. Oldbuck, \"if the scoundrel--\"  \"Scoundrel, Mr. Oldbuck,\" said the Preses, \"is a most unseemly expression, and I must call you to order. Mr. Dousterswivel is only an eccentric genius.\"  \"Pretty much the same in the Greek,\" muttered Mr. Oldbuck; and then said aloud, \"and if this eccentric genius has work enough in singeing the Dutchman's linen, what the devil has he to do here?\"  \"Why, he is of opinion, that at the expense of a little mechanism, some part of the labour of composing these novels might be saved by the use of steam.\" There was a murmur of disapprobation at this proposal, and the words, \"Blown up,\" and \"Bread taken out of our mouths,\" and \"They might as well construct a steam parson,\" were whispered. And it was not without repeated calls to order, that the Preses obtained an opportunity of resuming his address.  \"Order!--Order! Pray, support the chair. Hear, hear, hear the chair!\"  \"Gentlemen, it is to be premised, that this mechanical operation can only apply to those parts of the narrative which are at present composed out of commonplaces, such as the love-speeches of the hero, the description of the heroine's person, the moral observations of all sorts, and the distribution of happiness at the conclusion of the piece. Mr. Dousterswivel has sent me some drawings, which go far to show, that by placing the words and phrases technically employed on these subjects, in a sort of framework, like that of the Sage of Laputa, and changing them by such a mechanical process as that by which weavers of damask alter their patterns, many new and happy combinations cannot fail to occur, while the author, tired of pumping his own brains, may have an agreeable relaxation in the use of his fingers.\"  \"I speak for information, Mr. Preses,\" said the Rev. Mr. Lawrence Templeton; \"but I am inclined to suppose the late publication of Walladmor to have been the work of Dousterswivel, by the help of the steam-engine.\" [Footnote: A Romance, by the Author of Waverley, having been expected about this time at the great commercial mart of literature, the Fair of Leipsic, an ingenious gentleman of Germany, finding that none such appeared, was so kind as to supply its place with a work, in three volumes, called Walladmor, to which he prefixed the Christian and surname at full length. The character of this work is given with tolerable fairness in the text. ]  \"For shame, Mr. Templeton,\" said the Preses; \"there are good things in Walladmor, I assure you, had the writer known any thing about the country in which he laid the scene.\"  \"Or had he had the wit, like some of ourselves, to lay the scene in such a remote or distant country that nobody should be able to back-speer [Footnote: Scottish for cross-examine him.] him,\" said Mr. Oldbuck.  \"Why, as to that,\" said the Preses, \"you must consider the thing was got up for the German market, where folks are no better judges of Welsh manners than of Welsh crw.\" [Footnote: The ale of the ancient British is called crw in their native language.]  \"I make it my prayer that this be not found the fault of our own next venture,\" said Dr. Dryasdust, pointing to some books which lay on the table. \"I fear the manners expressed in that 'Betrothed' of ours, will scarce meet the approbation of the Cymmerodion; I could have wished that Llhuyd had been looked into --that Powel had been consulted--that Lewis's History had been quoted, the preliminary dissertations particularly, in order to give due weight to the work.\"  \"Weight!\" said Captain Clutterbuck; \"by my soul, it is heavy enough already, Doctor.\"  \"Speak to the chair,\" said the Preses, rather peevishly.  \"To the chair, then, I say it,\" said Captain Clutterbuck, \"that 'The Betrothed' is heavy enough to break down the chair of John of Gaunt, or Cador-Edris itself. I must add, however, that, in my poor mind, 'The Talisman' goes more trippingly off.\" [Footnote: This was an opinion universally entertained among the friends of the author.]  \"It is not for me to speak,\" said the worthy minister of Saint Ronan's Well; \"but yet I must say, that being so long engaged upon the Siege of Ptolemais, my work ought to have been brought out, humble though it be, before any other upon a similar subject at least.\"  \"Your Siege, Parson!\" said Mr. Oldbuck, with great contempt; \"will you speak of your paltry prose-doings in my presence, whose great Historical Poem, in twenty"]]]
