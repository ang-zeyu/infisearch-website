Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket....  THE cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.  Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!  Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.  SHE sat there for FIVE HOURS.         *       *       *       *       *  I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.  The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.  AT length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.  The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.  He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.  He was looking for his son.  OLD Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.  He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the garden-house, scratching off a handful of fur.  The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.  WHEN old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the green-house, he locked the door.  Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.  Then he took out his nephew Peter.  THEN he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.  When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later, he observed several things which perplexed him.  It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the foot-marks were too ridiculously little!  Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up INSIDE the green-house, locking the door upon the OUTSIDE.  WHEN Peter got home, his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the rabbit-tobacco.  THE END     THE TALE OF THE FLOPSY BUNNIES  FOR ALL LITTLE FRIENDS OF MR. McGREGOR & PETER & BENJAMIN   IT is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is \"soporific.\"  _I_ have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then _I_ am not a rabbit.  They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!  WHEN Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy. They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.  I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were generally called the \"Flopsy Bunnies.\"  AS there was not always quite enough to eat,--Benjamin used to borrow cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.  SOMETIMES Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.  WHEN this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.  MR. McGREGOR'S rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two. One day--oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had \"shot\" into flower.  THE Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.  Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.  THE little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine. The blue-bottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.  (I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse with a long tail.)  SHE rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.  The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.  WHILE she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies! Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a jam pot.  THE little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.  They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.  Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them for some time.  PRESENTLY a fly settled on one of them and it moved.  Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap--  \"One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!\" said he as he dropped them into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up.  MR. McGREGOR tied up the sack and left it on the wall.  He went to put away the mowing machine.  WHILE he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came across the field.  She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?  THEN the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.  Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.  But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.  THE little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.  Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.  THEN they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.  MR. McGREGOR came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.  He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.  The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.  THEY watched him go into his house.  And then they crept up to the window to listen.  MR. McGREGOR threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it.  They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--  \"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!\" said Mr. McGregor.  \"EH? What's that? What have they been spoiling now?\" enquired Mrs. McGregor.  \"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!\" repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers--\"one, two, three--\"  \"Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?\"  \"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!\" replied Mr. McGregor.  (The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)  MRS. McGREGOR took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel six, but they must be OLD rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes.  \"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.\"  \"Line your old cloak?\" shouted Mr. McGregor--\"I shall sell them and buy myself baccy!\"  \"Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.\"  MRS. McGREGOR untied the sack and put her hand inside.  When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry. She said that Mr. McGregor had \"done it a purpose.\"  AND Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.  It was rather hurt.  THEN Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.  SO Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.  But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens.  THE END     IN REMEMBRANCE OF \"SAMMY,\" THE INTELLIGENT PINK-EYED REPRESENTATIVE OF A PERSECUTED (BUT IRREPRESSIBLE) RACE. AN AFFECTIONATE LITTLE FRIEND. AND MOST ACCOMPLISHED THIEF!  THE ROLY-POLY PUDDING   ONCE upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent. She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!  On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.  She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.  Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten. She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere.  It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages. Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night--especially cheese and bacon.  Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully.  While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief.  The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out.  They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.  They patted it with their little soft paws--\"Shall we make dear little muffins?\" said Mittens to Moppet.  But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.  Mittens ran away to the dairy, and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.  The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast.  Mrs. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully--\"Come in, Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/582"],["title","A Collection of Beatrix Potter Stories (#2)"],["body","own! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,\" said Tabitha, shedding tears. \"I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the rats have got him.\" She wiped her eyes with an apron.  \"He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea. Where have you looked for him?\"  \"All over the house! The rats are too many for me. What a thing it is to have an unruly family!\" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.  \"I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him too! What is all that soot in the fender?\"  \"The chimney wants sweeping--Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and Mittens are gone!\"  \"They have both got out of the cup-board!\"  Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in cupboards. They even fetched a candle, and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics. They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.  \"Yes, it is infested with rats,\" said Tabitha tearfully, \"I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old rat, Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.\"  \"The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,\" said Tabitha.  Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched. They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor. But there was nothing to be seen.  They returned to the kitchen. \"Here's one of your kittens at least,\" said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.  They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor. She seemed to be in a terrible fright.  \"Oh! Mother, Mother,\" said Moppet, \"there's been an old woman rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!\"  The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!  \"Which way did she go, Moppet?\"  But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.  Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search.  They went into the dairy.  The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar.  They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out.  \"Oh, Mother, Mother!\" said Mittens--  \"Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy--a dreadful 'normous big rat, Mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling-pin.\"  Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.  \"A rolling-pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas!\" exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws.  \"A rolling-pin?\" said Ribby. \"Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?\"  Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again. Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.  \"This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,\" said Ribby. \"We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw.\"  Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.  Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.  He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney.  The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up. It was a big old-fashioned fireplace.  The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about. So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.  He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs.  Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.  Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below. He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows.  \"I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket.\"  The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.  The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain.  Tom Kitten was getting very frightened! He climbed up, and up, and up.  Then he waded sideways through inches of soot. He was like a little sweep himself.  It was most confusing in the dark. One flue seemed to lead into another.  There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.  He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. There were some mutton bones lying about--  \"This seems funny,\" said Tom Kitten. \"Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell! It is something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,\" said Tom Kitten.  He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.  He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture.  All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags.  When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him--he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house.  It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster.  Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.  \"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?\" said the rat, chattering his teeth.  \"Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping,\" said poor Tom Kitten.  \"Anna Maria! Anna Maria!\" squeaked the rat. There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.  All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening--  His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots.  Anna Maria did the tying. The old rat watched her and took snuff. When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.  \"Anna Maria,\" said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers),--\"Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner.\"  \"It requires dough and a pat of butter, and a rolling-pin,\" said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side.  \"No,\" said Samuel Whiskers, \"make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs.\"  \"Nonsense! Butter and dough,\" replied Anna Maria.  The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.  Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter. He did not meet anybody.  He made a second journey for the rolling-pin. He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.  He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest.  They did not see him.  Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.  She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws.  She did not observe Moppet.  While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help.  But his mouth was full of soot and cob-webs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.  Except a spider, which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance.  It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue-bottles. It did not offer to assist him.  Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.  Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling. First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough.  \"Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?\" inquired Samuel Whiskers.  Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry. She laid hold of his ears.  Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling-pin went roly-poly, roly; roly, poly, roly. The rats each held an end.  \"His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.\"  \"I fetched as much as I could carry,\" replied Anna Maria.  \"I do not think\"--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten--\"I do NOT think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty.\"  Anna Maria was about to argue the point, when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!  The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively.  \"We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property,--and other people's,--and depart at once.\"  \"I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.\"  \"But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary.\"  \"Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane,\" said Anna Maria. \"I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney.\"  So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up--there was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!  But there was a"]]]
