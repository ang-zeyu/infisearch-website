(#1)"],["body"," Charleston, the hot-bed of secession in particular, ought to have a heavy hand laid upon them.  In fact, nothing but the decisive results that followed, deterred the radical portion of the people from condemning the movement, because Charleston had been left out.  To pass into the interior would, however, be to insure the evacuation of the city, and its possession by the navy and Foster's troops.  It is so situated between two formidable rivers that a small garrison could have held it against all odds as long as their supplies would hold out. Sherman therefore passed it by.  By the first of February all preparations were completed for the final march, Columbia, South Carolina, being the first objective; Fayetteville, North Carolina, the second; and Goldsboro, or neighborhood, the final one, unless something further should be determined upon.  The right wing went from Pocotaligo, and the left from about Hardeeville on the Savannah River, both columns taking a pretty direct route for Columbia.  The cavalry, however, were to threaten Charleston on the right, and Augusta on the left.  On the 15th of January Fort Fisher had fallen, news of which Sherman had received before starting out on his march.  We already had New Bern and had soon Wilmington, whose fall followed that of Fort Fisher; as did other points on the sea coast, where the National troops were now in readiness to co-operate with Sherman's advance when he had passed Fayetteville.  On the 18th of January I ordered Canby, in command at New Orleans, to move against Mobile, Montgomery and Selma, Alabama, for the purpose of destroying roads, machine shops, etc.  On the 8th of February I ordered Sheridan, who was in the Valley of Virginia, to push forward as soon as the weather would permit and strike the canal west of Richmond at or about Lynchburg; and on the 20th I made the order to go to Lynchburg as soon as the roads would permit, saying:  \"As soon as it is possible to travel, I think you will have no difficulty about reaching Lynchburg with a cavalry force alone.  From there you could destroy the railroad and canal in every direction, so as to be of no further use to the rebellion. * * * This additional raid, with one starting from East Tennessee under Stoneman, numbering about four or five thousand cavalry; one from Eastport, Mississippi, ten thousand cavalry; Canby, from Mobile Bay, with about eighteen thousand mixed troops--these three latter pushing for Tuscaloosa, Selma and Montgomery; and Sherman with a large army eating out the vitals of South Carolina--is all that will be wanted to leave nothing for the rebellion to stand upon.  I would advise you to overcome great obstacles to accomplish this.  Charleston was evacuated on Tuesday last.\"  On the 27th of February, more than a month after Canby had received his orders, I again wrote to him, saying that I was extremely anxious to hear of his being in Alabama.  I notified him, also, that I had sent Grierson to take command of his cavalry, he being a very efficient officer.  I further suggested that Forrest was probably in Mississippi, and if he was there, he would find him an officer of great courage and capacity whom it would be difficult to get by.  I still further informed him that Thomas had been ordered to start a cavalry force into Mississippi on the 20th of February, or as soon as possible thereafter. This force did not get off however.  All these movements were designed to be in support of Sherman's march, the object being to keep the Confederate troops in the West from leaving there.  But neither Canby nor Thomas could be got off in time.  I had some time before depleted Thomas's army to reinforce Canby, for the reason that Thomas had failed to start an expedition which he had been ordered to send out, and to have the troops where they might do something.  Canby seemed to be equally deliberate in all of his movements.  I ordered him to go in person; but he prepared to send a detachment under another officer.  General Granger had got down to New Orleans, in some way or other, and I wrote Canby that he must not put him in command of troops.  In spite of this he asked the War Department to assign Granger to the command of a corps.  Almost in despair of having adequate service rendered to the cause in that quarter, I said to Canby:  \"I am in receipt of a dispatch * * * informing me that you have made requisitions for a construction corps and material to build seventy miles of railroad.  I have directed that none be sent.  Thomas's army has been depleted to send a force to you that they might be where they could act in winter, and at least detain the force the enemy had in the West.  If there had been any idea of repairing railroads, it could have been done much better from the North, where we already had the troops.  I expected your movements to be co-operative with Sherman's last.  This has now entirely failed.  I wrote to you long ago, urging you to push promptly and to live upon the country, and destroy railroads, machine shops, etc., not to build them. Take Mobile and hold it, and push your forces to the interior--to Montgomery and to Selma. Destroy railroads, rolling stock, and everything useful for carrying on war, and, when you have done this, take such positions as can be supplied by water.  By this means alone you can occupy positions from which the enemy's roads in the interior can be kept broken.\"  Most of these expeditions got off finally, but too late to render any service in the direction for which they were designed.  The enemy, ready to intercept his advance, consisted of Hardee's troops and Wheeler's cavalry, perhaps less than fifteen thousand men in all; but frantic efforts were being made in Richmond, as I was sure would be the case, to retard Sherman's movements. Everything possible was being done to raise troops in the South.  Lee dispatched against Sherman the troops which had been sent to relieve Fort Fisher, which, including those of the other defences of the harbor and its neighborhood, amounted, after deducting the two thousand killed, wounded and captured, to fourteen thousand men.  After Thomas's victory at Nashville what remained, of Hood's army were gathered together and forwarded as rapidly as possible to the east to co-operate with these forces; and, finally, General Joseph E. Johnston, one of the ablest commanders of the South though not in favor with the administration (or at least with Mr. Davis), was put in command of all the troops in North and South Carolina.  Schofield arrived at Annapolis in the latter part of January, but before sending his troops to North Carolina I went with him down the coast to see the situation of affairs, as I could give fuller directions after being on the ground than I could very well have given without.  We soon returned, and the troops were sent by sea to Cape Fear River.  Both New Bern and Wilmington are connected with Raleigh by railroads which unite at Goldsboro.  Schofield was to land troops at Smithville, near the mouth of the Cape Fear River on the west side, and move up to secure the Wilmington and Charlotteville Railroad.  This column took their pontoon bridges with them, to enable them to cross over to the island south of the city of Wilmington.  A large body was sent by the north side to co-operate with them.  They succeeded in taking the city on the 22d of February.  I took the precaution to provide for Sherman's army, in case he should be forced to turn in toward the sea coast before reaching North Carolina, by forwarding supplies to every place where he was liable to have to make such a deflection from his projected march.  I also sent railroad rolling stock, of which we had a great abundance, now that we were not operating the roads in Virginia.  The gauge of the North Carolina railroads being the same as the Virginia railroads had been altered too; these cars and locomotives were ready for use there without any change.  On the 31st of January I countermanded the orders given to Thomas to move south to Alabama and Georgia.  (I had previously reduced his force by sending a portion of it to Terry.)  I directed in lieu of this movement, that he should send Stoneman through East Tennessee, and push him well down toward Columbia, South Carolina, in support of Sherman. Thomas did not get Stoneman off in time, but, on the contrary, when I had supposed he was on his march in support of Sherman I heard of his being in Louisville, Kentucky.  I immediately changed the order, and directed Thomas to send him toward Lynchburg.  Finally, however, on the 12th of March, he did push down through the north-western end of South Carolina, creating some consternation.  I also ordered Thomas to send the 4th corps (Stanley's) to Bull Gap and to destroy no more roads east of that.  I also directed him to concentrate supplies at Knoxville, with a view to a probable movement of his army through that way toward Lynchburg.  Goldsboro is four hundred and twenty-five miles from Savannah. Sherman's march was without much incident until he entered Columbia, on the 17th of February.  He was detained in his progress by having to repair and corduroy the roads, and rebuild the bridges.  There was constant skirmishing and fighting between the cavalry of the two armies, but this did not retard the advance of the infantry.  Four days, also, were lost in making complete the destruction of the most important railroads south of Columbia; there was also some delay caused by the high water, and the destruction of the bridges on the line of the road.  A formidable river had to be crossed near Columbia, and that in the face of a small garrison under General Wade Hampton.  There was but little delay, however, further than that caused by high water in the stream.  Hampton left as Sherman approached, and the city was found to be on fire.  There has since been a great deal of acrimony displayed in discussions of the question as to who set Columbia on fire."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5865"],["title","Personal Memoirs of  U. S. Grant, Part 6. (#2)"],["body","denies it on the part of his troops, and Hampton denies it on the part of the Confederates.  One thing is certain:  as soon as our troops took possession, they at once proceeded to extinguish the flames to the best of their ability with the limited means at hand.  In any case, the example set by the Confederates in burning the village of Chambersburg, Pa., a town which was not garrisoned, would seem to make a defence of the act of firing the seat of government of the State most responsible for the conflict then raging, not imperative.  The Confederate troops having vacated the city, the mayor took possession, and sallied forth to meet the commander of the National forces for the purpose of surrendering the town, making terms for the protection of property, etc.  Sherman paid no attention at all to the overture, but pushed forward and took the town without making any conditions whatever with its citizens.  He then, however, co-operated with the mayor in extinguishing the flames and providing for the people who were rendered destitute by this destruction of their homes.  When he left there he even gave the mayor five hundred head of cattle to be distributed among the citizens, to tide them over until some arrangement could be made for their future supplies.  He remained in Columbia until the roads, public buildings, workshops and everything that could be useful to the enemy were destroyed.  While at Columbia, Sherman learned for the first time that what remained of Hood's army was confronting him, under the command of General Beauregard.  Charleston was evacuated on the 18th of February, and Foster garrisoned the place.  Wilmington was captured on the 22d. Columbia and Cheraw farther north, were regarded as so secure from invasion that the wealthy people of Charleston and Augusta had sent much of their valuable property to these two points to be stored.  Among the goods sent there were valuable carpets, tons of old Madeira, silverware, and furniture. I am afraid much of these goods fell into the hands of our troops. There was found at Columbia a large amount of powder, some artillery, small-arms and fixed ammunition.  These, of course were among the articles destroyed.  While here, Sherman also learned of Johnston's restoration to command.  The latter was given, as already stated, all troops in North and South Carolina.  After the completion of the destruction of public property about Columbia, Sherman proceeded on his march and reached Cheraw without any special opposition and without incident to relate. The railroads, of course, were thoroughly destroyed on the way.  Sherman remained a day or two at Cheraw; and, finally, on the 6th of March crossed his troops over the Pedee and advanced straight for Fayetteville.  Hardee and Hampton were there, and barely escaped. Sherman reached Fayetteville on the 11th of March.  He had dispatched scouts from Cheraw with letters to General Terry, at Wilmington, asking him to send a steamer with some supplies of bread, clothing and other articles which he enumerated.  The scouts got through successfully, and a boat was sent with the mail and such articles for which Sherman had asked as were in store at Wilmington; unfortunately, however, those stores did not contain clothing.  Four days later, on the 15th, Sherman left Fayetteville for Goldsboro. The march, now, had to be made with great caution, for he was approaching Lee's army and nearing the country that still remained open to the enemy.  Besides, he was confronting all that he had had to confront in his previous march up to that point, reinforced by the garrisons along the road and by what remained of Hood's army.  Frantic appeals were made to the people to come in voluntarily and swell the ranks of our foe.  I presume, however, that Johnston did not have in all over 35,000 or 40,000 men.  The people had grown tired of the war, and desertions from the Confederate army were much more numerous than the voluntary accessions.  There was some fighting at Averysboro on the 16th between Johnston's troops and Sherman's, with some loss; and at Bentonville on the 19th and 21st of March, but Johnston withdrew from the contest before the morning of the 22d.  Sherman's loss in these last engagements in killed, wounded, and missing, was about sixteen hundred.  Sherman's troops at last reached Goldsboro on the 23d of the month and went into bivouac; and there his men were destined to have a long rest.  Schofield was there to meet him with the troops which had been sent to Wilmington.  Sherman was no longer in danger.  He had Johnston confronting him; but with an army much inferior to his own, both in numbers and morale.  He had Lee to the north of him with a force largely superior; but I was holding Lee with a still greater force, and had he made his escape and gotten down to reinforce Johnston, Sherman, with the reinforcements he now had from Schofield and Terry, would have been able to hold the Confederates at bay for an indefinite period.  He was near the sea-shore with his back to it, and our navy occupied the harbors.  He had a railroad to both Wilmington and New Bern, and his flanks were thoroughly protected by streams, which intersect that part of the country and deepen as they approach the sea.  Then, too, Sherman knew that if Lee should escape me I would be on his heels, and he and Johnson together would be crushed in one blow if they attempted to make a stand.  With the loss of their capital, it is doubtful whether Lee's army would have amounted to much as an army when it reached North Carolina.  Johnston's army was demoralized by constant defeat and would hardly have made an offensive movement, even if they could have been induced to remain on duty.  The men of both Lee's and Johnston's armies were, like their brethren of the North, as brave as men can be; but no man is so brave that he may not meet such defeats and disasters as to discourage him and dampen his ardor for any cause, no matter how just he deems it.    CHAPTER LXIII.  ARRIVAL OF THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS--LINCOLN AND THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS --AN ANECDOTE OF LINCOLN--THE WINTER BEFORE PETERSBURG--SHERIDAN DESTROYS THE RAILROAD--GORDON CARRIES THE PICKET LINE--PARKE RECAPTURES THE LINE --THE LINE OF BATTLE OF WHITE OAK ROAD.  On the last of January, 1865, peace commissioners from the so-called Confederate States presented themselves on our lines around Petersburg, and were immediately conducted to my headquarters at City Point.  They proved to be Alexander H. Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederacy, Judge Campbell, Assistant-Secretary of War, and R. M. T. Hunt, formerly United States Senator and then a member of the Confederate Senate.  It was about dark when they reached my headquarters, and I at once conducted them to the steam Mary Martin, a Hudson River boat which was very comfortably fitted up for the use of passengers.  I at once communicated by telegraph with Washington and informed the Secretary of War and the President of the arrival of these commissioners and that their object was to negotiate terms of peace between he United States and, as they termed it, the Confederate Government.  I was instructed to retain them at City Point, until the President, or some one whom he would designate, should come to meet them.  They remained several days as guests on board the boat.  I saw them quite frequently, though I have no recollection of having had any conversation whatever with them on the subject of their mission.  It was something I had nothing to do with, and I therefore did not wish to express any views on the subject.  For my own part I never had admitted, and never was ready to admit, that they were the representatives of a GOVERNMENT.  There had been too great a waste of blood and treasure to concede anything of the kind.  As long as they remained there, however, our relations were pleasant and I found them all very agreeable gentlemen.  I directed the captain to furnish them with the best the boat afforded, and to administer to their comfort in every way possible.  No guard was placed over them and no restriction was put upon their movements; nor was there any pledge asked that they would not abuse the privileges extended to them.  They were permitted to leave the boat when they felt like it, and did so, coming up on the bank and visiting me at my headquarters.  I had never met either of these gentlemen before the war, but knew them well by reputation and through their public services, and I had been a particular admirer of Mr. Stephens.  I had always supposed that he was a very small man, but when I saw him in the dusk of the evening I was very much surprised to find so large a man as he seemed to be.  When he got down on to the boat I found that he was wearing a coarse gray woollen overcoat, a manufacture that had been introduced into the South during the rebellion.  The cloth was thicker than anything of the kind I had ever seen, even in Canada.  The overcoat extended nearly to his feet, and was so large that it gave him the appearance of being an average-sized man.  He took this off when he reached the cabin of the boat, and I was struck with the apparent change in size, in the coat and out of it.  After a few days, about the 2d of February, I received a dispatch from Washington, directing me to send the commissioners to Hampton Roads to meet the President and a member of the cabinet.  Mr. Lincoln met them there and had an interview of short duration.  It was not a great while after they met that the President visited me at City Point.  He spoke of his having met the commissioners, and said he had told them that there would be no use in entering into any negotiations unless they would recognize, first:  that the Union as a whole must be forever preserved, and second:  that slavery must be abolished. If they were willing to concede these two points, then he was ready to enter into negotiations and was almost willing to hand them a blank"]]]
