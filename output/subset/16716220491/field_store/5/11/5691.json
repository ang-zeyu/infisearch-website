Now I have no doubt there are many students who do not appreciate their privileges as much as you do.”  “I know it, sir. There are pretty lively boys in college. Have you a son there?”  “No.”  “I didn't know but what you might have.”  “What do you mean by lively?”  “I mean they care more to have a good time than to get on in their studies.”  “What do they do?”  “Well, some of them belong to societies, and have a good time whenever they meet. Frequently they give little suppers at the hotel here, and keep it up till a late hour.”  “Do the faculty know of this?”  “They may surmise something, but they don't interfere. Of course, it pays Mr. Daniels, the landlord, for he charges a good round sum, and, as there is no other place for the boys to go, they must pay it. There's going to be a supper here to-night.”  “Indeed!”  “It is given by one of the sophomores, Walter Sherwood.”  “What name did you mention?” asked Doctor Mack, startled.  “Walter Sherwood. Do you know him?”  “I know a family by the name of Sherwood,” answered Doctor Mack, evasively. “What sort of a young man is he?”  “I don't call him a young man. He is only seventeen or eighteen--one of the youngest members of the class. He is very popular among his mates--a regular jolly boy he is.”  “Does he stand well in his scholarship?”  The young man laughed.  “I don't think he troubles himself much about studies,” he replied, “from all I hear; but he is pretty smart, learns easily, and manages to keep up respectably.”  Doctor Mack's heart sank within him. Was this the best that could be said about his ward, the son of his old friend?  “Do you think he is dissipated?” he asked, uneasily.  “Not that I ever heard. He is fond of having a good time, and drinks wine at his suppers, but he isn't what you would call intemperate. He would do better work in college if he wasn't so rich.”  “So he is rich, then?”  “He must be, for he spends a good deal of money. Pendleton, one of his classmates, told me that he spent more money than any one in the class.”  “That is why he needs so many extra checks,” thought the guardian soberly.  “I am sorry he doesn't make better use of his privileges,” he said aloud.  “Yes, sir, it is a pity. If he didn't care so much for a good time he might stand at the head of his class--so Pendleton thinks.”  “If he were a poor boy, now, you think the result would be different?”  asked Doctor Mack, thoughtfully.  “Yes, sir, I have no doubt of it.”  “When does the supper commence?”  “At half-past eight o'clock.”  “How long will it keep up?”  “Till near midnight. The landlord makes it a point to have them close before twelve. I hope they won't disturb you, sir.”  “Are they likely to make much noise?”  “Well, sir, they make speeches, and do a good deal of singing. Then, college songs are naturally noisy.”  “Yes, so I hear.”  “What is the number of your room?”  “Number nine.”  “Why, you are nearly opposite the room where they will have their supper. I am afraid you won't stand much chance of sleeping early.”  “Oh, never mind! I shall get an idea of what a college supper is like.”  “So you will. If you open the transom over your door you will have the full benefit of all that goes on.”  “That will suit me very well,” thought Doctor Mack.  “If you would like to be farther away, the landlord would no doubt change your room.”  “Oh, no,” said the doctor hastily. “It will suit me very well for once to listen to college songs and get an idea of how college boys enjoy themselves.”  “A very sensible old gentleman!” thought James Holden. “Some men of his age would make a fuss.”  A little before the time when the students were expected to arrive Doctor Mack shut himself up in his room, taking care to open the transom. He had ascertained from the young man, his informant, that supper had been engaged for twelve, and that the price charged per plate was two dollars and a half, all to be paid by Walter Sherwood.  “That makes thirty dollars,” he reflected. “No wonder Walter writes for extra checks. I wonderin this thirty dollars is to figure as a contribution to the library?”  From his window he could see the students as they approached the hotel. Finally he caught sight of Walter, with a college friend on each sides with whom he was chatting gaily.  “What a change!” thought Doctor Mack. “It seems only yesterday that Walter started for college, a bashful, unformed boy, full of good resolutions, and determined to distinguish himself in scholarship. Now he has become a gay butterfly. And, what is worse, he has learned to deceive his old guardian, and his chief aim seems to be to have a good time. What can I do to change his course?”  The good doctor's face assumed a thoughtful look.  “I can tell better after what I shall hear to-night,” he said to himself.  It was not long before the guests were all assembled and the feast was to begin.  Some one rapped for attention, and then Doctor Mack recognized the voice of his young ward.  “Gentlemen,” he said, “I am glad to welcome you to this festal board. After spending ten or a dozen hours in hard study”--laughter and applause--“we find it pleasant to close our books, to relax our learned brows”--more laughter--“and show our appreciation of the good things of life. As Horace, your favorite, says”--I won't insult you by offering to translate his well-known words--_“dulce est desipere in loco_. That is what has brought us here to-night We want to _desipere in loco._”  “So we do! Good for you!” exclaimed one and another.  “I regret,” Walter continued, “that all the professors have declined my urgent invitation to be present on this occasion. Professor Griggs”--the professor of mathematics--“said he would not break away from his regular diet of logarithms and radicals.” Great laughter. “I have expressly requested Mr. Daniels to provide no logarithms to-night. They don't agree with my constitution.”  “Nor with mine!” “Nor with mine!” echoed one and another.  “I shall expect you all, after the banquet, to do something for the general entertainment. I stipulate, however, that none of the company address us in Latin or Greek.”--“We won't!” “We won't!”--“Sufficient for the recitation-room is the evil thereof. But I have spoken long enough. There are times when silence is golden, and one of those times is at hand. Brethren, the feast awaits you! Pitch in!”  The speaker took his seat, and then there was a noise of clinking glasses, and knives and forks came to the front. The banquet had begun.     CHAPTER III  A COLLEGE BANQUET   There was a rattling of knives and forks, a clink of glasses, and a buzz of conversation. Doctor Mack was able to hear considerable of it. There were anecdotes of the professors, accounts of narrow escapes from “flunking” in the recitation-room, and remarks by no means complimentary to some of the text-books in use in college. It was evident that the collegians assembled cared more for a good time than for study. Yet these seemed to be the chosen associates of his ward, the doctor reflected.  As the feast proceeded, he grew more sober. He felt that college life, however much it was doing for the faithful students, was only fostering self-indulgence in his ward.  “Something must be done!” reflected Doctor Mack. “Desperate diseases require desperate remedies.”  Again the chairman rapped for order, and again Walter's voice was heard.  “Brothers,” he said, “the material part of our banquet is ended. We have gratified our appetites with the savory dishes provided by our friend Daniels. We have quaffed the rare Falernian wine, of a vintage unknown to Horace; we have quickened our wits, as I trust, under those favorable conditions, and the time has now come for the feast of reason and the flow of soul. Exhausted as we are by our labors in the classroom”--great laughter--“we have sought refreshment in the way that is most agreeable. It's a way we have at old Euclid! Sing!”  Immediately the assembled company started up the well-known college song:        “It's a way we have at old Euclid,        It's a way we have at old Euclid,        It's a way we have at old Euclid,          To drive dull care away.        It's a way we have at old Euclid,        It's a way we have at old Euclid,         To drive dull care away.        “And we think it is no sin, sir,        To take the Freshmen in, sir,        And ease them of their tin, sir,          To drive dull care away.        It's a way we have at old Euclid,        It's a way we have at old Euclid,          To drive dull care away.”  There were other verses, but these will serve as specimens. All joined in the chorus, and Doctor Mack, who remembered his own college life, felt almost tempted to add his voice to those of the young men in the opposite room.  “But, pshaw!” he thought. “What would Walter and his friends think to hear an old graybeard like me taking part in the convivial songs? There is no great harm in singing college songs, if it is accompanied by good work in the recitation-room.”  “Brothers,” resumed Walter, “we will do our best to drive dull care away. Let us forget, this happy evening, that there are such things as logarithms, and sines, and tangents, and Greek tragedies. To-night our hearts shall be uplifted by sentiment and song. Brother Corbett, you will oblige us with 'Rumsty Ho!'”  A young man with a pleasant voice sang this song, one unfamiliar to the doctor:       “A beggar man laid himself down to sleep,            Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho!       A beggar man laid himself down to sleep       By the banks of the Mersey, so high and steep,            Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho!       “Two thieves came walking by that way,            Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho!       Two thieves came walking by that way,       And they came to the place where the old man lay,            Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho!       “They stole his wallet and they stole "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5993"],["title","Walter Sherwood's Probation (#2)"],["body","staff,            Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho!       They stole his wallet and they stole his staff,       And then broke out in a great horse-laugh,            Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho!”  There was more of this song, too. Next came “Crambambuli,” and then “Cocach-lunk” both of which were familiar to the doctor.  Then Walter said: “Brothers, I have great pleasure in stating that Professor Griggs has concluded to honor our dinner by his learned presence, and has consented to address us. Permit me to introduce Professor Theophilus Griggs.”  One of the company had made up as the mathematical professor. In a nasal tone he made a rambling speech, in which he introduced mathematical allusions, and used some of the favorite phrases of the rather dull and prosy instructor, with whom all the students were familiar, some to their sorrow. It seemed to be very amusing to the boys present, as shown by their hearty laughter, but of course Doctor Mack could not appreciate it.  Other songs and other speeches followed. Though for the most part college songs, there were some of a more serious character. Time slipped by, and at length Doctor Mack saw by his watch that it was half-past eleven.  “How long will they keep it up, I wonder?” he asked himself. “I feel drowsy.”  He was answered by the chairman.  “Brothers,” he said, “time waits for no man. The hour has arrived when, according to agreement, we must wind up our festivities. Hand in hand we will sing 'Auld Lang Syne,' hoping, at some auspicious season after the coming vacation is over, to have another good time. I thank you all for accepting my invitation, and hope you have enjoyed yourselves.”  “Three cheers for Sherwood!” cried one of the company.  They were given with a will. Then the parting song was sung, and the students retired to their rooms in one of the college dormitories.  Doctor Mack went thoughtfully to bed.  “It is well I came,” he reflected. “Walter has done nothing decidedly wrong as yet, but it is evident he is not improving.”  “Well,” said James Holdens as he met Doctor Mack the next morning, “did you hear the boys last night?”  “I couldn't very well help it,” answered the doctor, smiling. “That young Sherwood seems to be very popular.”  “Yes, sir; he is very free with his money.”  “In what other way does he spend it?”  “Mr. Daniels keeps half a dozen horses to let to students and others. Sherwood hires a team at least twice a week, and of course it counts up.”  “I was not able to spend money in that way when I attended college.”  “Then you are a college graduate?” said Holden.  “Yes.”  “Did you graduate at Euclid?”  “No; I am a Yale man.”  “I congratulate you, sir; I should like to graduate from Yale.  “I hope you may, some time, my young friend. You would derive more benefit, I'll be bound, than those young roysterers of last evening.”  “I hope they didn't keep you awake, sir.”  “They certainly did as long as they stayed. I should have gone to bed soon afterward, but that I had something on my mind. By the way, don't mention to any of the students that they had an unseen listener.”  “No, sir.”  Doctor Mack took the first train after breakfast, and returned to his home without seeing his ward.  Nancy Sprague questioned him eagerly.  “And how is Master Walter?” she asked.  “Very well, indeed, Nancy.”  “Was he surprised to see you?”  “He didn't see me, Nancy.”  “He didn't see you!” ejaculated the housekeeper.  “No; the fact was, I went away on a matter of business, and it was not convenient to call on Walter. But I heard him.”  “I don't see how you could have been near him without seeing him.”  “I shall see him soon, Nancy, and so will you. In two weeks vacation will be here. Examinations are near, and I might have interfered with his studies,” the doctor added, with a little innocent evasion.  “To be sure, sir! To be sure! I make no doubt Master Walter is a great scholar.”  “I have very strong doubts on that point myself,” thought Doctor Mack, but he did not care to express himself thus to Nancy.  “I am so glad the dear boy is coming home soon,” murmured the housekeeper. “He has been studying so hard he needs a good long rest. I will make some cookies expressly for him after he comes. I don't believe he gets any at college.”  “I wonder what Nancy would say if she could have seen Walter presiding at the supper, and heard the songs?” thought Doctor Mack.     CHAPTER IV  THE DAY AFTER THE FEAST   The same morning, in a comfortably furnished room in Simpson Hall, sat, or rather lounged, Walter Sherwood.  “I feel sleepy this morning, Gates,” he said to his chum. “I can't fix my mind on this confounded logic.”  “No wonder, Sherwood. You have good reason to be tired after last evening.”  “That's so! We had a good time, though. I am sorry you couldn't accept my invitation.”  “I couldn't afford it, Sherwood. You know we are very differently situated. You are rich, while I am the oldest son of a country minister, with all I can do to get through college. As it is, I shall be in debt.”  “Why not be in debt to me? You never would accept anything from me.”  “Yes, I did. I have let you go to the entire expense of furnishing this room, though I have an equal share in it.”  “Oh, that's nothing! You pay me in helping me through my lessons when I am behind. If you hadn't read my Horace to me the other day I should have flunked as sure as can be.”  “It would be better for you to get your own lesson, Walter.”  “Well, I suppose it would,” answered his roommate, yawning. “I wish you could drive this logic into my head. I suppose I am unusually stupid this morning.”  “Suppose we go over it together.”  Fifteen minutes later Walter said complacently: “Thanks, old fellow; you have made it as plain as a pikestaff.”  “And very likely you will get a higher mark at the recitation than I.”  “Well, perhaps so,” laughed Walter. “I suppose it is because I have more cheek than you.”  “You can do better on slight preparation, certainly. You talk like a professor when you are on your feet.”  “You want to be a professor some time, Gates, don't you?”  “Yes,” answered his chum, his face flushing, “I should be proud to become a professor in old Euclid.”  “It would be awfully slow, I think,” returned Walter, stifling a yawn.  “What then, is your ambition?”  “I want to go out among men. I want to take an active part in the world.”  “You will have to work harder than you do in college, then.”  “I suppose I shall. But I am young, Gates. I am only seventeen.”  “And I am nineteen, and look twenty-one.”  “All the better! The older you look the better, If you are going to be a college instructor. I would have to wait a long time if I wanted to, even if I were a good deal wiser than I am now. I am so young, in short, that I can afford to have a good time.”  “It seems to me that is all you think of, Sherwood.”  “Oh, well, I'll reform in time and become a sober old duffer like you,”  and Walter Sherwood laughed carelessly.  “I hope, at any rate, that you will change your views of life. You know what Longfellow says: 'Life is real! Life is earnest!'”  “Oh, yes, I know that by heart. But it's no use, Gates, you can't make an old man of me before my time. Will it disturb you if I play a tune or two on my violin?”  “Well, to tell the truth, it will. I want to get my Greek lesson, and you had better do the same.”  “No, I will read a novel, and you can read over the Greek to me when you have dug it out.”  “I will if you wish, but I am afraid I am spoiling you by doing your studying for you.”  “Remember, I was out late last night.”  “You have something almost every evening, Walter.”  “Oh, well, I'll turn over a new leaf next term.”  “Why not begin now?”  “If you knew how stupid I feel you wouldn't ask.”  Walter stretched himself out on a comfortable lounge, and took up a new novel which he had partially read, while Gates spread the big Greek lexicon on the study-table, and opening his Aristophanes, began slowly and laboriously to translate it into English.  Fifteen minutes passed when a knock was heard at the door.  “Come in!” called out Walter.  He looked up eagerly, hoping the visitor might prove to be one of his jovial comrades of the night before. But he did not look so well pleased when, as the door opened, he caught sight of the pudgy figure and shrewd face of Elijah Daniels, the proprietor of the Euclid Hotel.  “Good morning, Mr. Daniels.” he said, rather apprehensively. “So you have found me out.”  “No, I have found you in,” returned the landlord, with a smile. “I hope I don't intrude upon, your studies, young gentlemen.”  “Well, I am taking a little rest from my labors,” said Walter.  “You were up rather late last evening, Mr. Sherwood.”  “That's a fact, and you gave us a first-class supper, Daniels. You did yourself proud.”  “I did my best, Mr. Sherwood, and I am glad you were satisfied.”  “All the fellows praised the supper.”  “That's good. I know what you young gentlemen like, and I get it, no matter what it costs. I don't make much on the suppers I give the college boys, but of course I like to please them.”  “Your price is quite reasonable, I think.”  “I am glad you do. I have brought in the bill for last night's entertainment, and if you can let me have the money, I shall be glad.”  “Well, the fact is, Daniels, I haven't got the money by me this morning.”  The landlord's countenance changed.  “I like prompt pay,” he said. “It is a good deal of trouble, and, as I said, there isn't much money to be made.”  “That's all right. You won't have to wait long.”  “How long, Mr. Sherwood?”  “I expect a check for a hundred dollars from my guardian to-day. I wrote three days since, for I knew you wouldn't like to wait.”  “A hundred dollars!” repeated the landlord, feeling a little easier in mind.  “Yes.”  “Perhaps your guardian may object to sending it.”  “Oh, no! He's a nice old fellow, Doctor Mack is. He is very indulgent.”  “What name did you mention?  “Doctor Mack. Ezekiel Mack.”  “Indeed! Why, we had a"]]]
