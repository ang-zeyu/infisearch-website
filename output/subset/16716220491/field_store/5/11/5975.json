I have often heard it said that he died at the foot of the scaffold. Hyvert was left alone, his determined brow, his terrible eye, the pistol in each practiced and vigorous hand threatening death to the spectators. Perhaps it was involuntary admiration, in his desperate plight, for this handsome young man with his waving locks, who was known never to have shed blood, and from whom the law now demanded the expiation of blood; or perhaps it was the sight of those three corpses over which he sprang like a wolf overtaken by his hunters, and the frightful novelty of the spectacle, which for an instant restrained the fury of the troop. He perceived this and temporized with them for a compromise.  “Gentlemen,” said he, “I go to my death! I die with all my heart! But let no one approach me or I shall shoot him--except this gentleman,” he continued, pointing to the executioner. “This is an affair that concerns us alone and merely needs a certain understanding between us.”  This concession was readily accorded, for there was no one present who was not suffering from the prolongation of this horrible tragedy, and anxious to see it finished. Perceiving their assent, he placed one of his pistols between his teeth, and drawing a dagger from his belt, plunged it in his breast up to the hilt. He still remained standing and seemed greatly surprised. There was a movement toward him.  “Very well, gentlemen!” cried he, covering the men who sought to surround him with his pistols, which he had seized again, while the blood spurted freely from the wound in which he had left his poniard. “You know our agreement; either I die alone or three of us will die together. Forward, march!” He walked straight to the guillotine, turning the knife in his breast as he did so.  “Faith,” said he, “my soul must be centred in my belly! I cannot die. See if you can fetch it out.”  This last was addressed to his executioner. An instant later his head fell. Be it accident or some peculiar phenomenon of the vitality, it rebounded and rolled beyond the circle of the scaffolding, and they will still tell you at Bourg, that Hyvert’s head spoke.   Before I had finished reading I had decided to abandon René d’Argonne for the Companions of Jehu. On the morrow I came down with my travelling bag under my arm.  “You are leaving?” said Alexandre to me.  “Yes.”  “Where are you going?”  “To Bourg, in Bresse.”  “What are you going to do there?”  “Study the neighborhood and consult with the inhabitants who saw Leprêtre, Amiet, Guyon and Hyvert executed.”         *       *       *       *       *  There are two roads to Bourg--from Paris, of course; one may leave the train at Mâcon, and take stage from Mâcon to Bourg, or, continuing as far as Lyons, take train again from Lyons to Bourg.  I was hesitating between these two roads when one of the travellers who was temporarily occupying my compartment decided me. He was going to Bourg, where he frequently had business. He was going by way of Lyons; therefore, Lyons was the better way.  I resolved to travel by the same route. I slept at Lyons, and on the morrow by ten in the morning I was at Bourg.  A paper published in the second capital of the kingdom met my eye. It contained a spiteful article about me. Lyons has never forgiven me since 1833, I believe, some twenty-four years ago, for asserting that it was not a literary city. Alas! I have in 1857 the same opinion of Lyons as I had in 1833. I do not easily change my opinion. There is another city in France that is almost as bitter against me as Lyons, that is Rouen. Rouen has hissed all my plays, including Count Hermann.  One day a Neapolitan boasted to me that he had hissed Rossini and Malibran, “The Barbiere” and “Desdemona.”  “That must be true,” I answered him, “for Rossini and Malibran on their side boast of having been hissed by Neapolitans.”  So I boast that the Rouenese have hissed me. Nevertheless, meeting a full-blooded Rouenese one day I resolved to discover why I had been hissed at Rouen. I like to understand these little things.  My Rouenese informed me: “We hiss you because we are down on you.”  Why not? Rouen was down on Joan of Arc. Nevertheless it could not be for the same reason. I asked my Rouenese why he and his compatriots were ill-disposed to me; I had never said anything evil of apple sugar, I had treated M. Barbet with respect during his entire term as mayor, and, when a delegate from the Society of Letters at the unveiling of the statue of the great Corneille, I was the only one who thought to bow to him before beginning my speech. There was nothing in that which could have reasonably incurred the hatred of the Rouenese.  Therefore to this haughty reply, “We hiss you because we have a grudge against you,” I asked humbly:  “But, great Heavens! why are you down on me?”  “Oh, you know very well,” replied my Rouenese.  “I?” I exclaimed.  “Yes, you.”  “Well, never mind; pretend I do not know.”  “You remember the dinner the city gave you, in connection with that statue of Corneille?”  “Perfectly. Were they annoyed because I did not return it?”  “No, it is not that.”  “What is it then?”  “Well, at that dinner they said to you: ‘M. Dumas, you ought to write a play for Rouen based upon some subject taken from its own history.’”  “To which I replied: ‘Nothing easier; I will come at your first summons and spend a fortnight in Rouen. You can suggest the subject, and during that fortnight I will write the play, the royalties of which I shall devote to the poor.’”  “That is true, you said that.”  “I see nothing sufficiently insulting in that to incur the hatred of the Rouenese.”  “Yes, but they added: ‘Will you write it in prose?’ To which you replied--Do you remember what you answered?”  “My faith! no.”  “You replied: ‘I will write it in verse; it is soonest done.’”  “That sounds like me. Well, what then?”  “Then! That was an insult to Corneille, M. Dumas; that is why the Rouenese are down on you, and will be for a long time.”  Verbatim!  Oh, worthy Rouenese! I trust that you will never serve me so ill as to forgive and applaud me.  The aforesaid paper observed that M. Dumas had doubtless spent but one night in Lyons because a city of such slight literary standing was not worthy of his longer sojourn. M. Dumas had not thought about this at all. He had spent but one night at Lyons because he was in a hurry to reach Bourg. And no sooner had M. Dumas arrived at Bourg than he asked to be directed to the office of its leading newspaper.  I knew that it was under the management of a distinguished archeologist, who was also the editor of my friend Baux’s work on the church of Brou.  I asked for M. Milliet. M. Milliet appeared. We shook hands and I explained the object of my visit.  “I can fix you perfectly,” said he to me. “I will take you to one of our magistrates, who is at present engaged upon a history of the department.”  “How far has he got in this history?”  “1822.”  “Then that’s all right. As the events I want to relate occurred in 1799, and my heroes were executed in 1800, he will have covered that epoch, and can furnish me with the desired information. Let us go to your magistrate.”  On the road, M. Milliet told me that this same magisterial historian was also a noted gourmet. Since Brillat-Savarin it has been the fashion for magistrates to be epicures. Unfortunately, many are content to be gourmands, which is not at all the same thing.  We were ushered into the magistrate’s study. I found a man with a shiny face and a sneering smile. He greeted me with that protecting air which historians deign to assume toward poets.  “Well, sir,” he said to me, “so you have come to our poor country in search of material for your novel?”  “No, sir; I have my material already. I have come simply to consult your historical documents.”  “Good! I did not know that it was necessary to give one’s self so much trouble in order to write novels.”  “There you are in error, sir; at least in my instance. I am in the habit of making exhaustive researches upon all the historical events of which I treat.”  “You might at least have sent some one else.”  “Any person whom I might send, sir, not being so completely absorbed in my subject, might have overlooked many important facts. Then, too, I make use of many localities which I cannot describe unless I see them.”  “Oh, then this is a novel which you intend writing yourself?”  “Yes, certainly, sir. I allowed my valet to write my last; but he had such immense success that the rogue asked so exorbitant an increase of wages that, to my great regret, I was unable to keep him.”  The magistrate bit his lips. Then, after a moment’s silence, he said:  “Will you kindly tell me, sir, how I can assist you in this important work?”  “You can direct my researches, sir. As you have compiled the history of the department, none of the important event which have occurred in its capital can be unknown to you.”  “Truly, sir, I believe that in this respect I am tolerably well informed.”  “Then, sir, in the first place, your department was the centre of the operations of the Company of Jehu.”  “Sir, I have heard speak of the Companions of Jesus,” replied the magistrate with his jeering smile.  “The Jesuits, you mean? That is not what I am seeking, sir.”  “Nor is it of them that I am speaking. I refer to the stage robbers who infested the highroads from 1797 to 1800.”  “Then, sir, permit me to tell you they are precisely the ones I have come to Bourg about, and that they were called the Companions of Jehu, and not the Companions of Jesus.”  “What is the meaning of this title ‘Companions of Jehu’? I like to get at the bottom of everything.”  “So do I, sir; that is why I did not wish to confound these highwaymen with the Apostles.”  “Truly, that would not have been very orthodox.”  “But it is what you would have done, nevertheless, sir, if I, a poet, had not come here expressly to correct the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/708"],["title","The Princess and the Goblin (#1)"],["body"," yet further the stair could lead.  It was very narrow, and so steep that she went on like a four-legged creature on her hands and feet.    CHAPTER 3  The Princess and--We Shall See Who  When she came to the top, she found herself in a little square place, with three doors, two opposite each other, and one opposite the top of the stair.  She stood for a moment, without an idea in her little head what to do next.  But as she stood, she began to hear a curious humming sound.  Could it be the rain?  No.  It was much more gentle, and even monotonous than the sound of the rain, which now she scarcely heard. The low sweet humming sound went on, sometimes stopping for a little while and then beginning again.  It was more like the hum of a very happy bee that had found a rich well of honey in some globular flower, than anything else I can think of at this moment.  Where could it come from?  She laid her ear first to one of the doors to hearken if it was there--then to another.  When she laid her ear against the third door, there could be no doubt where it came from: it must be from something in that room.  What could it be?  She was rather afraid, but her curiosity was stronger than her fear, and she opened the door very gently and peeped in.  What do you think she saw?  A very old lady who sat spinning.  Perhaps you will wonder how the princess could tell that the old lady was an old lady, when I inform you that not only was she beautiful, but her skin was smooth and white.  I will tell you more.  Her hair was combed back from her forehead and face, and hung loose far down and all over her back.  That is not much like an old lady--is it?  Ah! but it was white almost as snow.  And although her face was so smooth, her eyes looked so wise that you could not have helped seeing she must be old.  The princess, though she could not have told you why, did think her very old indeed--quite fifty, she said to herself.  But she was rather older than that, as you shall hear.  While the princess stared bewildered, with her head just inside the door, the old lady lifted hers, and said, in a sweet, but old and rather shaky voice, which mingled very pleasantly with the continued hum of her wheel:  'Come in, my dear; come in.  I am glad to see you.'  That the princess was a real princess you might see now quite plainly; for she didn't hang on to the handle of the door, and stare without moving, as I have known some do who ought to have been princesses but were only rather vulgar little girls.  She did as she was told, stepped inside the door at once, and shut it gently behind her.  'Come to me, my dear,' said the old lady.  And again the princess did as she was told.  She approached the old lady--rather slowly, I confess--but did not stop until she stood by her side, and looked up in her face with her blue eyes and the two melted stars in them.  'Why, what have you been doing with your eyes, child?' asked the old lady.  'Crying,' answered the princess.  'Why, child?'  'Because I couldn't find my way down again.'  'But you could find your way up.'  'Not at first--not for a long time.'  'But your face is streaked like the back of a zebra.  Hadn't you a handkerchief to wipe your eyes with?'  'No.'  'Then why didn't you come to me to wipe them for you?'  'Please, I didn't know you were here.  I will next time.'  'There's a good child!' said the old lady.  Then she stopped her wheel, and rose, and, going out of the room, returned with a little silver basin and a soft white towel, with which she washed and wiped the bright little face.  And the princess thought her hands were so smooth and nice!  When she carried away the basin and towel, the little princess wondered to see how straight and tall she was, for, although she was so old, she didn't stoop a bit.  She was dressed in black velvet with thick white heavy-looking lace about it; and on the black dress her hair shone like silver.  There was hardly any more furniture in the room than there might have been in that of the poorest old woman who made her bread by her spinning.  There was no carpet on the floor--no table anywhere--nothing but the spinning-wheel and the chair beside it.  When she came back, she sat down and without a word began her spinning once more, while Irene, who had never seen a spinning-wheel, stood by her side and looked on.  When the old lady had got her thread fairly going again, she said to the princess, but without looking at her:  'Do you know my name, child?'  'No, I don't know it,' answered the princess.  'My name is Irene.'  'That's my name!' cried the princess.  'I know that.  I let you have mine.  I haven't got your name. You've got mine.'  'How can that be?' asked the princess, bewildered.  'I've always had my name.'  'Your papa, the king, asked me if I had any objection to your having it; and, of course, I hadn't.  I let you have it with pleasure.'  'It was very kind of you to give me your name--and such a pretty one,' said the princess.  'Oh, not so very kind!' said the old lady.  'A name is one of those things one can give away and keep all the same.  I have a good many such things.  Wouldn't you like to know who I am, child?'  'Yes, that I should--very much.'  'I'm your great-great-grandmother,' said the lady.  'What's that?' asked the princess.  'I'm your father's mother's father's mother.'  'Oh, dear! I can't understand that,' said the princess.  'I dare say not.  I didn't expect you would.  But that's no reason why I shouldn't say it.'  'Oh, no!' answered the princess.  'I will explain it all to you when you are older,' the lady went on. 'But you will be able to understand this much now: I came here to take care of you.'  'Is it long since you came?  Was it yesterday?  Or was it today, because it was so wet that I couldn't get out?'  'I've been here ever since you came yourself.'  'What a long time!' said the princess.  'I don't remember it at all.'  'No.  I suppose not.'  'But I never saw you before.'  'No.  But you shall see me again.'  'Do you live in this room always?'  'I don't sleep in it.  I sleep on the opposite side of the landing. I sit here most of the day.'  'I shouldn't like it.  My nursery is much prettier.  You must be a queen too, if you are my great big grand-mother.'  'Yes, I am a queen.'  'Where is your crown, then?' 'In my bedroom.'  'I should like to see it.'  'You shall some day--not today.'  'I wonder why nursie never told me.'  'Nursie doesn't know.  She never saw me.'  'But somebody knows that you are in the house?'  'No; nobody.'  'How do you get your dinner, then?'  'I keep poultry--of a sort.'  'Where do you keep them?'  'I will show you.'  'And who makes the chicken broth for you?'  'I never kill any of MY chickens.'  'Then I can't understand.'  'What did you have for breakfast this morning?' asked the lady.  'Oh! I had bread and milk, and an egg--I dare say you eat their eggs.'  'Yes, that's it.  I eat their eggs.'  'Is that what makes your hair so white?'  'No, my dear.  It's old age.  I am very old.'  'I thought so.  Are you fifty?'  'Yes--more than that.'  'Are you a hundred?'  'Yes--more than that.  I am too old for you to guess.  Come and see my chickens.'  Again she stopped her spinning.  She rose, took the princess by the hand, led her out of the room, and opened the door opposite the stair. The princess expected to see a lot of hens and chickens, but instead of that, she saw the blue sky first, and then the roofs of the house, with a multitude of the loveliest pigeons, mostly white, but of all colours, walking about, making bows to each other, and talking a language she could not understand.  She clapped her hands with delight, and up rose such a flapping of wings that she in her turn was startled.  'You've frightened my poultry,' said the old lady, smiling.  'And they've frightened me,' said the princess, smiling too.  'But what very nice poultry!  Are the eggs nice?'  'Yes, very nice.' 'What a small egg-spoon you must have!  Wouldn't it be better to keep hens, and get bigger eggs?'  'How should I feed them, though?'  'I see,' said the princess.  'The pigeons feed themselves.  They've got wings.'  'Just so.  If they couldn't fly, I couldn't eat their eggs.'  'But how do you get at the eggs?  Where are their nests?'  The lady took hold of a little loop of string in the wall at the side of the door and, lifting a shutter, showed a great many pigeon-holes with nests, some with young ones and some with eggs in them.  The birds came in at the other side, and she took out the eggs on this side.  She closed it again quickly, lest the young ones should be frightened.  'Oh, what a nice way!' cried the princess.  'Will you give me an egg to eat?  I'm rather hungry.'  'I will some day, but now you must go back, or nursie will be miserable about you.  I dare say she's looking for you everywhere.'  'Except here,' answered the princess.  'Oh, how surprised she will be when I tell her about my great big grand-grand-mother!'  'Yes, that she will!' said the old lady with a curious smile. 'Mind you tell her all about it exactly.'  'That I will.  Please will you take me back to her?'  'I can't go all the way, but I will take you to the top of the stair, and then you must run down quite fast into your own room.'  The little princess put her hand in the old lady's, who, looking this way and that, brought her to the top of the first stair, and thence to the bottom of the second, and did not leave her till she saw her half-way down the third.  When she heard the cry of her nurse's pleasure at finding her, she turned and walked up the stairs again, very fast indeed for such a very great grandmother, and sat down to her spinning with another strange smile on her sweet old face.  About this spinning of hers I will tell you more another time.  Guess what she was spinning.    CHAPTER 4  What the Nurse Thought of It  'Why, where can you have been, princess?' asked the nurse, taking her in her arms.  'It's very unkind of you to hide away"]]]
