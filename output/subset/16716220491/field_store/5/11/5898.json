But neutrals cannot expect that Germany, forced to fight for her     existence, shall, for the sake of neutral interest, restrict the use     of an effective weapon if her enemy is permitted to continue to apply     at will methods of warfare violating the rules of international law.     Such a demand would be incompatible with the character of neutrality,     and the German Government is convinced that the Government of the     United States does not think of making such a demand, knowing that     the Government of the United States has repeatedly declared that it     is determined to restore the principle of the freedom of the seas     from whatever quarter it has been violated.   HOW THE UNITED STATES REPLIED  To this the Government of the United States replied on the 8th of May, accepting, of course, the assurances given, but adding:      The Government of the United States feels it necessary to state that     it takes it for granted that the Imperial German Government does not     intend to imply that the maintenance of its newly announced policy     is in any way contingent upon the course or result of diplomatic     negotiations between the Government of the United States and any     other belligerent Government, notwithstanding the fact that certain     passages in the Imperial Government's note of the 4th instant might     appear to be susceptible to that construction.  In order, however,     to avoid any possible misunderstanding, the Government of the United     States notifies the Imperial Government that it cannot for a moment     entertain, much less discuss, a suggestion that respect by German     naval authorities for the rights of citizens of the United States     upon the high seas should in any way or in the slightest degree be     made contingent upon the conduct of any other Government affecting     the rights of neutrals and non-combatants.  Responsibility in such     matters is single, not joint; absolute, not relative.  To this note of the 8th of May the Imperial German Government made no reply.  On the 31st of January, the Wednesday of the present week, the German Ambassador handed to the Secretary of State, along with a formal note, a memorandum which contains the following statement:   GERMANY'S NEW POLICY      The Imperial Government, therefore, does not doubt that the Government     of the United States will understand the situation thus forced upon     Germany by the Entente Allies' brutal methods of war and by their     determination to destroy the Central Powers, and that the Government     of the United States will further realize that the now openly     disclosed intentions of the Entente Allies give back to Germany the     freedom of action which she reserved in her note addressed to the     Government of the United States on May 4, 1916.      Under these circumstances Germany will meet the illegal measures     of her enemies by forcibly preventing, after February 1, 1917,     in a zone around Great Britain, France, Italy, and in the eastern     Mediterranean all navigation, that of neutrals included, from and     to France, etc.  All ships met within the zone will be sunk.  I think that you will agree with me that, in view of this declaration, which suddenly and without prior intimation of any kind deliberately withdraws the solemn assurance given in the Imperial Government's note of the 4th of May, 1916, this Government has no alternative consistent with the dignity and honor of the United States but to take the course which, in its note of the 18th of April, 1916, it announced that it would take in the event that the German Government did not declare and effect an abandonment of the methods of submarine warfare which it was then employing and to which it now purposes again to resort.   ALL RELATIONS BROKEN OFF  I have, therefore, directed the Secretary of State to announce to his Excellency the German ambassador that all diplomatic relations between the United States and the German Empire are severed, and that the American ambassador at Berlin will immediately be withdrawn, and, in accordance with this decision, to hand to his Excellency his passports.  Notwithstanding this unexpected action of the German Government, this sudden and deeply deplorable renunciation of its assurances, given this Government at one of the most critical moments of tension in the relations of the two Governments, I refuse to believe that it is the intention of the German authorities to do in fact what they have warned us they will feel at liberty to do.  I cannot bring myself to believe that they will indeed pay no regard to the ancient friendship between their people and our own or to the solemn obligations which have been exchanged between them and destroy American ships and take the lives of American citizens in the wilful prosecution of the ruthless naval program they have announced their intention to adopt.  Only actual overt acts on their part can make me believe it even now.   WILL PROTECT AMERICAN RIGHTS  If this inveterate confidence on my part in the sobriety and prudent foresight of their purpose should unhappily prove unfounded, if American ships and American lives should, in fact, be sacrificed by their naval commanders in heedless contravention of the just and reasonable understandings of international law and the obvious dictates of humanity, I shall take the liberty of coming again before the Congress to ask that authority be given me to use any means that may be necessary for the protection of our seamen and our people in the prosecution of their peaceful and legitimate errands on the high seas.  I can do nothing less.  I take it for granted that all neutral Governments will take the same course.  I do not desire any hostile conflict with the Imperial German Government.  We are the sincere friends of the German people and earnestly desire to remain at peace with the Government which speaks for them.  We shall not believe that they are hostile to us until we are obliged to believe it; and we purpose nothing more than the reasonable defense of the undoubted rights of our people.  We wish to serve no selfish ends.  We seek merely to stand true alike in thought and in action to the immemorial principles of our people which I sought to express in my address to the Senate only two weeks ago--seek merely to vindicate our right to liberty and justice and an unmolested life.  These are bases of peace, not war.  God grant we may not be challenged to defend them by acts of wilful injustice on the part of the Government of Germany.     III  REQUEST FOR A GRANT OF POWER  Message to the Congress February 26, 1917    Gentlemen of the Congress:  I have again asked the privilege of addressing you because we are moving through critical times, during which it seems to me to be my duty to keep in close touch with the Houses of Congress so that neither counsel nor action shall run at cross-purposes between us.  On the 3d of February I officially informed you of the sudden and unexpected action of the Imperial German Government in declaring its intention to disregard the promises it had made to this Government in April last and undertake immediate submarine operations against all commerce, whether of belligerents or of neutrals, that should seek to approach Great Britain and Ireland, the Atlantic coasts of Europe, or the harbors of the eastern Mediterranean, and to conduct those operations without regard to the established restrictions of international practice, without regard to any considerations of humanity, even, which might interfere with their object.   AMERICAN COMMERCE SUFFERS, BUT OTHER NEUTRALS FARE WORSE  That policy was forthwith put into practice.  It has now been in active exhibition for nearly four weeks.  Its practical results are not fully disclosed.  The commerce of other neutral nations is suffering severely, but not, perhaps, very much more severely than it was already suffering before the 1st of February, when the new policy of the Imperial Government was put into operation.  We have asked the co-operation of the other neutral Governments to prevent these depredations, but I fear none of them has thought it wise to join us in any common course of action.  Our own commerce has suffered, is suffering, rather in apprehension than in fact, rather because so many of our ships are timidly keeping to their home ports than because American ships have been sunk.  Two American vessels have been sunk, the Housatonic and the Lyman M. Law. The case of the Housatonic, which was carrying foodstuffs consigned to a London firm, was essentially like the case of the Frye, in which, it will be recalled, the German Government admitted its liability for damages, and the lives of the crew, as in the case of the Frye, were safeguarded with reasonable care.   THE RUTHLESS SINKING OF SCHOONER \"LYMAN M. LAW\"  The case of the Law, which was carrying lemon-box staves to Palermo, disclosed a ruthlessness of method which deserves grave condemnation, but was accompanied by no circumstances which might not have been expected at any time in connection with the use of the submarine against merchantmen as the German Government has used it.  In sum, therefore, the situation we find ourselves in with regard to the actual conduct of the German submarine warfare against commerce and its effects upon our own ships and people is substantially the same that it was when I addressed you on the 3d of February, except for the tying up of our shipping in our own ports because of the unwillingness of our ship-owners to risk their vessels at sea without insurance or adequate protection, and the very "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6875"],["title","France and England in North America, Part V: Count Frontenac, New France, Louis (#1)"],["body"," of Phips • His History and Character • Boston in Arms • A Puritan Crusade • The March from Albany • Frontenac and the Council • Frontenac at Montreal • His War Dance • An Abortive Expedition • An English Raid • Frontenac at Quebec • Defences of the Town • The Enemy arrives.

She is painted as Minerva, a plumed helmet on her head, and a shield on her arm. In a corner of the canvas is written Anne de La Grange-Trianon, Comtesse de Frontenac. This blooming goddess was the wife of the future governor of Canada.  Madame de Frontenac, at the age of about twenty, was a favorite companion of Mademoiselle de Montpensier, the grand-daughter of Henry IV. and daughter of the weak and dastardly Gaston, Duke of Orleans. Nothing in French annals has found more readers than the story of the exploit of this spirited princess at Orleans during the civil war of the Fronde. Her cousin Condé, chief of the revolt, had found favor in her eyes; and she had espoused his cause against her cousin, the king. The royal army threatened Orleans. The duke, her father, dared not leave Paris; but he consented that his daughter should go in his place to hold the city for Condé and the Fronde.  The princess entered her carriage and set out on her errand, attended by a small escort. With her were three young married ladies, the Marquise de Bréauté, the Comtesse de Fiesque, and the Comtesse de Frontenac. In two days they reached Orleans. The civic authorities were afraid to declare against the king, and hesitated to open the gates to the daughter of their duke, who, standing in the moat with her three companions, tried persuasion and threats in vain. The prospect was not encouraging, when a crowd of boatmen came up from the river and offered the princess their services. \"I accepted them gladly,\" she writes, \"and said a thousand fine things, such as one must say to that sort of people to make them do what one wishes.\" She gave them money as well as fair words, and begged them to burst open one of the gates. They fell at once to the work; while the guards and officials looked down from the walls, neither aiding nor resisting them. \"To animate the boatmen by my presence,\" she continues, \"I mounted a hillock near by. I did not look to see which way I went, but clambered up like a cat, clutching brambles and thorns, and jumping over hedges without hurting myself. Madame de Bréauté, who is the most cowardly creature in the world, began to cry out against me and everybody who followed me; in fact, I do not know if she did not swear in her excitement, which amused me very much.\" At length, a hole was knocked in the gate; and a gentleman of her train, who had directed the attack, beckoned her to come on. \"As it was very muddy, a man took me and carried me forward, and thrust me in at this hole, where my head was no sooner through than the drums beat to salute me. I gave my hand to the captain of the guard. The shouts redoubled. Two men took me and put me in a wooden chair. I do not know whether I was seated in it or on their arms, for I was beside myself with joy. Everybody was kissing my hands, and I almost died with laughing to see myself in such an odd position.\" There was no resisting the enthusiasm of the people and the soldiers. Orleans was won for the Fronde. [1]  [1] Memoires de Mademoiselle de Montpensier, I. 358-363 (ed. 1859).  The young Countesses of Frontenac and Fiesque had constantly followed her, and climbed after her through the hole in the gate. Her father wrote to compliment them on their prowess, and addressed his letter à Mesdames les Comtesses, Maréchales de Camp dans l'armée de ma fille contre le Mazarin. Officers and soldiers took part in the pleasantry; and, as Madame de Frontenac passed on horseback before the troops, they saluted her with the honors paid to a brigadier.  When the king, or Cardinal Mazarin who controlled him, had triumphed over the revolting princes, Mademoiselle de Montpensier paid the penalty of her exploit by a temporary banishment from the court. She roamed from place to place, with a little court of her own, of which Madame de Frontenac was a conspicuous member. During the war, Count Frontenac had been dangerously ill of a fever in Paris; and his wife had been absent for a time, attending him. She soon rejoined the princess, who was at her château of St. Fargeau, three days' journey from Paris, when an incident occurred which placed the married life of her fair companion in an unexpected light. \"The Duchesse de Sully came to see me, and brought with her M. d'Herbault and M. de Frontenac. Frontenac had stopped here once before, but it was only for a week, when he still had the fever, and took great care of himself like a man who had been at the door of death. This time he was in high health. His arrival had not been expected, and his wife was so much surprised that everybody observed it, especially as the surprise seemed to be not at all a pleasant one. Instead of going to talk with her husband, she went off and hid herself, crying and screaming because he had said that he would like to have her company that evening. I was very much astonished, especially as I had never before perceived her aversion to him. The elder Comtesse de Fiesque remonstrated with her; but she only cried the more. Madame de Fiesque then brought books to show her her duty as a wife; but it did no good, and at last she got into such a state that we sent for the curé with holy water to exorcise her.\" [2]   [2] Memoires de Mademoiselle de Montpensier, II. 265. The curé's holy water, or his exhortations, were at last successful.  Count Frontenac came of an ancient and noble race, said to have been of Basque origin. His father held a high post in the household of Louis XIII., who became the child's god-father, and gave him his own name. At the age of fifteen, the young Louis showed an incontrollable passion for the life of a soldier. He was sent to the seat of war in Holland, to serve under the Prince of Orange. At the age of nineteen, he was a volunteer at the siege of Hesdin; in the next year, he was at Arras, where he distinguished himself during a sortie of the garrison; in the next, he took part in the siege of Aire; and, in the next, in those of Callioure and Perpignan. At the age of twenty-three, he was made colonel of the regiment of Normandy, which he commanded in repeated battles and sieges of the Italian"]]]
