He had a married daughter there, and it was at her house the boys had slept when they went there; for the journey down and up again was too long to be performed in a single day.  But this was not the only distant expedition they had made, for they had once gone down the Stour as far as Harwich with their father when he was called thither on business. To them Harwich with its old walls and the houses crowned up within them, and its busy port with vessels coming in and going out, was most delightful, and they always talked about that expedition as one of the most pleasant recollections of their lives.  After breakfast was over on the 1st of May, 1587, and they had done their lessons with their father, and had worked for an hour by themselves, the boys put by their books and strolled down the village to the bridge. There as usual stood their friend Master Lirriper with his hands deep in his pockets, a place and position in which he was sure to be found when not away in his barge.  \"Good morning, Master Lirriper.\"  \"Good morning, Master Geoffrey and Master Lionel.\"  \"So you are not down the river today?\"  \"No, sir. I am going tomorrow, and this time I shall be away four or five days--maybe even a week.\"  \"Shall you?\" the boys exclaimed in surprise. \"Why, what are you going to do?\"  \"I am going round to London in my nephew Joe Chambers' craft.\"  \"Are you really?\" Geoffrey exclaimed. \"I wish we were going with you. Don't you think you could take us, Master Lirriper?\"  The bargeman looked down into the water and frowned. He was slow of speech, but as the minutes went on and he did not absolutely refuse the boys exchanged glances of excitement and hope.  \"I dunno how that might be, young sirs,\" John Lirriper said slowly, after long cogitation. \"I dussay my nephew would have no objection, but what would parson say about it?\"  \"Oh, I don't think he would object,\" Geoffrey said. \"If you go up and ask him, Master Lirriper, and say that you will take care of us, you know, I don't see why he should say no.\"  \"Like enough you would be ill,\" John Lirriper said after another long pause. \"It's pretty rough sometimes.  \"Oh, we shouldn't mind that,\" Lionel protested. \"We should like to see the waves and to be in a real ship.\"  \"It's nothing much of a ship,\" the boatman said. \"She is a ketch of about ten tons and carries three hands.\"  \"Oh, we don't care how small she is if we can only go in her; and you would be able to show us London, and we might even see the queen. Oh, do come up with us and ask father, Master Lirriper.\"  \"Perhaps parson wouldn't be pleased, young sirs, and, might say I was putting wandering thoughts into your heads; and Mistress Vickars might think it a great liberty on my part.\"  \"Oh, no, she wouldn't, Master Lirriper. Besides, we will say we asked you.\"  \"But suppose any harm comes to you, what would they say to me then?\"  \"Oh, there's no fear of any harm coming to us. Besides, in another year or two we mean to go over to the Low Countries and fight the Spaniards, and what's a voyage to London to that?\"  \"Well, I will think about it,\" John Lirriper said cautiously.  \"No, no, Master Lirriper; if you get thinking about it it will never be done. Do come up with us at once,\" and each of them got hold of one of the boatman's arms.  \"Well, the parson can but say no,\" he said, as he suffered himself to be dragged away. \"And I don't say as it isn't reasonable that you should like to see something of the world, young sirs; but I don't know how the parson will take it.\"  Mr. Vickars looked up irritably from his books when the servant came in and said that Master Lirriper wished to see him.  \"What does he want at this hour?\" he said. \"You know, Ruth, I never see people before dinner. Any time between that and supper I am at their service, but it's too bad being disturbed now.\"  \"I told him so, sir; but Master Geoffrey and Master Lionel were with him, and they said he wanted particular to see you, and they wanted particular too.\"  The clergyman sighed as he put his book down.  \"If Geoffrey and Lionel have concerned themselves in the matter, Ruth, I suppose I must see the man; but it's very hard being disturbed like this. Well, Master Lirriper, what is it?\" he asked, as the boatman accompanied by Geoffrey and Lionel entered the room. Master Lirriper twirled his hat in his hand. Words did not come easily to him at the best of times, and this was a business that demanded thought and care. Long before he had time to fix upon an appropriate form of words Geoffrey broke in:  \"This is what it is, father. Master Lirriper is going down the river to Bricklesey tomorrow, and then he is going on board his nephew's ship. She is a ketch, and she carries ten tons, though I don't know what it is she carries; and she's going to London, and he is going in her, and he says if you will let him he will take us with him, and will show us London, and take great care of us. It will be glorious, father, if you will only let us go.\"  Mr. Vickars looked blankly as Geoffrey poured out his torrent of words. His mind was still full of the book he had been reading, and he hardly took in the meaning of Geoffrey's words.  \"Going in a ketch!\" he repeated. \"Going to catch something, I suppose you mean? Do you mean he is going fishing?\"  \"No, father,--going in a ketch. A ketch is a sort of ship, father, though I don't quite know what sort of ship. What sort of ship is a ketch, Master Lirriper?\"  \"A ketch is a two masted craft, Master Geoffrey,\" John Lirriper said. \"She carries a big mizzen sail.\"  \"There, you see, father,\" Geoffrey said triumphantly; \"she carries a big mizzen sail. That's what she is, you see; and he is going to show us London, and will take great care of us if you will let us go with him.\"  \"Do you mean, Master Lirriper,\" Mr. Vickars asked slowly, \"that you are going to London in some sort of ship, and want to take my sons with you?\"  \"Well, sir, I am going to London, and the young masters seemed to think that they would like to go with me, if so be you would have no objection.\"  \"I don't know,\" Mr. Vickars said, \"It is a long passage, Master Lirriper; and, as I have heard, often a stormy one. I don't think my wife--\"  \"Oh, yes, father,\" Lionel broke in. \"If you say yes, mother is sure to say yes; she always does, you know. And, you see, it will be a great thing for us to see London. Every one else seems to have seen London, and I am sure that it would do us good. And we might even see the queen.\"  \"I think that they would be comfortable, sir,\" John Lirriper put in. \"You see, my nephew's wife is daughter of a citizen, one Master Swindon, a ship's chandler, and he said there would be a room there for me, and they would make me heartily welcome. Now, you see, sir, the young masters could have that room, and I could very well sleep on board the ketch; and they would be out of all sort of mischief there.\"  \"That would be a very good plan certainly, Master Lirriper. Well, well, I don't know what to say.\"  \"Say yes, father,\" Geoffrey said as he saw Mr. Vickars glance anxiously at the book he had left open. \"If you say yes, you see it will be a grand thing for you, our being away for a week with nothing to disturb you.\"  \"Well, well,\" Mr. Vickars said, \"you must ask your mother. If she makes no objection, then I suppose you can go,\" and Mr. Vickars hastily took up his book again.  The boys ran off to the kitchen, where their mother was superintending the brewing of some broth for a sick woman down the village.  \"Mother!\" Geoffrey exclaimed, \"Master Lirriper's going to London in a ketch--a ship with a big mizzen sail, you know--and he has offered to take us with him and show us London. And father has said yes, and it's all settled if you have no objection; and of course you haven't.\"  \"Going to London, Geoffrey!\" Mrs. Vickars exclaimed aghast. \"I never heard of such a thing. Why, like enough you will be drowned on the way and never come back again. Your father must be mad to think of such a thing.\"  \"Oh, no, mother; I am sure it will do us a lot of good. And we may see the queen, mother. And as for drowning, why, we can both swim ever so far. Besides, people don't get drowned going to London. Do they, Master Lirriper?\"  John was standing bashfully at the door of the kitchen. \"Well, not as a rule, Master Geoffrey,\" he replied. \"They comes and they goes, them that are used to it, maybe a hundred times without anything happening to them.\"  \"There! You hear that, mother? They come and go hundreds of times. Oh, I am sure you are not going to say no. That would be too bad when father has agreed to it. Now, mother, please tell Ruth to run away at once and get a wallet packed with our things. Of course we shall want our best clothes; because people dress finely in London, and it would never do if we saw the queen and we hadn't our best doublets on, for she would think that we didn't know what was seemly down at Hedingham.\"  \"Well, my dears, of course if it is all settled--\"  \"Oh, yes, mother, it is quite all settled.\"  \"Then it's no use my saying anything more about it, but I think your father might have consulted me before he gave his consent to your going on such a hazardous journey as this.\"  \"He did want to consult you, mother. But then, you see, he wanted to consult his books even more, and he knew very well that you would agree with him; and you know you would too. So please don't say anything more about it, but let Ruth run upstairs and see to our things at once.  \"There, you see, Master Lirriper, it is all settled. And what time do you start tomorrow? We will be there half an hour before, anyhow.\"  \"I shall go at seven from the bridge. Then I shall just catch the turn of the tide and get to Bricklesey in good time.\"  \"I never did see such boys,\" Mrs. Vickars said when John Lirriper had gone on his way. \"As for your father, I am surprised at him in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],["title","The Prince and Betty (#1)"],["body","eye, which his sister Marion was not.  Mervo was looking its best under the hot morning sun. Mr. Scobell's villa stood near the summit of the only hill the island possessed, and from the window of the morning-room, where he had just finished breakfast, he had an uninterrupted view of valley, town, and harbor--a two-mile riot of green, gold and white, and beyond the white the blue satin of the Mediterranean. Mr. Scobell did not read poetry except that which advertised certain breakfast foods in which he was interested, or he might have been reminded of the Island of Flowers in Tennyson's \"Voyage of Maeldive.\" Violets, pinks, crocuses, yellow and purple mesembryanthemum, lavender, myrtle, and rosemary ... his two-mile view contained them all. The hillside below him was all aglow with the yellow fire of the mimosa. But his was not one of those emotional natures to which the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears. A primrose by the river's brim a simple primrose was to him--or not so much a simple primrose, perhaps, as a basis for a possible Primrosina, the Soap that Really Cleans You.  He was a nasty little man to hold despotic sway over such a Paradise: a goblin in Fairyland. Somewhat below the middle height, he was lean of body and vulturine of face. He had a greedy mouth, a hooked nose, liquid green eyes and a sallow complexion. He was rarely seen without a half-smoked cigar between his lips. This at intervals he would relight, only to allow it to go out again; and when, after numerous fresh starts, it had dwindled beyond the limits of convenience, he would substitute another from the reserve supply that protruded from his vest-pocket.         *       *       *       *       *  How Benjamin Scobell had discovered the existence of Mervo is not known. It lay well outside the sphere of the ordinary financier. But Mr. Scobell took a pride in the versatility of his finance. It distinguished him from the uninspired who were content to concentrate themselves on steel, wheat and such-like things. It was Mr. Scobell's way to consider nothing as lying outside his sphere. In a financial sense he might have taken Terence's _Nihil humanum alienum_ as his motto. He was interested in innumerable enterprises, great and small. He was the power behind a company which was endeavoring, without much success, to extract gold from the mountains of North Wales, and another which was trying, without any success at all, to do the same by sea water. He owned a model farm in Indiana, and a weekly paper in New York. He had financed patent medicines, patent foods, patent corks, patent corkscrews, patent devices of all kinds, some profitable, some the reverse.  Also--outside the ordinary gains of finance--he had expectations. He was the only male relative of his aunt, the celebrated Mrs. Jane Oakley, who lived in a cottage on Staten Island, and was reputed to spend five hundred dollars a year--some said less--out of her snug income of eighteen million. She was an unusual old lady in many ways, and, unfortunately, unusually full of deep-rooted prejudices. The fear lest he might inadvertently fall foul of these rarely ceased to haunt Mr. Scobell.  This man of many projects had descended upon Mervo like a stone on the surface of some quiet pool, bubbling over with modern enterprise in general and, in particular, with a scheme. Before his arrival, Mervo had been an island of dreams and slow movement and putting things off till to-morrow. The only really energetic thing it had ever done in its whole history had been to expel his late highness, Prince Charles, and change itself into a republic. And even that had been done with the minimum of fuss. The Prince was away at the time. Indeed, he had been away for nearly three years, the pleasures of Paris, London and Vienna appealing to him more keenly than life among his subjects. Mervo, having thought the matter over during these years, decided that it had no further use for Prince Charles. Quite quietly, with none of that vulgar brawling which its neighbor, France, had found necessary in similar circumstances, it had struck his name off the pay-roll, and declared itself a republic. The royalist party, headed by General Poineau, had been distracted but impotent. The army, one hundred and fifteen strong, had gone solid for the new regime, and that had settled it. Mervo had then gone to sleep again. It was asleep when Mr. Scobell found it.  The financier's scheme was first revealed to M. d'Orby, the President of the Republic, a large, stout statesman with even more than the average Mervian instinct for slumber. He was asleep in a chair on the porch of his villa when Mr. Scobell paid his call, and it was not until the financier's secretary, who attended the seance in the capacity of interpreter, had rocked him vigorously from side to side for quite a minute that he displayed any signs of animation beyond a snore like the growling of distant thunder. When at length he opened his eyes, he perceived the nightmare-like form of Mr. Scobell standing before him, talking. The financier, impatient of delay, had begun to talk some moments before the great awakening.  \"Sir,\" Mr. Scobell was saying, \"I gotta proposition to which I'd like you to give your complete attention. Shake him some more, Crump. Sir, there's big money in it for all of us, if you and your crowd'll sit in. Money. _Lar' monnay_. No, that means change. What's money, Crump? _Arjong_? There's _arjong_ in it, Squire. Get that? Oh, shucks! Hand it to him in French, Crump.\"  Mr. Secretary Crump translated. The President blinked, and intimated that he would hear more. Mr. Scobell relighted his cigar-stump, and proceeded.  \"Say, you've heard of _Moosieer_ Blonk? Ask the old skeesicks if he's ever heard of _Mersyaw_ Blonk, Crump, the feller who started the gaming-tables at Monte Carlo.\"  Filtered through Mr. Crump, the question became intelligible to the President. He said he had heard of M. Blanc. Mr. Crump caught the reply and sent it on to Mr. Scobell, as the man on first base catches the ball and throws it to second.  Mr. Scobell relighted his cigar.  \"Well, I'm in that line. I'm going to put this island on the map just like old Doctor Blonk put Monte Carlo. I've been studying up all about the old man, and I know just what he did and how he did it. Monte Carlo was just such another jerkwater little place as this is before he hit it. The government was down to its last bean and wondering where the Heck its next meal-ticket was coming from, when in blows Mr. Man, tucks up his shirt-sleeves, and starts the tables. And after that the place never looked back. You and your crowd gotta get together and pass a vote to give me a gambling concession here, same as they did him. Scobell's my name. Hand him that, Crump.\"  Mr. Crump obliged once more. A gleam of intelligence came into the President's dull eye. He nodded once or twice. He talked volubly in French to Mr. Crump, who responded in the same tongue.  \"The idea seems to strike him, sir,\" said Mr. Crump.  \"It ought to, if he isn't a clam,\" replied Mr. Scobell. He started to relight his cigar, but after scorching the tip of his nose, bowed to the inevitable and threw the relic away.  \"See here,\" he said, having bitten the end off the next in order; \"I've thought this thing out from soup to nuts. There's heaps of room for another Monte Carlo. Monte's a dandy place, but it's not perfect by a long way. To start with, it's hilly. You have to take the elevator to get to the Casino, and when you've gotten to the end of your roll and want to soak your pearl pin, where's the hock-shop? Half a mile away up the side of a mountain. It ain't right. In my Casino there's going to be a resident pawnbroker inside the building, just off the main entrance. That's only one of a heap of improvements. Another is that my Casino's scheduled to be a home from home, a place you can be real cosy in. You'll look around you, and the only thing you'll miss will be mother's face. Yes, sir, there's no need for a gambling Casino to look and feel and smell like the reading-room at the British Museum. Comfort, coziness and convenience. That's the ticket I'm running on. Slip that to the old gink, Crump.\"  A further outburst of the French language from Mr. Crump, supplemented on the part of the \"old gink\" by gesticulations, interrupted the proceedings.  \"What's he saying now?\" asked Mr. Scobell.  \"He wants to know--\"  \"Don't tell. Let me guess. He wants to know what sort of a rake-off he and the other somnambulists will get--the darned old pirate! Is that it?\"  Mr. Crump said that that was just it.  \"That'll be all right,\" said Mr. Scobell. \"Old man Blong's offer to the Prince of Monaco was five hundred thousand francs a year--that's somewhere around a hundred thousand dollars in real money--and half the profits made by the Casino. That's my offer, too. See how that hits him, Crump.\"  Mr. Crump investigated.  \"He says he accepts gladly, on behalf of the Republic, sir,\" he announced.  M. d'Orby confirmed the statement by rising, dodging the cigar, and kissing Mr. Scobell on both cheeks.  \"Cut it out,\" said the financier austerely, breaking out of the clinch. \"We'll take the Apache Dance as read. Good-by, Squire. Glad it's settled. Now I can get busy.\"  He did. Workmen poured into Mervo, and in a very short time, dominating the town and reducing to insignificance the palace of the late Prince, once a passably imposing mansion, there rose beside the harbor a mammoth Casino of shining stone.  Imposing as was the exterior, it was on the interior that Mr. Scobell more particularly prided himself, and not without reason. Certainly, a man with money to lose could lose it here under the most charming conditions. It had been Mr. Scobell's object to avoid the cheerless grandeur of the rival institution down the coast. Instead of one large hall sprinkled with tables, each table had a room to itself,"]]]
