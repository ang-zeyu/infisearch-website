This is the stage coach and pretty soon the Indians will shoot at us!\"  \"Teddy Martin! if you're going to do that I'm not going to play!\" stormed Janet. \"You'll make Trouble fall out and get hurt. Come on, Trouble! Let us get out!\" she cried. Nicknack was going quite fast down the hill.  \"Wait till we get to the bottom,\" shouted Ted. \"G'lang there, pony!\" he cried to the goat.  \"Let me out!\" screamed Janet, \"I want to get out.\"  At the foot of the hill Teddy stopped the goat and Janet, taking Trouble with her, got out and walked back to the house.  \"What's the matter now?\" asked Mrs. Martin from the porch where she had come out to get a little fresh air.  \"Ted's playing Wild West in the goat-wagon,\" explained Janet.  \"Oh, Ted! Don't be so rough!\" begged his mother of her little son, who drove up just then.  \"Oh, I'm only playing Indians and stage coach,\" he said. \"You've got to go fast when the Indians are after you!\" and away he rode.  \"He's awful mean!\" declared Janet.  \"I don't know what's come over Ted of late,\" said Mrs. Martin to her husband, who came up the side street just then from his store.  \"What's he been doing?\" asked Mr. Martin.  \"Oh, he's been pretending he was a bucking bronco, like those Uncle Frank has on his ranch, and he tossed Trouble downstairs. But the baby didn't get hurt, fortunately. Now Ted's playing Wild West stagecoach with Nicknack and Janet got frightened and wouldn't ride.\"  \"Hum, I see,\" said Ted's father slowly. \"Our boy is getting older, I guess. He needs rougher play. Well, I think I've just the very thing to suit him, and perhaps Janet and all of us.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Mrs. Martin, as her husband drew a letter from his pocket.  \"This is an invitation from Uncle Frank for all of us to come out to his ranch in Montana for the summer,\" was the answer. \"We have been talking of going, you know, and now is a good chance. I can leave the store for a while, and I think it would do us all good--the children especially--to go West. So if you'd like it, well pack up and go.\"  \"Go where?\" asked Ted, driving around near the veranda in time to hear his father's last words.  \"Out to Uncle Frank's ranch,\" said Mr. Martin.  \"How would you like that?\" added his mother.  \"Could we have ponies to ride?\" asked Ted.  \"Yes, I think so.\"  \"Oh, what fun!\" cried Janet. \"I love a pony!\"  \"You'd be afraid of them!\" exclaimed Ted.  \"I would not! If they didn't jump up and down the way you did with Trouble on your back I wouldn't be afraid.\"  \"Pooh! that's the way bucking broncos always do, don't they, Daddy? I'm going to have a bronco!\"  \"Well, well see when we get there,\" said Daddy Martin. \"But since you all seem to like it, we'll go out West.\"  \"Can we take Nicknack?\" asked Teddy.  \"You won't need him if you have a pony,\" his father suggested.  \"No, that's so. Hurray! What fun we'll have!\"  \"Are there any Indians out there?\" asked Janet.  \"Well, a few, I guess,\" her father answered. \"But they're docile Indians--not wild. They won't hurt you. Now let's go in and talk about it.\"  The Curlytops asked all sorts of questions of their father about Uncle Frank's ranch, but though he could tell them, in a general way, what it looked like, Mr. Martin did not really know much about the place, as he had never been there.  \"But you'll find lots of horses, ponies and cattle there,\" he said.  \"And can we take Nicknack with us, to ride around the ranch?\" asked Jan, in her turn.  \"Oh, you won't want to do that,\" her father said. \"You'll have ponies to ride, I think.\"  \"What'll we do with Nicknack then?\" asked Ted.  \"We'll have to leave him with some neighbor until we come back,\" answered his father. \"I was thinking of asking Mr. Newton to take care of him. Bob Newton is a kind boy and he wouldn't harm your goat.\"  \"Yes, Bob is a good boy,\" agreed Teddy. \"I'd like him to have Nicknack.\"  \"Then, if it is all right with Mr. Newton, well take the goat over a few days before we leave for the West,\" said Mr. Martin. \"Bob will have a chance to get used to Nicknack, and Nicknack to him, before we go away.\"  \"Nicknack not come wif us?\" asked Trouble, not quite understanding what the talk was about.  \"No, we'll leave Nicknack here,\" said his father, as he cuddled the little fellow up in his lap. Trouble said nothing more just then but, afterward, Ted remembered that Baby William seemed to be thinking pretty hard about something.  A few days later, when some of the trunks had been partly packed, ready for the trip West, Mr. Martin came home early from the store and said to Jan and Ted:  \"I think you'd better get your goat ready now and take him over to Bob's house. I spoke to Mr. Newton about it, and he said there was plenty of room in his stable for a goat Bob is delighted to have him.\"  \"But hell give him back to us when we come home, won't he?\" asked Janet.  \"Oh, yes, of course! You won't lose your goat,\" said her father with a laugh.  But when they went out to the stable to harness Nicknack to the wagon, Ted and Janet rubbed their eyes and looked again.  \"Why, Nicknack is gone!\" exclaimed Ted.  \"He is,\" agreed his sister. \"Maybe Bob came and got him.\"  \"No, he wouldn't do that without telling us,\" went on Ted. \"I wonder where that goat is?\"  He looked around the stable yard and in the barn. No Nicknack was in sight.  When the Curlytops were searching they heard their mother calling to them from the house, where their father was waiting for them to come up with Nicknack. He was going over to Mr. Newton's with them.  \"Ho, Ted! Janet! Where are you?\" called Mrs. Martin.  \"Out here, Mother!\" Teddy answered.  \"Is Trouble there with you?\"  \"Trouble? No, he isn't here!\"  \"He isn't!\" exclaimed his mother. \"Where in the world can he be? Nora says she saw him going out to the barn a little while ago. Please find him!\"  \"Huh!\" exclaimed Ted. \"Trouble is gone and so is Nicknack! I s'pose they've gone together!\"  \"Well have to look,\" said Janet.     CHAPTER III  OFF FOR THE WEST   The Curlytops hurried toward the house, leaving open the empty little stable in which Nicknack was usually kept. They found their father and their mother looking around in the yard, Mrs. Martin had a worried air.  \"Couldn't you find him?\" asked Daddy Martin.  \"We didn't look--very much,\" answered Teddy. \"Nicknack is gone, and--\"  \"Nicknack gone!\" cried Mrs. Martin. \"I wonder if that little tyke of ours has gotten into trouble with him.\"  \"Nicknack wouldn't make any trouble,\" declared Jan. \"He's such a nice goat--\"  \"Yes, I know!\" said Mrs. Martin quickly. \"But it looks very much as though Trouble and Nicknack had gone off together. Is the goat's harness in the stable?\"  \"We didn't look,\" answered Teddy.  \"The wagon's gone,\" Janet said. \"I looked under the shed for that and it wasn't there.\"  \"Then I can just about guess what has happened,\" said Daddy Martin. \"Trouble heard as talking about taking Nicknack over to Mr. Newton's house, where he would be kept while we are at Uncle Frank's ranch, and the little fellow has just about taken the goat over himself.\"  \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Mrs. Martin. \"Trouble couldn't hitch the goat to the wagon and drive off with him.\"  \"Oh, yes he could, Mother!\" said Teddy. \"He's seen me and Janet hitch Nicknack up lots of times, and he's helped, too. At first he got the straps all crooked, but I showed him how to do it, and I guess he could 'most hitch the goat up himself now all alone.\"  \"Then that's what he's done,\" said Mr. Martin. \"Come on, Curlytops, we'll go over to Mr. Newton's and get Trouble.\"  \"I hope you find him all right,\" said Mrs. Martin, with a sigh.  \"Oh, we'll find him all right--don't worry,\" her husband answered.  Laughing among themselves at the trick Trouble had played, Janet, Teddy and Mr. Martin started for the home of Mr. Newton, which was three or four long streets away, toward the edge of the town.  On the way they looked here and there, in the yards of houses where the children often went to play.  \"For,\" said Mr. Martin, \"it might be possible that when Trouble found he could drive Nicknack, which he could do, as the goat is very gentle, he might have stopped on the way to play.\"  \"Yes, he might,\" said Jan. \"He's so cute!\"  But there was no sign of the little boy, nor the goat, either.  Finally Mr. Newton's house was reached. Into the yard rushed Janet and Teddy, followed by their father. Bob Newton was making a kite on the side porch.  \"Hello, Curlytop!\" he called to Ted. \"Want to help me fly this? It's going to be a dandy!\"  \"Yes, I'll help you,\" agreed Ted. \"But is he here?\"  \"Who here?\" asked Bob, in some surprise.  \"Nicknack, our goat,\" answered Teddy.  \"What! Is he lost?\" exclaimed Bob in some dismay, for he was counting on having much fun with the goat when the Curlytops went West.  \"Nicknack--\" began Ted.  \"Have you seen Trouble?\" broke in Janet.  \"Is he lost, too?\" Bob inquired. \"Say, I guess--\"  \"Our goat and little boy seem to have gone off together,\" explained Mr. Martin to Mrs. Newton who came out on the porch just then. \"We'd been talking before Trouble about bringing Nicknack over here, and now that both are missing we thought maybe Baby William had brought the goat over himself.\"  \"Why, no, he isn't here,\" said Mrs. Newton slowly. \"You didn't see anything of Trouble and the goat, did you?\" she asked her son.  \"No. I've been here making the kite all morning, and I'd have seen Nicknack all right, and Trouble, too, if they had come here.\"  \"Well, that's funny!\" exclaimed Mr. Martin. \"I wonder where he can have gone?\"  \"Maybe Nicknack ran away with him,\" suggested Bob.  \"Oh, don't say such things!\" exclaimed his mother.  \"I don't think that can have happened,\" returned Mr. Martin, \"Nicknack is a very gentle goat, and Trouble is used to playing with him all alone. He never yet has been hurt. Of course we are not sure that the two went away together. Trouble disappeared from the house, and he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6818"],["title","The Arctic Prairies : a Canoe-Journey of 2,000 Miles in Search of the Caribou; (#1)"],["body"," that has so uniformly done its best for the people it ruled.  At all times it has stood for peace, and one hears over and over again that such and such tribes were deadly enemies, but the Company insisted on their smoking the peace pipe. The Sioux and Ojibway, Black-Foot and Assiniboine., Dog-Rib and Copper-Knife, Beaver and Chipewyan, all offer historic illustrations in point, and many others could be found for the list.  The name Peace River itself is the monument of a successful effort on the part of the Company to bring about a better understanding between the Crees and the Beavers.  Besides human foes, the Company has saved the Indian from famine and plague. Many a hunger-stricken tribe owes its continued existence to the fatherly care of the Company, not simply general and indiscriminate, but minute and personal, carried into the details of their lives. For instance, when bots so pestered the Caribou of one region as to render their hides useless to the natives, the Company brought in hides from a district where they still were good.  The Chipewyans were each spring the victims of snow-blindness until the Company brought and succeeded in popularizing their present ugly but effectual and universal peaked hats. When their train-dogs were running down in physique, the Company brought in a strain of pure Huskies or Eskimo. When the Albany River Indians were starving and unable to hunt, the Company gave the order for 5,000 lodge poles. Then, not knowing how else to turn them to account, commissioned the Indians to work them into a picket garden-fence. At all times the native found a father in the Company, and it was the worst thing that ever happened the region when the irresponsible free-traders with their demoralizing methods were allowed to enter and traffic where or how they pleased.     CHAPTER II  DOWN THE NOISY RIVER WITH THE VOYAGEURS    At Athabaska Landing, on May 18, 1907, 10.15 A. M., we boarded the superb Peterborough canoe that I had christened the Ann Seton. The Athabaska River was a-flood and clear of ice; 13 scows of freight, with 60 half-breeds and Indians to man them, left at the same time, and in spite of a strong headwind we drifted northward fully 31 miles an hour.  The leading scow, where I spent some time, was in charge of John MacDonald himself, and his passengers comprised the Hudson's Bay Company officials, going to their posts or on tours of inspection. They were a jolly crowd, like a lot of rollicking schoolboys, full of fun and good-humour, chaffing and joking all day; but when a question of business came up, the serious businessman appeared in each, and the Company's interest was cared for with their best powers. The bottle was not entirely absent in these scow fraternities, but I saw no one the worse for liquor on the trip.  The men of mixed blood jabbered in French, Cree, and Chipewyan chiefly, but when they wanted to swear, they felt the inadequacy of these mellifluous or lisping tongues, and fell back on virile Saxon, whose tang, projectivity, and wealth of vile epithet evidently supplied a long-felt want in the Great Lone Land of the Dog and Canoe.  In the afternoon Preble and I pushed on in our boat, far in advance of the brigade. As we made early supper I received for the twentieth time a lesson in photography. A cock Partridge or Ruffed Grouse came and drummed on a log in open view, full sunlight, fifty feet away. I went quietly to the place. He walked off, but little alarmed. I set the camera eight feet from the log, with twenty-five feet of tubing, and retired to a good hiding-place. But alas! I put the tube on the left-hand pump, not knowing that that was a dummy. The Grouse came back in three minutes, drumming in a superb pose squarely in front of the camera. I used the pump, but saw that it failed to operate; on going forward the Grouse skimmed away and returned no more. Preble said, \"Never mind; there will be another every hundred yards all the way down the river, later on.\" I could only reply, \"The chance never comes but once,\" and so it proved. We heard Grouse drumming many times afterward, but the sun was low, or the places densely shaded, or the mosquitoes made conditions impossible for silent watching; the perfect chance came but once, as it always does, and I lost it.  About twenty miles below the Landing we found the abandoned winter hut of a trapper; on the roof were the dried up bodies of 1 Skunk, 2 Foxes, and 30 Lynxes, besides the bones of 2 Moose, showing the nature of the wild life about.  That night, as the river was brimming and safe, we tied up to the scows and drifted, making 30 more miles, or 60 since embarking.  In the early morning, I was much struck by the lifelessness of the scene. The great river stretched away northward, the hills rose abruptly from the water's edge, everywhere extended the superb spruce forest, here fortunately unburnt; but there seemed no sign of living creature outside of our own numerous, noisy, and picturesque party. River, hills, and woods were calm and silent. It was impressive, if disappointing; and, when at last the fir stillness was broken by a succession of trumpet notes from the Great Pileated Woodpecker, the sound went rolling on and on, in reverberating echoes that might well have alarmed the bird himself.  The white spruce forest along the banks is most inspiring, magnificent here. Down the terraced slopes and right to the water's edge on the alluvial soil it stands in ranks. Each year, of course, the floods undercut the banks, and more trees fall, to become at last the flotsam of the shore a thousand miles away.  There is something sad about these stately trees, densely packed, all a-row, unflinching, hopelessly awaiting the onset of the inexorable, invincible river. One group, somewhat isolated and formal, was a forest life parallel to Lady Butler's famous \"Roll Call of the Grenadiers.\"  At night we reached the Indian village of Pelican Portage, and landed by climbing over huge blocks of ice that were piled along the shore. The adult male inhabitants came down to our camp, so that the village was deserted, except for the children and a few women.  As I walked down the crooked trail along which straggle the cabins, I saw something white in a tree at the far end. Supposing it to be a White-rabbit in a snare, I went near and found, to my surprise, first that it was a dead house-cat, a rare species here; second, under it, eyeing it and me alternately, was a hungry-looking Lynx. I had a camera, for it was near sundown, and in the woods, so I went back to the boat and returned with a gun. There was the Lynx still prowling, but now farther from the village. I do not believe he would have harmed the children, but a Lynx is game. I fired, and he fell without a quiver or a sound. This was the first time I had used a gun in many years, and was the only time on the trip. I felt rather guilty, but the carcass was a godsend to two old Indians who were sickening on a long diet of salt pork, and that Lynx furnished them tender meat for three days afterward; while its skin and skull went to the American Museum.  On the night of May 20, we camped just above Grand Rapids--Preble and I alone, for the first time, under canvas, and glad indeed to get away from the noisy rabble of the boatmen, though now they were but a quarter mile off. At first I had found them amusing and picturesque, but their many unpleasant habits, their distinct aversion to strangers, their greediness to get all they could out of one, and do nothing in return, combined finally with their habit of gambling all night to the loud beating of a tin pan, made me thankful to quit their company for a time.  At Grand Rapids the scows were unloaded, the goods shipped over a quarter-mile hand tramway, on an island, the scows taken down a side channel, one by one, and reloaded. This meant a delay of three or four days, during which we camped on the island and gathered specimens.  Being the organizer, equipper, geographer, artist, head, and tail of the expedition, I was, perforce, also its doctor. Equipped with a \"pill-kit,\" an abundance of blisters and bandages and some \"potent purgatives,\" I had prepared myself to render first and last aid to the hurt in my own party. In taking instructions from our family physician, I had learned the value of a profound air of great gravity, a noble reticence, and a total absence of doubt, when I did speak. I compressed his creed into a single phrase: \"In case of doubt, look wise and work on his 'bowels.'\" This simple equipment soon gave me a surprisingly high standing among the men. I was a medicine man of repute, and soon had a larger practice than I desired, as it was entirely gratuitous.  The various boatmen, Indians and half-breeds, came with their troubles, and, thanks chiefly to their faith, were cured. But one day John MacDonald, the chief pilot and a mighty man on the river, came to my tent on Grand Island. John complained that he couldn't hold anything on his stomach; he was a total peristaltic wreck indeed (my words; his were more simple and more vivid, but less sonorous and professional). He said he had been going down hill for two weeks, and was so bad now that he was \"no better than a couple of ordinary men.\"  \"Exactly so,\" I said. \"Now you take these pills and you'll be all right in the morning.\" Next morning John was back, and complained that my pills had no effect; he wanted to feel something take hold of him. Hadn't 1 any pepper-juice or brandy?  I do not take liquor on an expedition, but at the last moment a Winnipeg friend had given me a pint flask of pure brandy--\"for emergencies.\" An emergency had come.  \"John! you shall have some extra fine brandy, nicely thinned with pepper-juice.\" I poured half an inch of brandy into a tin cup, then added half an inch of \"pain-killer.\"  \"Here, take this, and if you don't feel it, it means your insides are dead, and you may as well order your coffin.\"  John took it at a"]]]
