It is very evident that, at the close of September, Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Stanton had become satisfied that a radical change must be made in the organization of the Western armies. The plan of sending separate armies to co-operate, as Rosecrans's and Burnside's had been expected to do, was in itself vicious. It is, after a fashion, an attempt of two to ride a horse without one of them riding behind. Each will form a plan for his own army, as indeed he ought to do, and when one of them thinks the time has come for help from the other, that other may be out of reach or committed to operations which cannot readily be dropped. It is almost axiomatic that in any one theatre of operations there must be one head to direct. [Footnote: Napoleon used to ridicule the vicious practice of subdividing armies in the same theatre of war. He called it putting them up in small parcels, \"_des petits paquets_.\" Memoirs of Gouvion St.-Cyr, vol. iv.] In the present case it ought to have been evident to the authorities at Washington that as soon as Burnside occupied East Tennessee, both distance and the peculiar conditions of his problem would forbid any efficient cooperation with Rosecrans. The latter was the junior in rank, and knew that, whatever might be Burnside's generosity, there were many possible contingencies in such a campaign in which the War Department might find it the easy solution of a difficulty to direct the senior officer to assume the command of both armies. So long as matters went well, Rosecrans had little or no communication with Burnside; but as soon as the enemy began to show a bold front, he became impatient for assistance. The perplexities of his own situation made him blind to those of Burnside. This is human nature, and was, no doubt, true of both in varying degrees. Halleck, at Washington, was in no true sense a commander of the armies. He had given peremptory orders to advance in June and again in July, but when asked whether this relieved the subordinate of responsibility and took away his discretion, could make no distinct answer. The unpleasant relations thus created necessarily affected the whole campaign. Halleck hesitated to advise a halt when he learned that Longstreet had gone to reinforce Bragg, and Rosecrans dreaded the blame of halting without such suggestion. So the battle had to be fought, and the ill consequences had to be repaired afterward as best they could.  The official correspondence of the summer shows a constantly growing faith in Grant. His great success at Vicksburg gave him fame and prestige, but there was beside this a specific effect produced on the President and the War Department by his unceasing activity, his unflagging zeal, his undismayed courage. He was as little inclined to stop as they at Washington were inclined to have him. He was as ready to move as they were to ask it, and anticipated their wish. He took what was given him and did the best he could with it. The result was that the tone adopted toward him was very different from that used with any other commander. It was confidently assumed that he was doing all that was possible, and there was no disposition to worry him with suggestions or orders.  When the operations in the Mississippi valley were reduced to secondary importance by the surrender of Vicksburg, it was certain that Grant would be called to conduct one of the great armies which must still make war upon the rebellion. In a visit to New Orleans to consult with Banks, he had been lamed by a fractious horse and was disabled for some days. As soon as he was able to ride in an ambulance he was on duty, and was assured by General Halleck that plenty of work would be cut out for him as soon as he was fully recovered. [Footnote: Official Records, vol. xxx. pt. iv. p. 274.] At the beginning of October he was ordered to take steamboat and go to Cairo, where he would find special instructions. This dispatch reached him on the 9th, and the same day he sailed for Cairo, arriving there on the 16th, when he learned that an officer of the War Department would meet him at Louisville. Hastening to Louisville by rail, he met Mr. Stanton himself, who had travelled _incognito_ from Washington. The Secretary of War produced the formal orders which had been drawn at the War Department creating the Division of the Mississippi, which included Rosecrans's, Burnside's, and his own departments, and put him in supreme command of all. [Footnote: _Id_., p. 404.] The order was drawn in two forms, one relieving Rosecrans and putting Thomas in command of the Department of the Cumberland, and the other omitting this. After consultation with Mr. Stanton, the order relieving Rosecrans was issued and Grant published his own assumption of command. His staff had accompanied him, on a hint contained in an earlier dispatch, and after a day spent with the Secretary of War (October 18-19) he immediately proceeded to Chattanooga. He was hardly able to mount a horse, and when on foot had to get about on crutches.  It has been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/697"],["title","The Light Princess (#1)"],["body","red rose-leaves all over the little white sleeper.  Startled by the noise the servants made, she woke, and, furious with glee, scattered the rose-leaves in all directions, like a shower of spray in the sunset.  She was watched more carefully after this, no doubt; yet it would be endless to relate all the odd incidents resulting from this peculiarity of the young princess.  But there never was a baby in a house, not to say a palace, that kept the household in such constant good humour, at least below-stairs.  If it was not easy for her nurses to hold her, at least she made neither their arms nor their hearts ache.  And she was so nice to play at ball with!  There was positively no danger of letting her fall.  They might throw her down, or knock her down, or push her down, but couldn't let her down.  It is true, they might let her fly into the fire or the coal-hole, or through the window; but none of these accidents had happened as yet.  If you heard peals of laughter resounding from some unknown region, you might be sure enough of the cause.  Going down into the kitchen, or the room, you would find Jane and Thomas, and Robert and Susan, all and sum, playing at ball with the little princess.  She was the ball herself, and did not enjoy it the less for that.  Away she went, flying from one to another, screeching with laughter.  And the servants loved the ball itself better even than the game.  But they had to take some care how they threw her, for if she received an upward direction, she would never come down again without being fetched.    5.  What Is to Be Done?  But above-stairs it was different.  One day, for instance, after breakfast, the king went into his counting-house, and counted out his money.  The operation gave him no pleasure.  \"To think,\" said he to himself, \"that every one of these gold sovereigns weighs a quarter of an ounce, and my real, live, flesh-and-blood princess weighs nothing at all!\"  And he hated his gold sovereigns, as they lay with a broad smile of self-satisfaction all over their yellow faces.  The queen was in the parlour, eating bread and honey.  But at the second mouthful she burst out crying, and could not swallow it.  The king heard her sobbing.  Glad of anybody, but especially of his queen, to quarrel with, he clashed his gold sovereigns into his money-box, clapped his crown on his head, and rushed into the parlour.  \"What is all this about?\" exclaimed he.  \"What are you crying for, queen?\"  \"I can't eat it,\" said the queen, looking ruefully at the honey-pot.  \"No wonder!\" retorted the king.  \"You've just eaten your breakfast--two turkey eggs, and three anchovies.\"  \"Oh, that's not it!\" sobbed her Majesty.  \"It's my child, my child!\"  \"Well, what's the matter with your child?  She's neither up the chimney nor down the draw-well.  Just hear her laughing.\"  Yet the king could not help a sigh, which he tried to turn into a cough, saying--  \"It is a good thing to be light-hearted, I am sure, whether she be ours or not.\"  \"It is a bad thing to be light-headed,\" answered the queen, looking with prophetic soul far into the future.  \"'Tis a good thing to be light-handed,\" said the king.  \"'Tis a bad thing to be light-fingered,\" answered the queen.  \"'Tis a good thing to be light-footed,\" said the king.  \"'Tis a bad thing--\" began the queen; but the king interrupted her.  \"In fact,\" said he, with the tone of one who concludes an argument in which he has had only imaginary opponents, and in which, therefore, he has come off triumphant--\"in fact, it is a good thing altogether to be light-bodied.\"  \"But it is a bad thing altogether to be light-minded,\" retorted the queen, who was beginning to lose her temper.  This last answer quite discomfited his Majesty, who turned on his heel, and betook himself to his counting-house again.  But he was not half-way towards it, when the voice of his queen overtook him.  \"And it's a bad thing to be light-haired,\" screamed she, determined to have more last words, now that her spirit was roused.  The queen's hair was black as night; and the king's had been, and his daughter's was, golden as morning.  But it was not this reflection on his hair that arrested him; it was the double use of the word light. For the king hated all witticisms, and punning especially.  And besides, he could not tell whether the queen meant light-haired or light-heired; for why might she not aspirate her vowels when she was exasperated herself?  He turned upon his other heel, and rejoined her.  She looked angry still, because she knew that she was guilty, or, what was much the same, knew that HE thought so.  \"My dear queen,\" said he, \"duplicity of any sort is exceedingly objectionable between married people of any rank, not to say kings and queens; and the most objectionable form duplicity can assume is that of punning.\"  \"There!\" said the queen, \"I never made a jest, but I broke it in the making.  I am the most unfortunate woman in the world!\"  She looked so rueful, that the king took her in his arms; and they sat down to consult.  \"Can you bear this?\" said the king.  \"No, I can't,\" said the queen.  \"Well, what's to be done?\" said the king.  \"I'm sure I don't know,\" said the queen.  \"But might you not try an apology?\"  \"To my old sister, I suppose you mean?\" said the king.  \"Yes,\" said the queen.  \"Well, I don't mind,\" said the king.  So he went the next morning to the house of the princess, and, making a very humble apology, begged her to undo the spell.  But the princess declared, with a grave face, that she knew nothing at all about it. Her eyes, however, shone pink, which was a sign that she was happy. She advised the king and queen to have patience, and to mend their ways.  The king returned disconsolate.  The queen tried to comfort him.  \"We will wait till she is older.  She may then be able to suggest something herself.  She will know at least how she feels, and explain things to us.\"  \"But what if she should marry?\" exclaimed the king, in sudden consternation at the idea.  \"Well, what of that?\" rejoined the queen.  \"Just think!  If she were to have children!  In the course of a hundred years the air might be as full of floating children as of gossamers in autumn.\"  \"That is no business of ours,\" replied the queen.  \"Besides, by that time they will have learned to take care of themselves.\"  A sigh was the king's only answer.  He would have consulted the court physicians; but he was afraid they would try experiments upon her.    6.  She Laughs Too Much.  Meantime, notwithstanding awkward occurrences, and griefs that she brought upon her parents, the little princess laughed and grew--not fat, but plump and tall.  She reached the age of seventeen, without having fallen into any worse scrape than a chimney; by rescuing her from which, a little bird-nesting urchin got fame and a black face. Nor, thoughtless as she was, had she committed anything worse than laughter at everybody and everything that came in her way.  When she was told, for the sake of experiment, that General Clanrunfort was cut to pieces with all his troops, she laughed; when she heard that the enemy was on his way to besiege her papa's capital, she laughed hugely; but when she was told that the city would certainly be abandoned to the mercy of the enemy's soldiery--why, then she laughed immoderately.  She never could be brought to see the serious side of anything.  When her mother cried, she said,--  \"What queer faces mamma makes!  And she squeezes water out of her cheeks?  Funny mamma!\"  And when her papa stormed at her, she laughed, and danced round and round him, clapping her hands, and crying--  \"Do it again, papa.  Do it again!  It's SUCH fun!  Dear, funny papa!\"  And if he tried to catch her, she glided from him in an instant, not in the least afraid of him, but thinking it part of the game not to be caught.  With one push of her foot, she would be floating in the air above his head; or she would go dancing backwards and forwards and sideways, like a great butterfly.  It happened several times, when her father and mother were holding a consultation about her in private, that they were interrupted by vainly repressed outbursts of laughter over their heads; and looking up with indignation, saw her floating at full length in the air above them, whence she regarded them with the most comical appreciation of the position.  One day an awkward accident happened.  The princess had come out upon the lawn with one of her attendants, who held her by the hand.  Spying her father at the other side of the lawn, she snatched her hand from the maid's, and sped across to him.  Now when she wanted to run alone, her custom was to catch up a stone in each hand, so that she might come down again after a bound.  Whatever she wore as part of her attire had no effect in this way: even gold, when it thus became as it were a part of herself, lost all its weight for the time.  But whatever she only held in her hands retained its downward tendency.  On this occasion she could see nothing to catch up but a huge toad, that was walking across the lawn as if he had a hundred years to do it in.  Not knowing what disgust meant, for this was one of her peculiarities, she snatched up the toad and bounded away.  She had almost reached her father, and he was holding out his arms to receive her, and take from her lips the kiss which hovered on them like a butterfly on a rosebud, when a puff of wind blew her aside into the arms of a young page, who had just been receiving a message from his Majesty.  Now it was no great peculiarity in the princess that, once she was set agoing, it always cost her time and trouble to check herself.  On this occasion there was no time.  She must kiss-and she kissed the page.  She did not mind it much; for she had no shyness in her composition; and she knew, besides, that she could not help it.  So she only laughed, like a musical box.  The poor page fared the worst.  For the princess, trying to correct the"]]]
