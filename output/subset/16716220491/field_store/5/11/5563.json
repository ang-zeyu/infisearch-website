And I simply adore bad men, so I'm going to dance with him.\"  Naughty Patty went dancing off with Van Reypen, and Ken looked after them, a little crestfallen.  \"But,\" he thought, \"there's no use being angry or even annoyed at that butterfly of a girl. She doesn't mean anything anyway. Some day, she'll wake up and be serious, but now she's only a little bundle of frivolity.\"  Kenneth had been friends with Patty for many years; far longer than any of her other young men acquaintances. He was honestly fond of her, and had a dawning hope that some time they might be more than friends. But he was a slow-going chap, and he was inclined to wait until he had a little more to offer, before he should woo the pretty butterfly.  And, too, Patty would never listen to a word of that sort of thing. She had often proclaimed in his hearing, that she intended to enjoy several years of gay society pleasures, before she would be engaged to any one.  So Kenneth idly watched her, as she circled the room with Van Reypen, and took himself off to find another partner.  \"Oh, Valentine, fair Valentine,\" said Van Reypen to Patty, as they danced.  \"Wilt thou be mine, and I'lt be thine,\" returned Patty, in mocking sing-song tones.  \"Forever may our hearts entwine,\" improvised Philip, in tune to the music.  \"Like chickwood round a punkin-vine,\" Patty finished.  \"Pshaw, that's not sentimental. You should have said, Like sturdy oak and clinging vine.\"  \"But I'm not sentimental. Who could be in a crowded ballroom, in a glare of light, and in a mad dance?\"  \"What conditions would make you feel sentimental?\"  \"Why,--let me see. Moonlight,--on a balcony,--with the right man.\"  \"I'm the right man, all right,--and you know it. And if I'm not greatly mistaken, here's moonlight and a balcony!\"  Sure enough, a long French window had been set slightly ajar to cool the overheated room, and almost before she knew it, Patty was whisked outside.  \"Oh, Philip! Don't! you mustn't! I'll take cold. I ought to have something around me.\"  \"You have,\" said Van Reypen, calmly, and as he had not yet released her from the dance he held his arms lightly round her shoulders.  Patty was angry. She knew Philip loved her,--several times he had asked her to marry him,--but this was taking an unfair advantage.  The February wind itself was not colder than the manner with which she drew away from him, and stepped back into the ballroom.  \"My dear, my dear,\" exclaimed Mrs. Homer, who chanced to be near, \"how imprudent! You should not go out without a wrap.\"  \"I know it, Mrs. Homer,\" and Patty looked so sweetly penitent that her hostess could but smile at her. \"But, truly, I just stepped out a single second to get a tiny breath of air. The room IS warm, isn't it? May I stay here by you a few moments?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" and Mrs. Homer drew the girl down beside her on the sofa. \"You're not robust, my child, and you mustn't run foolish risks.\"  \"You're quite right, and I won't do it again. But on a night not quite so cold, that balcony, flooded with moonlight, must be a romantic spot.\"  \"It is, indeed,\" said Mrs. Homer, smiling. \"My young people think so; and I hope you will have many opportunities in the future to see it for yourself.\"  \"Your young people? Have you other children besides Marie?\"  \"Yes; I have a daughter who is away at boarding-school. And, also, I have a nephew, whose home is in this same building.\"  \"Is he here to-night?\"  \"No; Kit hates dances. Of course, that's because he doesn't dance himself. He's a musician.\"  \"Kit? What a funny name.\"  \"It's Christopher, really, Christopher Cameron; but he's such a happy-go-lucky sort of chap, we naturally call him Kit.\"  \"I think I should like him,\" said Patty. \"Would he like me?\"  \"No,\" said Mrs. Homer, her eyes twinkling at Patty's look of amazement. \"He detests girls. Even my daughters, his cousins, are nuisances, he says. Still he likes to come down here and sit on my balcony, and tease them. He lives with his parents in the apartment just above us.\"  \"He sounds an interesting youth,\" said Patty, and then, as Roger came up and asked her for a dance, she promptly forgot the musical nephew.  At supper-time, Patty's crowd of intimates gathered around her, and they occupied a pleasant corner of the dining-room.  \"What'll you have, Patsums?\" asked Roger, as a waiter brought a tray full of dainty viands.  \"Sandwiches and bouillon,\" said Patty, promptly; \"I'm honestly hungry.\"  \"The result of exercise in the open air,\" murmured Philip Van Reypen, as he took a seat directly behind her.  Patty gave an involuntary giggle, and then turned upon Philip what she meant to be an icy glare. He grinned back at her, which made her furious, and she deliberately and ostentatiously ignored him.  \"Hello, you two on the outs?\" inquired Kenneth, casually.  \"Oh, no!\" said Philip, with emphasis; \"far from it!\"  So, as Patty found it impossible to snub such cheerfulness, she concluded to forgive and forget.  \"There's something doing after supper,\" remarked Roger. \"Miss Homer dropped a hint, and even now they're fixing something in the ballroom.\"  \"What can it be?\" said Elise, craning her neck to see through a doorway.  \"It's a game,\" said Marie Homer, who had just joined the group. \"I told mother, you all considered yourselves too grown-up for games, but she said she didn't want to have the whole evening given over to dancing. So you will play it, won't you?\"  \"Sure we will!\" declared Kenneth, who admired the shy little girl.  Marie was new in their set, but they all liked her. She was timid only because she felt unacquainted, and the good-natured crowd did all they could to put her at ease.  \"Games!\" exclaimed Philip; \"why, I just love 'em! I'll play it, whatever it is.\"  \"I too,\" said Patty. \"It will be a jolly change from dancing.\"     CHAPTER II  ON THE TELEPHONE   When the young people returned to the ballroom, it presented a decidedly changed appearance. Instead of an interior scene, it was a winter landscape.  The floor was covered with snow-white canvas, not laid on smoothly, but rumpled over bumps and hillocks, like a real snow field. The numerous palms and evergreens that had decorated the room, were powdered with flour and strewn with tufts of cotton, like snow. Also diamond dust had been lightly sprinkled on them, and glittering crystal icicles hung from the branches.  At each end of the room, on the wall, hung a beautiful bear-skin rug.  These rugs were for prizes, one for the girls and one for the boys. And this was the game.  The girls were gathered at one end of the room and the boys at the other, and one end was called the North Pole, and the other the South Pole. Each player was given a small flag which they were to plant on reaching the Pole.  This would have been an easy matter, but each traveller was obliged to wear snowshoes. These were not the real thing, but smaller affairs made of pasteboard. But when they were tied on, the wearer felt clumsy indeed, and many of the girls declared they could not walk in them at all. And in addition each one was blindfolded.  However, everybody made an attempt, and at a given signal the young people started from their opposite ends of the room and endeavoured to make progress toward the goal as they blindly stumbled along.  Patty concluded to move very slowly, thinking this the surest way to make a successful trip. So she scuffled along among the other laughing girls, now and then stumbling over a hillock, which was really a hassock or a sofa cushion under the white floor covering. It was great fun, and the girls cheered each other on as they pursued their blinded way. And then about midway of the room they met the boys coming toward them. Then there was scrambling, indeed, as the explorers tried to get out of each other's way and follow their own routes.  It was a very long room, and Patty hadn't gone much more than halfway, when she concluded to give up the race as being too tiresome. She made her way to the side of the room, and reaching the wall she took off her blinding handkerchief and kicked off the snowshoes. To her great surprise she found that many of the other girls and some of the boys had done the same thing, and not half of the original contestants were still in the race. And, indeed, it proved to be much greater fun to watch those who were still blindly groping along, than to stay in the game.  At last the game was concluded, as Roger Farrington proudly planted his flag at the very spot that designated the North Pole, and not long after, Clementine Morse succeeded in safely reaching the South Pole. So the beautiful rugs were given to these two as prizes, and every one agreed that they had earned them.  Then, amid much laughter, everybody was unblindfolded, and they all sat around on the snow mounds waiting for the next game.  A big snow man was brought in and set in the centre of the room. Of course it was not real snow, but made of white plaster, gleaming all over with diamond dust. But it was the traditional type of snow man, with a top hat on, and grotesque features.  In the mouth of the figure was a cigarette, and each guest was presented with a few snowballs, made of cotton wool. The game was to knock the cigarette from the snow man's mouth with one of the snowballs.  Of course the cigarette was so arranged that the lightest touch of a ball would dislodge it, and as one cigarette was displaced, Mr. Homer supplied another.  The guests had been divided into two parties, and each side strove to collect the greater number of cigarettes.  Some balls flew very wide of the mark, while others with unerring aim would hit a cigarette squarely.  The game caused great hilarity, and everybody was anxious to throw balls. They threw in turn, each having three balls at a time.  Patty was especially deft at this, and with true aim succeeded several times.  Then when they tired of this play, a few more dances followed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5631"],["title","Patty's Suitors (#2)"],["body","it was time to go home.  Some attendants came in and whisked away the snow hillocks and floor covering, leaving the ballroom once again in order for dancing.  \"Makes me feel young again, to play those kiddy games,\" said Kenneth, as he was dancing with Patty.  \"I like them,\" returned Patty; \"I hate to think that my childhood is over, and I love games of any kind.\"  \"Your childhood will never be over,\" returned Kenneth; \"I think you are the incarnation of youth, and always will be.\"  \"I'm not so much younger than you.\"  \"Five years,--that's a long time at our age. By the way, when are the Hepworths coming home?\"  \"Next week; and we're planning the loveliest reception for them. You know their apartment is all ready, and we're going to have just a few people to supper there, the night they return.\"  \"Shall I be one of the few?\"  \"Well, rather! The best man at the wedding must surely be at the home-coming. Doesn't it seem funny to think of Christine as mistress of her own home? She'll be perfectly lovely, I know. My goodness gracious! Ken, what time is it? I'm afraid I'm staying too late. I promised Nan I'd leave at half-past twelve.\"  \"It's not much more than that. Can't you stay for another dance?\"  \"No, I can't possibly. I must run right away, or my motor car will turn into a pumpkin, and Louise into a white mouse. Take me to Mrs. Homer, please, and I will say good-night to her.\"  But as they crossed the room, they met Van Reypen coming toward them.  \"Our dance, I think,\" he said, coolly, as he took Patty's hand.  The music had just started, and its beautiful rhythm was too tempting for Patty to resist.  \"I'm just on my way home,\" she said, \"but we'll go around the room once, and then I must go.\"  \"Once indeed!\" said Philip, gaily; \"we won't stop until the music does.\"  \"Yes, we will; I must go now,\" but somehow or other they circled the room several times. Patty loved dancing, and Philip was one of the best of partners.  But at last she laughingly protested that she really must go home, and they went together to say good-night to their hostess. And then Patty said good-night to Philip, and ran away to the dressing-room, where Louise was patiently waiting for her.  And soon, muffled up in her furs, they were rapidly spinning along toward home.  \"I didn't keep you waiting very long, did I, Louise?\" said Patty, kindly.  \"No, Miss Patty, you're right on time. I expect you would have liked to stay longer.\"  \"Yes, I should, but I promised Mrs. Fairfield not to.\"  When at last Patty reached her own little boudoir, she declared she was more tired than she had realised. So Louise took off her pretty frock, and Patty sat in her blue silk dressing gown while the maid brushed her hair. Then she brought her a cup of hot milk, and left her for the night.  Patty wasn't sleepy, and she dawdled around her room, now and then sipping the milk, and then looking over her engagements for the next day.  \"Oh,\" she thought, suddenly, \"I've left my fan at the party. I'm sorry, for it's my pet fan. Of course it will be safe there, but I think I'll telephone Marie to look it up and put it away.\"  Knowing that the Homers would not yet have retired, Patty picked up her telephone and called the number.  A masculine voice gave back a cheery \"Hello!\"  \"Is this Mr. Homer?\" said Patty.  \"No, indeed. I'm Kit Cameron. Who are you, please?\"  \"Isn't this The Wimbledon apartment house?\"  \"It sure is.\"  \"Isn't this 6483?\"  \"No, it's 6843. Please tell me who you are?\"  A spirit of mischief entered into Patty. She knew this must be Marie Homer's cousin, who lived on the floor above the Homers, and who, Mrs. Homer had said, detested girls.  \"But I have the wrong number,\" she said. \"I didn't mean to call you.\"  \"But since you did call me, you must tell me who you are.\"  \"I'm a captive princess,\" said Patty, in rather a melancholy tone. \"I'm imprisoned in the dungeon of a castle.\"  \"How awful! May I get a squad of soldiers and come to your rescue, oh, fair lady?\"  \"Nay, nay, Sir Knight; and anyway you do not know that I am a fair lady.\"  \"Your voice tells me that. Surely such musical tones could belong only to the most beautiful princess in the world.\"  \"Oh, yes, I am THAT,\" and Patty laughed, roguishly; \"but a well-behaved princess would not be talking to a strange man. So I must say good-bye.\"  \"Oh, no, no! wait a minute; you haven't told me your name yet.\"  \"And I don't intend to. You detest girls, anyway.\"  \"Yes, I always have, but you see I never met a princess before.\"  \"You haven't met me yet.\"  \"But I shall! Don't make any mistake about that.\"  \"How can you? I'm going to ring off now, and you have no way of tracing me.\"  \"I can find out from Central.\"  \"No, you can't.\"  \"Why can't I?\"  \"Because I forbid you to do so.\"  \"All right; then I can't find out that way, but I'll find out some other way. I'll go on a quest.\"  \"Goodness, what is a quest?\"  \"Oh, it just means that I henceforth devote my whole life to finding you.\"  \"But you can't find me, when you don't know my name.\"  \"I'll make up a name for you. I'll call you Princess Poppycheek.\"  \"How could you guess I'm a brunette?\"  \"I can tell it from your voice. You have snapping black eyes and dark curly hair, and the reddest of red cheeks.\"  \"Exactly right!\" exclaimed Patty, giggling to think how far this description was from her blonde pink-and-white type.  \"I knew it was right!\" exclaimed the voice, exultantly; \"and I shall find you very soon.\"  \"Then I shall await your coming with interest. You prefer brunettes, do you?\"  \"Well, as a matter of fact, I have always admired blondes more, but I'm quite willing to change my tastes for you. Do you sing?\"  For answer, Patty sang softly into the telephone, the little song of \"Beware, take care, she is fooling thee.\"  Although she did little more than hum it, Mr. Cameron was greatly impressed with her voice.  \"By jove!\" he exclaimed. \"You CAN sing! Now, I can find you easily. There are not many voices like that in this wicked world.\"  \"Do you sing yourself? But I don't want to know, I haven't the least interest in a stranger, and besides, I'm going to ring off now.\"  \"Oh, wait a minute! I don't sing, but I do something better. Don't ring off, just listen a minute.\"  Patty listened, and in a moment she heard a violin played softly. It was played by a master hand, and she heard an exquisite rendition of the \"Spring Song.\"  \"Beautiful!\" she exclaimed, as the last notes died away, and then suddenly realising that she herself was acting in a most unconventional manner, she said abruptly, \"Thank you; good-bye,\" and quickly hung up her receiver.  For some time she sat thinking about it. Curled up in a big easy chair, her blue silk boudoir gown trailing around her, she sat giggling over her escapade.  \"It's all right,\" she assured herself, \"for of course I know who he is, though he doesn't know me. He is Mrs. Homer's nephew, so it's just the same as if I had met him properly. And, anyhow, he hasn't an idea who I am, and he never can find out from the description he has of me!\"  Still giggling over the episode, Patty went to bed and to sleep.  The next morning, as she thought it over, she realised that she hadn't succeeded in securing her fan, and she determined to go around and see Marie that afternoon, and get it.  So that afternoon she went to make her call.  \"It was a beautiful party,\" she said to Marie, as the two girls chatted together. \"I love games for a change from dancing, and the games you had were so novel.\"  \"I'm glad to hear you say that,\" said Marie, \"for I was afraid they would seem too childish.\"  \"No, indeed,\" returned Patty; \"and now put on your hat and come out with me for a little while. I'm going to a picture exhibition, and I'd love to have you go too. But first, did I leave my fan here last evening?\"  \"There was a beautiful fan left here,--an Empire fan. Is this yours?\"  Marie produced the fan and Patty recognised it as her own.  \"But I can't go this afternoon,\" said Marie, \"because Cousin Kit is coming down to practise some new music. Won't you stay and hear him play? He is really a very good violinist.\"  Patty considered. She rather wanted to meet this young man, but she was afraid he would think her forward. So after a little further chat, she rose, saying she must go. And it was just as she was going out that Mr. Cameron came in, with his violin under his arm.  Patty was obliged to pause a moment, as Marie presented her cousin, but the young man, though courteous, showed no interest whatever in Miss Fairfield. Patty's pretty face was almost invisible through her motor veil, and as Mr. Cameron had no idea that she was the girl who had talked to him the night before, and as he really had no interest in girls in general, he merely made a very polite bow and went directly toward the piano.  \"I wish you'd stay and hear some music,\" said Marie, but Patty only murmured a refusal, not wanting Mr. Cameron to hear her voice, lest he recognise it.  He was an attractive looking man of fine physique and handsome face, but he looked extremely dignified and not very good-natured.  \"All musicians are cross,\" Patty thought to herself as she went down in the elevator, \"and I wasn't going to have that man think that I went around to Marie's to see him!\"  She decided to call for Elise to go to the art gallery with her, and she found that young woman ready and glad to go.  \"I hadn't a thing to do this afternoon,\" said Elise, as they started off, \"and I love to go anywhere with you, Patty. Shall we have a cup of tea afterwards?\"  And so it was after they had seen the pictures, and as they were sitting in a cosy little tea-room, that Elise said suddenly:  \"Do you know Mr. Cameron? He's a cousin of Marie Homer's.\"  \"I don't know him,\" said Patty, smiling, \"but I've been introduced to him. Just as I was leaving Marie's to-day, he came in. But he was very abstracted in his manner. He merely bowed, and without a word he went straight on to the piano and"]]]
