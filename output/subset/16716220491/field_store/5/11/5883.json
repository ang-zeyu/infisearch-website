How, then, may you accomplish the impossible?”  “Access may be had to any cell of the temple at any time,” replied Thurid. “Only Issus knew this; nor was it ever Issus’ way to divulge more of her secrets than were necessary. By chance, after her death, I came upon an ancient plan of the temple, and there I found, plainly writ, the most minute directions for reaching the cells at any time.  “And more I learned—that many men had gone thither for Issus in the past, always on errands of death and torture to the prisoners; but those who thus learned the secret way were wont to die mysteriously immediately they had returned and made their reports to cruel Issus.”  “Let us proceed, then,” said Matai Shang at last. “I must trust you, yet at the same time you must trust me, for we are six to your one.”  “I do not fear,” replied Thurid, “nor need you. Our hatred of the common enemy is sufficient bond to insure our loyalty to each other, and after we have defiled the Princess of Helium there will be still greater reason for the maintenance of our allegiance—unless I greatly mistake the temper of her lord.”  Matai Shang spoke to the paddlers. The boat moved on up the tributary.  It was with difficulty that I restrained myself from rushing upon them and slaying the two vile plotters; but quickly I saw the mad rashness of such an act, which would cut down the only man who could lead the way to Dejah Thoris’ prison before the long Martian year had swung its interminable circle.  If he should lead Matai Shang to that hallowed spot, then, too, should he lead John Carter, Prince of Helium.  With silent paddle I swung slowly into the wake of the larger craft.     UNDER THE MOUNTAINS   As we advanced up the river which winds beneath the Golden Cliffs out of the bowels of the Mountains of Otz to mingle its dark waters with the grim and mysterious Iss the faint glow which had appeared before us grew gradually into an all-enveloping radiance.  The river widened until it presented the aspect of a large lake whose vaulted dome, lighted by glowing phosphorescent rock, was splashed with the vivid rays of the diamond, the sapphire, the ruby, and the countless, nameless jewels of Barsoom which lay incrusted in the virgin gold which forms the major portion of these magnificent cliffs.  Beyond the lighted chamber of the lake was darkness—what lay behind the darkness I could not even guess.  To have followed the thern boat across the gleaming water would have been to invite instant detection, and so, though I was loath to permit Thurid to pass even for an instant beyond my sight, I was forced to wait in the shadows until the other boat had passed from my sight at the far extremity of the lake.  Then I paddled out upon the brilliant surface in the direction they had taken.  When, after what seemed an eternity, I reached the shadows at the upper end of the lake I found that the river issued from a low aperture, to pass beneath which it was necessary that I compel Woola to lie flat in the boat, and I, myself, must need bend double before the low roof cleared my head.  Immediately the roof rose again upon the other side, but no longer was the way brilliantly lighted. Instead only a feeble glow emanated from small and scattered patches of phosphorescent rock in wall and roof.  Directly before me the river ran into this smaller chamber through three separate arched openings.  Thurid and the therns were nowhere to be seen—into which of the dark holes had they disappeared? There was no means by which I might know, and so I chose the center opening as being as likely to lead me in the right direction as another.  Here the way was through utter darkness. The stream was narrow—so narrow that in the blackness I was constantly bumping first one rock wall and then another as the river wound hither and thither along its flinty bed.  Far ahead I presently heard a deep and sullen roar which increased in volume as I advanced, and then broke upon my ears with all the intensity of its mad fury as I swung round a sharp curve into a dimly lighted stretch of water.  Directly before me the river thundered down from above in a mighty waterfall that filled the narrow gorge from side to side, rising far above me several hundred feet—as magnificent a spectacle as I ever had seen.  But the roar—the awful, deafening roar of those tumbling waters penned in the rocky, subterranean vault! Had the fall not entirely blocked my further passage and shown me that I had followed the wrong course I believe that I should have fled anyway before the maddening tumult.  Thurid and the therns could not have come this way. By stumbling upon the wrong course I had lost the trail, and they had gained so much ahead of me that now I might not be able to find them before it was too late, if, in fact, I could find them at all.  It had taken several hours to force my way up to the falls against the strong current, and other hours would be required for the descent, although the pace would be much swifter.  With a sigh I turned the prow of my craft down stream, and with mighty strokes hastened with reckless speed through the dark and tortuous channel until once again I came to the chamber into which flowed the three branches of the river.  Two unexplored channels still remained from which to choose; nor was there any means by which I could judge which was the more likely to lead me to the plotters.  Never in my life, that I can recall, have I suffered such an agony of indecision. So much depended upon a correct choice; so much depended upon haste.  The hours that I had already lost might seal the fate of the incomparable Dejah Thoris were she not already dead—to sacrifice other hours, and maybe days in a fruitless exploration of another blind lead would unquestionably prove fatal.  Several times I essayed the right-hand entrance only to turn back as though warned by some strange intuitive sense that this was not the way. At last, convinced by the oft-recurring phenomenon, I cast my all upon the left-hand archway; yet it was with a lingering doubt that I turned a parting look at the sullen waters which rolled, dark and forbidding, from beneath the grim, low archway on the right.  And as I looked there came bobbing out upon the current from the Stygian darkness of the interior the shell of one of the great, succulent fruits of the sorapus tree.  I could scarce restrain a shout of elation as this silent, insensate messenger floated past me, on toward the Iss and Korus, for it told me that journeying Martians were above me on that very stream.  They had eaten of this marvelous fruit which nature concentrates within the hard shell of the sorapus nut, and having eaten had cast the husk overboard. It could have come from no others than the party I sought.  Quickly I abandoned all thought of the left-hand passage, and a moment later had turned into the right. The stream soon widened, and recurring areas of phosphorescent rock lighted my way.  I made good time, but was convinced that I was nearly a day behind those I was tracking. Neither Woola nor I had eaten since the previous day, but in so far as he was concerned it mattered but little, since practically all the animals of the dead sea bottoms of Mars are able to go for incredible periods without nourishment.  Nor did I suffer. The water of the river was sweet and cold, for it was unpolluted by decaying bodies—like the Iss—and as for food, why the mere thought that I was nearing my beloved princess raised me above every material want.  As I proceeded, the river became narrower and the current swift and turbulent—so swift in fact that it was with difficulty that I forced my craft upward at all. I could not have been making to exceed a hundred yards an hour when, at a bend, I was confronted by a series of rapids through which the river foamed and boiled at a terrific rate.  My heart sank within me. The sorapus nutshell had proved a false prophet, and, after all, my intuition had been correct—it was the left-hand channel that I should have followed.  Had I been a woman I should have wept. At my right was a great, slow-moving eddy that circled far beneath the cliff’s overhanging side, and to rest my tired muscles before turning back I let my boat drift into its embrace.  I was almost prostrated by disappointment. It would mean another half-day’s loss of time to retrace my way and take the only passage that yet remained unexplored. What hellish fate had led me to select from three possible avenues the two that were wrong?  As the lazy current of the eddy carried me slowly about the periphery of the watery circle my boat twice touched the rocky side of the river in the dark recess beneath the cliff. A third time it struck, gently as it had before, but the contact resulted in a different sound—the sound of wood scraping upon wood.  In an instant I was on the alert, for there could be no wood within that buried river that had not been man brought. Almost coincidentally with my first apprehension of the noise, my hand shot out across the boat’s side, and a second later I felt my fingers gripping the gunwale of another craft.  As though turned to stone I sat in tense and rigid silence, straining my eyes into the utter darkness before me in an effort to discover if the boat were occupied.  It was entirely possible that there might be men on board it who were still ignorant of my presence, for the boat was scraping gently against the rocks upon one side, so that the gentle touch of my boat upon the other easily could have gone unnoticed.  Peer as I would I could not penetrate the darkness, and then I listened intently for the sound of breathing near me; but except for the noise of the rapids, the soft scraping of the boats, and the lapping of the water at their sides I could distinguish no sound. As usual, I thought rapidly.

All is hot and fierce and passionate, ardent and unashamed in its exulting and importunate desire for life and love. And, do you know that the scarlet lilies are woven petal by petal from my heart's blood, these little quivering birds are my soul made incarnate music, these heavy perfumes are my emotions dissolved into aerial essence, this flaming blue and gold sky is the 'very me,' that part of me that incessantly and insolently, yes, and a little deliberately, triumphs over that other part--a thing of nerves and tissues that suffers and cries out, and that must die to-morrow perhaps, or twenty years hence.\"  Then there was her humour, which was part of her strange wisdom, and was always awake and on the watch.  In all her letters, written in exquisite English prose, but with an ardent imagery and a vehement sincerity of emotion which make them, like the poems, indeed almost more directly, un-English, Oriental, there was always this intellectual, critical sense of humour, which could laugh at one's own enthusiasm as frankly as that enthusiasm had been set down.  And partly the humour, like the delicate reserve of her manner, was a mask or a shelter.  \"I have taught myself,\" she writes to me from India, \"to be commonplace and like everybody else superficially.  Every one thinks I am so nice and cheerful, so 'brave,' all the banal things that are so comfortable to be.  My mother knows me only as 'such a tranquil child, but so strong-willed.'  A tranquil child!\" And she writes again, with deeper significance: \"I too have learnt the subtle philosophy of living from moment to moment.  Yes, it is a subtle philosophy, though it appears merely an epicurean doctrine: 'Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we die.'  I have gone through so many yesterdays when I strove with Death that I have realised to its full the wisdom of that sentence; and it is to me not merely a figure of speech, but a literal fact.  Any to-morrow I might die.  It is scarcely two months since I came back from the grave:  is it worth while to be anything but radiantly glad? Of all things that life or perhaps my temperament has given me I prize the gift of laughter as beyond price.\"  Her desire, always, was to be \"a wild free thing of the air like the birds, with a song in my heart.\"  A spirit of too much fire in too frail a body, it was rarely that her desire was fully granted.  But in Italy she found what she could not find in England, and from Italy her letters are radiant.  \"This Italy is made of gold,\" she writes from Florence, \"the gold of dawn and daylight, the gold of the stars, and, now dancing in weird enchanting rhythms through this magic month of May, the gold of fireflies in the perfumed darkness--'aerial gold.'  I long to catch the subtle music of their fairy dances and make a poem with a rhythm like the quick irregular wild flash of their sudden movements.  Would it not be wonderful?  One black night I stood in a garden with fireflies in my hair like darting restless stars caught in a mesh of darkness.  It gave me a strange sensation, as if I were not human at all, but an elfin spirit.  I wonder why these little things move me so deeply?  It is because I have a most 'unbalanced intellect,' I suppose.\"  Then, looking out on Florence, she cries, \"God! how beautiful it is, and how glad I am that I am alive to-day!\"  And she tells me that she is drinking in the beauty like wine, \"wine, golden and scented, and shining, fit for the gods; and the gods have drunk it, the dead gods of Etruria, two thousand years ago.  Did I say dead?  No, for the gods are immortal, and one might still find them loitering in some solitary dell on the grey hillsides of Fiesole.  Have I seen them?  Yes, looking with dreaming eyes, I have found them sitting under the olives, in their grave, strong, antique beauty--Etruscan gods!\"  In Italy she watches the faces of the monks, and at one moment longs to attain to their peace by renunciation, longs for Nirvana; \"then, when one comes out again into the hot sunshine that warms one's blood, and sees the eager hurrying faces of men and women in the street, dramatic faces over which the disturbing experiences of life have passed and left their symbols, one's heart thrills up into one's throat.  No, no, no, a thousand times no! how can one deliberately renounce this coloured, unquiet, fiery human life of the earth?\"  And, all the time, her subtle criticism is alert, and this woman of the East marvels at the women of the West, \"the beautiful worldly women of the West,\" whom she sees walking in the Cascine, \"taking the air so consciously attractive in their brilliant toilettes, in the brilliant coquetry of their manner!\"  She finds them \"a little incomprehensible,\" \"profound artists in all the subtle intricacies of fascination,\" and asks if these \"incalculable frivolities and vanities and coquetries and caprices\" are, to us, an essential part of their charm?  And she watches them with amusement as they flutter about her, petting her as if she were a nice child, a child or a toy, not dreaming that she is saying to herself sorrowfully:  \"How utterly empty their lives must be of all spiritual beauty IF they are nothing more than they appear to be.\"  She sat in our midst, and judged us, and few knew what was passing behind that face \"like an awakening soul,\" to use one of her own epithets.  Her eyes were like deep pools, and you seemed to fall through them into depths below depths.  ARTHUR SYMONS.    FOLK SONGS    PALANQUIN BEARERS    Lightly, O lightly we bear her along,   She sways like a flower in the wind of our song;   She skims like a bird on the foam of a stream,   She floats like a laugh from the lips of a dream.   Gaily, O gaily we glide and we sing,   We bear her along like a pearl on a string.    Softly, O softly we bear her along,   She hangs like a star in the dew of our song;   She springs like a beam on the brow of the tide,   She falls like a tear from the eyes of a bride.   Lightly, O lightly we glide and we sing,   We bear her along like a pearl on a string.    WANDERING SINGERS    (Written to one of their Tunes)    Where the voice of the wind calls our wandering feet,   Through echoing forest and echoing street,   With lutes in our hands ever-singing we roam,   All men are our kindred, the world is our home.    Our lays are of cities whose lustre is shed,   The laughter and beauty of women long dead;   The sword of old battles, the crown of old kings,   And happy and simple and sorrowful things.    What hope shall we gather, what dreams shall we sow?   Where the wind calls our wandering footsteps we go.   No love bids us tarry, no joy bids us wait:   The voice of the wind is the voice of our fate.    INDIAN WEAVERS    Weavers, weaving at break of day,   Why do you weave a garment so gay? . . .   Blue as the wing of a halcyon wild,   We weave the robes of a new-born child.    Weavers, weaving at fall of night,   Why do you weave a garment so bright? . . .   Like the plumes of a peacock, purple and green,   We weave the marriage-veils of a queen.    Weavers, weaving solemn and still,   What do you weave in the moonlight chill? . . .   White as a feather and white as a cloud,   We weave a dead man's funeral shroud.    COROMANDEL FISHERS    Rise, brothers, rise, the wakening skies pray        to the morning light,   The wind lies asleep in the arms of the dawn        like a child that has cried all night.   Come, let us gather our nets from the shore,        and set our catamarans free,   To capture the leaping wealth of the tide, for        we are the sons of the sea.    No longer delay, let us hasten away in the        track of the sea-gull's call,   The sea is our mother, the cloud is our brother,        the waves are our comrades all.   What though we toss at the fall of the sun        where the hand of the sea-god drives?   He who holds the storm by the hair, will hide        in his breast our lives.    Sweet is the shade of the cocoanut glade, and        the scent of the mango grove,   And sweet are the sands at the full o' the        moon with the sound of the voices we love.   But sweeter, O brothers, the kiss of the spray        and the dance of the wild foam's glee:   Row, brothers, row to the blue of the verge,        where the low sky mates with the sea.    THE SNAKE-CHARMER    Whither dost thou hide from the magic of my flute-call?   In what moonlight-tangled meshes of perfume,   Where the clustering keovas guard the squirrel's slumber,   Where the deep woods glimmer with the jasmine's bloom?    I'll feed thee, O beloved, on milk and wild red honey,   I'll bear thee in a basket of rushes, green and white,   To a palace-bower where golden-vested maidens   Thread with mellow laughter the petals of delight.    Whither dost thou loiter, by what murmuring hollows,   Where oleanders scatter their ambrosial fire?   Come, thou subtle bride of my mellifluous wooing,   Come, thou silver-breasted moonbeam of desire!    CORN-GRINDERS    O LITTLE MOUSE, WHY DOST THOU CRY   WHILE MERRY STARS LAUGH IN THE SKY?    Alas! alas! my lord is dead!   Ah, who will ease my bitter pain?   He went to seek a millet-grain   In the rich farmer's granary shed;   They caught him in a baited snare,   And slew my lover unaware:   Alas! alas! my lord is dead.    O LITTLE DEER, WHY DOST THOU MOAN,   HID IN THY FOREST-BOWER ALONE?    Alas! alas! my lord is dead!   Ah! who will quiet my lament?    At fall of eventide he went   To drink beside the river-head;   A waiting hunter threw his dart,   And struck my lover through the heart.   Alas! alas! my lord is dead.    O LITTLE BRIDE, WHY DOST THOU WEEP   WITH ALL THE HAPPY WORLD ASLEEP?    Alas! alas! my lord is dead!   Ah, who will stay these hungry tears,   Or still the want of famished years,   And crown with love my marriage-bed?   My soul burns with the quenchless fire   That lit my lover's funeral pyre:"]]]
