In all Kuni's sorrowful life she had scarcely experienced any grief so bitter.  When she closed the little eyes which had gazed into her pale face so often and so tenderly, it seemed as if the sun, moon, and stars had lost their light, and henceforth she was condemned to live in dreary gloom.  What terrible days had followed the child's death!  Cyriax raved as if he had really been seized with the lunacy whose pretence helped him to beg his bread.  Besides, he gave himself up to unbridled indulgence in brandy, and, when drunk, he was capable of the most brutal acts.  The dead Juli's mother, who, spite of an evil youth and a lenient conscience, was by no means one of the worst of women, had to endure the harshest treatment from her profligate companion.  The blow which had fallen upon him filled him with savage rage, and he longed to inflict some pain upon all who came in his way that they, too, might feel what it was to suffer.  The death of his \"sweet little Juli\" appeared to have hardened the last tender spot in his brutal soul.  Kuni was the only person toward whom at first he imposed some restraint upon himself.  True, without any consideration for the girl's presence, he sometimes asked Gitta why they still burdened themselves with the useless hobbler and did not sell the cart and the donkey.  But though there was no lack of good offers for the excellent Spanish beast of burden, he allowed matters to remain as before.  If the rage seething in his heart led him, in his drunken frenzy, to make Kuni feel its effects, too, the pleading glance of the blue eyes, still large and expressive, with which she had so often hushed the wailing child, sufficed to soothe him.  Yesterday, for the first time, he had seriously threatened to drive the ropedancer away, and she knew that Cyriax was capable of anything.  True, his wife was attached to Kuni, but she had little influence over her vicious husband.  So the sick cripple might only too easily find herself left on the highway.  Still, she had given Cyriax cause for the threat.  All day and during the night she had been busy with the unfortunate mother and her twins, and therefore had frequently neglected to fill his brandy bottle.  But this could not be helped, and she was not accustomed to think of the future.  Whatever her heart urged she did, no matter what might happen. If Cyriax left her in the lurch, she must beg or starve unless chance, which so often mingled in her existence, willed otherwise.  With the child's life the modest happiness which Kuni had enjoyed during the last few months had vanished, not only because the tongueless blasphemer had become a different person, and she sorely missed the delicate little creature who had filled and cheered her heart, but she had also lost the peace of mind which she enjoyed during the existence of her charge.  The young Augsburg maiden, whom she thought she had bought out of the flames of purgatory, did not appear to her again, but the vagrant's child came all the more frequently, and whenever she showed herself she wailed and wept bitterly.  Sweet little Juli's soul must now--whether it had been Juliane's or not--endure the tortures of purgatory, and this pierced Kuni's heart the more deeply the more affectionately she remembered the sickly-child.  Ever since she had used a black plaster, given to her at Singen by a quack, the stump of her foot had become sore again, and sharp pain tortured her so cruelly that, especially when the cough racked her emaciated body and she was jolted to and fro in the springless cart over stony roads, she was afraid that she should lose her reason.  At Pforzheim a barber had examined the wound and, shaking his head, pronounced the black plaster a malignant blood poisoner, and when she refused to have the leg amputated, applied a yellow one, which proved no better.  When Cyriax counted up his receipts in the evening, called to red-haired Gitta his favourite maxim, \"Fools never die,\" and handed to her--Kuni--the larger brandy bottle to fill, she had often summoned up her courage and begged him to buy an indulgence for his sweet little Juli.  The result was certain--she knew it from her own experience.  Shortly after the child's death he had thrust his hand into his purse more than once at such an appeal and given money for a few candles, but it had not been possible to persuade him to purchase the paper.  This refusal was by no means due to mere parsimony.  Kuni knew what induced him to maintain his resistance so obstinately, for in her presence he had told pock-marked Ratz that he would not take the indulgence gratis.  Wherever he might be, his family ought to go, and he did not wish to be anywhere that he would not find Juli.  He did not doubt the continued life of the soul after death, but precisely because he was sure that the gates of paradise would remain closed to him throughout eternity he would not help to open them for the dead child.  When his imagination tortured him with fancies that mice and beetles were leaping and running out of his pockets and the breast of his doublet, he thought that his end was drawing near.  If the devil then had power over his soul, his imps might drag him wherever they pleased, if only he might see little Juli there and hear her call \"Baba\" and \"Father.\"  It would  lessen  the tortures  of hell, however severe they might be.  Was it possible for him to conceive of any greater folly than to rob himself of this consolation by transporting the child, through the indulgence, to the kingdom of heaven, where he could never see her again. He had accumulated a goodly sum by begging, it is true, but, strangely enough, he did not think of purchasing salvation for himself in order to meet his child again in heaven, instead of amid the flames of purgatory. Though he had become as rich as the Fuggers, paradise, he knew, would still be closed to him.  He was not fit for it.  He hated everybody who was rich and respectable.  He would rather be with his child in the mire of hell than to go with her to a magnificent garden of paradise where swearing was forbidden, where there was no brandy and no highroad, and which offered only pleasures which were none to him.  So Kuni was forced to see the child remain in the fires of purgatory, which hurt her little less than her aching limb.  At her entrance into The Blue Pike pain and mental suffering had driven her to the verge of despair.  But the day which began so sorrowfully was followed by an evening of delight--she owed to it her new meeting with Lienhard.  From childhood she had been homeless, and every quarter of the globe to which a highroad led was her native land.  Yet in Spain and during the journey back she had felt a gnawing longing for Germany, nay, nothing had troubled her more than the thought of dying and being buried outside of its frontier.  Her mother, a native of the Rhine country, had given her birth during the fair at Cologne on the Spree; but, whenever homesickness assailed her, it was always the steeples of St. Sebald and St. Ulrich which beckoned to her, and she had longed for the Frank country, the Main, or the richly wooded banks of the Pegnitz.  Was this because, in Nuremberg, for the only time in her life, she had been a member of a decorous household, or had the love which, wherever Cyriax's cart and donkey carried her, always drew her heart back to the same ancient city, made it so dear to her?  Probably the latter, for yesterday she had yearned ardently to reach Nuremberg; but since she had seen Lienhard again, she rejoiced that she was in Miltenberg and at The Blue Pike.  Never had he seemed to her so handsome, so manly.  Besides, he had spoken to her, listened to her reply, and even given her money with lavish generosity.  It was like him!  No one else would have been capable of it.  She could live a long time on his three gold florins, if Cyriax abandoned her; yet the unexpected wealth burned in her hand and perplexed her.  Did Lienhard no longer know that she would not accept money from him?  Had she robbed herself of the certainty that beautified existence; had she failed to show him her superiority to other vagrant girls?  Yet no!  What he gave her was more, far more, than even a prince bestowed upon an ordinary mendicant.  He must measure her by a special standard.  If he had only given her the gold with a kind word, not flung it silently into her lap.  This half destroyed her pleasure in the present, and the ample supply of money clouded her already disturbed peace of mind still more. Had it been possible, she would have returned the gift as she did the alms at Augsburg.  But how was this to be accomplished in the over- crowded inn?  Yet, if she kept the florins, the sacrifice at the convent would lose a large portion of its value, and the good opinion which her act at Augsburg must have inspired might be shadowed.  For some time before leaving the room in the tavern she had turned the coins restlessly over and over under her kerchief, and meanwhile, as if in a dream, made but evasive answers to the questions and demands of Cyriax and Gitta.  Then she glided nearer to the gentlemen at the table, intending to return Lienhard's gift; but the landlord of The Pike followed her suspiciously, and drove her back to her companions.  Thence she had been called to the sick woman and went out of doors.  She found the mother of the twins in the meadow by the Main and eagerly devoted herself to them.  The widow's burning head and gasping breath were no favourable symptoms. She herself felt that her end was approaching.  Her tongue was parched. The water in the jug was warm and flat, yet she longed for a cool drink. During the day Kuni had noticed a well in the kitchen garden, and, in spite of her aching foot, hastened to it at once to draw the cool water. While doing so,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5586"],["title","In the Blue Pike — Volume 03 (#2)"],["body","red and white pinks which she had noticed at noon again caught her eye in the starlight night.  The sick woman could enjoy their fragrance now, and to-morrow, feast her eyes upon their bright colours.  From childhood she had always been fond of flowers.  Stealing was prohibited by her father as wicked and dangerous, and she had never transgressed his commands.  When she picked up the costly rosary in Nuremberg, she had intended to return it to the owner.  But to pluck the flowers and fruit which the Lord caused to grow and ripen for every one was a different thing, and had never troubled her conscience.  So she carelessly gathered a few pinks.  Three should go to the sick woman, but Lienhard Groland would have the largest and finest.  She would try to slip the flowers into his hand, with the money, as a token of her gratitude.  But even while saying to herself that these blossoms should be her last greeting to him, she felt the red spots burning more hotly on her cheeks.  Ah, if only he would accept the pinks!  Then the most cruel things might happen, she could bear them.  While kneeling before the bed, the waiter, Dietel, noticed her.  As she saw him also, she hurried back to the suffering mother as fast as her lame limb would carry her, and raised the jug of fresh water to her parched lips.  This had been a delicious refreshment to the sick woman, and when Kuni saw how much comfort her little service afforded the invalid, her heart grew lighter.  Had it been possible she, who was of no importance to any one, would willingly have lain down on the heap of straw in the place of the mother upon whom two young lives depended.  How delightful it was to bring aid!  And she possessed the means of being helpful.  So, with sparkling eyes, she pressed the three gold coins into the sufferer's burning hand, and told her that the village authorities would rear the twins for such a sum.  Then the parched lips of the fevered woman lauded the merciful kindness bestowed by the lame ropedancer--who at that moment seemed to her as powerful as a queen--so warmly and tenderly that Kuni felt the blood again mount into her cheeks--this time with shame at the praise which she deserved so little, yet which rendered her so happy.  Finally, the sufferer expressed a desire for a priest, that she might not pass from earth without a sacrament.  Her sins oppressed her sorely.  She, and she alone, was to blame for Nickel's being hanged.  Never in all her life had she been a glutton; but before the birth of the twins the devil had tormented her with a strange longing for roast fowl, which she had been unable to repress and keep to herself. Solely for her gratification, Nickel stole the goose and the hens.  In spite of many a bad business in which his reckless nature had involved him, he was a good fellow, with a loving heart.  For her sake he would have tried to steal the ring from the executioner's finger.  Now he had gone into the other world unshriven, with the rope about his neck, for though the benefit of the sacrament was usually granted even to the worst criminals, the peasants strung Nickel up to the nearest tree as soon as they caught him, without heeding his entreaties. This made death even harder for her than the thought of the poor little creatures yonder in the bundle of rags.  Kuni's charity had provided for the orphans, but her Nickel would find no mercy from the heavenly Judge throughout eternity.  She had sobbed aloud as she spoke, and then writhed in such violent convulsions that Kuni with difficulty prevented her from throwing herself out of the hot straw in the cart upon the damp meadow.  When she grew somewhat calmer, she repeated Nickel's name again and again till it was heartrending to hear her.     CHAPTER IX.  As soon as the sufferer's condition would permit, Kuni left her, went to the window of the taproom in The Blue Pike, and surveyed its inmates.  Most of them were already asleep on heaps of straw, which were raised at the head by chairs turned upside down.  The richer guests had gone to the bedrooms, which, however, they were obliged to share with several others. Some of the strollers were lying on the floor with their knapsacks under their heads.  A few of the musicians were still lingering over the wine which the travelling merchants and artisans had ordered for them.  Others had gone with some of the vagrants into the little wood beyond the meadow, where they danced, fiddled, and sang.  Their loud shouts were borne by the cool night breeze to the sufferer in the cart.  The gentlemen from Cologne, without troubling themselves about the boisterous merriment of the burghers or the transformation of the room into a sleeping apartment, were still sitting at the table talking together eagerly.  The dealer in the indulgences, too, had not yet gone to rest.  A tall, broad-shouldered sergeant belonging to the escort had just purchased-- for the larger part of the zecchins won as his share of the booty in the Italian war--the indulgence which he thought would secure him from the tortures of the fire of purgatory.  Before opening the door, he struck his broad breast as though relieved of a heavy burden.  The ropedancer looked after him thoughtfully.  The paper had now lightened the sergeant's heart as it had formerly done her own.  Would she not have been wiser to give her money for the redemption of Nickel's lost soul than for the orphans, whom the charity of the people would perhaps have succoured without her?  Probably, too, it would have afforded still greater consolation to the poor dying woman, whom nothing troubled so sorely as her guilt for the doom of her unfortunate husband.  Yet, even thus she had succeeded in making the dying mother's departure easier, and what she had commenced she intended to complete at once.  With a tender smile that lent strange beauty to her pallid, grief-worn face she continued her survey.  She had previously noticed an old priest, whose countenance bore the impress of genuine kindness of heart.  She soon found him again among the travellers sleeping on the straw; but the old man's slumber was so sound that she felt reluctant to wake him.  Among the Dominicans from Cologne, most of whom were also asleep, there were none she would have trusted, nay, she even thought that one was the very person who, shortly before her fall from the rope, had pursued her with persistent importunity. But the Abbot of St. AEgidius in Nuremberg, who had dined with the ambassadors from his native city, was also a man of benevolent, winning expression.  His cheeks were flushed, either by the heat or the wine which he had drunk, but there was a look of attractive kindness upon his well-formed features.  When he went through the room a short time before, Kuni had seen him pass his hand caressingly over the fair hair of the pretty little son of a potter's wife from Reren on the Rhine, whose cart was standing outside in the meadow by the Main.  He was scarcely of the same mind as the gentleman from Cologne, for he had just waved his plump hand in protest.  Perhaps she might even do him a favour by summoning him.  But dared she, a poor vagabond, disturb so distinguished a gentleman at his wine?  Yet there was danger in delay.  So she resolved to ask the assistance of the landlady of The Pike, coughed with her handkerchief pressed over her lips, in order not to disturb the sleepers, and turned to leave the room.  But Gitta had just been to see the sick mother, and told Cyriax that Kuni, silly, softhearted thing, had wasted her gold coins on the dying woman.  The blasphemer flew into a great rage, muttered a few words to pock- marked Ratz, and then staggered toward their lame travelling companion to bar her passage across the threshold, and ask, in angry, guttural tones, how much of the Groland gold she had flung into the dying woman's grave.  \"Is it any business of yours?\"  was the reply, uttered with difficulty amid her coughing.  \"Mine, mine--is it any business of mine?\" gasped the tongueless man. Then he raised his heavy fist threateningly and stammered jeeringly: \"Not--not a red heller more nor less than my cart--in the name of all the fiends--than my cart is of yours.  Four heller pounds, Ratz, and the donkey and cart are yours.\"  \"Done!\"  cried the vagrant, who already had his money ready; but the tongueless blasphemer chuckled with malicious pleasure:  \"Now you have it, fool!  Whoever doesn't share with me--you know that-- doesn't ride with me.\"  Then he staggered back to Gitta.  The girl watched him silently for a while.  At last she passed her hand quickly across her brow, as if to dispel some unpleasant thought, and shook her burning head, half sadly, half disapprovingly.  She had done a good deed--and this, this--But she had not performed it for the sake of reward, she had only desired to aid the sufferer.  Straightening herself proudly, she limped toward the kitchen.  Here, frequently interrupted by fits of coughing, she told the landlady of The Pike in touching words that the sick mother, whom she had so kindly strengthened with nice broth, desired the sacrament, as her life would soon be over.  The Lord Abbot of St. AEgidius in Nuremberg was still sitting over his wine.  She went no further.  The landlady, who, while Kuni was talking, had wiped her pretty flushed face with her apron, pulled the rolled up white linen sleeves farther down over her plump arms, and gazed with mingled surprise and approval into the girl's emaciated face, interrupted her with the promise to do what she could for the poor woman.  \"If it were any one else,\" she continued, significantly, \"I would not venture to try it.  But the Abbot of St. AEgidius, in his charity, scarcely asks, when help is needed, whence did you come, who are you, or what do you possess?  I know him.  Wait here a little while.  If he condescends to do it, you can take him to the poor creature at once.\"  While speaking she smoothed, with two swift"]]]
