Never had she beheld anything fairer than the bride with the myrtle wreath on her beautifully formed head, whence a delicate lace veil floated over her long, thick, golden hair.  She could not help gazing at her as if spellbound.  When she moved forward, holding her bridegroom's hand, she appeared to float over the rice and flowers strewn in her path to the church--it was in February.  As Kuni saw the bride raise her large blue eyes to her lover's so tenderly and yet so modestly, and the bridegroom thank her with a long joyous look of love, she wondered what must be the feelings of a maiden who, so pure, so full of ardent love, and so fervently beloved in return, was permitted to approach the house of God, accompanied by a thousand pious wishes, with the first and only man whom she loved, and to whom she wished to devote herself for her whole life.  Again, as at that time, a burning thrill ran through her limbs.  Then a bitter smile hovered around her lips.  She had asked herself whether the heart of one who experienced such joys, to whom such a fate was allotted, would not burst from sheer joy.  Now the wish, the hope, and every new resolve for good or ill were alike over.  At that hour, before the door of St. Sebald's, she had been capable of all, all, perhaps even the best things, if any one had cherished her in his heart as Lienhard Groland loved the beautiful woman at his side.  She could not help remembering the spell with which the sight of those two had forced her to watch their every movement, to gaze at them, and them only, as if the world contained nothing else.  How often she had repeated to herself that in that hour she was bewitched, whether by him or by her she could not decide.  As the throng surged forward, she had been crowded against the woman who lost the rosary.  She had not had the faintest thought of it when the bailiff suddenly snatched her from her rapturous gazing to stern reality, seizing with a rude grip the hand that held the jewel.  Then, pursued by the reviling and hissing of the populace, she had been taken to prison.  Now she again saw herself amid the vile rabble assembled there, again felt how eagerly she inhaled the air as she was led across the courtyard of the townhall into the presence of the magistrates.  Oh, if she could but take such a long, deep breath of God's pure air as she did then! But that time was past.  Her poor, sunken chest would no longer permit it.  Then she fancied that she was again standing before the judges, who were called The Five.  Four magistrates sat with the Pfander--[Chief of police]--at the table covered with a green cloth, but one, who surpassed all the others both in stature and in manly beauty, was the selfsame Lienhard Groland, who yesterday had led to the altar the wonderfully lovely girl who had bewitched her.  She felt how the blood had mounted into her cheeks when she again saw him who could know nothing of her except that she was a jade, who had stolen another person's property.  Yet her glance soon met his, and he must have been blind had he not read in the radiant lustre of her blue eyes, which had early learned to woo applause and promise love, what he was to her, and how gratefully her heart throbbed for him.  After the other gentlemen had treated her harshly, and threatened to put her in the stocks, he interceded for her, and entreated his brother magistrates to let mercy, in this instance, take the place of justice, because she was so young, and perhaps had intended to return the rosary later.  Finally he bent smiling toward his companions and said something to them in a subdued tone.  The voice was so low that his intention to keep her in ignorance of it was evident.  But Kuni's hearing had been as keen as a bird's, and not a word escaped her.  He could not help regarding it as an evil omen for him and his young wife if a girl, hitherto unpunished, should be plunged into disgrace and perhaps made miserable throughout the rest of a long life on account of his wedding procession.  How high her heart had throbbed at this request, and when it was granted, the discussion closed, and she herself informed that she would be set free, she hurried after her preserver, who had left the Council chamber with the other magistrates, to thank him.  He permitted her to detain him, and when she found herself alone in his presence, at first, with streaming eyes, she was unable to utter a word.  He laid his hand kindly on her shoulder to soothe her, and then listened to her assurance that, though she was a strolling rope-dancer, she had never taken other people's property.  Now she closed her eyes to have a clearer vision of the picture evoked by memory, which rose so vividly before her.  Again she saw herself seize his hand to kiss it humbly, yet with fervent devotion; again she met the patronizing but friendly smile with which he withdrew it, and a thrill of happiness ran through every nerve, for she imagined she once more felt his slender white hand soothingly stroke her black hair and burning cheeks, as if she were a sick child who needed help.  Later years had never granted her aught more blissful than that moment.  As had often happened before, the memory of it overmastered her with such power that she could not escape it, but recalled his every look and movement.  Meanwhile, she imagined that she heard his voice, whose deep, pure tones had pleased her ear, alive to harmony, more than any to which she had ever listened, counselling her to give up her vagrant life, and again received his assurance that he pitied her, and it would grieve him if she, who seemed worthy of a better fate, should be ruined, body and soul, so young.  Thus absorbed, she neither saw nor listened to anything that was occurring near her or in the large room of the tavern, but stood gazing into vacancy as if rapt away from earth.  True, Cyriax and the others had lowered their voices, for they were talking about her and the aristocratic couple on whose wedding day Kuni had stolen the rosary.  Raban, a tall, lank vagabond with red-rimmed eyes, whose ugly face bristled with a half-grown black beard, had a few more particulars to give concerning the bride and bridegroom.  He wandered about the world and, whenever he stretched out his hand to beg, gave the pretext that he was collecting the price of blood required for a man whom he had killed in self-defence, that his own head might not fall under the axe of the executioner.  His dead father had heated the furnaces in the smelting works at Eschenbach, near Nuremberg, and the bride was Katharina, the eldest of the three daughters of the owner, old Harsdorffer of the Council.  He had been a man of steel and iron, and opposed Lienhard Groland's father at every point, not excepting even their official business.  When he discovered that the young man was carrying on a love affair with his daughter, he had summoned him before a court of justice for a breach of the law which forbade minors to betroth themselves without parental consent.  The magistrates sentenced Lienhard to five years' exile from the city but, through the Emperor's mediation, he was spared the punishment.  Old Harsdorffer afterward succeeded in keeping the suitor away from his daughter a long time, but finally relinquished his opposition.  \"The devil came soon enough and broke his stiff neck,\" added Cyriax, on whom the vagabond's story had had the same effect as a red rag upon a bull.  Spite of the old slanderer's mutilated tongue, invectives flowed fast enough from his lips when he thought of young Frau Groland's father. If the Groland outside resembled his father-in-law, he would like to drink him a pledge that should burn like the plague and ruin.  He snatched a flask from his pocket as he spoke, and after a long pull and a still longer \"A-ah!\" he stammered:  \"I've been obliged to bid farewell to my tongue, yet it feels as if it were sticking in my throat like the dry sole of a shoe.  That's what comes from talking in this dog-day heat.\"  He looked into the empty bottle and was about to send Kuni out to fill it again.  In turning to do so he saw her pale face, wan with suffering, but which now glowed with a happy light that lent it a strange beauty.  How large her blue eyes were!  When he had picked her up in Spain she was already a cripple and in sore distress.  But Groland probably knew what he was about when he released her.  She must have been a pretty creature enough at that time, and he knew that before her fall she was considered one of the most skilful rope-dancers.  An elderly woman with a boy, whose blindness helped her to arouse compassion, was crouching by Raban's side, and had just been greeted by Kuni as an old acquaintance.  They had journeyed from land to land in Loni's famous troupe, and as Raban handed Cyriax his own bottle, he turned from the dreaming girl, whose services he no longer needed, and whispered to the blind boy's mother--who among the people of her own calling still went by the name of Dancing Gundel--the question whether yonder ailing cripple had once had any good looks, and what position she had held among rope-dancers.  The little gray-haired woman looked up with sparkling eyes.  Under the name of \"Phyllis\" she had earned, ere her limbs were stiffened by age, great applause by her dainty egg-dance and all sorts of feats with the balancing pole.  The manager of the band had finally given her the position of crier to support herself and her blind boy.  This had made her voice so hollow and hoarse that it was difficult to understand her as, with fervid eloquence, vainly striving to be heard by absent-minded Kuni, she began: \"She surpassed even Maravella the Spaniard.  And her feats at Augsburg during the Reichstag--I tell you, Cyriax, when she ascended the rope to the belfry, with the pole and without--\"  \"I've just"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5587"],["title","In the Blue Pike â€” Complete (#2)"],["body","of that from another quarter,\" he interrupted.  \"What I want to know is whether she pleased the eyes of men.\"  \"What's that to you?\" interposed  red-haired Gitta jealously, trying to draw him away from Gundel by the chain.  Raban laughed heartily, and lame Jungel, chuckling, rapped on the floor with his right crutch, exclaiming:  \"Good for you!\"  Kuni was accustomed to such outbursts of merriment.  They were almost always awakened by some trifle, and this time she did not even hear the laughing.  But Cyriax struck his wife so rudely on the hand that she jerked furiously at the chain and, with a muttered oath, blew on the bruised spot.  Meanwhile Gundel was telling the group how many distinguished gentlemen had formerly paid court to Kuni.  She was as agile as a squirrel.  Her pretty little face, with its sparkling blue eyes, attracted the men as bacon draws mice.  Then, pleased to have listeners, she related how the girl had lured florins and zecchins from the purse of many a wealthy ecclesiastic.  She might have been as rich as the Fuggers if she hadn't met with the accident and had understood how to keep what she earned.  But she could not hold on to her gold.  She had flung it away like useless rubbish.  So long as she possessed anything there had been no want in Loni's company.  She, Gundel, had caught her arm more than once when she was going to fling Hungarian ducats, instead of coppers, to good-for-nothing beggars.  She had often urged her, too, to think of old age, but Kuni--never cared for any one longer than a few weeks, though there were some whom she might easily have induced to offer her the wedding ring.  She glanced at Kuni again, but, perceiving that the girl did not yet vouchsafe her even a single look, she was vexed, and, moving nearer to Cyriax, she added in a still lower tone:  \"A more inconstant, faithless, colder heart than hers I never met, even among the most disorderly of Loni's band; for, blindly as the infatuated lovers obeyed every one of her crazy whims, she laughed at the best and truest.  'I hate them all,' she would say.  'I wouldn't let one of them even touch me with the tip of his finger if I could not use their zecchins.  'With these,' she said,  'she would help the rich to restore to the poor what they had stolen from them.' She really treated many a worthy gentleman like a dog, nay, a great deal worse; for she was tender enough to all the animals that travelled with the company; the poodles and the ponies, nay, even the parrots and the doves.  She would play with the children, too, even the smallest ones--isn't that so, Peperle?--like their own silly mothers.\"  She smoothed the blind boy's golden hair as she spoke, then added, sighing:  \"But the little fellow was too young to remember it.  The rattle which she gave him at Augsburg--it was just before the accident--because she was so fond of him--Saint Kunigunde, how could we keep such worthless jewels in our sore need?--was made of pure silver.  True, the simpletons who were so madly in love with her, and with whom she played so cruelly, would have believed her capable of anything sooner than such kindness. There was a Swabian knight, a young fellow----\"  Here she stopped, for Cyriax and the other vagabonds, even the girl of whom she was speaking, had started up and were gazing at the door.  Kuni opened her eyes as wide as if a miracle had happened, and the crimson spots on her sunken cheeks betrayed how deeply she was agitated. But she had never experienced anything of this kind; for while thinking of the time when, through Lienhard Groland's intercession, she had entered the house of the wealthy old Frau Schurstab, in order to become estranged from a vagabond life, and recalling how once, when he saw her sorrowful there, he had spoken kindly to her, it seemed as if she had actually heard his own voice.  As it still appeared to echo in her ears, she suddenly became aware that the words really did proceed from his lips.  What she had heard in her dream and what now came from his own mouth, as he stood at the door, blended into one.  She would never have believed that the power of imagination could reproduce anything so faithfully.  Listening intently, she said to herself that, during the many thousand times when she had talked with him in fancy, it had also seemed as if she heard him speak.  And the same experience had befallen her eyes; for whenever memory reverted to those distant days, she had beheld him just as he now looked standing on the threshold, where he was detained by the landlady of The Pike.  Only his face had become still more manly, his bearing more dignified.  The pleasant, winning expression of the bearded lips remained unchanged, and more than once she had seen his eyes sparkle with a far warmer light than now, while he was thanking the portly woman for her cordial welcome.  While Kuni's gaze still rested upon him as if spellbound, Cyriax nudged her, stammering hurriedly:  \"They will have to pass us.  Move forward, women, in front of me.  Spread out your skirt, you Redhead!  It might be my death if yonder Nuremberg fine gentleman should see me here and recollect one thing and another.\"  As he spoke he dragged Kuni roughly from the window, flung the sack which he had brought in from the cart down before him, and made them sit on it, while he stretched himself on the floor face downward, and pretended to be asleep behind the women.  This suited Kuni.  If Lienhard Groland passed her now he could not help seeing her, and she had no greater desire than to meet his glance once more before her life ended.  Yet she dreaded this meeting with an intensity plainly revealed by the passionate throbbing of her heart and the panting of her weakened lungs.  There was a rushing noise in her ears, and her eyes grew dim.  Yet she was obliged to keep them wide open- -what might not the next moment bring?  For the first time since her entrance she gazed around the large, long apartment, which would have deserved the name of hall had it not been too low.  The heated room, filled with buzzing flies, was crowded with travellers. The wife and daughter of a feather-curler, who were on their way with the husband and father to the Reichstag, where many an aristocratic gentleman would need plumes for his own head and his wife's, had just dropped the comb with which they were arranging each other's hair.  The shoemaker and his dame from Nuremberg paused in the sensible lecture they were alternately addressing to their apprentices.  The Frankfort messenger put down the needle with which he was mending the badgerskin in his knapsack. The travelling musicians who, to save a few pennies, had begun to eat bread, cheese, and radishes, instead of the warm meals provided for the others, let their knives drop and set down the wine-jugs.  The traders, who were hotly arguing over Italian politics and the future war with Turkey, were silent.  The four monks, who had leaned their heads against the cornice of the wide, closed fireplace and, in spite of the flies which buzzed around them, had fallen asleep, awoke.  The vender of indulgences in the black cowl interrupted the impressive speech which he was delivering to the people who surrounded his coffer.  This group also --soldiers, travelling artisans, peasants, and tradesfolk with their wives, who, like most of those present, were waiting for the vessel which was to sail down the Main early the next morning--gazed toward the door. Only the students and Bacchantes,--[Travelling scholars]--who were fairly hanging on the lips of a short, slender scholar, with keen, intellectual features, noticed neither the draught of air caused by the entrance of the distinguished arrivals and their followers, nor the general stir aroused by their appearance, until Dr. Eberbach, the insignificant, vivacious speaker, recognised in one of the group the famous Nuremberg humanist, Wilibald Pirckheimer.     CHAPTER II.  At first Dietel, the old waiter, whose bullet-shaped head was covered with thick gray hair, also failed to notice them.  Without heeding their entrance, he continued,--aided by two assistants who were scarcely beyond boyhood,--to set the large and small pine tables which he had placed wherever he could find room.  The patched tablecloths which he spread over the tops were coarse and much worn; the dishes carried after him by the two assistants, whose knees bent under the burden, were made of tin, and marred by many a dent. He swung his stout body to and fro with jerks like a grasshopper, and in doing so his shirt rose above his belt, but the white napkin under his arm did not move a finger's width.  In small things, as well as great ones, Dietel was very methodical.  So he continued his occupation undisturbed till an inexperienced merchant's clerk from Ulm, who wanted to ride farther speedily, accosted him and asked for some special dish. Dietel drew his belt farther down and promptly snubbed the young man with the angry retort; \"Everybody must wait for his meal.  We make no exceptions here.\"  Interrupted in his work, he also saw the newcomers, and then cast a peevish glance at one corner of the room, where stood a table covered with fine linen and set with silver dishes, among them a platter on which early pears and juicy plums were spread invitingly.  The landlady of The Pike had arranged them daintily upon fresh vine leaves an hour before with her own plump but nimble hands.  Of course they were intended for the gentlemen from Nuremberg and their guests.  Dietel, too, now knew them, and saw that the party numbered a person no less distinguished than the far-famed and highly learned Doctor and Imperial Councillor, Conrad Peutinger.  They were riding to Cologne together under the same escort. The citizens of Nuremberg were distinguished men, as well as their guest, but Dietel had served distinguished personages by the dozen at The Blue Pike for many years--among them even crowned heads--and they"]]]
