He tried to laugh, too, but the attempt resulted in such an odd contortion of countenance, as showed that there was no danger of his pluming himself on the kiss.  As for the king, his dignity was greatly hurt, and he did not speak to the page for a whole month.  I may here remark that it was very amusing to see her run, if her mode of progression could properly be called running.  For first she would make a bound; then, having alighted, she would run a few steps, and make another bound.  Sometimes she would fancy she had reached the ground before she actually had, and her feet would go backwards and forwards, running upon nothing at all, like those of a chicken on its back.  Then she would laugh like the very spirit of fun; only in her laugh there was something missing.  What it was, I find myself unable to describe.  I think it was a certain tone, depending upon the possibility of sorrow--MORBIDEZZA, perhaps.  She never smiled.    7.  Try Metaphysics.  After a long avoidance of the painful subject, the king and queen resolved to hold a council of three upon it; and so they sent for the princess.  In she came, sliding and flitting and gliding from one piece of furniture to another, and put herself at last in an armchair, in a sitting posture.  Whether she could be said to sit, seeing she received no support from the seat of the chair, I do not pretend to determine.  \"My dear child,\" said the king, \"you must be aware by this time that you are not exactly like other people.\"  \"Oh, you dear funny papa!  I have got a nose, and two eyes, and all the rest.  So have you.  So has mamma.\"  \"Now be serious, my dear, for once,\" said the queen.  \"No, thank you, mamma; I had rather not.\"  \"Would you not like to be able to walk like other people?\" said the king.  \"No indeed, I should think not.  You only crawl.  You are such slow coaches!\"  \"How do you feel, my child?\" he resumed, after a pause of discomfiture.  \"Quite well, thank you.\"  \"I mean, what do you feel like?\"  \"Like nothing at all, that I know of.\"  \"You must feel like something.\"  \"I feel like a princess with such a funny papa, and such a dear pet of a queen-mamma!\"  \"Now really!\" began the queen; but the princess interrupted her.  \"Oh Yes,\" she added, \"I remember.  I have a curious feeling sometimes, as if I were the only person that had any sense in the whole world.\"  She had been trying to behave herself with dignity; but now she burst into a violent fit of laughter, threw herself backwards over the chair, and went rolling about the floor in an ecstasy of enjoyment.  The king picked her up easier than one does a down quilt, and replaced her in her former relation to the chair.  The exact preposition expressing this relation I do not happen to know.  \"Is there nothing you wish for?\" resumed the king, who had learned by this time that it was useless to be angry with her.  \"Oh, you dear papa!--yes,\" answered she.  \"What is it, my darling?\"  \"I have been longing for it--oh, such a time!--ever since last night.\" \"Tell me what it is.\"  \"Will you promise to let me have it?\"  The king was on the point of saying Yes, but the wiser queen checked him with a single motion of her head.  \"Tell me what it is first,\" said he.  \"No no.  Promise first.\"  \"I dare not.  What is it?\"  \"Mind, I hold you to your promise.--It is--to be tied to the end of a string--a very long string indeed, and be flown like a kite.  Oh, such fun!  I would rain rose-water, and hail sugar-plums, and snow whipped-cream, and--and--and--\"  A fit of laughing checked her; and she would have been off again over the floor, had not the king started up and caught her just in time. Seeing nothing but talk could be got out of her, he rang the bell, and sent her away with two of her ladies-in-waiting.  \"Now, queen,\" he said, turning to her Majesty, \"what IS to be done?\"  \"There is but one thing left,\" answered she.  \"Let us consult the college of Metaphysicians.\"  \"Bravo!\" cried the king; \"we will.\"  Now at the head of this college were two very wise Chinese philosophers-by name Hum-Drum, and Kopy-Keck.  For them the king sent; and straightway they came.  In a long speech he communicated to them what they knew very well already--as who did not?--namely, the peculiar condition of his daughter in relation to the globe on which she dwelt; and requested them to consult together as to what might be the cause and probable cure of her INFIRMITY.  The king laid stress upon the word, but failed to discover his own pun.  The queen laughed; but Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck heard with humility and retired in silence.  The consultation consisted chiefly in propounding and supporting, for the thousandth time, each his favourite theories.  For the condition of the princess afforded delightful scope for the discussion of every question arising from the division of thought-in fact, of all the Metaphysics of the Chinese Empire.  But it is only justice to say that they did not altogether neglect the discussion of the practical question, what was to be done.  Hum-Drum was a Materialist, and Kopy-Keck was a Spiritualist.  The former was slow and sententious; the latter was quick and flighty: the latter had generally the first word; the former the last.  \"I reassert my former assertion,\" began Kopy-Keck, with a plunge. \"There is not a fault in the princess, body or soul; only they are wrong put together.  Listen to me now, Hum-Drum, and I will tell you in brief what I think.  Don't speak.  Don't answer me.  I won't hear you till I have done.--  At that decisive moment, when souls seek their appointed habitations, two eager souls met, struck, rebounded, lost their way, and arrived each at the wrong place.  The soul of the princess was one of those, and she went far astray.  She does not belong by rights to this world at all, but to some other planet, probably Mercury.  Her proclivity to her true sphere destroys all the natural influence which this orb would otherwise possess over her corporeal frame.  She cares for nothing here.  There is no relation between her and this world.  \"She must therefore be taught, by the sternest compulsion, to take an interest in the earth as the earth.  She must study every department of its history--its animal history; its vegetable history; its mineral history; its social history; its moral history; its political history, its scientific history; its literary history; its musical history; its artistical history; above all, its metaphysical history.  She must begin with the Chinese dynasty and end with Japan.  But first of all she must study geology, and especially the history of the extinct races of animals-their natures, their habits, their loves, their hates, their revenges.  She must--\"  \"Hold, h-o-o-old!\" roared Hum-Drum.  \"It is certainly my turn now.  My rooted and insubvertible conviction is, that the causes of the anomalies evident in the princess's condition are strictly and solely physical.  But that is only tantamount to acknowledging that they exist.  Hear my opinion.--  From some cause or other, of no importance to our inquiry, the motion of her heart has been reversed.  That remarkable combination of the suction and the force-pump works the wrong way-I mean in the case of the unfortunate princess: it draws in where it should force out, and forces out where it should draw in.  The offices of the auricles and the ventricles are subverted.  The blood is sent forth by the veins, and returns by the arteries.  Consequently it is running the wrong way through all her corporeal organism--lungs and all.  Is it then at all mysterious, seeing that such is the case, that on the other particular of gravitation as well, she should differ from normal humanity?  My proposal for the cure is this:--  \"Phlebotomize until she is reduced to the last point of safety.  Let it be effected, if necessary, in a warm bath.  When she is reduced to a state of perfect asphyxy, apply a ligature to the left ankle, drawing it as tight as the bone will bear.  Apply, at the same moment, another of equal tension around the right wrist.  By means of plates constructed for the purpose, place the other foot and hand under the receivers of two air-pumps.  Exhaust the receivers.  Exhibit a pint of French brandy, and await the result.\"  \"Which would presently arrive in the form of grim Death,\" said Kopy-Keck.  \"If it should, she would yet die in doing our duty,\" retorted Hum-Drum.  But their Majesties had too much tenderness for their volatile offspring to subject her to either of the schemes of the equally unscrupulous philosophers.  Indeed, the most complete knowledge of the laws of nature would have been unserviceable in her case; for it was impossible to classify her.  She was a fifth imponderable body, sharing all the other properties of the ponderable.    8.  Try a Drop of Water.  Perhaps the best thing for the princess would have been to fall in love.  But how a princess who had no gravity could fall into anything is a difficulty--perhaps THE difficulty.  As for her own feelings on the subject, she did not even know that there was such a beehive of honey and stings to be fallen into.  But now I come to mention another curious fact about her.  The palace was built on the shores of the loveliest lake in the world; and the princess loved this lake more than father or mother.  The root of this preference no doubt, although the princess did not recognise it as such, was, that the moment she got into it, she recovered the natural right of which she had been so wickedly deprived--namely, gravity.  Whether this was owing to the fact that water had been employed as the means of conveying the injury, I do not know.  But it is certain that she could swim and dive like the duck that her old nurse said she was.

It may be that, as Professor Burkitt has suggested, the awful experiences of the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple produced within Pharisaism a moral reformation which drove the Jew within and thus spiritualised Judaism. For undoubtedly the Pharisee of the Gospels is by no means the Pharisee as we meet him in the Jewish books. There was always a latent power and tendency in Judaism towards inward religion; and it may be that this power was intensified, this tendency encouraged, by the loss of Temple and its Sacrificial rites.  But though the Temple had gone the Covenant remained. Not so much in name as in essence. We do not hear much of the Covenant in the Rabbinic books, but its spirit pervades Judaism. Of all the legacy of the past the Covenant was the most inspiring element. Beginning with Abraham, the Covenant established a special relation between God and Abraham's seed. 'I have known him, that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord to do righteousness and judgment' (Gen. xviii. 19). Of this Covenant, the outward sign was the rite of circumcision. Renewed with Moses, and followed in traditional opinion by the Ten Commandments, the Sinaitic Covenant was a further link in the bond between God and His people. Of this Mosaic Covenant the outward sign was the Sabbath. It is of no moment for our present argument whether Abraham and Moses were historical persons or figments of tradition. A Gamaliel would have as little doubted their reality as would a St. Paul. And whatever Criticism may be doing with Abraham, it is coming more and more to see that behind the eighth-century prophets there must have towered the figure of a, if not of the traditional, Moses; behind the prophets a, if not the, Law. Be that as it may, to the Jew of the Christian Era, Abraham and Moses were real and the Covenant unalterable. By the syncretism which has been already described Jeremiah's New Covenant was not regarded as new. Nor was it new; it represented a change of stress, not of contents. When he said (Jer. xxxi. 33), 'This is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it,' Jeremiah, it has been held, was making Christianity possible. But he was also making Judaism possible. Here and nowhere else is to be found the principle which enabled Judaism to survive the loss of Temple and nationality. And the New Covenant was in no sense inconsistent with the Old. For not only does Jeremiah proceed to add in the self-same verse, 'I will be their God, and they will be my people,' but the New Covenant is specifically made with the house of Judah and of Israel, and it is associated with the permanence of the seed of Israel as a separate people and with the Divine rebuilding of Jerusalem. The Jew had no thought of analysing these verses into the words of the true Jeremiah and those of his editors. The point is that over and above, in complementary explanation of, the Abrahamic and Mosaic Covenants with their external signs, over and above the Call of the Patriarch and the Theophany of Sinai, was the Jeremian Covenant written in Israel's heart.  The Covenant conferred a distinction and imposed a duty. It was a bond between a gracious God and a grateful Israel. It dignified history, for it interpreted history in terms of providence and purpose; it transfigured virtue by making virtue service; it was the salt of life, for how could present degradation demoralise, seeing that God was in it, to fulfil His part of the bond, to hold Israel as His jewel, though Rome might despise? The Covenant made the Jew self-confident and arrogant, but these very faults were needed to save him. It was his only defence against the world's scorn. He forgot that the correlative of the Covenant was Isaiah's 'Covenant-People'--missionary to the Gentiles and the World. He relegated his world-mission (which Christianity and Islam in part gloriously fulfilled) to a dim Messianic future, and was content if in his own present he remained faithful to his mission to himself.  Above all, the legacy from the past came to Judaism hallowed and humanised by all the experience of redemption and suffering which had marked Israel's course in ages past, and was to mark his course in ages to come. The Exodus, the Exile, the Maccabean heroism, the Roman catastrophe; Prophet, Wise Man, Priest and Scribe,--all had left their trace. Judaism was a religion based on a book and on a tradition; but it was also a religion based on a unique experience. The book might be misread, the tradition encumbered, but the experience was eternally clear and inspiring. It shone through the Roman Diaspora as it afterwards illuminated the Roman Ghetto, making the present tolerable by the memory of the past and the hope of the future.    CHAPTER II  RELIGION AS LAW   The feature of Judaism which first attracts an outsider's attention, and which claims a front place in this survey, is its 'Nomism' or 'Legalism.' Life was placed under the control of Law. Not only morality, but religion also, was codified. 'Nomism,' it has been truly said, 'has always formed a fundamental trait of Judaism, one of whose chief aims has ever been to mould life in all its varying relations according to the Law, and to make obedience to the commandments a necessity and a custom' (Lauterbach, _Jewish Encyclopedia_, ix. 326). Only the latest development of Judaism is away from this direction. Individualism is nowadays replacing the olden solidarity. Thus, at the Central Conference of American Rabbis, held in July 1906 at Indianapolis, a project to formulate a system of laws for modern use was promptly rejected. The chief modern problem in Jewish life is just this: To what extent, and in what manner, can Judaism still place itself under the reign of Law?  But for many centuries, certainly up to the French Revolution, Religion as Law was the dominant conception in Judaism. Before examining the validity of this conception a word is necessary as to the mode in which it expressed itself. Conduct, social and individual, moral and ritual, was regulated in the minutest details. As the Dayan M. Hyamson has said, the maxim _De minimis non curat lex_ was not applicable to the Jewish Law. This Law was a system of opinion and of practice and of feeling in which the great principles of morality, the deepest concerns of spiritual religion, the genuinely essential requirements of ritual, all found a prominent place. To assert that Pharisaism included the small and excluded the great, that it enforced rules and forgot principles, that it exalted the letter and neglected the spirit, is a palpable libel. Pharisaism was founded on God. On this foundation was erected a structure which embraced the eternal principles of religion. But the system, it must be added, went far beyond this. It held that there was a right and a wrong way of doing things in themselves trivial. Prescription ruled in a stupendous array of matters which other systems deliberately left to the fancy, the judgment, the conscience of the individual. Law seized upon the whole life, both in its inward experiences and outward manifestations. Harnack characterises the system harshly enough. Christianity did not add to Judaism, it subtracted. Expanding a famous epigram of Wellhausen's, Harnack admits that everything taught in the Gospels 'was also to be found in the Prophets, and even in the Jewish tradition of their time. The Pharisees themselves were in possession of it; but, unfortunately, they were in possession of much else besides. With them it was weighted, darkened, distorted, rendered ineffective and deprived of its force by a thousand things which they also held to be religious, and every whit as important as mercy and judgment. They reduced everything into one fabric; the good and holy was only one woof in a broad earthly warp' (_What is Christianity?_ p. 47). It is necessary to qualify this judgment, but it does bring out the all-pervadingness of Law in Judaism. 'And thou shalt speak of them when thou sittest in thine house, when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down and when thou risest up' (Deut. vi. 7). The Word of God was to occupy the Jew's thoughts constantly; in his daily employment and during his manifold activities; when at work and when at rest. And as a correlative, the Law must direct this complex life, the Code must authorise action or forbid it, must turn the thoughts and emotions in one direction and divert them from another.  Nothing in the history of religions can be cited as a complete parallel to this. But incomplete parallels abound. A very large portion of all men's lives is regulated from without: by the Bible and other sacred books; by the institutions and rites of religion; by the law of the land; by the imposed rules of accepted guides, poets, philosophers, physicians; and above all by social conventions, current fashions, and popular maxims. Only in the rarest case is an exceptional man the monstrosity which, we are told, every Israelite was in the epoch of the Judges--a law unto himself.  But in Judaism, until the period of modern reform, this fact of human life was not merely an unconscious truism, it was consciously admitted. And it was realised in a Code.  Or rather in a series of Codes. First came the _Mishnah_, a Code compiled at about the year 200 A.D., but the result of a Pharisaic activity extending over more than two centuries. While Christianity was producing the Gospels and the rest of the New Testament--the work in large part of Jews, or of men born in the circle of Judaism--Judaism in its other manifestation was working at the Code known as the _Mishnah_. This word means 'repetition,' or 'teaching by repetition'; it was an oral tradition reduced"]]]
