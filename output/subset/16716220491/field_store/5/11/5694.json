[3]  The \"day when three suns were seen\"--\"the day of the birth of our Redeemer\"--easily accords with the two days and a night of the continuous light of the Book of Mormon, especially when considered in connection with the appearance of a \"new star\" (the \"meteor\" of the quotation) as a sign to the Nephites of the birth of Messiah.  Referring to the traditions of the primitive Nahua period, after dealing with the events of the first age, which treats of the creation, flood, dispersion of mankind, the migration of a colony of seven families to a new land, etc., Bancroft, following the native writer Ixtilxochiti, deals with the second Nahua age, as follows:      The second age, the \"sun and air,\" terminated with a great     hurricane which swept away trees, rocks, houses and people,     although many men and women escaped, chiefly such as took refuge     in caves which the hurricane could not reach. After several days     the survivors came out to find a multitude of apes living in the     land; and all this time they were in darkness, seeing neither the     sun nor the moon. The next event recorded, although Veytia makes it     precede the hurricane, is the stopping of the sun for a whole day     in his course, as at the command of Joshua as recorded in the Old     Testament, [4]  Let no one confound these cataclysms attended with darkness to the flood period of the first Nahua age--which is identical with Noah's flood; they relate to disasters subsequent to that period; they correspond in time and character to the disasters described in the Book of Mormon as taking place in the western hemisphere during the time of the crucifixion and interment of Messiah in Judea. This, I believe, will be established as reasonably clear as we proceed.  Concerning the foregoing passage, I also call attention to the fact that Veytia is said to place before the tempest and the darkness of the tradition the stopping of the sun for a whole day in his course, as at the command of Joshua. Instead of having reference to the Joshua incident, however, may not the incident of the American tradition have reference to the Book of Mormon sign of Messiah's birth, these two days and a night through which there was continuous light? [5] The apparent \"stopping of the sun a whole day in his course\" would certainly give the period of uninterrupted light required by the Book of Mormon sign of Messiah's birth; and the fact that so noted an authority as Veytia  [6] places that singular event before the fierce tempest attended by darkness, restores the order of the events required by the Book of Mormon account of those matters.  De Roo, quoting Bastian, [7] says:      Another circumstance of the Savior's death seems to be remembered     in Mexico, for it is related in its traditions that, at the     disappearance of Topiltzin or Quetzalcohuatl, [a native culture     hero most nearly resembling, as we shall see, the appearance and     character of Messiah in the western world], both sun and moon were     covered in darkness, while a single star appeared in the heavens.     [8]  Here, clear enough, is allusion to the darkness that covered the land at Messiah's death; may not the star, which here appears out of order, according to Book of Mormon statements, really have been the one which appeared to the Nephites as the sign of Messiah's birth?  II.  _The Signs of Messiah's Death._  The signs which were to be given to the inhabitants of the western hemisphere of Messiah's death were foretold by a Lamanite prophet as follows:      Behold, in that day that he shall suffer death, the sun shall be     darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon,     and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this     land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space     of three days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead;     yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost, there shall be     thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and the     earth shall shake and tremble, and the rocks which are upon the     face of this earth; which are both above the earth and beneath,     which ye know at this time are solid, or the more part of it is     one solid mass, shall be broken up; yea, they shall be rent in     twain, and shall ever after be found in seams and in cracks, and in     broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth; yea, both above     the earth and beneath. And behold, there shall be great tempests,     and there shall be many mountains laid low, like unto a valley,     and there shall be many places which are now called valleys, which     shall become mountains, whose height is great. And many highways     shall be broken up, and many cities shall become desolate, and many     graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of their dead;     and many saints shall appear unto many. And behold thus hath the     angel spoken unto me; for he said unto me, that there should be     thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours; and he     said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted and     the tempest, that these things should be, and that darkness should     cover the face of the whole earth [9] for the space of three days.     [10]  This prediction was literally and awfully fulfilled. Mormon's condensed account of it being as follows:      And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first     month, in the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm,     such an one as never had been known in all the land; and there was     also a great and terrible tempest; and there was terrible thunder,     insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as if it was about to     divide asunder; and there were exceeding sharp lightnings, such as     never had been known in all the land. And the city of Zarahemla     did take fire; and the city of Moroni did sink into the depths of     the sea, and the inhabitants thereof were drowned; and the earth     was carried up upon the city of Moronihah, that in the place of     the city there became a great mountain; and there was a great and     terrible destruction in the land southward. But behold, there     was a more great and terrible destruction in the land northward;     for behold, the whole face of the land was changed, because of     the tempest, and the whirlwinds, and the thunderings, and the     lightnings, and the exceeding great quaking of the whole earth;     and the highways were broken up, and the level roads were spoiled,     and many smooth places became rough, and many great and notable     cities were sunk, and many were burned, and many were shaken till     the buildings thereof had fallen to the earth, and the inhabitants     thereof were slain; and the places were left desolate; and there     were some cities which remained; but the damage thereof was     exceeding great, and there were many in them who were slain; and     there was some who were carried away in the whirlwind; and whither     they went, no man knoweth, save they know that they were carried     away; and thus the face of the whole earth became deformed, because     of the tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the     quaking of the earth. And behold, the rocks were rent in twain;     they were broken up upon the face of the whole earth, insomuch,     that they were found in broken fragments, and in seams, and in     cracks, upon all the face of the land. And it came to pass that     when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the storm, and the     tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease--for behold, they     did last for about the space of three hours; and it was said by     some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and     terrible things were done in about the space of three hours; and     then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the land. And it     came to pass that there was thick darkness upon all the face of the     land, insomuch, that the inhabitants thereof who had not fallen,     could feel the vapour of darkness; and there could be no light     because of the darkness; neither candles, neither torches; neither     could there be fire kindled with their fine and exceedingly dry wood,     so that there could not be any light at all; and there was not any     light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the     moon, nor the stars, so great were the mists of darkness which were     upon the face of the land. And it came to pass that it did last for     the space of three days, that there was no light seen; and there     was great mourning, and howling, and weeping among all the people     continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because     of the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them.     [11]  From the Book of Mormon we learn that it was in the morning that these terrible cataclysms began, and then were followed by the three days of darkness: for in giving an account of the passing away of this terrible calamity, Mormon says: \"Thus did the the three days pass away. And it was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from all the face of the earth and the earth did cease to tremble.\" [12] On this matter of the signs of Messiah's crucifixion taking place \"in the morning,\" according to American time, the late Orson Pratt made the following valuable comment:      This book, the Book of Mormon, informs us that the time of day     at which Jesus was crucified, I mean the time of day here in     America, was in the morning; the New Testament tells us that     Jesus was crucified in Asia in the afternoon, between the sixth     and ninth hour according to the Jews' reckoning. They commenced     their reckoning at six o'clock in the morning, and consequently     the sixth hour would be twelve o'clock at noon, and the ninth hour"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],["title","New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#2)"],["body","o'clock in the afternoon. Jesus, from the sixth to the ninth     hour, in other words from twelve o'clock to three, was hanging     on the cross. Now the Book of Mormon, or the historians whose     records it contains, when relating the incidents that transpired     at the time of the crucifixion--the darkness that was spread over     the face of the land, the earthquakes, the rending of rocks, the     sinking of cities and the whirlwinds--say these events occurred     in the morning; they also say that darkness was spread over the     face of the land for the space of three days. In Jerusalem it was     only three hours. But the Lord gave them a special sign in this     country and the darkness lasted three days, and at the expiration     of three days, and three nights of darkness, it cleared off, and it     was in the morning. That shows that, according to the time of this     country, [America] the crucifixion must have taken place in the     morning.  Says one, \"Is not this a contradiction between the Book of Mormon and the New Testament?\" To an unlearned person it would really be a contradiction, for the four Evangelists place it [the time during which Jesus was on the cross] from twelve to three in the afternoon, while the Book of Mormon says in the morning. An unlearned person, seeing this discrepancy, would say, of course, that both books cannot be true.  If the Book of Mormon be true the Bible cannot be; and if the Bible be true the Book of Mormon cannot be.  I do not known that anybody ever brought up this objection, for I do not think they ever thought of it. I do not think that the Prophet Joseph, who translated the book, ever thought of this apparent discrepancy. \"But,\" says one, \"how do you account for it being in the morning in America and in the afternoon in Jerusalem?\" Simply by the difference in longitude. This would make a difference of time of several hours; for when it would be twelve at noon in Jerusalem it would only be half-past four in the morning in the north-west part of South America, where the Book of Mormon was then being written. Seven and a half hours difference in longitude would account for this apparent discrepancy; and if the Book of Mormon had said the crucifixion took place in the afternoon we should have known at once that it could not be true. This is incidental proof to learned or scientific men that they cannot very well reason away, and especially when the instrument [i. e. Joseph Smith] who brought forth the Book of Mormon is considered. It must be remembered that he was but a youth, and unlearned; and, when he translated this work, I presume that he was unaware that there was any difference in the time of day, according to the longitude, in different parts of the earth. I do not suppose that Joseph ever thought about it to the day of his death. I never heard him or any other person bring forth this as confirmatory evidence of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon. I never thought of it myself until years after Joseph's death; but when I did reflect upon it, I could see the reason why the Lord, through his servants, has said in the Book of Mormon, that the crucifixion took place in the morning. [13]  In addition to the passages already quoted, giving the native traditions which, doubtless contain references to the cataclysms at the death of Messiah, as well as to the signs of his birth, Bancroft gives a Toltec tradition directly bearing on the subject, as follows:      The sun and moon were eclipsed, the earth shook, and the rocks were     rent asunder, and many other things and signs happened, though     there was no loss of life. This was in the year Ce Calli, which,     the chronology being reduced to our system, proves to be the same     date when Christ our Lord suffered, 33 A. D. [14]  The statement in the foregoing that there was no loss of life resulting from this cataclysm is the only item that mars its perfect agreement with the Book of Mormon incident.      Bouturini, commending the exact chronology of the ancient Mexicans     says: \"No pagan nation refers primitive events to fixed creation of     the world, of the deluge, of the confusion of tongues at the time     of the Tower of Babel, of the other epochs and ages of the world,     of their ancestors' long travel in Asia, with the years precisely     distinguished by their corresponding characters. They record in     the year of Seven Rabbits the great eclipse which happened at the     crucifixion of Christ our Lord. [15]  The date assigned for this eclipse of sun and moon (darkness), and the attendant earthquakes in the foregoing quotations, is corroborated in a very remarkable manner by the native Peruvian historian Montesinos, quoted by Rivero and Tschudi. In giving a list of the Peruvian monarchs, when reaching the sixtieth, Manco-Capac III., our authors say:      According to the Amautas [Peruvian \"wise men,\" or philosophers]     this prince reigned in the year two thousand nine hundred and fifty     after the deluge, and consequently at the birth of Jesus Christ, an     epoch when Peru had reached her highest elevation and extension.     [16]  Following this sixtieth monarch came Cayo-Manco-Capec III., who reigned twenty years. He was followed by Sinchi-Ayar-Manco, who reigned seven years. He, by Huamantaco-Amauta, who reigned five years; which brings us to the year thirty-two A. D., and then follows this statement by our authors, which corroborates the date cited by Bancroft for the cataclysm under consideration, viz:      During his reign [thirty-two or thirty-three A. D.], [17] they     experienced earthquakes that lasted several months. [18]  Brasseur de Bourbourg, [19] to whom Bancroft gives high praise as an authority on the languages and traditions of Central America, speaks of physical cataclysms which, according to the native traditions, took place in that part of America, and which are undoubtedly the imperfect accounts of those cataclysms which occurred at the death of Messiah, as recorded in the Book of Mormon. Brasseur became infatuated with the Atlantis theory, and regarded the native American traditions concerning the physical convulsions in nature as describing the submergence of the ancient Atlantis. With the theory of the learned Frenchman I have nothing to do. He may have made a wrong application of the facts of the native traditions. I think he did. But what I am interested in is the fact that so highly commended an authority draws from native sources the tradition of physical cataclysms which so nearly accord with the statements of fact in the Book of Mormon. [20] After relating Brasseur's connection with the Atlantis theory, Baldwin says:      In the first place, Brasseur de Bourbourg claims that there is in     the old Central American books a constant tradition of an immense     catastrophe of the character supposed [i. e., the convulsions which     submerged Atlantis]; that this tradition existed every where among     the people when they first became known to Europeans; and that     recollections of the catastrophe were preserved in some of their     festivals, especially in one celebrated in the month of Izcalli,     which was instituted to commemorate this frightful destruction     of land and people, and in which \"princes and people humbled     themselves before the divinity, and besought him to withhold a     return of such terrible calamities.\" This tradition affirms that     a part of the continent extending into the Atlantic was destroyed     in the manner supposed, [submerged] and appear to indicate that     the destruction was accomplished by a succession of frightful     convulsions. Three are constantly mentioned, and sometimes there     is mention of one or two others. \"The land was shaken by frightful     earthquakes, and the waves of the sea combined with volcanic fires     to overwhelm and ingulf it.\" Each convulsion swept away portions     of the land, until the whole disappeared, leaving the line of the     coast as it is now. Most of the inhabitants, overtaken amid their     regular employments, were destroyed; but some escaped in ships,     and some fled for safety to the summits of high mountains, or     to portions of the land which, for the time, escaped immediate     destruction. Quotations are made from the old books in which this     tradition is recorded which appear to verify his report of what is     found in them. To criticise intelligently his interpretation of     their significance, one needs to have a knowledge of those books     and tradition equal at least to his own. [21]  Nadaillac also refers to the native traditions collected by Brasseur on this subject and quotes him as follows:      If I may judge from allusions in the documents that I have been     fortunate enough to collect, there were in these regions, at that     remote date, convulsions of nature, deluges, terrible inundations,     followed by the upheaval of mountains, accompanied by volcanic     eruptions. These traditions, traces of which are also met with in     Mexico, Central America, Peru, and Bolivia, point to the conclusion     that man existed in these various countries at the time of the     upheaval of the Cordilleras, and that the memory of that upheaval     has been preserved: [22]  Treating of a number of old Central American traditions on his own account, Nadaillac says:      Other traditions allude to convulsions of nature, to inundations,     and profound disturbances, to terrible deluges, in the midst of     which mountains and volcanoes suddenly rose up. [23]  Nothing, perhaps, connected with the signs of Messiah's death would be more impressive than the awful fact of the three days' darkness, and nothing would be more likely to be preserved in the traditions of the people than this singular fact. From generation to generation it would be remembered with terror. It is beyond question the traditional remembrance of that event which so"]]]
