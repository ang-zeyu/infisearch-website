The Captain brought his glass into use again and looked the boy over, much as he would have inspected a curio in a museum. Jimmie glared back, and the eyes of the two fenced for a moment before a twinkle of humor appeared in those of the Captain.  \"You are Jimmie, eh?\" the latter demanded.  Jimmie would have made some discourteous reply only for the tug Ned gave at his sleeve. As it was he only nodded.  \"Aw, I've heard of you!\" the Captain said, then. \"Quite remarkable--quite extraordinary!\"  \"You came to deliver instructions regarding the submarine trip?\" Ned asked, feeling revolt in the air of the room.  Unless something was done, the boys, all resenting the manner of the Captain, would be beyond control, and then the Secret Service man would be likely to leave the place in anger.  This, in turn, might endanger the adventure already planned and prepared for, for the chief of the department might see fit to adopt whatever recommendations Captain Moore made in the matter.  The visitor might have sensed the hostility, for he hastened to take from a pocket a sheaf of papers and place them on the table. The next moment the boys all saw that they had not gained a correct estimate of the Secret Service man.  The instant he began talking of the matter which had brought him to the clubroom his manner changed. He was no longer the drawling, supercilious naval officer in resplendent uniform. He was a keen-brained mechanical expert, questioning Ned regarding his knowledge of submarines.  \"You are fairly well up in the matter,\" the Captain said, going back to his old drawl, in a few moments. \"I shall not object to your going on the Diver with me.\"  The boys all gasped. So their worst fears were coming true! The Captain was indeed going with them! He would be the commander, and Ned would be obliged to work under his orders if he went at all!  Would Ned do this? Would he submit to the authority of another while practically responsible for the results of the trip? Frank, Jack, and Jimmie saw their cherished plans go glimmering.  Ned made no reply whatever. Instead he began asking questions concerning the Diver as the submarine the Captain had in view was named, and also about the object of the expedition.  \"A short time ago,\" the Captain said, \"the Cutaria, a fast mail boat, went down in the Gulf of Tong King, carrying with her many passengers, the United States mails, and $10,000,000 in gold consigned to the Chinese Government. We are to search the ocean floor for the gold, and also for information sought by the Department of State.\"  \"Who got careless and dropped $10,000,000 on an ocean floor?\" asked Jimmie.     CHAPTER II  A CONFLICT OF AUTHORITY    The Captain gazed at Jimmie for a moment without answering. Then he parted his thin lips and uttered the old, familiar word:  \"Fawncy!\"  \"The Cutaria went down as the result of a collision?\" Ned hastened to ask, observing that Jimmie was growing flushed and angry.  \"Yes,\" was the reply, \"and it is asserted in the diplomatic circles of foreign governments that she was rammed by the orders of a power alleged to be friendly to our Government, and that our department of state does not dare remonstrate and ask for reparation for the reason that an investigation would reveal the fact that the $10,000,000 in gold which was lost was not really, as alleged, on its way from the sub-treasury in New York to the treasurer of the Chinese Empire.\"  \"But why should Uncle Sam be sending money over there?\" asked Ned.  \"It is asserted that the money was sent at the command of men high in influence in Washington who understood that it was to be seized while in transit, after reaching Chinese soil, and used to assist the radical fomentation now going on in China.\"  \"An indirect way, a sly and underhand way, of assisting the revolutionary party in China to get control of the government, eh?\" asked Ned.  \"Aw, that is what is claimed,\" was the reply.  \"And you are to have charge of the expedition?\" asked Ned, quietly, his eyes fixed keenly on the face of the visitor.  \"Orders,\" was the slow reply.  \"And the Diver has been chosen as the boat?\"  \"At my request, yes.\"  \"But,\" Ned then said, by way of protest, \"I have made all my trial trips in the Sea Lion.\"  \"You will soon learn to help handle the Diver,\" was the lofty reply.  \"The Diver is no more like the Sea Lion than she is like the Ark,\" was Ned's reply. \"It will take me another fortnight to learn to run her, I'm afraid.\"  \"You can take lessons from my son on the way over,\" was the unsatisfactory reply.  \"Why, the submarine is not going to sail across the Pacific,\" said the boy. \"As I understand it, we are to take passage in a mail steamer at San Francisco and find the submarine in some harbor of the island of Hainan, after she arrives on the other side in a man-of-war which will be detailed to carry her over.\"  \"I have changed all that,\" said the Captain.  Ned said no more on that phase of the matter at that time, but the boys knew that he had not given up his original intention of making the explorations in the Sea Lion, the submarine which the Secret Service chief at New York had placed at his disposal soon after his return from South America.  \"You will be permitted to take one of your--ah, Boy Scouts with you,\" the Captain went on. \"Baby bunch, the Boy Scouts, what?\" he added, lifting his glass and surveying the boys grouped about in a manner which brought the hot blood to their cheeks.  \"I'm afraid you have never investigated the Boy--\"  Ned's conciliatory remark was cut short by Jimmie.  \"Will the Boy Scout who goes with him be allowed to breathe?\" the boy asked.  Captain Moore eyed the lad critically through his glass.  \"You needn't concern yourself about that, bub,\" he said, after an exasperating silence, \"for you won't be the one to go, don't you know--not the Boy Scout to go.\"  Jimmie was about to make some angry reply, but Frank seized him by the arm and marched him to a distant part of the large room.  \"You'll queer the whole thing!\" Frank said.  Jimmie shook himself free of the detaining hand and faced the Captain with flashing eyes.  \"I don't care if I do!\" he said. \"That thing is not going to make ugly remarks about the Boy Scouts without bein' called for it. He's an old false alarm, anyway. I'll bet he never heard a real gun go off!\"  Captain Moore heard the insulting words and arose.  \"If you'll, aw, come to my office tomorrow morning,\" he said, to Ned, \"we'll discuss the, aw, mattah. I cawn't remain here and quarrel with boys who ought to be, aw, spanked and put, aw, to bed as soon as the sun goes down.\"  Ned did not rise from his chair to escort the Captain to the door. His face was pale and there was a dangerous light in his eyes.  \"It won't be necessary for me to visit you in the morning,\" he said.  The Captain fixed his glass.  \"Fawncy!\" he exclaimed.  \"Anything you like!\" Ned said.  \"Fawncy!\" repeated the Captain.  \"As you please,\" Ned smiled. \"Fawncy anything you like--anything agreeable, you know.\"  \"And why won't you come to my office in the morning?\" asked the Captain, with a tightening of his thin lips.  \"I have decided to withdraw from the enterprise,\" was the quiet reply. \"I'm out of it.\"  The boys gathered about Ned with cheers and words of encouragement.  \"Go it, old boy!\" cried one.  \"Don't let him bluff you!\" cried another.  \"Dad will buy you a submarine!\" Frank Shaw put in.  The Captain stood in the middle of the group, gazing in perplexity from face to face.  \"My word!\" he said, presently.  \"What about it?\" asked Jimmie, edging closer.  \"Not going?\" continued the Captain; \"why?\"  \"I've changed my mind,\" was the unsatisfactory reply.  \"But the submarine is waiting,\" urged the Captain.  \"I shall never go to the bottom in the Diver,\" Ned replied.  \"My word!\"  The Captain loitered, as if anxious to reopen the whole matter, but Ned turned his back and seemed inclined to consider the case closed.  \"And so we're not going?\" asked Frank.  \"Rotten shame!\" declared Jack.  \"So fades me happy, happy dream!\" chanted Jimmie.  The Captain stuck his glass in his eye and moved toward the door, an expression of satisfaction on his stern face.  No one opened the door for him, and when he opened it for himself, he found a slender, middle-aged man with a pleasant face and brilliant eyes confronting him. His supercilious manner vanished instantly, and the military cap he had already donned came off with a jerk.  \"Admiral!\" he exclaimed.  The boys gathered about the doorway, all excitement. A real, live admiral in the Boy Scout clubroom! That was almost too much to expect.  The admiral saluted and stepped inside the room.  \"Pardon me,\" he said, addressing Ned rather than the Captain, \"but I must confess that I have been doing a discourteous thing. I have been listening at your door.\"  \"I sincerely hope you heard all that was said,\" the Captain ventured. \"I have been shamefully insulted here.\"  \"Did you hear all that was said?\" asked Nestor.  The Admiral bowed.  \"I think so,\" he said.  \"I'm glad of that,\" Frank said, \"for this Captain does not tell the truth.\"  Captain Moore frowned in the direction of the speaker but said not a word.  \"When I reached the door,\" the Admiral said, \"I heard Captain Moore saying that the trip was to be made in the Diver, and that he was to have charge.\"  \"That is the way I understand it,\" Captain Moore hastened to say. \"And,\" continued the Admiral, \"he said, further, that only one Boy Scout would be permitted to accompany Mr. Nestor.\"  \"That will be quite enough, judging from the samples we see here,\" the Captain observed, with a vicious glance toward Jimmie, whose face was now set in a broad grin.  \"Those are the statements made by Captain Moore,\" Ned said. \"I refused to accept them.\"  \"Quite right!\" said the Admiral.  Captain Moore stuck his glass in his eye again and, saluting, turned toward the door.  \"Wait!\" commanded the Admiral.  The angry"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6108"],["title","Boy Scouts in a Submarine; Or, Searching an Ocean Floor (#2)"],["body","turned back, a scowl on his face.  \"Mr. Nestor,\" the Admiral continued, \"goes in charge of the expedition, and in the Sea Lion, the submarine he has been experimenting with. He will be permitted to take three of his companions with him. Any officer who goes in the Sea Lion will necessarily remain under Mr. Nestor's orders.\"  \"Then I ask for a transfer,\" scowled the Captain.  \"Granted,\" answered the Admiral. \"You may go now.\"  Captain Moore lost no time getting out of the door, and then the Admiral seated himself and motioned Ned to do likewise. The boys gathered about, but Ned asked them to proceed with their sports, and only the ex-newsboy remained at the table.  \"I'm sorry to say,\" the Admiral began, \"that there are hints of the most despicable disloyalty and treachery in this matter. I don't like to cast suspicions on Captain Moore, who really is an expert submarine officer, but it appears to me that he went beyond his authority in changing the plans for the cruise.\"  \"He had no authority for changing from the Sea Lion to the Diver?\" asked Ned.  \"Not the slightest.\"  \"Or for changing from a steamer ride to China to a long journey on the submarine?\"  \"Not at all.\"  \"But he was sent here by the Secret Service department to instruct me,\" Ned said.  \"Exactly, and that is all he was expected to do in the case. I don't understand his conduct.\"  Jimmie, who had been looking over an afternoon newspaper which lay on the table, now broke into the conversation.  \"Just look here,\" he said. \"This tells why Captain Moore butted into the game wrong. Just read that.\"  The Admiral took the newspaper into his hand and read, aloud:  \"The Diver, the famous submarine boat invented by Arthur Moore, the talented son of Captain Henry Moore, of the United States navy, is soon to be put in commission for a most extraordinary voyage. Under the command of Captain Moore, who will be accompanied by the inventor, his son, the Diver will make the trip from San Francisco to China, almost entirely under water. It is understood that the submarine goes on secret service for the Government.\"  \"There you are!\" cried Jimmie.  \"I rather think that does explain a lot,\" laughed Ned.  \"The Diver,\" said the Admiral, thoughtfully, \"has not yet been accepted by the Government, and I see trouble ahead for the Sea Lion.\"     CHAPTER III  \"THE DANDY SUBMARINE\"    The Sea Lion was a United States submarine, yet she was not constructed along the usual naval lines. It was said of her that she looked more like a pleasure yacht built for under-surface work than anything else.  It is not the purpose of the writer to enter into a minute description of the craft. She was provided with a gasoline engine and an electric motor. She was not very roomy, but her appointments were very handsome and costly.  There were machines for manufacturing pure air, as is common with all submarines of her class, and the apparatus for the production of electricity was modern and efficient. Every compartment could be closed against every other chamber in case of damage to the shell.  The pumps designed to expel the water taken into the hold for the purpose of bringing the craft to the bottom were powerful, so that she seemed to sink and rise as easily as does a bird on the wing. At top speed she would make about twenty miles an hour.  On a trial trip taken by Ned on the day before the visit of Captain Moore to the Black Bear clubroom, the double doors and closet which enabled one to leave or enter the boat while under water had been thoroughly tested and found to work perfectly.  The diving suits--which had been manufactured to fit Ned and Frank, Jack and Jimmie--were also found to be in perfect condition.  On the whole, the Sea Lion and her appurtenances were in as perfect condition as science and experience could make them on the day the four boys, accompanied by a naval officer, left the train at Oakland and proceeded to the navy yard up the bay.  By the middle of the afternoon the boys were on board, receiving their final instructions from Lieutenant Scott, who had arranged for the transportation of the Sea Lion from New York and attended to all other details connected with the trip.  After a long talk regarding the perils to be encountered, Lieutenant Scott drew forth a map of peculiar appearance and laid it on the table in the chamber which was to serve as a general living room.  \"I have retained possession of this map until the last moment,\" the officer said, \"because it is most important that no eyes but those of the occupants of the Sea Lion should rest upon it. It shows where the lost vessel went down, shows the drift there, the depths, and various other details of great moment.  \"The Cutaria, as you doubtless know, went down off the Taya Islands, a small group to the east of the large island of Hainan, which, in turn, is off the coast of China, being separated, if that is a good word to use in this connection, from the eastern coast by the Gulf of Tong King.  \"Immediately following the sinking of the ship divers were sent down. They found the lost ship resting easily in about sixty feet of water. A few days later, however, when other divers went down, the wreck was not at the place described by the first operators.  \"There are drift currents there, but it is remarkable that so heavy a wreck should have been shifted so suddenly. There are no indications that the vessel has been buried in the sands of the bottom. Your duty is to search the ocean floor then and locate the wreck. Having done this you are to secure the treasure, if possible. In case you cannot do this, you are to steam to Hongkong and report what assistance you require.  \"And remember this: You are not to destroy or mislay any documents you may find in the gold room. You are not to reveal the purpose of your mission at any port you may touch on the way out, or at any port you may visit for the purpose of reporting progress.  \"If at any time you have reason to believe that another submarine is working or loitering about in the vicinity of the wreck, you are to report the fact without delay and a man-of-war will be sent to you.\"  \"And that means--\"  Ned did not complete the sentence, for the officer hastened to explain the meaning of the warning.  \"The Diver,\" he said, \"is somewhere on this coast.\"  Ned gave a quick start of surprise.  \"I knew it!\" shouted Jimmie. \"I just knew we were in for somethin' of the kind! There'll be doin's.\"  \"I reckon we can take care of the Diver,\" said Frank, \"and Mr. Arthur Moore, son of Captain Henry Moore, with it.\"  \"Don't underestimate the Diver,\" warned Lieutenant Scott. \"She is a peach of a submarine, and Mr. Arthur Moore knows how to operate her. She is almost the latest thing in submarines.\"  \"Why didn't the Government buy her, then?\" demanded Jack.  \"Principally because she was withdrawn from the market,\" was the reply.  \"I begin to understand,\" Ned said.  \"Then that son of Captain Moore is after the gold?\" asked Jack.  \"That is what we suspect.\"  \"Well,\" Frank said, then, \"it wouldn't be any fun to go after the old wreck if all was clear sailing.\"  \"Right you are!\" cried Jimmie.  \"But how did they get the Diver here so quickly?\" asked Ned.  \"The same way I got the Sea Lion here,\" was the Lieutenant's reply. \"They engaged a special train, took the boat to pieces as far as practicable and sent her over.\"  \"But she is something of a whale as compared with the little Sea Lion,\" urged Ned. \"It was easy enough to get our boat across the continent.\"  \"Not quite so easy as you think,\" laughed the officer. \"Still,\" he added, \"here she is, all ready for the trip. There are plenty of provisions, and everything is in fine working order. You, Mr. Nestor, took a hand in taking the submarine to pieces, and you ought to know all about her.\"  \"I think I do,\" was the reply, \"still, I should have liked the chance of putting her together again.\"  \"It is all right as it is,\" was the reply. \"You doubtless had a good time in New York while the work was being done here. When I left for the big city to ride over with you she was nearly ready, and now, on our arrival, she is, as you see, right and fit.\"  \"But I thought we were to cross the Pacific in a steamer and pick up the Sea Lion over there,\" Ned observed.  \"Right you are,\" the Lieutenant answered, \"but the Sea Lion is to be taken over by the big steamer, too.\"  \"Then they've got to take her to pieces again,\" wailed Jimmie, \"and it will be weeks before we get started.\"  \"You are wrong there,\" the officer replied. \"The Sea Lion will be picked up by something like a floating dock and towed over. How does that strike you?\"  \"Out of water?\" asked Frank.  \"Of course. Novel way of carrying a submarine, eh?\"  \"I should say so.\"  \"Over there,\" the Lieutenant went on, \"there would be no facilities for assembling the parts. That is why the work was done here.\"  \"Of course,\" laughed Frank.  \"And this floating dry dock,\" continued the officer, \"will be roofed over and its contents kept secret. A short distance from the Taya Islands, she will be shucked of her shell and take to the water. No one will know what her mission is.\"  \"It seems to me that everything is pretty cleverly planned,\" Ned remarked. \"I hope all my plans will come together as nicely as the plans of the Government have.\"  \"That will be a big tow for a steamer,\" Jimmie suggested.  \"Yes, it is awkward, but there seemed to be no other way. The Diver will be far in the rear and you take water off the Taya Islands.\"  \"And on the way over,\" Ned said, \"I can live in the Sea Lion and continue my studies of the machinery.\"  \"That is the idea,\" said the Lieutenant.  \"When are we to be picked up?\" asked Jack.  The Lieutenant lifted a hand for silence.  From outside, seemingly from underneath the keel of the Sea Lion, came a grating sound, which was followed by a slight, though steady, lifting of the vessel.  \"Gee!\" cried Jimmie, springing to his feet. \"I guess we're up against an earthquake!\""]]]
