Is it not the manly part to go on as we have begun, to raise money, and levy Armies, to organize them, to prepare to advance; when we do advance, to regulate that advance by all the laws and regulations that civilization and humanity will allow in time of battle?  Can we do anything more?  To talk to us about stopping, is idle; we will never stop.  Will the Senator yield to Rebellion?  Will he shrink from armed Insurrection? Will his State justify it?  Will its better public opinion allow it? Shall we send a flag of Truce?  What would he have?  Or would he conduct this War so feebly, that the whole World would smile at us in derision?\"  And then cried the orator-his voice rising to a higher key, penetrating, yet musical as the blast from a silver trumpet: \"What would he have? These speeches of his, sown broadcast over the Land, what clear distinct meaning have they?  Are they not intended for disorganization in our very midst?  Are they not intended to dull our weapons?  Are they not intended to destroy our zeal?  Are they not intended to animate our enemies?  Sir, are they not words of brilliant, polished Treason, even in the very Capitol of the Nation?  \"What would have been thought, if, in another Capitol, in another Republic, in a yet more martial age, a Senator as grave, not more eloquent or dignified than the Senator from Kentucky, yet with the Roman purple flowing over his shoulder, had risen in his place, surrounded by all the illustrations of Roman glory, and declared that the cause of advancing Hannibal was just, and that Carthage ought to be dealt with in terms of peace?  What would have been thought if, after the battle of Cannae, a Senator there had risen in his place and denounced every levy of the Roman People, every expenditure of its treasure, and every appeal to the old recollections and the old glories?\"  The speaker paused.  The sudden and intent silence was broken by another voice: \"He would have been hurled from the Tarpeian rock.\"  \"Sir,\" continued the soldier-orator, \"a Senator, himself learned far more than myself in such lore, [Mr. Fessenden,] tells me, in a voice that I am glad is audible, that he would have been hurled from the Tarpeian Rock!  It is a grand commentary upon the American Constitution that we permit these words [Senator Breckinridge's] to be uttered.  \"I ask the Senator to recollect, too, what, save to send aid and comfort to the Enemy, do these predictions of his amount to?  Every word thus uttered falls as a note of inspiration upon every Confederate ear. Every sound thus uttered is a word, (and, falling from his lips, a mighty word) of kindling and triumph to a Foe that determines to advance.  \"For me, I have no such word as a Senator, to utter.  For me\"--and here his eyes flashed again while his martial voice rang like a clarion-call to battle--\"amid temporary defeat, disaster, disgrace, it seems that my duty calls me to utter another word, and that word is, bold, sudden, forward, determined, WAR, according to the laws of War, by Armies, by Military Commanders clothed with full power, advancing with all the past glories of the Republic urging them on to conquest!                       *  *  *  *  *  *  \"I tell the Senator,\" continued the inspired Patriot, \"that his predictions, sometimes for the South, sometimes for the Middle States, sometimes for the North-East, and then wandering away in airy visions out to the Far Pacific, about the dread of our people, as for loss of blood and treasure, provoking them to Disloyalty, are false in sentiment, false in fact, and false in Loyalty.  The Senator from Kentucky is mistaken in them all.  \"Five hundred million dollars!  What then?  Great Britain gave more than two thousand million in the great Battle for Constitutional Liberty which she led at one time almost single-handed against the World.  Five hundred thousand men!  What then?  We have them; they are ours; they are the children of the Country; they belong to the whole Country; they are our sons; our kinsmen; and there are many of us who will give them all up before we will abate one word of our just demand, or will retreat one inch from the line which divides right from wrong.  \"Sir, it is not a question of men or of money in that sense.  All the money, all the men, are, in our judgment, well bestowed in such a cause. When we give them, we know their value.  Knowing their value well, we give them with the more pride and the, more joy.  Sir, how can we retreat?  Sir, how can we make Peace?  Who shall treat?  What Commissioners?  Who would go?  Upon what terms?  Where is to be your boundary line?  Where the end of the principles we shall have to give up?  What will become of Constitutional Government?  What will become of public Liberty?  What of past glories?  What of future hopes?  \"Shall we sink into the insignificance of the grave--a degraded, defeated, emasculated People, frightened by the results of one battle, and scared at the visions raised by the imagination of the Senator from Kentucky on this floor?  No, Sir! a thousand times, no, Sir!  We will rally--if, indeed, our words be necessary--we will rally the People, the Loyal People, of the whole Country.  They will pour forth their treasure, their money, their men, without stint, without measure.  The most peaceable man in this body may stamp his foot upon this Senate Chamber floor, as of old a warrior and a Senator did, and from that single tramp there will spring forth armed Legions.  \"Shall one battle determine the fate of empire, or a dozen?--the loss of one thousand men, or twenty thousand?  or one hundred million or five hundred million dollars?  In a year's Peace--in ten years, at most, of peaceful progress--we can restore them all.  There will be some graves reeking with blood, watered by the tears of affection.  There will be some privation; there will be some loss of luxury; there will be somewhat more need for labor to procure the necessaries of life.  When that is said, all is said.  If we have the Country, the whole Country, the Union, the Constitution, Free Government--with these there will return all the blessings of well-ordered civilization; the path of the Country will be a career of greatness and of glory such as, in the olden time, our Fathers saw in the dim visions of years yet to come, and such as would have been ours now, to-day, if it had not been for the Treason for which the Senator too often seeks to apologize.\"  This remarkable speech was the last utterance of that glorious and courageous soul, in the National Senate.  Within three months, his lifeless body, riddled by Rebel rifle balls, was borne away from the fatal field of Ball's Bluff--away, amid the lamentations of a Nation --away, across land and ocean--to lie beside his brave friend Broderick, on that Lone Mountain whose solemn front looks out upon the calm Pacific.  He had not lived in vain.  In his great speech at the American Theatre in San Francisco, after his election by Oregon (1860) to represent her in the United States Senate, he had aroused the people to a sense of shame, that, as he said: \"Here, in a land of written Constitutional Liberty it is reserved for us to teach the World that, under the American Stars and Stripes, Slavery marches in solemn procession; that, under the American flag, Slavery is protected to the utmost verge of acquired territory; that under the American banner, the name of Freedom is to be faintly heard, the songs of Freedom faintly sung; that, while Garibaldi, Victor Emanuel, every great and good man in the World, strives, struggles, fights, prays, suffers and dies, sometimes on the scaffold, sometimes in the dungeon, often on the field of battle, rendered immortal by his blood and his valor; that, while this triumphal procession marches on through the arches of Freedom--we, in this land, of all the World, shrink back trembling when Freedom is but mentioned!\"  And never was a shamed people more suddenly lifted up from that shame into a grand frenzy of patriotic devotion than were his auditors, when, with the inspiration of his matchless genius, he continued:  \"As for me, I dare not, will not, be false to Freedom.  Where the feet of my youth were planted, there, by Freedom, my feet shall ever stand. I will walk beneath her banner.  I will glory in her strength.  I have watched her in history struck down on an hundred chosen fields of battle.  I have seen her friends fly from her; her foes gather around her.  I have seen her bound to the stake; I have seen them give her ashes to the winds.  But when they turned to exult, I have seen her again meet them face to face, resplendent in complete steel, brandishing in her strong right hand a flaming sword, red with Insufferable light! I take courage.  The People gather around her.  The genius of America will, at last, lead her sons to Freedom.\"  Never were grander utterances delivered by man in all the ages; never was there exhibited a more sublime faith; never a truer spirit of prophecy; never a more heroic spirit.  He was then on his way to Washington; on his way to perform the last acts in the drama of his own career--on his way to death.  He knew the time had come, of which, ten years before, he had prophetically spoken in the House of Representatives, when he said: \"I have only to say that, if the time should come when Disunion rules the hour, and discord is to reign supreme, I shall again be ready to give the best blood in my veins to my Country's Cause.  I shall be prepared to meet all antagonists with lance in rest, to do battle in every land, in defense of the Constitution of the Country which I have sworn to support, to the last extremity, against Disunionists, and all its Enemies, whether of the South or North; to meet them everywhere, at all times, with speech or hand, with word or blow, until thought and being shall be no longer mine.\"  And right nobly did he fulfil in all respects his promise; so that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7137"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 5 (#1)"],["body","cannot succeed unless we try; but we think, with care, we can succeed.  \"The political affairs in Central America are not in quite as satisfactory condition as I wish.  There are contending factions in that quarter; but it is true, all the factions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization, and want it; and are more generous than we are here.  To your Colored race they have no objection.  Besides, I would endeavor to have you made equals, and have the best assurance that you should be the equals of the best.  \"The practical thing I want to ascertain is, whether I can get a number of able-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to go, when I present evidence of encouragement and protection.  Could I get a hundred tolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children, and able to 'cut their own fodder' so to speak?  Can I have fifty?  If I could find twenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and children--good things in the family relation, I think I could make a successful commencement.  \"I want you to let me know whether this can be done or not.  This is the practical part of my wish to see you.  These are subjects of very great importance--worthy of a month's study, of a speech delivered in an hour. I ask you, then, to consider seriously, not as pertaining to yourselves merely, nor for your race, and ours, for the present time, but as one of the things, if successfully managed, for the good of mankind--not confined to the present generation, but as:                \"From age to age descends the lay                To millions yet to be,                Till far its echoes roll away                Into eternity.\"'  President Lincoln's well-meant colored colonization project, however, fell through, owing partly to opposition to it in Central America, and partly to the very natural and deeply-rooted disinclination of the Colored free men to leave the land of their birth.  Meanwhile, limited Military Emancipation of Slaves was announced and regulated, on the 22d July, 1862, by the following Executive Instructions, which were issued from the War Department by order of the President--the issue of which was assigned by Jefferson Davis as one reason for his Order of August 1, 1862, directing \"that the commissioned officers of Pope's and Steinwehr's commands be not entitled, when captured, to be treated as soldiers and entitled to the benefit of the cartel of exchange:\"   \"WAR DEPARTMENT, \"WASHINGTON, D.C., July 22, 1862.  \"First.  Ordered that Military Commanders within the States of Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas, in an orderly manner seize and use any property, real or personal, which may be necessary or convenient for their several commands, for supplies, or for other Military purposes; and that while property may be destroyed for proper Military objects, none shall be destroyed in wantonness or malice.  \"Second.  That Military and Naval Commanders shall employ as laborers, within and from said States, so many Persons of African descent as can be advantageously used for Military or Naval purposes, giving them reasonable wages for their labor.  \"Third.  That, as to both property, and Persons of African descent, accounts shall be kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show quantities and amounts, and from whom both property and such Persons shall have come, as a basis upon which compensation can be made in proper cases; and the several departments of this Government shall attend to and perform their appropriate parts towards the execution of these orders.  \"By Order of the President:                           \"EDWIN M. STANTON,                          \"Secretary of War.\"   On the 9th of August, 1862, Major General McClellan promulgated the Executive Order of July 22, 1862, from his Headquarters at Harrison's Landing, Va., with certain directions of his own, among which were the following:  \"Inhabitants, especially women and children, remaining peaceably at their homes, must not be molested; and wherever commanding officers find families peculiarly exposed in their persons or property to marauding from this Army, they will, as heretofore, so far as they can do with safety and without detriment to the service, post guards for their protection.  \"In protecting private property, no reference is intended to Persons held to service or labor by reason of African Descent.  Such Persons will be regarded by this Army, as they heretofore have been, as occupying simply a peculiar legal status under State laws, which condition the Military authorities of the United States are not required to regard at all in districts where Military operations are made necessary by the rebellious action of the State governments.  \"Persons subject to suspicion of hostile purposes, residing or being near our Forces, will be, as heretofore, subject to arrest and detention, until the cause or necessity is removed.  All such arrested parties will be sent, as usual, to the Provost-Marshal General, with a statement of the facts in each case.  \"The General Commanding takes this occasion to remind the officers and soldiers of this Army that we are engaged in supporting the Constitution and the Laws of the United States and suppressing Rebellion against their authority; that we are not engaged in a War of rapine, revenge, or subjugation; that this is not a contest against populations, but against armed forces and political organizations; that it is a struggle carried on with the United States, and should be conducted by us upon the highest principles known to Christian civilization.  \"Since this Army commenced active operations, Persons of African descent, including those held to service or labor under State laws, have always been received, protected, and employed as laborers at wages. Hereafter it shall be the duty of the Provost-Marshal General to cause lists to be made of all persons of African descent employed in this Army as laborers for Military purposes--such lists being made sufficiently accurate and in detail to show from whom such persons shall have come.  \"Persons so subject and so employed have always understood that after being received into the Military service of the United States, in any capacity, they could never be reclaimed by their former holders.  Except upon such understanding on their part, the order of the President, as to this class of Persons, would be inoperative.  The General Commanding therefore feels authorized to declare to all such employees, that they will receive permanent Military protection against any compulsory return to a condition of servitude.\"  Public opinion was now rapidly advancing, under the pressure of Military necessity, and the energetic efforts of the immediate Emancipationists, to a belief that Emancipation by Presidential Proclamation would be wise and efficacious as an instrumentality toward subduing the Rebellion; that it must come, sooner or later--and the sooner, the better.  Indeed, great fault was found, by some of these, with what they characterized as President Lincoln's \"obstinate slowness\" to come up to their advanced ideas on the subject.  He was even accused of failing to execute existing laws touching confiscation of Slaves of Rebels coming within the lines of the Union Armies.  On the 19th of August, 1862, a letter was addressed to him by Horace Greeley which concluded thus:  \"On the face of this wide Earth, Mr. President, there is not one disinterested, determined, intelligent champion of the Union Cause who does not feel that all attempts to put down the Rebellion, and at the same time uphold its inciting cause, are preposterous and futile--that the Rebellion, if crushed out to-morrow, would be renewed within a year if Slavery were left in full vigor--that Army officers, who remain to this day devoted to Slavery, can at best be but half-way loyal to the Union--and that every hour of deference to Slavery is an hour of added and deepened peril to the Union.  \"I appeal to the testimony of your embassadors in Europe.  It is freely at your service, not mine.  Ask them to tell you candidly whether the seeming subserviency of your policy to the Slaveholding, Slavery-upholding interest, is not the perplexity, the despair, of Statesmen of all parties; and be admonished by the general answer.  \"I close, as I began, with the statement that what an immense majority of the loyal millions of your countrymen require of you, is a frank, declared, unqualified, ungrudging execution of the Laws of the Land, more especially of the Confiscation Act.  That Act gives Freedom to the Slaves of Rebels coming within our lines, or whom those lines may at any time inclose.  We ask you to render it due obedience by publicly requiring all your subordinates to recognize and obey it.  \"The Rebels are everywhere using the late Anti-Negro riots in the North --as they have long used your officers' treatment of Negroes in the South--to convince the Slaves that they have nothing to hope from a Union success--that we mean in that case to sell them into a bitter Bondage to defray the cost of the War.  \"Let them impress this as a truth on the great mass of their ignorant and credulous Bondmen, and the Union will never be restored--never.  We can not conquer ten millions of people united in solid phalanx against us, powerfully aided by Northern sympathizers and European allies.  \"We must have scouts, guides, spies, cooks, teamsters, diggers, and choppers, from the Blacks of the South--whether we allow them to fight for us or not--or we shall be baffled and repelled.  \"As one of the Millions who would gladly have avoided this struggle, at any sacrifice but that of principle and honor, but who now feel that the triumph of the Union is indispensable not only to the existence of our Country, but to the well-being of mankind, I entreat you to render a hearty and unequivocal obedience to the Law of the Land.
