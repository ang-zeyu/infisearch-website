Comes down C., stiffly, and remarks, “Yow,” then goes up. MRS.   ANDERSON enters D. in F. with dishes and sets table in recess with   back to audience. He goes towards MRS. ANDERSON. She starts on seeing   his strange manner. He turns and goes across and straight off D. in   F., she goes after him._)  MRS. ANDERSON (_calling after him_). Mr. Everest, sir!    (_Exit AUTOMATON D. in F._)    (_Exit MRS. ANDERSON D. in F._)    (_JACK and STELLA enter from R._)  JACK. I left him changing his coat.  STELLA (_looking out of window_). There he is turning the corner; he _has_ changed his coat.  JACK. Let’s have a proper look at this wonderful thing before the old lady comes.    (_They fetch out chair with WALTER seated on it and bring it down   stage, where they wheel the chair right round so that the stunned   WALTER faces audience. He is hatless._)  STELLA. Hasn’t it slipped down in the chair since we saw it last?  JACK. I don’t think so.  STELLA. Look at its eyes--Jack, they’re opening--it’s moving!  JACK. Great Heavens! it’s being born!  WALTER (_half stunned and waking_). Where am I?  STELLA. It speaks!  JACK. It’s living!  WALTER. I want a drink!  JACK. Good lord! It drinks!    (_STELLA screams and falls on seat. Bell again rings loudly off R._)  Hullo! there’s Mrs. Everest! (_He takes WALTER, who has risen, by the arm._) Come with me, sir (_leads him to bedroom L._). In there with you, quick!    (_Kicks him in quickly, and locks door._)    (_STELLA meantime has hurried up with the chair and put it in cupboard   and closes door._)  Phew! this is the most extraordinary thing! (_Hurries down, saying:_) Where are the telegraph forms?    (_As he snatches them from nail on wall, and sits to write R., MRS.   ANDERSON enters D. in F. out of breath and with a telegram; she is   in process of dressing, her hair being in disorder, and she wears a   dressing jacket._)  MRS. ANDERSON. Telegrapheram, sir. (_Down and gives it._)  JACK (_looking at telegram_). From Mrs. Everest--“Have missed train, don’t wait lunch--coming by next.” Thank goodness! (_To MRS. ANDERSON._) I suppose you don’t know where I can find a detective?  MRS. ANDERSON. Yes, sir, I does. Being my own nephew as lives in the attic.  JACK (_writes several telegrams, as:_) I want him at once----  MRS. ANDERSON. Lawk a floury me!    (_Hurries out D. in F._)  STELLA. What are you writing? (_Takes up one of the telegrams._) “Walter Everest, _Ship Hotel_, Brighton. Cyril Davidson is living. Come home.”    (_WALTER knocks loudly at bedroom door._)  Jack! listen!  JACK (_still writing--knocking repeated_). Coming--coming.    (_Knocking ceases--he continues._)  This goes to every hotel in Brighton.  STELLA. He may not be at an hotel.  JACK. That’s why I’ve sent for a detective----    (_JOBBINS enters, hat in hand and umbrella under arm; he is a stout   man, rather shabbily dressed in tweed, with tweed frock-coat, and has   a square-topped bowler._)  JOBBINS. My name is Jobbins, sir. (_Gives large card._) Private inquiry and detective agent, utmost secrecy and despatch, parties watched, missing relatives traced, divorces ensured.  JACK. This is a very simple matter, Mr. Jobbins. The gentleman who resides here left home suddenly. I want him fetched back at once. (_Sits and writes note as:_)  JOBBINS. Yes, sir (_goes up, then returns_), where is he? (_With notebook open to take notes._)  JACK. Brighton.  JOBBINS (_notes_). Brighton--what hotel, sir?  JACK. Do you think if I knew what hotel I should require a detective?  JOBBINS. Then how am I to find him?  JACK. The best thing will be to take the first train to Brighton.  JOBBINS (_notes_). First train to Brighton.  JACK. He may be at a boarding-house.  JOBBINS (_notes_). Possibly a boarding-house.  JACK. When you find him give him this note (_closing it and giving it_), and send me a wire. (_Gives five-pound note._) There is some cash for your expenses.  STELLA. How is he to know Walter?  JACK. Isn’t there a photograph? (_Finds one on mantel R._) Here we are. (_Gives it._)  JOBBINS. I’ll walk about the Brighton streets with this--why, I seen this gent in the public gardens five minutes ago.  JACK. Then after him and bring him back.  JOBBINS (_at D. in F._). You’ll hear from me--BY WIRE.    (_Exit._)  JACK (_calls out after him_). Follow him to Victoria; if you miss him, go right on. (_Comes down._) I’ve forgotten these telegrams.  STELLA. I’ll take them.  JACK (_gives them_). Have you any cash?  STELLA. Yes. (_Hurries out D. in F._)    (_A very loud peremptory knocking at D.L. JACK listens a moment--it is   repeated._)  JACK. Getting nasty! (_Loud knocking._)  WALTER (_off, calls_). I say--let me out!  JACK. Now if I had not known, I should have said that was Walter. The voice was a trifle thick at starting, but now its identical.  WALTER (_off_). Let me out. (_Loud knocking._)  JACK. I suppose I’ll have to.    (_He goes and unlocks door and returns to R. front--WALTER comes   out._)  WALTER. What is the meaning of all this?  JACK. That’s exactly what I want to know.  WALTER. Locking a fellow in a bedroom.  JACK (_aside_). Calls itself a fellow and knows it’s a bedroom!  WALTER. I feel as stupid (_he is still half-stunned_) as an owl. Where is Stella?  JACK. Knows about Stella!  WALTER. What are you muttering?  JACK. Knows I’m muttering!  WALTER. Well?  JACK. Well.  WALTER. Why the devil don’t you speak?  JACK. Knows there’s a devil! I really don’t quite know what to do with you till your creator returns.  WALTER. What?--How?  JACK. What or how--same thing. This is a pretty pickle, Mr. Cyril Davidson.  WALTER. Mr. _What_?  JACK. Of course you don’ know your name yet; that is what you were christened, Cyril Davidson, so I call you Cyril Davidson.  WALTER. Oh, you do, do you? that’s very clever of you. My mind’s a blank, I can’t remember what happened before I woke up on that chair.  JACK. No one remembers what happened before they were born.  WALTER (_bangs a book down on table_). Oh, damned nonsense!  JACK. I wonder what you think of the world now you’ve come into it; what are your general impressions of mankind?  WALTER. Was this why you locked me in the bedroom?  JACK. Exactly.  WALTER. And are you going to keep this up?  JACK. Decidedly.  WALTER. I can’t see much sense in it myself; however, if it pleases you--I’m going to have some lunch. (_Goes up to table in recess._)  JACK (_calls up_). Mr. Davidson! (_No answer._) I’ve made it angry. (_Calls._) Mr. Davidson--I say, Davidson--Mr. Cyril Davidson--sir,--oh, it’s in a pet and declines to answer me.    (_STELLA enters D. in F._)  STELLA. Jack, a boy brought this. (_Gives note._)  JACK (_tears it open_). Jobbins is something like a detective. “Just seen Mr. Everest, he is running. Jobbins.”  STELLA. Running?  JACK. The electric individual is in there.  STELLA. You let it out? What is it doing?  JACK. Lunching.  WALTER (_at table in alcove, mixing salad_). Nothing here but salad! (_With beer bottle._) Beer, who wants beer?  JACK. Knows all about everything!  STELLA. It’s been listening in the cupboard before it lived. (_Pause and then asks._) Should we speak to it?  JACK. It’s very bad-tempered, but I daresay it won’t hurt you. (_They go up._) I say, Davidson!  WALTER. Bah! (_They start back._)  STELLA. Poor thing! tell it it’s amongst friends.    (_They again approach._)  JACK. This young lady is very anxious to make your acquaintance, Mr. Davidson!    (_WALTER smashes crockery with a beer bottle; they start and come down   in fright, then approach again._)  STELLA. Please, Mr. Davidson!  WALTER (_turns_). Oh, _you’ve_ come back; has Jack told you what he’s playing at?    (_He comes down a little--they retreat from him._)  JACK. Isn’t it wonderful! Calls me Jack!  WALTER (_as they are staring at him_). When you’ve done staring, perhaps you’ll drop this.  STELLA. Jack, I can’t believe it! (_WALTER walks about in rage._)  JACK. At first I couldn’t, but there is a difference, I begin to see it, a very subtle difference; watch how it moves; aren’t its joints a little stiff and so on?  WALTER (_quick step to him_). You thick-headed-addle-pated numskull!    (_JACK in fright falls headlong backwards over sofa L., STELLA runs   and crouches R., then they rise on knees and wave to pacify him._)  JACK. Gently, gently!  STELLA. Oh, please, Mr. Davidson, please don’t be so angry; we are both awfully interested in you and really sorry for you. It must be terrible to be born full grown.  WALTER. Am I mad, or are you?  JACK. _You_ are.  WALTER. That’s settled.  STELLA. Of course, you think you’re real, but we _know_. You’re only a made thing, like a cheese or a pudding.  WALTER (_hand to head_). You honestly say and believe that I am my own invention? (_They nod solemnly._)  WALTER. Am I myself, or am I the thing I made?  JACK. You are the thing you made.  WALTER. Then where is myself--the other fellow?  JACK. Your esteemed creator left home before you began to exist, changed coats and went.  WALTER. Changed coats? I never changed coats at all!  JACK.   }         } What? STELLA. }  WALTER. The moment I tried to, the figure rose up and stunned me.  STELLA (_up to him, throws arms round him_). It’s Walter!    (_Enter MRS. ANDERSON with telegram D. in F., and gives it. JACK opens   it._)  MRS. ANDERSON (_seeing WALTER_). Ow! Ow! Lawk a floury me!    (_Exit._)  JACK. Jobbins is somewhere near Euston. (_Gives telegram to STELLA._)  WALTER. Who’s Jobbins?  JACK. The detective who’s gone after you to bring you back.  WALTER. Then it really went out?  STELLA (_reading telegram_). “Have taken a cab, he’s still running.” What will happen if Mr. Jobbins catches it?  WALTER. I expect he _will_ catch it.  JACK. Another telegram! (_Going up to D. in F._)    (_MRS. ANDERSON hands in a telegram and retires._)    (_Coming down, reading:_) “He has smashed some more windows, and is   still running.”  STELLA (_taking the telegram_).

JACK. “He has just climbed a tall chimney stack marked Bovril, and is now sitting on the top.”  WALTER. Good Lord!  JACK. “Marked Bovril,” is this to be your fate, alas, my poor brother!  WALTER (_snatches the wire and reads_). “They are fetching a fire escape. He keeps yowling.”  STELLA (_taking telegram_). Yowling?  WALTER. Suppose the police get him and think it’s me, I’ll be blamed for all this damned thing. We must catch him. We’ll buy a gag and handcuffs as we go along.  STELLA. Gag? Why?  WALTER. Because he’s yowling! Stop! Stella must stay in case Mrs. Everest comes. (_Calls._) Mrs. Anderson! I want a cab!    (_He and JACK rush out D. in F._)  STELLA. I’m so excited I think I’ll play the piano in the other room.    (_Exit R. to drawing-room and immediately plays and sings   “Caressante.”_)    (_AUTOMATON enters D. in F., in black frock-coat, but now hatless,   goes to cupboard, paws at the door, goes and knocks over chair, then   to table up L. and takes up a tumbler, brings it down mechanically to   front C., half raises it, then lets it fall on the floor and sits by   table R., facing audience and says:_)  AUTOMATON. Tick-tick-Yow.    (_MRS. ANDERSON enters D. in F. with a black frock-coat in tailor’s   parcel, places it on table R. top end, then sees AUTOMATON and comes   out C., to speak._)  MRS. ANDERSON. Oh, he’s there, are he? (_Using handkerchief as she speaks._)  AUTOMATON. Yow.  MRS. ANDERSON. There’s a parcel from the tailoring folks with a message hopering as it were in time.  AUTOMATON. Yow-Yow. (_She starts a little._)  MRS. ANDERSON. The pore young lady is a-sittering in there.  AUTOMATON. Tick-tick. Yow-yow! (_Same business._)  MRS. ANDERSON. Ain’t you in good ’ealth, Mr. Everest, sir?  AUTOMATON. Yow-chuck, Yow-yow.    (_Rises and makes mechanical exit to bedroom L._)  MRS. ANDERSON (_watching him_). Pore-young-man!    (_Enter STELLA R._)  Mr. Everest have come back, mum; gone in his bedroom, mum; been to the pub.-house again, or I’m much mistook. Pore-young-man!    (_Exit D. in F._)  STELLA (_calls across_). Walter, here’s a parcel--Walter!    (_AUTOMATON enters door L., but does not come out, she sees him._)  Walter, why have you left Jack? Is anything wrong?  AUTOMATON. Yow! (_Turns and goes in again D.L._)  STELLA (_crossing to the door_). Walter! (_Door shuts._) How very polite of you! Are you changing? (_Voice off says, “Yow.”_) Oh, very well, if you won’t answer me. I’m in the drawing-room all alone!    (_Has crossed back to R., and goes in._)  AUTOMATON (_enters L._). Tick-chuck-yow. (_Goes up, hits door of cupboard twice._) Chuck-yow-yow.    (_Goes to recess, knocks over a chair, hits clock, etc., and goes   into china cupboard in recess L. A loud noise of smashing of crockery   off. STELLA through this is playing and singing same air as before._)    (_WALTER comes in D. in F., as soon as ever he can, walking quite   quietly as contrast to the very quick exit of AUTOMATON. Brown   jacket._)  WALTER (_comes to table R., calling_). Stella! I want you. Stella!  STELLA (_stops singing a moment to call_). I’m not coming! (_Resumes song off._)  WALTER (_takes up parcel_). My new coat at last. The moment I get Davidson under lock and key I’m going to change into this and get away to Brighton. (_Puts parcel down._)    (_STELLA enters R._)  Why wouldn’t you come a minute ago?  STELLA. Why did you shut that door in my face?  WALTER. When?  STELLA. After you went out.  WALTER. After I went out--before I came home? Did I speak?  STELLA. No.  WALTER. It’s as plain as a pikestaff, it’s come home!  STELLA (_slowly and firmly_). I believe you’re right. Now I’ve seen you both I’ll never mistake again.  WALTER. It must be somewhere on the premises now.    (_They hurriedly look about under furniture, and meet and collide up   C., and say, “Oh!” Noise in china cupboard._)  WALTER. It’s in the bedroom. Run down to Mrs. Anderson and borrow the very largest blanket.  STELLA. Why?  WALTER. I want something to throw over it.    (_STELLA exit D. in F._)  WALTER (_listens to fresh sounds_). No! It’s in the china cupboard!    (_A wooden hand with fingers extended is mysteriously thrust out of   china cupboard door. He gets a plate and smashes it on this hand,   which is at once withdrawn. This can be done with a real hand and   smash plate on door near it._)    (_He quickly turns key._)  WALTER. Got it--got it!    (_He jubilantly dances down C., then goes and calls out D. in F._)  Stella, Stella, I’ve locked it in the china cupboard. I don’t want the blanket. (_Returns._) Gone in the kitchen, I suppose! (_Takes up parcel._) Change my coat at last and get away! (_Goes into bedroom L._)    (_Immediately on his exit a loud smashing in china clipboard, then   the door flies into splinters and is knocked down, and AUTOMATON   enters quickly, hurries right round C., and into bedroom after   WALTER._)  WALTER (_within, as loud noise in bedroom_). Hi! stop!  AUTOMATON (_within_). Yow-yow.  WALTER (_rushing in, dressed in black coat_). By Jove! what an escape!    (_JACK, carrying blanket of green flannel or red, enters with STELLA,   who has gag and handcuffs--enter D. in F._)    (_WALTER makes signs to them, pointing to bedroom and beckoning them   to follow him there._)  JACK. Is that it?  STELLA. Yes, yes, Jack, yes!    (_JACK throws blanket over WALTER, and they get him on chair C._)  JACK. Hurrah! we’ve got him now! (_Business: secure him with rope round his legs and gag, then take blanket off._) (_WALTER, gagged, groans._) No more climbing tall chimney stacks! (_WALTER groans._)  STELLA. Is it in pain?  JACK. Of course not.  STELLA. It groans so!  JACK. Rather mad at being caught.  STELLA. Is it wax-work?  JACK. More like indiarubber. I suppose you do see the difference this time?  STELLA. Rather.  JACK. That’s not flesh and blood. (_Pulling its nose._)  STELLA. It seems to want to explain something.  JACK. It will never get the chance of that. (_Lighting a candle from mantel R._)  STELLA. Poor thing! are you tired of living? (_Groan._)  JACK. How can it answer you?  STELLA. I believe it could if you took the gag out of its mouth.  JACK. Hold the candle under its nose. (_Groan._)  STELLA. No, no, no! (_JACK puts candle on table._)  JACK (_with pin from waistcoat_). I want to see what it will do when I stick this pin in it. (_Groan._)  STELLA. No, no!  JACK. In its leg, you can nip its arms and legs. (_Does so--groan._)  STELLA. It doesn’t seem to like being nipped.  JACK. In the interests of science I’m going to bleed it. (_Loud groans._) Give me a carving knife. (_Groans._)    (_MRS. ANDERSON has entered and come down--sees WALTER, screams. They   start._)  MRS. ANDERSON. The gent I does for came down the other stair from the bedroom (_pointing L._) and is in the kitchen premises at this here identical period of time.  JACK. What! _Is_ he?  MRS. ANDERSON. Here have I been a-doing for two twins at the price of one.  JACK (_bustles MRS. ANDERSON to D. in F._). Send Mr. Everest up at once! (_Exit MRS. ANDERSON._)  JACK. Now to make an end of this fiend!    (_WALTER, who has been watching them as well as he could, now pretends   to be dead._)  Hullo! I don’t think I’ll want any instruments, it’s passing away! (_Business._) Not breathing! (_Looks at watch._) It’s eyes are closed. Oh! it’s run down. I believe we’d be quite safe to unbind it. Just help me with this rope. Let it pass away quietly on the sofa. There is something pathetic even in the death of a doll.    (_They unbind WALTER and raise him, he opens his eyes and bounds upon   JACK--commotion._)  Confound it, it’s living again!    (_STELLA runs in room R., JACK runs in room L._)  WALTER (_as JACK looks in L., and STELLA looks in R._). I say! (_They at once withdraw._) Jack! Stella! (_Heads appear again._) I say! Jack! (_Heads disappear._) Come out, you bounder! (_Heads appear._) Why are you making such idiots of yourselves?  JACK (_coming in_). Who are you?  WALTER. Walter Everest.  JACK. The other fellow said that.  WALTER. I _am_ the other fellow.  JACK. Then I’ve let the automaton escape!  WALTER. Escape?  JACK. _It_ must be in the kitchen now!  WALTER. I have a particularly heavy poker in my room, I’ll just fetch it.  JACK. And then?  WALTER. We’ll see what then! (_Has gone into bedroom L._)  JACK. This _is_ a nice muddle! What asses we’ve been!  STELLA. Yes, haven’t we?  JACK. By Jove! we have.    (_AUTOMATON comes in D. in F., followed by MRS. ANDERSON with a   telegram--they both go quickly into drawing-room R._)  MRS. ANDERSON (_calling as she goes_). Telegrapheram, Mr. Everest, sir!  STELLA (_down L. with JACK points up to them as they go out_). Jack! look!    (_Piano is smashed off R._)  Oh, what’s that?  JACK. That’s the piano! (_Glass is smashed off R._) That’s the three gold-fish in the bowl!    (_WALTER with poker enters L._)  MRS. ANDERSON (_off_). Oh, help! (_She rushes in from R. in a fainting condition and gasps._) Mr. Everest have fell out of the window into the street!  WALTER. Mrs. Anderson, I am here.    (_She gives a loud yell of fright in his face and rushes into bedroom   L. STELLA hastens after her._)  WALTER. There’s going to be no mistake this time, I’m going after it myself. (_Exit D. in F._)    (_JOBBINS enters D. in F., his hat bashed, a black eye, and one arm   in a sling. He is in a miserable condition._)  JACK. Great goodness! Jobbins!  JOBBINS. What’s left of him, sir!  AUTOMATON (_off at back_). Yow-yow.  JOBBINS (_on his knees clings to JACK_). I calls on you to protect me!  JACK. We must search this house from top to toe. You chase up, I’ll chase down. And if we don’t find him, meet here.  JOBBINS. I’ll do that (_they go up_), meet here!    (_Exeunt._)  STELLA (_looks in L._). Jack, she’s getting better--Jack! where are you? (_Goes in again._)    (_JOBBINS enters D. in F., comes down, saying:_)  JOBBINS. Missed him! (_Sits L. of R. table_). I’ll just"]]]
