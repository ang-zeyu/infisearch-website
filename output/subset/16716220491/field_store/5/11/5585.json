Flora's father was a wealthy cotton planter, and their Charleston home was in one of the historic mansions of that city. Beside that there was the big old house on the Ashley River ten miles from the city, where the family stayed a part of the time.  Flora's eyes were as blue as Sylvia's, and her hair was very much the same color. She was always smiling and friendly, and was better liked than Elinor Mayhew, who, as Flora said, was always ready to tease the younger girls.  \"I don't know what she meant,\" said Sylvia as, with Grace on one side and Flora on the other, they started toward home.  \"She is just hateful,\" declared Grace. \"I wish I had not asked Miss Rosalie about the forts. But I did want to know. It would be dreadful not to see them where they have always been.\"  \"Oh, Grace! You didn't think they were going to move the forts to Washington, did you?\" laughed Flora. \"I know better than that. Taking the forts means that the Government of the United States would own them instead of South Carolina.\"  Grace laughed good-naturedly. She was always as ready to laugh at her own mistakes as at those of others; and in the year that Sylvia had known her she had never seen Grace vexed or angry.  Both Grace and Flora advised Sylvia not to tell her mother of Elinor's unkindness, or of her taunting words. But it was rather difficult for Sylvia to keep a secret from her mother.  \"You see, it will make your mother sorry, and she will fret about it,\" Flora had said; and at this Sylvia had decided that no matter what happened at school she would not tell her mother about it. She almost dreaded seeing Elinor again, and wondered why Elinor's mother had not wanted Miss Patten to take her as a pupil.  Mr. and Mrs. Fulton were surprised when at supper time Sylvia demanded to know what a \"Yankee\" was. She thought her mother looked a little troubled. But her father smiled. \"Yankee is what Britishers call all Americans,\" he answered.  \"Then Elinor Mayhew is just as much a Yankee as I am,\" thought Sylvia, and she smiled so radiantly at the thought that Mrs. Fulton was reassured, and did not question her.  The next day was Saturday, and Mr. Fulton had planned to take his wife and Sylvia to Fort Moultrie. The military band of the fort played every afternoon, and the parapet of the fort was a daily promenade for many Charleston people. During the summer workmen had been making necessary repairs on the fortifications; but visitors were always welcomed by the officers in charge, one of whom, Captain Carleton, was a college friend of Sylvia's father.  Sylvia could row a small boat very well, and her father had purchased a pretty sailboat which he was teaching her to steer. She often went with her father on trips about the harbor, and the little girl always thought that these excursions were the most delightful of pleasures.  There was a favorable breeze this Saturday afternoon, and the little boat, with its shining white paint and snowy sail, skimmed swiftly across the harbor. Sylvia watched the little waves which seemed to dance forward to meet them, looked at the many boats and vessels, and quite forgot Elinor Mayhew's unkindness. Her mother and father were talking of the black servants, whom they had hired with the house of Mr. Robert Waite, Grace's uncle. Sylvia heard them speak of Aunt Connie, the good-natured black cook, who lived in a cabin behind the Fultons' kitchen.  \"Aunt Connie wants to bring her little girl to live with her. Their master is willing, if we have no objections,\" Sylvia heard her mother say.  \"Oh, let the child come,\" Mr. Fulton responded; \"how old is she?\"  \"Just Sylvia's age. Her name is Estralla,\" replied Mrs. Fulton.  \"You'll have a little darky for a playmate, Sylvia. How will you like that?\" her father asked. But before Sylvia could answer, the boat swung alongside the landing-place at the fort and she saw her father's friend, Captain Carleton, waiting to welcome them.  The band was playing, and a few people were on the parapet.  \"Not many visitors to-day,\" said the Captain, as they all walked on together. \"I am afraid the Charleston people resent the fact that the United States is protecting its property.\"  As they walked along the Captain pointed to the sand which the wind had blown into heaps about the sea-front of the old fort. \"A child of ten could easily come into the fort over those sand-banks,\" he said.  \"Whose fort is this?\" asked Sylvia, so earnestly that both the Captain and her father smiled.  \"It belongs to the United States, of which South Carolina is one,\" replied the Captain.  Sylvia gave a little sigh of satisfaction. Even Elinor Mayhew could not find any fault with that, she thought, and she was eager to get home and tell Grace what the Captain had said.  On the way back Sylvia asked her mother if she knew that there was a song with her name in it.  \"Why, of course, dear child. You were named for that very Sylvia,\" replied her mother.  \"'Then to Sylvia let us sing,     That Sylvia is excelling;   She excels each mortal thing     Upon the dull earth dwelling;   To her let us garlands bring'\"--  sang Mrs. Fulton; \"and you can thank your father for choosing your name,\" she added gaily.  \"Oh! But Grace said it was about spelling,\" explained Sylvia; \"but I like your way best,\" she added quickly.  There were a good many pleasant things for Sylvia to think of that night. Not every girl could be named out of a song, she reflected. Then there was the little colored girl Estralla, who was to arrive the next day, and besides these interesting facts, she had discovered who really owned the forts, and could tell her schoolmates on Monday. All these pleasant happenings made Sylvia forgetful of Elinor Mayhew's unkindness. Before bedtime she had learned the words of the song from which she was named. She knew Grace would think that \"excelling\" was much better than \"spelling.\"     CHAPTER II  A NEW FRIEND   The next morning Sylvia was awakened by a tapping on her chamber door. Usually Jennie, the colored girl who helped Aunt Connie in the work of the house, would come into the room before Sylvia was awake with a big pitcher of hot water, and Sylvia would open her eyes to see Jennie unfastening the shutters and spreading out the fresh clothes. So this morning she wondered what the tapping meant, and called out: \"Come in.\"  The door opened very slowly and a little negro girl, with a round woolly head and big startled eyes, stood peering in. She was barefooted, and wore a straight garment of faded blue cotton.  For a moment the two children stared at each other. Then Sylvia remembered that Aunt Connie's little girl was coming to live with her mother.  \"Are you Estralla?\" she asked eagerly, sitting up in bed.  \"Yas, Missy,\" replied the little darky, lifting the big pitcher of water and bringing it into the room, where she stood holding it as if not knowing what to do next.  \"Set the pitcher down,\" said Sylvia.  \"Yas, Missy,\" said Estralla, her big eyes fixed on the little white girl in the pretty bed who was smiling at her in so friendly a fashion. She took a step or two forward, her eyes still fixed on Sylvia, and not noticing the little footstool directly in front of her, over which she stumbled with a loud crash, breaking the pitcher and sending the hot water over her bare feet.  \"Oh, Mammy! Mammy! Mammy!\" she screamed, lying face downward on the floor with the overturned footstool and broken pitcher, while the steaming water soaked through the cotton dress.  In a moment Sylvia was out of bed.  \"Get up, Estralla,\" she commanded, \"and stop screaming.\"  The little darky's wails ceased, and she looked up at the slender white figure standing in front of her.  \"I kyan't git up; I'se all scalded and cut,\" she sobbed, \"an' if I does get up I'se gwine to get whipped for breaking the pitcher,\" and at the thought of new trouble in store for her, she began to scream again.  \"Get up this minute,\" said Sylvia. \"I don't believe the water was hot enough to scald you; it never is really hot. Here, help me sop it up,\" and grabbing her bath towel Sylvia began to mop up the little stream of water which was trickling across the floor.  Estralla managed to get to her feet. She was still holding fast to the handle of the broken pitcher. The front of her cotton dress was soaked, but she was not hurt.  \"I'll get whipped, yas'm, I will, fer breaking the pitcher.\"  \"You won't!\" declared Sylvia, half angrily. \"It's my mother's pitcher, and I'll tell her you didn't mean to break it. Now you go and put on another dress, and tell Jennie to come up here and wipe up this floor.\"  \"I ain't got no other dress; an' if I goes an' tells I'll get whipped,\" persisted the child.  Sylvia began to wonder what she could do. She thought Estralla was stupid and clumsy to fall down and break the pitcher, and now she thought her silly to be so frightened.  \"I tells you, Missy, I su'ly will be whipped,\" she repeated so earnestly that Sylvia began to believe it. \"An' when my mammy sees my dress all wet--\" and Estralla began to sob, but so quietly that Sylvia realized the little darky was really frightened and unhappy.  \"Don't cry, Estralla,\" she said more gently, patting her on the shoulder. \"I'll tell you what to do. You are just about my size, and I'll give you one of my dresses. It's pink, and it's faded a little, but it's pretty. And you take this towel and wipe up the floor as well as you can. Then you slip off your dress and put on mine.\" While Sylvia talked Estralla stopped crying and began to look a little more cheerful.  Sylvia ran to the closet and was back in a moment with a pink checked gingham. It had a number of tiny ruffles on the skirt, and a little frill of lace around the neck.  \"Landy! You don't mean I kin KEEP that, Missy?\" exclaimed Estralla, her face radiant at the very thought.  \"Yes, quick. Somebody may come. Slip off your dress.\"  In a moment the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5696"],["title","A Yankee Girl at Fort Sumter (#2)"],["body","blue frock lay in a little heap on the floor, and Sylvia had slipped the pink dress over Estralla's head, and was fastening it. The little darky chuckled and laughed now as if she had not a trouble in the world.  \"Listen, Estralla! Here, pick up every bit of the pitcher and put the pieces on the chair. Nobody shall know that you broke it. And now you take this wet towel and your dress and spread them somewhere outdoors to dry. You can tell your mammy I gave you the dress. Now, run quick. My mother may come.\"  Estralla stood quite still looking at Sylvia. She had stopped laughing.  \"Will you' mammy scold you 'bout dat pitcher?\" she asked.  \"I don't know. Anyway, nobody shall know that you broke it. You won't be whipped. Run along,\" urged Sylvia.  But Estralla did not move. \"I don't keer if I is whipped,\" she announced. \"I guess, mebbe, my mammy won't whip hard.\"  \"Sylvia, Sylvia,\" sounded her mother's voice, and both the little girls looked at each other with startled eyes.  \"Run,\" said Sylvia, giving Estralla a little push. \"Run out on the balcony.\" Estralla did not question the command, and in a moment, carrying dress and towel, she had vanished through the open window.  \"Why, child! What has happened?\" exclaimed Mrs. Fulton, coming into the room and looking at the overturned footstool, the pieces of the broken pitcher, and at Sylvia standing in the middle of the floor with an anxious, half-frightened expression.  \"Don't look so frightened, dear child. A broken pitcher isn't worth it,\" said Mrs. Fulton smilingly. \"It's only hot water, and won't hurt anything. Only Father is waiting for breakfast, so use cold water this morning. Here is your blue muslin--I'll tie your sash when you come down,\" and giving Sylvia a kiss her mother hurried away.  \"My landy!\" whispered Estralla, peering in from the balcony window. \"Your mammy's a angel. An' so is you, Missy. I was gwine tell her the trufe if she'd scolded, I su'ly was. Landy! I'd a sight ruther be whipped than have you scolded, Missy.\"  Sylvia looked at her in astonishment. Estralla, with round serious eyes, stood gazing at her as if she was ready to do anything that Sylvia could possibly ask.  \"Run. It's all right,\" said Sylvia with a little smile, and Estralla, with a backward look over her shoulder, went slowly out of the room.  \"I'm gwine to recollect this jes' as long as I live,\" Estralla whispered as she made her way back to the kitchen. \"Nobuddy ever cared if I was whipped before, or if I wasn't whipped. An' I'll do somethin' fer Missy sometime, I will. An' she give me dis fine dress too.\" She bent over and smoothed out one of the little ruffles, and chuckled happily.  Her mammy was busy preparing breakfast when Estralla slid quietly into the kitchen. When she did look around and saw the child wearing the pink dress she nearly dropped the dish of hot bacon which Jennie was waiting to take to the dining-room.  \"Wha' on earth did you get you' pink dress? Did Missy give it to you? Well, you step out to the cabin and take it off. This minute! Put you' blue frock right on. Like as not her mammy won't let you keep it,\" and Aunt Connie hurried Jennie off to the dining-room with the breakfast tray.  Estralla did not know what to do. Her blue dress was hung over a syringa bush behind the cabin. And at the dreadful thought that Mrs. Fulton might take away the pink dress she began to cry.  \"Missy Sylvia said 'twas faded. She said to put it on,\" whimpered Estralla.  Aunt Connie began to be more hopeful. If the dress was faded--and she turned and looked at it more closely.  \"Well, honey, 'tis faded. An' I guess Missy Sylvia's mammy won' take it back. An' it's the Sabbath day, so you jes' wear it,\" she said, patting the little woolly head. \"Mammy's glad to have you dressed up; but you be mighty keerful.\"  \"Yas, Mammy. I jes' love Missy Sylvia,\" replied the little girl, now all smiles, and forgetting how nearly she had come to serious trouble.  Nothing more was said to Sylvia about the broken pitcher; but when Jennie put the room in order, and brought down the broken pieces, Aunt Connie exclaimed: \"Good massy! It's a good thing my Estralla didn't do that! I'd 'a' cuffed her well, I su'ly would.\"  Sylvia did not think to tell her mother about the gift of the pink dress to Estralla. She did not feel quite happy that she had not explained the broken pitcher to her mother; but she had promised Estralla that she would not tell, and Sylvia knew that a promise was a very serious thing, something not to be easily forgotten.  She did not see Estralla again that day, and Jennie brought the hot water as usual the next morning.  Grace and Mammy Esther called for Sylvia on Monday morning, and Sylvia at once told her friend that she had been named from the song. This seemed very wonderful to Grace, and she listened to Sylvia's explanation of \"excelling\" instead of \"spelling,\" and said she didn't think it was of any consequence.  But when Sylvia told her what Captain Carleton had said about the forts, Grace shook her head and looked very serious.  \"Don't tell Elinor Mayhew, Sylvia. Because really South Carolina does own the forts. My father said so. He said that South Carolina was a Sovereign State,\" she concluded.  \"What's that? What's a 'sovereign'?\" questioned Sylvia.  Grace shook her head. It had sounded like a very fine thing when her father had spoken it, so she had repeated it with great pride.  \"We can ask Miss Rosalie,\" she suggested.  Mammy Esther left the girls at the gate of Miss Patten's garden. As they went up the path Flora Hayes came to meet them.  \"I was waiting for you,\" she said. \"I want to ask you both to come out to our plantation next Saturday and spend Sunday. My mother is going to write and ask your mothers if they will give me the pleasure of your company.\"  \"I am sure I can come,\" declared Grace, \"and I think it's lovely of you to ask me.\"  \"You'll come, won't you, Sylvia?\" said Flora, putting her arm over the little girl's shoulders as they went up the steps.  \"Yes, indeed; thank you very much for asking me,\" replied Sylvia. She had visited the Hayes plantation early in the summer, and thought it a more wonderful place even than the big mansion on Tradd Street where the Hayes family lived in the winter months. Mr. Hayes owned hundreds of negroes, and raised a great quantity of cotton. The house at the plantation was large, with many balconies, and cool, pleasant rooms. Flora had a pair of white ponies, and there were pigeons, and a number of dogs. Sylvia was sure that it would be a beautiful visit, especially as Grace would be there.  As she went smilingly toward her seat in the schoolroom she passed Elinor Mayhew, who was already seated.  \"Yankee!\" whispered Elinor sharply, looking at her with scornful eyes.  But Sylvia, remembering that her father had said that all Americans were Yankees, nodded to the older girl and responded: \"Yankee your-self!\"     CHAPTER III  SYLVIA IN TROUBLE   The Hayes plantation was about ten miles distant from Charleston, on the opposite side of the Ashley River. Flora told Sylvia and Grace that the Hayes coachman would drive them out, and that they would start early on Saturday morning. Sylvia, remembering her former visit, knew well how delightful the drive would be, and thinking of the pleasure in store quite forgot to be troubled by Elinor Mayhew's hostility.  At recess the girls usually walked about in the garden, or tossed a ball back and forth. Miss Rosalie would sit on the broad piazza overlooking the garden, her fingers busy with some piece of delicate embroidery.  To-day, as they filed out and down the steps, Elinor whispered to several of her companions. And suddenly Sylvia realized that she was standing alone. Grace Waite had lingered to speak to Miss Rosalie; Flora had been excused just before recess, as her black mammy had arrived with a note from Mrs. Hayes. The other girls were gathered in a little group about Elinor, who was evidently telling them something of great interest. Sylvia walked slowly along toward a little summer-house where Miss Patten sometimes had little tea-parties. She hoped Grace would not stay long with Miss Patten. The other girls were between Sylvia and the arbor, and none of them moved to let her pass; nor did any of them speak to her, as she paused with a word of greeting.  \"Now, girls,\" she heard Elinor say; and the others, half under their breath, but only too distinctly for Sylvia, called out: \"Yankee, Yankee!\" Then like a flock of bright-colored birds they ran swiftly into the summer-house.  For a moment Sylvia stood quite still. She realized that Elinor meant to be hateful; but she remembered that her father had said that all Americans were called \"Yankees,\" and she was not a coward. She went straight on to the arbor. Elinor Mayhew stood on the steps.  \"You are just as much a Yankee as I am. And you ought to be proud of it,\" declared Sylvia, facing the older girl.  \"Hear that, girls!\" called Elinor to the group about her. There was a little angry murmur from the others.  \"Don't you dare say that again, Miss Boston,\" called May Bailey, who stood next to Elinor.  Sylvia was now thoroughly angry. She knew of no reason why these girls should treat her in so unkind a fashion. She felt very desolate and unhappy, but she faced them bravely.  \"Yankees! Yankees! It's what all Americans are,\" she declared defiantly.  In an instant the little girls were all about her. Elinor Mayhew was holding her hands, and the others were pushing her along the path to the shore. The thick growing shrubs hid them from the house. Sylvia did not cry out or speak. She was not at all afraid, nor did she resist.  \"We ought to make her take it back,\" said May Bailey, as Elinor stopped, and they all stood in a close group about Sylvia.  \"Of course she's got to take it back, and apologize on her knees,\" declared Elinor. \"She might as well learn that South Carolinians will not be insulted,\" and Elinor lifted her head"]]]
