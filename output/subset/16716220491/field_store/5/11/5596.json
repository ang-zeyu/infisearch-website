The tailor crossed the kitchen, and stood quite still beside the dresser, listening, and peering through his spectacles.  \"This is very peculiar,\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and he lifted up the tea-cup which was upside down.   Out stepped a little live lady mouse, and made a courtesy to the tailor! Then she hopped away down off the dresser, and under the wainscot.  The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands. But all at once, from the dresser, there came other little noises--  Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!  \"This is passing extraordinary!\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and turned over another tea-cup, which was upside down.  Out stepped a little gentleman mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!  And out from under tea-cups and from under bowls and basins, stepped other and more little mice, who hopped away down off the dresser and under the wainscot.   The tailor sat down, close over the fire, lamenting: \"One-and-twenty buttonholes of cherry-coloured silk! To be finished by noon of Saturday: and this is Tuesday evening. Was it right to let loose those mice, undoubtedly the property of Simpkin? Alack, I am undone, for I have no more twist!\"  The little mice came out again and listened to the tailor; they took notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat. They whispered to one another about the taffeta lining and about little mouse tippets.  And then suddenly they all ran away together down the passage behind the wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another as they ran from house to house.  Not one mouse was left in the tailor's kitchen when Simpkin came back. He set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked suspiciously at the tea-cups. He wanted his supper of little fat mouse!  \"Simpkin,\" said the tailor, \"where is my TWIST?\"   But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have asked: \"Where is my MOUSE?\"  \"Alack, I am undone!\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to bed.  All that night long Simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen, peeping into cupboards and under the wainscot, and into the tea-pot where he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse!  The poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled: \"No more twist! no more twist!\"  What should become of the cherry- coloured coat? Who should come to sew it, when the window was barred, and the door was fast locked?   Out-of-doors the market folks went trudging through the snow to buy their geese and turkeys, and to bake their Christmas pies; but there would be no dinner for Simpkin and the poor old tailor of Gloucester.  The tailor lay ill for three days and nights; and then it was Christmas Eve, and very late at night. And still Simpkin wanted his mice, and mewed as he stood beside the four-post bed.  But it is in the old story that all the beasts can talk in the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the morning (though there are very few folk that can hear them, or know what it is that they say).  When the Cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer--like an echo of the chimes--and Simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door, and wandered about in the snow.   From all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes--all the old songs that ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's bells.  Under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies; the jackdaws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the middle of the night the throstles and robins sang; and air was quite full of little twittering tunes.  But it was all rather provoking to poor hungry Simpkin.  From the tailor's ship in Westgate came a glow of light; and when Simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles. There was a snippeting of scissors, and snappeting of thread; and little mouse voices sang loudly and gaily:            \"Four-and-twenty tailors           Went to catch a snail,           The best man amongst them           Durst not touch her tail;           She put out her horns           Like a little kyloe cow.           Run, tailors, run!           Or she'll have you all e'en now!\"   Then without a pause the little mouse voices went on again:            \"Sieve my lady's oatmeal,           Grind my lady's flour,           Put it in a chestnut,           Let it stand an hour--\"   \"Mew! Mew!\" interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door. But the key was under the tailor's pillow; he could not get in.  The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune--            \"Three little mice sat down to spin,           Pussy passed by and she peeped in.           What are you at, my fine little men?           Making coats for gentlemen.           Shall I come in and cut off yours threads?           Oh, no, Miss Pussy,           You'd bite off our heads!\"    \"Mew! scratch! scratch!\" scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout all at once in little twittering voices: \"No more twist! No more twist!\" And they barred up the window-shutters and shut out Simpkin.  Simpkin came away from the shop and went home considering in his mind. He found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.  Then Simpkin went on tip-toe and took a little parcel of silk out of the tea-pot; and looked at it in the moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed of his badness compared with those good little mice!  When the tailor awoke in the morning, the first thing which he saw, upon the patchwork quilt, was a skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk, and beside his bed stood the repentant Simpkin!   The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with Simpkin running before him.  \"Alack,\" said the tailor, \"I have my twist; but no more strength--nor time--than will serve to make me one single buttonhole; for this is Christmas Day in the Morning! The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by noon--and where is his cherry- coloured coat?\"  He unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin ran in, like a cat that expects something.  But there was no one there! Not even one little brown mouse!  But upon the table--oh joy! the tailor gave a shout--there, where he had left plain cuttings of silk--there lay the most beautiful coat and embroidered satin waistcoat that ever were worn by a Mayor of Gloucester!   Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured buttonhole, and where that buttonhole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these words--in little teeny weeny writing--            NO MORE TWIST.   And from then began the luck of the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite stout, and he grew quite rich.  He made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of Gloucester, and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round.  Never were seen such ruffles, or such embroidered cuffs and lappets! But his buttonholes were the greatest triumph of it all.  The stitches of those buttonholes were so neat--SO neat--I wonder how they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old fingers, and a tailor's thimble.  The stitches of those buttonholes were so small--SO small--they looked as if they had been made by little mice!     THE TALE OF SQUIRREL NUTKIN  [A Story for Norah]     This is a Tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.  He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.  In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown.  One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green-- Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.  They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts.   Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.  They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.  Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--  \"Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?\"  But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. He bobbed up and down like a little red CHERRY, singing--       \"Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!      A little wee man, in a red red coat!      A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;      If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat.\"   Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin.  He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.   The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.  But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--  \"Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?\"  But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--            \"Old Mr. B! Riddle-me-ree!           Hitty Pitty within the wall,           Hitty Pitty without the wall;           If you touch Hitty Pitty,           Hitty Pitty will bite you!\"   Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.   He shut the door in Nutkin's face. Presently a little thread of blue SMOKE from a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/572"],["title","The Great Big Treasury of Beatrix Potter (#2)"],["body","fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--            \"A house full, a hole full!           And you cannot gather a bowl-full!\"   The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.  But Nutkin gathered oak-apples-- yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.  On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.  They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.   Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. He ran in front, singing--       \"The man in the wilderness said to me,      `How may strawberries grow in the sea?'      I answered him as I thought good--      `As many red herrings as grow in the wood.\"'   But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.  On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in PLUM-PUDDING for Old Brown. Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle- pin.  But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever--       \"Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree!      Flour of England, fruit of Spain,      Met together in a shower of rain;      Put in a bag tied round with a string,      If you'll tell me this riddle,      I'll give you a ring!\"   Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.  The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pin-cushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle-pins.   On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. They had stolen it out of a bumble BEES' nest on the tippity top of the hill.  But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing--       \"Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!           As I went over Tipple-tine           I met a flock of bonny swine;      Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!           They were the very bonniest swine           That e'er went over the Tipple-tine.\"   Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.  But he ate up the honey!  The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.  But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.   On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid EGG in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.  But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--       \"Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,      With a white counterpane round his neck,      Forty doctors and forty wrights,      Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!\"   Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. But still he did not speak.  Nutkin became more and more impertinent--       \"Old Mr. B! Old Mr. B!      Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's           kitchen door;      All the King's horses, and all the King's men,      Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore,      Off the King's kitchen door!\"   Nutkin danced up and down like a SUNBEAM; but still Old Brown said nothing at all.  Nutkin began again--       \"Authur O'Bower has broken his band,      He comes roaring up the land!      The King of Scots with all his power,      Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!\"   Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the WIND, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown! . . .  Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud \"Squeak!\"  The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.  When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.   * * * * * * * *  BUT NUTKIN WAS IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET!  This looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.   Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase, and escaped out of the attic window.  And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--  \"Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k!\"     THE TALE OF BENJAMIN BUNNY   [For the Children of Sawrey from Old Mr. Bunny]     One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.  He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.  A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.  As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.  That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.  Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).   Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.  He came round the back of the fir- tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.  Peter was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.  \"Peter,\" said little Benjamin, in a whisper, \"who has got your clothes?\"  Peter replied, \"The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,\" and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.  Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.   Peter said he hoped that it would rain.  At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: \"Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!\"  Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.  They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden. Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.  Little Benjamin said: \"It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.\"  Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.  It had been sown with lettuces.  They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.  Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket- handkerchief.  They took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.  Benjamin tried on the tam-o'- shanter, but it was too big for him.  Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt.  Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.   Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.  (The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)  The lettuces certainly were very fine.  Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently he dropped half the onions.  Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.   The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.  Presently Peter let the pocket- handkerchief go again.  They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!  He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.  This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!  Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket. . . .   The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.  Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!  Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.  She sat there for FIVE HOURS.  I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.  The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.  At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.  The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.  He was smoking a pipe of rabbit- tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.  He was looking for his son.   Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats. He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.  The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.  When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.  Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by"]]]
