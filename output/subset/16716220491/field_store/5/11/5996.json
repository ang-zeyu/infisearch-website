(#2)"],["body",", even unto this day, the head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the King's Majesty, without let or hindrance, and this none other may do. {3} Invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer, I beseech the King to grant to me but this one grace and privilege--to my more than sufficient reward--and none other, to wit:  that I and my heirs, for ever, may SIT in the presence of the Majesty of England!\"  \"Rise, Sir Miles Hendon, Knight,\" said the King, gravely--giving the accolade with Hendon's sword--\"rise, and seat thyself.  Thy petition is granted.  Whilst England remains, and the crown continues, the privilege shall not lapse.\"  His Majesty walked apart, musing, and Hendon dropped into a chair at table, observing to himself, \"'Twas a brave thought, and hath wrought me a mighty deliverance; my legs are grievously wearied. An I had not thought of that, I must have had to stand for weeks, till my poor lad's wits are cured.\"  After a little, he went on, \"And so I am become a knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows! A most odd and strange position, truly, for one so matter-of-fact as I.  I will not laugh--no, God forbid, for this thing which is so substanceless to me is REAL to him.  And to me, also, in one way, it is not a falsity, for it reflects with truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him.\"  After a pause: \"Ah, what if he should call me by my fine title before folk!--there'd be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and my raiment!  But no matter, let him call me what he will, so it please him; I shall be content.\"    Chapter XIII. The disappearance of the Prince.  A heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades.  The King said--  \"Remove these rags\"--meaning his clothing.  Hendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark, tucked him up in bed, then glanced about the room, saying to himself, ruefully, \"He hath taken my bed again, as before--marry, what shall _I_ do?\"  The little King observed his perplexity, and dissipated it with a word.  He said, sleepily--  \"Thou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard it.\"  In a moment more he was out of his troubles, in a deep slumber.  \"Dear heart, he should have been born a king!\" muttered Hendon, admiringly; \"he playeth the part to a marvel.\"  Then he stretched himself across the door, on the floor, saying contentedly--  \"I have lodged worse for seven years; 'twould be but ill gratitude to Him above to find fault with this.\"  He dropped asleep as the dawn appeared.  Toward noon he rose, uncovered his unconscious ward--a section at a time--and took his measure with a string.  The King awoke, just as he had completed his work, complained of the cold, and asked what he was doing.  \"'Tis done, now, my liege,\" said Hendon; \"I have a bit of business outside, but will presently return; sleep thou again--thou needest it. There--let me cover thy head also--thou'lt be warm the sooner.\"  The King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended. Miles slipped softly out, and slipped as softly in again, in the course of thirty or forty minutes, with a complete second-hand suit of boy's clothing, of cheap material, and showing signs of wear; but tidy, and suited to the season of the year.  He seated himself, and began to overhaul his purchase, mumbling to himself--  \"A longer purse would have got a better sort, but when one has not the long purse one must be content with what a short one may do--  \"'There was a woman in our town, In our town did dwell--'  \"He stirred, methinks--I must sing in a less thunderous key; 'tis not good to mar his sleep, with this journey before him, and he so wearied out, poor chap . . . This garment--'tis well enough--a stitch here and another one there will set it aright.  This other is better, albeit a stitch or two will not come amiss in it, likewise . . . THESE be very good and sound, and will keep his small feet warm and dry--an odd new thing to him, belike, since he has doubtless been used to foot it bare, winters and summers the same . . . Would thread were bread, seeing one getteth a year's sufficiency for a farthing, and such a brave big needle without cost, for mere love.  Now shall I have the demon's own time to thread it!\"  And so he had.  He did as men have always done, and probably always will do, to the end of time--held the needle still, and tried to thrust the thread through the eye, which is the opposite of a woman's way.  Time and time again the thread missed the mark, going sometimes on one side of the needle, sometimes on the other, sometimes doubling up against the shaft; but he was patient, having been through these experiences before, when he was soldiering.  He succeeded at last, and took up the garment that had lain waiting, meantime, across his lap, and began his work.  \"The inn is paid--the breakfast that is to come, included--and there is wherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our little costs for the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty that awaits us at Hendon Hall--  \"'She loved her hus--'  \"Body o' me!  I have driven the needle under my nail! . . . It matters little--'tis not a novelty--yet 'tis not a convenience, neither . . .We shall be merry there, little one, never doubt it! Thy troubles will vanish there, and likewise thy sad distemper--  \"'She loved her husband dearilee, But another man--'  \"These be noble large stitches!\"--holding the garment up and viewing it admiringly--\"they have a grandeur and a majesty that do cause these small stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mightily paltry and plebeian--  \"'She loved her husband dearilee, But another man he loved she,--'  \"Marry, 'tis done--a goodly piece of work, too, and wrought with expedition.  Now will I wake him, apparel him, pour for him, feed him, and then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard Inn in Southwark and --be pleased to rise, my liege!--he answereth not--what ho, my liege!--of a truth must I profane his sacred person with a touch, sith his slumber is deaf to speech.  What!\"  He threw back the covers--the boy was gone!  He stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment; noticed for the first time that his ward's ragged raiment was also missing; then he began to rage and storm and shout for the innkeeper.  At that moment a servant entered with the breakfast.  \"Explain, thou limb of Satan, or thy time is come!\" roared the man of war, and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter could not find his tongue, for the instant, for fright and surprise.  \"Where is the boy?\"  In disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the information desired.  \"You were hardly gone from the place, your worship, when a youth came running and said it was your worship's will that the boy come to you straight, at the bridge-end on the Southwark side.  I brought him hither; and when he woke the lad and gave his message, the lad did grumble some little for being disturbed 'so early,' as he called it, but straightway trussed on his rags and went with the youth, only saying it had been better manners that your worship came yourself, not sent a stranger--and so--\"  \"And so thou'rt a fool!--a fool and easily cozened--hang all thy breed! Yet mayhap no hurt is done.  Possibly no harm is meant the boy.  I will go fetch him.  Make the table ready.  Stay! the coverings of the bed were disposed as if one lay beneath them--happened that by accident?\"  \"I know not, good your worship.  I saw the youth meddle with them--he that came for the boy.\"  \"Thousand deaths!  'Twas done to deceive me--'tis plain 'twas done to gain time.  Hark ye!  Was that youth alone?\"  \"All alone, your worship.\"  \"Art sure?\"  \"Sure, your worship.\"  \"Collect thy scattered wits--bethink thee--take time, man.\"  After a moment's thought, the servant said--  \"When he came, none came with him; but now I remember me that as the two stepped into the throng of the Bridge, a ruffian-looking man plunged out from some near place; and just as he was joining them--\"  \"What THEN?--out with it!\" thundered the impatient Hendon, interrupting.  \"Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in, and I saw no more, being called by my master, who was in a rage because a joint that the scrivener had ordered was forgot, though I take all the saints to witness that to blame ME for that miscarriage were like holding the unborn babe to judgment for sins com--\"  \"Out of my sight, idiot!  Thy prating drives me mad!  Hold! Whither art flying?  Canst not bide still an instant?  Went they toward Southwark?\"  \"Even so, your worship--for, as I said before, as to that detestable joint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than--\"  \"Art here YET!  And prating still!  Vanish, lest I throttle thee!\" The servitor vanished.  Hendon followed after him, passed him, and plunged down the stairs two steps at a stride, muttering, \"'Tis that scurvy villain that claimed he was his son.  I have lost thee, my poor little mad master--it is a bitter thought--and I had come to love thee so!  No! by book and bell, NOT lost!  Not lost, for I will ransack the land till I find thee again.  Poor child, yonder is his breakfast--and mine, but I have no hunger now; so, let the rats have it--speed, speed! that is the word!\"  As he wormed his swift way through the noisy multitudes upon the Bridge he several times said to himself--clinging to the thought as if it were a particularly pleasing one--\"He grumbled, but he WENT--he went, yes, because he thought Miles Hendon asked it, sweet lad--he would ne'er have done it for another, I know it well.\"    Chapter XIV. 'Le Roi est mort--vive le Roi.'  Toward daylight of the same morning, Tom Canty stirred out of a heavy sleep and opened his eyes in the dark.  He lay silent a few moments, trying to analyse his confused thoughts and impressions, and get some sort of meaning out of them; then suddenly he burst out in a rapturous but guarded voice--  \"I see it all, I see it all!  Now God be thanked, I am indeed awake at last!  Come,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7158"],["title","The Prince and the Pauper, Part 5. (#1)"],["body","his eyes with his hands to shut out the picture.  \"I beseech your good lordship that order be taken to change this law--oh, let no more poor creatures be visited with its tortures.\"  The Earl's face showed profound gratification, for he was a man of merciful and generous impulses--a thing not very common with his class in that fierce age.  He said--  \"These your Grace's noble words have sealed its doom.  History will remember it to the honour of your royal house.\"  The under-sheriff was about to remove his prisoner; Tom gave him a sign to wait; then he said--  \"Good sir, I would look into this matter further.  The man has said his deed was but lamely proved.  Tell me what thou knowest.\"  \"If the King's grace please, it did appear upon the trial that this man entered into a house in the hamlet of Islington where one lay sick--three witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the morning, and two say it was some minutes later--the sick man being alone at the time, and sleeping--and presently the man came forth again and went his way.  The sick man died within the hour, being torn with spasms and retchings.\"  \"Did any see the poison given?  Was poison found?\"  \"Marry, no, my liege.\"  \"Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?\"  \"Please your Majesty, the doctors testified that none die with such symptoms but by poison.\"  Weighty evidence, this, in that simple age.  Tom recognised its formidable nature, and said--  \"The doctor knoweth his trade--belike they were right.  The matter hath an ill-look for this poor man.\"  \"Yet was not this all, your Majesty; there is more and worse. Many testified that a witch, since gone from the village, none know whither, did foretell, and speak it privately in their ears, that the sick man WOULD DIE BY POISON--and more, that a stranger would give it--a stranger with brown hair and clothed in a worn and common garb; and surely this prisoner doth answer woundily to the bill.  Please your Majesty to give the circumstance that solemn weight which is its due, seeing it was FORETOLD.\"  This was an argument of tremendous force in that superstitious day.  Tom felt that the thing was settled; if evidence was worth anything, this poor fellow's guilt was proved.  Still he offered the prisoner a chance, saying--  \"If thou canst say aught in thy behalf, speak.\"  \"Nought that will avail, my King.  I am innocent, yet cannot I make it appear.  I have no friends, else might I show that I was not in Islington that day; so also might I show that at that hour they name I was above a league away, seeing I was at Wapping Old Stairs; yea more, my King, for I could show, that whilst they say I was TAKING life, I was SAVING it.  A drowning boy--\"  \"Peace!  Sheriff, name the day the deed was done!\"  \"At ten in the morning, or some minutes later, the first day of the New Year, most illustrious--\"  \"Let the prisoner go free--it is the King's will!\"  Another blush followed this unregal outburst, and he covered his indecorum as well as he could by adding--  \"It enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle, hare-brained evidence!\"  A low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage.  It was not admiration of the decree that had been delivered by Tom, for the propriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner was a thing which few there would have felt justified in either admitting or admiring--no, the admiration was for the intelligence and spirit which Tom had displayed.  Some of the low-voiced remarks were to this effect--  \"This is no mad king--he hath his wits sound.\"  \"How sanely he put his questions--how like his former natural self was this abrupt imperious disposal of the matter!\"  \"God be thanked, his infirmity is spent!  This is no weakling, but a king.  He hath borne himself like to his own father.\"  The air being filled with applause, Tom's ear necessarily caught a little of it.  The effect which this had upon him was to put him greatly at his ease, and also to charge his system with very gratifying sensations.  However, his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these pleasant thoughts and feelings; he was eager to know what sort of deadly mischief the woman and the little girl could have been about; so, by his command, the two terrified and sobbing creatures were brought before him.  \"What is it that these have done?\" he inquired of the sheriff.  \"Please your Majesty, a black crime is charged upon them, and clearly proven; wherefore the judges have decreed, according to the law, that they be hanged.  They sold themselves to the devil--such is their crime.\"  Tom shuddered.  He had been taught to abhor people who did this wicked thing.  Still, he was not going to deny himself the pleasure of feeding his curiosity for all that; so he asked--  \"Where was this done?--and when?\"  \"On a midnight in December, in a ruined church, your Majesty.\"  Tom shuddered again.  \"Who was there present?\"  \"Only these two, your grace--and THAT OTHER.\"  \"Have these confessed?\"  \"Nay, not so, sire--they do deny it.\"  \"Then prithee, how was it known?\"  \"Certain witness did see them wending thither, good your Majesty; this bred the suspicion, and dire effects have since confirmed and justified it.  In particular, it is in evidence that through the wicked power so obtained, they did invoke and bring about a storm that wasted all the region round about.  Above forty witnesses have proved the storm; and sooth one might have had a thousand, for all had reason to remember it, sith all had suffered by it.\"  \"Certes this is a serious matter.\"  Tom turned this dark piece of scoundrelism over in his mind a while, then asked--  \"Suffered the woman also by the storm?\"  Several old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition of the wisdom of this question.  The sheriff, however, saw nothing consequential in the inquiry; he answered, with simple directness--  \"Indeed did she, your Majesty, and most righteously, as all aver. Her habitation was swept away, and herself and child left shelterless.\"  \"Methinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly bought. She had been cheated, had she paid but a farthing for it; that she paid her soul, and her child's, argueth that she is mad; if she is mad she knoweth not what she doth, therefore sinneth not.\"  The elderly heads nodded recognition of Tom's wisdom once more, and one individual murmured, \"An' the King be mad himself, according to report, then is it a madness of a sort that would improve the sanity of some I wot of, if by the gentle providence of God they could but catch it.\"  \"What age hath the child?\" asked Tom.  \"Nine years, please your Majesty.\"  \"By the law of England may a child enter into covenant and sell itself, my lord?\" asked Tom, turning to a learned judge.  \"The law doth not permit a child to make or meddle in any weighty matter, good my liege, holding that its callow wit unfitteth it to cope with the riper wit and evil schemings of them that are its elders.  The DEVIL may buy a child, if he so choose, and the child agree thereto, but not an Englishman--in this latter case the contract would be null and void.\"  \"It seemeth a rude unchristian thing, and ill contrived, that English law denieth privileges to Englishmen to waste them on the devil!\" cried Tom, with honest heat.  This novel view of the matter excited many smiles, and was stored away in many heads to be repeated about the Court as evidence of Tom's originality as well as progress toward mental health.  The elder culprit had ceased from sobbing, and was hanging upon Tom's words with an excited interest and a growing hope.  Tom noticed this, and it strongly inclined his sympathies toward her in her perilous and unfriended situation.  Presently he asked--  \"How wrought they to bring the storm?\"  \"BY PULLING OFF THEIR STOCKINGS, sire.\"  This astonished Tom, and also fired his curiosity to fever heat. He said, eagerly--  \"It is wonderful!  Hath it always this dread effect?\"  \"Always, my liege--at least if the woman desire it, and utter the needful words, either in her mind or with her tongue.\"  Tom turned to the woman, and said with impetuous zeal--  \"Exert thy power--I would see a storm!\"  There was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage, and a general, though unexpressed, desire to get out of the place--all of which was lost upon Tom, who was dead to everything but the proposed cataclysm.  Seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the woman's face, he added, excitedly--  \"Never fear--thou shalt be blameless.  More--thou shalt go free--none shall touch thee.  Exert thy power.\"  \"Oh, my lord the King, I have it not--I have been falsely accused.\"  \"Thy fears stay thee.  Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer no harm.  Make a storm--it mattereth not how small a one--I require nought great or harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite--do this and thy life is spared --thou shalt go out free, with thy child, bearing the King's pardon, and safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm.\"  The woman prostrated herself, and protested, with tears, that she had no power to do the miracle, else she would gladly win her child's life alone, and be content to lose her own, if by obedience to the King's command so precious a grace might be acquired.  Tom urged--the woman still adhered to her declarations.  Finally he said--  \"I think the woman hath said true.  An' MY mother were in her place and gifted with the devil's functions, she had not stayed a moment to call her storms and lay the whole land in ruins, if the saving of my forfeit life were the price she got!  It is argument that other mothers are made in like mould.  Thou art free, goodwife--thou and thy child--for I do think thee innocent.  NOW thou'st nought to fear, being pardoned--pull off thy stockings!--an' thou canst make me a storm, thou shalt be rich!\"  The redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude, and proceeded to obey, whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little marred by apprehension; the"]]]
