(#2)"],["body"," with goodly beatings.\"  A fierce look came into the little prince's eyes, and he cried out--  \"What!  Beatings?\"  \"Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir.\"  \"BEATINGS!--and thou so frail and little.  Hark ye:  before the night come, she shall hie her to the Tower.  The King my father\"--  \"In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree.  The Tower is for the great alone.\"  \"True, indeed.  I had not thought of that.  I will consider of her punishment.  Is thy father kind to thee?\"  \"Not more than Gammer Canty, sir.\"  \"Fathers be alike, mayhap.  Mine hath not a doll's temper.  He smiteth with a heavy hand, yet spareth me:  he spareth me not always with his tongue, though, sooth to say.  How doth thy mother use thee?\"  \"She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort. And Nan and Bet are like to her in this.\"  \"How old be these?\"  \"Fifteen, an' it please you, sir.\"  \"The Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey, my cousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious withal; but my sister the Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and--Look you:  do thy sisters forbid their servants to smile, lest the sin destroy their souls?\"  \"They?  Oh, dost think, sir, that THEY have servants?\"  The little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then said--  \"And prithee, why not?  Who helpeth them undress at night?  Who attireth them when they rise?\"  \"None, sir.  Would'st have them take off their garment, and sleep without--like the beasts?\"  \"Their garment!  Have they but one?\"  \"Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more?  Truly they have not two bodies each.\"  \"It is a quaint and marvellous thought!  Thy pardon, I had not meant to laugh.  But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys enow, and that soon, too:  my cofferer shall look to it.  No, thank me not; 'tis nothing.  Thou speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it.  Art learned?\"  \"I know not if I am or not, sir.  The good priest that is called Father Andrew taught me, of his kindness, from his books.\"  \"Know'st thou the Latin?\"  \"But scantly, sir, I doubt.\"  \"Learn it, lad:  'tis hard only at first.  The Greek is harder; but neither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the Lady Elizabeth and my cousin.  Thou should'st hear those damsels at it!  But tell me of thy Offal Court.  Hast thou a pleasant life there?\"  \"In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry. There be Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys--oh such antic creatures! and so bravely dressed!--and there be plays wherein they that play do shout and fight till all are slain, and 'tis so fine to see, and costeth but a farthing--albeit 'tis main hard to get the farthing, please your worship.\"  \"Tell me more.\"  \"We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel, like to the fashion of the 'prentices, sometimes.\"  The prince's eyes flashed.  Said he--  \"Marry, that would not I mislike.  Tell me more.\"  \"We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest.\"  \"That would I like also.  Speak on.\"  \"In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and each doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with water, and dive and shout and tumble and--\"  \"'Twould be worth my father's kingdom but to enjoy it once! Prithee go on.\"  \"We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand, each covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud pastry--oh the lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the world!--we do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship's presence.\"  \"Oh, prithee, say no more, 'tis glorious!  If that I could but clothe me in raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel in the mud once, just once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego the crown!\"  \"And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad--just once--\"  \"Oho, would'st like it?  Then so shall it be.  Doff thy rags, and don these splendours, lad!  It is a brief happiness, but will be not less keen for that.  We will have it while we may, and change again before any come to molest.\"  A few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom's fluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked out in the gaudy plumage of royalty.  The two went and stood side by side before a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to have been any change made!  They stared at each other, then at the glass, then at each other again.  At last the puzzled princeling said--  \"What dost thou make of this?\"  \"Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer.  It is not meet that one of my degree should utter the thing.\"  \"Then will _I_ utter it.  Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the same voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same face and countenance that I bear.  Fared we forth naked, there is none could say which was you, and which the Prince of Wales.  And, now that I am clothed as thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more nearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier--Hark ye, is not this a bruise upon your hand?\"  \"Yes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor man-at-arms--\"  \"Peace!  It was a shameful thing and a cruel!\" cried the little prince, stamping his bare foot.  \"If the King--Stir not a step till I come again! It is a command!\"  In a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national importance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door and flying through the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and glowing eyes.  As soon as he reached the great gate, he seized the bars, and tried to shake them, shouting--  \"Open!  Unbar the gates!\"  The soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince burst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath, the soldier fetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the roadway, and said--  \"Take that, thou beggar's spawn, for what thou got'st me from his Highness!\"  The crowd roared with laughter.  The prince picked himself out of the mud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting--  \"I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for laying thy hand upon me!\"  The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly--  \"I salute your gracious Highness.\"  Then angrily--\"Be off, thou crazy rubbish!\"  Here the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and hustled him far down the road, hooting him, and shouting--  \"Way for his Royal Highness!  Way for the Prince of Wales!\"    Chapter IV. The Prince's troubles begin.  After hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince was at last deserted by the rabble and left to himself.  As long as he had been able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and royally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very entertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was no longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere. He looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality.  He was within the city of London--that was all he knew.  He moved on, aimlessly, and in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by were infrequent.  He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed then where Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed on, and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered houses in it, and a prodigious church.  He recognised this church.  Scaffoldings were about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was undergoing elaborate repairs.  The prince took heart at once--he felt that his troubles were at an end, now.  He said to himself, \"It is the ancient Grey Friars' Church, which the king my father hath taken from the monks and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children, and new-named it Christ's Church.  Right gladly will they serve the son of him who hath done so generously by them--and the more that that son is himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this day, or ever shall be.\"  He was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping, playing at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and right noisily, too.  They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion which in that day prevailed among serving-men and 'prentices{1}--that is to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the size of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such scanty dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair fell, unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight around; a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely and hung as low as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt; bright yellow stockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large metal buckles. It was a sufficiently ugly costume.  The boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with native dignity--  \"Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth speech with him.\"  A great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said--  \"Marry, art thou his grace's messenger, beggar?\"  The prince's face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his hip, but there was nothing there.  There was a storm of laughter, and one boy said--  \"Didst mark that?  He fancied he had a sword--belike he is the prince himself.\"  This sally brought more laughter.  Poor Edward drew himself up proudly and said--  \"I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my father's bounty to use me so.\"  This was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified.  The youth who had first spoken, shouted to his comrades--  \"Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace's princely father, where be your manners?  Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence to his kingly port and royal rags!\"  With boisterous mirth"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7155"],["title","The Prince and the Pauper, Part 2. (#1)"],["body","him in wholesome ways, so that his health come again.\"  He raised himself higher still, and went on with energy, \"He is mad; but he is my son, and England's heir; and, mad or sane, still shall he reign!  And hear ye further, and proclaim it: whoso speaketh of this his distemper worketh against the peace and order of these realms, and shall to the gallows! . . . Give me to drink--I burn:  this sorrow sappeth my strength. . . . There, take away the cup. . . . Support me.  There, that is well.  Mad, is he?  Were he a thousand times mad, yet is he Prince of Wales, and I the King will confirm it.  This very morrow shall he be installed in his princely dignity in due and ancient form.  Take instant order for it, my lord Hertford.\"  One of the nobles knelt at the royal couch, and said--  \"The King's majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of England lieth attainted in the Tower.  It were not meet that one attainted--\"  \"Peace!  Insult not mine ears with his hated name.  Is this man to live for ever?  Am I to be baulked of my will?  Is the prince to tarry uninstalled, because, forsooth, the realm lacketh an Earl Marshal free of treasonable taint to invest him with his honours? No, by the splendour of God!  Warn my Parliament to bring me Norfolk's doom before the sun rise again, else shall they answer for it grievously!\" {1}  Lord Hertford said--  \"The King's will is law;\" and, rising, returned to his former place.  Gradually the wrath faded out of the old King's face, and he said--  \"Kiss me, my prince.  There . . . what fearest thou?  Am I not thy loving father?\"  \"Thou art good to me that am unworthy, O mighty and gracious lord: that in truth I know.  But--but--it grieveth me to think of him that is to die, and--\"  \"Ah, 'tis like thee, 'tis like thee!  I know thy heart is still the same, even though thy mind hath suffered hurt, for thou wert ever of a gentle spirit.  But this duke standeth between thee and thine honours:  I will have another in his stead that shall bring no taint to his great office. Comfort thee, my prince:  trouble not thy poor head with this matter.\"  \"But is it not I that speed him hence, my liege?  How long might he not live, but for me?\"  \"Take no thought of him, my prince:  he is not worthy.  Kiss me once again, and go to thy trifles and amusements; for my malady distresseth me.  I am aweary, and would rest.  Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy people, and come again when my body is refreshed.\"  Tom, heavy-hearted, was conducted from the presence, for this last sentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would be set free.  Once more he heard the buzz of low voices exclaiming, \"The prince, the prince comes!\"  His spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the glittering files of bowing courtiers; for he recognised that he was indeed a captive now, and might remain for ever shut up in this gilded cage, a forlorn and friendless prince, except God in his mercy take pity on him and set him free.  And, turn where he would, he seemed to see floating in the air the severed head and the remembered face of the great Duke of Norfolk, the eyes fixed on him reproachfully.  His old dreams had been so pleasant; but this reality was so dreary!    Chapter VI. Tom receives instructions.  Tom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite, and made to sit down--a thing which he was loth to do, since there were elderly men and men of high degree about him.  He begged them to be seated also, but they only bowed their thanks or murmured them, and remained standing. He would have insisted, but his 'uncle' the Earl of Hertford whispered in his ear--  \"Prithee, insist not, my lord; it is not meet that they sit in thy presence.\"  The Lord St. John was announced, and after making obeisance to Tom, he said--  \"I come upon the King's errand, concerning a matter which requireth privacy.  Will it please your royal highness to dismiss all that attend you here, save my lord the Earl of Hertford?\"  Observing that Tom did not seem to know how to proceed, Hertford whispered him to make a sign with his hand, and not trouble himself to speak unless he chose.  When the waiting gentlemen had retired, Lord St. John said--  \"His majesty commandeth, that for due and weighty reasons of state, the prince's grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that be within his power, till it be passed and he be as he was before.  To wit, that he shall deny to none that he is the true prince, and heir to England's greatness; that he shall uphold his princely dignity, and shall receive, without word or sign of protest, that reverence and observance which unto it do appertain of right and ancient usage; that he shall cease to speak to any of that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured out of the unwholesome imaginings of o'er-wrought fancy; that he shall strive with diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which he was wont to know--and where he faileth he shall hold his peace, neither betraying by semblance of surprise or other sign that he hath forgot; that upon occasions of state, whensoever any matter shall perplex him as to the thing he should do or the utterance he should make, he shall show nought of unrest to the curious that look on, but take advice in that matter of the Lord Hertford, or my humble self, which are commanded of the King to be upon this service and close at call, till this commandment be dissolved. Thus saith the King's majesty, who sendeth greeting to your royal highness, and prayeth that God will of His mercy quickly heal you and have you now and ever in His holy keeping.\"  The Lord St. John made reverence and stood aside.  Tom replied resignedly--  \"The King hath said it.  None may palter with the King's command, or fit it to his ease, where it doth chafe, with deft evasions. The King shall be obeyed.\"  Lord Hertford said--  \"Touching the King's majesty's ordainment concerning books and such like serious matters, it may peradventure please your highness to ease your time with lightsome entertainment, lest you go wearied to the banquet and suffer harm thereby.\"  Tom's face showed inquiring surprise; and a blush followed when he saw Lord St. John's eyes bent sorrowfully upon him.  His lordship said--  \"Thy memory still wrongeth thee, and thou hast shown surprise--but suffer it not to trouble thee, for 'tis a matter that will not bide, but depart with thy mending malady.  My Lord of Hertford speaketh of the city's banquet which the King's majesty did promise, some two months flown, your highness should attend.  Thou recallest it now?\"  \"It grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me,\" said Tom, in a hesitating voice; and blushed again.  At this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were announced. The two lords exchanged significant glances, and Hertford stepped quickly toward the door.  As the young girls passed him, he said in a low voice--  \"I pray ye, ladies, seem not to observe his humours, nor show surprise when his memory doth lapse--it will grieve you to note how it doth stick at every trifle.\"  Meantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom's ear--  \"Please you, sir, keep diligently in mind his majesty's desire. Remember all thou canst--SEEM to remember all else.  Let them not perceive that thou art much changed from thy wont, for thou knowest how tenderly thy old play-fellows bear thee in their hearts and how 'twould grieve them. Art willing, sir, that I remain?--and thine uncle?\"  Tom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word, for he was already learning, and in his simple heart was resolved to acquit himself as best he might, according to the King's command.  In spite of every precaution, the conversation among the young people became a little embarrassing at times.  More than once, in truth, Tom was near to breaking down and confessing himself unequal to his tremendous part; but the tact of the Princess Elizabeth saved him, or a word from one or the other of the vigilant lords, thrown in apparently by chance, had the same happy effect.  Once the little Lady Jane turned to Tom and dismayed him with this question,--  \"Hast paid thy duty to the Queen's majesty to-day, my lord?\"  Tom hesitated, looked distressed, and was about to stammer out something at hazard, when Lord St. John took the word and answered for him with the easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter delicate difficulties and to be ready for them--  \"He hath indeed, madam, and she did greatly hearten him, as touching his majesty's condition; is it not so, your highness?\"  Tom mumbled something that stood for assent, but felt that he was getting upon dangerous ground.  Somewhat later it was mentioned that Tom was to study no more at present, whereupon her little ladyship exclaimed--  \"'Tis a pity, 'tis a pity!  Thou wert proceeding bravely.  But bide thy time in patience:  it will not be for long.  Thou'lt yet be graced with learning like thy father, and make thy tongue master of as many languages as his, good my prince.\"  \"My father!\" cried Tom, off his guard for the moment.  \"I trow he cannot speak his own so that any but the swine that kennel in the styes may tell his meaning; and as for learning of any sort soever--\"  He looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my Lord St. John's eyes.  He stopped, blushed, then continued low and sadly: \"Ah, my malady persecuteth me again, and my mind wandereth.  I meant the King's grace no irreverence.\"  \"We know it, sir,\" said the Princess Elizabeth, taking her 'brother's' hand between her two palms, respectfully but caressingly; \"trouble not thyself as to that.  The fault is none of thine, but thy distemper's.\"  \"Thou'rt a gentle comforter, sweet lady,\" said Tom, gratefully, \"and my heart moveth me to thank thee for't, an' I may be so bold.\"  Once the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at Tom.  The Princess Elizabeth's quick eye saw by the serene blankness of the target's front that the"]]]
