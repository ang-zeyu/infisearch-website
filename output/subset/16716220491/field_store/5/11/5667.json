The charm of West Africa is a painful one:  it gives you pleasure when you are out there, but when you are back here it gives you pain by calling you.  It sends up before your eyes a vision of a wall of dancing white, rainbow-gemmed surf playing on a shore of yellow sand before an audience of stately coco palms; or of a great mangrove- watered bronze river; or of a vast aisle in some forest cathedral: and you hear, nearer to you than the voices of the people round, nearer than the roar of the city traffic, the sound of the surf that is breaking on the shore down there, and the sound of the wind talking on the hard palm leaves and the thump of the natives' tom- toms; or the cry of the parrots passing over the mangrove swamps in the evening time; or the sweet, long, mellow whistle of the plantain warblers calling up the dawn; and everything that is round you grows poor and thin in the face of the vision, and you want to go back to the Coast that is calling you, saying, as the African says to the departing soul of his dying friend, \"Come back, come back, this is your home.\"                                       M.

It was in 1893 that, for the first time in my life, I found myself in possession of five or six months which were not heavily forestalled, and feeling like a boy with a new half-crown, I lay about in my mind, as Mr. Bunyan would say, as to what to do with them.  \"Go and learn your tropics,\" said Science.  Where on earth am I to go? I wondered, for tropics are tropics wherever found, so I got down an atlas and saw that either South America or West Africa must be my destination, for the Malayan region was too far off and too expensive.  Then I got Wallace's Geographical Distribution and after reading that master's article on the Ethiopian region I hardened my heart and closed with West Africa.  I did this the more readily because while I knew nothing of the practical condition of it, I knew a good deal both by tradition and report of South East America, and remembered that Yellow Jack was endemic, and that a certain naturalist, my superior physically and mentally, had come very near getting starved to death in the depressing society of an expedition slowly perishing of want and miscellaneous fevers up the Parana.  My ignorance regarding West Africa was soon removed.  And although the vast cavity in my mind that it occupied is not even yet half filled up, there is a great deal of very curious information in its place.  I use the word curious advisedly, for I think many seemed to translate my request for practical hints and advice into an advertisement that \"Rubbish may be shot here.\"  This same information is in a state of great confusion still, although I have made heroic efforts to codify it.  I find, however, that it can almost all be got in under the following different headings, namely and to wit:  -  The dangers of West Africa. The disagreeables of West Africa. The diseases of West Africa. The things you must take to West Africa. The things you find most handy in West Africa. The worst possible things you can do in West Africa.  I inquired of all my friends as a beginning what they knew of West Africa.  The majority knew nothing.  A percentage said, \"Oh, you can't possibly go there; that's where Sierra Leone is, the white mans grave, you know.\"  If these were pressed further, one occasionally found that they had had relations who had gone out there after having been \"sad trials,\" but, on consideration of their having left not only West Africa, but this world, were now forgiven and forgotten.  I next turned my attention to cross-examining the doctors. \"Deadliest spot on earth,\" they said cheerfully, and showed me maps of the geographical distribution of disease.  Now I do not say that a country looks inviting when it is coloured in Scheele's green or a bilious yellow, but these colours may arise from lack of artistic gift in the cartographer.  There is no mistaking what he means by black, however, and black you'll find they colour West Africa from above Sierra Leone to below the Congo.  \"I wouldn't go there if I were you,\" said my medical friends, \"you'll catch something; but if you must go, and you're as obstinate as a mule, just bring me--\" and then followed a list of commissions from here to New York, any one of which--but I only found that out afterwards.  All my informants referred me to the missionaries.  \"There were,\" they said, in an airy way, \"lots of them down there, and had been for many years.\"  So to missionary literature I addressed myself with great ardour; alas! only to find that these good people wrote their reports not to tell you how the country they resided in was, but how it was getting on towards being what it ought to be, and how necessary it was that their readers should subscribe more freely, and not get any foolishness into their heads about obtaining an inadequate supply of souls for their money.  I also found fearful confirmation of my medical friends' statements about its unhealthiness, and various details of the distribution of cotton shirts over which I did not linger.  From the missionaries it was, however, that I got my first idea about the social condition of West Africa.  I gathered that there existed there, firstly the native human beings--the raw material, as it were--and that these were led either to good or bad respectively by the missionary and the trader.  There were also the Government representatives, whose chief business it was to strengthen and consolidate the missionary's work, a function they carried on but indifferently well.  But as for those traders! well, I put them down under the dangers of West Africa at once.  Subsequently I came across the good old Coast yarn of how, when a trader from that region went thence, it goes without saying where, the Fallen Angel without a moment's hesitation vacated the infernal throne (Milton) in his favour.  This, I beg to note, is the marine form of the legend.  When it occurs terrestrially the trader becomes a Liverpool mate.  But of course no one need believe it either way--it is not a missionary's story.  Naturally, while my higher intelligence was taken up with attending to these statements, my mind got set on going, and I had to go. Fortunately I could number among my acquaintances one individual who had lived on the Coast for seven years.  Not, it is true, on that part of it which I was bound for.  Still his advice was pre- eminently worth attention, because, in spite of his long residence in the deadliest spot of the region, he was still in fair going order.  I told him I intended going to West Africa, and he said, \"When you have made up your mind to go to West Africa the very best thing you can do is to get it unmade again and go to Scotland instead; but if your intelligence is not strong enough to do so, abstain from exposing yourself to the direct rays of the sun, take 4 grains of quinine every day for a fortnight before you reach the Rivers, and get some introductions to the Wesleyans; they are the only people on the Coast who have got a hearse with feathers.\"  My attention was next turned to getting ready things to take with me.  Having opened upon myself the sluice gates of advice, I rapidly became distracted.  My friends and their friends alike seemed to labour under the delusion that I intended to charter a steamer and was a person of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice.  This not being the case, the only thing to do was to gratefully listen and let things drift.  Not only do the things you have got to take, but the things you have got to take them in, present a fine series of problems to the young traveller.  Crowds of witnesses testified to the forms of baggage holders they had found invaluable, and these, it is unnecessary to say, were all different in form and material.  With all this embarras de choix I was too distracted to buy anything new in the way of baggage except a long waterproof sack neatly closed at the top with a bar and handle.  Into this I put blankets, boots, books, in fact anything that would not go into my portmanteau or black bag.  From the first I was haunted by a conviction that its bottom would come out, but it never did, and in spite of the fact that it had ideas of its own about the arrangement of its contents, it served me well throughout my voyage.  It was the beginning of August '93 when I first left England for \"the Coast.\"  Preparations of quinine with postage partially paid arrived up to the last moment, and a friend hastily sent two newspaper clippings, one entitled \"A Week in a Palm-oil Tub,\" which was supposed to describe the sort of accommodation, companions, and fauna likely to be met with on a steamer going to West Africa, and on which I was to spend seven to The Graphic contributor's one; the other from The Daily Telegraph, reviewing a French book of \"Phrases in common use\" in Dahomey.  The opening sentence in the latter was, \"Help, I am drowning.\"  Then came the inquiry, \"If a man is not a thief?\" and then another cry, \"The boat is upset.\"  \"Get up, you lazy scamps,\" is the next"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],["title","Travels in West Africa: Congo Français, Corisco and Cameroons (#2)"],["body","ation, followed almost immediately by the question, \"Why has not this man been buried?\"  \"It is fetish that has killed him, and he must lie here exposed with nothing on him until only the bones remain,\" is the cheerful answer.  This sounded discouraging to a person whose occupation would necessitate going about considerably in boats, and whose fixed desire was to study fetish.  So with a feeling of foreboding gloom I left London for Liverpool--none the more cheerful for the matter-of-fact manner in which the steamboat agents had informed me that they did not issue return tickets by the West African lines of steamers.  I will not go into the details of that voyage here, much as I am given to discursiveness.  They are more amusing than instructive, for on my first voyage out I did not know the Coast, and the Coast did not know me and we mutually terrified each other.  I fully expected to get killed by the local nobility and gentry; they thought I was connected with the World's Women's Temperance Association, and collecting shocking details for subsequent magic-lantern lectures on the liquor traffic; so fearful misunderstandings arose, but we gradually educated each other, and I had the best of the affair; for all I had got to teach them was that I was only a beetle and fetish hunter, and so forth, while they had to teach me a new world, and a very fascinating course of study I found it.  And whatever the Coast may have to say against me--for my continual desire for hair-pins, and other pins, my intolerable habit of getting into water, the abominations full of ants, that I brought into their houses, or things emitting at unexpectedly short notice vivid and awful stenches--they cannot but say that I was a diligent pupil, who honestly tried to learn the lessons they taught me so kindly, though some of those lessons were hard to a person who had never previously been even in a tame bit of tropics, and whose life for many years had been an entirely domestic one in a University town.  One by one I took my old ideas derived from books and thoughts based on imperfect knowledge and weighed them against the real life around me, and found them either worthless or wanting.  The greatest recantation I had to make I made humbly before I had been three months on the Coast in 1893.  It was of my idea of the traders. What I had expected to find them was a very different thing to what I did find them; and of their kindness to me I can never sufficiently speak, for on that voyage I was utterly out of touch with the governmental circles, and utterly dependent on the traders, and the most useful lesson of all the lessons I learnt on the West Coast in 1893 was that I could trust them.  Had I not learnt this very thoroughly I could never have gone out again and carried out the voyage I give you a sketch of in this book.  Thanks to \"the Agent,\" I have visited places I could never otherwise have seen; and to the respect and affection in which he is held by the native, I owe it that I have done so in safety.  When I have arrived off his factory in a steamer or canoe unexpected, unintroduced, or turned up equally unheralded out of the bush in a dilapidated state, he has always received me with that gracious hospitality which must have given him, under Coast conditions, very real trouble and inconvenience--things he could have so readily found logical excuses against entailing upon himself for the sake of an individual whom he had never seen before--whom he most likely would never see again--and whom it was no earthly profit to him to see then.  He has bestowed himself--Allah only knows where--on his small trading vessels so that I might have his one cabin.  He has fished me out of sea and fresh water with boat-hooks; he has continually given me good advice, which if I had only followed would have enabled me to keep out of water and any other sort of affliction; and although he holds the meanest opinion of my intellect for going to such a place as West Africa for beetles, fishes and fetish, he has given me the greatest assistance in my work.  The value of that work I pray you withhold judgment on, until I lay it before you in some ten volumes or so mostly in Latin.  All I know that is true regarding West African facts, I owe to the traders; the errors are my own.  To Dr. Gunther, of the British Museum, I am deeply grateful for the kindness and interest he has always shown regarding all the specimens of natural history that I have been able to lay before him; the majority of which must have had very old tales to tell him. Yet his courtesy and attention gave me the thing a worker in any work most wants--the sense that the work was worth doing--and sent me back to work again with the knowledge that if these things interested a man like him, it was a more than sufficient reason for me to go on collecting them.  To Mr. W. H. F. Kirby I am much indebted for his working out my small collection of certain Orders of insects; and to Mr. Thomas S. Forshaw, for the great help he has afforded me in revising my notes.  It is impossible for me even to catalogue my debts of gratitude still outstanding to the West Coast.  Chiefly am I indebted to Mr. C. G. Hudson, whose kindness and influence enabled me to go up the Ogowe and to see as much of Congo Francais as I have seen, and his efforts to take care of me were most ably seconded by Mr. Fildes. The French officials in \"Congo Francais\" never hindered me, and always treated me with the greatest kindness.  You may say there was no reason why they should not, for there is nothing in this fine colony of France that they need be ashamed of any one seeing; but I find it is customary for travellers to say the French officials throw obstacles in the way of any one visiting their possessions, so I merely beg to state this was decidedly not my experience; although my deplorable ignorance of French prevented me from explaining my humble intentions to them.  The Rev. Dr. Nassau and Mr. R. E. Dennett have enabled me, by placing at my disposal the rich funds of their knowledge of native life and idea, to amplify any deductions from my own observation. Mr. Dennett's work I have not dealt with in this work because it refers to tribes I was not amongst on this journey, but to a tribe I made the acquaintance with in my '93 voyage--the Fjort.  Dr. Nassau's observations I have referred to.  Herr von Lucke, Vice- governor of Cameroon, I am indebted to for not only allowing me, but for assisting me by every means in his power, to go up Cameroons Peak, and to the Governor of Cameroon, Herr von Puttkamer, for his constant help and kindness.  Indeed so great has been the willingness to help me of all these gentlemen, that it is a wonder to me, when I think of it, that their efforts did not project me right across the continent and out at Zanzibar.  That this brilliant affair did not come off is owing to my own lack of enterprise; for I did not want to go across the continent, and I do not hanker after Zanzibar, but only to go puddling about obscure districts in West Africa after raw fetish and fresh-water fishes.  I owe my ability to have profited by the kindness of these gentlemen on land, to a gentleman of the sea--Captain Murray.  He was captain of the vessel I went out on in 1893, and he saw then that my mind was full of errors that must be eradicated if I was going to deal with the Coast successfully; and so he eradicated those errors and replaced them with sound knowledge from his own stores collected during an acquaintance with the West Coast of over thirty years. The education he has given me has been of the greatest value to me, and I sincerely hope to make many more voyages under him, for I well know he has still much to teach and I to learn.  Last, but not least, I must chronicle my debts to the ladies.  First to those two courteous Portuguese ladies, Donna Anna de Sousa Coutinho e Chichorro and her sister Donna Maria de Sousa Coutinho, who did so much for me in Kacongo in 1893, and have remained, I am proud to say, my firm friends ever since.  Lady MacDonald and Miss Mary Slessor I speak of in this book, but only faintly sketch the pleasure and help they have afforded me; nor have I fully expressed my gratitude for the kindness of Madame Jacot of Lembarene, or Madame Forget of Talagouga.  Then there are a whole list of nuns belonging to the Roman Catholic Missions on the South West Coast, ever cheery and charming companions; and Frau Plehn, whom it was a continual pleasure to see in Cameroons, and discourse with once again on things that seemed so far off then--art, science, and literature; and Mrs. H. Duggan, of Cameroons too, who used, whenever I came into that port to rescue me from fearful states of starvation for toilet necessaries, and lend a sympathetic and intelligent ear to the \"awful sufferings\" I had gone through, until Cameroons became to me a thing to look forward to.  When in the Canaries in 1892, I used to smile, I regretfully own, at the conversation of a gentleman from the Gold Coast who was up there recruiting after a bad fever.  His conversation consisted largely of anecdotes of friends of his, and nine times in ten he used to say, \"He's dead now.\"  Alas! my own conversation may be smiled at now for the same cause.  Many of my friends mentioned even in this very recent account of the Coast \"are dead now.\"  Most of those I learnt to know in 1893; chief among these is my old friend Captain Boler, of Bonny, from whom I first learnt a certain power of comprehending the African and his form of thought.  I have great reason to be grateful to the Africans themselves--to cultured men and women among them like Charles Owoo, Mbo, Sanga Glass, Jane Harrington and her sister at Gaboon, and to the bush natives; but of my experience with them I give further details, so I need not dwell on them here.  I apologise to the general reader for giving so much detail on matters that really only affect myself, and I"]]]
