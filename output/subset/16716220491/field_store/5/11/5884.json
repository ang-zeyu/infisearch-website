Would you cast your jewels all to the breezes blowing?   Would you leave the mother who on golden grain has fed you?   Would you grieve the lover who is riding forth to wed you?    Mother mine, to the wild forest I am going,   Where upon the champa boughs the champa buds are blowing;   To the koil-haunted river-isles where lotus lilies glisten,   The voices of the fairy folk are calling me: O listen!    Honey, child, honey, child, the world is full of pleasure,   Of bridal-songs and cradle-songs and sandal-scented leisure.   Your bridal robes are in the loom, silver and saffron glowing,   Your bridal cakes are on the hearth: O whither are you going?    The bridal-songs and cradle-songs have cadences of sorrow,   The laughter of the sun to-day, the wind of death to-morrow.   Far sweeter sound the forest-notes where forest-streams are falling;   O mother mine, I cannot stay, the fairy-folk are calling.    IN PRAISE OF HENNA    A kokila called from a henna-spray:   LIRA! LIREE! LIRA! LIREE!   Hasten, maidens, hasten away   To gather the leaves of the henna-tree.   Send your pitchers afloat on the tide,   Gather the leaves ere the dawn be old,   Grind them in mortars of amber and gold,   The fresh green leaves of the henna-tree.    A kokila called from a henna-spray:   LIRA! LIREE! LIRA! LIREE!   Hasten maidens, hasten away   To gather the leaves of the henna-tree.   The tilka's red for the brow of a bride,   And betel-nut's red for lips that are sweet;   But, for lily-like fingers and feet,   The red, the red of the henna-tree.    HARVEST HYMN         Men's Voices    Lord of the lotus, lord of the harvest,   Bright and munificent lord of the morn!   Thine is the bounty that prospered our sowing,   Thine is the bounty that nurtured our corn.   We bring thee our songs and our garlands for tribute,   The gold of our fields and the gold of our fruit;   O giver of mellowing radiance, we hail thee,   We praise thee, O Surya, with cymbal and flute.    Lord of the rainbow, lord of the harvest,   Great and beneficent lord of the main!   Thine is the mercy that cherished our furrows,   Thine is the mercy that fostered our grain.   We bring thee our thanks and our garlands for tribute,   The wealth of our valleys, new-garnered and ripe;   O sender of rain and the dewfall, we hail thee,   We praise thee, Varuna, with cymbal and pipe.          Women's Voices    Queen of the gourd-flower, queen of the harvest,   Sweet and omnipotent mother, O Earth!   Thine is the plentiful bosom that feeds us,   Thine is the womb where our riches have birth.   We bring thee our love and our garlands for tribute,   With gifts of thy opulent giving we come;   O source of our manifold gladness, we hail thee,   We praise thee, O Prithvi, with cymbal and drum.          All Voices    Lord of the Universe, Lord of our being,   Father eternal, ineffable Om!   Thou art the Seed and the Scythe of our harvests,   Thou art our Hands and our Heart and our Home.   We bring thee our lives and our labours for tribute,   Grant us thy succour, thy counsel, thy care.   O Life of all life and all blessing, we hail thee,   We praise thee, O Bramha, with cymbal and prayer.    INDIAN LOVE-SONG        She    Like a serpent to the calling voice of flutes,   Glides my heart into thy fingers, O my Love!   Where the night-wind, like a lover, leans above   His jasmine-gardens and sirisha-bowers;   And on ripe boughs of many-coloured fruits   Bright parrots cluster like vermilion flowers.          He    Like the perfume in the petals of a rose,   Hides thy heart within my bosom, O my love!   Like a garland, like a jewel, like a dove   That hangs its nest in the asoka-tree.   Lie still, O love, until the morning sows   Her tents of gold on fields of ivory.    CRADLE-SONG       From groves of spice,      O'er fields of rice,   Athwart the lotus-stream,      I bring for you,      Aglint with dew   A little lovely dream.       Sweet, shut your eyes,      The wild fire-flies   Dance through the fairy neem;      From the poppy-bole      For you I stole   A little lovely dream.       Dear eyes, good-night,      In golden light   The stars around you gleam;      On you I press      With soft caress   A little lovely dream.    SUTTEE    Lamp of my life, the lips of Death   Hath blown thee out with their sudden breath;   Naught shall revive thy vanished spark . . .   Love, must I dwell in the living dark?    Tree of my life, Death's cruel foot   Hath crushed thee down to thy hidden root;   Nought shall restore thy glory fled . . .   Shall the blossom live when the tree is dead?    Life of my life, Death's bitter sword   Hath severed us like a broken word,   Rent us in twain who are but one . .   Shall the flesh survive when the soul is gone?    SONGS FOR MUSIC   SONG OF A DREAM    Once in the dream of a night I stood   Lone in the light of a magical wood,   Soul-deep in visions that poppy-like sprang;   And spirits of Truth were the birds that sang,   And spirits of Love were the stars that glowed,   And spirits of Peace were the streams that flowed   In that magical wood in the land of sleep.    Lone in the light of that magical grove,   I felt the stars of the spirits of Love   Gather and gleam round my delicate youth,   And I heard the song of the spirits of Truth;   To quench my longing I bent me low   By the streams of the spirits of Peace that flow   In that magical wood in the land of sleep.    HUMAYUN TO ZOBEIDA    (From the Urdu)    You flaunt your beauty in the rose, your glory in the dawn,   Your sweetness in the nightingale, your whiteness in the swan.    You haunt my waking like a dream, my slumber like a moon,   Pervade me like a musky scent, possess me like a tune.    Yet, when I crave of you, my sweet, one tender moment's grace,   You cry, \"I SIT BEHIND THE VEIL, I CANNOT SHOW MY FACE.\"    Shall any foolish veil divide my longing from my bliss?   Shall any fragile curtain hide your beauty from my kiss?    What war is this of THEE and ME? Give o'er the wanton strife,   You are the heart within my heart, the life within my life.    AUTUMN SONG    Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,      The sunset hangs on a cloud;   A golden storm of glittering sheaves,   Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,      The wild wind blows in a cloud.    Hark to a voice that is calling      To my heart in the voice of the wind:   My heart is weary and sad and alone,   For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,      And why should I stay behind?    ALABASTER    Like this alabaster box whose art   Is frail as a cassia-flower, is my heart,   Carven with delicate dreams and wrought   With many a subtle and exquisite thought.    Therein I treasure the spice and scent   Of rich and passionate memories blent   Like odours of cinnamon, sandal and clove,   Of song and sorrow and life and love.    ECSTASY    Cover mine eyes, O my Love!      Mine eyes that are weary of bliss   As of light that is poignant and strong      O silence my lips with a kiss,   My lips that are weary of song!    Shelter my soul, O my love!      My soul is bent low with the pain   And the burden of love, like the grace      Of a flower that is smitten with rain:   O shelter my soul from thy face!    TO MY FAIRY FANCIES    Nay, no longer I may hold you,      In my spirit's soft caresses,   Nor like lotus-leaves enfold you      In the tangles of my tresses.   Fairy fancies, fly away      To the white cloud-wildernesses,            Fly away!    Nay, no longer ye may linger      With your laughter-lighted faces,   Now I am a thought-worn singer      In life's high and lonely places.   Fairy fancies, fly away,      To bright wind-inwoven spaces,            Fly away!    POEMS    ODE TO H.H. THE NIZAM OF HYDERABAD    (Presented at the Ramzan Durbar)    Deign, Prince, my tribute to receive,   This lyric offering to your name,   Who round your jewelled scepter bind   The lilies of a poet's fame;   Beneath whose sway concordant dwell   The peoples whom your laws embrace,   In brotherhood of diverse creeds,   And harmony of diverse race:    The votaries of the Prophet's faith,   Of whom you are the crown and chief   And they, who bear on Vedic brows   Their mystic symbols of belief;    And they, who worshipping the sun,   Fled o'er the old Iranian sea;   And they, who bow to Him who trod   The midnight waves of Galilee.    Sweet, sumptuous fables of Baghdad   The splendours of your court recall,   The torches of a Thousand Nights   Blaze through a single festival;   And Saki-singers down the streets,   Pour for us, in a stream divine,   From goblets of your love-ghazals   The rapture of your Sufi wine.    Prince, where your radiant cities smile,   Grim hills their sombre vigils keep,   Your ancient forests hoard and hold   The legends of their centuried sleep;   Your birds of peace white-pinioned float   O'er ruined fort and storied plain,   Your faithful stewards sleepless guard   The harvests of your gold and grain.    God give you joy, God give you grace   To shield the truth and smite the wrong,   To honour Virtue, Valour, Worth.   To cherish faith and foster song.   So may the lustre of your days   Outshine the deeds Firdusi sung,   Your name within a nation's prayer,   Your music on a nation's tongue.    LEILI    The serpents are asleep among the poppies,   The fireflies light the soundless panther's way   To tangled paths where shy gazelles are straying,   And parrot-plumes outshine the dying day.   O soft! the lotus-buds upon the stream   Are stirring like sweet maidens when they dream.    A caste-mark on the azure brows of Heaven,   The golden moon burns sacred, solemn, bright   The winds are dancing in the forest-temple,   And swooning at the holy feet of Night.   Hush! in the silence mystic voices sing   And make the gods their incense-offering.

SEEPS, THE DUCK  THE RABBIT MAGICIAN  THE CHENOO AND THE LIZARD  THE WOMAN AND THE SERPENT     INTRODUCTION   Among the six chief divisions of the red Indians of North America the most widely extended is the Algonquin. This people ranged from Labrador to the far South, from Newfoundland to the Rocky Mountains, speaking forty dialects, as the Hon. J. H. Trumbull has shown in his valuable work on the subject. Belonging to this division are the Micmacs of New Brunswick and the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes of Maine, who with the St. Francis Indians of Canada and some smaller clans call themselves the Wabanaki, a word derived from a root signifying white or light, intimating that they live nearest to the rising sun or the east. In fact, the French-speaking St. Francis family, who are known _par eminence_ as \"the Abenaki,\" translate the term by _point du jour_.  The Wabanaki have in common the traditions of a grand mythology, the central figure of which is a demigod or hero, who, while he is always great, consistent, and benevolent, and never devoid of dignity, presents traits which are very much more like those of Odin and Thor, with not a little of Pantagruel, than anything in the characters of the Chippewa Manobozho, or the Iroquois Hiawatha. The name of this divinity is Glooskap, meaning, strangely enough, the Liar, because it is said that when he left earth, like King Arthur, for Fairyland, he promised to return, and has never done so. It is characteristic of the Norse gods that while they are grand they are manly, and combine with this a peculiarly domestic humanity. Glooskap is the Norse god intensified. He is, however, more of a giant; he grows to a more appalling greatness than Thor or Odin in his battles; when a _Kiawaqu'_, or Jotun, rises to the clouds to oppose him, Glooskap's head touches the stars, and scorning to slay so mean a foe like an equal, he kills him contemptuously with a light tap of his bow. But in the family circle he is the most benevolent of gentle heroes, and has his oft-repeated little standard jokes. Yet he never, like the Manobozho-Hiawatha of the Chippewas, becomes silly, cruel, or fantastic. He has his roaring revel with a brother giant, even as Thor went fishing in fierce fun with the frost god, but he is never low or feeble.  Around Glooskap, who is by far the grandest and most Aryan-like character ever evolved from a savage mind, and who is more congenial to a reader of Shakespeare and Rabelais than any deity ever imagined out of Europe, there are found strange giants: some literal Jotuns of stone and ice, sorcerers who become giants like Glooskap, at will; the terrible Chenoo, a human being with an icy-stone heart, who has sunk to a cannibal and ghoul; all the weird monsters and horrors of the Eskimo mythology, witches and demons, inherited from the terribly black sorcery which preceded Shamanism, and compared to which the latter was like an advanced religion, and all the minor mythology of dwarfs and fairies. The Indian _m'teoulin_, or magician, distinctly taught that every created thing, animate or inanimate, had its indwelling spirit. Whatever had an _idea_ had a soul. Therefore the Wabanaki mythology is strangely like that of the Rosicrucians. But it created spirits for the terrible Arctic winters of the north, for the icebergs and frozen wastes, for the Northern Lights and polar bears. It made, in short, a mythology such as would be perfectly congenial to any one who has read and understood the Edda, Beowulf, and the Kalevala, with the wildest and oldest Norse sagas. But it is, as regards spirit and meaning, utterly and entirely unlike anything else that is American. It is not like the Mexican pantheon; it has not the same sounds, colors, or feelings; and though many of its incidents or tales are the same as those of the Chippewas, or other tribes, we still feel that there is an incredible difference in the spirit. Its ways are not as their ways. This Wabanaki mythology, which was that which gave a fairy, an elf, a naiad, or a hero to every rock and river and ancient hill in New England, is just the one of all others which is least known to the New Englanders.
