To Which are Added Other Tales (#2)"],["body","while Fanny tied up her bunches of flowers, she would repeat some verses from the Holy Scriptures, such as this, \"O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.\" And afterwards she would repeat such pretty lines as these:--    \"Not worlds on worlds, in varied form,      Need we, to tell a God is here;    The daisy, saved from winter's storm,      Speaks of his hand in lines as clear.    \"For who but He who formed the skies,      And poured the day-spring's living flood,    Wondrous alike in all He tries,      Could rear the daisy's simple bud!    \"Mould its green cup, its wiry stem,      Its fringed border nicely spin;    And cut the gold-embossed gem,      That, shrined in silver, shines within;    \"And fling it, unrestrained and free,      O'er hill, and dale, and desert sod,    That man, where'er he walks, may see,      In every step the trace of God.\"   \"And I, too, have had my daisy given to me,\" poor Mrs. Newton would say, with tearful eyes, as she gazed on her little flower-girl; \"I too have my daisy, and though it may be little cared for in the world, or trodden under foot of men, yet will it ever bear, I trust, the trace of God.\"  But it happened the very morning that the gentleman had given Fanny the half-sovereign in mistake, Mrs. Newton's money was quite spent; and she was much troubled, thinking the child must go the next morning to the garden without money to pay for her flowers, for she did not think it likely she would sell enough to buy what they required, and pay for them also; so she told Fanny she must ask Mr. Simpson to let her owe him for a day or two until she got a little money she expected.  Fanny went therefore, and said this to the kind man at the garden; and he put his hand on her head, and said, \"My pretty little girl, you may owe me as long as you please, for you are a good child, and God will prosper you.\"  So Fanny went back in great delight, and told this to Mrs. Newton; and to cheer her still more, she chose for her morning verse, the advice that our Lord gave to all those who were careful and troubled about the things of this life \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, oh ye of little faith?\"  And then she repeated some verses which both she and Mrs. Newton liked very much.    \"Lo! the lilies of the field,   How their leaves instruction yield!   Hark to nature's lesson, given   By the blessed birds of heaven.    \"Say with richer crimson glows,   The kingly mantle than the rose;   Say are kings more richly dressed,   Than the lily's glowing vest!  \"Grandmother I forget the next verse,\" said Fanny, interrupting herself; \"I know it is something about lilies not spinning; but then comes this verse--    \"Barns, nor hoarded store have we\"--  \"It is not the lilies, grandmother, but the blessed birds that are speaking now--    \"Barns, nor hoarded store have we,   Yet we carol joyously;   Mortals, fly from doubt and sorrow,   God provideth for the morrow.\"  Poor Mrs. Newton clasped her thin hands, and looked up, and prayed like the disciples, \"Lord, increase our faith!\"  \"Eh!\" said she, afterwards, \"is it not strange that we can trust our Lord and Saviour with the care of our souls for eternity, and we cannot trust Him with that of our bodies for a day.\"  Well! this was poor Mrs. Newton's state on that day, when the gentleman gave Fanny the half-sovereign instead of sixpence, for her flowers.  When the little flower-girl came back from her race with her two sixpences, she found the old vegetable-seller had got her three or four pennies more, by merely showing her basket, and telling why it was left at his stall; and so every one left a penny for the honest child, and hoped the gentleman would reward her well. The old man at the stall said it was very shabby of him only to give her sixpence; but when she went home with three sixpences and told Mrs. Newton this story, she kissed her little girl very fondly, but said the gentleman was good to give her sixpence, for he had no right to give her anything, she had only done her duty.  \"But, grandmother,\" said Fanny, \"when I saw that pretty half-sovereign dropping down to his purse, I could not help wishing he would give it to me.\"  \"And what commandment did you break then, my child?\"  \"Not the eighth--if I had kept the half-sovereign I should have broken it,\" said Fanny, \"for that says, thou shalt not steal--what commandment did I break, grandmother; for I did not steal?\"  \"When we desire to have what is not ours Fanny, what do we do? we covet; do we not?\"  \"Oh! yes--thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods,\" cried Fanny, \"that is the tenth commandment; and that half-sovereign was my neighbor's goods, and that fat gentleman was my neighbor. But, grandmother, it is very easy to break the tenth commandment.\"  \"Very easy indeed, my dear,\" said Mrs. Newton, with first a faint smile, and then a deep sigh, \"therefore,\" she added, \"we ought always to pray like David, 'Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity.'\"  There is a very common saying, that when things are at the worst they mend. It is hard to say when matters are at the worst; poor Mrs. Newton knew they might yet be worse with her; but certainly, they were very bad; and a few days after this, as Fanny was tying up her flowers as usual, she lay on her bed thinking what she was to do, and praying that God would direct her to some way of providing for the poor child.  While she was thinking and praying, tears stole down her face; Fanny saw them, and stopped her work, and looked sorrowfully at her--  \"Now you are crying again, grandmother, she said,\" and that's what makes me break the tenth commandment, for I can't help wishing the gentleman had given me that half-sovereign. But I will say the verses again to-day about the lilies and birds; for you know I said that morning--    'Mortals fly from doubt and sorrow,   God provideth for the morrow,'  and when I came back with my three sixpences, you said God _had_ provided for the morrow, for you had only two or three pennies in the house when I went out.\"  \"And how many pennies, pray, have you in the house to-day?\" said a rather gruff voice at the door.  Mrs. Newton and Fanny started; but there, standing at the door, Fanny saw the fat gentleman who had given her the half-sovereign.  \"So you have been wishing for my gold, you little rogue,\" he said, looking as if he meant to frighten her. \"Never mind,\" he added, smiling, \"you are a good child, and did what was right; and I always meant to bring it back to you, but I have been kept rather busy these few days past. There it is for you, and try not to break the tenth commandment again.\" Then turning to Mrs. Newton, he said, \"We should not expect rewards, ma'am, for doing our duty, but if children do not meet with approbation when they do right, they may be discouraged, and perhaps think there is no use in being good: for they are silly little creatures, you know, and do not always recollect that God will reward the just one day if men do not.\"  \"Oh! sir!\" said poor Mrs. Newton, but the tears streamed down, and she could not say a word more. And there Fanny sat gazing on the half-sovereign, as if she was half stupefied.  \"Well, take up that bit of gold, and do what you like with it,\" said the fat gentleman; \"and then run off to sell your flowers, for we must not be idle because we have got enough for to-day. But do what you like with that money.\"  Fanny rose up from her seat, and looking very much as if she was moving in her sleep, with her wondering eyes fixed on the shining piece that lay in her hand, she walked slowly over to Mrs. Newton, and putting it into hers, said,--  \"May I go to the grocer's now, grandmother, and get you the tea for your breakfast?\"  \"Yes, my love,\" said Mrs. Newton, kissing her, \"and take care of this, and bring back the change carefully.\" Then turning to the gentleman, she said, \"I am not young, sir, and I am very, very poorly; I find it hard to go without my tea, but it is a luxury I have been obliged latterly to forego.\"  \"But could you not get tea on credit, from the grocer?\" said the gentleman.  \"Oh! yes, I believe so; but there would be no use in getting credit;\" said Mrs. Newton, \"for I am not certain of being better able to pay next week than I am this week; and when I have not the money to pay for what I wish to get, it is better to do without it, than to add to one's anxieties by running in debt. Do you not think so, sir?\"  \"Ma'am,\" said the old gentleman, sitting down, and resting his large silver-topped stick between his knees, \"it is of very little consequence what I think; but if you wish to know this, I will tell you that I think very well both of you and your little girl, who, as I have heard, for I have made inquiries about you both, is a dependant on your bounty. You have trained her up well, though I wouldn't praise the child to her face; and so take as much tea as you like till you hear from me again, and your grocer need be in no trouble about his bill.\"  So after the fat gentleman had made this rather bluff, but honest-hearted speech, and poor Mrs. Newton had wept, and thanked him in language that sounded more polite, the good old gentleman told her his whole history.  He began the world very poor, and without relations able to assist him; he was at last taken into the employment of a young merchant in the city; he had a turn for business, and having been able to render some important services to this young man, he was finally, to his own surprise, and that of every one else, taken into partnership.  \"During all this time,\" said he, \"I was attached from my boyhood to the daughter of the poor schoolmaster who first"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/676"],["title","The Battle of Life (#1)"],["body","you’re a woman—almost,’ said the Doctor. ‘By-the-by,’ and he looked into the pretty face, still close to his, ‘I suppose it’s _your_ birth-day.’  ‘No!  Do you really, father?’ cried his pet daughter, pursing up her red lips to be kissed.  ‘There!  Take my love with it,’ said the Doctor, imprinting his upon them; ‘and many happy returns of the—the idea!—of the day.  The notion of wishing happy returns in such a farce as this,’ said the Doctor to himself, ‘is good!  Ha! ha! ha!’  Doctor Jeddler was, as I have said, a great philosopher, and the heart and mystery of his philosophy was, to look upon the world as a gigantic practical joke; as something too absurd to be considered seriously, by any rational man.  His system of belief had been, in the beginning, part and parcel of the battle-ground on which he lived, as you shall presently understand.  ‘Well!  But how did you get the music?’ asked the Doctor. ‘Poultry-stealers, of course!  Where did the minstrels come from?’  ‘Alfred sent the music,’ said his daughter Grace, adjusting a few simple flowers in her sister’s hair, with which, in her admiration of that youthful beauty, she had herself adorned it half-an-hour before, and which the dancing had disarranged.  ‘Oh!  Alfred sent the music, did he?’ returned the Doctor.  ‘Yes.  He met it coming out of the town as he was entering early.  The men are travelling on foot, and rested there last night; and as it was Marion’s birth-day, and he thought it would please her, he sent them on, with a pencilled note to me, saying that if I thought so too, they had come to serenade her.’  ‘Ay, ay,’ said the Doctor, carelessly, ‘he always takes your opinion.’  ‘And my opinion being favourable,’ said Grace, good-humouredly; and pausing for a moment to admire the pretty head she decorated, with her own thrown back; ‘and Marion being in high spirits, and beginning to dance, I joined her.  And so we danced to Alfred’s music till we were out of breath.  And we thought the music all the gayer for being sent by Alfred.  Didn’t we, dear Marion?’  ‘Oh, I don’t know, Grace.  How you tease me about Alfred.’  ‘Tease you by mentioning your lover?’ said her sister.  ‘I am sure I don’t much care to have him mentioned,’ said the wilful beauty, stripping the petals from some flowers she held, and scattering them on the ground.  ‘I am almost tired of hearing of him; and as to his being my lover—’  ‘Hush!  Don’t speak lightly of a true heart, which is all your own, Marion,’ cried her sister, ‘even in jest.  There is not a truer heart than Alfred’s in the world!’  ‘No-no,’ said Marion, raising her eyebrows with a pleasant air of careless consideration, ‘perhaps not.  But I don’t know that there’s any great merit in that.  I—I don’t want him to be so very true.  I never asked him.  If he expects that I— But, dear Grace, why need we talk of him at all, just now!’  It was agreeable to see the graceful figures of the blooming sisters, twined together, lingering among the trees, conversing thus, with earnestness opposed to lightness, yet, with love responding tenderly to love.  And it was very curious indeed to see the younger sister’s eyes suffused with tears, and something fervently and deeply felt, breaking through the wilfulness of what she said, and striving with it painfully.  The difference between them, in respect of age, could not exceed four years at most; but Grace, as often happens in such cases, when no mother watches over both (the Doctor’s wife was dead), seemed, in her gentle care of her young sister, and in the steadiness of her devotion to her, older than she was; and more removed, in course of nature, from all competition with her, or participation, otherwise than through her sympathy and true affection, in her wayward fancies, than their ages seemed to warrant.  Great character of mother, that, even in this shadow and faint reflection of it, purifies the heart, and raises the exalted nature nearer to the angels!  The Doctor’s reflections, as he looked after them, and heard the purport of their discourse, were limited at first to certain merry meditations on the folly of all loves and likings, and the idle imposition practised on themselves by young people, who believed for a moment, that there could be anything serious in such bubbles, and were always undeceived—always!  But, the home-adorning, self-denying qualities of Grace, and her sweet temper, so gentle and retiring, yet including so much constancy and bravery of spirit, seemed all expressed to him in the contrast between her quiet household figure and that of his younger and more beautiful child; and he was sorry for her sake—sorry for them both—that life should be such a very ridiculous business as it was.  The Doctor never dreamed of inquiring whether his children, or either of them, helped in any way to make the scheme a serious one.  But then he was a Philosopher.  A kind and generous man by nature, he had stumbled, by chance, over that common Philosopher’s stone (much more easily discovered than the object of the alchemist’s researches), which sometimes trips up kind and generous men, and has the fatal property of turning gold to dross and every precious thing to poor account.  ‘Britain!’ cried the Doctor.  ‘Britain!  Holloa!’  A small man, with an uncommonly sour and discontented face, emerged from the house, and returned to this call the unceremonious acknowledgment of ‘Now then!’  ‘Where’s the breakfast table?’ said the Doctor.  ‘In the house,’ returned Britain.  ‘Are you going to spread it out here, as you were told last night?’ said the Doctor.  ‘Don’t you know that there are gentlemen coming?  That there’s business to be done this morning, before the coach comes by? That this is a very particular occasion?’  ‘I couldn’t do anything, Dr. Jeddler, till the women had done getting in the apples, could I?’ said Britain, his voice rising with his reasoning, so that it was very loud at last.  ‘Well, have they done now?’ replied the Doctor, looking at his watch, and clapping his hands.  ‘Come! make haste! where’s Clemency?’  ‘Here am I, Mister,’ said a voice from one of the ladders, which a pair of clumsy feet descended briskly.  ‘It’s all done now.  Clear away, gals. Everything shall be ready for you in half a minute, Mister.’  With that she began to bustle about most vigorously; presenting, as she did so, an appearance sufficiently peculiar to justify a word of introduction.  She was about thirty years old, and had a sufficiently plump and cheerful face, though it was twisted up into an odd expression of tightness that made it comical.  But, the extraordinary homeliness of her gait and manner, would have superseded any face in the world.  To say that she had two left legs, and somebody else’s arms, and that all four limbs seemed to be out of joint, and to start from perfectly wrong places when they were set in motion, is to offer the mildest outline of the reality.  To say that she was perfectly content and satisfied with these arrangements, and regarded them as being no business of hers, and that she took her arms and legs as they came, and allowed them to dispose of themselves just as it happened, is to render faint justice to her equanimity.  Her dress was a prodigious pair of self-willed shoes, that never wanted to go where her feet went; blue stockings; a printed gown of many colours, and the most hideous pattern procurable for money; and a white apron.  She always wore short sleeves, and always had, by some accident, grazed elbows, in which she took so lively an interest, that she was continually trying to turn them round and get impossible views of them.  In general, a little cap placed somewhere on her head; though it was rarely to be met with in the place usually occupied in other subjects, by that article of dress; but, from head to foot she was scrupulously clean, and maintained a kind of dislocated tidiness.  Indeed, her laudable anxiety to be tidy and compact in her own conscience as well as in the public eye, gave rise to one of her most startling evolutions, which was to grasp herself sometimes by a sort of wooden handle (part of her clothing, and familiarly called a busk), and wrestle as it were with her garments, until they fell into a symmetrical arrangement.  Such, in outward form and garb, was Clemency Newcome; who was supposed to have unconsciously originated a corruption of her own Christian name, from Clementina (but nobody knew, for the deaf old mother, a very phenomenon of age, whom she had supported almost from a child, was dead, and she had no other relation); who now busied herself in preparing the table, and who stood, at intervals, with her bare red arms crossed, rubbing her grazed elbows with opposite hands, and staring at it very composedly, until she suddenly remembered something else she wanted, and jogged off to fetch it.  ‘Here are them two lawyers a-coming, Mister!’ said Clemency, in a tone of no very great good-will.  ‘Ah!’ cried the Doctor, advancing to the gate to meet them.  ‘Good morning, good morning!  Grace, my dear!  Marion!  Here are Messrs. Snitchey and Craggs.  Where’s Alfred!’  ‘He’ll be back directly, father, no doubt,’ said Grace.  ‘He had so much to do this morning in his preparations for departure, that he was up and out by daybreak.  Good morning, gentlemen.’  ‘Ladies!’ said Mr. Snitchey, ‘for Self and Craggs,’ who bowed, ‘good morning!  Miss,’ to Marion, ‘I kiss your hand.’  Which he did.  ‘And I wish you’—which he might or might not, for he didn’t look, at first sight, like a gentleman troubled with many warm outpourings of soul, in behalf of other people, ‘a hundred happy returns of this auspicious day.’  ‘Ha ha ha!’ laughed the Doctor thoughtfully, with his hands in his pockets.  ‘The great farce in a hundred acts!’  ‘You wouldn’t, I am sure,’ said Mr. Snitchey, standing a small professional blue bag against one leg of the table, ‘cut the great farce short for this actress, at all events, Doctor Jeddler.’  ‘No,’"]]]
