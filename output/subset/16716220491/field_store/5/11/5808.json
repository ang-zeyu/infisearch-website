EGGS AND CRUMBING  To do this successfully one must prepare a mixture, and not use the egg alone. If an egg mixture or a croquette is dipped in beaten egg and rolled in cracker crumbs and dropped into fat, it always has a greasy covering. This is the wrong way. To do it successfully and have the articles handsome, beat the egg until well mixed, add a teaspoonful of olive oil, a tablespoonful of water and a dash of pepper. Dip the articles into this mixture, and then drop them on quite a thick bed of either sifted dry bread crumbs or soft white bread crumbs.  I prefer sifted dry bread crumbs for croquettes, and soft white crumbs for lobster cutlets and deviled crabs.   SHIRRED EGGS  Cover the bottoms of individual dishes with a little butter and a few fresh bread crumbs; drop into each dish two fresh eggs; stand this dish in a pan of hot water and cook in the oven until the whites are \"set.\" Put a tiny bit of butter in the middle of each, and a dusting of salt and pepper.   EGGS MEXICANA  Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan. Add four tablespoonfuls of finely chopped onion and shake until the onion is soft, but not brown. Then add four Spanish peppers cut in strips, a dash of red pepper and a half pint of tomatoes; the tomatoes should be in rather solid pieces. Add a seasoning of pepper and salt. Let this cook slowly while you shir the desired quantity of eggs. When the eggs are ready to serve, put two tablespoonfuls of this sauce at each side of the dish, and send at once to the table.   EGGS ON A PLATE  Rub the bottom of a baking dish with butter. Dust it lightly with salt and pepper. Break in as many fresh eggs as required. Stand the dish in a basin of water and cook in the oven five minutes, or until the whites are \"set.\" While these are cooking, put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a pan and shake over the fire until it browns. When the eggs are done, baste them with the browned butter, and send to the table.   EGGS DE LESSEPS  Shir the eggs as directed. Have ready, carefully boiled, two sets of calves' brains; cut them into slices; put two or three slices between the eggs, and then pour over browned butter sauce.

This is also nice if you put a tablespoonful of the mixture in the bottom of the dish, break the egg into it, and then at serving time put another tablespoonful over the top.   EGGS AU MIROIR  Cover the bottom of a graniteware or silver platter with fresh bread crumbs, break in as many eggs as are needed for the number of persons to be served.

EGGS A LA TRINIDAD      6 eggs     2 lamb's kidneys     1 cupful of fresh bread crumbs     2 level tablespoonfuls of butter     2 level tablespoonfuls of flour   1/2 pint of stock     1 teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet   1/2 teaspoonful of salt     1 saltspoonful of pepper  Split the kidneys, cut out the tubes; scald them, drain, and cut them into thin slices.

FILLETS OF EGGS      6 eggs     4 tablespoonfuls of good stock   1/2 teaspoonful of salt     1 saltspoonful of pepper  Beat the eggs with the stock, add the salt and pepper.

Arrange the fillets in a platter on a napkin, one overlapping the other; garnish with parsley and send to the table with a boat of tomato or white sauce.   EGGS A LA SUISSE  Cover the bottom of a baking dish with about two tablespoonfuls of butter cut into bits. On top of this, very thin slices of Swiss cheese. Break over some fresh eggs. Dust with salt and pepper. To each half dozen eggs, pour over a half cup of cream. Then cover the top with grated Swiss cheese and bake in the oven until the cheese is melted and the eggs \"set.\" Send this to the table with a plate of dry toast.   EGGS WITH NUT-BROWN BUTTER  These eggs may be shirred or poached and served on toast. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a saute or frying pan.

When done, cut off the sides, scoop "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6429"],["title","Many Ways for Cooking Eggs (#2)"],["body","a portion of the potato, leaving a wall about a half inch thick. Mash the scooped-out portion, add to it a little hot milk, salt and pepper, and put it into a pastry bag. Put a little salt, pepper and butter into each potato and break in a fresh egg.

Break into each cup one egg. Pour over the remaining mixture. Stand the cups in a pan of hot water and bake in a moderate oven about five minutes.   EGGS STEAMED IN THE SHELL  Eggs put into hot water and kept away from the fire are much better than eggs actually boiled for only a short time. The greater the number of eggs to be cooked, the greater the amount of water that must be used. To cook four eggs, put them into a kettle, pour over them two quarts of water, cover the kettle and allow them to stand for ten minutes. Lift them from the water, put them into a large bowl, cover with boiling water, and send at once to the table. The whites will be coagulated, but should be soft and creamy, while the yolks will be perfectly cooked. If you should add six eggs to this volume of water, lengthen the time of standing. A single egg, dropped into a quart of water, must stand five minutes.   BIRDS' NESTS  Separate the eggs, allowing one to each person. Beat the whites to a stiff froth. Heap them into individual dishes, make a nest, or hole, in the center. Drop into this a whole yolk. Stand the dish in a pan of water, cover, and cook in the oven about two or three minutes. Dust lightly with salt and pepper, put a tiny bit of butter in the center of each, and send at once to the table. This is one of the most sightly of all egg dishes.   EGGS EN PANADE      2 eggs     6 slices of bread   1/2 cupful of milk or cream     4 tablespoonfuls of olive oil     1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley   1/2 teaspoonful of salt     1 saltspoonful of pepper  Trim the crusts from the bread. Beat the eggs until well mixed, but not light, then add the milk or cream, salt and pepper. Put the oil in a shallow frying pan, dip the slices of bread in the beaten egg and drop them into the hot oil; when brown on one side, turn and brown the other. Dish on a hot platter, dust with the chopped parsley and send at once to the table.   EGG PUDDING      6 eggs     6 slices of bread     1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley     2 tablespoonfuls of chopped chives     2 tablespoonfuls of butter     1 tablespoonful of flour   1/2 pint of milk   1/2 teaspoonful of salt     1 saltspoonful of white pepper  Break the eggs in a bowl, add all the seasoning. Rub the butter and flour together, add the milk, stir until boiling, and then add this to the eggs; beat together until thoroughly mixed. Crumb the bread, removing the crusts; stir this in at last. Turn into a buttered baking dish, cover with grated cheese, and bake in the oven until thoroughly \"set\" and a nice brown. It makes an exceedingly good, easily digested luncheon or supper dish for children.   EGGS A LA BONNE FEMME      1 Spanish or 2 Bermuda onions     2 level tablespoonfuls of butter     2 level tablespoonfuls of flour   1/2 pint of milk     6 eggs     1 teaspoonful of salt     1 saltspoonful of pepper   1/2 saltspoonful of grated nutmeg  Separate the whites and yolks of the eggs. Put the butter into a saucepan, add the onions, cut into _very thin_ slices; shake until the onions are soft, but not brown, then dust over the flour, mix, and add the milk, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Stir carefully until this reaches boiling point, then stand it on the back part of the stove where it will keep hot for at least ten minutes. Beat the yolks of the eggs until very creamy, then stir them into the sauce, take from the fire, and fold in the well-beaten whites of the eggs. Turn into a baking dish or casserole and bake in a hot oven fifteen minutes; serve at once.   TO POACH EGGS  Use a shallow frying pan partly filled with boiling water. The eggs must be perfectly fresh. The white of an egg is held in a membrane which seems to lose its tenacity after the egg is three days old. Such an egg, when dropped into boiling water, spreads out; that is, it does not retain its shape. When ready to poach eggs, take the required number to the stove. The water must be boiling hot, but not actually bubbling. Break an egg into a saucer, slide it quickly into the water, and then another and another. Pull the pan to the side of the stove, where the water cannot possibly boil. With a tablespoon, baste the water over the yolks of the eggs, if they happen to be exposed. They must be entirely covered with a thin veil of the white. Have ready the desired quantity of toast on a heated platter, lift each egg with a slice or skimmer, trim off the ragged edges and slide them at once on the toast. Dust with salt and pepper, baste with melted butter, and send to the table.
