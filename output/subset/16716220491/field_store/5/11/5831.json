I thought you knew enough to take in sail when you saw a squall comin'.\"  \"I should have taken in sail long ago if I had thought the captain didn't know enough to come on deck when there was a squall coming up,\" replied Lawry.  \"I don't want nothin' more of you.\"  \"And I don't want anything more of you,\" added Lawry smartly. \"I've got almost home.\"  \"What do you s'pose I'm goin' to do here, eighty mile from Whitehall, with the mainsail blowed clean out?\" snarled Captain John, as he followed Lawry.  \"Mind your vessel better than you have, I hope.\"  \"Don't be sassy, boy.\"  \"You needn't growl at me because you neglected your duty. I did mine. I was casting off the halyards when the squall came.\"  \"Why didn't you do it before? That's what I want to know.\"  \"I had no orders from the captain. Men on board a vessel don't take in sail till they are told to do so. When I saw the squall coming, half an hour ago, I let you know it; that was all I had to do with it.\"  \"I don't want you in this vessel; you are too smart for me,\" continued Captain John.  \"I'll leave her just as soon as we get to Port Rock,\" said Lawry, sitting down on the rail.  The rain ceased in a few moments, and the skipper ordered the jib, which had before been useless, to be set. At the invitation of Mrs. Captain John, Lawry went below and ate his dinner, to which he felt himself entitled, for he was working his passage up from Plattsburg. By the time he had disposed of the last piece of green-apple pie on board, the _Missisque_ was before Port Rock, which was the home of the young pilot, and he saw his father's ferry-boat at the shore as he came on deck.  \"Will you put me ashore here, Captain John?\" asked Lawry.  \"Yes, I will; and I'm glad to get rid of you,\" replied the captain testily.  \"I think I will land here, also,\" added the bank director. \"Now you have lost your sail, I'm afraid you won't get along very fast.\"  \"I don't expect I shall. I sha'n't get to Shoreham till to-morrow morning with this wind. I'm sorry it happened so; but that boy didn't mind what he was about.\"  \"The captain didn't mind what he was about,\" added Lawry. \"He needn't lay it to me, when it was all his own fault.\"  \"I will cross the lake, and get a horse at Pointville, so that I shall be in Shoreham by five o'clock,\" continued the bank director.  Captain John ordered one of the men to pull Mr. Randall and Lawry ashore in the boat, and in a few minutes they were landed at Port Rock.     CHAPTER II  THE PORT ROCK FERRY   Lawrence Wilford was a full-fledged water-fowl. From his earliest childhood he had paddled in Lake Champlain. His father had a small place, consisting of ten acres of land with a small cottage; but it was still encumbered with a mortgage, as it had been for twenty years, though the note had passed through several hands, and had been three times renewed. John Wilford was not a very sagacious nor a very energetic man, and had not distinguished himself in the race for wealth or for fame. He wanted to be rich, but he was not willing to pay the price of riches.  His place was a short distance from the village of Port Rock, and John Wilford, at the time he had purchased the land and built his house, had established a ferry, which had been, and was still, his principal means of support; for there was considerable travel between Port Rock and Pointville, on the Vermont side of the lake.  The ferryman was a poor man, and was likely to remain a poor man to the end of his life. Hardly a day passed in which he did not sigh to be rich, and complain of the unequal and unjust distribution of property. He could point to a score of men who had not worked half so hard as he had, in his own opinion, that had made fortunes, or at least won a competence, while he was as poor as ever, and in danger of having his place taken away from him. People said that John Wilford was lazy; that he did not make the most of his land, and that his ferry, with closer attention to the wants of passengers, might be made to pay double the amount he made from it. He permitted the weeds to grow in his garden, and compelled people to wait by the hour for a passage across the lake.  John Wilford wondered that he could not grow rich, that he could not pay off the mortgage on his place. He seldom sat down to dinner without grumbling at his hard lot. His wife was a sensible woman. She did not wonder that he did not grow rich; only that he contrived to keep out of the poorhouse. She was the mother of eight children, and if he had been half as smart as she was, prosperity would have smiled upon the family. As it was, her life was filled up with struggles to make the ends meet; but, though she had the worst of it, she did not complain, and did all she could to comfort and encourage her thriftless husband.  The oldest son was as near like his father as one person could be like another. He was eighteen years old, and was an idle and dissolute fellow. Lawrence, the second son, inherited his mother's tack and energy. He was observing and enterprising, and had already made a good reputation as a boatman and pilot. He had worked in various capacities on board of steamers, canal-boats, sloops, and schooners, and in five years had visited every part of the lake from Whitehall to St. Johns.  Speaking technically, his bump of locality was large, and he was as familiar with the navigation of the lake as any pilot on its waters. Indeed, he had occasionally served as a pilot on board steamers and other vessels, which had earned for him the name of the Young Pilot, by which he was often called. But his business was not piloting, for there was but little of this work to be done. Unlike his father, he was willing to do anything which would afford him a fair compensation, and in his five years of active life on the lake he had been a pilot, a deck-hand, a waiter, and a kitchen assistant on board steamers, and a sailor, helmsman, and cook on board other craft. He picked up considerable money, for a boy, by his enterprise, which, like a good son with a clear apprehension of domestic circumstances, he gave to his mother. At the time of his introduction to the reader, Lawry had just piloted a canal-boat, with movable masts, from Whitehall to Plattsburg, and was working his passage home on the \"_Missisque_.  \"Captain John feels bad about the loss of his sail,\" said Mr. Randall, as the sloop's boat pulled off from the shore.  \"Yes, he does; but it was his own fault,\" replied Lawry. \"He paid too much attention to his dinner at the time.\"  \"That's true; he was very fond of the green-apple pies.\"  \"Well, they were good,\" added the young pilot.  \"I'm sorry he lost his sail.\"  \"It wasn't worth much, though it was a bad time to lose it.\"  \"He lost his temper, too. I wanted to land on the other side, but the captain was so cross I didn't like to ask him when we were so close to this shore. Your father is the ferryman, I believe.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Will you ask him to take me over?\"  \"He's going right over in the large boat, for there's a team waiting for him,\" replied Lawry, pointing to a horse and wagon, the owner of which had sounded the horn just as the passengers from the boat landed.  \"Ask him to be as quick as possible, for I'm in a hurry,\" added the bank director.  \"Won't you come into the house, sir?\"  \"No, I will sit down under this tree.\"  Lawry went into the house, where the family were at dinner, the meal having been delayed by the absence of the ferryman on the other side of the lake. The youth was greeted coldly by his father, and very warmly by his mother.  \"I'm glad you've got home, Lawry, for Mr. Sherwood has been after you three times,\" said Mrs. Wilford, when the young pilot had been duly welcomed by all the family.  \"What does he want?\" asked Lawry.  \"His little steamboat is at Port Henry, and he wants you to go up and pilot her down.\"  \"The _Woodville?_\"  \"Yes, that's her name, I believe.\"  \"Well, I'm all ready to go.\"  \"Sit down and eat your dinner.  \"I've been to dinner.\"  \"Mr. Sherwood wanted you to go up in the _Sherman_; but it is too late for her, and he may go in the night boat.\"  \"I'm ready when he is. Father, there is a gentleman outside who wants to go over the lake; and there is a team waiting in the road,\" continued Lawry.  \"They must wait till I've done my dinner,\" replied the ferryman. \"Who is the gentleman?\"  \"Mr. Randall; he is a director in a bank, and has six thousand dollars with him.\"  \"I suppose so; every man but me has six thousand dollars in his pocket. Where's he going to?\"  \"To Shoreham, and he wants to get there by five o'clock, if he can.\"  \"What's he traveling with so much money for?\"  \"I don't know. It is in his coat pocket, and it would have gone overboard if it hadn't been for me.\"  The ferryman finished his dinner in moody silence. He seemed to be thinking of the subject always uppermost in his mind, his thoughts stimulated, no doubt, by the fact that his expected passenger carried a large sum of money on his person.  \"Mr. Randall is in a hurry, father,\" interposed Lawry, when the ferryman had sat a good half-hour after his son's arrival.  \"He must wait till I get ready. He's got money, and I haven't; but I'm just as good as he is. I don't know why I'm poor when so many men are rich. But I'm going to be rich, somehow or other,\" said he, with more earnestness than he usually exhibited. \"I'm too honest for my own good. I'm going to do as other men do; and I shall wake up rich some morning, as they do. Then I sha'n't have to go when folks blow the horn. They'll be willing to wait for me then.\"  \"Don't keep the gentleman waiting, father,\" added Mrs. Wilford.  \"I'm going to be rich, somehow or other,\" continued the ferryman, still pursuing the exciting line of thought he had before taken up. \"I'm going to be rich, by hook or by crook.\"  \"This making haste to get rich ruins men sometimes, husband; and haste"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6572"],["title","Haste and Waste; Or, the Young Pilot of Lake Champlain. A Story for Young People (#2)"],["body","waste then.\"  \"If I can only get rich, I'll risk being ruined,\" said John Wilford, as he rose from the table and put on his hat.  He looked more moody and discontented than usual. Instead of hastening to do the work which was waiting for him, he stood before the window, looking out into the garden. Mrs. Wilford told him the gentleman would be impatient, and he finally left the house and walked down to the ferry-boat.  \"I wonder what your father is thinking about,\" said Mrs. Wilford, as the door closed behind him.  \"I don't know,\" replied Lawry; \"he don't seem to be thinking that people won't wait forever for him. I guess I'll go up to Mr. Sherwood's, and see when he wants me.\"  \"You must fix up a little before you go,\" replied the prudent mother. \"They are very grand people up at Mr. Sherwood's, and you must look as well as you can.\"  \"I'll put on my best clothes,\" added Lawry.  In half an hour he had changed his dress, and looked like another boy. Mrs. Wilford adjusted a few stray locks of his hair, and as he put on his new straw hat, and left the house, her eye followed him with a feeling of motherly pride. He was a good boy, and had the reputation of being a very smart boy, and she may be pardoned for the parental vanity with which she regarded him. While he visits the house of Mr. Sherwood, we will follow his father down to the ferry, where the bank director was impatiently waiting his appearance.  After the shower the sun had come out brightly, and the wind had abated so that there was hardly breeze enough to ruffle the waters of the lake. It was intensely warm, and Mr. Randall had taken off his coat again, but he was careful to keep it on his arm. At the approach of the ferryman he went into the boat, where he was followed by the vehicle that had been waiting so long for a passage across the lake.  John Wilford pushed off the boat with a pole, and trimmed the sail, which was the motive power of the craft when there was any wind. The ferry-boat was a large bateau, or flatboat, the slope at the ends being so gradual that a wagon could pass down over it to the bottom of the boat. This inclined plane was extended by a movable platform about six feet wide, which swung horizontally up and down, like a great trap-door. When the ferry-boat touched the shore, this platform was let down upon the ground, forming a slope on which carriages were driven into and out of the bateau.  The wind was very light, and the clumsy craft moved very slowly--so slowly that the passage promised to be a severe trial to the patience of Mr. Randall, who hoped to reach Shoreham by five o'clock. He was not in a very amiable frame of mind; he was angry at the delay in starting, and he was vexed because the wind would not blow. He walked nervously from the forward platform to the after one, with his coat still on his arm.  \"We shall not get over to-night,\" said he impatiently, as he stopped by the side of the ferryman, and threw his coat down upon the platform, while he wiped the perspiration from his brow.  \"Yes, I guess we shall,\" replied John Wilford.  \"I'll give you a dollar if you will land me at Pointville by three o'clock.\"  \"I can't make the wind blow, if you would give me a hundred dollars.\"  \"Can't you use the pole or the oars?\" said the bank director petulantly; \"you kept me waiting half an hour before you started.\"  \"I couldn't help that,\" replied John Wilford.  Mr. Randall walked to the forward platform, fretting with impatience at the indifference of the ferryman. He stood for a few moments gazing at the Vermont shore, and appeared to be engaged in estimating the distance yet to be accomplished. The calculation was not satisfactory, and the bank director's wrath was on the increase. With hasty step he walked aft again.  \"I think we shall have more wind in a minute,\" said John Wilford, as he stepped down from the platform and adjusted the sheet.  \"If we don't, I shall go crazy,\" replied Mr. Randall.  When he had placed one foot on the platform, by some means the drop, true to its name, went down and splashed in the water. The bank director stepped back in season to save himself from a cold bath or a watery grave, as the case might be.  \"My coat! save my coat!\" shouted Mr. Randall, as the garment rolled off the platform into the water.  \"Why didn't you hold on to it?\" said John Wilford.  \"Save my coat! There is six thousand dollars in the pocket,\" groaned the unhappy bank director.     CHAPTER III  SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS   Within half a mile of the ferryman's cottage, at Port Rock, was the summer residence of Mr. Sherwood, who, two years before, had become the husband of Bertha Grant, of Woodville. The scenery in the vicinity was beautiful, and the mansion commanded a splendid view of the Adirondack Mountains and of the lake.  Mr. Sherwood was an enthusiastic admirer of the scenery of Lake Champlain. His constant visits at Woodville had given him a taste for aquatic sports, in which he was disposed to indulge on a larger scale than ever had been known at Woodville. He had been remarkably fortunate in his financial operations, and was already a wealthy man. Though he did not retire from active business, he had taken a partner, which enabled him to spend a part of his time during the summer at his country house on the lake.  Mr. Grant had gone to Europe a second time, to be absent during the summer, and Miss Fanny and Fanny Jane had accepted Bertha's invitation to spend a few weeks at Port Rock. A splendid time had been promised them by Mrs. Sherwood, who had made extensive preparations for their visit. The arrangements included a novelty which offered a very brilliant prospect to the party, and excited the imagination even of the older ones to the highest pitch.  This novelty was nothing less than a miniature steamboat, which had already been christened the _Woodville_, in honor of the home of the owner's lady. She was a splendid little craft, and as perfect in her machinery and appointments as any steamer that ever floated. She was a side-wheel boat, sixty feet in length, by twelve feet beam. Forward there were a regular wheel-house, a small kitchen, and other rooms usually found in a steamer. Abaft the wheels there were a saloon and two staterooms. Of course all these apartments, as well as the cabin below, were very contracted in their dimensions; but they were fitted up in the most elegant style.  The _Woodville_ had cost a great deal of money; but her owner expected to realize a full return for it in the enjoyment she would afford him, his wife, and their friends. She had been sent up the Hudson, and through the canal to Whitehall, and thence to Port Henry, where she had arrived on the day before Lawry Wilford's return to Port Rock.  On board of the little steamer there is an old friend of our readers. He may be found in the engine-room; and as he rubs up the polished iron of the machinery, he is thinking of Fanny Jane Grant, with whom he escaped from the Indians in Minnesota, and whom he expects on board with Mr. Sherwood's party. The young man, now sixteen years of age, is the engineer of the _Woodville_. Though he has been but two years learning the trade of machinist, he is as thoroughly acquainted with every part of a marine-engine as though he had spent his lifetime in studying it.  The engine of the _Woodville_ was built at the works where Ethan French was learning his trade, and he had been employed in its construction. As he was a frequent visitor at Woodville, he had petitioned for the situation he now held. At first, Mr. Sherwood was not willing to trust him; but Ethan's employers declared that he was a man in everything but years, and was fully competent to manage the engine, and even to build one after the designs were made. He had come up from New York in the steamer. He had seen Mr. Sherwood at Port Henry, on his arrival, and had been ordered to have the boat in readiness to start on the following morning, when the family would be passengers.  Mr. Sherwood had already selected Lawry Wilford as the pilot of the _Woodville_. He was small in stature, and would look better in the wheel-house than a full-grown man. He had often met the young pilot, and had been greatly pleased with his energy and decision. Lawry had been employed by Miss Fanny several times to row her on the lake; and he had served her so faithfully that her influence was not wanting in procuring for him the situation.  Lawry, not yet informed of the honorable and responsible position which had been awarded to him, walked up to Mr. Sherwood's house. He had heard Miss Fanny speak of the _Woodville_, while in the boat with him, and had listened with delight to her enthusiastic description of the beautiful craft. He was quite as anxious to see her as any of the party who were more directly interested in her.  \"Can I see Mr. Sherwood?\" asked Lawry.  \"He has gone away,\" replied the man.  \"Where has he gone?\"  \"To Port Henry; he went in the carriage, and is coming back in the new steamboat.\"  \"Has he got a pilot?\" continued Lawry anxiously.  \"I don't know; he expected you, I believe; but when you didn't come back, he couldn't wait any longer. I heard him say he could pilot her himself, and I suppose he is going to do so.\"  \"I'm sorry I didn't see him; I have but just got home,\" replied Lawry.  He wanted to pilot the beautiful little steamer up from Port Henry. He wanted to see her; wanted to make her acquaintance, for she promised to be the belle of the lake. He was sorry to lose the chance, for it might prove to be a valuable one to him. Mr. Sherwood was very liberal, and he hoped he would not engage another pilot. It was no use to complain, and Lawry walked back to the ferry, where he could see the steamer when she arrived. When he reached the landing-place, the ferry-boat was about halfway across the lake, and his attention was attracted by the strange movements of those on board of her. His father was laboring at the steering-oar with a zeal"]]]
