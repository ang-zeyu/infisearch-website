Come, mistress, there is your way--the world lies before you, so troop, thou antiquated Eve, thou original sin! Hold, yonder is some fellow skulking; perhaps it is Antonio--go to him, d'ye hear, and tell him to make you amends, and as he has got you turned away, tell him I say it is but just he should take you himself; go--[_Exit_ DONNA LOUISA.] So! I am rid of her, thank heaven! and now I shall be able to keep my oath, and confine my daughter with better security. [_Exit_].     SCENE V.-_The Piazza.  Enter_ DONNA CLARA _and_ MAID.   _Maid_. But where, madam, is it you intend to go?  _Don. Clara_. Anywhere to avoid the selfish violence of my mother-in- law, and Ferdinand's insolent importunity.  _Maid_. Indeed, ma'am, since we have profited by Don Ferdinand's key, in making our escape, I think we had best find him, if it were only to thank him.  _Don. Clara_. No--he has offended me exceedingly. [_Retires_].   _Enter_ DONNA LOUISA.  _Don. Louisa_. So I have succeeded in being turned out of doors--but how shall I find Antonio? I dare not inquire for him, for fear of being discovered; I would send to my friend Clara, but then I doubt her prudery would condemn me.  _Maid_. Then suppose, ma'am, you were to try if your friend Donna Louisa would not receive you?  _Don. Clara_. No, her notions of filial duty are so severe, she would certainly betray me.  _Don. Louisa_. Clara is of a cold temper, and would think this step of mine highly forward.  _Don. Clara_. Louisa's respect for her father is so great, she would not credit the unkindness of mine.  [DONNA LOUISA _turns and sees_ DONNA CLARA _and_ MAID.]  _Don. Louisa_. Ha! who are those? sure one is Clara--if it be, I'll trust her. Clara! [_Advances_.]  _Don. Clara_. Louisa! and in masquerade too!  _Don. Louisa_. You will be more surprised when I tell you, that I have run away from my father.  _Don. Clara_. Surprised indeed! and I should certainly chide you most horridly, only that I have just run away from mine.  _Don. Louisa_. My dear Clara! [_Embrace_.]  _Don. Clara_. Dear sister truant! and whither are you going?  _Don. Louisa_. To find the man I love, to be sure; and, I presume, you would have no aversion to meet with my brother?  _Don. Clara_. Indeed I should: he has behaved so ill to me, I don't believe I shall ever forgive him.  AIR.    When sable night, each drooping plant restoring,   Wept o'er the flowers her breath did cheer,    As some sad widow o'er her babe deploring,   Wakes its beauty with a tear;   When all did sleep whose weary hearts did borrow   One hour from love and care to rest,   Lo! as I press'd my couch in silent sorrow,   My lover caught me to his breast!   He vow'd he came to save me   From those who would enslave me!   Then kneeling,   Kisses stealing,   Endless faith he swore;   But soon I chid him thence,   For had his fond pretence   Obtain'd one favour then,   And he had press'd again,   I fear'd my treacherous heart might grant him more.  _Don. Louisa_. Well, for all this, I would have sent him to plead his pardon, but that I would not yet awhile have him know of my flight. And where do you hope to find protection?  _Don. Clara_. The Lady Abbess of the convent of St. Catherine is a relation and kind friend of mine--I shall be secure with her, and you had best go thither with me.  _Don. Louisa_. No; I am determined to find Antonio first; and, as I live, here comes the very man I will employ to seek him for me.  _Don. Clara_. Who is he? he's a strange figure.  _Don. Louisa_. Yes; that sweet creature is the man whom my father has fixed on for my husband.  _Don. Clara_. And will you speak to him? are you mad?  _Don. Louisa_. He is the fittest man in the world for my purpose; for, though I was to have married him to-morrow, he is the only man in Seville who, I am sure, never saw me in his life.  _Don. Clara_. And how do you know him?  _Don. Louisa_. He arrived but yesterday, and he was shown to me from the window, as he visited my father.  _Don. Clara_. Well, I'll begone.  _Don. Louisa_. Hold, my dear Clara--a thought has struck me: will you give me leave to borrow your name, as I see occasion?  _Don. Clara_. It will but disgrace you; but use it as you please: I dare not stay.--[_Going_.]--But, Louisa, if you should see your brother, be sure you don't inform him that I have taken refuge with the Dame Prior of the convent of St. Catherine, on the left hand side of the piazza which leads to the church of St. Anthony.  _Don. Louisa_. Ha! ha! ha! I'll be very particular in my directions where he may not find you.--[_Exeunt_ DONNA CLARA _and_ MAID.]--So! My swain, yonder, has, done admiring himself, and draws nearer. [_Retires_.]   _Enter_ ISAAC _and_ DON CARLOS.  _Isaac_. [_Looking in a pocket-glass_.] I tell you, friend Carlos, I will please myself in the habit of my chin.  _Don Car_. But, my dear friend, how can you think to please a lady with such a face?  _Isaac_. Why, what's the matter with the face? I think it is a very engaging face; and, I am sure, a lady must have very little taste who could dislike my beard.--[_Sees_ DONNA LOUISA.]--See now! I'll die if here is not a little damsel struck with it already.  _Don. Louisa_. Signor, are you disposed to oblige a lady who greatly wants your assistance? [_Unveils_.]  _Isaac_. Egad, a very pretty black-eyed girl! she has certainly taken a fancy to me, Carlos. First, ma'am, I must beg the favour of your name.  _Don. Louisa_. [_Aside_.] So! it's well I am provided.--[_Aloud_.]--My name, sir, is Donna Clara d'Almanza.  _Isaac_. What? Don Guzman's daughter? I'faith, I just now heard she was missing.  _Don. Louisa_. But sure, sir, you have too much gallantry and honour to betray me, whose fault is love?  _Isaac_. So! a passion for me! poor girl! Why, ma'am, as for betraying you, I don't see how I could get anything by it; so, you may rely on my honour; but as for your love, I am sorry your case is so desperate.  _Don. Louisa_. Why so, signor?  _Isaac_. Because I am positively engaged to another--an't I, Carlos?  _Don. Louisa_. Nay, but hear me.  _Isaac_. No, no; what should I hear for? It is impossible for me to court you in an honourable way; and for anything else, if I were to comply now, I suppose you have some ungrateful brother, or cousin, who would want to cut my throat for my civility--so, truly, you had best go home again.  _Don. Louisa_. [_Aside_.] Odious wretch!--[_Aloud_.]--But, good signor, it is Antonio d'Ercilla, on whose account I have eloped.  _Isaac_. How! what! it is not with me, then, that you are in love?  _Don. Louisa_. No, indeed, it is not.  _Isaac_. Then you are a forward, impertinent simpleton! and I shall certainly acquaint your father.  _Don. Louisa_. Is this your gallantry?  _Isaac_. Yet hold--Antonio d'Ercilla, did you say? egad, I may make something of this--Antonio d'Ercilla?  _Don. Louisa_. Yes; and if ever you wish to prosper in love, you will bring me to him.  _Isaac_. By St. Iago and I will too!--Carlos, this Antonio is one who rivals me (as I have heard) with Louisa--now, if I could hamper him with this girl, I should have the field to myself; hey, Carlos! A lucky thought, isn't it?  _Don Car_. Yes, very good--very good!  _Isaac_. Ah! this little brain is never at a loss--cunning Isaac! cunning rogue! Donna Clara, will you trust yourself awhile to my friend's direction?  _Don. Louisa_. May I rely on you, good signor?  _Don. Car_. Lady, it is impossible I should deceive you.  AIR.    Had I a heart for falsehood framed,   I ne'er could injure you;   For though your tongue no promise claim'd,   Your charms would make me true.   To you no soul shall bear deceit,   No stranger offer wrong;   But friends in all the aged you'll meet,   And lovers in the young.    But when they learn that you have blest   Another with your heart,   They'll bid aspiring passion rest,   And act a brother's part:   Then, lady, dread not here deceit,   Nor fear to suffer wrong;   For friends in all the aged you'll meet,   And brothers in the young.  _Isaac_. Conduct the lady to my lodgings, Carlos; I must haste to Don Jerome. Perhaps you know Louisa, ma'am. She's divinely handsome, isn't she?  _Don. Louisa_. You must excuse me not joining with you.  _Isaac_. Why I have heard it on all hands.  _Don. Louisa_. Her father is uncommonly partial to her; but I believe you will find she has rather a matronly air.  _Isaac_. Carlos, this is all envy.--You pretty girls never speak well of one another.--[_To_ DON CARLOS.] Hark ye, find out Antonio, and I'll saddle him with this scrape, I warrant. Oh, 'twas the luckiest thought! Donna Clara, your very obedient. Carlos, to your post.  DUET.  _Isaac_.   My mistress expects me, and I must go to her,   Or how can I hope for a smile?  _Don. Louisa_.   Soon may you return a prosperous wooer,   But think what I suffer the while.   Alone, and away from the man whom I love,   In strangers I'm forced to confide.  _Isaac_.   Dear lady, my friend you may trust, and he'll prove   Your servant, protector, and guide.  AIR.  _Don Car_.   Gentle maid, ah! why suspect me?   Let me serve thee--then reject me.   Canst thou trust, and I deceive thee?   Art thou sad, and shall I grieve thee?   Gentle maid, ah I why suspect me?   Let me serve thee--then reject me.  TRIO.  _Don. Louisa_.   Never mayst thou happy be,   If in aught thou'rt false to me.  _Isaac_.   Never may he happy be,   If in aught he's false to thee.  _Don Car_.   Never may I happy be,   If in aught I'm false to thee.  _Don. Louisa_.   Never mayst thou, &c.  _Isaac_.   Never may he, &c.  _Don Car_.   Never may I, &c. [_Exeunt_.]     ACT II.  SCENE I.--_A Library in_ DON JEROME'S _House_.  _Enter_ DON JEROME _and_ ISAAC.   _Don Jer_. Ha! ha! ha! run away from her father! has she given him the slip? Ha! ha! ha! poor Don Guzman!  _Isaac_.

It was therefore a very hazardous journey to travel by land from Athens to Peloponnesus; and Pittheus, giving him an exact account of each of these robbers and villains, their strength, and the cruelty they used to all strangers, tried to persuade Theseus to go by sea.  But he, it seems, had long since been secretly fired by the glory of Hercules, held him in the highest estimation, and was never more satisfied than in listening to any that gave an account of him; especially those that had seen him, or had been present at any action or saying of his.  So that he was altogether in the same state of feeling as, in after ages, Themistocles was, when he said that he could not sleep for the trophy of Miltiades; entertaining such admiration for the virtue of Hercules, that in the night his dreams were all of that hero's actions.  and in the day a continual emulation stirred him up to perform the like.  Besides, they were related, being born of cousins-german.  For Aethra was daughter of Pittheus, and Alcmena of Lysidice; and Lysidice and Pittheus were brother and sister, children of Hippodamia and Pelops.  He thought it therefore a dishonorable thing, and not to be endured, that Hercules should go out everywhere, and purge both land and sea from wicked men, and he himself should fly from the like adventures that actually came in his way; disgracing his reputed father by a mean flight by sea, and not showing his true one as good evidence of the greatness of his birth by noble and worthy actions, as by the tokens that he brought with him, the shoes and the sword.  With this mind and these thoughts, he set forward with a design to do injury to nobody, but to repel and revenge himself of all those that should offer any.  And first of all, in a set combat, he slew Periphetes, in the neighborhood of Epidaurus, who used a club for his arms, and from thence had the name of Corynetes, or the club-bearer; who seized upon him, and forbade him to go forward in his journey.  Being pleased with the club, he took it, and made it his weapon, continuing to use it as Hercules did the lion's skin, on whose shoulders that served to prove how huge a beast he had killed; and to the same end Theseus carried about him this club; overcome indeed by him, but now, in his hands, invincible.  Passing on further towards the Isthmus of Peloponnesus, he slew Sinnis, often surnamed the Bender of Pines, after the same manner in which he himself had destroyed many others before.  And this he did without having either practiced or ever learnt the art of bending these trees, to show that natural strength is above all art.  This Sinnis had a daughter of remarkable beauty and stature, called Perigune, who, when her father was killed, fled, and was sought after everywhere by Theseus; and coming into a place overgrown with brushwood shrubs, and asparagus- thorn, there, in a childlike, innocent manner, prayed and begged them, as if they understood her, to give her shelter, with vows that if she escaped she would never cut them down nor burn them.  But Theseus calling upon her, and giving her his promise that he would use her with respect, and offer her no injury, she came forth, and in due time bore him a son, named Melanippus; but afterwards was married to Deioneus, the son of Eurytus, the Oechalian, Theseus himself giving her to him. Ioxus, the son of this Melanippus who was born to Theseus, accompanied Ornytus in the colony that he carried with him into Caria, whence it is a family usage amongst the people called Ioxids, both male and female, never to burn either shrubs or asparagus-thorn, but to respect and honor them.  The Crommyonian sow, which they called Phaea, was a savage and formidable wild beast, by no means an enemy to be despised.  Theseus killed her, going out of his way on purpose to meet and engage her, so that he might not seem to perform all his great exploits out of mere necessity ; being also of opinion that it was the part of a brave man to chastise villainous and wicked men when attacked by them, but to seek out and overcome the more noble wild beasts.  Others relate that Phaea was a woman, a robber full of cruelty and lust, that lived in Crommyon, and had the name of Sow given her from the foulness of her life and manners, and afterwards was killed by Theseus.  He slew also Sciron, upon the borders of Megara, casting him down from the rocks, being, as most report, a notorious robber of all passengers, and, as others add, accustomed, out of insolence and wantonness, to stretch forth his feet to strangers, commanding them to wash them, and then while they did it, with a kick to send them down the rock into the sea.  The writers of Megara, however, in contradiction to the received report, and, as Simonides expresses it, \"fighting with all antiquity,\" contend that Sciron was neither a robber nor doer of violence, but a punisher of all such, and the relative and friend of good and just men; for Aeacus, they say, was ever esteemed a man of the greatest sanctity of all the Greeks; and Cychreus, the Salaminian, was honored at Athens with divine worship; and the virtues of Peleus and Telamon were not unknown to any one.  Now Sciron was son-in-law to Cychreus, father-in-law to Aeacus, and grandfather to Peleus and Telamon, who were both of them sons of Endeis, the daughter of Sciron and Chariclo; it was not probable, therefore, that the best of men should make these alliances with one who was worst, giving and receiving mutually what was of greatest value and most dear to them.  Theseus, by their account, did not slay Sciron in his first journey to Athens, but afterwards, when he took Eleusis, a city of the Megarians, having circumvented Diocles, the governor.  Such are the contradictions in this story.  In Eleusis he killed Cercyon, the Arcadian, in a wrestling match.  And going on a little farther, in Erineus, he slew Damastes, otherwise called Procrustes, forcing his body to the size of his own bed, as he himself was used to do with all strangers; this he did in imitation of Hercules, who always returned upon his assailants the same sort of violence that they offered to him; sacrificed Busiris, killed Antaeus in wrestling, and Cycnus in single combat, and Termerus by breaking his skull in pieces (whence, they say, comes the proverb of \"a Termerian mischief\"), for it seems Termerus killed passengers that he met, by running with his head against them. And so also Theseus proceeded in the punishment of evil men, who underwent the same violence from him which they had inflicted upon others, justly suffering after the manner of their own injustice.  As he went forward on his journey, and was come as far as the river Cephisus, some of the race of the Phytalidae met him and saluted him, and, upon his desire to use the purifications, then in custom, they performed them with all the usual ceremonies, and, having offered propitiatory sacrifices to the gods, invited him and entertained him at their house, a kindness which, in all his journey hitherto, he had not met.  On the eighth day of Cronius, now called Hecatombaeon, he arrived at Athens, where he found the public affairs full of all confusion, and divided into parties and factions, Aegeus also, and his whole private family, laboring under the same distemper; for Medea, having fled from Corinth, and promised Aegeus to make him, by her art, capable of having children, was living with him.  She first was aware of Theseus, whom as yet Aegeus did not know, and he being in years, full of jealousies and suspicions, and fearing every thing by reason of the faction that was then in the city, she easily persuaded him to kill him by poison at a banquet, to which he was to be invited as a stranger.  He, coming to the entertainment, thought it not fit to discover himself at once, but, willing to give his father the occasion of first finding him out, the meat being on the table, he drew his sword as if he designed to cut with it; Aegeus, at once recognizing the token, threw down the cup of poison, and, questioning his son, embraced him, and, having gathered together all his citizens, owned him publicly before them, who, on their part, received him gladly for the fame of his greatness and bravery; and it is said, that when the cup fell, the poison was spilt there where now is the enclosed space in the Delphinium; for in that place stood Aegeus's house, and the figure of Mercury on the east side of the temple is called the Mercury of Aegeus's gate.  The sons of Pallas, who before were quiet, upon expectation of recovering the kingdom after Aegeus's death, who was without issue, as soon as Theseus appeared and was acknowledged the successor, highly resenting that Aegeus first, an adopted son only of Pandion, and not at all related to the family of Erechtheus, should be holding the kingdom, and that after him, Theseus, a visitor and stranger, should be destined to succeed to it, broke out into open war.  And, dividing themselves into two companies, one part of them marched openly from Sphettus, with their father, against the city, the other, hiding themselves in the village of Gargettus, lay in ambush, with a design to set upon the enemy on both sides.  They had with them a crier of the township of Agnus, named Leos, who discovered to Theseus all the designs of the Pallantidae He immediately fell upon those that lay in ambuscade, and cut them all off; upon tidings of which Pallas and his company fled and were dispersed.  From hence they say is derived the custom among the people of the township of Pallene to have no marriages or any alliance with the people of Agnus, nor to suffer the criers to pronounce in their proclamations the words used in all other parts of the country, "]]]
