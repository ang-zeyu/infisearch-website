The philosopher exclaimed at once: 'The very thing!' and they whispered together, and called the girls and desired them to show what they could do.\"  \"And how did they perform?\"  asked the old man, who was growing excited.  \"Dada warbled like a lark, and Agne--well you know how it always is.  Her voice sounded lovely but it was just as usual.  You can guess how much there is in her and how deep her feeling is but she never quite brings it out.  What has she to complain of with us?  And yet whatever she sings has that mournful, painful ring which even you can do nothing to alter. However, she pleased them better than Dada did, for I noticed that Gorgo and the gentleman glanced at each other and at her, and whispered a word now and then which certainly referred to Ague.  When they had sung two songs the young lady came towards us and praised both the girls, and asked whether we would undertake to learn something quite new.  I told her that my father was a great musician who could master the most difficult things at the first hearing.\"  \"The most difficult!  Hm...  that depends,\" said the old man.  \"Did she show it you?\"  \"No; it is something in the style of Linus and she sang it to us.\"  \"The daughter of the rich Porphyrius sang for your entertainment? Yours?\"  said Karnis laughing.  \"By Sirius!  The world is turning upside down.  Now that girls are forbidden to perform to the gentlefolks, art is being cultivated by the upper classes; it cannot be killed outright.  For the future the listeners will be paid to keep quiet and the singers pay for the right of torturing their ears--our ears, our luckless ears will be victimized.\"  Orpheus smiled and shook his head; then, again dropping his knife, he went on eagerly:  \"But if you could only hear her!  You would give your last copper piece to hear her again.\"  \"Indeed!\"  muttered his father.  \"Well, there are very good teachers here.  Something by Linus did you say she sang?\"  \"Something of that kind; a lament for the dead of very great power: 'Return, oh! return my beloved, came back--come home!' that was the burthen of it.  And there was a passage which said: 'Oh that each tear had a voice and could join with me in calling thee!\"  And how she sang it, father!  I do not think I ever in my life heard anything like it. Ask mother.  Even Dada's eyes were full of tears.\"  \"Yes, it was beautiful,\" the mother agreed.  \"I could not help wishing that you were there.\"  Karnis rose and paced the little room, waving his arms and muttering:  \"Ah! so that is how it is!  A friend of the Muses.  We saved the large lute--that is well.  My chlamys has an ugly hole in it--if the girls were not asleep...  but the first thing to-morrow Ague...  Tell me, is she handsome, tall?\"  Herse had been watching her excitable husband with much satisfaction and now answered his question: \"Not a Hera--not a Muse--decidedly not. Hardly above the middle height, slightly made, but not small, black eyes, long lashes, dark straight eyebrows.  I could hardly, like Orpheus, call her beautiful. . .\"  \"Oh yes, mother.--Beautiful is a great word, and one my father has taught me to use but rarely; but she--if she is not beautiful who is?--when she raised her large dark eyes and threw back her head to bring out her lament; tone after tone seemed to come from the bottom of her heart and rise to the furthest height of heaven.  Ah, if Agne could learn to sing like that!  'Throw your whole soul into your singing.'--You have told her that again and again.  Now, Gorgo can and does.  And she stood there as steady and as highly strung as a bow, every note came out with the ring of an arrow and went straight to the heart, as clear and pure as possible.\"  \"Be silent!\" cried the old man covering his ears with his hands. \"I shall not close an eye till daylight, and then...  Orpheus, take that silver--take it all, I have no more--go early to market and buy flowers-- laurel branches, ivy, violets and roses.  But no lotuses though the market here is full of them; they are showy, boastful things with no scent, I cannot bear them.  We will go crowned to the Temple of the Muses.\"  \"Buy away, buy all you want!\"  said Herse laughing, as she showed her husband some bright gold pieces.  \"We got that to-day, and if all is well. . .\"  Here she paused, pointed to the curtain, and went on again in a lower tone: \"It all depends of course, on Agne's playing us no trick.\"  \"How so?  Why?  She is a good girl and I will. . .\"  \"No, no,\" said Herse holding him back.  \"She does not know yet what the business is.  The lady wants her. . .\"  \"Well?\"  \"To sing in the Temple of Isis.\"  Karnis colored.  He was suddenly called from a lovely dream back to the squalid reality.  \"In the Temple of Isis,\" he said gloomily.  \"Agne?  In the face of all the people?  And she knows nothing about it?\"  \"Nothing, father.\"  \"No?  Well then, if that is the case . . .  Agne, the Christian, in the Temple of Isis--here, here, where Bishop Theophilus is destroying all our sanctuaries and the monks outdo their master.  Ah, children, children, how pretty and round and bright a soap-bubble is, and how soon it bursts. Do you know at all what it is that you are planning?  If the black flies smell it out and it becomes known, by the great Apollo! we should have fared better at the hands of the pirates.  And yet, and yet.--Do you know at all how the girl...?\"  \"She wept at the lady's singing,\" interrupted Herse eagerly, \"and, silent as she generally is, on her way home she said: 'To sing like that!  She is a happy girl!'\"  Karnis looked up with renewed confidence.  \"Ah!\"  he exclaimed, \"that is my Agne.  Yes, yes, she truly loves her divine art.  She can sing, she will sing!  We will venture it, if you, I, all of us die for it!  \"Herse, Orpheus, what have we to lose?  Our gods, too, shall have their martyrs.  It is a poor life that has no excitement.  Our art--why, all I have ever had has been devoted to it.  I make no boast of having sacrificed everything, and if gold and lands were again to be mine I would become a beggar once more for the sake of art:  We have always held the divine Muse sacred, but who can keep up a brave heart when he sees her persecuted!  She may only be worshipped in darkness in these days, and the Queen of Gods and men shuns the light like a moth, a bat, an owl. If we must die let it be with and for Her!  Once more let pure and perfect song rejoice this old heart, and if afterwards . . .  My children, we have no place in this dim, colorless world.  While the Arts lived there was Spring on the earth.  Now they are condemned to death and it is Winter.  The leaves fall from all the trees, and we piping birds need groves to sing in.  How often already has Death laid his hand on our shoulder, every breath we draw is a boon of mercy--the extra length given in by the weaver, the hour of grace granted by the hangman to his victim!  Our lives are no longer our own, a borrowed purse with damaged copper coins.  The hard-hearted creditor has already bent his knuckles, and when he knocks the time is up.  Once more let us have one hour of pure and perfect enjoyment, and then we will pay up capital and interest when we must.\"  \"It cannot and will not be yet,\" said Herse resolutely, but she wiped her eyes with her band.  \"If Agne sings even, so long as she does it without coercion and of her own free-will no Bishop can punish us.\"  \"He cannot, he dare not!\"  cried  the old  man.  There are still laws and judges.\"  \"And Gorgo's family is influential as well as rich.  Porphyrius has power to protect us, and you do not yet know what a fancy he has taken to us. Ask mother.\"  \"It is like a story,\" Herse put in.  \"Before we left, the old lady--she must be eighty or more--took me aside and asked me where we were lodging. I told her at the Widow Mary's and when she heard it she struck her crutch on the floor.  'Do you like the place?' she asked.  I told her not at all, and said we could not possibly stop here.\"  \"Quite right!\"  cried Karnis.  \"The monks in the court-yard will kill us as dead as rats if they hear us learning heathen hymns.\"  \"That is what I told her; but the old lady did not allow me to finish; she drew me close to her and whispered, 'only do as my granddaughter wishes and you shall be safely housed and take this for the present'-- and she put her hand into the purse at her girdle, gave the gold into my hand, and added loud enough for the others to hear: 'Fifty gold pieces out of my own pocket if Gorgo tells me that she is satisfied with your performance.'\"  \"Fifty gold pieces!\"  cried Karnis clasping his hands.  \"That brightens up the dull grey of existence.  Fifty, then, are certain.  If we sing six times that makes a talent--[estimated in 1880 at $1100]--and that will buy back our old vineyard at Leontium.  I will repair the old Odeum--they have made a cowhouse of it--and when we sing there the monks may come and listen!  You laugh?  But you are simpletons--I should like to see who will forbid my singing on my own land and in my own country.  A talent of gold!  \"It is quite enough to pay on account, and I will not agree to any bargain that will not give me the field-slaves and cattle.  Castles in the air, do you say?  But just listen to me:  We are sure you see of a hundred gold pieces at least. . .\"  He had raised his voice in his eagerness and while he spoke the curtains had been softly opened, and the dull glimmer of the lamp which stood in front of Orpheus fell on a head which was charming in spite of its disorder.  A quantity of loose fair hair curled in papers stuck up all over the round head and fell over the forehead, the eyes were tired and still half shut, but the little mouth was wide awake and laughing with the frank amusement of light-hearted"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5501"],["title","Serapis — Volume 01 (#2)"],["body","th.  Karnis, without noticing the listener, had gone on with his visionary hopes of regaining his estates by his next earnings, but at this point the young girl, holding the curtain in her right hand, stretched out her plump left arm and begged in a humble whine:  \"Good father Karnis, give me a little of your wealth; five poor little drachmae!\"  The old man started; but he instantly recovered himself and answered good-naturedly enough:  \"Go back to bed, you little hussy.  You ought to be asleep instead of listening there!\"  \"Asleep?\"  said the girl.  \"While you are shouting like an orator against the wind!  Five drachmae, father.  I stick to that.  A new ribband for me will cost one, and the same for Agne, two.  Two I will spend on wine for us all, and that makes the five.\"  \"That makes four--you are a great arithmetician to be sure!\"  \"Four?\"  said Dada, as much amazed as though the moon had fallen.  \"If only I had a counting-frame.  No, father, five I tell you--it is five.\"  \"No, child, four; and you shall have four,\" replied her father.  \"Plutus is at the door and to-morrow morning you shall both have garlands.\"  \"Yes,  of violets, ivy and roses,\" added Dame Herse.  \"Is Agne asleep?\"  \"As sound as the dead.  She always sleeps soundly unless she lies wide awake all the night through.  But we were both so tired--and I am still. It is a comfort to yawn.  Do you see how I am sitting?\"  \"On the clothes-chest?\"  said Herse.  \"Yes, and the curtain is not a strong back to the seat.  Fortunately if I fall asleep I shall drop forwards, not backwards.\"  \"But there is a bed for each of you,\" said the mother, and giving the girl a gentle push she followed her into the sleeping-alcove.  In a few minutes she came out again.  \"That is just like Dada!\"  she exclaimed.  \"Little Papias had rolled off the chest on which he was sleeping, so the good girl had put him into her bed and was sitting on the chest herself, tired as she was.\"  \"She would do anything for that boy,\" said Karnis.  \"But it is past midnight.  Come, Orpheus, let us make the bed!\"  Three long hen-coops which stood piled against the wall were laid on the ground and covered with mats; on these the tired men stretched their limbs, but they could not sleep.  The little lamp was extinguished, and for an hour all was still in the dark room.  Then, suddenly, there was a loud commotion; some elastic object flew against the wall with a loud flap, and Karnis, starting up, called out: \"Get out--monster!\"  \"What is it?\"  cried Herse who had also been startled, and the old man replied angrily:  \"Some daemon, some dog of a daemon is attacking me and giving me no peace.  Wait, you villain--there, perhaps that will settle you,\" and he flung his second sandal.  Then, without heeding the rustling fall of some object that he had hit by accident, he gasped out:  \"The impudent fiend will not let me be.  It knows that we need Agne's voice, and it keeps whispering, first in one ear and then in the other, that I should threaten to sell her little brother if she refuses; but I-- I--strike a light, Orpheus!--She is a good girl and rather than do such a thing. . .\"  \"The daemon has been close to me too,\" said the son as he blew on the spark he had struck.  \"And to me too,\" added Herse nervously.  \"It is only natural.  There are no images of the gods in this Christian hovel.  Away, hateful serpent! We are honest folks and will not agree to any vile baseness.  Here is my amulet, Karnis; if the daemon comes again you must turn it round--you know how.\"     CHAPTER II.  Early next morning the singers set out for the house of Porphyrius.  The party was not complete, however, for Dada had been forced to remain at home.  The shoes that the old man had flung to scare away the daemon had caught in the girl's dress which she had just washed, and had dragged it down on to the earth; she had found it in the morning full of holes burnt by the ashes into the damp material.  Dada had no other presentable garment, so, in spite of her indignant refusal and many tears, she had to remain indoors with Papias.  Agne's anxious offers to stay in her place with the little boy and to lend Dada her dress, both Karnis and his wife had positively refused; and Dada had lent her aid--at first silently though willingly and then with her usual merriment--in twining garlands for the others and in dressing Agne's smooth black plaits with a wreath of ivy and violets.  The men were already washed, anointed and crowned with poplar and laurel when a steward arrived from Porphyrius to bid them follow him to his master's house.  But a small sacrifice was necessary, for the messenger desired them to lay aside their wreaths, which would excite ill-feeling among the monks, and certainly be snatched off by the Christian mob. Karnis when he started was greatly disappointed, and as much depressed as he had been triumphant and hopeful a short time before.  The monks, who had gathered outside the Xenodochium, glanced with scowling suspicion at the party, who could not recover the good spirits with which they had begun the day till they were fairly out of the narrow, gloomy alleys, reeking with tar and salt fish, that adjoined the harbor, and where they had to push their way through a dense throng.  The steward led the van with Herse, talking freely in reply to her enquiries.  His master, he said, was one of the great merchants of the city, whose wife had died twenty years since in giving birth to Gorgo.  His two sons were at present absent on their travels.  The old lady who had been so liberal in her treatment of the singers was Damia, the mother of Porphyrius.  She had a fine fortune of her own, and notwithstanding her great age was still respected as the soul of business in the household, and as a woman deeply versed in the mysterious sciences.  Mary, the pious Christian, who had founded the \"House of the Holy Martyr,\" was the widow of Apelles, the brother of Porphyrius, but she had ceased all intercourse with her husband's family.  This was but natural, as she was at the head of the Christian women of Alexandria, while the household of Porphyrius-- though the master himself had been baptized--was as thoroughly heathen as any in Alexandria.  Karnis heard nothing of all this, for he came last of the party.  Orpheus and Agne followed next to Herse and the steward, and after them came two slaves, carrying the lutes and pipes.  Agne walked with downcast eyes, as if she desired to avoid seeing all that surrounded her, though when Orpheus addressed her she shyly glanced up at him and answered briefly and timidly.  They presently came out of an obscure alley by the canal connecting Kibotus with Lake Mareotis where the Nile-boats lay at anchor. Karnis drew a deeper breath, for here the air was clear and balmy; a light northerly breeze brought the refreshing fragrance of the sea, and the slender palm-trees that bordered the canal threw long shadows mingling with the massive shade of the sycamores.  The road was astir with busy groups, birds sang in the trees, and the old musician drank in the exciting and aromatic atmosphere of the Egyptian Spring with keen enjoyment.  As they reached the middle of the steep bridge across the canal he involuntarily stood still, riveted by the view of the southwest.  In his excitement he threw up his arms, his eyes glistened with moisture and with the enthusiasm of youth, and, as was always the case when his emotions were stirred by some glorious work of God or man, an image rose to his mind, all unbidden--the image of his eldest son, now dead, but in life his closest and most sympathetic comrade.  He felt as though his hand could grasp the shoulder of that son, too early snatched away, whose gifts had far transcended those of the surviving Orpheus--as though he too could gaze with him on the grand scene that lay before him.  On a platform of rocks and mighty masonry rose a structure of wonderful magnificence and beauty, so brilliantly illuminated by the morning sun that its noble proportions and gorgeous colors showed in dazzling splendor and relief.  Over the gilt dome bent the cloudless blue of the African sky, and the polished hemisphere shone, as radiant as the sun whose beams it reflected.  Sloping planes for vehicles, and flights of steps for pedestrians led up to the gates.  The lower part of this wonderful edifice--the great Temple of Serapis--was built to stand forever, and the pillars of the vestibule supported a roof more fitted to the majesty of the gods than to the insignificance of mortals; priests and worshippers moved here like children among the trunks of some gigantic forest.  Round the cornice, in hundreds of niches, and on every projection, all the gods of Olympus and all the heroes and sages of Greece seemed to have met in conclave, and stood gazing down on the world in gleaming brass or tinted marble.  Every portion of the building blazed with gold and vivid coloring; the painter's hand had added life to the marble groups in high relief that filled the pediments and the smaller figures in the long row of metopes.  All the population of a town might have found refuge in the vast edifice and its effect on the mind was like that of a harmonious symphony of adoration sung by a chorus of giants.  \"All hail!  Great Serapis!  I greet thee in joyful humility, thankful that Thou hast granted to my old eyes to see Thy glorious and eternal temple once again!\"  murmured Karnis in devout contemplation.  Then, appealing to his wife and son, he pointed in silence to the building. Presently, however, as he watched Orpheus gazing in speechless delight at its magnificent proportions he could not forbear.  \"This,\" he began with fervid enthusiasm, \"is the stronghold of Serapis the King of the Gods!  A work for all time.  Its youth has lasted five hundred years, its future will extend to all eternity.--Aye, so it is; and so long as it endures in all its glory the old gods cannot be deposed!\"  \"No one"]]]
