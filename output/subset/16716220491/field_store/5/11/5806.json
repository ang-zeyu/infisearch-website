Ain't you green, though! You're green as that grass there,\" and she spun round and round, snapping her fingers all the while.  Phronsie stood quite still and regarded her sorrowfully.  \"Don't you believe I cried!\" screamed the girl, dashing up to her, to snap her fingers in Phronsie's face; \"say you don't this minute.\"  \"But I think you did,\" said Phronsie. \"Oh. I'm very sure you did, and you may hold my child again, if you only won't cry any more,\" and she clasped her hands tightly together. The other girl started and ran toward the big iron gate.  \"Oh, don't!\" Phronsie called after her, and ran to overtake the flying feet. \"Please stay with me. I like you; don't go.\"  The girl threw her head back as if something hurt her throat, then leaned her face against the iron railings and stuck her fingers in her ears.  \"Don't! lemme alone! go 'way, can't you!\" She wriggled off from Phronsie's fingers. \"I'll lick you if you don't lemme be!\"  \"I wish you'd play with me,\" said Phronsie, having hard work to keep out of the way of the flapping shoes all down at the heel, \"and you may have Clorinda for your very own child as long as you stay--you may really.\"  \"Ow! see here!\" Up came the girl's face, and with a defiant sweep of her grimy hands she brushed both cheeks. \"Do you mean that, honest true, black and blue?\"  \"Yes,\" said Phronsie, very much relieved to see the effect of her invitation, \"I do mean it, little girl. Come, and I'll tell Clorinda all how it is.\"  \"I'm goin' outside to walk up and down a bit. Bring on your doll.\"  \"But you must come here,\" said Phronsie, moving off slowly backward over the grass. \"Come, little girl\"--holding out her hand.  \"Now I know you didn't mean it,\" said the girl scornfully. \"You wouldn't let me touch that nasty old doll of yours again for nothin' you wouldn't,\" she shrilled at her.  \"Oh, yes, I would,\" declared Phronsie, in great distress; \"see, I'm going to get her now,\" and she turned around and hurried over the grass to pick Clorinda off from her resting-place and run back. \"There, see, little girl,\" she cried breathlessly, thrusting the doll into the dirty hands; \"take her now and we'll go and play.\"  For answer, the girl clutched the doll and sped wildly off through the gateway.  \"Oh!\" cried Phronsie, running after with pink cheeks and outstretched arms, \"give me back my child; stop, little girl.\"  But there wras no stop to the long, thin figure flying down the path on the other side of the tall hedge. It was a back passage, and few pedestrians used the path; in fact, there were none on it this afternoon, so the children had it all to themselves. And on they went, Phronsie, with but one thought--to rescue her child from the depths of woe such as being carried off by a strange mother would produce--blindly plunging after.  At last the girl with the doll stopped suddenly, flung herself up against a stone fence, and drew a long breath.  \"Well, what you goin' to do about it?\" she cried defiantly, clutching the doll with a savage grip.  Phronsie, too far gone for words, sank panting down to the curbstone, to watch her with wild eyes.  \"You said I might take her,\" the girl blurted out. \"I hain't took nothin' but what you give me. I want to play with her to my home. You come with me, and then you can take her back with you.\"  \"I can't,\" said Phronsie, in a faint little voice. Her cheeks were very red, and she wiped her hot face on her white apron. \"You must give me Clorinda, and I must go home,\" and she held out a shaking hand.  But the girl danced off, and Phronsie, without a thought beyond the rescue of her child, stumbled on after her, scarcely seeing one step before her for the tears that, despite all her efforts, now began to stream down her round cheeks.  At last, in trying to turn out for a baker's boy with a big basket, she caught her foot and fell, a tired little heap, flat in a mud puddle in the middle of the brick pavement.  \"My eye!\" cried the baker's boy, lifting her up. \"Here, you girl, your sister's fell, ker-squash!\"  At this, the flying girl in front whirled suddenly and came running back, and took in the situation at once.  \"Come on, you lazy thing, you!\" she exclaimed; then she burst into a laugh. \"Oh, how you look!\"  \"Give me back--\" panted Phronsie, rubbing away the tears with her muddy hands, regardless of her splashed clothes and dirty shoes.  \"Keep still, can't you?\" cried the girl, gripping her arm, as two or three pedestrians paused to stare at the two. \"Come on, sister,\" and she seized Phronsie's hand, and bore her off. But on turning the corner, she stopped abruptly, and, still holding the doll closely, she dropped to one knee and wiped off the tears from the muddy little cheeks with a not ungentle hand. \"You've got to be my sister,\" she said, in a gush, \"else the hoodlums will tear you from neck to heels.\" And seizing Phronsie's hand again, she bore her off, dodging between rows of dwellings, that, if her companion could have seen, would have certainly proved to be quite novel. But Phronsie was by this time quite beyond noticing any of the details of her journey, and after turning a corner or two, she was hauled up several flights of rickety steps, strange to say without the usual accompaniment of staring eyes and comments of the various neighbors in the locality.  \"There!\" The girl, still clutching the doll, flung wide the rickety door. \"My, ain't I glad to get here, though!\" and she drew a long breath, releasing Phronsie's hand, who immediately slid to the floor in a collapsed little heap. \"Well, this is my home--ain't it pretty, though!\"  Phronsie, thus called on for a reply, tried very hard to answer, but the words wouldn't come.  \"You needn't try,\" said the girl, slamming the door, \"'tain't likely you can praise it enough,\" and she broke out into a hard, sarcastic laugh, which shrilled its way out of the one window, whose broken glass was adorned with nondescript fillings.  \"See here now, you're all beat out,\" she exclaimed suddenly; then rushing across the room, she dragged up a broken chair, and jammed it against the door. \"There now, we're by ourselves, an' you can rest.\"  \"I must go home,\" said Phronsie faintly, and holding up her tired arms. \"Give me my child; I must go home.\"  \"Did you think I didn't know what was proper?\" cried the girl scornfully, and tossing her head. \"I'm going to have five-o'clock tea 'fore you go. There, I'm a lady, an' a swell one too, I'd have you know.\"  She ran over to the corner of the slatternly room, and set the doll on a bed, over which were tossed the clothes in a dirty heap, Phronsie following every movement with anxious eyes.  \"Now she's my child, remember,\" she said, turning her sharp, black eyes on the small figure huddled up on the floor, \"as long as she stays here.\"  Then she hurried about, twitching a box out here and there from a cupboard, whose broken door hung by one hinge.  \"Here's my silver spoons--ain't they beautiful!\" she cried, running up with a few two-tined forks and a bent and battered knife. These she placed, also the cracked cups, with great gusto, on the rickety table, propped for support against the wall, as one of its legs was gone entirely and another on the fair road to departure.  \"'Tain't stylish to have yer table agin the wall,\" she broke out, \"at a five-o'clock tea; I know, 'cause I've peeked in the windows up on the avenoo, an' I've seen your folks, too.\" She nodded over at Phronsie. \"I know what I'll do.\" She tossed her head with its black, elfish locks, and darted off in triumph, dragging up from another corner a big box, first unceremoniously dumping out the various articles, such as dirty clothes, a tin pan or two, a skillet, an empty bottle--last of all, a nightcap, which she held aloft. \"Gran's,\" she shouted; \"it's been lost a mighty long time. Now I'm goin' to wear it to my five-o'clock tea. It's a picter hat, same's that lady had on to your house once--I seen her.\" She threw the old nightcap over her hair, tied the ragged strings with an air, and soon, by dint of pulling and hauling, had the table in the very center of the apartment, the box securely under its most delicate and unreliable portion.  \"There--my! ain't we fine, though!\" She surveyed her work with great delight, her hands on her hips. \"Now, says I, for our ice cream an' cake, with white on top, an' choc'late.\"  She gave a flirt of her ragged gown and darted here and there with her elfish movements; and presently a cold potato, shivering in its skin, a slice or two of hard, moldy bread, and some turnips and carrots, uncooked, were set about the dirty table, with empty spools in between. \"Them's the flowers,\" she explained, as she put the last-mentioned articles in their places. \"Now it's all ready, except the choc'late.\" And waving an old tin coffeepot, whose nose was a thing of the past, she filled it at the faucet over the wooden sink, and put it down with a flourish at one end of the table. \"Now we're ready, an' I'm the beautiful lady up to your house--I seen her, once when I was peekin' through the fence\"--she nodded shrewdly, her little eyes snapping--\"her an' your sister.\"  [Illustration: Five O'Clock Tea]  \"Oh, I want Polly,\" broke out Phronsie, with such a wail, as she sat, a frozen little heap, not daring to stir, that the girl screamed out:  \"Well, I'm goin' to take you to her, when I've given you my five-o'clock tea; that is, if you don't cry. An' I ain't goin' to be the beautiful lady up at your house; I'll be Mrs. somebody else. No, I'll be a Dukess--the Dukess of Marlbrer--I've seen her in the paper. Oh, you've got to have the best chair,\" and she dragged up the sole article of furniture of that name, minus its back, away from the door; then"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6418"],["title","Five Little Peppers and their Friends (#2)"],["body"," Phronsie up from the floor, she wiped off the tears on her pinafore, no longer white, and soon had her installed on it. \"Now you're comp'ny.\" Thereupon she ran and fetched the doll from the bed, and put her on a small, old barrel, from which the articles were dumped out, and, with a box for her back, Clorinda was soon in great state on one side of the feast. The Dukess then slipped into her own seat, an inverted tub, somewhat low, to be sure, but still allowing the view of the festive cup to be seen. \"She's my child, now. Will you have some choc'late?\"--with a winning smile that ran all over her dirty face and wrinkled it up alarmingly.  \"Oh, no, she's my child,\" protested Phronsie, the tears beginning again.  \"I mean till I get through my five-o'clock tea,\" cried the girl; \"can't you understand? Then she'll be yours, an' I'll take you home. Will you have choc'late?--you must, Lady--what's your name, anyway?\" she demanded abruptly, bringing her black eyes to bear on Phronsie.  Phronsie could hardly stammer it out for the tears she was choking back.  \"Oh, my eye, what a name!\" laughed the Dukess, in derision. \"Well, you can be Lady Funsie--Fornsie--whatever you call it. Now, will you have some choc'late? 'Taint perlite not to answer.\"  \"I'd rather have some milk,\" said Phronsie faintly, \"if you please.\"  \"Oh, 'tain't no trouble,\" said the Dukess airily, quirking out her little finger with grace; and poising the tin coffeepot with an elegant air, she inverted it over a cracked cup, which, when generously full of water, she passed to her guest. \"Help yourself to th' cakes. Lady Fonsie,\" she said graciously, \"an' what beyewtiful weather we are havin'!\"  Phronsie put forth a trembling hand, as it seemed to be expected of her, and took the cup of water, spilling about half of it, which ran off the table-edge and down her little brown gown, the Dukess greeting this mishap with a shout of laughter, checking it suddenly with a start and a dismayed glance in the direction of the broken window.  \"It's time fer you to talk some,\" she said. \"You should say, 'Yes, I think so, too.'\"  \"I think so, too,\" murmured Phronsie, viewing her cup of milk gravely.  \"An' you must say, 'I think, Dukess, you have the most splendid milk.'\"  \"It isn't milk,\" said Phronsie gravely, and she turned serious eyes on the lady of quality opposite.  \"Oh, yes, it is,\" said the Dukess, \"an' you orter go on an' say, 'An' all them perfectly beyewtiful flowers, I never see any so fine!'\"--pointing to the empty spools in between the eatables.  \"But they aren't flowers,\" said Phronsie.  This occasioned so much discussion that there was no lack of conversation, and was the reason that steps over the stairway were not heard. The door was thrown open, and an old, stout, sodden woman, in a dirty, green shawl and battered bonnet stood transfixed with amazement in the entrance. She hadn't a pleasant eye beneath her straggling, white hair, and her first words were not altogether agreeable nor appropriate at five-o'clock tea.  \"So this is the way,\" she said gruffly, \"when I sends you out, Rag, to pick up somethin' you eat me out o' house an' home with brats you bring in\"; for she hadn't seen through the dirt on Phronsie's face and clothes what manner of child was present.  The Dukess twitched off the nightcap, and sprang up, upsetting the tin coffeepot, which rolled away by itself, and put herself over by Phronsie, covering her from view. In passing, she had grasped the doll off from the barrel and hidden her in the folds of her tattered gown with a quick, sharp thrust.  \"'Tain't nothin' 'f I do have some fun once in a while, Gran,\" she grumbled. She pinched Phronsie's arm. \"Keep still.\" And while the old woman swayed across the room, for she wasn't quite free from the effects of a taste from a bottle under her arm, which she couldn't resist trying before she reached home, Phronsie and Rag were working their way over toward the door.  \"Stop!\" roared the old woman at them, in a fury, and she held up the nightcap. Involuntarily Rag paused, through sheer force of habit, and stood paralyzed, till her grandmother had come quite close.  \"Hey, what have we got here?\" She eyed Phronsie sharply. \"Oh, well, you ain't acted so badly after all; maybe the pretty little lady has come to see me, hey?\" and she seized Phronsie's small arm.  \"Gran,\" cried Rag hoarsely, waking up from her unlucky paralysis, \"let her go; only let her go, an' I'll--I'll do anythin' you want me to. I'll steal, an' pick an' fetch, and do anything Gran.\"  The old woman leered at her, and passed her hand to the beads on Phronsie's neck; and in doing so she let the little arm slip, that she might use both hands to undo the clasp the better. One second of time--but Rag, knowing quite well what could be done in it, seized Phronsie, rushed outside, slammed the door, and was down over the rickety stairs in a twinkling, through the dirty courtyard and alley--which luckily had few spectators, and those thought she was carrying a neighbor's child--around a corner, darting here and there, till presently she set Phronsie down, and drew a long breath.  \"Oh, my eye!\" she panted, \"but wasn't that a close shave, though!\"     II  PHRONSIE   \"There now, here you are!\" There was a little click in the girl's throat. Phronsie looked up.  \"Yes, and your child, too.\" Clorinda and all her pink loveliness was thrust into her own little mother's arms, and the sharp, black eyes peered down upon the two. \"I've brung you home, and you're on your own grassplot, same's you were.\" Still she stood in her tracks.  \"I'm sorry I brung you to my house; but you've had a five-o'clock tea, and now you're home, an' got your child.\" Still she did not stir.  \"Well, I've got to go. Say, don't you call no one, nor tell no one, till I've had time to shake my feet down street.\" She thrust out one flapping shoe, then the other, gave a scornful laugh, and brushed her hand across the sharp eyes. \"Promise now, black and blue, 'I promise true, hope to die if I do'. Hurry up! Do you promise?\" she cried sharply.  \"Yes,\" said Phronsie, hugging Clorinda tightly.  \"All right. Now for Gran!\" She shut her teeth tightly and was off and through the big gateway.  \"I've got my child,\" said Phronsie, putting up a sleepy hand to pat Clorinda's head, but it fell to her side, while her yellow hair slipped closer over her flushed cheek. She tried to say, \"Clorinda, we've got home, and my foots are tired,\" swayed, held her child tighter to her bosom, and over she went in a heap, fast asleep before her head touched the soft grass.  Polly Pepper, hurrying home from Alexia's, ran in by the gateway, and down by a short cut over the grass, her feet keeping time to a merry air that had possessed her all the afternoon. \"How fine,\" she cried to herself, \"our garden party will be!--and we've gotten on splendidly with our fancy things this afternoon. It will be too perfectly elegant for--\" the flying feet came to a standstill that nearly threw her over the sleeping figure, the doll tightly pressed to the dirty little pinafore and the flushed cheeks.  \"Oh, my goodness me!\" cried Polly, down on her knees. \"Why, Phronsie, just look at your pinafore!\" But Phronsie had no idea of looking at anything, and still slept on.  \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Polly, in consternation, \"whatever in the world has she been doing! Well, I must get her up to the house.\"  \"Hullo!\" It was Jasper's voice. Polly flew up to her feet and hulloed back. He took a short cut, with a good many flying leaps, across the grass. \"Oh, Polly, I've been looking for you!\"  \"Just see there.\" cried Polly, pointing tragically to the little heap.  \"Well, dear me!\" said Jasper. \"Why, Polly\"--as his eyes fell on the soiled pinafore and the little face where the tears had made muddy streaks.  \"I know it,\" said Polly. \"Did you ever in all this world, Jasper! What do you suppose she has been doing?\"  \"Oh, making mud pies, perhaps,\" said Jasper, unwilling to worry Polly; \"don't look so, Polly. Here, we'll carry her to the house.\"  \"Lady-chair,\" said Polly, the worry dropping out of her eyes at the fun of carrying Phronsie in. But Phronsie was beyond the charms of \"lady-chair\" or \"pick-a-back,\" her yellow head bobbing so dismally when they lifted her up, that Jasper at last picked her up in his arms, and marched off with her.  \"You bring the doll, Polly.\"  So Polly ran along by his side with Clorinda dangling by one arm.  Mother Fisher said never a word when she received her baby, but wisely soothed and washed and tucked her away in bed; and little Doctor Fisher, as soon as he got home, viewed her critically through his big spectacles, and said, \"The child is all right. Let her sleep.\" Which she did, until every one of the household, creeping in and out, declared she could not possibly sleep any longer, and that they must wake her up. This last was from Polly.  \"What do you suppose it is, Mamsie?\" she asked, for about the fiftieth time, hanging over Phronsie's little bed.  \"Nothing,\" said Mrs. Fisher, with firm lips. Polly must not be worried by unnecessary alarm, and really there seemed to be nothing amiss with Phronsie, who was sleeping peacefully, with calm little face and even breath. \"It's the best thing for her to sleep till she's rested.\"  \"But what could have tired her so?\" said Polly, with a puzzled face.  \"That's just what we can't find out now,\" said her mother, diving into her basket for another of Van's stockings. \"Oh, here is the mate. When she wakes up, she'll tell us.\"  \"Well, Joanna is going, isn't she, Mamsie?\" asked Polly, deserting the little bed to fling herself down on the floor at Mrs. Fisher's feet, to watch the busy fingers.  \"Yes, she is,\" said Mother Fisher decidedly.  \"I'm so very glad of that,\" said Polly, with a sigh of relief, \"because you know, Mamsie, she might go off again and leave Phronsie when she ought to be watching her.\"  \"Say no more about it, Polly,\" said her mother, setting even, firm"]]]
