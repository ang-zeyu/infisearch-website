But by the same taken, it cannot be known until you call your court together so that it may be heard by all.\"  \"Then mean you, kind Merlin, that we must call not only those of the Round Table but all other knights and even pages and squires?\"  \"Even so, sire. And yet, since Whitsunday is but a few days away, that should be no hard matter. For the knights of your court, except Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine are here, prepared for such tourneys and feasts fit to celebrate that day.\"  \"So then shall it be. Even now our heralds shall announce that we crave the attendance of all those who pledge loyalty to our court. For I know well that they must be of no mean import, these things we shall hear. We pray only that they shall be for our good fortune.\"  The Wizard, making no reply, bent low and kissed his King's hand. Then he departed.  Came now his herald whom the King had summoned.  \"See to it that our court assembles this time tomorrow. Make far and distant outcry so that all who are within ear may hear and so hurry to our call. And mark you this well. We would hare Sir Launcelot and our own nephew, Sir Gawaine, present even though they departed this early morn for Cornwall. See you to it.\"  Swiftly the herald made for the door to carry out the commands of his King. But even as he reached it, Arthur called again to him.  \"We have a fancy, good herald, we fain would have you follow. Ask then Sir Percival to let us have the services of his page who seems a likely youth and bid this youth go hence after the two absent knights, Sir Gawaine and Sir Launcelot and give to them our message, beseeching their return. Tell not the boy it is we who have asked that he go.\"  \"It shall be done as you will, sire,\" replied the herald. No surprise did he show at the strangeness of the King's command for long had he been in his service and well he knew the King's strange fancies.  Sir Percival gave ready consent, when found. So when the boy had returned from the errand forespoken, the herald announced that he must hasten after the two knights and bid them return.  \"And by my faith, lad, you have but little time and you must speed well. For tomorrow at this time is this conclave called, and the two knights are already many miles on their journey. Take you this horse and hasten.\"  Then, as the eager youth, quick pulsed, made haste to obey, the herald added in kindly voice: \"It would be well could you succeed, lad. For it is often true that through such missions, newcomers prove future worthiness for knighthood.\"  \"I thank you greatly for your kindness,\" replied the boy. \"I can but try to the uttermost. No rest shall I have until I meet with the two knights.\"  So now Allan sought out and bespoke his own lord.  \"I wish you well, Allan,\" said Sir Percival. \"And say you to my friends Launcelot and Gawaine should they prove reluctant that they will favor their comrade, Sir Percival, if they would make haste and hurry their return. Stop not to pick quarrel nor to heed any call, urgent though it may seem. Prove my true page and worthy.\"  \"I shall do my very best, my lord. And, this my first commission, shall prove successful even though to make it so, I perish.\"  Swiftly now rode forth the boyish figure. Well, too, had Arthur chosen. Came a day when, than Allan, no braver, truer knight there was. But of that anon.     CHAPTER THREE  A Combat   \"Good Launcelot, I trust that good fortune shall be with us and that our adventures be many and the knights we meet bold and brave.\"  \"Of that, Gawaine, we need have no fear. For adventure ever follows where one seeks and often enough overtakes the seeker. Let us rather hope that we shall find Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadian, both of Cornwall. For myself I would joust with Sir Tristram than whom braver and bolder knight does not live.\"  \"And as for me,\" spoke Gawaine, \"my anxiety is to see Mark, the king of Cornwall, and tell him to his face that I deem him a scurvy hound since he promised protection to Beatrice of Banisar as she passed through his lands and yet broke his promise and so holds her for ransom.\"  \"And there shall I help you, dear Gawaine. For bitterly shall Mark rue his unknightly act. Shall I even wait for my event with Sir Tristram until your business is done.\"  \"Aye, and gladly will Sir Tristram wait, I wot, if he deems it honor to meet with Sir Launcelot du Lake. For no knight there is who doth not know of your prowess and repute, Sir Tristram least of all.\"  \"Kind words, Gawaine, for which I thank you. Yet, if I mistake not, yonder, adventure seems to wait. And we but a little more than two score miles from our gates.\"  Ahead of them and barring their way were ten knights. Launcelot and Gawaine stopped not a moment their pace but rode boldly forward.  \"And wherefor do you, strange Knights, dispute our passage?\" asked Sir Gawaine.  \"Safely may you both pass unless you be gentlemen of King Arthur's court,\" quote the leader who stepped forward to answer.  \"And what if we be, Sir Knight?\" replied Sir Launcelot mildly.  \"And if you be then must you battle to the uttermost. For we owe loyalty to King Ryence who is enemy of King Arthur. Therefore, are we his enemies too, and enemies also of all of King Arthur's subjects. And thus, we flaunt our enmity. We here and now call King Arthur an upstart and if you be of his court you cannot do aught else but fight with us.\"  \"Keep you your words,\" said Sir Gawaine, \"until we have ceased our quarrel. Then if you will you may call Arthur any names. Prepare you.\"  Boldly Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine charged upon the foe. Nor did the knights who met them know who these two were, else milder were their tone. Such was the valor of the two and such their strength that four men were thrown from their horses in that first attack and of these two were grievously wounded.  Together and well they fought. Easily did they withstand the men of King Ryence. Four men were slain by their might, through wondrous and fearful strokes, and four were sorely wounded. There lay the four against an oaken tree where they had been placed in a moment's lull. But two knights were left to oppose Launcelot and Gawaine but these two were gallant men and worthy, the very best of all the ten.  So they fought again each with a single foe. Hard pressed were the two men of King Ryence, yet stubbornly they would not give way. And as each side gave blow for blow, so each called \"for Arthur\" or \"for Ryence,\" whichever the case might be. Many hours they fought until at last Sir Launcelot by a powerful blow crashed both foe and foe's horse to the ground.  And as the other would further combat, though exceedingly weak, Sir Launcelot, upraised lance in hand by a swift stroke smote sword from out of his weakened grasp.  \"Thou art a brave knight, friend. And having fought so well, I ask no further penance but this, that you do now declare King Arthur no upstart. I care not for your enmity but I will abide no slander.\"  \"So must I then declare, since you have proven better man than I,\" declared the conquered knight. \"And for your leniency I owe you thanks. Wherefore then to whom am I grateful? I pray your name?\"  \"That I shall not tell until I hear your own,\" replied Launcelot.  \"I am known as Ronald de Lile,\" the other replied in subdued tone.  \"Truly and well have I heard of you as a brave knight,\" was the reply, \"and now I know it to be so. I am Sir Launcelot du Lake.\"  \"Then indeed is honor mine and glory, too. For honor it is to succumb to Sir Launcelot.\"  But now both heard the voice of Gawaine. Weak had he grown, but weaker still his foe. Gawaine had brought the other to earth at last with swift and mighty blow and such was the force of his stroke the fallen man could not rise although he made great ado so to do.  \"So must I yield,\" this knight declared. \"Now will I admit Arthur no upstart, but though I die for it I do declare no greater king than Ryence ever lived.\"  \"By my faith, your words are but such as any knight must hold of his own sovereign prince. I cannot take offense at brave words, Sir Knight. Now, give me your name, for you are strong and worthy.\"  \"I am Marvin, brother of him who fought with your comrade. And never have we met bolder and greater knights.\"  \"I am Gawaine and he who fought your brother is none other than Launcelot.\"  \"Then truly have we met no mean foes,\" replied the other.  Conquered and conquerers now turned to make the wounded as comfortable as they well could be. After which, our two knights debated going on their journey or tarrying where they were until the morn.  \"Let us wend our way until we find fit place for food and rest. There can we tarry.\" So spoke Launcelot and the other agreed.  Then they took leave of Sir Marvin and Sir Ronald and so on their way. Not many miles did they go however before they found suitable place. Late was the hour and weary and much in need of rest were the two knights. So they slept while, half his journey covered, Allan sped onward, making fast time because he was but light of weight and his horse exceeding swift.     CHAPTER FOUR  Allan Meets the Knights   From the first day when Allan began to understand the tales of chivalry and knightly deeds, he fancied and longed for the day when he would grow into manhood and by the same token into knighthood. Then would he go unto King Arthur on some Pentecost and crave the boon of serving him. Mayhap, too, he would through brave and worthy deeds gain seat among those of the Round Table. So he would dream, this youth with eager eyes, and his father, Sir Gaunt, soon came to know of his son's fancies and was overly proud and pleased with them. For he himself had, in his days, been a great and worthy knight, of many adventures and victor of many an onslaught. It pleased him that son of his would follow in his footsteps."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6582"],["title","In the Court of King Arthur (#2)"],["body","Allan was fourteen, Sir Gaunt proceeded to Sir Percival who was great friend of his and bespoke for his son the place of page. And so to please Sir Gaunt and for friendship's sake, Sir Percival gave ready consent. Therewith, he found the youth pleasing to the eye and of a great willingness to serve.  So must we return to Allan who is now on his way for many an hour. As he made his way, he marveled that he should have had notice brought upon himself, for he was young and diffident and should by every token have escaped attention in these his first days at court. How would his heart have grown tumultuous had he known that none other than Arthur himself had made him choice. But that he was not to know for many a year.  Night came on and the boy traveled far. Yet gave he no thought to rest for he knew that he could ill afford to tarry and that only with the best of fortune could he overtake the two knights in time to make early return. About him the woods were dark and mysterious. Owls hooted now and then and other sounds of the night there were, yet was the boy so filled with urge of his mission that he found not time to think of ghosts nor black magic.  Then, as he turned the road he saw the dim shadow of a horse. Ghostly it seemed, until through closer view it proved flesh and blood. Lying close by was a knight who seemed exceeding weak and sorely wounded.  Quick from his horse came Allan and so made the strange knight be of greater comfort.  Now the knight spoke weakly.  \"Grievously have I been dealt with by an outlaw band. This day was I to meet my two brothers Sir Ronald and Sir Marvin yet cannot proceed for very weakness. Which way do you go, lad?\"  \"I keep on my way to Cornwall,\" replied Allan.  \"From yonder do my brothers journey and should you meet with them bid them hasten here so that together we can go forth to find this outlaw band and it chastise.\"  \"That shall I do. Sir Knight. It grieves me that I may not stay and give you such aid as I may but so must I hasten that I cannot. Yet shall I stop at first abode and commission them to hurry here to you.\"  \"For that I thank you, lad. And should time ever come when you my aid require, know then to call on Philip of Gile.\"  So Allan pressed forward. At early dawn he came upon Sir Ronald and Sir Marvin who had found rest along the wayside. And when he found that these were the two knights he gave them their brother's message.  \"Then must we hasten thence, Ronald. And thank you, lad, for bringing us this message. Choose you and you can rest awhile and partake of such food that we have.\"  \"Of food I will have, Sir Knights, for hunger calls most urgently. But tarry I cannot for I must find Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine. Mayhap you have met with them?\"  \"Of a truth can we say that we have met with them and suffered thereby. Yet do we hold proof as to their knightly valor and skill. They have gone but a little way, for it was their purpose to find rest nearby. We doubt not you will find them at the first fair abode. In the meantime must we hasten to our brother's aid and leave our wounded comrades to such care as they may get.\"  The knights spoke truly, for Allan found upon inquiry that the two he sought were lodged close by. Boldly the boy called, now for Sir Launcelot, now for Sir Gawaine, but both were overtired and of a great weariness and it took many minutes before at last Sir Launcelot opened wide his eyes.  \"And who are you, boy?\" for he knew him not.  \"My name is Allan and I am page to Sir Percival.\"  \"Come you with a message from Sir Percival? Does he need our help?\"  \"Nay, sir. Rather do I come with a message from the court--the herald of which sent me urging you and Sir Gawaine to return before sundown for a great conclave is to gather which the King himself has called.\"  \"Awaken then, thou sleepy knight,\" Sir Launcelot called to his comrade who had not stirred. \"It were pity that all this must be told to you again.\"  Sir Gawaine now arose rubbing eyes still filled with sleep. To him Allan repeated his message.  \"What say you, Gawaine? Shall we return?\"  \"As for me,\" replied Sir Gawaine, \"I would say no. What matter if we are or are not present. Already we are late for our present journey's purpose. So say I, let us not return but rather ask this youth to bespeak for us the king's clemency.\"  \"And I, too, am of the same mind, Gawaine. So lad,\" Sir Launcelot turned to the boy and spoke kindly, \"return you to court and give them our message. This errand on which we are at present bound holds urgent need, else would we return at our King's behest.\"  Rueful and with a great gloom Allan saw his errand fail.  \"Kind sirs, Sir Percival bid me bespeak for him as well, and ask you, as true comrades, to make certain to return. Furthermore, my knights, this, my first mission would be unfortunate if it did not terminate successfully. So I pray you that you return.\"  Loud and long Sir Launcelot laughed and yet not unkindly while Sir Gawaine placed hand upon the boy's shoulder approvingly.  \"By my faith, Launcelot, we can do no more than return. That Percival speaks counts for much, but this youth's honor is also at stake.\" The light of laughter played in the speaker's eyes.  \"Yes,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"let us return. It would be pity to send this lad back after his long journey, without success. So then to our horses and let us make haste. The hours are few and the miles many.\"     CHAPTER FIVE  Merlin's Message   Now as the sun, a flaming golden ball about which played the wondrous softer colors of filmy clouds, began sinking in the western horizon, the heralds announced everywhere that the time for assemblage had come. Of those few who were not present, chiefest were Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine. And for these two the herald of King Arthur was searching the road in vain.  \"Think you, Sir Percival, these two will come?\" the herald, anxious of tone, inquired. \"Our King would have them present and I fancy not the making of excuse for their not appearing.\"  \"It is hard telling, Sir Herald. Far had the page to go and he is young. Then too, it is a question whether should he meet with them, these two have a mind to appear. For I know that their journey to Cornwall is urgent.\"  Now the knights entered and found place. Then followed the pages, squires and after them such yeoman and varlets as could find room. After each had found his place, came King Arthur leading his queen. And as they entered, up rose the knights, their vassals, all that were within the hall and raised a mighty shout.  \"St. George and Merrie England. Long live King Arthur. Long live Queen Guenever.\"  Then turned the King toward his loyal subjects and though his lips were seen to move, none heard him for the clamor. So King Arthur turned to seat his queen and then he himself sat down upon his throne, high on the dais.  Then soon after even as bell tolled the hour, Arthur arose. No sign had yet come of Launcelot and Gawaine. So now the herald slipped to the door to cast again a hurried glance for perchance that they might be within vision. And as he went noiselessly, so, too, a quiet fell that the King's words might be heard. But now disturbing this quiet came a great clattering. Arthur turned his eyes, frowning, at the sudden noise. Yet came a greater turmoil, approaching horse's hoofs were heard and then into the great hall thundered the steeds carrying the noble figures of Launcelot and Gawaine, followed but a pace behind by Allan the page.  Straight to the dais they came, the two knights. Allan, however, turned, made hasty exit because he felt himself abashed to be observed by so many eyes. On foot he entered once again and found place far in the rear where few could observe him.  The two knights now dismounted and knelt before their King.  \"We pray your pardon for the lateness of our coming. Yet did we hasten and could not have come the sooner.\"  \"That we feel is so, Sir Knights, for we know you well enough. Nor are we wroth, since come you did. But where, pray, is the message bearer? Truly his speed was great to have reached you in time for your return. And if I mistake not,\" added the King with great shrewdness, \"neither you, Gawaine, nor you Launcelot, were any too ready to return. How then, did the lad urge you?\"  \"You speak truly, sire,\" replied Gawaine. \"For our errand had need of urgent haste and we were both to give it up. Yet did the boy urge us and chiefest urge of all to us was where he claimed his own honor demanded the success of his mission. Those were fine words, so did we therefore return.\"  \"Fine words, indeed. Where then is this page? Will you, Sir Herald, bring him forth?\"  So Allan came forward, red of face and hating such womanness that would let him blush before all these great men. Knelt he before his King.  \"Thou art a good lad and will bear watching. Go thy way and remember that the road ahead for those who wish to be knights of high nobility is steep and arduous but well worth the trials. Remember too, that this day, Britain's King, said that some day thou wilt prove a worthy and brave knight.\"  And as Allan with flaming cheeks and glorious pride went to his place far in the rear of the hall the King turned to the assemblage.  \"Merlin is here but departs from us tomorrow for many a day. He has had a great dream which affects this court and us and which must be told to all of you. So he has asked us to call you and this we have done. Stand up now Merlin, wisest of men and truest of counselors. Speak.\"  Up rose Merlin and for wonder as to what his dream might be all held their breath.  \"But the other night came Joseph of Armathea to me while I slept. And he chided me that in all Britain so few of all the true and brave knights had thought to seek the wondrous Holy Grail which once was pride of all England.  \"And me thought I heard him say, 'Truly do I misdoubt the valor of these knights who seek adventure and glory.'  \"'Yet.' said I, 'doubt not their valor for can I"]]]
