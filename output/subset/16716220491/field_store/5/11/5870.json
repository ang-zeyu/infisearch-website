Of course,\" he continued, \"I can't very well tell you everything that is going to take place the following week. But I'll do my best.\"  Brownie Beaver was delighted. And when Mr. Crow asked him what day he wanted his newspaper Brownie said that Saturday afternoon would be a good time.  \"That's the last day of the week,\" Brownie Beaver remarked, \"so you ought to have plenty of news for me. You know, if you came the first day of the week there would be very little to tell.\"  \"That's so!\" said Mr. Crow. \"Well say 'Saturday,' then. And you shall have your newspaper without fail--unless,\" he explained--\"unless there should be a bad storm, or unless I should be ill. And, of course, if Farmer Green should want me to help him in his cornfield, I wouldn't be able to come. There might be other things, too, to keep me at home, which I can't think of just now,\" said Mr. Crow.  Again Brownie Beaver looked a bit doubtful.  \"I hope you'll try to be regular,\" he told Mr. Crow. \"When a person takes a newspaper he doesn't like to be disappointed, you know.\"  Old Mr. Crow said that he hoped nothing would prevent his coming to Brownie's house every Saturday afternoon.  \"There's only one more thing I can think of,\" he croaked, \"that would make it impossible for me to be here. And that is if I should lose count of the days of the week or have to see a baseball game or fly south for the winter.\"  \"But that's _three_ things, instead of only _one_,\" Brownie Beaver objected.  \"Well--maybe it is,\" Mr. Crow replied--\"the way you count. But I call it only one because I said it all in one breath, without a single pause.\"  \"I hope you won't tell me the news as fast as that,\" said Brownie Beaver, \"for if you did I should never be able to remember one-half of it.\"  But Mr. Crow promised that he would talk very slowly.  \"You'll be perfectly satisfied,\" he told Brownie. \"And now I must go home at once, to begin gathering news.\"     VII  A NEWFANGLED NEWSPAPER   After Mr. Crow flew back to Pleasant Valley to gather news for him, Brownie Beaver carefully counted each day that passed. Since Mr. Crow had agreed to be his newspaper, and come each Saturday afternoon to tell him everything that had happened during the week, Brownie was in a great hurry for Saturday to arrive.  In order to make no mistake, he put aside a stick in which he gnawed a notch each day. And in that way he knew exactly when Saturday came.  That was probably the longest day in Brownie Beaver's life. At least, it seemed so to him. Whenever he saw a bird soaring above the tree-tops he couldn't help hoping it was Mr. Crow. And whenever he heard a _caw_--_caw_ far off in the distance Brownie Beaver dropped whatever he happened to be doing, expecting that Mr. Crow would flap into sight at any moment.  Brownie had many disappointments. But Mr. Crow really came at last. He lighted right on top of Brownie Beaver's house and called \"Paper!\" down the chimney--just like that!  Brownie happened to be inside his house. And in a wonderfully short time his head appeared above the water and he soon crawled up beside Mr. Crow.  \"Well, I _am_ glad to see you!\" he told Mr. Crow.  \"Peter Mink caught a monstrous eel in the duck pond on Monday,\" Mr. Crow said. Being a newspaper, he thought he ought to say nothing except what was news--not even \"Good afternoon!\"  \"Mr. Rabbit, of Pine Ridge, with his wife and fourteen children, is visiting his brother, Mr. Jeremiah Rabbit. Mrs. Jeremiah Rabbit says she does not know when her husband's relations are going home,\" Mr. Crow continued to relate in a singsong voice.  \"Goodness gracious!\" Brownie Beaver exclaimed.  \"Fatty Coon--\" Mr. Crow said--\"Fatty Coon was confined to his house by illness Tuesday night. He ate too many dried apples.\"  \"Well, well!\" Brownie Beaver murmured. And he started to ask Mr. Crow a question. But Mr. Crow interrupted him with more news.  \"Mrs. Bear had a birthday on Wednesday. An enjoyable time was had by all--except the pig.\"  \"Pig?\" Brownie Beaver asked. \"What pig?\"  \"The pig they ate,\" said Mr. Crow. And he went right on talking. \"On Thursday Mr. Woodchuck went to visit his cousins in the West. Mrs. Woodchuck is worried.\"  \"What's she worried about?\" Brownie inquired.  \"She's afraid he's coming back again,\" Mr. Crow explained.  \"I _have_ heard he was lazy,\" Brownie said. \"What happened on Friday?\"  \"Tommy Fox made a visit. But he didn't have a good time at all,\" Mr. Crow reported, \"and he left faster than he came.\"  Brownie Beaver wanted to know where Tommy Fox made his visit.  \"At Farmer Green's hen-house,\" Mr. Crow explained.  \"Why did he hurry away?\" Brownie asked.  \"Old dog Spot chased him,\" Mr. Crow replied. \"But you mustn't ask questions,\" he complained. \"You can't ask questions of a newspaper, you know.\"  \"Well--what happened on Saturday?\"  \"There you go again!\" cried Mr. Crow. \"Another question! I declare, I don't believe you ever took a newspaper before--did you?\"  Brownie Beaver admitted that he never had.  \"Then--\" said Mr. Crow--\"then don't interrupt me again, please! I'll tell you all the news I've brought. And when I've finished I'll stop being a newspaper and be myself for a while. And then we can talk. But not before!\" he insisted.  Brownie Beaver nodded his head. He was afraid that if he said another word Mr. Crow would grow angry and fly away without telling him any more news.  \"On Saturday--this morning, to be exact\"--said Mr. Crow, \"there came near being a bad accident. Jimmy Rabbit almost cut off Frisky Squirrel's tail.\"  Mr. Crow paused and looked at Brownie Beaver out of the corner of his eye. He knew that Brownie would want to know what prevented the accident. But he was in no hurry to tell him.  For a few moments Brownie waited to hear the rest. But a few moments was more than he could endure.  \"Why didn't Jimmy cut off his tail?\" Brownie asked eagerly.  \"There!\" said Mr. Crow. \"You've done just as I told you not to. So I shall not tell you the rest until next Saturday.... You see, you have a few things to learn about taking a newspaper.\" And 'he would give Brownie no more news that day. To be sure, he was willing to talk--but only about things that had happened where Brownie Beaver lived.     VIII  MR. CROW IS UPSET   Brownie Beaver couldn't help feeling that Mr. Crow had not treated him very well, because Mr. Crow hadn't told him all the news about Frisky Squirrel's tail. He thought that maybe there were things about a newspaper that even Mr. Crow didn't know.  Another week had passed. Brownie knew that it had, because since Mr. Crow's last call he had cut a notch in a stick each day. And there were now seven of them.  Late Saturday afternoon Mr. Crow came back again. He lighted on top of Brownie's house and called \"Paper!\" down the chimney, just as he had a week before.  Brownie Beaver came swimming up once more.  \"Look here!\" he said to Mr. Crow. \"I don't believe yon know much about being a newspaper, do you?\"  That surprised Mr. Crow.  \"What do you mean?\" he asked.  \"A newspaper--\" said Brownie Beaver--\"a newspaper is always left on, a person's doorstep. I've talked with a good many people and not one of them ever heard of a paper being left on the roof.\"  Mr. Crow's face seemed to grow blacker than ever, he was so angry.  \"How can anybody leave a newspaper on your doorstep, when the step's under water?\" he growled.  Brownie Beaver did not answer that question, for he had something else to say to Mr. Crow.  \"I've talked with a good many people,\" he said once more, \"and not one of them ever heard of such rudeness as _shouting down a person's chimney_. If there was anybody asleep in the house, it would certainly wake him; and if a person had a fire in his house, shouting down the chimney might put it out.\"  Mr. Crow looked rather foolish.  \"I'll try to think of some way of leaving your newspaper that will suit us both,\" he said. Then he _hemmed_ and began to tell Brownie the week's news.  \"On Sunday,\" said Mr. Crow, \"there was a freshet.\"  \"I knew that before you did,\" said Brownie Beaver.  Mr. Crow looked disappointed.  \"How?\" he asked.  \"Why, I live further up the river than you,\" said Brownie Beaver. \"And since freshets always come _down_ a river, this one didn't reach you till after it had passed me.\"  Something made Mr. Crow peevish.  \"I don't believe you'd care to hear any more of my news,\" he said. \"You appear to know it already. Perhaps you'll be kind enough to tell me the sort of news you prefer to hear.\"  \"Certainly!\" Brownie Beaver replied. \"Now, there's the weather! I've talked with a good many people and they all say that a good newspaper ought to tell the weather for the next day.\"  Mr. Crow cocked an eye up at the sky.  \"To-morrow will be fair,\" he said.  \"I'm told that a good newspaper ought to tell a few jokes,\" Brownie Beaver continued.  But Mr. Crow sneered openly at that. \"I'm a _newspaper_--not a _jest-book_,\" he announced.  \"Then you refuse to tell any jokes, do you?\" Brownie Beaver asked him.  \"I certainly do!\" Mr. Crow cried indignantly.  \"Very well!\" Brownie said. \"I see I'll have to take some other newspaper, though I must say I hate to change--after taking this one so long.\"  \"I hope you'll find one to suit you,\" Mr. Crow said in a cross voice. And he flew away without another word. He was terribly upset. You see, he had enjoyed being a newspaper, because it gave him an excuse for asking people the most inquisitive questions. He had intended all that week to ask Aunt Polly Woodchuck whether she wore a wig. But he hadn't been able to find her at home. And now it was too late--for Mr. Crow was a newspaper no longer.  As for Brownie Beaver, he succeeded in getting Jasper Jay to be his newspaper. Though Jasper told him many jokes, Brownie found that he could not depend upon Jasper's news. And as a matter of fact, Jasper made up most of it himself. He claimed that the _newest news_ was the best.  \"That's why I invent it myself, right on the spot,\" he explained.

So she went over silently to him, and put the little baby into his arms, and then said, \"May the Lord look down with pity on you both.\"  As soon as the unhappy young man heard these compassionate words, and saw the face of his pretty, peaceful babe, he burst into tears; they rolled in large drops down on the infant's head.  Then in a short time he was able to speak, and he told Mrs. Newton his sad little history; how he had no one in the whole world to look with pity on him, or his motherless child; and how God alone was his hope in this day of calamity. His father had been displeased with him because he had married that young woman, whom he dearly loved; and he had given him some money that was his portion, and would do nothing else for him. The young man had taken some land and a house, but as the rent was too high, he could not make enough of the land to pay it; so he had been obliged to sell all his goods, and he had only as much money left as would, with great saving, carry him to America, where he had a brother who advised him to go out there.  \"And now,\" said he, looking over at the pale face of his dear wife, \"What shall I do with the little creature she has left me? how shall I carry it over the wide ocean without a mother to care for it, and nurse it?\"  \"You cannot do so,\" said Mrs. Newton, wiping her eyes; \"leave it with me; I have no children of my own, my husband would like to have one; this babe shall lie in my bosom, and be unto me as a daughter. I will nurse it for you until you are settled in America, and send or come for it.\"  The young man wept with gratitude; he wanted to know how he was to repay Mrs. Newton, but she said for the present she did not want payment, that it would be a pleasure to her to have the baby; and it would be time enough to talk about payment when the father was able to claim it, and take it to a home.  So the next day they buried the poor young woman, and soon after the young man went away and sailed off to America, and from that day to this Mrs. Newton had never heard anything of him.  As she had said, that poor little motherless babe lay in her bosom, and was unto her as a daughter; she loved it; she loved it when it was a helpless little thing, weak and sickly; she loved it when it grew a pretty lively baby, and would set its little feet on her knees, and crow and caper before her face; she loved it when it began to play around her as she sat at work, to lisp out the word \"Ganny,\" for she taught it to call her grandmother; she loved it when it would follow her into her nice garden, and pick a flower and carry it to her, as she sat in the little arbor; and she, holding the flower, would talk to it of God who made the flower, and made the bee that drew honey from the flower, and made the sun that caused the flower to grow, and the light that gave the flower its colors, and the rain that watered it, and the earth that nourished it. And she loved that child when it came back from the infant school, and climbed up on her lap, or stood with its hands behind its back, to repeat some pretty verses about flowers, or about the God who made them. That child was Fanny, the flower-girl; and ah! how little did good Mrs. Newton think she would be selling flowers in the streets to help to support her.  But it came to pass, that when Fanny was nearly six years old, Mrs. Newton's husband fell very ill; it was a very bad, and very expensive illness, for poor Mrs. Newton was so uneasy, she would sometimes have two doctors to see him; but all would not do; he died: and Mrs. Newton was left very poorly off.  In a short time she found she could not keep on her pretty cottage; she was obliged to leave it; and the church where she had gone every Sunday for so many years; and the church-yard where her husband was buried, and little Fanny's mother; and the infant school where Fanny learned so much; and the dear little garden, and the flowers that were Fanny's teachers and favorites. Oh! how sorry was poor Mrs. Newton. But even a little child can give comfort; and so little Fanny, perhaps without thinking to do so, did; for when Mrs. Newton for the last time sat out in her garden, and saw the setting sun go down, and told Fanny she was going to leave that pretty garden, where she had from infancy been taught to know God's works, the child looked very sad and thoughtful indeed, for some time; but afterwards coming up to her, said,  \"But, grandmother, we shall not leave God, shall we? for you say God is everywhere, and He will be in London too.\"  And oh! how that thought consoled poor Mrs. Newton; she did not leave God,--God did not leave her.  So she left the abode of her younger years--the scene of her widowhood; and she went away to hire a poor lodging in the outlets of London; but her God was with her, and the child she had nursed in her prosperity was her comfort in adversity.  Matters, however, went no better when she lived with little Fanny in a poor lodging. She had only one friend in London, and she lived at a distance from her. Mrs. Newton fell ill; there was no one to nurse her but Fanny; she could no longer pay for her schooling, and sometimes she was not able to teach her herself.  All this seemed very hard, and very trying; and one would have been tempted to think that God was no longer with poor Mrs. Newton; that when she had left her cottage she had left the God who had been so good to her.  But this would have been a great mistake. God was with Mrs. Newton; He saw fit to try and afflict her; but He gave her strength and patience to bear her trials and afflictions.  One afternoon her friend came to pay her a visit: she was going out a little way into the country to see a relation who had a very fine nursery-garden, and she begged Mrs. Newton to let little Fanny go with her own daughter. Mrs. Newton was very glad to do so for she thought it would be a nice amusement for Fanny.  The nurseryman was very kind to her; and when she was going away gave her a fine bunch of flowers. Fanny was in great delight, for she loved flowers and knew her dear grandmother loved them too. But as she was coming back, and just as she was entering the streets, she met a lady and a little boy of about three years old, who directly held out his hands and began to beg for the flowers. His mamma stopped, and as Fanny was very poorly dressed, she thought it probable that she would sell her nosegay, and so she said,  \"Will you give that bunch of flowers to my little boy, and I will pay you for it?\"  \"Please, ma'am, they are for grandmother,\" said Fanny blushing, and thinking she ought to give the flowers directly, and without money to any one who wished for them.  \"But perhaps your grand-mother would rather have this sixpence?\" said the lady. And Mrs. Newton's friend, who had just come up, said,  \"Well, my dear, take the lady's sixpence, and let her have the flowers if she wishes for them.\"  So Fanny held the flowers to the lady, who took them and put the sixpence in her hand. Fanny wished much to ask for one rose, but she thought it would not be right to do so, when the lady had bought them all: and she looked at them so very longingly that the lady asked if she were sorry to part with them.  \"Oh! no, ma'am,\" cried her friend, \"she is not at all sorry--come now, don't be a fool, child,\" she whispered, and led Fanny on.  \"That is a good bargain for you,\" she added as she went on; \"that spoiled little master has his own way, I think; it would be well for you, and your grandmother too, if you could sell sixpenny worth of flowers every day.\"  \"Do you think I could, ma'am?\" said Fanny, opening her hand and looking at her sixpence, \"this will buy something to do poor granny good; do you think Mr. Simpson would give me a nosegay every day?\"  \"If you were to pay him for it, he would,\" said her friend; \"suppose you were to go every morning about five o'clock, as many others do, and buy some flowers, and then sell them at the market; you might earn something, and that would be better than being idle, when poor Mrs. Newton is not able to do for herself and you.\"  So when Fanny got back, she gave her dear grandmother the sixpence.  \"The Lord be praised!\" said Mrs. Newton, \"for I scarcely knew how I was to get a loaf of bread for thee or myself to-morrow.\"  And then Fanny told her the plan she had formed about the flowers.  Mrs. Newton was very sorry to think her dear child should be obliged to stand in a market place, or in the public streets, to offer anything for sale; but she said, \"Surely it is Providence has opened this means of gaining a little bread, while I am laid here unable to do anything; and shall I not trust that Providence with the care of my darling child?\"  So from this time forth little Fanny set off every morning before five o'clock, to the nursery garden; and the nursery-man was very kind to her, and always gave her the nicest flowers; and instead of sitting down with the great girls, who went there also for flowers or vegetables, and tying them up in bunches, Fanny put them altogether in her little basket, and went away to her grandmother's room, and spread them out on the little table that poor Mrs. Newton might see them, while the sweet dew was yet sparkling on their bright leaves.  Then she would tell how beautiful the garden looked at that sweet early hour; and Mrs. Newton would listen with pleasure, for she loved a garden. She used to say, that God placed man in a garden when he was happy and holy; and when he was sinful and sorrowful, it was in a garden that the blessed Saviour wept and prayed for the sin of the world; and when his death had made atonement for that sin, it was in a garden his blessed body was laid.  Mrs. Newton taught Fanny many things from flowers; she was not a bad teacher, in her own simple way, but Jesus Christ, who was the best teacher the world ever had, instructed his disciples from vines and lilies, corn and fruit, and birds, and all natural things around them."]]]
