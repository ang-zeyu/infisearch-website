See this fiery genius, how in six short years it hath burnt out the oil of life, and reduced his body to a living skeleton; so that passing scoffers point at him with a sneer and exclaim--\"_C'est l'amour qui a fait cela_.\" Behold this bold, enterprising spirit--how it conceives and executes plans, compared to which the deeds of a Cartouche or a Howard sink into insignificance. And presently, when these precious germs of excellence shall ripen into full maturity, what may not be expected from the full development of such a boyhood? Perhaps, father, you may yet live to see him at the head of some gallant band, which assembles in the silent sanctuary of the forest, and kindly relieves the weary traveller of his superfluous burden. Perhaps you may yet have the opportunity, before you go to your own tomb, of making a pilgrimage to the monument which he may erect for himself, somewhere between earth and heaven! Perhaps,--oh, father--father, look out for some other name, or the very peddlers and street boys who have seen the effigy of your worthy son exhibited in the market-place at Leipsic will point at you with the finger of scorn!  OLD M. And thou, too, my Francis, thou too? Oh, my children, how unerringly your shafts are levelled at my heart.  FRANCIS. You see that I too have a spirit; but my spirit bears the sting of a scorpion. And then it was \"the dry commonplace, the cold, the wooden Francis,\" and all the pretty little epithets which the contrast between us suggested to your fatherly affection, when he was sitting on your knee, or playfully patting your cheeks? \"He would die, forsooth, within the boundaries of his own domain, moulder away, and soon be forgotten;\" while the fame of this universal genius would spread from pole to pole! Ah! the cold, dull, wooden Francis thanks thee, heaven, with uplifted hands, that he bears no resemblance to his brother.  OLD M. Forgive me, my child! Reproach not thy unhappy father, whose fondest hopes have proved visionary. The merciful God who, through Charles, has sent these tears, will, through thee, my Francis, wipe them from my eyes!  FRANCIS. Yes, father, we will wipe them from your eyes. Your Francis will devote--his life to prolong yours. (Taking his hand with affected tenderness.) Your life is the oracle which I will especially consult on every undertaking--the mirror in which I will contemplate everything. No duty so sacred but I am ready to violate it for the preservation of your precious days. You believe me?  OLD M. Great are the duties which devolve on thee, my son--Heaven bless thee for what thou has been, and wilt be to me.  FRANCIS. Now tell me frankly, father. Should you not be a happy man, were you not obliged to call this son your own?  OLD M. In mercy, spare me! When the nurse first placed him in my arms, I held him up to Heaven and exclaimed, \"Am I not truly blest?\"  FRANCIS. So you said then. Now, have you found it so? You may envy the meanest peasant on your estate in this, that he is not the father of such a son. So long as you call him yours you are wretched. Your misery will grow with his years--it will lay you in your grave.  OLD M. Oh! he has already reduced me to the decrepitude of fourscore.  FRANCIS. Well, then--suppose you were to disown this son.  OLD M. (startled). Francis! Francis! what hast thou said!  FRANCIS. Is not your love for him the source of all your grief? Root out this love, and he concerns you no longer. But for this weak and reprehensible affection he would be dead to you;--as though he had never been born. It is not flesh and blood, it is the heart that makes us sons and fathers! Love him no more, and this monster ceases to be your son, though he were cut out of your flesh. He has till now been the apple of your eye; but if thine eye offend you, says Scripture, pluck it out. It is better to enter heaven with one eye than hell with two! \"It is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\" These are the words of the Bible!  OLD M. Wouldst thou have me curse my son?  FRANCIS. By no means, father. God forbid! But whom do you call your son? Him to whom you have given life, and who in return does his utmost to shorten yours.  OLD M. Oh, it is all too true! it is a judgment upon me. The Lord has chosen him as his instrument.  FRANCIS. See how filially your bosom child behaves. He destroys you by your own excess of paternal sympathy; murders you by means of the very love you bear him--has coiled round a father's heart to crush it. When you are laid beneath the turf he becomes lord of your possessions, and master of his own will. That barrier removed, and the torrent of his profligacy will rush on without control. Imagine yourself in his place. How often he must wish his father under ground--and how often, too, his brother--who so unmercifully impede the free course of his excesses. But call you this a requital of love? Is this filial gratitude for a father's tenderness? to sacrifice ten years of your life to the lewd pleasures of an hour? in one voluptuous moment to stake the honor of an ancestry which has stood unspotted through seven centuries? Do you call this a son? Answer? Do you call this your son?  OLD M. An undutiful son! Alas! but still my child! my child!  FRANCIS. A most amiable and precious child--whose constant study is to get rid of his father. Oh, that you could learn to see clearly! that the film might be removed from your eyes! But your indulgence must confirm him in his vices! your assistance tend to justify them. Doubtless you will avert the curse of Heaven from his head, but on your own, father--on yours--will it fall with twofold vengeance.  OLD M. Just! most just! Mine, mine be all the guilt!  FRANCIS. How many thousands who have drained the voluptuous bowl of pleasure to the dregs have been reclaimed by suffering! And is not the bodily pain which follows every excess a manifest declaration of the divine will! And shall man dare to thwart this by an impious exercise of affection? Shall a father ruin forever the pledge committed to his charge? Consider, father, if you abandon him for a time to the pressure of want will not he be obliged to turn from his wickedness and repent? Otherwise, untaught even in the great school of adversity, he must remain a confirmed reprobate? And then--woe to the father who by a culpable tenderness bath frustrated the ordinances of a higher wisdom! Well, father?  OLD M. I will write to him that I withdraw my protection.  FRANCIS. That would be wise and prudent.  OLD M. That he must never come into my sight again  FRANCIS. 'Twill have a most salutary effect.  OLD M. (tenderly). Until he reforms.  FRANCIS. Right, quite right. But suppose that he comes disguised in the hypocrite's mask, implores your compassion with tears, and wheedles from you a pardon, then quits you again on the morrow, and jests at your weakness in the arms of his harlot. No, my father! He will return of his own accord, when his conscience awakens him to repentance.  OLD M. I will write to him, on the spot, to that effect.  FRANCIS. Stop, father, one word more. Your just indignation might prompt reproaches too severe, words which might break his heart--and then--do you not think that your deigning to write with your own hand might be construed into an act of forgiveness? It would be better, I think, that you should commit the task to me?  OLD M. Do it, my son. Ah! it would, indeed, have broken my heart! Write to him that--  FRANCIS (quickly). That's agreed, then?  OLD M. Say that he has caused me a thousand bitter tears--a thousand sleepless nights--but, oh! do not drive my son to despair!  FRANCIS. Had you not better retire to rest, father? This affects you too strongly.  OLD M. Write to him that a father's heart--But I charge you, drive him not to despair. [Exit in sadness.]  FRANCIS (looking after him with a chuckle). Make thyself easy, old dotard! thou wilt never more press thy darling to thy bosom--there is a gulf between thee and him impassable as heaven is from hell. He was torn from thy arms before even thou couldst have dreamed it possible to decree the separation. Why, what a sorry bungler should I be had I not skill enough to pluck a son from a father's heart; ay, though he were riveted there with hooks of steel! I have drawn around thee a magic circle of curses which he cannot overleap. Good speed to thee, Master Francis. Papa's darling is disposed of--the course is clear. I must carefully pick up all the scraps of paper, for how easily might my handwriting be recognized. (He gathers the fragments of the letter.) And grief will soon make an end of the old gentleman. And as for her-- I must tear this Charles from her heart, though half her life come with him.  No small cause have I for being dissatisfied with Dame Nature, and, by my honor, I will have amends! Why did I not crawl the first from my mother's womb? why not the only one? why has she heaped on me this burden of deformity? on me especially? Just as if she had spawned me from her refuse.* Why to me in particular this snub of the Laplander? these negro lips? these Hottentot eyes? On my word, the lady seems to have collected from all the race of mankind whatever was loathsome into a heap, and kneaded the mass into my particular person. Death and destruction! who empowered her to deny to me what she accorded to him? Could a man pay his court to her before he was born? or offend her before he existed? Why went she to work in such a partial spirit?  No! no! I do her injustice--she bestowed inventive faculty, and set us naked and helpless on the shore of this great ocean, the world--let those swim who can--the heavy** may sink. To me she gave naught else, and how to make the best use of my endowment is my present business.

A lime-tree in front of STAUFFACHER'S house at Steinen,    in Schwytz, upon the public road, near a bridge.     WERNER STAUFFACHER and PFEIFFER, of Lucerne, enter into    conversation.  PFEIFFER. Ay, ay, friend Stauffacher, as I have said, Swear not to Austria, if you can help it. Hold by the empire stoutly as of yore, And God preserve you in your ancient freedom!     [Presses his hand warmly and is going.  STAUFFACHER. Wait till my mistress comes. Now do! You are My guest in Schwytz--I in Lucerne am yours.  PFEIFFER. Thanks! thanks! But I must reach Gersau to-day. Whatever grievances your rulers' pride And grasping avarice may yet inflict, Bear them in patience--soon a change may come. Another emperor may mount the throne. But Austria's once, and you are hers forever.                    [Exit.     [STAUFEACHER sits down sorrowfully upon a bench    under the lime tree. Gertrude, his wife, enters,    and finds him in this posture. She places herself    near him, and looks at him for some time in silence.  GERTRUDE. So sad, my love! I scarcely know thee now. For many a day in silence I have marked A moody sorrow furrowing thy brow. Some silent grief is weighing on thy heart; Trust it to me. I am thy faithful wife, And I demand my half of all thy cares.     [STAUFFACHER gives her his hand and is silent.  Tell me what can oppress thy spirits thus? Thy toil is blest--the world goes well with thee-- Our barns are full--our cattle many a score; Our handsome team of sleek and well-fed steeds, Brought from the mountain pastures safely home, To winter in their comfortable stalls. There stands thy house--no nobleman's more fair! 'Tis newly built with timber of the best, All grooved and fitted with the nicest skill; Its many glistening windows tell of comfort! 'Tis quartered o'er with scutcheons of all hues, And proverbs sage, which passing travellers Linger to read, and ponder o'er their meaning.  STAUFFACHER. The house is strongly built, and handsomely, But, ah! the ground on which we built it totters.  GERTRUDE. Tell me, dear Werner, what you mean by that?  STAUFFACHER. No later since than yesterday, I sat Beneath this linden, thinking with delight, How fairly all was finished, when from Kuessnacht The viceroy and his men came riding by. Before this house he halted in surprise: At once I rose, and, as beseemed his rank, Advanced respectfully to greet the lord, To whom the emperor delegates his power, As judge supreme within our Canton here. \"Who is the owner of this house?\" he asked, With mischief in his thoughts, for well he knew. With prompt decision, thus I answered him: \"The emperor, your grace--my lord and yours, And held by one in fief.\" On this he answered, \"I am the emperor's viceregent here, And will not that each peasant churl should build At his own pleasure, bearing him as freely As though he were the master in the land. I shall make bold to put a stop to this!\" So saying he, with menaces, rode off, And left me musing, with a heavy heart, On the fell purpose that his words betrayed.  GERTRUDE. Mine own dear lord and husband! Wilt thou take A word of honest counsel from thy wife? I boast to be the noble Iberg's child, A man of wide experience. Many a time, As we sat spinning in the winter nights, My sisters and myself, the people's chiefs Were wont to gather round our father's hearth, To read the old imperial charters, and To hold sage converse on the country's weal. Then heedfully I listened, marking well What or the wise men thought, or good man wished, And garnered up their wisdom in my heart. Hear then, and mark me well; for thou wilt see, I long have known the grief that weighs thee down. The viceroy hates thee, fain would injure thee, For thou hast crossed his wish to bend the Swiss In homage to this upstart house of princes, And kept them stanch, like their good sires of old, In true allegiance to the empire. Say. Is't not so, Werner? Tell nee, am I wrong?  STAUFFACHER. 'Tis even so. For this doth Gessler hate me.  GERTRUDE. He burns with envy, too, to see thee living Happy and free on thy inheritance, For he has none. From the emperor himself Thou holdest in fief the lands thy fathers left thee. There's not a prince in the empire that can show A better title to his heritage; For thou hast over thee no lord but one, And he the mightiest of all Christian kings. Gessler, we know, is but a younger son, His only wealth the knightly cloak he wears; He therefore views an honest man's good fortune With a malignant and a jealous eye. Long has he sworn to compass thy destruction As yet thou art uninjured. Wilt thou wait Till he may safely give his malice scope? A wise man would anticipate the blow.  STAUFFACHER. What's to be done?  GERTRUDE.           Now hear what I advise. Thou knowest well, how here with us in Schwytz, All worthy men are groaning underneath This Gessler's grasping, grinding tyranny. Doubt not the men of Unterwald as well, And Uri, too, are chafing like ourselves, At this oppressive and heart-wearying yoke. For there, across the lake, the Landenberg Wields the same iron rule as Gessler here-- No fishing-boat comes over to our side But brings the tidings of some new encroachment, Some outrage fresh, more grievous than the last. Then it were well that some of you--true men-- Men sound at heart, should secretly devise How best to shake this hateful thraldom off. Well do I know that God would not desert you, But lend his favor to the righteous cause. Hast thou no friend in Uri, say, to whom Thou frankly may'st unbosom all thy thoughts?  STAUFFACHER. I know full many a gallant fellow there, And nobles, too,--great men, of high repute, In whom I can repose unbounded trust.                   [Rising.  Wife! What a storm of wild and perilous thoughts Hast thou stirred up within my tranquil breast? The darkest musings of my bosom thou Hast dragged to light, and placed them full before me, And what I scarce dared harbor e'en in thought, Thou speakest plainly out, with fearless tongue. But hast thou weighed well what thou urgest thus? Discord will come, and the fierce clang of arms, To scare this valley's long unbroken peace, If we, a feeble shepherd race, shall dare Him to the fight that lords it o'er the world. Even now they only wait some fair pretext For setting loose their savage warrior hordes, To scourge and ravage this devoted land, To lord it o'er us with the victor's rights, And 'neath the show of lawful chastisement, Despoil us of our chartered liberties.  GERTRUDE. You, too, are men; can wield a battle-axe As well as they. God ne'er deserts the brave.  STAUFFACHER. Oh wife! a horrid, ruthless fiend is war, That strikes at once the shepherd and his flock.  GERTRUDE. Whate'er great heaven inflicts we must endure; No heart of noble temper brooks injustice.  STAUFFACHER. This house--thy pride--war, unrelenting war, Will burn it down.  GERTRUDE.           And did I think this heart Enslaved and fettered to the things of earth, With my own hand I'd hurl the kindling torch.  STAUFFACHER. Thou hast faith in human kindness, wife; but war Spares not the tender infant in its cradle.  GERTRUDE. There is a friend to innocence in heaven Look forward, Werner--not behind you, now!  STAUFFACHER. We men may perish bravely, sword in hand; But oh, what fate, my Gertrude, may be thine?  GERTRUDE. None are so weak, but one last choice is left. A spring from yonder bridge, and I am free!  STAUFFACHER (embracing her). Well may he fight for hearth and home that clasps A heart so rare as thine against his own! What are the hosts of emperors to him! Gertrude, farewell! I will to Uri straight. There lives my worthy comrade, Walter Furst, His thoughts and mine upon these times are one."]]]
