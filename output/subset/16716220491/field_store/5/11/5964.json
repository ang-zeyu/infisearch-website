I don't believe you'd hurt a fly, although you do look so like a pirate. You've probably got a goody little conscience, so white and soft that you'd die of shame to have people see it.\"  \"Excuse me, Lady Macbeth,\" he said, laughing; \"I don't wish to underrate your powers of depravity, but which of your soul-destroying sins would you prefer to forget, if indeed any of them are shocking enough to trouble your excessively hardened conscience?  \"Well, I must admit,\" said Madeline, seriously, \"that I wouldn't care to forget anything I've done, not even my faults and follies. I should be afraid if they were taken away that I shouldn't have any character left.\"  \"Don't put it on that ground,\" said Henry, \"it's sheer vanity that makes you say so. You know your faults are just big enough to be beauty-spots, and that's why you'd rather keep 'em.\"  She reflected a moment, and then said, decisively--  \"That's a compliment. I don't believe I like 'em from you. Don't make me any more.\"  Perhaps she did not take the trouble to analyse the sentiment that prompted her words. Had she done so, she would doubtless have found it in a consciousness when in his presence of being surrounded with so fine and delicate an atmosphere of unspoken devotion that words of flattery sounded almost gross.  They paused before a gate. Pushing it open and passing within, she said, \"Good-night.\"  \"One word more. I have a favour to ask,\" he said. \"May I take you to the picnic?\"  \"Why, I think no escort will be necessary,\" she replied; \"we go in broad daylight; and there are no bears or Indians at Hemlock Hollow.\"  \"But your basket. You'll need somebody to carry your basket.\"  \"Oh yes, to be sure, my basket,\" she exclaimed, with an ironical accent. \"It will weigh at least two pounds, and I couldn't possibly carry it myself, of course. By all means come, and much obliged for your thoughtfulness.\"  But as she turned to go in she gave him a glance which had just enough sweetness in it to neutralize the irony of her words. In the treatment of her lovers, Madeline always punctured the skin before applying a drop of sweetness, and perhaps this accounted for the potent effect it had to inflame the blood, compared with more profuse but superficial applications of less sharp-tongued maidens.  Henry waited until the graceful figure had a moment revealed its charming outline against the lamp-lit interior, as she half turned to close the door. Love has occasional metaphysical turns, and it was an odd feeling that came over him as he walked away, being nothing less than a rush of thankfulness and self-congratulation that he was not Madeline. For, if he had been she, he would have lost the ecstasy of loving her, of worshipping her. Ah, how much she lost, how much all those lose, who, fated to be the incarnations of beauty, goodness, and grace, are precluded from being their own worshippers! Well, it was a consolation that she didn't know it, that she actually thought that, with her little coquetries and exactions, she was enjoying the chief usufruct of her beauty. God make up to the haughty, wilful darling in some other way for missing the passing sweetness of the thrall she held her lovers in!  When Burr reached home, he found his sister Laura standing at the gate in a patch of moonlight.  \"How pretty you look to-night!\" he said, pinching her round cheek.  The young lady merely shrugged her shoulders, and replied dryly--  \"So she let you go home with her.\"  \"How do you know that?\" he asked, laughing at her shrewd guess.  \"Because you're so sweet, you goosey, of course.\"  But, in truth, any such mode of accounting for Henry's favourable comment on her appearance was quite unnecessary. Laura, with her petite, plump figure, sloe-black eyes, quick in moving, curly head, and dark, clear cheeks, carnation-tinted, would have been thought by many quite as charming a specimen of American girlhood as the stately pale brunette who swayed her brother's affections.  \"Come for a walk, chicken! It is much too pretty a night to go indoors,\" he said.  \"Yes, and furnish ears for Madeline's praises, with a few more reflected compliments for pay, perhaps,\" she replied, contemptuously. \"Besides,\" she added, \"I must go into the house and keep father company. I only came out to cool off after baking the cake. You'd better come in too. These moonlight nights always make him specially sad, you know.\"  The brother and sister had been left motherless not long before, and Laura, in trying to fill her mother's place in the household, so far as she might, was always looking out that her father should have as little opportunity as possible to brood alone over his companionless condition.     CHAPTER II.   That same night toward morning Henry suddenly awoke from a sound sleep. Drowsiness, by some strange influence, had been completely banished from his eyes, and in its stead he became sensible of a profound depression of spirits. Physically, he was entirely comfortable, nor could he trace to any sensation from without either this sudden awakening or the mental condition in which he found himself. It was not that he thought of anything in particular that was gloomy or discouraging, but that all the ends and aims, not only of his own individual life, but of life in general, had assumed an aspect so empty, vain, and colourless, that he felt he would not rise from his bed for anything existence had to offer. He recalled his usual frame of mind, in which these things seemed attractive, with a dull wonderment that so baseless a delusion should be so strong and so general. He wondered if it were possible that it should ever again come over him.  The cold, grey light of earliest morning, that light which is rather the fading of night than the coming of day, filled the room with a faint hue, more cheerless than pitchiest darkness. A distant bell, with slow and heavy strokes, struck three. It was the dead point in the daily revolution of the earth's life, that point just before dawn, when men oftenest die; when surely, but for the force of momentum, the course of nature would stop, and at which doubtless it will one day pause eternally, when the clock is run down. The long-drawn reverberations of the bell, turning remoteness into music, full of the pathos of a sad and infinite patience, died away with an effect unspeakably dreary. His spirit, drawn forth after the vanishing vibrations, seemed to traverse waste spaces without beginning or ending, and aeons of monotonous duration. A sense of utter loneliness--loneliness inevitable, crushing, eternal, the loneliness of existence, encompassed by the infinite void of unconsciousness--enfolded him as a pall. Life lay like an incubus on his bosom. He shuddered at the thought that death might overlook him, and deny him its refuge. Even Madeline's face, as he conjured it up, seemed wan and pale, moving to unutterable pity, powerless to cheer, and all the illusions and passions of love were dim as ball-room candles in the grey light of dawn.  Gradually the moon passed, and he slept again.  As early as half-past eight the following forenoon, groups of men with very serious faces were to be seen standing at the corners of the streets, conversing in hushed tones, and women with awed voices were talking across the fences which divided adjoining yards. Even the children, as they went to school, forgot to play, and talked in whispers together, or lingered near the groups of men to catch a word or two of their conversation, or, maybe, walked silently along with a puzzled, solemn look upon their bright faces.  For a tragedy had occurred at dead of night which never had been paralleled in the history of the village. That morning the sun, as it peered through the closed shutters of an upper chamber, had relieved the darkness of a thing it had been afraid of. George Bayley sat there in a chair, his head sunk on his breast, a small, blue hole in his temple, whence a drop or two of blood had oozed, quite dead.  This, then, was what he meant when he said that he had made arrangements for leaving the village. The doctor thought that the fatal shot must have been fired about three o'clock that morning, and, when Henry heard this, he knew that it was the breath of the angel of death as he flew by that had chilled the genial current in his veins.  Bayley's family lived elsewhere, and his father, a stern, cold, haughty-looking man, was the only relative present at the funeral. When Mr. Lewis undertook to tell him, for his comfort, that there was reason to believe that George was out of his head when he took his life, Mr. Bayley interrupted him.  \"Don't say that,\" he said. \"He knew what he was doing. I should not wish any one to think otherwise. I am prouder of him than I had ever expected to be again.\"  A choir of girls with glistening eyes sang sweet, sad songs at the funeral, songs which, while they lasted, took away the ache of bereavement, like a cool sponge pressed upon a smarting spot. It seemed almost cruel that they must ever cease. And, after the funeral, the young men and girls who had known George, not feeling like returning that day to their ordinary thoughts and occupations, gathered at the house of one of them and passed the hours till dusk, talking tenderly of the departed, and recalling his generous traits and gracious ways.  The funeral had taken place on the day fixed for the picnic. The latter, in consideration of the saddened temper of the young people, was put off a fortnight.     CHAPTER III.   About half-past eight on the morning of the day set for the postponed picnic, Henry knocked at Widow Brand's door. He had by no means forgotten Madeline's consent to allow him to carry her basket, although two weeks had intervened.  She came to the door herself. He had never seen her in anything that set off her dark eyes and olive complexion more richly than the simple"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],["title","The Amateur Cracksman (#1)"],["body"," see him, leaning back in one of the luxurious chairs with which his room was furnished. I see his indolent, athletic figure; his pale, sharp, clean-shaven features; his curly black hair; his strong, unscrupulous mouth.  And again I feel the clear beam of his wonderful eye, cold and luminous as a star, shining into my brain--sifting the very secrets of my heart.  \"I wonder if you mean all that!\" he said at length.  \"You do in your present mood; but who can back his mood to last?  Still, there's hope when a chap takes that tone.  Now I think of it, too, you were a plucky little devil at school; you once did me rather a good turn, I recollect.  Remember it, Bunny?  Well, wait a bit, and perhaps I'll be able to do you a better one.  Give me time to think.\"  He got up, lit a fresh cigarette, and fell to pacing the room once more, but with a slower and more thoughtful step, and for a much longer period than before.  Twice he stopped at my chair as though on the point of speaking, but each time he checked himself and resumed his stride in silence.  Once he threw up the window, which he had shut some time since, and stood for some moments leaning out into the fog which filled the Albany courtyard.  Meanwhile a clock on the chimney-piece struck one, and one again for the half-hour, without a word between us.  Yet I not only kept my chair with patience, but I acquired an incongruous equanimity in that half-hour.  Insensibly I had shifted my burden to the broad shoulders of this splendid friend, and my thoughts wandered with my eyes as the minutes passed.  The room was the good-sized, square one, with the folding doors, the marble mantel-piece, and the gloomy, old-fashioned distinction peculiar to the Albany.  It was charmingly furnished and arranged, with the right amount of negligence and the right amount of taste.  What struck me most, however, was the absence of the usual insignia of a cricketer's den.  Instead of the conventional rack of war-worn bats, a carved oak bookcase, with every shelf in a litter, filled the better part of one wall; and where I looked for cricketing groups, I found reproductions of such works as \"Love and Death\" and \"The Blessed Damozel,\" in dusty frames and different parallels.  The man might have been a minor poet instead of an athlete of the first water.  But there had always been a fine streak of æstheticism in his complex composition; some of these very pictures I had myself dusted in his study at school; and they set me thinking of yet another of his many sides--and of the little incident to which he had just referred.  Everybody knows how largely the tone of a public school depends on that of the eleven, and on the character of the captain of cricket in particular; and I have never heard it denied that in A. J. Raffles's time our tone was good, or that such influence as he troubled to exert was on the side of the angels.  Yet it was whispered in the school that he was in the habit of parading the town at night in loud checks and a false beard.  It was whispered, and disbelieved.  I alone knew it for a fact; for night after night had I pulled the rope up after him when the rest of the dormitory were asleep, and kept awake by the hour to let it down again on a given signal.  Well, one night he was over-bold, and within an ace of ignominious expulsion in the hey-day of his fame. Consummate daring and extraordinary nerve on his part, aided, doubtless, by some little presence of mind on mine, averted the untoward result; and no more need be said of a discreditable incident. But I cannot pretend to have forgotten it in throwing myself on this man's mercy in my desperation.  And I was wondering how much of his leniency was owing to the fact that Raffles had not forgotten it either, when he stopped and stood over my chair once more.  \"I've been thinking of that night we had the narrow squeak,\" he began. \"Why do you start?\"  \"I was thinking of it too.\"  He smiled, as though he had read my thoughts.  \"Well, you were the right sort of little beggar then, Bunny; you didn't talk and you didn't flinch. You asked no questions and you told no tales.  I wonder if you're like that now?\"  \"I don't know,\" said I, slightly puzzled by his tone.  \"I've made such a mess of my own affairs that I trust myself about as little as I'm likely to be trusted by anybody else.  Yet I never in my life went back on a friend.  I will say that, otherwise perhaps I mightn't be in such a hole to-night.\"  \"Exactly,\" said Raffles, nodding to himself, as though in assent to some hidden train of thought; \"exactly what I remember of you, and I'll bet it's as true now as it was ten years ago.  We don't alter, Bunny. We only develop.  I suppose neither you nor I are really altered since you used to let down that rope and I used to come up it hand over hand. You would stick at nothing for a pal--what?\"  \"At nothing in this world,\" I was pleased to cry.  \"Not even at a crime?\" said Raffles, smiling.  I stopped to think, for his tone had changed, and I felt sure he was chaffing me.  Yet his eye seemed as much in earnest as ever, and for my part I was in no mood for reservations.  \"No, not even at that,\" I declared; \"name your crime, and I'm your man.\"  He looked at me one moment in wonder, and another moment in doubt; then turned the matter off with a shake of his head, and the little cynical laugh that was all his own.  \"You're a nice chap, Bunny!  A real desperate character--what?  Suicide one moment, and any crime I like the next!  What you want is a drag, my boy, and you did well to come to a decent law-abiding citizen with a reputation to lose.  None the less we must have that money to-night--by hook or crook.\"  \"To-night, Raffles?\"  \"The sooner the better.  Every hour after ten o'clock to-morrow morning is an hour of risk.  Let one of those checks get round to your own bank, and you and it are dishonored together.  No, we must raise the wind to-night and re-open your account first thing to-morrow.  And I rather think I know where the wind can be raised.\"  \"At two o'clock in the morning?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"But how--but where--at such an hour?\"  \"From a friend of mine here in Bond Street.\"  \"He must be a very intimate friend!\"  \"Intimate's not the word.  I have the run of his place and a latch-key all to myself.\"  \"You would knock him up at this hour of the night?\"  \"If he's in bed.\"  \"And it's essential that I should go in with you?\"  \"Absolutely.\"  \"Then I must; but I'm bound to say I don't like the idea, Raffles.\"  \"Do you prefer the alternative?\" asked my companion, with a sneer. \"No, hang it, that's unfair!\" he cried apologetically in the same breath.  \"I quite understand.  It's a beastly ordeal.  But it would never do for you to stay outside.  I tell you what, you shall have a peg before we start--just one.  There's the whiskey, here's a syphon, and I'll be putting on an overcoat while you help yourself.\"  Well, I daresay I did so with some freedom, for this plan of his was not the less distasteful to me from its apparent inevitability.  I must own, however, that it possessed fewer terrors before my glass was empty.  Meanwhile Raffles rejoined me, with a covert coat over his blazer, and a soft felt hat set carelessly on the curly head he shook with a smile as I passed him the decanter.  \"When we come back,\" said he.  \"Work first, play afterward.  Do you see what day it is?\" he added, tearing a leaflet from a Shakespearian calendar, as I drained my glass.  \"March 15th.  'The Ides of March, the Ides of March, remember.' Eh, Bunny, my boy?  You won't forget them, will you?\"  And, with a laugh, he threw some coals on the fire before turning down the gas like a careful householder.  So we went out together as the clock on the chimney-piece was striking two.   II  Piccadilly was a trench of raw white fog, rimmed with blurred street-lamps, and lined with a thin coating of adhesive mud.  We met no other wayfarers on the deserted flagstones, and were ourselves favored with a very hard stare from the constable of the beat, who, however, touched his helmet on recognizing my companion.  \"You see, I'm known to the police,\" laughed Raffles as we passed on. \"Poor devils, they've got to keep their weather eye open on a night like this!  A fog may be a bore to you and me, Bunny, but it's a perfect godsend to the criminal classes, especially so late in their season.  Here we are, though--and I'm hanged if the beggar isn't in bed and asleep after all!\"  We had turned into Bond Street, and had halted on the curb a few yards down on the right.  Raffles was gazing up at some windows across the road, windows barely discernible through the mist, and without the glimmer of a light to throw them out. They were over a jeweller's shop, as I could see by the peep-hole in the shop door, and the bright light burning within.  But the entire \"upper part,\" with the private street-door next the shop, was black and blank as the sky itself.  \"Better give it up for to-night,\" I urged. \"Surely the morning will be time enough!\"  \"Not a bit of it,\" said Raffles.  \"I have his key. We'll surprise him. Come along.\"  And seizing my right arm, he hurried me across the road, opened the door with his latch-key, and in another moment had shut it swiftly but softly behind us.  We stood together in the dark.  Outside, a measured step was approaching; we had heard it through the fog as we crossed the street; now, as it drew nearer, my companion's fingers tightened on my arm.  \"It may be the chap himself,\" he whispered. \"He's the devil of a night-bird.  Not a sound, Bunny!  We'll startle the life out of him. Ah!\"  The measured step had passed without a pause. Raffles drew a deep breath, and his singular grip of me slowly relaxed.  \"But still, not a sound,\" he continued in the same whisper; \"we'll take a rise out of him, wherever he is!  Slip off your shoes and follow me.\"  Well, you may wonder at my doing so; but you can never have met A. J. Raffles.  Half his power lay in a"]]]
