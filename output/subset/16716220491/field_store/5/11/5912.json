When it was explained to the doubters that the Nelson was capable of making a hundred miles an hour against a stiff breeze, the natives seemed to doubt the veracity of the boys.  The Peruvians knew little of airships, and when Jimmie exhibited to them daily newspapers showing how Germany was building a fleet of three hundred airships to use in case of war, they still looked incredulous.  \"Look here, fellers,\" Jimmie explained to them, later in the afternoon of the arrival, as a group of curious ones stood about the roped-in enclosure where the Nelson lay, \"I guess you don't know much about the navigation of the air.  It used to be risky; now it is no more so than riding on a railroad train.\"  \"You say it well!\"  The words were spoken in good English, seemingly in a boy's voice, and Jimmie peered through his audience in order to catch a glimpse of the speaker.  Presently, above the heads which surrounded him, the boy saw a hand and arm extended.  The palm was out, the thumb and little finger flat and crossed, the three remaining fingers held straight out.  The full salute of the Boy Scouts.  \"Say, you!\" the lad cried out, greatly pleased at finding a Boy Scout there.  \"Where did you get that?\"  \"Scouted for it!\" was the reply.  \"What does it read?\"  \"Be prepared!\"  \"Where from?\" was the next question.  \"Fox Patrol, Chicago.\"  \"You must be pretty foxy,\" Jimmie laughed, \"to get away off here.\"  The member of the Fox Patrol now made his way through the crowd and extended a hand to Jimmie.  \"You don't look as if it paid to be a Fox,\" laughed the latter.  The boy certainly did look like a tramp.  He was a lad of about sixteen, well formed as to figure and attractive as to feature, with bright blue eyes, long, fair hair, and a complexion which would have been perfect only for the grime upon it.  He blushed as Jimmie looked him over, and involuntarily turned his eyes down to his ragged clothing and broken shoes.  \"Forget that!\" Jimmie cried, in a moment.  \"I didn't mean anything by it.  Where you stopping?\"  The fact was that Jimmie suspected from the appearance of the lad that he was hungry as well as ragged and dirty.  He certainly looked hungry.  The boy hesitated before replying, his hands deep in his trousers pockets, his eyes on the ground.  Then a whimsical smile came to his face and he looked Jimmie squarely in the face.  \"No use of lyin' about it,\" he said.  \"I'm stoppin' down here at the Blue Sky Hotel.  It's a dandy place to stop at.  They never present a board bill.\"  Jimmie sat back on the rope which was drawn about the Nelson to keep meddlesome ones away from the machine and burst into a roar of laughter.  The crowd looked on stupidly, glancing from boy to boy, and then at one another, as if wondering if these Americans always went crazy when they met in a foreign land.  \"I know that Blue Sky Hotel,\" Jimmie said, presently, \"though I've never heard it called by that name before.  I had a room in one, in Central Park, New York, until a sparrow cop drove me out of it.  I liked it because I didn't have to dress for dinner there,\" he added, whimsically.  \"The feed is rather slim,\" observed the other.  \"It's run on the European plan,\" grinned Jimmie.  \"You get your sleepins, an' no one cares whether you get your eatin's or not. What's your name?\"  \"Dougherty--Mike Dougherty, Clark street, south of Van Buren!\"  \"I guess you must be French,\" Jimmie grinned.  \"You've guessed it.  Now, what's your name, and what are you boys doin' here with this old sky-ship?\"  \"I'll tell you all about it when we get back to the hotel,\" Jimmie replied.  \"Do you know any of the gazabos about here?  I want some one to watch the ginks who are watchin' the mutts who are watchin' the aeroplane.\"  Dougherty laughed at this suggestion of a treble surveillance and pointed out a lanky looking individual who was studying the machine closely from the outer side of the roped-circle.  \"That's Pedro,\" he said.  \"He's all right.  About all I've had to eat since I came here he's given me.  He's a Peruvian Indian, and in need of money.  Give him a dollar, and he'll guard your guards a month, and never leave the machine, night or day.\"  \"Does he talk United States?\"  \"Oh, just a little.\"  Pedro talked quite a little United States, as Jimmie called it, and a bargain was soon struck with him.  Then the two boys started away together.  First they visited a clothing store, where Jimmie looked at the best suits in stock, and measured Dougherty cautiously with his eyes.  A full outfit of under and outer clothing provided, they proceeded to the hotel, where Jimmie ushered his new-found friend into a commodious bathroom.  \"Remove some of your real estate,\" the boy said, \"an' hop into these new clothes.  They ain't very nobby, but the best I could get here.\"  Mike Dougherty stood looking at Jimmie for a moment as if he could not believe what he heard.  It had been a long time since he had been clean and properly clothed.  Then there came a suspicious moisture to his keen eyes and he turned away.  \"Oh, well,\" he said, with a tremble in his clear young voice, \"mebbe I'll be able to pay you back some day.  Just now I'm--\"  \"Cut it out!\" Jimmie replied.  \"You hain't got anythin' on me.  I've been there meself, an' the Boy Scout that helped me out told me to pass it along.  That's what I'm doin' now, and there's nothin' more to be said.  When you get washed and dressed, come on to No. 4, that's the second room from this tub, on the left of the corridor, an' I'll show you the rest of the bunch.\"  Jimmie went away to No. 4, where Ned and Sam Leroy were waiting for him.  Somehow, it seemed to Ned that Jimmie kept him waiting about half the time when they were in a strange city.  The little fellow had a way of wandering off alone and forgetting all about time in his delight at the strange things he saw.  When he entered No. 4 he found Ned standing near the door.  \"Were you out there before?\" Ned asked, pointing to the corridor, as Jimmie stepped inside.  \"Just got here,\" was the reply.  \"Found a Boy Scout from the Fox Patrol, Chicago, an' brought him along with me.  He's washin' some of the Peruvian scenery off his frame, now, an' will soon be along.\"  Then Jimmie told of his discovery of Mike Dougherty, of his leaving a treble guard around the Nelson, and of numerous other adventures in the city, which, not being in any way connected with this narrative, are not set down here.  \"I'm glad you brought this boy Mike here,\" Ned said, at the conclusion of the story.  \"We need some one who knows something about Lima to keep us posted.\"  \"About what?\" asked Jimmie.  \"We're spotted!\" Leroy cried out, before Ned could answer the question.  \"The wireless is swifter than the Nelson!\"  \"How do you know?\" demanded the little fellow.  \"How do you know we're spotted?\"  \"Oh, Ned's been doping it out,\" was the reply.  \"He'll tell you, I guess.\"  \"You thought you'd take the cream off the sensation!\" laughed Ned. \"Well, that is the boy of it!  All I know about it, Jimmie,\" he continued, \"is that I've been receiving telegrams which simply mean nothing.  They are from people I have never heard of, and are most mysteriously worded.\"  \"There's one that tells you to get out of the country,\" suggested Leroy.  \"Yes, but the others seem to infer that the man who sent them is out of his mind.  The three received are from Washington, San Francisco, and New Orleans.\"  \"What have the messages to do with our being spotted?\" asked Jimmie. \"I don't see any connection.\"  \"Stupid!\" cried Leroy.  \"Can't you see the wires were sent to locate Ned?  The person who delivered them to him sure wired back that they had been delivered to Ned in person--in other words, that he has reached Lima on his journey to Paraguay.\"  \"I see!\" Jimmie said, slowly.  \"It's clever, eh?\"  \"Too clever,\" Ned said.  \"I don't like the looks of it.  It means, of course, that the people who are trying to get the cattle concession away from Mr. Lyman have secret agents here.  And that means that everything we do at Lima will be watched and reported.\"  \"Reported to whom?\" asked Leroy.  \"Probably to this military person, Senor Lopez, who is on the job with both hands out,\" suggested Jimmie.  \"Well?  What about it?\"  \"I think,\" Leroy cut in, \"that we'd better be getting out of this. They can't follow us after we get up in the air.\"  Here a knock came on the door, and Jimmie admitted Mike and presented him to his chums.  The boy looked trim and handsome in his new suit, and all took a great liking to him.  While they discussed their plans another interruption took place, and then Jimmie saw Pedro at the door, beckoning excitedly to Mike Dougherty.  The boy talked with the Indian for a short time, and then turned to Ned, excitement showing in his face.  \"He says there's another airship here,\" Mike said.  \"Prowling over the mountains.\"  \"They can't follow us in the air, eh?\" cried Leroy.  \"I guess this is going some!\"     CHAPTER III  BLACK BEARS ON THE AMAZON   The handsome club room of the Black Bear Patrol, in the city of New York, was situated on the top floor of the magnificent residence of Attorney Bosworth, one of the leading corporation lawyers in the country.  Jack Bosworth, the lawyer's only son, was a member of the Black Bear Patrol, and the club room had been fitted up at his request.  It was in this room that Ned Nestor, Jimmie McGraw, Jack Bosworth, Harry Stevens, and Frank Shaw had planned their motor-boat trip down the Columbia river, as described in the first volume of this series. Jack, Harry and Frank had returned to New York from San Francisco when Ned had decided to accept the Secret Service mission to Paraguay, at the conclusion of the motor-boat vacation on the Columbia, leaving the two boats, the Black Bear and the Wolf, stored at Portland, Oregon.  One evening--the evening of the 1st of August, to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6905"],["title","The Boy Aviators in Africa; Or, an Aerial Ivory Trail (#1)"],["body"," Frank, giving the angry man on the pavement a hearty slap on the back.  \"Why, this here piratical craft,\" the other was beginning when suddenly he dropped the battered bag he carried and burst into a mighty roar--a regular Cape Horn hail.  \"Back my topsails if it ain't you, Frank,\" he cried, wringing the other's hands till the boy's arms were almost dislocated.  \"And you too, Harry, and keel haul me ef here ain't Billy too.  Well, if it ain't good to see, you Chester boys again.\"  \"Say, are you the Chester Boys--the Boy Aviators?\" suddenly cut in the chauffeur in a respectful tone.  \"We are,\" replied Frank, \"why?\"  \"Oh, well,\" said the chauffeur, \"then I'll let your friend off with fifty cents.  I thought he was a 'greeny'.\"  With that, he calmly twisted the dial of the cab which registered $1.00 back to the fifty cent mark and coolly pocketed the coin the indignant Ben handed.  \"Does that thing work backwards?\" demanded the amazed old adventurer, as the taxi whizzed off before he could frame words to express his indignation.  \"Not often,\" replied Billy with a laugh.  \"I guess that chap reads the papers and thought it wouldn't do him any good to try to fool a particular friend of the Boy Aviators.\"  \"Well, boys, what are your plans?\" demanded Ben, as--after the rugged fellow had been introduced to Mrs. Chester, a sweet-faced old lady, and Mr. Chester, a fine-looking, gray-haired man of about fifty--he and the boys sat in the garage discussing the African outfit.  \"We hardly know now,\" replied Frank, and then in a few words he described Lathrop's letter and its contents.  \"Wherever that boy is there's bound to be doings,\" remarked Ben, sententiously, when the young leader had finished.  \"Down in Florida when he wasn't tumbling into alligators' mouths or getting bit by serpents he was allers up to some mischief--you mark my words there's something in the wind now.\"  The boys talked late and long that night over the letter and what possible plan Mr. Barr, the ivory importer, could have to discuss that would be of interest to them, but they were able to arrive at no definite conclusion except that there was nothing to be done about it till morning.  As for Ben with his usual philosophic attitude toward mysteries, he filled his pipe and silently smoked.  To those of our readers who have not met Ben this phase of his character may seem inexplicable, but to the boys Ben's passive acceptance of any situation had become quite familiar.  Ever since they had rescued the rugged old adventurer from a marooned treasure-mine in Nicaragua and he had shared their strange adventures in Florida on the Chapin Rescue Expedition, the old man had become as much a part of their necessary equipment as the Golden Eagle itself.  He had arrived that night in response to a telegraphed request to his cottage at Amityville on Long Island, where he cultivated an extensive farm--also part of the Quesal ruby profits--and devoted himself to fishing and hunting.  'The Boys' mere word, however, that they were off to Africa had been sufficient to arouse the old man's roving instinct and here he was on deck once more as active as a boy and almost as impatient for the start for the Dark Continent.  Ben slept at the Chester's home that night and if his dreams were not as populated with visions of elephants, leopards, deer, huge snakes and pigmy savages as theirs it was not any lack of interest in the coming expedition that was responsible for it.     CHAPTER II  THE STOLEN IVORY   \"Will you please send this card up to Mr. Beasley's rooms and tell him that the visitors he was expecting are here?\"  It was Frank Chester who spoke early the next day, as the boys, in response to Lathrop's letter, stood at the Waldorf desk.  The clerk looked at them a little disdainfully.  Frank and Harry Chester were not the sort of boys who devoted much time to thinking about clothes and while they both wore dark neat-fitting suits they certainly did look a little out of place among the pasty-faced, cigarette-smoking youths in loud-looking garments who constituted most of the young men with whom the clerk was in the habit of coming in contact.  \"I don't think that Mr. Beasley can see you now, call later,\" he began, superciliously turning round to the letter-rack and sorting out the mail and putting each guest's letters in the proper box.  For a second an angry flush rose to Frank's face.  The man's manner was enough to irritate any high spirited boy.  But Frank Chester was not given to what Bill Barnes called \"flying off the handle.\"  He calmly took another card from his pocket and in a rather sharp voice, though his tones were even enough said:  \"Are you going to send that card up at once or shall I call the room on the telephone?\"  The clerk faced quickly about.  The two youths he had looked upon as rather awkward country bumpkins, judging as he did from their tanned faces and broad shoulders, were evidently not to be trifled with.  He glanced at the card as he rolled it up and handed it to a boy to be placed in a pneumatic tube and shot up to the fourth floor, on which Mr. Beasley and his party had taken rooms.  \"Oh, you are the Chester boys?\" he exclaimed with a strong accent on the \"the\" and in markedly more respectful tones.  \"We are,\" said Frank with a smile which was reflected on his brother's face.  \"I beg your pardon for keeping you waiting, I'm sure,\" said the clerk with an apologetic leer, meant to be an engaging smile.  \"That's all right,\" said Frank shortly, turning away from the desk.  \"Well, having your name in the paper does do you some good after all,\" remarked Harry with a laugh.  \"That fellow certainly turned a flip-flop, when he found out who we were.\"  Five minutes later the boys were ushered into the Beasley rooms and were busily engaged shaking hands and exchanging all sorts of boyish exclamations of welcome with Lathrop Beasley, a tall, rather slender youth who had been their companion in Florida.  Like the boys, Lathrop was an accomplished aviator and wireless operator, although he had not the initiative or the sturdy pluck to perform the feats that they had.  He was, however, a boy of considerable brain and skill and among the boy-aviators of the country held an enviable position.  \"About your letter,\" began Frank when the first greetings were over.  \"In a minute,\" replied Lathrop, \"here's father now.\"  As he spoke, the portieres parted and a stout, fresh complexioned gentleman, ruddy from his bath and shaving, appeared.  He had the pompous manner of the successful man of business and seemed to the Chester boys to be the least bit patronizing in his manner.  \"Mr. Barr will be here in a minute,\" he said, after introductions had been made by Lathrop, \"he will explain to you his idea.  I am merely a partner in the enterprise.  You will, of course, be glad to accept any restrictions he may impose?\"  \"We hardly care to discuss that yet,\" said Frank, rather nettled by Mr. Beasley's pompous manner, \"until we know what he requires.\"  He exchanged glances with Harry.  \"In fact,\" he went on, \"we were planning to take a complete rest and follow in Mr. Roosevelt's foot-steps, by taking a hunting trip in Africa, only,\" he added with a smile, \"we meant to hunt by aeroplane.\"  \"Wonderful,\" said Mr. Beasley, evidently much impressed by Frank's ready manner, \"when I was a boy, if a lad had a \"bone-shaker\" bicycle he thought he was doing something fine, and as for flying--why, we never thought of it.\"  \"Perhaps the boys of to-day are further sighted,\" said Frank with quiet note of sarcasm in his tone that was quite lost on the well-meaning old merchant.  Indeed at that moment Mr. Beasley rose heavily from his chair and stepped forward to greet a new arrival who appeared from another room of the suite.  \"This is Mr. Luther Barr, the famous ivory importer,\" he said, with far more respect in his tones than he had used to the boys; whom indeed, he looked upon as talented chaps, but still boys--which to men of his caliber is an infallible sign that anything such youthful persons may attempt is extremely likely to go wrong.  How erroneous such an opinion is, those of our readers who have followed the adventures of the Chester boys know.  Mr. Luther Barr deserves a new paragraph.  Long, lean and hollow cheeked, the term \"gangling\" fits him better than any other.  Mr. Luther Barr's black suit hung on him as baggily as the garments of a cornfield scarecrow and Mr. Luther Barr's sharp features were not improved by a small growth of gray hair; of the kind known as a \"goatee\" that sprouted from his lower rip.  For the rest of the boys noticed that Mr. Barr was gifted with a singularly gimlet-like pair of steely blue eyes that seemed to bore through you.  \"As sharp a man as ever drove up the price of ivory,\" added Mr. Beasley as he introduced the boys to this singular figure, \"he can scent an ivory bargain--\"  \"From here to Africa,\" struck in Mr. Barr in a sharp nasal tone that grated unpleasantly, \"and you and I are going to be Kings of Wall Street if these boys put this deal through for us,\" he added with what was meant to be an amiable smile, but which, as a matter of fact, distorted his face till it looked uncommonly like an old Japanese war mask.  Indeed the boys, who had seen the collection in the Metropolitan Museum, could not help smiling to themselves, as the same thought struck each of them.  \"Well, Beasley,\" exclaimed Barr suddenly, \"I'm as sharp set as a Long Island fox.  Let's have a bite of breakfast and then we can get down to business.\"  From Mr. Barr's manner of dispatching his breakfast and the remarkable skill with which he wielded his knife, in conveying various morsels to his mouth, it was evident that he had spent so much time piling up money that his social education had been sadly neglected.  Once or twice the boys caught Lathrop's eye and they saw that the lad was blushing with shame at the uncouth manners of his father's friend. For this reason"]]]
