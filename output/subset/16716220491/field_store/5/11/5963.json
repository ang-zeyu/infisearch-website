For some years gates had shown a tendency to fall off, owing to the growing popularity of golf, tennis, and other games. The desire to see the invaders as they marched through the country must draw away thousands who otherwise would have paid their sixpences at the turnstiles. It was suggested that representations should be made to the invading generals with a view to inducing them to make a small charge to sightseers.  In sporting circles the chief interest centered on the race to London. The papers showed the positions of the various armies each morning in their Runners and Betting columns; six to four on the Germans was freely offered, but found no takers.  Considerable interest was displayed in the probable behaviour of the nine armies when they met. The situation was a curious outcome of the modern custom of striking a deadly blow before actually declaring war. Until the moment when the enemy were at her doors, England had imagined that she was on terms of the most satisfactory friendship with her neighbours. The foe had taken full advantage of this, and also of the fact that, owing to a fit of absent-mindedness on the part of the Government, England had no ships afloat which were not entirely obsolete. Interviewed on the subject by representatives of the daily papers, the Government handsomely admitted that it was perhaps in some ways a silly thing to have done; but, they urged, you could not think of everything. Besides, they were on the point of laying down a _Dreadnought_, which would be ready in a very few years. Meanwhile, the best thing the public could do was to sleep quietly in their beds. It was Fisher's tip; and Fisher was a smart man.  And all the while the Invaders' Marathon continued.  Who would be the first to reach London?     Chapter 5  THE GERMANS REACH LONDON   The Germans had got off smartly from the mark and were fully justifying the long odds laid upon them. That master-strategist, Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig, realising that if he wished to reach the Metropolis quickly he must not go by train, had resolved almost at once to walk. Though hampered considerably by crowds of rustics who gathered, gaping, at every point in the line of march, he had made good progress. The German troops had strict orders to reply to no questions, with the result that little time was lost in idle chatter, and in a couple of days it was seen that the army of the Fatherland was bound, barring accidents, to win comfortably.  The progress of the other forces was slower. The Chinese especially had undergone great privations, having lost their way near Llanfairpwlgwnngogogoch, and having been unable to understand the voluble directions given to them by the various shepherds they encountered. It was not for nearly a week that they contrived to reach Chester, where, catching a cheap excursion, they arrived in the metropolis, hungry and footsore, four days after the last of their rivals had taken up their station.  The German advance halted on the wooded heights of Tottenham. Here a camp was pitched and trenches dug.  The march had shown how terrible invasion must of necessity be. With no wish to be ruthless, the troops of Prince Otto had done grievous damage. Cricket-pitches had been trampled down, and in many cases even golf-greens dented by the iron heel of the invader, who rarely, if ever, replaced the divot. Everywhere they had left ruin and misery in their train.  With the other armies it was the same story. Through carefully-preserved woods they had marched, frightening the birds and driving keepers into fits of nervous prostration. Fishing, owing to their tramping carelessly through the streams, was at a standstill. Croquet had been given up in despair.  Near Epping the Russians shot a fox....         *       *       *       *       *  The situation which faced Prince Otto was a delicate one. All his early training and education had implanted in him the fixed idea that, if he ever invaded England, he would do it either alone or with the sympathetic co-operation of allies. He had never faced the problem of what he should do if there were rivals in the field. Competition is wholesome, but only within bounds. He could not very well ask the other nations to withdraw. Nor did he feel inclined to withdraw himself.  \"It all comes of this dashed Swoop of the Vulture business,\" he grumbled, as he paced before his tent, ever and anon pausing to sweep the city below him with his glasses. \"I should like to find the fellow who started the idea! Making me look a fool! Still, it's just as bad for the others, thank goodness! Well, Poppenheim?\"  Captain von Poppenheim approached and saluted.  \"Please, sir, the men say, 'May they bombard London?'\"  \"Bombard London!\"  \"Yes, sir; it's always done.\"  Prince Otto pulled thoughtfully at his moustache.  \"Bombard London! It seems--and yet--ah, well, they have few pleasures.\"  He stood awhile in meditation. So did Captain von Poppenheim. He kicked a pebble. So did Captain von Poppenheim--only a smaller pebble. Discipline is very strict in the German army.  \"Poppenheim.\"  \"Sir?\"  \"Any signs of our--er--competitors?\"  \"Yes, sir; the Russians are coming up on the left flank, sir. They'll be here in a few hours. Raisuli has been arrested at Purley for stealing chickens. The army of Bollygolla is about ten miles out. No news of the field yet, sir.\"  The Prince brooded. Then he spoke, unbosoming himself more freely than was his wont in conversation with his staff.  \"Between you and me, Pop,\" he cried impulsively, \"I'm dashed sorry we ever started this dashed silly invading business. We thought ourselves dashed smart, working in the dark, and giving no sign till the great pounce, and all that sort of dashed nonsense. Seems to me we've simply dashed well landed ourselves in the dashed soup.\"  Captain von Poppenheim saluted in sympathetic silence. He and the prince had been old chums at college. A life-long friendship existed between them. He would have liked to have expressed adhesion verbally to his superior officer's remarks. The words \"I don't think\" trembled on his tongue. But the iron discipline of the German Army gagged him. He saluted again and clicked his heels.  The Prince recovered himself with a strong effort.  \"You say the Russians will be here shortly?\" he said.  \"In a few hours, sir.\"  \"And the men really wish to bombard London?\"  \"It would be a treat to them, sir.\"  \"Well, well, I suppose if we don't do it, somebody else will. And we got here first.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Then--\"  An orderly hurried up and saluted.  \"Telegram, sir.\"  Absently the Prince opened it. Then his eyes lit up.  \"Gotterdammerung!\" he said. \"I never thought of that. 'Smash up London and provide work for unemployed mending it.--GRAYSON,'\" he read. \"Poppenheim.\"  \"Sir?\"  \"Let the bombardment commence.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And let it continue till the Russians arrive. Then it must stop, or there will be complications.\"  Captain von Poppenheim saluted, and withdrew.     Chapter 6  THE BOMBARDMENT OF LONDON   Thus was London bombarded. Fortunately it was August, and there was nobody in town.  Otherwise there might have been loss of life.     Chapter 7  A CONFERENCE OF THE POWERS   The Russians, led by General Vodkakoff, arrived at Hampstead half an hour after the bombardment had ceased, and the rest of the invaders, including Raisuli, who had got off on an _alibi_, dropped in at intervals during the week. By the evening of Saturday, the sixth of August, even the Chinese had limped to the metropolis. And the question now was, What was going to happen? England displayed a polite indifference to the problem. We are essentially a nation of sight-seers. To us the excitement of staring at the invaders was enough. Into the complex international problems to which the situation gave rise it did not occur to us to examine. When you consider that a crowd of five hundred Londoners will assemble in the space of two minutes, abandoning entirely all its other business, to watch a cab-horse that has fallen in the street, it is not surprising that the spectacle of nine separate and distinct armies in the metropolis left no room in the British mind for other reflections.  The attraction was beginning to draw people back to London now. They found that the German shells had had one excellent result, they had demolished nearly all the London statues. And what might have conceivably seemed a draw-back, the fact that they had blown great holes in the wood-paving, passed unnoticed amidst the more extensive operations of the London County Council.  Taking it for all in all, the German gunners had simply been beautifying London. The Albert Hall, struck by a merciful shell, had come down with a run, and was now a heap of picturesque ruins; Whitefield's Tabernacle was a charred mass; and the burning of the Royal Academy proved a great comfort to all. At a mass meeting in Trafalgar Square a hearty vote of thanks was passed, with acclamation, to Prince Otto.  But if Londoners rejoiced, the invaders were very far from doing so. The complicated state of foreign politics made it imperative that there should be no friction between the Powers. Yet here a great number of them were in perhaps as embarrassing a position as ever diplomatists were called upon to unravel. When nine dogs are assembled round one bone, it is rarely on the bone alone that teeth-marks are found at the close of the proceedings.  Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig set himself resolutely to grapple with the problem. His chance of grappling successfully with it was not improved by the stream of telegrams which arrived daily from his Imperial Master, demanding to know whether he had yet subjugated the country, and if not, why not. He had replied guardedly, stating the difficulties which lay in his way, and had received the following: \"At once mailed fist display.

It leaves them in the memory. That day when I blotted my copybook at school, to have had the teacher forgive me ever so kindly would not have made me feel the least bit better so long as the blot was there. It wasn't any penalty from without, but the hurt to my own pride which the spot made, that I wanted taken away, so I might get heart to go on. Supposing one of you--and you'll excuse me for asking you to put yourself a moment in my place--had picked a pocket. Would it make a great deal of difference in your state of mind that the person whose pocket you had picked kindly forgave you, and declined to prosecute? Your offence against him was trifling, and easily repaired. Your chief offence was against yourself, and that was irreparable. No other person with his forgiveness can mediate between you and yourself. Until you have been in such a fix, you can't imagine, perhaps, how curiously impertinent it sounds to hear talk about somebody else forgiving you for ruining yourself. It is like mocking.\"  The nine o'clock bell pealed out from the mill tower.  \"I am trespassing on your kindness, but I have only a few more words to say. The ancients had a beautiful fable about the water of Lethe, in which the soul that was bathed straightway forgot all that was sad and evil in its previous life; the most stained, disgraced, and mournful of souls coming forth fresh, blithe, and bright as a baby's. I suppose my absurd misunderstanding arose from a vague notion that the blood of Christ had in it something like this virtue of Lethe water. Just think how blessed a thing for men it would be if such were indeed the case, if their memories could be cleansed and disinfected at the same time their hearts were purified! Then the most disgraced and ashamed might live good and happy lives again. Men would be redeemed from their sins in fact, and not merely in name. The figurative promises of the Gospel would become literally true. But this is idle dreaming. I will not keep you,\" and, checking himself abruptly, he sat down.  The moment he did so, Mr. Lewis rose and pronounced the benediction, dismissing the meeting without the usual closing hymn. He was afraid that something might be said by Deacon Tuttle or Deacon Miller, who were good men, but not very subtile in their spiritual insight, which would still further alienate the unfortunate young man. His own intention of finding opportunity for a little private talk with him after the meeting was, however, disappointed by the promptness with which Bayley left the room. He did not seem to notice the sympathetic faces and out-stretched hands around him. There was a set smile on his face, and his eyes seemed to look through people without seeing them. There was a buzz of conversation as the people began to talk together of the decided novelty in the line of conference-meeting exhortations to which they had just listened. The tone of almost all was sympathetic, though many were shocked and pained, and others declared that they did not understand what he had meant. Many insisted that he must be a little out of his head, calling attention to the fact that he looked so pale. None of these good hearts were half so much offended by anything heretical in the utterances of the young man as they were stirred with sympathy for his evident discouragement. Mr. Lewis was perhaps the only one who had received a very distinct impression of the line of thought underlying his words, and he came walking down the aisle with his head bent and a very grave face, not joining any of the groups which were engaged in talk. Henry Burr was standing near the door, his hat in his hand, watching Madeline out of the corners of his eyes, as she closed the melodeon and adjusted her shawl.  \"Good-evening, Henry,\" said Mr. Lewis, pausing beside the young man. \"Do you know whether anything unpleasant has happened to George lately to account for what he said to-night?\"  \"I do not, sir,\" replied Henry.  \"I had a fancy that he might have been slighted by some one, or given the cold shoulder. He is very sensitive.\"  \"I don't think any one in the village would slight him,\" said Henry.  \"I should have said so too,\" remarked the minister, reflectively. \"Poor boy, poor boy! He seems to feel very badly, and it is hard to know how to cheer him.\"  \"Yes, sir--that is--certainly,\" replied Henry incoherently, for Madeline was now coming down the aisle.  In his own preoccupation not noticing the young man's, Mr. Lewis passed out.  As she approached the door Madeline was talking animatedly with another young lady.  \"Good-evening,\" said Henry.  \"Poor fellow!\" continued Madeline to her companion, \"he seemed quite hopeless.\"  \"Good-evening,\" repeated Henry.  Looking around, she appeared to observe him for the first time. \"Good-evening,\" she said.  \"May I escort you home?\" he asked, becoming slightly red in the face.  She looked at him for a moment as if she could scarcely believe her ears that such an audacious proposal had been made to her. Then she said, with a bewitching smile--  \"I shall be much obliged.\"  As he drew her arm beneath his own the contact diffused an ecstatic sensation of security through his stalwart but tremulous limbs. He had got her, and his tribulations were forgotten. For a while they walked silently along the dark streets, both too much impressed by the tragic suggestions of poor Bayley's outbreak to drop at once into trivialities. For it must be understood that Madeline's little touch of coquetry had been merely instinctive, a sort of unconscious reflex action of the feminine nervous system, quite consistent with very lugubrious engrossments.  To Henry there was something strangely sweet in sharing with her for the first time a mood of solemnity, seeing that their intercourse had always before been in the vein of pleasantry and badinage common to the first stages of courtships. This new experience appeared to dignify their relation, and weave them together with a new strand. At length she said--  \"Why didn't you go after poor George and cheer him up instead of going home with me? Anybody could have done that.\"  \"No doubt,\" replied Henry, seriously; \"but, if I'd left anybody else to do it, I should have needed cheering up as much as George does.\"  \"Dear me,\" she exclaimed, as a little smile, not exactly of vexation, curved her lips under cover of the darkness, \"you take a most unwarrantable liberty in being jealous of me. I never gave you nor anybody else any right to be, and I won't have it!\"  \"Very well. It shall be just as you say,\" he replied. The sarcastic humility of his tone made her laugh in spite of herself, and she immediately changed the subject, demanding--  \"Where is Laura to-night?\"  \"She's at home, making cake for the picnic,\" he said.  \"The good girl! and I ought to be making some, too. I wonder if poor George will be at the picnic?\"  \"I doubt it,\" said Henry. \"You know he never goes to any sort of party. The last time I saw him at such a place was at Mr. Bradford's. He was playing whist, and they were joking about cheating. Somebody said--Mr. Bradford it was--'I can trust my wife's honesty. She doesn't know enough to cheat, but I don't know about George.' George was her partner. Bradford didn't mean any harm; he forgot, you see. He'd have bitten his tongue off otherwise sooner than have said it. But everybody saw the application, and there was a dead silence. George got red as fire, and then pale as death. I don't know how they finished the hand, but presently somebody made an excuse, and the game was broken off.\"  \"Oh, dear! dear! That was cruel! cruel! How could Mr. Bradford do it? I should think he would never forgive himself! never!\" exclaimed Madeline, with an accent of poignant sympathy, involuntarily pressing Henry's arm, and thereby causing him instantly to forget all about George and his misfortunes, and setting his heart to beating so tumultuously that he was afraid she would notice it and be offended. But she did not seem to be conscious of the intoxicating effluence she was giving forth, and presently added, in a tone of sweetest pity--  \"He used to be so frank and dashing in his manner, and now when he meets one of us girls on the street he seems so embarrassed, and looks away or at the ground, as if he thought we should not like to bow to him, or meant to cut him. I'm sure we'd cut our heads off sooner. It's enough to make one cry, such times, to see how wretched he is, and so sensitive that no one can say a word to cheer him. Did you notice what he said about leaving town? I hadn't heard anything about it before, had you?\"  \"No,\" said Henry, \"not a word. Wonder where he's going. Perhaps he thinks it will be easier for him in some place where they don't know him.\"  They walked on in silence a few moments, and then Madeline said, in a musing tone--  \"How strange it would seem if one really could have unpleasant things blotted out of their memories! What dreadful thing would you forget now, if you could? Confess.\"  \"I would blot out the recollection that you went boat-riding with Will Taylor last Wednesday afternoon, and what I've felt about it ever since.\"  \"Dear me, Mr. Henry Burr,\" said Madeline, with an air of excessive disdain, \"how long is it since I authorized you to concern yourself with my affairs? If it wouldn't please you too much, I'd certainly box your ears.  \"I think you're rather unreasonable,\" he protested, in a hurt tone. \"You said a minute ago that you wouldn't permit me to be jealous of you, and just because I'm so anxious to obey you that I want to forget that I ever was, you are vexed.\"  A small noise, expressive of scorn, and not to be represented by letters of the alphabet, was all the reply she deigned to this more ingenious than ingenuous plea.  \"I've made my confession, and it's only fair you should make yours,\" he said next. \"What remorseful deed have you done that you'd like to forget?\"  \"You needn't speak in that"]]]
