May she live to laugh at it, as long as she _can_ laugh, and then say, with the French wit, “The farce is ended; draw the curtain.”’  ‘The French wit,’ said Mr. Snitchey, peeping sharply into his blue bag, ‘was wrong, Doctor Jeddler, and your philosophy is altogether wrong, depend upon it, as I have often told you.  Nothing serious in life!  What do you call law?’  ‘A joke,’ replied the Doctor.  ‘Did you ever go to law?’ asked Mr. Snitchey, looking out of the blue bag.  ‘Never,’ returned the Doctor.  ‘If you ever do,’ said Mr. Snitchey, ‘perhaps you’ll alter that opinion.’  Craggs, who seemed to be represented by Snitchey, and to be conscious of little or no separate existence or personal individuality, offered a remark of his own in this place.  It involved the only idea of which he did not stand seized and possessed in equal moieties with Snitchey; but, he had some partners in it among the wise men of the world.  ‘It’s made a great deal too easy,’ said Mr. Craggs.  ‘Law is?’ asked the Doctor.  ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Craggs, ‘everything is.  Everything appears to me to be made too easy, now-a-days.  It’s the vice of these times.  If the world is a joke (I am not prepared to say it isn’t), it ought to be made a very difficult joke to crack.  It ought to be as hard a struggle, sir, as possible.  That’s the intention.  But, it’s being made far too easy.  We are oiling the gates of life.  They ought to be rusty.  We shall have them beginning to turn, soon, with a smooth sound.  Whereas they ought to grate upon their hinges, sir.’  Mr. Craggs seemed positively to grate upon his own hinges, as he delivered this opinion; to which he communicated immense effect—being a cold, hard, dry, man, dressed in grey and white, like a flint; with small twinkles in his eyes, as if something struck sparks out of them.  The three natural kingdoms, indeed, had each a fanciful representative among this brotherhood of disputants; for Snitchey was like a magpie or raven (only not so sleek), and the Doctor had a streaked face like a winter-pippin, with here and there a dimple to express the peckings of the birds, and a very little bit of pigtail behind that stood for the stalk.  As the active figure of a handsome young man, dressed for a journey, and followed by a porter bearing several packages and baskets, entered the orchard at a brisk pace, and with an air of gaiety and hope that accorded well with the morning, these three drew together, like the brothers of the sister Fates, or like the Graces most effectually disguised, or like the three weird prophets on the heath, and greeted him.  ‘Happy returns, Alf!’ said the Doctor, lightly.  ‘A hundred happy returns of this auspicious day, Mr. Heathfield!’ said Snitchey, bowing low.  ‘Returns!’ Craggs murmured in a deep voice, all alone.  ‘Why, what a battery!’ exclaimed Alfred, stopping short, ‘and one—two—three—all foreboders of no good, in the great sea before me.  I am glad you are not the first I have met this morning: I should have taken it for a bad omen.  But, Grace was the first—sweet, pleasant Grace—so I defy you all!’  ‘If you please, Mister, I was the first you know,’ said Clemency Newcome. ‘She was walking out here, before sunrise, you remember.  I was in the house.’  ‘That’s true!  Clemency was the first,’ said Alfred.  ‘So I defy you with Clemency.’  ‘Ha, ha, ha,—for Self and Craggs,’ said Snitchey.  ‘What a defiance!’  ‘Not so bad a one as it appears, may be,’ said Alfred, shaking hands heartily with the Doctor, and also with Snitchey and Craggs, and then looking round.  ‘Where are the—Good Heavens!’  With a start, productive for the moment of a closer partnership between Jonathan Snitchey and Thomas Craggs than the subsisting articles of agreement in that wise contemplated, he hastily betook himself to where the sisters stood together, and—however, I needn’t more particularly explain his manner of saluting Marion first, and Grace afterwards, than by hinting that Mr. Craggs may possibly have considered it ‘too easy.’  Perhaps to change the subject, Dr. Jeddler made a hasty move towards the breakfast, and they all sat down at table.  Grace presided; but so discreetly stationed herself, as to cut off her sister and Alfred from the rest of the company.  Snitchey and Craggs sat at opposite corners, with the blue bag between them for safety; the Doctor took his usual position, opposite to Grace.  Clemency hovered galvanically about the table, as waitress; and the melancholy Britain, at another and a smaller board, acted as Grand Carver of a round of beef and a ham.  ‘Meat?’ said Britain, approaching Mr. Snitchey, with the carving knife and fork in his hands, and throwing the question at him like a missile.  ‘Certainly,’ returned the lawyer.  ‘Do _you_ want any?’ to Craggs.  ‘Lean and well done,’ replied that gentleman.  Having executed these orders, and moderately supplied the Doctor (he seemed to know that nobody else wanted anything to eat), he lingered as near the Firm as he decently could, watching with an austere eye their disposition of the viands, and but once relaxing the severe expression of his face.  This was on the occasion of Mr. Craggs, whose teeth were not of the best, partially choking, when he cried out with great animation, ‘I thought he was gone!’  ‘Now, Alfred,’ said the Doctor, ‘for a word or two of business, while we are yet at breakfast.’  ‘While we are yet at breakfast,’ said Snitchey and Craggs, who seemed to have no present idea of leaving off.  Although Alfred had not been breakfasting, and seemed to have quite enough business on his hands as it was, he respectfully answered:  ‘If you please, sir.’  ‘If anything could be serious,’ the Doctor began, ‘in such a—’  ‘Farce as this, sir,’ hinted Alfred.  ‘In such a farce as this,’ observed the Doctor, ‘it might be this recurrence, on the eve of separation, of a double birth-day, which is connected with many associations pleasant to us four, and with the recollection of a long and amicable intercourse.  That’s not to the purpose.’  ‘Ah! yes, yes, Dr. Jeddler,’ said the young man.  ‘It is to the purpose. Much to the purpose, as my heart bears witness this morning; and as yours does too, I know, if you would let it speak.  I leave your house to-day; I cease to be your ward to-day; we part with tender relations stretching far behind us, that never can be exactly renewed, and with others dawning—yet before us,’ he looked down at Marion beside him, ‘fraught with such considerations as I must not trust myself to speak of now. Come, come!’ he added, rallying his spirits and the Doctor at once, ‘there’s a serious grain in this large foolish dust-heap, Doctor.  Let us allow to-day, that there is One.’  ‘To-day!’ cried the Doctor.  ‘Hear him!  Ha, ha, ha!  Of all days in the foolish year.  Why, on this day, the great battle was fought on this ground.  On this ground where we now sit, where I saw my two girls dance this morning, where the fruit has just been gathered for our eating from these trees, the roots of which are struck in Men, not earth,—so many lives were lost, that within my recollection, generations afterwards, a churchyard full of bones, and dust of bones, and chips of cloven skulls, has been dug up from underneath our feet here.  Yet not a hundred people in that battle knew for what they fought, or why; not a hundred of the inconsiderate rejoicers in the victory, why they rejoiced.  Not half a hundred people were the better for the gain or loss.  Not half-a-dozen men agree to this hour on the cause or merits; and nobody, in short, ever knew anything distinct about it, but the mourners of the slain.  Serious, too!’ said the Doctor, laughing.  ‘Such a system!’  ‘But, all this seems to me,’ said Alfred, ‘to be very serious.’  ‘Serious!’ cried the Doctor.  ‘If you allowed such things to be serious, you must go mad, or die, or climb up to the top of a mountain, and turn hermit.’  ‘Besides—so long ago,’ said Alfred.  ‘Long ago!’ returned the Doctor.  ‘Do you know what the world has been doing, ever since?  Do you know what else it has been doing?  _I_ don’t!’  ‘It has gone to law a little,’ observed Mr. Snitchey, stirring his tea.  ‘Although the way out has been always made too easy,’ said his partner.  ‘And you’ll excuse my saying, Doctor,’ pursued Mr. Snitchey, ‘having been already put a thousand times in possession of my opinion, in the course of our discussions, that, in its having gone to law, and in its legal system altogether, I do observe a serious side—now, really, a something tangible, and with a purpose and intention in it—’  Clemency Newcome made an angular tumble against the table, occasioning a sounding clatter among the cups and saucers.  ‘Heyday! what’s the matter there?’ exclaimed the Doctor.  ‘It’s this evil-inclined blue bag,’ said Clemency, ‘always tripping up somebody!’  ‘With a purpose and intention in it, I was saying,’ resumed Snitchey, ‘that commands respect.  Life a farce, Dr. Jeddler?  With law in it?’  The Doctor laughed, and looked at Alfred.  ‘Granted, if you please, that war is foolish,’ said Snitchey.  ‘There we agree.  For example.  Here’s a smiling country,’ pointing it out with his fork, ‘once overrun by soldiers—trespassers every man of ’em—and laid waste by fire and sword.  He, he, he!  The idea of any man exposing himself, voluntarily, to fire and sword!  Stupid, wasteful, positively ridiculous; you laugh at your fellow-creatures, you know, when you think of it!  But take this smiling country as it stands.  Think of the laws appertaining to real property; to the bequest and devise of real property; to the mortgage and redemption of real property; to leasehold, freehold, and copyhold estate; think,’ said Mr. Snitchey, with such great emotion that he actually smacked his lips, ‘of the complicated laws relating to title and proof of title, with all the contradictory precedents and numerous acts of parliament connected with them; think of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6764"],["title","Army Life in a Black Regiment (#1)"],["body","overhead, gulls wheeled and shrieked, and the broad river rippled duskily towards Beaufort.  The shores were low and wooded, like any New England shore; there were a few gunboats, twenty schooners, and some steamers, among them the famous \"Planter,\" which Robert Small, the slave, presented to the nation. The river-banks were soft and graceful, though low, and as we steamed up to Beaufort on the flood-tide this morning, it seemed almost as fair as the smooth and lovely canals which Stedman traversed to meet his negro soldiers in Surinam. The air was cool as at home, yet the foliage seemed green, glimpses of stiff tropical vegetation appeared along the banks, with great clumps of shrubs, whose pale seed-vessels looked like tardy blossoms. Then we saw on a picturesque point an old plantation, with stately magnolia avenue, decaying house, and tiny church amid the woods, reminding me of Virginia; behind it stood a neat encampment of white tents, \"and there,\" said my companion, \"is your future regiment.\"  Three miles farther brought us to the pretty town of Beaufort, with its stately houses amid Southern foliage. Reporting to General Saxton, I had the luck to encounter a company of my destined command, marched in to be mustered into the United States service. They were unarmed, and all looked as thoroughly black as the most faithful philanthropist could desire; there did not seem to be so much as a mulatto among them. Their coloring suited me, all but the legs, which were clad in a lively scarlet, as intolerable to my eyes as if I had been a turkey. I saw them mustered; General Saxton talked to them a little, in his direct, manly way; they gave close attention, though their faces looked impenetrable. Then I conversed with some of them. The first to whom I spoke had been wounded in a small expedition after lumber, from which a party had just returned, and in which they had been under fire and had done very well. I said, pointing to his lame arm,  \"Did you think that was more than you bargained for, my man?\"  His answer came promptly and stoutly,  \"I been a-tinking, Mas'r, dot's jess what I went for.\"  I thought this did well enough for my very first interchange of dialogue with my recruits.   November 27, 1862.  Thanksgiving-Day; it is the first moment I have had for writing during these three days, which have installed me into a new mode of life so thoroughly that they seem three years. Scarcely pausing in New York or in Beaufort, there seems to have been for me but one step from the camp of a Massachusetts regiment to this, and that step over leagues of waves.  It is a holiday wherever General Saxton's proclamation reaches. The chilly sunshine and the pale blue river seems like New England, but those alone. The air is full of noisy drumming, and of gunshots; for the prize-shooting is our great celebration of the day, and the drumming is chronic. My young barbarians are all at play. I look out from the broken windows of this forlorn plantation-house, through avenues of great live-oaks, with their hard, shining leaves, and their branches hung with a universal drapery of soft, long moss, like fringe-trees struck with grayness. Below, the sandy soil, scantly covered with coarse grass, bristles with sharp palmettoes and aloes; all the vegetation is stiff, shining, semi-tropical, with nothing soft or delicate in its texture. Numerous plantation-buildings totter around, all slovenly and unattractive, while the interspaces are filled with all manner of wreck and refuse, pigs, fowls, dogs, and omnipresent Ethiopian infancy. All this is the universal Southern panorama; but five minutes' walk beyond the hovels and the live-oaks will bring one to something so un-Southern that the whole Southern coast at this moment trembles at the suggestion of such a thing, the camp of a regiment of freed slaves.  One adapts one's self so readily to new surroundings that already the full zest of the novelty seems passing away from my perceptions, and I write these lines in an eager effort to retain all I can. Already I am growing used to the experience, at first so novel, of living among five hundred men, and scarce a white face to be seen, of seeing them go through all their daily processes, eating, frolicking, talking, just as if they were white. Each day at dress-parade I stand with the customary folding of the arms before a regimental line of countenances so black that I can hardly tell whether the men stand steadily or not; black is every hand which moves in ready cadence as I vociferate, \"Battalion! Shoulder arms!\" nor is it till the line of white officers moves forward, as parade is dismissed, that I am reminded that my own face is not the color of coal.  The first few days on duty with a new regiment must be devoted almost wholly to tightening reins; in this process one deals chiefly with the officers, and I have as yet had but little personal intercourse with the men. They concern me chiefly in bulk, as so many consumers of rations, wearers of uniforms, bearers of muskets. But as the machine comes into shape, I am beginning to decipher the individual parts. At first, of course, they all looked just alike; the variety comes afterwards, and they are just as distinguishable, the officers say, as so many whites. Most of them are wholly raw, but there are many who have already been for months in camp in the abortive \"Hunter Regiment,\" yet in that loose kind of way which, like average militia training, is a doubtful advantage. I notice that some companies, too, look darker than others, though all are purer African than I expected. This is said to be partly a geographical difference between the South Carolina and Florida men. When the Rebels evacuated this region they probably took with them the house-servants, including most of the mixed blood, so that the residuum seems very black. But the men brought from Fernandina the other day average lighter in complexion, and look more intelligent, and they certainly take wonderfully to the drill.  It needs but a few days to show the absurdity of distrusting the military availability of these people. They have quite as much average comprehension as whites of the need of the thing, as much courage (I doubt not), as much previous knowledge of the gun, and, above all, a readiness of ear and of imitation, which, for purposes of drill, counterbalances any defect of mental training. To learn the drill, one does not want a set of college professors; one wants a squad of eager, active, pliant school-boys; and the more childlike these pupils are the better. There is no trouble about the drill; they will surpass whites in that. As to camp-life, they have little to sacrifice; they are better fed, housed, and clothed than ever in their lives before, and they appear to have few inconvenient vices. They are simple, docile, and affectionate almost to the point of absurdity. The same men who stood fire in open field with perfect coolness, on the late expedition, have come to me blubbering in the most irresistibly ludicrous manner on being transferred from one company in the regiment to another.  In noticing the squad-drills I perceive that the men learn less laboriously than whites that \"double, double, toil and trouble,\" which is the elementary vexation of the drill-master, that they more rarely mistake their left for their right, and are more grave and sedate while under instruction. The extremes of jollity and sobriety, being greater with them, are less liable to be intermingled; these companies can be driven with a looser rein than my former one, for they restrain themselves; but the moment they are dismissed from drill every tongue is relaxed and every ivory tooth visible. This morning I wandered about where the different companies were target-shooting, and their glee was contagious. Such exulting shouts of \"Ki! ole man,\" when some steady old turkey-shooter brought his gun down for an instant's aim, and then unerringly hit the mark; and then, when some unwary youth fired his piece into the ground at half-cock such guffawing and delight, such rolling over and over on the grass, such dances of ecstasy, as made the \"Ethiopian minstrelsy\" of the stage appear a feeble imitation.  Evening. Better still was a scene on which I stumbled to-night. Strolling in the cool moonlight, I was attracted by a brilliant light beneath the trees, and cautiously approached it. A circle of thirty or forty soldiers sat around a roaring fire, while one old uncle, Cato by name, was narrating an interminable tale, to the insatiable delight of his audience. I came up into the dusky background, perceived only by a few, and he still continued. It was a narrative, dramatized to the last degree, of his adventures in escaping from his master to the Union vessels; and even I, who have heard the stories of Harriet Tubman, and such wonderful slave-comedians, never witnessed such a piece of acting. When I came upon the scene he had just come unexpectedly upon a plantation-house, and, putting a bold face upon it, had walked up to the door.  \"Den I go up to de white man, berry humble, and say, would he please gib ole man a mouthful for eat?  \"He say he must hab de valeration ob half a dollar.  \"Den I look berry sorry, and turn for go away.  \"Den he say I might gib him dat hatchet I had.  \"Den I say\" (this in a tragic vein) \"dat I must hab dat hatchet for defend myself _from de dogs_!\"  [Immense applause, and one appreciating auditor says, chuckling, \"Dat was your _arms_, ole man,\" which brings down the house again.]  \"Den he say de Yankee pickets was near by, and I must be very keerful.  \"Den I say, 'Good Lord, Mas'r, am dey?'\"  Words cannot express the complete dissimulation with which these accents of terror were uttered, this being precisely the piece of information he wished to obtain.  Then he narrated his devices to get into the house at night and obtain some food, how a dog flew at him, how the whole household, black and white, rose in "]]]
