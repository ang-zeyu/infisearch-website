At least I have had that great happiness in life; nor can Caspak, with all her horrors, expunge that which has been.  So for the thousandth time I thank the strange fate which sent that lifeboat hurtling upward from the green pit of destruction to which it had been dragged--sent it far up above the surface, emptying its water as it rose above the waves, and dropping it upon the surface of the sea, buoyant and safe.  It did not take me long to clamber over its side and drag Nobs in to comparative safety, and then I glanced around upon the scene of death and desolation which surrounded us.  The sea was littered with wreckage among which floated the pitiful forms of women and children, buoyed up by their useless lifebelts. Some were torn and mangled; others lay rolling quietly to the motion of the sea, their countenances composed and peaceful; others were set in hideous lines of agony or horror. Close to the boat's side floated the figure of a girl.  Her face was turned upward, held above the surface by her life-belt, and was framed in a floating mass of dark and waving hair.  She was very beautiful.  I had never looked upon such perfect features, such a divine molding which was at the same time human--intensely human.  It was a face filled with character and strength and femininity--the face of one who was created to love and to be loved.  The cheeks were flushed to the hue of life and health and vitality, and yet she lay there upon the bosom of the sea, dead.  I felt something rise in my throat as I looked down upon that radiant vision, and I swore that I should live to avenge her murder.  And then I let my eyes drop once more to the face upon the water, and what I saw nearly tumbled me backward into the sea, for the eyes in the dead face had opened; the lips had parted; and one hand was raised toward me in a mute appeal for succor.  She lived! She was not dead! I leaned over the boat's side and drew her quickly in to the comparative safety which God had given me.  I removed her life-belt and my soggy coat and made a pillow for her head.  I chafed her hands and arms and feet.  I worked over her for an hour, and at last I was rewarded by a deep sigh, and again those great eyes opened and looked into mine.  At that I was all embarrassment.  I have never been a ladies' man; at Leland-Stanford I was the butt of the class because of my hopeless imbecility in the presence of a pretty girl; but the men liked me, nevertheless.  I was rubbing one of her hands when she opened her eyes, and I dropped it as though it were a red-hot rivet. Those eyes took me in slowly from head to foot; then they wandered slowly around the horizon marked by the rising and falling gunwales of the lifeboat. They looked at Nobs and softened, and then came back to me filled with questioning.  \"I--I--\" I stammered, moving away and stumbling over the next thwart. The vision smiled wanly.  \"Aye-aye, sir!\" she replied faintly, and again her lips drooped, and her long lashes swept the firm, fair texture of her skin.  \"I hope that you are feeling better,\" I finally managed to say.  \"Do you know,\" she said after a moment of silence, \"I have been awake for a long time!  But I did not dare open my eyes. I thought I must be dead, and I was afraid to look, for fear that I should see nothing but blackness about me.  I am afraid to die!  Tell me what happened after the ship went down. I remember all that happened before--oh, but I wish that I might forget it!\"  A sob broke her voice.  \"The beasts!\" she went on after a moment.  \"And to think that I was to have married one of them--a lieutenant in the German navy.\"  Presently she resumed as though she had not ceased speaking. \"I went down and down and down.  I thought I should never cease to sink.  I felt no particular distress until I suddenly started upward at ever-increasing velocity; then my lungs seemed about to burst, and I must have lost consciousness, for I remember nothing more until I opened my eyes after listening to a torrent of invective against Germany and Germans.  Tell me, please, all that happened after the ship sank.\"  I told her, then, as well as I could, all that I had seen--the submarine shelling the open boats and all the rest of it. She thought it marvelous that we should have been spared in so providential a manner, and I had a pretty speech upon my tongue's end, but lacked the nerve to deliver it.  Nobs had come over and nosed his muzzle into her lap, and she stroked his ugly face, and at last she leaned over and put her cheek against his forehead. I have always admired Nobs; but this was the first time that it had ever occurred to me that I might wish to be Nobs.  I wondered how he would take it, for he is as unused to women as I.  But he took to it as a duck takes to water.  What I lack of being a ladies' man, Nobs certainly makes up for as a ladies' dog. The old scalawag just closed his eyes and put on one of the softest \"sugar-wouldn't-melt-in-my-mouth\" expressions you ever saw and stood there taking it and asking for more.  It made me jealous.  \"You seem fond of dogs,\" I said.  \"I am fond of this dog,\" she replied.  Whether she meant anything personal in that reply I did not know; but I took it as personal and it made me feel mighty good.  As we drifted about upon that vast expanse of loneliness it is not strange that we should quickly become well acquainted. Constantly we scanned the horizon for signs of smoke, venturing guesses as to our chances of rescue; but darkness settled, and the black night enveloped us without ever the sight of a speck upon the waters.  We were thirsty, hungry, uncomfortable, and cold.  Our wet garments had dried but little and I knew that the girl must be in grave danger from the exposure to a night of cold and wet upon the water in an open boat, without sufficient clothing and no food.  I had managed to bail all the water out of the boat with cupped hands, ending by mopping the balance up with my handkerchief--a slow and back-breaking procedure; thus I had made a comparatively dry place for the girl to lie down low in the bottom of the boat, where the sides would protect her from the night wind, and when at last she did so, almost overcome as she was by weakness and fatigue, I threw my wet coat over her further to thwart the chill.  But it was of no avail; as I sat watching her, the moonlight marking out the graceful curves of her slender young body, I saw her shiver.  \"Isn't there something I can do?\" I asked.  \"You can't lie there chilled through all night.  Can't you suggest something?\"  She shook her head.  \"We must grin and bear it,\" she replied after a moment.  Nobbler came and lay down on the thwart beside me, his back against my leg, and I sat staring in dumb misery at the girl, knowing in my heart of hearts that she might die before morning came, for what with the shock and exposure, she had already gone through enough to kill almost any woman. And as I gazed down at her, so small and delicate and helpless, there was born slowly within my breast a new emotion.  It had never been there before; now it will never cease to be there.  It made me almost frantic in my desire to find some way to keep warm the cooling lifeblood in her veins.  I was cold myself, though I had almost forgotten it until Nobbler moved and I felt a new sensation of cold along my leg against which he had lain, and suddenly realized that in that one spot I had been warm.  Like a great light came the understanding of a means to warm the girl.  Immediately I knelt beside her to put my scheme into practice when suddenly I was overwhelmed with embarrassment.  Would she permit it, even if I could muster the courage to suggest it?  Then I saw her frame convulse, shudderingly, her muscles reacting to her rapidly lowering temperature, and casting prudery to the winds, I threw myself down beside her and took her in my arms, pressing her body close to mine.  She drew away suddenly, voicing a little cry of fright, and tried to push me from her.  \"Forgive me,\" I managed to stammer.  \"It is the only way. You will die of exposure if you are not warmed, and Nobs and I are the only means we can command for furnishing warmth.\" And I held her tightly while I called Nobs and bade him lie down at her back.  The girl didn't struggle any more when she learned my purpose; but she gave two or three little gasps, and then began to cry softly, burying her face on my arm, and thus she fell asleep.    Chapter 2  Toward morning,  I must have dozed, though it seemed to me at the time that I had lain awake for days, instead of hours.  When I finally opened my eyes, it was daylight, and the girl's hair was in my face, and she was breathing normally.  I thanked God for that.  She had turned her head during the night so that as I opened my eyes I saw her face not an inch from mine, my lips almost touching hers.  It was Nobs who finally awoke her.  He got up, stretched, turned around a few times and lay down again, and the girl opened her eyes and looked into mine.  Hers went very wide at first, and then slowly comprehension came to her, and she smiled.  \"You have been very good to me,\" she said, as I helped her to rise, though if the truth were known I was more in need of assistance than she; the circulation all along my left side seeming to be paralyzed entirely.  \"You have been very good to me.\" And that was the only mention she ever made of it; yet I know that she was thankful and that only reserve prevented her from referring to what, to say the least, was an embarrassing situation, however unavoidable.  Shortly after daylight we saw smoke apparently coming straight toward us, and after a time we made out the squat lines of a tug--one of those fearless exponents of England's supremacy of the sea that tows sailing ships into French and English ports. I stood up on a thwart and waved my soggy coat above my head. Nobs stood upon another and barked.  The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/551"],["title","The Land That Time Forgot (#2)"],["body"," sat at my feet straining her eyes toward the deck of the oncoming boat. \"They see us,\" she said at last.  \"There is a man answering your signal.\" She was right.  A lump came into my throat--for her sake rather than for mine.  She was saved, and none too soon. She could not have lived through another night upon the Channel; she might not have lived through the coming day.  The tug came close beside us, and a man on deck threw us a rope. Willing hands dragged us to the deck, Nobs scrambling nimbly aboard without assistance.  The rough men were gentle as mothers with the girl.  Plying us both with questions they hustled her to the captain's cabin and me to the boiler-room.  They told the girl to take off her wet clothes and throw them outside the door that they might be dried, and then to slip into the captain's bunk and get warm.  They didn't have to tell me to strip after I once got into the warmth of the boiler-room.  In a jiffy, my clothes hung about where they might dry most quickly, and I myself was absorbing, through every pore, the welcome heat of the stifling compartment.  They brought us hot soup and coffee, and then those who were not on duty sat around and helped me damn the Kaiser and his brood.  As soon as our clothes were dry, they bade us don them, as the chances were always more than fair in those waters that we should run into trouble with the enemy, as I was only too well aware. What with the warmth and the feeling of safety for the girl, and the knowledge that a little rest and food would quickly overcome the effects of her experiences of the past dismal hours, I was feeling more content than I had experienced since those three whistle-blasts had shattered the peace of my world the previous afternoon.  But peace upon the Channel has been but a transitory thing since August, 1914.  It proved itself such that morning, for I had scarce gotten into my dry clothes and taken the girl's apparel to the captain's cabin when an order was shouted down into the engine-room for full speed ahead, and an instant later I heard the dull boom of a gun. In a moment I was up on deck to see an enemy submarine about two hundred yards off our port bow.  She had signaled us to stop, and our skipper had ignored the order; but now she had her gun trained on us, and the second shot grazed the cabin, warning the belligerent tug-captain that it was time to obey.  Once again an order went down to the engine-room, and the tug reduced speed.  The U-boat ceased firing and ordered the tug to come about and approach.  Our momentum had carried us a little beyond the enemy craft, but we were turning now on the arc of a circle that would bring us alongside her.  As I stood watching the maneuver and wondering what was to become of us, I felt something touch my elbow and turned to see the girl standing at my side.  She looked up into my face with a rueful expression. \"They seem bent on our destruction,\" she said, \"and it looks like the same boat that sunk us yesterday.\"  \"It is,\" I replied.  \"I know her well.  I helped design her and took her out on her first run.\"  The girl drew back from me with a little exclamation of surprise and disappointment.  \"I thought you were an American,\" she said. \"I had no idea you were a--a--\"  \"Nor am I,\" I replied.  \"Americans have been building submarines for all nations for many years.  I wish, though, that we had gone bankrupt, my father and I, before ever we turned out that Frankenstein of a thing.\"  We were approaching the U-boat at half speed now, and I could almost distinguish the features of the men upon her deck. A sailor stepped to my side and slipped something hard and cold into my hand.  I did not have to look at it to know that it was a heavy pistol.  \"Tyke 'er an' use 'er,\" was all he said.  Our bow was pointed straight toward the U-boat now as I heard word passed to the engine for full speed ahead.  I instantly grasped the brazen effrontery of the plucky English skipper--he was going to ram five hundreds tons of U-boat in the face of her trained gun.  I could scarce repress a cheer.  At first the boches didn't seem to grasp his intention.  Evidently they thought they were witnessing an exhibition of poor seamanship, and they yelled their warnings to the tug to reduce speed and throw the helm hard to port.  We were within fifty feet of them when they awakened to the intentional menace of our maneuver.  Their gun crew was off its guard; but they sprang to their piece now and sent a futile shell above our heads. Nobs leaped about and barked furiously.  \"Let 'em have it!\" commanded the tug-captain, and instantly revolvers and rifles poured bullets upon the deck of the submersible.  Two of the gun-crew went down; the other trained their piece at the water-line of the oncoming tug.  The balance of those on deck replied to our small-arms fire, directing their efforts toward the man at our wheel.  I hastily pushed the girl down the companionway leading to the engine-room, and then I raised my pistol and fired my first shot at a boche.  What happened in the next few seconds happened so quickly that details are rather blurred in my memory.  I saw the helmsman lunge forward upon the wheel, pulling the helm around so that the tug sheered off quickly from her course, and I recall realizing that all our efforts were to be in vain, because of all the men aboard, Fate had decreed that this one should fall first to an enemy bullet.  I saw the depleted gun-crew on the submarine fire their piece and I felt the shock of impact and heard the loud explosion as the shell struck and exploded in our bows.  I saw and realized these things even as I was leaping into the pilot-house and grasping the wheel, standing astride the dead body of the helmsman.  With all my strength I threw the helm to starboard; but it was too late to effect the purpose of our skipper.  The best I did was to scrape alongside the sub. I heard someone shriek an order into the engine-room; the boat shuddered and trembled to the sudden reversing of the engines, and our speed quickly lessened.  Then I saw what that madman of a skipper planned since his first scheme had gone wrong.  With a loud-yelled command, he leaped to the slippery deck of the submersible, and at his heels came his hardy crew.  I sprang from the pilot-house and followed, not to be left out in the cold when it came to strafing the boches.  From the engine room companionway came the engineer and stockers, and together we leaped after the balance of the crew and into the hand-to-hand fight that was covering the wet deck with red blood.  Beside me came Nobs, silent now, and grim.  Germans were emerging from the open hatch to take part in the battle on deck. At first the pistols cracked amidst the cursing of the men and the loud commands of the commander and his junior; but presently we were too indiscriminately mixed to make it safe to use our firearms, and the battle resolved itself into a hand-to-hand struggle for possession of the deck.  The sole aim of each of us was to hurl one of the opposing force into the sea.  I shall never forget the hideous expression upon the face of the great Prussian with whom chance confronted me. He lowered his head and rushed at me, bellowing like a bull. With a quick side-step and ducking low beneath his outstretched arms, I eluded him; and as he turned to come back at me, I landed a blow upon his chin which sent him spinning toward the edge of the deck.  I saw his wild endeavors to regain his equilibrium; I saw him reel drunkenly for an instant upon the brink of eternity and then, with a loud scream, slip into the sea. At the same instant a pair of giant arms encircled me from behind and lifted me entirely off my feet.  Kick and squirm as I would, I could neither turn toward my antagonist nor free myself from his maniacal grasp.  Relentlessly he was rushing me toward the side of the vessel and death.  There was none to stay him, for each of my companions was more than occupied by from one to three of the enemy.  For an instant I was fearful for myself, and then I saw that which filled me with a far greater terror for another.  My boche was bearing me toward the side of the submarine against which the tug was still pounding.  That I should be ground to death between the two was lost upon me as I saw the girl standing alone upon the tug's deck, as I saw the stern high in air and the bow rapidly settling for the final dive, as I saw death from which I could not save her clutching at the skirts of the woman I now knew all too well that I loved.  I had perhaps the fraction of a second longer to live when I heard an angry growl behind us mingle with a cry of pain and rage from the giant who carried me.  Instantly he went backward to the deck, and as he did so he threw his arms outwards to save himself, freeing me.  I fell heavily upon him, but was upon my feet in the instant.  As I arose, I cast a single glance at my opponent. Never again would he menace me or another, for Nob's great jaws had closed upon his throat.  Then I sprang toward the edge of the deck closest to the girl upon the sinking tug.  \"Jump!\" I cried.  \"Jump!\"  And I held out my arms to her. Instantly as though with implicit confidence in my ability to save her, she leaped over the side of the tug onto the sloping, slippery side of the U-boat. I reached far over to seize her hand.  At the same instant the tug pointed its stern straight toward the sky and plunged out of sight.  My hand missed the girl's by a fraction of an inch, and I saw her slip into the sea; but scarce had she touched the water when I was in after her.  The sinking tug drew us far below the surface; but I had seized her the moment I struck the water, and so we went down together, and together we came up--a few yards from the U-boat.  The first thing I heard was Nobs barking furiously; evidently he had missed me and was searching. A single glance at the vessel's deck assured me that the battle was over and"]]]
