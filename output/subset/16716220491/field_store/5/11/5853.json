Use the knife instead. Always roll from you rather than to you, and press lightly on the rolling-pin, except at the last.  It is difficult to make puff-paste in the summer, unless in a cellar, or very cool room, and on a marble table. The butter should, if possible, be washed the night before, and kept covered with ice till you use it next day. The water should have ice in it, and the butter should be iced as it sets on the paste-board. After the paste is mixed, it should be put in a covered dish, and set in cold water till you are ready to give it the last rolling.  With all these precautions to prevent its being heavy, it will not rise as well, or be in any respect as good as in cold weather.  The handsomest way of ornamenting the edge of a pie or pudding is to cut the rim in large square notches, and then fold over triangularly one corner of every notch.   COMMON PASTE FOR PIES.    A pound and a half of sifted flour.   Three quarters of a pound of butter--washed.  _This will make one large pie or two small ones_.  Sift the flour into a pan. Cut the butter into two equal parts. Cut one half of the butter into the flour, and cut it up as small as possible. Mix it well with the flour, wetting it gradually with a little cold water.  Spread some flour on your paste-board, take the lump of paste out of the pan, flour your rolling-pin, and roll out the paste into a large sheet. Then stick it over with the remaining half of the butter in small pieces, and laid at equal distances. Throw on a little flour, fold up the sheet of paste, flour it slightly, and roll it out again. Then fold it up, and cut it in half or in four, according to the size of your pies. Roll it out into round sheets the size of your pie-plates, pressing rather harder on the rolling-pin.  Butter your pie-plates, lay on your under crust, and trim the edge. Fill the dish with the ingredients of which the pie is composed, and lay on the lid, in which you must prick some holes, or cut a small slit in the top. Crimp the edges with a sharp knife.  Heap up the ingredients so that the pie will be highest in the middle.  Some think it makes common paste more crisp and light, to beat it hard on both sides with the rolling-pin, after you give it the first rolling, when all the butter is in.  If the butter is very fresh, you may mix with the flour a salt-spoonful of salt.   MINCE PIES    One pound and a half of boiled beef's heart, or fresh      tongue--chopped when cold.   Two pounds of beef suet, chopped fine.   Four pounds of pippin apples, chopped.   Two pounds of raisins, stoned and chopped.   Two pounds of currants, picked, washed, and dried.   Two pounds of powdered sugar.   One quart of white wine.   One quart of brandy.   One wine-glass of rose-water.   Two grated nutmegs.   Half an ounce of powdered cinnamon   A quarter of an ounce of powdered cloves   A quarter of an ounce of powdered mace   A teaspoon of salt.   Two large oranges.   Half a pound of citron, cut in slips.  Parboil a beef's heart, or a fresh tongue. After you have taken off the skin and fat, weigh a pound and a half. When it is cold, chop it very fine. Take the inside of the suet; weigh two pounds, and chop it as fine as possible. Mix the meat and suet together, adding the salt. Pare, core, and chop the apples, and then stone and chop the raisins. Having prepared the currants, add them to the other fruit, and mix the fruit with the meat and suet. Put in the sugar and spice, and the grated peel and juice of the oranges. Wet the whole with the rose water and liquor, and mix all well together.  Make the paste, allowing for each pie, half a pound of butter and three quarters of a pound of sifted flour. Make it in the same manner as puff-paste, but it will not be quite so rich. Lay a sheet of paste all over a soup-plate. Fill it with mince-meat, laying slips of citron on the top. Roll out a sheet of paste, for the lid of the pie. Put it on, and crimp the edges with a knife. Prick holes in the lid.  Bake the pies half an hour in a brisk oven.  Keep your mince meat in a jar tightly covered. Set it in a dry, cool place, and occasionally add more brandy to it.  Instead of the heart or tongue, you may, if you choose, use part of a round of fresh beef.   PLUM PUDDING    One pound of raisins, stoned and cut in half.   One pound of currants, picked, washed and dried.   One pound of beef suet chopped fine.   One pound of grated stale bread, or, half a pound of flour and     half a pound of bread.   Eight eggs.   A quarter of a pound of sugar.   A glass of brandy.   A pint of milk.   A glass of wine.   Two nutmegs, grated.   A table-spoonful of mixed cinnamon and mace.   A salt-spoonful of salt.  You must prepare all your ingredients the day before (except beating the eggs) that in the morning you may have nothing to do but to mix them, as the pudding will require six hours to boil.  Beat the eggs very light, then put to them half the milk and beat both together. Stir in gradually the flour and grated bread. Next add the sugar by degrees. Then the suet and fruit alternately. The fruit must be well sprinkled with flour, lest it sink to the bottom. Stir very hard. Then add the spice and liquor, and lastly the remainder of the milk. Stir the whole mixture very well together. If it is not thick enough, add a little more grated bread or flour. If there is too much bread or flour, the pudding will be hard and heavy.  Dip your pudding-cloth, in boiling water, shake it out and sprinkle it slightly with flour. Lay it in a pan and pour the mixture into the cloth. Tie it up carefully, allowing room for the pudding to swell.  Boil it six hours, and turn it carefully out of the cloth.  Before you send it to table, have ready some blanched sweet almonds cut in slips, or some slips of citron, or both. Stick them all over the outside of the pudding.  Eat it with wine, or with a sauce made of drawn butter, wine and nutmeg.  The pudding will be improved if you add to the other ingredients, the grated rind of a large lemon or orange.   LEMON PUDDING    One small lemon, with a smooth thin rind.   Three eggs.   A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.   A quarter of a pound of fresh butter--washed.   A table-spoonful of white wine and brandy, mixed.   A tea-spoonful of rose-water.    Five ounces of sifted flour, and a quarter of a pound of     fresh butter for the paste.  Grate the yellow part of the rind of a small lemon. Then cut the lemon in half, and squeeze the juice into the plate that contains the grated rind, carefully taking out all the seeds. Mix the juice and rind together.  Put a quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar into a deep earthen pan, and cut up in it a quarter of a pound of the best fresh butter. If the weather is very cold, set the pan near the fire, for a few minutes, to soften the butter, but do not allow it to melt or it will be heavy. Stir the butter and sugar together, with a stick or wooden spoon, till it is perfectly light and of the consistence of cream.  Put the eggs in a shallow broad pan, and beat them with an egg-beater or rods, till they are quite smooth, and as thick as a boiled custard. Then stir the eggs, gradually, into the pan of butter and sugar. Add the liquor and rose water by degrees, and then stir in, gradually, the juice and grated rind of the lemon. Stir the whole very hard, after all the ingredients are in.  Have ready a puff-paste made of five ounces of sifted flour, and a quarter of a pound of fresh butter. The paste must be made with as little water as possible. Roll it out in a circular sheet, thin in the centre, and thicker towards the edges, and just large enough to cover the bottom, sides, and edges of a soup-plate. Butter the soup-plate very well, and lay the paste in it, making it neat and even round the broad edge of the plate. With a sharp knife, trim off the superfluous dough, and notch the edges. Put in the mixture with a spoon, and bake the pudding about half an hour, in a moderate oven. It should be baked of a very light brown. If the oven is too hot, the paste will not have time to rise well. If too cold, it will be clammy. When the pudding is cool, grate loaf-sugar over it.  Before using lemons for any purpose, always roll them awhile with your hand on a table. This will cause them to yield a larger quantity of juice.   ORANGE PUDDING.    One large orange, of a deep colour, and smooth thin rind.   One lime.   A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.   A quarter of a pound of fresh butter.   Three eggs.   A table-spoonful of mixed wine and brandy.   A tea-spoonful of rose-water.  Grate the yellow rind of the orange and lime, and squeeze the juice into a saucer or soup-plate, taking out all the seeds.  Stir the butter and sugar to a cream.  Beat the eggs as light as possible, and then stir them by degrees into the pan of butter and sugar. Add, gradually, the liquor and rose-water, and then by degrees, the orange and lime. Stir all well together.  Have ready a sheet of puff-paste made of five ounces of sifted flour, and a quarter of a pound of fresh butter. Lay the paste in a buttered soup-plate. Trim and notch the edges, and then put in the mixture. Bake it about half an hour, in a moderate oven. Grate loaf-sugar over it, before you send it to table.   COCOA-NUT PUDDING    A quarter of a pound of cocoa-nut, grated.   A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.   Three ounces and a half of fresh butter.   The whites only of six eggs.   A table-spoonful of wine and brandy mixed.   Half a tea-spoonful of rose-water.  Break up a cocoa-nut, and take the thin brown skin carefully off, with a knife. Wash all the pieces in cold water, and then wipe them dry, with a clean towel. Weigh a quarter of a pound of cocoa-nut, and grate it very fine, into a soup-plate.  Stir the butter and sugar to a cream, and add the liquor and rose-water gradually to them.  Beat the whites only, of six eggs, till"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6677"],["title","Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes and Sweetmeats, (#2)"],["body"," stand alone on the rods; and then stir the beaten white of egg, gradually, into the butter and sugar. Afterwards, sprinkle in, by degrees, the grated cocoa-nut, stirring hard all the time. Then stir all very well at the last.  Have ready a puff-paste, sufficient to cover the bottom, sides, and edges of a soup-plate. Put in the mixture, and bake it in a moderate oven, about half an hour.  Grate loaf-sugar over it, when cool.   ALMOND PUDDING.    Half a pound of sweet almonds, which will be reduced to a quarter     of a pound, when shelled and blanched.   An ounce of blanched bitter almonds or peach-kernels.   The whites only, of six eggs.   A quarter of a pound of butter.   A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.   A table-spoonful of mixed brandy, wine, and rose-water.  Shell half a pound of sweet almonds, and pour scalding water over them, which will make the skins peal off. As they get cool, pour more boiling water, till the almonds are all blanched. Blanch also the bitter almonds. As you blanch the almonds, throw them into a bowl of cold water. Then take them out, one by one, wipe them dry in a clean towel, and lay them on a plate. Pound them one at a time to a fine paste, in a marble mortar, adding, as you pound them, a few drops of rose-water to prevent their oiling. Pound the bitter and sweet almonds alternately, that they may be well mixed. They must be made perfectly fine and smooth, and are the better for being prepared the day before they are wanted for the pudding.  Stir the butter and sugar to a cream, and add to it, gradually, the liquor.  Beat the whites of six eggs till they stand alone. Stir the almonds and white of eggs, alternately, into the butter and sugar; and then stir the whole well together.  Have ready a puff-paste sufficient for a soup-plate. Butter the plate, lay on the paste, trim and notch it. Then put in the mixture.  Bake it about half an hour in a moderate oven.  Grate loaf-sugar over it.   A CHEESECAKE.    Four eggs.   A gill of milk.   A quarter of a pound of butter.   A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.   Two ounces of grated bread.   A table-spoonful of mixed brandy and wine.   A tea-spoonful of rose-water.   A tea-spoonful of mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg, mixed.   A quarter of a pound of currants.  Pick the currants very clean. Wash them through a colander, wipe them in a towel, and then dry them on a dish before the fire.  When dry take out a few to scatter over the top of the cheesecake, lay them aside, and sprinkle the remainder of the currants with the flour.  Stir the butter and sugar to a cream. Grate the bread, and prepare the spice. Beat the eggs very light.  Boil the milk. When it comes to a boil, add to it half the beaten egg, and boil both together till it becomes a curd, stirring it frequently with a knife. Then throw the grated bread on the curd, and stir all together. Then take the milk, egg, and bread off the fire and stir it, gradually, into the butter and sugar. Next, stir in the remaining half of the egg.  Add, by degrees, the liquor and spice.  Lastly, stir in, gradually, the currants.  Have ready a puff-paste, which should be made before you prepare the cheesecake, as the mixture will become heavy by standing. Before you put it into the oven, scatter the remainder of the currants over the top.  Bake it half an hour in rather a quick oven.  Do not sugar the top.  You may bake it either in a soup-plate, or in two small tin patty-pans, which, for cheesecakes, should be of a square shape. If baked in square patty-pans, leave at each side a flap of paste in the shape of a half-circle. Cut long slits in these flaps and turn them over, so that they will rest on the top of the mixture.  You can, if you choose, add to the currants a few raisins stoned, and cut in half.   SWEET POTATO PUDDING.    A quarter of a pound of boiled sweet potato.   Three eggs.   A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.   A quarter of a pound of fresh butter.   A glass of mixed wine and brandy.   A half-glass of rose-water.   A tea-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.  Pound the spice, allowing a smaller proportion of mace than of nutmeg and cinnamon.  Boil and peal some sweet potatoes, and when they are cold, weigh a quarter of a pound. Mash the sweet potato very smooth, and rub it through a sieve. Stir the sugar and butter to a cream.  Beat the eggs very light, and stir them into the butter and sugar, alternately with the sweet potato. Add by degrees the liquor, rose-water and spice. Stir all very hard together.  Spread puff-paste on a soup-plate. Put in the mixture, and bake it about half an hour in a moderate oven.  Grate sugar over it.   PUMPKIN PUDDING.    Half a pound of stewed pumpkin.   Three eggs.   A quarter of a pound of fresh butter, or a pint of cream.   A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.   Half a glass of wine and brandy mixed.   Half a glass of rose-water.   A tea-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.  Stew some pumpkin with as little water as possible. Drain it in a colander, and press it till dry. When cold, weigh half a pound, and pass it through a sieve. Prepare the spice. Stir together the sugar, and butter, to cream, till they are perfectly light. Add to them, gradually, the spice and liquor.  Beat three eggs very light, and stir them into the butter and sugar alternately with the pumpkin.  Cover a soup-plate with puff-paste, and put in the mixture. Bake it in a moderate oven about half an hour.  Grate sugar over it when cool.  Instead of the butter, you may boil a pint of milk or cream, and when cold, stir into it in turn the sugar, eggs, and pumpkin.   GOOSEBERRY PUDDING.    A pint of stewed gooseberries, with all their juice.   A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.   Two ounces of fresh butter.   Two ounces of grated bread.   Three eggs.  Stew the gooseberries till quite soft. When they are cold, mash them fine with the back of a spoon, and stir into them two ounces of sugar. Take two ounces more of sugar, and stir it to a cream with two ounces of butter.  Grate very fine as much stale bread as will weigh two ounces.  Beat three eggs, and stir them into the butter and sugar, in turn with the gooseberries and bread.  Lay puff-paste in a soup plate. Put in the mixture, and bake it half an hour.  Do not grate sugar over it.   BAKED APPLE PUDDING.    A pint of stewed apples.   Half a pint of cream, or two ounces of butter.   A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.   A nutmeg grated.   A table-spoonful of rose-water.   A tea-spoonful of grated lemon-peel.  Stew your apple in as little water as possible, and not long enough for the pieces to break and lose their shape. Put them in a colander to drain, and mash them with the back of a spoon. If stewed too long, and in too much water, they will lose their flavour. When cold, mix with them the nutmeg, rose-water, and lemon-peel, and two ounces of sugar. Stir the other two ounces of sugar, with the butter or cream, and then mix it gradually with the apple.  Bake, it in puff-paste, in a soup-dish, about half an hour in a moderate oven.  Do not sugar the top.   FRUIT PIES.  Fruit pies for family use, are generally made with common paste, allowing three quarters of a pound of butter to a pound and a half of flour.  Peaches and plums for pies, should be cut in half, and the stones taken out. Cherries also should be stoned, and red cherries only should be used for pies.  Apples should be cut into very thin slices, and are much improved by a little lemon peel. Sweet apples are not good for pies, as they are very insipid when baked, and seldom get thoroughly done. If green apples are used, they should first be stewed in as little water as possible; and made very sweet.  Apples, stewed previous to baking, should not be done till they break, but only till they are tender. They should then be drained in a colander, and chopped fine with a knife or the edge of a spoon.  In making pies of juicy fruit, it is a good way to set a small tea-cup on the bottom crust, and lay the fruit all round it. The juice will collect under the cup, and not run out at the edges or top of the pie. The fruit should be mixed with a sufficient quantity of sugar, and piled up in the middle, so as to make the pie highest in the centre. The upper crust should be pricked with a fork, or have a slit cut in the middle. The edges should be nicely crimped with a knife.  Dried peaches, dried apples, and cranberries should be stewed with a very little water, and allowed to get quite cold before they are put into the pie. If stewed fruit is put in warm, it will make the paste heavy.  If your pies are made in the form of shells, or without lids, the fruit should always be stewed first, or it will not be sufficiently done, as the shells (which should be of puff paste) must not bake so long as covered pies.  Shells intended for sweetmeats, must be baked empty, and the fruit put into them before they go to table.  Fruit pies with lids, should have loaf-sugar grated over them. If they have been baked the day before, they should be warmed in the stove, or near the fire, before they are sent to table, to soften the crust, and make them taste fresh.  Raspberry and apple-pies are much improved by taking off the lid, and pouring in a little cream just before they go to table. Replace the lid very carefully.   OYSTER PIE.    A hundred large fresh oysters, or more if small.   The yolks of six eggs boiled hard.   A large slice of stale-bread, grated.   A tea-spoonful of salt.   A table-spoonful of pepper.   A table-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.  Take a large round dish, butter it and spread a rich paste over the sides, and round the edge, but not at the bottom.  Salt oysters will not do for pies. They should be fresh, and as large and fine as possible.  Drain off part of the liquor from the oysters. Put them into a pan, and season them with pepper, salt and spice. Stir them well with the seasoning. Have "]]]
