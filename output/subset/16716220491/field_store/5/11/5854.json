The accumulated chivalry of generations of chivalrous ancestors acted like a spur on his lordship. He understood but dimly, yet enough to enable him to realize that a scene was about to take place in which he was most emphatically not 'on'. A mother's meeting with her long-lost child, this is a sacred thing. This was quite clear to him, so, turning like a flash, he bounded through the doorway, and, as somebody happened to be coming in at the same time, there was a collision, which left him breathing apologies in his familiar attitude of stooping to pick up his hat.  The new-comers were a tall, strikingly handsome girl, with a rather hard and cynical cast of countenance. She was leading by the hand a small, fat boy of about fourteen years of age, whose likeness to the portrait on the chair proclaimed his identity. He had escaped the collision, but seemed offended by it; for, eyeing the bending peer with cold distaste, he summed up his opinion of him in the one word 'Chump!'  Lord Mountry rose.  'I beg your pardon,' he said for perhaps the seventh time. He was thoroughly unstrung. Always excessively shy, he was embarrassed now by quite a variety of causes. The world was full of eyes--Mrs Ford's saying 'Go!' Ogden's saying 'Fool!' the portrait saying 'Idiot!' and, finally, the eyes of this wonderfully handsome girl, large, grey, cool, amused, and contemptuous saying--so it seemed to him in that feverish moment--'Who is this curious pink person who cumbers the ground before me?'  'I--I beg your pardon.' he repeated.  'Ought to look where you're going,' said Ogden severely.  'Not at all,' said the girl. 'Won't you introduce me, Nesta?'  'Lord Mountry--Miss Drassilis,' said Mrs Ford.  'I'm afraid we're driving Lord Mountry away,' said the girl. Her eyes seemed to his lordship larger, greyer, cooler, more amused, and more contemptuous than ever. He floundered in them like an unskilful swimmer in deep waters.  'No, no,' he stammered. 'Give you my word. Just going. Good-bye. You won't forget to let me know about the yacht, Mrs Ford--what? It'll be an awfully jolly party. Good-bye, good-bye, Miss Drassilis.'  He looked at Ogden for an instant, as if undecided whether to take the liberty of addressing him too, and then, his heart apparently failing him, turned and bolted. From down the corridor came the clatter of a dropped stick.  Cynthia Drassilis closed the door and smiled.  'A nervous young person!' she said. 'What was he saying about a yacht, Nesta?'  Mrs Ford roused herself from her fascinated contemplation of Ogden.  'Oh, nothing. Some of us are going to the south of France in his yacht next week.'  'What a delightful idea!'  There was a certain pensive note in Cynthia's voice.  'A splendid idea!' she murmured.  Mrs Ford swooped. She descended on Ogden in a swirl and rustle of expensive millinery, and clasped him to her.  'My boy!'  It is not given to everybody to glide neatly into a scene of tense emotion. Ogden failed to do so. He wriggled roughly from the embrace.  'Got a cigarette?' he said.  He was an extraordinarily unpleasant little boy. Physically the portrait standing on the chair did him more than justice. Painted by a mother's loving hand, it flattered him. It was bulgy. He was more bulgy. It was sullen. He scowled. And, art having its limitations, particularly amateur art, the portrait gave no hint of his very repellent manner. He was an intensely sophisticated child. He had the air of one who has seen all life has to offer, and is now permanently bored. His speech and bearing were those of a young man, and a distinctly unlovable young man.  Even Mrs Ford was momentarily chilled. She laughed shakily.  'How very matter-of-fact you are, darling!' she said.  Cynthia was regarding the heir to the Ford millions with her usual steady, half-contemptuous gaze.  'He has been that all day,' she said. 'You have no notion what a help it was to me.'  Mrs Ford turned to her effusively.  'Oh, Cynthia, dear, I haven't thanked you.'  'No,' interpolated the girl dryly.  'You're a wonder, darling. You really are. I've been repeating that ever since I got your telegram from Eastnor.' She broke off. 'Ogden, come near me, my little son.'  He lurched towards her sullenly.  'Don't muss a fellow now,' he stipulated, before allowing himself to be enfolded in the outstretched arms.  'Tell me, Cynthia,' resumed Mrs Ford, 'how did you do it? I was telling Lord Mountry that I _hoped_ I might see my Ogden again soon, but I never really hoped. It seemed too impossible that you should succeed.'  'This Lord Mountry of yours,' said Cynthia. 'How did you get to know him? Why have I not seen him before?'  'I met him in Paris in the fall. He has been out of London for a long time, looking after his father, who was ill.'  'I see.'  'He has been most kind, making arrangements about getting Ogden's portrait painted. But, bother Lord Mountry. How did we get sidetracked on to him? Tell me how you got Ogden away.'  Cynthia yawned.  'It was extraordinarily easy, as it turned out, you see.'  'Ogden, darling,' observed Mrs Ford, 'don't go away. I want you near me.'  'Oh, all right.'  'Then stay by me, angel-face.'  'Oh, slush!' muttered angel-face beneath his breath. 'Say, I'm darned hungry,' he added.  It was if an electric shock had been applied to Mrs Ford. She sprang to her feet.  'My poor child! Of course you must have some lunch. Ring the bell, Cynthia. I'll have them send up some here.'  'I'll have _mine_ here,' said Cynthia.  'Oh, you've had no lunch either! I was forgetting that.'  'I thought you were.'  'You must both lunch here.'  'Really,' said Cynthia, 'I think it would be better if Ogden had his downstairs in the restaurant.'  'Want to talk scandal, eh?'  'Ogden, _dearest!_' said Mrs Ford. 'Very well, Cynthia. Go, Ogden. You will order yourself something substantial, marvel-child?'  'Bet your life,' said the son and heir tersely.  There was a brief silence as the door closed. Cynthia gazed at her friend with a peculiar expression.  'Well, I did it, dear,' she said.  'Yes. It's splendid. You're a wonder, darling.'  'Yes,' said Cynthia.  There was another silence.  'By the way,' said Mrs Ford, 'didn't you say there was a little thing, a small bill, that was worrying you?'  'Did I mention it? Yes, there is. It's rather pressing. In fact, it's taking up most of the horizon at present. Here it is.'  'Is it a large sum?' Mrs Ford took the slip of paper and gave a slight gasp. Then, coming to the bureau, she took out her cheque-book.  'It's very kind of you, Nesta,' said Cynthia. 'They were beginning to show quite a vindictive spirit about it.'  She folded the cheque calmly and put it in her purse.  'And now tell me how you did it,' said Mrs Ford.  She dropped into a chair and leaned back, her hands behind her head. For the first time, she seemed to enjoy perfect peace of mind. Her eyes half closed, as if she had been making ready to listen to some favourite music.  'Tell me from the very beginning,' she said softly.  Cynthia checked a yawn.  'Very well, dear,' she said. 'I caught the 10.20 to Eastnor, which isn't a bad train, if you ever want to go down there. I arrived at a quarter past twelve, and went straight up to the house--you've never seen the house, of course? It's quite charming--and told the butler that I wanted to see Mr Ford on business. I had taken the precaution to find out that he was not there. He is at Droitwich.'  'Rheumatism,' murmured Mrs Ford. 'He has it sometimes.'  'The man told me he was away, and then he seemed to think that I ought to go. I stuck like a limpet. I sent him to fetch Ogden's tutor. His name is Broster--Reggie Broster. He is a very nice young man. Big, broad shoulders, and such a kind face.'  'Yes, dear, yes?'  'I told him I was doing a series of drawings for a magazine of the interiors of well-known country houses.'  'He believed you?'  'He believed everything. He's that kind of man. He believed me when I told him that my editor particularly wanted me to sketch the staircase. They had told me about the staircase at the inn. I forget what it is exactly, but it's something rather special in staircases.'  'So you got in?'  'So I got in.'  'And saw Ogden?'  'Only for a moment--then Reggie--'  'Who?'  'Mr Broster. I always think of him as Reggie. He's one of Nature's Reggies. _Such_ a kind, honest face. Well, as I was saying, Reggie discovered that it was time for lessons, and sent Ogden upstairs.'  'By himself?'  'By himself! Reggie and I chatted for a while.'  Mrs Ford's eyes opened, brown and bright and hard.  'Mr Broster is not a proper tutor for my boy,' she said coldly.  'I suppose it was wrong of Reggie,' said Cynthia. 'But--I was wearing this hat.'  'Go on.'  'Well, after a time, I said I must be starting my work. He wanted me to start with the room we were in. I said no, I was going out into the grounds to sketch the house from the EAST. I chose the EAST because it happens to be nearest the railway station. I added that I supposed he sometimes took Ogden for a little walk in the grounds. He said yes, he did, and it was just about due. He said possibly he might come round my way. He said Ogden would be interested in my sketch. He seemed to think a lot of Ogden's fondness for art.'  'Mr Broster is _not_ a proper tutor for my boy.'  'Well, he isn't your boy's tutor now, is he, dear?'  'What happened then?'  'I strolled off with my sketching things. After a while Reggie and Ogden came up. I said I hadn't been able to work because I had been frightened by a bull.'  'Did he believe _that_?'  '_Certainly_ he believed it. He was most kind and sympathetic. We had a nice chat. He told me all about himself. He used to be very good at football. He doesn't play now, but he often thinks of the past.'  'But he must have seen that you couldn't sketch. Then what became of your magazine commission story?'  'Well,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6683"],["title","The Little Nugget (#2)"],["body","the sketch seemed to get shelved. I didn't even have to start it. We were having our chat, you see. Reggie was telling me how good he had been at football when he was at Oxford, and he wanted me to see a newspaper clipping of a Varsity match he had played in. I said I'd love to see it. He said it was in his suit-case in the house. So I promised to look after Ogden while he fetched it. I sent him off to get it just in time for us to catch the train. Off he went, and here we are. And now, won't you order that lunch you mentioned? I'm starving.'  Mrs Ford rose. Half-way to the telephone she stopped suddenly.  'My dear child! It has only just struck me! We must leave here at once. He will have followed you. He will guess that Ogden has been kidnapped.'  Cynthia smiled.  'Believe me, it takes Reggie quite a long time to guess anything. Besides, there are no trains for hours. We are quite safe.'  'Are you sure?'  'Absolutely. I made certain of that before I left.'  Mrs Ford kissed her impulsively.  'Oh, Cynthia, you really are wonderful!'  She started back with a cry as the bell rang sharply.  'For goodness' sake, Nesta,' said Cynthia, with irritation, 'do keep control of yourself. There's nothing to be frightened about. I tell you Mr Broster can't possibly have got here in the time, even if he knew where to go to, which I don't see how he could. It's probably Ogden.'  The colour came back into Mrs Ford's cheeks.  'Why, of course.'  Cynthia opened the door.  'Come in, darling,' said Mrs Ford fondly. And a wiry little man with grey hair and spectacles entered.  'Good afternoon, Mrs Ford,' he said. 'I have come to take Ogden back.'     II   There are some situations in life so unexpected, so trying, that, as far as concerns our opinion of those subjected to them, we agree, as it were, not to count them; we refuse to allow the victim's behaviour in circumstances so exacting to weigh with us in our estimate of his or her character. We permit the great general, confronted suddenly with a mad bull, to turn and run, without forfeiting his reputation for courage. The bishop who, stepping on a concealed slide in winter, entertains passers-by with momentary rag-time steps, loses none of his dignity once the performance is concluded.  In the same way we must condone the behaviour of Cynthia Drassilis on opening the door of Mrs Ford's sitting-room and admitting, not Ogden, but this total stranger, who accompanied his entry with the remarkable speech recorded at the close of the last section.  She was a girl who prided herself on her carefully blase' and supercilious attitude towards life; but this changeling was too much for her. She released the handle, tottered back, and, having uttered a discordant squeak of amazement, stood staring, eyes and mouth wide open.  On Mrs Ford the apparition had a different effect. The rather foolish smile of welcome vanished from her face as if wiped away with a sponge. Her eyes, fixed and frightened like those of a trapped animal, glared at the intruder. She took a step forward, choking.  'What--what do you mean by daring to enter my room?' she cried.  The man held his ground, unmoved. His bearing was a curious blend of diffidence and aggressiveness. He was determined, but apologetic. A hired assassin of the Middle Ages, resolved to do his job loyally, yet conscious of causing inconvenience to his victim, might have looked the same.  'I am sorry,' he said, 'but I must ask you to let me have the boy, Mrs Ford.'  Cynthia was herself again now. She raked the intruder with the cool stare which had so disconcerted Lord Mountry.  'Who is this gentleman?' she asked languidly.  The intruder was made of tougher stuff than his lordship. He met her eye with quiet firmness.  'My name is Mennick,' he said. 'I am Mr Elmer Ford's private secretary.'  'What do you want?' said Mrs Ford.  'I have already explained what I want, Mrs Ford. I want Ogden.'  Cynthia raised her eyebrows.  'What _does_ he mean, Nesta? Ogden is not here.'  Mr Mennick produced from his breast-pocket a telegraph form, and in his quiet, business-like way proceeded to straighten it out.  'I have here,' he said, 'a telegram from Mr Broster, Ogden's tutor. It was one of the conditions of his engagement that if ever he was not certain of Ogden's whereabouts he should let me know at once. He tells me that early this afternoon he left Ogden in the company of a strange young lady'--Mr Mennick's spectacles flashed for a moment at Cynthia--'and that, when he returned, both of them had disappeared. He made inquiries and discovered that this young lady caught the 1.15 express to London, Ogden with her. On receipt of this information I at once wired to Mr Ford for instructions. I have his reply'--he fished for and produced a second telegram--'here.'  'I still fail to see what brings you here,' said Mrs Ford. 'Owing to the gross carelessness of his father's employees, my son appears to have been kidnapped. That is no reason--'  'I will read Mr Ford's telegram,' proceeded Mr Mennick unmoved. 'It is rather long. I think Mr Ford is somewhat annoyed. \"The boy has obviously been stolen by some hireling of his mother's.\" I am reading Mr Ford's actual words,' he said, addressing Cynthia with that touch of diffidence which had marked his manner since his entrance.  'Don't apologize,' said Cynthia, with a short laugh. 'You're not responsible for Mr Ford's rudeness.'  Mr Mennick bowed.  'He continued: \"Remove him from her illegal restraint. If necessary call in police and employ force.\"'  'Charming!' said Mrs Ford.  'Practical,' said Mr Mennick. 'There is more. \"Before doing anything else sack that fool of a tutor, then go to Agency and have them recommend good private school for boy. On no account engage another tutor. They make me tired. Fix all this today. Send Ogden back to Eastnor with Mrs Sheridan. She will stay there with him till further notice.\" That is Mr Ford's message.'  Mr Mennick folded both documents carefully and replaced them in his pocket.  Mrs Ford looked at the clock.  'And now, would you mind going, Mr Mennick?'  'I am sorry to appear discourteous, Mrs Ford, but I cannot go without Ogden.'  'I shall telephone to the office to send up a porter to remove you.'  'I shall take advantage of his presence to ask him to fetch a policeman.'  In the excitement of combat the veneer of apologetic diffidence was beginning to wear off Mr Mennick. He spoke irritably. Cynthia appealed to his reason with the air of a bored princess descending to argument with a groom.  'Can't you see for yourself that he's not here?' she said. 'Do you think we are hiding him?'  'Perhaps you would like to search my bedroom?' said Mrs Ford, flinging the door open.  Mr Mennick remained uncrushed.  'Quite unnecessary, Mrs Ford. I take it, from the fact that he does not appear to be in this suite, that he is downstairs making a late luncheon in the restaurant.'  'I shall telephone--'  'And tell them to send him up. Believe me, Mrs Ford, it is the only thing to do. You have my deepest sympathy, but I am employed by Mr Ford and must act solely in his interests. The law is on my side. I am here to fetch Ogden away, and I am going to have him.'  'You shan't!'  'I may add that, when I came up here, I left Mrs Sheridan--she is a fellow-secretary of mine. You may remember Mr Ford mentioning her in his telegram--I left her to search the restaurant and grill-room, with instructions to bring Ogden, if found, to me in this room.'  The door-bell rang. He went to the door and opened it.  'Come in, Mrs Sheridan. Ah!'  A girl in a plain, neat blue dress entered the room. She was a small, graceful girl of about twenty-five, pretty and brisk, with the air of one accustomed to look after herself in a difficult world. Her eyes were clear and steady, her mouth sensitive but firm, her chin the chin of one who has met trouble and faced it bravely. A little soldier.  She was shepherding Ogden before her, a gorged but still sullen Ogden. He sighted Mr Mennick and stopped.  'Hello!' he said. 'What have you blown in for?'  'He was just in the middle of his lunch,' said the girl. 'I thought you wouldn't mind if I let him finish.'  'Say, what's it all about, anyway?' demanded Ogden crossly. 'Can't a fellow have a bit of grub in peace? You give me a pain.'  Mr Mennick explained.  'Your father wishes you to return to Eastnor, Ogden.'  'Oh, all right. I guess I'd better go, then. Good-bye, ma.'  Mrs Ford choked.  'Kiss me, Ogden.'  Ogden submitted to the embrace in sulky silence. The others comported themselves each after his or her own fashion. Mr Mennick fingered his chin uncomfortably. Cynthia turned to the table and picked up an illustrated paper. Mrs Sheridan's eyes filled with tears. She took a half-step towards Mrs Ford, as if about to speak, then drew back.  'Come, Ogden,' said Mr Mennick gruffly. Necessary, this Hired Assassin work, but painful--devilish painful. He breathed a sigh of relief as he passed into the corridor with his prize.  At the door Mrs Sheridan hesitated, stopped, and turned.  'I'm sorry,' she said impulsively.  Mrs Ford turned away without speaking, and went into the bedroom.  Cynthia laid down her paper.  'One moment, Mrs Sheridan.'  The girl had turned to go. She stopped.  'Can you give me a minute? Come in and shut the door. Won't you sit down? Very well. You seemed sorry for Mrs Ford just now.'  'I am very sorry for Mrs Ford. Very sorry. I hate to see her suffering. I wish Mr Mennick had not brought me into this.'  'Nesta's mad about that boy,' said Cynthia. 'Heaven knows why. _I_ never saw such a repulsive child in my life. However, there it is. I am sorry for you. I gathered from what Mr Mennick said that you were to have a good deal of Ogden's society for some time to come. How do you feel about it?'  Mrs Sheridan moved towards the door.  'I must be going,' she said. 'Mr Mennick will be waiting for me.'  'One moment. Tell me, don't you think, after what you saw just"]]]
