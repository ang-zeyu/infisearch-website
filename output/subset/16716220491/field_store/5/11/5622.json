Don't you remember how Arnold Baxter escaped from the hospital authorities last year?\"  \"Those Baxters are as slick as you can make them,\" said Frank. \"I've been thinking if Dan would dare to show himself around Putnam Hall.\"  \"Not he!\" cried Larry.  \"He'll travel as far can and as fast as he can.\"  \"Perhaps not,\" mused Dick. \"I rather he will hang around and try to help his father out of prison.\"  \"That won't help him, for the authorities will be on strict guard now.  You know the stable door is always locked after the horse is stolen.\"  At this there was a general laugh, and when it ended a loud roll of a drum made the young cadets hurry to the front of the parade ground.  \"Fall in, Companies A and B!\" came the command from the major of the battalion, and the boys fell in.  Dick was now a first lieutenant, while Tom and Sam were first and second sergeants respectively.  As soon as the companies were formed they were marched around the Hall and to the messroom.  Here they were kept standing in a long fine while George Strong came to the front with half a dozen new pupils.  \"Young gentlemen, I will introduce to you several who will join your ranks for this season,\" said the head assistant.  Then he began to name the half dozen.  Among others they included a round-faced German youth named Hans Mueller, and a tall, lank, red-haired boy, of Irish descent who rejoiced in the name of Jim Caven.  \"I'll wager the Dutch boy is full of fun,\" whispered Sam to Tom. \"You can see it in his eyes.\"  \"I don't like the looks of that Jim Caven,\" returned Tom.  \"He looks like a worse sneak than Mumps ever was.\"  \"I agree there.  Perhaps we had better keep, our eyes open for him.\"  Despite this talk, however, the newcomers were welcomed cordially, and to the credit of the students be it said that each old cadet did all in his power to make the new boys feel perfectly at home.  \"Mine fadder vos von soldier py der Cherman army,\" said Hans Mueller.  \"Dot's vy he sent me py a military academy ven we come py dis country.\"  \"Glad to know you intend to help us fight the Indians,\" answered Tom innocently.  \"Me fight der Indians?  Vot you means py dot?\" demanded Hans, his light-blue eyes wide open with interest.  \"Why, don't you know that we are here to learn how to fight Indians?\" went on Tom, with a side wink at those around him.  \"No; I dink me dis vos von school only.\"  \"So it is--a school to learn how to shoot and scalp.\"  \"Schalp!  Vot's dot?\"  \"Cut an Indian's top-knot off with a knife, this way,\" and Tom made an imaginary slash at Hans' golden locks.  \"Ton't do dot!\" stammered the German boy, falling back.  \"No, I ton't vant to learn to schalp, noputty.\"  \"But you are willing to fight the Indians, are you not?\" put in Sam.  \"We are all going to do that, you know.\"  \"I ton't like dem Indians,\" sighed Hans.  \"I see me some of dem vonde by a show in Chermany, und I vos afraid.\"  At this a laugh went up.  How much further the joke would have been carried it is impossible to say, but just then a bell rang and the boys had to go into the classroom.  But Tom remembered about the Indians, as the others found out about a week later.  As the majority of the scholars had been to the Hall before, it did not take long for matters to become settled, and in a few days all of the boys felt thoroughly at home, that is, all but Jim Caven, who went around with that same sneaking look on his face that Tom had first noticed.  He made but few friends, and those only among the smaller boys who had plenty of pocket money to spend.  Caven rarely showed any money of his own.  With the coming of spring the cadets formed, as of old, several football teams, and played several notches, including one with their old rivals, the pupils of Pornell Academy.  This game they lost, by a score of four to five, which made the Pornellites feel much better, they having lost every game in the past. (For the doings of the Putnam Hall students previous to the arrival at that institution of the Rover boys see, \"The Putnam Hall Series,\" the first volume of which is entitled, \"The Putnam Hall Cadets.\"--Publisher)  \"Well, we can't expect to beat always,\" said Tom, who played quarterback on the Putnam team.  \"We gave them a close brush.\"  \"Yes, and we might have won if Larry hadn't slipped and sprained his ankle,\" put in Sam.  \"Well, never mind; better luck next time. We'll play them again next fall.\"  Sam was right so far as a game between the rival academies was concerned, but none of the Rover boys were on hand to take part in the contest--for reasons which the chapter to follow will disclose.  With the football came kite-flying, and wonderful indeed were some of the kites which the boys manufactured.  \"I can tell you, if a fellow had time he could reduce kite-flying to a regular science,\" said Dick.  \"Oh, Dick, don't give us any more science!\" cried Sam.  \"We get enough of science from, Uncle Randolph, with his scientific farming, fowl-raising, and the like.  I would just as lief fly an old-fashioned kite as anything.\"  \"Dick is right, though,\" put in Fred Garrison.  \"Now you have a big flat-kite there, three times larger than mine.  Yet I'll wager my little box kite will fly higher than your kite.\"  \"Done!\" cried Sam.  \"What shall the wager be?\"  \"Ice cream for the boys of our dormitory,\" answered Fred.  \"All right, but how is a fellow to get the cream if he loses?\"  \"That's for him to find out, Sam.  If I lose I'll sneak off to Cedarville, as Dick did once, and buy what I need.\"  \"Ice cream for our room it is,\" said. Frank.  \"And mum's the word about the wager, or Captain Putnam will spoil the whole affair if he gets wind of it.\"  \"Make me stakeholder,\" grinned Tom.  \"I'd just like to lay hands on about two quarts of chocolate cream.\"  \"There won't be any stakeholder,\" said Dick.  \"But when is this kite-flying contest to come off?\"  The matter was talked over, and it was decided to wait until the next Saturday, which would be, as usual, a half-holiday.  In the meantime some of the other boys heard there was going to be a contest, although they knew nothing of the wager made, and half a dozen other matches were arranged.  Saturday proved to be cool and clear with a stiff breeze blowing directly from the west.   This being so, it was decided, in order to get clear of the woods in front of the Hall, to hold the contests on Baker's Plain, a level patch of ground some distance to the westward.  The cadets were soon on the way, shouting and laughing merrily over the sport promised.  Only a few remained behind, including Jim Caven, who gave as his excuse that he had a headache.  \"I'm glad he is not with us,\" said Dick.  \"I declare, for some reason, I can't bear to have him around.\"  \"Nor I,\" returned Frank.  \"It's queer, but he gives me the shivers whenever he comes near me.\"  \"It's a wonder he came here at all.  He doesn't belong in our style of a crowd.\"  To reach Baker's Plain the cadets had to make a detour around a high cliff which overlooked a rocky watercourse which flowed into Cayuga Lake.  They moved slowly, as nobody wished to damage his kite, and it was after two o'clock before all hands were ready for the first trial at kite-flying.  \"Gracious, but it is blowing!\" cried Tom.  \"Sam, have you a good strong cord on your kite?\"  \"The strongest I could get,\" answered the youngest Rover.  \"I guess it is stronger than what Fred has.\"  \"My kite won't pull like yours,\" said Fred Garrison.  \"All ready?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then up they go--and may the best kite win!\"  Soon a dozen kites of various kinds were soaring in the air, some quite steadily and others darting angrily from side to side.  One went up with a swoop, to come down with a bang on the rocks, thus knocking itself into a hundred pieces.  \"Mine cracious, look at dot!\" burst out Hans Mueller.  \"Mine Gretchen kite vos busted up--und I spent me feefteen cents on him alreety!\" and a roar went up.  \"Never mind, Hans,\" said Dick. \"You can help sail the Katydid. She will pull strong enough for two, I am sure.\"  The Katydid was a wonderful affair of silver and gold which Dick had constructed on ideas entirely his own.  It went up slowly but surely and proved to be as good a kite as the majority.  A number of girls living in the neighborhood, bad heard of the kite-flying contests, and now they came up, Dora Stanhope with the rest, accompanied by her two cousins, Grace and Nellie Laning.  As my old readers may guess, Dick was very attentive to Dora, and his brothers were scarcely less so to the two Laning sisters.  \"And how is your mother?\" Dick asked of Dora, during the course of their conversation.  \"She is much better,\" replied Dora, \"although she is still weak from her sickness.\"  \"Does she ever mention Josiah Crabtree?\"  \"She mentioned him once.  She said that she had dreamed of him and of you, Nick.\"  \"Me?  And what was the dream?\"  \"Oh--it was only a silly affair, Dick, not worth mentioning.\"  \"But I would like to know what it was.\"  \"Well, then, she dreamed that both of you were in a big forest and he was about to attack you with a gun or a club, she couldn't tell which.  She awoke screaming and I ran to her side, and that is how she told me of the dream.\"     CHAPTER III  AN OLD ENEMY TURNS UP   \"That was certainly an odd dream,\" said Dick, after a short pause. \"I am sure I never want to meet Josiah Crabtree under such circumstances.\"  \"It was silly, Dick--I'd forget it if I was you.\"  \"And she never mentioned the man at any other time?\"  \"No.  But I am certain she is glad he has left for parts unknown. I never, never, want to see him again,\" and the girl shivered.  \"Don't be alarmed, Dora; I don't think he will dare to show himself,\" answered Dick, and on the sly gave her hand a tight squeeze.  They were warmer friends than ever since Dick had rescued her from those who had abducted her.  The kite-flying was now in \"full blast,\" as Sam"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],["title","The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#2)"],["body","it, and the boys had all they could do to keep the various lines from becoming tangled up.  His own kite and Fred's were side by side and for a long time it looked as if neither would mount above the other.  \"Run her up, Fred!  You can win if you try!\" cried several of the cadets.  \"Play out a bit more, Sam; you haven't given your kite all the slack she wants,\" said others.  So the talk ran on, while each contestant did the best to make his kite mount higher.  In the meantime the wind kept increasing in violence, making each kite pull harder than ever.  \"It's a dandy for flying,\" panted Tom, who was holding his kite with all the strength he possessed.  \"Something must give way soon,\" and something did give way.  It was the string he was holding, and as it snapped he went over on his back in such a comical fashion that all, even to the girls, had to laugh.  \"Torn!  Tom!  What a sight!\" burst out Nellie Laning.  \"You should have brought a stronger cord.\"  \"If I had I'd a-gone up in the clouds,\" answered Tom ruefully. \"That's the last of that kite, I suppose; if I--\"  \"The string has caught on Sam's kite!\" interrupted Grace Laning. \"Oh, my!  See both of them going up!\"  \"Now you can win, Sam!\" laughed Dora.  \"Fred, your flying is nowhere now.\"  \"He didn't calculate to fly one kite against two,\" answered Fred. \"Hold on, Sam, where are you going?  The cliff is over in that direction!\" he yelled suddenly.  \"I--I know it!\" came back the alarming answer.  \"But I can't stop myself!\"  \"He can't stop himself!\" repeated Dora.  \"Oh, stop him somebody, before he goes over the cliff!\"  \"Let go of the line!\" shouted Dick.  \"Don't go any closer to the cliff!\"  \"I--I can't let go!  The line is fast around my wrist!\" gasped poor Sam.  \"Oh, dear, it's cutting me like a knife!\"  \"He's in a mess,\" came from Frank.  \"If he isn't careful he'll go over the cliff, as sure as he's born!\"  \"Throw yourself down!\" went on Dick, and, leaving his kite in Hans Mueller's care, he ran after his brother.  By this time Sam had gained a few bushes which grew but a dozen feet away from the edge of the cliff, that at this point was nearly forty feet in height.  With his right hand held a painful prisoner, he clutched at the bushes with his left.  \"I've got the bushes, but I can't hold on long!\" he panted, as Dick came close.  \"Help me, quick!\"  Scarcely had the words left his mouth when the bushes came up by the roots and poor Sam fell over on his side.  Then came another strong puff of wind, and he was dragged to the very edge of the rocky ledge!  \"I'm going!\" he screamed, when, making a mighty leap, Dick caught him by the foot.  \"Catch the rock--anything!\" cried the older brother.  \"If you don't you'll be killed!\"  \"Save me!\" was all poor Sam could say.  \"Oh, Dick, don't let me go over!\"  \"I'll do my best, Sam,\" was Dick's answer, and he held on like grim death.  By this time half a dozen boys were running to the scene.  Dora Stanhope followed, and as she came up she pulled a tiny penknife from her pocket.  \"Can't I cut the line with this?\" she asked, timidly, as she pushed her way to Dick's side.  \"Yes, Yes; cut it!\" moaned Sam.  \"Oh, my wrist is almost cut in two!\"  Stooping low, Dora sawed away at the kite line, which was as taut as a string on a bass fiddle.  Suddenly there was a loud snap and the cord parted.  Sam and Dick fell back from the edge of the cliff, while the entangled kites soared away for parts unknown.  \"Thank Heaven you cut the line, Dora!\" said Dick, who was the first to recover from the excitement of the situation.  He saw that Dora was trembling like a leaf, and he hastened to her support, but she pushed him away and pointed to Sam.  \"Don't mind me--I am all right, Dick,\" she said.  \"Go care for poor Sam.  See how his wrist is bleeding!  Oh, how dreadful!\"  \"Here is my handkerchief; he had better bind it up with that,\" said Grace Laning, as she offered the article.  \"We'll wash the wound first,\" put in Frank, and raced off for some water.  Soon he returned with his stiff hat full, and the cut on Sam's wrist was tenderly washed by the Laning girls, who then bound it up with the skill of a hospital surgeon.  The kite-flying continued for the balance of the afternoon.  But Sam and Dick had had enough of it, and, along with Tom, they took a stroll along the lake front with Dora Stanhope and Grace and Nellie.  Of course both boys and girls talked a whole lot of nonsense, yet all enjoyed the walk very much.  \"This is the spot where they abducted me,\" shivered Dora, as they came to the old boathouse.  \"Oh, what a dreadful time that was, to be sure!\"  \"I don't believe our enemies will bother you any more, Dora,\" said Dick.  \"It's not likely that old Crabtree Will try the same game twice; and Mumps has really turned over a new leaf and gone to work for a living.\"  \"Yes, I was glad to hear that, for I don't believe he was such a bad fellow at heart.  He was under Dan Baxter's influence, just as--as--\"  \"As Josiah Crabtree tried to influence your mother,\" whispered Dick, and Dora nodded slowly.  \"Well, let us forget it, and--My gracious!\"  Dick stopped short, to stare in open-mouthed wonder at a small boat shooting down the lake at a distance of several hundred yards from the shore.  \"What's up?\" came simultaneously from Tom and Sam.  \"Don't you see that fellow in the boat?\" demanded Dick, in increased wonder.  \"Of course we see him,\" answered Tom.  \"Don't you recognize him?\"  \"No; he's too far off,\" came from Sam..  \"It's Dan Baxter!\"  \"Baxter!\" cried Dora.  \"Oh, Dick!\"  \"Nonsense!\" said Tom.  \"How could he be am here?\"  \"It does look a little like Baxter,\" was Sam's slow comment.  \"Yet it seems impossible that he could be here, as Tom says.\"  \"I say it's Baxter,\" affirmed Dick stoutly,  \"I'll hail him and make sure.\"  \"Oh, don't bring him over here!\" interposed Dora, becoming alarmed.  \"Don't be alarmed--he shan't hurt anybody, Dora.\" Dick raised his voice.  \"Hi there, Baxter!  What are you doing here?\"  At first there was no reply, and the boy in the rowboat kept on pulling.  But as Dick repeated his call, the rower threw up his oars.  \"You mind your own business,\" he growled.  \"Guess I can row on the lake if I want to.\"  \"It is Baxter, sure enough!\" ejaculated Tom.  \"The rascal!  We ought to recapture him.\"  \"That's the talk,\" added Sam.  \"I wish my wrist wasn't so sore--I'd go after him.\"  \"There's a boat below here,\" said Dick.  \"Let's put out in that.\"  \"He may--may shoot at you,\" faltered Dora.  \"You know how wicked he can be at times.\"  \"Indeed I do know,\" answered Dick.  \"But he ought to be handed over to the authorities.  It is a crime to let him go free.\"  \"Hi, Baxter.  Come over here; we want to talk to you!\" yelled Tom.  \"Not much!\" growled the former bully of Putnam Hall.  \"You had better come,\" said Sam.  \"If you don't come we'll bring you.\"  \"Hush, Sam, or you'll make a mess of things!\" cried Dick softly, but the warning came too late.  \"Will you bring me back?\" roared the bully.  \"Just try it on and see how I'll fix you.\"  \"Come on for the boat,\" said Tom.  \"We'll show him he can't scare us.\"  He started off and Dick came after him.  Sam was also about to follow, when his elder brother stopped him.  \"You can't do much with that sore wrist, Sam,\" he said.  \"Better stay with the girls until we come back.  You can watch events from the shore, and run for assistance, if it's necessary.\"  Sam demurred at first, but soon saw the wisdom of  Dick's reasoning and consented to remain behind.  By this time Tom had shoved out the rowboat Dick had mentioned--a neat craft belonging to a farmer living near.  A pair of oars lay in a locker on the lake bank; and, securing these, Tom leaped on board of the craft, and soon Dick came after.  Dan Baxter had watched their movement with interest, which speedily gave way to arm when he saw the other boat come out, and beheld Dick and Tom each take up an oar and begin to pull for all they could.  \"I was a clam to come up here, when there  is no real need for it,\" he muttered.  \"Two to one, eh?  Well, I reckon I can put up a pretty stiff fight if it comes to the worst.\" Then he caught up his oars once more, and began to row down Cayuga Lake with all possible speed.     CHAPTER IV  THE CHASE ON THE LAKE   \"He means to give us as much of a chase as possible,\" remarked Tom, as he glanced over his shoulder.  \"If I remember rightly, Baxter was always a pretty fair oarsman.\"  \"Yes, that was the one thing he could do well,\" returned Dick. \"But we ought to be able to catch him, Tom.\"  \"We could if we had two pairs of oars.  One pair can do just about so much and no more.\"  \"Nonsense!  Now, both together, and put all your muscle into it,\" and Dick set a stiff stroke that his brother followed with difficulty.  Baxter had been rowing down the lake, but as soon as he saw that he was being pursued he changed his course for the east shore.  He was settled to his work, and for several minutes it was hard to tell whether he was holding his own or losing.  \"Hurrah! we are catching up!\" cried Dick, after pulling for five minutes.  \"Keep at it, Tom, and we'll have him before he is half over.\"  \"Gosh, but it's hot work!\" came with a pant from Tom Rover.  \"He must be almost exhausted to row like that.\"  \"He knows what he has at stake.  He sees the prison cell staring him in the face again.  You'd do your best, too, if you were in his place.\"  \"I'm doing my best now, Dick.  On we go!\" and Tom renewed his exertions.  Dick set a faster stroke than ever, having caught his second wind, and the rowboat flew over the calm surface of the lake like a thing of life.  \"Keep off!\"  The cry came from Baxter, while he was still a hundred yards from the eastern shore.  \"Keep off, or it will be the worse for you!\"  \"We are not afraid of you, Baxter, and you ought to know it by this time,\" answered Dick.  \"You may as well give in now as later on.\"  \"Give in!  You must be crazy!\"  \"We are two to one, and you know what we"]]]
