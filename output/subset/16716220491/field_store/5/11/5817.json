What can I do?”  Just across the field stood a small house. In the yard the week’s washing was hung out. Among the articles was a red tablecloth.  “May I borrow that tablecloth?” asked Harry, in excitement, of a woman in the doorway.  “Land sakes! what for?” she asked.  “To signal the train. The road’s washed away.”  “Yes, yes; I’m expectin’ my darter on that train,” answered the woman, now as excited as our hero. “Hurry up! the train’s due in fifteen minutes.”  Seizing the tablecloth, Harry gathered it quickly into a bundle and ran back to the railroad. He hurried down the track west of a curve which was a few hundred feet beyond the washout, and saw the train coming at full speed. He jumped on a fence skirting the tracks, and waved the tablecloth wildly.  “Will they see it?” he asked himself, anxiously.  It was an anxious moment for Harry as he stood waving the danger signal, uncertain whether it would attract the attention of the engineer. It did! The engineer, though not understanding the meaning of the signal, not knowing indeed, but it might be a boy’s freak, prudently heeded it, and reversing the engine, stopped the train a short distance of the place of danger.  “Thank God!” exclaimed Harry, breathing a deep sigh of relief.  The engineer alighted from the train, and when he looked ahead, needed no explanation.  “My boy!” he said, with a shudder, “you have saved the train.”  “I am glad of it, sir. My heart was in my mouth, lest you should not see my signal.”  By this time the passengers, whose curiosity had been roused by the sudden halt, began to pour out of the cars.  When they saw the washout, strong men turned pale, and ladies grew faint, while many a fervent ejaculation of gratitude was heard at the wonderful escape.  “We owe our lives to this boy!” said the engineer. “It was he who stood on the fence and signaled me. We owe our deliverance to this--tablecloth.”  A small man, somewhat portly, pushed his way up to Harry.  “What is your name, my lad?” he asked, brusquely.  “Harry Vane.”  “I am the president and leading stockholder of the road, and my property has come very near being the death of me. Gentlemen”--here the president turned to the group of gentlemen around him--“don’t you think this boy deserves a testimonial?”  “Yes, yes!” returned the gentlemen, in chorus.  “So do I, and I lead off with a subscription of twenty dollars.”  One after another followed the president’s lead, the president himself making the rounds bareheaded, and gathering the contributions in his hat.  “Oh, sir!” said Harry, as soon as he understood what was going forward, “don’t reward me for what was only my duty. I should be ashamed to accept anything for the little I have done.”  “You may count it little to save the lives of a train full of people,”  said the president, dryly, “but we set a slight value upon our lives and limbs. Are you rich?”  “No, sir.”  “So I thought. Well, you needn’t be ashamed to accept a little testimonial of our gratitude. You must not refuse.”  When all so disposed had contributed, the president gathered the bills from the hat and handed the pile to Harry.  “Take them, my boy,” he said, “and make good use of them. I shall owe you a considerable balance, for I value my life at more than twenty dollars. Here is my card. If you ever need a friend, or a service, call on me.”  Then the president gave directions to the engineer to run back to the preceding station, where there was a telegraph office, from which messages could be sent in both directions to warn trains of the washout.  Harry was left with his hands full of money, hardly knowing whether he was awake or dreaming.  One thing seemed to him only fair--to give the owner of the tablecloth some small share of the money, as an acknowledgment for the use of her property.  “Here, Madam,” said Harry, when he had retraced his steps to the house, “is your tablecloth, for which I am much obliged. It saved the train.”  “Well, I’m thankful! Little did I ever think a tablecloth would do so much good. Why, it only cost me a dollar and a quarter.”  “Allow me to ask your acceptance of this bill to pay you for the use of it.”  “Land sakes! why, you’ve given me ten dollars!”  “It’s all right. It came from the passengers. They gave me something too.”  “You didn’t tell me your name.”  “My name is Harry Vane.”  “Do you live round here? I never heerd the name afore.”  “I’ve just come to the village. I’m going to live with John Fox.”  “You don’t say! Be you any kin to Fox?”  “Not very near. He’s my guardian.”  “If he hears you’ve had any money give you, he’ll want to take care of it for you.”  This consideration had not occurred to Harry. Indeed, he had for so short a time been the possessor of the money, of which he did not know the amount, that this was not surprising.  “Well, good-morning!” he said.  “Good-morning! It’s been a lucky mornin’ for both of us.”  “I must go somewhere where I can count this money unobserved,” he said to himself.  Not far away he saw a ruined shed.  Harry entered the shed, and sitting down on a log, took out the bills, which he had hurriedly stuffed in his pocket, and began to count them.  “Almost three hundred dollars!” murmured Harry, joyously. “It has been, indeed, a lucky morning for me. It has nearly doubled my property.”  The question arose in his mind: “Should he give this money to Mr. Fox to keep for him?”  “No,” he decided, “I won’t give him this money. I won’t even let him know I have it.” Where, then, could he conceal it? Looking about him, he noticed a little, leather-covered, black trunk, not more than a foot long, and six inches deep. It was locked, but a small key was in the lock.  Opening the trunk he found it empty. The lock seemed in good condition. He made a pile of the bills, and depositing them in this receptacle, locked the trunk and put the key in his pocket.  Now for a place of concealment.  Harry came out of the shed, and looked scrutinizingly around him. Not far away was a sharp elevation surmounted by trees. The hill was a gravelly formation, and therefore dry. At one point near a withered tree, our hero detected a cavity, made either by accident or design. Its location near the tree made it easy to discover.  With a little labor he enlarged and deepened the hole, till he could easily store away the box in its recess, then covered it up carefully, and strewed grass and leaves over all to hide the traces of excavation.  “There that will do,” he said, in a tone of satisfaction.  He had reserved for possible need fifteen dollars in small bills, which he put into his pocketbook.  John Fox had heard the news in the post office, and started off at once for the scene of danger.  “How’d they hear of the washout?” he asked, puzzled.  “I heerd that a boy discovered it, and signaled the train,” said his neighbor.  “How did he do it?”  “Waved a shawl or somethin’.”  “That don’t seem likely; where would a boy find a shawl?”  His informant looked puzzled.  “Like as not he borrowed it of Mrs. Brock,” he suggested.  Mrs. Brock was the woman living in the small house near by, so that the speaker’s surmise was correct. It struck John Fox as possible, and he said so.  “I guess I’ll go and ask the Widder Brock,” he said. “She must have seen the train, livin’ so near as she does.”  “I’ll go along with you.”  The two men soon found themselves on Mrs. Brock’s premises.  “Good-mornin,’ Mrs. Brock,” said John Fox.  “You’ve come nigh havin’ a causality here.”  “You’re right there, Mr. Fox,” answered Mrs. Brock. “I was awful skeered about it, for I thought my Nancy might be on the train. When the boy run into my yard----”  “The boy! What boy?” asked Fox, eagerly.  “It was that boy you are guardeen of.”  “What, Harry Vane?” ejaculated Fox, in genuine surprise.  “Tell me all about it, Mrs. Brock.”  “Well, you see, he ran into my yard all out of breath, and grabbin’ a red tablecloth from the line, asked me if I would lend it to him. ‘Land sakes!’ says I, ‘what do you want of a tablecloth?’”  “‘The track’s washed away,’ he said, ‘and I want to signal the train. There’s danger of an accident.’ Of course, I let him have it, and he did signal the train, standin’ on the fence, and wavin’ the tablecloth. So the train was saved!”  “And did he bring back the tablecloth?”  “Of course, he did, and that wasn’t all. He brought me a ten-dollar bill to pay for the use of it.”  “Gave you a ten-dollar bill!” exclaimed John Fox, in amazement. “That was very wrong.”  “You hadn’t no claim on the money if you are his guardeen. A collection was took up by the passengers, and given to the boy, and he thought I ought to have pay for use of the tablecloth, so he gave me a ten-dollar bill--and a little gentleman he is, too.”  “A collection taken up for my ward?” repeated Fox, pricking up his ears. “Well, well! that is news.”  John Fox was already on his way back to the road. He was anxious to find his ward.     CHAPTER III  HARRY DISAGREES WITH HIS GUARDIAN   Harry and his guardian met at the dinner table. Mrs. Fox had provided a boiled dinner, to which Harry was ready to do justice.  Mr. Fox seemed unusually pleasant.  “I find, Harry,” he said, clearing his throat, “that you have already been distinguishing yourself.”  “Then you heard of the narrow escape of the train?” said Harry.  “Yes, I heard that but for your presence of mind, and Mrs. Brock’s tablecloth, there would have been a smash-up.”  “What on earth are you talkin’ about, John Fox?” demanded his wife, curiously.  “Well, you see, Maria, the rain of last night washed away part of the railroad track, and the train would have been plunged into a gully if our young boarder here hadn’t seen the danger, and, borrowin’ a tablecloth from Mrs. Brock, signaled the train.”  “You don’t say?”  “That isn’t all,” resumed John Fox. “The passengers took up a contribution, and I expect gave"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6461"],["title","Facing the World (#2)"],["body","a handsome sum to our young friend.”  “How much did the folks give you?” asked Joel eagerly.  “I’ve got fifteen dollars left,” he replied. “I gave some money to Mrs. Brock for the use of the tablecloth.”  John Fox looked disappointed and disgusted.  “You don’t mean to say,” he ejaculated, sharply, “that you gave away almost half of your money for the use of an old tablecloth that would be dear at a dollar?”  “If I hadn’t had the tablecloth, I couldn’t have attracted the engineer’s attention,” said Harry, mildly.  There was a little more conversation on the subject, but Harry remained tranquil, and did not appear disturbed by the criticisms elicited by his conduct. He heartily hoped that his guardian’s family would not find out how large a sum he had received.  When dinner was over, Harry was about to leave the house, when John Fox said, insinuatingly: “Don’t you think you’d better give me that money to keep for you? It will be safer in my hands.”  “Thank you, Mr. Fox,” said Harry, “but I think I can take care of it myself.”  “Fifteen dollars is a good deal of money for a boy like you to carry round with you,” said his guardian.  “I don’t think I shall lose it, sir,” replied the boy.  “Perhaps not, but you will be tempted to spend it wastefully.”  John Fox didn’t look amiable. He was in doubt whether he might not properly take from his ward the money by force, but it occurred to him that it would be better not to assert his authority quite so soon.  “We will speak of this again,” he said.  “It is well I didn’t bring all the money home. I wonder how soon Mr. Fox will make another attempt to secure the sum I have with me,”  thought Harry.  The attempt was made that same night.  Harry was afraid he would be expected to occupy the same room with Joel, in which case he could hope for no privacy, and would be unable to conceal his money, which he had little doubt his guardian intended to secure, either by fair means or foul. It chanced, however, that Joel slept in a small bedroom opening out of his parents’ chamber. So Harry was assigned an attic room, in the end of the house, the sides sloping down to the eaves. It was inferior to the chambers on the second floor, but our hero was not disposed to complain. He valued solitude more than superior finish.  Harry’s suspicion was roused by the circumstance that his guardian did not again refer to his money, nor did he manifest any disappointment at his ward’s declining to intrust him with it.  During the evening, Joel brought out a backgammon board, and proposed to Harry to play. If there would have been anything to read Harry would have preferred entertaining himself in that way, but Mr. Fox didn’t appear to be literary. There were a few books in the house, but they were not of an attractive character.  Partly in backgammon, partly in conversation with the son and heir of the Foxes, the time passed till half-past eight o’clock.  “Joel, you can go to bed,” said his mother. “It is half-past eight.”  Joel yawned, and interposed no objection.  “You may as well go, too, Harry,” said Mrs. Fox.  “I am ready to go to bed,” said Harry.  In fact, he felt rather sleepy, and anticipated little pleasure in sitting up in the far from exciting company of Mr. and Mrs. Fox.  “Joel!” said his mother, “take this candle and show Harry upstairs in the attic chamber.”  “Yes, mam.”  So, preceded by Joel, Harry went up two flights of stairs to the attic room reserved for him. It was the only room that had been finished off, and the garret outside looked dark and forbidding.  “I would be scared to sleep up here,” said his companion.  “I shall not be at all frightened, Joel,” said Harry.  “Good-night. Just hold the candle while I go downstairs.”  When he was fairly all alone, Harry began to look about him, to ascertain in what kind of quarters he was to pass the night. To begin with he examined the door, he ascertained that it was a common latch door, and there was no lock. There was nothing to prevent anyone entering the room during the night. There was a small cot bed in one corner, a chair, and an old wooden chest. There was no bureau nor washstand. The absence of the latter annoyed Harry.  He learned afterward that he was expected to go downstairs and wash in a large basin in the kitchen sink--wiping his face on a brown, roll towel which was used by the entire family. This was quite unsatisfactory to Harry, who was scrupulously neat in his tastes.  “This isn’t a palace exactly,” Harry said to himself.  Then came the thought, “What was he to do with his money?”  Now, it so happened that Harry was the possessor of two pocketbooks--one--shabby, and well worn, which he had failed to throw away on buying another just before he left home. In connection with this, a scheme for outwitting Mr. Fox came into his mind. He folded up a fragment of newspaper, and put it into the old pocketbook, bulging it out till it looked well filled, and this he left in the pocket of his pantaloons.  “Now to hide the other,” said he to himself.  He looked about the room seeking for some place of concealment. Finally he noticed in one portion of the floor a square board, which looked as if it might be lifted. He stooped over and succeeded in raising it. The space beneath was about a foot in depth--the lower level being the lathing and plastering of the room below.  “That will do,” said Harry, in a tone of satisfaction. “I don’t think Mr. Fox will find my money here,” and dropping the pocketbook into the cavity he replaced the square board. Then he went to bed and awaited results.  When Harry had gone up to his bed, Mr. and Mrs. Fox naturally began to compare notes respecting him.  “That new boy rides a high horse,” said Mrs. Fox, grimly. “Are you going to allow it?”  “Certainly not.”  “He wouldn’t give up his money to you, though you are his guardeen.”  “Very true, but I mean to have it all the same. I shall go up to his bedroom after he is asleep, and then it will be the easiest thing in the world to take the pocketbook without his knowin’ anything about it.”  “He’ll know it in the mornin’.”  “Let him! Possession is nine p’ints of the law, Mrs. Fox.”  “He might say you stole it.”  “He can’t do that, for I’m his guardeen, don’t you see?”  A little after ten Mr. Fox, considering that Harry must be sound asleep, decided to make him a visit. He removed his shoes, and in his stocking feet, candle in hand, began to ascend the narrow and steep staircase which led to the attic.  “Shall I go with you, John?” queried his helpmeet.  “No, I guess I can manage alone.”  His wife wanted to share in the excitement of the night visit. There was something alluring in the thought of creeping upstairs, and removing by stealth, the pocketbook of the new inmate of their home.  Left to himself, Mr. Fox pursued his way up the attic stairs. They creaked a little under his weight, and, much to his annoyance, when he reached the landing at the top he coughed.  “I hope the boy won’t hear me,” he said to himself.  He paused an instant, then softly opened the door of Harry’s chamber.  All seemed satisfactory. Our hero was lying quietly in bed, apparently in a peaceful sleep. Ordinarily he would have been fast asleep by this time, but the expectation of a visit from his guardian had kept him awake beyond his usual time. He had heard Mr. Fox cough, and so, even before the door opened, he had warning of the visit.  Harry was not a nervous boy, and had such command of himself, that, even when Mr. Fox bent over, and, by the light of the candle, examined his face, he never stirred nor winked, though he very much wanted to laugh.  “All is safe! The boy is sound asleep,” whispered Mr. Fox to himself.  He set the candle on the floor, and then taking up Harry’s pantaloons, thrust his hand into the pocket.  The very first pocket contained the pocketbook which our hero had put there. Mr. Fox would have opened and examined the contents on the spot, but he heard a cough from the bed, and, quickly put the pocketbook into his own pocket, apprehending that his ward might wake up, and taking up the candle, noiselessly withdrew from the chamber.  After he had fairly gone, Harry had a quiet laugh to himself.  Mr. Fox returned in triumph to his own chamber, where his wife was anxiously waiting for him.  “Have you got it, Mr. F.,” she asked, eagerly.  “Got it? Why shouldn’t I get it?”  “Well, open it, and let us see what it contains.”  This Mr. Fox proceeded to do. But no sooner did his glance rest on its contents than his lower jaw fell, and his eyes opened wide in perplexity.  “Well, what are you staring at like a fool?” demanded his wife, who was not so situated that she could see the contents of the pocketbook.  “Look at this, Mrs. F.,” said her husband, in a hollow voice. “There’s no money here--only this piece of newspaper.”  “Well, well, of all the fools I ever saw you are about the most stupid!” ejaculated Mrs. Fox. “What you undertake you generally carry through, do you? After all the fuss you’ve brought down a pocketbook stuffed with waste paper.”  “I don’t understand it,” said Fox, his face assuming a look of perplexity. “Surely the boy told the truth when he said he had fifteen dollars.”  “Of course! Joel saw the money--a roll of bills, and saw him take them out of his pocketbook. He must have taken them out. Did you search all his pockets?”  “No; when I found the pocketbook I thought I was all right.”  “Just like a man!” retorted Mrs. Fox. “I’ll go up myself, and see if I can’t manage better than you.”  “Then you’d better take this wallet, and put it back in his pocket.”  “Give it to me, then.”  With a firm step Mrs. Fox took the candle, and took her turn in going up the attic stairs.     CHAPTER IV  MRS. FOX COMES TO GRIEF   Harry confidently anticipated a second visit to his chamber.  He was rather surprised when the door was again opened, and Mrs. Fox entered. Opening his eyes a little way, he saw her, after a brief glance at the bed, go to the chair"]]]
