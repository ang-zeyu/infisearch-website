Come up to the Library building and see us some Friday night--the boys, I mean.\"  \"Oh, are you the boss o' them regiment fellers?\"  \"Not exactly the boss; scouts we call ourselves.\"  \"What's a scout? A soldier, like?\"  \"No, a scout's a fellow that does stunts and things.\"  \"I betcher _you_ kin do a few.\"  \"I bet I can!\" laughed Mr. Ellsworth; \"you said it! I've got some of those boys guessing.\" Which was the plain truth.  \"Drop in some Friday night and see us; don't forget now.\"  Tom watched him as he ascended the steps of a neighboring porch. He had a strange fascination for the boy, and it was not till the door closed behind him that Tom's steady gaze was averted. Then he shuffled off down the street.     CHAPTER II  \"HATS OFF\"    Tom Slade awoke at about eleven o'clock, swung his legs to the floor, yawned, rubbed his eyes, felt blindly for his tattered shoes and sniffed the air.  Something was wrong, that was sure. Tom sniffed again. Something had undoubtedly happened. The old familiar odor which had dwelt in the Slade apartment all winter, the stuffy smell of bed clothes and dirty matting, of kerosene and smoke and fried potatoes and salt-fish and empty beer bottles, had given place to something new. Tom sniffed again.  Then, all of a sudden, his waking senses became aware of his father seated in his usual greasy chair, sideways to the window.  And the window was open!  The stove-lifter which had been used to pry it up lay on the sill, and the spring air, gracious and democratic, was pouring in amid the squalor just as it was pouring in through the wide-swung cathedral windows of John Temple's home up in Grantley Square.  \"Yer opened the winder, didn' yer?\" said Tom.  \"Never you mind what I done,\" replied his father.  \"Ain't it after six?\"  \"Never you mind what 'tis; git yer cap 'n' beat it up to Barney's for a pint.\"  \"Ain't we goin' to have no eats?\"  \"No, we ain't goin' ter have no eats. You tell Barney to give ye a cup o' coffee; tell 'im I said so.\"  \"Awh, he wouldn' give me no pint widout de money.\"  \"He wouldn', wouldn' he? I'll _pint_ you!\"  \"I ain't goin' ter graft on him no more.\"  \"Git me a dime off Tony then and stop in Billy's comin' back 'n' tell him I got the cramps agin and can't work.\"  \"He'll gimme the laugh.\"  \"I'll give ye the other kind of a laugh if ye don't beat it. I left you sleep till eleven o'clock--\"  \"You didn' leave me sleep,\" said Tom. \"Yer only woke up yerself half an hour ago.\"  \"Yer call me a liar, will ye?\" roared Bill Slade, rising.  Tom took his usual strategic position on the opposite side of the table, and as his father moved ominously around it, kept the full width of it between them. When he reached a point nearest the sink he grabbed a dented pail therefrom and darted out and down the stairs.  Up near Grantley Square was a fence which bore the sign, \"Post No Bills.\" How this had managed to escape Tom hitherto was a mystery, but he now altered it, according to the classic hoodlum formula, so that it read, \"Post No Bills,\" and headed up through the square for Barney Galloway's saloon. Bill Slade had been reduced to long-distance intercourse in the matter of saloons for he had exhausted his credit in all the places near Barrel Alley.  In the spacious garden of John Temple's home a girl of twelve or thirteen years was bouncing a ball. This was Mary Temple, and what business \"old\" John Temple had with such a pretty and graceful little daughter, I am not qualified to explain.  \"Chuck it out here,\" said Tom, \"an' I'll ketch it in the can.\"  She retreated a few yards into the garden, then turned, and gave Tom a withering stare.  \"Chuck it out here and I'll chuck it back--honest,\" called Tom.  The girl's dignity began to show signs of collapse. She wanted to have that ball thrown, and to catch it.  \"Will you promise to toss it back?\" she weakened.  \"Sure.\"  \"Word and honor?\"  \"Sure.\"  \"Cross your heart?\"  \"Sure.\"  Still she hesitated, arm in air.  \"Will you promise to throw it back?\"  \"Sure, hope to die. Chuck it.\"  \"Get back a little,\" said she.  The ball went sailing over the paling, Tom caught it, gave a yell of triumph, beat a tattoo upon the can, and ran for all he was worth.  Outside the saloon Tom borrowed ten cents from Tony, the bootblack, on his father's behalf, and with this he purchased the beer.  Meanwhile, the bad turn which he had done had begun to sprout and by the time he reached home it had grown and spread to such proportions that Jack's beanstalk was a mere shrub compared with it. Nothing was farther from John Temple's thoughts that beautiful Saturday than to pay a visit to Barrel Alley. On the contrary, he was just putting on his new spring hat to go out to the Country Club for a turn at golf, when Mary came in crying that Tom Slade had stolen her ball.  Temple cared nothing about the ball, nor a great deal about Mary's tears, but the mention of Tom Slade reminded him that the first of the month was close at hand and that he had intended to \"warn\" Bill Slade with the usual threat of eviction. Bill had never paid the rent in full after the second month of his residence in Barrel Alley. When he was working and Temple happened to come along at a propitious moment, Bill would give him two dollars or five dollars, as the case might be, but as to how the account actually stood he had not the slightest idea.  If Tom had not sent Mary Temple into the house crying her father would never have thought to go through Barrel Alley on his way out to the Country Club, but as it was, when Tom turned into the Alley from Main Street, he saw Mr. Temple's big limousine car standing in front of his own door.  If there was one thing in this world more than another dear to the heart of Tom Slade, it was a limousine car. Even an Italian organgrinder did not offer the mischievous possibilities of a limousine. He had a regular formula for the treatment of limousines which was as sure of success as a \"cure all.\"  Placing his pail inside the doorway, he approached the chauffeur with a suspiciously friendly air which boded mischief. After a strategic word or two of cordiality, he grasped the siren horn, tooted it frantically, pulled the timer aroundr opened one of the doors, jumped in and out of the opposite door, leaving both open, and retreated as far as the corner, calling, \"Yah-h-h-h-h!\"  In a few minutes he returned very cautiously, sidled up to the house door, and took his belated way upstairs.  Tom placed his pail on the lower step of the stair leading up to the floor above his own, but did not enter the room whence emanated the stern voice of John Temple and the lying excuses of his father. He went down and out on the door step and sat on the railing, gazing at the chauffeur with an exasperating look of triumph.  \"I wouldn' be no lousy Cho-fure,\" he began.  The chauffeur (who received twenty-five dollars a week) did not see the force of this remark.  \"Runnin' over kids all de time-you lie, _yer did too_!\"  The chauffeur looked straight ahead and uttered not a word.  \"Yer'd be in jail if 'twuzn't fer old John paying graft ter the cops!\"  The chauffeur, who knew his place, made never a sign.  \"Yer stinkin' thief! Yer don't do a thing but cop de car fer joy-rides--didn' yer?\"  At this the chauffeur stirred slightly.  \"Yes, yer will!\" yelled Tom, jumping down from the railing.  He had just picked up a stone, when the portly form of John Temple emerged from the door behind him.  \"Put down that stone, sir, or I'll lock you up!\" said he with the air of one who is accustomed to being obeyed.  \"G-wan, he called me a liar!\" shouted Tom.  \"Well, that's just what you are,\" said John Temple, \"and if certain people of this town spent less for canvas uniforms to put on their boys to make tramps out of them, we should be able, perhaps, to build an addition to the jail.\"  \"Ya-ah, an' you'd be de first one to go into it!\" Tom yelled, as Temple reached the step of his car.  \"What's that?\" said Temple, turning suddenly.  \"That's _what!_\" shouted Tom, letting fly the stone. It went straight to its mark, removing \"old\" John's spring hat as effectually as a gust of wind, and leaving it embedded in the mud below the car.  [Illustration: \"CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT THEY'RE A-DOIN?\" ROARED HIS FATHER.]     CHAPTER III  IN JAIL AND OUT AGAIN    That night, when Tom Slade, all unaware of the tragedy which threatened his young life, shuffled into Billy's garage, he announced to his followers a plan which showed his master mind as leader of the gang. \"Hey,\" said he, \"I heard Sissy Bennett's mother say she's goin' ter have a s'prise party fer him Friday night, 'n' d'yer know wot I'm goin' ter do?\"  \"Tell him and spoil it fer him?\" ventured Joe Flynn.  \"Na-a-h!\"  \"Tick-tack?\" asked Slush Ryder.  \"Na-ah, tick-tacks is out o' date,\"  \"Cord ter trip 'em up?\"  \"Guess agin, guess agin,\" said Tom, exultantly.  But as no one ventured any further guesses, he announced his plan forthwith.  \"Don't say a word-don't say a word,\" he ejaculated. \"I swiped two o' thim quarantine signs offen two doors, 'n' I'm gon'er tack one up on Sissy's door Friday night! Can yer beat it?\"  None of them could beat it, for it was an inspiration. To turn away Master Connover's young guests by this simple but effectual device was worthy of the leadership qualities of Tom Slade. Having thus advertised the possibilities of the signs he took occasion to announce,  \"I got anoder one, an' I'll sell it fer a dime.\" But even though he marked it down to a dime, none would buy, so he announced his intention of raffling it off.  Before the momentous evening of Connover's party arrived, however, something else happened which had a curious and indirect effect upon the carrying out of Tom's plan.  On Wednesday afternoon three men came down Barrel Alley armed with a paper for Bill Slade. It was full of \"whereases\" and \"now, therefores\" and other things which Bill did not comprehend, but he understood well enough the meaning of their errand.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6655"],["title","Tom Slade : Boy Scout of the Moving Pictures (#2)"],["body","stone which Tom had thrown at John Temple had rebounded with terrific force!  One man would have been enough, goodness knows, to do the job in hand, for there were only six or seven pieces of furniture. They got in each other's way a good deal and spat tobacco juice, while poor helpless, inefficient Bill Slade stood by watching them.  From various windows and doors the neighbors watched them too, and some congratulated themselves that their own rents were paid, while others wondered what would become of poor Tom now.  This was the scene which greeted Tom as he came down Barrel Alley from school.  \"Wot are they doin'?\" he asked.  \"Can't you see wot they're a-doin'?\" roared his father. \"'Tain't them that's doin' it neither, it's _you--you done it!!_ It's _you_ took the roof from over my head, you and old John Temple!\" Advancing menacingly, he poured forth a torrent of abuse at his wretched son.  \"The two o' yez done it! You wid yer rocks and him wid his dirty marshals and judges! I'll get the both o' yez yet! Ye sneakin' rat!\"  He would have struck Tom to the ground if Mrs. O'Connor, a mournful figure in shoddy black, had not crossed the street and forced her way between them.  \"'Twas _you_ done it, Bill Slade, and not him, and don't you lay yer hand on him--mind that! 'Twas you an' your whiskey bottle done it, you lazy loafer, an' the street is well rid o' you. Don't you raise your hand agin me, Bill Slade--I'm not afraid o' the likes o' you. I tell you 'twas _you_ sent the poor boy's mother to her grave--you and your whiskey bottle!\"  \"I--I--ain't scared uv him!\" said Tom.  \"You stay right here now and don't be foolish, and me an' you'll go over an' have a cup o' coffee.\"  Just then one of the men emerged bearing in one arm the portrait of the late Mrs. Slade and in the other hand Bill Slade's battered but trusty beer can. The portrait he laid face up on the table and set the can on it.  Perhaps it is expecting too much to assume that a city marshal would have any sense of the fitness of things, but it was an unfortunate moment to make such a mistake. As Mrs. O'Connor lifted the pail a dirty ring remained on the face of the portrait.  \"D'yer see wot yer done?\" shrieked Tom, rushing at the marshal. \"D'yer see wot yer done?\"  There was no stopping him. With a stream of profanity he rushed at the offending marshal, grabbing him by the neck, and the man's head shook and swayed as if it were in the grip of a mad dog.  It was in vain that poor Mrs. O'Connor attempted to intercede, catching hold of the infuriated boy and calling,  \"Oh, Tommy, for the dear Lord's sake, stop and listen to me!\"  Tom did not even hear.  The marshal, his face red and his eyes staring, went down into the mud of Barrel Alley and the savage, merciless pounding of his face could be heard across the way.  While the other marshals pulled Tom off his half-conscious victim, the younger contingent came down the street escorting a sauntering blue-coat, who swung his club leisurely and seemed quite master of the situation.  \"He kilt him, he kilt him!\" called little Sadie McCarren.  Tom, his scraggly hair matted, his face streaming, his chest heaving, and his ragged clothing bespattered, stood hoisting up his suspender, safe in the custody of the other two marshals.  \"Take this here young devil around to the station,\" said one of the men, \"for assault and battery and interferin' with an officer of the law in the performance of his dooty.\"  \"Come along, Tom,\" said the policeman; \"in trouble again, eh?\"  \"Can't yer leave him go just this time?\" pleaded Mrs. O'Connor. \"He ain't himself at all--yer kin see it.\"  \"Take him in,\" said the rising victim, \"for interferin' with an officer of the law in the performance of dooty.\"  \"Where's his folks?\" the policeman asked, not unkindly.  It was then the crowd discovered that Bill Slade had disappeared.  \"I'll have to take you along,\" said the officer.  Tom said never a word. He had played his part in the proceedings, and he was through.  \"Couldn't yer leave him come over jist till I make him a cup o' coffee?\" Mrs. O'Connor begged.  \"They'll give him his dinner at the station, ma'am,\" the policeman answered.  Mrs. O'Connor stood there choking as Tom was led up the street, the full juvenile force of Barrel Alley thronging after him.  \"Wouldn' yer leave me pull my strap up?\" he asked the policeman.  The officer released his arm, taking him by the neck instead, and the last that Mrs. O'Connor saw Tom was hauling his one rebellious strand of suspender up into place.  \"Poor lad, I don't know what'll become uv him now,\" said Mrs. O'Connor, pausing on her doorstep to speak with a neighbor.  \"And them things over there an' night comin' on,\" said her companion. \"I wisht that alarm clock was took away--seems as if 'twas laughin' at the whole thing--like.\"  \"'Tain't only his bein' arrested,\" said Mrs. O'Connor, \"but ther' ain't no hope for him at all, as I kin see. Ther's no one can in_floo_ence him.\"  In Court, the next morning, the judge ruled out all reference to the disfigurement of Mrs. Slade's portrait as being \"incompetent and irrelevant,\" and when the \"assault and battery\" could not be made to seem \"an act done in self-defense and by reason of the imminent peril of the accused,\" Tom was taken to the \"jug\" to spend the balance of the day and to ponder on the discovery that a \"guy\" has no right to \"slam\" a marshal just because he sets a dirty beer can on his mother's picture.  His first enterprise after his liberation was a flank move on Schmitt's Grocery where he stole a couple of apples and a banana, which latter he ate going along the street. These were his only luncheon. The banana skin he threw on the pave-ment.  In a few moments he heard footsteps behind him and, turning, saw a small boy coming along dangling the peel he had dropped. The boy was a jaunty little fellow, wearing a natty spring suit. It was, in fact, \"Pee-wee\" Harris, Tenderfoot, who was just starting out to cover Provision 5 of the Second Class Scout requirements, for he was going to be a Second Class Scout before camping-time, or know the reason why.  \"You drop that?\" he asked pleasantly.  \"Ye-re, you kin have it,\" said Tom cynically.  \"Thanks,\" said Pee-wee, and the banana peel went sailing over the fence into Temple's lot.  \"First thing you know somebody'd get a free ride on that thing,\" said Pee-wee.  \"Ye-re?\" said Tom sneeringly.  \"And if anybody got anything free near John Temple's property----\"  \"Dere's where yer said it, kiddo,\" said Tom, approvingly.  \"So long,\" said Pee-wee, and went gaily on, walking a little, then running a little, then walk-ing again, until Tom thought he must be crazy. Happening just at that minute to finish one of his apples (or rather one of Schmitt's apples) he let fly the core straight for the back of Pee-wee's head.  Then a most extraordinary thing, happened. Without so much as turning round, Pee-wee raised his hand, caught the core, threw it over into the lot, and then, turning, laughed, \"Thanks, good shot!\"  Tom had always supposed that the back of a person's head was a safe target, and he could not comprehend the instinct which was so alert and highly-tuned that it could work entirely independent of the eyes. But this was merely one of Pee-wee's specialties, and his amazing progress from Tenderfoot to Star Scout is a story all by itself.  Tom hoisted himself onto the board fence and attacked the other apple. Just then along came \"Sweet Caporal\" demanding the core.  \"Gimme it 'n' I'll put yer wise ter sup'm.\"  Tom made the speculation.  \"Wop Joe's around de corner wid his pushcart? wot d'ye say we give him de spill?\"  They were presently joined by \"Slats\" Corbett, and the \"Two Aces,\" Jim and Jake Mattenberg, and shortly thereafter Wop Joe's little candystand was carried by assault.  The gum-drops and chocolate bars which did not find their way into the pockets of the storming host, were strewn about the street, the whistle of the peanut-roaster was broken off and Tom went scooting down the street tooting it vigorously.  This affair scattered the gang for the time, and presently Tom and \"Sweet Caporal\" found themselves together. They got an empty bottle from an ash wagon, broke it and distributed the pieces along Broad Street, which they selected as a sort of \"mine area\" for the embarrassment of auto traffic.  Tom then shuffled into the Public Library, ostensibly to read, but in fact to decorate the books according to his own theories of art, and was ejected because he giggled and scuffed his feet and interfered with the readers.  It would not be edifying to follow Tom's shuffling footsteps that afternoon, nor to enumerate the catalogue of unseemly phrase and vicious mischief which filled the balance of the day. He wound up his career of glory by one of the most contemptible things which he had ever done. He went up at dusk and tacked his quarantine sign to the outer gate of the Bennett place.  \"Gee, I hope they're all home,\" he said.  They _were_ all at home and Mrs. Bennett, whom he hated, was busy with preparation and happy anticipations for her unsuspecting son. That the wretched plan did not succeed was due to no preparatory omission on the part of Tom, but because something happened which changed the whole face of things.     CHAPTER IV  CAMP SOLITAIRE    Tom's visit to the Library reminded him that it was here \"them regiment fellers\" met, and since it was near the Bennett place he decided to loiter thereabout, partly for the ineffable pleasure of beholding the side-tracking of Connover's party, and partly in the hope of seeing Mr. Ellsworth again.  So he shuffled around a little before dark and did sentinel duty between the two places. He wanted something to eat very much indeed, and he surmised that such a sympathetic fellow as young Mr. Ellsworth would \"give him the lend of a nickel\" especially if he were tipped off in regard to the coming ball game.
