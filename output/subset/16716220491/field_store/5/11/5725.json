Having lost his sense of direction, he had charged the wrong way.  As the bomb exploded in the French trenches, men rushed toward him. Still grasping several bombs, Briggs stared at them in wide-eyed surprise.  An officer rushed up to him.  Briggs explained the situation.  Fortunately, no one had been wounded by the bomb.  \"You Americans!  You Americans!\" exclaimed the French officer.  \"But go!\" he commanded.  \"Your men are out there,\" pointing; \"do you not hear the sounds of conflict?  If you charge there with the courage with which you have charged here, you may be of some use after all.\"  Briggs wasted no time.  With a flush on his face, he again leaped to the parapet, and, a moment later, disappeared in the darkness, running as swiftly as he could to where firing indicated that the battle raged.  Meanwhile, what of Hal and Chester, and the American troops?  As the Americans poured from their shell holes after the first outburst of firing, they dashed toward where they could make out the forms of German infantry close at hand.  From beyond, the French, who had taken up a position as the French commander had outlined to Hal, poured a withering fire into the foe. The German officer in command immediately halted his advance, wheeled his men, and gave battle to the French.  At almost the same moment the Americans dashed upon his men from the rear.  One volley the Americans poured into the Germans, then their arms drew back and an avalanche of hand grenades sped on their mission of death.  The execution was terrific.  In vain the German officers attempted to hold their men to the work in hand.  Teuton ranks lost formation, and, as the Americans advanced with the bayonet, the enemy broke and fled.  The German surprise had failed; it had been on the other hand.  As the Germans retreated, the Americans pursued.  A body of troops, led by Hal, came, upon an isolated group of the enemy.  \"Surrender!\" cried Hal.  The Germans needed no second offer. Their guns went to the ground at the lad's words, and they raised their hands in the air.  They were made prisoners and sent to the rear.  There was one officer among them--a captain.  At the command from the French general, pursuit of the enemy was abandoned, much to the disgust of the American troops, who were for pursuing the Germans clear to their trenches, and beyond, if possible. Hal and Chester, however, realized the wisdom of the French commander's order, for there was a possibility, should the French and Americans advance too close, of their being set upon by overwhelming numbers from the German trenches, or of their being caught by batteries of rapid-firers, which most likely would have meant extermination.  As the French and Americans moved back toward their trenches--the engagement had consumed only it few minutes--Hal and Chester saw a man come flying toward them.  This, although the lads did not know it at the time, was Briggs.  Straight past the American troops Briggs sped, and disappeared in the darkness beyond.  \"Hello!\" said Hal, \"that man is an American.  Wonder where he's going?\"  \"It's Briggs, sir,\" said a man in the ranks.  \"He has queer spells some times.  Can we go after him, sir?\"  Hal put the question up to Captain O'Neill.  The captain hesitated.  \"My friend and I will go,\" said Hal.  \"We've been in this fighting game too long to take unnecessary chances, sir, but I don't like to see the man get into trouble when we can save him.\"  \"Very well,\" said the captain; \"you have my permission, but don't go too close.\"  \"I'd like another man, sir.\"  \"Take your choice.\"  Hal glanced at the men, and called:  \"McKenzie.\"  A soldier stepped forward.  This man, at one time, had been a top sergeant in the British army.  He had served through the Boer war in South Africa.  Hal had met him at the Fort Niagara training camp a few months before, and, while the man had failed to obtain a commission there, Hal had been able to have him enlisted in the regular army.  \"Will you go with us, McKenzie?\" asked the lad. McKenzie saluted.  \"Glad to, sir,\" he replied.  \"Good!  Then come on,\" said Hal.  \"We are wasting time here.\"  Hal led the way at a rapid trot.  He feared that Briggs had already approached too close to the German trenches, and the distance was so short that there was little likelihood of overtaking the man before he reached the trenches.  The only salvation was, so far as Hal could see, that Briggs might have stopped before he reached the trenches.  As the three pushed forward, there came a sudden explosion ahead, followed closely by a second blast.  The three redoubled their speed, and, a moment later, came in sight of the German trenches.  A strange sight met their eyes.  There, upon the top of the German parapet, stood Briggs.  His right arm was raised and in it the lads could see a bomb. Apparently the explosions a moment before had come from the same source.  As the three looked on, Briggs sent another bomb hurling down into the German lines.  There was a third blast.  \"Great Scott!\" cried Chester.  \"How can he get away with that?  Why don't they shoot him?\"  \"They're trying,\" said Hal.  \"You can hear the bullets.  They are flying over his head!\"  The lad raised his voice in a shout: \"Briggs! Come down here!\"  Briggs glanced down. Hal, Chester, and McKenzie had approached close now, and Briggs made out their features as he gazed down.  \"One moment, sir,\" he said, \"and I'll be with you.\"  Deliberately he drew back his arm again, and, a moment later his last bomb was hurled into the foe.  As the explosion resounded from the German trenches, Briggs leaped down lightly, approached Hal and Chester, and saluted.  \"I'm ready now, sir,\" he said.  \"Then run!\" cried Hal.  The four suited the action to the word, and dashed back toward the American trenches.  From behind a volley a rifle fire crackled after them.  \"Anybody hit?\" cried Hal, as they dashed along.  There were four negative answers.  Five minutes later the four were safe in the American trenches.      CHAPTER III  A DANGEROUS MISSION  It was noon of the following day.  Hal and Chester stood at attention before General Pershing, the American commander-in-chief.  The latter gazed at them long and earnestly.  With a half shrug he muttered, as he turned to his desk:  \"But they are so young.\"  The words were not meant for the lads' ears, but Hal and Chester overheard them.  Hal spoke:  \"If you please, Sir,\" he said quietly, \"we are not so young as you seem to believe.  To me, Sir, our experience seems very old.\"  General Pershing glanced up from a pile of papers he was perusing. Again he looked at the two lads in silence.  The two boys bore the close scrutiny unflinchingly.  At length General Pershing got to his feet, and, approaching Hal and Chester, laid a. hand on the shoulder of each.  \"You are brave youngsters,\" he said quietly.  \"From what you have done since the American troops reached France, I know that Marshal Joffre and General Haig have not spoken too highly of you; and yet,\" here the American commander hesitated a moment before continuing; \"and yet the piece of work I have in sight will entail, perhaps, more danger, more finesse, and more resourcefulness than any mission you have ever undertaken.\"  \"You will find that we shall not be found wanting, sir,\" said Chester respectfully.  \"I am sure of that,\" was General Pershing's response.  \"It isn't that I question your courage or your resourcefulness; but, because of your youth, in this particular business, I question your wisdom.  It is a task for older and wiser heads, but--\"  General Pershing broke off and became silent.  Hal and Chester did not interrupt his meditations.  At length the general continued:  \"I wish to say before going any further that this mission, if you undertake it, in all probabilities, will mean death for one of you.  It is for this reason that the task in hand requires the services of at least two men.  One to go and come back, and the other to go--and come back if he can.  It may be that neither will return, and yet one must return if the safety of his country is to be maintained.\"  \"We shall do our best, sir, if we are entrusted with the mission,\" said Chester quietly.  Again General Pershing hesitated.  Then he took his decision.  \"Draw up stools here,\" he said, and made room at his desk.  The lads did so.  General Pershing spoke in a low voice.  \"You both undoubtedly know,\" he said, \"that since the American declaration of war on Germany, the activity of German agents and spies in the United States has grown to startling dimensions?\"  The lads nodded and General Pershing continued:  \"Very good.  Now, I have before me a cable, in code, from the state department, which advises me that the department of state must have, at all hazards, a list of the most important German agents in America.  It is essential.  Here,\" the general pushed a slip of paper in front of the lads, \"is the translation of the code message.\"  Hal and Chester glanced at the paper. It read:  \"German prime minister has lists of agents and spies in United States. Realize it is not in your province to get list, but would enlist your aid, because our diplomatic agents have all left Germany.  List is essential to safeguarding coast defenses and munitions plants.  Do what you can.\"  The message was signed by the secretary of state.  Hal passed the paper back to General Pershing.  The latter eyed him keenly.  \"'You realize the dangerous nature of the work?\" he questioned.  \"Perfectly, sir; also its importance.  We shall be glad to undertake it, sir.\"  \"Very well.  Now I have a little information that may be of value.  In another code message from the state department I am advised that efforts are being made to get a member of the diplomatic staff back into Berlin.  There is one person in the German capital whom you may trust.\"  General"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6083"],["title","The Boy Allies with Haig in Flanders; Or, the Fighting Canadians of Vimy Ridge (#2)"],["body","lowered his voice.  \"That person,\" he said, \"is the wife of the German undersecretary for foreign affairs.  She is an American woman, and upon several occasions has been of service to her own country.  Her name is Schweiring.\"  \"We shall remember, sir,\" said Chester.  \"Now,\" said General Pershing, \"I have no advice to offer as to how you shall reach Berlin, nor how you shall go about your work.  Once in Berlin, however, you will have to be governed by circumstances.  You speak German, I am told?\"  \"Like natives, sir,\" said Hal with a grin.  \"Very well.  I shall see that you are granted indefinite leave of absence.  There is just one thing more.  I want to say that I do not like to ask my men to become spies.\"  \"Why, sir,\" said Chester gravely, \"it's all for our country; and the day when a spy was looked down upon has gone.  It is just another way of serving ones country, sir.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said General Pershing, \"the punishment is the same as it has been down the ages: death.\"  \"If caught,\" Hal added with a smile.  \"True,\" was his commander's response, and a slight smile lighted, up his own features.  He arose and extended his hand.  Both lads shook it heartily.  \"I hope,\" said General Pershing, \"that you may both come through safely.  But if you don't--well, good-bye.  I don't need to tell you that if one can get through with the list that, from the nation's standpoint, what happens to the other is insignificant.\"  \"I have a request to make, sir,\" said Hal, as they turned to go.  \"Consider it granted,\" replied his commander.  \"It is this,\" said Hal.  \"I believe that it would be well for us to take a third man along.  It may be that he will never reach the German lines, but he should prove of help for the other two.\"  \"Have you the man in mind?\" asked General Pershing.  \"Yes, sir.  A man named McKenzie, a private in our troop.  He's a Canadian, and has seen years of active service.  Also, as I happen to know, he speaks German fluently.\"  \"I shall give you a paper authorizing his indefinite leave of absence,\" said General Pershing.  He scribbled a few words on a piece of paper, and passed it to the lad.  The boys drew themselves to attention, saluted, and left.  \"A pretty ticklish piece of business,\" said Chester quietly, as they made their way to their own quarters.  \"Rather,\" said Hal dryly; \"and still it must be done.  The safety of America depends upon the success of our mission.  It may be well that it has been entrusted to us rather than to older men.  We are less likely to be suspected if we reach Berlin safely.  Besides, we have been there before, and are somewhat familiar with the city.\"  \"Yes,\" said Chester grimly, \"we've been there several times before.  I recall that we went there once very much against our will--prisoners.\"  \"Well, we didn't stay very long,\" said Hal.  \"Let's hope we don't stay for keeps this time either,\" said Chester. \"To tell the truth, I don't think much of this spy business myself.\"  \"Somebody has to do it,\" Hal declared.  \"Of course, but I am not very fond of that sort of work.\"  \"If you don't want to go--\" Hal began, but Chester interrupted.  \"Of course, I want to go if it must be.  I am ready to do what I can for my country in whatever way I may.\"  \"I knew it,\" said Hal; \"I was only fooling.  Come, we will acquaint McKenzie with his work.  And if he comes safely through this, I feel confident he will not remain long in the ranks.\"  The found McKenzie, the erstwhile Canadian sergeant, in his tent.  \"McKenzie,\" said Hal, \"you are about to take a trip, I see.\"  \"That so, sir?  I hadn't heard of it.\"  \"Yes,\" Hal continued.  \"I heard a man say you were about to go to Germany.\"  \"And the man,\" said McKenzie, \"was--\"  \"General Pershing, McKenzie.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" said McKenzie, to whom the few words told the story of important work to be done.  \"In that event, I presume that General Pershing has seen fit to allow me leave of absence.\"  \"He has, McKenzie.  I shall present the order to Captain O'Neill at once.  In the meantime, see that your guns are cleaned, and that you have an extra supply of cartridges.  We may need them. Also, leave any papers or other marks of identification behind.  When you are ready, come to my quarters.\"  \"I shall be there in half an hour, sir.\"  Hal and Chester made their way to Captain O'Neill's quarters.  Hal presented the papers, granting leaves of absence to the three.  \"Hm-m,\" muttered Captain O'Neill.  \"Something up, eh?  Well, I wish I were going with you.\"  He extended a hand.  \"Good luck,\" he said quietly.      CHAPTER IV  INTO GERMANY  \"We'll have to have a leader for this party,\" said Hal, \"one whose word shall be law.  I'm agreeable to Chester.\"  \"I'd rather have you,\" said Chester.  McKenzie also voted for Hal, who already had done him some service. This agreement, stood.  \"All right,\" said Hal.  \"Now that I'm in command, I'll outline the course of procedure.  We'll go from here to the Dutch border.\"  \"How about passports?\" Chester wanted to know.  \"That's simple enough.  You remember the time when we drew up a set of fake passports representing ourselves to be correspondents of the New York Gazette?  We'll follow the same plan, except that we each will be represented as correspondents of different papers.  See, I've already drawn, them.\"  \"I see,\" said Chester, \"but American passports won't be honored in Germany now.\"  \"But they will be in Holland,\" said Hal.  \"We'll see what can be done about having them changed there.  Now, let's see if we know who we are.\"  He passed the fake passports to the others.  \"I'm Barney McCann, eh?\" said McKenzie, gazing at the paper he held in his hand.  \"Oh, well, I guess I can talk Irish as well as German if I have to.  And I represent the Chicago Mail.\"  \"I'm still Chester Crawford,\" said Chester, \"and I represent the New York Gazette.\"  \"I'm Hal Paine, and I represent the Philadelphia Globe,\" said Hal. \"We'll probably have to change our names when we go over the German border, but these should answer their purposes in Holland. Fortunately, we have learned a few things from Stubbs, so we are not unfamiliar with the workings of a newspaper.\"  \"Guess we had better get out of these uniforms,\" said Chester.  \"Right.  We'll don suits of plain khaki, such as Stubbs wears, and we'll equip ourselves with the necessary paraphernalia.\"  This was a simple task, and several hours later, horseback, the lads made their way toward where British troops, supported by French, were close to, the border of The Netherlands.  They showed their passports, prepared by Hal, to the British military authorities, and were permitted to pass.  Holland, although not a participant in the great war, nevertheless, soon after the outbreak of hostilities, had felt herself called upon to mobilize her military forces that she might protect her borders should one of the belligerents attempt to overrun her, as the Germans had overrun Belgium at the outbreak of the war.  Therefore, when the three travelers reached the border, they were held up by the military.  Hal presented his fake American passport, and Chester and McKenzie did likewise.  The officer who had accosted them turned them over to his superior.  \"Your intentions,\" said the officer, \"I hope are such as not to break Holland's neutrality?\"  \"We're perfectly peaceable, sir,\" returned Hal with a smile.  \"Very well.  This is a neutral country, and you are, of course, free to travel about it at your leisure so long as you conduct yourselves properly.  Of course, were you American soldiers it would be necessary for me to place you under arrest, and YOU would be interned until the end of the war.\"  \"I understand that, sir,\" said Hal.  \"By the way,\" said the Dutch officer, \"there is a Dutch newspaperman here at this moment.  Perhaps you would like to meet him.  He is Herr Heindrick Block, of the Amsterdamer.\"  \"We shall be pleased,\" said Hal quietly.  The Dutch officer excused himself, and returned a moment later with a young Dutchman, whom he introduced to the three friends.  They shook hands all around.  \"I've already met a compatriot of yours,\" said the young Dutchman, smiling, \"a Herr Stubbs.  He is with one of the New York papers--I forget which.\"  Hal and Chester gave a start of surprise, but quickly recovered themselves.  \"He is with my paper, The Gazette, sir,\" returned Chester.  \"Is he in these parts?\"  \"He was yesterday,\" replied Block.  \"I do not know where he is now.\"  The three friends took an instant liking to the young Dutch newspaper man.  He led the three to where he was temporarily quartered.  \"We can have a little chat here,\" he said.  During the course of the conversation Hal asked:  \"And what is the sentiment in Holland regarding the war?\"  The young Dutchman hesitated a moment, and then turned and gazed around quickly.  \"The sentiment,\" he said at last, \"is that Germany must be crushed.  Of course, at this moment Holland cannot afford to enter the arena. Germany has massed thousands of troops upon our border.  An unneutral act would be dangerous.  Nevertheless, Holland's sympathies are with the Allies--have been from the start.  There is another factor besides Holland's natural gratitude to England--that makes for this. Germany has overrun Holland, as well as the rest of the world with spies.  Holland is offended, but cannot afford to show it--now.  But while we are kept quiet, there are few of us who would not do much to help the Allied cause.\"  Hal thought quickly.  He glanced at the young Dutchman shrewdly.  He felt he could be trusted.  \"Then,\" said the lad quietly, \"can you conceive of any way by which we can get passports from the Dutch government that will pass us into Germany?\"  The young Dutchman manifested no surprise.  \"Have no fear,\" he said, as Chester and McKenzie manifested some anxiety at Hal's words.  \"I shall not betray you.  Only yesterday I was able to get a passport for your friend Herr Stubbs.\"  \"What?\" cried Hal.  \"Stubbs gone into"]]]
