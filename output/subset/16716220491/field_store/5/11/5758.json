They wrote at once. The funeral is to take place to-morrow afternoon, at three o'clock.”  “Uncle Herbert was rich, wasn't he, mother?”  “Yes, he must have left nearly a hundred thousand dollars.”  “What a pile of money!” said Herbert. “I wonder how a man feels when he is so rich. He ought to be happy.”  “Riches don't always bring happiness. Uncle Herbert was disappointed in early life, and that seemed to spoil his career. He gave himself up to money-making, and succeeded in it; but he lived by himself and had few sources of happiness.”  “Then he had no family?”  “No.”  “Do you think he has left us anything, mother?” asked Herbert, with something of hope in his tone.  “I am afraid not. If he had been disposed to do that he would have done something for us before. He knew that we were poor, and that a little assistance would have been very acceptable. But he never offered it. Even when your father was sick for three months, and I wrote to him for a small loan, he refused, saying that we ought to have laid up money to fall back upon at such a time.”  “I don't see how a man can be so unfeeling. If he would only leave us a thousand dollars, how much good it would do us! We could pay up the mortgage on the house, and have something left over. It wouldn't have been much for him to do.”  “Well, we won't think too much about it,” said Mrs. Carter. “It will be wisest, as probably we should be only preparing ourselves for disappointment. Uncle had a right to do what he pleased with his own.”  “Shall you go to the funeral, mother?”  “I don't see how I can,” said Mrs. Carter, slowly. “It is twenty miles off, and I am very busy just now. Still one of us ought to go, if only to show respect to so near a relation. People would talk if we didn't. I think, as you were named for your Uncle Herbert, I will let you go.”  “If you think best, mother. I will walk, and that will save expense.”  “It will be too much for you to take such a walk. You had better ride.”  “No, mother, I am young and strong. I can walk well enough.”  “But it must be twenty miles,” objected his mother.  “The funeral doesn't take place till three o'clock in the afternoon. I will get up bright and early, say at five o'clock. By nine I shall be halfway there.”  “I am afraid it will be too much for you, Herbert,” said Mrs. Carter, irresolutely.  “You don't know how strong I am,” said Herbert; “I shan't get tired so easily as you think.”  “But twenty miles is a long distance.”  “I know that, but I shall take it easy. The stage fare is seventy-five cents, and it's a good way to save it. I wish somebody would offer me seventy-five cents for every twenty miles I would walk. I'd take it up as a profession.”  “I am afraid I could earn little that way. I never was a good walker.”  “You're a woman,” said Herbert, patronizingly. “Women are not expected to be good walkers.”  “Some are. I remember my Aunt Jane would take walks of five and six miles, and think nothing of it.”  “I guess I could match her in walking,” said Herbert, confidently. “Is she alive?”  “No, she died three years since.”  “Perhaps I take after her, then.”  “You don't take after me, I am sure of that. I think, Herbert, you had better take seventy-five cents with you, so that if you get very tired with your walk over, you can come back by stage.”  “All right, mother; I'll take the money, but I shall be sure not to need it.”  “It is best to be prepared for emergencies, Herbert.”  “If I am going to-morrow morning, I must split up enough wood to last you while I am gone.”  “I am afraid you will tire yourself. I think I can get along with what wood there is already split.”  “Oh, don't be afraid for me. You'll see I'll come back as fresh as when I set out. I expect to have a stunning appetite, though.”  “I'll try to cook up enough for you,” said his mother, smiling.  Herbert went out into the wood shed, and went to work with great energy at the wood pile. In the course of an hour he had sawed and split several large baskets full, which he brought in and piled up behind the kitchen stove.  Mrs. Carter could not be expected to feel very deep grief for the death of her uncle. It was now more than six years since they had met. He was a selfish man, wholly wrapped up in the pursuit of wealth. Had he possessed benevolent instincts, he would have offered to do something out of his abundance for his niece, who he knew found it very hard to make both ends meet. But he was a man who was very much averse to parting with his money while he lived. He lived on a tenth of his income, and saved up the rest, though for what end he could not well have told. Since the death of Mr. Carter, whose funeral he had not taken the trouble to attend, though invited, he had not even written to his niece, and she had abstained from making any advances, lest it might be thought that she was seeking assistance. Under these circumstances she had little hope of a legacy, though she could not help admitting the thought of how much a few hundred dollars would help her, bridging over the time till Herbert should be old enough to earn fair wages in some employment. If he could study two or three years longer, she would have been very glad, for her son had already shown abilities of no common order; but that was hardly to be thought of.  “There, mother, I guess I've sawed wood enough to last you, unless you are very extravagant,” said Herbert, reentering the kitchen, and taking off his cap. “Now is there anything else I can do? You know I shall be gone two days, or a day and a half at any rate.”  “I think of nothing, Herbert. You had better go to bed early, and get a good night's rest, for you will have a hard day before you.”  “So I will, but eight o'clock will be soon enough. Just suppose we should get a legacy, after all, mother. Wouldn't it be jolly?”  “I wouldn't think too much of it, Herbert. There isn't much chance of it. Besides, it doesn't seem right to be speculating about our own personal advantage when Uncle Herbert lies dead in his house.”  There was justice in this suggestion, but Herbert could hardly be expected to take a mournful view of the death of a relative whom he hardly remembered, and who had appeared scarcely to be aware of his existence. It was natural that the thought of his wealth should be uppermost in his young nephew's mind. The reader will hardly be surprised to hear that Herbert, knowing only too well the disadvantages of poverty, should have speculated a little about his uncle's property after he went to bed. Indeed, it did not leave him even with his waking consciousness. He dreamed that his uncle left him a big lump of gold, so big and heavy that he could not lift it. He was considering anxiously how in the world he was going to get it home, when all at once he awoke, and heard the church clock strike five.  “Time I was on my way!” he thought, and, jumping out of bed, he dressed himself as quickly as possible, and went downstairs. But, early as it was, his mother, was down before him. There was a fire in the kitchen stove, and the cloth was laid for breakfast.  “What made you get up so early, mother?” asked Herbert.  “I wouldn't have you go away without breakfast, Herbert, especially for such a long walk.”  “I meant to take something from the closet. That would have done well enough.”  “You will be all the better for a good, warm cup of tea. Sit right down. It is all ready.”  Early as it was, the breakfast tasted good. Herbert ate hastily, for he was anxious to be on his way. Knowing that he could not afford to buy lunch, he put the remnants of the breakfast, including some slices of bread and butter and meat, into his satchel, and started on his long walk.     CHAPTER III  HERBERT MEETS A RELATIVE   Herbert had never been to Randolph. In fact, he had never been so far away from Wrayburn. He was not afraid of losing his way, however. Here and there along the road guideposts were conveniently placed, and these removed any difficulty on that score.  When he had gone about six miles, the coach rattled by. It had started more than an hour later. Herbert turned out for the lumbering vehicle, and waited for it to pass. There was a boy on top, but such was the cloud of dust that he could not at first recognize him. It happened, however, that one of the traces broke, so that the driver was compelled to make a stop just as he overtook our hero. Then he saw that the boy on top was James Leech.  With James curiosity overcame his disinclination to speak to one so far beneath him.  “Where are you going. Carter?” he inquired.  “To Randolph,” was the answer.  “Going to walk all the way?”  “I expect to,” said Herbert, not relishing the cross-examination.  “Why don't you ride?”  James did not ask for information. He knew well enough already, but as there are purse-proud men, so there are boys who are actuated by feelings equally unworthy, and it delighted him to remind Herbert of his poverty. Herbert divined this, but he was proud in his way, and answered: “Because I choose.”  “Well, you must like the dust, that's all,” said James, complacently tapping his well-polished boot with a light cane which he had bought.  “Where are you going?” asked Herbert, thinking it about time for him to commence questioning.  “I'm going to Randolph, too,” answered James, with unwonted affability. “I'm going to stop a few days with a friend of mine, Tom Spencer. His father's a rich man--got a nice place there. Didn't you ever hear of Mr. Spencer, the lawyer?”  “I don't think I have.”  “That's his father. He makes a load of money by his law business. I think I shall study law some time. Perhaps I'll go into partnership with him. What are you going to be?”  “I don't know yet,” said Herbert.  “I suppose you'll be a mechanic of some kind--a carpenter,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6162"],["title","Herbert Carter's Legacy; Or, the Inventor's Son (#2)"],["body"," or mason, or bricklayer.”  “Perhaps so,” said Herbert, quietly.  “What are you going to Randolph for?” asked James, with sudden curiosity.  “To attend my uncle's funeral.”  “What's your uncle's name?”  “The same as mine.”  “I suppose he was poor.”  “No, he was rich.”  “Was he?” repeated James, in some surprise. “What do you think he was worth?”  “About a hundred thousand dollars.”  “Sho! you don't say so. Perhaps,” continued James, with new-born respect, “he has left you something in his will.”  “I don't think so.”  “Why not?”  “He hasn't shown any interest in us for six years, and I don't think he'll remember us now.”  James looked thoughtful. He had never before heard of this relationship, or he would have treated Herbert differently. The mere fact of having a wealthy relative elevated our hero considerably in his eyes. Then, too, there was a possibility that Herbert would turn out a legatee.  “When is your uncle's funeral?” he inquired, after a pause.  “This afternoon.”  “You won't get there in time. You had better get up and ride.”  “No, I guess not.”  “Well, perhaps I shall meet you at Randolph.”  By this time the harness was repaired, the driver resumed his seat, and whipped up the horses to make up for lost time.  “I'm glad I don't think as much of money as James Leech,” thought Herbert. “I suppose if my uncle would only leave us a good round sum, he would forget that I once wore patched pants, and accept me as his intimate friend.”  This was exactly what James would have done, and Herbert showed that he was not wholly without knowledge of the world in forming the conjecture.  Pausing occasionally to rest, Herbert at length accomplished his journey, arriving at Randolph a little after noon. He stopped just outside the village and ate his frugal dinner, which by this time he was prepared to relish. He then took off his jacket and beat the dust out of it, dusted his shoes, and washed his face in a little brook by the roadside. Having thus effaced the marks of travel, he entered the village and inquired the way to the residence of his late uncle. He found out where it was, but did not go there yet, knowing that there would be preparations going on for the funeral. Neither did he go to the tavern, for he knew that he would be expected to dine there, and this was an expense which he did not feel able to incur. He threw himself down in the shade of a tree, and remained there until after he heard the church clock strike two. He was still lying there when a young man, smartly dressed, sporting a showy watch chain and locket and an immense necktie, came up the street and accosted him.  “I say, boy, can you tell me where old man Carter's house is?”  “Yes,” said Herbert. “Do you want to go there?”  “Of course I do. I'm one of the relatives. I've come all the way from New York to attend the funeral.”  “I'm one of the relations, too,” said Herbert. “We'll go along together.”  “By Jove, that's strange! How are you related to the old chap?” drawled the young man.  “He was my mother's uncle.”  “Was he? Well, I'm a second or third cousin, I don't know which. Never saw him to my knowledge. In fact, I wouldn't have come on to the funeral if I hadn't heard that he was rich. Expect to be remembered?”  “I don't think so. He hasn't taken any notice of mother or myself for years.”  “Indeed!” said the young man, who was rather pleased to hear this intelligence. “Are there many relations, do you know?”  “I don't think there are.”  “That's good. It makes our chance better, you know. I say, what's your name?”  “Herbert Carter.”  “Same as the old man's?”  “Yes.”  “Did he know you was named for him?”  “Of course.”  “Then he may leave you something for the name,” suggested the other, not very well pleased.  “I don't expect anything. What is your name?”  “Cornelius Dixon. I'm related to the old man on my mother's side.”  “Are you in business in New York?” asked Herbert, who, in spite of the queer manners of his new relative, felt considerable respect for one who hailed from so important a city.  “Yes, I'm a salesman in a New York store. Where do you live?”  “In Wrayburn.”  “Where's that?”  “About twenty miles from here.”  “Some one-horse country town, I suppose. Are you in any business?”  “No,” said Herbert, “but I'd like to be. Do you think you could get me a place in New York?”  “Well,” said Cornelius, flattered by the belief in his influence which this inquiry implied, “perhaps I might. You can give me your name and address, so I can write to you if I hear of anything. If the old man only leaves me a few thousand dollars, I'll go into business for myself, and then I'd have an opening for you.”  “I hope he will, then.”  “So do I. That is where we both agree. But perhaps it will be you that will get the cash.”  “I don't think so.”  “If you do, put it into my hands, and go into partnership with me. I've got business experience, you know; while you're green, countrified, you know. It would never do for you to start alone.”  “No, I shouldn't think of it.”  “Then it's agreed, is it?” said Cornelius. “If I get a legacy, I'll take you into my store. If you get it, you will go into partnership with me.”  “I'm willing,” said Herbert, who really believed that his companion had as valuable business qualifications as he claimed. How was he to know that the pretentious Cornelius was only a salesman, at twelve dollars a week, in a dry-goods store on Eighth Avenue?  By this time they had reached the rather dingy-looking house of their deceased relative. The front door was open. They passed through the gate, and, entering, took their places with the mourners.     CHAPTER IV  READING THE WILL   Apparently the deceased had but few relatives. But six persons were in a small room appropriated to the mourners when our hero and his new acquaintance entered. One of these, and far the most imposing in appearance, was a stout lady, who quite filled up the only armchair in the room. In a plain chair close by was a meek little man, three inches shorter, and probably not more than half her weight. A boy and girl, the children of the ill-matched pair, the former resembling the father, the latter the mother, were ranged alongside. Permit me to introduce Mr. and Mrs. Josiah Pinkerton, of Castleton, an adjoining town. Master Albert and Miss Nancy Pinkerton.  Mrs. Pinkerton is a milliner, and her husband is her clerk and errand boy. She has considerable business capacity, and makes enough to support the family comfortably, besides adding something annually to the fund in the savings bank. The relationship to the deceased is on the side of the husband, who is a cousin. This relationship has given rise to great expectations on the part of Mrs. Pinkerton, who fully expects to inherit half the estate of Mr. Carter.  “If we get it, Josiah,” she has promised magnificently, “I'll buy you a new suit of clothes.”  “But, Maria,” expostulated the meek husband, “it will be left to me, not to you.”  “Why so?” demanded she, frowning.  “Because he is my cousin, not yours.”  “You indeed!” retorted the wife, angrily; “and what do you know about the use of money? Who supports the family, I should like to know?”  “I help,” answered Josiah, meekly.  “And precious little you help,” returned his wife, sarcastically. “So far as you are concerned, we should all be in the poor house long before this. No, Josiah, the money must come into my hands. I'll give you a good allowance, and hire an errand boy so that you needn't have to carry round bundles. You ought to be contented with that.”  As no legacy had yet been received, Mr. Pinkerton thought it best not to continue the discussion. Indeed, he was rather afraid of his imperious wife, who held the reins of authority, and whom he did not dare to dispute.  The two other relations were, first, a brown-faced and brown-handed farmer, Alonzo Granger, and an old lady, of seventy or thereabouts--Miss Nancy Carter, a sister of the deceased. For years she had lived on a small pension from her brother, increased somewhat by knitting stockings for the neighbors. She, indeed, was the only real mourner. The rest were speculating about how far they were likely to be benefited by the death of the deceased, of whom they had seen but little in life. Even Herbert, though impressed by the presence of death, could hardly be expected to feel deep grief for a man who had neglected his mother in his life.  Of the funeral rites it is unnecessary to speak. We are interested in what came afterwards.  The relations were quietly notified to meet at five o'clock in the office of Mr. Spencer, the lawyer, to whom had been intrusted the will of the late Mr. Carter. Those who have even a slight knowledge of human nature will not need to be told that the attendance of all was punctual. There was an anxious, expectant look on the faces of all--not even excepting the old lady. She knew that if her brother had made no provision for her, she must go to the alms-house, and against this her honest pride revolted. She was willing to live on anything, however little, if she might live independently, as she had hitherto done. To feel herself dependent on public charity would indeed have been a hard trial for the poor old lady. Of all, probably Mrs. Pinkerton was the most confident. She had come to feel that her family was entitled to a large share of the estate, and she had gone so far as to decide just how she would invest it, and what new arrangements she would make, for she had no idea of consulting her husband on the subject.  The lawyer was a gentlemanly-looking man, whose face inspired confidence in his integrity--a remark which, unhappily, cannot be made of all in his profession. He took his seat at a table, and produced the will, which he considerately commenced reading at once. After the usual introduction, the will proceeded thus:  “To my sister Nancy I give the use of my house, rent free, as long as she shall live. I leave her also an income of two hundred dollars a"]]]
