In fact, I was goin' to lend out the money to a neighbor for a month at one per cent; but I'd just as lieve let your father have it at that price.”  “Isn't that more than legal interest?” asked Grant.  “Well, you see, money is worth good interest nowadays. Ef your father don't want it, no matter. I can let the other man have it.”  Grant rapidly calculated that the interest would only amount to fifty cents, and money must be had.  “I think father'll agree to your terms,” he said. “I'll let you know this afternoon.”  “All right, Grant. It don't make a mite of difference to me, but if your father wants the money he'll have to speak for it to-day.”  “I'll see that the matter is attended to,” said Grant, and he went on his way, pleased with the prospect of obtaining money for their impoverished household, even on such hard terms.  Next he made his way to Mr. Tudor's store.  It was one of those country variety stores where almost everything in the way of house supplies can be obtained, from groceries to dry goods.  Mr. Tudor was a small man, with a parchment skin and insignificant features. He was in the act of weighing out a quantity of sugar for a customer when Grant entered.  Grant waited till the shopkeeper was at leisure.  “Did you want to see me, Grant?” said Tudor.  “Yes, Mr. Tudor. You sent over a bill to our house this morning.”  “And you've come to pay it. That's right. Money's tight, and I've got bills to pay in the city.”  “I've got a little money for you on account,” said Grant, watching Tudor's face anxiously.  “How much?” asked the storekeeper, his countenance changing.  “Eight dollars.”  “Eight dollars!” ejaculated Tudor, indignantly. “Only eight dollars out of sixty-seven! That's a regular imposition, and I don't care ef your father is a minister, I stick to my words.”  Grant was angry, but he remembered his mother's injunction to restrain his temper.  “We'd like to pay the whole, Mr. Tudor, if we had the money, and--”  “Do you think I can trust the whole neighborhood, and only get one dollar in ten of what's due me?” spluttered Mr. Tudor. “Ministers ought to set a better example.”  “Ministers ought to get better pay,” said Grant.  “There's plenty don't get as much as your father. When do you expect to pay the rest, I'd like to know? I s'pose you expect me to go on trustin', and mebbe six months from now you'll pay me another eight dollars,” said the storekeeper, with withering sarcasm.  “I was going to tell you, if you hadn't interrupted me,” said Grant, “that we should probably have some more money for you to-morrow.”  “How much?”  “Twenty-five dollars,” answered the boy, knowing that part of the money borrowed must go in other quarters. “Will that be satisfactory?”  “That's more like!” said Tudor, calming down. “Ef you'll pay that I'll give you a leetle more time on the rest. Do you want anything this mornin'? I've got some prime butter just come in.”  “I'll call for some articles this afternoon, Mr. Tudor. Here are the eight dollars. Please credit us with that sum.”  “Well, I've accomplished something,” said Grant to himself as he plodded homeward.    CHAPTER III -- GRANT WALKS TO SOMERSET    GODFREY THORNTON, Grant's uncle, lived in the neighboring town of Somerset. He was an old bachelor, three years older than his brother, the minister, and followed the profession of a lawyer. His business was not large, but his habits were frugal, and he had managed to save up ten thousand dollars. Grant had always been a favorite with him, and having no son of his own he had formed the plan of sending him to college. He was ambitious that he should be a professional man.  It might have been supposed that he would have felt disposed to assist his brother, whose scanty salary he knew was inadequate to the needs of a family. But Godfrey Thornton was an obstinate man, and chose to give assistance in his own way, and no other. It would be a very handsome thing, he thought, to give his nephew a college education. And so, indeed, it would. But he forgot one thing. In families of limited means, when a boy reaches the age of fifteen or sixteen he is very properly expected to earn something toward the family income, and this Grant could not do while preparing for college. If his uncle could have made up his mind to give his brother a small sum annually to make up for this, all would have been well. Not that this idea had suggested itself to the Rev. John Thorn-ton. He felt grateful for his brother's intentions toward Grant, and had bright hopes of his boy's future. But, in truth, pecuniary troubles affected him less than his wife. She was the manager, and it was for her to contrive and be anxious.  After Grant had arranged the matters referred to in the preceding chapter, he told his mother that he proposed to go to Somerset to call on his uncle.  “No, Grant, I don't object, though I should be sorry to have you lose the chance of an education.”  “I have a very fair education already, mother. Of course I should like to go to college, but I can't bear to have you and father struggling with poverty. If I become a business man, I may have a better chance to help you. At any rate, I can help you sooner. If I can only induce Uncle Godfrey to give you the sum my education would cost him, I shall feel perfectly easy.”  “You can make the attempt, my son, but I have doubts about your success.”  Grant, however, was more hopeful. He didn't see why his uncle should object, and it would cost him no more money. It seemed to him very plain sailing, and he set out to walk to Somerset, full of courage and hope.  It was a pretty direct road, and the distance--five miles--was not formidable to a strong-limbed boy like Grant. In an hour and a half he entered the village, and soon reached the small one-story building which served his uncle as an office.  Entering, he saw his uncle busy with some papers at his desk.  The old lawyer raised his eyes as the door opened.  “So it's you, Grant, is it?” he said. “Nobody sick at home, eh?”  “No, Uncle Godfrey, we are all well.”  “I was afraid some one might be sick, from your coming over. However, I suppose you have some errand in Somerset.”  “My only errand is to call upon you, uncle.”  “I suppose I am to consider that a compliment,” said the old bachelor, not ill pleased. “Well, and when are you going to be ready for college?”  “I can be ready to enter in September,” replied Grant.  “That is good. All you will have to do will be to present yourself for examination. I shall see you through, as I have promised.”  “You are very kind, Uncle Godfrey,” said Grant; and then he hesitated.  “It's Thornton family pride, Grant. I want my nephew to be somebody. I want you to be a professional man, and take a prominent place in the world.”  “Can't I be somebody without becoming a professional man, or---”  “Or, what?” asked his uncle, abruptly.  “Getting a college education?” continued Grant.  “What does this mean?” asked the old lawyer, knitting his brow. “You're not getting off the notion of going to college, I hope?”  “I should like to go to college, uncle.”  “I'm glad to hear that,” said Godfrey Thornton, relieved. “I thought you might want to grow up a dunce, and become a bricklayer or something of that kind.”  Somehow Grant's task began to seem more difficult than he had anticipated.  “But,” continued Grant, summoning up his courage, “I am afraid it will be rather selfish.”  “I can't say I understand you, Grant. As long as I am willing to pay your college bills, I don't see why there is anything selfish in your accepting my offer.”  “I mean as regards father and mother.”  “Don't I take you off their hands? What do you mean?”  “I mean this, Uncle Godfrey,” said Grant, boldly, “I ought to be at work earning money to keep them. Father's income is very small, and--”  “You don't mean to say you want to give up going to college?” said Godfrey Thornton, hastily.  “I think I ought to, uncle.”  “Why?”  “So that I can find work and help father along. You see, I should be four years in college, and three years studying a profession, and all that time my brother and sister would be growing older and more expensive, and father would be getting into debt.”  Uncle Godfrey's brow wore a perceptible frown.  “Tell me who has put this idea into your head?” he said. “I am sure it isn't your father.”  “No one put it into my head, Uncle Godfrey. It's my own idea.”  “Humph! old heads don't grow on young shoulders, evidently. You are a foolish boy, Grant. With a liberal education you can do something for your family.”  “But it is so long to wait,” objected Grant.  “It will be a great disappointment to me to have you give up going to college, but of course I can't force you to go,” said his uncle, coldly. “It will save me three hundred dollars a year for four years-I may say for seven, however. You will be throwing away a grand opportunity.”  “Don't think I undervalue the advantage of a college training, uncle,” said Grant, eagerly. “It isn't that. It's because I thought I might help father. In fact, I wanted to make a proposal to you.”  “What is it?”  “You say it will cost three hundred dollars a year to keep me in college?”  “Well?”  “Would you be willing to give father two hundred a year for the next four years, and let me take care of myself in some business place?”  “So this is your proposal, is it?”  “Yes, sir.”  “All I have got to say is, that you have got uncommon assurance. You"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5833"],["title","Helping Himself; Or, Grant Thornton's Ambition (#2)"],["body","to defeat my cherished plan, and want me to pay two hundred dollars a year in acknowledgment of your consideration.”  “I am sorry you look upon it in that light, Uncle Godfrey.”  “I distinctly decline your proposal. If you refuse to go to college, I wash my hands of you and your family. Do you understand that?”  “Yes, Uncle Godfrey,” answered Grant, crestfallen.  “Go home and think over the matter. My offer still holds good. You can present yourself at college in September, and, if you are admitted, notify me.”  The lawyer turned back to his writing, and Grant understood that the interview was over.  In sadness he started on his return walk from Somerset. He had accomplished nothing except to make his uncle angry. He could not make up his mind what to do.  He had walked about four miles when his attention was sharply drawn by a cry of terror. Looking up quickly, he saw a girl of fourteen flying along the road pursued by a drunken man armed with a big club. They were not more than thirty feet apart, and the situation was critical.  Grant was no coward, and he instantly resolved to rescue the girl if it were a possible thing.    CHAPTER IV -- A TIMELY RESCUE    “I will save her if I can,” said Grant to himself.  The task, however, was not an easy one. The drunken man was tall and strongly made, and his condition did not appear to interfere with his locomotion. He was evidently half crazed with drink, and his pursuit of the young girl arose probably from a blind impulse; but it was likely to be none the less serious for her. Grant saw at once that he was far from being a match for the drunkard in physical strength. If he had been timid, a regard for his personal safety would have led him to keep aloof. But he would have despised himself if he had not done what he could for the girl--stranger though she was--who was in such peril.  It chanced that Grant had cut a stout stick to help him on his way. This suggested his plan of campaign. He ran sideways toward the pursuer, and thrust his stick between his legs, tripping him up. The man fell violently forward, and lay as if stunned, breathing heavily. Grant was alarmed at first, fearing that he might be seriously hurt, but a glance assured him that his stupor was chiefly the result of his potations.  Then he hurried to overtake the girl, who, seeing what had taken place, had paused in her flight.  “Don't be frightened,” said Grant. “The man can't get up at present. I will see you home if you will tell me where you live.”  “I am boarding at Mrs. Granger's, quarter of a mile back, mamma and I,” answered the girl, the color, temporarily banished by fright, returning to her cheeks.  “Where did you fall in with this man?” inquired Grant.  “I was taking a walk,” answered the girl, “and overtook him. I did not take much notice of him at first, and was not aware of his condition till he began to run after me. Then I was almost frightened to death, and I don't think I ever ran so fast in my life.”  “You were in serious danger. He was fast overtaking you.”  “I saw that he was, and I believe I should have dropped if you had not come up and saved me. How brave you were!”  Grant colored with pleasure, though he disclaimed the praise.  “Oh, it was nothing!” he said, modestly. “But we had better start at once, for he may revive.”  “Oh, let us go then,” exclaimed the girl in terror, and, hardly knowing what she did, she seized Grant's arm. “See, he is beginning to stir. Do come quickly!”  Clinging to Grant's arm, the two hastened away, leaving the inebriate on the ground.  Grant now had leisure to view more closely the girl he had rescued. She was a very pretty girl, a year or two younger than himself, with a bright, vivacious manner, and her young rescuer thought her very attractive.  “Do you live round here?” she asked.  “I live in Colebrook, the village close by. I was walking from Somerset.”  “I should like to know the name of the one who has done me so great a service.”  “We will exchange names, if you like,” said Grant, smiling. “My name is Grant Thornton. I am the son of Rev. John Thornton, who is minister in Colebrook.”  “So you are a minister's son. I have always heard that minister's sons are apt to be wild,” said the girl, smiling mischievously.  “I am an exception,” said Grant, demurely.  “I am ready to believe it,” returned his companion. “My name is Carrie Clifton; my mother is a minister's daughter, so I have a right to think well of ministers' families.”  “How long have you been boarding in this neighborhood, Miss Carrie?”  “Only a week. I am afraid I shan't dare to stay here any longer.”  “It is not often you would meet with such an adventure as this. I hope you won't allow it to frighten you away.”  “Do you know that drunken man? Does he live nearby?”  “I think he is a stranger--a tramp. I never saw him before, and I know almost everybody who lives about here.”  “I am glad he doesn't live here.”  “He will probably push on his way and not come this way again during the summer.”  “I hope you are right. He might try to revenge himself on you for tripping him up.”  “I don't think he saw me to recognize me. He was so drunk that he didn't know what he was about. When he gets over his intoxication he probably won't remember anything that has happened.”  By this time they had reached the gate of the farmhouse where Carrie was boarding, and Grant prepared to leave her.  “I think you are safe now,” he said.  “Oh, but I shan't let you go yet,” said the girl. “You must come in and see mother.”  Grant hesitated, but he felt that he should like to meet the mother of a young lady who seemed to him so attractive, and he allowed himself to be led into the yard. Mrs. Clifton was sitting in a rustic chair under a tree behind the house. There Grant and his companion found her. Carrie poured forth her story impetuously, and then drawing Grant forward, indicated him as her rescuer.  Her mother listened with natural alarm, shuddering at the peril from which her daughter had so happily escaped.  “I cannot tell how grateful I am to you for the service you have done my daughter,” she said, warmly. “You are a very brave boy. There is not one in ten who would have had the courage to act as you did.”  “You praise me more than I deserve, Mrs. Clifton. I saw the man was drunk, and I did not really run much risk in what I did. I am very thankful that I was able to be of service to Miss Carrie.”  “It is most fortunate that you were at hand. My daughter might have been killed.”  “What do you think, mother? He is a minister's son,” said Carrie, vivaciously.  “That certainly is no objection in my eyes,” said Mrs. Clifton, smiling, “for I am a minister's daughter. Where does your father preach?”  “His church is only a mile distant, in the village.”  “I shall hear him, then, next Sunday. Last Sunday Carrie and I were both tired, and remained at home, but I have always been accustomed to go to church somewhere.”  “Papa will be here next Sunday,” said Carrie. “He can only come Saturday night on account of his business.”  “Does he do business in New York?” asked Grant.  “Yes; his store is on Broadway.”  “We live on Madison Avenue, and whenever you are in the city we shall be very glad to have you call,” said Mrs. Clifton, graciously.  “Thank you; I should like to call very much,” answered Grant, who was quite sincere in what he said. “But I don't often go to New York.”  “Perhaps you will get a place there some time,” suggested Carrie.  “I should like to,” replied Grant.  “Then your father does not propose to send you to college?” It was Mrs. Clifton who said this.  “He wishes me to go, but I think I ought to go to work to help him. He has two other children besides me.”  “Is either one a girl?” asked Carrie.  “Yes; I have a sister of thirteen, named Mary.”  “I wish you would bring her here to see me,” said Carrie. “I haven't got acquainted with any girls yet.”  Mrs. Clifton seconded the invitation, and Grant promised that he would do so. In fact, he was pleased at the opportunity it would give him of improving his acquaintance with the young lady from New York. He returned home very well pleased with his trip to Somerset, though he had failed in the object of his expedition.    CHAPTER V -- MRS. THORNTON'S PEARLS    The next Sunday Mrs. Clifton and her daughter appeared at church, and Grant had the pleasure of greeting them. He was invited with his sister to take supper with them on the next Monday afternoon, and accepted the invitation. About sunset he met his new friends walking, with the addition of the husband and father, who, coming Saturday evening from New York, had felt too fatigued to attend church. Mr. Clifton, to whom he was introduced, was a portly man in middle life, who received Grant quite graciously, and made for himself acknowledgment of the service which our hero had rendered his daughter.  “If I ever have the opportunity of doing you a favor, Master Thornton, you may call upon me with confidence,” he said.  Grant thanked him, and was better pleased than if he had received an immediate gift.  Meanwhile Deacon Gridley kept his promise, and advanced the minister fifty dollars, deducting a month's interest. Even with this deduction Mrs. Thornton was very glad to obtain the money. Part of it was paid on account to Mr. Tudor, and silenced his importunities for a time. As to his own plans, there was nothing for Grant to do except to continue his studies, as he might enter college after all.  If any employment should offer of a remunerative character, he felt that it would be his duty to accept it, in spite of his uncle's objections; but such chances were not very likely to happen while he remained in the country, for obvious reasons.  Three weeks passed, and again not only Mr. Tudor, but another creditor, began to be troublesome.  “How soon is your father going to pay up his bill?” asked Tudor, when Grant called at the store for a gallon of molasses.  “Very soon, I hope,” faltered Grant.
