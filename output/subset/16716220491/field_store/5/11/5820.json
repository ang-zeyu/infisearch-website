It pained him much to perceive that one who had always been considered a frank, true-hearted young man, and who left the forest to fight in defense of his king, was now turned a traitor, and had joined the ranks of the enemy; and Jacob thought how much better it had been for James Southwold, if he had never quitted the New Forest, and had not been corrupted by evil company; \"he was a good lad,\" thought Jacob, \"and now he is a traitor and a hypocrite.\"  \"If born and bred in this forest, James Southwold,\" said the leader of the troop, \"you must fain know all its mazes and paths. Now, call to mind, are there no secret hiding-places in which people may remain concealed; no thickets which may cover both man and horse? Peradventure thou mayest point out the very spot where this man Charles may be hidden?\"  \"I do know one dell, within a mile of Arnwood,\" replied James Southwold, \"which might cover double our troop from the eyes of the most wary.\"  \"We will ride there, then,\" replied the leader. \"Arnwood, sayest thou? is not that the property of the Malignant Cavalier Beverley, who was shot down at Naseby?\"  \"Even so,\" replied Southwold; \"and many is the time--that is, in the olden time, before I was regenerated--many is the day of revelry that I have passed there; many the cup of good ale that I have quaffed.\"  \"And thou shalt quaff it again,\" replied the leader. \"Good ale was not intended only for Malignants, but for those who serve diligently. After we have examined the dell which thou speakest of, we will direct our horses' heads toward Arnwood.\"  \"Who knows but what the man Charles may be concealed in the Malignant's house?\" observed another.  \"In the day I should say no,\" replied the leader; \"but in the night the Cavaliers like to have a roof over their heads; and, therefore, at night, and not before, will we proceed thither.\"  \"I have searched many of their abodes,\" observed another, \"but search is almost in vain. What with their spring panels, and secret doors, their false ceilings, and double walls, one may ferret forever, and find nothing.\"  \"Yes,\" replied the leader, \"their abodes are full of these popish abominations; but there is one way which is sure; and if the man Charles be concealed in any house, I venture to say that I will find him. Fire and smoke will bring him forth; and to every Malignant's house within twenty miles will I apply the torch; but it must be at night, for we are not sure of his being housed during the day. James Southwold, thou knowest well the mansion of Arnwood?\"  \"I know well my way to all the offices below--the buttery, the cellar, and the kitchen; but I can not say that I have ever been into the apartments of the upper house.\"  \"That it needeth not; if thou canst direct us to the lower entrance it will be sufficient.\"  \"That can I, Master Ingram,\" replied Southwold, \"and to where the best ale used to be found.\"  \"Enough, Southwold, enough; our work must be done, and diligently. Now, my men, tighten your girths; we will just ride to the dell: if it conceals not whom we seek, it shall conceal us till night, and then the country shall be lighted up with the flames of Arnwood, while we surround the house and prevent escape. Levelers, to horse!\"  The troopers sprung upon their saddles, and went off at a hard trot, Southwold leading the way. Jacob remained among the fern until they were out of sight, and then rose up. He looked for a short time in the direction in which the troopers had gone, stooped down again to take up his gun, and then said, \"There's providence in this; yes, and there's providence in my not having my dog with me, for he would not have remained quiet for so long a time. Who would ever have thought that James Southwold would have turned a traitor! more than traitor, for he is now ready to bite the hand that has fed him, to burn the house that has ever welcomed him. This is a bad world, and I thank Heaven that I have lived in the woods. But there is no time to lose;\" and the old forester threw his gun over his shoulder, and hastened away in the direction of his own cottage.  \"And so the king has escaped,\" thought Jacob, as he went along, \"and he may be in the forest! Who knows but he may be at Arnwood, for he must hardly know where to go for shelter? I must haste and see Miss Judith immediately. 'Levelers, to horse!' the fellow said. What's a Leveler?\" thought Jacob.  As perhaps my readers may ask the same question, they must know that a large proportion of the Parliamentary army had at this time assumed the name of Levelers, in consequence of having taken up the opinion that every man should be on an equality, and property should be equally divided. The hatred of these people to any one above them in rank or property, especially toward those of the king's party, which mostly consisted of men of rank and property, was unbounded, and they were merciless and cruel to the highest degree, throwing off much of that fanatical bearing and language which had before distinguished the Puritans. Cromwell had great difficulty in eventually putting them down, which he did at last accomplish by hanging and slaughtering many. Of this Jacob knew nothing; all he knew was, that Arnwood was to be burned down that night, and that it would be necessary to remove the family. As for obtaining assistance to oppose the troopers, that he knew to be impossible. As he thought of what must take place, he thanked God for having allowed him to gain the knowledge of what was to happen, and hastened on his way. He had been about eight miles from Arnwood when he had concealed himself in the fern. Jacob first went to his cottage to deposit his gun, saddled his forest pony, and set off for Arnwood. In less than two hours the old man was at the door of the mansion; it was then about three o'clock in the afternoon, and being in the month of November, there was not so much as two hours of daylight remaining. \"I shall have a difficult job with the stiff old lady,\" thought Jacob, as be rung the bell; \"I don't believe that she would rise out of her high chair for old Noll and his whole army at his back. But we shall see.\"     CHAPTER II.   Before Jacob is admitted to the presence of Miss Judith Villiers, we must give some account of the establishment at Arnwood. With the exception of one male servant, who officiated in the house and stable as his services might be required, every man of the household of Colonel Beverley had followed the fortunes of their master, and as none had returned, they, in all probability had shared his fate. Three female servants, with the man above mentioned, composed the whole household. Indeed, there was every reason for not increasing the establishment, for the rents were either paid in part, or not paid at all. It was generally supposed that the property, now that the Parliament had gained the day, would be sequestrated, although such was not yet the case; and the tenants were unwilling to pay, to those who were not authorized to receive, the rents which they might be again called upon to make good. Miss Judith Villiers, therefore, found it difficult to maintain the present household; and although she did not tell Jacob Armitage that such was the case, the fact was, that very often the venison which he brought to the mansion was all the meat that was in the larder. The three female servants held the offices of cook, attendant upon Miss Villiers, and housemaid; the children being under the care of no particular servant, and left much to themselves. There had been a chaplain in the house, but he had quitted before the death of Mrs. Beverley, and the vacancy had not been filled up; indeed, it could not well be, for the one who left had not received his salary for many months, and Miss Judith Villiers, expecting every day to be summoned by her relations to bring the children and join them, sat in her high chair waiting for the arrival of this summons, which, from the distracted state of the times, had never come.  As we have before said, the orphans were four in number; the two eldest were boys, and the youngest were girls. Edward, the eldest boy, was between thirteen and fourteen years old; Humphrey, the second, was twelve; Alice, eleven; and Edith, eight. As it is the history of these young persons which we are about to narrate, we shall say little about them at present, except that for many months they had been under little or no restraint, and less attended to. Their companions were Benjamin, the man who remained in the house, and old Jacob Armitage, who passed all the time he could spare with them. Benjamin was rather weak in intellect, and was a source of amusement rather than otherwise. As for the female servants, one was wholly occupied with her attendance on Miss Judith, who was very exacting, and had a high notion of her own consequence. The other two had more than sufficient employment; as, when there is no money to pay with, every thing must be done at home. That, under such circumstances, the boys became boisterous and the little girls became romps, is not to be wondered at: but their having become so was the cause of Miss Judith seldom admitting them into her room. It is true that they were sent for once a day, to ascertain if they were in the house, or in existence, but soon dismissed and left to their own resources. Such was the neglect to which these young orphans was exposed. It must, however, be admitted, that this very neglect made them independent and bold, full of health from constant activity, and more fitted for the change which was so soon to take place.  \"Benjamin,\" said Jacob, as the other came to the door, \"I must speak with the old lady.\"  \"Have you brought any venison, Jacob?\" said Benjamin, grinning, \"else, I reckon, you'll not be over welcome.\"  \"No, I have not; but it is an important business, so send Agatha to her directly.\"  \"I will; and I'll not say any thing about the venison.\"  In a few minutes, Jacob was ushered up by Agatha"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6471"],["title","The Children of the New Forest (#2)"],["body","Miss Judith Villiers's apartment. The old lady was about fifty years of age, very prim and starched, sitting in a high-backed chair, with her feet upon a stool, and her hands crossed before her, her black mittens reposing upon her snow-white apron.  The old forester made his obeisance.  \"You have important business with us, I am told,\" observed Miss Judith.  \"Most important, madam,\" replied Jacob. \"In the first place, it is right that you should be informed that his majesty, King Charles, has escaped from Hampton Court.\"  \"His majesty escaped!\" replied the lady.  \"Yes; and is supposed to be secreted somewhere in this neighborhood. His majesty is not in this house, madam, I presume?\"  \"Jacob, his majesty is not in this house: if he were, I would suffer my tongue to be torn out sooner than I would confess it, even to you.\"  \"But I have more for your private ear, madam.\"  \"Agatha, retire; and Agatha, be mindful that you go down stairs, and do not remain outside the door.\"  Agatha, with this injunction, bounced out of the room, slamming-to the door so as to make Miss Judith start from her seat.  \"Ill-mannered girl!\" exclaimed Miss Judith. \"Now, Jacob Armitage, you may proceed.\"  Jacob then entered into the detail of what he had overheard that morning, when he fell in with the troopers, concluding with the information, that the mansion would be burned down that very night. He then pointed out the necessity of immediately abandoning the house, as it would be impossible to oppose the troopers.  \"And where am I to go to, Jacob?\" said Miss Judith, calmly.  \"I hardly know, madam; there is my cottage; it is but a poor place, and not fit for one like you.\"  \"So I should presume, Jacob Armitage, neither shall I accept your offer. It would ill befit the dignity of a Villiers to be frightened out of her abode by a party of rude soldiers. Happen what will, I shall not stir from this--no, not even from this chair. Neither do I consider the danger so great as you suppose. Let Benjamin saddle, and be prepared to ride over to Lymington immediately. I will give him a letter to the magistrate there, who will send us protection.\"  \"But, madam, the children can not remain here. I will not leave them here. I promised the colonel--\"  \"Will the children be in more danger than I shall be, Jacob Armitage?\" replied the old lady, stiffly. \"They dare not ill-treat me--they may force the buttery and drink the ale--they may make merry with that and the venison which you have brought with you, I presume, but they will hardly venture to insult a lady of the House of Villiers.\"  \"I fear they will venture any thing, madam. At all events, they will frighten the children, and for one night they will be better in my cottage.\"  \"Well, then, be it so; take them to your cottage, and take Martha to attend upon the Miss Beverleys. Go down now, and desire Agatha to come to me, and Benjamin to saddle as fast as he can.\"  Jacob left the room, satisfied with the permission to remove the children. He knew that it was useless to argue with Miss Judith, who was immovable when once she had declared her intentions. He was debating in his own mind whether he should acquaint the servants with the threatened danger; but he had no occasion to do so, for Agatha had remained at the door while Jacob was communicating the intelligence, and as soon as he had arrived at that portion of it by which she learned that the mansion was to be burned down that night, had run off to the kitchen to communicate the intelligence to the other servants.  \"I'll not stay to be burned to death,\" exclaimed the cook, as Jacob came in. \"Well, Mr. Armitage, this is pretty news you have brought. What does my lady say!\"  \"She desires that Benjamin saddles immediately, to carry a letter to Lymington; and you, Agatha, are to go up stairs to her.\"  \"But what does she mean to do? Where are we to go?\" exclaimed Agatha.  \"Miss Judith intends to remain where she is.\"  \"Then she will remain alone, for me,\" exclaimed the housemaid, who was admired by Benjamin. \"Its bad enough to have little victuals and no wages, but as for being burned to death--Benjamin, put a pillion behind your saddle, and I'll go to Lymington with you. I won't be long in getting my bundle.\"  Benjamin, who was in the kitchen with the maids at the time that Jacob entered, made a sign significant of consent, and went away to the stable. Agatha went up to her mistress in a state of great perturbation, and the cook also hurried away to her bedroom.  \"They'll all leave her,\" thought Jacob; \"well, my duty is plain; I'll not leave the children in the house.\" Jacob then went in search of them, and found them playing in the garden. He called the two boys to him, and told them to follow him.  \"Now, Mr. Edward,\" said he, \"you must prove yourself your father's own son. We must leave this house immediately; come up with me to your rooms, and help me to pack up yours and your sisters' clothes, for we must go to my cottage this night. There is no time to be lost.\"  \"But why, Jacob; I must know why?\"  \"Because the Parliamentary troopers will burn it down this night.\"  \"Burn it down! Why, the house is mine, is it not? Who dares to burn down this house?\"  \"They will dare it, and will do it.\"  \"But we will fight them, Jacob; we can bolt and bar; I can fire a gun, and hit too, as you know; then there's Benjamin and you.\"  \"And what can you and two men do against a troop of horse, my dear boy? If we could defend the place against them, Jacob Armitage would be the first; but it is impossible, my dear boy. Recollect your sisters. Would you have them burned to death, or shot by these wretches? No, no, Mr. Edward; you must do as I say, and lose no time. Let us pack up what will be most useful, and load White Billy with the bundles; then you must all come to the cottage with me, and we will make it out how we can.\"  \"That will be jolly!\" said Humphrey; \"come, Edward.\"  But Edward Beverley required more persuasion to abandon the house; at last, old Jacob prevailed, and the clothes were put up in bundles as fast as they could collect them.  \"Your aunt said Martha was to go with your sisters, but I doubt if she will,\" observed Jacob, \"and I think we shall have no room for her, for the cottage is small enough.\"  \"Oh no, we don't want her,\" said Humphrey; \"Alice always dresses Edith and herself too, ever since mamma died.\"  \"Now we will carry down the bundles, and you make them fast on the pony while I go for your sisters.\"  \"But where does aunt Judith go?\" inquired Edward.  \"She will not leave the house, Master Edward; she intends to stay and speak to the troopers.\"  \"And so an old woman like her remains to face the enemy, while I run away from them!\" replied Edward. \"I will not go.\"  \"Well, Master Edward,\" replied Jacob, \"you must do as you please; but it will be cruel to leave your sisters here; they and Humphrey must come with me, and I can not manage to get them to the cottage without you go with us; it is not far, and you can return in a very short time.\"  To this Edward consented. The pony was soon loaded, and the little girls, who were still playing in the garden, were called in by Humphrey. They were told that they were going to pass the night in the cottage, and were delighted at the idea.  \"Now, Master Edward,\" said Jacob, \"will you take your sisters by the hand and lead them to the cottage? Here is the key of the door; Master Humphrey can lead the pony; and Master Edward,\" continued Jacob, taking him aside, \"I'll tell you one thing which I will not mention before your brother and sisters: the troopers are all about the New Forest, for King Charles has escaped, and they are seeking for him. You must not, therefore, leave your brother and sisters till I return. Lock the cottage-door as soon as it is dark. You know where to get a light, over the cupboard; and my gun is loaded, and hangs above the mantlepiece. You must do your best if they attempt to force an entrance; but above all, promise me not to leave them till I return. I will remain here to see what I can do with your aunt, and when I come back we can then decide how to act.\"  This latter ruse of Jacob's succeeded. Edward promised that he would not leave his sisters, and it wanted but a few minutes of twilight when the little party quitted the mansion of Arnwood. As they went out of the gates they were passed by Benjamin, who was trotting away with Martha behind him on a pillion, holding a bundle as large as herself. Not a word was exchanged, and Benjamin and Martha were soon out of sight.  \"Why, where can Martha be going?\" said Alice. \"Will she be back when we come home to-morrow?\"  Edward made no reply, but Humphrey said, \"Well, she has taken plenty of clothes in that huge bundle for one night, at least.\"  Jacob, as soon as he had seen the children on their way, returned to the kitchen, where he found Agatha and the cook collecting their property, evidently bent upon a hasty retreat.  \"Have you seen Miss Judith, Agatha?\"  \"Yes; and she told me that she should remain, and that I should stand behind her chair that she might receive the troopers with dignity; but I don't admire the plan. They might leave her alone, but I am sure that they will be rude to me.\"  \"When did Benjamin say he would be back?\"  \"He don't intend coming back. He said he would not, at all events, till to-morrow morning, and then he would ride out this way, to ascertain if the report was false or true. But Martha has gone with him.\"  \"I wish I could persuade the old lady to leave the house,\" said Jacob, thoughtfully. \"I fear they will not pay her the respect that she calculates upon. Go up, Agatha, and say I wish to speak with her.\"  \"No, not I; I must be off, for it is dark already.\"  \"And where are you going, then?\"  \"To Gossip Allwood's. It's a good mile, and I have to carry my things.\"  \"Well, Agatha, if you'll take me up to the old lady, I'll carry your things for you.\"  Agatha consented, and as soon as she had taken up"]]]
