Meanwhile, Group C, which has just been put together again, has no memory because their secondary banks have been wiped clean. So, like children, they _learn_ from the working Group A.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Drummond's mouth hung open in shocked understanding. \"And by the time A finishes the job, C's education is complete! And it's A's turn to be stripped!\"  \"By then,\" Angus went on, \"Group C is not only ready to start stripping Group A, but has also become intellectually mature enough to begin the education of the reassembled Group B!\"  They sat still for a while, thinking it over.  \"The compulsion to do their jobs,\" McIntosh continued, \"is unchanged because the primary function banks are sealed circuits and can't be tampered with. But in each generation, they have their secondary memory circuits wiped clean and have to start all over, getting whatever general knowledge they can from the last generation.\"  Drummond snapped his fingers excitedly. \"That's why they don't know what we are! Their idea of Man had to be passed down by word of mouth. And it got all distorted in the process!\"  Angus's stare, more solicitous now, swept slowly over the prostrate robots. \"More important, that's why they developed a religion. What's the main difference between human and robotic intelligence? It's that our span of life is limited on one end by birth, the other by death--mysteries of origin and destiny that can't be explained. You see, the _ordinary_ clunker understands where _he_ came from and where he's going. But here are robots who have to struggle with those mysteries--birth and death of the conscious intellect which they themselves once knew, and forgot, and now have turned into myths.\"  \"So they start thinking in terms of religion,\" Drummond said. \"Well, that clears up the whole thing, doesn't it?\"  \"Not quite. It doesn't explain why the religion they've invented parallels ours so closely. And it doesn't tell us who Jackson is.\"  Drummond ran thick fingernails against the stubble on his cheeks. \"Jackson is my Supervisor. I shall not rust. He maketh me to adjust my joint tension--\" He stopped and frowned. \"I've heard that before somewhere, only it sounded different.\"  Angus gave him a wry, tired smile. \"Sure. It's practically the Psalm of David. Now you see why the resemblance is driving me batty.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The robots stirred. Several of them stood up and plodded into the cave. The others continued repeating their endless praise and devotion--prayers in every sense of the word except common sense.  Angus leaned back against the cliff and let the sun's heat warm him.  \"Somehow it doesn't seem fair,\" he commented unhappily.  \"What doesn't?\" Drummond asked.  \"They're so close to the Truth. Yet, after we file a report, a deactivation crew will come along and erase their beliefs. They'll have their memory banks swept clean and once more they'll be nothing but clunkers with a factory-specification job of routine work to do.\"  \"Ain't that what they're supposed to be?\"  \"But these are different. They've found something no clunker's ever had before--hope, faith, aspiration beyond death.\" He shook his head ruefully.  There was movement at the mouth of the cave and the smaller group of robots emerged from the shadows, two of them bearing a stone slab. Their steps were ceremoniously slow as they approached the ledge. Bowing, they placed the tablet at Angus's feet and backed away.  \"These are the articles of our faith, O Jackson,\" one announced. \"We have preserved them for Thy coming.\"  McIntosh stared down at the charred remains of a book. Its metal-fiber binding was shredded and fused and encrusted with the dust of ages.  Drummond knelt beside it and, with stiff fingers, brushed away the film of grime, uncovering part of the title:       OLY     BIB  E  Eagerly, Angus eased the cover back. Of the hundreds of pages it had originally contained, only flaked parts of two or three remained. The printing was scarcely legible on the moldy paper.  He read aloud those words he could discern:  \"... to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside cool waters; He....\"  Drummond jabbed Angus with a triumphant forefinger. \"They didn't invent any religion, after all!\"  \"It isn't important _how_ they got it. The fact that they accepted it--that's what's important.\" McIntosh glanced up at Drummond. \"They probably found this in the wreck of the ship they'd been in. It's easy to see they haven't used it in hundreds of generations. Instead, the gist of what's in it was passed down orally. And their basic concepts of Man and supervisor were distorted all along the way--confused with the idea of God.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gently, he let the cover fall. And a shining square of duraloid fell out.  \"It's somebody's picture!\" Drummond exclaimed.  \"An ID card,\" Angus said, holding it so the light wouldn't reflect off its transparent protective cover.  It was a picture of a nondescript man--not as stout as Drummond, nor as lean as McIntosh--with hair neither all black, like the younger man's, nor nearly all white, like Angus's.  The print below the picture was indiscernible, except for the subject's last name....  \"Jackson!\" Drummond whispered.  Angus slowly replaced the card. \"A hundred years of false devotion,\" he said pensively. \"Just think--\"  \"This is no time for that kind of gas.\" Drummond glanced at his watch. \"We got just two hours to cut off those converters.\" Desperately, he faced the robots. \"Hey, you clunkers! You're robot assemblers. You got four hundred clunkers in that cave, all in pieces. Get in there and put 'em together!\"  Angus shook his head disapprovingly. Somehow it didn't seem right, calling them clunkers.  \"Jackson is my Supervisor!\" intoned RA-204.  \"Jackson is my Supervisor!\" echoed the mass.  Drummond glanced frantically at his watch, then looked helplessly at Angus. Angus shrugged.  The younger man's face suddenly tensed with resolution. \"So they've got to have a Jackson? All right, I'll give 'em one!\"  He waved his fist at the horde. \"I'm your Supervisor! I'm your Jackson! Now clear out of the way and--\"  RA-76's hand darted out and seized Drummond's ankle, tugged him off the ledge. As he fell to the ground, a score of robots closed in over him, metal arms flailing down methodically. Angus yelled at them to stop, saw he was too late and sank down, turning away sickly.  Finally, after a long while, they backed off and faced Angus.  \"We have passed the Divine test, O Jackson!\" 204 shouted up jubilantly.  \"We have redeemed ourselves before our Supervisor!\" exclaimed 76.  It took a long, horror-filled moment before Angus could speak.  \"How do you know?\" he managed to ask at last.  \"If he had been Jackson,\" exclaimed 204, \"we could not have destroyed him.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The robots fell prostrate again and returned to their devotional. But now the phrases were triumphant, where before they had been servile and uncertain.  Angus stared numbly down at Drummond, then backed against the cliff. The litany below, exuberant now, grew mightily in volume, booming vibrantly against distant hills.  \"There is but one Supervisor!\" intoned 204.  \"But one Jackson!\" answered the assembly.  \"And now He dwelleth among His children!\" 76 chanted.  \"In their midst!\" boomed the hundreds.  Suddenly it all seemed horribly ludicrous and Angus laughed. The litany, stopped and his laughter grew shriller, louder, edged with hysteria.  The shimmering sea of metal, confounded, stared at him and it was as though he could see fleshy furrows of confusion on the featureless faces.... But how could a clunker show emotion?  His laughter slowed and died, like the passing of a violent storm. And he felt weakened with a sickening sense of compassion. Robots--_human_ robots--standing awed before unknown concepts while they groped for Truth. Clunkers with a sense of right and wrong and with an overwhelming love. It was absurd that he had been elected father of twelve hundred children--whether flesh or metal--but it didn't _feel_ at all absurd.  \"Dost Thou despair of us, O Jackson?\" asked 76 hesitantly, staring up at him.  204 motioned toward the ship, the top of its hull shining beyond the nearby woods. \"Wouldst Thou _still_ return to Thy vessel, Supervisor?\"  Incredulous, Angus tensed. \"You mean I can go?\"  \"If that is Thy wish, True Jackson, you may go,\" said 76 submissively.  As he watched unbelievingly, a corridor opened in their ranks, extending toward the woods and the ship beyond. He glanced anxiously at his watch. There was still more than an hour left.  Wearily, he dropped from the ledge and trudged toward freedom, trying to look straight ahead. His eyes, nevertheless, wandered to the dejected figures who faced him with their heads bowed.  Then he laughed again, realizing the illogical nature of his solicitous thoughts. Imagine--_dejected_ clunkers! Still, the metal faces seemed somehow different. Where, a moment earlier, he had fancied expressions of jubilation, now there was the sense of hopelessness on the steel plates.         *       *       *       *       *  Shrugging off his uncertainty, he walked faster. After all, was it _his_ fault they'd stumbled upon a substitute for birth and death and had become something more than clunkers? What was he supposed to do--stay and play missionary, bring them the Truth so that when a deactivation crew came along, they would be so advanced morally that no one would suggest their destruction?  He stopped and scanned the ranks on either side. He'd do one thing for them, at least--he wouldn't report the wreck. Then it would be centuries, probably, before another ship wandered far enough away from the trade routes to intercept the distress signals.  Relieved by his decision, he went ahead more at ease.  And the litany started again--softly, appealing:  \"J"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51193"],["title","Pictures Don't Lie (#1)"],["body"," if it got there at all, but I thought it would please the library to get a new record in.  \"Two weeks later, when we caught and slowed a new batch of recordings, we found an answer. It was obviously meant for us. It was a flash of the Disney being played to a large audience, and then the audience sitting and waiting before a blank screen. The signal was very clear and loud. We'd intercepted a spaceship. They were asking for an encore, you see. They liked the film and wanted more....\"  He smiled at them in sudden thought. \"You can see them for yourself. It's all right down the hall where the linguists are working on the automatic translator.\"  The listening officer frowned and cleared his throat, and the thin young man turned to him quickly. \"No security reason why they should not see the broadcasts, is there? Perhaps you should show them.\" He said to the reporters reassuringly, \"It's right down the hall. You will be informed the moment the spaceship approaches.\"  The interview was very definitely over. The lank-haired, nervous young man turned away and seated himself at the radio set while the officer swallowed his objections and showed them dourly down the hall to a closed door.  They opened it and fumbled into a darkened room crowded with empty folding chairs, dominated by a glowing bright screen. The door closed behind them, bringing total darkness.  There was the sound of reporters fumbling their way into seats around him, but the _Times_ man remained standing, aware of an enormous surprise, as if he had been asleep and wakened to find himself in the wrong country.  The bright colors of the double image seemed the only real thing in the darkened room. Even blurred as they were, he could see that the action was subtly different, the shapes subtly not right.  _He was looking at aliens._         *       *       *       *       *  The impression was of two humans disguised, humans moving oddly, half-dancing, half-crippled. Carefully, afraid the images would go away, he reached up to his breast pocket, took out his polarized glasses, rotated one lens at right angles to the other and put them on.  Immediately, the two beings came into sharp focus, real and solid, and the screen became a wide, illusively near window through which he watched them.  They were conversing with each other in a gray-walled room, discussing something with restrained excitement. The large man in the green tunic closed his purple eyes for an instant at something the other said, and grimaced, making a motion with his fingers as if shoving something away from him.  Mellerdrammer.  The second, smaller, with yellowish-green eyes, stepped closer, talking more rapidly in a lower voice. The first stood very still, not trying to interrupt.  Obviously, the proposal was some advantageous treachery, and he wanted to be persuaded. The _Times_ groped for a chair and sat down.  Perhaps gesture is universal; desire and aversion, a leaning forward or a leaning back, tension, relaxation. Perhaps these actors were masters. The scenes changed, a corridor, a parklike place in what he began to realize was a spaceship, a lecture room. There were others talking and working, speaking to the man in the green tunic, and never was it unclear what was happening or how they felt.  They talked a flowing language with many short vowels and shifts of pitch, and they gestured in the heat of talk, their hands moving with an odd lagging difference of motion, not slow, but somehow drifting.  He ignored the language, but after a time the difference in motion began to arouse his interest. Something in the way they walked....  With an effort he pulled his mind from the plot and forced his attention to the physical difference. Brown hair in short silky crew cuts, varied eye colors, the colors showing clearly because their irises were very large, their round eyes set very widely apart in tapering light-brown faces. Their necks and shoulders were thick in a way that would indicate unusual strength for a human, but their wrists were narrow and their fingers long and thin and delicate.  There seemed to be more than the usual number of fingers.  Since he came in, a machine had been whirring and a voice muttering beside him. He called his attention from counting their fingers and looked around. Beside him sat an alert-looking man wearing earphones, watching and listening with hawklike concentration. Beside him was a tall streamlined box. From the screen came the sound of the alien language. The man abruptly flipped a switch on the box, muttered a word into a small hand-microphone and flipped the switch back with nervous rapidity.  He reminded the _Times_ man of the earphoned interpreters at the UN. The machine was probably a vocal translator and the mutterer a linguist adding to its vocabulary. Near the screen were two other linguists taking notes.         *       *       *       *       *  The _Times_ remembered the Senator pacing in the observatory room, rehearsing his speech of welcome. The speech would not be just the empty pompous gesture he had expected. It would be translated mechanically and understood by the aliens.  On the other side of the glowing window that was the stereo screen, the large protagonist in the green tunic was speaking to a pilot in a gray uniform. They stood in a brightly lit canary-yellow control room in a spaceship.  The _Times_ tried to pick up the thread of the plot. Already he was interested in the fate of the hero, and liked him. That was the effect of good acting, probably, for part of the art of acting is to win affection from the audience, and this actor might be the matinee idol of whole solar systems.  Controlled tension, betraying itself by a jerk of the hands, a too-quick answer to a question. The uniformed one, not suspicious, turned his back, busying himself at some task involving a map lit with glowing red points, his motions sharing the same fluid dragging grace of the others, as if they were underwater, or on a slow motion film. The other was watching a switch, a switch set into a panel, moving closer to it, talking casually--background music coming and rising in thin chords of tension.  There was a closeup of the alien's face watching the switch, and the _Times_ noted that his ears were symmetrically half-circles, almost perfect with no earholes visible. The voice of the uniformed one answered, a brief word in a preoccupied deep voice. His back was still turned. The other glanced at the switch, moving closer to it, talking casually, the switch coming closer and closer stereoscopically. It was in reach, filling the screen. His hand came into view, darting out, closed over the switch--  There was a sharp clap of sound and his hand opened in a frozen shape of pain. Beyond him, as his gaze swung up, stood the figure of the uniformed officer, unmoving, a weapon rigid in his hand, in the startled position in which he had turned and fired, watching with widening eyes as the man in the green tunic swayed and fell.  The tableau held, the uniformed one drooping, looking down at his hand holding the weapon which had killed, and music began to build in from the background. Just for an instant, the room and the things within it flashed into one of those bewildering color changes which were the bane of color television, and switched to a color negative of itself, a green man standing in a violet control room, looking down at the body of a green man in a red tunic. It held for less than a second; then the color band alternator fell back into phase and the colors reversed to normal.  Another uniformed man came and took the weapon from the limp hand of the other, who began to explain dejectedly in a low voice while the music mounted and covered his words and the screen slowly went blank, like a window that slowly filmed over with gray fog.  The music faded.  In the dark, someone clapped appreciatively.  The earphoned man beside the _Times_ shifted his earphones back from his ears and spoke briskly. \"I can't get any more. Either of you want a replay?\"  There was a short silence until the linguist nearest the set said, \"I guess we've squeezed that one dry. Let's run the tape where Nathen and that ship radio boy are kidding around CQing and tuning their beams in closer. I have a hunch the boy is talking routine ham talk and giving the old radio count--one-two-three-testing.\"  There was some fumbling in the semi-dark and then the screen came to life again.         *       *       *       *       *  It showed a flash of an audience sitting before a screen and gave a clipped chord of some familiar symphony. \"Crazy about Stravinsky and Mozart,\" remarked the earphoned linguist to the _Times_, resettling his earphones. \"Can't stand Gershwin. Can you beat that?\" He turned his attention back to the screen as the right sequence came on.  The _Post_, who was sitting just in front of him, turned to the _Times_ and said, \"Funny how much they look like people.\" He was writing, making notes to telephone his report. \"What color hair did that character have?\"  \"I didn't notice.\" He wondered if he should remind the reporter that Nathen had said he assigned the color bands on guess, choosing the colors that gave the most plausible images. The guests, when they arrived, could turn out to be bright green with blue hair. Only the gradations of color in the picture were sure, only the similarities and contrasts, the relationship of one color to another.  From the screen came the sound of the alien language again. This race averaged deeper voices than human. He liked deep voices. Could he write that?  No, there was something wrong with that, too. How had Nathen established the right sound-track pitch? Was it a matter of taking the modulation as it came in, or some sort of hetrodyning up and down by trial and error? Probably.  It might be safer to assume that Nathen had simply preferred deep voices.  As he sat there, doubting, an uneasiness he had seen in Nathen came back to"]]]
