And yet he was wrong, too: for that cannot be called home where a man is never at his ease. I had passed your years, lad, before ever I saw London; and ever since, when my boots have been deepest in Midland clay, I have heard her bells summon me, clear as ever they called to Whittington, 'London, thou art of townes _a per se_.' Nay, almost on that first pilgrimage I came to her as a son. _Urbem quam dicunt Romam_--I was no such clodpate as that rustic of Virgil's. I came expecting all things, and of none did she disappoint me. Give me the capital before all! 'Tis only there a man measures himself with men.\"  \"And cutpurses?\" the apprentice interjected.  \"Good and bad, rough and smooth,\" the countryman assented, with a large and catholic smile. \"'Tis no question of degrees, my friend, but of kind. I begin to think that, dwelling in London, you have not made her acquaintance. But you shall. As a father, lad,--for I like you,--I will open your eyes and teach your inheritance. What say you to the Bankside, for example?\"  \"The Bankside--hem!--and as a father!\" scoffed the youth, but his eyes glistened. He was wise beyond his opportunities, and knew all about the Bankside, albeit he had never walked through that quarter but in daylight, wondering at the histories behind its house-fronts.  \"As a father, I said; and evil be to him who evil thinks.\"  \"I can tell you of one who will think evil; and that is my master. I can tell you of another; and that will be the sheriff, when I am haled before him.\"  \"You said just now--or my hearing played a trick--that your mistress had a liking for you.\"  \"And _you_ said, 'Evil be to him that evil thinks.' She hath a double chin, and owns to fifty-five.\"  \"What, chins!\"  \"Years, years, master. Like a grandmother she dotes on me and looks after my morals. Nathless when you talk of Bankside----\" The apprentice hesitated: in the dusk his shrewd young eyes glistened. \"Say that I risk it?\" He hesitated again.  \"Lads were not so cautious in my young days. I pay the shot, I tell you--a gentleman of Warwickshire and known to the College of Arms.\"  \"It standeth on Paul's Wharf and handy for the ferry to Bankside: but the College closes early on Christmas Eve, and the Heralds be all at holiday. An you think of pawning your coat-of-arms with them to raise the wind, never say that I let you take that long way round without warning.\"  \"Leave the cost to me, once more!\" The countryman gazed down into the well of the theatre as if seeking an acquaintance among the figures below. \"But what are they doing? What a plague means this hammering? A man cannot hear himself speak for it.\"  \"'Tis the play.\"  \"The play?\"  \"The true play--the play you applauded: and writ by the same Will Shakespeare, they tell me--some share of it at least. Cometh he not, by the way, from your part of the world?\"  The countryman's eyes glistened in their turn: almost in the dusk they appeared to shine with tears.  \"Ay, I knew him, down in Warwickshire: a good lad he was, though his mother wept over him for a wild one. Hast ever seen a hen when her duckling takes to water? So it is with woman when, haply, she has hatched out genius.\"  The apprentice slapped his leg. \"I could have sworn it!\"  \"Hey?\"  \"Nay, question me not, master, for I cannot bring it to words. You tell me that you knew him: and I--on the instant I clapped eyes on you it seemed that somehow you were part of his world and somehow had belonged to him. Nearer I cannot get, unless you tell me more.\"  \"I knew him: to be sure, down in Warwickshire: but he has gone somedel beyond my ken, living in London, you see.\"  \"He goes beyond any man's kenning: he that has taught us to ken the world with new eyes. I tell you, master,\"--the apprentice stretched out a hand,--\"I go seeking him like one seeking a father who has begotten him into a new world, seeking him with eyes derived from him. Tell me----\"  But the countryman was leaning over the gallery-rail and scanning the pit again. He seemed a trifle bored by a conversation if not of less, then certainly of other, wit than he had bargained for. Somebody had drawn the curtains back from the stage, where the two lackeys who had decked the balcony with lanterns were busy now with crowbars, levering its wooden supports from their sockets.  \"Sure,\" said he, musing, \"they don't lift and pack away the stage every night, do they? Or is this some new law to harass players?\" He brought his attention back to the apprentice with an effort. \"If you feel that way towards him, lad,\" he answered, \"why not accost him? He walks London streets; and he has, if I remember, a courteous, easy manner.\"  \"If the man and his secret were one! But they are not, and there lies the fear--that by finding one I shall miss the other and recover it never. I cannot dare either risk: I want them both. You saw, this afternoon, how, when the secret came within grasp, the man slipped away; how, having taught us to know Falstaff as a foot its old shoe, he left us wondering on a sudden why we laughed! And yet 'twas not sudden, but bred in the play from the beginning; no, nor cruel, but merely right: only he had persuaded us to forget it.\"  The countryman put up a hand to hide a yawn: and the yawn ended in a slow chuckle.  \"Eh? that rogue Falstaff was served out handsomely: though, to tell the truth, I paid no great heed to the last scene, my midriff being sore with laughing.\"  The apprentice sighed.  \"But what is happening below?\" the other went on impatiently. \"Are they taking the whole theatre to pieces?\"  \"That is part of the play.\"  \"A whole regiment of workmen!\"  \"And no stage-army, neither. Yet they come into the play--not the play you saw without understanding, but the play you understood without seeing. They call it _The Phoenix_. Be seated, master, while I unfold the plot: this hammering deafens me. The Burbages, you must know----\"  \"I knew old James, the father. He brought me down a company of players to our town the year I was High Bailiff; the first that ever played in our Guildhall. Though a countryman, I have loved the arts--even to the length of losing much money by them. A boon fellow, old James! and yet dignified as any alderman. He died--let me see--was it two year agone? The news kept me sad for a week.\"  \"A good player, too,\"--the apprentice nodded,--\"though not a patch upon his son Richard. Cuthbert will serve, in ripe sententious parts that need gravity and a good memory for the lines. But Richard bears the bell of the Burbages. Well, Sir, old James being dead, and suddenly, and (as you say) these two years come February, his sons must go suing to the ground landlord, the theatre being leased upon their dad's life. You follow me?\"  The countryman nodded in his turn.  \"Very well. The landlord, being a skinflint, was willing to renew the lease, but must raise the rent. If they refuse to pay it, the playhouse fell to him. You may fancy how the Burbages called gods and men to witness. Being acquainted with players, you must know how little they enjoy affliction until the whole town shares it. Never so rang Jerusalem with all the woes of Jeremy as did City and suburb,--from north beyond Bishopsgate to south along the river, with the cursings of this landlord, who--to cap the humour of it--is a precisian, and never goes near a playhouse. Nevertheless, he patched up a truce for two years ending to-night, raising the rent a little, but not to the stretch of his demands. To-morrow--or, rather, the day after, since to-morrow is Christmas--the word is pay or quit. But in yielding this he yielded our friends the counterstroke. They have bought a plot across the water, in the Clink Liberty: and to-morrow, should he pass this way to church, no theatre will be here for him to smack his Puritan lips over. But for this hammering and the deep slush outside you might even now hear the rumbling of wagons; for wagons there be, a dozen of them, ready to cart the Muses over the bridge before midnight. 'Tis the proper vehicle of Thespis. See those dozen stout rascals lifting the proscenium----\"  The countryman smote his great hands together, flung back his head, and let his lungs open in shout after shout of laughter.  \"But, master----\"  \"Oh--oh--oh!

Don't--oh, _don't_!\"  \"Now I know,\" murmured the apprentice, \"what kind of jest goes down in the country: and, by'r Lady, it goes deep!\"  But an instant later the man had heaved himself upon his feet; his eyes expanded from their creases into great O's; his whole body towered and distended itself in gigantic indignation. \"The villain! The nipcheese curmudgeonly villain! And we tarry here, talking, while such things are done in England! A Nabal, I say. Give me a hammer!\" He heaved up an enormous thigh and bestrode the gallery-rail.  \"Have a care, master: the rail----\"  \"A hammer! Below there. A hammer!\" He leaned over, bellowing. The gang of workmen lifting the proscenium stared up open-mouthed into the foggy gloom--a ring of ghostly faces upturned in a luminous haze.  Already the man's legs dangled over the void. Twelve, fifteen feet perhaps, beneath him projected a lower gallery, empty but for three tiers of disordered benches. Plumb as a gannet he dropped, and an eloquent crash of timber reported his arrival below. The apprentice, craning over, saw him regain his feet, scramble over the second rail, and vanish. Followed an instant's silence, a dull thud, a cry from the workmen in the area. The apprentice ran for the gallery stairs and leapt down them, three steps at a time.  It took him, maybe, forty seconds to reach the area. There already, stripped to the shirt, in a whirl of dust and voices, stood his friend waving a hammer and shouting down the"]]]
