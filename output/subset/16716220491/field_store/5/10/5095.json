Taken to the capital city of Quotz, Green had almost been freed because there was no record of his being anybody's property. But his tallness, blondness and inability to speak the local language had convinced his captors that he must have wandered down from some far northern country. Therefore if he wasn't a slave he should be.  Presto, changeo! He was. And he'd put in six months in a quarry and a year as a dock worker. Then the Duchess had chanced to see him on the streets as she rode by, and he'd been transferred to the castle.  The streets were alive with the short, dark, stocky natives and the taller, lighter-complexioned slaves. The former wore their turbans of various colors, indicating their status and trade. The latter wore their three-cornered hats. Occasionally a priest in his high conical hat, hexagonal spectacles and goatee rode by. Wagons and rickshaws drawn by men or by big, powerful dogs went by. Merchants stood at the fronts of their shops and hawked their wares in loud voices. They sold cloth, grixtr nut, parchment, knives, swords, helmets, drugs, books--on magic, on religion, on travel--spices, perfumes, ink, rugs, highly sugared drinks, wine, beer, tonic, paintings, everything that went to make up their civilization. Butchers stood before open shops where dressed fowl, deer and dogs hung. Dealers in birds pointed out the virtues of their many-colored and multi-songed pets.  For the thousandth time Green wondered at this strange planet where the only large animals were men, dogs, grass cats, a small deer and a very small equine. In fact, there was a paucity of any variety of animal life, except for the surprisingly large number of birds. It was this scarcity of horses and oxen, he supposed, that helped perpetuate slavery. Man and dog had to provide most of the labor.  No doubt there was an explanation for all this, but it must be buried so deep in this people's forgotten history that one would never know. Green, always curious, wished that he had time and means to explore. But he didn't. He might as well resign himself to keeping a whole skin and to getting out of this mess as fast as he could.  There was enough to do merely to make his way through the narrow and crowded streets. He had to display his baton often to clear a path, though when he approached the harbor area he had less trouble because the streets were much wider.  Here great wagons drawn by gangs of slaves carried huge loads to or from the ships. The thoroughfares had to be broad, else the people would have been crushed between wagon and house. Here also were the so-called Pens, where the dock-slaves lived. Once the area had actually been an enclosure where men and women were locked up for the night. But the walls had been torn down and new houses built in the old Duke's time. The closest Earthly parallel Green could think of for these edifices was a housing project. Small cottages, all exactly alike, set in military columns.  For a moment he considered stopping off to see Amra, then decided against it. She'd get him tied up in an argument or something, and he'd spend too much time trying to soothe her, time that should be spent at the marketplace. He hated scenes, whereas Amra was a born self-dramatist who reveled in them, almost wallowed, one might say.  He averted his eyes from the Pens and looked at the other side of the street, where the walls of the great warehouses towered. Workmen swarmed around them, and cranes, operated by gangs pushing wheels like a ship's capstan, raised or lowered big bundles. Here, he thought, was a business opportunity for him.  Introduce the steam engine. It'd be the greatest thing that ever hit this planet. Wood-burning automobiles could replace the rickshaws. Cranes could be run by donkey-engines. The ships themselves could have their wheels powered by steam. Or perhaps, he thought, rails could be laid across the Xurdimur, and locomotives would make the ships obsolete.  No, that wouldn't work. Iron rails cost too much. And the savages that roved over the grassy plains would tear them up and forge weapons from them.  Besides, every time he suggested to the Duke a new and much more efficient method of doing something he ran dead into the brick wall of tradition and custom. Nothing new could be accepted unless the gods accepted it. The gods' will was interpreted by the priests. The priests clutched the status quo as tightly as a hungry infant clutches its mother's breast or an old man clings to his property.  Green could make a fight against the theocracy, but he didn't feel it was worth while to become a martyr.  He heard a familiar voice behind him calling his name.  \"Alan! Alan!\"  He hunched his shoulders like a turtle withdrawing his head and thought desperately for a moment of trying to ignore the voice. But, though a woman's, it was powerful and penetrating, and everybody around him had already turned to see its owner. So he couldn't pretend he hadn't heard it.  \"ALAN, YOU BIG BLOND NO-GOOD HUNK OF MAN, STOP!\"  Reluctantly Green told his rickshaw boy to turn around. The boy, grinning, did so. Like everybody else along the harbor front he knew Amra and was familiar with her relations with Green. She held their one-year-old daughter in her arms, cradled against her magnificent bosom. Behind her stood her other five children, her two sons by the Duke, her daughter by a visiting prince, her son by the captain of a Northerner ship, her daughter by a temple sculptor. Her rise and fall and slow rise again was told in the children around her; the tableau embodied an outline of the structure of the planet's society.     3   Her mother had been a Northerner slave; her father, a native freeman, a wheelwright. When she was five years old they had died in a plague. She had been transferred to the Pens and raised by her aunt. When she was fifteen her beauty had attracted the Duke and he had installed her in the palace. There she gave birth to his two sons, now ten and eleven, who would soon be taken away from her and raised in the Duke's household as free and petted servants.  The Duke had married the present Duchess several years after his liaison with Amra began and her jealousy had forced him to get rid of Amra. Back to the Pens she had gone; perhaps the Duke had not been too sad to see her go, for living with her was like living with a hurricane, and he liked peace and quiet too well.  Then, in accordance with the custom, she had been recommended by the Duke to a visiting prince; the prince had overstayed his leave from his native country because he hated to part with her, and the Duke had wanted to give her as a present. But here he'd overstepped his legal authority. Slaves had certain rights. A woman who had borne a citizen a child could not be shipped away or sold unless she gave her permission. Amra didn't choose to go, so the sorrowing prince had gone home, though not without leaving a memento of his visit behind him.  The captain of a ship had purchased her, but here again the law came to her rescue. He could not take her out of the country, and she again refused to leave. By now she had purchased several businesses--slaves were allowed to hold property and even have slaves of their own--and she knew that her two boys by the Duke would be valuable later on, when they'd go to live with him.  The temple sculptor had used her as his model for his great marble statue of the goddess of Fertility. Well he might, for she was a magnificent creature, a tall woman with long, richly auburn hair, a flawless skin, large russet brown eyes, a mouth as red and ripe as a plum, breasts with which neither child nor lover could find fault, a waist amazingly slender considering the rest of her curved body and her fruitfulness. Her long legs would have looked good on an Earthwoman and were even more outstanding among a population of club-ankled females.  There was more to her than beauty. She radiated a something that struck every male at first sight; to Green she sometimes seemed to be a violent physical event, perhaps even a principle of Nature herself.  There were times when Green felt proud because she had picked him as her mate, chosen him when he was a newly imported slave who could say only a few words in the highly irregular agglutinative tongue. But there were times when he felt that she was too much for him, and those times had been getting too frequent lately. Besides, he felt a pang whenever he saw their child, because he loved it and dreaded the moment when he would have to leave it. As for deserting Amra, he wasn't sure how that would make him feel. Undeniably, she did affect him, but then so did a blow in the teeth or wine in the blood.  He got down out of the rickshaw, told the boy to wait, said, \"Hello, honey,\" and kissed her. He was glad she was a slave, because she didn't wear a nose-ring. When he kissed the Duchess he was always annoyed by hers. She refused to take it off when with him because that would put her on his level, and he mustn't ever forget he was a slave. It was perfectly moral for her to take a bondsman as a lover but not a freeman, and she was nothing if not moral.  Amra's return kiss was passionate, part of which was the vigor of asperity. \"You're not fooling me,\" she said. \"You meant to ride right by. Kiss the children! What's the matter, are you getting tired of me? You told me you only accepted the Duchess's offer because it meant advancement, and you were afraid that if you turned her down she'd find an excuse to kill you. Well, I believed you--half-believed you, anyway. But I won't if you try sneaking by without seeing me. What's the matter? Are you a man or not? Are you afraid to face a woman? Don't shake your head. You're a liar! Don't forget to kiss Grizquetr; you know he's an affectionate boy and worships you, and it's absurd to say that in your country grown men don't kiss boys that old.

The conservative _Tribunal_ ran a scare head: HAS THE GLACIAL AGE COME AGAIN? and printed underneath a résumé of the phenomena up to the time of going to press--which did not include the appearance of the black flyer--with an interview from a prominent scientist. An enterprising reporter had routed the worthy gentleman out of bed and rushed him to the scene of the expanding ice cake in a fast motor boat, taking down in shorthand his comments on the matter. The scientist had been much puzzled, but spoke at length nevertheless. He said in part:      Has the glacial age come again? I do not know. I can only say that     we have no certain knowledge of the original cause of the glacial     period  and we cannot say definitely that it did not begin in     precisely this fashion. We have volcanos which radiate incredible     quantities of heat to the country surrounding them. No phenomenon     like this has occurred before, but it may be that some unknown     cause may bring to the surface a condition the antithesis of a     volcano, which, instead of radiating heat, will bring on local     glacierlike conditions. One might go farther and suggest that the     earth may alternate between periods of volcanic activity, during     which it is warm and conditions are favorable for habitation and     growth, and periods of this new antivolcanic activity during which     frigidity is normal, and mankind may be forced to take refuge in     the tropic zones. Still, I cannot say definitely.  The eminent scientist went on for two full columns, during which he refused to say anything definite, but suggested so many alarming possibilities that every one who read the _Tribunal_ was thrown into a state of mind not far from panic. He offered no explanation of the plume of steam.  When the appearance of the black flyer became known in the newspaper offices, city editors threw up their hands. The less conservative printed the wildest explanations. They put forth a virulent-organism theory, which, it must be admitted, was no farther from the truth than most of the others. The story began with an interview with the boatswain in charge of the boat crew from the destroyer:      We were ordered to take the men off the ice and to take especial     care not to be nipped ourselves. We rowed carefully toward the edge     of the ice cake, with the light of the searchlights to guide us. We     would see where the floe began, when the waves dropped back from     it. I've been in Northern seas, but I never saw anything like that.     The edge of the ice wasn't smooth and worn away by the waves. It     was rough with frost crystals that reached out like fingers     grabbing at the things near by. When we came close to the edge some     of the men in my boat were scared, and I don't blame them. I'd     dipped my hand overboard and the water was warm--and twenty feet     away there was that mass of ice! We backed up to the ice cake and     took off the men. I was looking over the side of the life boat, and     saw those long crystals forming and growing while I watched. They     were huge, from two feet long for the largest to three or four     inches for the smallest. They reached out and reached out terribly.     The stern of the boat was touching the ice, and I saw them reaching     for the hull like the tentacles of an octopus. They fastened on and     began to grow thicker. We took oars and smashed them, feeling     frightened as one is frightened in a nightmare. As fast as we broke     them they formed again, and the men on the ice seemed to be rotten     slow getting into the boat, though I don't doubt but they were     hurrying all they knew how. When they were all aboard we had to     work like mad to get clear.  The paper went on to expound its own idea of what had happened:      The sinister growth of the ice crystals is significant There has     always been notice of and comment upon the striking similarity     between the growth of crystals and the growth of plants. Until now     all scientific text-books have said that crystals could only grow     in a supersaturate solution of their own substance, and claimed     that they were not organic growths--in the sense of growths caused     by an intelligence within the crystal. Is it not possible that the     scientists have been wrong? Is it not possible that crystals are     growths in the same way that plants are growths? Granting that, what     is to keep a scientist from isolating and cultivating the crystal     embryo? We have done that with germs, and with the life germs in     eggs and plants. We can even use a process of parthenogenesis and     create monsters from the unfertilized eggs of frogs and sea urchins.     Why could not this scientist experiment until the life germ of the     ice crystal could be developed and enlarged? Why could not this     development continue until the germ could not only create its     crystals under the most favorable conditions of temperature, but     _at the normal temperature of water_? At the Harvard laboratories     water has been, kept liquid far below its normal freezing-point,     and under tremendous pressure has been found to remain ice at a     temperature of one hundred degrees Fahrenheit! Can we doubt that     this appearance of ice at this extraordinary season is due to the     malicious activities of a foreign government, envious of our     magnificent merchant marine and commerce?  The explanation was ingenious, but though the scientific facts quoted were quite correct the inference was hardly justifiable. Water can and does reach a temperature several degrees below 32° Fahrenheit without solidifying--as may be proved by putting a glass of water in a cold room in winter--but the slightest jar causes the instantaneous formation of ice crystals, and in a little while the whole mass is solid. The fact of \"hot\" ice must also be admitted, but it requires a pressure of rather more than fifty tons to the square inch, and is rarely attempted.  This paper also was forced to admit as inexplicable the plume of steam which rose from a thousand to fifteen hundred feet into the air. In any event, the claim that a certain unfriendly foreign government was trying to ruin the commerce of the United States was effectively squashed by cablegrams from Gibraltar, Folkestone, and Yokohama. Three great icebergs had formed in the Straits of Gibraltar and extended until they joined, when a solid mass of ice made a bridge that once more rejoined the continents of Africa and Europe, from Ceuta to the Rock. The plumes of steam were visible here, too. Three mighty columns of white mist rose at equal distances across the gap.  Folkestone harbor was a mass of ice. A great transatlantic liner had been caught in the expanding berg, and the huge hull had been crushed like so much cardboard. The passengers and crew had escaped across the ice. The great steam plume made a wonderful sight for miles around. Yokohama was similarly visited. Three battleships of the Japanese fleet were frozen in and their hulls cracked and broken. The plume of steam--nearly two thousand feet high--had aroused the latent superstition of the Japanese and was being exorcised in every Shinto temple in the kingdom.  The panic which was engendered by the mysteries of the icebergs and the unknown motives of the men so obviously responsible for their appearance grew in intensity. New York was in a blue funk. The police felt the tremor that means that at any moment the crowds thronging the streets might break and from sheer panic become uncontrollable. Every patrolman wore a worried frown and worked like mad to keep the crowds moving, moving always. The strain was becoming greater, however, and troops were being hastily moved into the city when an announcement was made by the British foreign office:      It has been decided to make public a communication received at the     foreign office bearing on the blocking of Folkestone harbor, the     Straits of Gibraltar, Yokohama, and New York. The communication is     dated from \"The Dictatorial Residence,\" and reads as follows:      \"TO THE PREMIER OF GREAT BRITAIN: You are informed that the     blocking of Folkestone harbor, as well as that of the Straits of     Gibraltar, New York, and Yokohama, is evidence of my intention and     power to assume control of the governments of the world as dictator.     Present administrations and systems of government will continue in     power under my direction and subject to my commands. The machinery     of the League of Nations is to be used to enforce my decrees. You     will readily understand that the same means I used to block the     harbors and straits now frozen over can be extended indefinitely.     Rivers can be made to cease to flow, lakes to irrigate, and all     commerce and agriculture forced to suspend its activity. This will     be done, if it is made necessary by the refusal of the governments     of the world to accede to my demands. Given under my hand at the     dictatorial residence,      \"(Signed) WLADISLAW VARRHUS.\"      The foreign office offers this communication to allay the fears of     the public that a new glacial period may be imminent, but at the     same time it wishes to assure the British people that the demands     of the writer are not taken seriously. It is evident that the maker     of such absurd demands is insane, and though he may be able to     cause perhaps serious inconvenience to commerce, a means of     nullifying his invention will be forthcoming in a short while.     British scientists are studying the Folkestone phenomena and are     confident of a prompt solution of the problem.  Though it might have been expected that such an announcement as that of the intention of an unknown and probably insane man to make himself ruler of the world would have caused even greater panic, the reverse was actually the case.
