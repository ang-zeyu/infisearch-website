Or has the new tax levied, the command to seize the treasures of the temple, driven them to extremities?  What am I to do? We need gold to bid the foe defiance, to preserve the independence of the throne, the country, and the people.  Or have tidings from Rome?  It is becoming serious--and the noise is growing louder.\"  \"Let me see what they want,\" Archibius anxiously interrupted, hastening to the door; but just at that moment the Introducer opened it, crying, \"Mark Antony is approaching the Lochias, attended by half Alexandria!\"  \"The noble Imperator is returning!\" fell from the bearded lips of the commander of the guard, ere the courtier's words had died away; and even while he spoke Iras pressed past him, shrieking as if half frantic: \"He is coming!  He is here!  I knew he would come!  How they are shouting and cheering!  Out with you, men!  If you are willing, my royal mistress, we will greet him from the balcony of Berenike.  If we only had--\"  \"The  twins--little Alexander!\"  interrupted Cleopatra, with blanched face and faltering voice.  \"Put on their festal garments.\"  \"Quick--the children, Zoe!\" cried Iras, completing the order and clapping her hands.  Then she turned to the Queen with the entreaty: \"Be calm, my royal mistress, be calm, I beseech you.  We have ample time.  Here is the vulture crown of Isis, and here the other.  Antony's slave, Eros, has just come in, panting for breath.  The Imperator, he says, will appear as the new Dionysus.  It would certainly please his master--though he had not commissioned him to request it--if you greeted him as the new Isis. --Help me, Hathor.  Nephoris, tell the usher to see that the fan-bearers and the other attendants, women and men, are in their places.--Here are the pearl and diamond necklaces for your throat and bosom.  Take care of the robe.  The transparent bombyx is as delicate as a cobweb, and if you tear it  No, you must not refuse.  We all know how it pleases him to see his goddess in divine majesty and beauty.\"  Cleopatra, with glowing cheeks and throbbing heart, made no further objection to donning the superb festal robe, strewn with glimmering pearls and glittering gems. It would have been more in harmony with her feelings to meet the returning Antony in the plain, dark garb which, since her arrival at home, she had exchanged for a richer one only on festal occasions; but Antony was coming as the new Dionysus, and Eros knew what would please his master.  Eight nimble hands, which were often aided by Iras's skilful fingers, toiled busily, and soon the latter could hold up the mirror before Cleopatra, exclaiming from the very depths of her heart, \"Like the foam- born Aphrodite and the golden Hathor!\"  Then Iras, who, in adorning her beloved mistress, had forgotten love, hate, and envy, and amid her eager haste barely found time for a brief, fervent prayer for a happy issue of this meeting, threw the broad folding-doors as wide as if she were about to reveal to the worshippers in the temple the image of the god in the innermost sanctuary.  A long, echoing shout of surprise and delight greeted the Queen, for the courtiers, hastily summoned, were already awaiting her without, from the grey-haired epistolograph to the youngest page.  Regally attired women in her service raised the floating train of her cloak; others, in sacerdotal robes, were testing the ease of movement of the rings on the sistrum rods, men and boys were forming into lines according to the rank of each individual, and the chief fan-bearer gave the signal for departure. After a short walk through several halls and corridors, the train reached the first court-yard of the palace, and there ascended the few steps leading to the broad platform at the entrance-gate which overlooked the whole Bruchium and the Street of the King, down which the expected hero would approach.  The distant uproar of the multitude had sounded threatening, but now, amid the deafening din, they could distinguish every shout of welcome, every joyous greeting, every expression of delight, surprise, applause, admiration, and homage, known to the Greek and Egyptian tongues.  Only the centre and end of the procession were visible.  The head had reached the Corner of the Muses, where, concealed by the old trees in the garden, it moved on between the Temple of Isis and the land owned by Didymus.  The end still extended to the Choma, whence it had started.  All Alexandria seemed to have joined it.  Men large and small, of high and low degree, old and young, the lame and the crippled, mingled with the throng, sweeping onward among horses and carriages, carts and beasts of burden, like a mountain torrent dashing wildly down to the valley.  Here a loud shriek rang from an overturned litter, whose bearers had fallen.  Yonder a child thrown to the ground screamed shrilly, there a dog trodden under the feet of the crowd howled piteously.  So clear and resonant were the shouts of joy that they rose high above the flutes and tambourines, the cymbals and lutes of the musicians, who followed the man approaching in the robes of a god.  The head of the procession now passed beyond the Corner of the Muses and came within view of the platform.  There could be no doubt to whom this ovation was given, for the returning hero was in the van, high above all the other figures.  From the golden throne borne on the shoulders of twelve black slaves he waved his long thyrsus in greeting to the exulting multitude.  Before the bacchanalian train which accompanied him, and behind the musicians who followed, moved two elephants bearing between them, as a light burden, some unrecognizable object covered with a purple cloth.  Now the column had passed between the pylons through the lofty gateway which separated the palace from the Street of the King, and stopped opposite to the platform.  While officials, Scythians, and body-guards of all shades of complexion, on foot and on horseback, kept back the throng by force where friendly warning did not avail, Cleopatra saw her lover descend from the throne and give a signal to the Indian slave who guided the elephants.  The cloth was flung aside, revealing to the astonished eyes of the spectators a bouquet of flowers such as no Alexandrian had ever beheld.  It consisted entirely of blossoming rose-bushes.  The red flowers formed a circle in the centre, surrounded by a broad light garland of white ones. The whole gigantic work rested like an egg in its cup in a holder of palm fronds which, as it were, framed it in graceful curving outlines.  More than a thousand blossoms were united in this peerless bouquet, and the singular gigantic gift was characteristic of its giver.  He advanced on foot to the platform, his figure towering above the brown, light-hued, and black freedmen and slaves who followed as, on the monuments of the Pharaohs, the image of the sovereign dominates those of the subjects and foes.  He could look down upon the tallest men, and the width of his shoulders was as remarkable as his colossal height.  A long, gold-broidered purple mantle, floating to his ancles, increased his apparent stature.  Powerful arms, with the swelling muscles of an athlete, were extended from his sleeveless robe towards the beloved Queen.  The well-formed head, thick dark hair, and magnificent beard corresponded with the powerful figure.  Formerly these locks had adorned the head of the youth with the blue-black hue of the raven's plumage; now the threads of grey scattered abundantly through them were concealed by the aid of dye.  A thick wreath of vine leaves rested on the Imperator's brow, and leafy vine branches, to which clung several dark bunches of grapes, fell over his broad shoulders and down his back, which was covered like a cloak, not by a leopard-skin, but that of a royal Indian tiger of great size--he had slain it himself in the arena.  The head and paws of the animal were gold, the eyes two magnificent sparkling sapphires.  The clasp of the chain, by which the skin was suspended, as well as that of the gold belt which circled the Imperator's body above the hips, was covered with rubies and emeralds.  The wide armlets above his elbows, the ornaments on his broad breast, nay, even his red morocco boots, glittered and flashed with gems.  Radiant magnificent as his former fortunes seemed the attire of this mighty fallen hero, who but yesterday had shrunk timidly and sadly from the eyes of his fellow-men.  His features, too, were large, noble, and beautiful in outline; but, though his pale cheeks were adorned with the borrowed crimson of youth, half a century of the maddest pursuit of pleasure and the torturing excitement of the last few weeks had left traces only too visible; for the skin hung in loose bags beneath the large eyes; wrinkles furrowed his brow and radiated in slanting lines from the corners of his eyes across his temples.  Yet not one of those whom this bedizened man of fifty was approaching thought of seeing in him an aged, bedecked dandy; it was an instinct of his nature to surround himself with pomp and splendour and, moreover, his whole appearance was so instinct with power that scorn and mockery shrank abashed before it.  How frank, gracious, and kindly was this man's face, how sincere the heart-felt emotion which sparkled in his eyes, still glowing with the fire of youth, at the sight of the woman from whom he had been so long parted!  Every feature beamed with the most ardent tenderness for the royal wife whom he was approaching, and the expression on the lips of the giant varied so swiftly from humble, sorrowful anguish of mind to gratitude and delight, that even the hearts of his foes were touched. But when, pressing his hand on his broad breast, he advanced towards the Queen, bending so low that it seemed as if he would fain kiss her feet, when in fact the colossal figure did sink kneeling before her, and the powerful arms were outstretched with fervent devotion like a child"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5480"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 08 (#2)"],["body","help, the woman who had loved him throughout her whole life with all the ardour of her passionate soul was overpowered by the feeling that everything which stood between them, all their mutual offences, had vanished.  He saw the sunny smile that brightened her beloved, ever- beautiful face, and then--then his own name reached his ears from the lips to which he owed the greatest bliss love had ever offered.  At last, as if intoxicated by the tones of her voice, which seemed to him more musical than the songs of the Muses; half smiling at the jest which, even in the most serious earnest, he could not abandon; half moved to the depths of his soul by the power of his newly awakening happiness after such sore sorrow, he pointed to the gigantic bouquet, which three slaves had lifted down from the elephant and were bearing to the Queen. Cleopatra, too, was overwhelmed with emotion.  This floral gift imitated, on an immense scale, the little bouquet which the famous young general had taken from her father's hand before the gate of the garden of Epicurus to present to her as his first gift.  That had also been composed of red roses, surrounded by white ones.  Instead of palm fronds, it had been encircled only by fern leaves.  This was one of the beautiful offerings which Antony's gracious nature so well understood how to choose.  The bouquet was a symbol of the unprecedented generosity natural to this large-minded man.  No magic goblet had compelled him to approach her thus and with such homage.  Nothing had constrained him, save his overflowing heart, his constant, fadeless love.  As if restored to youth, transported by some magic spell to the happy days of early girlhood, she forgot her royal dignity and the hundreds of eyes which rested upon him as if spell-bound; and, obedient to an irresistible impulse of the heart, she sank upon the broad, heaving breast of the kneeling hero.  Laughing joyously in the clear, silvery tones which are usually heard only in youth, he clasped her in his strong arms, raised her slender figure in its floating royal mantle from the ground, kissed her lips and eyes, held her aloft in the soaring attitude of the Goddess of Victory, as if to display his happiness to the eyes of all, and at last placed her carefully on her feet again like some treasured jewel.  Then, turning to the children, who were waiting at their mother's side, he lifted first little Alexander, then the twins, to kiss them; and, while holding Helios and Selene in his arms, as if the joy of seeing them again had banished their weight, the shouts which had arisen when the Queen sank on his breast again burst forth.  The ancient walls of the Lochias palace had never heard such acclamations.  They passed from lip to lip, from hundreds to hundreds and, though those more distant did not know the cause, they joined in the shouts.  Along the whole vast stretch from the Lochias to the Choma the cheers rang out like a single, heart-stirring, inseparable cry, echoing across the harbour, the ships lying at anchor, the towering masts, to the cliff amid the sea where Barine was nursing her new-made husband.     CHAPTER XX.  The property of the freedman Pyrrhus was a flat rock in the northern part of the harbour, scarcely larger than the garden of Didymus at the Corner of the Muses, a desolate spot where neither tree nor blade of grass grew. It was called the Serpent Island, though the inhabitants had long since rid it of these dangerous guests, which lived in great numbers in the neighbouring cliffs.  Not even the poorest crops would grow in soil so hostile to life, and those who chose it for a home were compelled to bring even the drinking-water from the continent.  This desert, around which hovered gulls, sea-swallows, and sea-eagles, had been for several weeks the abode of the fugitives, Dion and Barine. They still occupied the two rooms which had been assigned to them on their arrival.  During the day the sun beat fiercely down upon the yellow chalky rock.  There was no shade save in the house and at the foot of a towering cliff in the southern part of the island, the fishermen's watch- tower.  There were no works of human hands save a little Temple of Poseidon, an altar of Isis, the large house owned by Pyrrhus, solidly constructed by Alexandrian masons, and a smaller one for the freedman's married sons and their families.  A long wooden frame, on which nets were strung to dry, rose on the shore.  Near it, towards the north, in the open sea, was the anchorage of the larger sea-going ships and the various skiffs and boats of the fisher folk.  Dionikos, Pyrrhus's youngest son, who was still unmarried, built new boats and repaired the old ones.  His two strong, taciturn brothers, with their wives and children, his father Pyrrhus, his wife and their youngest child, a daughter, Dione, a few dogs, cats, and chickens, composed the population of the Serpent Island.  Such were the surroundings of the newly wedded pair, who had been reared in the capital.  At first many things were strange to them, but they accommodated themselves to circumstances with a good grace, and both had admitted to each other, long before, that life had never been so equable and peaceful.  During the first week Dion's wound and fever still harassed him, but the prediction of Pyrrhus that the pure, fresh sea-air would benefit the sufferer had been fulfilled, and the monotonous days had passed swiftly enough to the young bride in caring for the invalid.  The wife of Pyrrhus--\"mother,\" as they all called her--had proved to be a skilful nurse, and her daughters-in-law and young Dione were faithful and nimble assistants.  During the time of anxiety and nursing, Barine had formed a warm friendship for them.  If the taciturn men avoided using a single unnecessary word, the women were all the more ready to gossip; and it was a pleasure to talk to pretty Dione, who had grown up on the island and was eager to hear about the outside world.  Dion had long since left his couch and the house, and each day looked happier, more content with himself and his surroundings.  At first his feverish visions had shown him his dead mother, pointing anxiously at his new-made wife, as if to warn him against her.  During his convalescence he remembered them and they conjured up the doubt whether Barine could endure the solitude of this desolate cliff, whether she would not lose the bright serenity of soul whose charm constantly increased.  Would it be any marvel if she should pine with longing in this solitude, and even suffer physically from their severe privations?  The perception that love now supplied the place of all which she had lost pleased him, but he forbade himself to expect that this condition of affairs could be lasting.  Nothing save exaggerated self-conceit would induce the hope.  But he must have undervalued his own power of attraction--or Barine's love--for with each passing week the cheerful serenity of her disposition gained fresh steadfastness and charm.  He, too, had the same experience; it was long since he had felt so vigorous, untrammelled, and free from care.  His sole regret was the impossibility of sharing the political life of the city at this critical period; and at times he felt some little anxiety concerning the fate and management of his property, though, even if his estates were confiscated, he would still retain a competence which he had left in the hands of a trustworthy money-changer.  Barine shared everything that concerned him, even these moods, and this led him to tell her about the affairs of the city and the state, in which she had formerly taken little interest, his property in Alexandria and the provinces.  With what glad appreciation she listened, when she went out with him from the northern anchorage on the open sea, or sat during long winter evenings making nets, an art which she had learned from Dione!  Her lute had been sent to her from the city, and what pleasure her singing afforded her husband and herself; how joyously their hosts, old and young, listened to the melody!  A few book-rolls had also come, and Dion enjoyed discussing their contents with Barine.  He himself read very little, for he was rarely indoors during the day.  The fourth week after his arrival he was able to aid, with arms whose muscles had been steeled in the pakestra, the men in their fishing, and Dionikos in his boat-building.  The close, constant, uninterrupted companionship of the married pair revealed to each unexpected treasures in the other, which, perhaps, might have remained forever concealed in city life.  Here each was everything to the other, and this undisturbed mutual life soon inspired that blissful consciousness of inseparable union which usually appears only after years, as the fairest fruit of a marriage founded on love.  Doubtless there were hours when Barine longed to see her mother and others who were dear to her, but the letters which arrived from time to time prevented this yearning from becoming a source of actual pain.  Prudence required them to restrict their intercourse with the city.  But, whenever Pyrrhus went to market, letters reached the island delivered at the fish auction in the harbour by Anukis, Charmian's Nubian maid, to the old freedman, who had become her close friend.  So the time came when Dion could say without self-deception that Barine was content in this solitude, and that his love and companionship supplied the place of the exciting, changeful life of the capital. Though letters came from her mother, sister, or Charmian, her grandfather, Gorgias, or Archibius, not one transformed the wish to leave her desolate hiding-place into actual homesickness, but each brought fresh subjects for conversation, and among them many which, by arousing the interest of both, united them more firmly.  The second month of their flight a letter arrived from Archibius, in which he informed them that they might soon form plans for their"]]]
