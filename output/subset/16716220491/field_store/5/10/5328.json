One corner of the cabin was in ashes, but the heavy rain had probably extinguished the conflagration.  “Uncle Hiram!” cried the boy, as soon as he recovered from his amazement. “Uncle Hiram, where are you?”  There was no answer to this call and for the moment Joe's heart seemed to stop beating. Was the old hermit under that pile of ruins? If so it was more than likely he was dead.  Dropping his fish and his lines, the youth sprang to the front of the cabin. The door had fallen to the ground and before him was a mass of wreckage with a small hollow near the bottom. He dropped on his knees and peered inside.  “Uncle Hiram!” he called again.  There was no answer, and he listened with bated breath. Then he fancied he heard a groan, coming from the rear of what was left of the cabin. He ran around to that point and pulled aside some boards and a broken window sash.  “Uncle Hiram, are you here?”  “Joe!” came in a low voice, full of pain. The man tried to say more but could not.  Hauling aside some more boards, Joe now beheld the hermit, lying flat on his back, with a heavy beam resting on his chest. He was also suffering from a cut on the forehead and from a broken ankle.  “This is too bad, Uncle Hiram!” he said, in a trembling voice. “I'll get you out just as soon as I can.”  “Be--be careful, Joe--I--I--my ribs must be broken,” gasped the hermit.  “I'll be careful,” answered the boy, and began to pull aside one board after another. Then he tugged away at the beam but could not budge it.  “Raise it up Joe--it--is--crushing the life ou--out of me,” said the hermit faintly.  “I'll pry it up,” answered the boy, and ran off to get a block of wood. Then he procured a stout pole and with this raised the heavy beam several inches.  “Can you crawl out, Uncle Hiram?”  There was no answer, and Joe saw that the man had fainted from exhaustion. Fixing the pole so it could not slip, he caught hold of the hermit and dragged him to a place of safety.  Joe had never had to care for a hurt person before and he scarcely knew how to proceed. He laid the hermit on the grass and washed his face with water. Soon Hiram Bodley opened his eyes once more.  “My chest!” he groaned. “All of my ribs must be broken! And my ankle is broken, too!” And he groaned again.  “I had better get a doctor, Uncle Hiram.”  “A doctor can't help me.”  “Perhaps he can.”  “I haven't any faith in doctors. A doctor operated on my mother and killed her.”  “But Doctor Gardner is a nice man. He will do all he can for you, I am sure,” urged Joe.  “Well, Dr. Gardner is a good fellow I admit. If you--can--can get him--I'll--I'll--” The sufferer tried to go on but could not.  “I think I can get him. But I hate to leave you alone.” And Joe stared around helplessly. He wished he had Ned with him.  “Never mind--give me a drink--then go,” answered Hiram Bodley. He had often taken Doctor Gardner out to hunt with him and liked the physician not a little.  Inside of five minutes Joe was on the way to the doctor's residence, which was on the outskirts of Riverside. He had left the hermit as comfortable as possible, on a mattress and covered with a cloth to keep off the night air,--for it was now growing late and the sun had set behind the mountains.  Tired though he was the boy pulled with might and main, and so reached the dock of the physician's home in a short space of time. Running up the walk of the neatly-kept garden, he mounted the piazza and rang the bell several times.  “What's the matter?” asked Doctor Gardner, who came himself to answer the summons.  “Our cabin is in ruins, because of the storm, and Mr. Bodley is badly hurt,” answered Joe, and related some of the particulars.  “This is certainly too bad, my boy,” said the physician. “I'll come at once and do what I can for him.”  He ran for a case of instruments and also for some medicines, and then followed Joe back to the boat.  “You act as if you were tired,” said the doctor, after he had watched Joe at the oars for several minutes.  “I am tired, sir--I've been rowing a good deal to-day. But I guess I can make it.”  “Let me row,” said the physician, and took the oars. He was a fine oarsman, and the trip was made in half the time it would have taken Joe to cover the distance.  At the dock there was a lantern, used by Joe and the hermit when they went fishing at night. This was lit, and the two hurried up the trail to the wreck of the cabin.  Hiram Bodley was resting where Joe had left him. He was breathing with difficulty and did not at first recognize the doctor.  “Take it off!” he murmured. “Take it off! It is--is crushing th--the life out of--of me!”  “Mr. Bodley--Hiram, don't you know me?” asked Doctor Gardner, kindly.  “Oh! So it's you? I guess you can't do much, doctor, can you? I--I'm done for!” And a spasm of pain crossed the sufferer's face.  “While there is life there is hope,” answered the physician, noncommittally. He recognized at once that Hiram Bodley's condition was critical.  “He'll get over it, won't he?” questioned Joe, quickly.  The doctor did not answer, but turned to do what he could for the hurt man. He felt of his chest and listened to his breathing, and then administered some medicine.  “His ankle is hurt, too,” said Joe.  “Never mind the ankle just now, Joe,” was the soft answer.  There was something in the tone that alarmed the boy and he caught the physician by the arm.  “Doctor, tell me the truth!” he cried. “Is he is he going to die?”  “I am afraid so, my lad. His ribs are crushed and one of them has stuck into his right lung.”  At these words the tears sprang into the boy's eyes and it was all he could do to keep from crying outright. Even though the old hermit had been rough in his ways, Joe thought a good deal of the man.  “Cannot you do something, doctor,” he pleaded.  “Not here. We might do something in a hospital, but he would not survive the journey. He is growing weaker every moment. Be brave, my lad. It is a terrible trial, I know, but you must remember that all things are for the best.”  Joe knelt beside the sufferer and took hold of his hand. Hiram Bodley looked at him and then at the doctor.  “I--I can't live--I know it,” he said hoarsely. “Joe, stay by me till I die, won't you?”  “Yes!” faltered the boy. “Oh, this is awful!”  “I'm sorry to leave you so soon, Joe--I--I thought I'd be--be able to do something for you some day.”  “You have done something for me, Uncle Hiram.”  “All I've got goes to you, Joe. Doctor, do you hear that?”  “I do.”  “It--it ain't much, but it's something. The blue box--I put it in the blue box--” Here the sufferer began to cough.  “The blue box?” came from Joe questioningly.  “Yes, Joe, all in the blue box--the papers and the money--And the blue box is--is--” Again the sufferer began to cough. “I--I want water!” he gasped.  The water was brought and he took a gulp. Then he tried to speak again, but the effort was in vain. The doctor and Joe raised him up.  “Uncle Hiram! Speak to me!” cried the boy.  But Hiram Bodley was past speaking. He had passed to the Great Beyond.    CHAPTER IV.   THE SEARCH FOR THE BLUE BOX.   Three days after his tragic death Hiram Bodley was buried. Although he was fairly well known in the lake region only a handful of people came to his funeral. Joe was the chief mourner, and it can honestly be said that he was much downcast when he followed the hermit to his last resting place.  After the funeral several asked Joe what he intended to do. He could not answer the question.  “Have you found that blue box?” questioned Doctor Gardner.  “No, sir, I have not thought of it.”  “Probably it contains money and papers of value, Joe.”  “I am going to look for it to-day,” said the boy. “I--I couldn't look for it while--while--”  “I understand. Well, I trust you locate the box and that it contains all you hope for,” added the physician.  As luck would have it, Ned Talmadge's family had just gone away on a trip to the West, so Mr. Talmadge could offer the boy no assistance. But Ned was on hand and did what he could.  “You don't know what you'll do next, do you, Joe?” asked Ned, as he and Joe returned to the wreck of the cabin.  “No.”  “Well, if you haven't any money I'll do what I can for you.”  “Thank you, Ned; you are very kind.”  “It must be hard to be thrown out on the world in this fashion,” went on the rich boy, sympathetically.  “It is hard. After all, I thought a good deal of Uncle Hiram. He was strange in his ways, but he had a good heart.”  “Wasn't he shot in the head once by accident in the woods?”  “Yes.”  “Maybe that made him queer at times.”  “Perhaps so.”  “I've got six dollars and a half of my spending money saved up. You may have that if you wish,” continued Ned, generously.  “I'd rather not take it, Ned.”  “Why not?”  “If I can, I want to be independent. Besides, I think there is money around somewhere,” and Joe mentioned the missing blue box.  “You must hunt for that blue box by all means!” cried the rich boy. “I'll help you.”  After the death of Hiram Bodley, Joe and two of the lake guides had managed to repair one room of the broken-down cabin, and from this the funeral had taken place.  The room contained a bed, a table, two benches and a few dishes and cooking utensils The floor was bare and the window was broken out. It was truly a most uninviting home.  “Of course you are not going to stay here, now you are alone?” said Ned, after a look around.  “I don't know where else to go, Ned.”  “Why not move into town!”  “Perhaps I will. But I want to find that blue box before I decide on anything.”  Without delay the two boys set to work among the ruins, looking into every hole and corner they could think of and locate. They pulled away heavy boards and logs, and Joe even got a spade and dug up the ground at certain points.  “It doesn't seem to be here,” said Ned, after an hour had passed.  “It must be here,” cried Joe.  “Perhaps it was buried under a tree.”  “That may be true. Anyway, I am certain it is somewhere"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52819"],["title","Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 2 of 2) (#1)"],["body","morning of the 22d of September, A.D. 1827, the angel of the Lord     delivered the records into my hands.      DESCRIPTION OF THE NEPHITE RECORD.      \"These records were engraven on plates which had the appearance     of gold; each plate was six inches wide and eight inches long,     and not quite so thick as common tin. They were filled with     engravings, in Egyptian characters, and bound together in a volume     as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the     whole. The volume was something near six inches in thickness, a     part of which was sealed. The characters on the unsealed part were     small, and beautifully engraved. The whole book exhibited many     marks of antiquity in its construction and much skill in the art     of engraving. With the records was found a curious instrument,     which the ancients called 'Urim and Thummim,' which consisted     of two transparent stones set in the rim of a bow fastened to     a breastplate. Through the medium of the Urim and Thummim I     translated the record by the gift and power of God.      \"In this important and interesting book the history of ancient     America is unfolded, from its first settlement by a colony that     came from the Tower of Babel, at the confusion of languages, to     the beginning of the fifth century of the Christian era. We are     informed by these records that America in ancient times had been     inhabited by two distinct races of people. The first was called     Jaredites and came directly from the Tower of Babel. The second     race came directly from the City of Jerusalem, about six hundred     years before Christ. They were principally Israelites, of the     descendants of Joseph. The Jaredites were destroyed about the time     that the Israelites came from Jerusalem, who succeeded them in the     inheritance of the country. The principal nation of the second race     fell in battle towards the close of the fourth century [A.D.].     The remnant are the Indians that now inhabit this country. This     book also tells us that our Savior made His appearance upon this     continent after His resurrection; that He planted the gospel here     in all its fulness, and richness, and power, and blessing; that     they had apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists;     the same order, the same priesthood, the same ordinances,     gifts, powers, and blessings, as were enjoyed on the Eastern     continent; that the people were cut off in consequence of their     transgressions; that the last of their prophets who existed among     them was commanded to write an abridgment of their prophecies,     history, etc., and to hide it up in the earth, and that it should     come forth and be united with the Bible for the accomplishment of     the purposes of God in the last days.\"  The book issued from the press sometime in the month of March, 1830. [A]  [Footnote A: For a more detailed account of the origin of the Book of Mormon, see the writer's work, \"New Witnesses for God,\" Vol. II, chs. iv and viii.]  From the first appearance of Joseph Smith's account of the origin of the Book of Mormon, there was felt the need of a counter theory of origin. The first to respond to this \"felt\" need was Alexander Campbell, founder of the \"Disciples\" or \"Christian\" Church. He assigned the book's origin straight to Joseph Smith, whom he accused of conscious fraud in \"foisting it upon the public as a revelation.\" This in 1831. Then came the Spaulding theory of origin by Hurlburt, Howe, _et al.,_ 1834; for which Mr. Campbell repudiated his first theory of the Joseph Smith authorship. In 1899 Lily Dougall in \"The Mormon Prophet,\" advanced her theory of the Prophet's \"self delusion,\" \"by the automatic freaks of a vigorous but undisciplined brain.\" This was supplemented in 1902 by Mr. I. Woodbridge Riley's theory of \"pure hallucination, honestly mistaken for inspired vision; with partly conscious and partly unconscious hypnotic powers over others.\" [B]  [Footnote B: Both the Dougall and Riley theories are considered in Vol. I. of _Defense of the Faith and the Saints_, pp. 42-62; and the older theories of the origin in _New Witness for God_, Vol. III, chas. xliv, xlv.]  Mr. Schroeder, however, will have none of these later theories; and although the finding of the Rev. Mr. Spauldings' \"Manuscript Found,\" by Professor Fairchild of Oberlin College, in 1884--details of which are given in the debate gave a serious set back to that theory, Mr. Schroeder deems the Spaulding theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon the only tenable counter theory advanced, and assuming the existence of another Spaulding manuscript _not found,_ and not likely to be found, he proceeds with his argument; to which I make answer, with what success the reader must judge.  B. H. ROBERTS.  Salt Lake City, October, 1911.    THE ORIGIN OF THE BOOK OF MORMON.  BY THEODORE SCHROEDER  I.  Every complete, critical discussion of the divine origin of the Book of Mormon naturally divides itself into three parts:--first, an examination as to the sufficiency of the evidence adduced in support of its miraculous and divine origin; second, an examination of the internal evidences of its origin, [1] such as its verbiage, its alleged history, chronology, archaeology, etc.; third, an accounting for its existence by purely human agency and upon a rational basis, remembering that Joseph Smith, the nominal founder and first prophet of Mormonism, was probably too ignorant to have produced the whole volume unaided. Under the last head, two theories have been advocated by non-Mormons. By one of these, conscious fraud has been imputed to Smith, and by the other, psychic mysteries have been explored [2] in an effort to supplant the conscious fraud by an unconscious self-deception.  [Footnote 1: Valuable contributions to this study are Lamb's \"Golden Bible\" and a pamphlet by Lamoni Call classifying two thousand corrections in the inspired grammar of the first edition of the Book of Mormon.]  [Footnote 2: The best effort along this line is Riley's \"The Founder of Mormonism.\" To me the conclusions are very unsatisfactory, because so many material considerations were overlooked by that author.]  In 1834, four years after its first appearance, an effort was made to show that the Book of Mormon was a plagiarism from an unpublished novel of Solomon Spaulding. For a long time this seemed the accepted theory of all non-Mormons. In the past fifteen years, apparently following in the lead of President Fairchild of Oberlin College, [3] all but two of the numerous writers upon the subject have asserted that the theory of the Spaulding manuscript origin of the Book of Mormon must be abandoned, and Mormons assert that only fools and knaves still profess belief in it. [4] With these last conclusions I am compelled to disagree.  [Footnote 3: President Fairchild, in the New York _Observer_ for February 5, 1885, that being immediately after his discovery of the Oberlin Manuscript, says: \"The theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon in the traditional manuscript of Solomon Spaulding will probably have to be relinquished. * * * Mr. Rice, myself, and others compared it with the Book of Mormon, and could detect no resemblance between the two in general or detail. * * * Some other explanation of the origin of the Book of Mormon must be found, if an explanation is required.\" (Reproduced in Whitney's \"History of Utah,\" 56. Talmage's \"Articles of Faith,\" 278.)  Ten years later Mr. Fairchild is not so brash in assuming the Oberlin Manuscript to be the only Spaulding Manuscript, and he certifies only that the Oberlin Manuscript \"is not the original of the Book of Mormon.\" (Letter dated Oct. 17, 1895, published in vol. lx., _Millennial Star,_ p. 697, Nov. 3, 1898. Talmage's \"Articles of Faith,\" 279.)  _Fairchild's Latest Statement._--In 1900 President Fairchild wrote the Rev. J. D. Nutting as follows:  \"With regard to the manuscript of Mr. Spaulding now in the library of Oberlin College, I have never stated, and know of no one who can state, that it is the only manuscript which Spaulding wrote, or that it is certainly the one which has been supposed to be the original of the Book of Mormon. The discovery of this MS. does not prove that there may not have been another, which became the basis of the Book of Mormon. The use which has been made of statements emanating from me as implying the contrary of the above is entirely unwarranted.  \"JAMES H. FAIRCHILD\"]  [Footnote 4: The _Deseret News_ editorially says this on July 19, 1900: \"The discovery of the manuscript written by Mr. Spaulding, and its deposit in the library at Oberlin College, O., * * * has so completely demolished the theory once relied upon by superficial minds that the Book of Mormon was concocted from that manuscript, that it has been entirely abandoned by all opponents of Mormonism except the densely ignorant or unscrupulously dishonest.\"  And this on May 14, 1901:  \"It is only the densely ignorant, the totally depraved and clergymen of different denominations afflicted with anti-Mormon rabies who still use the Spaulding story to account for the origin of the Book of Mormon.\"]  In setting forth my convictions and the reasons for them, I have undertaken nothing entirely new, but have only assigned myself the task of establishing as an historical fact what is now an abandoned and almost forgotten theory. This will be done by marshaling in its support a more complete array of the old evidences than has been heretofore made and the addition of new circumstantial evidence not heretofore used in this connection.  It will be shown that Solomon Spaulding was much interested in American antiquities; that he wrote a novel entitled the \"Manuscript Found,\" in which he attempted to account for the existence of the American Indian by giving him an Israelitish origin; that the first incomplete outline of this story, with many features peculiar to itself"]]]
