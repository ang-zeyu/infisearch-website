MIME          [_Tries to approach him affectionately._  My child, that ought to show thee That Mime is dear to thy heart.  SIEGFRIED  I said I could not bear thee; Forget not that so soon.  MIME          [_Recoils, and sits down again apart, opposite         Siegfried._]  The wildness that thou shouldst tame Is the cause, bad boy, of that. Young ones are always longing After their parents' nest; What we love we all long for, And so thou dost yearn for me; 'Tis plain thou lovest thy Mime,     And always must love him. What the old bird is to the young one, Feeding it in its nest Ere the fledgling can flutter, That is what careful, clever Mime To thy young life is,     And always must be.  SIEGFRIED  Well, Mime, being so clever, This one thing more also tell me:          [_Simply._      The birds sang together     So gaily in spring,  [Illustration: \"And there I learned                 What love was like\"                            See p. 11]          [_Tenderly._  The one alluring the other;     And thou didst say,     When I asked thee why, That they were wives with their husbands.      They chattered so sweetly,     Were never apart;     They builded a nest     In which they might brood;     The fluttering young ones     Came flying out, And both took care of the young.     The roes in the woods, too,     Rested in pairs, The wild wolves even, and foxes.     Food was found them and brought     By the father, The mother suckled the young ones.     And there I learned     What love was like;     A whelp from its mother     I never took.     But where hast thou, Mime,     A wife dear and loving, That I may call her mother?  MIME [_Angrily._      What dost thou mean?     Fool, thou art mad! Art thou then a bird or a fox?  SIEGFRIED      When I was a babe     Thou wert my nurse,     Made the mite clothing     To keep him warm;     But tell me, whence     Did the tiny mite come?     Could babe without mother     Be born to thee?  MIME [_Greatly embarrassed._      Thou must always     Trust what I tell thee.     I am thy father     And mother in one.  SIEGFRIED  Thou liest, filthy old fright! The resemblance 'twixt child and parent I often have seen for myself. I came to the limpid brook,     And the beasts and the trees     I saw reflected;     Sun and clouds too,     Just as they are, Were mirrored quite plain in the stream.     I also could spy     This face of mine,     And quite unlike thine     Seemed it to me;     As little alike     As a fish to a toad: And when had fish toad for its father?  MIME [_Very angrily._  How canst thou talk Such terrible stuff?  SIEGFRIED [_With increasing animation._      Listen! At last     I understand What in vain I pondered so long: Why I roam the woods And run to escape thee, Yet return home in the end.          [_He springs up._  I cannot go till thou tell me What father and mother were mine.  MIME  What father? What mother? Meaningless questions!  SIEGFRIED          [_Springs upon Mime, and seizes him by the throat._      To answer a question     Thou must be caught first;     Willingly     Thou never wilt speak;     Thou givest nothing     Unless forced to.     How to talk     I hardly had learned     Had it not by force     Been wrung from the wretch.     Come, out with it,     Mangy old scamp! Who are my father and mother?  [Illustration: Siegfried sees himself in the stream. See p. 12.]  MIME          [_After makings signs with his head and hands, is         released by Siegfried._  Dost want to kill me outright! Hands off, and the facts thou shalt hear, As far as known to myself.     O ungrateful     And graceless child, Now learn the cause of thy hatred!     Neither thy father     Nor kinsman I, And yet thou dost owe me thy life!     To me, thy one friend,     A stranger wert thou;     It was pity alone     Sheltered thee here; And this is all my reward. And I hoped for thanks like a fool!  A woman once I found Who wept in the forest wild; I helped her here to the cave, That by the fire I might warm her. The woman bore a child here; Sadly she gave it birth. She writhed about in pain; I helped her as I could. Bitter her plight; she died. But Siegfried lived and throve.  SIEGFRIED [_Slowly._  My poor mother died, then, through me?  MIME  To my care she commended thee; 'Twas willingly bestowed. The trouble Mime would take! The worry kind Mime endured!     \"When thou wert a babe     I was thy nurse....\"  SIEGFRIED  That story I often have heard. Now say, whence came the name       Siegfried?  MIME      'Twas thus that thy mother     Told me to name thee,     That thou mightst grow     To be strong and fair.     \"I made the mite clothing     To keep it warm....\"  SIEGFRIED  Now tell me, what name was my mother's?  MIME  In truth I hardly know.     \"Brought thee thy food,     Gave thee to drink....\"  SIEGFRIED  My mother's name thou must tell me.  MIME  Her name I forget. Yet wait! Sieglinde, that was the name borne By her who gave thee to me.     \"I kept thee as safe     As I keep my skin....\"  SIEGFRIED          [_With increasing urgency._  Next tell me, who was my father?  MIME [_Roughly._  Him I have never seen.  [Illustration: Mime finds the mother of Siegfried in the forest. See p. 13]  SIEGFRIED  But my mother told it thee, surely.  MIME      He fell in combat     Was all that she said.     She left the fatherless     Babe to my care.     \"And when thou wert grown     I waited on thee,     And made a bed     For thy slumber soft\"...  SIEGFRIED      Still, with thy tiresome     Starling song! That I may trust thy story, Convinced thou art not lying, Thou must produce some proof.  MIME  But what proof will convince thee?  SIEGFRIED  I trust thee not with my ears, I trust thee but with mine eyes: What witness speaks for thee?  MIME          [_After some thought takes from the place where         they are concealed the two pieces of a broken sword._  I got this from thy mother: For trouble, food, and service This was my sole reward. Behold, 'tis a splintered sword! She said 'twas borne by thy father In the fatal fight when he fell.  SIEGFRIED [_Enthusiastically._      And thou shalt forge     These fragments together, And furnish my rightful sword!     Up! Tarry not, Mime;     Quick to thy task!     If thou hast skill,     Thy cunning display.     Cheat me no more     With worthless trash;     These fragments alone     Henceforth I trust.     Lounge o'er thy work,     Weld it not true,     Trickily patching     The goodly steel, And thou shalt learn on thy limbs How metal best should be beat!     I swear that this day     The sword shall be mine; My weapon to-day I shall win!  MIME [_Alarmed._  What wouldst thou to-day with the sword?  SIEGFRIED      Leave the forest     For the wide world, Never more to return.     Ah, how fair     A thing is freedom! Nothing holds me or binds! No father have I here, And afar shall be my home; Thy hearth is not my house, Nor my covering thy roof.     Like the fish     Glad in the water,     Like the finch     Free in the heavens,     Off I will float,     Forth I will fly,     Like the wind o'er the wood     Wafted away, Thee, Mime, beholding no more!          [_He runs into the forest._  MIME [_Greatly alarmed._      Stop, boy! Stop, boy!     Whither away?     Hey! Siegfried!     Siegfried! Hey!          [_He looks after the retreating figure for some         time in astonishment; then he goes back to the         smithy and sits down behind the anvil._      He storms away!     And I sit here:     To crown my cares     Comes still this new one;     My plight is piteous indeed!     How help myself now?     How hold the boy here?     How lead the young madcap     To Fafner's lair?     And how weld the splinters     Of obstinate steel?     In no furnace fire     Can they be melted,     Nor can Mime's hammer     Cope with their hardness.          [_Shrilly._      The Nibelung's hate,     Need and sweat Cannot make Nothung whole, Never will weld it anew.          [_Sobbing, he sinks in despair on to a stool behind         the anvil._  WANDERER (WOTAN)          [_Enters from the wood by the door at the back of         the cave. He wears a long dark blue cloak, and, for         staff, carries a spear. On his head is a round,         broad-brimmed slouched hat._  All hail, cunning smith! A seat by thy hearth     Kindly grant     The wayworn guest.  MIME [_Starting up in alarm._      Who seeks for me here     In desolate woods, Finds my home in the forest wild?  WANDERER [_Approaching very slowly step by step._  Wanderer names me the world, smith. From far I have come;     On the earth's back ranging,     Much I have roamed.  MIME      If Wanderer named,     Pray wander from here Without halting for rest.  WANDERER  Good men grudge me not welcome; Many gifts I have received.     By bad hearts only     Is evil feared.  MIME      Ill fate always     Dwelt by my side; Thou wouldst not add to it, surely!  WANDERER [_Slowly coming nearer and nearer._      Always searching,     Much have I seen;     Things of weight     Have told to many;     Oft have rid men     Of their troubles, Gnawing and carking cares.  MIME      Though thou hast searched,     And though much thou hast found, I need neither seeker nor finder.     Lonely am I,     And lone would be; Idlers I harbour not here.  WANDERER [_Again coming a little nearer._      There were many     Thought they were wise,     Yet what they needed     Knew not at all;     Useful lore was     Theirs for the asking, Wisdom was their reward.  MIME          [_More and more anxious as he sees the Wanderer         approach._      Idle knowledge     Some may covet; I know enough for my needs.          [_The Wanderer reaches the hearth._      My own wits suffice,     I want no more, So, wise one, keep on thy way.  WANDERER [_Sitting down at the hearth._      Nay, here at thy hearth     I vow by my head To answer all thou shalt ask.     My head is thine,     'Tis forfeit to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49507"],["title","Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods (#2)"],["body","hee,     Unless I can give     Answers good, Deftly redeeming the pledge.  MIME          [_Who has been staring at the Wanderer         open-mouthed, now shrinks back; aside, dejectedly._  Now how to get rid of the spy? The questions asked must be artful.          [_He summons up courage for an assumption of         sternness; aloud._      Thy head for thy     Lodging pays: 'Tis pawned; now seek to redeem it.     Three the questions     Thou shalt be asked.  WANDERER  Thrice then I must answer.  MIME [_Pulls himself together and reflects._      Since, far on the back     Of the wide earth roving, Thy feet have ranged o'er the world,     Come, answer me this:     Tell me what race Dwells in the earth's deep gorges.  WANDERER      In the depths of earth The Nibelungs have their home; Nibelheim is their land.     Black elves they all are;     Black Alberich Once was their ruler and lord.     He subdued the busy     Folk by a ring Gifted with magical might;     And they piled up     Shimmering gold,     Precious, fine-wrought, To win him the world and its glory.  Proceed with thy questions, dwarf.  MIME          [_Sinks into deeper and deeper meditation._      Thou knowest much,     Wanderer, Of the hidden depths of earth.     Now, answer me this:     Tell me what race Breathes on earth's back and moves there.  WANDERER      On the earth's broad back The race of the giants arose; Riesenheim is their land.     Fasolt and Fafner,     The rude folk's rulers, Envied the Nibelung's might.     So his wonderful hoard     They won for themselves, And with it gained the ring too.     The brothers quarrelled     About the ring,     And slain was Fasolt.     In dragon's form Fafner now watches the hoard.  One question threatens me still.  MIME [_Quite lost in thought._      Much, Wanderer,     Thou dost know Of the earth's back rude and rugged.     Now answer aright:     Tell me what race Dwells above in the clouds.  WANDERER      Above in the clouds     Dwell the Immortals; Walhall is their home.     They are light-spirits;     Light-Alberich, Wotan, rules as their lord.     From the world-ash-tree's     Holiest bough once Wotan made him a shaft.     Though the stem rot,     The spear shall endure,     And with that spear-point Wotan rules the world.     Trustworthy runes     Of holy treaties Deep in the shaft he cut.     Who wields the spear     Carried by Wotan     The haft of the world Holds in his hand.     Before him kneels     The Nibelung host;     The giants, tamed,     Bow to his will. All must obey, and for ever, The spear's eternal lord.          [_He strikes the ground with the spear as if by         accident, and a low growl of thunder is heard, by         which Mime is violently alarmed._  Confess now, cunning dwarf, Are not my answers right, And is not my head redeemed?  MIME          [_After attentively watching the Wanderer with the         spear, becomes very frightened, seeks in a confused         manner for his tools, and looks timidly aside._      Both thou hast won,     Wager and head; Thy way now, Wanderer, go.  WANDERER      Knowledge useful to thee     Thou wert to ask for; Forfeit my head if I failed.     Forfeit be thine,     Knowest thou not The thing it would serve thee to know.     Greeting thou     Gavest me not;     My head into thy hand     I gave That I might rest by thy hearth.     By wager fair     Forfeit thy head,     Canst thou not answer     Three things when asked; So sharpen well, Mime, thy wits!  [Illustration:    \"In dragon's form               Fafner now watches the hoard\"                            --See p. 21]  MIME          [_Very much frightened, and after much hesitation,         at last composes himself with timid submission._      Long it is     Since I left my land;     Long it seems to me     Since I was born. I saw here the eye of Wotan Shine, peering into my cave;     His glance dazes     My mother-wit. But well were it now to be wise. Come then, Wanderer, ask. Perhaps fortune will favour The dwarf, and redeem his head.  WANDERER [_Comfortably sitting down again._      Then first, honest dwarf,     Answer this question: Tell the name of the race That Wotan treats most harshly,          [_Very softly, but audibly._  And yet loves beyond all the rest.  MIME [_With more cheerfulness._      Though unlearnèd     In heroes' kinship, This question I answer with ease.     The Wälsungs are Wotan's     Chosen stock,     By him begotten     And loved with passion, Though they are shown no grace.     Siegmund and Sieglinde     Born were to Wälse,     A wild and desperate     Twin-born pair; Siegfried had they as son, The strongest shoot from the tree.     My head, say, is it     Still, Wanderer, mine?  WANDERER [_Pleasantly._      How well thou knowest     And namest the race! Rogue, I see thou art clever.     The foremost question     Thou hast solved; The second answer me, dwarf.     A crafty Niblung     Shelters Siegfried, Hoping he will slay Fafner, That the dwarf may be lord of the hoard, The ring being his.     Say, what sword,     If Fafner to fall is, Must be by Siegfried swung?  MIME          [_Forgetting his present situation more and more,         rubs his hands joyfully._      Nothung is     The name of the sword;     Into an ash-tree's stem     Wotan struck it; One only might bear it: He who could draw it forth.     The strongest heroes     Tried it and failed;     Only by Siegmund     Was it done; Well he fought with the sword Till on Wotan's spear it was split.     By a crafty smith     Are the fragments kept,     For he knows that alone     With the Wotan sword A brave and foolish boy, Siegfried, can slay the foe.          [_Much pleased._      A second time     My head have I saved?   [Illustration: Mime and the Wanderer. See p. 17]   WANDERER [_Laughing_.      The wisest of wise ones     Thou must be, surely; Who else could so clever be!     But wouldst thou by craft     Employ the boy-hero As instrument of thy purpose,     With one question more     I threaten thee.     Tell me, thou artful     Armourer, Whose skill from the doughty splinters Nothung the sword shall fashion.  MIME [_Starts up in great terror._      The splinters! The sword!     Alas! my head reels!     What shall I do?     What can I say?     Accursèd sword!     I was mad to steal it!     A perilous pass     It has brought me to.     Always too hard     To yield to my hammer!     Rivet, solder--     Useless are both.          [_He throws his tools about as if he had gone         crazy, and breaks out in utter despair._      The cleverest smith     Living has failed;     And, that being so,     Who shall succeed? How rede aright such a riddle?  WANDERER [_Has risen quietly from the hearth._  Three things thou wert to ask me; Thrice was I to reply.     Thy questions were     Of far-off things, But what stood here at thy hand-- Needed much--that was forgot,     Now that I guess it,     Thou goest crazed,     And won by me     Is the cunning one's head. Now, Fafner's dauntless subduer, Hear, thou death-doomed dwarf.     By him who knows not     How to fear Nothung shall be forged.          [_Mime stares at him; he turns to go._      So ward thy head     Well from to-day. I leave it forfeit to him Who has never learned to fear.          [_He turns away smiling, and disappears quickly         in the wood. Mime has sunk on to the bench         overwhelmed._  MIME          [_Stares before him into the sunlit wood, and         begins to tremble more and more violently._      Accursèd light!     The air is on fire!     What flickers and flashes?     What buzzes and whirs?     What sways there and swings     And circles about?     What glitters and gleams     In the sun's hot glow?     What rustles and hums     And rings so loud?     With roll and roar     It crashes this way!     It bursts through the wood,     Making for me!          [_He rises up in terror._      Its jaws are wide open,     Eager for prey;     The dragon will catch me!     Fafner! Fafner!          [_He sinks shrieking behind the anvil._  SIEGFRIED          [_Behind the scenes, is heard breaking from the         thicket._      Ho there! Thou idler!     Is the work finished?          [_He enters the cave._  Quick, come show me the sword.          [_He pauses in surprise._      Where hides the smith?     Has he made off? Hey, there! Mime, thou coward! Where art thou? Where hidest thou?  MIME          [_In a small voice, from behind the anvil._      'Tis thou then, child?     Art thou alone?  SIEGFRIED [_Laughing._      Under the anvil? Why, what doest thou there? Wert thou grinding the sword?  MIME [_Comes forward, greatly upset and confused._      The sword? The sword?     How could I weld it?          [_Half aside._      By him who knows not     How to fear Nothung shall be forged.     Too wise am I     To attempt such work.  SIEGFRIED [_Violently._      Wilt thou speak plainly     Or must I help thee?  MIME [_As before._  Where shall I turn in my need?     My wily head     Wagered and lost is,          [_Staring before him._  And forfeit to him it will fall Who has never learned to fear.  SIEGFRIED [_Vehemently._      Dost thou by shuffling     Seek to escape?  MIME [_Gradually recovering himself._      Small need to fly     Him who knows fear! But that lesson was one never taught thee.     A fool, I forgot     The one great thing;     What thou wert taught     Was to love me, And alas! the task proved hard. Now how shall I teach thee to fear?  SIEGFRIED [_Seizes him._      Hey! Must I help thee?     What work hast thou done?  MIME      Concerned for thy good,     In thought I was sitting: Something of weight I would teach thee.  SIEGFRIED [_Laughing._      'Twas under the seat     That thou wert sitting; What weighty thing foundest thou there?  MIME          [_Recovering himself more and more._  Down there I learned how to fear, That I might teach thee, dullard.  SIEGFRIED [_With quiet wonder._      This fear then, what is it?  MIME  "]]]
