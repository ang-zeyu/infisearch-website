I’ve a great mind to put you in the lockup.”  “Oh, don’t, please don’t, Mr. Rogers!” implored Peter, quite panic-stricken.  “Will you promise never to stone another cat?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Then go about your business.”  Peter lost no time, but scuttled up the street with his companion.  “I am much obliged to you for protecting Flora’s cat,” then said the constable to Gilbert.  “You are quite welcome, sir. I won’t see any animal abused if I can help it.”  “You are right there.”  “Wasn’t that boy Peter Cook?”  “Yes. Don’t you know him?”  “No; but I know his stepbrother, Carl.”  “A different sort of boy! Have you come to visit him?”  “No; he is visiting me. In fact, he has left home, because he could not stand his step-mother’s ill-treatment, and I have come to see his father in his behalf.”  “He has had an uncomfortable home. Dr. Crawford is an invalid, and very much under the influence of his wife, who seems to have a spite against Carl, and is devoted to that young cub to whom you have given a lesson. Does Carl want to come back?”  “No; he wants to strike out for himself, but I told him it was no more than right that he should receive some help from his father.”  “That is true enough. For nearly all the doctor’s money came to him through Carl’s mother.”  “I am afraid Peter and his mother won’t give me a very cordial welcome after what has happened this morning. I wish I could see the doctor alone.”  “So you can, for there he is coming up the street.”  Gilbert looked in the direction indicated, and his glance fell on a thin, fragile-looking man, evidently an invalid, with a weak, undecided face, who was slowly approaching.  The boy advanced to meet him, and, taking off his hat, asked politely: “Is this Dr. Crawford?”    CHAPTER IV.  AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE.   Dr. Crawford stopped short, and eyed Gilbert attentively.  “I don’t know you,” he said, in a querulous tone.  “I am a schoolmate of your son, Carl. My name is Gilbert Vance.”  “If you have come to see my son you will be disappointed. He has treated me in a shameful manner. He left home yesterday morning, and I don’t know where he is.”  “I can tell you, sir. He is staying--for a day or two--at my father’s house.”  “Where is that?” asked Dr. Crawford, his manner showing that he was confused.  “In Warren, thirteen miles from here.”  “I know the town. What induced him to go to your house? Have you encouraged him to leave home?” inquired Dr. Crawford, with a look of displeasure.  “No, sir. It was only by chance that I met him a mile from our home. I induced him to stay overnight.”  “Did you bring me any message from him?” “No, sir, except that he is going to strike out for himself, as he thinks his home an unhappy one.”  “That is his own fault. He has had enough to eat and enough to wear. He has had as comfortable a home as yourself.”  “I don’t doubt that, but he complains that his stepmother is continually finding fault with him, and scolding him.”  “He provokes her to do it. He is a headstrong, obstinate boy.”  “He never had that reputation at school, sir. We all liked him.”  “I suppose you mean to imply that I am in fault?” said the doctor, warmly.  “I don’t think you know how badly Mrs. Crawford treats Carl, sir.”  “Of course, of course. That is always said of a stepmother.”  “Not always, sir. I have a stepmother myself, and no own mother could treat me better.”  “You are probably a better boy.”  “I can’t accept the compliment. I hope you’ll excuse me saying it, Dr. Crawford, but if my stepmother treated me as Carl says Mrs. Crawford treats him I wouldn’t stay in the house another day.”  “Really, this is very annoying,” said Dr. Crawford, irritably. “Have you come here from Warren to say this?”  “No, sir, not entirely.”  “Perhaps Carl wants me to receive him back. I will do so if he promises to obey his stepmother.”  “That he won’t do, I am sure.”  “Then what is the object of your visit?”  “To say that Carl wants and intends to earn his own living. But it is hard for a boy of his age, who has never worked, to earn enough at first to pay for his board and clothes. He asks, or, rather, I ask for him, that you will allow him a small sum, say three or four dollars a week, which is considerably less than he must cost you at home, for a time until he gets on his feet.”  “I don’t know,” said Dr. Crawford, in a vacillating tone. “I don’t think Mrs. Crawford would approve this.”  “It seems to me you are the one to decide, as Carl is your own son. Peter must cost you a good deal more.”  “Do you know Peter?”  “I have met him,” answered Gilbert, with a slight smile.  “I don’t know what to say. You may be right. Peter does cost me more.”  “And Carl is entitled to be treated as well as he.”  “I think I ought to speak to Mrs. Crawford about it. And, by the way, I nearly forgot to say that she charges Carl with taking money from her bureau drawer before he went away. It was a large sum, too--twenty-five dollars.”  “That is false!” exclaimed Gilbert, indignantly. “I am surprised that you should believe such a thing of your own son.”  “Mrs. Crawford says she has proof,” said the doctor, hesitating.  “Then what has he done with the money? I know that he has but thirty-seven cents with him at this time, and he only left home yesterday. If the money has really been taken, I think I know who took it.”  “Who?”  “Peter Cook. He looks mean enough for anything.”  “What right have you to speak so of Peter?”  “Because I caught him stoning a cat this morning. He would have killed the poor thing if I had not interfered. I consider that worse than taking money.”  “I--I don’t know what to say. I can’t agree to anything till I have spoken with Mrs. Crawford. Did you say that Carl had but thirty seven cents?”  “Yes, sir; I presume you don’t want him to starve?”  “No, of course not. He is my son, though he has behaved badly. Here, give him that!” and Dr. Crawford drew a ten-dollar bill from his wallet, and handed it to Gilbert.  “Thank you, sir. This money will be very useful. Besides, it will show Carl that his father is not wholly indifferent to him.”  “Of course not. Who says that I am a bad father?” asked Dr. Crawford, peevishly.  “I don’t think, sir, there would be any difficulty between you and Carl if you had not married again.”  “Carl has no right to vex Mrs. Crawford. Besides, he can’t agree with Peter.”  “Is that his fault or Peter’s?” asked Gilbert, significantly.  “I am not acquainted with the circumstances, but Mrs. Crawford says that Carl is always bullying Peter.”  “He never bullied anyone at school.”  “Is there anything, else you want?”  “Yes, sir; Carl only took away a little underclothing in a gripsack. He would like his woolen clothes put in his trunk, and to have it sent----”  “Where?”  “Perhaps it had better be sent to my house. There are one or two things in his room also that he asked me to get.”  “Why didn’t he come himself?”  “Because he thought it would be unpleasant for him to meet Mrs. Crawford. They would be sure to quarrel.”  “Well, perhaps he is right,” said Dr. Crawford, with an air of relief. “About the allowance, I shall have to consult my wife. Will you come with me to the house?”  “Yes, sir; I should like to have the matter settled to-day, so that Carl will know what to depend upon.”  Gilbert rather dreaded the interview he was likely to have with Mrs. Crawford; but he was acting for Carl, and his feelings of friendship were strong.  So he walked beside Dr. Crawford till they reached the tasteful dwelling occupied as a residence by Carl and his father.  “How happy Carl could be here, if he had a stepmother like mine,”  Gilbert thought.  They went up to the front door, which was opened for them by a servant.  “Jane, is Mrs. Crawford in?” asked the doctor.  “No, sir; not just now. She went to the village to do some shopping.”  “Is Peter in?”  “No, sir.”  “Then you will have to wait till they return.”  “Can’t I go up to Carl’s room and be packing his things?”  “Yes, I think you may. I don’t think Mrs. Crawford would object.”  “Good heavens! Hasn’t the man a mind of his own?” thought Gilbert.  “Jane, you may show this young gentleman up to Master Carl’s room, and give him the key of his trunk. He is going to pack his clothes.”  “When is Master Carl coming back?” asked Jane.  “I--I don’t know. I think he will be away for a time.”  “I wish it was Peter instead of him,” said Jane, in a low voice, only audible to Gilbert.  She showed Gilbert the way upstairs, while the doctor went to his study.  “Are you a friend of Master Carl’s?” asked Jane, as soon as they were alone.  “Yes, Jane.”  “And where is he?”  “At my house.”  “Is he goin’ to stay there?”  “For a short time. He wants to go out into the world and make his own living.”  “And no wonder--poor boy! It’s hard times he had here.”  “Didn’t Mrs. Crawford treat him well?” asked Gilbert, with curiosity  “Is it trate him well? She was a-jawin’ an’ a-jawin’ him from mornin’ till night. Ugh, but she’s an ugly cr’atur’!”  “How about Peter?”  “He’s just as bad--the m’anest bye I iver set eyes on. It would do me good to see him flogged.”  She chatted a little longer with Gilbert, helping him to find Carl’s clothes, when suddenly a shrill voice was heard calling her from below.  “Shure, it’s the madam!” said Jane, shrugging her shoulders. “I expect she’s in a temper;” and she rose from her knees and hurried downstairs.    CHAPTER V.  CARL’S STEPMOTHER.   Five minutes later, as Gilbert was closing the trunk, Jane reappeared.  “The doctor and Mrs. Crawford would like to see you downstairs,” she said.  Gilbert followed Jane into the library, where Dr. Crawford and his wife were seated. He looked with interest at the woman who had made home so disagreeable to Carl, and was instantly prejudiced against her. She was light complexioned, with very light-brown hair, cold, gray eyes, and a disagreeable expression which seemed natural to her.  “My dear,” said the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5301"],["title","The Imperialist (#1)"],["body"," Polite society, to return to it, preferred the alternative of staying at home and mowing the lawn or drinking raspberry vinegar on its own beflagged verandah; looking forward in the afternoon to the lacrosse match. There was nearly always a lacrosse match on the Queen’s Birthday, and it was the part of elegance to attend and encourage the home team, as well as that of small boys, with broken straw hats, who sneaked an entrance, and were more enthusiastic than anyone. It was “a quarter” to get in, so the spectators were naturally composed of persons who could afford the quarter, and persons like the young Flannigans and Finnigans, who absolutely couldn’t, but who had to be there all the same. Lorne and Advena Murchison never had the quarter, so they witnessed few lacrosse matches, though they seldom failed to refresh themselves by a sight of the players after the game when, crimson and perspiring, but still glorious in striped jerseys, their lacrosses and running shoes slung over one shoulder, these heroes left the field.  The Birthday I am thinking of, with Mrs Murchison as a central figure in the kitchen, peeling potatoes for dinner, there was a lacrosse match of some importance for the Fox County Championship and the Fox County Cup as presented by the Member for the South Riding. Mrs Murchison remains the central figure, nevertheless, with her family radiating from her, gathered to help or to hinder in one of those domestic crises which arose when the Murchisons were temporarily deprived of a “girl.”  Everybody was subject to them in Elgin, everybody had to acknowledge and face them. Let a new mill be opened, and it didn’t matter what you paid her or how comfortable you made her, off she would go, and you might think yourself lucky if she gave a week’s warning. Hard times shut down the mills and brought her back again; but periods of prosperity were very apt to find the ladies of Elgin where I am compelled to introduce Mrs Murchison--in the kitchen. “You’d better get up--the girl’s gone,”  Lorne had stuck his head into his sister’s room to announce, while yet the bells were ringing and the rifles of the local volunteers were spitting out the feu de joie. “I’ve lit the fire an’ swep’ out the dining-room. You tell mother. Queen’s Birthday, too--I guess Lobelia’s about as mean as they’re made!” And the Murchisons had descended to face the situation. Lorne had by then done his part, and gone out into the chromatic possibilities of the day; but the sense of injury he had communicated to Advena in her bed remained and expanded. Lobelia, it was felt, had scurvily manipulated the situation--her situation, it might have been put, if any Murchison had been in the temper for jesting. She had taken unjustifiable means to do a more unjustifiable thing, to secure for herself an improper and unlawful share of the day’s excitements, transferring her work, by the force of circumstances, to the shoulders of other people since, as Mrs Murchison remarked, somebody had to do it. Nor had she her mistress testified the excuse of fearing unreasonable confinement. “I told her she might go when she had done her dishes after dinner,” said Mrs Murchison, “and then she had only to come back at six and get tea--what’s getting tea? I advised her to finish her ironing yesterday, so as to be free of it today; and she said she would be very glad to. Now, I wonder if she DID finish it!” and Mrs Murchison put down her pan of potatoes with a thump to look in the family clothes basket. “Not she! Five shirts and ALL the coloured things. I call it downright deceit!”  “I believe I know the reason she’ll SAY,” said Advena. “She objects to rag carpet in her bedroom. She told me so.”  “Rag carpet--upon my word!” Mrs Murchison dropped her knife to exclaim. “It’s what her betters have to do with! I’ve known the day when that very piece of rag carpet--sixty balls there were in it and every one I sewed with my own fingers--was the best I had for my spare room, with a bit of ingrain in the middle. Dear me!” she went on with a smile that lightened the whole situation, “how proud I was of that performance! She didn’t tell ME she objected to rag carpet!”  “No, Mother,” Advena agreed, “she knew better.”  They were all there in the kitchen, supporting their mother, and it seems an opportunity to name them. Advena, the eldest, stood by the long kitchen table washing the breakfast cups in “soft” soap and hot water. The soft soap--Mrs Murchison had a barrelful boiled every spring in the back yard, an old colonial economy she hated to resign--made a fascinating brown lather with iridescent bubbles. Advena poured cupfuls of it from on high to see the foam rise, till her mother told her for mercy’s sake to get on with those dishes. She stood before a long low window, looking out into the garden and the light, filtering through apple branches on her face showed her strongly featured and intelligent for fourteen. Advena was named after one grandmother; when the next girl came Mrs Murchison, to make an end of the matter, named it Abigail, after the other. She thought both names outlandish and acted under protest, but hoped that now everybody would be satisfied. Lorne came after Advena, at the period of a naive fashion of christening the young sons of Canada in the name of her Governor-General. It was a simple way of attesting a loyal spirit, but with Mrs Murchison more particular motives operated. The Marquis of Lorne was not only the deputy of the throne, he was the son-in-law of a good woman of whom Mrs Murchison thought more, and often said it, for being the woman she was than for being twenty times a Queen; and he had made a metrical translation of the Psalms, several of which were included in the revised psalter for the use of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, from which the whole of Knox Church sang to the praise of God every Sunday. These were circumstances that weighed with Mrs Murchison, and she called her son after the Royal representative, feeling that she was doing well for him in a sense beyond the mere bestowal of a distinguished and a euphonious name, though that, as she would have willingly acknowledged, was “well enough in its place.”  We must take this matter of names seriously; the Murchisons always did. Indeed, from the arrival of a new baby until the important Sunday of the christening, nothing was discussed with such eager zest and such sustained interest as the name he should get--there was a fascinating list at the back of the dictionary--and to the last minute it was problematical. In Stella’s case, Mrs Murchison actually changed her mind on the way to church; and Abby, who had sat through the sermon expecting Dorothy Maud, which she thought lovely, publicly cried with disappointment. Stella was the youngest, and Mrs Murchison was thankful to have a girl at last whom she could name without regard to her own relations or anybody else’s. I have skipped about a good deal, but I have only left out two, the boys who came between Abby and Stella. In their names the contemporary observer need not be too acute to discover both an avowal and to some extent an enforcement of Mr Murchison’s political views; neither an Alexander Mackenzie nor an Oliver Mowat could very well grow up into anything but a sound Liberal in that part of the world without feeling himself an unendurable paradox. To christen a baby like that was, in a manner, a challenge to public attention; the faint relaxation about the lips of Dr Drummond--the best of the Liberals himself, though he made a great show of keeping it out of the pulpit--recognized this, and the just perceptible stir of the congregation proved it. Sonorously he said it. “Oliver Mowat, I baptize thee in the Name of the Father--” The compliment should have all the impressiveness the rite could give it, while the Murchison brothers and sisters, a-row in the family pew, stood on one foot with excitement as to how Oliver Mowat would take the drops that defined him. The verdict was, on the way home, that he behaved splendidly. Alexander Mackenzie, the year before, had roared.  He was weeping now, at the age of seven, silently, but very copiously, behind the woodpile. His father had finally cuffed him for importunity; and the world was no place for a just boy, who asked nothing but his rights. Only the woodpile, friendly mossy logs unsplit, stood inconscient and irresponsible for any share in his black circumstances; and his tears fell among the lichens of the stump he was bowed on till, observing them, he began to wonder whether he could cry enough to make a pond there, and was presently disappointed to find the source exhausted. The Murchisons were all imaginative.  The others, Oliver and Abby and Stella, still “tormented.” Poor Alec’s rights--to a present of pocket-money on the Queen’s Birthday--were common ones, and almost statutory. How their father, sitting comfortably with his pipe in the flickering May shadows under the golden pippin, reading the Toronto paper, could evade his liability in the matter was unfathomable to the Murchisons; it was certainly illiberal; they had a feeling that it was illegal. A little teasing was generally necessary, but the resistance today had begun to look ominous and Alec, as we know, too temerarious, had retired in disorder to the woodpile.  Oliver was wiping Advena’s dishes. He exercised himself ostentatiously upon a plate, standing in the door to be within earshot of his father.  “Eph Wheeler,” he informed his family, “Eph Wheeler, he’s got twenty-five cents, an’ a English sixpence, an’ a Yankee nickel. An’ Mr Wheeler’s only a common working man, a lot poorer’n we are.”  Mr Murchison removed his pipe from his lips in order, apparently, to follow unimpeded the trend of the Dominion’s leading article. Oliver eyed him anxiously. “Do, Father,” he continued in logical sequence. “Aw do.”  “Make him, Mother,” said Abby indignantly. “It’s the Queen’s BIRTHDAY!”  “Time enough when the"]]]
