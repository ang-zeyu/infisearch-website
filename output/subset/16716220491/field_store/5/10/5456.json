What is the priest to him?\"  For a moment he reflected, then he struck his hand against his forehead.  \"Fool that I am!\"  he exclaimed vehemently.  \"Child that I am! of course, of course; I see it all.  Ani asked for Bent-Anat's hand, and she--now that I love you, Uarda, I understand what ails her.  Away with deceit! I will tell you no more lies, Uarda.  I am no page of honor to Bent-Anat; I am her brother, and king Rameses' own son.  Do not cover your face with your hands, Uarda, for if I had not seen your mother's jewel, and if I were not only a prince, but Horus himself, the son of Isis, I must have loved you, and would not have given you up.  But now other things have to be done besides lingering with you; now I will show you that I am a man, now that Pentaur is to be saved.  Farewell, Uarda, and think of me!\"  He would have hurried off, but Scherau held him by the robe, and said timidly: Thou sayst thou art Rameses' son.  Hekt spoke of him too.  She compared him to our moulting hawk.\"  \"She shall soon feel the talons of the royal eagle,\" cried Rameri.  \"Once more, farewell!\"  He gave Uarda his hand, she pressed it passionately to her lips, but he drew it away, kissed her forehead, and was gone.  The maiden looked after him pale and speechless.  She saw another man hastening towards her, and recognizing him as her father, she went quickly to meet him.  The soldier had come to take leave of her, he had to escort some prisoners.  \"To Chennu?\"  asked Uarda.  \"No, to the north,\" replied the man.  His daughter now related what she had heard, and asked whether he could help the priest, who had saved her.  \"If I had money, if I had money!\"  muttered the soldier to himself.  \"We have some,\" cried Uarda;  she told him of Nebsecht's gift, and said: \"Take me over the Nile, and in two hours you will have enough to make a man rich.       [It may be observed that among the Egyptian women were qualified to      own and dispose of property.  For example a papyrus (vii) in the      Louvre contains an agreement between Asklepias (called Semmuthis),      the daughter or maid-servant of a corpse-dresser of Thebes, who is      the debtor, and Arsiesis, the creditor, the son of a kolchytes; both      therefore are of the same rank as Uarda.]  But no; I cannot leave my sick grandmother.  You yourself take the ring, and remember that Pentaur is being punished for having dared to protect us.\"  \"I remember it,\" said the soldier.  \"I have but one life, but I will willingly give it to save his.  I cannot devise schemes, but I know something, and if it succeeds he need not go to the gold-mines.  I will put the wine-flask aside--give me a drink of water, for the next few hours I must keep a sober head.\"  \"There is the water, and I will pour in a mouthful of wine.  Will you come back and bring me news?\"  \"That will not do, for we set sail at midnight, but if some one returns to you with the ring you will know that what I propose has succeeded.\"  Uarda went into the hut, her father followed her; he took leave of his sick mother and of his daughter.  When they went out of doors again, he said: \"You have to live on the princess's gift till I return, and I do not want half of the physician's present.  But where is your pomegranate blossom?\"  \"I have picked it and preserved it in a safe place.\"  \"Strange things are women!\"  muttered the bearded man; he tenderly kissed his child's forehead, and returned to the Nile down the road by which he had come.  The prince meanwhile had hurried on, and enquired in the harbor of the Necropolis where the vessel destined for Chennu was lying--for the ships loaded with prisoners were accustomed to sail from this side of the river, starting at night.  Then he was ferried over the river, and hastened to Bent-Anat.  He found her and Nefert in unusual excitement, for the faithful chamberlain had learned--through some friends of the king in Ani's suite--that the Regent had kept back all the letters intended for Syria, and among them those of the royal family.  A lord in waiting, who was devoted to the king, had been encouraged by the chamberlain to communicate to Bent-Anat other things, which hardly allowed any doubts as to the ambitious projects of her uncle; she was also exhorted to be on her guard with Nefert, whose mother was the confidential adviser of the Regent.  Bent-Anat smiled at this warning, and sent at once a message to Ani to inform him that she was ready to undertake the pilgrimage to the \"Emerald-Hathor,\" and to be purified in the sanctuary of that Goddess.  She purposed sending a message to her father from thence, and if he permitted it, joining him at the camp.  She imparted this plan to her friend, and Nefert thought any road best that would take her to her husband.  Rameri was soon initiated into all this, and in return he told them all he had learned, and let Bent-Anat guess that he had read her secret.  So dignified, so grave, were the conduct and the speech of the boy who had so lately been an overhearing mad-cap, that Bent-Anat thought to herself that the danger of their house had suddenly ripened a boy into a man.  She had in fact no objection to raise to his arrangements.  He proposed to travel after sunset, with a few faithful servants on swift horses as far as Keft, and from thence ride fast across the desert to the Red Sea, where they could take a Phoenician ship, and sail to Aila.  From thence they would cross the peninsula of Sinai, and strive to reach the Egyptian army by forced marches, and make the king acquainted with Ani's criminal attempts.  To Bent-Anat was given the task of rescuing Pentaur, with the help of the faithful chamberlain.  Money was fortunately not wanting, as the high treasurer was on their side.  All depended on their inducing the captain to stop at Chennu; the poet's fate would there, at the worst, be endurable.  At the same time, a trustworthy messenger was to be sent to the governor of Chennu, commanding him in the name of the king to detain every ship that might pass the narrows of Chennu by night, and to prevent any of the prisoners that had been condemned to the quarries from being smuggled on to Ethiopia.  Rameri took leave of the two women, and he succeeded in leaving Thebes unobserved.  Bent-Anat knelt in prayer before the images of her mother in Osiris, of Hathor, and of the guardian Gods of her house, till the chamberlain returned, and told her that he had persuaded the captain of the ship to stop at Chennu, and to conceal from Ani that he had betrayed his charge.  The princess breathed more freely, for she had come to a resolution that if the chamberlain had failed in his mission, she would cross over to the Necropolis forbid the departure of the vessel, and in the last extremity rouse the people, who were devoted to her, against Ani.  The following morning the Lady Katuti craved permission of the princess to see her daughter.  Bent-Anat did not show herself to the widow, whose efforts failed to keep her daughter from accompanying the princess on her journey, or to induce her to return home.  Angry and uneasy, the indignant mother hastened to Ani, and implored him to keep Nefert at home by force; but the Regent wished to avoid attracting attention, and to let Bent-Anat set out with a feeling of complete security.  \"Do not be uneasy,\" he said.  \"I will give the ladies a trustworthy escort, who will keep them at the Sanctuary of the 'Emerald-Hathor' till all is settled.  There you can deliver Nefert to Paaker, if you still like to have him for a son-in-law after hearing several things that I have learned.  As for me, in the end I may induce my haughty niece to look up instead of down; I may be her second love, though for that matter she certainly is not my first.\"  On the following day the princess set out.  Ani took leave of her with kindly formality, which she returned with coolness.  The priesthood of the temple of Amon, with old Bek en Chunsu at their head, escorted her to the harbor.  The people on the banks shouted Bent-Anat's name with a thousand blessings, but many insulting words were to be heard also.  The pilgrim's Nile-boat was followed by two others, full of soldiers, who accompanied the ladies \"to protect them.\"  The south-wind filled the sails, and carried the little procession swiftly down the stream.  The princess looked now towards the palace of her fathers, now towards the tombs and temples of the Necropolis.  At last even the colossus of Anienophis disappeared, and the last houses of Thebes.  The brave maiden sighed deeply, and tears rolled down her checks.  She felt as if she were flying after a lost battle, and yet not wholly discouraged, but hoping for future victory.  As she turned to go to the cabin, a veiled girl stepped up to her, took the veil from her face, and said: \"Pardon me, princess; I am Uarda, whom thou didst run over, and to whom thou hast since been so good.  My grandmother is dead, and I am quite alone.  I slipped in among thy maid-servants, for I wish to follow thee, and to obey all thy commands.  Only do not send me away.\"  \"Stay, dear child,\" said the princess, laying her hand on her hair.  Then, struck by its wonderful beauty, she remembered her brother, and his wish to place a rose in Uarda's shining tresses.     CHAPTER XXXIV.  Two months had past since Bent-Anat's departure from Thebes, and the imprisonment of Pentaur.  Ant-Baba is the name of the valley, in the western half of the peninsula of Sinai,       [I have described in detail the peninsula of Sinai, its history, and      the sacred places on it, in my book \"Durch Gosen zum Sinai,\"      published in 1872.  In depicting this scenery in the present      romance, I have endeavored to reproduce the reality as closely as      possible.  He who has wandered through this wonderful mountain      wilderness can never forget it.  The valley now called \"Laba,\" bore      the same name in the time"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5447"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 09 (#1)"],["body","Paaker plotting?  How is it that your brother is your enemy?\"  \"He is the elder of us two,\" said Horus with a trembling voice.  \"When my father died I had only a short time before left the school of Seti, and with his last words my father enjoined me to respect Paaker as the head of our family.  He is domineering and violent, and will allow no one's will to cross his; but I bore everything, and always obeyed him, often against my better judgment.  I remained with him two years, then I went to Thebes, and there I married, and my wife and child are now living there with my mother.  About sixteen months afterwards I came back to Syria, and we travelled through the country together; but by this time I did not choose to be the mere tool of my brother's will, for I had grown prouder, and it seemed to me that the father of my child ought not to be subservient, even to his own brother.  We often quarrelled, and had a bad time together, and life became quite unendurable, when--about eight weeks since--Paaker came back from Thebes, and the king gave him to understand that he approved more of my reports than of his.  From my childhood I have always been softhearted and patient; every one says I am like my mother; but what Paaker made me suffer by words and deeds, that is--I could not--\"  His voice broke, and Pentaur felt how cruelly he had suffered; then he went on again:  \"What happened to my brother in Egypt, I do not know, for he is very reserved, and asks for no sympathy, either in joy or in sorrow; but from words he has dropped now and then I gather that he not only bitterly hates Mena, the charioteer--who certainly did him an injury--but has some grudge against the king too.  I spoke to him of it at once, but only once, for his rage is unbounded when he is provoked, and after all he is my elder brother.  \"For some days they have been preparing in the camp for a decisive battle, and it was our duty to ascertain the position and strength of the enemy; the king gave me, and not Paaker, the commission to prepare the report.  Early yesterday morning I drew it out and wrote it; then my brother said he would carry it to the camp, and I was to wait here.  I positively refused, as Rameses had required the report at my hands, and not at his.  Well, he raved like a madman, declared that I had taken advantage of his absence to insinuate myself into the king's favor, and commanded me to obey him as the head of the house, in the name of my father.  \"I was sitting irresolute, when he went out of the cavern to call his horses; then my eyes fell on the things which the old black slave was tying together to load on a pack-horse--among them was a roll of writing. I fancied it was my own, and took it up to look at it, when--what should I find?  At the risk of my life I had gone among the Cheta, and had found that the main body of their army is collected in a cross-valley of the Orontes, quite hidden in the mountains to the north-east of Kadesh; and in the roll it was stated, in Paaker's own hand-writing, that that valley is clear, and the way through it open, and well suited for the passage of the Egyptian war-chariots; various other false details were given, and when I looked further among his things, I found between the arrows in his quiver, on which he had written 'death to Mena,' another little roll of writing.  I tore it open, and my blood ran cold when I saw to whom it was addressed.\"  \"To the king of the Cheta?\"  cried Pentaur in excitement.  \"To his chief officer, Titure,\" continued Horus.  \"I was holding both the rolls in my hand, when Paaker came back into the cave.  'Traitor!' I cried out to him; but he flung the lasso, with which he had been catching the stray horses, threw it round my neck, and as I fell choking on the ground, he and the black man, who obeys him like a dog, bound me hand and foot; he left the old negro to keep guard over me, took the rolls and rode away.  Look, there are the stars, and the moon will soon be up.\"  \"Make haste, men!\"  cried Pentaur.  \"The three best horses for me, Horus, and Kaschta; the rest remain here.\"  As the red-bearded soldier led the horses forward, the moon shone forth, and within an hour the travellers had reached the plain; they sprang on to the beasts and rode madly on towards the lake, which, when the sun rose, gleamed before them in silvery green.  As they drew near to it they could discern, on its treeless western shore, black masses moving hither and thither; clouds of dust rose up from the plain, pierced by flashes of light, like the rays of the sun reflected from a moving mirror.  \"The battle is begun!\"  cried Horus; and he fell sobbing on his horse's neck.  \"But all is not lost yet!\"  exclaimed  the poet, spurring his horse to a final effort of strength.  His companions did the same, but first Kaschta's horse fell under him, then Horus's broke down.  \"Help may be given by the left wing!\"  cried Horus.  \"I will run as fast as I can on foot, I know where to find them.  You will easily find the king if you follow the stream to the stone bridge.  In the cross-valley about a thousand paces farther north--to the northwest of our stronghold --the surprise is to be effected.  Try to get through, and warn Rameses; the Egyptian pass-word is 'Bent-Anat,' the name of the king's favorite daughter.  But even if you had wings, and could fly straight to him, they would overpower him if I cannot succeed in turning the left wing on the rear of the enemy.\"  Pentaur galloped onwards; but it was not long before his horse too gave way, and he ran forward like a man who runs a race, and shouted the pass- word \"Bent-Anat\"--for the ring of her name seemed to give him vigor. Presently he came upon a mounted messenger of the enemy; he struck him down from his horse, flung himself into the saddle, and rushed on towards the camp; as if he were riding to his wedding.     CHAPTER XXXVIII.  During the night which had proved so eventful to our friends, much had occurred in the king's camp, for the troops were to advance to the long- anticipated battle before sunrise.  Paaker had given his false report of the enemy's movements to the Pharaoh with his own hand; a council of war had been held, and each division had received instructions as to where it was to take up its position.  The corps, which bore the name of the Sungod Ra, advanced from the south towards Schabatun,       [Kadesh was the chief city of the Cheta, i. e.  Aramaans, round      which the united forces of all the peoples of western Asia had      collected.  There were several cities called Kadesh.  That which      frequently checked the forces of Thotmes III.  may have been      situated farther to the south; but the Cheta city of Kadesh, where      Rameses II.  fought so hard a battle, was undoubtedly on the      Orontes, for the river which is depicted on the pylon of the      Ramesseum as parting into two streams which wash the walls of the      fortress, is called Aruntha, and in the Epos of Pentaur it is stated      that this battle took place at Kadesh by the Orontes.  The name of      the city survives, at a spot just three miles north of the lake of      Riblah.  The battle itself I have described from the Epos of      Pentaur, the national epic of Egypt.  It ends with these words:      \"This was written and made by the scribe Pentaur.\"  It was so highly      esteemed that it is engraved in stone twice at Luqsor, and once at      Karnak.  Copies of it on papyrus are frequent; for instance, papyrus      Sallier III.  and papyrus Raifet--unfortunately much injured--in the      Louvre.  The principal incident, the rescue of the king from the      enemy, is repeated at the Ramessetun at Thebes, and at Abu Simbel.      It was translated into French by Vicomte E.  de Rouge.  The camp of      Rameses is depicted on the pylons of Luqsor and the Ramesseum.]  so as to surround the lake on the east, and fall on the enemy's flank; the corps of Seth, composed of men from lower Egypt, was sent on to Arnam to form the centre; the king himself, with the flower of the chariot- guard, proposed to follow the road through the valley, which Paaker's report represented as a safe and open passage to the plain of the Orontes.  Thus, while the other divisions occupied the enemy, he could cross the Orontes by a ford, and fall on the rear of the fortress of Kadesh from the north-west.  The corps of Amon, with the Ethiopian mercenaries, were to support him, joining him by another route, which the pioneer's false indications represented as connecting the line of operations.  The corps of Ptah remained as a reserve behind the left wing.  The soldiers had not gone to rest as usual; heavily, armed troops, who bore in one hand a shield of half a man's height, and in the other a scimitar, or a short, pointed sword, guarded the camp,       [Representations of Rameses' camp are preserved on the pylons of the      temple of Luxor and the Ramesseum.]  where numerous fires burned, round which crowded the resting warriors. Here a wine-skin was passed from hand to hand, there a joint was roasting on a wooden spit; farther on a party were throwing dice for the booty they had won, or playing at morra.  All was in eager activity, and many a scuffle occurred amoung the excited soldiers, and had to be settled by the camp-watch.  Near the enclosed plots, where the horses were tethered, the smiths were busily engaged in shoeing the beasts which needed it, and in sharpening the points of the lances; the servants of the chariot-guard were also fully occupied, as the chariots had for the most part been brought over the mountains in detached pieces on the backs of pack-horses and asses, and now had to be put together again, and to have their wheels greased. On the eastern side of the camp stood a canopy, under which the standards were kept, and there numbers of priests were occupied in their office of blessing the warriors, offering sacrifices, and singing hymns and litanies.
