How did you get out?\"  \"Why, through the court of the lions, of course.\"  \"They might have killed you.\"  \"So I thought; but the king's ocelots are well fed. They did not care to get up to dine off me in the middle of the night.\"  The rainbow colors of the dawn of the tropics illumined the sky to the east, and below, the hills were swathed in pearl gray mist. Alma breathed deep as he looked at Zara, fresh and radiant as the morning itself. The fleecy robe she had slipped on parted at the throat, her dark head was swathed in a pale blue gauze, broidered with silver stars, and not all the turmoil of the night could disguise the fact that she was young and glad to be alive. As she lifted a slender, rounded, white arm to indicate the violet and orange of the horizon, Alma caught her in his arms.  \"Come with me,\" he whispered, \"away from this wicked place. Let me teach you the principles of Abinadi. Together let us live our lives as he has taught, in conformity with the will of the Lord.\"  \"Abinadi!\" she murmured. \"I already believe in him, although he has taught the strange doctrine that we must return good for evil, instead of demanding an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But you must teach me. Alma,\" she added fearfully, \"for there are many things I do not understand. And this strange doctrine of repentance, that they talk so much about--\"  \"The king had better take to heart,\" Alma finished grimly. \"Would that the scales might fall from his eyes, as they have from mine!\"  \"He is going to put Abinadi to death?\"  \"So I fear.\"  \"And you?\"  \"Oh, I shall take up the work where he left off. I'm afraid his mantle will fall on unworthy shoulders. I have carefully written down all his words, and I shall teach them to the people when he is gone. I consecrate my life to the work. God grant me strength and light to do it well!\"  \"Does Abinadi know?\"  \"Yes; I go now to visit him in his cell.\"  \"Tarry a little, Sir Prophet,\" she commanded, running her hand through his yellow hair.  Together they watched the sun rise. The mocking birds sang riotously. The lavender flowers of the bougainvilaea drooped in the garden, while from the patio below the air came laden with the heavy odor of the blossom called \"The Perfume of the Night.\" The lovers did not notice that with it was mingled the scent of the ill-omened \"Flower of the Dead.\"  III.  THE EXECUTION.  The great market place was the heart of the city. The streets, like so many arteries, emptied into its pulsating center. There all the buying and selling went on. Here was a fruit stand from which a bronze Lamanitish goddess flicked the flies. Yonder was a clothier's containing garments of chameleon dyes. There were cafes, candy stands, butcher shops, fish from the lake, venders of pottery, and makers of lace. The band played there in the afternoon, and lovers sought the shade of its arbors in the evening.  This morning something of unusual occurrence was about to happen. People were running hither and thither. There was a hushed murmur of excitement among the crowds, which were larger than on any market day. Four regiments of soldiers were stationed at the comers, while a fifth was keeping the people back from an open space in the middle of the square.  \"Wherefore the crowd?\" asked the countryman who had just brought his cart of vegetables to the city that morning, of a young man who was hurrying to the scene.  The other looked at him in surprise, \"Why, they are going to burn the Prophet Abinadi.\"  \"They're not going to burn him alive?\"  \"How do you think they'd burn him--dead?\" he threw back over his shoulder, as he hurried on.  The crowd was impatient.  \"Light the fire, and let us see if this false prophet is pluckily true to his convictions.\"  \"What are they waiting for?\" called another.  There was a blare of trumpets, a blast of martial music, and then the cry, \"Make way for the king!\"  On a palanquin, borne aloft on the shoulders of men, surmounted by a green canopy, reclined the king. As soon as he reached the place of execution he ordered the soldiers to bring forth the prisoner. When Abinadi, sustained by the heroism of martyrdom, but very weak and trembling physically, stood before him, Noah pronounced sternly: \"Abinadi, we have found an accusation against thee and thou art worthy of death; for thou hast said that God himself should come down among the children of men, and now for this cause thou shalt be put to death, unless thou wilt recall all the words thou hast spoken evil concerning me and my people.\"  With a hunted look in his eyes Abinadi answered: \"I will not recall the words I have spoken unto you concerning this people, for they are true. I will suffer even unto death. I will not recall my words, and they shall stand as a testimony against you. And if ye slay me, ye will shed innocent blood, and this shall stand as a testimony against you at the last day.\"  The words touched even the callous heart of Noah, and he was half convinced. He turned to the priests.  \"Shall we release him?\"  \"Death to Abinadi, he has reviled the king!\" was the shout.  \"Death to Abinadi!\"  \"Let his God delay the flames!\"  \"He says we shall all be captives to the Lamanites!\"  \"Down with false prophets!\"  Amid the maledictions, they bound Abinadi to the stake and lighted the fagots under his feet.  As the flames licked his quivering limbs, and he writhed in agony, he looked into the faces of the terror-stricken populace and said in accents thick, \"It will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all manner of diseases because of your iniquities. Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be driven and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is driven by wild and ferocious beasts. And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye shall be taken by the hand of your enemies.\"  As the flames mounted higher and higher, and the victim writhed in agony, a young man, with sunny hair, made his way out of the crowd, for he could stand it no longer. Henceforth he was the disciple of the dead prophet, and the blood of martyrdom had won its first convert in Alma.  His was not the only sick heart, for when the agonized victim looked out of his pain-dimmed eyes and said prophetically to Noah, \"Ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains of death by fire,\" the king called suddenly, \"Ho, take me hence!\"  IV.  THE WATERS OF MORMON.  Gloom reigned in the palace and in the heart of Zara. The death of Abinadi seemed to portend evil. Alma was condemned to death, and guards were scouting the country for him, for he had disappeared. Zara was torn with fear, for she expected daily to see him dragged there in irons. Again she thought he had been secretly murdered, and this hunting for him was a pretense.  Then a message came to her. She sent for Amulon, who came gladly, for she had locked herself up in her apartments and refused to see him for days, while he, whose will was law, chafed like a chained lion. She was peculiarly gracious, and it was with difficulty he restrained himself, for his love for this maiden, who was the first who had ever opposed him, swept him off his feet.  \"I have a favor to ask of you. Amulon, as always,\" she began.  \"Which is already granted, if it lies within my power, princess.\"  \"Ever am I more indebted to you.\"  \"What is my lady's latest caprice?\"  \"You know I am virtually a prisoner here. All of the palace is mine, but the bird is none the less barred because the cage is gilded. An aged aunt of mine is dying, and she has sent for me to soothe her last hours. I would go to her bedside. Will you not ask the king's permission that I may go?\"  Amulon was touched by her earnestness, for ever are strong men weakest through their strength.  \"Go, Zara, and I will be responsible to the king.\" He stepped to the door and summoned Mulek. \"Do you accompany this lady wherever she goes. See that no harm approaches, and return her in safety to the palace.\"  Mulek bowed and retreated.  Zara sallied out accompanied by the giant soldier Mulek. They made their way to a large house with a stone front. They entered, and passed through corridor after corridor, until they came to the one that led to the death chamber.  \"You will wait here for me, Mulek?\"  \"The Lord Amulon said I was not to let you out of my sight.\"  \"But you can't go in there when she is dying!\"  \"I go where you do,\" he answered doggedly.  She was in despair. But everyone has his vulnerable point. She began to plead with him, using all her art, but he only shook his head. She tore a heavy gold chain from her neck. Three great emeralds hung pendant from it. The bauble was worth a fortune. She thrust it into his hand, saying imperiously, \"Wait here, I will soon be back.\"  Before he could recover himself she was gone. His first impulse was to follow her, but he distinguished the sound of a woman's voice, and it deterred him.  The giant waited a long time. He paced restlessly around the room. When the afternoon sun faded into evening he grew alarmed. He rang a bell, which no one answered. He walked through the deserted halls. He came back and went to the room of the sick woman. There was no couch there, and a new light broke in on him. He ran through the house shouting. A Lamanitish woman, a servant, confronted him.  \"Where is Zara, the daughter of Gideon?\" he fairly shouted.  She eyed him calmly. \"I know of no such a woman.\"  \"I brought her here,\" he reiterated.  \"She is not here,\" she repeated.  He rushed through the house, but found no trace of her whom he sought. His first impulse was to flee and escape the anger of Amulon. But on second thought he decided that would look as if he had connived at her escape. If he reported at once, she might yet be found. He started on a run back to the palace.  When he presented himself before Amulon, a sweating, palpitating, trembling wretch, the courtier gave him one look and then roared, \"Where is the girl?\"  \"Alas, I know not!\" wailed the other. \"I turned, m'lord, and she was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50958"],["title","Representative Women of Deseret: A Book of Biographical Sketches (#1)"],["body","of the Latter Day Saints.  \"She became a governess to the children of the Prophet, and was a companion for Emma, his wife, for a number of years.  \"From means she brought with her, Miss Snow gave freely toward building the Kirtland Temple. Persecution soon arose and raged so that, with her family who had now joined the Church, she left Kirtland, going to Davies Co., Mo. On the 10th of December, 1838, Miss Snow with her father's family, left Davies Co., the Mormons in that locality having been ordered by the Governor to leave the county within ten days.  \"They passed through almost unendurable sufferings, and reaching Far West found the Prophet and many others had been dragged to jail leaving their families destitute. March 1839, they left Far West leaving much of their property behind. Eliza and her sister stopped in Quincy, Ill., awhile. In July 1839, Miss Snow went to Commerce, (since called Nauvoo) to teach school. During her seven years' residence there she wrote much and advanced rapidly in her knowledge of the principles of the Gospel. Here, the Relief Society was organized by Joseph, March, 1842, and Sister Eliza was chosen for secretary.\" There are now three hundred branches of the Relief Society. \"Eliza was at this time the wife of the Prophet. In the latter part of July 1842, Mrs. Smith, President of the Relief Society, proposed a petition to Governor Carlin, asking his protection of Joseph. Sister Eliza, as secretary, wrote the petition which was signed by several hundred ladies, and in company with President Emma and Mrs. Warren Smith visited the Governor at his residence in Quincy, Adams Co., Ill., where they were most cordially received by the Governor. He replied to them, 'I believe Mr. Smith is innocent.' Soon after their return home they learned that the Governor in connection with Missouri officials was plotting the destruction of the lives of those noble men.  \"The Prophet and Patriarch were massacred! For awhile, thought of all else was forgotten but this overwhelming woe. But God gave them his sustaining love, and Eliza, widowed, turned again to the work Joseph had established, consecrating even her life to its service. The Temple was at length finished, and Sister Eliza then began another era, ministering in the Temple in the holy rites that pertain to the House of the Lord, as Priestess and Mother in Israel to hundreds of her sex.  \"In Feb., 1846, she left Nauvoo, on her way to the Rocky Mountains. At the middle Fork of Green River they stopped at one of the resting places. Here Sister Eliza and friends with whom the latter traveled, lived in a log house laid up like children's cob houses, with cracks from one to four inches wide. A tent cloth stretched over the top, blankets and carpets hung up inside as protection against the inclement weather. On the 19th of August when they were leaving here, they were minus a teamster. Sister Eliza undertook to drive ox team, and after some experience became an adept. August 27th they crossed the Missouri river, and on the 28th, arrived at Winter Quarters. From constant exposure and continued hardships Sister Eliza broke down. Fever set in, chills and fever followed; heavy rains came on and she was wet nearly from head to foot. She felt that she stood at the gates of death, it was but a step beyond, and once inside the portals she would be free from pain and suffering. But the great lifework lay before her, and she summoned courage and supreme faith to her aid. They moved into a log house partly finished, no chinking, no chimney. The fire was built on one side, and the room which had no floor was always filled with smoke. The cooking had to be done out of doors, the intense cold being preferable to the smoke.\" About the close of the year she received the sad news of the death of her mother.  \"April 7th, 1847, the pioneers under the direction of President Brigham Young started to find a gathering place for the Pilgrim Saints. In June Sister Eliza resumed her journey westward. Nursing the sick in tents and wagons, and burying the dead by the wayside in the wild desert were indeed mournful, yes, pitiful. On the 4th of August, several of the Mormon Battallion returning to Winter Quarters, met the Pilgrim Companies, and joyful indeed was the meeting for they were husbands, fathers, brothers and sons of women who were in those companies. They soon met the returning pioneers and heard of the resting place found, and arrived safely in the valley in October. Here Sister Eliza took up her abode with Mrs. Clara Decker Young. Shortly after, the Saints numbering six hundred arrived in the valley, a pole was erected and the _flag_ which had been preserved with the greatest care, was raised. * * As time passed on a place was selected and consecrated in which holy ordinances might be administered. Sister Eliza was called upon to take part, in which calling she has officiated up to the present. When the wards and settlements were pretty generally systematized, Pres. Young re-organized the Relief Society. He called on Sister Eliza to assist, and associate with her in the labor, Zina D. Young; this gave to them the precedence which they have since held.  \"At a Mass Meeting held in this city January 13th, 1870, in the Old Tabernacle, (where the Assembly Hall now stands) by about 6,000 women to protest against the 'Cullom Bill,' Sister Eliza made a strong and brilliant speech. Politically this was the turning point in the history of the women of Utah. A few weeks later and the women of Utah received the right of franchise. They will ever hold Governor S. A. Mann in special grateful remembrance. * * In 1854-5, the Lion House was completed and Sister Eliza has ever since resided there. It was some years later before the domestic spinning, dyeing and weaving were discontinued, in these things Sister Eliza also excelled.  \"In 1869, the Retrenchment Meetings were by the counsel of Pres. Young, organized. An association with a presiding board of seven officers. These meetings are still held in the Fourteenth Ward Assembly Rooms semi-monthly, at the same hour, the same ladies presiding, excepting Sister M. T. Smoot since removed to Provo. Here good instructions are given, and here the Junior Associations' secretaries bring the minutes of their respective Wards' Meetings, also the secretaries of the Primary Associations, (girls under twelve years of age, generally,) thus bringing together for mutual benefit an interchange of ideas, experience and suggestions, the aged veterans, the younger matrons and maidens, and little children.  \"October 26th, 1872, Sister Eliza left Salt Lake City on a journey to the Holy Land, her brother, Apostle Lorenzo Snow, joining her in Ogden. Pres. George A. Smith and party met them in New York. They took the steamer for Liverpool November 5th. In Rome Sister Eliza spent five days, visited Naples, Corfu, Alexandria, Cairo, Suez, Joppa, the plains of Sharon, the Valley of Ajelon became realized, and in due time they beheld Jerusalem. This tour through the Holy Land was a mission pertaining to the Latter Day Work. An account of the trip was published in book form, entitled 'Palestine Tourists.' Sunday, March 2nd, 1873, they ascended the Mount of Olives, and held service there after the manner of the Holy Priesthood as revealed in this dispensation. March 25th, embarked for Constantinople. Sister Eliza had been enduring twenty-nine days of tent life, and twenty-one of riding on horseback. And this in her seventieth year! At Athens they took tea with the American Minister, and met the American Consul General to Constantinople. They visited Munich then went to Vienna and thence to Hamburg. May 16th, 1873, they took steamer for London, and met the Saints in their Conference, May 25th. Embarked for home on the 28th. Returning early in July, she visited many old scenes and friends of her early life, received with honors from place to place. So quiet was her return to Utah, that four days elapsed before her many friends became aware of it. A brief rest sufficed, Sister Eliza could not be idle. She visited Ogden and Provo in August, Cache Valley in September, holding meetings in these and many other places.  \"Just after the October Conference of 1876, Sister Eliza entered upon the superintendency of the 'Woman's Store,' a Commission House for Utah home made goods. Officers and employees were women. During this year she prepared her second volume of poems for the press, also assisted in selecting and preparing the manuscript for the 'Women of Mormondom,' and in raising funds for its publication, and not least of all, gave the proof her attention. Also still continued her labors in the House of the Lord.\" At this time occurred the death of President Brigham Young. To one so disciplined in order, with such continuity of purpose, such adhesiveness to principle and friends, it would seem that to ordinary persons, the loss of one in whose house she had her place, and whose friendship and counsels she had shared for over twenty-five years, would be an overwhelming shock. But the same strength of mind which had risen from the martyrdom of the Prophet and Patriarch supported her again, and she \"renewed her diligence, if it were possible, in her broad field of labor.\" Political events and duties occupied her attention during December and January 1878. During the ensuing summer she traveled hundreds of miles, holding generally two meetings a day wherever they stopped. While attending a meeting at Farmington, Davis Co., the efforts of Sister Aurelia Spencer Rogers received her consideration and the Primary Associations, for children, became part of our system. \"The first Organization at Farmington dates from September 7th, 1878; about this time an Association was organized in the Eleventh Ward of this city, taking the lead.\" This new feature so suggestive of great benefit to the children so enlisted her feelings that she has visited most of the settlements"]]]
