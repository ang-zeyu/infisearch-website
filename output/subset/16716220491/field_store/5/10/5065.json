It had not been long before Dick and Dora showed a great liking for each other, and, at the same time, Tom often \"paired off\" with Nellie, and Sam as often sought the company of Grace. Then came the time when the boys did a great service for Mrs. Stanhope, saving her from the wicked plotting of Josiah Crabtree, a teacher at Putnam Hall. Crabtree was exposed, and lost no time in leaving the school, threatening at the same time that, sooner or later, he would \"square accounts with the Rovers.\"  But a few miles away from Brill College was located Hope Seminary, an institution for girls. When the Rover boys went to Brill, Dora, Nellie and Grace entered Hope, so the young folks met almost as often as before. A term at Brill was followed by an unexpected trip Down East, where the Rover boys again brought the rascally Crabtree to terms. Then the lads became the possessors of a biplane, and took several thrilling trips through the air. About this time, Mr. Anderson Rover, who was not in the best of health, was having much trouble with some brokers, who were trying to swindle him out of valuable property. He went to New York City, and disappeared, and his three sons went at once on the hunt for him. The brokers were Pelter, Japson & Company, and it was not long before Dick and his brothers discovered that Pelter and Japson were in league with Josiah Crabtree. In the end the boys found out what had become of their parent, and they managed to bring the brokers to terms. But, during a struggle, poor Tom was hit on the head by a wooden footstool thrown by Pelter, and knocked unconscious. Josiah Crabtree tried to escape from a garret window by means of a rope made of a blanket. This broke, and he sustained a heavy fall, breaking a leg in two places. He was taken to a hospital, and the doctors there said he would be a cripple for life.  \"There is no use in talking, Dad,\" Dick had said to his father, \"you are not in a fit physical condition to take hold of these business matters. You had better leave them entirely to me.\" And to this Mr. Rover had agreed. Then, as Dick was to leave college and spend most of his time in New York, it had been decided that he and Dora should get married. There had followed one of the grandest weddings the village of Cedarville had ever seen.  The blow on Tom's head proved more serious than was at first anticipated. Through it the poor lad suddenly lost his mind, and while in that state he wandered away from Brill College, and went on a long journey, as related in detail in the volume preceding this, entitled \"The Rover Boys in Alaska.\"  As their father was too ill to take part in any search for the missing one, Dick and Sam took up the hunt, and after many thrilling adventures on the ice and in the snow, managed to locate their brother and bring him back home.  \"And now, Tom, you must take a good long rest,\" his kindly Aunt Martha had said, and she had insisted upon it that he be put under the care of a specialist. Tom had rested for several months, and then, declaring that he felt as good as ever, had returned to Brill. Sam was already in the grind, and soon Tom was doing his best to make up for the time he had lost on his strange trip.  Of course, Nellie Laning had been very much worried over Tom's condition, and his disappearance had caused her intense dismay. Since he had returned to Brill, she had asked that he either call on her or write to her at least once a week. Tom preferred a visit to letter-writing, and as Sam was usually ready to go to Hope to see Grace whenever the opportunity afforded, the brothers usually took the trip together, as in the present instance.  Searchlight in hand, the Rover boys peered out over the surface of the swiftly-flowing river, which at this point was about seventy-five feet wide. The bridge was built in three sections, and it was the middle span which had collapsed at the farther end, so that the automobile had plunged into water which was at least eight feet deep.  \"Do you see anything of him?\" asked Sam, eagerly, as the rays from the light flashed in one direction and then in another.  \"If he managed to get out of the auto, perhaps he floated down with the current,\" responded his brother. \"Anyhow, he doesn't seem to be around here.\"  \"Maybe he was caught under the wheel. If so, we had better get him out without delay.\"  \"Look! Look!\" And now Tom pointed down the river. There in the moonlight, both boys saw a form coming to the surface. The fellow was beating the water wildly with his hands, and now he set up a frantic cry for aid. Turning the searchlight in that direction, the Rover boys left the vicinity of the broken bridge, and made their way down to something of a footpath that ran along the water's edge. Tom was in the lead. Here and there the bushes hung over the stream, and both lads had to scramble along as best they could.  \"Help! Help!\" The cry came faintly, and then the two boys saw the fellow in the water throw up both arms and sink from view.  \"He has gone under!\" gasped Sam. \"Hurry up, Tom, or we'll be too late!\"  Scrambling wildly through the last of the bushes and onto some flat rocks that, in this vicinity, ran out into the river, the Rover boys soon gained a point which was less than four yards from where the unfortunate youth had disappeared. Leading the way, Tom leaped from one flat stone in the stream to another. Sam followed closely, holding the searchlight on the spot where both hoped the fellow in the water might reappear.  \"Here he is!\" cried Tom. And, as he spoke, Sam saw a dark object turn over in the stream close to the rock on which his brother had leaped. The next instant Tom was down on his knees and feeling through the water.  \"Hold my hand, Sam,\" said the older Rover. And as Sam took his left hand, Tom clutched with his right the coat of the party in the river. Then came a hard pull; and a moment later Tom had the dripping form on the rock.  \"Is he--he--dead?\" questioned Sam, hoarsely.  \"I don't think so, but he certainly has had a close call. We must get him ashore and work over him as soon as possible. You light the way; I think I can carry him alone.\"  The fellow who had been hauled out of the river was a slightly-built youth, not over twenty years of age. As Tom was both big and muscular, it was an easy matter for him to throw the stranger over his shoulder. Sam led the way to the shore, keeping the light down on the rocks so that his brother might be sure of his footing.  Once safe, the boys placed the stranger on the grass and started to work over him. He was unconscious, and had evidently swallowed considerable water. Fortunately, the lads had taken lessons in how to resuscitate a person who had been close to drowning, so they knew exactly what to do.  \"It's a mighty lucky thing that we were here to aid him,\" remarked Sam, as he and Tom proceeded with their efforts. \"Another minute, and it would have been all up with this poor fellow.\"  \"Well, he isn't out of the woods yet, Sam, but I think he is coming around.\" And even as Tom spoke the stranger gave a gasp and a groan, and tried to sit up.  \"It's all right, my friend,\" cried Sam, reassuringly. \"We've got you, you are safe.\"  \"Oh, oh!\" moaned the young man who had been so close to drowning. And then as he sat up and stared at the brothers, he added: \"Did--did you sa--save me?\"  \"Well, we hauled you out of the river,\" replied Tom, simply.  \"You did!\" The young man shivered as he glanced at the swiftly-flowing stream. \"The bridge--it was broken, but I didn't notice it in time.\"  \"We tried to warn you,\" said Sam, \"but you were coming too fast.\"  \"I know it, but I--I----\" And then the young man, having tried to get to his feet, suddenly collapsed and became unconscious again.  \"Phew!\" came from Sam in surprise. \"He must be worse off than we thought.\"  \"Perhaps he got struck when he went down,\" suggested Tom. \"See here, there is blood on his hand; it is running down his sleeve!\"  \"Maybe his arm is broken, Tom. I guess the best thing we can do is to get him to some doctor.\"  \"Why not take him right down to Ashton to Doctor Havens?\"  \"Good idea; we'll do it.\"  Tom again took up the unconscious young man, and, with Sam leading the way, both hurried to their automobile. The stranger was deposited on the seat of the tonneau, and then Tom lost no time in turning the machine around and heading for town.  \"I wonder who he can be?\" remarked Sam, as they sped along.  \"I'm sure I don't know,\" was Tom's reply. Neither of the boys dreamed of the surprise in store for them.     CHAPTER III  SOMETHING OF A SURPRISE   It did not take the Rover boys long to reach Ashton; and once in town, they lost no time in running their auto to where Doctor Havens resided. They found the house well lit up, and the old doctor in his study, poring over some medical works.  \"Saved a fellow from drowning, eh?\" he queried, after the lads had explained matters. \"Got him out in your auto? All right, bring him right in if you want to--or wait, I'll go out and take a look at him. Maybe I know who he is and where he belongs.\" And thus speaking, the doctor went outside.  Sam still had the searchlight in hand, and as the physician approached the automobile, the lad flashed the rays on the face of the stranger, who was still unconscious.  \"Why, I've seen that young chap before!\" exclaimed Doctor Havens. \"He is stopping at the hotel. I saw him there only this afternoon.\"  \"Then perhaps we had better take him over there,\" suggested Tom.  \"By all means, and I'll go with you.\"  Running into the house, the doctor procured his hand case, and then joined the boys in the automobile. A run of a few minutes brought the party to the hotel, and Sam and Tom lifted the young man out and carried him inside.  The arrival of the party created some consternation, but as only the proprietor of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50022"],["title","The Wailing Asteroid (#1)"],["body"," utterly desirable, and this lunatic repetitive experience was at worst insanity and at the least delusion. But he'd never been able to do more than stammer when talk between them went away from matter-of-fact things.  Tonight, though, he'd parked his car where a river sparkled in the moonlight. There was a scent of pine and arbutus in the air and a faint thread of romantic music came from his car's radio. He'd brought Sandy here to propose to her. He was doggedly resolved to break the chains a psychological oddity had tied him up in.  He cleared his throat. He'd taken Sandy out to dinner, ostensibly to celebrate the completion of a development job for Interiors, Inc. Burke had started Burke Development, Inc., some four years out of college when he found he didn't like working for other people and could work for himself. Its function was to develop designs and processes for companies too small to have research-and-development divisions of their own. The latest, now-finished, job was a wall-garden which those expensive interior decorators, Interiors, Inc., believed might appeal to the very rich. Burke had made it. It was a hydroponic job. A rich man's house could have one or more walls which looked like a grassy sward stood on edge, with occasional small flowers or even fruits growing from its close-clipped surface.[A]       [Footnote A: Transcriber's Note: The following sentence has been      deleted at this point: \"Interiors, Inc., would push the idea of a      a bomb shelter or in an atomic submarine where it would cation.\"      This is a possible printer error.  A later edition of this work      also has this sentence deleted.  It was done. A production-job room-wall had been shipped and the check for it banked. Burke had toyed with the idea that growing vegetation like that might be useful in a bomb shelter or in an atomic submarine where it would keep the air fresh indefinitely. But such ideas were for the future. They had nothing to do with now. Now Burke was going to triumph over an obsessive dream.  \"I've got something to say, Sandy,\" said Burke painfully.  She did not turn her head. There was moonlight, rippling water, and the tranquil noises of the night in springtime. A perfect setting for what Burke had in mind, and what Sandy knew about in advance. She waited, her eyes turned away from him so he wouldn't see that they were shining a little.  \"I'm something of an idiot,\" said Burke, clumsily. \"It's only fair to tell you about it. I'm subject to a psychological gimmick that a girl I--Hm.\" He coughed. \"I think I ought to tell you about it.\"  \"Why?\" asked Sandy, still not looking in his direction.  \"Because I want to be fair,\" said Burke. \"I'm a sort of crackpot. You've noticed it, of course.\"  Sandy considered.  \"No-o-o-o,\" she said measuredly. \"I think you're pretty normal, except--No. I think you're all right.\"  \"Unfortunately,\" he told her, \"I'm not. Ever since I was a kid I've been bothered by a delusion, if that's what it is. It doesn't make sense. It couldn't. But it made me take up engineering, I think, and ...\"  His voice trailed away.  \"And what?\"  \"Made an idiot out of me,\" said Burke. \"I was always pretty crazy about you, and it seems to me that I took you to a lot of dances and such in high school, but I couldn't act romantic. I wanted to, but I couldn't. There was this crazy delusion....\"  \"I wondered, a little,\" said Sandy, smiling.  \"I _wanted_ to be romantic about you,\" he told her urgently. \"But this damned obsession kept me from it.\"  \"Are you offering to be a brother to me now?\" asked Sandy.  \"No!\" said Burke explosively. \"I'm fed up with myself. I want to be different. Very different. With you!\"  Sandy smiled again.  \"Strangely enough, you interest me,\" she told him. \"Do go on!\"  But he was abruptly tongue-tied. He looked at her, struggling to speak. She waited.  \"I w-want to ask you to m-m-marry me,\" said Burke desperately. \"But I have to tell you about the other thing first. Maybe you won't want....\"  Her eyes were definitely shining now. There was soft music and rippling water and soft wind in the trees. It was definitely the time and place for romance.  But the music on the car radio cut off abruptly. A harsh voice interrupted:  \"_Special Bulletin! Special Bulletin! Messages of unknown origin are reaching Earth from outer space! Special Bulletin! Messages from outer space!_\"  Burke reached over and turned up the sound. Perhaps he was the only man in the world who would have spoiled such a moment to listen to a news broadcast, and even he wouldn't have done it for a broadcast on any other subject. He turned the sound high.  \"_This is a special broadcast from the Academy of Sciences in Washington, D. C._\" boomed the speaker. \"_Some thirteen hours ago a satellite-tracking station in the South Pacific reported picking up signals of unknown origin and great strength, using the microwave frequencies also used by artificial satellites now in orbit around Earth. The report was verified shortly afterward from India, then Near East tracking stations made the same report. European listening posts and radar telescopes were on the alert when the sky area from which the signals come rose above the horizon. American stations have again verified the report within the last few minutes. Artificial signals, plainly not made by men, are now reaching Earth every seventy-nine minutes from remotest space. There is as yet no hint of what the messages may mean, but that they are an attempt at communication is certain. The signals have been recorded on tape, and the sounds which follow are those which have been sent to Earth by alien, non-human, intelligent beings no one knows how far away._\"  A pause. Then the car radio, with night sounds and the calls of nightbirds for background, gave out crisp, distinct fluting noises, like someone playing an arbitrary selection of musical notes on a strange wind instrument.  The effect was plaintive, but Burke stiffened in every muscle at the first of them. The fluting noises were higher and lower in turn. At intervals, they paused as if between groups of signals constituting a word. The enigmatic sounds went on for a full minute. Then they stopped. The voice returned:  \"_These are the signals from space. What you have heard is apparently a complete message. It is repeated five times and then ceases. An hour and nineteen minutes later it is again repeated five times...._\"  The voice continued, while Burke remained frozen and motionless in the parked car. Sandy watched him, at first hopefully, and then bewilderedly. The voice said that the signal strength was very great. But the power for artificial-satellite broadcasts is only a fraction of a watt. These signals, considering the minimum distance from which they could come, had at least thousands of kilowatts behind them.  Somewhere out in space, farther than man's robot rockets had ever gone, huge amounts of electric energy were controlled to send these signals to Earth. Scientists were in disagreement about the possible distance the signals had traveled, whether they were meant solely for Earth or not, and whether they were an attempt to open communication with humanity. But nobody doubted that the signals were artificial. They had been sent by technical means. They could not conceivably be natural phenomena. Directional fixes said absolutely that they did not come from Mars or Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune and Uranus and Pluto were not nearly in the line of the signals' travel. Of course Venus and Mercury were to sunward of Earth, which ruled them out, since the signals arrived only on the night side of mankind's world. Nobody could guess, as yet, where they did originate.  Burke sat utterly still, every muscle tense. He was so pale that even in the moonlight Sandy saw it. She was alarmed.  \"Joe! What's the matter?\"  \"Did you--hear that?\" he asked thinly. \"The signals?\"  \"Of course. But what....\"  \"I recognized them,\" said Burke, in a tone that was somehow despairing. \"I've heard signals like that every so often since I was a kid.\" He swallowed. \"It was sounds like that, and what went with them, that has been the--trouble with me. I was going to tell you about it--and ask you if you'd marry me anyway.\"  He began to tremble a little, which was not at all like the Joe Burke that Sandy knew.  \"I don't quite under--\"  \"I'm afraid I've gone out of my head,\" he said unsteadily. \"Look, Sandy! I was going to propose to you. Instead, I'm going to take you back to the office. I'm going to play you a recording I made a year ago. I think that when you've heard it you'll decide you wouldn't want to marry me anyhow.\"  Sandy looked at him with astonished eyes.  \"You mean those signals from somewhere mean something special to you?\"  \"Very special,\" said Burke. \"They raise the question of whether I've been crazy, and am suddenly sane, or whether I've been sane up to now, and have suddenly gone crazy.\"  The radio switched back to dance music. Burke cut it off. He started the car's motor. He backed, swung around, and headed for the office and construction shed of Burke Development, Inc.  Elsewhere, the profoundest minds of the planet gingerly examined the appalling fact that signals came to Earth from a place where men could not be. A message came from something which was not human. It was a suggestion to make cold chills run up and down any educated spine. But Burke drove tensely, and the road's surface sped toward the car's wheels and vanished under them. A warm breeze hummed and thuttered around the windshield. Sandy sat very still.  \"The way I'm acting doesn't make sense, does it?\" Burke asked. \"Do you feel like you're riding with a lunatic?\"  \"No,\" she said. \"But I never thought that if you ever did get around to asking me to marry you, somebody from outer space would forbid the banns! Can't you tell me what all this is about?\"  \"I doubt it very much,\" he told her. \"Can you tell me what the signals are about?\"  She shook her"]]]
