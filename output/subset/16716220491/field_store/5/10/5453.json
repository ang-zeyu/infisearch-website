If I were only as young as Paaker!  You laugh at the sighs of a man--say at once of an old man!  Well, yes, I am old, for the prime of life lies behind me.  And yet Katuti, my friend, wisest of women--explain to me one thing.  When I was young I was loved by many and admired many women, but not one of them--not even my wife, who died young, was more to me than a toy, a plaything; and now when I stretch out my hand for a girl, whose father I might very well be--not for her own sake, but simply to serve my purpose--and she refuses me, I feel as much disturbed, as much a fool as- as that dealer in love-philters, Paaker.\"  \"Have you spoken to Bent-Anat?\"  asked Katuti.  \"And heard again from her own lips the refusal she had sent me through you.  You see my spirit has suffered!\"  \"And on what pretext did she reject your suit?\"  asked the widow.  \"Pretext!\"  cried Ani.  \"Bent-Anat and pretext!  It must be owned that she has kingly pride, and not Ma--[The Goddess of Truth]--herself is more truthful than she.  That I should have to confess it!  When I think of her, our plots seem to me unutterably pitiful.  My veins contain, indeed, many drops of the blood of Thotmes, and though the experience of life has taught me to stoop low, still the stooping hurts me.  I have never known the happy feeling of satisfaction with my lot and my work; for I have always had a greater position than I could fill, and constantly done less than I ought to have done.  In order not to look always resentful, I always wear a smile.  I have nothing left of the face I was born with but the mere skin, and always wear a mask.  I serve him whose master I believe I ought to be by birth; I hate Rameses, who, sincerely or no, calls me his brother; and while I stand as if I were the bulwark of his authority I am diligently undermining it.  My whole existence is a lie.\"  \"But it will be truth,\" cried Katuti, \"as soon as the Gods allow you to be--as you are--the real king of this country.\"  \"Strange!\"  said Ani smiling, Ameni,  this  very day, used almost exactly the same words.  The wisdom of priests, and that of women, have much in common, and they fight with the same weapons.  You use words instead of swords, traps instead of lances, and you cast not our bodies, but our souls, into irons.\"  \"Do you blame or praise us for it?\"  said the widow.  \"We are in any case not impotent allies, and therefore, it seems to me, desirable ones.\"  Indeed you are,\" said Ani smiling.  \"Not a tear is shed in the land, whether it is shed for joy or for sorrow, for which in the first instance a priest or a woman is not responsible.  Seriously, Katuti--in nine great events out of ten you women have a hand in the game.  You gave the first impulse to all that is plotting here, and I will confess to you that, regardless of all consequences, I should in a few hours have given up my pretensions to the throne, if that woman Bent-Anat had said 'yes' instead of 'no.'\"  \"You make me believe,\" said  Katuti, \"that the weaker sex are gifted with stronger wills than the nobler.  In marrying us you style us, 'the mistress of the house,' and if the elders of the citizens grow infirm, in this country it is not the sons but the daughters that must be their mainstay.  But we women have our weaknesses, and chief of these is curiosity.--May I ask on what ground Bent-Anat dismissed you?\"  \"You know so much that you may know all,\" replied Ani.  \"She admitted me to speak to her alone.  It was yet early, and she had come from the temple, where the weak old prophet had absolved her from uncleanness; she met me, bright, beautiful and proud, strong and radiant as a Goddess, and a princess.  My heart throbbed as if I were a boy, and while she was showing me her flowers I said to myself:  'You are come to obtain through her another claim to the throne.'  And yet I felt that, if she consented to be mine, I would remain the true brother, the faithful Regent of Rameses, and enjoy happiness and peace by her side before it was too late.  If she refused me then I resolved that fate must take its way, and, instead of peace and love, it must be war for the crown snatched from my fathers.  I tried to woo her, but she cut my words short, said I was a noble man, and a worthy suitor but--\"  \"There came the but.\"  \"Yes--in the form of a very frank 'no.'  I asked her reasons.  She begged me to be content with the 'no;' then I pressed her harder, till she interrupted me, and owned with proud decision that she preferred some one else.  I wished to learn the name of the happy man--that she refused. Then my blood began to boil, and my desire to win her increased; but I had to leave her, rejected, and with a fresh, burning, poisoned wound in my heart.\"  \"You are jealous!\"  said Katuti, \"and do you know of whom?\"  \"No,\" replied Ani.  \"But I hope to find out through you.  What I feel it is impossible for me to express.  But one thing I know, and that is this, that I entered the palace a vacillating man--that I left it firmly resolved.  I now rush straight onwards, never again to turn back.  From this time forward you will no longer have to drive me onward, but rather to hold me back; and, as if the Gods had meant to show that they would stand by me, I found the high-priest Ameni, and the chief pioneer Paaker waiting for me in my house.  Ameni will act for me in Egypt, Paaker in Syria.  My victorious troops from Ethiopia will enter Thebes to-morrow morning, on their return home in triumph, as if the king were at their head, and will then take part in the Feast of the Valley.  Later we will send them into the north, and post them in the fortresses which protect Egypt against enemies coming from the east Tanis, Daphne, Pelusium, Migdol.  Rameses, as you know, requires that we should drill the serfs of the temples, and send them to him as auxiliaries.  I will send him half of the body-guard, the other half shall serve my own purposes.  The garrison of Memphis, which is devoted to Rameses, shall be sent to Nubia, and shall be relieved by troops that are faithful to me.  The people of Thebes are led by the priests, and tomorrow Ameni will point out to them who is their legitimate king, who will put an end to the war and release them from taxes.  The children of Rameses will be excluded from the solemnities, for Ameni, in spite of the chief-priest of Anion, still pronounces Bent-Anat unclean.  Young Rameri has been doing wrong and Ameni, who has some other great scheme in his mind, has forbidden him the temple of Seti; that will work on the crowd!  You know how things are going on in Syria: Rameses has suffered much at the hands of the Cheta and their allies; whole legions are weary of eternally lying in the field, and if things came to extremities would join us; but, perhaps, especially if Paaker acquits himself well, we may be victorious without fighting.  Above all things now we must act rapidly.\"  \"I no longer recognize the timid, cautious lover of delay!\"  exclaimed Katuti.  \"Because now prudent hesitation would be want of prudence,\" said Ani.  \"And if the king should get timely information as to what is happening here?\"  said Katuti.  \"I said so!\"  exclaimed Ani; \"we are exchanging parts.\"  \"You are mistaken,\" said Katuti.  \"I also am for pressing forwards; but I would remind you of a necessary precaution.  No letters but yours must reach the camp for the next few weeks.\"  \"Once more you and the priests are of one mind,\" said Ani laughing; 'for Ameni gave me the same counsel.  Whatever letters are sent across the frontier between Pelusium and the Red Sea will be detained.  Only my letters--in which I complain of the piratical sons of the desert who fall upon the messengers--will reach the king.\"  \"That is wise,\" said the widow; \"let the seaports of the Red Sea be watched too, and the public writers.  When you are king, you can distinguish those who are affected for or against you.\"  Ani shook his head and replied:  \"That would put me in a difficult position; for it I were to punish those who are now faithful to their king, and exalt the others, I should have to govern with unfaithful servants, and turn away the faithful ones.  You need not color, my kind friend, for we are kin, and my concerns are yours.\"  Katuti took the hand he offered her and said:  \"It is so.  And I ask no further reward than to see my father's house once more in the enjoyment of its rights.\"  \"Perhaps we shall achieve it,\" said Ani; \"but in a short time if--if-- Reflect, Katuti; try to find out, ask your daughter to help you to the utmost.  Who is it that she--you know whom I mean--Who is it that Bent- Anat loves?\"  The widow started, for Ani had spoken the last words with a vehemence very foreign to his usual courtliness, but soon she smiled and repeated to the Regent the names of the few young nobles who had not followed the king, and remained in Thebes.  \"Can it be Chamus?\"  at last she said, \"he is at the camp, it is true, but nevertheless--\"  At this instant Nemu, who had not lost a word of the conversation, came in as if straight from the garden and said:  \"Pardon me, my lady; but I have heard a strange thing.\"  \"Speak,\" said Katuti.  The high and mighty princess Bent-Anat, the daughter of Rameses, is said to have an open love-affair with a young priest of the House of Seti.\"  \"You barefaced scoundrel!\"  exclaimed Ani, and his eyes sparkled with rage.  \"Prove what you say, or you lose your tongue.\"  \"I am willing to lose it as a slanderer and traitor according to the law,\" said the little man abjectly, and yet with a malicious laugh; \"but this time I shall keep it, for I can vouch for what I say.  You both know that Bent-Anat was pronounced unclean because she stayed for an hour and more in the house of a paraschites.  She had an assignation there with the priest.  At a second, in the temple of Hatasu, they were surprised by Septah, the chief of the haruspices of the House of Seti.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5445"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 07 (#1)"],["body","daughter of Rameses.  It was she herself, and the rascal was the young prince Rameri, who was yesterday forbidden this temple.\"  \"Oho!\"  cried the old master of the hunt.  \"Oho! my lord!  Is this the way to speak of the children of the king?\"  Others of the company who were attached to Pharaoh's family expressed their indignation; but Ameni whispered to Paaker--\"Say no more!\" then he continued aloud:  \"You never were careful in weighing your words, my friend, and now, as it seems to me, you are speaking in the heat of fever.  Come here, Gagabu, and examine Paaker's wound, which is no disgrace to him--for it was inflicted by a prince.\"  The old man loosened the bandage from the pioneer's swollen hand.  \"That was a bad blow,\" he exclaimed; \"three fingers are broken, and--do you see?--the emerald too in your signet ring.\"  Paaker looked down at his aching fingers, and uttered a sigh of rehef, for it was not the oracular ring with the name of Thotmes III., but the valuable one given to his father by the reigning king that had been crushed.  Only a few solitary fragments of the splintered stone remained in the setting; the king's name had fallen to pieces, and disappeared. Paaker's bloodless lips moved silently, and an inner voice cried out to him: \"The Gods point out the way!  The name is gone, the bearer of the name must follow.\"  \"It is a pity about the ring,\" said Gagabu.  \"And if the hand is not to follow it--luckily it is your left hand--leave off drinking, let yourself be taken to Nebsecht the surgeon, and get him to set the joints neatly, and bind them up.\"  Paaker rose, and went away after Ameni had appointed to meet him on the following day at the Temple of Seti, and the Regent at the palace.  When the door had closed behind him, the treasurer of the temple said:  \"This has been a bad day for the Mohar, and perhaps it will teach him that here in Thebes he cannot swagger as he does in the field.  Another adventure occurred to him to-day; would you like to hear it?\"  \"Yes; tell it!\"  cried the guests.  \"You all knew old Seni,\" began the treasurer.  \"He was a rich man, but he gave away all his goods to the poor, after his seven blooming sons, one after another, had died in the war, or of illness.  He only kept a small house with a little garden, and said that as the Gods had taken his children to themselves in the other world he would take pity on the forlorn in this.  'Feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked' says the law; and now that Seni has nothing more to give away, he goes through the city, as you know, hungry and thirsty himself, and scarcely clothed, and begging for his adopted children, the poor.  We have all given to him, for we all know for whom he humbles himself, and holds out his hand.  To-day he went round with his little bag, and begged, with his kind good eyes, for alms.  Paaker has given us a good piece of arable land, and thinks, perhaps with reason, that he has done his part.  When Seni addressed him, he told him to go; but the old man did not give up asking him, he followed him persistently to the grave of his father, and a great many people with him.  Then the pioneer pushed him angrily back, and when at last the beggar clutched his garment, he raised his whip, and struck him two or three times, crying out: 'There- that is your portion!'  The good old man bore it quite patiently, while he untied the bag, and said with tears in his eyes: 'My portion--yes-- but not the portion of the poor!'  \"I was standing near, and I saw how Paaker hastily withdrew into the tomb, and how his mother Setchem threw her full purse to Seni.  Others followed her example, and the old man never had a richer harvest.  The poor may thank the Mohar!  A crowd of people collected in front of the tomb, and he would have fared badly if it had not been for the police guard who drove them away.\"  During this narrative, which was heard with much approval--for no one is more secure of his result than he who can tell of the downfall of a man who is disliked for his arrogance--the Regent and the high-priest had been eagerly whispering to each other.  \"There can be no doubt,\" said Ameni, that Bent-Anat did actually come to the festival.\"  \"And had also dealings with the priest whom you so warmly defend,\" whispered the other.  \"Pentaur  shall  be  questioned this very night,\" returned the high- priest.  \"The dishes will soon be taken away, and the drinking will begin.  Let us go and hear what the poet says.\"  \"But there are now no witnesses,\" replied Ani.  \"We do not need them,\" said Ameni.  \"He is incapable of a lie.\"  \"Let us go then,\" said the Regent smiling, \"for I am really curious about this white negro, and how he will come to terms with the truth.  You have forgotten that there is a woman in the case.\"  \"That there always is!\"  answered Ameni; he called Gagabu to him, gave him his seat, begged him to keep up the flow of cheerful conversation, to encourage the guests to drink, and to interrupt all talk of the king, the state, or the war.  \"You know,\" he concluded, \"that we are not by ourselves this evening. Wine has, before this, betrayed everything!  Remember this--the mother of foresight looks backwards!\"  Ani clapped his hand on the old man's shoulder.  \"There will be a space cleared to-night in your winelofts.  It is said of you that you cannot bear to see either a full glass or an empty one; to-night give your aversion to both free play.  And when you think it is the right moment, give a sign to my steward, who is sitting there in the corner.  He has a few jars of the best liquor from Byblos, that he brought over with him, and he will bring it to you.  I will come in again and bid you good- night.\"  Ameni was accustomed to leave the hall at the beginning of the drinking.  When the door was closed behind him and his companion, when fresh rose- garlands had been brought for the necks of the company, when lotus blossoms decorated their heads, and the beakers were refilled, a choir of musicians came in, who played on harps, lutes, flutes, and small drums. The conductor beat the time by clapping his hands, and when the music had raised the spirits of the drinkers, they seconded his efforts by rhythmical clippings.  The jolly old Gagabu kept up his character as a stout drinker, and leader of the feast.  The most priestly countenances soon beamed with cheerfulness, and the officers and courtiers outdid each other in audacious jokes.  Then the old man signed to a young temple-servant, who wore a costly wreath; he came forward with a small gilt image of a mummy, carried it round the circle and cried:  \"Look at this, be merry and drink so long as you are on earth, for soon you must be like this.\"       [A custom mentioned by Herodotus.  Lucian saw such an image brought      in at a feast.  The Greeks adopted the idea, but beautified it,      using a winged Genius of death instead of a mummy.  The Romans also      had their \"larva.\"]  Gagabu gave another signal, and the Regent's steward brought in the wine from Byblos.  Ani was much lauded for the wonderful choiceness of the liquor.  \"Such wine,\" exclaimed the usually grave chief of the pastophori, \"is like soap.\"       [This comparison is genuinely Eastern.  Kisra called wine \"the soap      of sorrow.\"  The Mohammedans, to whom wine is forbidden, have      praised it like the guests of the House of Seti.  Thus Abdelmalik      ibn Salih Haschimi says: \"The best thing the world enjoys is wine.\"      Gahiz says: \"When wine enters thy bones and flows through thy limbs      it bestows truth of feeling, and perfects the soul; it removes      sorrow, elevates the mood, etc., etc.\"  When Ibn 'Aischah was told      that some one drank no wine, he said: \"He has thrice disowned the      world.\"  Ibn el Mu'tazz sang:       \"Heed not time, how it may linger, or how swiftly take its flight,      Wail thy sorrows only to the wine before thee gleaming bright.      But when thrice thou st drained the beaker watch and ward          keep o'er thy heart.      Lest the foam of joy should vanish, and thy soul with anguish smart,      This for every earthly trouble is a sovereign remedy,      Therefore listen to my counsel, knowing what will profit thee,      Heed not time, for ah, how many a man has longed in pain      Tale of evil days to lighten--and found all his longing vain.\"                          --Translated by Mary J. Safford.]  \"What a simile!\"  cried Gagabu.  \"You must explain it.\"  \"It cleanses the soul of sorrow,\" answered the other.  \"Good, friend!\" they all exclaimed.  \"Now every one in turn shall praise the noble juice in some worthy saying.\"  \"You begin--the chief prophet of the temple of Atnenophis.\"  \"Sorrow is a poison,\" said the priest, \"and wine is the antidote.\"  \"Well said!--go on; it is your turn, my lord privy councillor.\"  \"Every thing has its secret spring,\" said the official, \"and wine is the secret of joy.\"  \"Now you, my lord keeper of the seal.\"  \"Wine seals the door on discontent, and locks the gates on sorrow.\"  \"That it does, that it certainly does!--Now the governor of Hermothis, the oldest of all the company.\"  \"Wine ripens especially for us old folks, and not for you young people.\"  \"That you must explain,\" cried a voice from the table of the military officers.  \"It makes young men of the old,\" laughed the octogenarian, \"and children of the young.\"  \"He has you there, you youngsters,\" cried Gagabu.  \"What have you to say, Septah?\"  \"Wine is a poison,\" said the morose haruspex, \"for it makes fools of wise men.\"  \"Then you have little to fear from it, alas!\"  said Gagabu laughing. \"Proceed, my lord of the chase.\"  \"The rim of the beaker,\" was the answer, \"is like the lip of the woman you love.  Touch it, and taste it, and it is as good as the kiss of a bride.\"  \"General--the turn is yours.\"  \"I wish the Nile ran with such wine instead of with water,\" cried the soldier, \"and that I were as big as the colossus of Atnenophis, and that"]]]
