His searching flesh struck another's, and into his mind flooded the Ul Caada's terrified thought. The old one had reacted quicker than he, perhaps because he was poaching, but like himself he was attached and could not break free.  \"Serves you right,\" Kworn projected grimly. \"The thing was on my land. You had no right to feed upon it.\"  \"Get me loose!\" Caada screamed. His body flopped at the end of a thick mass of digestive tissue, dangling from the line, writhing and struggling in mindless terror. It was strange, Kworn thought, that fear should be so much stronger in the old than in the young.  \"Cut loose, you fool,\" Kworn projected. \"There isn't enough of you adhered to hurt if it were lost. A little body substance isn't worth your life. Hurry! You'll be too late if you don't. That metal is poisonous to our flesh.\"  \"But it will be pain to cut my absorbing surface,\" Caada protested.  \"It will be death if you don't.\"  \"Then why don't you?\"  \"I can't,\" Kworn said hopelessly. \"All my surface is stuck to the filament. I can't cut free.\" He was calm now, resigned to the inevitable. His greed had brought him to this. Perhaps it was a fitting punishment. But Caada need not die if he would show courage.  He rotated his eye to watch his struggling neighbor. Apparently Caada was going to take his advice. The tissue below the part of him stuck to the filament began to thin. His pseudopod broke contact. But his movements were slow and hesitant. Already his body mass was rising above the edge of the disc.  \"Quick, you fool!\" Kworn projected. \"Another moment and you're dead!\"  But Caada couldn't hear. Slowly his tissues separated as he reluctantly abandoned his absorptive surface. But he was already over the disc. The last cells pinched off and he fell, mantle flapping, full on the surface of the disc. For a moment he lay there quivering, and then his body was blotted from sight by a cloud of frozen steam, and his essence vanished screaming into Emptiness.         *       *       *       *       *  Kworn shuddered. It was a terrible way to die. But his own fate would be no better. He wrapped his mantle tightly around him as his leading parts vanished into the dark hole in the cylinder. In a moment he would be following Caada on the journey from which no member of the Folk had ever returned. His body disappeared into the hole.  --and was plunged into paradise!  His foreparts slipped into a warm, thick liquid that loosened the adhesive that bound him to the cord. As he slipped free, he slowly realized that he was not to die. He was bathed in liquid food! He was swimming in it! He was surrounded on all sides by incredible flavors so strange and delicious that his mind could not classify them! The filament had been good, but this--this was indescribable! He relaxed, his mantle spreading through the food, savoring, absorbing, digesting, metabolizing, excreting. His energy levels peaked. The nuclei of his germ plasm swelled, their chromosomes split, and a great bud formed and separated from his body. He had reproduced!  Through a deadening fog of somatic sensation, he realized dully that this was wrong, that the time wasn't right, that the space was limited, and that the natural reaction to abundant food supply was wrong. But for the moment he didn't care.  For thousands of seasons he had traveled the paths between equator and pole in a ceaseless hunt for food, growing and rejuvenating in good seasons, shrinking and aging in bad. He had been bound to the soil, a slave to the harsh demands of life and Nature. And now the routine was broken.  He luxuriated in his freedom. It must have been like this in the old days, when the waters were plentiful and things grew in them that could be eaten, and the Folk had time to dream young dreams and think young thoughts, and build their thoughts and dreams into the gleaming realities of cities and machines. Those were the days when the mind went above the soil into the air and beyond it to the moons, the sun and the evening stars.  But that was long ago.  He lay quietly, conscious of the change within him as his cells multiplied to replace those he had lost, and his body grew in weight and size. He was rejuvenated. The cells of his growing body, stimulated by the abundance of food, released memories he had forgotten he had ever possessed. His past ran in direct cellular continuity to the dawn of his race, and in him was every memory he had experienced since the beginning. Some were weak, others were stronger, but all were there awaiting an effort of recall. All that was required was enough stimulation to bring them out of hiding.  And for the first time in millennia the stimulus was available. The stimulus was growth, the rapid growth that only an abundant food supply could give, the sort of growth that the shrunken environment outside could not supply. With sudden clarity he saw how the Folk had shrunk in mind and body as they slowly adapted to the ever-increasing rigor of life. The rushing torrent of memory and sensation that swept through him gave him a new awareness of what he had been once and what he had become. His eye was lifted from the dirt and lichens.         *       *       *       *       *  What he saw filled him with pity and contempt. Pity for what the Folk had become; contempt for their failure to recognize it. Yet he had been no better than the others. It was only through the accident of this artefact that he had learned. The Folk _couldn't_ know what the slow dwindling of their food supply had done to them. Over the millennia they had adapted, changing to fit the changing conditions, surviving only because they were more intelligent and more tenacious than the other forms of life that had become extinct. A thousand thousand seasons had passed since the great war that had devastated the world. A million years of slow adaptation to the barren waste that had been formed when the ultimate products of Folk technology were loosed on their creators, had created a race tied to a subsistence level of existence, incapable of thinking beyond the basic necessities of life.  The Ul Kworn sighed. It would be better if he would not remember so much. But he could suppress neither the knowledge nor the memories. They crowded in upon him, stimulated by the food in which he floated.  Beside him, his offspring was growing. A bud always grew rapidly in a favorable environment, and this one was ideal. Soon it would be as large as himself. Yet it would never develop beyond an infant. It could not mature without a transfer of germ plasm from other infants of the Folk. And there were no infants.  It would grow and keep on growing because there would be no check of maturity upon its cells. It would remain a partly sentient lump of flesh that would never be complete. And in time it would be dangerous. When it had depleted the food supply it would turn on him in mindless hunger. It wouldn't realize that the Ul Kworn was its father, or if it did, it wouldn't care. An infant is ultimately selfish, and its desires are the most important thing in its restricted universe.  Kworn considered his situation dispassionately.  It was obvious that he must escape from this trap before his offspring destroyed him. Yet he could think of no way to avoid the poison metal. He recognized it now, the element with the twelve protons in its nucleus, a light metal seldom used by the Folk even in the days of their greatness because of its ability to rapidly oxidize and its propensity to burst into brilliant flame when heated. With sudden shock he realized that the artefact was nothing less than a gigantic torch!  Why had it been built like this? What was its function? Where had it come from? Why hadn't it spoke since it had released that flood of unintelligible gibberish before it had drawn him inside? Ever since he had entered this food tank it had been quiet except for a clicking, chattering whir that came from somewhere above him. He had the odd impression that it was storing information about him and the way he reacted in the tank.  And then, abruptly, it broke into voice. Cryptic words poured from it, piercing him with tiny knives of sound. The intensity and rapidity of the projections shocked him, left him quivering and shaking when they stopped as abruptly as they had begun.  In the quiet that followed, Kworn tried to recall the sequence of the noise. The words were like nothing he had ever heard. They were not the language of the Folk either past or present. And they had a flow and sequence that was not organic. They were mechanical, the product of a metal intelligence that recorded and spoke but did not think. The Folk had machines like that once.  How had it begun? There had been a faint preliminary, an almost soundless voice speaking a single word. Perhaps if he projected it, it would trigger a response. Pitching his voice in the same key and intensity he projected the word as best he could remember it.  And the voice began again.         *       *       *       *       *  Kworn quivered with excitement. Something outside the artefact was forcing it to speak. He was certain of it. As certain as he was that the artefact was recording himself and his offspring. But who--or what--was receiving the record? And why?  This could be a fascinating speculation, Kworn thought. But there would be time enough for that later. His immediate need was to get out. Already the food supply was running low, and his offspring was becoming enormous. He'd have to leave soon if he was ever going to. And he'd have to do something about his own growth. Already it was reaching dangerous levels. He was on the ragged edge of another reproduction, and he couldn't afford it.  Regretfully, he began moving the cornified cells of his mantle and his under layer toward his inner surfaces, arranging them"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50905"],["title","Yesterday House (#1)"],["body","people your own age!\"  \"You're the first one I ever met.\" She hesitated. \"I never saw a boy or a man before, except in movies.\"  \"You're joking!\"  \"No, it's true.\"  \"But why are they doing it to you?\" he demanded, leaning forward. \"Why are they inflicting this loneliness on you, Mary?\"         *       *       *       *       *  She seemed to have gained poise from his loss of it. \"I don't know why. I'm to find out soon. But actually I'm not lonely. May I tell you a secret?\" She touched his hand, this time with only the faintest trembling. \"Every night the loneliness gathers in around me--you're right about that. But then every morning new life comes to me in a little box.\"  \"What's that?\" he said sharply.  \"Sometimes there's a poem in the box, sometimes a book, or pictures, or flowers, or a ring, but always a note. Next to the notes I like the poems best. My favorite is the one by Matthew Arnold that ends,      'Ah, love, let us be true     To one another! for the world, which seems     To lie before us like a land of dreams,     So various, so beautiful, so new,     Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,     Nor certitude--'\"  \"Wait a minute,\" he interrupted. \"Who sends you these boxes?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"But how are the notes signed?\"  \"They're wonderful notes,\" she said. \"So wise, so gay, so tender, you'd imagine them being written by John Barrymore or Lindbergh.\"  \"Yes, but how are they signed?\"  She hesitated. \"Never anything but 'Your Lover.'\"  \"And so when you first saw me, you thought--\" He began, then stopped because she was blushing.  \"How long have you been getting them?\"  \"Ever since I can remember. I have two closets of the boxes. The new ones are either by my bed when I wake or at my place at breakfast.\"  \"But how does this--person get these boxes to you out here? Does he give them to your aunts and do they put them there?\"  \"I'm not sure.\"  \"But how can they get them in winter?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"Look here,\" he said, pouring himself more lemonade, \"how long is it since you've been to the mainland?\"  \"Almost eighteen years. My aunts tell me I was born there in the middle of the war.\"  \"What war?\" he asked startledly, spilling some lemonade.  \"The World War, of course. What's the matter?\"  Jack Barr was staring down at the spilled lemonade and feeling a kind of terror he'd never experienced in his waking life. Nothing around him had changed. He could still feel the same hot sun on his shoulders, the same icy glass in his hand, scent the same lemon-acid odor in his nostrils. He could still hear the faint _chop-chop_ of the waves.  And yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a landscape glimpsed just before a faint. All the little false notes had come to a sudden focus. For the lemonade had spilled on the headline of the newspaper the girl had tossed down, and the headline read:                          HITLER IN NEW DEFIANCE  Under the big black banner of that head swam smaller ones:                      Foes of Machado Riot in Havana                          Big NRA Parade Planned                         Balbo Speaks in New York         *       *       *       *       *  Suddenly he felt a surge of relief. He had noticed that the paper was yellow and brittle-edged.  \"Why are you so interested in old newspapers?\" he asked.  \"I wouldn't call day-before-yesterday's paper old,\" the girl objected, pointing at the dateline: July 20, 1933.  \"You're trying to joke,\" Jack told her.  \"No, I'm not.\"  \"But it's 1953.\"  \"Now it's you who are joking.\"  \"But the paper's yellow.\"  \"The paper's always yellow.\"  He laughed uneasily. \"Well, if you actually think it's 1933, perhaps you're to be envied,\" he said, with a sardonic humor he didn't quite feel. \"Then you can't know anything about the Second World War, or television, or the V-2s, or Bikini bathing suits, or the atomic bomb, or--\"  \"Stop!\" She had sprung up and retreated around her chair, white-faced. \"I don't like what you're saying.\"  \"But--\"  \"No, please! Jokes that may be quite harmless on the mainland sound different here.\"  \"I'm really not joking,\" he said after a moment.  She grew quite frantic at that. \"I can show you all last week's papers! I can show you magazines and other things. I can prove it!\"  She started toward the house. He followed. He felt his heart begin to pound.  At the white door she paused, looking worriedly down the road. Jack thought he could hear the faint _chug_ of a motorboat. She pushed open the door and he followed her inside. The small-windowed room was dark after the sunlight. Jack got an impression of solid old furniture, a fireplace with brass andirons.  \"Flash!\" croaked a gritty voice. \"After their disastrous break day before yesterday, stocks are recovering. Leading issues....\"  Jack realized that he had started and had involuntarily put his arm around the girl's shoulders. At the same time he noticed that the voice was coming from the curved brown trumpet of an old-fashioned radio loudspeaker.  The girl didn't pull away from him. He turned toward her. Although her gray eyes were on him, her attention had gone elsewhere.  \"I can hear the car. They're coming back. They won't like it that you're here.\"  \"All right they won't like it.\"  Her agitation grew. \"No, you must go.\"  \"I'll come back tomorrow,\" he heard himself saying.  \"Flash! It looks as if the World Economic Conference may soon adjourn, mouthing jeers at old Uncle Sam who is generally referred to as Uncle Shylock.\"  Jack felt a numbness on his neck. The room seemed to be darkening, the girl growing stranger still.  \"You must go before they see you.\"  \"Flash! Wiley Post has just completed his solo circuit of the Globe, after a record-breaking flight of 7 days, 18 hours and 45 minutes. Asked how he felt after the energy-draining feat, Post quipped....\"         *       *       *       *       *  He was halfway across the lawn before he realized the terror into which the grating radio voice had thrown him.  He leaped for the branch over-hanging the fence, vaulted up with the risky help of a foot on the barbed top. A surprised squirrel, lacking time to make its escape up the trunk, sprang to the ground ahead of him. With terrible suddenness, two steel-jawed semicircles clanked together just over the squirrel's head. Jack landed with one foot to either side of the sprung trap, while the squirrel darted off with a squeak.  Jack plunged down the slope to the rocky spine and ran across it, spray from the rising waves spattering him to the waist. Panting now, he stumbled up into the oaks and undergrowth of the first island, fought his way through it, finally reached the silent cove. He loosed the line of the _Annie O._, dragged it as near to the cove's mouth as he could, plunged knee-deep in freezing water to give it a final shove, scrambled aboard, snatched up the boathook and punched at the rocks.  As soon as the _Annie O._ was nosing out of the cove into the cross waves, he yanked up the sail. The freshening wind filled it and sent the sloop heeling over, with inches of white water over the lee rail, and plunging ahead.  For a long while, Jack was satisfied to think of nothing but the wind and the waves and the sail and speed and danger, to have all his attention taken up balancing one against the other, so that he wouldn't have to ask himself what year it was and whether time was an illusion, and wonder about flappers and hidden traps.  When he finally looked back at the island, he was amazed to see how tiny it had grown, as distant as the mainland.  Then he saw a gray motorboat astern. He watched it as it slowly overtook him. It was built like a lifeboat, with a sturdy low cabin in the bow and wheel amidship. Whoever was at the wheel had long gray hair that whipped in the wind. The longer he looked, the surer he was that it was a woman wearing a lace dress. Something that stuck up inches over the cabin flashed darkly beside her. Only when she lifted it to the roof of the cabin did it occur to him that it might be a rifle.  But just then the motorboat swung around in a turn that sent waves drenching over it, and headed back toward the island. He watched it for a minute in wonder, then his attention was jolted by an angry hail.  Three fishing smacks, also headed toward town, were about to cross his bow. He came around into the wind and waited with shaking sail, watching a man in a lumpy sweater shake a fist at him. Then he turned and gratefully followed the dark, wide, fanlike sterns and age-yellowed sails.   II  The exterior of Martin Kesserich's home--a weathered white cube with narrow, sharp-paned windows, topped by a cupola--was nothing like its lavish interior.  In much the same way, Mrs. Kesserich clashed with the darkly gleaming furniture, persian rugs and bronze vases around her. Her shapeless black form, poised awkwardly on the edge of a huge sofa, made Jack think of a cow that had strayed into the drawing room. He wondered again how a man like Kesserich had come to marry such a creature.  Yet when she lifted up her little eyes from the shadows, he had the uneasy feeling that she knew a great deal about him. The eyes were still those of a domestic animal, but of a wise one that has been watching the house a long, long while from the barnyard.  He asked abruptly, \"Do you know anything of a girl around here named Mary Alice Pope?\"  The silence lasted so long that he began to think she'd gone into some bovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went over to a tall cabinet. Feeling on a ledge behind it for a key, she opened a panel, opened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and handed him a photograph. He held it up to the failing light and sucked in his breath with surprise.  It was a picture of the girl he'd met that afternoon. Same flat-bosomed dress--flowered rather than white--no bandeau, same beads. Same proud, demure expression, perhaps a bit happier.  \"That is Mary Alice Pope,\" Mrs. Kesserich said in a"]]]
