He sits at the        head of the table and the best man opposite,        and on this occasion he may give scarf-pins,        link cuff-buttons--or neckties and gloves, if        he wishes--to the best man and ushers.    BACHELORS' LUNCHEONS. These are conducted like        BACHELOR'S DINNERS, which see. The one difference        is that, should the luncheon be given        before 6 P.M., afternoon dress should be worn.    BACHELORS' OPERA PARTIES. See THEATRE AND OPERA        PARTIES GIVEN BY MEN.    BACHELORS' SUPPERS. These are conducted the same        as BACHELOR'S DINNERS, which see.    BACHELORS' TEAS OR AFTERNOON RECEPTIONS.    CHAPERONES. If women are present, a married        chaperone is indispensable, who should be        the first person invited by personal call.         The chaperone at a small affair pours the        tea, and at a large one she receives with the        host, and each guest is presented to her.         The host conducts the chaperone to her        carriage, and also any other women who may        have assisted her.    DRESS. The hosts and guests wear afternoon        dress.    INVITATIONS. These maybe oral, brief notes, or,        for a large affair, engraved, and should be        sent from three days to a week in advance.    HOST. The host should greet his guests at the        door, shaking hands with each one, and introducing        to the chaperone those not known        to her.         He introduces guests who are strangers to        each other, bids them adieu, accompanies the        women to the door, and escorts the chaperone        to her carriage, and if she has come        alone without one, may very properly escort        her home.         If at a large reception several women have        helped him entertain, he should thank them        and see them to their carriages.         He will, of course, see that there is provided        a dressing-room for women with a maid to        wait upon them, and that the rooms are in        good order, well furnished with flowers, and        that the refreshments are attended to.          See also INVITATIONS.    MEN. Afternoon dress is worn.    WOMEN. The invitations, engraved or oral,        should be promptly acknowledged.         Women wear dress customary at afternoon        teas, and on their entrance should greet the        host. Upon departing they take leave of him,        though this is not necessary if the reception        be a large one.         If a young woman knows that a chaperone        is present, she need not have her own chaperone        accompany her.         If the chaperone leaves early, she should do        likewise.    BACHELORS' THEATRE PARTY. See THEATRE AND OPERA        PARTIES GIVEN BY MEN.    BADGES--BALLS (PUBLIC). It is customary for men        and women on the committees to wear on the        left side of the breast ornamental badges,        embroidered with the official position of the        wearer.    BAGGAGE. If a man is traveling with a woman, he        should see to the checking and care of her        baggage.          See also TRAVELING.    WEDDING TRIP. The best man should, some        time before the wedding, see that the baggage        of the bridal couple has been checked, and        the checks given to the groom.          See also BEST MAN.    BALLS. A ball is an evening function, beginning at        a late hour, devoted wholly to dancing. The        costumes are more elaborate, the supper arrangements        more extensive, and the floral        decorations more lavish than at a dance.    ACCEPTING INVITATION TO DANCE. While a        young woman may accept or decline any invitation        to dance, it is considered an act of discourtesy        to refuse one man for a dance and        to accept an invitation thereafter for the        same dance from another.    ANNOUNCING GUESTS. The hostess decides        whether or not the guests are to be announced.        At public balls it is customary.    ANSWERING INVITATIONS. These should be answered        immediately, and if declined, the        ticket should be returned.    ARRIVING AT. There is no set rule when guests        should arrive.         In the city, guests should arrive anywhere        between eleven and twelve, and in the country,        fifteen minutes after the hour set in the        invitation.    ASKING WOMEN TO DANCE. A man asks for        the privilege of a dance either with the        daughter of the hostess, with any guest of        the latter, or with any young woman receiving        with her.         On being introduced to a woman, he may        ask her for a dance, and should be punctual        in keeping the engagement.         It is her privilege to end the dance at any        moment she wishes, after which he should        conduct her to her chaperone or find a seat        for her, after which he is at liberty to go        elsewhere.         If for any cause a man has to break his        engagements to dance, he should personally        explain the matter to every woman with        whom he has an engagement and make a        suitable apology.    BALLS, ASSEMBLY. The etiquette at an assembly        ball is much the same as at a private ball,        the functions and duties of the hostess being        filled by a committee of women selected for        that purpose.         On entering the room, the guests bow to        the committee and pass on.         It is not necessary to take leave of the        committee.    CARRIAGE. A man should provide a carriage        in which to call for the woman he escorts        and her chaperone.    CHAPERONES. For a small ball given in a private        house, the hostess need not invite the mothers        of the young women, and the young women        can properly attend, knowing that the hostess        will act as a chaperone.         But at a large ball it is necessary to invite        the mother as well as the daughters, and        the chaperone as well as the debutante under        her care. The mother can send regrets for        herself, and send her daughters in care of a        maid. Or she can attend, and, after remaining        a suitable time, she may entrust her        daughter to the care of a chaperone who        intends to remain the whole evening.    BALLS FOR DEBUTANTE.    DRESS. A debutante should dress in white or        some extremely delicate color, and wear very        little jewelry--some simple brooch or single        piece of jewelry, or a slender chain of pearls.    DUTIES OF DAUGHTERS. Except at her own        debut, a daughter does not assist her mother        in receiving. She should be ready, however,        to see that young women have partners, and        to speak, without introduction, to strangers.    GUEST OF HONOR. If the ball is given in honor        of some special person, he should be met on        his arrival, introduced to the women of the        reception committee, escorted to the seat prepared        for him, and be looked after the entire        evening.         At the end of the ball he should be escorted        to his carriage.    DUTIES OF HOST. It is not necessary that a        man receive with his wife. He should do all        he can to help make the ball successful,        especially if his name appears on the invitation.        He should assist in finding partners        for the women, taking the chaperones into        supper, preventing the men from selfishly        remaining in the dressing-room, and at the        end escorting unattended women to their        carriages.         When a formal supper is served, he takes        into supper the leading chaperone.    DUTIES OF HOSTESS. As a ball is an entertainment        for dancing, it is better to give two        small balls where the guests are not crowded        than one where they are. It is permissible        for a hostess not having sufficient room to        hire rooms in some place suitable for the        purpose.         In selecting guests, it is wise to have more        men present than women.         The hostess should see to it that the rooms        are well ventilated and well lighted. An        awning and a carpet from the street to the        hall door should be provided.         The hostess should stand near the door,        prepared to receive the guests as they enter,        shaking hands with each one, friend or        stranger, and introducing any woman who        may receive with her.         A hostess herself should not dance until        late in the evening, unless she knows that        nearly all her guests have arrived.         A wise hostess will personally see that the        women are provided with partners, and that        diffident young men are introduced.         The hostess should see that the floor is        suitable for dancing, that music is arranged,        programs printed, that dressing-rooms, one        for the men and one for the women, are arranged        for with suitable attendants.         The hostess should stand where the guests        can take leave of her, and should shake        hands with each when leaving.    HOURS. In the city the hour for a ball to begin        is from 10.30 to 11 P.M., but in the country        the hour is earlier--from 9 to 9.30.         A public ball begins promptly at the time        mentioned in the announcement.    INVITATIONS. These are issued from ten to        twenty days before the ball, and should be        answered immediately.         For an impromptu dance, they may be        issued within a few days of the affair.         These invitations should be engraved. As        a general rule, it is not now customary to put        on them the letters R. S. V. P.         But when an engraved invitation is posted,        two envelopes are used, the inner one bearing        the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52574"],["title","Third Planet (#1)"],["body","hese, but artists drew them from descriptions of what would happen. Here it's happened! I think,\" he added, looking at the skipper, \"that this is more important than fifth planets. I think we'd better go over and get what information we can and take it home. Death like this implies life a lot like men. If non-human creatures can do something as human as this, we'd better get the word back home so something can be done to get ready before we find them--or they find us.\"  The skipper went carefully over the pictures. On one he put his finger on a feature Nolan hadn't mentioned. He seemed to wince.  \"I think you win, Nolan,\" he said painfully. \"We'll send a drone down. I doubt we can land, but this ought to be checked. Immediately. Maybe I should add--inconspicuously.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Confidentially,\" said the Com Ambassador to the Coordinator of the WDA, \"confidentially I agree that it is a trivial matter. But we are a new nation. Our people lack perspective. They rejoice in the strength and vigor of the nation of which they are citizens. They will not allow that nation to display what they consider weakness in any matter. One has to allow for a certain exuberance in the people of a nation newly freed from the tyranny of capitalists and warmongers such as still enslave the people of your countries. We cannot yield in this matter.\"  The Coordinator said:  \"To be confidential in my turn, we both know that what you just said simply isn't true. Your government decides what its public shall think. It makes sure they don't think anything it doesn't want them to.\"  The Com Ambassador shrugged his shoulders. He was very polite. He did not even pretend to resent being called a liar.  \"Now, my country intends to move forward in this matter in ten days,\" he observed. \"And it would be deplorable if our soldiers were fired on.\"   II  It turned out that it wouldn't have mattered if the _Lotus_ had sent screaming notifications of its presence throughout all nearby space. There were detectors out, of course, but they reported absolutely nothing as the _Lotus_ moved on toward Planet Three. There was static from storms upon the planet. It grew louder as the survey ship approached. But there was no sign of anything alive.  The _Lotus_ cruised some two hundred miles above seas and cloud masses and desert, photographing as she followed a search pattern that covered all the sunlit hemisphere. There were mountains in the tropics which by all the rules of meteorology should have had rain forests at their feet. They didn't. There was a river system which ran like the Nile for a thousand miles or more, through deserts like those of Egypt. There should have been at least a ribbon of vegetation along its banks. There wasn't. Where it reached the sea was an enormous delta.  A drone went down and reported temperatures and humidity and the composition of the atmosphere, and the radiation background count. One would have thought the records those of Earth. The background count was a trifle high--3.9 instead of 3.6--but there was eighteen per cent of oxygen in the atmosphere. The only oddity, there, was nearly a full per cent of helium. When the drone came up it brought samples of soil and sea water. There was no life in either. The soil was mostly mineral dust, but an electron microscope disclosed abraded fractions of pollen grains and the like. The sea water sample had evidently been picked up by the drone's dredge from some shallow. There were tiny, silicious shells in it. Plankton. They had been alive, but were so no longer.  \"I think,\" said Nolan, \"that I make a landing. Right?\"  The skipper said crossly, \"Yes. You're the best man for it. You notice things. But I doubt you'll learn very much.\" He tapped the written report that the radiation background count was 3.9. \"It happened a long time ago. A long, long time ago!\" Then he said with a totally unsuccessful attempt at humor, \"Try and find out that it was bug-eyed monsters, eh? It looks too much like Earth! I'd rather blame monsters than men!\"  Nolan growled and went to prepare for the landing. Two other men would go with him, of course. The _Lotus_ wouldn't descend. It cost fuel to make landings. Unless there was some remarkable specimen that a drone couldn't handle the ship would stay aloft.  So a drone took three of them down to ground, a second drone following with equipment. They had weapons, of course. Men never land anywhere without weapons. They had the material for a foam-house camp. They had a roller-jeep, running on huge inflated bags. It would run efficiently on anything from sand to swamp mud, and float itself across bogs or rivers. They had cameras and communicators. Nolan had picked Crawford for geology and Kelley for communications. They could get other specialists from the ship, if desirable.  The ground where they landed was desert: nothing more. There were enormous dunes like gigantic frozen swells of sand. Sometimes there were miles between crests. They landed close to the mud banks northern ice-cap to avoid the deep gorges in which rivers ran farther south. On the first day they set up their camp.  Mountains reared to the north of them, covered almost to their bases with ice. These they need not explore. Instruments would do most of the landing-party work, in any case. But they inflated small balloons and sent them skyward, to learn about currents of the upper air, and Crawford took painstaking photographs of dune formations, and they set up a weather radar. They checked the water recovery from the camp's air-conditioner. It would supply their needs. When night drew near, with all instruments recording, they watched the sunset.         *       *       *       *       *  It was amazing how splendid and how magnificent a sunset could be. Not many men see sunsets these days. The three of them, aground at the ice-cap's edge, saw enormous mile-long dunes reaching away as far as it was possible to see. They cast black shadows. Then glories of crimson and gold rose from the western horizon of this dead and empty world. There was ice and snow upon the mountains, and unbelievable tints and blends of colors appeared there. After a long, long time the light faded away. Then there was nothing to see but the stars, and nothing to listen to at all. This world was dead. They went in their camp-house and shut out the dark and the silence.  On the second day, Nolan went in search of permafrost. Their instruments faithfully recorded everything they needed except such items as this. Nolan found permanent ice in a valley of the northern mountains. It was perpetually frozen ground which might not have thawed in a thousand thousand years. He dug down through surface ice to the permanently frozen soil beneath it. That soil was not desert sand. And preserved in it Nolan found the blackened roots of plants, and the blackened blades of something like grass, and even some small, indefinite objects which had been seeds or fruit.  They hadn't died with the planet. They were far older than that catastrophe. But they were proof that once this world lived and throve.  During what was left of the day-light, Nolan and Kelley went south to a river gorge and photographed it for the record. The river had cut a gorge a full two hundred feet deep in the wind-deposited dust which was everywhere. There were now-dry gullies which undercut the dune-sides and at times dumped mud into the slowly flowing liquid of the river. There were no colorings save dust and mud. The river itself was mud. It flowed very, very slowly and without elation.  They came back depressed. An airless planet holds no life, but it defies life to establish itself. A methane-ammonia planet fights the intrusion of men with monstrous frigid storms. But this world was designed for life. That it was dead was tragedy. Its rivers flowed sullen, syrupy mud which moved reluctantly toward the lifeless seas.  Kelley wouldn't look at the sunset this second night. He went into the camp and turned on music. Crawford watched for a little while only. There were clouds. There were breezes. One knew that here and there rain fell in gentle showers which should have nourished grasses and flowers and filled the air with fragrance. But instead it fell upon impalpable dust and turned it to mud which flowed slowly into gullies and into rivers which were also mud and moved onward, until perhaps after years the soil would become part of a mud-bank in the ocean.  Nolan came into the foam-walled house and said shortly, \"We'll finish up tomorrow and leave.\"  Kelley said abruptly. \"Nobody's made any guess about why everything died, here. But we all know!\"  Crawford said reflectively, \"It must've taken a lot of intelligence to murder this planet. When d'you suppose it happened?\"  \"Ten thousand--twenty thousand years ago,\" said Nolan. \"The whole place must have been radioactive, air and all. But if they used cobalt the background count could be down to 3.9 in ten or twenty thousand years.\"  \"We haven't,\" said Kelley, \"seen any craters. Even the pictures from out in space didn't show bomb-craters.\"  \"When everything died and turned to dust,\" said Nolan, \"there'd be dust storms. There still must be. They'd cover anything! There was a terrific civilization in part of what's now the Sahara, back on Earth. By pure accident they've found a patch of highway and a post-house. Everything else is covered up. Cities, highways, dams, canals.... And that's heavy sand instead of fine dust! The _Lotus_ found some shadows on a photo. They want us to look and see what cast them. We'll look at it tomorrow and then leave.\"  Crawford said deliberately:  \"We three have had a preview of what Earth will be like before too long! I wonder if it would do any good on Earth to show them what we've found?\"  \"It's being argued on the ship,\" said Nolan. \"Some say we'd better suppress the whole business.\"  Crawford considered.  \"The Coms aren't a very believing people,\""]]]
