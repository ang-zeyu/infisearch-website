After a few moments had elapsed, she handed me the paper, on which I found written, in a large, uncultivated hand, the words:       He is not here, but has been sent for.  A pause of a minute or so now ensued, during which Mrs. Vulpes remained perfectly silent, but the raps continued at regular intervals. When the short period I mention had elapsed, the hand of the medium was again seized with its convulsive tremor, and she wrote, under this strange influence, a few words on the paper, which she handed to me. They were as follows:       I am here. Question me.                  LEEUWENHOEK.  I was astounded. The name was identical with that I had written beneath the table, and carefully kept concealed. Neither was it at all probable that an uncultivated woman like Mrs. Vulpes should know even the name of the great father of microscopics. It may have been biology; but this theory was soon doomed to be destroyed. I wrote on my slip--still concealing it from Mrs. Vulpes--a series of questions, which, to avoid tediousness, I shall place with the responses, in the order in which they occurred:      I.--Can the microscope be brought to perfection?      SPIRIT.--Yes.      I.--Am I destined to accomplish this great task?      SPIRIT.--You are.      I.--I wish to know how to proceed to attain this end. For the love     which you bear to science, help me!      SPIRIT.--A diamond of one hundred and forty carats, submitted to     electro-magnetic currents for a long period, will experience a     rearrangement of its atoms _inter se_, and from that stone you will     form the universal lens.      I.--Will great discoveries result from the use of such a lens?      SPIRIT.--So great that all that has gone before is as nothing.      I.--But the refractive power of the diamond is so immense, that the     image will be formed within the lens. How is that difficulty to be     surmounted?      SPIRIT.--Pierce the lens through its axis, and the difficulty is     obviated. The image will be formed in the pierced space, which will     itself serve as a tube to look through. Now I am called.     Good-night.  I can not at all describe the effect that these extraordinary communications had upon me. I felt completely bewildered. No biological theory could account for the _discovery_ of the lens. The medium might, by means of biological _rapport_ with my mind, have gone so far as to read my questions, and reply to them coherently. But biology could not enable her to discover that magnetic currents would so alter the crystals of the diamond as to remedy its previous defects, and admit of its being polished into a perfect lens. Some such theory may have passed through my head, it is true; but if so, I had forgotten it. In my excited condition of mind there was no course left but to become a convert, and it was in a state of the most painful nervous exaltation that I left the medium's house that evening. She accompanied me to the door, hoping that I was satisfied. The raps followed us as we went through the hall, sounding on the balusters, the flooring, and even the lintels of the door. I hastily expressed my satisfaction, and escaped hurriedly into the cool night air. I walked home with but one thought possessing me--how to obtain a diamond of the immense size required. My entire means multiplied a hundred times over would have been inadequate to its purchase. Besides, such stones are rare, and become historical. I could find such only in the regalia of Eastern or European monarchs.   _4. The Eye of Morning_  There was a light in Simon's room as I entered my house. A vague impulse urged me to visit him. As I opened the door of his sitting-room unannounced, he was bending, with his back toward me, over a carcel lamp, apparently engaged in minutely examining some object which he held in his hands. As I entered, he started suddenly, thrust his hand into his breast pocket, and turned to me with a face crimson with confusion.  \"What!\" I cried, \"poring over the miniature of some fair lady? Well, don't blush so much; I won't ask to see it.\"  Simon laughed awkwardly enough, but made none of the negative protestations usual on such occasions. He asked me to take a seat.  \"Simon,\" said I, \"I have just come from Madame Vulpes.\"  This time Simon turned as white as a sheet, and seemed stupefied, as if a sudden electric shock had smitten him. He babbled some incoherent words, and went hastily to a small closet where he usually kept his liquors. Although astonished at his emotion, I was too preoccupied with my own idea to pay much attention to anything else.  \"You say truly when you call Madame Vulpes a devil of a woman,\" I continued. \"Simon, she told me wonderful things tonight, or rather was the means of telling me wonderful things. Ah! if I could only get a diamond that weighed one hundred and forty carats!\"  Scarcely had the sigh with which I uttered this desire died upon my lips, when Simon, with the aspect of a wild beast, glared at me savagely, and, rushing to the mantelpiece, where some foreign weapons hung on the wall, caught up a Malay creese, and brandished it furiously before him.  \"No!\" he cried in French, into which he always broke when excited. \"No! you shall not have it! You are perfidious! You have consulted with that demon, and desire my treasure! But I shall die first! Me! I am brave! You can not make me fear!\"  All this, uttered in a loud voice trembling with excitement, astounded me. I saw at a glance that I had accidentally trodden upon the edges of Simon's secret, whatever it was. It was necessary to reassure him.  \"My dear Simon,\" I said, \"I am entirely at a loss to know what you mean. I went to Madame Vulpes to consult her on a scientific problem, to the solution of which I discovered that a diamond of the size I just mentioned was necessary. You were never alluded to during the evening, nor, so far as I was concerned, even thought of. What can be the meaning of this outburst? If you happen to have a set of valuable diamonds in your possession, you need fear nothing from me. The diamond which I require you could not possess; or, if you did possess it, you would not be living here.\"  Something in my tone must have completely reassured him; for his expression immediately changed to a sort of constrained merriment, combined, however, with a certain suspicious attention to my movements. He laughed, and said that I must bear with him; that he was at certain moments subject to a species of vertigo, which betrayed itself in incoherent speeches, and that the attacks passed off as rapidly as they came. He put his weapon aside while making this explanation, and endeavored, with some success, to assume a more cheerful air.  All this did not impose on me in the least. I was too much accustomed to analytical labors to be baffled by so flimsy a veil. I determined to probe the mystery to the bottom.  \"Simon,\" I said, gayly, \"let us forget all this over a bottle of Burgundy. I have a case of Lausseure's _Clos Vougeot_ downstairs, fragrant with the odors and ruddy with the sunlight of the CÃ´te d'Or. Let us have up a couple of bottles. What say you?\"  \"With all my heart,\" answered Simon, smilingly.  I produced the wine and we seated ourselves to drink. It was of a famous vintage, that of 1848, a year when war and wine throve together--and its pure but powerful juice seemed to impart renewed vitality to the system. By the time we had half finished the second bottle, Simon's head, which I knew was a weak one, had begun to yield, while I remained calm as ever, only that every draft seemed to send a flush of vigor through my limbs. Simon's utterance became more and more indistinct. He took to singing French _chansons_ of a not very moral tendency. I rose suddenly from the table just at the conclusion of one of those incoherent verses, and, fixing my eyes on him with a quiet smile, said: \"Simon, I have deceived you. I learned your secret this evening. You may as well be frank with me. Mrs. Vulpes, or rather one of her spirits, told me all.\"  He started with horror. His intoxication seemed for the moment to fade away, and he made a movement towards the weapon that he had a short time before laid down. I stopped him with my hand.  \"Monster,\" he cried, passionately, \"I am ruined! What shall I do? You shall never have it! I swear by my mother!\"  \"I don't want it,\" I said; \"rest secure, but be frank with me. Tell me all about it.\"  The drunkenness began to return. He protested with maudlin earnestness that I was entirely mistaken--that I was intoxicated; then asked me to swear eternal secrecy, and promised to disclose the mystery to me. I pledged myself, of course, to all. With an uneasy look in his eyes, and hands unsteady with drink and nervousness, he drew a small case from his breast and opened it. Heavens! How the mild lamplight was shivered into a thousand prismatic arrows, as it fell upon a vast rose-diamond that glittered in the case! I was no judge of diamonds, but I saw at a glance that this was a gem of rare size and purity. I looked at Simon with wonder, and--must I confess it?--with envy. How could he have obtained this treasure? In reply to my questions, I could just gather from his drunken statements (of which, I fancy, half the incoherence was affected) that he had been superintending a gang of slaves engaged in diamond-washing in Brazil; that he had seen one of them secrete a diamond, but, instead of informing his employers, had quietly watched the negro until he saw him bury his treasure; that he had dug it up and fled with it, but that as yet he was afraid to attempt to dispose of it publicly--so valuable a gem being almost certain to attract too much attention to its owner's antecedents--and he had not been able to discover any of those obscure channels by which such matters are conveyed away safely. He added, that, in accordance with the Oriental practise, he had named his diamond"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],["title","Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#1)"],["body"," membership in the United States, it was the great bulk of the Saints, as the following will show:  In the Times and Seasons, volume 2, page 274, in a \"Proclamation to the Saints scattered abroad,\" and signed by the Presidency Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, and Hyrum Smith, dated January 15, 1841, we read the following:      \"The population of our city is increasing with unparalleled     rapidity, numbering more than 3,000 inhabitants. Every facility     is offered in the city and adjacent country, in Hancock county,     for the successful prosecution of the mechanical arts, and the     pleasing pursuits of agriculture. The waters of the Mississippi     can be successfully used for manufacturing purposes, to an almost     unlimited extent.      \"Having been instrumental in the hands of our Heavenly Father     in laying a foundation for the gathering of Zion, we would say,     let all those who appreciate the blessings of the Gospel, and     realize the importance of obeying the commandments of heaven, who     have been blessed of heaven with the possession of this world's     goods, first prepare for the general gathering, let them dispose     of their effects as fast as circumstances will possibly admit,     without making too great sacrifice, and remove to our city and     county--establish and build up manufactories in the city, purchase     and cultivate farms in the county--this will secure our permanent     inheritance, and prepare the way for the gathering of the poor.     This is agreeable to the order of heaven, and the only principle on     which the gathering can be effected--let the rich, then, and all     who can assist in establishing this place, make every preparation     to come on without delay, and strengthen our hands, and assist in     promoting the happiness of the Saints. This cannot be too forcibly     impressed on the minds of all, and the elders are hereby instructed     to proclaim this word in all places where the Saints reside,     in their public administrations, for this is according to the     instructions we have received from the Lord.\"  Now, this shows that the Saints \"scattered abroad\" were commanded of the Lord to gather at Nauvoo and in Hancock county, Illinois. It will go without saying that all the faithful Latter-day Saints would take advantage of this commandment and therefore the faithful Saints, or the great majority of them would soon be located at Nauvoo. Again in this same volume, page 434, we find another proclamation to the Saints abroad, signed by President Joseph Smith, in which he says:      \"The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day     Saints, anxious to promote the prosperity of said Church, feel it     their duty to call upon the Saints who reside out of this county     to make preparations to come in, without delay. This is important     and should be attended to by all who feel an interest in the     prosperity of this the corner stone of Zion. Here the Temple must     be raised, the university be built, and other edifices erected     which are necessary for the great work of the last days; and which     can only be done by a concentration of energy and enterprise. Let     it therefore be understood, that all the stakes, excepting those     in this county and in Lee county, Iowa, are discontinued, and the     Saints instructed to settle in this county as soon as circumstances     will permit.\"  This was on May 24, 1841, and we find in the same volume, page 520, an epistle from the Twelve to the \"Saints scattered abroad,\" in which the following is found:      \"We say to all Saints who desire to do the will of heaven, arise,     and tarry not, but come up hither to the places of gathering as     speedily as possible, for the time is rapidly approaching when     the Saints will have occasion to regret that they have so long     neglected to assemble themselves together and stand in holy places     awaiting those tremendous events which are so rapidly approaching     the nations of the earth.      \"It will be recollected that in a recent communication from the     First Presidency, all places of gathering are discontinued,     excepting Hancock county, Ill., and Zarahemla in Lee county, I. T.,     opposite Nauvoo.\"  At the conference of the Church held in October, 1841, Almon W. Babbitt was disfellowshipped for persuading Saints who were emigrating to Nauvoo to remain and build up Kirtland, Ohio, as the minutes say, \"until such time as he shall make satisfaction.\" This shows how important this doctrine of gathering was. Therefore the great bulk of the Latter-day Saints, at the time of the martyrdom, were located at Nauvoo and its vicinity.  It is in order now to show that these Latter-day Saints sustained President Brigham Young and the Twelve.  On the 8th day of August, following the martyrdom, a special conference was held in Nauvoo at which time the claims of Sidney Rigdon and the rightful claim of the Twelve Apostles were presented for the vote of the Latter-day Saints. At this conference President Young, in addressing the Saints said:      \"I will ask you as quorums, Do you want Brother Rigdon to stand     forward as your leader, your guide, your spokesman? President     Rigdon wants me to bring up the other question first, and that is,     Does the Church want, and is it their only desire to sustain the     Twelve as the First Presidency of this people? * * * * All that are     in favor of this, in all the congregation of the Saints manifest     it by holding up the right hand. (There was a universal vote.) If     there are any of the contrary mind, every man and every woman who     does not want the Twelve to preside, lift up your hands in like     manner, (no hands up.) This supersedes the other question, and     trying it by quorums.\" (History of the Church, Aug. 8, 1844.)  Also at the general conference held the following October the Apostles were again unanimously sustained by the vote of the Church as the presiding quorum and Presidency of the Church. (Times and Seasons, 5:692). Mark you this was by the unanimous vote of the Saints.[2]  Now, in the exodus from Nauvoo these Saints--the great bulk of the Church, continued to be true and faithful and followed the Twelve Apostles.  Governor Thomas Ford, in his \"History of Illinois,\" states that in 1846 there were 16,000 Church members with the Twelve on the plains of Iowa, while the 1,000 that remained, a small remnant, were those who were unable to sell their property, or who having no property to sell, were unable to get away. (History of \"Reorganized\" Church iii:164). And this remnant followed as soon as they were able.  In the census report for 1850--three years after the settlement of Salt Lake valley, we learn that the population of Utah was 11,380, all Mormons. That same year the population of Pottawattomie county, Iowa, was 7,828, all Mormons, the Latter-day Saints at Kanesville. Thus we see that 19,208 members of the Church who had followed President Brigham Young in the exodus from Nauvoo, were located at these two places. And that is not all, there were other settlements of the Saints at Garden Grove, Mount Pisgah, St. Louis, and other places where temporary settlements for the Saints were formed during that exodus. These also later gathered to Utah. Thus we see that almost the entire membership of the Church as it stood in 1844, is accounted for in the following of President Brigham Young and the Twelve. That the Church was not threatened with dissolution the following statistics will show--I have not at hand the increase of membership of the Church during that period in the United States, but the increase in Great Britain is as follows: In the year 1844, the population of the Church in the British Isles was 7,797. Six years after the martyrdom--December, 1850--that membership had increased to 30,747. This does not show much of a dissolution or falling away.   WHO FORSOOK THE CHURCH?  I do not intend to convey the idea that there was not a falling away, an apostasy, at the time of the martyrdom and the exodus from Nauvoo, for there were many who forsook the cause, but compared with the Church membership, they were but few. Who were they? Did the faithful Saints forsake the Church at that time? Did those who risked their lives--who were shot with the Prophet and Patriarch forsake the Church? No! We do not find the faithful Latter-day Saints, who had the Gospel rooted in their hearts turning away. Then who were those who forsook the cause? I will tell you.  In the parable of the sower the Savior said:      \"Behold a sower went forth to sow; and when he sowed some seed fell     by the wayside, and the fowls came and devoured them up. Some fell     upon stony places where they had not much earth; and forthwith they     sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth; and when the sun     was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they     withered away.\"  In explaining this parable He said:      \"But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he     that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; yet hath he     not root in himself, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation     or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is     offended.\"  These were they who forsook the Church in the exodus from Nauvoo. Not the faithful who had been tried and proved and not found wanting, who had an abiding testimony of the truth. Now, let us see what Gen. Thomas L. Kane has to say on this subject. He visited Nauvoo about this time and also the camps of Israel. In the postscript to the second edition of his lecture on \"The Mormons\" he says, page 86:      \"The Mormons as I saw them, though a majority, were but a portion     of the Church as it flourished in Illinois. When the persecution     triumphed there, and no alternative remained for the steadfast in     the faith but the flight out of Egypt into the wilderness, as it     was"]]]
