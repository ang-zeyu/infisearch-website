Perhaps, when we take off, we should have a look at the youngsters' third planet on the way home.\"  \"But this trip has taken such a long time already, Father,\" my mother protested. \"Almost a _rff_; the young ones have missed nearly two semesters of school. And Qan has been getting some very peculiar ideas--from those _people_, I suppose.\"  \"But if there is some sort of intelligent life,\" Grandfather thought, \"it's our duty to visit it. Next time we need to stop the ship for repairs, it might be more convenient to put in at this third planet instead of just hanging out there in space. And the young ones say the natives seem to be friendly.\"  \"I'd like to see Sam's face when he comes back and finds his 'asteroid' gone,\" I conceptualized.  \"Yes,\" Ppon agreed, with the edge of his mind, but his main channel was turned in another direction. \"That is the end of this game now, you know. In the next game _I_ shall be leader.\"  \"Oh, yes?\" I thought back. \"I'm the leader and I'm staying leader, because I am the biggest and cleverest.\"  \"Children!\" my mother protested, distressed. \"I'm afraid you've picked up some really unpleasant concepts from those dreadful natives.\"  \"Come, come, Qana,\" Grandfather ideated, \"we mustn't be intolerant.\"  \"Perhaps not,\" she replied with heat, \"and I know the natives probably don't know any better, but I am not going to have my young one or anyone else's contaminated. Visit the third planet if you wish, but not this time. You'll have to make a special trip for it. I'm not going to let you stop off there while the young ones are aboard. It's obviously no fit place for children.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50884"],["title","Today is Forever (#1)"],["body","and I'm dropped from the marital lists for good.\"  \"Damn it, Boyle, I'm sorry,\" Locke said. \"I didn't mean to offend you.\"  The potential awkwardness of the moment was relieved by a soft chime from the annunciator. The apartment entrance dilated, admitting Moira.  She came to them directly, slender and poised and supremely confident of her dark young beauty, her ermine wrap and high-coiled hair glistening with stray raindrops that took the light like diamonds. The two men stood up to greet her, and Boyle could not miss the subtle feminine response of her to Locke's eager, athletic youth.  _If she's planning to fill my place in her marital-seven with this crewcut fool_, Boyle thought with sudden malice, _then she's in for a rude shock. And a final one._  \"I couldn't enjoy a line of the play for thinking of you two patriots plotting here in my apartment,\" Moira said. \"But then the performance was shatteringly dull, anyway.\"  Her boredom was less than convincing. When she had hung her wrap in a closet to be aerated and irradiated against its next wearing, she sat between Boyle and Locke with a little sigh of anticipation.  \"Have you decided yet what to do about this dreadful immortality scheme of the Councils, darlings?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Boyle went to the auto-dispenser in a corner and brought back three drinks, frosted and effervescing. They touched rims. Moira sipped at her glass quietly, waiting in tacit agreement with Locke for the older man's opinion.  \"This longevity should be available to the Social Body as well as to AL&O,\" Boyle said. \"It's obvious even to non-politicals like Locke and myself that, unless equal privilege is maintained, there's going to be the devil to pay and the Weal will suffer. It's equally obvious that the Alcorians' offer is made with the deliberate intent of undermining our system through dissension.\"  \"To their own profit, of course,\" Locke put in. \"Divide and conquer....\"  \"Whatever is to be done must be done quickly,\" Boyle said. \"It would take months to negotiate a definitive plebiscite, and in that time the Alcorians would have gone home again without treating anyone outside AL&O. And there the matter would rest. It seems to be up to us to get hold of the longevity process ourselves and to broadcast it to the public.\"  \"The good of the Body is the preservation of the Weal,\" Locke said sententiously. \"What do you think, Moira?\"  Moira touched her lips with a delicate pink tongue-tip, considering. To Boyle, her process of thought was as open as a plain-talk teletape; immortality for the Social Body automatically meant immortality for Moira and for David Locke. Both young, with an indefinite guarantee of life....  \"Yes,\" Moira said definitely. \"If some have it, then all should. But how, Philip?\"  \"You're both too young to remember this, of course,\" Boyle said, \"but until the 1980 Truth-check Act, there was a whole field of determinative action applicable to cases like this. It's a simple enough problem if we plan and execute it properly.\"  His confidence was not feigned; he had gone over the possibilities already with the swift ruthlessness that had made him head of Transplanet Enterprises, and the prospect of direct action excited rather than dismayed him. Until now he had skirted the edges of illegality with painstaking care, never stepping quite over the line beyond which he would be liable to the disastrous truth-check, but at this moment he felt himself invincible, above retaliation.  \"This present culture is a pragmatic compromise with necessity,\" Boyle said. \"It survives because it answers natural problems that couldn't be solved under the old systems. Nationalism died out, for example, when we set up a universal government, because everyone belonged to the same Social Body and had the same Weal to consider. Once we realized that the good of the Body is more important than personal privacy, the truth-check made ordinary crime and political machination obsolete. Racial antagonisms vanished under deliberate amalgamation. Monogamy gave way to the marital-seven, settling the problems of ego clash, incompatability, promiscuity and vice that existed before. It also settled the disproportion between the male and female population.  \"But stability is vulnerable. Since it never changes, it cannot stand against an attack either too new or too old for its immediate experience. So if we're going after this Alcorian longevity process, I'd suggest that we choose a method so long out of date that there's no longer a defense against it. _We'll take it by force!_\"         *       *       *       *       *  It amused him to see Moira and Locke accept his specious logic without reservation. Their directness was all but childlike. The thought of engaging personally in the sort of cloak-and-sword adventure carried over by the old twentieth-century melodrama tapes was, as he had surmised, irresistible to them.  \"I can see how you came to be head of Transplanet, Boyle,\" Locke said enviously. \"What's your plan, exactly?\"  \"I've a cottage in the mountains that will serve as a base of operations,\" Boyle explained. \"Moira can wait there for us in the morning while you and I take a 'copter to AL&O. According to your information, Cornelison and Bissell and Dorand will meet the Alcorians in the deliberations chamber at nine o'clock. We'll sleep-gas the lot of them, take the longevity process and go. There's no formal guard at Administration, or anywhere else, nowadays. There'll be no possible way of tracing us.\"  \"Unless we're truth-checked,\" Locke said doubtfully. \"If any one of us should be pulled in for serum-and-psycho, the whole affair will come out. The Board of Order--\"  \"Order won't know whom to suspect,\" Boyle said patiently. \"And they can't possibly check the whole city. They'd have no way of knowing even that it was someone from this locale. It could be anyone, from anywhere.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When Locke had gone and Moira had exhausted her fund of excited small talk, Boyle went over the entire plan again from inception to conclusion. Lying awake in the darkness with only the sound of Moira's even breathing breaking the stillness, he let his practical fancy run ahead.  Years, decades, generations--what were they? To be by relative standards undying in a world of ephemerae, with literally nothing that he might not have or do....  He dreamed a dream as old as man, of stretching today into forever.  Immortality.         *       *       *       *       *  The coup next morning was no more difficult, though bloodier, than Boyle had anticipated.  At nine sharp, he left David Locke at the controls of his helicar on the sun-bright roof landing of AL&O, took a self-service elevator down four floors and walked calmly to the deliberation chamber where Administrative Council met with the visitors from Alcor. He was armed for any eventuality with an electronic freeze-gun, a sleep-capsule of anesthetic gas, and a nut-sized incendiary bomb capable of setting afire an ordinary building.  His first hope of surprising the Council in conference was dashed in the antechamber, rendering his sleep-bomb useless. Dorand was a moment late; he came in almost on Boyle's heels, his face blank with astonishment at finding an intruder ahead of him.  The freeze-gun gave him no time for questions.  \"Quiet,\" Boyle ordered, and drove the startled Councilor ahead of him into the deliberations chamber.  He was just in time. Cornelison had one bony arm already bared for the longevity injection; Bissell sat in tense anticipation of his elder's reaction; the Alcorian, Fermiirig, stood at Cornelison's side with a glittering hypodermic needle in one of his four three-fingered hands.  For the moment, a sudden chill of apprehension touched Boyle. There should have been _two_ Alcorians.  \"Quiet,\" Boyle said again, this time to the group. \"You, Fermiirig, where is your mate?\"  The Alcorian replaced the hypodermic needle carefully in its case, his triangular face totally free of any identifiable emotion and clasped both primary and secondary sets of hands together as an Earthman might have raised them overhead. His eyes, doe-soft and gentle, considered Boyle thoughtfully.  \"Santikh is busy with other matters,\" Fermiirig said. His voice was thin and reedy, precise of enunciation, but hissing faintly on the aspirants. \"I am to join her later--\" his gentle eyes went to the Councilors, gauging the gravity of the situation from their tensity, and returned to Boyle--\"if I am permitted.\"  \"Good,\" Boyle said.  He snapped the serum case shut and tucked it under his arm, turning toward the open balcony windows. \"You're coming with me, Fermiirig. You others stay as you are.\"  The soft drone of a helicar descending outside told him that Locke had timed his descent accurately. Cornelison chose that moment to protest, his wrinkled face tight with consternation at what he read of Boyle's intention.  \"We know you, Boyle! You can't possibly escape. The Ordermen--\"  Boyle laughed at him.  \"There'll be no culprit for the Ordermen,\" he said, \"nor any witnesses. You've wiped out ordinary crime with your truth-checks and practicalities, Cornelison, but you've made the way easier for a man who knows what he wants.\"  He pressed the firing stud of his weapon. Cornelison fell and lay stiffly on the pastel tile. Bissell and Dorand went down as quickly, frozen to temporary rigidity.  Boyle tossed his incendiary into the huddle of still bodies and shoved the Alcorian forcibly through the windows into the hovering aircar.  Locke greeted the alien's appearance with stark amazement. \"My God, Boyle, are you _mad_? You can't kidnap--\"  The dull shock of explosion inside the deliberations chamber jarred the helicar, throwing the slighter Alcorian to the floor and staggering Boyle briefly.  \"Get us out of here,\" Boyle said sharply. He turned the freeze-gun on the astounded Locke, half expecting resistance and"]]]
