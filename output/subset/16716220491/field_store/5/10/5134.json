She was killed in a railway accident in 1933.\"  The small sound of the cabinet door closing brought Jack back to reality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. Against the gloom by the cabinet, Mrs. Kesserich's white face looked at him with what seemed a malicious eagerness.  \"Sit down,\" she said, \"and I'll tell you about it.\"  Without a thought as to why she hadn't asked him a single question--he was much too dazed for that--he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her position on the edge of the sofa.  \"You must understand, Mr. Barr, that Mary Alice Pope was the one love of Martin's life. He is a man of very deep and strong feelings, yet as you probably know, anything but kindly or demonstrative. Even when he first came here from Hungary with his older sisters Hani and Hilda, there was a cloak of loneliness about him--or rather about the three of them.  \"Hani and Hilda were athletic outdoor women, yet fiercely proud--I don't imagine they ever spoke to anyone in America except as to a servant--and with a seething distaste for all men except Martin. They showered all their devotion on him. So of course, though Martin didn't realize it, they were consumed with jealousy when he fell in love with Mary Alice Pope. They'd thought that since he'd reached forty without marrying, he was safe.  \"Mary Alice came from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say, inbred British stock. She was very young, but very sweet, and up to a point very wise. She sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings right away and did everything she could to win them over. For instance, though she was afraid of horses, she took up horseback riding, because that was Hani and Hilda's favorite pastime. Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her fear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But--and here is where Mary's wisdom fell short--her brave gesture did not pacify them: it only increased their hatred.  \"Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but his love. It was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as narrow and intense as his sisters hatred.\"         *       *       *       *       *  With a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him all this.  She went on, \"Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a home for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful future for them as well--not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by year, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos Aires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would teach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where he would occupy a chair at the university for a few months ... and so on. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. Martin had been away. His research was keeping him very busy--\"  Jack broke in with, \"Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive work on growth and fertilization?\"  Mrs. Kesserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gathering darkness. \"But now he was coming home, his work done. It was early evening, very chilly, but Hani and Hilda felt they had to ride down to the station to meet their brother. And although she dreaded it, Mary rode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering to the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from the saddle to welcome him home.  \"Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the station wagon had to be sent down for that.\" She looked defiantly at Jack. \"I drove the station wagon. I was Martin's laboratory assistant.\"  She paused. \"It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold line of sky to the west. Hani and Hilda, with Mary between them, were waiting on their horses at the top of the hill that led down to the station. The train had whistled and its headlight was graying the gravel of the crossing.  \"Suddenly Mary's horse squealed and plunged down the hill. Hani and Hilda followed--to try to catch her, they said, but they didn't manage that, only kept her horse from veering off. Mary never screamed, but as her horse reared on the tracks, I saw her face in the headlight's glare.  \"Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for he was out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. In fact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary--I mean, what had been Mary--and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms.\"  A door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich stiffened and was silent. Jack turned.  The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall--a seemingly young, sensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was a click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray hair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive mouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the youth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.  \"Hello, Barr,\" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.  The great biologist had come home.   III  \"Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called individualization in marine worms. Barr, have you ever thought much about the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival, Mrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew why and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their conversation to the professor.  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more important papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if it were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had suddenly posed this question about individuality.  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that make you you, and me me.\"  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose--this is just speculation--that we could control heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same individual at will.\"  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of hereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's parthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the mother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had grown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling secretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say nothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce with no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get exactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some special technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the mother's traits?\"  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate would be bound to develop differently.\"  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical twins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met by accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman. Each had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox terrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments similar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of them had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering, becoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's sphinx-like face.  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\" the biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the one who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels. \"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I won't have any time for it tomorrow.\"  Jack looked at him blankly.  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist explained.   IV  Morning sunlight brightened the colors of the wax flowers under glass on the high bureau that always seemed to emit the faint odor of old hair combings. Jack pulled back the diamond-patterned quilt and blinked the sleep from his eyes. He expected his mind to be busy wondering about Kesserich and his wife--things said and half said last night--but found instead that his thoughts swung instantly to Mary Alice Pope, as if to a farthest island in a world of people.  Downstairs, the house was empty. After a long look at the cabinet--he felt behind it, but the key was gone--he hurried down to the waterfront. He stopped only for a bowl of chowder and, as an afterthought, to buy half a dozen newspapers.  The sea was bright, the brisk wind just right for the _Annie O._ There was eagerness in the way it smacked the sail and in the creak of the mast. And when he reached the cove, it was no longer still, but nervous with faint ripples, as if time had finally begun to stir.  After the same struggle with the underbrush, he came out on the rocky spine and passed the cove of the sea urchins. The spiny creatures struck an uncomfortable chord in his memory.  This time he climbed the second island cautiously, scraping the innocent-seeming ground ahead of him intently with a boathook he'd brought along for the purpose. He was only a few yards from the fence when he saw Mary Alice Pope standing behind it.  He hadn't realized that his heart would begin to pound or that, at the same time, a shiver of almost supernatural dread would go through him.  The girl eyed him with an uneasy hostility and immediately began to speak in a hushed, hurried voice. \"You must go away at once and never come back. You're a wicked man, but I don't want you to be hurt. I've been watching for you all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50924"],["title","Sweet Tooth (#1)"],["body","road--a familiar road heralded by a familiar sign that said, SUGARDALE THREE MILES. Two slag deposits marked the spot where once Dexter's proud convertible had stood. He gazed at them sadly as they passed.         *       *       *       *       *  Suddenly Jeremiah brought the model A to a screeching halt. The two desecrators of the American Dream Incarnate were in the midst of another repast. The victim this time, judging from the still-visible star and the O.D. color scheme, was an army staff car. The grill and the motor were already gone, and half of the roof was missing. Yellow haze enshrouded the sorry scene, and the countryside was resounding to a series of horrendous CRUNCHES.  \"Do you think if I sort of zoomed by, we could make it?\" Jeremiah asked. \"I hate to go all the way around the other way.\"  \"I'm game if you are,\" Dexter said.  ZOOOOOOMMMMMMM!  The two monsters didn't even look up.  \"You'd think my model A wasn't good enough for them,\" Jeremiah said peevishly.  \"Count your blessings. Look, there's someone up ahead.\"  The \"someone\" turned out to be a two-star general, a chicken colonel and an enlisted man. Jeremiah stopped, and the trio climbed into the back seat. \"Ate your staff car, did they, General?\" he chuckled, taking off again. \"Well, that's the way it goes.\"  \"The name,\" said the general, whose middle-aged face had a greenish cast, \"is General Longcombe, and I was on my way to Sugardale to reconnoiter the situation before committing any troops to the area. This is my aide, Colonel Mortby, and my driver, Sergeant Wilkins.\"  \"Sheriff Smith at your service,\" said Jeremiah. \"This here's Dexter Foote, who came to Sugardale to do a Big Story on our falling star.\"  \"Tell me about these VEMs of yours, sheriff,\" General Longcombe said.  Jeremiah twisted around. \"VEMs?\"  \"'Vehicle-Eating Monsters',\" Colonel Mortby interposed. He was a small man with a pleasant youthful face. \"It's standard army operating procedure to give an object a name before investigating it.\"  \"Oh.\" Jeremiah twisted back again, saved the model A from going into the ditch with a Herculean yank on the wheel. \"Well, Dexter here seems to think that our falling star is a spaceship and that they landed in it, and I'm inclined to believe he's right.\"  \"After seeing the VEMs in person, I'm inclined to believe he's right myself,\" Colonel Mortby said. \"I think that what we have to do with here,\" he went on presently, when the general made no comment, \"is a form of metal-based life capable of generating an internal temperature of at least three thousand degrees Fahrenheit. The acrid odor they give off while 'feasting' probably arises from a substance analogous to our gastric juices which their heat-resistant stomachs supply to accomplish 'digestion,' only in this case 'digestion' consists primarily in melting down the metal they consume and in isolating its waste matter, after which the pure metal is reprocessed into 'body tissue' and the waste matter is thrown off in the form of slag. I think we might go so far as to call them a couple of animate open hearths.\"  Dexter had turned around in the front seat and was looking at the colonel admiringly. \"I think you've hit the nail right on the head, sir,\" he said.  General Longcombe was scowling. \"We're here to survey the situation, Colonel, not to jump to conclusions.\" He addressed the back of Jeremiah's weather-beaten neck. \"I trust we'll have no trouble finding suitable accommodations in Sugardale, sheriff.\"  \"Mrs. Creasy'll be glad to put you up at the Inn, if that's what you mean,\" Jeremiah said.         *       *       *       *       *  Mrs. Creasy was more than glad. Indeed, from the way she looked at the two officers and the NCO through her thicket of hair, you would have thought they were the first roomers she'd had in months, discounting the cockroaches, of course.  The general said petulantly, \"Let's get down to business, Colonel. I want an armored company brought up immediately, and I want the fallen-star area put off limits at once. Have the sheriff show you where it is.\" He turned to Sergeant Wilkins. \"Sergeant, get on the phone as soon as the colonel gets off it, and arrange for my personal Cadillac to be delivered here first thing.\"  After phoning his paper, Dexter headed for the dining room and sat down beside General Longcombe. \"Anything new on the VEMs, General?\" he asked.  General Longcombe sighed. There were shadows under his eyes, and his cheeks showed signs of sagging. \"They're still in circulation. Scared the wits out of a couple of teenagers and ate their hot-rod. We've got them under constant surveillance, of course, and what with all the underbrush they trample it's easy enough to track them. But we can't stop them. They eat our gas grenades and our fragmentation grenades, and they're impervious to our tank killers and our antitank mines. A small A-bomb would take care of them nicely, but even assuming there's an area around here large enough and isolated enough to permit us to use an A-bomb, there's no way of herding them into it.\"  \"It just so happens that there is such an area,\" Jeremiah Smith said. \"Tillson Valley--about ten miles south of here. You'd have to vacate Old Man Tillson, of course, but he'd be glad to go if you made it worth his while. He hasn't grown a thing but weeds anyway since he got his pension. Just sits around all day and sucks up beer.\"  \"But there's still no way of getting the VEMs out there,\" General Longcombe objected.  \"Tell me, general,\" Dexter said, \"have they eaten any of your jeeps or trucks or personnel carriers?\"  General Longcombe shook his head. \"They've had plenty of opportunity to, too.\"  \"I have a theory,\" Dexter said.  The look that promptly settled on General Longcombe's face made no bones about what he thought of presumptuous young reporters with theories. Colonel Mortby, however, was considerably less biased. \"It won't do any harm to listen to what he's got to say, sir,\" he pointed out, \"and it may even do some good. It'll be at least a day before the ship is excavated and even then we may not know any more about the sort of life forms we're dealing with than we do now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dexter needed no further invitation. \"I think it's pretty clear by now,\" he began, \"that our two visitors from Planet X aren't attracted by metal in just any old form at all, but by metal in the form of new, or nearly new, automobiles. This strongly suggests that their landing was unpremeditated, because if it had been premeditated they would have come down in a section of the country where such metallic concoctions are in plentiful supply--near a city or a large town, or close to a heavily traveled throughway.  \"But what is it about these new cars of ours that they find so irresistible? Let's try an analogy. Suppose that one of us has gone into a bakery to buy a birthday cake and that money is no object. Which cake is he most likely to buy? The answer is obvious: the one with the most visual appeal. To return to our visitors from Planet X. Suppose that all their lives they've been eating metal in various but uninspired ingot forms--the metallic equivalents, let's say, of beans and bread and hominy grits. Now suppose they find their way to another planet where visual appeal in metallic creation is a major occupation, and suppose that shortly after disembarking from their spaceship they come upon a new convertible. Wouldn't they react in the same way we would react if all our lives our diet had been confined to beans and bread and hominy grits and _we_ traveled to another planet, disembarked and came upon a delicious birthday cake just begging to be eaten? Wouldn't they make pigs of themselves and start looking for more cakes?\"  \"But if it's the ornate nature of our late-model cars that attracts them, why did they eat the staff car?\" Colonel Mortby asked. \"And why did they eat the teenager's hot rod, and our gas and fragmentation grenades?\"  \"I suggest,\" Dexter said, \"that they ate the staff car because at the moment there weren't any other cars immediately available. As for the teenager's hot rod, I imagine it was loaded down with enough chrome accessories to sink a battleship. And as for the grenades--your men threw them at them first, did they not?\"  Colonel Mortby nodded. \"I see what you mean. Sort of like throwing candy to a baby. I'll buy your theory, Mr. Foote.\"  \"And now, if I may,\" Dexter continued, \"I'd like to propose a means of getting rid of our unwanted visitors from Planet X.\"  General Longcombe sighed. \"Very well, Mr. Foote. Go on.\"  \"You mentioned earlier, sir, that there was no way of herding the VEMs into an isolated area. However, I think there is a way. Suppose we were to remove all of the automobiles from the vicinity with the exception of one, and suppose we were to park that one in the middle of Tillson Valley as bait, with a remote-controlled A-bomb underneath it?\"  \"But how would they know that the bait was there?\"  \"Through association,\" Dexter said. \"All of the automobiles they've consumed thus far were in operation shortly before they began to eat them, so by now they must have established an unconscious relationship between the sound of the motors and the taste of the metal. Therefore, if we keep the bait idling and set up a P.A. system to amplify the sound, eventually they'll hear it, their mouths will salivate and they'll come running.\"  General Longcombe offered no comment He appeared to be deep in thought.  \"My car is in West Virginia,\" Colonel Mortby said.  \"My car was eaten,\" Dexter said.  General Longcombe opened his mouth. \"My car--\" he began.  Sergeant Wilkins entered the room and saluted smartly. \"The general's Cadillac has just arrived, sir,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  Old man Tillson co-operated readily enough, once he was assured that he would be indemnified not only for his ramshackle house but for the young mountain of beer bottles that"]]]
