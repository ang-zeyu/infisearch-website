In a few moments the granite wall was bare. \"I still don't understand how you could be alive now,\" he said puzzled.  \"But I am. I don't see how you do that--\" she gestured at the chair and wall--\"But I'll accept the fact that you can. Why don't you accept the fact that I'm alive?\"  \"Don't get me wrong,\" the man said. \"I want company very much, especially female company. It's just--Turn your back.\"  She complied, with a questioning look. Quickly he destroyed the stubble on his face and created a clean pair of pressed pants and a shirt. Stepping out of his tattered uniform, he put on the new clothes, destroyed the rags, and, on an afterthought, created a comb and straightened his tangled brown hair.  \"All right,\" he said. \"You can turn back now.\"  \"Not bad,\" she smiled, looking him over. \"Let me use that comb--and would you please make me a dress? Size twelve, but see that the weight goes in the right places.\"         *       *       *       *       *  On the third attempt he had the thing right--he had never realized how deceptive the shapes of women could be--and then he made a pair of gold sandals with high heels for her.  \"A little tight,\" she said, putting them on, \"and not too practical without sidewalks. But thanks much. This trick of yours really solves the Christmas present problem, doesn't it?\" Her dark hair was shiny in the noon sun, and she looked very lovely and warm and human.  \"See if _you_ can create,\" he urged, anxious to share his startling new ability with her.  \"I've already tried,\" she said. \"No go. Still a man's world.\"  He frowned. \"How can I be absolutely sure you're real?\"  \"That again? Do you remember creating me, Master?\" she asked mockingly, bending to loosen the strap on one shoe.  \"I had been thinking--about women,\" he said grimly. \"I might have created you while I was asleep. Why shouldn't my subconscious mind have as much power as my conscious mind? I would have equipped you with a memory, given you a background. You would have been extremely plausible. And if my subconscious mind _did_ create you, then it would make certain that my conscious mind would never know.\"  \"You're ridiculous!\"  \"Because if my conscious mind knew,\" he went on relentlessly, \"it would reject your existence. Your entire function, as a creation of my subconscious, would be to keep me from knowing. To prove, by any means in your power, by any logic, that you were--\"  \"Let's see you make a woman, then, if your mind is so good!\" She crossed her arms and leaned back in the chair, giving a single sharp nod.  \"All right.\" He stared at the cave wall and a woman started to appear. It took shape sloppily, one arm too short, legs too long. Concentrating harder, he was able to make its proportions fairly true. But its eyes were set at an odd angle; its shoulders and back were sloped and twisted. He had created a shell without brains or internal organs, an automaton. He commanded it to speak, but only gulps came from the shapeless mouth; he hadn't given it any vocal apparatus. Shuddering, he destroyed the nightmare figure.  \"I'm not a sculptor,\" he said. \"Nor am I God.\"  \"I'm glad you finally realize that.\"  \"That still doesn't prove,\" he continued stubbornly, \"that _you're_ real. I don't know what my subconscious mind is capable of.\"  \"Make something for me,\" she said abruptly. \"I'm tired of listening to this nonsense.\"  _I've hurt her feelings_, he thought. _The only other human on Earth and I've hurt her._ He nodded, took her by the hand and led her out of the cave. On the flat plain below he created a city. He had experimented with it a few days back, and it was much easier this time. Patterned after pictures and childhood dreams of the Thousand and One Nights, it towered black and white and rose. The walls were gleaming ruby, and the gates were of silver-stained ebony. The towers were red gold, and sapphires glittered in them. A great staircase of milky ivory climbed to the highest opal spire, set with thousands of steps of veined marble. There were lagoons of blue water, and little birds fluttered above them, and silver and gold fish darted through the still depths.  They walked through the city, and he created roses for her, white and yellow and red, and gardens of strange blossoms. Between two domed and spired buildings he created a vast pool of water; on it he put a purple-canopied pleasure barge, loading it with every kind of food and drink he could remember.         *       *       *       *       *  They floated across the lagoon, fanned by the soft breeze he had created.  \"And all this is false,\" he reminded her after a little while.  She smiled. \"No it's not. You can touch it. It's real.\"  \"Will it be here after I die?\"  \"Who cares? Besides, if you can do all this, you can cure any sickness. Perhaps you can even cure old age and death.\" She plucked a blossom from an over-hanging bough and sniffed its fragrance. \"You could keep this from fading and dying. You could probably do the same for us, so where's the problem?\"  \"Would you like to go away?\" he said, puffing on a newly created cigarette. \"Would you like to find a new planet, untouched by war? Would you like to start over?\"  \"Start over? You mean.... Later perhaps. Now I don't even want to go near the ship. It reminds me of the war.\"  They floated on a little way.  \"Are you sure now that I'm real?\" she asked.  \"If you want me to be honest, no,\" he replied. \"But I want very much to believe it.\"  \"Then listen to me,\" she said, leaning toward him. \"I'm real.\" She slipped her arms around his neck. \"I've always been real. I always will be real. You want proof? Well, I know I'm real. So do you. What more can you ask?\"  He stared at her for a long moment, felt her warm arms around his neck, listened to her breathing. He could smell the fragrance of her skin and hair, the unique essence of an individual.  Slowly he said, \"I believe you. I love you. What--what is your name?\"  She thought for a moment. \"Joan.\"  \"Strange,\" he said. \"I always dreamed of a girl named Joan. What's your last name?\"  She kissed him.  Overhead, the swallows he had created--_his_ swallows--wheeled in wide circles above the lagoon, his fish darted aimlessly to and fro, and his city stretched, proud and beautiful, to the edge of the twisted lava mountains.  \"You didn't tell me your last name,\" he said.  \"Oh, that. A girl's maiden name never matters--she always takes her husband's.\"  \"That's an evasion!\"  She smiled. \"It is, isn't it?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50847"],["title","Tea Tray in the Sky (#1)"],["body","so sad.\"  \"Sirians are always sad,\" the salesman told him. \"Listen.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Michael strained his ears past the racket of the advideo. Sure enough, he could make out words: \"Our wings were unfurled in a far distant world, our bodies are pain-racked, delirious. And never, it seems, will we see, save in dreams, the bright purple swamps of our Sirius....\"  Carpenter brushed away a tear. \"Poignant, isn't it?\"  \"Very, very touching,\" Michael agreed. \"Are they sick or something?\"  \"Oh, no; they wouldn't have been permitted on the bus if they were. They're just homesick. Sirians love being homesick. That's why they leave Sirius in such great numbers.\"  \"Fasten your suction disks, please,\" the stewardess, a pretty two-headed Denebian, ordered as she walked up and down the gangway. \"We're coming into Portyork. I have an announcement to make to all passengers on behalf of the United Universe. Zosma was admitted into the Union early this morning.\"  All the passengers cheered.  \"Since it is considered immodest on Zosma,\" she continued, \"ever to appear with the heads bare, henceforward it will be tabu to be seen in public without some sort of head-covering.\"  Wild scrabbling sounds indicated that all the passengers were searching their packs for headgear. Michael unearthed a violet cap.  The salesmen unfolded what looked like a medieval opera hat in piercingly bright green.  \"Always got to keep on your toes,\" he whispered to the younger man. \"The Universe is expanding every minute.\"  The bus settled softly on the landing field and the passengers flew, floated, crawled, undulated, or walked out. Michael looked around him curiously. The Lodge had contained no extraterrestrials, for such of those as sought seclusion had Brotherhoods on their own planets.  Of course, even in Angeles he had seen other-worlders--humanoids from Vega, scaly Electrans, the wispy ubiquitous Sirians--but nothing to compare with the crowds that surged here. Scarlet Meropians rubbed tentacles with bulging-eyed Talithans; lumpish gray Jovians plodded alongside graceful, spidery Nunkians. And there were countless others whom he had seen pictured in books, but never before in reality.  The gaily colored costumes and bodies of these beings rendered kaleidoscopic a field already brilliant with red-and-green lights and banners. The effect was enhanced by Mr. Carpenter, whose emerald-green cloak was drawn back to reveal a chartreuse tunic and olive-green breeches which had apparently been designed for a taller and somewhat less pudgy man.         *       *       *       *       *  Carpenter rubbed modestly gloved hands together. \"I have no immediate business, so supposing I start showing you the sights. What would you like to see first, Mr. Frey? Or would you prefer a nice, restful movid?\"  \"Frankly,\" Michael admitted, \"the first thing I'd like to do is get myself something to eat. I didn't have any breakfast and I'm famished.\" Two small creatures standing close to him giggled nervously and scuttled off on six legs apiece.  \"Shh, not so loud! There are females present.\" Carpenter drew the youth to a secluded corner. \"Don't you know that on Theemim it's frightfully vulgar to as much as speak of eating in public?\"  \"But why?\" Michael demanded in too loud a voice. \"What's wrong with eating in public here on Earth?\"  Carpenter clapped a hand over the young man's mouth. \"Hush,\" he cautioned. \"After all, on Earth there are things we don't do or even mention in public, aren't there?\"  \"Well, yes. But those are different.\"  \"Not at all. Those rules might seem just as ridiculous to a Theemimian. But the Theemimians have accepted our customs just as we have accepted the Theemimians'. How would you like it if a Theemimian violated one of our tabus in public? You must consider the feelings of the Theemimians as equal to your own. Observe the golden rule: 'Do unto extraterrestrials as you would be done by.'\"  \"But I'm still hungry,\" Michael persisted, modulating his voice, however, to a decent whisper. \"Do the proprieties demand that I starve to death, or can I get something to eat somewhere?\"  \"Naturally,\" the salesman whispered back. \"Portyork provides for all bodily needs. Numerous feeding stations are conveniently located throughout the port, and there must be some on the field.\"  After gazing furtively over his shoulder to see that no females were watching, Carpenter approached a large map of the landing field and pressed a button. A tiny red light winked demurely for an instant.  \"That's the nearest one,\" Carpenter explained.         *       *       *       *       *  Inside a small, white, functional-looking building unobtrusively marked \"Feeding Station,\" Carpenter showed Michael where to insert a two-credit piece in a slot. A door slid back and admitted Michael into a tiny, austere room, furnished only with a table, a chair, a food compartment, and an advideo. The food consisted of tabloid synthetics and was tasteless. Michael knew that only primitive creatures waste time and energy in growing and preparing natural foods. It was all a matter of getting used to this stuff, he thought glumly, as he tried to chew food that was meant to be gulped.  A ferret-eyed Yeddan appeared on the advideo. \"Do you suffer from gastric disorders? Does your viscera get in your hair? A horrid condition, but swift abolition is yours with Al-Brom from Altair.\"  Michael finished his meal in fifteen minutes and left the compartment to find Carpenter awaiting him in the lobby, impatiently glancing at the luminous time dial embedded in his wrist.  \"Let's go to the Old Town,\" he suggested to Michael. \"It will be of great interest to a student and a newcomer like yourself.\"  A few yards away from the feeding station, the travel agents were lined up in rows, each outside his spaceship, each shouting the advantages of the tour he offered:  \"Better than a mustard plaster is a weekend spent on Castor.\"  \"If you want to show you like her, take her for a week to Spica.\"  \"Movid stars go to Mars.\"  Carpenter smiled politely at them. \"No space trips for us today, gentlemen. We're staying on Terra.\" He guided the bewildered young man through the crowds and to the gates of the field. Outside, a number of surface vehicles were lined up, with the drivers loudly competing for business.  \"Come, take a ride in my rocket car, suited to both gent and lady, lined with luxury _hukka_ fur brought from afar, and perfumed with rare scents from Algedi.\"  \"Whichever movid film you choose to view will be yours in my fine cab from Mizar. Just press a button--it won't cost you nuttin'--see a passionate drama of long-vanished Mu or the bloodhounds pursuing Eliza.\"  \"All honor be laid at the feet of free trade, but, whatever your race or your birth, each passenger curls up with two dancing girls who rides in the taxi from Earth.\"  \"Couldn't we--couldn't we walk? At least part of the way?\" Michael faltered.  Carpenter stared. \"Walk! Don't you know it's forbidden to walk more than two hundred yards in any one direction? Fomalhautians never walk.\"  \"But they have no feet.\"  \"That has nothing whatsoever to do with it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Carpenter gently urged the young man into the Algedian cab ... which reeked. Michael held his nose, but his mentor shook his head. \"No, no! Tpiu Number Five is the most esteemed aroma on Algedi. It would break the driver's heart if he thought you didn't like it. You wouldn't want to be had up for ego injury, would you?\"  \"Of course not,\" Michael whispered weakly.  \"Brunettes are darker and blondes are fairer,\" the advideo informed him, \"when they wash out their hair with shampoos made on Chara.\"  After a time, Michael got more or less used to Tpiu Number Five and was able to take some interest in the passing landscape. Portyork, the biggest spaceport in the United Universe, was, of course, the most cosmopolitan city--cosmopolitan in its architecture as well as its inhabitants. Silver domes of Earth were crowded next to the tall helical edifices of the Venusians.  \"You'll notice that the current medieval revival has even reached architecture,\" Carpenter pointed out. \"See those period houses in the Frank Lloyd Wright and Inigo Jones manner?\"  \"Very quaint,\" Michael commented.  Great floating red and green balls lit the streets, even though it was still daylight, and long scarlet-and-emerald streamers whipped out from the most unlikely places. As Michael opened his mouth to inquire about this, \"We now interrupt the commercials,\" the advideo said, \"to bring you a brand new version of one of the medieval ballads that are becoming so popular....\"  \"I shall scream,\" stated Carpenter, \"if they play _Beautiful Blue Deneb_ just once more.... No, thank the Wise Ones, I've never heard this before.\"  \"Thuban, Thuban, I've been thinking,\" sang a buxom Betelgeusian, \"what a Cosmos this could be, if land masses were transported to replace the wasteful sea.\"  \"I guess the first thing for me to do,\" Michael began in a businesslike manner, \"is to get myself a room at a hotel.... What have I said now?\"  \"The word _hotel_,\" Carpenter explained through pursed lips, \"is not used in polite society any more. It has come to have unpleasant connotations. It means--a place of dancing girls. I hardly think....\"  \"Certainly not,\" Michael agreed austerely. \"I merely want a lodging.\"  \"That word is also--well, you see,\" Carpenter told him, \"on Zaniah it is unthinkable to go anywhere without one's family.\"  \"They're a sort of ant, aren't they? The Zaniahans, I mean.\"  \"More like bees. So those creatures who travel--\" Carpenter lowered his voice modestly \"--_alone_ hire a family for the duration of their stay. There are a number of families available, but the better types come rather high. There has been talk of reviving the old-fashioned price controls, but the Wise Ones say this would limit free enterprise as much as--if you'll excuse my use of the"]]]
