The great historical figures are made the larger than life-size that we know them. The great literary creations assume reality.\"  I thought of Cleopatra and Helen of Troy and wondered if they would be the goddesses of love that people imagined or the scrawny, big-nosed redhead and fading old woman of scholarship. Then I noticed the detective's hand that had been resting idly on a round brass weight of unknown sort to me. His tapered fingertips had indented the metal.  His bright eyes followed mine and he smiled faintly. \"Withdrawal symptoms.\"  The admiration and affection for this man that had been slowly building up behind my hatred unbrinked. I remembered now that he had stopped. He was not _really_ a snowbird.  After a time, I asked the doctor a question.  \"Why, yes. I'm flattered. This is the first manuscript. Considering my professional handwriting, I recopied it more laboriously.\"  Accepting the sheaf of papers and not looking back at these two great and good men, I concentrated on my own time and Doc. Nothing happened. My heart raced, but I saw something dancing before me like a dust mote in sunlight and stepped toward it....  ... into the effective range of Miss Casey's tiny gun.         *       *       *       *       *  She inclined the lethal silver toy. \"Let me see those papers, Kevin.\"  I handed her the doctor's manuscript.  Her breath escaped slowly and loudly. \"It's all right. It's all right. It exists. It's real. Not even one of the unwritten ones. I've read this myself.\"  Doc was lying on the cot, half his face twisted into horror.  \"Don't move, Kevin,\" she said. \"I'll have to shoot you--maybe not to kill, but painfully.\"  I watched her face flash blue, red, blue and knew she meant it. But I had known too much in too short a time. I had to help Doc, but there was something else.  \"I just want a drink of coffee from that container on the chair,\" I told her.  She shook her head. \"I don't know what you think it does to you.\"  It was getting hard for me to think. \"Who are you?\"  She showed me a card from her wrist purse. Vivian Casey, Constable, North American Mounted Police.  I had to help Doc. I had to have some coffee. \"What do you want?\"  \"Listen, Kevin. Listen carefully to what I am saying. Doc found a method of time travel. It was almost a purely mathematical, topographical way divorced from modern physical sciences. He kept it secret and he wanted to make money with it. He was an idealist--he had his crusades. How can you make money with time travel?\"  I didn't know whether she was asking me, but I didn't know. All I knew was that I had to help Doc and get some coffee.  \"It takes money--money Doc didn't have--to make money,\" Miss Casey said, \"even if you know what horse will come in and what stock will prosper. Besides, horse-racing and the stock market weren't a part of Doc's character. He was a scholar.\"  Why did she keep using the past tense in reference to Doc? It scared me. He was lying so still with the left side of his face so twisted. I needed some coffee.  \"He became a book finder. He got rare editions of books and magazines for his clients in absolutely mint condition. That was all right--until he started obtaining books that _did not exist_.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I didn't know what all that was supposed to mean. I got to the chair, snatched up the coffee container, tore it open and gulped down the soothing liquid.  I turned toward her and threw the rest of the coffee into her face.  The coffee splashed out over her platinum hair and powder-blue dress that looked white when the neon was azure, purple when it was amber. The coffee stained and soiled and ruined, and I was fiercely glad, unreasonably happy.  I tore the gun away from her by the short barrel, not letting my filthy hands touch her scrubbed pink ones.  I pointed the gun generally at her and backed around the _thing_ on the floor to the cot. Doc had a pulse, but it was irregular. I checked for a fever and there wasn't one. After that, I didn't know what to do.  I looked up finally and saw a Martian in or about the doorway.  \"Call me Andre,\" the Martian said. \"A common name but foreign. It should serve as a point of reference.\"  I had always wondered how a thing like a Martian could talk. Sometimes I wondered if they really could.  \"You won't need the gun,\" Andre said conversationally.  \"I'll keep it, thanks. What do _you_ want?\"  \"I'll begin as Miss Casey did--by telling you things. Hundreds of people disappeared from North America a few months ago.\"  \"They always do,\" I told him.  \"They ceased to exist--as human beings--shortly after they received a book from Doc,\" the Martian said.  Something seemed to strike me in the back of the neck. I staggered, but managed to hold onto the gun and stand up.  \"Use one of those sneaky Martian weapons again,\" I warned him, \"and I'll kill the girl.\" Martians were supposed to be against the destruction of any life-form, I had read someplace. I doubted it, but it was worth a try.  \"Kevin,\" Andre said, \"why don't you take a bath?\"  The Martian weapon staggered me again. I tried to say something. I tried to explain that I was so dirty that I could never get clean no matter how often I bathed. No words formed.  \"But, Kevin,\" Andre said, \"you aren't _that_ dirty.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The blow shook the gun from my fingers. It almost fell into the _thing_ on the floor, but at the last moment seemed to change direction and miss it.  I knew something. \"I don't wash because I drink coffee.\"  \"It's all right to drink coffee, isn't it?\" he asked.  \"Of course,\" I said, and added absurdly, \"That's why I don't wash.\"  \"You mean,\" Andre said slowly, ploddingly, \"that if you bathed, you would be admitting that drinking coffee was in the same class as any other solitary vice that makes people wash frequently.\"  I was knocked to my knees.  \"Kevin,\" the Martian said, \"drinking coffee represents a major vice only in Centurian humanoids, not Earth-norm human beings. _Which are you?_\"  Nothing came out of my gabbling mouth.  \"_What is Doc's full name?_\"  I almost fell in, but at the last instant I caught myself and said, \"Doctor Kevin O'Malley, Senior.\"  From the bed, Doc said a word. \"Son.\"  Then he disappeared.  I looked at that which he had made. I wondered where he had gone, in search of what.  \"He didn't use that,\" Andre said.  So I was an Earthman, Doc's son. So my addiction to coffee was all in my mind. That didn't change anything. They say sex is all in your mind. I didn't want to be cured. I wouldn't be. Doc was gone. That was all I had now. That and the _thing_ he left.  \"The rest is simple,\" Andre said. \"Doc O'Malley bought up all the stock in a certain ancient metaphysical order and started supplying members with certain books. Can you imagine the effect of the _Book of Dyzan_ or the _Book of Thoth_ or the _Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan_ or the _Necronomican_ itself on human beings?\"  \"But they don't exist,\" I said wearily.  \"Exactly, Kevin, exactly. They have never existed any more than your Victorian detective friend. But the unconscious racial mind has reached back into time and created them. And that unconscious mind, deeper than psychology terms the subconscious, has always known about the powers of ESP, telepathy, telekinesis, precognition. Through these books, the human race can tell itself how to achieve a state of pure logic, without food, without sex, without conflict--just as Doc has achieved such a state--a little late, true. He had a powerful guilt complex, even stronger than your withdrawal, over releasing this blessing on the inhabited universe, but reason finally prevailed. He had reached a state of pure thought.\"  \"The North American government _has_ to have this secret, Kevin,\" the girl said. \"You can't let it fall into the hands of the Martians.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Andre did not deny that he wanted it to fall into his hands.  I knew I could not let Doc's--Dad's--time travel _thing_ fall into anyone's hands. I remembered that all the copies of the books had disappeared with their readers now. There must not be any more, I knew.  Miss Casey did her duty and tried to stop me with a judo hold, but I don't think her heart was in it, because I reversed and broke it.  I kicked the _thing_ to pieces and stomped on the pieces. Maybe you can't stop the progress of science, but I knew it might be millenniums before Doc's genes and creative environment were recreated and time travel was rediscovered. Maybe we would be ready for it then. I knew we weren't now.  Miss Casey leaned against my dirty chest and cried into it. I didn't mind her touching me.  \"I'm glad,\" she said.  Andre flowed out of the doorway with a sigh. Of relief?  I would never know. I supposed I had destroyed _it_ because I didn't want the human race to become a thing of pure reason without purpose, direction or love, but I would never know for sure. I thought I could kick the habit--perhaps with Miss Casey's help--but I wasn't really confident.  Maybe I had destroyed the time machine because a world without material needs would not grow and roast coffee."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51310"],["title","My Lady Greensleeves (#1)"],["body","ady--she's going to like it here, because there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her company.\" He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O guards.  The outside guard said sourly: \"A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary knows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others all riled up.\"  \"Let them in,\" the inside guard told him. \"The others are riled up already.\"  Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no attention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the tanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block corridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you could ignore the prisoners--they simply could not move fast enough, against the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a rule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all the time--only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's restraining garment removed.  Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate--and fell flat on her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It was like walking through molasses.  The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. \"Take it easy, auntie. Come on, get in your cell.\" He steered her in the right direction and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot. \"Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules say you got to wear it and the rules--Hey. She's crying!\" He shook his head, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry in the Greensleeves.  However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from tears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she passed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge to retch.         *       *       *       *       *  Sauer and Flock were what are called prison wolves. They were laborers--\"wipes,\" for short--or, at any rate, they had been once. They had spent so much time in prisons that it was sometimes hard even for them to remember what they really were, outside. Sauer was a big, grinning redhead with eyes like a water moccasin. Flock was a lithe five-footer with the build of a water moccasin--and the sad, stupid eyes of a calf.  Sauer stopped yelling for a moment. \"Hey, Flock!\"  \"What do you want, Sauer?\" called Flock from his own cell.  \"We got a lady with us! Maybe we ought to cut out this yelling so as not to disturb the lady!\" He screeched with howling, maniacal laughter. \"Anyway, if we don't cut this out, they'll get us in trouble, Flock!\"  \"Oh, you think so?\" shrieked Flock. \"Jeez, I wish you hadn't said that, Sauer. You got me scared! I'm so scared, I'm gonna have to yell!\"  The howling started all over again.  The inside guard finished putting the new prisoners away and turned off the tangler field once more. He licked his lips. \"Say, you want to take a turn in here for a while?\"  \"Uh-uh.\" The outside guard shook his head.  \"You're yellow,\" the inside guard said moodily. \"Ah, I don't know why I don't quit this lousy job. Hey, you! Pipe down or I'll come in and beat your head off!\"  \"Ee-ee-ee!\" screamed Sauer in a shrill falsetto. \"I'm scared!\" Then he grinned at the guard, all but his water-moccasin eyes. \"Don't you know you can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head, Boss?\"  \"Shut _up_!\" yelled the inside guard.  Sue-Ann Bradley's weeping now was genuine. She simply could not help it. The crazy yowling of the hard-timers, Sauer and Flock, was getting under her skin. They weren't even--even _human_, she told herself miserably, trying to weep silently so as not to give the guards the satisfaction of hearing her--they were animals!  Resentment and anger, she could understand. She told herself doggedly that resentment and anger were natural and right. They were perfectly normal expressions of the freedom-loving citizen's rebellion against the vile and stifling system of Categoried Classes. It was _good_ that Sauer and Flock still had enough spirit to struggle against the vicious system--  But did they have to scream so?  The senseless yelling was driving her crazy. She abandoned herself to weeping and she didn't even care who heard her any more. Senseless!  It never occurred to Sue-Ann Bradley that it might not be senseless, because noise hides noise. But then she hadn't been a prisoner very long.   III  \"I smell trouble,\" said O'Leary to the warden.  \"Trouble? Trouble?\" Warden Schluckebier clutched his throat and his little round eyes looked terrified--as perhaps they should have. Warden Godfrey Schluckebier was the almighty Caesar of ten thousand inmates in the Jug, but privately he was a fussy old man trying to hold onto the last decent job he would have in his life.  \"Trouble? _What_ trouble?\"  O'Leary shrugged. \"Different things. You know Lafon, from Block A? This afternoon, he was playing ball with the laundry orderlies in the yard.\"  The warden, faintly relieved, faintly annoyed, scolded: \"O'Leary, what did you want to worry me for? There's nothing wrong with playing ball in the yard. That's what recreation periods are for.\"  \"You don't see what I mean, Warden. Lafon was a professional on the outside--an architect. Those laundry cons were laborers. Pros and wipes don't mix; it isn't natural. And there are other things.\"  O'Leary hesitated, frowning. How could you explain to the warden that it didn't _smell_ right?  \"For instance--Well, there's Aunt Mathias in the women's block. She's a pretty good old girl--that's why she's the block orderly. She's a lifer, she's got no place to go, she gets along with the other women. But today she put a woman named Bradley on report. Why? Because she told Bradley to mop up in wipe talk and Bradley didn't understand. Now Mathias wouldn't--\"  The warden raised his hand. \"Please, O'Leary, don't bother me about that kind of stuff.\" He sighed heavily and rubbed his eyes. He poured himself a cup of steaming black coffee from a brewpot, reached in a desk drawer for something, hesitated, glanced at O'Leary, then dropped a pale blue tablet into the cup. He drank it down eagerly, ignoring the scalding heat.  He leaned back, looking suddenly happier and much more assured.  \"O'Leary, you're a guard captain, right? And I'm your warden. You have your job, keeping the inmates in line, and I have mine. Now your job is just as important as my job,\" he said piously. \"_Everybody's_ job is just as important as everybody else's, right? But we have to stick to our own jobs. We don't want to try to _pass_.\"  O'Leary snapped erect, abruptly angry. Pass! What the devil way was that for the warden to talk to him?  \"Excuse the expression, O'Leary,\" the warden said anxiously. \"I mean, after all, 'Specialization is the goal of civilization,' right?\" He was a great man for platitudes, was Warden Schluckebier. \"_You_ know you don't want to worry about _my_ end of running the prison. And _I_ don't want to worry about _yours_. You see?\" And he folded his hands and smiled like a civil-service Buddha.         *       *       *       *       *  O'Leary choked back his temper. \"Warden, I'm telling you that there's trouble coming up. I smell the signs.\"  \"Handle it, then!\" snapped the warden, irritated at last.  \"But suppose it's too big to handle. Suppose--\"  \"It isn't,\" the warden said positively. \"Don't borrow trouble with all your supposing, O'Leary.\" He sipped the remains of his coffee, made a wry face, poured a fresh cup and, with an elaborate show of not noticing what he was doing, dropped three of the pale blue tablets into it this time.  He sat beaming into space, waiting for the jolt to take effect.  \"Well, then,\" he said at last. \"You just remember what I've told you tonight, O'Leary, and we'll get along fine. 'Specialization is the--' Oh, curse the thing.\"  His phone was ringing. The warden picked it up irritably.  That was the trouble with those pale blue tablets, thought O'Leary; they gave you a lift, but they put you on edge.  \"Hello,\" barked the warden, not even glancing at the viewscreen. \"What the devil do you want? Don't you know I'm--What? You did _what_? You're going to WHAT?\"  He looked at the viewscreen at last with a look of pure horror. Whatever he saw on it, it did not reassure him. His eyes opened like clamshells in a steamer.  \"O'Leary,\" he said faintly, \"my mistake.\"  And he hung up--more or less by accident; the handset dropped from his fingers.  The person on the other end of the phone was calling from Cell Block O.  Five minutes before, he hadn't been anywhere near the phone and it didn't look as if his chances of ever getting near it were very good. Because five minutes before, he was in his cell, with the rest of the hard-timers of the Greensleeves.  His name was Flock.  He was still yelling. Sue-Ann Bradley, in the cell across from him, thought that maybe, after all, the man was really in pain. Maybe the crazy screams were screams of agony, because certainly his face was the face of an agonized man.  The outside guard bellowed: \"Okay, okay. Take ten!\"  Sue-Ann froze, waiting to see what would happen. What actually did happen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch that actuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells. The prison rules were humanitarian, even for the dregs that inhabited the Greensleeves. Ten minutes out of every two hours, even the worst case had to be allowed to take his hands out of the restraining garment.  \"Rest period\" it was called--in the rule book. The inmates had a less lovely term for it.         *       *       *       *       *  At the guard's yell, the inmates jumped to their feet.  Bradley was a little slow getting off the edge of the steel-slat bed--nobody had warned her that the eddy currents in the tangler fields had a way of making metal smoke-hot. She gasped but didn't cry out. Score one more painful lesson in her new language course. She rubbed the backs of her thighs gingerly--and slowly, slowly,"]]]
