I’m quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last night already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I didn’t let you know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer! There’s no basis for any of the accusations you’re making; nobody’s ever said a word to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven’t read the latest contracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don’t need to wait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!”  And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed—where he now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could rest. If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.  “Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his parents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”. “Oh, God!” called his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill and we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!” she then cried. “Mother?” his sister called from the other side. They communicated across Gregor’s room. “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just now?” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!” his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, “get a locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something awful has happened.  Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound. They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening.  Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he, then, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk in the next room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried, “keep at it, keep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need the locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.  Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”, which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him—he was the nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. Gregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room. Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.  So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its façade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.  “Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and set off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he said to the chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t earn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you report everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to remember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation, but I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any harder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at the office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That’s just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss himself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And you’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52009"],["title","New Lamps (#1)"],["body","ture? Come on in. I'll buy you a drink. You'll love this place. They've even got a waiter who thinks he can speak English.\"  \"Thanks,\" Ronson said. \"I'll take you up on that.\" He was astonished and bewildered by this woman. He had spent most of his life in the laboratories of Earth. The women who had been there had been flat-breasted, pale creatures in low-heeled shoes who had called him \"Sir,\" and \"Doctor,\" and who had obviously been greatly in awe of him but who had apparently never had a red-blooded thought in their lives. He had regarded them as a sort of neuter sex, creatures who had obviously been intended by nature to be female but who had gotten their hormones mixed up somewhere along the line. This girl was different.  Her name, somehow, had a haunting familiarity, as if he had heard it somewhere before. But he couldn't remember where.  She went through the door ahead of him. As Ronson passed through, a Martian thrust his head around the corner outside and threw a knife. The steel blade buried in the door facing within six inches of the human's head. He hastily ducked through the door.  Looking annoyed, the girl started back to the street outside. \"I'll fix him,\" she said, pulling the needle gun.  Ronson caught her shoulder. \"Let well enough alone,\" he said firmly. \"Anyhow you were going to buy me a drink.\"  Her eyes held a curious mixture of annoyance, defiance, and longing. Her gaze went down to his hand on her shoulder. Ronson grinned at her. \"You look as if you are about to bite me,\" he said. \"Go ahead, if you want to.\" He did not move his hand.  Wonder came into her face. \"A great many men have tried to paw me, without getting very far. But somehow, I don't think you're trying to do that.\"  \"About that drink?\" Ronson said.  \"Sure.\" She moved toward a table set against the far wall.  Ronson dared to breathe again. Whatever else this girl was, she was certainly full of fight and fury. She could have gone out into the street, in the face of thrown knives, if he hadn't stopped her. As she moved toward the table, he had a chance to look at the place in which he found himself.  What he saw was not reassuring. Except for a big circle in the center of the room, the place was crammed with Martian males of all sizes and descriptions. Waiters scurried through the crowd. The circle on the floor was outlined in red. No customer and no Martian ventured within it. Ronson glanced at it, asked the girl a question.  \"I just got here too,\" she said. \"I haven't had time to find out about it. Some superstition of theirs, I think.\" She led him to the table. Two glasses were already on it. A waiter appeared out of nowhere. \"This is the one who speaks English. Talk to the gentleman, Tocko.\"  \"Oh, yessen, missen. Me talken ze English and but very gooden. Me learnen ze human talken at Mars Porten. Don't I talk him gooden?\" The last was directed at Ronson.  \"You speak him very wonderfullen,\" Ronson answered. The waiter beamed.  \"Bring the gentleman a mariwaukee,\" the girl said.  \"Oh, yessen, missen.\"  \"On second thought, make it a double shot,\" the girl said. \"The gentleman looks like he needs it.\" She nodded brightly to Ronson as if she had selected the very medicine he needed. \"Now tell me what you are doing on Mars, Dr. Ronson?\"  Ronson glanced hastily at the waiter, to make certain that he was out of earshot. \"I--I came here on a vacation,\" he said firmly and loudly. \"I've wanted to see Mars ever since I was a kid. Who--ah--was sitting here with you before I came?\"  \"A man,\" she answered. \"He went to the little boy's room just before you got into trouble in the street. I guess he's still there, if some Martian hasn't slit his throat. Are you enjoying your vacation?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"Do you mind if I call you Jim?\" She smiled at him.  \"I would be very pleased.\"  \"Good. You can call me Jennie.\"  \"Thanks.\"  \"Then you are enjoying your vacation.\" Her smile was very sweet. \"Are you also enjoying trying to lie to me--Jim?\"  Ronson caught his start of surprise. Jennie Ware bewildered him but this was a game that two could play. \"Of course I'm enjoying it. Lying to a woman as beautiful as you are is always a pleasure--Jennie.\" He grinned at her and watched the anger come up on her face. Why should she be angry?  The anger was gone as swiftly as it had come. She leaned across the table, put her hand on his. \"I like you Jim. I really do. And not because you called me a beautiful woman but because you kicked me in the teeth with my own act. I had it coming and you gave it to me very neatly.\"  The touch of her hand was very pleasant. \"No hard feelings. What--ah--are you doing here, Jennie?\"  She smiled sweetly at him. \"I'm on a vacation too, Jim.\"  \"Touche!\" The females in the laboratories back on earth had never touched his hand or called him by his first name. He wondered about the man with whom she had been drinking. Also he was very uneasy about her real reason for being here. No woman with good sense would make the rough rocket trip to Mars for a vacation; presuming she did come to Mars, she would not willingly come to this place. But Jennie Ware was here, an enigma wrapped up in a beautiful smile. He took his eyes off her long enough to look around the place again.  In Mars Port, he had seen the native dives, but Mars Port had nothing like this. To the natives, this was a place of pleasure, filled with sights, sounds, and smells that made them happy. Over against the farther wall a tribal chieftan was absorbing _narseeth_ through the skin of his hands, thrusting them again and again into the sirupy, smoky-colored mixture in the bowl in front of him. Every so often he stopped, whereupon the Martian female with him carefully dried his hands. After they were dry, he made fumbling passes at her. She accepted the passes without resistance. Ronson stared at the sight.  \"Relax. You'll get used to it,\" Jennie Ware said.  At another table a huge Martian was sitting. Two others were with him. One sat facing the rear, the other faced the front. Ronson had the impression of two alert dogs guarding their master. A little chill passed through him at the thought.  Odors were in the place, of sweat dried into _dothar_ skin garments, of stale drinks. Dim but distinct was the all-pervading clinging, cloying odor of _tamil_, the Martian equivalent of musk. Through an opening at the right, Ronson could see females lounging at ease in what was apparently a reception room to a brothel.  Unease came up in him again. How could this place be the way to Les Ro? But the rumors he had picked up and carefully checked in Mars Port had all been in agreement, if you wanted to see Les Ro, you came here. What happened after that was obviously fate.  Watching, Ronson saw that no Martian entered the circle on the floor.  He nodded toward the Martian females. \"What do you think of this?\"  \"Oh, a girl has to live,\" she said, shrugging. \"What do you think?\"  \"Oh, a Martian has to have fun, I suppose.\" His shrug was as indifferent as hers had been. For an instant, he thought she was going to spit at him.  The waiter arrived with the drink.  \"I have putten you on ze listen,\" he said, confidentially, to Ronson.  \"On the _listen_?\"  \"He means _list_,\" Jennie Ware said.  \"What list?\" Ronson asked.  \"On ze listen of zozen waiten to see ze great Les Ro,\" the waiter answered.  Inside of him, Ronson felt cold come up. Strictly on his own, he had to decide how he was going to handle this. He made up his mind on impulse. \"Who the devil is Les Ro?\"  Across the table, Jennie Ware lifted startled eyes toward Ronson. The waiter's face showed astonishment, then embarrassment, at the idea that anyone existed who had not heard of Les Ro, Ronson thought. \"You do not knowen ze great Les Ro. He is ze greatest zinker, ze greatest doer, ze greatest--\"  \"Stinker?\" Jennie Ware said. \"That sounds about right.\"  \"You are maken ze kidden wiz me,\" the waiter said, indignation in his voice. \"You have hearden of ze great Les Ro. You came here to see him. You musten haven. Everybody who comes here, comes to see him.\" The waiter spoke with authority.  \"I'm sorry,\" Ronson said. \"If he is that important, I would like to talk to him, of course. But do you mean all of these Martians are waiting to see him?\" A wave of his hand indicated the group in the room.  The waiter, mollified, leered at Ronson. \"Ze girls didn't. Ze girls come here for anuzzer purpose.\" The leering gesture included Jennie Ware in it. It said that obviously she had come here for the same purpose. What other purpose was there?  The girl gasped. Fire shot from her eyes. \"I'll have you know--\"  \"Shut up,\" Ronson said.  Fire flashed at him. \"Hasn't it occurred to you that you are in danger of getting your pretty little throat slit if you talk out of turn here?\" Ronson whispered.  \"Even ze noffers outside are on ze listen,\" the waiter added.  \"What about me? Am I on it?\" Jennie asked.  The waiter showed great astonishment. \"But of course not. You are a female.\"  \"What difference does that make?\" This time the fire really shot from her eyes.  \"How long do you have to wait after you're on the listen?\" Ronson hastily asked.  The waiter spread his hands and twisted his shoulders. \"Who knows? Some of ze noffers outside have been waiting since last wind time--\"  \"Almost an Earth year,\" Ronson said, calculating rapidly. Once during each circle of the sun the great winds blew across Mars. This was the biggest natural event on the planet. Since it occurred with the regularity of clock work, it served as the starting point for their year.  \"Sometimes ze great Les Ro call you right away,\" the waiter said.  \"How will I know if I'm called?\" Ronson said.  A shudder passed over the waiter. \"You vill know. Of a most certain, you vill know. Ze Messenger vill call.\" The shudder came again. As if he had already said too much, the waiter hurried away. Ronson turned back to Jennie Ware. She was sparkling with fury.  \"If they think they're going to keep"]]]
