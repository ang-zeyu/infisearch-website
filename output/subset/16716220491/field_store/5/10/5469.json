On the twelfth day after Nitetis' death Cambyses went out hunting, in the hope that the danger and excitement of the sport might divert his mind. The magnates and men of high rank at his court received him with thunders of applause, for which he returned cordial thanks.  These few days of grief had worked a great change in a man so unaccustomed to suffering as Cambyses.  His face was pale, his raven-black hair and beard had grown grey, and the consciousness of victory which usually shone in his eyes was dimmed.  Had he not, only too painfully, experienced that there was a stronger will than his own, and that, easily as he could destroy, it did not he in his power to preserve the life of the meanest creature?  Before starting, Cambyses mustered his troop of sportsmen, and calling Gobryas, asked why Phanes was not there.  \"My King did not order .  .  .\"  \"He is my guest and companion, once for all; call him and follow us.\"  Gobryas bowed, dashed back to the palace, and in half an hour reappeared among the royal retinue with Phanes.  The Athenian was warmly welcomed by many of the group, a fact which seems strange when we remember that courtiers are of all men the most prone to envy, and a royal favorite always the most likely object to excite their ill will.  But Phanes seemed a rare exception to this rule.  He had met the Achaemenidae in so frank and winning a manner, had excited so many hopes by the hints he had thrown out of an expected and important war, and had aroused so much merriment by well-told jests, such as the Persians had never heard before, that there were very few who did not welcome his appearance gladly, and when--in company with the king--he separated from the rest in chase of a wild ass, they openly confessed to one another, that they had never before seen so perfect a man.  The clever way in which he had brought the innocence of the accused to light, the finesse which he had shown in securing the king's favor, and the ease with which he had learnt the Persian language in so short a time, were all subjects of admiration.  Neither was there one even of the Achaemenidae themselves, who exceeded him in beauty of face or symmetry of figure.  In the chase he proved himself a perfect horseman, and in a conflict with a bear an exceptionally courageous and skilful sportsman. On the way home, as the courtiers were extolling all the wonderful qualities possessed by the king's favorite, old Araspes exclaimed, \"I quite agree with you that this Greek, who by the way has proved himself a better soldier than anything else, is no common man, but I am sure you would not praise him half as much, if he were not a foreigner and a novelty.\"  Phanes happened to be only separated from the speaker by some thick bushes, and heard these words.  When the other had finished, he went up and said, smiling: \"I understood what you said and feel obliged to you for your kind opinion.  The last sentence, however, gave me even more pleasure than the first, because it confirmed my own idea that the Persians are the most generous people in the world--they praise the virtues of other nations as much, or even more, than their own.\"  His hearers smiled, well pleased at this flattering remark, and Phanes went on: \"How different the Jews are now, for instance!  They fancy themselves the exclusive favorites of the gods, and by so doing incur the contempt of all wise men, and the hatred of the whole world.  And then the Egyptians!  You have no idea of the perversity of that people.  Why, if the priests could have their way entirely, (and they have a great deal of power in their hands) not a foreigner would be left alive in Egypt, nor a single stranger allowed to enter the country.  A true Egyptian would rather starve, than eat out of the same dish with one of us.  There are more strange, astonishing and wonderful things to be seen in that country than anywhere else in the world.  And yet, to do it justice, I must say that Egypt has been well spoken of as the richest and most highly cultivated land under the sun.  The man who possesses that kingdom need not envy the very gods themselves.  It would be mere child's play to conquer that beautiful country.  Ten years there gave me a perfect insight into the condition of things, and I know that their entire military caste would not be sufficient to resist one such troop as your Immortals.  Well, who knows what the future may bring!  Perhaps we may all make a little trip together to the Nile some day.  In my opinion, your good swords have been rather long idle.\"  These well-calculated words were received with such shouts of applause, that the king turned his horse to enquire the cause.  Phanes answered quickly that the Achaemenidae were rejoicing in the thought that a war might possibly be near at hand.  \"What war?\"  asked the king, with the first smile that had been seen on his face for many days.  \"We were only speaking in general of the possibility of such a thing,\" answered Phanes carelessly; then, riding up to the king's side, his voice took an impressive tone full of feeling, and looking earnestly into his face, he began: \"It is true, my Sovereign, that I was not born in this beautiful country as one of your subjects, nor can I boast of a long acquaintance with the most powerful of monarchs, but yet I cannot resist the presumptuous, perhaps criminal thought, that the gods at my birth appointed me to be your real friend.  It is not your rich gifts that have drawn me to you.  I did not need them, for I belong to the wealthier class of my countrymen, and I have no son,--no heir,--to whom I can bequeath my treasures.  Once I had a boy--a beautiful, gentle child; --but I was not going to speak of that,--I .  .  .  Are you offended at my freedom of speech, my Sovereign?\"  \"What is there to offend me?\"  answered the king, who had never been spoken to in this manner before, and felt strongly attracted to the original foreigner.  \"Till to-day I felt that your grief was too sacred to be disturbed, but now the time has come to rouse you from it and to make your heart glow once more.  You will have to hear what must be very painful to you.\"  \"There is nothing more now, that can grieve me.\"  \"What I am going to tell you will not give you pain; on the contrary, it will rouse your anger.\"  \"You make me curious.\"  \"You have been shamefully deceived; you and that lovely creature, who died such an early death a few days ago.\"  Cambyses' eyes flashed a demand for further information.  \"Amasis, the King of Egypt, has dared to make sport of you, the lord of the world.  That gentle girl was not his daughter, though she herself believed that she was; she .  .  .\"  \"Impossible!\"  \"It would seem so, and yet I am speaking the simple truth.  Amasis spun a web of lies, in which he managed to entrap, not only the whole world, but you too, my Sovereign.  Nitetis, the most lovely creature ever born of woman, was the daughter of a king, but not of the usurper Amasis. Hophra, the rightful king of Egypt, was the father of this pearl among women.  You may well frown, my Sovereign.  It is a cruel thing to be betrayed by one's friends and allies.\"  Cambyses spurred his horse, and after a silence of some moments, kept by Phanes purposely, that his words might make a deeper impression, cried, \"Tell me more!  I wish to know everything.\"  \"Hophra had been living twenty years in easy captivity in Sais after his dethronement, when his wife, who had borne him three children and buried them all, felt that she was about to give birth to a fourth.  Hophra, in his joy, determined to offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving in the temple of Pacht, the Egyptian goddess supposed to confer the blessing of children, when, on his way thither, a former magnate of his court, named Patarbemis, whom, in a fit of unjust anger, he had ignominiously mutilated, fell upon him with a troop of slaves and massacred him. Amasis had the unhappy widow brought to his palace at once, and assigned her an apartment next to the one occupied by his own queen Ladice, who was also expecting soon to give birth to a child.  A girl was born to Hophra's widow, but the mother died in the same hour, and two days later Ladice bore a child also.--But I see we are in the court of the palace. If you allow, I will have the report of the physician, by whom this imposture was effected, read before you.  Several of his notes have, by a remarkable conjuncture of circumstances, which I will explain to you later, fallen into my hands.  A former high-priest of Heliopolis, Onuphis, is now living in Babylon, and understands all the different styles of writing in use among his countrymen.  Nebenchari will, of course, refuse to help in disclosing an imposture, which must inevitably lead to the ruin of his country.\"  \"In an hour I expect to see you here with the man you have just spoken of.  Croesus, Nebenchari, and all the Achaemenidae who were in Egypt, will have to appear also.  I must have certainty before I can act, and your testimony alone is not sufficient, because I know from Amasis, that you have cause to feel a grudge against his house.\"  At the time appointed all were assembled before the king in obedience to his command.  Onuphis, the former high-priest, was an old man of eighty.  A pair of large, clear, intelligent, grey eyes looked out of a head so worn and wasted, as to be more like a mere skull than the head of a living man. He held a large papyrus-roll in his gaunt hand, and was seated in an easy chair, as his paralyzed limbs did not allow of his standing, even in the king's presence.  His dress was snow-white, as beseemed a priest, but there were patches and rents to be seen here and there.  His figure might perhaps once have been tall and slender, but it was now so bent and shrunk by age, privation and suffering, as to look unnatural and dwarfish, in comparison with the size of his head.  Nebenchari, who revered Onuphis, not only as a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5458"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 09 (#1)"],["body","off in the crowd.  From the conversation of two Ionian mercenaries behind him he learnt that the family of Amasis had been to the temple to pray for the dying king.  The procession was headed by richly-decorated priests, either wearing long white robes or pantherskins.  They were followed by men holding office at the court, and carrying golden staves, on the ends of which peacocks' feathers and silver lotus-flowers were fastened, and these by Pastophori, carrying on their shoulders a golden cow, the animal sacred to Isis.  When the crowd had bowed down before this sacred symbol, the queen appeared.  She was dressed in priestly robes and wore a costly head-dress with the winged disc and the Uraeus.  In her left hand she held a sacred golden sistrum,  the tones of which were to scare away Typhon, and in her right some lotus-flowers.  The wife, daughter and sister of the high-priest followed her, in similar but less splendid ornaments.  Then came the heir to the throne, in rich robes of state, as priest and prince; and behind him four young priests in white carrying Tachot, (the daughter of Amasis and Ladice and the pretended sister of Nitetis,) in an open litter.  The heat of the day, and the earnestness of her prayers, had given the sick girl a slight color.  Her blue eyes, filled with tears, were fixed on the sistrum which her weak, emaciated hands had hardly strength to hold.  A murmur of compassion ran through the crowd; for they loved their dying king, and manifested openly and gladly the sympathy so usually felt for young lives from whom a brilliant future has been snatched by disease. Such was Amasis' young, fading daughter, who was now being carried past them, and many an eye grew dim as the beautiful invalid came in sight. Tachot seemed to notice this, for she raised her eyes from the sistrum and looked kindly and gratefully at the crowd.  Suddenly the color left her face, she turned deadly pale, and the golden sistrum fell on to the stone pavement with a clang, close to Bartja's feet.  He felt that he had been recognized and for one moment thought of hiding himself in the crowd; but only for one moment--his chivalrous feeling gained the day, he darted forward, picked up the sistrum, and forgetting the danger in which he was placing himself, held it out to the princess.  Tachot looked at him earnestly before taking the golden sistrum from his hands, and then said, in a low voice, which only he could understand: \"Are you Bartja?  Tell me, in your mother's name--are you Bartja?\"  \"Yes, I am,\" was his answer, in a voice as low as her own, \"your friend, Bartja.\"  He could not say more, for the priests pushed him back among the crowd. When he was in his old place, he noticed that Tachot, whose bearers had begun to move on again, was looking round at him.  The color had come back into her cheeks, and her bright eyes were trying to meet his.  He did not avoid them; she threw him a lotus-bud-he stooped to pick it up, and then broke his way through the crowd, for this hasty act had roused their attention.  A quarter of an hour later, he was seated in the boat which was to take him to Sappho and to his wedding.  He was quite at ease now about Zopyrus.  In Bartja's eyes his friend was already as good as saved, and in spite of the dangers which threatened himself, he felt strangely calm and happy, he could hardly say why.  Meanwhile the sick princess had been carried home, had had her oppressive ornaments taken off, and her couch carried on to one of the palace- balconies where she liked best to pass the hot summer days, sheltered by broad-leaved plants, and a kind of awning.  From this veranda, she could look down into the great fore-court of the palace, which was planted with trees.  To-day it was full of priests, courtiers, generals and governors of provinces.  Anxiety and suspense were expressed in every face: Amasis' last hour was drawing very near.  Tachot could not be seen from below; but listening with feverish eagerness, she could hear much that was said.  Now that they had to dread the loss of their king, every one, even the priests, were full of his praises.  The wisdom and circumspection of his plans and modes of government, his unwearied industry, the moderation he had always shown, the keenness of his wit, were, each and all, subjects of admiration. \"How Egypt has prospered under Amasis' government!\" said a Nomarch. \"And what glory he gained for our arms, by the conquest of Cyprus and the war with the Libyans!\"  cried one of the generals.  \"How magnificently he embellished our temples, and what great honors he paid to the goddess of Sais!\"  exclaimed one of the singers of Neith.  \"And then how gracious and condescending he was!\"  murmured a courtier.  \"How cleverly he managed to keep peace with the great powers!\"  said the secretary of state, and the treasurer, wiping away a tear, cried: \"How thoroughly he understood the management of the revenue!  Since the reign of Rameses III. the treasury has not been so well filled as now.\"  \"Psamtik comes into a fine inheritance,\" lisped the courtier, and the soldier exclaimed, \"Yes, but it's to be feared that he'll not spend it in a glorious war; he's too much under the influence of the priests.\"  \"No, you are wrong there,\" answered the temple-singer.  \"For some time past, our lord and master has seemed to disdain the advice of his most faithful servants.\" \"The successor of such a father will find it difficult to secure universal approbation,\" said the Nomarch.  \"It is not every one who has the intellect, the good fortune and the wisdom of Amasis.\"  \"The gods know that!\"  murmured the warrior with a sigh.  Tachot's tears flowed fast.  These words were a confirmation of what they had been trying to hide from her: she was to lose her dear father soon.  After she had made this dreadful certainty clear to her own mind, and discovered that it was in vain to beg her attendants to carry her to her dying father, she left off listening to the courtiers below, and began looking at the sistrum which Bartja himself had put into her hand, and which she had brought on to the balcony with her, as if seeking comfort there.  And she found what she sought; for it seemed to her as if the sound of its sacred rings bore her away into a smiling, sunny landscape.  That faintness which so often comes over people in decline, had seized her and was sweetening her last hours with pleasant dreams.  The female slaves, who stood round to fan away the flies, said afterwards that Tachot had never looked so lovely.  She had lain about an hour in this state, when her breathing became more difficult, a slight cough made her breast heave, and the bright red blood trickled down from her lips on to her white robe.  She awoke, and looked surprised and disappointed on seeing the faces round her.  The sight of her mother, however, who came on to the veranda at that moment, brought a smile to her face, and she said, \"O mother, I have had such a beautiful dream.\"  \"Then our visit to the temple has done my dear child good?\"  asked the queen, trembling at the sight of the blood on the sick girl's lips.  \"Oh, yes, mother, so much! for I saw him again.\"  Ladice's glance at the attendants seemed to ask \"Has your poor mistress lost her senses?\" Tachot understood the look and said, evidently speaking with great difficulty: \"You think I am wandering, mother.  No, indeed, I really saw and spoke to him.  He gave me my sistrum again, and said he was my friend, and then he took my lotus-bud and vanished.  Don't look so distressed and surprised, mother.  What I say is really true; it is no dream.--There, you hear, Tentrut saw him too.  He must have come to Sais for my sake, and so the child-oracle in the temple-court did not deceive me, after all.  And now I don't feel anything more of my illness; I dreamt I was lying in a field of blooming poppies, as red as the blood of the young lambs that are offered in sacrifice; Bartja was sitting by my side, and Nitetis was kneeling close to us and playing wonderful songs on a Nabla  made of ivory.  And there was such a lovely sound in the air that I felt as if Horus, the beautiful god of morning, spring, and the resurrection, was kissing me.  Yes, mother, I tell you he is coming soon, and when I am well, then--then--ah, mother what is this?  .  .  .  I am dying!\"  Ladice knelt down by her child's bed and pressed her lips in burning kisses on the girl's eyes as they grew dim in death.  An hour later she was standing by another bedside--her dying husband's.  Severe suffering had disfigured the king's features, the cold perspiration was standing on his forehead, and his hands grasped the golden lions on the arms of the deep-seated invalid chair in which he was resting, almost convulsively.  When Ladice came in he opened his eyes; they were as keen and intelligent as if he had never lost his sight.  \"Why do not you bring Tachot to me?\"  he asked in a dry voice.  \"She is too ill, and suffers so much, that .  .  .\"  \"She is dead!  Then it is well with her, for death is not punishment; it is the end and aim of life,--the only end that we can attain without effort, but through sufferings!--the gods alone know how great.  Osiris has taken her to himself, for she was innocent.  And Nitetis is dead too. Where is Nebenchari's letter?\"  \"Here is the place: 'She took her own life, and died calling down a heavy curse on thee and thine.  The poor, exiled, scorned and plundered oculist Nebenchari in Babylon sends thee this intelligence to Egypt.  It is as true as his own hatred of thee.'  Listen to these words, Psamtik, and remember how on his dying bed thy father told thee that, for every drachm of pleasure purchased on earth by wrong-doing, the dying bed will be burdened by a talent's weight of remorse.  Fearful misery is coming on Egypt for Nitetis' sake.  Cambyses is preparing to make war on us.  He will sweep down on Egypt like a scorching wind from the desert.  Much, which I"]]]
