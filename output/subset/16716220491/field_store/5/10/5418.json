Just why she dreaded it is a matter of feminine psychology best left to the reader for solution.  The argument began, as usual, with the tearing apart limb by limb of the unfortunate Franklin Pierce, by Judge Whipple.  \"What a miserable exhibition in the eyes of the world,\" said the Judge. \"Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire\" (he pronounced this name with infinite scorn) \"managed by Jefferson Davis of Mississippi!\"  \"And he was well managed, sir,\" said the Colonel.  \"What a pliant tool of your Southern slaveholders! I hear that you are to give him a plantation as a reward.\"  \"No such thing, sir.\"  \"He deserves it,\" continued the Judge, with conviction. \"See the magnificent forts he permitted Davis to build up in the South, the arsenals he let him stock. The country does not realize this. But the day will, come when they will execrate Pierce before Benedict Arnold, sir. And look at the infamous Kansas-Nebraska act! That is the greatest crime, and Douglas and Pierce the greatest criminals, of the century.\"  \"Do have some more of that fried chicken, Judge,\" said Virginia.  Mr. Whipple helped himself fiercely, and the Colonel smiled.  \"You should be satisfied now,\" said he. \"Another Northern man is in the White House.\"  \"Buchanan!\" roared the Judge, with his mouth full.  \"Another traitor, sir. Another traitor worse than the first. He swallows the Dred Scott decision, and smirks. What a blot on the history of this Republic! O Lord!\" cried Mr. Whipple, \"what are we coming to? A Northern man, he could gag and bind Kansas and force her into slavery against the will of her citizens. He packs his Cabinet to support the ruffians you send over the borders. The very governors he ships out there, his henchmen, have their stomachs turned. Look at Walker, whom they are plotting against in Washington. He can't stand the smell of this Lecompton Constitution Buchanan is trying to jam down their throats. Jefferson Davis would have troops there, to be sure that it goes through, if he had his way. Can't you see how one sin leads to another, Carvel? How slavery is rapidly demoralizing a free people?\"  \"It is because you won't let it alone where it belongs, sir,\" retorted the Colonel. It was seldom that he showed any heat in his replies. He talked slowly, and he had a way of stretching forth his hand to prevent the more eager Judge from interrupting him.  \"The welfare of the whole South, as matters now stand, sir, depends upon slavery. Our plantations could not exist a day without slave labor. If you abolished that institution, Judge Whipple, you would ruin millions of your fellow-countrymen,--you would reduce sovereign states to a situation of disgraceful dependence. And all, sir,\" now he raised his voice lest the Judge break in, \"all, sir, for the sake of a low breed that ain't fit for freedom. You and I, who have the Magna Charta and the Declaration of Independence behind us, who are descended from a race that has done nothing but rule for ten centuries and more, may well establish a Republic where the basis of stability is the self-control of the individual--as long as men such as you and I form its citizens. Look at the South Americans. How do Republics go there? And the minute you and I let in niggers, who haven't any more self-control than dogs, on an equal basis, with as much of a vote as you have,--niggers, sir, that have lived like wild beasts in the depths of the jungle since the days of Ham, --what's going to become of our Republic?\"  \"Education,\" cried the Judge.  But the word was snatched out of his mouth.  \"Education isn't a matter of one generation. No, sir, nor two, nor three, nor four. But of centuries.\"  \"Sir,\" said the Judge, \"I can point out negroes of intelligence and learning.\"  \"And I reckon you could teach some monkeys to talk English, and recite the catechism, and sing emotional hymns, if you brought over a couple of million from Africa,\" answered the Colonel, dryly, as he rose to put on his hat and light a cigar.  It was his custom to offer a cigar to the Judge, who invariably refused, and rubbed his nose with scornful violence.  Virginia, on the verge of leaving, stayed on, fascinated by the turn the argument had taken.  \"Your prejudice is hide-bound, sir,\" said Mr. Whipple.  \"No, Whipple,\" said the Colonel, \"when God washed off this wicked earth, and started new, He saw fit to put the sons of Ham in subjection. They're slaves of each other in Africa, and I reckon they're treated no better than they are here. Abuses can't be helped in any system, sir, though we are bettering them. Were the poor in London in the days of the Edwards as well off as our niggers are to-day?\"  The Judge snorted.  \"A divine institution!\" he shouted. \"A black curse! Because the world has been a wicked place of oppression since Noah's day, is that any reason why it should so continue until the day of Judgment?\"  The Colonel smiled, which was a sign that he was pleased with his argument.  \"Now, see here, Whipple,\" said he. \"If we had any guarantee that you would let us alone where we are, to manage our slaves and to cultivate our plantations, there wouldn't be any trouble. But the country keeps on growing and growing, and you're not content with half. You want everything,--all the new states must abolish slavery. And after a while you will overwhelm us, and ruin us, and make us paupers. Do you wonder that we contend for our rights, tooth and nail? They are our rights.\"  \"If it had not been for Virginia and Maryland and the South, this nation would not be in existence.\"  The Colonel laughed.  \"First rate, Jinny,\" he cried. \"That's so.\"  But the Judge was in a revery. He probably had not heard her.  \"The nation is going to the dogs,\" he said, mumbling rather to himself than to the others. \"We shall never prosper until the curse is shaken off, or wiped out in blood. It clogs our progress. Our merchant marine, of which we were so proud, has been annihilated by these continued disturbances. But, sir,\" he cried, hammering his fist upon the table until the glasses rang, \"the party that is to save us was born at Pittsburgh last year on Washington's birthday. The Republican Party, sir.\"  \"Shucks!\" exclaimed Mr. Carvel, with amusement, \"The Black Republican Party, made up of old fools and young Anarchists, of Dutchmen and nigger-worshippers. Why, Whipple, that party's a joke. Where's your leader?\"  \"In Illinois,\" was the quick response.  \"What's his name?\"  \"Abraham Lincoln, sir,\" thundered Mr. Whipple. \"And to my way of thinking he has uttered a more significant phrase on the situation than any of your Washington statesmen. 'This government,' said he to a friend of mine, 'cannot exist half slave and half free.'\"  So impressively did Mr. Whipple pronounce these words that Mr. Carvel stirred uneasily, and in spite of himself, as though he were listening to an oracle. He recovered instantly.  \"He's a demagogue, seeking for striking phrases, sir. You're too intelligent a man to be taken in by such as he.\"  \"I tell you he is not, sir.\"  \"I know him, sir,\" cried the Colonel, taking down his feet. \"He's an obscure lawyer. Poor white trash! Torn down poor! My friend Mr. Richardson of Springfield tells me he is low down. He was born in a log cabin, and spends most of his time in a drug-store telling stories that you would not listen to, Judge Whipple.\"  \"I would listen to anything he said,\" replied the Judge. \"Poor white trash, sir! The greatest men rise from the people. A demagogue!\" Mr. Whipple fairly shook with rage. \"The nation doesn't know him yet. But mark my words, the day will come when it will. He was ballotted for Vice-President in the Philadelphia convention last year. Nobody paid any attention to that. If the convention had heard him speak at Bloomington, he would have been nominated instead of Fremont. If the nation could have heard him, he would be President to-day instead of that miserable Buchanan. I happened to be at Bloomington. And while the idiots on the platform were drivelling, the people kept calling for Lincoln. I had never heard of him then. I've never forgot him since. He came ambling out of the back of the hall, a lanky, gawky looking man, ridiculously ugly, sir. But the moment he opened his mouth he had us spellbound. The language which your low-down lawyer used was that of a God-sent prophet, sir. He had those Illinois bumpkins all worked up,--the women crying, and some of the men, too. And mad! Good Lord, they were mad--'We will say to the Southern disunionists,' he cried,--'we will say to the Southern disunionists, we won't go out of the Union, and you shan't.'\"  There was a silence when the Judge finished. But presently Mr. Carvel took a match. And he stood over the Judge in his favorite attitude, --with his feet apart,--as he lighted another cigar.  \"I reckon we're going to have war, Silas,\" said he, slowly; \"but don't you think that your Mr. Lincoln scares me into that belief. I don't count his bluster worth a cent. No sirree! It's this youngster who comes out here from Boston and buys a nigger with all the money he's got in the world. And if he's an impetuous young fool; I'm no judge of men.\"  \"Appleton Brice wasn't precisely impetuous,\" remarked Mr. Whipple. And he smiled a little bitterly, as though the word had stirred a memory.  \"I like that young fellow,\" Mr. Carvel continued. \"It seems to be a kind of fatality with me to get along with Yankees. I reckon there's a screw loose somewhere, but Brice acted the man all the way through. He goa a fall out of you, Silas, in your room, after the show. Where are you going, Jinny?\"  Virginia had risen, and she was standing very erects with a flush on her face, waiting for her father to finish.  \"To see Anne Brinsmade,\" she said. \"Good-by, Uncle Silas.\"  She had called him so from childhood. Hers was the one voice that seemed to soften him--it never failed. He turned to her now with a movement that was almost"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/539"],["title","A. W. Kinglake: A Biographical and Literary Study (#1)"],["body"," he tells us in “Eothen,” his home in the saddle and his love for Homer.  A tradition is preserved in the family that on the day of her funeral, at a churchyard five miles away, he was missed from the household group reassembled in the mourning home; he was found to have ordered his horse, and galloped back in the darkness to his mother’s grave.  Forty years later he writes to Alexander Knox: “The death of a mother has an almost magical power of recalling the home of one’s childhood, and the almost separate world that rests upon affection.”  Of his two sisters, one was well read and agreeably talkative, noted by Thackeray as the cleverest woman he had ever met; the other, Mrs. Acton, was a delightful old _esprit fort_, as I knew her in the sixties, “pagan, I regret to say,” but not a little resembling her brother in the point and manner of her wit.  The family moved in his infancy to an old-fashioned handsome “Wilton House,” adjoining closely to the town, but standing amid spacious park-like grounds, and inhabited in after years by Kinglake’s younger brother Hamilton, who succeeded his uncle in the medical profession, and passed away, amid deep and universal regret, in 1898.  Here during the thirties Sydney Smith was a frequent and a welcome visitor; it was in answer to old Mrs. Kinglake that he uttered his audacious _mot_ on being asked if he would object, as a neighbouring clergyman had done, to bury a Dissenter: “Not bury Dissenters?  I should like to be burying them all day!”  Taunton was an innutrient foster-mother, _arida nutrix_, for such young lions as the Kinglake brood.  Two hundred years before it had been a prosperous and famous place, its woollen and kersey trades, with the population they supported, ranking it as eighth in order among English towns.  Its inhabitants were then a gallant race, republican in politics, Puritan in creed.  Twice besieged by Goring and Lumford, it had twice repelled the Royalists with loss.  It was the centre of Monmouth’s rebellion and of Jeffrey’s vengeance; the suburb of Tangier, hard by its ancient castle, still recalls the time when Colonel Kirke and his regiment of “Lambs” were quartered in the town.  But long before the advent of the Kinglakes its glory had departed; its manufactures had died out, its society become Philistine and bourgeois—“little men who walk in narrow ways”—while from pre-eminence in electoral venality among English boroughs it was saved only by the near proximity of Bridgewater.  A noted statesman who, at a later period, represented it in Parliament, used to say that by only one family besides Dr. Hamilton Kinglake’s could he be received with any sense of social or intellectual equality.  Not much, however, of Kinglake’s time was given to his native town: he was early sent to the Grammar School at Ottery St. Mary’s, the “Clavering” of “Pendennis,” whose Dr. Wapshot was George Coleridge, brother of the poet.  He was wont in after life to speak of this time with bitterness; a delicate child, he was starved on insufficient diet; and an eloquent passage in “Eothen” depicts his intellectual fall from the varied interests and expanding enthusiasm of liberal home teaching to the regulation gerund-grinding and Procrustean discipline of school. “The dismal change is ordained, and then—thin meagre Latin with small shreds and patches of Greek, is thrown like a pauper’s pall over all your early lore; instead of sweet knowledge, vile, monkish, doggerel grammars and graduses, dictionaries and lexicons, and horrible odds and ends of dead languages are given you for your portion, and down you fall, from Roman story to a three-inch scrap of ‘Scriptores Romani,’—from Greek poetry, down, down to the cold rations of ‘Poetæ Græci,’ cut up by commentators, and served out by school-masters!”  At Eton—under Keate, as all readers of “Eothen” know—he was contemporary with Gladstone, Sir F. Hanmer, Lords Canning and Dalhousie, Selwyn, Shadwell.  He wrote in the “Etonian,” created and edited by Mackworth Praed; and is mentioned in Praed’s poem on Surly Hall as      “Kinglake, dear to poetry,     And dear to all his friends.”  Dr. Gatty remembers his “determined pale face”; thinks that he made his mark on the river rather than in the playing fields, being a good oar and swimmer.  His great friend at school was Savile, the “Methley” of his travels, who became successively Lord Pollington and Earl of Mexborough. The Homeric lore which Methley exhibited in the Troad, is curiously illustrated by an Eton story, that in a pugilistic encounter with Hoseason, afterwards an Indian Cavalry officer, while the latter sate between the rounds upon his second’s knee, Savile strutted about the ring, spouting Homer.  Kinglake entered at Trinity, Cambridge, in 1828, among an exceptionally brilliant set—Tennyson, Arthur Hallam, John Sterling, Trench, Spedding, Spring Rice, Charles Buller, Maurice, Monckton Milnes, J. M. Kemble, Brookfield, Thompson.  With none of them does he seem in his undergraduate days to have been intimate.  Probably then, as afterwards, he shrank from _camaraderie_, shared Byron’s distaste for “enthusymusy”; naturally cynical and self-contained, was repelled by the spiritual fervour, incessant logical collision, aggressive tilting at abuses of those young “Apostles,” already      “Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would yield,     Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father’s field,”  waxing ever daily, as Sterling exhorted, “in religion and radicalism.” He saw life differently; more practically, if more selfishly; to one rhapsodizing about the “plain living and high thinking” of Wordsworth’s sonnet, he answered: “You know that you prefer dining with people who have good glass and china and plenty of servants.”  For Tennyson’s poetry he even then felt admiration; quotes, nay, misquotes, in “Eothen,” from the little known “Timbuctoo”; {12a} and from “Locksley Hall”; and supplied long afterwards an incident adopted by Tennyson in “Enoch Arden,”      “Once likewise in the ringing of his ears     Though faintly, merrily—far and far away—     He heard the pealing of his parish bells,” {12b}  from his own experience in the desert, when on a Sunday, amid overpowering heat and stillness, he heard the Marlen bells of Taunton peal for morning church. {13}  In whatever set he may have lived he made his mark at Cambridge.  Lord Houghton remembered him as an orator at the Union; and speaking to Cambridge undergraduates fifty years later, after enumerating the giants of his student days, Macaulay, Praed, Buller, Sterling, Merivale, he goes on to say: “there, too, were Kemble and Kinglake, the historian of our earliest civilization and of our latest war; Kemble as interesting an individual as ever was portrayed by the dramatic genius of his own race; Kinglake, as bold a man-at-arms in literature as ever confronted public opinion.”  We know, too, that not many years after leaving Cambridge he received, and refused, a solicitation to stand as Liberal representative of the University in Parliament.  He was, in fact, as far as any of his contemporaries from acquiescing in social conventionalisms and shams.  To the end of his life he chafed at such restraint: “when pressed to stay in country houses,” he writes in 1872, “I have had the frankness to say that I have not discipline enough.”  Repeatedly he speaks with loathing of the “stale civilization,” the “utter respectability,” of European life; {14a} longed with all his soul for the excitement and stir of soldiership, from which his shortsightedness debarred him; {14b} rushed off again and again into foreign travel; set out immediately on leaving Cambridge, in 1834, for his first Eastern tour, “to fortify himself for the business of life.”  Methley joined him at Hamburg, and they travelled by Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Vienna, to Semlin, where his book begins.  Lord Pollington’s health broke down, and he remained to winter at Corfu, while Kinglake pursued his way alone, returning to England in October, 1835. {14c}  On his return he read for the Chancery Bar along with his friend Eliot Warburton, under Bryan Procter, a Commissioner of Lunacy, better known by his poet-name, Barry Cornwall; his acquaintance with both husband and wife ripening into life-long friendship.  Mrs. Procter is the “Lady of Bitterness,” cited in the “Eothen” Preface.  As Anne Skepper, before her marriage, she was much admired by Carlyle; “a brisk witty prettyish clear eyed sharp tongued young lady”; and was the intimate, among many, especially of Thackeray and Browning.  In epigrammatic power she resembled Kinglake; but while his acrid sayings were emitted with gentlest aspect and with softest speech; while, like Byron’s Lambro:            “he was the mildest mannered man     That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat,     With such true breeding of a gentleman,     You never could divine his real thought,”  her sarcasms rang out with a resonant clearness that enforced and aggravated their severity.  That two persons so strongly resembling each other in capacity for rival exhibition, or for mutual exasperation, should have maintained so firm a friendship, often surprised their acquaintance; she explained it by saying that she and Kinglake sharpened one another like two knives; that, in the words of Petruchio,      “Where two raging fires meet together,     They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.”  [Picture: Eliot Warburton.  From a water-colour drawing in the possession                            of Canon Warburton]  Crabb Robinson, stung by her in a tender place, his boastful iterative monologues on Weimar and on Goethe, said that of all men Procter ought to escape purgatory after death, having tasted its fulness here through living so many years with Mrs. Procter; “the husbands of the talkative have great reward hereafter,” said Rudyard Kipling’s Lama.
