The mute slave picked it up, and laid it carefully on the table again, while his master threw a ball into a silver bason.  Several attendants rushed into the room, and Ani ordered them to bring to him the captive dwarf of the Lady Katuti.  His soul rose in indignation against the king, who in his remote camp-tent could fancy he had made him happy by a proof of his highest favor.  When we are plotting against a man we are inclined to regard him as an enemy, and if he offers us a rose we believe it to be for the sake, not of the perfume, but of the thorns.  The dwarf Nemu was brought before the Regent and threw himself on the ground at his feet.  Ani ordered the attendants to leave him, and said to the little man  \"You compelled me to put you in prison.  Stand up!\"  The dwarf rose and said, \"Be thanked--for my arrest too.\"  The Regent looked at him in astonishment; but Nemu went on half humbly, half in fun, \"I feared for my life, but thou hast not only not shortened it, but hast prolonged it; for in the solitude of the dungeon time seemed long, and the minutes grown to hours.\"  \"Keep your wit for the ladies,\" replied the Regent.  \"Did I not know that you meant well, and acted in accordance with the Lady Katuti's fancy, I would send you to the quarries.\"  \"My hands,\" mumbled the dwarf, \"could only break stones for a game of draughts; but my tongue is like the water, which makes one peasant rich, and carries away the fields of another.\"  \"We shall know how to dam it up.\"  \"For my lady and for thee it will always flow the right way,\" said the dwarf.  \"I showed the complaining citizens who it is that slaughters their flesh and blood, and from whom to look for peace and content.  I poured caustic into their wounds, and praised the physician.\"  \"But unasked and recklessly,\" interrupted Ani; \"otherwise you have shown yourself capable, and I am willing to spare you for a future time.  But overbusy friends are more damaging than intelligent enemies.  When I need your services I will call for you.  Till then avoid speech.  Now go to your mistress, and carry to Katuti this letter which has arrived for her.\"  \"Hail to Ani, the son of the Sun!\"  cried the dwarf kissing the Regent's foot.  \"Have I no letter to carry to my mistress Nefert?\"  \"Greet her from me,\" replied the Regent.  \"Tell Katuti I will visit her after the next meal.  The king's charioteer has not written, yet I hear that he is well.  Go now, and be silent and discreet.\"  The dwarf quitted the room, and Ani went into an airy hall, in which his luxurious meal was laid out, consisting of many dishes prepared with special care.  His appetite was gone, but he tasted of every dish, and gave the steward, who attended on him, his opinion of each.  Meanwhile he thought of the king's letter, of Bent-Anat, and whether it would be advisable to expose himself to a rejection on her part.  After the meal he gave himself up to his body-servant, who carefully shaved, painted, dressed, and decorated him, and then held the mirror before him.  He considered the reflection with anxious observation, and when he seated himself in his litter to be borne to the house of his friend Katuti, he said to himself that he still might claim to be called a handsome man.  If he paid his court to Bent-Anat--if she listened to his suit--what then?  He would refer it to Katuti, who always knew how to say a decisive word when he, entangled in a hundred pros and cons, feared to venture on a final step.  By her advice he had sought to wed the princess, as a fresh mark of honor--as an addition to his revenues--as a pledge for his personal safety.  His heart had never been more or less attached to her than to any other beautiful woman in Egypt.  Now her proud and noble personality stood before his inward eye, and he felt as if he must look up to it as to a vision high out of his reach.  It vexed him that he had followed Katuti's advice, and he began to wish his suit had been repulsed. Marriage with Bent-Anat seemed to him beset with difficulties.  His mood was that of a man who craves some brilliant position, though he knows that its requirements are beyond his powers--that of an ambitious soul to whom kingly honors are offered on condition that he will never remove a heavy crown from his head.  If indeed another plan should succeed, if-- and his eyes flashed eagerly--if fate set him on the seat of Rameses, then the alliance with Bent-Anat would lose its terrors; there would he be her absolute King and Lord and Master, and no one could require him to account for what he might be to her, or vouchsafe to her.     CHAPTER V.  During the events we have described the house of the charioteer Mena had not remained free from visitors.  It resembled the neighboring estate of Paaker, though the buildings were less new, the gay paint on the pillars and walls was faded, and the large garden lacked careful attention.  In the vicinity of the house only, a few well-kept beds blazed with splendid flowers, and the open colonnade, which was occupied by Katuti and her daughter, was furnished with royal magnificence.  The elegantly carved seats were made of ivory, the tables of ebony, and they, as well as the couches, had gilt feet.  The artistically worked Syrian drinking vessels on the sideboard, tables, and consoles were of many forms; beautiful vases full of flowers stood everywhere; rare perfumes rose from alabaster cups, and the foot sank in the thick pile of the carpets which covered the floor.  And over the apparently careless arrangement of these various objects there reigned a peculiar charm, an indescribably fascinating something.  Stretched at full-length on a couch, and playing with a silky-haired white cat, lay the fair Nefert--fanned to coolness by a negro-girl--while her mother Katuti nodded a last farewell to her sister Setchem and to Paaker.  Both had crossed this threshold for the first time for four years, that is since the marriage of Mena with Nefert, and the old enmity seemed now to have given way to heartfelt reconciliation and mutual understanding.  After the pioneer and his mother had disappeared behind the pomegranate shrubs at the entrance of the garden, Katuti turned to her daughter and said:  \"Who would have thought it yesterday?  I believe Paaker loves you still.\"  Nefert colored, and exclaimed softly, while she hit the kitten gently with her fan--  \"Mother!\"  Katuti smiled.  She was a tall woman of noble demeanor, whose sharp but delicately-cut features and sparkling eyes could still assert some pretensions to feminine beauty.  She wore a long robe, which reached below her ankles; it was of costly material, but dark in color, and of a studied simplicity.  Instead of the ornaments in bracelets, anklets, ear and finger-rings, in necklaces and clasps, which most of the Egyptian ladies --and indeed her own sister and daughter--were accustomed to wear, she had only fresh flowers, which were never wanting in the garden of her son-in-law.  Only a plain gold diadem, the badge of her royal descent, always rested, from early morning till late at night, on her high brow-- for a woman too high, though nobly formed--and confined the long blue- black hair, which fell unbraided down her back, as if its owner contemned the vain labor of arranging it artistically.  But nothing in her exterior was unpremeditated, and the unbejewelled wearer of the diadem, in her plain dress, and with her royal figure, was everywhere sure of being observed, and of finding imitators of her dress, and indeed of her demeanor.  And yet Katuti had long lived in need; aye at the very hour when we first make her acquaintance, she had little of her own, but lived on the estate of her son-in-law as his guest, and as the administrator of his possessions; and before the marriage of her daughter she had lived with her children in a house belonging to her sister Setchem.  She had been the wife of her own brother,       [Marriages between brothers and sisters were allowed in ancient      Egypt.  The Ptolemaic princes adopted this, which was contrary to      the Macedonian customs.  When Ptolemy II.  Philadelphus married his      sister Arsinoe, it seems to have been thought necessary to excuse it      by the relative positions of Venus and Saturn at that period, and      the constraining influences of these planets.]  who had died young, and who had squandered the greatest part of the possessions which had been left to him by the new royal family, in an extravagant love of display.  When she became a widow, she was received as a sister with her children by her brother-in-law, Paaker's father.  She lived in a house of her own, enjoyed the income of an estate assigned to her by the old Mohar, and left to her son-in-law the care of educating her son, a handsome and overbearing lad, with all the claims and pretensions of a youth of distinction.  Such great benefits would have oppressed and disgraced the proud Katuti, if she had been content with them and in every way agreed with the giver. But this was by no means the case; rather, she believed that she might pretend to a more brilliant outward position, felt herself hurt when her heedless son, while he attended school, was warned to work more seriously, as he would by and by have to rely on his own skill and his own strength.  And it had wounded her when occasionally her brother-in- law had suggested economy, and had reminded her, in his straightforward way, of her narrow means, and the uncertain future of her children.  At this she was deeply offended, for she ventured to say that her relatives could never, with all their gifts, compensate for the insults they heaped upon her; and thus taught them by experience that we quarrel with no one more readily than with the benefactor whom we can never repay for all the good he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5442"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 04 (#1)"],["body","share my mistress's trouble.\"  \"You speak riddles,\" said Paaker, \"what have they to fear?\"  The dwarf now related how Nefert's brother had gambled away the mummy of his father, how enormous was the sum he had lost, and that degradation must overtake Katuti, and her daughter with her.  \"Who can save them,\" he whimpered.  \"Her shameless husband squanders his inheritance and his prize-money.  Katuti is poor, and the little words \"Give me! scare away friends as the cry of a hawk scares the chickens. My poor mistress!\"  \"It is a large sum,\" muttered Paaker to himself.  \"It is enormous!\" sighed the dwarf, \"and where is it to be found in these hard times?  It would have been different with us, if--ah if--.  And it would be a form of madness which I do not believe in, that Nefert should still care for her braggart husband.  She thinks as much of thee as of him.\"  Paaker looked at the dwarf half incredulous and half threatening.  \"Ay--of thee,\" repeated Nemu.  \"Since our excursion to the Necropolis the day before yesterday it was--she speaks only of thee, praising thy ability, and thy strong manly spirit.  It is as if some charm obliged her to think of thee.\"  The pioneer began to walk so fast that his small companion once more had to ask him to moderate his steps.  They gained the shore in silence, where Paaker's boat was waiting, which also conveyed his chariot.  He lay down in the little cabin, called the dwarf to him, and said:  \"I am Katuti's nearest relative; we are now reconciled; why does she not turn to me in her difficulty?\"  \"Because she is proud, and thy blood flows in her veins.  Sooner would she die with her child--she said so--than ask thee, against whom she sinned, for an \"alms.\"  \"She did think of me then?\"  \"At once; nor did she doubt thy generosity.  She esteems thee highly--I repeat it; and if an arrow from a Cheta's bow or a visitation of the Gods attained Mena, she would joyfully place her child in thine arms, and Nefert believe me has not forgotten her playfellow.  The day before yesterday, when she came home from the Necropolis, and before the letter had come from the camp, she was full of thee--       [\"To be full (meh) of any one\" is used in the Egyptian language for      \"to be in love with any one.\"]  nay called to thee in her dreams; I know it from Kandake, her black maid.\"  The pioneer looked down and said:  \"How extraordinary! and the same night I had a vision in which your mistress appeared to me; the insolent priest in the temple of Hathor should have interpreted it to me.\"  \"And he refused? the fool! but other folks understand dreams, and I am not the worst of them--Ask thy servant.  Ninety-nine times out of a hundred my interpretations come true.  How was the vision?\"  \"I stood by the Nile,\" said Paaker, casting down his eyes and drawing lines with his whip through the wool of the cabin rug.  \"The water was still, and I saw Nefert standing on the farther bank, and beckoning to me.  I called to her, and she stepped on the water, which bore her up as if it were this carpet.  She went over the water dry-foot as if it were the stony wilderness.  A wonderful sight!  She came nearer to me, and nearer, and already I had tried to take her hand, when she ducked under like a swan.  I went into the water to seize her, and when she came up again I clasped her in my arms; but then the strangest thing happened-- she flowed away, she dissolved like the snow on the Syrian hills, when you take it in your hand, and yet it was not the same, for her hair turned to water-lilies, and her eyes to blue fishes that swam away merrily, and her lips to twigs of coral that sank at once, and from her body grew a crocodile, with a head like Mena, that laughed and gnashed its teeth at me.  Then I was seized with blind fury; I threw myself upon him with a drawn sword, he fastened his teeth in my flesh, I pierced his throat with my weapon; the Nile was dark with our streaming blood, and so we fought and fought--it lasted an eternity--till I awoke.\"  Paaker drew a deep breath as he ceased speaking; as if his wild dream tormented him again.  The dwarf had listened with eager attention, but several minutes passed before he spoke.  \"A strange dream,\" he said, \"but the interpretation as to the future is not hard to find.  Nefert is striving to reach thee, she longs to be thine, but if thou dost fancy that she is already in thy grasp she will elude thee; thy hopes will melt like ice, slip away like sand, if thou dost not know how to put the crocodile out of the way.\"  At this moment the boat struck the landing-place.  The pioneer started up, and cried, \"We have reached the end!\"  \"We have reached the end,\" echoed the little man with meaning.  \"There is only a narrow bridge to step over.\"  When they both stood on the shore, the dwarf said,  \"I  have  to  thank  thee  for  thy  hospitality,  and when I can serve thee command me.\"  \"Come here,\" cried the pioneer, and drew Nemu away with him under the shade of a sycamore veiled in the half light of the departing sun.  \"What do you mean by a bridge which we must step over?  I do not understand the flowers of speech, and desire plain language.\"  The dwarf reflected for a moment; and then asked, \"Shall I say nakedly and openly what I mean, and will you not be angry?\"  \"Speak!\"  \"Mena is the crocodile.  Put him out of the world, and you will have passed the bridge; then Nefert will be thine--if thou wilt listen to me.\"  \"What shall I do?\"  \"Put the charioteer out of the world.\"  Paaker's gesture seemed to convey that that was a thing that had long been decided on, and he turned his face, for a good omen, so that the rising moon should be on his right hand.  The dwarf went on.  \"Secure Nefert, so that she may not vanish like her image in the dream, before you reach the goal; that is to say, ransom the honor of your future mother and wife, for how could you take an outcast into your house?\"  Paaker looked thoughtfully at the ground.  \"May I inform my mistress that thou wilt save her?\"  asked Nemu. \"I may?--Then all will be well, for he who will devote a fortune to love will not hesitate to devote a reed lance with a brass point to it to his love and his hatred together.\"     CHAPTER XVI.  The sun had set, and darkness covered the City of the Dead, but the moon shone above the valley of the kings' tombs, and the projecting masses of the rocky walls of the chasm threw sharply-defined shadows.  A weird silence lay upon the desert, where yet far more life was stirring than in the noonday hour, for now bats darted like black silken threads through the night air, owls hovered aloft on wide-spread wings, small troops of jackals slipped by, one following the other up the mountain slopes.  From time to time their hideous yell, or the whining laugh of the hyena, broke the stillness of the night.  Nor was human life yet at rest in the valley of tombs.  A faint light glimmered in the cave of the sorceress Hekt, and in front of the paraschites' but a fire was burning, which the grandmother of the sick Uarda now and then fed with pieces of dry manure.  Two men were seated in front of the hut, and gazed in silence on the thin flame, whose impure light was almost quenched by the clearer glow of the moon; whilst the third, Uarda's father, disembowelled a large ram, whose head he had already cut off.  \"How the jackals howl!\"  said the old paraschites, drawing as he spoke the torn brown cotton cloth, which he had put on as a protection against the night air and the dew, closer round his bare shoulders.  \"They scent the fresh meat,\" answered the physician, Nebsecht.  \"Throw them the entrails, when you have done; the legs and back you can roast. Be careful how you cut out the heart--the heart, soldier.  There it is! What a great beast.\"  Nebsecht took the ram's heart in his hand, and gazed at it with the deepest attention, whilst the old paraschites watched him anxiously.  At length:  \"I promised,\" he said, \"to do for you what you wish, if you restore the little one to health; but you ask for what is impossible.\"  \"Impossible?\"  said the physician, \"why, impossible?  You open the corpses, you go in and out of the house of the embalmer.  Get possession of one of the canopi,       [Vases of clay, limestone, or alabaster, which were used for the      preservation of the intestines of the embalmed Egyptians, and      represented the four genii of death, Amset, Hapi, Tuamutef, and      Khebsennuf.  Instead of the cover, the head of the genius to which      it was dedicated, was placed on each kanopus.  Amset (tinder the      protection of Isis) has a human head, Hapi (protected by Nephthys)      an ape's head, Tuamutef (protected by Neith) a jackal's head, and      Khebsennuf (protected by Selk) a sparrow-hawk's head.  In one of the      Christian Coptic Manuscripts, the four archangels are invoked in the      place of these genii.]  lay this heart in it, and take out in its stead the heart of a human being.  No one--no one will notice it.  Nor need you do it to-morrow, or the day after tomorrow even.  Your son can buy a ram to kill every day with my money till the right moment comes.  Your granddaughter will soon grow strong on a good meat-diet.  Take courage!\"  \"I am not afraid of the danger,\" said the old man, \"but how can I venture to steal from a dead man his life in the other world?  And then--in shame and misery have I lived, and for many a year--no man has numbered them for me--have I obeyed the commandments, that I may be found righteous in that world to come, and in the fields of Aalu, and in the Sun-bark find compensation for all that I have suffered here.  You are good and friendly.  Why, for the sake of a whim, should you sacrifice the future bliss of a man, who in all his long life has never known happiness, and who has never done you any harm?\"  \"What I want with the heart,\" replied the physician, \"you cannot understand, but in procuring it for me, you will be furthering a great and useful"]]]
