Still I have not lived in vain.  For forty years I have been the careful father and benefactor of a great nation.  Children and children's children will speak of Amasis as a great, wise and humane king; they will read my name on the great works which I have built in Sais and Thebes, and will praise the greatness of my power.  Neither shall I be condemned by Osiris and the forty-two judges of the nether world; the goddess of truth, who holds the balances, will find that my good deeds outweigh my bad.\"--Here the king sighed deeply and remained silent for some time.  Then, looking tenderly at his wife, he said: \"Ladice, thou hast been a faithful, virtuous wife to me. For this I thank thee, and ask thy forgiveness for much.  We have often misunderstood one another.  Indeed it was easier for me to accustom myself to the Greek modes of thought, than for a Greek to understand our Egyptian ideas.  Thou know'st my love of Greek art,--thou know'st how I enjoyed the society of thy friend Pythagoras, who was thoroughly initiated in all that we believe and know, and adopted much from us.  He comprehended the deep wisdom which lies in the doctrines that I reverence most, and he took care not to speak lightly of truths which our priests are perhaps too careful to hide from the people; for though the many bow down before that which they cannot understand, they would be raised and upheld by those very truths, if explained to them.  To a Greek mind our worship of animals presents the greatest difficulty, but to my own the worship of the Creator in his creatures seems more just and more worthy of a human being, than the worship of his likeness in stone.  The Greek deities are moreover subject to every human infirmity; indeed I should have made my queen very unhappy by living in the same manner as her great god Zeus.\"  At these words the king smiled, and then went on: \"And what has given rise to this?  The Hellenic love of beauty in form, which, in the eye of a Greek, is superior to every thing else.  He cannot separate the body from the soul, because he holds it to be the most glorious of formed things, and indeed, believes that a beautiful spirit must necessarily inhabit a beautiful body.  Their gods, therefore, are only elevated human beings, but we adore an unseen power working in nature and in ourselves. The animal takes its place between ourselves and nature; its actions are guided, not, like our own, by the letter, but by the eternal laws of nature,  which owe their origin to the Deity, while the letter is a device of man's own mind.  And then, too, where amongst ourselves do we find so earnest a longing and endeavor to gain freedom, the highest good, as among the animals?  Where such a regular and well-balanced life from generation to generation, without instruction or precept?\"  Here the king's voice failed.  He was obliged to pause for a few moments, and then continued: \"I know that my end is near; therefore enough of these matters.  My son and successor, hear my last wishes and act upon them; they are the result of experience.  But alas! how often have I seen, that rules of life given by one man to another are useless.  Every man must earn his own experience.  His own losses make him prudent, his own learning wise.  Thou, my son, art coming to the throne at a mature age; thou hast had time and opportunity to judge between right and wrong, to note what is beneficial and what hurtful, to see and compare many things.  I give thee, therefore, only a few wholesome counsels, and only fear that though I offer them with my right hand, thou wilt accept them with the left.  \"First, however, I must say that, notwithstanding my blindness, my indifference to what has been going on during the past months has been only apparent.  I left you to your own devices with a good intention. Rhodopis told me once one of her teacher AEsop's fables: 'A traveller, meeting a man on his road, asked him how long it would be before he reached the nearest town.'  'Go on, go on,' cried the other.  'But I want to know first when I shall get to the town.'  'Go on, only go on,' was the answer.  The traveller left him with angry words and abuse; but he had not gone many steps when the man called after him: 'You will be there in an hour.  I could not answer your question until I had seen your pace.'  \"I bore this fable in my mind for my son's sake, and watched in silence at what pace he was ruling his people.  Now I have discovered what I wish to know, and this is my advice: Examine into everything your self.  It is the duty of every man, but especially of a king, to acquaint himself intimately with all that concerns the weal or woe of his people.  You, my son, are in the habit of using the eyes and ears of other men instead of going to the fountain-head yourself.  I am sure that your advisers, the priests, only desire what is good; but .  .  .  Neithotep, I must beg you to leave us alone for a few moments.\"  When the priest was gone the king exclaimed \"They wish for what is good, but good only for themselves.  But we are not kings of priests and aristocrats only, we are kings of a nation!  Do not listen to the advice of this proud caste alone, but read every petition yourself, and, by appointing Nomarchs devoted to the king and beloved by the people, make yourself acquainted with the needs and wishes of the Egyptian nation.  It is not difficult to govern well, if you are aware of the state of feeling in your land.  Choose fit men to fill the offices of state.  I have taken care that the kingdom shall be properly divided.  The laws are good, and have proved themselves so; hold fast by these laws, and trust no one who sets himself above them; for law is invariably wiser than the individual man, and its transgressor deserves his punishment.  The people understand this well, and are ready to sacrifice themselves for us, when they see that we are ready to give up our own will to the law.  You do not care for the people.  I know their voice is often rude and rough, but it utters wholesome truths, and no one needs to hear truth more than a king. The Pharaoh who chooses priests and courtiers for his advisers, will hear plenty of flattering words, while he who tries to fulfil the wishes of the nation will have much to suffer from those around him; but the latter will feel peace in his own heart, and be praised in the ages to come.  I have often erred, yet the Egyptians will weep for me, as one who knew their needs and considered their welfare like a father.  A king who really knows his duties, finds it an easy and beautiful task to win the love of the people--an unthankful one to gain the applause of the great-- almost an impossibility to content both.  \"Do not forget,--I say it again,--that kings and priests exist for the people, and not the people for their kings and priests.  Honor religion for its own sake and as the most important means of securing the obedience of the governed to their governors; but at the same time show its promulgators that you look on them, not as receptacles, but as servants, of the Deity.  Hold fast, as the law commands, by what is old; but never shut the gates of your kingdom against what is new, if better. Bad men break at once with the old traditions; fools only care for what is new and fresh; the narrowminded and the selfish privileged class cling indiscriminately to all that is old, and pronounce progress to be a sin; but the wise endeavor to retain all that has approved itself in the past, to remove all that has become defective, and to adopt whatever is good, from whatever source it may have sprung.  Act thus, my son.  The priests will try to keep you back--the Greeks to urge you forward.  Choose one party or the other, but beware of indecision--of yielding to the one to-day, to the other to-morrow.  Between two stools a man falls to the ground.  Let the one party be your friends, the other your enemies; by trying to please both, you will have both opposed to you.  Human beings hate the man who shows kindness to their enemies.  In the last few months, during which you have ruled independently, both parties have been offended by your miserable indecision.  The man who runs backwards and forwards like a child, makes no progress, and is soon weary.  I have till now--till I felt that death was near--always encouraged the Greeks and opposed the priests.  In the active business of life, the clever, brave Greeks seemed to me especially serviceable; at death, I want men who can make me out a pass into the nether regions.  The gods forgive me for not being able to resist words that sound so like a joke, even in my last hour!  They created me and must take me as I am.  I rubbed my hands for joy when I became king; with thee, my son, coming to the throne is a graver matter.--Now call Neithotep back; I have still something to say to you both.\"  The king gave his hand to the high-priest as he entered, saving: \"I leave you, Neithotep, without ill-will, though my opinion that you have been a better priest than a servant to your king, remains unaltered.  Psamtik will probably prove a more obedient follower than I have been, but one thing I wish to impress earnestly on you both: Do not dismiss the Greek mercenaries until the war with the Persians is over, and has ended we will hope--in victory for Egypt.  My former predictions are not worth anything now; when death draws near, we get depressed, and things begin to look a little black.  Without the auxiliary troops we shall be hopelessly lost, but with them victory is not impossible.  Be clever; show the Ionians that they are fighting on the Nile for the freedom of their own country--that Cambyses, if victorious, will not be contented with Egypt alone, while his defeat may bring freedom to their own enslaved countrymen in Ionia.  I know you agree with me, Neithotep, for in your heart you "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5459"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 10 (#1)"],["body","with the waves, and looking like eyes in the water.  Not a sound could be heard from either shore.  The echoes were carried away by the north-wind, and the measured stroke of the oars and monotonous song of the rowers were the only sounds that broke the stillness of this strange night--a night robbed of its darkness.  For a long time the friends gazed without speaking at the wonderful sight, which seemed to glide past them.  Zopyrus was the first to break the silence by saying, as he drew a long breath: \"I really envy you, Bartja.  If things were as they should be, every one of us would have his dearest wife at his side on such a night as this.\"  \"And who forbade you to bring one of your wives?\"  answered the happy husband.  \"The other five,\" said the youth with a sigh.  \"If I had allowed Oroetes' little daughter Parysatis, my youngest favorite, to come out alone with me to-night, this wonderful sight would have been my last; tomorrow there would have been one pair of eyes less in the world.\"  Bartja took Sappho's hand and held it fast, saying, \"I fancy one wife will content me as long as I live.\"  The young mother pressed his hand warmly again, and said, turning to Zopyrus: \"I don't quite trust you, my friend.  It seems to me that it is not the anger of your wives you fear, so much as the commission of an offence against the customs of your country.  I have been told that my poor Bartja gets terribly scolded in the women's apartments for not setting eunuchs to watch over me, and for letting me share his pleasures.\"  \"He does spoil you terribly,\" answered Zopyrus, \"and our wives are beginning to quote him as an example of kindness and indulgence, whenever we try to hold the reins a little tight.  Indeed there will soon be a regular women's mutiny at the king's gate, and the Achaemenidae who escaped the swords and arrows of the Egyptians, will fall victims to sharp tongues and floods of salt tears.\"  \"Oh! you most impolite Persian!\"  said Syloson laughing.  \"We must make you more respectful to these images of Aphrodite.\"  \"You Greeks! that's a good idea,\" answered the youth.  \"By Mithras, our wives are quite as well off as yours.  It's only the Egyptian women, that are so wonderfully free.\"  \"Yes, you are quite right,\" said Rhodopis.  \"The inhabitants of this strange land have for thousands of years granted our weaker sex the same rights, that they demand for themselves.  Indeed, in many respects, they have given us the preference.  For instance, by the Egyptian law it is the daughters, not the sons, who are commanded to foster and provide for their aged parents, showing how well the fathers of this now humbled people understood women's nature, and how rightly they acknowledged that she far surpasses man in thoughtful solicitude and self-forgetful love. Do not laugh at these worshippers of animals.  I confess that I cannot understand them, but I feel true admiration for a people in the teaching of whose priests, even Pythagoras, that great master in the art of knowledge, assured me lies a wisdom as mighty as the Pyramids.\"  \"And your great master was right,\" exclaimed Darius.  \"You know that I obtained Neithotep's freedom, and, for some weeks past, have seen him and Onuphis very constantly, indeed they have been teaching me.  And oh, how much I have learnt already from those two old men, of which I had no idea before!  How much that is sad I can forget, when I am listening to them! They are acquainted with the entire history of the heavens and the earth. They know the name of every king, and the circumstances of every important event that has occurred during the last four thousand years, the courses of the stars, the works of their own artists and sayings of their sages, during the same immense period of time.  All this knowledge is recorded in huge books, which have been preserved in a palace at Thebes, called the \"place of healing for the soul.  Their laws are a fountain of pure wisdom, and a comprehensive intellect has been shown in the adaptation of all their state institutions to the needs of the country.  I wish we could boast of the same regularity and order at home. The idea that lies at the root of all their knowledge is the use of numbers, the only means by which it is possible to calculate the course of the stars, to ascertain and determine the limits of all that exists, and, by the application of which in the shortening and lengthening of the strings of musical instruments, tones can be regulated.       [We agree with Iamblichus in supposing, that these Pythagorean views      were derived from the Egyptian mysteries.]  \"Numbers are the only certain things; they can neither be controlled nor perverted.  Every nation has its own ideas of right and wrong; every law can be rendered invalid by circumstances; but the results obtained from numbers can never be overthrown.  Who can dispute, for instance, that twice two make four?  Numbers determine the contents of every existing thing; whatever is, is equal to its contents, numbers therefore are the true being, the essence of all that is.\"  \"In the name of Mithras, Darius, do leave off talking in that style, unless you want to turn my brain,\" interrupted Zopyrus.  \"Why, to hear you, one would fancy you'd been spending your life among these old Egyptian speculators and had never had a sword in your hand.  What on earth have we to do with numbers?\"  \"More  than  you fancy,\" answered  Rhodopis.  \"This theory of numbers belongs to the mysteries of the Egyptian priests, and Pythagoras learnt it from the very Onuphis who is now teaching you, Darius.  If you will come to see me soon, I will show you how wonderfully that great Samian brought the laws of numbers and of the harmonies into agreement.  But look, there are the Pyramids!\"  The whole party rose at these words, and stood speechless, gazing at the grand sight which opened before them.  The Pyramids lay on the left bank of the Nile, in the silver moonshine, massive and awful, as if bruising the earth beneath them with their weight; the giant graves of mighty rulers.  They seemed examples of man's creative power, and at the same time warnings of the vanity and mutability of earthly greatness.  For where was Chufu now,--the king who had cemented that mountain of stone with the sweat of his subjects? Where was the long-lived Chafra who had despised the gods, and, defiant in the consciousness of his own strength, was said to have closed the gates of the temples in order to make himself and his name immortal by building a tomb of superhuman dimensions?       [Herodotus repeats, in good faith, that the builders of the great      Pyramids were despisers of the gods.  The tombs of their faithful      subjects at the foot of these huge structures prove, however, that      they owe their bad repute to the hatred of the people, who could not      forget the era of their hardest bondage, and branded the memories of      their oppressors wherever an opportunity could be found.  We might      use the word \"tradition\" instead of \"the people,\" for this it is      which puts the feeling and tone of mind of the multitude into the      form of history.]  Their empty sarcophagi are perhaps tokens, that the judges of the dead found them unworthy of rest in the grave, unworthy of the resurrection, whereas the builder of the third and most beautiful pyramid, Menkera, who contented himself with a smaller monument, and reopened the gates of the temples, was allowed to rest in peace in his coffin of blue basalt.  There they lay in the quiet night, these mighty pyramids, shone on by the bright stars, guarded by the watchman of the desert--the gigantic sphinx,--and overlooking the barren rocks of the Libyan stony mountains. At their feet, in beautifully-ornamented tombs, slept the mummies of their faithful subjects, and opposite the monument of the pious Menkera stood a temple, where prayers were said by the priests for the souls of the many dead buried in the great Memphian city of the dead.  In the west, where the sun went down behind the Libyan mountains, where the fruitful land ended and the desert began--there the people of Memphis had buried their dead; and as our gay party looked towards the west they felt awed into a solemn silence.  But their boat sped on before the north-wind; they left the city of the dead behind them and passed the enormous dikes built to protect the city of Menes from the violence of the floods; the city of the Pharaohs came in sight, dazzlingly bright with the myriads of flames which had been kindled in honor of the goddess Neith, and when at last the gigantic temple of Ptah appeared, the most ancient building of the most ancient land, the spell broke, their tongues were loosed, and they burst out into loud exclamations of delight.  It was illuminated by thousands of lamps; a hundred fires burnt on its Pylons, its battlemented walls and roofs.  Burning torches flared between the rows of sphinxes which connected the various gates with the main building, and the now empty house of the god Apis was so surrounded by colored fires that it gleamed like a white limestone rock in a tropical sunset.  Pennons, flags and garlands waved above the brilliant picture; music and loud songs could be heard from below.  \"Glorious,\" cried Rhodopis in enthusiasm, \"glorious!  Look how the painted walls and columns gleam in the light, and what marvellous figures the shadows of the obelisks and sphinxes throw on the smooth yellow pavement!\"  \"And how mysterious the sacred grove looks yonder!\"  added Croesus.  \"I never saw anything so wonderful before.\"  \"I have seen something more wonderful still,\" said Darius.  \"You will hardly believe me when I tell you that I have witnessed a celebration of the mysteries of Neith.\"  \"Tell us what you saw, tell us!\"  was the universal outcry.  \"At first Neithotep refused me admission, but when I promised to remain hidden, and besides, to obtain the freedom of his child, he led me up"]]]
