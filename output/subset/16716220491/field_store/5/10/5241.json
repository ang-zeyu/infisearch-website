Despite regulations he could still see better without his spectacles.  \"It is how you arranged it, Master. But as you know we are now ninety and one.\"  The captain put his glasses back on. \"I'll test you. Why are you now ninety and one?\"  \"Naturally,\" the Leader said emotionlessly, \"you required a whole shelter unit to yourself. We had to dispose of the ten who previously had the unit.\"  Barnhart swallowed. \"Couldn't you think of anything less drastic? Next time just build a new unit.\"  \"But master,\" the alien protested, \"it takes a great deal of work to construct our units. Our lumber escapes so badly no matter how often we beat it into submission. Our work capacity is limited, as you are aware. Is it really desirable to overwork us so much?\"  The captain was a little shocked. Was this humorless, methodical android really protesting a command from his Master? \"How do you suppose the ten you are putting in status feel about it?\" he managed.  \"They would doubtlessly prefer not to be overworked. Our fatigue channels can only stand so much.\"  But it wasn't the work, Barnhart suddenly knew. It was the idea that there could be _eleven_ houses, instead of ten. The concept of only ninety quronos and a master must be only slightly less hideous to them. They couldn't really be so overjoyed to see him.  A third rocket jarred off, rising unsteadily but surely in the low gravity. It was a fairly primitive device--evidently all they retained from the original model supplied them by the Master.  Barnhart looked at the figures on the ground. Only seven.  \"The ones in status go into the rockets!\" Barnhart gasped.  \"And circle in the proper orbits,\" the Leader agreed.  This time he saw the quronos lifting a stiff form and taking it to the crude rocket. It looked entirely too much like a human body. Barnhart looked away.  But at the edge of his peripheral vision he saw the quronos halt and stand up their fellow in status. He glanced at his wrist. Fifteen hundred hours. The aliens began geoplancting.  Barnhart ran his tongue over his teeth, noting that they needed brushing. He came to himself with a start.  Of course. He had almost forgot.  Barnhart faced the others and joined them in geoplancting.  A hideous cry built from one plateau of fury to another.  \"_He's no better than us!_\" the Leader screamed.      _Ninth day_      I have made a serious mistake.      While it was necessary for me to conform to the quronos' ritual to     get myself recognized, I should not have continued to adhere to it.     Apparently by these creatures' warped reasoning I established     myself as a reasoning creature by first joining them in their     routine; but when I continued to act in accord with them I proved     myself no better than they are. As Master I am supposed to be     superior and above their mundane routine.      At the moment they are milling belligerently outside my force-field     screen. As I look into their stupid, imaginationless faces I can     only think that somewhere in the past they were invented by some     unorthodox Terran scientist, probably of English descent. They--      Wait.      The force field. It's wavering. It must have been damaged when it     got  tramped underfoot. They are going to get in to me. It--  Barnhart watched them prepare the rocket that would blast him into an orbit circling the planet. He could see and even hear the sound that vibrated through the thin membrane in which he was encased, but he could not move a nerve-end. Fortunately his eyes were focused on infinity, so he could see everything at least blurrily.  The Leader, who seemed to have grown a few inches, wasted no time. He gave the orders and the quronos lifted him into the rocket. The hatch closed down on the indigo day and he was alone.  The blast of takeoff almost deafened him but he didn't feel the jar--only because, he realized, he could feel nothing.  A few weeks later the centrifugal force of the spinning rocket finally nudged the latch and the hatch swung open. Barnhart was exposed to naked fire-bright blackness itself.  After a day or two he stopped worrying about that, as he had stopped fretting about breathing.  He grew accustomed to the regular turn around the planet every fourteen hours. For two out of every three seconds he faced out into space and that was always changing. Yet, all poetry aside, the change was always the same.  He didn't have to worry about keeping on a schedule. He kept on one automatically.  And he didn't like it.  So he kept retreating further and further from it....         *       *       *       *       *  \"We couldn't leave him there!\"  What? Who? Barnhart thought along with at least seven other double-yous. He returned to himself and found that he was standing in the airlock of a spaceship, faced by his first mate Simmons and his stooge York.  \"We couldn't leave him there,\" Simmons repeated with feeling. \"That would be the nastiest kind of murder. We might maroon him. But none of us are killers.\"  \"It's not the punishment we will get for the mutiny,\" York complained. \"It's having to go back to his old routine. That time-schedule mind of his was derailing mine. He was driving the whole crew cockeyed. Even if he wasn't going to kill us all by the rule book, I think we would have had to maroon him just to get rid of him.\"  Simmons fingered a thin-bladed tool knife. \"I wonder how he got up there in that rocket and in this transparent shroud? I'm sure he's alive, but this is the most unorthodox Susp-An I've ever seen. Almost makes you believe in destiny, the way we lost our coordinate settings and had to back-track--and then found him out there. (\"I'll bet he jimmied the calculator,\" York grouched.) You know, York, it's almost as if the world down there marooned him right back at us.\"  The first mate inserted the knife blade. The membrane withered and Barnhart lived.  \"Now the arrest,\" York murmured.  \"What are you muttering about, York?\" Captain Barnhart demanded. \"What are we standing around here for? You can't expect me to waste a whole afternoon on inspection. We have to get back on schedule.\" He looked to his wrist. \"Fifteen hundred hours.\"  \"He doesn't _remember_,\" York said behind him.  \"He remembers the same old routine,\" Simmons said. \"Here we go again.\"  Barnhart didn't say anything. In the close confines of a spaceship there was bound to be a certain degree of informality.  He stepped inside his cabin at the end of the corridor and did what he always did at fifteen hundred hours.  York and the first mate were deeply disturbed.  Barnhart looked out at them sharply. \"Well, spacemen, I run a taut ship here. I expect everyone to hit the mark. Adhere to the line. Follow my example. Snap to it!\"  Simmons looked at York and his shoulders sagged. They couldn't go through the whole thing again, the marooning, the rescue, then this. That routine would drive them crazy.  Even this was preferable.  They joined Barnhart in geoplancting."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5164"],["title","The Beetle: A Mystery (#1)"],["body","what was the next thing I could do. It was only because I feared that if I attempted to spend the night in the open air, without food, when the morning came I should be broken up, and fit for nothing, that I sought a night’s free board and lodging. It was really hunger which drove me to the workhouse door. That was Wednesday. Since the Sunday night preceding nothing had passed my lips save water from the public fountains,--with the exception of a crust of bread which a man had given me whom I had found crouching at the root of a tree in Holland Park. For three days I had been fasting,--practically all the time upon my feet. It seemed to me that if I had to go hungry till the morning I should collapse--there would be an end. Yet, in that strange and inhospitable place, where was I to get food at that time of night, and how?  I do not know how far I went. Every yard I covered, my feet dragged more. I was dead beat, inside and out. I had neither strength nor courage left. And within there was that frightful craving, which was as though it shrieked aloud. I leant against some palings, dazed and giddy. If only death had come upon me quickly, painlessly, how true a friend I should have thought it! It was the agony of dying inch by inch which was so hard to bear.  It was some minutes before I could collect myself sufficiently to withdraw from the support of the railings, and to start afresh. I stumbled blindly over the uneven road. Once, like a drunken man, I lurched forward, and fell upon my knees. Such was my backboneless state that for some seconds I remained where I was, half disposed to let things slide, accept the good the gods had sent me, and make a night of it just there. A long night, I fancy, it would have been, stretching from time unto eternity.  Having regained my feet, I had gone perhaps another couple of hundred yards along the road--Heaven knows that it seemed to me just then a couple of miles!--when there came over me again that overpowering giddiness which, I take it, was born of my agony of hunger. I staggered, helplessly, against a low wall which, just there, was at the side of the path. Without it I should have fallen in a heap. The attack appeared to last for hours; I suppose it was only seconds; and, when I came to myself, it was as though I had been aroused from a swoon of sleep,--aroused, to an extremity of pain. I exclaimed aloud,  ‘For a loaf of bread what wouldn’t I do!’  I looked about me, in a kind of frenzy. As I did so I for the first time became conscious that behind me was a house. It was not a large one. It was one of those so-called villas which are springing up in multitudes all round London, and which are let at rentals of from twenty-five to forty pounds a year. It was detached. So far as I could see, in the imperfect light, there was not another building within twenty or thirty yards of either side of it. It was in two storeys. There were three windows in the upper storey. Behind each the blinds were closely drawn. The hall door was on my right. It was approached by a little wooden gate.  The house itself was so close to the public road that by leaning over the wall I could have touched either of the windows on the lower floor. There were two of them. One of them was a bow window. The bow window was open. The bottom centre sash was raised about six inches.      CHAPTER II.  INSIDE  I realised, and, so to speak, mentally photographed all the little details of the house in front of which I was standing with what almost amounted to a gleam of preternatural perception. An instant before, the world swam before my eyes. I saw nothing. Now I saw everything, with a clearness which, as it were, was shocking.  Above all, I saw the open window. I stared at it, conscious, as I did so, of a curious catching of the breath. It was so near to me; so very near. I had but to stretch out my hand to thrust it through the aperture. Once inside, my hand would at least be dry. How it rained out there! My scanty clothing was soaked; I was wet to the skin! I was shivering. And, each second, it seemed to rain still faster. My teeth were chattering. The damp was liquefying the very marrow in my bones.  And, inside that open window, it was, it must be, so warm, so dry!  There was not a soul in sight. Not a human being anywhere near. I listened; there was not a sound. I alone was at the mercy of the sodden night. Of all God’s creatures the only one unsheltered from the fountains of Heaven which He had opened. There was not one to see what I might do; not one to care. I need fear no spy.  Perhaps the house was empty; nay, probably. It was my plain duty to knock at the door, rouse the inmates, and call attention to their oversight,--the open window. The least they could do would be to reward me for my pains. But, suppose the place was empty, what would be the use of knocking? It would be to make a useless clatter. Possibly to disturb the neighbourhood, for nothing. And, even if the people were at home, I might go unrewarded. I had learned, in a hard school, the world’s ingratitude. To have caused the window to be closed--the inviting window, the tempting window, the convenient window!--and then to be no better for it after all, but still to be penniless, hopeless, hungry, out in the cold and the rain--better anything than that. In such a situation, too late, I should say to myself that mine had been the conduct of a fool. And I should say it justly too. To be sure.  Leaning over the low wall I found that I could very easily put my hand inside the room. How warm it was in there! I could feel the difference of temperature in my fingertips. Very quietly I stepped right over the wall. There was just room to stand in comfort between the window and the wall. The ground felt to the foot as if it were cemented. Stooping down, I peered through the opening. I could see nothing. It was black as pitch inside. The blind was drawn right up; it seemed incredible that anyone could be at home, and have gone to bed, leaving the blind up, and the window open. I placed my ear to the crevice. How still it was! Beyond doubt, the place was empty.  I decided to push the window up another inch or two, so as to enable me to reconnoitre. If anyone caught me in the act, then there would be an opportunity to describe the circumstances, and to explain how I was just on the point of giving the alarm. Only, I must go carefully. In such damp weather it was probable that the sash would creak.  Not a bit of it. It moved as readily and as noiselessly as if it had been oiled. This silence of the sash so emboldened me that I raised it more than I intended. In fact, as far as it would go. Not by a sound did it betray me. Bending over the sill I put my head and half my body into the room. But I was no forwarder. I could see nothing. Not a thing. For all I could tell the room might be unfurnished. Indeed, the likelihood of such an explanation began to occur to me. I might have chanced upon an empty house. In the darkness there was nothing to suggest the contrary. What was I to do?  Well, if the house was empty, in such a plight as mine I might be said to have a moral, if not a legal, right, to its bare shelter. Who, with a heart in his bosom, would deny it me? Hardly the most punctilious landlord. Raising myself by means of the sill I slipped my legs into the room.  The moment I did so I became conscious that, at any rate, the room was not entirely unfurnished. The floor was carpeted. I have had my feet on some good carpets in my time; I know what carpets are; but never did I stand upon a softer one than that. It reminded me, somehow, even then, of the turf in Richmond Park,--it caressed my instep, and sprang beneath my tread. To my poor, travel-worn feet, it was luxury after the puddly, uneven road. Should I, now I had ascertained that the room was, at least, partially furnished, beat a retreat? Or should I push my researches further? It would have been rapture to have thrown off my clothes, and to have sunk down, on the carpet, then and there, to sleep. But,--I was so hungry, so famine-goaded; what would I not have given to have lighted on something good to eat!  I moved a step or two forward, gingerly, reaching out with my hands, lest I struck, unawares, against some unseen thing. When I had taken three or four such steps, without encountering an obstacle, or, indeed, anything at all, I began, all at once, to wish I had not seen the house; that I had passed it by; that I had not come through the window; that I were safely out of it again. I became, on a sudden, aware, that something was with me in the room. There was nothing, ostensible, to lead me to such a conviction; it may be that my faculties were unnaturally keen; but, all at once, I knew that there was something there. What was more, I had a horrible persuasion that, though unseeing, I was seen; that my every movement was being watched.  What it was that was with me I could not tell; I could not even guess. It was as though something in my mental organisation had been stricken by a sudden paralysis. It may seem childish to use such language; but I was overwrought, played out; physically speaking, at my last counter; and, in an instant, without the slightest warning, I was conscious of a very curious sensation, the like of which I had never felt before, and the like of which I pray that I never may feel again,--a sensation of panic fear. I remained rooted to the spot on which I stood, not daring to move, fearing to draw my breath. I felt that the presence with me in the room was something strange, something evil.  I do not know how long I stood there, spell-bound, but certainly for some considerable space of time. By degrees, as nothing moved, nothing was seen, nothing was heard, and nothing happened, I made an effort to better play the man. I knew that, at the moment, I played the cur. And endeavoured to ask myself of what it was I was afraid. I was shivering at my own"]]]
