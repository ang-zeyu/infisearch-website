They didn't speak for a moment. Then, \"Are you happy, Lois, in your life here?\" he asked.  Her smile was instant. \"Of course. Don't you like my group?\"  He hesitated. \"They make me feel rather no good,\" he said, and then admitted, \"but in a way I'm more attracted to them than any people I've ever met.\"  \"You are?\" Her grip on his hand tightened. \"Then why don't you stay with us for a while? I like you. It's too early to propose anything, but I think you have a quality our group lacks. You could see how you fit in. And there's Joyce. She's just visiting, too. You wouldn't have to lone unless you wanted.\"  Before he could think, there was a rhythmic rush of feet and the Wolvers were around them.  \"We're swimming,\" Simone announced.  Lois looked at Tom inquiringly. He smiled his willingness, started to mention he didn't have trunks, then realized that wouldn't be news here. He wondered whether he would blush.  Jock fell in beside him as they rounded the ranch house. \"Larry's been telling me about your group at the other end of the valley. It's comic, but I've whirled down the valley a dozen times and never spotted any sort of place there. What's it like?\"  \"A ranch house and several cabins.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jock frowned. \"Comic I never saw it.\" His face cleared. \"How about whirling over there? You could point it out to me.\"  \"It's really there,\" Tom said uneasily. \"I'm not making it up.\"  \"Of course,\" Jock assured him. \"It was just an idea.\"  \"We could pick up your camera on the way,\" Lois put in.  The rest of the group had turned back from the huge oval pool and the dark blue and flashing thing beyond it, and stood gay-colored against the pool's pale blue shimmer.  \"How about it?\" Jock asked them. \"A whirl before we bathe?\"  Two or three said yes besides Lois, and Jock led the way toward the helicopter that Tom now saw standing beyond the pool, its beetle body as blue as a scarab, its vanes flashing silver.  The others piled in. Tom followed as casually as he could, trying to suppress the pounding of his heart. \"Wonder you don't go by rocket,\" he remarked lightly.  Jock laughed. \"For such a short trip?\"  The vanes began to thrum. Tom sat stiffly, gripping the sides of the seat, then realized that the others had sunk back lazily in the cushions. There was a moment of strain and they were falling ahead and up. Looking out the side, Tom saw for a moment the sooty roof of the ranch house and the blue of the pool and the pinkish umber of tanned bodies. Then the helicopter lurched gently around. Without warning a miserable uneasiness gripped him, a desire to cling mixed with an urge to escape. He tried to convince himself it was fear of the height.  He heard Lois tell Jock, \"That's the place, down by that rock that looks like a wrecked spaceship.\"  The helicopter began to fall forward. Tom felt Lois' hand on his.  \"You haven't answered my question,\" she said.  \"What?\" he asked dully.  \"Whether you'll stay with us. At least for a while.\"  He looked at her. Her smile was a comfort. He said, \"If I possibly can.\"  \"What could possibly stop you?\"  \"I don't know,\" he answered abstractedly.  \"You're strange,\" Lois told him. \"There's a weight of sadness in you. As if you lived in a less happy age. As if it weren't 2050.\"  \"Twenty?\" he repeated, awakening from his thoughts with a jerk. \"What's the time?\" he asked anxiously.  \"Two,\" Jock said. The word sounded like a knell.  \"You need cheering,\" Lois announced firmly.  Amid a whoosh of air rebounding from earth, they jounced gently down. Lois vaulted out. \"Come on,\" she said.  Tom followed her. \"Where?\" he asked stupidly, looking around at the red rocks through the settling sand cloud stirred by the vanes.  \"Your camera,\" she told him, laughing. \"Over there. Come on, I'll race you.\"  He started to run with her and then his uneasiness got beyond his control. He ran faster and faster. He saw Lois catch her foot on a rock and go down sprawling, but he couldn't stop. He ran desperately around the rock and into a gust of up-whirling sand that terrified him with its suddenness. He tried to escape from the stinging, blinding gust, but there was the nightmarish fright that his wild strides were carrying him nowhere.  Then the sand settled. He stopped running and looked around him. He was standing by the balancing rock. He was gasping. At his feet the rusty brown leather of the camera case peeped from the sand. Lois was nowhere in sight. Neither was the helicopter. The valley seemed different, rawer--one might almost have said younger.  Hours after dark he trailed into Tosker-Brown. Curtained lights still glowed from a few cabins. He was footsore, bewildered, frightened. All afternoon and through the twilight and into the moonlit evening that turned the red rocks black, he had searched the valley. Nowhere had he been able to find the soot-roofed ranch house of the Wolvers. He hadn't even been able to locate the rock like a giant bobbin where he'd met Lois.  During the next days he often returned to the valley. But he never found anything. And he never happened to be near the balancing rock when the time winds blew at ten and two, though once or twice he did see dust devils. Then he went away and eventually forgot.  In his casual reading he ran across popular science articles describing the binary system of numbers used in electronic calculating machines, where one and one make ten. He always skipped them. And more than once he saw the four equations expressing Einstein's generalized theory of gravitation:  [Illustration: Einstein's equation.]  He never connected them with the little girl's chant: \"Gik-lo, I-o, Rik-o, Gis-so.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51102"],["title","The Sentimentalists (#1)"],["body","beamphone operator at Cetopolis. It was a new colony, with not more than five thousand humans on the whole planet, all of them concentrated near the one small town with its plank sidewalks and prefabricated buildings. Lon Simpson met Cathy, and his labors on his _thanar_ farm acquired new energy and purpose.  But he was up against a shrewd organization. His inordinately expensive farm machinery broke down. He repaired it. After a time it could not be repaired any longer and he had to buy more. Before the _thanar_ plants were half grown, he owed more than half his prospective crop for machinery replacements.  Now he could see the method perfectly. The Company imported all machinery. It made that machinery in its own factories, machinery that was designed to break down. So this year--even if nothing else happened--Lon would wind up owing more for machinery replacements than the crop would bring.  It was not likely that nothing else would happen. Next season he would start off in debt, instead of all clear, and if the same thing happened he would owe all his crop and be six thousand credits behind. By harvest after next, his farm and house could be foreclosed for debt and he could either try to work for other colonists--who were in the process of going through the same wringer themselves--or hire out as a farmhand on the Company's plantation. He would never be able to save space-fare away from the planet. He would be very much worse off than the assisted emigrants to other planets, who had not invested all they owned in land and machinery and agricultural instructions.  And there was Cathy. She owed for her passage. It would be years before she could pay that back, if ever. She couldn't live in the farmhand barracks. They might as well give up thinking about each other.  It was a system. Beautifully legal, absolutely airtight. Not a thing wrong with it. The Company had a monopoly on _thanar_, despite the law. It had all the cultivated land on Cetis Gamma Two under its control, and its labor problem was solved. Its laborers first paid something like sixteen thousand credits a head for the privilege of trying to farm independently for a year or two, and then became farmhands for the Company at a bare subsistence wage.  Lon Simpson was in the grip of that system. He had taken the generator apart and put it back together eighteen times. There was nothing visibly wrong with it. It had been designed to break down with nothing visibly wrong with it. If he couldn't repair it, though, he was out fifteen hundred credits, his investment was wiped out, and all his hopes were gone.  He took the generator apart for the nineteenth time. He wondered grimly how the Company's designers made generators so cleverly that they would stop working so that even the trouble with them couldn't be figured out. It was a very ingenious system.         *       *       *       *       *  Out on the ninth planet, Rhadampsicus explained the situation to his bride as they waited for the interesting astronomical phenomenon. They were quite cosy, waiting. Their bower was simple, of course. Frozen nitrogen walls, and windows of the faint bluish tint of oxygen ice. Rhadampsicus had grown some cyanogen flower-crystals to make the place look homelike, and there was now a lovely reflection-pool in which liquid hydrogen reflected the stars. Cetis Gamma, the local sun, seemed hardly more than a very bright and very near star--it was four light-hours away--and it glimmered over the landscape and made everything quite charming.  Nodalictha, naturally, would not enter the minds of the male bipeds on the inner planet. Modesty forbade such a thing--as, of course, the conscientiousness of a brand-new husband limited Rhadampsicus to the thoughts of the males among the bipeds. But Nodalictha was distressed when Rhadampsicus told her of what was occurring among the bipeds. He guided her thoughts to Cathy, in the beamphone exchange at Cetopolis.  \"But it is terrible!\" said Nodalictha in distress when she had absorbed Cathy's maiden meditations. She did not actually speak in words and soundwaves. There is no air worth mentioning at seven degrees Kelvin. It's all frozen. A little helium hangs around, perhaps. Nothing else. The word for communication is not exactly the word for speech, but it will do. Nodalictha said, \"They love each other! In a cute way, they are like--like we were, Rhadampsicus!\"  Rhadampsicus played a positron-beam on her in feigned indignation. If that beam had hit a human, the human would have curled up in a scorched, smoking heap. But Nodalictha bridled.  \"Rhadampsicus!\" she protested fondly. \"Stop tickling me! But can't you do something for them? They are so cute!\"  And Rhadampsicus gallantly sent his thoughts back to the second planet, where a biped grimly labored over a primitive device.         *       *       *       *       *  Lon Simpson, staring at the disassembled generator, suddenly blinked. The grimness went out of his expression. He stared. An idea had occurred to him. He went over it in his mind. He blew out his breath in a long whistle. Then, very painstakingly, he did four or five things that completely ruined the generator for the extremely modest trade-in allowance he could have gotten for it at the Company store.  He worked absorbedly for perhaps twenty minutes, his eyes intent. At the end of that time he had threads of unwound secondary wire stretched back and forth across a forked stick of _dhil_ weed, and two small pieces of sheet iron twisted together in an extremely improbable manner. He connected the ends of the secondary wire to contacts in his tractor. He climbed into the tractor seat. He threw over the drive control.  The tractor lurched into motion. The Diesel wasn't running. But the tractor rolled comfortably as Lon drove it, the individual motors in the separate catawheels drawing power from a mere maze of wires across a forked stick--plus two pieces of sheet iron. There was plenty of power.  Lon drove the tractor the rest of the morning and all afternoon with a very peculiar expression on his face. He understood what he had done. Now that he had done it, it seemed the most obvious of expedients. He felt inclined to be incredulous that nobody had ever happened to think of this particular device before. But they very plainly hadn't. It was a source of all the electric power anybody could possibly want. The voltage would depend on the number of turns of copper wire around a suitably forked stick. The amperage would be whatever that voltage could put through whatever was hooked to it.  He no longer needed a new generator for his tractor. He had one.  He didn't even need a Diesel.  With adequate power--he'd been having to nurse the Diesel along, too, lately--Lon Simpson ran his tractor late into the twilight. He cultivated all the ground that urgently needed cultivation, and at least one field he hadn't hoped to get to before next week. But his expression was amazed. It is a very peculiar sensation to discover that one is a genius.         *       *       *       *       *  That night, in Cetopolis, he told Cathy all about it. It was a very warm night--an unusually warm night. They walked along the plank sidewalks of the little frontier town--as a new colony, Cetis Gamma Two was a frontier--and Lon talked extravagantly.  He had meant to explain painfully to Cathy that there was no use in their being romantic about each other. He'd expected to have to tell her bitterly that he was doomed to spend the rest of his life adding to the profits of the Cetis Gamma Trading Company, with all the laws of the human race holding him in peonage. He'd thought of some very elegant descriptions of the sort of people who'd worked out the system in force on Cetis Gamma Two.  But he didn't. As they strolled under the shiver trees that lined the small town's highways, and smelled the _chanel_ bushes beyond the town's limits, and listened to the thin violinlike strains of what should have been night birds--they weren't; the singers were furry instead of feathered, and they slept in burrows during the day--as they walked with linked fingers in the warm and starlit night, Lon told Cathy about his invention.  He explained in detail just why wires wound in just that fashion, and combined with bits of sheet iron twisted in just those shapes, would produce power for free and forever. He explained how it had to be so. He marveled that nobody had ever thought of it before. He explained it so that Cathy could almost understand it.  \"It's wonderful!\" she said wistfully. \"They'll run spaceships on your invention, won't they, Lon? And cities? And everything! I guess you'll be very rich for inventing it!\"  He stopped short and stared at her. He hadn't thought that far ahead. Then he said blankly:  \"But I'll have to get back to Earth to patent it! And I haven't got the money to pay one fare, let alone two!\"  \"Two?\" asked Cathy hopefully. \"Why two?\"  \"You're going to marry me, aren't you?\" he demanded. \"I sort of hope that was all settled.\"  Cathy stamped her foot.  \"Hadn't you heard,\" she asked indignantly, \"that such things aren't taken for granted? Especially when two people are walking in the starlight and are supposed to be thrilled? It isn't settled--not until after you've kissed me, anyhow!\"  He remedied his error.         *       *       *       *       *  Out on the ninth planet, very far away, Nodalictha blushed slightly. As a bride, she was in that deliciously embarrassing state of becoming accustomed to discussions which would previously have been unconventional.  \"They are so quaint!\" Then she hesitated and said awkwardly, \"The idea of putting their--their lips together as a sign of affection--\"  Rhadampsicus was amused, as a bridegroom may be by the delightful innocences of a new wife. He evinced his amusement in a manner no human being could conceivably have recognized as the tender laugh it was.  \"Little goose!\" he said fondly. Of"]]]
