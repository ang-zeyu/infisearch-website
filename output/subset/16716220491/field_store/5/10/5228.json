It all started after dinner when he showed up in my room, wagged his finger at me and said, \"Ollie, you've been avoiding me. That hurts. Thought we were pals, thick and thin and till debt and death do us part.\"  I saw immediately that he was drunk--he always gets his words mixed up when he's drunk--and I tried to placate him by explaining that it wasn't anything like that; I'd been busy.  \"If we're pals,\" he said, \"come on and have a beer with me.\"  There was no shaking him off, so I followed him down to his car and we drove to this sleazy little bar in the Negro part of town. As soon as we sat down in a booth, Len borrowed all the nickels I had, put them in the jukebox and pressed the levers for a lot of old Louie Armstrong records.  \"Sorry, kid,\" he said. \"I know how you hate this real jazzy stuff, but can't have a reunion without music, and there isn't a polka or cowboy ballad or hillbilly stomp in the box. They lack the folksy touch on this side of the tracks.\" Len has always been very snobbish about my interest in folk music.  I asked him what he'd been doing during the day.  \"Lushing it up,\" he said. \"Getting stinking from drinking.\" He still likes to use the most flamboyant slang; I consider it an infantile form of protest against what he regards as the \"genteel\" manner of academic people. \"I got sort of restless this morning, so I ducked out and beat it into New York and looked up my friend Steve Lundy in the Village. Spent the afternoon liquidating our joint assets. Liquidating our assets in the joints.\"  What, I wanted to know, was he feeling restless about?  \"Restless for going on three years now.\" His face grew solemn, as though he were thinking it over very carefully. \"I'll amend that statement. Hell with the Aesopian language. I've been a plain lush for going on three years. Ever since--\"  If it was something personal--I suggested.  \"It is _not_ something personal,\" he said, mimicking me. \"Guess I can tell an old cyberneticist pal about it. Been a lush for three years because I've been scared for three years. Been scared for three years because three years ago I saw a machine beat a man at a game of chess.\"  A machine that plays chess? That was interesting, I said.  \"Didn't tell you the whole truth the other day,\" Len mumbled. \"I _did_ work on the Remington-Rand computer, sure, but I didn't come to IFACS directly from that. In between I spent a couple years at the Bell Telephone Labs. Claude Shannon--or, rather, to begin with there was Norbert Wiener back at M.I.T.--it's complicated....\"  \"Look,\" I said, \"are you sure you want to talk about it?\"  \"Stop wearing your loyalty oath on your sleeve,\" he said belligerently. \"Sure I want to talk about it. Greatest subject I know. Begin at the beginning. Whole thing started back in the Thirties with those two refugee mathematicians who used to be here at the Institute for Advanced Studies when Einstein was around. Von Morgan and Neumanstern, no, Von _Neu_mann and _Mor_ganstern. You remember, they did a mathematical analysis of all the possible kinds of games, poker, tossing pennies, chess, bridge, everything, and they wrote up their findings in a volume you certainly know, _The Theory of Games_.  \"Well, that got Wiener started. You may remember that when he founded the science of cybernetics, he announced that on the basis of the theory of games, it was feasible to design a robot computing machine that would play a better than average game of chess. Right after that, back in '49 or maybe it was '50, Claude Shannon of the Bell Labs said Wiener wasn't just talking, and to prove it he was going to _build_ the robot chess player. Which he proceeded withforth--forthwith--to do. Sometime in '53, I was taken off the Remington-Rand project and assigned to Bell to work with him.\"  \"Maybe we ought to start back,\" I cut in. \"I've got a lot of work to do.\"  \"The night is young,\" he said, \"and you're so dutiful. Where was I? Oh yes, Bell. At first our electronic pawn-pusher wasn't so hot--it could beat the pants off a lousy player, but an expert just made it look silly. But we kept improving it, see, building more and more electronic anticipation and gambit-plotting powers into it, and finally, one great day in '55, we thought we had all the kinks ironed out and were ready for the big test. By this time, of course, Washington had stepped in and taken over the whole project.  \"Well, we got hold of Fortunescu, the world's champion chess player, sat him down and turned the robot loose on him. For four hours straight we followed the match, with a delegation of big brass from Washington, and for four hours straight the machine trounced Fortunescu every game. That was when I began to get scared. I went out that night and got really loaded.\"  What had he been so scared about? It seemed to me he should have felt happy.  \"Listen, Ollie,\" he said, \"for Christ's sake, stop talking like a Boy Scout for once in your life.\"  If he was going to insult me--  \"No insult intended. Just listen. I'm a terrible chess player. Any five-year-old could chatemeck--checkmate--me with his brains tied behind his back. But this machine which I built, helped build, is the champion chess player of the world. In other words, my brain has given birth to a brain which can do things my brain could never do. Don't you find that terrifying?\"  \"Not at all,\" I said. \"_You_ made the machine, didn't you? Therefore, no matter what it does, it's only an extension of you. You should feel proud to have devised a powerful new tool.\"  \"Some tool,\" he sneered. He was so drunk by now that I could hardly understand what he was saying. \"The General Staff boys in Washington were all hopped up about that little old tool, and for a plenty good reason--they understood that mechanized warfare is only the most complicated game the human race has invented so far, an elaborate form of chess which uses the population of the world for pawns and the globe for a chessboard. They saw, too, that when the game of war gets this complex, the job of controlling and guiding it becomes too damned involved for any number of human brains, no matter how nimble.  \"In other words, my beamish Boy Scout, modern war needs just this kind of strategy tool; the General Staff has to be mechanized along with everything else. So the Pentagon boys set up IFACS and handed us a top-priority cybernetics project: to build a superduper chess player that could oversee a complicated military maneuver, maybe later a whole campaign, maybe ultimately a whole global war.  \"We're aiming at a military strategy machine which can digest reports from all the units on all the fronts and from moment to moment, on the basis of that steady stream of information, grind out an elastic overall strategy and dictate concrete tactical directives to all the units. Wiener warned this might happen, and he was right. A very nifty tool. Never mind how far we've gotten with the thing, but I will tell you this: I'm a lot more scared today than I was three years ago.\"  So _that_ was the secret of MS! The most extraordinary machine ever devised by the human mind! It was hard to conceal the thrill of excitement I felt, even as a relative outsider.  \"Why all the jitters?\" I said. \"This could be the most wonderful tool ever invented. It might eliminate war altogether.\"  Len was quiet for a while, gulping his beer and looking off into space. Then he turned to me.  \"Steve Lundy has a cute idea,\" he said. \"He was telling me about it this afternoon. He's a bum, you see, but he's got a damned good mind and he's done a lot of reading. Among other things, he's smart enough to see that once you've got your theory of games worked out, there's at least the logical possibility of converting your Eniac into what he calls a Strategy Integrator and Computer. And he's guessed, simply from the Pentagon's hush-hush policy about it, that that's what we're working on here at IFACS. So he holds forth on the subject of Emsiac, and I listen.\"  \"What's his idea?\" I asked.  \"He thinks Emsiac might eliminate war, too, but not in the way a Boy Scout might think. What he says is that all the industrialized nations must be working away like mad on Emsiac, just as they did on the atom bomb, so let's assume that before long all the big countries will have more or less equal MS machines. All right. A cold war gets under way between countries A and B, and pretty soon it reaches the showdown stage. Then both countries plug in their Emsiacs and let them calculate the date on which hostilities should begin. If the machines are equally efficient, they'll hit on the same date. If there's a slight discrepancy, the two countries can work out a compromise date by negotiation.  \"The day arrives. A's Emsiac is set up in its capital, B's is set up in _its_ capital. In each capital the citizens gather around their strategy machine, the officials turn out in high hats and cut-aways, there are speeches, pageants, choral singing, mass dancing--the ritual can be worked out in advance. Then, at an agreed time, the crowds retreat to a safe distance and a committee of the top cyberneticists appears. They climb into planes, take off and--this is beautiful--drop all their atom bombs and H-bombs on the machines. It happens simultaneously in both countries, you see. That's the neat part of it. The occasion is called International Mushroom Day.  \"Then the cyberneticists in both countries go back to their vacuum tubes to work on another Emsiac, and the nuclear physicists go back to their piles to build more atom bombs, and when they're ready they have another Mushroom Day. One Mushroom Day every few years, whenever the diplomatic-strategic situation calls for it, and nobody even fires a B-B gun. Scientific war. Isn't it wonderful?\"         *       *       *       *       *  By the time Len finished this peculiar"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51545"],["title","The Sweeper of Loray (#1)"],["body","why I must refuse you.\"  \"Of course. But it happens, Deg, I am a medicine man in my own country.\"  \"Ah? I did not know this!\"  \"It is so. As a matter of fact, in my particular line, I am the highest medicine man.\"  \"Then you must be a very holy man,\" Deg said, bowing his head.  \"Man, he's holy!\" Fred put in emphatically. \"Holiest man you'll ever see around here.\"  \"Please, Fred,\" Carver said, blinking modestly. He said to the medicine man, \"It's true, although I don't like to hear about it. Under the circumstances, however, you can see that it would not be wrong to give me some sersee juice. On the contrary, it is your priestly duty to give me some.\"  The medicine man pondered for a long time while contrary emotions passed just barely perceptibly over his almost blank face. At last he said, \"It may be so. Unfortunately, I cannot do what you require.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because there is so little sersee juice, so terribly little. There is hardly enough for the village.\"  Deg smiled sadly and walked away.         *       *       *       *       *  Life in the village continued its simple, invariant way. The Sweeper moved slowly along, cleaning with his twig broom. The hunters trekked out in search of srags. The women of the village prepared food and looked after the village's one child. The priests and dancers prayed nightly for the sun to rise in the morning. Everyone was satisfied, in a humble, submissive fashion.  Everyone except the Earthmen.  They had more talks with Deg and slowly learned the complete story of the sersee juice and the troubles surrounding it.  The sersee bush was a small and sickly affair. It did not flourish in a state of nature. Yet it resisted cultivation and positively defied transplantation. The best one could do was to weed thoroughly around it and hope it would blossom. But most sersee bushes struggled for a year or two, then gave up the ghost. A few blossomed, and a few out of the few lived long enough to produce their characteristic red berries.  From the berry of the sersee bush was squeezed the elixir that meant life to the people of Loray.  \"And you must remember,\" Deg pointed out, \"how sparsely the sersee grows and how widely scattered it is. We must search for months, sometimes, to find a single bush with berries. And those berries will save the life of only a single Lorayan, or perhaps two at the most.\"  \"Sad, very sad,\" Carver said. \"But surely some form of intensive fertilization--\"  \"Everything has been tried.\"  \"I realize,\" Carver said earnestly, \"how important the sersee juice is to you. But if you could give us a little--even a pint or two--we could take it to Earth, have it examined, synthesized, perhaps. Then you could have all you need.\"  \"But we dare not give any. Have you noticed how few children we have?\"  Carver nodded.  \"There are very few births. Our life is a constant struggle against the obliteration of our race. Every man's life must be preserved until there is a child to replace him. And this can be done only by our constant and never-ending search for the sersee berries. And there are never enough,\" the medicine man sighed. \"Never enough.\"  \"Does the juice cure _everything_?\" Fred asked.  \"It does more than that. Those who have tasted sersee add fifty of our years to their lives.\"  Carver opened his eyes wide. Fifty years on Loray was roughly the equivalent of sixty-three on Earth.  The sersee was more than a healing agent, more than a regenerator. It was a longevity drug as well.  He paused to consider the prospect of adding another sixty years to his lifetime. Then he asked, \"What happens if a man takes sersee again after the fifty years?\"  \"We do not know,\" Deg told him. \"No man would take it a second time while there is not enough.\"  Carver and Fred exchanged glances.  \"Now listen to me carefully, Deg,\" Professor Carver said. He spoke of the sacred duties of science. Science, he told the medicine man, was above race, above creed, above religion. The advancement of science was above life itself. What did it matter, after all, if a few more Lorayans died? They would die eventually anyhow. The important thing was for Terran science to have a sample of sersee.  \"It may be as you say,\" Deg said. \"But my choice is clear. As a priest of the Sunniheriat religion, I have a sacred trust to preserve the lives of my people. I cannot go against this trust.\"  He turned and walked off. The Earthmen frustratedly returned to their spaceship.         *       *       *       *       *  After coffee, Professor Carver opened a drawer and took out the manuscript of _Underlying Causes for the Implicit Inferiority of Non-Terran Races_. Lovingly he read over the last chapter, the chapter that dealt with the specialized inferiorities of the Lorayan people. Then he put the manuscript away.  \"Almost finished, Fred,\" he told his assistant. \"Another week's work, two weeks at the most!\"  \"Um,\" Fred replied, staring at the village through a porthole.  \"This will do it,\" Carver said. \"This book will prove, once and for all, the natural superiority of Terrans. We have proven it by force of arms, Fred, and we have proven it by our technology. Now it is proven by the impersonal processes of logic.\"  Fred nodded. He knew the professor was quoting from the book's introduction.  \"Nothing must interfere with the great work,\" Carver said. \"You agree with that, don't you?\"  \"Sure,\" Fred said absent-mindedly. \"The book comes first. Put the gooks in their place.\"  \"Well, I didn't exactly mean that. But you know what I mean. Under the circumstances, perhaps we should forget about sersee. Perhaps we should just finish the job we started.\"  Fred turned and faced his employer. \"Professor, how much do you expect to make out of this book?\"  \"Hm? Well, the last did quite well, you will remember. This book should do even better. Ten, perhaps twenty thousand dollars!\" He permitted himself a small smile. \"I am fortunate, you see, in my subject matter. The general public of Earth seems to be rather interested in it, which is gratifying for a scientist.\"  \"Say you even make fifty thousand. Chicken feed! Do you know what we could make on a test tube of sersee?\"  \"A hundred thousand?\" Carver said vaguely.  \"Are you kidding? Suppose a rich guy was dying and we had the only thing to cure him. He'd give everything he owned! Millions!\"  \"I believe you're right,\" Carver agreed. \"And it _would_ be a valuable scientific advancement.... But the medicine man unfortunately won't give us any.\"  \"Buying isn't the only way.\" Fred unholstered his revolver and checked the chambers.  \"I see, I see,\" Carver said, his red face turning slightly pale. \"But have we the right?\"  \"What do _you_ think?\"  \"Well, they _are_ inferior. I believe I have proven that conclusively. You might indeed say that their lives don't weigh heavily in the scheme of things. Hm, yes--yes, Fred, we could save Terran lives with this!\"  \"We could save our own lives,\" Fred said. \"Who wants to punk out ahead of time?\"  Carver stood up and determinedly loosened his gun in its holster. \"Remember,\" he told Fred, \"we are doing this in the name of science, and for Earth.\"  \"Absolutely, Professor,\" Fred said, moving toward the port, grinning.         *       *       *       *       *  They found Deg near the medicine hut. Carver said, without preamble, \"We must have some sersee.\"  \"But I explained to you,\" said the medicine man. \"I told you why it was impossible.\"  \"We gotta have it,\" Fred said. He pulled his revolver from its holster and looked ferociously at Deg.  \"No.\"  \"You think I'm kidding?\" Fred asked. \"You know what this weapon can do?\"  \"I have seen you use it.\"  \"Maybe you think I won't use it on you.\"  \"I do not care. You can have no sersee.\"  \"I'll shoot,\" Fred warned, his voice rising angrily. \"I swear to you, I'll shoot.\"  The villagers of Loray slowly gathered behind their medicine man. Gray-skinned, knobby-headed, they moved silently into position, the hunters carrying their spears, other villagers armed with knives and stones.  \"You cannot have the sersee,\" Deg said.  Fred slowly leveled the revolver.  \"Now, Fred,\" said Carver, \"there's an awful lot of them. Do you really think--\"  Fred's thin body tightened and his finger grew taut and white on the trigger. Carver closed his eyes.  There was a moment of dead silence. Then the revolver exploded. Carver warily opened his eyes.  The medicine man was still erect, although his knees were shaking. Fred was pulling back the hammer of the revolver. The villagers had made no sound. It was a moment before Carver could figure out what had happened. At last he saw the Sweeper.  The Sweeper lay on his face, his outstretched left hand still clutching his twig broom, his legs twitching feebly. Blood welled from the hole Fred had neatly drilled through his forehead.  Deg bent over the Sweeper, then straightened. \"He is dead,\" the medicine man said.  \"That's just the first,\" Fred warned, taking aim at a hunter.  \"No!\" cried Deg.  Fred looked at him with raised eyebrows.  \"I will give it to you,\" Deg said. \"I will give you all our sersee juice. Then you must go!\"  He ran into the medicine hut and reappeared a moment later with three wooden tubes, which he thrust into Fred's hands.  \"We're in business, Professor,\" Fred said. \"Let's get moving!\"  They walked past the silent villagers, toward their spaceship. Something bright flashed in the sunlight. Fred yipped and dropped his revolver. Professor Carver hastily scooped it up.  \"One of those gooks cut me,\" Fred said. \"Give me the revolver!\"  A spear arced high and buried itself at their feet.  \"Too many of them,\" said Carver. \"Let's run for it!\"  They sprinted to their ship with spears and knives singing around them, reached it safely and bolted the port.  \"Too close,\" Carver said, panting for breath, leaning against the dogged port. \"Have you got the serum?\"  \"I got it,\" said Fred, rubbing his arm. \"Damn!\"  \"What's wrong?\"  \"My arm. It feels numb.\"         *       *"]]]
