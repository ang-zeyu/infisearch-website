Wait, I think I take the big one there.\"  \"Harse! Wait a minute!\" Mooney clutched at him. \"Hold everything, man! You can't do that.\"  Harse stared at him. \"Why?\"  \"Because it would upset everything, that's why! You want to get to your rendezvous, don't you? Well, if you do anything like that, we'll _never_ get there!\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Please,\" Mooney said, \"please take my word for it. You hear me? I'll explain later!\"  Harse looked by no means convinced, but he stopped opening the silvery metal case. Mooney kept an eye on him while registering. Harse continued to watch the conventioneers, but he went no further. Mooney began to breathe again.  \"Thank _you_, sir,\" said the desk clerk--not every guest, even in this hotel, went for a corner suite with two baths. \"Front!\"         *       *       *       *       *  A smart-looking bellboy stepped forward, briskly took the key from the clerk, briskly nodded at Mooney and Harse. With the automatic reflex of any hotel bellhop, he reached for Harse's silvery case. Baggage was baggage, however funny it looked.  But Harse was not just any old guest. The bellboy got the bag away from him, all right, but his victory was purely transitory. He yelled, dropped the bag, grabbed his fist with the other hand.  \"Hey! It shocked me! What kind of tricks are you trying to do with electric suitcases?\"  Mooney moaned softly. The whole lobby was looking at them--even the conventioneers at the entrance to the ballroom; even the men in mufti mingling with the conventioneers, carrying cameras and flash guns; even the very doorman, the whole lobby away. That was bad. What was worse was that Harse was obviously getting angry.  \"Wait, wait!\" Mooney stepped between them in a hurry. \"I can explain everything. My friend is, uh, an inventor. There's some very important material in that briefcase, believe me!\"  He winked, patted the bellhop on the shoulder, took his hand with friendly concern and left in it a folded bill.  \"Now,\" he said confidentially, \"we don't want any disturbance. I'm sure you understand how it is, son. Don't you? My friend can't take any chances with his, uh, confidential material, you see? Right. Well, let's say no more about it. Now if you'll show us to our room--\"  The bellhop, still stiff-backed, glanced down at the bill and the stiffness disappeared as fast as any truck-driver bathed in Harse's pale blue haze. He looked up again and grinned.  \"Sorry, sir--\" he began.  But he didn't finish. Mooney had let Harse get out of his sight a moment too long.  The first warning he had was when there was a sudden commotion among the lodge brothers. Mooney turned, much too late. There was Harse; he had wandered over there, curious and interested and--Harse. He had stared them up and down, but he hadn't been content to stare. He had opened the little silvery dispatch-case and taken out of it the thing that looked like a film viewer; and maybe it was a camera, too, because he was looking through it at the conventioneers. He was covering them as Dixie is covered by the dew, up and down, back and forth, heels to head.  And it was causing a certain amount of attention. Even one of the photographers thought maybe this funny-looking guy with the funny-looking opera glasses was curious enough to be worth a shot. After all, that was what the photographer was there for. He aimed and popped a flash gun.  There was an abrupt thin squeal from the box. Black fog sprayed out of it in a greasy jet. It billowed toward Harse. It collected around him, swirled high. Now all the flashguns were popping....  It was a clear waste of a twenty-dollar bill, Mooney told himself aggrievedly out on the sidewalk. There had been no point in buttering up the bellhop as long as Harse was going to get them thrown out anyway.         *       *       *       *       *  On the other side of the East River, in a hotel that fell considerably below Mooney's recent, brief standards of excellence, Mooney cautiously tipped a bellboy, ushered him out, locked the door behind him and, utterly exhausted, flopped on one of the twin beds.  Harse glanced at him briefly, then wandered over to the window and stared incuriously at the soiled snow outside.  \"You were fine, Harse,\" said Mooney without spirit. \"You didn't do anything wrong at all.\"  \"Ah,\" said Harse without turning. \"So?\"  Mooney sat up, reached for the phone, demanded setups and a bottle from room service and hung up.  \"Oh, well,\" he said, beginning to revive, \"at least we're in Brooklyn now. Maybe it's just as well.\"  \"As well. What?\"  \"I mean this is where you wanted to be. Now we just have to wait four days, until the twenty-sixth. We'll have to raise some more money, of course,\" he added experimentally.  Harse turned and looked at him with the pale eyes. \"One thousand dollars you have. Is not enough?\"  \"Oh, no, Harse,\" Mooney assured him. \"Why, that won't be nearly enough. The room rent in this hotel alone is likely to use that up. Besides all the extras, of course.\"  \"Ah.\" Harse, looking bored, sat down in the chair near Mooney, opened his kit, took out the thing that looked like a film viewer and put it to his eyes.  \"We'll have to sell some more of those things. After all--\" Mooney winked and dug at the pale-eyed man's ribs with his elbow--\"we'll be needing some, well, entertainment.\"  Harse took the viewer away from his eyes. He glanced thoughtfully at the elbow and then at Mooney. \"So,\" he said.  Mooney coughed and changed the subject. \"One thing, though,\" he begged. \"Don't get me in any more trouble like you did in that hotel lobby--or with that guy in the truck. Please? I mean, after all, you're making it hard for me to carry out my job.\"  Harse was thoughtfully silent.  \"Promise?\" Mooney urged.  Harse said, after some more consideration: \"It is not altogether me. That is to say, it is a matter of defense. My picture should not be. Photographed? So the survival kit insures that it is not. You understand?\"  Mooney leaned back. \"You mean--\" The bellboy with the drinks interrupted him; he took the bottle, signed the chit, tipped the boy and mixed himself a reasonably stiff but not quite stupefying highball, thinking hard.  \"Did you say 'survival kit'?\" he asked at last.  Harse was deep in the viewer again, but he looked away from it irritably. \"Naturally, survival kit. So that I can. Survive?\" He went back to the viewer.  Mooney took a long, thoughtful slug of the drink.         *       *       *       *       *  Survival kit. Why, that made sense. When the Air Force boys went out and raided the islands in the Pacific during the war, sometimes they got shot down--and it was enemy territory, or what passed for it. Those islands were mostly held by Japanese, though their populations hardly knew it. All the aboriginals knew was that strange birds crossed the sky and sometimes men came from them. The politics of the situation didn't interest the headhunters. What really interested them was heads.  But for a palatable second choice, they would settle for trade goods--cloth, mirrors, beads. And so the bomber pilots were equipped with survival kits--maps, trade goods, rations, weapons, instructions for proceeding to a point where, God willing, a friendly submarine might put ashore a rubber dinghy to take them off.  Mooney said persuasively: \"Harse. I'm sorry to bother you, but we have to talk.\" The man with the pale eyes took them away from the viewer again and stared at Mooney. \"Harse, were you shot down like an airplane pilot?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Harse frowned--not in anger, or at least not at Mooney. It was the effort to make himself understood. He said at last: \"Yes. Call it that.\"  \"And--and this place you want to go to--is that where you will be rescued?\"  \"Yes.\"  Aha, thought Mooney, and the glimmerings of a new idea began to kick and stretch its fetal limbs inside him. He put it aside, to bear and coddle in private. He said: \"Tell me more. Is there any particular part of Brooklyn you have to go to?\"  \"Ah. The Nexus Point?\" Harse put down the viewer and, snap-snap, opened the gleaming kit. He took out the little round thing he had consulted in the house by the cold Jersey sea. He tilted it this way and that, frowned, consulted a small square sparkly thing that came from another part of the case, tilted the round gadget again.  \"Correcting for local time,\" he said, \"the Nexus Point is one hour and one minute after midnight at what is called. The Vale of Cashmere?\"  Mooney scratched his ear. \"The Vale of Cashmere? Where the devil is that--somewhere in Pakistan?\"  \"Brooklyn,\" said Harse with an imp's grimace. \"You are the guide and you do not know where you are guiding me to?\"  Mooney said hastily: \"All right, Harse, all right. I'll find it. But tell me one thing, will you? Just suppose--suppose, I said--that for some reason or other, we don't make it to the what-you-call, Nexus Point. Then what happens?\"  Harse for once neither laughed nor scowled. The pale eyes opened wide and glanced around the room, at the machine-made candlewick spreads on the beds, at the dusty red curtains that made a \"suite\" out of a long room, at the dog-eared Bible that lay on the night table.  \"Suh,\" he stammered, \"suh--suh--seventeen years until there is another Nexus Point!\"   IV  Mooney dreamed miraculous dreams and not entirely because of the empty bottle that had been full that afternoon. There never was a time, never will be a time, like the future Mooney dreamed of--Mooney-owned, houri-inhabited, a fair domain for a live-wire Emperor of the Eons....  He woke up with a splitting head.  Even a man from the future had to sleep, so Mooney had thought, and it had been in his mind that, even this first night, it might pay to stay awake a little longer than Harse, just in case it might then seem like a good idea to--well, to bash him over the head and grab the bag. But the whiskey had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51810"],["title","The Undetected (#1)"],["body","t. Everything happened in a continuous sequence without a stoppage at any point. The door opened and I went in, landing hard and bouncing deliberately on the seat springs to hunch myself over; Miss Wood landed and whirled in a flurry of wet skirt and clammy raincoat, hauling one rain-booted ankle out of the way as the door swung closed with a solid and satisfying _thunk_.  I started the car and let the engine idle to warm it up and dry it off. Then I said, \"Part of my duty to the citizen includes protection of his health and comfort as well as protection from unlawful behavior. So, where do you wish to be taken?\"  She regarded me out of clear gray eyes. \"Don't you know?\" she asked with a quirk at the corner of her mouth.  \"Do I look like a mind reader?\"  \"Well, you did slow down the storm.\"  I laughed. \"Miss Wood, King Canute would have been a hero instead of a bum if he'd waited until high water before he told the tide to stop. Now, what gave you any reason to suppose that I am endowed with special talents?\"  \"Well,\" she said, fumbling through her handbag for the comb, which naturally was at the bottom, \"you did come along when I needed help, and you did identify yourself when I so much wanted to know--\"  \"And since I also remembered that storms as violent as this always have lulls, you put two and two together? Well, it doesn't require telepathy to conclude that you are soaked to the skin, that you need and want help, and that you'd prefer to know just whom you are driving off in a car with. Any other ideas about my talents?\"  \"Well, I should think--\"  \"Address first, Miss Wood.\"  She gave me an address in a residential district that was the maximum distance one could get from City Hall and still enjoy the privilege of paying city taxes. I started the car and headed in that direction. Then I said, \"Now, Miss Wood, let's go on with your little fancy.\"  \"Fancy?\"  \"You've been moonbeaming about a little courtroom drama where twelve good telepaths and true are reading the mental testimony of a witness who had located some vital bit of evidence by perception and brought it to light by kinematic power.\"  \"Well, it does seem that any truly gifted person would work for the good of humanity.\"  \"I doubt that being gifted with a sense of perception would automatically endow a man with a sense of honor.\"  \"But doesn't it seem just _awful_ to think of anything as miraculous as telepathy being used for--for--\"  She was trying to avoid the word \"immoral\" because she was of an age and experience that felt sensitive about its use. Unfortunately the only substitute was the word \"sin.\"  I came to her rescue. \"It's deplorable but true that nothing was ever developed for the benefit of mankind without a few sharpshooters quickly figuring out some way to make it pay them a dishonest buck.\"  \"But it would be frightfully hard to bamboozle a telepathic policeman, wouldn't it?\" she asked hopefully.         *       *       *       *       *  I thought of my PSI-man, whose only mistake in the sealed room murder of Gordon Andrews had been in being _so_ good that he'd actually disclosed the existence of a criminal who employed Psi faculties.  \"Wouldn't that depend upon whether the policeman or the criminal was the more talented?\" I parried. \"But that supposes that the police force would have a corps of Psi policemen.\"  \"Wouldn't they?\"  \"Honey-chile,\" I said, \"at the first thin hint that the Commissioner was even interested in the possibility of hiring someone who knew what the term 'parapsychic phenomena' really meant, there would be a universal howl against 'Thought Police' so loud that it would shatter the polar icecaps.\"  \"But why?\" she asked, bewildered.  \"They'd start screaming about 'invasion of privacy,' and cite the Bill of Rights, and that would be that.\"  \"You mean that the law has laws against telepathy?\"  \"No, it doesn't say anything about telepathy,\" I admitted, knowing what was to come next.  \"Well, then?\"  \"Don't sound so superior, Miss Wood. At the first attempt, the law would discover that it had a hell of a lot to say about telepathy and perception, since they'd definitely affect the interpretation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\"  \"I know the Fifth,\" she said, \"but how about the Fourth?\"  \"Unreasonable and unwarranted search,\" I told her.  \"But isn't a man guilty when he's guilty?\"  \"I wish it were as simple as that.\"  \"But why isn't it?\"  \"Little Miss Wood, you are now asking me to solve an ethical question that's been unanswered for more than ten thousand years.\" I smiled wistfully. \"I am not--repeat not--big enough to answer the following question: 'Shall a killer in the confessional, who has been given absolution by his God, subsequently be punished by his fellow man?'\"  \"But what has that to do with it?\"  \"Let's have _you_ answer one: 'Could you truly bare your secret soul to God if you suspected that some prying human being was taking it all down on a tape recorder?'\"  \"No, I suppose not.\"  \"Then our 'Thought Police' would be standing as a human barrier between any man and his God.\"  \"I suppose so--but couldn't I _tell_?\"  \"Tell?\"  \"Tell whether someone was listening to my thoughts?\"  That was another stumper. Does the sign wear out any faster if it's read? Can the radio transmitter be measured to tell whether the broadcast has any audience? Does the tree that falls in the forest barren of animal life generate the same wave-motion as it would if all the leaves were replaced by active eardrums? There are lots of analogs, but are any of them valid?  I said, \"If I cry out, how can I know whether I am being heard?\"  And in my mind I made my own reply. I thought in deep concentration: \"_How do you read me, Psi-man?_\"  The response was zero-zero. And it meant--nothing. My Psi-man could have been following my every thought from the moment that my ringing telephone summoned me to Gordon Andrews' apartment to the present instant, so far as I could tell. There was no feeling of intrusion, no feeling of _presence_.   III  Florence Wood giggled. \"Going to stop the rain again, Captain Schnell?\"  The storm was still howling. In the near suburbs, the rain came in more gracefully draped sheets and the wind was not whirlpooled by the fluelike canyons between the buildings, but residential rainwater is just as wet per cubic centimeter as the metropolitan variety.  \"Maybe I should drive up over the lawn,\" I suggested.  \"Daddy would blow a fuse.\"  \"We might wait for it to let up.\"  \"I'd rather not,\" she said soberly. \"It's one thing to be driven home in a strange car during a cloudburst, but it's something else to sit out here making it look as if I were paying off by making out.\"  It came as a pleasant surprise that she did not consider me a superannuated gaffer, and it was her youth that allowed her to discuss parapsychic phenomena without the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the older know-it-alls. I considered Florence Wood and realized that she was at least old enough so that I wouldn't be jugged for cradle-robbing so long as I had a parental acceptance. And I did want someone to talk out the business of psionics without having someone wind me in a sheet and ship me to a shrinker.  And so I said, \"If it will smooth things a bit, I'll umbrella you to the door and make official explanation to the stern and anxious parent.\"  \"That we'll enjoy,\" she giggled. \"Daddy always says that he doesn't have to be a mind reader to advise against what my boy friends have in mind. It'll be fun to face him with a--policeman.\"  Darkly, I said, \"Most folks don't look upon me as the fun-loving type. Policemen aren't always welcome, you know.\"  \"Oh, Daddy will enjoy it. He writes a bit. He'll never be another Ellery Queen, but he will enjoy talking to a real live captain of detectives.\"  At this point a lot of favorable things took place at once, such as the arrival of another convenient letup in the storm, the mad rush and the ringing of the doorbell, the opening of the door and some gasped introductions as we stood in a little hallway dripping puddles of rainwater on a small rug.  \"Police Captain--?\"  \"Howard Schnell.\"  \"But Florence isn't--?\"  I laughed at Mrs. Wood. \"Not at all. This is just the rescue of a very wet maiden in distress. When we're not shooting bank robbers, we also help little old ladies--and lovely young girls--across streets. All in the day's work, you know.\"  Mrs. Wood hauled Florence off, saying something about hot showers and dry clothing, while Mr. Wood regarded me with interest.         *       *       *       *       *  He beat all the way around the bush, trying to ascertain without actually asking pointblank whether I could spend a few moments, and, if so, would I like a drink.  One must not anticipate, so I waited until he'd made his meaning clear. Then I accepted his offer of some bourbon, refused his offer of a cigar and settled myself into the chair he waved at.  I tasted the highball, smiled in approval, and opened the conversation by saying, \"Your daughter tells me that you write, Mr. Wood.\"  He smiled wistfully. \"Well, I'm not at the stage where the mere announcement that I am working on a novel causes an immediate pre-publication sale of seventy thousand copies. You see, I'm still trying to work out a good association gimmick.\"  \"A what?\"  \"An association gimmick. The name Erle Stanley Gardner, for instance, always means a story about Perry Mason and the inevitable courtroom scene full of legal fireworks. Rex Stout has his Nero Wolf, the fabulous detective who lets his secretary do all the work.\"  \"And,\" I added, \"John Dickson Carr writes about Gideon Fell, who is an expert at solving sealed-room mysteries.\"  \"Exactly!\" he said. \"I've a series of gimmicks all planned, but I really need a strong, out-of-the-ordinary character to go along with them. You see, I propose to write a series of stories about 'perfect crimes.'\"  \"I'm not smart,\" I said. \"I've always assumed that the so-called 'perfect crime' would be"]]]
