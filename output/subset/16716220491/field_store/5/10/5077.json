I ask attention to the report of the Postmaster-General, the following being a summary statement of the condition of the Department:  The revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1861, including the annual permanent appropriation of $700,000 for the transportation of \"free mail matter,\" was $9,049,296.40, being about 2 per cent less than the revenue for 1860.  The expenditures were $13,606,759.11, showing a decrease of more than 8 per cent as compared with those of the previous year and leaving an excess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of $4,557,462.71.  The gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1863, is estimated at an increase of 4 per cent on that of 1861, making $8,683,000, to which should be added the earnings of the Department in carrying free matter, viz, $700,000, making $9,383,000.  The total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leaving an estimated deficiency of $3,145,000 to be supplied from the Treasury in addition to the permanent appropriation.  The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this District across the Potomac River at the time of establishing the capital here was eminently wise, and consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of it which lies within the State of Virginia was unwise and dangerous. I submit for your consideration the expediency of regaining that part of the District and the restoration of the original boundaries thereof through negotiations with the State of Virginia.  The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying documents, exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public business pertaining to that Department. The depressing influences of the insurrection have been specially felt in the operations of the Patent and General Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the past year have exceeded the expenses of our land system only about $200,000. The sales have been entirely suspended in the Southern States, while the interruptions to the business of the country and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service have obstructed settlements in the new States and Territories of the Northwest.  The receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about $100,000, rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to make it self-sustaining.  The demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by the insurrection. Numerous applications for pensions, based upon the casualties of the existing war, have already been made. There is reason to believe that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt of the bounty of the Government are in the ranks of the insurgent army or giving them aid and comfort. The Secretary of the Interior has directed a suspension of the payment of the pensions of such persons upon proof of their disloyalty. I recommend that Congress authorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension rolls.  The relations of the Government with the Indian tribes have been greatly disturbed by the insurrection, especially in the southern superintendency and in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south of Kansas is in the possession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The agents of the United States appointed since the 4th of March for this superintendency have been unable to reach their posts, while the most of those who were in office before that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause, and assume to exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the insurrectionists. It has been stated in the public press that a portion of those Indians have been organized as a military force and are attached to the army of the insurgents. Although the Government has no official information upon this subject, letters have been written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs by several prominent chiefs giving assurance of their loyalty to the United States and expressing a wish for the presence of Federal troops to protect them. It is believed that upon the repossession of the country by the Federal forces the Indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations and resume their former relations to the Government.  Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has not a department nor a bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in the Government. While it is fortunate that this great interest is so independent in its nature as to not have demanded and extorted more from the Government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something more can not be given voluntarily with general advantage.  Annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce, and manufactures would present a fund of information of great practical value to the country. While I make no suggestion as to details, I venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be organized.  The execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade has been confided to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of gratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic have been recently attended with unusual success. Five vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and condemned. Two mates of vessels engaged in the trade and one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver have been convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain, taken with a cargo of Africans on board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of offense under our laws, the punishment of which is death.  The Territories of Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada, created by the last Congress, have been organized, and civil administration has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying when it is considered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these new countries when the Federal officers arrived there.  The abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the security and protection afforded by organized government, will doubtless invite to them a large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country to its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of the legislature of Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the Territory. So far the authority of the United States has been upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in the future. I commend their interests and defense to the enlightened and generous care of Congress.  I recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress the interests of the District of Columbia. The insurrection has been the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have no representative in Congress that body should not overlook their just claims upon the Government.  At your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the President to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of the industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of the industry of all nations to be holden at London in the year 1862. I regret to say I have been unable to give personal attention to this subject--a subject at once so interesting in itself and so extensively and intimately connected with the material prosperity of the world. Through the Secretaries of State and of the Interior a plan or system has been devised and partly matured, and which will be laid before you.  Under and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled \"An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,\" approved August 6, 1861, the legal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of certain other persons have become forfeited, and numbers of the latter thus liberated are already dependent on the United States and must be provided for in some way. Besides this, it is not impossible that some of the States will pass similar enactments for their own benefit respectively, and by operation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for disposal. In such case I recommend that Congress provide for accepting such persons from such States, according to some mode of valuation, in lieu, pro tanto, of direct taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such States respectively; that such persons, on such acceptance by the General Government, be at once deemed free, and that in any event steps be taken for colonizing both classes (or the one first mentioned if the other shall not be brought into existence) at some place or places in a climate congenial to them. It might be well to consider, too, whether the free colored people already in the United States could not, so far as individuals may desire, be included in such colonization.  To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition. Having practiced the acquisition of territory for nearly sixty years, the question of constitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us. The power was questioned at first by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great expediency. If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white men, this measure effects that object, for the emigration of colored men leaves additional room for white men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring Louisiana more on political and commercial grounds than on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50259"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Flying Tigers (#1)"],["body","ves, Captains, and give me the great happiness of eating my humble offering.\"  \"On condition that you have the waiter bring your meal over here, sir, and join us,\" Freddy Farmer said politely. \"And may I ask, sir? You are the Mr. Kai of the Chinese Embassy here, are you not?\"  \"You are absolutely correct,\" the other smiled, and signalled to the waiter to transfer his meal to their table. \"Quite correct and, indeed, kind. We of China do not like to take our meals alone. And it is the same when we are in foreign lands, too. So I must thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generous hospitality.\"  \"Well, to be truthful, sir,\" Dawson chuckled, \"the pleasure really is all ours. You'd be surprised how sick Freddy and I get of hearing each other sound off.\"  \"Eh?\" the English youth grunted, and shot Dave a hostile look. \"Sound off, you say?\"  Soo Wong Kai laughed softly and leaned toward Freddy.  \"The American way of saying, throwing the bull, Captain Farmer,\" he said. \"Or, as you English would have it, swinging the gate. In China we have an expression which, when translated, means, counting the locusts. There are billions and billions of locusts in China, you see. So to say that one is counting the locusts is to mean that one is simply talking to hear oneself. Or sounding off. Or throwing the bull. Or swinging the gate. You see?\"  \"I've got a hunch you've kind of been around here and there, eh, Mr. Kai?\" Dave grinned at him. \"And--oh, my gosh! Pardon me, sir!\"  The Chinese looked at Dave and raised his thin brows in innocent puzzlement.  \"For what, may I ask, Captain Dawson?\" he said. \"For what reason should you exclaim and ask my pardon? I fear I do not quite understand.\"  Dawson swallowed, and licked his lower lip quickly.  \"I suddenly remembered seeing your picture in the London _Times_, and reading about you, sir,\" Dave presently said. \"You're Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's new Minister of War, aren't you? And the head of the Military Mission that recently arrived in England?\"  \"That's true.\" The Chinese nodded and smiled. \"But I still fail to see why you must beg my pardon.\"  \"Well, for being sort of flip with my talk, sir,\" Dave said. \"You're a high government official, and--well, after all--\"  \"After all, are we not both men, Captain?\" the other interrupted quietly. \"And are we not fighting the same foe, each in his own way? Believe me, Captain, it is I who look up to you, because of the great and fine things you have accomplished in the name of liberty and world happiness. You, and your true friend, here. And millions of other brave soldiers, too. Yes, I am a high government official, as you say, but the higher a man gets the more he respects and admires those who do the fighting, and shed the blood. They are the ones who are winning this war, not we aged ones who are serving our respective countries in some official capacity. _Youth_ will win this struggle, Captain. And youth will win the peace, too. But--\"  Soo Wong Kai paused. His face remained grave, but as he leaned slightly toward Dawson there was a merry twinkle in his eyes.  \"But what do you say we skip it, eh?\" he chuckled. \"Out the window with who's who, and why. Until we must part, let's just be three guys named Joe, huh?\"  Both Dave and Freddy gulped hard, and then burst out laughing.  \"Fair enough, it's a deal!\" Dawson cried. \"But I repeat what I said just now. You've sure been around, Mr. Kai. But plenty!\"     CHAPTER TWO  _Clocks Won't Wait_   For the next hour the English air ace, the Yank air ace, and the new Chinese Minister of War would hardly have noticed a German Luftwaffe bomb coming down through the dining-room ceiling. None came down, of course, because the good old R.A.F. patroled the night skies outside, and German night fliers had long since realized that the R.A.F. boys could beat them to the punch any day in the week, and twice on Sundays. Under pressure from the Chinese official, Freddy and Dave recounted some of the experiences they'd had during the war. And under polite pressure from them, Soo Wong Kai told them many interesting stories of China.  \"That's one country I sure want to visit before I die,\" Dave said after a short silence. \"It must be very wonderful in China. I've read quite a bit about it, but I guess if you piled all the books about China one on top of the other you wouldn't even begin to scratch the surface, eh? If you get what I mean, sir?\"  \"Yes, I do, Captain,\" the other replied. \"And I'm afraid you're quite right. There has been a great deal written about China, but it would take ten times as much to tell the story of the real China--the China of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his people.\"  \"There's a soldier!\" Freddy Farmer spoke up with a vigorous nod. \"What a splendid leader, and what splendid troops he now commands. I quite agree with Dave, sir. I, too, hope to visit China some day.\"  \"And may that day come soon,\" Soo Wong Kai said gravely. \"Soon, because of the things you will see in China. And soon, because of the honor such a visit would be to my country. China has come a long way, and she still has a long, long road to travel. But we shall travel that road, and we shall attain the goal at the end of that road. But there I go sounding off, when I can easily see that you two gentlemen are doing me the great honor of being polite. So--\"  \"No, you're wrong, sir!\" Dawson spoke up quickly. \"I'm enjoying every second of this talk. And I know Freddy is, too. Believe me, sir, and this is the truth: If I'm given the chance--which you can bet on that I won't be--of picking the next front to fight on, I'll pick China right off the bat.\"  \"Hear, hear!\" Freddy Farmer added his bit quickly. \"Quite, sir. We were almost there, when we were in Burma just before the States came into the war. However, as Dawson says, if we have our choice next time, it will most certainly be China.\"[1]  [Footnote 1: _Dave Dawson at Singapore._]  \"And a happy day that will be for my struggling countrymen,\" Soo Wong Kai said softly. \"We have there, now, the Flying Tigers. True and brave airmen they are. And China will never be able to repay her debt to those gallant boys. What they have done for China is something no nation and no people could ever hope to repay in full. And to have you two fight on the China front would be much the same thing. Do not look at me so, for it is the truth when I say that I have heard your names, and your deeds, mentioned deep in my country. So, should your orders ever carry you to China, all that China has to offer is yours for the asking. And--Ah! But the truth embarrasses you, eh?\"  Dawson grinned, and wished that some of the redness would go out of his face. He liked praise just as much as the next fellow, but Soo Wong Kai was sure hitting on all sixteen cylinders.  \"Well, there's a couple of other fellows or so fighting in this war, too, sir,\" he said with a little laugh. \"But thanks just the same, sir.\"  \"And thank you, Captains, for a most pleasant meeting,\" the Minister of War said as he rose to his feet. \"I shall always remember this happy event. And it will be my perpetual wish that some day we will meet again in my country. Again, thank you. And I bid you a heartfelt good evening, Captains.\"  Both Dawson and Freddy leaped to their feet, stammered out their thanks, shook hands with the Chinese, and remained at attention as he walked away and out of the dining-room.  \"Well, quite an event, what?\" the English youth breathed after they had reseated themselves. \"Quite a splendid chap, eh? A very decent sort.\"  \"Tops, and how!\" Dave grunted, and pointed at their empty plates. \"Go on and say it, pal. I can read it in your eyes.\"  \"Say what?\" Freddy demanded. \"And just what can you read in my eyes, I'd like to know?\"  \"What you're thinking, and wishing,\" Dave said with a straight face. \"That he'd brought along one of his official buddies.\"  \"You still aren't making sense!\" Freddy snapped. \"Speak up! Get it off your blasted chest, whatever it is.\"  \"As if you didn't know!\" Dawson snorted. \"If he'd brought along one of his official buddies, why then there would have been more meat ration coupons, of course. And you could have worked them for a second helping of roast beef. Don't try to kid a pal, pal! You were kind of thinking that, weren't you?\"  \"No, my little man,\" Freddy replied softly, and slowly reached for a dish of pudding he hadn't touched yet. \"But would you care to have me _show_ you what I'm thinking _now_?\"  \"Do, sweetheart!\" Dave growled, and reached for his own pudding. \"And you'll be combing pudding out of your hair, too. So--Sweet tripe, Freddy! Let's dive in and finish this. We're due out at Croydon Airport in a little over an hour. And we haven't packed, or paid the bill yet. And you can bet your sweet life that that Newfoundland-bound bomber isn't going to wait for us.\"  \"Right as rain!\" Freddy echoed behind a heaping spoon of pudding. \"Darned decent of the Air Ministry to give us a ride by air, instead of having us make the crossing by water. A magic world, isn't it, Dave! By this time tomorrow night we'll be dining in New York City. Magic isn't the word.\"  \"No, it's speed!\" Dawson snapped. \"Can the chatter, pal, and just shovel it in. And I'll match you for the check.\"  \"No, Dave, I'll pay it.\"  \"What?\" Dawson gasped. \"Am I hearing things?\"  \"I said that I would pay the check,\" Freddy replied. \"No! Not because I am big-hearted, either. Simply to save the trouble of tossing coins with you--and losing _as usual_.\"  \"Oh, well, don't feel too bad, pal,\" Dave grinned at him. \"You'll catch on to how it's done, some day. Then you can make up for lost time. However, just to prove that I'm a nice guy, I'll pay the check myself.\"  That last caused Freddy Farmer to go speechless. And he remained speechless while Dawson took the check from the waiter and paid it in full, plus tip.  \"Wonderful!\" the English youth breathed softly. \"I have just witnessed the miracle of miracles, and I don'"]]]
