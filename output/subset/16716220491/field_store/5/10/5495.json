The lean, wiry, and very active man did not usually fall into these fits of total enervation excepting in the daytime, for after sundown a wonderful change would come over the gray-headed veteran, who nevertheless still displayed much youthful energy in the exercise of his official duties.  At night his drooping eyelids, that almost veiled his eyes, opened more wildly, his flaccid hanging under-lip closed firmly, his long neck and narrow elongated head were held erect, and when, at a later hour, he went out to drinking-bouts or to the service in honor of Mithras, he might often still be taken for a fine, indomitable young man.  But when he was drunk he was no longer gay, but wild, braggart, and noisy.  It frequently happened that before he left the carouse, while he was still in the midst of his boon-companions, the syncope would come upon him which had so often alarmed Sirona, and from which he could never feel perfectly safe even when he was on duty at the head of his soldiers.  The vehement big man in such moments offered a terrible image of helpless impotence; the paleness of death would overspread his features, his back was as if it were broken, and he lost his control over every limb.  His eyes only continued to move, and now and then a shudder shook his frame. His people said that when he was in this condition, the centurion's ghastly demon had entered into him, and he himself believed in this evil spirit, and dreaded it; nay, he had attempted to be released through heathen spells, and even through Christian exorcisms.  Now he sat in the dark room on the sheepfell, which in scorn of his wife he had spread on a hard wooden bench.  His hands and feet turned cold, his eyes glowed, and the power to move even a finger had wholly deserted him; only his lips twitched, and his inward eye, looking back on the past with preternaturally sharpened vision, saw, far away and beyond, the last frightful hour.  \"If,\" thought he, \"after my mad run down to the oasis, which few younger men could have vied with, I had given the reins to my fury instead of restraining it, the demon would not have mastered me so easily.  How that devil Miriam's eyes flashed as she told me that a man was betraying me. She certainly must have seen the wearer of the sheepskin, but I lost sight of her before I reached the oasis; I fancy she turned and went up the mountain.  What indeed might not Sirona have done to her?  That woman snares all hearts with her eyes as a bird-catcher snares birds with his flute.  How the fine gentlemen ran after her in Rome!  Did she dishonor me there, I wonder?  She dismissed the Legate Quintillus, who was so anxious to please me--I may thank that fool of a woman that he became my enemy--but he was older even than I, and she likes young men best.  She is like all the rest of them, and I of all men might have known it.  It is the way of the world: to-day one gives a blow and to-morrow takes one.\"  A sad smile passed over his lips, then his features settled into a stern gravity, for various unwelcome images rose clearly before his mind, and would not be got rid of.  His conscience stood in inverse relation to the vigor of his body.  When he was well, his too darkly stained past life troubled him little; but when he was unmanned by weakness, he was incapable of fighting the ghastly demon that forced upon his memory in painful vividness those very deeds which he would most willingly have forgotten.  In such hours he must need remember his friend, his benefactor, and superior officer, the Tribune Servianus, whose fair young wife he had tempted with a thousand arts to forsake her husband and child, and fly with him into the wide world; and at this moment a bewildering illusion made him fancy that he was the Tribune Servianus, and yet at the same time himself.  Every hour of pain, and the whole bitter anguish that his betrayed benefactor had suffered through his act when he had seduced Glycera, he himself now seemed to realize, and at the same time the enemy that had betrayed him, Servianus, was none other than himself, Phoebicius, the Gaul.  He tried to protect himself and meditated revenge against the seducer, and still he could not altogether lose the sense of his own identity.  This whirl of mad imagining, which he vainly endeavored to make clear to himself, threatened to distract his reason, and he groaned aloud; the sound of his own voice brought him back to actuality.  He was Phoebicius again and not another, that he knew now, and yet he could not completely bring himself to comprehend the situation.  The image of the lovely Glycera, who had followed him to Alexandria, and whom he had there abandoned, when he had squandered his last piece of money and her last costly jewels in the Greek city, no longer appeared to him alone, but always side by side with his wife Sirona.  Glycera had been a melancholy sweetheart, who had wept much, and laughed little after running away from her husband; he fancied he could hear her speaking soft words of reproach, while Sirona defied him with loud threats, and dared to nod and signal to the senator's son Polykarp.  The weary dreamer angrily shook himself, collected his thoughts, doubled his fist, and lifted it angrily; this movement was the first sign of returning physical energy; he stretched his limbs like a man awaking from sleep, rubbed his eyes, pressed his hands to his temples; by degrees full consciousness returned to him, and with it the recollection of all that had occurred in the last hour or two.  He hastily left the dark room, refreshed himself in the kitchen with a gulp of wine, and went up to the open window to gaze at the stars.  It was long past midnight; he was reminded of his companions now sacrificing on the mountain, and addressed a long prayer \"to the crown,\" \"the invincible sun-god,\" \"the great light,\" \"the god begotten of the rock,\" and to many other names of Mithras; for since he had belonged to the mystics of this divinity, he had become a zealous devotee, and could fast too with extraordinary constancy.  He had already passed through several of the eighty trials, to which a man had to subject himself before he could attain to the highest grades of the initiated, and the weakness which had just now overpowered him, had attacked him for the first time, after he had for a whole week lain for hours in the snow, besides fasting severely, in order to attain the grade of \"lion.\"  Sirona's rigorous mind was revolted by all these practices, and the decision with which she had always refused to take any part in them, had widened the breach which, without that, parted her from her husband. Phoebicius was, in his fashion, very much in earnest with all these things; for they alone saved him in some measure from himself, from dark memories, and from the fear of meeting the reward of his evil deeds in a future life, while Sirona found her best comfort in the remembrance of her early life, and so gathered courage to endure the miserable present cheerfully, and to hold fast to hope for better times.  Phoebicius ended his prayer to-day--a prayer for strength to break his wife's strong spirit, for a successful issue to his revenge on her seducer--ended it without haste, and with careful observance of all the prescribed forms.  Then he took two strong ropes from the wall, pulled himself up, straight and proud, as if he were about to exhort his soldiers to courage before a battle, cleared his throat like an orator in the Forum before he begins his discourse, and entered the bedroom with a dignified demeanor.  Not the smallest suspicion of the possibility of her escape troubled his sense of security, when, not finding Sirona in the sleeping-room, he went into the sitting-room to carry out the meditated punishment.  Here again--no one.  He paused in astonishment; but the thought that she could have fled appeared to him so insane, that he immediately and decisively dismissed it.  No doubt she feared his wrath, and was hidden under her bed or behind the curtain which covered his clothes.  \"The dog,\" thought he, \"is still cowering by her--\" and he began to make a noise, half whistling and half hissing, which Iambe could not bear, and which always provoked her to bark angrily--but in vain.  All was still in the vacant room, still as death.  He was now seriously anxious; at first deliberately, and then with rapid haste, he threw the light under every vessel, into every corner, behind every cloth, and rummaged in places that not even a child --nay hardly a frightened bird could have availed itself of for concealment.  At last his right hand fairly dropped the ropes, and his left, in which he held the lamp, began to tremble.  He found the shutters of the sleeping-room open; where Sirona had been sitting on the seat looking at the moon, before Hermas had come upon the scene.  \"Then she is not here!\"  he muttered, and setting the lamp on the little table, from which he had just now flung Polykarp's glass, he tore open the door, and hurried into the courtyard.  That she could have swung herself out into the road, and have set out in the night for the open desert, had not yet entered into his mind.  He shook the door that closed in the homestead, and found it locked; the watch-dogs roused themselves, and gave tongue, when Phoebicius turned to Petrus' house, and began to knock at the door with the brazen knocker, at first softly and then with growing anger; he considered it as certain that his wife had sought and found protection under the senator's roof.  He could have shouted with rage and anguish, and yet he hardly thought of his wife and the danger of losing her, but only of Polykarp and the disgrace he had wrought upon him, and the reparation he would exact from him, and his parents, who had dared to tamper with his household rights--his, the imperial centurion's.  What was Sirona to him?  In the flush of an hour of excitement he had linked her destiny to his."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5496"],["title","Homo Sum â€” Volume 03 (#2)"],["body","  At Arelas, about two years since, one of his comrades had joined their circle of boon-companions, and had related that he had been the witness of a remarkable scene.  A number of young fellows had surrounded a boy and had unmercifully beaten him--he himself knew not wherefore.  The little one had defended himself bravely, but was at last overcome by numbers.  \"Then suddenly,\" continued the soldier, \"the door of a house near the circus opened, and a young girl with long golden hair flew out, and drove the boys to flight, and released the victim, her brother, from his tormentors.  She looked like a lioness,\" cried the narrator, \"Sirona she is called, and of all the pretty girls of Arelas, she is beyond a doubt the prettiest.\"  This opinion was confirmed on all sides, and Phoebicius, who at that time had just been admitted to the grade of \"lion\" among the worshippers of Mithras, and liked very well to hear himself called \"the lion,\" exclaimed, \"I have long been seeking a lioness, and here it seems to me that I have found one.  Phoebicius and Sirona--the two names sound very finely together.\"  On the following day he asked Sirona of her father for his wife, and as he had to set out for Rome in a few days the wedding was promptly celebrated.  She had never before quitted Arelas, and knew not what she was giving up, when she took leave of her father's house perhaps for ever.  In Rome Phoebicius and his young wife met again; there many admired the beautiful woman, and made every effort to obtain her favor, but to him she was only a lightly won, and therefore a lightly valued, possession; nay, ere long no more than a burden, ornamental no doubt but troublesome to guard.  When presently his handsome wife attracted the notice of the legate, he endeavored to gain profit and advancement through her, but Sirona had rebuffed Quintillus with such insulting disrespect, that his superior officer became the centurion's enemy, and contrived to procure his removal to the oasis, which was tantamount to banishment.  From that time he had regarded her too as his enemy, and firmly believed that she designedly showed herself most friendly to those who seemed most obnoxious to him, and among these he reckoned Polykarp.  Once more the knocker sounded on the senator's door; it opened, and Petrus himself stood before the raging Gaul, a lamp in his hand.     CHAPTER XI.  The unfortunate Paulus sat on a stone bench in front of the senator's door, and shivered; for, as dawn approached, the night-air grew cooler, and he was accustomed to the warmth of the sheepskin, which he had now given to Hermas.  In his hand he held the key of the church, which he had promised the door-keeper to deliver to Petrus; but all was so still in the senator's house, that he shrank from rousing the sleepers.  \"What a strange night this has been!\"  he muttered to himself, as he drew his short and tattered tunic closer together.  \"Even if it were warmer, and if, instead of this threadbare rag, I had a sack of feathers to wrap myself in, still I should feel a cold shiver if the spirits of hell that wander about here were to meet me again.  Now I have actually seen one with my own eyes.  Demons in women's form rush up the mountain out of the oasis to tempt and torture us in our sleep.  What could it have been that the goblin in a white robe and with flowing hair held in its arms?  Very likely the stone with which the incubus loads our breast when he torments us.  The other one seemed to fly, but I did not see its wings.  That side-building must be where the Gaul lives with his ungodly wife, who has ensnared my poor Hermas.  I wonder whether she is really so beautiful! But what can a youth who has grown up among rocks and caves know of the charms of women.  He would, of course, think the first who looked kindly at him the most enchanting of her sex.  Besides she is fair, and therefore a rare bird among the sunburnt bipeds of the desert.  The centurion surely cannot have found the sheepskin or all would not be so still here; once since I have been here an ass has brayed, once a camel has groaned, and now already the first cock is crowing; but not a sound have I heard from human lips, not even a snore from the stout senator or his buxom wife Dorothea, and it would be strange indeed if they did not both snore.\"  He rose, went up to the window of Phoebicius dwelling, and listened at the half open shutters, but all was still.  An hour ago Miriam had been listening under Sirona's room; after betraying her to Phoebicius she had followed him at a distance, and had slipped back into the court-yard through the stables; she felt that she must learn what was happening within, and what fate had befallen Hermas and Sirona at the hands of the infuriated Gaul.  She was prepared for anything, and the thought that the centurion might have killed them both with the sword filled her with bitter-sweet satisfaction.  Then, seeing the light through the crack between the partly open wooden shutters, she softly pushed them farther apart, and, resting her bare feet against the wall, she raised herself to look in.  She saw Sirona sitting up upon her couch, and opposite to her the Gaul with pale distorted features; at his feet lay the sheepskin; in his right hand he held the lamp, and its light fell on the paved floor in front of the bed, and was reflected in a large dark red pool.  \"That is blood,\" thought she, and she shuddered and closed her eyes.  When she reopened them she saw Sirona's face with crimson cheeks, turned towards her husband; she was unhurt--but Hermas?  \"'That is his blood!\"  she thought with anguish, and a voice seemed to scream in her very heart, \"I, his murderess, have shed it.\"  Her hands lost their hold of the shutters, her feet touched the pavement of the yard, and, driven by her bitter anguish of soul, she fled out by the way she had come--out into the open and up to the mountain.  She felt that rather would she defy the prowling panthers, the night-chill, hunger and thirst, than appear again before Dame Dorothea, the senator, and Marthana, with this guilt on her soul; and the flying Miriam was one of the goblin forms that had terrified Paulus.  The patient anchorite sat down again on the stone seat.  \"The frost is really cruel,\" thought he, \"and a very good thing is such a woolly sheepskin; but the Saviour endured far other sufferings than these, and for what did I quit the world but to imitate Him, and to endure to the end here that I may win the joys of the other world.  There, where angels soar, man will need no wretched ram's fell, and this time certainly selfishness has been far from me, for I really and truly suffer for another--I am freezing for Hermas, and to spare the old man pain.  I would it were even colder!  Nay, I will never, absolutely never again lay a sheepskin over my shoulders.\"  Paulus nodded his head as if to signify assent to his own resolve; but presently he looked graver, for again it seemed to him that he was walking in a wrong path.  \"Aye!  Man achieves a handful of good, and forthwith his heart swells with a camel-load of pride.  What though my teeth are chattering, I am none the less a most miserable creature.  How it tickled my vanity, in spite of all my meditations and scruples, when they came from Raithu and offered me the office of elder; I felt more triumphant the first time I won with the quadriga, but I was scarcely more puffed up with pride then, than I was yesterday.  How many who think to follow the Lord strive only to be exalted as He is; they keep well out of the way of His abasement. Thou, O Thou Most High, art my witness that I earnestly seek it, but so soon as the thorns tear my flesh the drops of blood turn to roses, and if I put them aside, others come and still fling garlands in my way.  I verily believe that it is as hard here on earth to find pain without pleasure, as pleasure without pain.\"  While thus he meditated his teeth chattered with cold, but suddenly his reflections were interrupted, for the dogs set up a loud barking. Phoebicius was knocking at the senator's door.  Paulus rose at once, and approached the gate-way.  He could hear every word that was spoken in the court-yard; the deep voice was the senator's, the high sharp tones must be the centurion's.  Phoebicius was demanding his wife back from Petrus, as she had hidden in his house, while Petrus positively declared that Sirona had not crossed his threshold since the morning of the previous day.  In spite of the vehement and indignant tones in which his lodger spoke, the senator remained perfectly calm, and presently went away to ask his wife whether she by chance, while he was asleep, had opened the house to the missing woman.  Paulus heard the soldier's steps as he paced up and down the court-yard, but they soon ceased, for Dame Dorothea appeared at the door with her husband, and on her part emphatically declared that she knew nothing of Sirona.  \"Your son Polykarp then,\" interrupted Phoebicius, \"will be better informed of her whereabouts.\"  \"My son has been since yesterday at Raithu on business,\" said Petrus resolutely but evasively; \"we expect him home to-day only.\"  \"It would seem that he has been quick, and has returned much sooner,\" retorted Phoebicius.  \"Our preparations for sacrificing on the mountain were no secret, and the absence of the master of the house is the opportunity for thieves to break in--above all, for lovers who throw roses into their ladies' windows.  You Christians boast that you regard the marriage tie as sacred, but it seems to me that you apply the rule only to your fellow-believers.  Your sons may make free to take their pleasure among the wives of the heathen; it only remains to be proved whether the heathen husbands will be trifled with or not.  So far as I am concerned, I am inclined for anything rather than jesting.  I would have you to understand that I will never let Caesar's uniform, which I wear, be stained by disgrace,"]]]
