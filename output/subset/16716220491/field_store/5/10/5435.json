The following day, at noon, the students came in, hurrying up the great stair. At the first landing-place, on a small well-known black board, was a bit of paper fastened by wafers, and many remains of old wafers beside it. On the paper were the words, \"An operation to-day.--J.B., CLERK\"  Up ran the youths, eager to secure good places: in they crowded, full of interest and talk. \"What's the case?\" \"Which side is it?\"  Don't think them heartless; they are neither better nor worse than you or I; they get over their professional horrors, and into their proper work; and in them pity, as an EMOTION, ending in itself or at best in tears and a long-drawn breath, lessens,--while pity, as a MOTIVE, is quickened, and gains power and purpose. It is well for poor human nature that it is so.  The operating theatre is crowded; much talk and fun, and all the cordiality and stir of youth. The surgeon with his staff of assistants is there. In comes Ailie: one look at her quiets and abates the eager students. That beautiful old woman is too much for them; they sit down, and are dumb, and gaze at her. These rough boys feel the power of her presence. She walks in quickly, but without haste; dressed in her mutch, her neckerchief, her white dimity short-gown, her black bombazine petticoat, showing her white worsted stockings and her carpet shoes. Behind her was James with Rab. James sat down in the distance, and took that huge and noble head between his knees. Rab looked perplexed and dangerous; forever cocking his ear and dropping it as fast.  Ailie stepped up on a seat, and laid herself on the table, as her friend the surgeon told her; arranged herself, gave a rapid look at James, shut her eyes, rested herself on me, and took my hand. The operation was at once begun; it was necessarily slow; and chloroform--one of God's best gifts to his suffering children--was then unknown. The surgeon did his work. The pale face showed its pain, but was still and silent. Rab's soul was working within him; he saw that something strange was going on,--blood flowing from his mistress, and she suffering; his ragged ear was up, and importunate; he growled and gave now and then a sharp impatient yelp; he would have liked to have done something to that man. But James had him firm, and gave him a GLOWER from time to time, and an intimation of a possible kick;--all the better for James, it kept his eye and his mind off Ailie.  It is over: she is dressed, steps gently and decently down from the table, looks for James; then, turning to the surgeon and the students, she courtesies, and in a low, clear voice begs their pardon if she has behaved ill. The students--all of us--wept like children; the surgeon happed her up carefully, and, resting on James and me, Ailie went to her room, Rab following. We put her to bed. James took off his heavy shoes, crammed with tackets, heel-capt and toe-capt, and put them carefully under the table, saying, \"Maister John, I'm for nane o' yer strynge nurse bodies for Ailie. I'll be her nurse, and I'll gang aboot on my stockin' soles as canny as pussy.\" And so he did; and handy and clever and swift and tender as any woman was that horny-handed, snell, peremptory little man. Everything she got he gave her: he seldom slept; and often I saw his small shrewd eyes out of the darkness, fixed on her. As before, they spoke little.  Rab behaved well, never moving, showing us how meek and gentle he could be, and occasionally, in his sleep, letting us know that he was demolishing some adversary. He took a walk with me every day, generally to the Candlemaker Row; but he was sombre and mild, declined doing battle, though some fit cases offered, and indeed submitted to sundry indignities, and was always very ready to turn, and came faster back, and trotted up the stair with much lightness, and went straight to that door.  Jess, the mare, had been sent, with her weather-worn cart, to Howgate, and had doubtless her own dim and placid meditations and confusions on the absence of her master and Rab and her unnatural freedom from the road and her cart.  For some days Ailie did well. The wound healed \"by the first intention;\" for, as James said, \"Oor Ailie's skin's ower clean to beil.\" The students came in quiet and anxious, and surrounded her bed. She said she liked to see their young, honest faces. The surgeon dressed her, and spoke to her in his own short kind way, pitying her through his eyes, Rab and James outside the circle,--Rab being now reconciled, and even cordial, and having made up his mind that as yet nobody required worrying, but, as you may suppose, semper paratus.  So far well; but four days after the operation my patient had a sudden and long shivering, a \"groosin',\" as she called it. I saw her soon after; her eyes were too bright, her cheek colored; she was restless, and ashamed of being so; the balance was lost; mischief had begun. On looking at the wound, a blush of red told the secret: her pulse was rapid, her breathing anxious and quick; she wasn't herself, as she said, and was vexed at her restlessness. We tried what we could. James did everything, was everywhere; never in the way, never out of it; Rab subsided under the table into a dark place, and was motionless, all but his eye, which followed every one. Ailie got worse; began to wander in her mind, gently; was more demonstrative in her ways to James, rapid in her questions, and sharp at times. He was vexed, and said, \"She was never that way afore,--no, never.\" For a time she knew her head was wrong, and was always asking our pardon,--the dear, gentle old woman: then delirium set in strong, without pause. Her brain gave way, and then came that terrible spectacle,--      \"The intellectual power, through words and things,      Went sounding on its dim and perilous way;\"  she sang bits of old songs and Psalms, stopping suddenly, mingling the Psalms of David, and the diviner words of his Son and Lord, with homely odds and ends and scraps of ballads.  Nothing more touching, or in a sense more strangely beautiful, did I ever witness. Her tremulous, rapid, affectionate, eager, Scotch voice, the swift, aimless, bewildered mind, the baffled utterance, the bright and perilous eye, some wild words, some household cares, something for James, the names of the dead, Rab called rapidly and in a \"fremyt\" voice, and he starting up, surprised, and slinking off as if he were to blame somehow, or had been dreaming he heard. Many eager questions and beseechings which James and I could make nothing of, and on which she seemed to set her all and then sink back ununderstood. It was very sad, but better than many things that are not called sad. James hovered about, put out and miserable, but active and exact as ever; read to her, when there was a lull, short bits from the Psalms, prose and metre, chanting the latter in his own rude and serious way, showing great knowledge of the fit words, bearing up like a man, and doting over her as his \"ain Ailie.\" \"Ailie, ma woman!\" \"Ma ain bonnie wee dawtie!\"  The end was drawing on: the golden bowl was breaking; the silver cord was fast being loosed; that animula blandula, vagula, hospes, comesque, was about to flee. The body and the soul--companions for sixty years--were being sundered, and taking leave. She was walking, alone, through the valley of that shadow into which one day we must all enter; and yet she was not alone, for we know whose rod and staff were comforting her.  One night she had fallen quiet, and, as we hoped, asleep; her eyes were shut. We put down the gas, and sat watching her. Suddenly she sat up in bed, and, taking a bed-gown which was lying on it rolled up, she held it eagerly to her breast,--to the right side. We could see her eyes bright with a surprising tenderness and joy, bending over this bundle of clothes. She held it as a woman holds her sucking child; opening out her night-gown impatiently, and holding it close, and brooding over it, and murmuring foolish little words, as over one whom his mother comforteth, and who sucks and is satisfied. It was pitiful and strange to see her wasted dying look, keen and yet vague,--her immense love.  \"Preserve me!\" groaned James, giving way. And then she rocked backward and forward, as if to make it sleep, hushing it, and wasting on it her infinite fondness. \"Wae's me, doctor! I declare she's thinkin' it's that bairn.\" \"What bairn?\" \"The only bairn we ever had; our wee Mysie, and she's in the Kingdom forty years and mair.\" It was plainly true: the pain in the breast, telling its urgent story to a bewildered, ruined brain, was misread and mistaken; it suggested to her the uneasiness of a breast full of milk, and then the child; and so again once more they were together, and she had her ain wee Mysie in her bosom.  This was the close. She sank rapidly: the delirium left her; but, as she whispered, she was \"clean silly;\" it was the lightening before the final darkness. After having for some time lain still, her eyes shut, she said, \"James!\" He came close to her, and, lifting up her calm, clear, beautiful eyes, she gave him a long look, turned to me kindly but shortly, looked for Rab but could not see him, then turned to her husband again, as if she would never leave off looking, shut her eyes and composed herself. She lay for some time breathing quick, and passed away so gently that, when we thought she was gone, James, in his old-fashioned way, held the mirror to her face. After a long pause, one small spot of dimness was breathed out; it vanished away, and never returned, leaving the blank clear darkness without a stain. \"What is our life? it is even a vapor, which appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.\"  Rab all this time had been fully awake and motionless: he came forward beside us: Ailie's hand, which James had held, was hanging down; it was soaked with his tears; Rab licked it all over carefully, looked at her, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5424"],["title","Icelandic Primer with Grammar, Notes and Glossary (#1)"],["body"," [Footnote 3: Many of the _i_'s which appear in derivative and inflectional syllables are late weakenings of _a_ and other vowels, as in _bani_ (death) = Old English _bana_; these do not cause mutation.]  *a* (*ǫ*) ... *ę* :-- _mann_ (man _acc._), _męnn_ (men); _hǫnd_ (hand), _hęndr_ (hands).  *ā* ... *æ* :-- _māl_ (speech), _mæla_ (speak).  *e* (*ja*, *jǫ*) ... *i* :-- _verðr_ (worth), _virða_ (estimate).  *u* (*o*) ... *y* :-- _fullr_ (full), _fylla_ (to fill); _lopt_ (air), _lypta_ (lift).  *ū* ... *ȳ* :-- _brūn_ (eyebrow), pl. _brȳnn_.  *o* ... *ö* :-- _koma_ (to come), _kömr_ (comes).  *ō* ... *œ* :-- _fōr_ (went), _fœra_ (bring).  *au* ... *ey* :-- _lauss_ (loose), _leysa_ (loosen).  *jū* (*jō*) ... *ȳ* :-- _sjūkr_ (sick), _sȳki_ (sickness); _ljōsta_ (strike), _lȳstr_ (strikes).  23. The change of _a_ into _ę_ is sometimes the result of a following _k_, _g_, or _ng_, as in _dęgi_ dat. sg. of _dagr_ (day), _tękinn_ (taken), _gęnginn_ (gone), inf. _taka_, _ganga_. _i_ appears instead of _e_, and _u_ instead of _o_ before a nasal followed by another cons.: cp. _binda_ (to bind), _bundinn_ (bound) with _bresta_ (burst) ptc. prt. _brostinn_.  24. There is also a *u*-mutation, caused by a following _u_, which has often been dropped:  *a* ... *ǫ* :-- _dagr_ (day) dat. pl. _dǫgum_; _land_ (land) pl. _lǫnd_.  25. Unaccented _ǫ_ becomes _u_, as in _sumur_ pl. of _sumar_ (summer), _kǫlluðu_ (they called), infin. _kalla_.  Fracture  26. The only vowel that is affected by fracture is _e_: when followed by original _a_ it becomes _ja_, when followed by original _u_ it becomes _jǫ_, as in _jarðar_ gen. of _jǫrð_ (earth)[4].  When followed by original _i_, the _e_ is, of course, mutated to _i_, as in _skildir_ plur. nom. of _skjǫldr_ (shield), gen. _skjaldar_.  [Footnote 4: Cp. German _erde_.]  Gradation  27. By gradation the vowels are related as follows:--  *a* ... *ō* :-- _fara_ (go) pret. _fōr_, whence by mut. _fœra_ (bring).  *e* (i, ja) ... *a* ... *u* (o) :-- _bresta_ (burst), prt. _brast_, prt. pl. _brustu_, ptc. prt. _brostinn_; _finna_ (find), _fundinn_ (found _ptc._), _fundr_ (meeting).  *e* ... *a* ... *ā* ... *o* :-- _stela_ (steal), prt. _stal_, prt. pl. _stālu_, ptc. prt. _stolinn_.  *e* ... *a* ... *ā* ... *e* :-- _gefa_ (give), _gaf_ (he gave), _gāfu_ (they gave), _gefinn_ (given), _gjǫf_ (gift), _u_-fracture of _gef-_, _gæfa_ (luck) mut. of _gāf-_.  *ī* ... *ei* ... *i* :-- _skīna_ (shine), _skein_ (he shone), _skinu_ (they shone).  _sōl-skin_ (sunshine).  *jū* (jō) ... *au* ... *u* ... *o* :-- _ljūga_ (tell a lie), prt. _laug_, prt. pl. _lugu_, ptc. prt. _loginn_.  _lygi_ (lie _sbst._) mut. of _lug-_.  _skjōta_ (shoot), _skjōtr_ (swift), _skotinn_ (shot _ptc._), _skot_ (shot _subst._).  Other changes  28. All final vowels are long in accented syllables: _þā_ (then), _nū_ (now).  29. Inflectional and derivative vowels are often dropt after long accented vowels: cp. _ganga_ (to go) with _fā_ (to get), the dat. plurals _knjām_ (knees) with _hūsum_ (houses).  30. Vowels are often lengthened before _l_ + cons.: _hālfr_ (half _adj._), _fōlk_ (people); cp. _fōlginn_ (hidden) with _brostinn_ (burst _ptc._).  Consonants  31. _v_ is dropped before _o_ and _u_: _vaxa_ (to grow), prt. _ōx_, _vinna_ (to win), _unninn_ (won _ptc._), _svelta_ (to starve), _soltinn_ (starved, hungry).  Final _r_ is often assimilated to a preceding cons.  32. _*-lr_, _*-nr_, _*-sr_ always become _-ll_, _-nn_, _-ss_ after a long vowel or diphthong, as in _stōll_ (chair _nom._), acc. _stōl_, _steinn_ (stone _nom._), acc. _stein_, _vīss_ (wise _masc. nom. sg._), _vīs_ fem. nom. sg., and in unacc. syllables, as in the masc. sg. nominatives _mikill_ (great), fem. _mikil_, _borinn_ (carried), fem.  _borin_, _ȳmiss_ (various) fem. _ȳmis_.  33. Words in which _l_, _n_, _r_, _s_ are preceded by a cons. drop the _r_ entirely, as in the masc. nominatives _jarl_ (earl), _hrafn_ (raven), _vitr_ (wise), _þurs_ (giant), _lax_ (salmon).  34. If _l_ and _n_ are preceded by a short accented vowel, the _r_ is generally kept, as in _stelr_ (steals), _vinr_, (friend), _sr_ becoming _ss_, as elsewhere.  35. _r_ is kept after _ll_, and generally after _nn_, as in the masc. nom. _allr_ (all), and in _bręnnr_ (burns).  36. _z_ often stands for _ðs_ as well as _ts_, as in _þēr þykkizk_ (ye seem) = _*þykkið-sk_, _Vest-firzkr_ (belonging to the West Firths) = _-*firðskr_ (_fǫrðr_, firth).  37. Inflectional _t_ is generally doubled after a long accented vowel: _fār_ (few) neut. _fātt_ (cp. _allr_ 'all,' neut. _allt_), _sā_ (I saw), _sātt_ 'thou sawest.'   INFLECTIONS  Nouns  38. *Gender*.  There are three genders in Icelandic--masculine, feminine, and neuter.  The gender is partly natural, partly grammatical, generally agreeing with the gender in Old English. Compound words follow the gender of their last element.  39. *Strong and Weak*.  All weak nouns end in a vowel in the nom. sg. and in most of the other cases as well.  Most strong nouns end in a cons. in the nom. sg.  40. *Cases*.  There are four cases--nominative, accusative, dative, genitive.  All nouns (except a few contractions) have the gen. pl. in _-a_ (_fiska_, of fishes), and the dat. pl. in _-um_ (_fiskum_).  All strong masculines (_fiskr_) and some strong feminines (_brūðr_, bride) take _r_[5] in the nom. sg.  Most strong feminines show the bare root in the nom. sg. with _u_-mutation, if possible (_āst_, favour, _fǫr_, journey).  The nom. pl. of all strong masc. and fem. nouns ends in _r_ (_fiskar_, _āstir_).  The acc. pl. of fem. nouns is the same as the nom. pl. (_āstir_). The acc. pl. of masc. strong nouns always ends in a vowel (_fiska_).  The plur. nom. and acc. of neuters is the same as the sing. nom. and acc., except that in the plur. nom. and acc. they take _u_-mutation, if possible (_hūs_, houses, _lǫnd_, lands).  [Footnote 5: Subject, of course, to the assimilations described above.]  41. The declensions are most conveniently distinguished by the acc. plur.

Dissyllables in _-r_, _-l_, _-n_ generally throw out the preceding vowel before a vowel-inflection: _hamarr_ (hammer), dat. _hamri_; _jǫtunn_ (giant), pl. nom. _jǫtnar_.  _kętill_ (kettle) and _lykill_ (key) show unmutated vowels in the contracted forms, as in the acc. plur. _katla_, _lukla_.  44. Some nouns of this decl. take _-ar_ in the gen. sing., especially proper names, such as _Hākon_, gen. _Hākonar_.  45. Some nouns add _v_ before vowels: _sær_ (sea), gen. _sævar_.  46. The dat. sometimes drops the _i_: _sæ_ (sea), _Þōr_.  _dagr_ (day) mutates its vowel in the dat. _dęgi_.  47. Nouns in _-ir_ keep the _i_ in the sing., and drop it in the plur.:                SINGULAR                 PLURAL        _Nom._  hęlli-r (_cave_)         hęll-ar       _Acc._  hęlli                    hęll-a       _Dat._  hęlli                    hęll-um       _Gen._  hęlli-s                  hęll-a  48.

So also _gripr_ (precious thing), _salr_ (hall).  50. _gęstr_ (guest) takes _-i_ in the dat. sg., and _-s_ in the gen. sg.  51. Those ending in _g_ or _k_ (together with some others) insert _j_ before _a_ and _u_: _bękkr_ (bench), _bękk_, _bękk_, _bękkjar_; _bękkir_, _bękki_, _bękkjum_, _bękkja_.
