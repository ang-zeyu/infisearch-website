Her carpets were made of sky-blue and silver brocade from Damascus, the seats and couches were covered with stuff embroidered in feathers by the Ethiopian women, which looked like the breasts of birds.  The images of the Goddess Hathor, which stood on the house-altar, were of an imitation of emerald, which was called Mafkat, and the other little figures, which were placed near their patroness, were of lapis-lazuli, malachite, agate and bronze, overlaid with gold.  On her toilet-table stood a collection of salve-boxes, and cups of ebony and ivory finely carved, and everything was arranged with the utmost taste, and exactly suited Nefert herself.  Bent-Anat's room also suited the owner.  It was high and airy, and its furniture consisted in costly but simple necessaries; the lower part of the wall was lined with cool tiles of white and violet earthen ware, on each of which was pictured a star, and which, all together, formed a tasteful pattern.  Above these the walls were covered with a beautiful dark green material brought from Sais, and the same stuff was used to cover the long divans by the wall.  Chairs and stools, made of cane, stood round a very large table in the middle of this room, out of which several others opened; all handsome, comfortable, and harmonious in aspect, but all betraying that their mistress took small pleasure in trifling decorations.  But her chief delight was in finely-grown plants, of which rare and magnificent specimens, artistically arranged on stands, stood in the corners of many of the rooms.  In others there were tall obelisks of ebony, which bore saucers for incense, which all the Egyptians loved, and which was prescribed by their physicians to purify and perfume their dwellings.  Her simple bedroom would have suited a prince who loved floriculture, quite as well as a princess.  Before all things Bent-Anat loved air and light.  The curtains of her windows and doors were only closed when the position of the sun absolutely required it; while in Nefert's rooms, from morning till evening, a dim twilight was maintained.  The princess went affectionately towards the charioteer's wife, who bowed low before her at the threshold; she took her chin with her right hand, kissed her delicate narrow forehead, and said:  \"Sweet creature!  At last you have come uninvited to see lonely me! It is the first time since our men went away to the war.  If Rameses' daughter commands there is no escape; and you come; but of your own free will--\"  Nefert raised her large eyes, moist with tears, with an imploring look, and her glance was so pathetic that Bent-Anat interrupted herself, and taking both her hands, exclaimed:  \"Do you know who must have eyes exactly like yours?  I mean the Goddess from whose tears, when they fall on the earth, flowers spring.\"  Nefert's eyes fell and she blushed deeply.  \"I wish,\" she murmured, \"that my eyes might close for ever, for I am very unhappy.\"  And two large tears rolled down her cheeks.  \"What has happened to you, my darling?\"  asked the princess sympathetically, and she drew her towards her, putting her arm round her like a sick child.  Nefert glanced anxiously at the chamberlain, and the ladies in waiting who had entered the room with her, and Bent-Anat understood the look; she requested her attendants to withdraw, and when she was alone with her sad little friend--\"Speak now,\" she said.  \"What saddens your heart?  how comes this melancholy expression on your dear baby face?  Tell me, and I will comfort you, and you shall be my bright thoughtless plaything once more.\"  \"Thy plaything!\" answered Nefert, and a flash of displeasure sparkled in her eyes.  \"Thou art right to call me so, for I deserve no better name. I have submitted all my life to be nothing but the plaything of others.\"  \"But, Nefert, I do not know you again,\" cried Bent-Anat.  \"Is this my gentle amiable dreamer?\"  \"That is the word I wanted,\" said Nefert in a low tone.  \"I slept, and dreamed, and dreamed on--till Mena awoke me; and when he left me I went to sleep again, and for two whole years I have lain dreaming; but to-day I have been torn from my dreams so suddenly and roughly, that I shall never find any rest again.\"  While she spoke, heavy tears fell slowly one after another over her cheeks.  Bent-Anat felt what she saw and heard as deeply as if Nefert were her own suffering child.  She lovingly drew the young wife down by her side on the divan, and insisted on Nefert's letting her know all that troubled her spirit.  Katuti's daughter had in the last few hours felt like one born blind, and who suddenly receives his sight.  He looks at the brightness of the sun, and the manifold forms of the creation around him, but the beams of the day-star blind its eyes, and the new forms, which he has sought to guess at in his mind, and which throng round him in their rude reality, shock him and pain him.  To-day, for the first time, she had asked herself wherefore her mother, and not she herself, was called upon to control the house of which she nevertheless was called the mistress, and the answer had rung in her ears: \"Because Mena thinks you incapable of thought and action.\"  He had often called her his little rose, and she felt now that she was neither more nor less than a flower that blossoms and fades, and only charms the eye by its color and beauty.  \"My mother,\" she said to Bent-Anat, \"no doubt loves me, but she has managed badly for Mena, very badly; and I, miserable idiot, slept and dreamed of Mena, and saw and heard nothing of what was happening to his --to our--inheritance.  Now my mother is afraid of my husband, and those whom we fear, says my uncle, we cannot love, and we are always ready to believe evil of those we do not love.  So she lends an ear to those people who blame Mena, and say of him that he has driven me out of his heart, and has taken a strange woman to his tent.  But it is false and a lie; and I cannot and will not countenance my own mother even, if she embitters and mars what is left to me--what supports me--the breath and blood of my life--my love, my fervent love for my husband.\"  Bent-Anat had listened to her without interrupting her; she sat by her for a time in silence.  Then she said:  \"Come out into the gallery; then I will tell you what I think, and perhaps Toth may pour some helpful counsel into my mind.  I love you, and I know you well, and though I am not wise, I have my eyes open and a strong hand.  Take it, come with me on to the balcony.\"  A refreshing breeze met the two women as they stepped out into the air. It was evening, and a reviving coolness had succeeded the heat of the day.  The buildings and houses already cast long shadows, and numberless boats, with the visitors returning from the Necropolis, crowded the stream that rolled its swollen flood majestically northwards.  Close below lay the verdant garden, which sent odors from the rose-beds up to the princess's balcony.  A famous artist had laid it out in the time of Hatasu, and the picture which he had in his mind, when he sowed the seeds and planted the young shoots, was now realized, many decades after his death.  He had thought of planning a carpet, on which the palace should seem to stand.  Tiny streams, in bends and curves, formed the outline of the design, and the shapes they enclosed were filled with plants of every size, form, and color; beautiful plats of fresh green turf everywhere represented the groundwork of the pattern, and flower- beds and clumps of shrubs stood out from them in harmonious mixtures of colors, while the tall and rare trees, of which Hatasu's ships had brought several from Arabia, gave dignity and impressiveness to the whole.  Clear drops sparkled on leaf and flower and blade, for, only a short time before, the garden by Bent-Anat's house had been freshly watered.  The Nile beyond surrounded an island, where flourished the well-kept sacred grove of Anion.  The Necropolis on the farther side of the river was also well seen from Bent-Anat's balcony.  There stood in long perspective the rows of sphinxes, which led from the landing-place of the festal barges to the gigantic buildings of Amenophis III. with its colossi--the hugest in Thebes--to the House of Seti, and to the temple of Hatasu.  There lay the long workshops of the embalmers and closely-packed homes of the inhabitants of the City of the Dead.  In the farthest west rose the Libyan mountains with their innumerable graves, and the valley of the kings' tombs took a wide curve behind, concealed by a spur of the hills.  The two women looked in silence towards the west.  The sun was near the horizon--now it touched it, now it sank behind the hills; and as the heavens flushed with hues like living gold, blazing rubies, and liquid garnet and amethyst, the evening chant rang out from all the temples, and the friends sank on their knees, hid their faces in the bower-rose garlands that clung to the trellis, and prayed with full hearts.  When they rose night was spreading over the landscape, for the twilight is short in Thebes.  Here and there a rosy cloud fluttered across the darkening sky, and faded gradually as the evening star appeared.  \"I am content,\" said Bent-Anat.  \"And you?  have you recovered your peace of mind?\"  Nefert shook her head.  The princess drew her on to a seat, and sank down beside her.  Then she began again \"Your heart is sore, poor child; they have spoilt the past for you, and you dread the future.  Let me be frank with you, even if it gives you pain.  You are sick, and I must cure you. Will you listen to me?\"  \"Speak on,\" said Nefert.  \"Speech does not suit me so well as action,\" replied the princess; \"but I believe I know what you need, and can help you.  You love your husband; duty calls him from you, and you feel lonely and neglected; that is quite natural.  But those whom I love, my father and my brothers, are also gone to the war; my mother is long since dead; the noble woman,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5444"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 06 (#1)"],["body","the wine back to her daughter, saying good-humoredly:  \"I have tasted sweeter, but acid is refreshing in this heat.\"  \"That is true,\" said the wife of Mena; she emptied the cup to the bottom, and then went on, as if refreshed, \"But I will tell you the rest of my dream.  I saw the Neha-tree, which your father gave me, quite plainly; nay I could have declared that I smelt its perfume, but the interpreter assured me that we never smell in our dreams.  I went up to the beautiful tree in admiration.  Then suddenly a hundred axes appeared in the air, wielded by unseen hands, and struck the poor tree with such violence that the branches one by one fell to the ground, and at last the trunk itself was felled.  If you think it grieved me you are mistaken.  On the contrary, I was delighted with the flashing hatchets and the flying splinters.  When at last nothing was left but the roots in the tub of earth, I perceived that the tree was rising to new life.  Suddenly my arms became strong, my feet active, and I fetched quantities of water from the tank, poured it over the roots, and when, at last, I could exert myself no longer, a tender green shoot showed itself on the wounded root, a bud appeared, a green leaf unfolded itself, a juicy stem sprouted quickly, it became a firm trunk, sent out branches and twigs, and these became covered with leaves and flowers, white, red and blue; then various birds came and settled on the top of the tree, and sang.  Ah! my heart sang louder than the birds at that moment, and I said to myself that without me the tree would have been dead, and that it owed its life to me.\"  \"A beautiful dream,\" said Katuti; \"that reminds me of your girlhood, when you would he awake half the night inventing all sorts of tales.  What interpretation did the priest give you?\"  \"He promised me many things,\" said Nefert, \"and he gave me the assurance that the happiness to which I am predestined shall revive in fresh beauty after many interruptions.\"  \"And Paaker's father gave you the Neha-tree?\"  asked Katuti, leaving the veranda as she spoke and walking out into the garden.  \"My father brought it to Thebes from the far cast,\" said Paaker, in confirmation of the widow's parting words.  \"And that is exactly what makes me so happy,\" said Nefert.  \"For your father was as kind, and as dear to me as if he had been my own.  Do you remember when we were sailing round the pond, and the boat upset, and you pulled me senseless out of the water?  Never shall I forget the expression with which the great man looked at me when I woke up in its arms; such wise true eyes no one ever had but he.\"  \"He was good, and he loved you very much,\" said Paaker, recalling, for his part, the moment when he had dared to press a kiss on the lips of the sweet unconscious child.  \"And I am so glad,\" Nefert went on, \"that the day has come at last when we can talk of him together again, and when the old grudge that lay so heavy in my heart is all forgotten.  How good you are to us, I have already learned; my heart overflows with gratitude to you, when I remember my childhood, and I can never forget that I was indebted to you for all that was bright and happy in it.  Only look at the big dog--poor Descher!--how he rubs against me, and shows that he has not forgotten me! Whatever comes from your house fills my mind with pleasant memories.\"  \"We all love you dearly,\" said Paaker looking at her tenderly.  \"And how sweet it was in your garden!\"  cried Nefert.  \"The nosegay here that you have brought me shall be placed in water, and preserved a long time, as greeting from the place in which once I could play carelessly, and dream so happily.\"  With these words she pressed the flowers to her lips; Paaker sprang forward, seized her hand, and covered it with burning kisses.  Nefert started and drew away her hand, but he put out his arm to clasp her to him.  He had touched her with his trembling hand, when loud voices were heard in the garden, and Nemu hurried in to announce he arrival of the princess Bent-Anat.  At the same moment Katuti appeared, and in a few minutes the princess herself.  Paaker retreated, and quitted the room before Nefert had time to express her indignation.  He staggered to his chariot like a drunken man.  He supposed himself beloved by Mena's wife, his heart was full of triumph, he proposed rewarding Hekt with gold, and went to the palace without delay to crave of Ani a mission to Syria.  There it should be brought to the test--he or Mena.     CHAPTER XXV.  While Nefert, frozen with horror, could not find a word of greeting for her royal friend, Bent-Anat with native dignity laid before the widow her choice of Nefert to fill the place of her lost companion, and desired that Mena's wife should go to the palace that very day.  She had never before spoken thus to Katuti, and Katuti could not overlook the fact that Bent-Anat had intentionally given up her old confidential tone.  \"Nefert has complained of me to her,\" thought she to herself, \"and she considers me no longer worthy of her former friendly kindness.\"  She was vexed and hurt, and though she understood the danger which threatened her, now her daughter's eyes were opened, still the thought of losing her child inflicted a painful wound.  It was this which filled her eyes with tears, and sincere sorrow trembled in her voice as she replied:  \"Thou hast required the better half of my life at my hand; but thou hast but to command, and I to obey.\"  Bent-Anat waved her hand proudly, as if to confirm the widow's statement; but Nefert went up to her mother, threw her arms round her neck, and wept upon her shoulder.  Tears glistened even in the princess's eyes when Katuti at last led her daughter towards her, and pressed yet one more kiss on her forehead.  Bent-Anat took Nefert's hand, and did not release it, while she requested the widow to give her daughter's dresses and ornaments into the charge of the slaves and waiting-women whom she would send for them.  \"And do not forget the case with the dried flowers, and my amulets, and the images of the Gods,\" said Nefert.  \"And I should like to have the Neha tree which my uncle gave me.\"  Her white cat was playing at her feet with Paaker's flowers, which she had dropped on the floor, and when she saw her she took her up and kissed her.  \"Bring the little creature with you,\" said Bent-Anat.  \"It was your favorite plaything.\"  \"No,\" replied Nefert coloring.  The princess understood her, pressed her hand, and said while she pointed to Nemu:  \"The dwarf is your own too: shall he come with you?\"  \"I will give him to my mother,\" said Nefert.  She let the little man kiss her robe and her feet, once more embraced Katuti, and quitted the garden with her royal friend.  As soon as Katuti was alone, she hastened into the little chapel in which the figures of her ancestors stood, apart from those of Mena.  She threw herself down before the statue of her husband, half weeping, half thankful.  This parting had indeed fallen heavily on her soul, but at the same time it released her from a mountain of anxiety that had oppressed her breast. Since yesterday she had felt like one who walks along the edge of a precipice, and whose enemy is close at his heels; and the sense of freedom from the ever threatening danger, soon got the upperhand of her maternal grief.  The abyss in front of her had suddenly closed; the road to the goal of her efforts lay before her smooth and firm beneath her feet.  The widow, usually so dignified, hastily and eagerly walked down the garden path, and for the first time since that luckless letter from the camp had reached her, she could look calmly and clearly at the position of affairs, and reflect on the measures which Ani must take in the immediate future.  She told herself that all was well, and that the time for prompt and rapid action was now come.  When the messengers came from the princess she superintended the packing of the various objects which Nefert wished to have, with calm deliberation, and then sent her dwarf to Ani, to beg that he would visit her.  But before Nemu had left Mena's grounds he saw the out-runners of the Regent, his chariot, and the troop of guards following him.  Very soon Katuti and her noble friend were walking up and down in the garden, while she related to him how Bent-Anat had taken Nefert from her, and repeated to him all that she had planned and considered during the last hour.  \"You have the genius of a man,\" said Ani; \"and this time you do not urge me in vain.  Ameni is ready to act, Paaker is to-day collecting his troops, to-morrow he will assist at the feast of the Valley, and the next day he goes to Syria.\"  \"He has been with you?\"  Katuti asked.  \"He came to the palace on leaving your house,\" replied Ani, \"with glowing cheeks, and resolved to the utmost; though he does not dream that I hold him in my hand.\"  Thus speaking they entered the veranda, in which Nemu had remained, and he now hid himself as usual behind the ornamental shrubs to overhear them.  They sat down near each other, by Nefert's breakfast table, and Ani asked Katuti whether the dwarf had told her his mother's secret. Katuti feigned ignorance, listened to the story of the love-philter, and played the part of the alarmed mother very cleverly.  The Regent was of opinion, while he tried to soothe her, that there was no real love-potion in the case; but the widow exclaimed:  \"Now I understand, now for the first time I comprehend my daughter. Paaker must have poured the drink into her wine, for she had no sooner drunk it this morning than she was quite altered her words to Paaker had quite a tender ring in them; and if he placed himself so cheerfully at your disposal it is because he believes himself certainly to be beloved by my daughter.  The old witch's potion was effectual.\"  \"There certainly are such drinks--\" said Ani thoughtfully.  \"But will they only win hearts to young men!  If that is the case, the old woman's trade "]]]
