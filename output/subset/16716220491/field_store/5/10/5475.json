She carried a little basket in which lay the gold ornaments she had worn at the festival, and which she had to restore to the keeper of the temple- treasure.  My pomegranate-flower, which she had accepted in the morning, shone upon me from afar, and then, when she caught sight of me and blushed all over, casting down her eyes, then it was that it first struck me 'just like the Hebe on our cistern.'  \"She wanted to pass me, but I detained her, begging her to show me the ornaments in her hand; I said a number of things such as girls like to hear, and then I asked her if she were strictly watched, and whether they gave her delicate little hands and feet--which were worthy of better occupation than water-carrying--a great deal to do.  She did not hesitate to answer, but with all she said she rarely raised her eyes.  The longer you look at her the lovelier she is--and yet she is still a mere child- though a child certainly who no longer loves staying at home, who has dreams of splendor, and enjoyment, and freedom while she is kept shut up in a dismal, dark place, and left to starve.  \"The poor creatures may never quit the temple excepting for a procession, or before sunrise.  It sounded too delightful when she said that she was always so horribly tired, and so glad to go to sleep again after she was waked, and had to go out at once just when it is coldest, in the twilight before sunrise.  Then she has to draw water from a cistern called the Well of the Sun.\"  \"Do you know where that cistern lies?\"  asked Publius.  \"Behind the acacia-grove,\" answered Lysias.  \"The guide pointed it out to me.  It is said to hold particularly sacred water, which must be poured as a libation to the god at sunrise, unmixed with any other.  The girls must get up so early, that as soon as dawn breaks water from this cistern shall not be lacking at the altar of Serapis.  It is poured out on the earth by the priests as a drink-offering.\"  Publius had listened attentively, and had not lost a word of his friend's narrative.  He now quitted him hastily, opened the tent-door, and went out into the night, looking up to discover the hour from the stars which were silently pursuing their everlasting courses in countless thousands, and sparkling with extraordinary brilliancy in the deep blue sky.  The moon was already set, and the morning-star was slowly rising--every night since the Roman had been in the land of the Pyramids he had admired its magnificent size and brightness.  A cold breeze fanned the young man's brow, and as he drew his robe across his breast with a shiver, he thought of the sisters, who, before long, would have to go out in the fresh morning air.  Once more he raised his eyes from the earth to the firmament over his head, and it seemed to him that he saw before his very eyes the proud form of Klea, enveloped in a mantle sown over with stars.  His heart throbbed high, and he felt as if the breeze that his heaving breast inhaled in deep breaths was as fresh and pure as the ether that floats over Elysium, and of a strange potency withal, as if too rare to breathe.  Still he fancied he saw before him the image of Klea, but as he stretched out his hand towards the beautiful vision it vanished--a sound of hoofs and wheels fell upon his ear. Publius was not accustomed to abandon himself to dreaming when action was needed, and this reminded him of the purpose for which he had come out into the open air.  Chariot after chariot came driving past as he returned into his tent.  Lysias, who during his absence had been pacing up and down and reflecting, met him with the question:  \"How long is it yet till sunrise?\"  Hardly two hours,\" replied the Roman.  \"And we must make good use of them if we would not arrive too late.\"  \"So I think too,\" said the Corinthian.  \"The sisters will soon be at the Well of the Sun outside the temple walls, and I will persuade Irene to follow me.  You think I shall not be successful?  Nor do I myself--but still perhaps she will if I promise to show her something very pretty, and if she does not suspect that she is to be parted from her sister, for she is like a child.\"  \"But Klea,\" interrupted Publius thoughtfully, \"is grave and prudent; and the light tone which you are so ready to adopt will be very little to her taste,  Consider that, and dare the attempt--no, you dare not deceive her.  Tell her the whole truth, out of Irene's hearing, with the gravity the matter deserves, and she will not hinder her sister when she knows how great and how imminent is the danger that threatens her.\"  \"Good!\"  said the Corinthian.  \"I will be so solemnly earnest that the most wrinkled and furrowed graybeard among the censors of your native city shall seem a Dionysiac dancer compared with me.  I will speak like your Cato when he so bitterly complained that the epicures of Rome paid more now for a barrel of fresh herrings than for a yoke of oxen.  You shall be perfectly satisfied with me!--But whither am I to conduct Irene? I might perhaps make use of one of the king's chariots which are passing now by dozens to carry the guests home.\"  \"I also had thought of that,\" replied Publius.  \"Go with the chief of the Diadoches, whose splendid house was shown to us yesterday.  It is on the way to the Serapeum, and just now at the feast you were talking with him incessantly.  When there, indemnify the driver by the gift of a gold piece, so that he may not betray us, and do not return here but proceed to the harbor.  I will await you near the little temple of Isis with our travelling chariot and my own horses, will receive Irene, and conduct her to some new refuge while you drive back Fuergetes' chariot, and restore it to the driver.\"  \"That will not satisfy me by any means,\" said Lysias very gravely; \"I was ready to give up my pomegranate-flower to you yesterday for Irene, but herself--\"  \"I want nothing of her,\" exclaimed Publius annoyed.  \"But you might--it seems to me--be rather more zealous in helping me to preserve her from the misfortune which threatens her through your own blunder.  We cannot bring her here, but I think that I have thought of a safe hiding-place for her.  \"Do you remember Apollodorus, the sculptor, to whom we were recommended by my father, and his kind and friendly wife who set before us that capital Chios wine?  The man owes me a service, for my father commissioned him and his assistants to execute the mosaic pavement in the new arcade he was having built in the capitol; and subsequently, when the envy of rival artists threatened his life, my father saved him.  You yourself heard him say that he and his were all at my disposal.\"  \"Certainly, certainly,\" said Lysias.  \"But say, does it not strike you as most extraordinary that artists, the very men, that is to say, who beyond all others devote themselves to ideal aims and efforts, are particularly ready to yield to the basest impulses; envy, detraction, and--\"  \"Man!\" exclaimed Publius, angrily interrupting the Greek, \"can you never for ten seconds keep on the same subject, and never keep anything to yourself that comes into your head?  We have just now, as it seems to me, more important matters to discuss than the jealousy of each other shown by artists--and in my opinion, by learned men too.  The sculptor Apollodorus, who is thus beholden to me, has been living here for the last six months with his wife and daughters, for he has been executing for Philometor the busts of the philosophers, and the animal groups to decorate the open space in front of the tomb of Apis.  His sons are managers of his large factory in Alexandria, and when he next goes there, down the Nile in his boat, as often happens, he can take Irene with him, and put her on board a ship.  \"As to where we can have her taken to keep her safe from Euergetes, we will talk that over afterwards with Apollodorus.\"  \"Good, very good,\" agreed the Corinthian.  \"By Heracles!  I am not suspicious--still it does not altogether please me that you should yourself conduct Irene to Apollodorus, for if you are seen in her company our whole project may be shipwrecked.  Send the sculptor's wife, who is little known in Memphis, to the temple of Isis, and request her to bring a veil and cloak to conceal the girl.  Greet the gay Milesian from me too, and tell her--no, tell her nothing--I shall see her myself afterwards at the temple of Isis.\"  During the last words of this conversation, slaves had been enveloping the two young men in their mantles.  They now quitted the tent together, wished each other success, and set out at a brisk pace; the Roman to have his horses harnessed, and Lysias to accompany the chief of the Diadoches in one of the king's chariots, and then to act on the plan he had agreed upon with Publius.     CHAPTER XIII.  Chariot after chariot hurried out of the great gate of the king's palace and into the city, now sunk in slumber.  All was still in the great banqueting-hall, and dark-hued slaves began with brooms and sponges to clean the mosaic pavement, which was strewed with rose leaves and with those that had fallen from the faded garlands of ivy and poplar; while here and there the spilt wine shone with a dark gleam in the dim light of the few lamps that had not been extinguished.  A young flute-player, overcome with sleep and wine, still sat in one corner.  The poplar wreath that had crowned his curls had slipped over his pretty face, but even in sleep he still held his flute clasped fast in his fingers.  The servants let him sleep on, and bustled about without noticing him; only"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5463"],["title","The Sisters â€” Volume 3 (#2)"],["body"," overseer pointed to him, and said laughing:  \"His companions went home no more sober than that one.  He is a pretty boy, and pretty Chloes lover besides--she will look for him in vain this morning.\"  \"And to-morrow too perhaps,\" answered another; \"for if the fat king sees her, poor Damon will have seen the last of her.\"  But the fat king, as Euergetes was called by the Alexandrians, and, following their example, by all the rest of Egypt, was not just then thinking of Chloe, nor of any such person; he was in the bath attached to his splendidly fitted residence.  Divested of all clothing, he was standing in the tepid fluid which completely filled a huge basin of white marble.  The clear surface of the perfumed water mirrored statues of nymphs fleeing from the pursuit of satyrs, and reflected the shimmering light of numbers of lamps suspended from the ceiling.  At the upper end of the bath reclined the bearded and stalwart statue of the Nile, over whom the sixteen infant figures--representing the number of ells to which the great Egyptian stream must rise to secure a favorable inundation-- clambered and played to the delight of their noble father Nile and of themselves.  From the vase which supported the arm of the venerable god flowed an abundant stream of cold water, which five pretty lads received in slender alabaster vases, and poured over the head and the enormously prominent muscles of the breast, the back and the arms of the young king who was taking his bath.  \"More, more--again and again,\" cried Euergetes, as the boys began to pause in bringing and pouring the water; and then, when they threw a fresh stream over him, he snorted and plunged with satisfaction, and a perfect shower of jets splashed off him as the blast of his breath sputtered away the water that fell over his face.  At last he shouted out: \"Enough!\"  flung himself with all his force into the water, that spurted up as if a huge block of stone had been thrown into it, held his head for a long time under water, and then went up the marble steps of the bath shaking his head violently and mischievously in his boyish insolence, so as thoroughly to wet his friends and servants who were standing round the margin of the basin; he suffered himself to be wrapped in snowy-white sheets of the thinnest and finest linen, to be sprinkled with costly essences of delicate odor, and then he withdrew into a small room hung all round with gaudy hangings.  There he flung himself on a mound of soft cushions, and said with a deep- drawn breath: \"Now I am happy; and I am as sober again as a baby that has never tasted anything but its mother's milk.  Pindar is right! there is nothing better than water! and it slakes that raging fire which wine lights up in our brain and blood.  Did I talk much nonsense just now, Hierax?\"  The man thus addressed, the commander-in-chief of the royal troops, and the king's particular friend, cast a hesitating glance at the bystanders; but, Euergetes desiring him to speak without reserve, he replied:  \"Wine never weakens the mind of such as you are to the point of folly, but you were imprudent.  It would be little short of a miracle if Philometor did not remark--\"  \"Capital!\" interrupted the king sitting up on his cushions.  \"You, Hierax, and you, Komanus, remain here--you others may go.  But do not go too far off, so as to be close at hand in case I should need you.  In these days as much happens in a few hours as usually takes place in as many years.\"  Those who were thus dismissed withdrew, only the king's dresser, a Macedonian of rank, paused doubtfully at the door, but Euergetes signed to him to retire immediately, calling after him:  \"I am very merry and shall not go to bed.  At three hours after sunrise I expect Aristarchus--and for work too.  Put out the manuscripts that I brought.  Is the Eunuch Eulaeus waiting in the anteroom?  Yes--so much the better!  \"Now we are alone, my wise friends Hierax and Komanus, and I must explain to you that on this occasion, out of pure prudence, you seem to me to have been anything rather than prudent.  To be prudent is to have the command of a wide circle of thought, so that what is close at hand is no more an obstacle than what is remote.  The narrow mind can command only that which lies close under observation; the fool and visionary only that which is far off.  I will not blame you, for even the wisest has his hours of folly, but on this occasion you have certainly overlooked that which is at hand, in gazing at the distance, and I see you stumble in consequence.  If you had not fallen into that error you would hardly have looked so bewildered when, just now, I exclaimed 'Capital!'  \"Now, attend to me.  Philometor and my sister know very well what my humor is, and what to expect of me.  If I had put on the mask of a satisfied man they would have been surprised, and have scented mischief, but as it was I showed myself to them exactly what I always am and even more reckless than usual, and talked of what I wanted so openly that they may indeed look forward to some deed of violence at my hands but hardly to a treacherous surprise, and that tomorrow; for he who falls on his enemy in the rear makes no noise about it.  \"If I believed in your casuistry, I might think that to attack the enemy from behind was not a particularly fine thing to do, for even I would rather see a man's face than his rear--particularly in the case of my brother and sister, who are both handsome to look upon.  But what can a man do?  After all, the best thing to do is what wins the victory and makes the game.  Indeed, my mode of warfare has found supporters among the wise.  If you want to catch mice you must waste bacon, and if we are to tempt men into a snare we must know what their notions and ideas are, and begin by endeavoring to confuse them.  \"A bull is least dangerous when he runs straight ahead in his fury; while his two-legged opponent is least dangerous when he does not know what he is about and runs feeling his way first to the right and then to the left.  Thanks to your approval--for I have deserved it, and I hope to be able to return it, my friend Hierax.  I am curious as to your report. Shake up the cushion here under my head--and now you may begin.\"  \"All appears admirably arranged,\" answered the general.  \"The flower of our troops, the Diadoches and Hetairoi, two thousand-five hundred men, are on their way hither, and by to-morrow will encamp north of Memphis. Five hundred will find their way into the citadel, with the priests and other visitors to congratulate you on your birthday, the other two thousand will remain concealed in the tents.  The captain of your brother Philometor's Philobasilistes is bought over, and will stand by us; but his price was high--Komanus was forced to offer him twenty talents before he would bite.\"  \"He shall have them,\" said the king laughing, \"and he shall keep them too, till it suits me to regard him as suspicious, and to reward him according to his deserts by confiscating his estates.  Well! proceed.\"  \"In order to quench the rising in Thebes, the day before yesterday Philometor sent the best of the mercenaries with the standards of Desilaus and Arsinoe to the South.  Certainly it cost not a little to bribe the ringleaders, and to stir up the discontent to an outbreak.\"  \"My brother will repay us for this outlay,\" interrupted the king, \"when we pour his treasure into our own coffers.  Go on.\"  \"We shall have most difficulty with the priests and the Jews.  The former cling to Philometor, because he is the eldest son of his father, and has given large bounties to the temples, particularly of Apollinopolis and Philae; the Jews are attached to him, because he favors them more than the Greeks, and he, and his wife--your illustrious sister--trouble themselves with their vain religious squabbles; he disputes with them about the doctrines contained in their book, and at table too prefers conversing with them to any one else.\"  \"I will salt the wine and meat for them that they fatten on here,\" cried Euergetes vehemently, \"I forbade to-day their presence at my table, for they have good eyes and wits as sharp as their noses.  And they are most dangerous when they are in fear, or can reckon on any gains.  \"At the same time it cannot be denied that they are honest and tenacious, and as most of them are possessed of some property they rarely make common cause with the shrieking mob--particularly here in Alexandria.  \"Envy alone can reproach them for their industry and enterprise, for the activity of the Hellenes has improved upon the example set by them and their Phoenician kindred.  \"They thrive best in peaceful times, and since the world runs more quietly here, under my brother and sister, than under me, they attach themselves to them, lend my brother money, and supply my sister with cut stones, sapphires and emeralds, selling fine stuffs and other woman's gear for a scrap of written papyrus, which will soon be of no more value than the feather which falls from the wing of that green screaming bird on the perch yonder.  \"It is incomprehensible to me that so keen a people cannot perceive that there is nothing permanent but change, nothing so certain as that nothing is certain; and that they therefore should regard their god as the one only god, their own doctrine as absolutely and eternally true, and that they contemn what other peoples believe.  \"These darkened views make fools of them, but certainly good soldiers too--perhaps by reason indeed of this very exalted self-consciousness and their firm reliance on their supreme god.\"  \"Yes, they certainly are,\" assented Hierax.  \"But they serve your brother more willingly, and at a lower price, than us.\"  \"I will show them,\" cried the king, \"that their taste is a perverted and obnoxious one.  I require of the priests that they should instruct the people to be obedient, and to bear their privations patiently; but the Jews,\" and at these"]]]
