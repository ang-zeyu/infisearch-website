The engines were already there. The firemen were heading for the building.  Spray fell back across the street where Pendleton took the chair. \"Beth, please,\" he said in a low voice. \"Change now.\" He tried to go get the other chair, to be sure, but they wouldn't let him.  He fell into the one he'd picked and began crying softly. The sirens stopped. Before he let the ambulance people look at him, he insisted that the chair be looked after.  No trace of Beth was found and Pendleton couldn't explain what had happened. After they let him go, he had the chair sent to his apartment.

It provokes a dream.\"  \"A dream?\"  \"Yes. An incredibly long and detailed dream, in which the patient lives an entire lifetime, and lives it just the way he would like it to be.
