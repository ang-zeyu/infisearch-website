He declared that he had been conscripted by the Rebels, wounded, sent back home, and was now about to be pressed in again. He had taken this method of escaping to our lines. It was a common story enough, but General Mower added in his message that he thought the story fishy. This was because the man's appearance was very striking, and he seemed the type of Confederate fighter who would do and dare anything. He had a wound, which had been a bad one, evidently got from a piece of shell. But they had been able to find nothing on him. Sherman sent back word to keep the man until he could see him in person. It was about nine o'clock last night when I reached the house the General has taken. A prisoner's guard was resting outside, and the hall was full of officers. They said that the General was awaiting me, and pointed to the closed door of a room that had been the dining room. I opened it.  Two candles were burning in pewter sticks on the bare mahogany table. There was the General sitting beside them, with his legs crossed, holding some crumpled tissue paper very near his eyes, and reading. He did not look up when I entered. I was aware of a man standing, tall and straight, just out of range of the candles' rays. He wore the easy dress of a Southern planter, with the broad felt hat. The head was flung back so that there was just a patch of light on the chin, and the lids of the eyes in the shadow were half closed.  My sensations are worth noting. For the moment I felt precisely as I had when I was hit by that bullet in Lauman's charge. I was aware of something very like pain, yet I could not place the cause of it. But this is what since has made me feel queer: you doubtless remember staying at Hollingdean, when I was a boy, and hearing the story of Lord Northwell's daredevil Royalist ancestor,--the one with the lace collar over the dull-gold velvet, and the pointed chin, and the lazy scorn in the eyes. Those eyes are painted with drooping lids. The first time I saw Clarence Colfax I thought of that picture--and now I thought of the picture first.  The General's voice startled me.  \"Major Brice, do you know this gentleman?\" he asked.  \"Yes, General.\"  \"Who is he?\"  \"His name is Colfax, sir--Colonel Colfax, I think\"  \"Thought so,\" said the General.  I have thought much of that scene since, as I am steaming northward over green seas and under cloudless skies, and it has seemed very unreal. I should almost say supernatural when I reflect how I have run across this man again and again, and always opposing him. I can recall just how he looked at the slave auction, which seem, so long ago: very handsome, very boyish, and yet with the air of one to be deferred to. It was sufficiently remarkable that I should have found him in Vicksburg. But now--to be brought face to face with him in this old dining room in Goldsboro! And he a prisoner. He had not moved. I did not know how he would act, but I went up to him and held out my hand, and said.--\"How do you do, Colonel Colfax?\"  I am sure that my voice was not very steady, for I cannot help liking him And then his face lighted up and he gave me his hand. And he smiled at me and again at the General, as much as to say that it was all over. He has a wonderful smile.  \"We seem to run into each other, Major Brice,\" said he.  The pluck of the man was superb. I could see that the General, too, was moved, from the way he looked at him. And he speaks a little more abruptly at such times.  \"Guess that settles it, Colonel,\" he said.  \"I reckon it does, General,\" said Clarence, still smiling. The General turned from him to the table with a kind of jerk and clapped his hand on the tissue paper.  \"These speak for themselves, sir,\" he said. \"It is very plain that they would have reached the prominent citizens for whom they were intended if you had succeeded in your enterprise. You were captured out of uniform You know enough of war to appreciate the risk you ran. Any statement to make?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Call Captain Vaughan, Brice, and ask him to conduct the prisoner back.\"  \"May I speak to him, General?\" I asked. The General nodded.  I asked him if I could write home for him or do anything else. That seemed to touch him. Some day I shall tell you what he said.  Then Vaughan took him out, and I heard the guard shoulder arms and tramp away in the night. The General and I were left alone with the mahogany table between us, and a family portrait of somebody looking down on us from the shadow on the wall. A moist spring air came in at the open windows, and the candles flickered. After a silence, I ventured to say:  \"I hope he won't be shot, General.\"  \"Don't know, Brice,\" he answered. \"Can't tell now. Hate to shoot him, but war is war. Magnificent class he belongs to--pity we should have to fight those fellows.\"  He paused, and drummed on the table. \"Brice,\" said he, \"I'm going to send you to General Grant at City Point with despatches. I'm sorry Dunn went back yesterday, but it can't be helped. Can you start in half an hour?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You'll have to ride to Kinston. The railroad won't be through until to-morrow: I'll telegraph there, and to General Easton at Morehead City. He'll have a boat for you. Tell Grant I expect to run up there in a day or two myself, when things are arranged here. You may wait until I come.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  I turned to go, but Clarence Colfax was on my mind \"General?\"  \"Eh! what?\"  \"General, could you hold Colonel Colfax until I see you again?\"  It was a bold thing to say, and I quaked. And he looked at me in his keen way, through and through \"You saved his life once before, didn't you?\"  \"You allowed me to have him sent home from Vicksburg, sir.\"  He answered with one of his jokes--apropos of something he said on the Court House steps at Vicksburg. Perhaps I shall tell it to you sometime.  \"Well, well,\" he said, \"I'll see, I'll see. Thank God this war is pretty near over. I'll let you know, Brice, before I shoot him.\"  I rode the thirty odd miles to Kinston in--little more than three hours. A locomotive was waiting for me, and I jumped into a cab with a friendly engineer. Soon we were roaring seaward through the vast pine forests. It was a lonely journey, and you were much in my mind. My greatest apprehension was that we might be derailed and the despatches captured; for as fast as our army had advanced, the track of it had closed again, like the wake of a ship at sea. Guerillas were roving about, tearing up ties and destroying bridges.  There was one five-minute interval of excitement when, far down the tunnel through the forest, we saw a light gleaming. The engineer said there was no house there, that it must be a fire. But we did not slacken our speed, and gradually the leaping flames grew larger and redder until we were upon them.  Not one gaunt figure stood between them and us. Not one shot broke the stillness of the night. As dawn broke I beheld the flat, gray waters of the Sound stretching away to the eastward, and there was the boat at the desolate wharf beside the warehouse, her steam rising white in the chill morning air.     CHAPTER XIV  THE SAME, CONTINUED               HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,               CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 28, 1865.  DEAR MOTHER: I arrived here safely the day before yesterday, and I hope that you will soon receive some of the letters I forwarded on that day. It is an extraordinary place, this City Point; a military city sprung up like a mushroom in a winter. And my breath was quite taken away when I first caught sight of it on the high table-land. The great bay in front of it, which the Appomattox helps to make, is a maze of rigging and smoke-pipes, like the harbor of a prosperous seaport. There are gunboats and supply boats, schooners and square-riggers and steamers, all huddled together, and our captain pointed out to me the 'Malvern' flying Admiral Porter's flag. Barges were tied up at the long wharves, and these were piled high with wares and flanked by squat warehouses. Although it was Sunday, a locomotive was puffing and panting along the foot of the ragged bank.  High above, on the flat promontory between the two rivers, is the city of tents and wooden huts, the great trees in their fresh faint green towering above the low roofs. At the point of the bluff a large flag drooped against its staff, and I did not have to be told that this was General Grant's headquarters.  There was a fine steamboat lying at the wharf, and I had hardly stepped ashore before they told me she was President Lincoln's. I read the name on her--the 'River Queen'. Yes, the President is here, too, with his wife and family.  There are many fellows here with whom I was brought up in Boston. I am living with Jack Hancock, whom you will remember well. He is a captain now, and has a beard.  But I must go on with my story. I went straight to General Grant's headquarters,--just a plain, rough slat house such as a contractor might build for a temporary residence. Only the high flagstaff and the Stars and Stripes distinguish it from many others of the same kind. A group of officers stood chatting outside of it, and they told me that the General had walked over to get his mail. He is just as unassuming and democratic as \"my general.\" General Rankin took me into the office, a rude room, and we sat down at the long table there. Presently the door opened, and a man came in with a slouch hat on and his coat unbuttoned. He was smoking a cigar. We rose to our feet, and I saluted.  It was the general-in-chief. He stared at me, but said nothing.  \"General, this is Major Brice of General Sherman's staff. He has brought despatches from Goldsboro,\" said Rankin.  He nodded, took off his hat and laid it on the table, and reached out for the despatches. While reading them he did not move, except to light another cigar. I am getting hardened to unrealities,--perhaps I should"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5396"],["title","The Crisis — Complete (#1)"],["body","ou'd want it, Marse Comyn, when I seed de Cap'n comin',” said he, with the privilege of an old servant. Indeed, the bottle was beneath his arm.  The Colonel smiled.  “Hope you'se well, Cap'n,” said Ephum, as he drew the cork.  “Tolluble, Ephum,” replied the Captain. “But, Ephum--say, Ephum!”  “Yes, sah.”  “How's my little sweetheart, Ephum?”  “Bress your soul, sah,” said Ephum, his face falling perceptibly, “bress your soul, sah, Miss Jinny's done gone to Halcyondale, in Kaintuck, to see her grandma. Ole Ephum ain't de same nigger when she's away.”  The young Captain's face showed as much disappointment as the darkey's.  “Cuss it!” said he, strongly, “if that ain't too bad! I brought her a Creole doll from New Orleans, which Madame Claire said was dressed finer than any one she'd ever seen. All lace and French gewgaws, Colonel. But you'll send it to her?”  “That I will, Lige,” said the Colonel, heartily. “And she shall write you the prettiest note of thanks you ever got.”  “Bless her pretty face,” cried the Captain. “Her health, Colonel! Here's a long life to Miss Virginia Carvel, and may she rule forever! How old did you say this was?” he asked, looking into the glass.  “Over half a century,” said Colonel Carvel.  “If it came from the ruins of Pompeii,” cried Captain Brent, “it might be worthy of her!”  “What an idiot you are about that child, Lige,” said the Colonel, who was not hiding his pleasure. The Colonel could hide nothing. “You ruin her!”  The bluff young Captain put down his glass to laugh.  “Ruin her!” he exclaimed. “Her pa don't ruin her I eh, Ephum? Her pa don't ruin her!”  “Lawsy, Marse Lige, I reckon he's wuss'n any.”  “Ephum,” said the Colonel, pulling his goatee thoughtfully, “you're a damned impertinent nigger. I vow I'll sell you South one of these days. Have you taken that letter to Mr. Renault?” He winked at his friend as the old darkey faded into the darkness of the store, and continued: “Did I ever tell you about Wilson Peale's portrait of my grandmother, Dorothy Carvel, that I saw this summer at my brother Daniel's, in Pennsylvania? Jinny's going to look something like her, sir. Um! She was a fine woman. Black hair, though. Jinny's is brown, like her Ma's.” The Colonel handed a cigar to Captain Brent, and lit one himself. “Daniel has a book my grandfather wrote, mostly about her. Lord, I remember her! She was the queen-bee of the family while she lived. I wish some of us had her spirit.”  “Colonel,” remarked Captain Lige, “what's this I heard on the levee just now about your shootin' at a man named Babcock on the steps here?”  The Colonel became very grave. His face seemed to grow longer as he pulled his goatee.  “He was standing right where you are, sir,” he replied (Captain Lige moved), “and he proposed that I should buy his influence.”  “What did you do?”  Colonel Carvel laughed quietly at the recollection  “Shucks,” said he, “I just pushed him into the streets gave him a little start, and put a bullet past his ear, just to let the trash know the sound of it. Then Russell went down and bailed me out.”  The Captain shook with laughter. But Mr. Eliphalet Hopper's eyes were glued to the mild-mannered man who told the story, and his hair rose under his hat.  “By the way, Lige, how's that boy, Tato? Somehow after I let you have him on the 'Louisiana', I thought I'd made a mistake to let him run the river. Easter's afraid he'll lose the little religion she taught him.”  It was the Captain's turn to be grave.  “I tell you what, Colonel,” said he; “we have to have hands, of course. But somehow I wish this business of slavery had never been started!”  “Sir,” said the Colonel, with some force, “God made the sons of Ham the servants of Japheth's sons forever and forever.”  “Well, well, we won't quarrel about that, sir,” said Brent, quickly. “If they all treated slaves as you do, there wouldn't be any cry from Boston-way. And as for me, I need hands. I shall see you again, Colonel.”  “Take supper with me to-night, Lige,” said Mr. Carvel. “I reckon you'll find it rather lonesome without Jinny.”  “Awful lonesome,” said the Captain. “But you'll show me her letters, won't you?”  He started out, and ran against Eliphalet.  “Hello!” he cried. “Who's this?”  “A young Yankee you landed here this morning, Lige,” said the Colonel. “What do you think of him?”  “Humph!” exclaimed the Captain.  “He has no friends in town, and he is looking for employment. Isn't that so, sonny?” asked the Colonels kindly.  “Yes.”  “Come, Lige, would you take him?” said Mr. Carvel.  The young Captain looked into Eliphalet's face. The dart that shot from his eyes was of an aggressive honesty; and Mr. Hopper's, after an attempt at defiance, were dropped.  “No,” said the Captain.  “Why not, Lige?”  “Well, for one thing, he's been listening,” said Captain Lige, as he departed.  Colonel Carvel began to hum softly to himself:--      “'One said it was an owl, and the other he said nay,      One said it was a church with the steeple torn away,      Look a' there now!'  “I reckon you're a rank abolitionist,” said he to Eliphalet, abruptly.  “I don't see any particular harm in keepin' slaves,” Mr. Hopper replied, shifting to the other foot.  Whereupon the Colonel stretched his legs apart, seized his goatee, pulled his head down, and gazed at him for some time from under his eyebrows, so searchingly that the blood flew to Mr. Hopper's fleshy face. He mopped it with a dark-red handkerchief, stared at everything in the place save the gentleman in front of him, and wondered whether he had ever in his life been so uncomfortable. Then he smiled sheepishly, hated himself, and began to hate the Colonel.  “Ever hear of the Liberator?”  “No, sir,” said Mr. Hopper.  “Where do you come from?” This was downright directness, from which there was no escape.  “Willesden, Massachusetts.”  “Umph! And never heard of Mr. Garrison?”  “I've had to work all my life.”  “What can you do, sonny?”  “I cal'late to sweep out a store. I have kept books,” Mr. Hopper vouchsafed.  “Would you like work here?” asked the Colonel, kindly. The green eyes looked up swiftly, and down again.  “What'll you give me?”  The good man was surprised. “Well,” said he, “seven dollars a week.”  Many a time in after life had the Colonel reason to think over this scene. He was a man the singleness of whose motives could not be questioned. The one and sufficient reason for giving work to a homeless boy, from the hated state of the Liberator, was charity. The Colonel had his moods, like many another worthy man.  The small specks on the horizon sometimes grow into the hugest of thunder clouds. And an act of charity, out of the wisdom of God, may produce on this earth either good or evil.  Eliphalet closed with the bargain. Ephum was called and told to lead the recruit to the presence of Mr. Hood, the manager. And he spent the remainder of a hot day checking invoices in the shipping entrance on Second Street.  It is not our place here to chronicle Eliphalet's faults. Whatever he may have been, he was not lazy. But he was an anomaly to the rest of the young men in the store, for those were days when political sentiments decided fervent loves or hatreds. In two days was Eliphalet's reputation for wisdom made. During that period he opened his mouth to speak but twice. The first was in answer to a pointless question of Mr. Barbo's (aetat 25), to the effect that he, Eliphalet Hopper, was a Pierce Democrat, who looked with complacency on the extension of slavery. This was wholly satisfactory, and saved the owner of these sentiments a broken head. The other time Eliphalet spoke was to ask Mr. Barbo to direct him to a boardinghouse.  “I reckon,” Mr. Barbo reflected, “that you'll want one of them Congregational boarding-houses. We've got a heap of Yankees in the town, and they all flock together and pray together. I reckon you'd ruther go to Miss Crane's nor anywhere.”  Forthwith to Miss Crane's Eliphalet went. And that lady, being a Greek herself, knew a Greek when she saw one. The kind-hearted Barbo lingered in the gathering darkness to witness the game which ensued, a game dear to all New Englanders, comical to Barbo. The two contestants calculated. Barbo reckoned, and put his money on his new-found fellow-clerk. Eliphalet, indeed, never showed to better advantage. The shyness he had used with the Colonel, and the taciturnity practised on his fellow-clerks, he slipped off like coat and waistcoat for the battle. The scene was in the front yard of the third house in Dorcas Row. Everybody knows where Dorcas Row was. Miss Crane, tall, with all the severity of side curls and bombazine, stood like a stone lioness at the gate. In the background, by the steps, the boarders sat, an interested group. Eliphalet girded up his loins, and sharpened his nasal twang to cope with hers. The preliminary sparring was an exchange of compliments, and deceived neither party. It seemed rather to heighten mutual respect.  “You be from Willesden, eh?” said Crane. “I calculate you know the Salters.”  If the truth were known, this evidence of an apparent omniscience rather staggered Eliphalet. But training stood by him, and he showed no dismay. Yes, he knew the Salters, and had drawed many a load out of Hiram Salters' wood-lot to help pay for his schooling.  “Let me see,” said Miss Crane, innocently; “who was it one of them Salters girls married, and lived across the way from the meetin'-house?”  “Spauldin',” was the prompt reply.  “Wal, I want t' know!” cried the spinster: “not Ezra Spauldin'?”  Eliphalet nodded. That nod was one of infinite shrewdness which commended itself to Miss Crane. These courtesies, far from making awkward the material discussion which followed; did not affect it in the least.  “So you want me to board you?” said she, as if in consternation.  Eliphalet calculated, if they could come to terms. And Mr. Barbo keyed himself to enjoyment.  “Single gentlemen,” said she, “pay as high as twelve dollars.”"]]]
