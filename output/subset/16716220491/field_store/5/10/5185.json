I ask you, what more can an idealist want?\"  \"Good morning, Miss Bjorklund.\"  The breakfast tray was crammed with a liter of orange juice, four boiled eggs, six slices of bacon, four pancakes, two pork chops, four slices of toast, a tumbler of vodka, a pot of coffee and two cigars.  \"Ah, Colonel,\" Anastina said as Pashkov fell to, \"why did you let them change your face? It does not become you at all.\"  \"Part of my job. Don't you think I am more handsome now?\"  Anastina laughed shrilly. \"That bulbous nose handsome? What woman could fall in love with a nose like that?\"  \"It shows determination. I wish I had this nose permanently.\"  \"You mustn't talk like that. But I'll ignore your nose if you tell me more about White Sands Proving Grounds, as you promised.\"  \"With pleasure, with pleasure,\" he said, sinking his teeth into a pork chop, having seasoned the chop with the soft-boiled egg yolk. \"But right now I'm in a hurry to get to the Palace. Give my shoes an extra shine, there's a good girl.\"  \"Oh, you and your secrets!\"  An hour later, Pashkov landed on the Palace roof in Colonel James' flier--an exact copy of his own flier. The Palace roof captain stared at him, then smiled nervously.  \"They are waiting for you in the Gustavus room, Colonel.\"  \"Colonel? Do I still look like Colonel James?\"  \"Oh, no, sir.\"  \"Do I talk like Colonel James?\"  \"You've changed completely, sir. If I didn't know, I would swear you were the notorious Gospodin Pashkov.\"  \"I am Gospodin Pashkov now, Captain. To everybody.\"  \"Of course, sir. I'll ring down you are coming.\"  Pashkov glanced at his watch. Colonel James would be landing in Moscow about now and taken to Comrade Petchareff for questioning.  A manservant in velvet cutaways, patent leather shoes and white gloves, escorted Pashkov through rooms hung with chandeliers, tapestries, paintings. Pashkov entered the last room and stopped as the door clicked shut behind him.         *       *       *       *       *  In the room were three men, all of whom he recognized: Professor Kristin of the Swedish Academy, a white-haired old man with a kind, intelligent face; the king, Gustavus IX, a thin old man stroking his Vandyke, sitting under a portrait of Frederick the Great; and Monsieur Fanti, the make-up surgeon.  Pashkov bowed his head. \"Your majesty. Gentlemen.\"  \"Extraordinary!\" Professor Kristin said.  Pashkov turned to the surgeon. \"Monsieur, should my face have such a frivolous expression?\"  M. Fanti raised his eyebrows, but did not answer.  \"I thought,\" said Pashkov, \"that Gospodin Pashkov's face has a more brutal look.\"  \"Propaganda,\" said the artist. But he came closer and looked at Pashkov's face with sudden interest.  Professor Kristin said, \"Colonel James, we presume you have studied the problem in detail. I'm afraid we have delayed announcing the Nobel prize for literature much too long. How soon can you bring Boris Knackenpast to Stockholm?\"  So there it was: Boris Knackenpast a supreme success, as Pashkov had suspected. It would be amusing to tell robotist Medvedev about it.  \"Delicate, very delicate,\" Pashkov said. \"Everything depends on my not running into Gospodin Pashkov.\"  \"We can't wait any longer,\" Professor Kristin said. \"Fortunately, we have an ally in the enemy camp. The robotist, Medvedev, is expecting you at Knackenpast's villa.\"  \"Bad show,\" M. Fanti said suddenly. \"No good. His left cheekbone is at least four centimeters too high.\"  The men looked at the surgeon, then at Pashkov.  M. Fanti fingered Pashkov's cheekbone. \"How could I have made such a mistake! Just look at him. People laugh at such faces.\"  \"How much time to correct the error then, Monsieur Fanti?\" the king asked.  \"A week at least. His skin needs a rest. I must rework the whole left side of his face--it's all lopsided.\"  \"But we can't spare a week,\" Professor Kristin said.  \"With your majesty's permission,\" Pashkov offered, \"I am willing to go as I am. Indeed, my plans call for immediate departure.\"  \"It is a good thing you do for us, Colonel James,\" Gustavus IX said, \"and a courageous thing. Please accept our thanks.\"  Professor Kristin saw Pashkov to the door. \"One suggestion, Colonel. Your r's are still too soft for a real Russian. Why do you Americans slur them like that? And I beg you, if you value your life, do not fail to watch your fricatives.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The roof captain saluted as Pashkov stepped out of the lift. His flier was serviced and ready.  \"What weather in Moscow, Captain?\"  \"Ceiling four thousand. We're having patrols half way out to sea. They are instructed to let you pass.\"  A small incident, the roof captain explained. A Swedish Red Cross flier was missing from the National Hospital. Two Cuban agents had been arrested and a cache of small arms and ammunition was found. But no trace of the ambulance.  \"I suppose the Cubans deny stealing the ambulance?\" Pashkov asked.  \"They say they've been framed by a fat little Russian. But it's transparent, a clumsy job. Imagine, they left a stolen car in the ambulance court and in it an invoice for six cases of ammunition. It was traced to the Cubans in half an hour.\"  Pashkov climbed into his flier. \"Well, it's fashionable to blame the Russians for everything.\" He waved his chubby hand, and took off. Flying over the Baltic, he set the controls on the Moscow beam.  Ten minutes west of Moscow he tuned the communicator in on Petchareff's office.  \"Seven One Three here, Nadezhda. Tell Petchareff--no, let me talk to him.\"  \"Seven One ... but that's impossible! Gospodin Pashkov is in conference with Comrade Petchareff.\"  \"Stupid!\" Petchareff's voice sounded behind Nadezhda's, and the speaker clicked and went dead.  Pashkov dove into the clouds and brought his flier to a hovering stop.  Petchareff did not believe he was Pashkov. Colonel James, it was clear, was at that moment in Petchareff's office, impersonating Pashkov. And Zubov was probably getting a rest cure.  Pashkov crawled out of the cloud and skimmed northeast to Mir, Boris Knackenpast's villa.  \"You came fast, sir,\" the lieutenant of guards welcomed him at Mir. \"We did not expect you for another fifteen minutes.\"  Fifteen minutes. The colonel was not wasting time.  \"Listen carefully, lieutenant.\" Pashkov described the American agent. \"But his left cheekbone is lower than mine--about four centimeters. He may be armed, so be careful.\"  The lieutenant stared. \"Shall we kill him?\"  \"No, no. Put him in a cage.\"  As Pashkov ran up the steps to the villa, the curtain in the vestibule window stirred. But when he entered, the vestibule was empty.  He looked in the dining room, the music room, the library. Nobody. The house was strangely quiet. He came to the door of the study and listened. Not a sound. He went in and there, behind the large writing desk, sat Boris Knackenpast.  The robot was unscrewing screws imbedded in his neck.  \"My God, sir,\" said Pashkov, \"what are you doing?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The robot's eyes, large disks of glittering mirror, flashed as he looked up. \"Ah, Colonel James,\" Boris said in a voice that seemed to come from a deep well. \"Excuse the poor welcome, but I understand we have little time. You scared my valet; he thought you were Gospodin Pashkov.\"  The door burst open and Medvedev rushed in, the old valet at his heels. Medvedev stopped, gaped, then seized Pashkov's hand. \"Colonel James! What an artist, that Monsieur Fanti. But quick, Boris, Pashkov is on his way.\"  Boris pulled off his head, and crawled out of the robot shell. Pashkov saw Boris as he really was, a tall human with a gaunt, ascetic face.  The sad thing about us, thought Pashkov, is that Medvedev could not trust even me. But then I could not trust Medvedev, either. Yes, that's the trouble with us.  \"I hope you need no luggage, Mister Knackenpast,\" Pashkov said. \"We must be off at once.\"  \"Too late!\" the old valet said from the window.  Colonel James had landed. But as he climbed down from his flier, the guards closed a circle about him.  \"He'll keep,\" Pashkov said, hitching up his pants. \"Let's be off, Mister Knackenpast. It won't take long for Petchareff to smell us out.\"  \"Look!\"  The guards fell back from the flier and snapped to attention. Chewing on his cigar furiously, out stepped Petchareff.  Zubov leaped out next, his big front tooth flashing. Then his two assistants, Petya and Kolya, tumbled out in their coats and hats. Last of all to emerge from the flier was Nadezhda Brunhildova.  \"Pretend not to know me, will he?\" she yelled at Colonel James, picking up a rock.  \"Hold it, citizenress,\" Colonel James said.  \"Citizenress, is it?\" The rock flew over his head and felled Zubov.  \"I warned you both, no kitchen squabbles while on duty,\" Petchareff roared. He snapped an order to the lieutenants of guards, and the guards surrounded the house.  \"No alarm, no alarm,\" Pashkov said, pulling Boris away from the window. \"Mister Knackenpast, when you see your way clear to my flier, run for it. But get back into your robot costume.\"  \"I can't operate the machine.\"  \"I'll be right behind you. The rest of us will go out to Petchareff.\"  As they came out, Petchareff was reviving Zubov by slapping his face. The kidnaping expert lay stretched cold on the ground, and Nadezhda Brunhildova stood by, holding the rock and weeping.  Colonel James said, \"There he is, the American spy.\"  Petchareff looked up as Pashkov was led forward by the guards. \"Not bad,\" Petchareff said. \"We could use Monsieur Fanti. What's his price?\"  \"Don't you know me, chief? Me, Pashkov.\"  \"Curse me,\" Nadezhda said, staring at him. \"Another Pashkov.\"  A terrible howl came from Zubov. Petya and Kolya, imitating Petchareff's efforts to revive their master, were battering Zubov's face with their slouched hats.  \"Stand back!\" Kolya screamed, smashing his hat into Zubov's face. \"He is trying to say"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51258"],["title","A Bad Day for Vermin (#1)"],["body","ling.\"  \"What you got in mind, Senator?\"  \"Just this:\" the Senator said solemnly. \"A person is ... _any harmless creature_....\"  Feet shuffled. Someone coughed.  \"What about a man who commits a violent act, then?\" Judge Gates demanded. \"What's he, eh?\"  \"That's obvious, gentlemen,\" the senator said flatly. \"He's vermin.\"         *       *       *       *       *  On the courthouse steps Cecil Stump stood, hands in hip pockets, talking to a reporter from the big-town paper in Mattoon, surrounded by a crowd of late-comers who had missed the excitement inside. He described the accuracy of his five shots, the sound they had made hitting the big blue snake, and the ludicrous spectacle the latter had presented in its death agony. He winked at a foxy man in overalls picking his nose at the edge of the crowd.  \"Guess it'll be a while 'fore any more damned reptiles move in here like they owned the place,\" he concluded.  The courthouse doors banged wide; excited citizens poured forth, veering aside from Cecil Stump. The crowd around him thinned, broke up as its members collared those emerging with the hot news. The reporter picked a target.  \"Perhaps you'd care to give me a few details of the action taken by the ... ah ... Special Committee, sir?\"  Senator Custis pursed his lips. \"A session of the Town Council was called,\" he said. \"We've defined what a person is in this town--\"  Stump, standing ten feet away, snorted. \"Can't touch me with no _ex post factory_ law.\"  \"--and also what can be classified as vermin,\" Custis went on.  Stump closed his mouth with a snap.  \"Here, that s'posed to be some kind of slam at me, Custis? By God, come election time....\"  Above, the door opened again. A tall man in a leather jacket stepped out, stood looking down. The crowd pressed back. Senator Custis and the reporter moved aside. The newcomer came down the steps slowly. He carried Cecil Stump's nickel-plated .44 in his hand.  Standing alone now, Stump watched him.  \"Here,\" he said. His voice carried a sudden note of strain. \"Who're you?\"  The man reached the foot of the steps, raised the revolver and cocked it with a thumb.  \"I'm the new exterminator,\" he said."]]]
