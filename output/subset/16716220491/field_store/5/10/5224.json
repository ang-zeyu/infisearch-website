He always fights any improvements, and I can't override him.\"  \"Can _I_?\"  \"Of course; that's mainly what you're for. Wait till I get these connections finished and you'll see the whole setup.\"  \"FEAR!\" shrieked Id. \"STOP! NO CHANGE!\"  \"SHUT UP!\" yelled Intellect.  It was strange being integrated; Amos found he was aware on two levels simultaneously. While he responded normally to his external environment, a lightning inner vision saw everything in vastly greater detail. The blink of an eye, for instance, was an amazing project. Even as commands flashed out and before the muscles started to respond, extra blood was rushing into the area to nourish the working parts. Reports flowed back like battle assessments: these three muscles were on schedule; this was lagging; that was pulling too hard. An infinitesimal twinge of pain marked some minor accident, and correction began at once. A censor watched the whole operation and labeled each incoming report: trivial, do not record; trivial, do not record; trivial, do not record; worth watching, record in temporary banks; trivial, do not....  He felt now that he could look forward to permanent health, and so far he didn't seem to be losing his identity or becoming a moral monster (though certain previously buried urges--toward Alice Grant, for instance--were now rather embarrassingly uncovered). He was not, like Frank Barnes, inclined to slip out of the situation at once. He still felt the responsibility to make the decision.  He carried the vial of powder and the lab records home with him, smuggled them past his wife's garrulity (it didn't bother him now) and hid them. He went out with her cheerfully to visit some people he didn't like, and found himself amused at them instead of annoyed. In general, he felt buoyant, and they stayed quite late.         *       *       *       *       *  When they did get home, an urgent message was waiting on the telephone recorder, and it jolted him. He grabbed up the hat and coat he'd just laid down.  \"What is it?\" his wife demanded.  \"I've got to go down to the plant.\" He hesitated; it was hard to say the words that were charged with personal significance. \"The watchman found Frank Barnes dead in the laboratory.\"  \"Who?\"  \"Frank Barnes! My chief chemist!\"  \"Oh.\" She looked at him, obviously concerned only with what effect, if any, it might have on her own circumstances. \"Why do you have to get mixed up in it?\"  \"I'm the boss, damn it!\" He left her standing there and ran for the garage.  The police were already at the plant when he arrived. Fred's body lay on the floor of his office, in a corner behind some file cabinets, face up.  \"What was it?\" Amos asked the man from the coroner's office, dreading the answer he expected.  The answer wasn't the one he expected. \"Heart attack.\"  Amos wondered if they were mistaken. He looked around the office. Things weren't disarrayed in any way; it looked as if Frank had simply lain down and died. \"When did you find him?\" he asked the watchman.  \"A little after one. The door was closed and the lights were out, but I heard the cat yowling in here, so I came in to let it out, and saw the body.\"  \"Any family?\" one of the city men asked.  \"No,\" said Amos slowly, \"he lived alone. I guess you might as well take him to the ... morgue. When can I call about the autopsy?\"  \"Try after lunch.\"  Amos watched them carry Frank away. Then he put out the lights and closed up the laboratory. He told the watchman he'd be around for a while, and went to his office to think.  As nearly as he knew, Frank had taken the drug less than twenty-four hours before he had. Death had come late at night, which meant Frank had been working overtime. Why? And why hadn't he been able to save himself?  \"Not logical,\" his unconscious stated firmly. \"He should have felt it coming and made repairs.\"  \"This whole thing's a delusion,\" said Amos dully, aloud.  \"No, it isn't,\" said a peculiar voice behind him.  He whirled and saw the black tomcat grinning up at him. He gasped, wondering if he were completely insane, but in a flash understanding came. \"Frank!\"  \"Well, don't act so surprised. I can tell that you took some yourself.\"  \"Yes--but how--\"  \"I thought it would be an easy life and I want to stay around here and watch things for a while. It ought to be fun.\"  \"But _how_?\"  \"I anesthetized the cat and grew a bridge into his skull. It took five hours to transfer the bulk of my personality. It's odd, but it blended right in with his.\"  \"But--your speech!\"  \"I've made some changes. I'm omnivorous now, too, not just carnivorous--or will be in a few more hours. I can go into the hills and live on grass, or grow back into a man, or whatever I like.\"  Amos consulted his own inwardness again. \"Is this possible? Can a human mind be compressed into a cat's brain?\"  \"Sure,\" said Unconscious, \"if you're willing to junk all the excess.\"  He thought about it. \"So you're going to stay around and watch,\" he said to the cat--no, Frank. \"An intriguing idea. My family's taken care of, and nobody'll really miss me.\"  \"Except Alice Grant,\" said Frank cattily. \"I've seen the way you look at her. The cat part of me has, I mean. And she looks back, too, when you aren't watching.\"  \"Well,\" said Amos. \"Hm. Maybe we can do something there too.\"         *       *       *       *       *  His own metamorphosis took a lot longer than five hours; he had a much bigger job of alterations to finish. It was nearly two months before he got back to the plant.  He peered in through the window at Detrick, who'd inherited Amos' old office. Detrick was chewing out a salesman. Amos knew what would be happening now; Derrick's ambitious but unsound expansion would have gotten the division all tangled up. In fact, with his sharp new eyes, Amos could read part of a letter from Buffalo that lay on the desk. It was quite critical of Detrick's margin of profit.  The salesman Detrick had on the carpet was a good man, and Amos wondered if he was to blame for whatever it was about. Maybe Detrick was just preparing to throw him to the wolves. A man could hang on a long time like that, shifting the blame to his subordinates.  The salesman was finally excused, and Detrick sat alone with all the frustration and selfish scheming plain on his face. No, Amos thought, I'm not going to turn this drug loose on the world for a while. Not while there are people like Detrick around.  There were no other pigeons on the window ledge except himself and Alice; the rest had stopped coming when Amos disappeared and the feeding ended. For that matter, they tended to avoid him and Alice, possibly because of the abnormal size, especially around the head, and the other differences.  He noticed that Alice was changing the color of her feet again. Just like a woman, he thought fondly.  \"Come on, Pigeon,\" he said, \"let's go somewhere else. This tightwad Detrick isn't going to give us anything to eat.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5153"],["title","Rung Ho! A Novel (#1)"],["body","ide. There was a sickening sound, as something hard swished and whicked home; her pony reeled from the shock of a horse's shoulder, and--none too gently--none too modestly--the prince with the egret and the handsome face reined in on his horse's haunches and saluted her.  There was blood, becoming dull-brown in the dust between them. He shook his sabre, and the blood dripped from it then he held it outstretched, and a horseman wiped it, before he returned it with a clang.  “The sahiba's servant!” he said magnificently, making no motion to let her pass, but twisting with his sword-hand at his waxed mustache and smiling darkly.  She looked down between them at the thing that but a minute since had lived, and loved perhaps as well as hated.  “Shame on you, Jaimihr-sahib!” she said, shuddering. A year ago she would have fallen from her pony in a swoon, but one year of Howrah and its daily horrors had so hardened her that she could look and loathe without the saving grace of losing consciousness.  “The shame would have been easier to realize, had I taken more than one stroke!” he answered irritably, still blocking the way on his great horse, still twisting at his mustache point, still looking down at her through eyes that blazed a dozen accumulated centuries' store of lawless ambition. He was proud of that back-handed swipe of his that would cleave a man each time at one blow from shoulder-joint to ribs, severing the backbone. A woman of his own race would have been singing songs in praise of him and his skill in swordsman-ship already; but no woman of his own race would have looked him in the eye like that and dared him, nor have done what she did next. She leaned over and swished his charger with her little whip, and slipped past him.  He swore, deep and fiercely, as he spurred and wheeled, and cantered after her. His great stallion could overhaul her pony in a minute, going stride for stride; the wall was more than two miles long with no break in it other than locked gates; there was no hurry. He watched her through half-closed, glowering, appraising eyes as he cantered in her wake, admiring the frail, slight figure in the gray cotton habit, and bridling his desire to make her--seize her reins, and halt, and make her--admit him master of the situation.  As he reached her stirrup, she reined in and faced him, after a hurried glance that told her her duenna had failed her. The old woman was invisible.  “Will you leave that body to lie there in the dust and sun?” she asked indignantly.  “I am no vulture, or jackal, or hyena, sahiba!” he smiled. “I do not eat carrion!” He seemed to think that that was a very good retort, for he showed his wonderful white teeth until his handsome face was the epitome of self-satisfied amusement. His horse blocked the way again, and all retreat was cut off, for his escort were behind her, and three of them had ridden to the right, outside the row of trees, to cut off possible escape in that direction. “Was it not well that I was near, sahiba? Would it have been better to die at the hands of a Maharati of no caste--?”  “Than to see blood spilt--than to be beholden to a murderer? Infinitely better! There was no need to kill that man--I could have quieted him. Let me pass, please, Jaimihr-sahib!”  He reined aside; but if she thought that cold scorn or hot anger would either of them quell his ardor, she had things reversed. The less she behaved as a native woman would have done--the more she flouted him--the more enthusiastic he became.  “Sahiba!”--he trotted beside her, his great horse keeping up easily with her pony's canter--“I have told you oftener than once that I make a good friend and a bad enemy!”  “And I have answered oftener than once that I do not need your friendship, and am not afraid of you! You forget that the British Government will hold your royal brother liable for my safety and my father's!”  “You, too, overlook certain things, sahiba.” He spoke evenly, with a little space between each word. With the dark look that accompanied it, with the blood barely dry yet on the dusty road behind, his speech was not calculated to reassure a slip of a girl, gray-eyed or not, stiff-chinned or not, borne up or not by Scots enthusiasm for a cause. “This is a native state. My brother rules. The British--”  “Are near enough, and strong enough, to strike and to bring you and your brother to your knees if you harm a British woman!” she retorted. “You forget--when the British Government gives leave to missionaries to go into a native state, it backs them up with a strong arm!”  “You build too much on the British and my brother, sahiba! Listen--Howrah is as strong as I am, and no stronger. Had he been stronger, he would have slain me long ago. The British are--” He checked himself and trotted beside her in silence for a minute. She affected complete indifference; it was as though she had not heard him; if she could not be rid of him, she at least knew how to show him his utter unimportance in her estimation.  “Have you heard, sahiba, of the Howrah treasure? Of the rubies? Of the pearls? Of the emeralds? Of the bars of gold? It is foolishness, of course; we who are modern-minded see the crime of hoarding all that wealth, and adding to it, for twenty generations. Have you heard of it, sahiba?”  “Yes!” she answered savagely, swishing at his charger again to make him keep his distance. “You have told me of it twice. You have told me that you know where it is, and you have offered to show it to me. You have told me that you and your brother Maharajah Howrah and the priests of Siva are the only men who know where it is, and you lust for that treasure! I can see you lust! You think that I lust too, and you make a great mistake Jaimihr-sahib! You see, I remember what you have told me. Now, go away and remember what I tell you. I care for you and for your treasure exactly that!” She hit his charger with all her might, and at the sting of the little whip he shied clear of the road before the Rajah's brother could rein him in.  Again her effort to destroy his admiration for her had directly the opposite effect. He swore, and he swore vengeance; but he swore, too, that there was no woman in the East so worth a prince's while as this one, who dared flout him with her riding-whip before his men!  “Sahiba!” he said, sidling close to her again, and bowing in the saddle in mock cavalier humility. “The time will come when your government and my brother, who--at present--is Maharajah Howrah--will be of little service to you. Then, perhaps, you may care to recall my promise to load all the jewels you can choose out of the treasure-house on you. Then, perhaps, you may, remember that I said 'a throne is better than a grave, sahiba.' Or else--”  “Or else what, Jaimihr-sahib?” She reined again and wheeled about and faced him--pale-trembling a little--looking very small and frail beside him on his great war-horse, but not flinching under his gaze for a single second.  “Or else, sahiba--I think you saw me slay the Maharati? Do you think that I would stop at anything to accomplish what I had set out to do? See, sahiba--there is a little blood there on your jacket! Let that be for a pledge between us--for a sign--or a token of my oath that on the day I am Maharajah Howrah, you are Maharanee--mistress of all the jewels in the treasure-house!”  She shuddered. She did not look to find the blood; she took his word for that, if for nothing else.  “I wonder you dare tell me that you plot against your brother!” That was more a spoken thought than a statement or a question.  “I would be very glad if you would warn my brother!” he answered her; and she knew like a flash, and on the instant, that what he said was true. She had been warned before she came to bear no tales to any one. No Oriental would believe the tale, coming from her; the Maharajah would arrest her promptly, glad of the excuse to vent his hatred of Christian missionaries. Jaimihr would attempt a rescue; it was common knowledge that he plotted for the throne. There would be instant civil war, in which the British Government would perforce back up the alleged protector of a defenseless woman. There would be a new Maharajah; then, in a little while, and in all likelihood, she would have disappeared forever while the war raged. There would be, no doubt, a circumstantial story of her death from natural causes.  She did not answer. She stared back at him, and he smiled down at her, twisting at his mustache.  “Think!” he said, nodding. “A throne, sahiba, is considerably better than a grave!” Then he wheeled like a sudden dust-devil and decamped in a cloud of dust, followed at full pelt by his clattering escort. She watched their horses leap one after the other the corpse of the Maharati that lay by the corner where it fell, and she saw the last of them go clattering, whirling up the street through the bazaar. The old hag rose out of a shadow and trotted after her again as she turned and rode on, pale-faced and crying now a little, to the little begged school place where her father tried to din the alphabet into a dozen low-caste fosterlings.  “Father!” she cried, and she all but fell out of the saddle into his arms as the tall, lean Scotsman came to the door to meet her and stood blinking in the sunlight. “Father, I've seen another man killed! I've had another scene with Jaimihr! I can't endure it! I--I--Oh, why did I ever come?”  “I don't know, dear,” he answered. “But you would come, wouldn't you?”     CHAPTER II       'Twixt loot and law--'tween creed and caste--     Through slough this people wallows,     To where we choose our road at last.
