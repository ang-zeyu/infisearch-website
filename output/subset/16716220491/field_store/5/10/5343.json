Just before beginning this letter I composed an air from the \"Demetrio\" of Metastasio, which begins thus, \"Misero tu non sei.\"  The opera at Mantua was very good. They gave \"Demetrio.\" The prima donna sings well, but is inanimate, and if you did not see her acting, but only singing, you might suppose she was not singing at all, for she can't open her mouth, and whines out everything; but this is nothing new to us. The seconda donna looks like a grenadier, and has a very powerful voice; she really does not sing badly, considering that this is her first appearance. Il primo uomo, il musico, sings beautifully, but his voice is uneven; his name is Caselli. Il secondo uomo is quite old, and does not at all please me. The tenor's name is Ottini; he does not sing unpleasingly, but with effort, like all Italian tenors. We know him very well. The name of the second I don't know; he is still young, but nothing at all remarkable. Primo ballerino good; prima ballerina good, and people say pretty, but I have not seen her near. There is a grotesco who jumps cleverly, but cannot write as I do--just as pigs grunt. The orchestra is tolerable. In Cremona, the orchestra is good, and Spagnoletta is the name of the first violinist there. Prima donna very passable--rather ancient, I fancy, and as ugly as sin. She does not sing as well as she acts, and is the wife of a violin-player at the opera. Her name is Masci. The opera was the \"Clemenza di Tito.\" Seconda donna not ugly on the stage, young, but nothing superior. Primo uomo, un musico, Cicognani, a fine voice, and a beautiful cantabile. The other two musici young and passable. The tenor's name is non lo so [I don't know what]. He has a pleasing exterior, and resembles Le Roi at Vienna. Ballerino primo good, but an ugly dog. There was a ballerina who danced far from badly, and, what is a capo d'opera, she is anything but plain, either on the stage or off it. The rest were the usual average. I cannot write much about the Milan opera, for we did not go there, but we heard that it was not successful. Primo uomo, Aprile, who sings well, and has a fine even voice; we heard him at a grand church festival. Madame Piccinelli, from Paris, who sang at one of our concerts, acts at the opera. Herr Pick, who danced at Vienna, is now dancing here. The opera is \"Didone abbandonata,\" but it is not to be given much longer. Signor Piccini, who is writing the next opera, is here. I am told that the title is to be \"Cesare in Egitto.\"  WOLFGANG DE MOZART,  Noble of Hohenthal and attached to the Exchequer.    4.  Milan, Feb. 10, 1770.  SPEAK of the wolf, and you see his ears! I am quite well, and impatiently expecting an answer from you. I kiss mamma's hand, and send you a little note and a little kiss; and remain, as before, your----What? Your aforesaid merry-andrew brother, Wolfgang in Germany, Amadeo in Italy.  DE MORZANTINI.    5.  Milan, Feb. 17, 1770.  Now I am in for it! My Mariandel! I am so glad that you were so tremendously merry. Say to nurse Urserl that I still think I sent back all her songs, but if, engrossed by high and mighty thoughts of Italy, I carried one off with me, I shall not fail, if I find it, to enclose it in one of my letters. Addio, my children, farewell! I kiss mamma's hands a thousand times, and send you a thousand kisses and salutes on your queer monkey face. Per fare il fine, I am yours, &c.    6.  Milan, Carnival, Erchtag.  MANY kisses to mamma and to you. I am fairly crazed with so much business, [Footnote: Concerts and compositions of every kind occupied Mozart. The principal result of his stay in Milan was, that the young maestro got the scrittura of an opera for the ensuing season. As the libretto was to be sent to them, they could first make a journey through Italy with easy minds. The opera was \"Mitridate, Re di Ponto.\"] so I can't possibly write any more.    7.  Milan, March 3, 1770.  CARA SORELLA MIA,--  I am heartily glad that you have had so much amusement. Perhaps you may think that I have not been as merry as you; but, indeed, I cannot sum up all we have done. I think we have been at least six or seven times at the opera and the feste di ballo, which, as in Vienna, begin after the opera, but with this difference, that at Vienna the dancing is more orderly. We also saw the facchinata and chiccherata. The first is a masquerade, an amusing sight, because the men go as facchini, or porters; there was also a barca filled with people, and a great number on foot besides; and five or six sets of trumpets and kettledrums, besides several bands of violins and other instruments. The chiccherata is also a masquerade. What the people of Milan call chicchere, we call petits maitres, or fops. They were all on horseback, which was a pretty sight. I am as happy now to hear that Herr von Aman [Footnote: The father had written in a previous letter, \"Herr von Aman's accident, of which you wrote to us, not only distressed us very much, but cost Wolfgang many tears. You know how sensitive he is\"] is better, as I was grieved when you mentioned that he had met with an accident. What kind of mask did Madame Rosa wear, and Herr von Molk, and Herr von Schiedenhofen? Pray write this to me, if you know it; your doing so will oblige me very much. Kiss mamma's hands for me a thousand million times, and a thousand to yourself from \"Catch him who can!\" Why, here he is!    8.  Bologna, March 24, 1770.  Oh, you busy creature!  Having been so long idle, I thought it would do me no harm to set to work again for a short time. On the post-days, when the German letters come, all that I eat and drink tastes better than usual. I beg you will let me know who are to sing in the oratorio, and also its title. Let me hear how you like the Haydn minuets, and whether they are better than the first. From my heart I rejoice to hear that Herr von Aman is now quite recovered; pray say to him that he must take great care of himself and beware of any unusual exertion. Be sure you tell him this. I intend shortly to send you a minuet that Herr Pick danced on the stage, and which every one in Milan was dancing at the feste di ballo, only that you may see by it how slowly people dance. The minuet itself is beautiful. Of course it comes from Vienna, so no doubt it is either Teller's or Starzer's. It has a great many notes. Why? Because it is a theatrical minuet, which is in slow time. The Milan and Italian minuets, however, have a vast number of notes, and are slow and with a quantity of bars; for instance, the first part has sixteen, the second twenty, and even twenty-four.  We made the acquaintance of a singer in Parma, and also heard her to great advantage in her own house--I mean the far-famed Bastardella. She has, first, a fine voice; second, a flexible organ; third, an incredibly high compass. She sang the following notes and passages in my presence.  [Here, Mozart illustrates with about 20 measures of music]    9.  Rome, April 14, 1770.  I AM thankful to say that my stupid pen and I are all right, so we send a thousand kisses to you both. I wish that my sister were in Rome, for this city would assuredly delight her, because St. Peter's is symmetrical, and many other things in Rome are also symmetrical. Papa has just told me that the loveliest flowers are being carried past at this moment. That I am no wiseacre is pretty well known.  Oh! I have one annoyance--there is only a single bed in our lodgings, so mamma may easily imagine that I get no rest beside papa. I rejoice at the thoughts of a new lodging. I have just finished sketching St. Peter with his keys, St. Paul with his sword, and St. Luke with--my sister, &c., &c. I had the honor of kissing St. Peter's foot at San Pietro, and as I have the misfortune to be so short, your good old  WOLFGANG MOZART  was lifted up!    10.  Rome, April 21, 1770.  CARA SORELLA MIA,--  Pray try to find the \"Art of Ciphering\" which you copied out, but I have lost it, and know nothing about it. So pray do write it out again for me, with some other copies of sums, and send them to me here.  Manzuoli has entered into a contract with the Milanese to sing in my opera [see Nos. 2-6]. For this reason he sang four or five arias to me in Florence, and also some of my own, which I was obliged to compose in Milan (none of my theatrical things having been heard there) to prove that I was capable of writing an opera. Manzuoli asks 1000 ducats. It is not yet quite certain whether Gabrielli will come. Some say Madame de' Amicis will sing in it; we shall see her in Naples. I wish that she and Manzuoli could act together; we should then be sure of two good friends. The libretto is not yet chosen. I recommended one of Metastasio's to Don Ferdinando [Count Firmiani's steward, in Milan] and to Herr von Troyer. I am at this moment at work on the aria \"Se ardore e speranza.\"    11.  Rome, April 25, 1770.  CARA SORELLA MIA,--  Io vi accerto che io aspetto con una incredibile premura tutte le giornate di posta qualche lettere di Salisburgo. Jeri fummo a S. Lorenzo e sentimmo il Vespero, e oggi matina la messa cantata, e la sera poi il secondo vespero, perche era la festa della Madonna del Buonconsiglio. Questi giorni fummi nel Campidoglio e viddemmo varie belle cose. Se io volessi scrivere tutto quel che viddi, non bastarebbe questo foglietto. In due Accademie suonai, e domani suonero anche in una.--Subito dopo pranzo giuochiamo a Potsch [Boccia]. Questo e un giuoco che imparai qui, quando verro a casa, ve l'imparero. Finita questa lettera finiro una sinfonia mia, che comminciai. L'aria e finita, una sinfonia e dal copista (il quale e il mio padre) perche noi non la vogliamo dar via per copiarla; altrimente ella sarebbe rubata.  WOLFGANGO in Germania.

Nowadays--”  “You forget that Mr. Pemberton Bryce is what most people would call a very pushing young man,” said Mary. “If he doesn't get what he wants in this world, it won't be for not asking for it. But--if you must speak to him--and I really think you must!--will you tell him that he is not going to get--me? Perhaps he'll take it finally from you--as my guardian.”  “I don't know if parents and guardians count for much in these degenerate days,” said Ransford. “But--I won't have him annoying you. And--I suppose it has come to annoyance?”  “It's very annoying to be asked three times by a man whom you've told flatly, once for all, that you don't want him, at any time, ever!” she answered. “It's--irritating!”  “All right,” said Ransford quietly. “I'll speak to him. There's going to be no annoyance for you under this roof.”  The girl gave him a quick glance, and Ransford turned away from her and picked up his letters.  “Thank you,” she said. “But--there's no need to tell me that, because I know it already. Now I wonder if you'll tell me something more?”  Ransford turned back with a sudden apprehension.  “Well?” he asked brusquely. “What?”  “When are you going to tell me all about--Dick and myself?” she asked. “You promised that you would, you know, some day. And--a whole year's gone by since then. And--Dick's seventeen! He won't be satisfied always--just to know no more than that our father and mother died when we were very little, and that you've been guardian--and all that you have been!--to us. Will he, now?”  Ransford laid down his letters again, and thrusting his hands in his pockets, squared his shoulders against the mantelpiece. “Don't you think you might wait until you're twenty-one?” he asked.  “Why?” she said, with a laugh. “I'm just twenty--do you really think I shall be any wiser in twelve months? Of course I shan't!”  “You don't know that,” he replied. “You may be--a great deal wiser.”  “But what has that got to do with it?” she persisted. “Is there any reason why I shouldn't be told--everything?”  She was looking at him with a certain amount of demand--and Ransford, who had always known that some moment of this sort must inevitably come, felt that she was not going to be put off with ordinary excuses. He hesitated--and she went on speaking.  “You know,” she continued, almost pleadingly. “We don't know anything--at all. I never have known, and until lately Dick has been too young to care--”  “Has he begun asking questions?” demanded Ransford hastily.  “Once or twice, lately--yes,” replied Mary. “It's only natural.” She laughed a little--a forced laugh. “They say,” she went on, “that it doesn't matter, nowadays, if you can't tell who your grandfather was--but, just think, we don't know who our father was--except that his name was John Bewery. That doesn't convey much.”  “You know more,” said Ransford. “I told you--always have told you--that he was an early friend of mine, a man of business, who, with your mother, died young, and I, as their friend, became guardian to you and Dick. Is--is there anything much more that I could tell?”  “There's something I should very much like to know--personally,” she answered, after a pause which lasted so long that Ransford began to feel uncomfortable under it. “Don't be angry--or hurt--if I tell you plainly what it is. I'm quite sure it's never even occurred to Dick--but I'm three years ahead of him. It's this--have we been dependent on you?”  Ransford's face flushed and he turned deliberately to the window, and for a moment stood staring out on his garden and the glimpses of the Cathedral. And just as deliberately as he had turned away, he turned back.  “No!” he said. “Since you ask me, I'll tell you that. You've both got money--due to you when you're of age. It--it's in my hands. Not a great lot--but sufficient to--to cover all your expenses. Education--everything. When you're twenty-one, I'll hand over yours--when Dick's twenty-one, his. Perhaps I ought to have told you all that before, but--I didn't think it necessary. I--I dare say I've a tendency to let things slide.”  “You've never let things slide about us,” she replied quickly, with a sudden glance which made him turn away again. “And I only wanted to know--because I'd got an idea that--well, that we were owing everything to you.”  “Not from me!” he exclaimed.  “No--that would never be!” she said. “But--don't you understand? I--wanted to know--something. Thank you. I won't ask more now.”  “I've always meant to tell you--a good deal,” remarked Ransford, after another pause. “You see, I can scarcely--yet--realize that you're both growing up! You were at school a year ago. And Dick is still very young. Are--are you more satisfied now?” he went on anxiously. “If not--”  “I'm quite satisfied,” she answered. “Perhaps--some day--you'll tell me more about our father and mother?--but never mind even that now. You're sure you haven't minded my asking--what I have asked?”  “Of course not--of course not!” he said hastily. “I ought to have remembered. And--but we'll talk again. I must get into the surgery--and have a word with Bryce, too.”  “If you could only make him see reason and promise not to offend again,”  she said. “Wouldn't that solve the difficulty?”  Ransford shook his head and made no answer. He picked up his letters again and went out, and down a long stone-walled passage which led to his surgery at the side of the house. He was alone there when he had shut the door--and he relieved his feelings with a deep groan.  “Heaven help me if the lad ever insists on the real truth and on having proofs and facts given to him!” he muttered. “I shouldn't mind telling her, when she's a bit older--but he wouldn't understand as she would. Anyway, thank God I can keep up the pleasant fiction about the money without her ever knowing that I told her a deliberate lie just now. But--what's in the future? Here's one man to be dismissed already, and there'll be others, and one of them will be the favoured man. That man will have to be told! And--so will she, then. And--my God! she doesn't see, and mustn't see, that I'm madly in love with her myself! She's no idea of it--and she shan't have; I must--must continue to be--only the guardian!”  He laughed a little cynically as he laid his letters down on his desk and proceeded to open them--in which occupation he was presently interrupted by the opening of the side-door and the entrance of Mr. Pemberton Bryce.     CHAPTER II. MAKING AN ENEMY   It was characteristic of Pemberton Bryce that he always walked into a room as if its occupant were asleep and he was afraid of waking him. He had a gentle step which was soft without being stealthy, and quiet movements which brought him suddenly to anybody's side before his presence was noticed. He was by Ransford's desk ere Ransford knew he was in the surgery--and Ransford's sudden realization of his presence roused a certain feeling of irritation in his mind, which he instantly endeavoured to suppress--it was no use getting cross with a man of whom you were about to rid yourself, he said to himself. And for the moment, after replying to his assistant's greeting--a greeting as quiet as his entrance--he went on reading his letters, and Bryce turned off to that part of the surgery in which the drugs were kept, and busied himself in making up some prescription. Ten minutes went by in silence; then Ransford pushed his correspondence aside, laid a paper-weight on it, and twisting his chair round, looked at the man to whom he was going to say some unpleasant things. Within himself he was revolving a question--how would Bryce take it?  He had never liked this assistant of his, although he had then had him in employment for nearly two years. There was something about Pemberton Bryce which he did not understand and could not fathom. He had come to him with excellent testimonials and good recommendations; he was well up to his work, successful with patients, thoroughly capable as a general practitioner--there was no fault to be found with him on any professional grounds. But to Ransford his personality was objectionable--why, he was not quite sure. Outwardly, Bryce was rather more than presentable--a tall, good-looking man of twenty-eight or thirty, whom some people--women especially--would call handsome; he was the sort of young man who knows the value of good clothes and a smart appearance, and his professional manner was all that could be desired. But Ransford could not help distinguishing between Bryce the doctor and Bryce the man--and Bryce the man he did not like. Outside the professional part of him, Bryce seemed to him to be undoubtedly deep, sly, cunning--he conveyed the impression of being one of those men whose ears are always on the stretch, who take everything in and give little out. There was a curious air of watchfulness and of secrecy about him in private matters which was as repellent--to Ransford's thinking--as it was hard to explain. Anyway, in private affairs, he did not like his assistant, and he liked him less than ever as he glanced at him on this particular occasion.  “I want a word with you,” he said curtly. “I'd better say it now.”  Bryce, who was slowly pouring some liquid from one bottle into another, looked quietly across the room and did not interrupt himself in his work. Ransford knew that he must have recognized a certain significance in the words just addressed to him--but he showed no outward sign of it, and the liquid went on trickling from one bottle to the other with the same uniform steadiness.  “Yes?” said Bryce inquiringly. “One moment.”  He finished his task calmly, put the corks in the bottles, labelled one, restored the other to a shelf, and turned round. Not a man to be easily startled--not easily turned from a purpose, this, thought Ransford as he glanced "]]]
