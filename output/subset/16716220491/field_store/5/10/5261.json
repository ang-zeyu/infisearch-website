He made \"thereat is\" rhyme with \"lattice\" and \"that is.\" Why did he follow \"shaven\" and \"raven\" with \"Dodo\"?  Furthermore, it had not struck me the first time I read the poem quickly that there was anything odd about a bird being named \"Isadore.\" People who keep pet grilches frequently name them after famous Reed players and Isadore is a common name.  On the other hand, it _was_ my Uncle's name. And the word \"Dodo\" didn't rhyme as it should.  I got out a magnifying glass to examine the ancient print. Sure enough, it had been tampered with. The print looked so odd to me, anyway, I hadn't noticed the part that had been changed. But it was obvious under the glass that \"Dodo\" had been substituted for a word of almost equal length. The same with \"Isadore.\"  I went over the whole poem now, carefully, to see which words had been changed. There weren't many. \"White\" in a couple of places. \"Dodo\" and \"Isadore\" wherever they occurred. An \"o\" in the line \"Perfume from an unseen cens_o_r.\" \"S\" in the line \"'Wretch,' I cried, 'Isadore hath _s_ent thee....'\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sitting back, I thought about what I had read. It made no sense at all. Was I to look for a white bird, \"grim, ungainly, ghastly\"? And what if I found him? Why was he like a raven? What was this perfume from an unseen censor? I could picture the ghost of Uncle Isadore, knowing his financial imagination, as the \"unseen censor\" because he always criticized me. Was I to look for perfume? Did he have a fortune in perfume stowed somewhere? It seemed to me it would take an awful lot of even the most expensive perfume to comprise a fortune.  I decided to start with the bird. I went outside Rene's ship and looked around. No birds.  \"Rene!\" I called. He was still looking through Uncle Izzy's ship. \"Have you seen an ungainly white bird around?\"  \"What!\" he snapped, sticking an indignant face out of the door.  \"I guess you haven't. Can your woodsy lore tell if there _are_ birds on this planet?\"  \"Obviously,\" Rene said. \"I don't know why you can't find your own spoor. I noticed the droppings immediately.\"  \"Where are the birds?\"  \"How the hell would I know?\" But he couldn't contain his special knowledge. \"They're probably night birds,\" he said.  \"Oh, yes.\" It checked. \"Wandering from the Night's Plutonian shore.\"  He looked at me suspiciously. \"You ever had a nervous breakdown?\"  \"I have _not_. I test 10:9 on job adjustment and 10:8 on life adjustment.\"  \"Some people crack on alien planets,\" he said. \"I have a padded room in my ship. You'd be surprised how often I have to use it.\"  I told him about the poem I found in Uncle Izzy's book. \"We look for a white bird,\" I said. \"Or perfume.\"  \"You're nuts,\" he pointed out with some justice, because he hadn't known Uncle Isadore. \"How do you know these changes weren't made by somebody else a long time ago? Maybe this ancient printer printed it wrong and had to change it afterward.\"  \"I don't think they were that primitive back then.\"  But I didn't know what \"back then\" meant or how primitive ancient printing was. All I knew for sure was that, as the poem stood, it sounded as if somebody had loused up a perfect Grilch Hop rhyme. And Uncle Izzy knew I was a Grilch Hop expert in Middle School and this was the only _real_ Grilch Hop rhythm in the book. What's more, Uncle Izzy could depend on me to go over that book in painstaking detail because a studs and neck clasp man has to be good on details.         *       *       *       *       *  \"All right,\" I said. \"You look your way and I'll look my way.\"  \"We're not looking any more any way today,\" Rene said, emerging from Uncle Isadore's ship loaded down with removings. \"It'll be night and below freezing in half an hour.\"  \"What do you think,\" I asked, \"a dodo would like to eat?\"  \"A _what_?\"  \"The birds. I want to put something out to attract them. Crackers or something?\"  \"I think you're crazy. If you have any idea of sitting outside to wait for them, you'll freeze to death. Not only that, there's no moon. You wouldn't be able to see your hand in front of your face.\"  \"How do the birds see?\"  \"Maybe they aren't night birds. Maybe they migrated somewhere else.\"  \"And if I use a light, it might scare them away,\" I mused. \"Well, maybe I'm not supposed to wait outside, anyway.\"  Rene went in and switched on the heat and lights.  \"Leave the outside port open,\" I said.  \"Why?\"  \"So the birds can knock.\"  \"Can _what_?\"  \"Well, it's possible,\" I said defensively. \"It won't hurt anything to leave it open.\"  \"All right,\" he consented, curving his mouth around unpleasantly, \"just to show you what a jackass you are.\"  Rene had the heat turned low, for sleeping, and the lights off, as soon as we had eaten and fed the converter. I hydrated a package of crackers so that they were full-sized but not soggy, broke them into pieces and tossed them out.  I admit I felt a little embarrassed.  I sat there in the chill quiet, on this ugly, alien world, reading \"The Dodo\" by the light of a miniature flash, so as not to disturb Rene.  Pretty soon I began to feel creepy. \"The Dodo\" is a ghastly poem. There's an insidious morbidity about it. It had sounded merely funny the first time I read it.  Now, the more I read it, the more I began to hear strange, impossible creakings and sighs, which might or might not be due to temperature changes.  The night outside was a deep, cold cup of darkness where no human thing moved.  There was a knock at the door.  I dropped the book and flashlight. Rene was up like a cat. He didn't turn on the light.  \"Who's there?\" he shouted.  There was a scratching noise at the door. Then a voice croaked, \"My name is Isadore Summers.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I reached a trembling hand for the door.  \"Wait, you fool!\" Rene cried. He picked up the flash and got his gun. \"Stand behind me and keep your hands off your gun. I know when to shoot and when not to shoot. You don't.\"  \"If it's Uncle Isadore....\"  \"I tell you you've got to leave it up to me, if you want to get off this planet alive. Now stand back and keep your mouth shut, no matter what happens.\"  He kicked the door open and stood back and to one side of it. \"Come in with your arms up!\"  There was a sort of rustling sound and in walked a huge, white, wingless bird.  \"My name,\" the dodo repeated, somewhat plaintively this time, with a glance toward the lunch compartment, \"is Isadore Summers.\"  I couldn't help it. I rolled all over the ship with laughter. Rene looked a little shamefaced, tossed his gun onto the rack and punched the lighting on.  Obviously the dodo recognized our lunch compartment from familiarity with Uncle Izzy's ship. Then he looked at the alcohol tap that led from the fuel conversion. \"Nepenthe?\" he begged.  I hesitated. \"Isn't there something,\" I asked Rene, \"about corrupting the natives of a primitive planet?\"  But Rene was sitting on his bunk, his jaw slack. \"This is the first time I've ever been made a fool of by an alcoholic bird.\"  \"If it's _just_ a bird, of course. Like a parrot....\"  I addressed the bird. \"Sir,\" I began, and caught myself, \"or perhaps madam, can you say anything else?\"  \"Nepenthe,\" the bird said firmly.  I shrugged and drew a cup. The dodo lifted the cup and drained it in one smooth gesture. This, as it turned out, was the only thing it seemed to do smoothly.  It began a wild attempt to scratch its head with one claw and remain upright. Then, abandoning all dignity, it rolled to its side and scratched furiously to satisfaction. After that, it began what looked like a hopeless attempt to right its awkward body, legs struggling in the air and back bumping around the ship.  I couldn't help remembering Uncle Izzy after a meal, slim and suave, lighting up a tapered, perfectly packed cigarene and blowing out one round, shapely smoke ring that hovered before his light, sardonic grin like a comment on his thoughts.  An uncomfortable comparison. I shook myself to life.  I righted the bird, no small problem, for he weighed almost two hundred pounds.  \"Well,\" Rene finally said, coming out of his mood, \"now that you have this bird, what are you going to do with it?\"  \"I had thought it might lead us to Uncle Izzy's fortune,\" I explained.         *       *       *       *       *  The bird obviously had no such intention. It was getting ready to take a nap.  \"A night bird,\" I told it reprovingly, \"shouldn't take a nap in the middle of the night.\"  \"All you're proving is that he has no self-respect,\" Rene pointed out. \"Why don't you look to see if he's got a note tagged to his leg or something?\"  I did. He didn't.  \"I think this whole thing is crazy,\" Rene said, \"but since he's a talking bird, you might ask him a few questions. Maybe he's trained to say something else.\"  \"Where is Uncle Izzy's fortune?\" I asked, when I had tugged at the dodo's feathers until he opened one eye.  He closed it.  \"Do you have a message for me?\"  He drew away from me irritably and closed the eye again, ruffling down into his feathers.  \"He may be keyed to respond to certain phrases. Try your uncle's name--he obviously knows that,\" Rene suggested coldly, wanting no part of this but unable to hold down the suggestion.  \"My name,\" I screamed at the somnolent dodo, \"is Isadore Summers.\"  He reared back and pecked the hell out of me.  I picked the book up off the floor and flipped through the bent pages until I found \"The Dodo.\" Maybe there'd be something in _that_.  \"Listen to this, Rene,\" I said, \"and see if you catch anything I might have missed.\"  Rene looked discomfited, but he didn't stop up his ears.  When I came"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51759"],["title","Traveling Companion Wanted (#1)"],["body","himself around to see what the light came from. Up ahead, apparently. As it got stronger, his eyes began to ache. It was a gorgeous ache, Regan said, and he stared ahead almost hypnotized. He made an effort and focused on the walls of the passageway he was being thrust along. They were white with streaks of black in them--like marble, but without marble's glossy hardness. He could see all parts of the tunnel now; it was roughly circular and had narrowed to a diameter of about two hundred feet.  Regan could only suppose that he was nearing the surface--that he'd been sweeping through some U-shaped fissure--and he adjusted himself kinesthetically to the theory that he was now traveling up instead of down. This took a lot of doing and occupied his mind.  His spirits soared with his imagined ascent and he could visualize himself traveling faster and faster until, with a pop, he would be thrust into the air and fall back to float on the surface. Regan wanted most desperately to be able to look at the sky again. It would be kind to see land, too, but a ship or a plane would do temporarily.         *       *       *       *       *  He was half lost in this reverie when he had to make a second adjustment. Remember, he thought he was going up, as from the bottom of a well. Therefore he was puzzled, as the radiance increased to daylight strength, to see one wall of his tubular, water-filled prison darken to deep green while the other turned a sort of blue-white-pink.  He was moving in the same swift rush of current, his body positioned so that he was facing the green half. He twisted as if to face the opposite way in an elevator and then became giddy when the entire concept of his surroundings did a ninety-degree flop.  In that split second, Regan realized that he wasn't traveling vertically, but horizontally.  The well he had pictured himself in now took on the aspect of a river, with the bright blend of colors the sky, and the deep green the river bed. The banks of the river were above him. Regan gave himself a tiny rocket assist to rise.  He wasn't at all prepared for what he saw. Far away beyond the green plain through which the river was racing was a city.  Unmistakably it was a metropolis of Man, not towering or turreted, but massive and with a relative newness which spoke of life. And as he had this thought, he could see other, smaller dwellings closer by, one-storied and circular, in a variety of colors.  He noted then that the level of the river was higher than that of the land, that the marblelike banks which channeled the racing water had become a transparent, glasslike substance which rose and curved in a seemingly endless archway. The torrent completely filled the half-transparent tube, flowing smoothly so that he almost had the sensation of flying above the ground.  Regan maneuvered toward the top and from there he saw the road. It paralleled the river and ran in a straight line as far as he could see. While he watched, a vehicle sped along it from behind, paced beside him and then pulled ahead. The driver was only vaguely visible, but he had a reassuringly human appearance. The man in the car, which was a three-wheeled, boxlike affair of brilliant yellow, looked neither left nor right.  Regan yelled instinctively and waved. The cumbersome motion turned him over on his back. Opportunistically, he studied the sky from his new position, but could make nothing of it. There were no clouds, only the blue-white-pink brightness that seemed to extend to infinity.         *       *       *       *       *  Something flashed across his field of vision. Regan caught only a glimpse of it, then reasoned that it must have been a bridge, spanning the enclosed river. He twisted himself around to a prone position and tried to think constructively.  Somewhere there had to be an exit to this land. For his sake, there had to be, although of course this guaranteed nothing. But surely these people made use of this abundant supply of water. It would be fresh and good to drink after its long passage through the Earth, despite its source in the salt ocean. They would use it for irrigation, probably, and perhaps somewhere it was channeled for transportation--of a more comfortable kind than his own. And they might use it for power. Certainly its rushing strength would be tapped.  This thought scared him. He pictured a giant hydroelectric plant into which he would be swept and in the bowels of which his body would be mangled by the blades of a turbine.  He had to slow his mad passage. He maneuvered the equipment attached to his spacesuit and pointed the rocket exhaust ahead of him. He flicked on the power and felt his speed being cut. The powerful current pressed from behind him like a live thing, but the rocket thrust was strong, too. His progress slackened to the pace of a canoe.  Balancing himself behind the makeshift braking apparatus was difficult, both because the torrent threatened constantly to turn him end for end, and because his strength was only a memory of itself. But somehow Regan managed to achieve an equilibrium which allowed him to look about and reassure himself that the city was still there. Its position had shifted on the horizon to a point slightly behind him, but there apparently was no end to the expanse of this underground world. The road was there, too, still parallel to the roofed-over river.  A surge of hope went through him as he spotted a man walking along the road.  Regan braked himself still further, until his speed matched that of the man. The man's costume was a brief one--knee-length trousers, a vestlike garment over a white skin, and sandals--so apparently the climate was tropical.  Regan stared hard at the man, mutely begging him to turn. Both Regan's hands gripped the rocket tube; he didn't dare let go to wave. Then, as though he had been reached telepathically, the man looked in Regan's direction. Regan couldn't make out his expression, but apparently it was one of disbelief. The man stopped, took an indecisive step and then ran toward the river. He jogged alongside it and now Regan could see his face clearly.         *       *       *       *       *  It was an intelligent face--round, broad-nosed, the eyes almond-shaped and the hair abundant and black. The man's body was stocky and powerful, graceful as he ran beside the tubed-in river. He waved and smiled, and Regan hoped his own answering smile was visible behind the faceplate of his spacesuit.  Regan doubted that telepathy had anything to do with making the man notice him originally; nevertheless, he thought furiously: \"How do I get out of here?\"  The response was made more to Regan's obvious predicament than because of thought transference, he was sure; at any rate, the man pointed, then raced ahead.  Regan lost sight of him for an agonizingly long minute or two, then saw him again, standing and pointing up. Another bridge was spanning the river. The man gestured to it emphatically, then pointed ahead again and held up two fingers. Alternately he pointed to the bridge and gestured with his fingers. Regan decided that this meant there would be some sort of help for him at the second bridge beyond. He nodded his head vigorously.  The man seemed to see the motion. He nodded and smiled.  Regan cut the power of the rocket engine and let the current speed his journey. The man outside increased his own pace, and when another bridge swept overhead, he nodded and held up one finger. Regan trembled with relief at this confirmation of the pantomimed message. He fought back the weariness that had begun to creep over him again, and clung doggedly to the rocket whose exhaust regulated his speed to that of the running man.  Regan thought the bridge would never be reached. He felt supremely weary. He was sopping wet, his eyes kept going out of focus, his throat ached, and his head was throbbing with jagged pains. It took all his waning strength to cling to consciousness.         *       *       *       *       *  Finally the bridge was in sight; then overhead. The running man pointed up. Beyond the bridge, the glasslike covering ended.  Regan was out of the tunnel.  The river widened now and its velocity eased. But the current was still a powerful one. Regan pointed the rocket tube so that it thrust him upward. His rubber- and steel-clothed head broke the surface. He felt a surge of freedom.  In his joy, Regan lost control of the rocket-brake and was twisted crazily about. Instinctively he shut off the power; he was swept ahead. As the river whirled him forward, he saw the man on the bank point ahead to the right, wave him on and gesture that he would catch up later.  It was with relief that Regan let himself be carried forward by the strong current. He was traveling out of the mainstream now. In a few minutes, the river was so broad that he seemed to be barely moving, but this was merely an illusion of contrast.  Then Regan saw the mesh fence. It was a giant strainer across the river, apparently fashioned to prevent debris from being carried into the structure which straddled the river beyond--without doubt the hydroelectric plant whose existence he had dreaded.  Regan was swept into the fence. It gave, cushioning the shock, and he pulled himself along it toward the bank. He reached it but lacked the strength to pull himself onto land.  Nearby, hugging the huge mesh fence, was the cask which had passed him back in the dark of the tunnel.  Just as Regan was passing out, he saw the stocky man in the knee-length shorts come into sight, running as fast as he could make his legs pump.         *       *       *       *       *  When Regan came to, he found himself being carried on the back of an open truck. He was lying there like a sack of cabbages, being bounced around as the truck sped over a bumpy road. His undersea friend was squatting next to him on the bed of the truck, holding onto the side to keep from being jolted off.  He smiled when he saw"]]]
