Besides, we use it as a showplace.\"  \"Showplace?\"  \"For skeptical politicians who come through,\" Johnny said, seating her in a chair near his desk. \"We give them the idea that the whole Sahara could eventually be like this square mile or so at Bidon Cinq. Palm trees, fruit trees, pines, shade trees. The works.\"  \"And could it?\"  Johnny grinned sourly. \"Well, not exactly. Not all in one spot, at least. You've got to remember, the Sahara covers an area of some three and a half million square miles. In that area you find almost everything.\"  \"Everything except water, eh?\" She was tapping a cigarette on a polish-reddened thumbnail. As he lit it for her, Johnny McCord realized that he hadn't seen fingernail polish for a year. He decided it was too long.  \"Even water, in some parts,\" he said. \"There's more water than most people realize. For instance, the Niger, which runs right through a considerable part of the Sahara, is the eleventh largest river in the world. But until our commission went to work on it, it dumped itself into the Gulf of Guinea, unused.\"  \"The Niger is a long way from here,\" she said through her smoke.  He nodded. \"For that matter, though, we have a certain amount of rain, particularly in the highland regions of the central massif. In the past, with no watershed at all, it ran off, buried itself in the sands, or evaporated.\"  \"Mr. McCord,\" she said, \"you are amazingly optimistic. Formerly, I must admit I had little knowledge of the Sahara Reforestation Commission. And I deliberately avoided studying up on the subject after receiving this assignment, because I wanted first impression to be received on the spot. However, I've just driven across the Sahara. My impression is that your Commission is one great--_Comment dit-on?_--boon-doggling project, a super-W.P.A. into which to plow your American resources and manpower. It is a fake, a delusion. This part of the world has never been anything but wasteland, and never will be.\"  Johnny McCord heard her out without change in expression.  He'd been through this before. In fact, almost every time a junketing congressman came through. There was danger in the viewpoint, of course. If the fantastic sums of money which were being spent were cut off, such pessimistic views would become automatically correct.  He took the paperweight from a stack of the correspondence on his desk and handed it to her.  She looked at it and scowled--very prettily, but still a scowl. \"What is this? It's a beautiful piece of stone.\"  \"I picked it up myself,\" Johnny said. \"Near Reggan. It's a chunk of petrified wood, Miss Desage. From a tree that must have originally had a diameter of some ten feet. Not quite a redwood, of course, but big.\"  \"Yes,\" she said, turning it over in her hand. \"I can see this part, which must have once been bark. But why do you show it to me?\"  \"The Sahara was once a semi-tropical, moist area, highly wooded. It can become so again.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She put the piece of fossil back on his desk. \"How long ago?\" she said bluntly.  \"A very long time ago, admittedly. During the last Ice Age and immediately afterwards. But, given man's direction, it can be done again. And it must be.\"  She raised pencilled eyebrows at him. \"Must be?\"  Johnny McCord shifted in his chair. \"You must be aware of the world's population explosion, Miss Desage. The human race can't allow three and a half million square miles of land to be valueless.\" He grunted in deprecation. \"And at the rate it was going, it would have been four million before long.\"  She didn't understand.  Johnny spelled it out for her. \"A desert can be man-made. Have you ever been in the Middle East?\" At her nod, he went on. \"Visitors there usually wonder how in the world the ancient Jews could ever have thought of that area as a land of milk and honey. On the face of it, it's nothing but badlands. What was once the Fertile Crescent now looks like Arizona.\"  Hélène Desage was frowning at him. \"And you suggest man did this--not nature?\"  \"The goat did it. The goat, and the use of charcoal as fuel. Along with ignorance of soil erosion and the destruction of the wonderful watershed based on the Cedars of Lebanon. Same thing applies to large areas of Libya and Tunisia, and to Morocco and Spain. Those countries used to be some of the richest agricultural areas of the Roman Empire. But you can't graze goats, probably the most destructive animal domesticated, and you can't depend on charcoal for fuel, unless you want to create desert.\"  \"Those things happened a long time ago.\"  Johnny snorted. \"When we first began operations, the Sahara was going south at the rate of two miles a year. Goats prefer twigs and bark even to grass. They strip a country.\"  \"Well,\" the reporter said, shrugging shapely shoulders, \"at any rate, the task is one of such magnitude as to be fantastic. Yesterday, I drove for nearly eight hours without seeing even a clump of cactus.\"  \"The route you traveled is comparatively untouched by our efforts, thus far,\" Johnny nodded agreeably. \"However, we're slowly coming down from Algeria, up from the Niger, and, using the new chemical methods of freshening sea water, east from Mauretania.\"  He came to his feet and pointed out spots on the large wall map. \"Our territory, of course, is only this area which once was called French West Africa, plus Algeria. The battle is being fought elsewhere by others. The Egyptians and Sudanese are doing a fairly good job in their country, with Soviet Complex help. The Tunisians are doing a wonderful job with the assistance of Common Europe, especially Italy.\"  She stood beside him and tried to understand. \"What is this area, here, shaded green?\"  He said proudly, \"That's how far we've got so far, heading north from the Niger. In the past, the desert actually came down to the side of the river in many places. The water was completely wasted. Now we've diverted it and are reforesting anywhere up to three miles a year.\"  \"Three miles a year,\" she scoffed. \"You'll take five centuries.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He shook his head and grinned. \"It's a progressive thing. Water is admittedly the big problem. But as our forests grow, they themselves bring up the moisture content of the climate. Down in this area--\" he made a sweeping gesture over the map which took in large sections north of the Niger--\"we've put in hundreds of millions of slash pine, which is particularly good for sandy soil and fast growing. In ten years you've gone from two-year-old seedlings to a respectable forest.\"  Johnny pointed out Bidon Cinq on the map. \"At the same time we found what amounts to a subterranean sea in this area. Not a real sea, of course, but a water-bearing formation or aquifer, deep down under the surface of the earth--layers of rock and gravel in which large quantities of water are lying. The hydro-geological technicians who surveyed it estimate that it holds reserves of several billion tons of water. Utilizing it, we've put in several hundred square miles of seedlings and transplants of various varieties. Where there are natural oases, of course, we stress a lot of date palm. In rocky areas it's _acacia tortila_. In the mountains we sometimes use varieties of the pinyon--they'll take quite a beating but are a little on the slow-growing side.\"  She was looking at him from the sides of her eyes. \"You're all taken up by this, aren't you Mr. McCord?\"  Johnny said, surprise in his voice. \"Why, it's my work.\"  Derek came sauntering in and scaled his sun helmet onto his own desk. \"Good morning, Mademoiselle,\" he said. And to Johnny, \"Hiram, that city slicker from Timbuktu just came up with his posse.\"  Hélène said, \"What is this _Si_, _Hiram_ and _Reuben_ which you call each other?\"  Johnny smiled sourly, \"In a way, Miss Desage, this is just one great tree farm. And all of us are farmers. So we make jokes about it.\" He thought for a moment. \"Derek, possibly you better take over with Mohammed. I want to get over to In Ziza with Reuben.\"  \"To see about the pumps?\" Hélène said innocently.  Johnny frowned but was saved from an answer by the entrance of Mohammed Mohmoud. He was dark as a Saharan becomes dark, his original Berber blood to be seen only in his facial characteristics. He wore the rather flamboyant Mali Federation desert uniform with an air.  When he saw the girl, his eyebrows rose and he made the Moslem salaam with a sweeping flourish.  Johnny said, \"Mademoiselle Desage, may I present Captain Mohammed Mohmoud ould Cheikh, of the Mali desert patrol.\" He added sourly, \"The officer in charge of preventing nomads from filtering up from the south into our infant forests.\"  The Moslem scowled at him. \"They could have come from the east, from Timmissao,\" he said in quite passable English. \"Or even from Mauritania.\" He turned his eyes to Hélène Desage. \"_Enchanté, Mademoiselle. Trés heureux de faire ta connaissance._\"  She gave him the full benefit of her eyes. \"_Moi aussi, Monsieur._\"  Johnny wasn't through with the Malian officer. \"There's a hundred of them,\" he snapped, \"with several thousand head of goats and other livestock. It would have been impossible to push that number across from Mauritania or even from the east, and you know it.\"  A lighter complexion would have shown a flush. Mohammed Mohmoud's displeasure was limited in expression to a flashing of desert eyes. He said, \"Wherever their origin, the task would seem to be immediately to destroy the animals. That is why my men and I are here.\"  Pierre Marimbert had entered while the conversation was going on. He said, \"Johnny, weren't you going over to In Ziza with me?\"  Hélène Desage said, the tip of her right forefinger to her chin as she portrayed thought, \"I can't decide where to go. To this crisis of the Tuareg, or to the crisis of the pumps--whatever that is.\"  Johnny said flatly, \"Sorry, but you'd just be in the way at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/518"],["title","The Enchanted Island of Yew (#1)"],["body","me!  Why, my dear girls, you are the uninvited ones--indeed you are--to thus come romping into our fairy bower.\"  The children did not open their eyes any wider on hearing this speech, for they could not; but their faces expressed their amazement fully, while Helda gasped the words:  \"A fairy bower!  We are in a fairy bower!\"  \"Most certainly,\" was the reply.  \"And as for being odd in appearance, let me ask how you could reasonably expect a fairy to appear as mortal maidens do?\"  \"A fairy!\" exclaimed Seseley.  \"Are you, then, a real fairy?\"  \"I regret to say I am,\" returned the other, more soberly, as she patted a moss-bank with a silver-tipped wand.  Then for a moment there was silence, while the three girls sat very still and stared at their immortal companion with evident curiosity. Finally Seseley asked:  \"Why do you regret being a fairy?  I have always thought them the happiest creatures in the world.\"  \"Perhaps we ought to be happy,\" answered the fairy, gravely, \"for we have wonderful powers and do much to assist you helpless mortals.  And I suppose some of us really are happy.  But, for my part, I am so utterly tired of a fairy life that I would do anything to change it.\"  \"That is strange,\" declared Berna.  \"You seem very young to be already discontented with your lot.\"  Now at this the fairy burst into laughter again, and presently asked:  \"How old do you think me?\"  \"About our own age,\" said Berna, after a glance at her and a moment's reflection.  \"Nonsense!\" retorted the fairy, sharply.  \"These trees are hundreds of years old, yet I remember when they were mere twigs.  And I remember when mortals first came to live upon this island, yes--and when this island was first created and rose from the sea after a great earthquake.  I remember for many, many centuries, my dears.  I have grown tired of remembering--and of being a fairy continually, without any change to brighten my life.\"  \"To be sure!\" said Seseley, with sympathy.  \"I never thought of fairy life in that way before.  It must get to be quite tiresome.\"  \"And think of the centuries I must yet live!\" exclaimed the fairy in a dismal voice.  \"Isn't it an awful thing to look forward to?\"  \"It is, indeed,\" agreed Seseley.  \"I'd be glad to exchange lives with you,\" said Helda, looking at the fairy with intense admiration.  \"But you can't do that,\" answered the little creature quickly. \"Mortals can't become fairies, you know--although I believe there was once a mortal who was made immortal.\"  \"But fairies can become anything they desire!\" cried Berna.  \"Oh, no, they can't.  You are mistaken if you believe that,\" was the reply.  \"I could change YOU into a fly, or a crocodile, or a bobolink, if I wanted to; but fairies can't change themselves into anything else.\"  \"How strange!\" murmured Seseley, much impressed.  \"But YOU can,\" cried the fairy, jumping up and coming toward them. \"You are mortals, and, by the laws that govern us, a mortal can change a fairy into anything she pleases.\"  \"Oh!\" said Seseley, filled with amazement at the idea.  The fairy fell on her knees before the baron's daughter. \"Please--please, dear Seseley,\" she pleaded, \"change me into a mortal!\"    4.  Prince Marvel  It is easy to imagine the astonishment of the three girls at hearing this strange request.  They gazed in a bewildered fashion upon the kneeling fairy, and were at first unable to answer one word.  Then Seseley said--sadly, for she grieved to disappoint the pretty creature:  \"We are but mortal children, and have no powers of enchantment at all.\"  \"Ah, that is true, so far as concerns yourselves,\" replied the fairy, eagerly; \"yet mortals may easily transform fairies into anything they wish.\"  \"If that is so, why have we never heard of this power before?\" asked Seseley.  \"Because fairies, as a rule, are content with their lot, and do not wish to appear in any form but their own.  And, knowing that evil or mischievous mortals can transform them at will, the fairies take great care to remain invisible, so they can not be interfered with.  Have you ever,\" she asked, suddenly, \"seen a fairy before?\"  \"Never,\" replied Seseley.  \"Nor would you have seen me to-day, had I not known you were kind and pure-hearted, or had I not resolved to ask you to exercise your powers upon me.\"  \"I must say,\" remarked Helda, boldly, \"that you are foolish to wish to become anything different from what you are.\"  \"For you are very beautiful NOW,\" added Berna, admiringly.  \"Beautiful!\" retorted the fairy, with a little frown; \"what does beauty amount to, if one is to remain invisible?\"  \"Not much, that is true,\" agreed Berna, smoothing her own dark locks.  \"And as for being foolish,\" continued the fairy, \"I ought to be allowed to act foolishly if I want to.  For centuries past I have not had a chance to do a single foolish thing.\"  \"Poor dear!\" said Helda, softly.  Seseley had listened silently to this conversation.  Now she inquired:  \"What do you wish to become?\"  \"A mortal!\" answered the fairy, promptly.  \"A girl, like ourselves?\" questioned the baron's daughter.  \"Perhaps,\" said the fairy, as if undecided.  \"Then you would be likely to endure many privations,\" said Seseley, gently.  \"For you would have neither father nor mother to befriend you, nor any house to live in.\"  \"And if you hired your services to some baron, you would be obliged to wash dishes all day, or mend clothing, or herd cattle,\" said Berna.  \"But I should travel all over the island,\" said the fairy, brightly, \"and that is what I long to do.  I do not care to work.\"  \"I fear a girl would not be allowed to travel alone,\" Seseley remarked, after some further thought.  \"At least,\" she added, \"I have never heard of such a thing.\"  \"No,\" said the fairy, rather bitterly, \"your men are the ones that roam abroad and have adventures of all kinds.  Your women are poor, weak creatures, I remember.\"  There was no denying this, so the three girls sat silent until Seseley asked:  \"Why do you wish to become a mortal?\"  \"To gain exciting experiences,\" answered the fairy.  \"I'm tired of being a humdrum fairy year in and year out.  Of course, I do not wish to become a mortal for all time, for that would get monotonous, too; but to live a short while as the earth people do would amuse me very much.\"  \"If you want variety, you should become a boy,\" said Helda, with a laugh, \"The life of a boy is one round of excitement.\"  \"Then make me a boy!\" exclaimed the fairy eagerly.  \"A boy!\" they all cried in consternation.  And Seseley added:  \"Why--you're a GIRL fairy, aren't you?\"  \"Well--yes; I suppose I am,\" answered the beautiful creature, smiling; \"but as you are going to change me anyway, I may as well become a boy as a girl.\"  \"Better!\" declared Helda, clapping her hands; \"for then you can do as you please.\"  \"But would it be right?\" asked Seseley, with hesitation.  \"Why not?\" retorted the fairy.  \"I can see nothing wrong in being a boy.  Make me a tall, slender youth, with waving brown hair and dark eyes.  Then I shall be as unlike my own self as possible, and the adventure will be all the more interesting.  Yes; I like the idea of being a boy very much indeed.\"  \"But I don't know how to transform you; some one will have to show me the way to do it,\" protested Seseley, who was getting worried over the task set her.  \"Oh, that will be easy enough,\" returned the little immortal.  \"Have you a wand?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then I'll loan you mine, for I shall not need it.  And you must wave it over my head three times and say: 'By my mortal powers I transform you into a boy for the space of one year'.\"  \"One year!  Isn't that too long?\"  \"It's a very short time to one who has lived thousands of years as a fairy.\"  \"That is true,\" answered the baron's daughter.  \"Now, I'll begin by doing a little transforming myself,\" said the fairy, getting upon her feet again, \"and you can watch and see how I do it.\"  She brushed a bit of moss from her gauzy skirts and continued: \"If I'm to become a boy I shall need a horse, you know.  A handsome, prancing steed, very fleet of foot.\"  A moment she stood motionless, as if listening.  Then she uttered a low but shrill whistle.  The three girls, filled with eager interest, watched her intently.  Presently a trampling of footsteps was heard through the brushwood, and a beautiful deer burst from the forest and fearlessly ran to the fairy. Without hesitation she waved her wand above the deer's head and exclaimed:  \"By all my fairy powers I command you to become a war-horse for the period of one year.\"  Instantly the deer disappeared, and in its place was a handsome charger, milk-white in color, with flowing mane and tail.  Upon its back was a saddle sparkling with brilliant gems sewn upon fine dressed leather.  The girls uttered cries of astonishment and delight, and the fairy said:  \"You see, these transformations are not at all difficult.  I must now have a sword.\"  She plucked a twig from a near-by tree and cast it upon the ground at her feet.  Again she waved her wand--and the twig turned to a gleaming sword, richly engraved, that seemed to the silent watchers to tremble slightly in its sheath, as if its heart of steel throbbed with hopes of battles to come.  \"And now I must have shield and armor,\" said the fairy, gaily.  \"This will make a shield,\"--and she stripped a sheet of loose bark from a tree-trunk,--\"but for armor I must have something better.  Will you give me your cloak?\"  This appeal was made to Seseley, and the baron's daughter drew her white velvet cloak from her shoulders and handed it to the fairy.  A moment later it was transformed into a suit of glittering armor that seemed fashioned of pure silver inlaid with gold, while the sheet of bark at the same time became a handsome shield, with the figures of three girls graven upon it.  Seseley recognized the features as those of herself and her comrades, and noted also that they appeared sitting at the edge of a forest, the great trees showing plainly in the background. "]]]
