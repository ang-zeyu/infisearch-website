Music should not be silent.  When the piano was uncovered, Brian delayed. He flexed his hands unnecessarily. He fussed with the candelabrum on the wall, lighting three candles, then blowing out two for economy. He admitted presently that he did not want the serene clarity of Mozart at all right now. This evening, the darkness of 2070 was closer than he had felt it for a long time. It would never have occurred to Mozart, Brian thought, that a world could die. Beethoven could have entertained the idea soberly enough; Chopin probably; even Brahms. Mozart would surely have dismissed it as somebody's bad dream, in poor taste.  Andrew Carr, who lived and died in the latter half of the 20th century, had endured the idea from the beginning of his childhood. The date of Hiroshima was 1945; Carr was born in 1951; the inexhaustible wealth of his music was written between 1969, when he was eighteen, and 1984, when he died in an Egyptian jail from injuries received in a street brawl.  \"If not Mozart,\" said Brian to his idle hands, \"there is always The Project.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Playing Carr's last sonata as it should be played--as Carr was supposed to have said he couldn't play it himself--Brian had been thinking of that as The Project for many years. It had begun long before the war, at the time of his triumphs in a civilized world which had been warmly appreciative of the polished interpretive artist, although no more awake than any other age to the creative one. Back there in the undestroyed society, Brian had proposed to program that sonata in the company of works that were older but no greater, and play it--yes, beyond his best, so that even critics would begin to see its importance.  He had never done it, had never felt that he had entered into the sonata and learned the depth of it. Now, when there was none to hear or care, unless maybe the harmless brown spiders in the corners of the auditorium had a taste for music, there was still The Project.  \"_I_ hear,\" Brian said. \"_I_ care, and with myself as audience I want to hear it once as it ought to be, a final statement for a world that couldn't live and yet was too good to die.\"  Technically, of course, he had it. The athletic demands Carr made on the performer were tremendous, but, given technique, there was nothing impossible about them. Anyone capable of concert work could at least play the notes at the required tempos. And any reasonably shrewd pianist could keep track of the dynamics, saving strength for the shattering finale in spite of the thunderings that must come before. Brian had heard the sonata played by others two or three times in the old days--competently. Competency was not enough.  For example, what about the third movement, that mad Scherzo, and the five tiny interludes of sweet quiet scattered through its plunging fury? They were not alike. Related, perhaps, but each one demanded a new climate of heart and mind--tenderness, regret, simple relaxation. Flowers on a flood--no. Warm window-lights in a storm--no. The innocence of an unknowing child in a bombed city--no, not really. Something of all those, but much more, too.  What of the second movement, the Largo, where, in a way, the pattern was reversed, the midnight introspection interrupted by moments of anger, or longing, or despair like that of an angel beating his wings against a prison of glass?  It was, throughout, a work in which something of Carr's life and Carr's temperament had to come into you, whether you dared welcome it or not; otherwise, your playing was no more than a bumbling reproduction of notes on a page.  Carr's life was not for the contemplation of the timid.         *       *       *       *       *  The details were superficially well known. The biographies themselves were like musical notation, meaningless without interpretation and insight.  Carr had been a drunken roarer, a young devil-god with such a consuming hunger for life that he had choked to death on it. His friends hated him for the way he drained their lives, loving them to distraction and always loving his work a little more. His enemies must have had times of helplessly adoring him, if only because of an impossible transparent honesty that made him more and less than human.  A rugged Australian, not tall but built like a hero, a face all forehead and jaw and glowing hyperthyroid eyes. He wept only when he was angry, the biographers said. In one minute of talk, they said, he might shift from gutter obscenity to some extreme of altruistic tenderness, and from that to a philosophical comment of the coldest intelligence.  He passed his childhood on a sheep farm, ran away to sea on a freighter at thirteen, studied like a slave in London with a single-minded desperation, even through the horrors of the Pandemic of 1972. He was married twice and twice divorced. He killed a man in an imbecile quarrel on the New Orleans docks, and wrote his First Symphony while he was in jail for that. And he died of stab wounds in a Cairo jail. It all had relevancy. Relevant or not, if the sonata was in your mind, so was the life.  You had to remember also that Andrew Carr was the last of civilization's great composers. No one in the 21st century approached him--they ignored his explorations and carved cherry-stones. He belonged to no school, unless you wanted to imagine a school of music beginning with Bach, taking in perhaps a dozen along the way, and ending with Carr himself. His work was a summary and, in the light of the year 2070, a completion.  Brian was certain he could play the first movement of the sonata acceptably. Technically, it was not revolutionary, but closely loyal to the ancient sonata form. Carr had even written in a conventional double-bar for a repeat of the entire opening statement, something that made late 20th century critics sneer with great satisfaction. It never occurred to them that Carr expected a performer to use his head.  The bright-sorrowful second movement, unfashionably long, with its strange pauses, unforeseen recapitulations, outbursts of savage change--that was where Brian's troubles began. It did not help him to be old, remembering the inner storms of twenty-five years ago and more.         *       *       *       *       *  As the single candle fluttered, Brian realized that he had forgotten to lock the door. That troubled him, but he did not rise from the piano chair. He chided himself instead for the foolish neuroses of aloneness--what could it matter?  He shut his eyes. The sonata had long ago been memorized; printed copies were safe somewhere in the library. He played the opening of the first movement, as far as the double-bar; opened his eyes to the friendly black and white of clean keys and played the repetition with new light, new emphasis. Better than usual, he thought.  Now that soaring modulation into A Major that only Carr would have wanted just there in just that sudden way, like the abrupt happening upon shining fields. On toward the climax--_I am playing it, I think_--through the intricate revelations of development and recapitulation. And the conclusion, lingering, half-humorous, not unlike a Beethoven ending, but with a questioning that was all Andrew Carr.  After that--  \"No more tonight,\" said Brian aloud. \"Some night, though.... Not competent right now, my friend. Fear's a many-aspect thing. But The Project....\"  He replaced the cover on the Steinway and blew out the candle. He had brought no torch, long use having taught his feet every inch of the short journey. It was quite dark. The never-opened western windows of the auditorium were dirty, most of the dirt on the outside, crusted wind-blow salt.  In this partial darkness, something was wrong.  At first Brian could find no source for the faint light, the dim orange with a hint of motion that had no right to be here. He peered into the gloom of the auditorium, fixed his eyes on the oblong of blacker shadow that was the door he meant to use, but it told him nothing.  The windows, of course. He had almost forgotten there were any. The light, hardly deserving the name, was coming through them. But sunset was surely well past; he had been here a long time, delaying and brooding before he played. Sunset should not flicker.  So there was some kind of fire on the mainland. There had been no thunderstorm. How could fire start, over there where no one ever came?         *       *       *       *       *  He stumbled a few times, swearing petulantly, locating the doorway again and groping through it into the Hall of Music. The windows out here were just as dirty; no use trying to see through them. There must have been a time when he had enjoyed looking through them.  He stood shivering in the marble silence, trying to remember.  He could not. Time was a gradual eternal dying. Time was a long growth of dirt and ocean salt, sealing in, covering over forever.  He stumbled for his cave, hurrying now, and lit two candles. He left one by the cold stove and used the other to light his way down the stairs to his raft. Once down there, he blew it out, afraid. The room a candle makes in the darkness is a vulnerable room. With no walls, it closes in a blindness. He pulled the raft by the guide-rope, gently, for fear of noise.  He found his canoe tied as he had left it. He poked his white head slowly beyond the sill, staring west.  Merely a bonfire gleaming, reddening the blackness of the cliff.  Brian knew the spot, a ledge almost at water level. At one end of it was the troublesome path he used in climbing up to the forest. Usable driftwood was often there, the supply renewed by the high tides.  \"No,\" Brian said. \"Oh, no....\"  Unable to accept, or believe, or not believe, he drew his head in, resting his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51380"],["title","Time In the Round (#1)"],["body","get a brief forward push, but it would be nullified when you rocked forward. A slow swimming stroke was the simplest way to make progress.  The general sensation, however, was delightful and levitators were among the most prized of toys.  \"There's the Theater,\" Joggy announced.  \"I _know_,\" the Butcher said irritably.  But even he sounded a little solemn and subdued. From the Great Ramp to the topmost airy finial, the Time Theater was the dream of a god realized in unearthly substance. It imparted the aura of demigods to the adults drifting up and down the ramp.  \"My father remembers when there wasn't a Time Theater,\" Hal said softly as he scanned the facade's glowing charts and maps. \"Say, they're viewing Earth, somewhere in Scandinavia around zero in the B.C.-A.D. time scale. It should be interesting.\"  \"Will it be about Napoleon?\" the Butcher asked eagerly. \"Or Hitler?\" A red-headed adult heard and smiled and paused to watch. A lock of hair had fallen down the middle of the Butcher's forehead, and as he sat Joggy like a charger, he did bear a faint resemblance to one of the grim little egomaniacs of the Dawn Era.  \"Wrong millennium,\" Hal said.  \"Tamerlane then?\" the Butcher pressed. \"He killed cities and piled the skulls. Blood-bath stuff. Oh, yes, and Tamerlane was a Scand of the Navies.\"  Hal looked puzzled and then quickly erased the expression. \"Well, even if it is about Tamerlane, you can't see it. How about it, Joggy?\"  \"They won't let me in, either.\"  \"Yes, they will. You're five years old now.\"  \"But I don't feel any older,\" Joggy replied doubtfully.  \"The feeling comes at six. Don't worry, the usher will notice the difference.\"  Hal and Joggy switched off their levitators and dropped to their feet. The Butcher came down rather hard, twisting an ankle. He opened his mouth to cry, then abruptly closed it hard, bearing his pain in tight-lipped silence like an ancient soldier--like Stalin, maybe, he thought. The red-headed adult's face twitched in half-humorous sympathy.  Hal and Joggy mounted the Ramp and entered a twilit corridor which drank their faint footsteps and returned pulses of light. The Butcher limped manfully after them, but when he got inside, he forgot his battle injury.         *       *       *       *       *  Hal looked back. \"Honestly, the usher will stop you.\"  The Butcher shook his head. \"I'm going to think my way in. I'm going to think old.\"  \"You won't be able to fool the usher, Butcher. You under-fives simply aren't allowed in the Time Theater. There's a good reason for it--something dangerous might happen if an under-five got inside.\"  \"Why?\"  \"I don't exactly know, but something.\"  \"Hah! I bet they're scared we'd go traveling in the Time Bubble and have some excitement.\"  \"They are not. I guess they just know you'd get bored and wander away from your seats and maybe disturb the adults or upset the electronics or something. But don't worry about it, Butcher. The usher will take care of you.\"  \"Shut up--I'm thinking I'm World Director,\" the Butcher informed them, contorting his face diabolically.  Hal spoke to the uninjes, pointing to the side of the corridor. Obediently four of them lined up.  But Brute was peering down the corridor toward where it merged into a deeper darkness. His short legs stiffened, his neckless head seemed to retreat even further between his powerful shoulders, his lips writhed back to show his gleaming fangs, and a completely unfamiliar sound issued from his throat. A choked, grating sound. A growl. The other uninjes moved uneasily.  \"Do you suppose something's the matter with his circuits?\" Joggy whispered. \"Maybe he's getting racial memories from the Scands.\"  \"Of course not,\" Hal said irritably.  \"Brute, get over there,\" the Butcher commanded. Unwillingly, eyes still fixed on the blackness ahead, Brute obeyed.  The three boys started on. Hal and Joggy experienced a vaguely electrical tingling that vanished almost immediately. They looked back. The Butcher had been stopped by an invisible wall.  \"I told you you couldn't fool the usher,\" Hal said.  The Butcher hurled himself forward. The wall gave a little, then bounced him back with equal force.  \"I bet it'll be a bum time view anyway,\" the Butcher said, not giving up, but not trying again. \"And I still don't think the usher can tell how old you are. I bet there's an over-age teacher spying on you through a hole, and if he doesn't like your looks, he switches on the usher.\"         *       *       *       *       *  But the others had disappeared in the blackness. The Butcher waited and then sat down beside the uninjes. Brute laid his head on his knee and growled faintly down the corridor.  \"Take it easy, Brute,\" the Butcher consoled him. \"I don't think Tamerlane was really a Scand of the Navies anyhow.\"  Two chattering girls hardly bigger than himself stepped through the usher as if it weren't there.  The Butcher grimly slipped out the metal tube and put it to his lips. There were two closely spaced faint _plops_ and a large green stain appeared on the bare back of one girl, while purple fluid dripped from the close-cropped hair of the other.  They glared at him and one of them said: \"A cub!\" But he had his arms folded and wasn't looking at them.  Meanwhile, subordinate ushers had guided Hal and Joggy away from the main entrance to the Time Theater. A sphincter dilated and they found themselves in a small transparent cubicle from which they could watch the show without disturbing the adult audience. They unstrapped their levitators, laid them on the floor and sat down.  The darkened auditorium was circular. Rising from a low central platform was a huge bubble of light, its lower surface somewhat flattened. The audience was seated in concentric rows around the bubble, their keen and compassionate faces dimly revealed by the pale central glow.  But it was the scene within the bubble that riveted the attention of the boys.  Great brooding trees, the trunks of the nearer ones sliced by the bubble's surface, formed the background. Through the dark, wet foliage appeared glimpses of a murky sky, while from the ceiling of the bubble, a ceaseless rain dripped mournfully. A hooded figure crouched beside a little fire partly shielded by a gnarled trunk. Squatting round about were wiry, blue-eyed men with shoulder-length blond hair and full blond beards. They were clothed in furs and metal-studded leather.  Here and there were scattered weapons and armor--long swords glistening with oil to guard them from rust, crudely painted circular shields, and helmets from which curved the horns of beasts. Back and forth, lean, wolflike dogs paced with restless monotony.         *       *       *       *       *  Sometimes the men seemed to speak together, or one would rise to peer down the misty forest vistas, but mostly they were motionless. Only the hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder and fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.  \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric cultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that Joggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply, whispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that, Joggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development and hears our questions and then it automats background and answers. But it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion microtapes, though.\"  The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time in the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived by pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We believe it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces of nature and see into the future.\"  Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the other side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he knew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light, can get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of the bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other way--for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the way. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"  Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's a kind of hole through time?\"  \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the locus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two points in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely open, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped--and so would an atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain the bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"  \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light, why can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"  \"Why--er--you see, Joggy--\"  The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way for matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward you, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the opposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked away along the vista down which they are peering.\"         *       *       *       *       *  As if to provide an example, a figure suddenly materialized on their side of the bubble. The wolflike dogs bared their fangs. For an instant, there was only an eerie, distorted, rapidly growing silhouette, changing from blood-red to black as the boundary of the bubble cross-sectioned the intruding figure. Then they recognized the back of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience on the other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for some time.  He bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag.  \"More atavistic cubs, big and little!"]]]
