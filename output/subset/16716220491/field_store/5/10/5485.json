The great cares associated with the state and the throne are hers; for the minor ones of the toilet and the heart I will provide.\"  Here she was interrupted by one of Cleopatra's waiting-maids.  The Queen had awakened, and Iras hastened to her post.  As she passed Charmian's apartments and saw two handsome soldiers, belonging to the Macedonian body-guard, pacing to and fro on duty before them, her face darkened.  It was against her alone that Charmian was protecting Barine.  She had been harshly reproved by the older woman on account of the artist's daughter, who had been the source of so many incidents which had caused her pain, and Iras regretted that she had ever confided to her aunt her love for Dion.  But, no matter what might happen, the upas-tree whence emanated all these tortures, anxieties, and vexations, must be rooted out--stricken from the ranks of the living.  Ere she entered the Queen's anteroom she had mentally pronounced sentence of death on her enemy.  Her inventive brain was now busy in devising means to induce the Syrian to undertake its execution.  If this stone of offence was removed it would again be possible to live in harmony with Charmian.  Dion would be free, and then, much as he had wounded her, she would defend him from the hatred of Philostratus and his brother.  She entered the Queen's presence with a lighter heart.  The death of a condemned person had long since ceased to move her deeply.  While rendering the first services to her mistress, who had been much refreshed by her sleep, her face grew brighter and brighter; for Cleopatra voluntarily told her that she was glad to have her attendance, and not be constantly annoyed by the same disagreeable matter, which must soon be settled.  In fact, Charmian, conscious that no one else at court would have ventured to do so, had never grown weary, spite of many a rebuff, of pleading Barine's cause until, the day before, Cleopatra, in a sudden fit of anger, had commanded her not to mention the mischief-maker again.  When Charmian soon after requested permission to let Iras take her place the following day, the Queen already regretted the harsh reproof she had given her friend, and, while cordially granting the desired leave, begged her to attribute her angry impatience to the cares which burdened her. \"And when you show me your kind, faithful face again,\" she concluded, \"you will have remembered that a true friend withholds from an unhappy woman whom she loves whatever will shadow more deeply her already clouded life.  This Barine's very name sounds like a jeer at the composure I maintain with so much difficulty.  I do not wish to hear it again.\"  The words were uttered in a tone so affectionate and winning, that Charmian's vexation melted like ice in the sun.  Yet she left the Queen's presence anxious and troubled; for ere she quitted the room Cleopatra remarked that she had committed the singer's affairs to Alexas.  She was now doubly eager to obtain a day's freedom, for she knew the unprincipled favourite's feelings towards the young beauty, and longed to discuss with Archibius the best means of guarding her from the worst perils.  When at a late hour she went to rest, she was served by the Nubian maid, who had accompanied her to the court from her parents' home.  She came from the Cataract, where she had been bought when the family of Alypius accompanied the child Cleopatra to the island of Philae.  Anukis was given to Charmian, who at the time was just entering womanhood, as the first servant who was her sole property, and she had proved so clever, skilful, apt to learn, and faithful, that her mistress took her, as her personal attendant, to the palace.  Charmian's warm, unselfish love for the Queen was equalled by Anukis's devotion to the mistress who had long since made her free, and had become so strongly attached to her that the Nubian's interests were little less regarded than her own.  Her sound, keen judgment and natural wit had gained a certain renown in the palace, and as Cleopatra often condescended to rouse her to an apt answer, Antony had done so, too; and since the slight crook in the back, which she had from childhood, had grown into a hump, he gave her the name of Aisopion--the female AEsop.  All the Queen's attendants now used it, and though others of lower rank did the same, she permitted it, though her ready wit would have supplied her tongue with a retort sharp enough to respond to any word which displeased her.  But she knew the life and fables of AEsop, who had also once been a slave, and deemed it an honour to be compared with him.  When Charmian had left Cleopatra and sought her chamber, she found Barine sound asleep, but Anukis was awaiting her, and her mistress told her with what deep anxiety for Barine she had quitted the presence of the Queen.  She knew that the Nubian was fond of the young matron, whom in her childhood she had carried in her arms, and whose father, Leonax, had often jested with her.  The maid had watched her career with much interest, and while Barine had been her mistress's guest her efforts to amuse and soothe her were unceasing.  She had gone every morning to Berenike to ask tidings of Dion's health, and always brought favourable news.  Anukis knew Philostratus and his brother, too, and as she liked Antony, who jested with her so kindly, she grieved to see an unprincipled fellow like Alexas his chief confidant. She knew the plots with which the Syrian had persecuted Barine, and when Charmian told her that the Queen had committed the young beauty's fate to this man's keeping her dark face grew fairly livid; but she forced herself to conceal the terror which the news inspired.  Her mistress was also aware what this choice meant to Barine.  But Anukis would have thought it wrong to disturb Charmian's sleep by revealing her own distress.  It was fortunate that she was going early the next morning to seek the aid of Archibius, whom Anukis believed to be the wisest of men; but this by no means soothed her.  She knew the fable of the lion and the mouse, which had been told in her home long before the time of the author for whom she was nicknamed, and already more than once she had been in a position to render far greater and more powerful persons an important service.  To soothe Charmian to sleep and turn her thoughts in another direction, she told her about Dion, whom she had found much better that day, how tenderly he seemed to love Barine, and how touchingly patient and worthy of her father the daughter of Leonax had been.  After her mistress had fallen asleep she went to the hall where, spite of the late hour, she expected to meet some of the servants--sure of being greeted as a welcome guest.  When, a short time later, Alexas's body- slave appeared, she filled his wire cup, sat down by his side, and tried with all the powers at her command to win his confidence.  And so well did the elderly Nubian succeed that Marsyas, a handsome young Ligurian, after she had gone, declared that Aisopion's jokes and stories were enough to bring the dead to life, and it was as pleasant to talk seriously with the brown-skinned monster as to dally with a fair-haired sweetheart.  After Charmian had left the palace the following morning, Anukis again sought Marsyas and learned from him for what purpose and at what hour Iras had summoned Alexas.  His master was continually whispering with the languishing Macedonian.  When Anukis returned, Barine seemed troubled because she brought no tidings from her mother and Dion; but the Nubian entreated her to have patience, and gave her some books and a spindle, that she might have occupation in her solitude.  She, Anukis, must go to the kitchen, because she had heard yesterday that the cook had bought some mushrooms, which might be poisonous; she knew the fungi and wanted to see them.  Then, passing into Charmian's chamber, she glided through the corridor which connected the apartments of Cleopatra's confidential attendants, and slipped into Iras's room.  When Alexas entered she was concealed behind one of the hangings which covered the walls of the reception-room.  After the Syrian had retired and Iras had been called away, Anukis returned to Barine and said that the mushrooms had really been poisonous, and of the deadliest species.  They had been cooked, and she must go out to seek an antidote.  Since a precious human life might be at stake, Barine would not wish to keep her.  \"Go,\" said the latter, kindly.  \"But if you are the old obliging Aisopion, you won't object to going a little farther.\"  \"And inquiring at the house near the Paneum garden,\" added Anukis. \"That was already settled.  Longing is also a poison for a loving heart, and its antidote is good news.\"  With these laughing words she left her favourite; but as soon as she was out of doors her black brow became lined with earnest thought, and she stood pondering a long time.  At last she went to the Bruchium to hire a donkey to ride to Kanopus, where she hoped to find Archibius.  It was difficult to reach the nearest stand; for a great crowd had assembled on the quay between the Lochias and the Corner of the Muses, and groups of the common people, sailors, and slaves were constantly flocking hither. But she at last forced her way to the spot and, while the driver was helping her to mount the animal she had chosen, she asked what had attracted the throng, and he answered:  \"They are tearing down the house of the old Museum fungus, Didymus.\"  \"How can that be?\" cried the startled woman.  \"The good old man!\"  \"Good?\"  repeated the driver, scornfully.  \"He's a traitor, who has caused all the trouble.  Philostratus, the brother of the great Alexas, a friend of Mark Antony, told us so.  He wanted to prove it, so it must be true.  Hear the shouts, and how the stones are flying!  Yes, yes.  His granddaughter and her lover set an ambush for the King Caesarion.  They would have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5478"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 06 (#2)"],["body"," him, but the watch interfered, and now he lies wounded on his couch.  If mighty Isis does not lend her aid, the young prince's life will soon be over.\"  Then, turning to the donkey, he dealt him two severe blows on the right and left haunches, shouting: \"Hi, Grey!  It does one good to hear that royal backs have room for the cudgel too.\"  Meanwhile, the Nubian was hesitating whether she should not first turn the donkey to the right and seek Didymus; but Barine was threatened by greater peril, and her life was of more value than the welfare of the aged pair.  This decided the question, and she rode forward.  The donkey and his driver did their best, but they came too late; for in the little palace at Kanopus, Anukis learned from the porter that Archibius had gone to the city with his old friend Timagenes, the historian, who lived in Rome, and seemed to have come to Alexandria as an envoy.  Charmian, too, had been here, but also failed to find the master of the house, and followed him.  Evil tidings-which, owing to the loss of time involved, might prove fatal.  If the donkey had only been swifter!  True, Archibius's stable was full of fine animals, but who was she that she should presume to use them?  Yet she had gained something which rendered her the equal of many who were born free and occupied a higher station-- the reputation for trustworthiness and wisdom; and relying upon this, she told the faithful old steward, as far as possible, what was at stake, and soon after he himself took her, both mounted on swift mules, to the city and the Paneum garden.  He chose the nearest road thither through the Gate of the Sun and the Kanopic Way.  Usually at this hour it was crowded with people, but to-day few persons were astir.  All the idlers had thronged to the Bruchium and the harbour to see the returning ships of the vanquished fleet, hear something new, witness the demonstrations of joy, the sacrifices and processions, and--if Fortune favoured--meet the Queen and relieve their overflowing hearts by acclamations.  When the carriage turned towards the left and approached the Paneum, progress for the first time became difficult.  A dense crowd had gathered around the hill on whose summit the sanctuary of Pan dominated the spacious garden.  Anukis's eye perceived the tall figure of Philostratus. Was the mischief-maker everywhere?  This time he seemed to encounter opposition, for loud shouts interrupted his words.  Just as the carriage passed he pointed to the row of houses in which the widow of Leonax lived, but violent resistance followed the gesture.  Anukis perceived what restrained the crowd; for, as the equipage approached its destination, a body of armed youths stopped it.  Their finely-formed limbs, steeled by the training of the Palaestra, and the raven, chestnut, and golden locks floating around their well-shaped heads, were indeed beautiful.  They were a band of the Ephebi, formerly commanded by Archibius, and to whose leadership more recently Dion had been elected.  The youths had heard what had occurred--that imprisonment, perhaps even worse disaster, threatened him.  At any other time it would scarcely have been possible to oppose the decree of the Government and guard their imperilled friend, but in these dark days the rulers must deal with them.  Though they were loyal to the Queen, and had resolved, spite of her defeat, to support her cause, as soon as she needed them, they would not suffer Dion to be punished for a crime which, in their eyes, was an honour.  Their determination to protect him grew more eager with every vexatious delay on the part of the city council to deal with a matter which concerned one of their own body.  They had not yet decided whether to demand a full pardon or only a mild sentence for the man who had wounded the \"King of kings,\" the son of the sovereign.  Moreover, the quiet Caesarion, still subject to his tutor, had not understood how to win the favour of the Ephebi.  The weakling never appeared in the Palaestra, which even the great Mark Antony did not disdain to visit. The latter had more than once given the youths assembled there proofs of his giant strength, and his son Antyllus also frequently shared their exercises.  Dion had merely dealt Caesarion with his clenched fist one of the blows which every one must encounter in the arena.  Philotas of Amphissa, the pupil of Didymus, had been the first to inform them of the attack and, with fiery zeal, had used his utmost power to atone for the wrong done to his master's granddaughter.  His appeal had roused the most eager sympathy.  The Ephebi believed themselves strong enough to defend their friend against any one and, if the worst should come, they knew they would be sustained by the council, the Exegetus, the captain of the guard--a brave Macedonian, who had once been an ornament of their own band--and the numerous clients of Dion and his family. There was not a single weakling among them.  They had already found an opportunity to prove this; for, though they had arrived too late to protect Didymus's property from injury, they had checked the fury of the mob whose passions Philostratus had aroused, and forced back the crowd whom the Syrian led to Barine's dwelling to devote it to the same fate.  Another equipage was already standing before the door of Berenike's house--one of the carriages which were always at the disposal of the Queen's officials--when Anukis left Archibius's vehicle.  Had some of Alexas's myrmidons arrived, or was he himself on the way to examine Dion, or even arrest him?  The driver, like all the palace servants, knew Anukis, and she learned from him that he had brought Gorgias, the architect.  Anukis had never met the latter, though, during the rebuilding of Caesarion's apartments, she had often seen him, and heard much of him; among other things, that Dion's beautiful palace was his work.  He was a friend of the wounded man, so she need not fear him.  When she entered the atrium she heard that Berenike had gone out to drive with Archibius and his Roman friend.  The leech had forbidden his patient to see many visitors.  No one had been admitted except Gorgias and one of Dion's freedmen.  But time pressed; people of the same rank and disposition understand one another; the old porter and the Nubian were both loyal to their employers, and, moreover, were natives of the same country; so it required only a few words to persuade the door-keeper to conduct her without delay to the bedside of the wounded man.  The freedman, a tall, weather-beaten greybeard, simply clad, who looked like a pilot, was waiting outside the sick-room.  He had not yet been admitted to Dion's presence, but this did not appear to vex him, for he stood leaning quietly against the wall beside the door, gazing at the broad-brimmed sailor's hat which he was slowly turning in his hands.  Scarcely had Dion heard Anukis's name, when an eager \"Let her come in\" reached her ears through the half-open door.  The Nubian waited to be summoned, but her dark face must have showed distinctly that something important and urgent had brought her here, for the wounded man added to his first words of greeting the expression of a fear that she had no good news.  Her reply was an eager nod of assent, accompanied by a doubtful glance at Gorgias; and Dion now curtly told the architect the name of the newcomer, and assured her that his friend might hear everything, even the greatest secret.  Anukis uttered a sigh of relief and then, in a tone of the most earnest warning, poured forth the story of the impending danger.  She would not be satisfied when he spoke of the Ephebi, who were ready to defend him, and the council, which would make the cause of one of its members its own, but entreated him to seek some safe place of refuge, no matter where; for powers against whom no resistance would avail were stretching their hands towards him.  Even this statement, however, proved useless, for Dion was convinced that the influence of his uncle, the Keeper of the Seal, would guard him from any serious danger.  Then Anukis resolved to confess what she had overheard; but she told the story without mentioning Barine, and the peril threatening her also.  Finally, with all the warmth of a really anxious heart, she entreated him to heed her warning.  Even while she was still speaking, the friends exchanged significant glances; but scarcely had the last words fallen from her lips when the giant figure of the freedman passed through the door, which had remained open.  \"You here, Pyrrhus?\" cried the wounded man kindly.  \"Yes, master, it is I,\" replied the stalwart fellow, twirling his sailor hat still faster.  \"Listening isn't exactly my trade, and I don't usually enter your  presence uninvited;  but I couldn't help hearing what came through the door, and the croaking of the old raven drew me in.\"  \"I wish you had heard more cheerful things,\" replied Dion; \"but the brown-skinned bird of ill omen usually sings pleasant songs, and they all come from a faithful heart.  But when my silent Pyrrhus opens his mouth so far, something important must surely follow, and you can speak freely in her presence.\"  The sailor cleared his throat, gripped his coarse felt hat in his sinewy hands, and said, in such a tremulous, embarrassed tone that his heavy chin quivered and his voice sometimes faltered: \"If the woman is to be trusted, you must leave here, master, and seek some safe hiding-place. I came to offer one.  On my way I heard your name.  It was said that you had wounded the Queen's son, and it might cost you your life.  Then I thought: 'No, no, not that, so long as Pyrrhus lives, who taught his young master Dion to use the oars and to set his first sail--Pyrrhus and his family.'  Why repeat what we both know well enough?  From my first boat and the land on our island to the liberty you bestowed upon us, we owe everything to your father and to you, and a blessing has rested upon your"]]]
