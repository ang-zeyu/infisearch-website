[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49401"],["title","Eventful Narratives (#1)"],["body"," to forgive my sins and to produce that happy feeling within my bosom which others realized before receiving baptism. I spent about fifteen minutes, at least, in prayer but experienced no happy feeling whatever.  Next evening I again engaged in secret prayer, but realized no benefit. I tried this for a week, with no marked effect. At the end of the week I again went to the minister: told him I had prayed every night, but found no relief; and asked him if he could not pray for me. He replied:  \"If all the ministers in the world were to pray for you they could not save you.\"  After further conversation he requested me to continue my prayers, believing the Lord would answer. I did as he told me several nights more, but without success.  As soon as William H. Scott was identified with the Latter-day Saints he became a zealous and energetic member, and was desirous that all those whom he was acquainted with should embrace the gospel. Working together in the same establishment--in the same room--we had a good opportunity to converse upon any topic that presented itself. I told William concerning my interviews with the Baptist minister, and that I had been praying nightly to the Lord to obtain forgiveness of my sins, but, seemingly, without effect.  William listened attentively and eagerly to my story. He had wished, hoped and even prayed that I should be convinced of the latter day gospel. But I told him I could not see clearly into the principles taught by the Latter-day Saints.  One evening shortly after this (the early part of August, I think) feeling as if my continued prayers for a newness of heart were in vain, I made up my mind to try once more, and if I experienced no difference, would give up the idea of becoming identified with the Baptists and would try the \"Mormons.\"  That same morning while at work, William conversed with me again on the principles advocated by the Latter-day Saints, and smilingly said:  \"You'll have to join the `Mormons.'\"  While conversing with him I experienced a heavenly feeling; a mist came over me, I felt within me an influence I had never before realized. The principles and doctrines of the latter-day gospel came clearly before me. The Spirit of the Lord was with me, and I received a testimony of the truth of \"Mormonism\"--a testimony which I shall never forget. I was supremely happy, rejoicing with \"joy unspeakable.\" I told William I was ready for baptism and asked him to introduce me to the Saints the next Sunday.    CHAPTER II.  THE FIRST LATTER-DAY SAINT MEETING--WILLIAM H. SCOTT HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH MY MOTHER--SHE FORBIDS ME HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE \"MORMONS.\"  It was on the Sunday following when I attended the first Latter-day Saint meeting, having received permission to do so from my parents. That morning I went as usual to the Baptist Sunday school, but did not enjoy myself as much as heretofore. This I attributed to my lack of faith in their doctrines. Knowing \"Mormonism\" to be true, I could gain no satisfaction from any other source.  The place where the Latter-day Saint meeting was to be held was at a small village called Eston, about four miles from Middlesbrough. Our company left town for that place about 1 o'clock p.m., and consisted of William Littlefair, president of the Middlesbrough and Stockton branch, Thomas Watson, secretary of the branch, William H. Scott and myself. It was one of the happiest afternoons I ever spent. We were soon out of town, tripping along through lovely green fields bedecked with flowers of various kinds. Being very much interested in the conversation of President Littlefair and the other brethren--of course it was mostly pertaining to the gospel--the time passed away quickly and we soon arrived at Eston, where the meeting was to be held at the house of a sister named Fewster.  The meeting was opened with an appropriate hymn, then prayer by one of the brethren. The sacrament was administered, and the hymn commencing,       \"O, God, the Eternal Father,       Who dwells amid the sky,\"  was sung.  The time was mostly occupied by President Littlefair. As this was the first meeting attended by me and the first time I had heard the gospel preached I listened attentively to the words of the speakers.  After meeting we partook of tea with Sister Fewster, during which we enjoyed a pleasant, sociable chat. Then we returned homeward, arriving in Middlesbrough about 6 o'clock in the evening.  While penning this brief narrative I cannot help reflecting upon the present time. Passing along to my Sunday meetings I often see a number of boys, about my age at that time, and some older ones, loitering about the streets, breaking the Sabbath, neglecting to attend worship, and many who never even visit Sunday school. They have not the love for their religion, which filled my heart at their age. These remarks apply not only to the young, but also to others more advanced in years, who often neglect their meetings, excusing themselves on one frivolous pretext or another.  William H. Scott told President Littlefair that I desired baptism. The president said as I was under age that rite could not be administered to me. It was necessary for me to first obtain permission from my parents. Thinking the best way to get their consent would be for William to talk to my mother on the subject of \"Mormonism,\" I arranged an interview with her. Accordingly, William went and conversed with her on the first principles of the gospel. It was on a Thursday night. She was interested and listened attentively to the teachings of the young preacher, for he was but a young man, seventeen years of age. At the close of the interview it was agreed upon that in a week's time he should pay her another visit. The appointment was promptly kept, and at its close William gained my mother's consent to my baptism. The next night, Friday, my father, on being consulted, said he was willing for me to do as I pleased.  As everything seemed to be working in my favor, I sought my mother's consent, before retiring to rest on Saturday night, to attend another meeting of the Saints, which was to be held in the afternoon of the next day. Judge of my surprise on being told by her that she did not wish me to have anything more to do with so deluded a people, giving them a bad name and saying:  \"I would rather bury you in the churchyard than have you join the Mormons.\"  Too full of grief to make any reply to her remarks, with drooping head and aching heart I slowly went up stairs to my bed chamber and there knelt and prayed humbly and fervently to my Heavenly Father, while the tears rolled down my cheeks.  Restlessly I lay upon my bed. \"I would rather bury you in the churchyard than have you join the Mormons.\" Oh, how these words rang in my ears! I had never been so tried before in my life. The knowledge that \"Mormonism\" was true was firm in my heart, for I had received a testimony and was very anxious to get baptized; but my hopes now were blighted. What course should I pursue? I was young--just approaching my fifteenth birthday--and still under the control of my parents, whom I desired to obey in all things. But could I give up \"Mormonism\" and deny the testimony I had received? No, the Lord helping me, I would never do that.  Then, again, my temporal position weighed upon my heart. I had recently been apprenticed in the printing business for seven years; and the laws of the country compelled me to serve out this time.  And thus query after query arose in my mind for some length of time, until at last, tired out, sleep closed my eyelids.  Instead of going to Sunday school on the following morning I went to see W. H. Scott and related to him what had transpired. He sympathized with me in my troubled state, advice to me was:  It afterwards came to my knowledge that my mother had been making inquiries of her minister and members of the Wesleyan Reformers in regard to what kind of people the \"Mormons\" were and what was their belief; and the false statements she received in reply accounted for the unkind answer she gave me.  I went to the Latter day Saints' meeting whenever opportunity offered, but was very cautious not to inform my parents.  Sometimes I attended meetings at Eston and Stockton (both places being about four miles from home) as well as at Middlesbrough.  I soon left my former Sunday school and began attending another of the same persuasion, but differing on some points of doctrine. Then I attended the Unitarian school, where their exercises partook of a secular as well as of a religious nature. From there I went to the Wesleyans; but wherever I roamed no true spiritual enjoyment could be found as at the meetings of the Latter-day Saints.    CHAPTER III.  A COMPANION--HOW I SAVED MY EMIGRATION MONEY--AN IMPORTANT LETTER FROM AMERICA.  My acquaintance with the Sedgwick family, which had been interrupted as related in a previous chapter, was again renewed in the Summer of 1863. From that time the friendship existing between Richard, and myself was of the most intimate character. It was not long before the subject of \"Mormonism\" was broached to Richard, and he was soon convinced of the truth of the latter-day gospel. Being also under age he was placed in the same condition as myself--neither of us could avail ourselves of the ordinance of baptism.  Like the rest of the Saints, after embracing the gospel, the spirit of gathering came strongly upon us, and we felt desirous of emigrating at some future day to the land of Zion. In order to do this, it became necessary for Richard and myself to obtain means for that purpose.  About the latter part of 1862, my employer, Mr. Joseph Gould, purchased a weekly newspaper, called the _Middlesbrough News_. It was printed on Thursday nights, and necessitated my working most of that night every week. The money obtained by overwork enabled me to make deposits in the Perpetual Emigration Fund, the first instalment being eleven shillings. This was on December"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49401"],["title","Eventful Narratives (#2)"],["body",", 1863.  The recollection of the first night's work is still fresh in my memory: It was till half-past 5 o'clock in the morning, for which I received one shilling. Just think of it, boys! For ten hours' work I received twenty-four cents--all in cash! Would you not think \"hard times\" had come again if you had to labor so long for such a small amount, especially if you were endeavoring to save means to emigrate? From this time my employer agreed to pay me three halfpence an hour--three cents. Shortly after it was raised to twopence (four cents); then to threepence (six cents). The latter was the highest amount received by me for overwork.  Besides the money earned by overwork, I had a little pocket money given me out of my weekly wages. My mother was not aware that I devoted these means for emigration purposes, but had an idea I had some money saved up. It was the usual custom to go to town on Saturday evenings, and she believed a portion of my gains was spent there. In this she judged wrongly.  My companion, Richard, was working for Mr. Carter, the picture-frame maker. He, like myself, was saving money for the same purpose. He put away most of what he received from his parents as pocket money, and sometimes earned a little by overwork.  From the time my mother forbade my associating with the \"Mormons\" till the Spring of 1866 (three years) was an unpleasant period of my life. It is true the meetings of the Saints were times of refreshing to me, for I loved my religion; but the fear that my parents would discover my attachment to the Latter-day Saints was ever a source of dread. My home was no longer a home to me. Disobedience to my mother's wishes was ever a sore affliction.  Whenever there was an opportunity for my companion and myself to attend a Latter-day Saint meeting, we did so; but when we had not that privilege, if the weather was fine, we visited the cemetery, the docks, or other places of interest in Middlesbrough and vicinity. These were days which will not easily be forgotten.  In the early part of February, 1866, my mother received a letter from America, which stated that some of her relatives were desirous our family should come to reside with them, and intimated they would send our passage money to cross the ocean.  This was good news to my mother, as she was very anxious, and had been for some time, to go to that land. She was the only one of her father's family remaining in England, the rest having previously emigrated.  There was one thing which prevented our family from emigrating: I had three more years of my apprenticeship to serve. In an interview between Mr. Gould and my mother respecting canceling my indentures, he declined doing so. Under these circumstances it was thought best for the family to remain for a season.  Poor woman! She little contemplated that for the last three years and a half I had been carefully saving means to emigrate to Utah, and intended to leave the coming Spring!    CHAPTER IV.  RICHARD AND MYSELF DETERMINE TO EMIGRATE WITH THE SAINTS--RECEIVE BAPTISM--THE NOTIFICATION PAPERS--FIRST ATTEMPT TO LEAVE HOME.  In the Spring of 1866, Richard Sedgwick and myself fully resolved to leave our homes and emigrate to Utah. I had managed to get means enough to take me to the frontier, where the mule and ox teams started to cross the plains to Salt Lake. Richard had only sufficient to take him to New York, where he expected to stay awhile and then proceed to Utah. The time for our departure was drawing near, and we very anxiously looked forward to it with great interest.  As it was my intention to soon leave for Utah, it was deemed advisable by President Littlefair that I should get baptized. Accordingly, on the morning of March 24, 1866, in the River Tees, that ordinance was attended to by Elder John Scott; and I was confirmed by President Littlefair in the afternoon.  My parents knew nothing about it. Nearly every Sunday morning I was in the habit of going early for milk to a small village called Newport. That morning I proceeded as usual, taking with me a small tin bucket. I went to the residence of the Scott family and called for William and others of the family. Richard also accompanied us. On starting out, it commenced to rain, but by the time we arrived at the river side it cleared up. About half a dozen were present. After singing a hymn, prayer was offered and baptism was performed. Another hymn was sung and we started homeward, chatting pleasantly together.  Richard was baptized a few days later. Arrangements were made that William, Richard and myself should sail on the third ship that season, the _American Congress_, and accordingly we sent our deposit money to secure a berth on that vessel. Every day we were expecting our notification papers, which would inform us what day the ship would start. They came on the 13th of May of that year.  We held meeting that day at Sister Jane Scott's, at whose house the meetings were held from the time the Scott family arrived in Middlesbrough, in 1863. Just prior to the arrival of Thomas Watson, clerk of the branch, I was remarking on the heat of the room. On his entry, William H. Scott asked him:  \"Have you brought the _Millennial Stars?_\"  \"Yes,\" said Brother Watson, \"and the notification papers, too.\"  As soon as he uttered these words a nervous feeling crept over me; I felt cold and went to the fire place to warm me.  We held our usual testimony meeting, and among those who bore testimony to the truth of the latter-day work I was one, and while doing so the tears trickled down my cheeks.  The notification papers stated that the _American Congress_ would sail from London on the 23rd of May, which gave us ten days' notice.  A day or two after this William H. Scott received a letter, stating that a small company of Saints would leave Sunderland by steamer on the next Saturday morning, May 19th, for London, from which place the _American Congress_ had to leave on the 23rd of that month. We thought this would be a good opportunity to go on this route, as it was much cheaper by this means than by rail. To do this we would have to leave Middlesbrough on the evening of May 18th, five days before the ship would sail.  We were in a rather peculiar situation, and wondered what excuse we could give our parents and employers to be absent a few days without them suspecting our intentions.  To make matters worse, our right-hand man, William H. Scott, received a letter from President Brigham Young, Jr., at Liverpool, assigning him a mission. This was unpleasant news to both Richard and myself, for to start on our journey without him was almost like being left without a shepherd.  As it could not be avoided, however, we determined to make the best of it and leave on Friday evening, the 18th.  On Wednesday evening, the 16th, I broached the subject of being away two days. I told my parents I wished to go with Richard Sedgwick to Hartlepool the following Friday, on a visit to some of his friends, and return on the following Sunday evening. My father was a little opposed to my going, but my mother was favorably inclined. Hartlepool was about twelve miles from Middlesbrough, and Sunderland was over forty.  Having secured the consent of my parents to be away from home two days, the next thing was to see my employer. It so happened that we were very busy at the printing business, and to ask for a holiday would be almost absurd. We were bent on leaving on the Friday night, and go we must. But what bothered me most was what excuse I could give my employer to be away. To tell him the same story as I had told my parents would hardly do, as he might say I could go there some other time when we were not quite so busy. Finally, on Thursday, the 17th, I saw Mr. Gould and told him I wished to go and see some of my relatives at Bradford, who were going to remove from that place and desired to see me before they left. I asked leave of absence from 4 o'clock Friday evening till Monday morning. Mr. Gould granted my request.  It was much easier for Richard to get permission to be away a few days than it was for me. He told his parents and his employer that he wanted to go to Hartlepool, and his wish was granted without any particular questions being asked.  After Mr. Gould granted my request, he paid me my full week's wages and gave me a shilling for pocket money. He was in the habit of giving me sixpence a week as pocket money, but this time he was kind enough to give me double the amount. I thanked him for his kindness. Mr. Gould had been kind to me ever since I entered his employ, and now that I was about to leave him, expecting never more to see him again, reflections of an unpleasant nature crossed my mind.  On reaching home I quickly put on my Sunday clothes and was soon ready to start, but became so confused as to forget to bid the folks good-by. Just as I was near the door, my mother said:  \"What! are you going off without bidding us good-by?\"  I turned quickly around and said:  \"Good-by! Good-by!\"  They watched me as I left the door. I hurried on my journey and was soon out of sight.    CHAPTER V.  ARRIVAL AT SUNDERLAND--ON THE STEAMER \"GENERAL HAVELOCK\"--IN LONDON--ON BOARD THE \"AMERICAN CONGRESS\"--UNPLEASANT NEWS--A MEETING OF THE SAINTS--AN AWFUL SURPRISE--\"I WANT YOU!\"--TAKEN PRISONERS.  I went down to a steamboat landing, crossed the River Tees in a small steamer and waited there nearly half an hour, when Richard came. He brought with him our box, which contained a bed-quilt, some books and other articles.  On this side of the river was the Port Clarence railway station, where, after securing our tickets, we took the train for Sunderland.  We arrived at the latter place about 7:30 p.m. After some little trouble we found President George J. Linford, who was staying at a Brother Inglefield's. We procured lodgings for the night, for which we paid fourpence (eight cents) each.  Early next morning we went on board the steamer _General Havelock_. Quite a "]]]
