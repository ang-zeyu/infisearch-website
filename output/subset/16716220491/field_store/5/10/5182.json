No, that's my car.\"  Barlow surveyed it with awe. Swept-back lines, deep-drawn compound curves, kilograms of chrome. He ran his hands futilely over the door--or was it the door?--in a futile search for a handle, and asked respectfully, \"How fast does it go?\"  The psychist gave him a keen look and said slowly, \"Two hundred and fifty. You can tell by the speedometer.\"  \"Wow! My old Chevvy could hit a hundred on a straightaway, but you're out of my class, mister!\"  Tinny-Peete somehow got a huge, low door open and Barlow descended three steps into immense cushions, floundering over to the right. He was too fascinated to pay serious attention to his flayed dermis. The dashboard was a lovely wilderness of dials, plugs, indicators, lights, scales and switches.  The psychist climbed down into the driver's seat and did something with his feet. The motor started like lighting a blowtorch as big as a silo. Wallowing around in the cushions, Barlow saw through a rear-view mirror a tremendous exhaust filled with brilliant white sparkles.  \"Do you like it?\" yelled the psychist.  \"It's terrific!\" Barlow yelled back. \"It's--\"  He was shut up as the car pulled out from the bay into the road with a great _voo-ooo-ooom_! A gale roared past Barlow's head, though the windows seemed to be closed; the impression of speed was terrific. He located the speedometer on the dashboard and saw it climb past 90, 100, 150, 200.  \"Fast enough for me,\" yelled the psychist, noting that Barlow's face fell in response. \"Radio?\"  He passed over a surprisingly light object like a football helmet, with no trailing wires, and pointed to a row of buttons. Barlow put on the helmet, glad to have the roar of air stilled, and pushed a pushbutton. It lit up satisfyingly and Barlow settled back even farther for a sample of the brave new world's super-modern taste in ingenious entertainment.  \"TAKE IT AND STICK IT!\" a voice roared in his ears.         *       *       *       *       *  He snatched off the helmet and gave the psychist an injured look. Tinny-Peete grinned and turned a dial associated with the pushbutton layout. The man from the past donned the helmet again and found the voice had lowered to normal.  \"The show of shows! The super-show! The super-duper show! The quiz of quizzes! _Take it and stick it!_\"  There were shrieks of laughter in the background.  \"Here we got the contes-tants all ready to go. You know how we work it. I hand a contes-tant a triangle-shaped cut-out and like that down the line. Now we got these here boards, they got cut-out places the same shape as the triangles and things, only they're all different shapes, and the first contes-tant that sticks the cutouts into the board, he wins.  \"Now I'm gonna innaview the first contes-tant. Right here, honey. What's your name?\"  \"Name? Uh--\"  \"Hoddaya like that, folks? She don't remember her name! Hah? _Would you buy that for a quarter?_\" The question was spoken with arch significance, and the audience shrieked, howled and whistled its appreciation.  It was dull listening when you didn't know the punch lines and catch lines. Barlow pushed another button, with his free hand ready at the volume control.  \"--latest from Washington. It's about Senator Hull-Mendoza. He is still attacking the Bureau of Fisheries. The North California Syndicalist says he got affidavits that John Kingsley-Schultz is a bluenose from way back. He didn't publistat the affydavits, but he says they say that Kingsley-Schultz was saw at bluenose meetings in Oregon State College and later at Florida University. Kingsley-Schultz says he gotta confess he did major in fly-casting at Oregon and got his Ph.D. in game-fish at Florida.  \"And here is a quote from Kingsley-Schultz: 'Hull-Mendoza don't know what he's talking about. He should drop dead.' Unquote. Hull-Mendoza says he won't publistat the affydavits to pertect his sources. He says they was sworn by three former employes of the Bureau which was fired for in-com-petence and in-com-pat-ibility by Kingsley-Schultz.  \"Elsewhere they was the usual run of traffic accidents. A three-way pileup of cars on Route 66 going outta Chicago took twelve lives. The Chicago-Los Angeles morning rocket crashed and exploded in the Mo-have--Mo-javvy--what-ever-you-call-it Desert. All the 94 people aboard got killed. A Civil Aeronautics Authority investigator on the scene says that the pilot was buzzing herds of sheep and didn't pull out in time.  \"Hey! Here's a hot one from New York! A Diesel tug run wild in the harbor while the crew was below and shoved in the port bow of the luck-shury liner _S. S. Placentia_. It says the ship filled and sank taking the lives of an es-ti-mated 180 passengers and 50 crew members. Six divers was sent down to study the wreckage, but they died, too, when their suits turned out to be fulla little holes.  \"And here is a bulletin I just got from Denver. It seems--\"         *       *       *       *       *  Barlow took off the headset uncomprehendingly. \"He seemed so callous,\" he yelled at the driver. \"I was listening to a newscast--\"  Tinny-Peete shook his head and pointed at his ears. The roar of air was deafening. Barlow frowned baffledly and stared out of the window.  A glowing sign said:           MOOGS!     WOULD YOU BUY IT      FOR A QUARTER?  He didn't know what Moogs was or were; the illustration showed an incredibly proportioned girl, 99.9 per cent naked, writhing passionately in animated full color.  The roadside jingle was still with him, but with a new feature. Radar or something spotted the car and alerted the lines of the jingle. Each in turn sped along a roadside track, even with the car, so it could be read before the next line was alerted.      IF THERE'S A GIRL      YOU WANT TO GET       DEFLOCCULIZE     UNROMANTIC SWEAT.     \"A*R*M*P*I*T*T*O\"  Another animated job, in two panels, the familiar \"Before and After.\" The first said, \"Just Any Cigar?\" and was illustrated with a two-person domestic tragedy of a wife holding her nose while her coarse and red-faced husband puffed a slimy-looking rope. The second panel glowed, \"Or a VUELTA ABAJO?\" and was illustrated with--  Barlow blushed and looked at his feet until they had passed the sign.  \"Coming into Chicago!\" bawled Tinny-Peete.  Other cars were showing up, all of them dreamboats.  Watching them, Barlow began to wonder if he knew what a kilometer was, exactly. They seemed to be traveling so slowly, if you ignored the roaring air past your ears and didn't let the speedy lines of the dreamboats fool you. He would have sworn they were really crawling along at twenty-five, with occasional spurts up to thirty. How much was a kilometer, anyway?  The city loomed ahead, and it was just what it ought to be: towering skyscrapers, overhead ramps, landing platforms for helicopters--  He clutched at the cushions. Those two 'copters. They were going to--they were going to--they--  He didn't see what happened because their apparent collision courses took them behind a giant building.         *       *       *       *       *  Screamingly sweet blasts of sound surrounded them as they stopped for a red light. \"What the hell is going on here?\" said Barlow in a shrill, frightened voice, because the braking time was just about zero, he wasn't hurled against the dashboard. \"Who's kidding who?\"  \"Why, what's the matter?\" demanded the driver.  The light changed to green and he started the pickup. Barlow stiffened as he realized that the rush of air past his ears began just a brief, unreal split-second before the car was actually moving. He grabbed for the door handle on his side.  The city grew on them slowly: scattered buildings, denser buildings, taller buildings, and a red light ahead. The car rolled to a stop in zero braking time, the rush of air cut off an instant after it stopped, and Barlow was out of the car and running frenziedly down a sidewalk one instant after that.  _They'll track me down_, he thought, panting. _It's a secret police thing. They'll get you--mind-reading machines, television eyes everywhere, afraid you'll tell their slaves about freedom and stuff. They don't let anybody cross them, like that story I once read._  Winded, he slowed to a walk and congratulated himself that he had guts enough not to turn around. That was what they always watched for. Walking, he was just another business-suited back among hundreds. He would be safe, he would be safe--  A hand tumbled from a large, coarse, handsome face thrust close to his: \"Wassamatta bumpinninna people likeya owna sidewalk gotta miner slamya inna mushya bassar!\" It was neither the mad potter nor the mad driver.  \"Excuse me,\" said Barlow. \"What did you say?\"  \"Oh, yeah?\" yelled the stranger dangerously, and waited for an answer.  Barlow, with the feeling that he had somehow been suckered into the short end of an intricate land-title deal, heard himself reply belligerently, \"Yeah!\"  The stranger let go of his shoulder and snarled, \"Oh, yeah?\"  \"Yeah!\" said Barlow, yanking his jacket back into shape.  \"Aaah!\" snarled the stranger, with more contempt and disgust than ferocity. He added an obscenity current in Barlow's time, a standard but physiologically impossible directive, and strutted off hulking his shoulders and balling his fists.         *       *       *       *       *  Barlow walked on, trembling. Evidently he had handled it well enough. He stopped at a red light while the long, low dreamboats roared before him and pedestrians in the sidewalk flow with him threaded their ways through the stream of cars. Brakes screamed, fenders clanged and dented, hoarse cries flew back and forth between drivers and walkers. He leaped backward frantically as one car swerved over an arc of sidewalk to miss another.  The signal changed to green, the cars kept on coming for about thirty seconds and then dwindled to an"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51240"],["title","The Addicts (#1)"],["body","is a boring task. In fact, it has been known to drive people insane. That's why it's generally assigned to happily married couples like us, who are accustomed to living quietly, without excitement.\"  \"And that,\" she added bitterly, \"is why even happily married couples are usually relieved after one year.\"  \"But, darling,\" he said, his tone cheerful, \"you mustn't blame anyone. Who would have expected that a maverick meteor would come at us and displace us from our orbit? And who would have expected that the meteor would have collided first with the outer asteroids, and picked up a cargo of--those?\"  He gestured toward the window, where a shadow had momentarily paused. By the light that shone through, he could see that the creature was relatively harmless-looking. It had what appeared to be a round, humorous face whose unhumorous intentions would be revealed only at the moment of the kill. The seeming face was actually featureless, for it was not a face at all. It had neither eyes, nor nose, nor mouth. The effect of features was given by the odd blend of colors. Almost escaping notice because of their unusual position and their dull brown hue were the stomach fangs, in neat rows which could be extended and retracted like those of a snake.  He noticed that Louise had shuddered again, and said, in the manner of a man making conversation, \"Interesting, aren't they? They're rock breathers, you know. They need very little oxygen, and they extract that from the silicates and other oxygen-containing compounds of the rock.\"  \"Don't talk about them.\"  \"All right, if you don't want me to. But about us--you see, my dear, no one expected us to be lost. And even if the Lighthouse Service has started to look for us, it'll take a long time to find us.\"  \"We have food, water, air. If not for those beasts, we'd last until a rescue ship appeared.\"  \"But even a rescue ship wouldn't be able to reach us unless we kept the beam going. So far, we've been lucky. It's really functioned remarkably well. But sooner or later it'll go out of order, and then I'll have to go out and fix it. You agree to that, don't you, Louise, dear?\"  She nodded. She said quietly, \"The beam must be kept in order.\"  \"That's when the creatures will get me,\" he said, almost with satisfaction. \"I may kill one or two of them, although the way I feel toward everything, I hate to kill anything at all. But you know, sweetheart, that there are more than a dozen of them altogether, and it's clumsy shooting in a spacesuit at beasts which move as swiftly as they do.\"  \"And if you don't succeed in fixing what's wrong, if they get you--\" She broke down suddenly and began to cry.  He looked at her with compassion, and smoothed her hair. And yet, under the influence of the drug, he enjoyed even her crying. It was, as he never tired of repeating to himself and to her a wonderful drug. Under its spell, a man--or a woman--could really enjoy life.  Tonight she would begin to enjoy life along with him.         *       *       *       *       *  Their chronometer functioned perfectly, and they still regulated their living habits by it, using Greenwich Earth time. At seven in the evening they sat down to a fine meal. Knowing that tomorrow they might die, Louise had decided that tonight they would eat and drink as well as they could, and she had selected a Christmas special. She had merely to pull a lever, and the food had slid into the oven, to be cooked at once by an intense beam of high-frequency radiation. Jim himself had chosen the wine and the brandy--one of the peculiarities of the marak was that it did not affect the actual enjoyment of alcoholic drinks in the slightest, and one of the sights of the Solar System was to see an addict who was also drunk.  But it was a rare sight, for the marak itself created such a pervading sensation of well-being that it often acted as a cure for alcoholism. Once an alcoholic had experienced its effect, he had no need to get drunk to forget his troubles. He enjoyed his troubles instead, and drank the alcohol for its own sake, for its ability to provide a slightly different sensation, and not for its ability to release him from an unhappy world.  So tonight Palmer drank moderately, taking just enough, as it seemed to him, to stimulate his brain. And he did what he now realized he should have done long ago. Unobserved, he placed a tablet of marak in his own wineglass and one in Louise's. The slight bitterness of taste would be hardly perceptible. And after that Louise would be an addict too.  That was the way the marak worked. There was nothing mysterious about the craving. It was simply that once you had experienced how delightful it was, you wouldn't do without it.  The tablet he had taken that morning was losing its effect, but he felt so pleased at what he was doing that he didn't mind even that. For the next half hour he would enjoy himself simply by looking at Louise, and thinking that now at last they would be united again, no longer kept apart by her silly ideas about doing something to save themselves. And then the drug would take effect, and they would feel themselves lifted to the stars together, never to come down to this substitute for Earth again until the beam failed, and they went out together to make the repairs, and the shadows closed in on them.  He had made sure that Louise had her back to him when he dropped the tablet into her glass, and he saw that she suspected nothing. She drank her wine, he noticed, without even commenting on the taste. He felt a sudden impulse to kiss her, and, somewhat to her surprise, he did so. Then he sat down again and went on with the dinner.  He waited.  An hour later he knew that he had made her happy. She was laughing as she hadn't laughed for a long time. She laughed at the humorous things he said, at the flattering way he raised his glass to her, even at what she saw through the window. Sometimes it seemed to him that she was laughing at nothing at all.  He tried to think of how he had reacted the first time he had taken the drug. He hadn't been quite so aggressively cheerful, not quite so--hysterical. But then, the drug didn't have exactly the same effect on everyone. She wasn't as well balanced as he had been. The important thing was that she was happy.  Curiously enough, he himself wasn't happy at all.  It took about five seconds for the thought to become clear to him, five seconds in which he passed from dull amazement to an enraged and horrified comprehension. He sprang to his feet, overturning the table at which they still sat. And he saw that she wasn't surprised at all, that she still stared at him with a secret satisfaction.  \"You've cured me!\" he cried. \"You've fed me the antidote!\"  And he began to curse. He remembered the other time she had tried it, the time when he had been on the alert, and had easily detected the strange metallic taste of the stuff. He had spat it out, and under the influence of the drug from which she had hoped to save him, he had laughed at her.  Now he was unable to laugh. He had been so intent on feeding the tablet to her that he had forgotten to guard himself, and he had been caught. He was normal now--her idea of being normal--and he would never again know the wonderful feeling the drug gave. He began to realize his situation on this horrible lonely asteroid. He cast a glance at the window and at what must be waiting outside, and it was his turn to shudder.  He noticed that she was still smiling.  He said bitterly, \"You're the addict now and I'm cured.\"  She stopped smiling and said quietly, \"Jim, listen to me. You're wrong, completely wrong. I didn't give you the antidote, and you didn't give me the drug.\"  \"I put it in your wineglass myself.\"  She shook her head. \"That was a tablet I substituted for yours. It's an anti-virus dose from our medicine chest. You took one of the same things. That's why you feel so depressed. You're not under the influence of the drug any more.\"  He took a deep breath. \"But I'm not cured?\"  \"No. I knew that I wouldn't be able to slip you the antidote. The taste is too strong. Later you'll be able to start taking the drug again. That is, if you want to, after experiencing for a time what it is to be normal. But not now. You have to keep your head clear. You have to think of something to save us.\"  \"But there's nothing to think of!\" he shouted angrily. \"I told you that the drug doesn't affect the intelligence!\"  \"I still don't believe you. If you'd only exert yourself, use your mind--\"  He said savagely, \"I'm not going to bother. Give me those marak tablets.\"  She backed away from him. \"I thought you might want them. I took no chances. I threw them out.\"  \"Out there?\" A horrified and incredulous look was on his face. \"You mean that I'm stuck here without them? Louise, you fool, there's no help for us! The other way, at least, we'd have died happy. But now--\"  He stared out the window. The shadows were there in full force. Not one now, but two, three--he counted half a dozen. It was almost as if they knew that the end had come.  They had reason to be happy, he thought with despair. And perhaps-- he shrank back from the thought, but it forced itself into his mind--perhaps, now that all happiness had gone, and wretchedness had taken its place, he might as well end everything. There would be no days to spend torturing himself in anticipation of a horrible death.  Louise exclaimed suddenly, \"Jim, _look_! They're _frolicking_!\"  He looked. The beasts certainly were gay. One of them leaped from the airless surface of the asteroid and sailed over its fellow. He had never seen them do that before. Usually they clung to the rocky surface. Another was spinning around oddly, as if it had lost its sense of balance.  Louise said, \"_They've_ swallowed the tablets! Over a hundred doses--enough to drug every beast on the asteroid!\"  For a moment Palmer stared at the gamboling alien drug addicts. Then he put on his spacesuit and"]]]
