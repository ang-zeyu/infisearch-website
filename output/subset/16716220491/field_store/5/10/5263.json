But you didn't. We would be within our rights to leave you stranded. Do you understand that?\"  \"Yes, of course,\" Morrison said wearily.  \"However, the company has decided to stretch a point in your favor. If you turn back immediately, we will keep you supplied with water for the return trip.\"  \"I'm not turning back yet. I'm almost on the real stuff.\"  \"You must turn back! Be reasonable, Morrison! Where would we be if we let every prospector wander over the desert while we supplied his water? There'd be ten thousand men out there, and we'd be out of business inside of a year. I'm stretching the rules now. Turn back.\"  \"No,\" said Morrison.  \"You'd better think about it. If you don't turn back now, Public Utility takes no further responsibility for your water supply.\"  Morrison nodded. If he went on, he would stand a good chance of dying in the desert. But if he turned back, what then? He would be in Venusborg, penniless and in debt, looking for work in an overcrowded city. He'd sleep in a community shed and eat at a soup kitchen with the other prospectors who had turned back. And how would he be able to raise the fare back to Earth? When would he ever see Janie again?  \"I guess I'll keep on going,\" Morrison said.  \"Then Public Utility takes no further responsibility for you,\" Reade repeated, and hung up.  Morrison packed up his telephone, took a sip from his meager water supply, and went on.         *       *       *       *       *  The sandwolves loped along at each side, moving in closer. Overhead, a delta-winged kite found him. It balanced on the up-drafts for a day and a night, waiting for the wolves to finish him. Then a flock of small flying scorpions sighted the waiting kite. They drove the big creature upstairs into the cloud bank. For a day the flying reptiles waited. Then they in turn were driven off by a squadron of black kites.  The traces were very rich now, on the fifteenth day since he had left the sandcar. By rights, he should be walking over goldenstone. He should be surrounded by goldenstone. But still he hadn't found any.  Morrison sat down and shook his last canteen. It gave off no wet sound. He uncapped it and turned it up over his mouth. Two drops trickled down his parched throat.  It was about four days since he had talked to Public Utility. He must have used up the last of his water yesterday. Or had it been the day before?  He recapped the empty canteen and looked around at the heat-blasted landscape. Abruptly he pulled the telephone out of his pack and dialed Max Krandall in Venusborg.  Krandall's round, worried face swam into focus on the screen. \"Tommy,\" he said, \"you look like hell.\"  \"I'm all right,\" Morrison said. \"A little dried out, that's all. Max, I'm near goldenstone.\"  \"Are you sure?\" Krandall asked.  \"See for yourself,\" Morrison said, swinging the telephone around. \"Look at the stone formations! Do you see the red and purple markings over there?\"  \"Traces, all right,\" Krandall admitted dubiously.  \"There's rich stuff just beyond it,\" Morrison said. \"There has to be! Look, Max, I know you're short on money, but I'm going to ask you a favor. Send me a pint of water. Just a pint, so I can go on for another day or two. We can both get rich for the price of a pint of water.\"  \"I can't do it,\" Krandall said sadly.  \"You can't?\"  \"That's right. Tommy, I'd send you water even if there wasn't anything around you but sandstone and granite. Do you think I'd let you die of thirst if I could help it? But I can't do a thing. Take a look.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Krandall rotated his telephone. Morrison saw that the chairs, table, desk, filing cabinet and safe were gone from the office. All that was left in the room was the telephone.  \"I don't know why they haven't taken out the phone,\" Krandall said. \"I owe two months on my bill.\"  \"I do too,\" said Morrison.  \"I'm stripped,\" Krandall said. \"I haven't got a dime. Don't get me wrong, I'm not worried about myself. I can always eat at a soup kitchen. But I can't 'port you any water. Not you or Remstaater.\"  \"Jim Remstaater?\"  \"Yeah. He was following a trace up north past Forgotten River. His sandcar broke an axle last week and he wouldn't turn back. His water ran out yesterday.\"  \"I'd bail him out if I could,\" said Morrison.  \"And he'd bail you out if he could,\" Krandall said. \"But he can't and you can't and I can't. Tommy, you have only one hope.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"Find goldenstone. Not just traces, find the real thing worth real money. Then phone me. If you really have goldenstone, I'll bring in Wilkes from Tri-Planet Mining and get him to advance us some money. He'll probably want fifty per cent of the claim.\"  \"That's plain robbery!\"  \"No, it's just the high cost of credit on Venus,\" Krandall answered. \"Don't worry, there'll still be plenty left over. But you have to find goldenstone first.\"  \"OK,\" Morrison said. \"It should be around here somewhere. Max, what's today's date?\"  \"July thirty-first. Why?\"  \"Just wondering. I'll call you when I've found something.\"  After hanging up, Morrison sat on a little boulder and stared dully at the sand. July thirty-first. Tomorrow was his birthday. His family would be thinking about him. Aunt Bess in Pasadena, the twins in Laos, Uncle Ted in Durango. And Janie, of course, waiting for him in Tampa.  Morrison realized that tomorrow might be his last birthday unless he found goldenstone.  He got to his feet, strapped the telephone back in his pack beside the empty canteens, and set a course to the south.         *       *       *       *       *  He wasn't alone. The birds and beasts of the desert marched with him. Overhead, the silent black kites circled endlessly. The sandwolves crept closer on his flanks, their red tongues lolling out, waiting for the carcass to fall....  \"I'm not dead yet!\" Morrison shouted at them.  He drew his revolver and fired at the nearest wolf. At twenty feet, he missed. He went down on one knee, held the revolver tightly in both hands and fired again. The wolf yelped in pain. The pack immediately went for the wounded animal, and the kites swooped down for their share.  Morrison put the revolver back in its holster and went on. He could tell he was in a badly dehydrated state. The landscape jumped and danced in front of him, and his footing was unsure. He discarded the empty canteens, threw away everything but the testing kit, telephone and revolver. Either he was coming out of the desert in style or he wasn't coming out at all.  The traces continued to run rich. But still he came upon no sign of tangible wealth.  That evening he found a shallow cave set into the base of a cliff. He crawled inside and built a barricade of rocks across the entrance. Then he drew his revolver and leaned back against the far wall.  The sandwolves were outside, sniffing and snapping their jaws. Morrison propped himself up and got ready for an all-night vigil.  He didn't sleep, but he couldn't stay awake, either. Dreams and visions tormented him. He was back on Earth and Janie was saying to him, \"It's the tuna. Something must be wrong with their diet. Every last one of them is sick.\"  \"It's the darnedest thing,\" Morrison told her. \"Just as soon as you domesticate a fish, it turns into a prima donna.\"  \"Are you going to stand there philosophizing,\" Janie asked, \"while your fish are sick?\"  \"Call the vet.\"  \"I did. He's off at the Blake's place, taking care of their dairy whale.\"  \"All right, I'll go out and take a look.\" He slipped on his face mask. Grinning, he said, \"I don't even have time to dry off before I have to go out again.\"  His face and chest were wet.         *       *       *       *       *  Morrison opened his eyes. His face and chest _were_ wet--from perspiration. Staring at the partially blocked mouth of the cave, he could see green eyes, two, four, six, eight.  He fired at them, but they didn't retreat. He fired again, and his bullet richocheted off the cave wall, stinging him with stone splinters. With his next shots, he succeeded in winging one of the wolves. The pack withdrew.  That emptied the revolver. Morrison searched through his pockets and found five more cartridges. He carefully loaded the gun. Dawn couldn't be far away now.  And then he was dreaming again, this time of the Prospector's Special. He had heard about it in every little saloon that bordered the Scorpion. Bristly-bearded old prospectors told a hundred different stories about it, and the cynical bartenders chimed in with their versions. Kirk had it in '89, ordered up big and special just for him. Edmonson and Arsler received it in '93. That was certain. And other men had had it too, as they sat on their precious goldenstone claims. Or so people said.  But was it real? Was there such a thing as the Prospector's Special? Would he live to see that rainbow-hued wonder, tall as a church steeple, wide as a house, more precious than goldenstone itself?  Sure he would! Why, he could almost see it now....  Morrison shook himself awake. It was morning. Painfully, he crawled out of the cave to face the day.  He stumbled and crawled to the south, escorted closely by wolves, shaded by predatory flying things. His fingers scrabbled along rock and sand. The traces were rich, rich!  But where in all this desolation was the goldenstone?  Where? He was almost past caring. He drove his sunburned, dried-out body, stopping only to fire a single shot when the wolves came too close.  Four bullets left.  He had to fire again when the kites, growing impatient, started diving at his head. A lucky shot tore into the flock, downing two. It gave the wolves something to fight over. Morrison crawled on blindly.  And fell over the edge of a little cliff.  It wasn't a serious fall, but the revolver was knocked from his hand. Before he could find it, the wolves were on him. Only their greed saved Morrison. While they fought over him,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51774"],["title","The Weirdest World (#1)"],["body","company of you peeled grubs is better than nothing. I am anxious to adopt a family and settle down here for what years of life I have left. It may be that I will find compatibility with the species you mention. I do not know what they are.\"  \"Hey, fellows, this blob isn't a bad guy at all. I'd shake your hand; blob, if I knew where it was. Let's go to Billy Wilkins' place and sell him.\"   II  We traveled to Billy Wilkins' place. My friends were amazed when I took to the air and believed that I had deserted them. They had no cause to distrust me. Without them I would have had to rely on intuition to reach Billy Wilkins, and even then I would lack the proper introductions.  \"Hey, Billy,\" said my loudest friend, whose name was Cecil, \"what will you give us for a blob? It flies and talks and isn't a bad fellow at all. You'd get more tourists to come to your reptile show if you had a talking blob in it. He could sing songs and tell stories. I bet he could even play the guitar.\"  \"Well, Cecil, I'll just give you all ten dollars for it and try to figure out what it is later. I'm a little ahead on my hunches now, so I can afford to gamble on this one. I can always pickle it and exhibit it as a genuine hippopotamus kidney.\"  \"Thank you, Billy. Take care of yourself, blob.\"  \"Good-by for now, gentlemen,\" I said. \"I would like you to visit me some evening as soon as I am acclimated to my new surroundings. I will throw a whing-ding for you--as soon as I find out what a whing-ding is.\"  \"My God,\" said Billy Wilkins, \"it talks! It really talks!\"  \"We told you it could talk and fly, Billy.\"  \"It talks, it talks,\" said Billy. \"Where's that blasted sign painter? Eustace, come here. We got to paint a new sign!\"  The turtles in the tank I was put into did have a sound basic philosophy which was absent in the walking grubs. But they were slow and lacking inner fire. They would not be obnoxious company, but neither would they give me excitement and warmth. I was really more interested in the walking grubs.  Eustace was a black grub, while the others had all been white; but like them he had no outside casing of his own, and like them he also staggered about on flesh stilts with his head in the air.  It wasn't that I was naive or hadn't seen bipeds before. But I don't believe anyone ever became entirely accustomed to seeing a biped travel in its peculiar manner.  \"Good afternoon, Eustace,\" I said pleasantly enough. The eyes of Eustace were large and white. He was a more handsome specimen than the other grubs.  \"That you talking, bub? Say, you really can talk, can't you? I thought Mr. Billy was fooling. Now just you hold that expression a minute and let me get it set in my mind. I can paint anything, once I get it set in my mind. What's your name, blob? Have blobs names?\"  \"Not in your manner. With us the name and the soul, I believe you call it, are the same thing and cannot be vocalized, so I will have to adopt a name of your sort. What would be a good name?\"  \"Bub, I was always partial to George Albert Leroy Ellery. That was my grandfather's name.\"  \"Should I also have a family name?\"  \"Sure.\"  \"What would you suggest?\"  \"How about McIntosh?\"  \"That will be fine. I will use it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I talked to the turtles while Eustace was painting my portrait on tent canvas.  \"Is the name of this world Florida?\" I asked one of them. \"The road signs said Florida.\"  \"World, world, world, water, water, water, glub, glug, glub,\" said one of them.  \"Yes, but is this particular world we are on named Florida?\"  \"World, world, water, water, glub,\" said another.  \"Eustace, I can get nothing from these fellows,\" I called. \"Is this world named Florida?\"  \"Mr. George Albert, you are right in the middle of Florida, the greatest state in the universe.\"  \"Having traveled, Eustace, I have great reservations that it is the greatest. But it is my new home and I must cultivate a loyalty to it.\"  I went up in a tree to give advice to two young birds trying to construct a nest. This was obviously their first venture.  \"You are going about it all wrong,\" I told them. \"First consider that this will be your home, and then consider how you can make your home most beautiful.\"  \"This is the way they've always built them,\" said one of the birds.  \"There must be an element of utility, yes,\" I told them. \"But the dominant motif should be beauty. The impression of expanded vistas can be given by long low walls and parapets.\"  \"This is the way they've always built them,\" said the other bird.  \"Remember to embody new developments,\" I said. \"Just say to yourself, 'This is the newest nest in the world.' Always say that about any task you attempt. It inspires you.\"  \"This is the way they've always built them,\" said the birds. \"Go build your own nest.\"  \"Mr. George Albert,\" called Eustace, \"Mr. Billy won't like your flying around those trees. You're supposed to stay in your tank.\"  \"I was only getting a little air and talking to the birds,\" I said.  \"You can talk to the birds?\" asked Eustace.  \"Cannot anyone?\"  \"I can, a little,\" said Eustace. \"I didn't know anyone else could.\"  But when Billy Wilkins returned and heard the report that I had been flying about, I was put in the snake house, in a cage that was tightly meshed top and sides. My cellmate was a surly python named Pete.  \"See you stay on that side,\" said Pete. \"You're too big for me to swallow. But I might try.\"  \"There is something bothering you, Pete,\" I said. \"You have a bad disposition. That can come only from a bad digestion or a bad conscience.\"  \"I have both,\" said Pete. \"The first is because I bolt my food. The second is because--well, I forget the reason, but it's my conscience.\"  \"Think hard, Pete. Why have you a bad conscience?\"  \"Snakes always have bad consciences. We have forgotten the crime, but we remember the guilt.\"  \"Perhaps you should seek advice from someone, Pete.\"  \"I kind of think it was someone's smooth advice that started us on all this. He talked the legs right off us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Billy Wilkins came to the cage with another \"man,\" as the walking grubs call themselves.  \"That it?\" asked the other man. \"And you say it can talk?\"  \"Of course I talk,\" I answered for Billy Wilkins. \"I have never known a creature who couldn't talk in some manner. My name is George Albert Leroy Ellery McIntosh. I don't believe that I heard yours, sir.\"  \"Bracken. Blackjack Bracken. I was telling Billy here that if he really had a blob that could talk, I might be able to use it in my night club. We could have you here at the Snake Ranch in the daytime for the tourists and kids. Then I could have you at the club at night. We could work out an act. Do you think you could learn to play the guitar?\"  \"Probably. But it would be much easier for me merely to duplicate the sound.\"  \"But then how could you sing and make guitar noise at the same time?\"  \"You surely don't think I am limited to one voice box?\"  \"Oh. I didn't know. What's that big metal ball you have there?\"  \"That's my communication sphere, to record my thoughts. I would not be without it. When in danger, I swallow it. When in extreme danger, I will have to escape to a spot where I have concealed my ejection mortar, and send my sphere into the galactic drift on a chance that it may be found.\"  \"That's no kind of gag to put in an act. What I have in mind is something like this.\"  Blackjack Bracken told a joke. It was a childish one and in poor taste.  \"I don't believe that is quite my style,\" I said.  \"All right, what would you suggest?\"  \"I thought that I might lecture your patrons on the Higher Ethic.\"  \"Look, George Albert, my patrons don't even have the lower ethic.\"  \"And just what sort of recompense are we talking about?\" I asked.  \"Billy and I had about settled on a hundred and fifty a week.\"  \"A hundred and fifty for whom?\"  \"Why, for Billy.\"  \"Let us make it a hundred and fifty for myself, and ten per cent for Billy as my agent.\"  \"Say, this blob's real smart, isn't he, Billy?\"  \"Too smart.\"  \"Yes, sir, George Albert, you're one smart blob. What kind of contract have you signed with Billy here?\"  \"No contract.\"  \"Just a gentlemen's agreement?\"  \"No agreement.\"  \"Billy, you can't hold him in a cage without a contract. That's slavery. It's against the law.\"  \"But, Blackjack, a blob isn't people.\"  \"Try proving that in court. Will you sign a contract with me, George Albert?\"  \"I will not dump Billy. He befriended me and gave me a home with the turtles and snakes. I will sign a joint contract with the two of you. We will discuss terms tomorrow--after I have estimated the attendance both here and at the night club.\"   III  Of the walking grubs (who call themselves \"people\") there are two kinds, and they place great emphasis on the difference. From this stems a large part of their difficulties. This distinction, which is one of polarity, cuts quite across the years and ability and station of life. It is not confined only to the people grubs, but also involves apparently all the beings on the planet Florida.  It appears that a person is committed to one or the other polarity at the beginning of life, maintaining that polarity until death. The interlocking attraction-repulsion complex set up by these two opposable types has deep emotional involvements. It is the cause of considerable concern and disturbance, as well as desire and inspiration. There is a sort of poetic penumbra about the whole thing that tends to disguise its basic simplicity, expressible as a simultaneous polarity equation.  Complete segregation of the two types seems impossible. If it has ever been tried, it has now evidently been abandoned as impractical.  There is indeed an intangible difference between the two types, so that before that first day at the Reptile Ranch was finished, I was able to differentiate between the two more than ninety per cent of the time. The knowledge of this difference in polarity seems to be"]]]
