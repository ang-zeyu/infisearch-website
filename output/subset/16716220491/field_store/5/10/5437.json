The man was possessed, transformed, a Boanerges; his hammer, a hammer of Thor! He had caught it from the hand of a douce, sober-looking man in a plum-coloured doublet, who stood watching but taking no active share in the work.  \"By your leave, Sir!\"  \"With or without my leave, good Sir, since you are determined to have it,\" said the quiet man, surrendering the hammer.  The countryman snatched and thrust it between his knees while he stripped. Then, having spat on both hands, he grasped the hammer and tried its poise. \"'Tis odd, now,\" said he, as if upon an afterthought, staring down on the quiet man, \"but methinks I know your voice?\"  \"Marry and there's justice in that,\" the quiet man answered; \"for 'tis the ghost of one you drowned erewhile.\"   III  \"Tom! What, Tom! Where be the others? I tell thee, Tom, there have been doings....\"  \"Is that Dick Burbage?\" A frail, thin windle-straw of a man came coughing across the foggy courtyard with a stable-lantern, holding it high. Its rays wavered on his own face, which was young but extraordinarily haggard, and on the piles of timber between and over which he picked his way--timbers heaped pell-mell in the slush of the yard or stacked against the boundary wall, some daubed with paint, others gilded wholly or in part, and twinkling as the lantern swung. \"Dick Burbage already? Has it miscarried, then?\"  \"Miscarried? What in the world was there to miscarry? I tell thee, Tom--but where be the others?\"  The frail man jerked a thumb at the darkness behind his shoulder. \"Hark to them, back yonder, stacking the beams! Where should they be? and what doing but at work like galley-slaves, by the pace you have kept us going? Look around. I tell you from the first 'twas busy-all to get the yard clear between the wagons' coming, and at the fifth load we gave it up. My shirt clings like a dish-clout; a chill on this will be the death o' me. What a plague! How many scoundrels did you hire, that they take a house to pieces and cart it across Thames faster than we can unload it?\"  \"That's the kernel of the story, lad. I hired the two-score rogues agreed on, neither more nor less: but one descended out of heaven and raised the number to twelve-score. Ten-score extra, as I am a sinner; and yet but one man, for I counted him. His name, he told me, was Legion.\"  \"Dick,\" said the other sadly, \"when a sober man gives way to drinking--I don't blame you: and your pocket will be the loser more than all the rest if you've boggled to-night's work; but poor Cuthbert will take it to heart.\"  \"There was a man, I tell you----\"  \"Tut, tut, pull yourself together and run back across bridge. Or let me go: take my arm now, before the others see you. You shall tell me on the way what's wrong at Shoreditch.\"  \"There is naught wrong with Shoreditch, forby that it has lost a theatre: and I am not drunk, Tom Nashe--no, not by one-tenth as drunk as I deserve to be, seeing that the house is down, every stick of it, and the bells scarce yet tolling midnight. 'Twas all this man, I tell you!\"  \"Down? The Theatre down? Oh, go back, Dick Burbage!\"  \"Level with the ground, I tell you--his site a habitation for the satyr. _Cecidit, cecidit Babylon illa magna!_ and the last remains of it, more by token, following close on my heels in six wagons. Hist, then, my Thomas, my Didymus, my doubting one!--Canst not hear the rumble of their wheels? and--and--oh, good Lord!\" Burbage caught his friend by the arm and leaned against him heavily. \"_He's_ there, and following!\"  The wagons came rolling over the cobbles of the Clink along the roadway outside the high boundary-wall of the yard: and as they came, clear above their rumble and the slow clatter of hoofs a voice like a trumpet declaimed into the night--    \"_Above all ryvers thy Ryver hath renowne,     Whose beryall streamys, pleasaunt and preclare,   Under thy lusty wallys renneth downe,     Where many a swan doth swymme with wyngis fair,   Where many a barge doth sail and row with are_----  We had done better--a murrain on their cobbles!--we had done better, lad, to step around by Paul's Wharf and take boat.... This jolting ill agrees with a man of my weight....    _Where many a barge doth sail aund row with are_--  Gr-r-r! Did I not warn thee beware, master wagoner, of the kerbstones at the corners? We had done better by water, what though it be dark.... Lights of Bankside on the water ... no such sight in Europe, they tell me.... My Lord of Surrey took boat one night from Westminster and fired into their windows with a stone-bow, breaking much glass ... drove all the long-shore queans screaming into the streets in their night-rails.... He went to the Fleet for it ... a Privy Council matter.... I forgive the lad, for my part: for only think of it--all those windows aflame on the river, and no such river in Europe!--    _Where many a barge doth sail and row with are;     Where many a ship doth rest with top-royall.   O towne of townes! patrone and not compare,     London, thou art the flow'r of Cities all!_  Who-oop!\"  \"In the name of----\" stammered Nashe, as he listened, Burbage all the while clutching his arm.  \"He dropped from the top gallery, I tell you--clean into the pit from the top gallery--and he weighs eighteen stone if an ounce. 'Your servant, Sir, and of all the Muses,' he says, picking himself up; and with that takes the hammer from my hand and plays Pyrrhus in Troy--Pyrrhus with all the ravening Danai behind him: for those hired scoundrels of mine took fire, and started ripping out the bowels of the poor old theatre as though it had been the Fleet and lodged all their cronies within! It went down before my eyes like a sand-castle before the tide. Within three hours they had wiped the earth of it. The Lord be praised that Philip Gosson had ne'er such an arm, nor could command such! Oh, but he's a portent! Troy's horse and Bankes's bay gelding together are a fool to him: he would harness them as Samson did the little foxes, and fire brushwood under their tails....\"  \"Of a certainty you are drunk, Dick.\"  \"Drunk? I?\" Burbage gripped the other's thin arm hysterically. \"If you want to see a man drunk come to the gate. Nay, then, stay where you are: for there's no escaping him.\"  Nor was there. Between them and the wagoners' lanterns at the gate a huge shadow thrust itself, the owner of it rolling like a ship in a sea-way, while he yet recited--    \"_Strong be thy wallis that about thee standis_,  (meaning the Clink, my son),    _Wise be the people that within thee dwellis_,  (which you may take for the inhabitants thereof),    _Fresh is thy ryver with his lusty strandis,   Blith be thy chirches, wele sowning be thy bellis._\"  \"Well sounding is my belly, master, any way,\" put in a high, thin voice; \"and it calls on a gentleman of Warwickshire to redeem his promise.\"  \"He shall, he shall, lad--in the fullness of time: 'but before dining ring at the bell,' says the proverb. Grope, lad, feel along the gate-posts if this yard, this courtlage, this base-court, hath any such thing as bell or knocker.    _And when they came to mery Carleile     All in the mornyng tyde-a,   They found the gates shut them until     About on every syde-a._    _Then Adam Bell bete on the gates     With strokes great and stronge-a_  Step warely, lad. Plague of this forest! Have we brought timber to Sherwood?      _With strokes great and stronge-a   The porter marveiled who was thereat,     And to the gates he thronge-a._    _They called the porter to counsell,     And wrange his necke in two-a,   And caste him in a depe dungeon,     And took hys keys hym fro-a._  Within! You rascal, there, with the lantern!... Eh? but these be two gentlemen, it appears? I cry your mercy, Sirs.\"  \"For calling us rascals?\" Nashe stepped forward. \"'T hath been done to me before now, in print, upon as good evidence; and to my friend here by Act of Parliament.\"  \"But seeing you with a common stable-lantern----\"  \"Yet Diogenes was a gentleman. Put it that, like him, I am searching for an honest man.\"  \"Then we are well met. I' faith we are very well met,\" responded the countryman, recognising Burbage's grave face and plum-coloured doublet.  \"Or, as one might better say, well overtaken,\" said Burbage.  \"Marry, and with a suit. I have some acquaintance, Sir, with members of your honourable calling, as in detail and at large I could prove to you. Either I have made poor use of it or I guess aright, as I guess with confidence, that after the triumph will come the speech-making, and the supper's already bespoken.\"  \"At Nance Witwold's, by the corner of Paris Garden, Sir, where you shall be welcome.\"  \"I thank you, Sir. But my suit is rather for this young friend of mine, to whom I have pledged my word.\"  \"He shall be welcome, too.\"  \"He tells me, Sir, that you are Richard Burbage. I knew your father well, Sir--an honest Warwickshire man: he condescended to my roof and tasted my poor hospitality many a time; and belike you, too, Sir, being then a child, may have done the same: for I talk of prosperous days long since past--nay, so long since that 'twould be a wonder indeed had you remembered me. The more pleasure it gives me, Sir, to find James Burbage's sappy virtues flourishing in the young wood, and by the branch be reminded of the noble stock.\"  \"The happier am I, Sir, to have given you welcome or ever I heard your claim.\"  \"Faith!\" said the apprentice to himself, \"compliments begin to fly when gentlefolks meet.\" But he had not bargained to sup in this high company, and the prospect thrilled him with delicious terror. He glanced nervously across the yard, where some one was approaching with another lantern.  \"My claim?\" the countryman answered Burbage. \"You have heard but a part of it as yet. Nay, you have heard none of it, since I use not past hospitalities with old friends to claim a return from their children. My claim, Sir, is a livelier one----\"  \"Tom Nashe!

Everything in Him amazes me. His spirit outreaches mine, and His will confounds me.\"  [Sidenote: The universal worship of Jesus.]  It is wonderful that a man like Napoleon, whose natural arms were fire and the sword, should be so deeply impressed by the life and teachings of the lowly Nazarene. But Napoleon is not alone in his admiration and love. Throughout the nineteen centuries that have passed since the Master lived upon the earth, men of every clime have learned to know Him and to worship Him. Today there are but few peoples known to mankind that do not acknowledge Jesus the Christ. The wonderful story of His life has thrilled both the young and the old the world over since first it was told. The wisdom, the justice, and the loving kindness of all His teachings, have inspired the nations to make them better. No other man in all the history of the world has exerted so profound an influence on the lives of his fellowmen, and on the laws that govern them.  {14} [Sidenote: The purpose of this book.]  Now, you have read in other books the story of the life of Jesus. You know when and where He was born; how God the Father protected His Son; how he grew to manhood, waxing strong in spirit; how He taught, and wrought miracles amongst His own people; how they rejected Him and crucified Him; and how He rose from death and returned to His Father in heaven. It is a strangely beautiful story. But we do not want to retell it here. It must be our purpose, in this little book, to tell as interestingly as may be what Jesus taught. Certainly, it must be interesting to know something of the teachings of the Man who has made so profound an impression upon the history of the world. We want to know what the life-work of Jesus means to us and to our fellowmen. And to begin, we must try to find out what Jesus Himself thought about His mission on the earth.  [Sidenote: The new duties of Jesus at the age of twelve.]  When Jesus reached the age of twelve years, He entered--according to Jewish custom--upon a new and important period in His life. You may be used to thinking of Jesus as a very wonderful boy, altogether different from other boys. That is not quite true. Jesus was a perfectly natural and normal boy. He liked to run and jump and play the games that other boys played. He had to go to school as other Jewish boys did--first at His mother's knee, then at the village synagogue. Jesus was unlike other boys in that He began early to understand something of the nature of His mission upon the earth. This made Him like serious things, and often to think about the teachings of {15} God; for it was the aim of all Jewish education to learn about God and His commands, and how to keep them. Now, when Jesus became twelve years of age, there came to Him many new duties. The Jewish law required that He should assume all the religious responsibilities that devolved naturally upon a faithful Jew. Amongst other things, Jesus must hereafter go to the temple three times a year, to fulfill the demands of the law. Accordingly, when Joseph and Mary set out for Jerusalem, to observe the Feast of the Passover, soon after their eldest son's twelfth birthday, they took Him with them.  [Sidenote: Jesus in the temple.]  It is needless here to follow in detail the journey of the pilgrims over the great highway, across the Plain of Jezreel to Bethshean, down the western side of the Jordan Valley to Jericho, and then four thousand feet upward over the barren, robber-infested hills of the wilderness of Judea to Jerusalem. Jesus seems to have been much impressed by the road, for He referred to it later in the parable of the Good Samaritan.  When the celebration of the feast of the Passover was accomplished, Joseph and Mary set out to return to Nazareth. They had complete confidence in Jesus, so they did not look for Him till they reached Bethany. Jesus was not there to be found. Anxious at heart the parents returned to Jerusalem; and there, after three days, they found Him discoursing in the temple with Shammai and the learned teachers of the temple. The boy's zeal for knowledge had caused Him to remain at the temple even after the feast was over. \"And all that {16} heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.\"  When Mary saw her son in the midst of the learned men of Israel, she cried to Him, \"Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.\"  \"And He said unto them. How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?\"  \"And they understood not the saying which He spake unto them.\"  [Sidenote: His Father's Business.]  It was, indeed, a strange saying to understand. Not Joseph and Mary alone, but countless thousands of people have failed to understand it. Do you think you know what the boy Jesus meant? Of course, to understand, one must know what the Father's business is. Then we can understand what Jesus thought about His mission on the earth. \"For,\" Jesus said many years later when He had grown to manhood, \"I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me.\"  What, then, is the will of God? What is His Father's business? Once, many hundreds of years before Jesus was born, God gave to a man named Moses a marvelous revelation. Moses saw how the earth had been formed, and how living things were put upon it. He saw how man was shaped in the image of God and placed upon the earth to have dominion over it. Then God said to Moses, \"Behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\"  {17} This, then, is the Father's business; this is His will. It is exactly what Jesus told Joseph Smith, the great American Prophet, in our own dispensation: \"And if you keep my commandments and endure to the end, you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.\" And it is also exactly what Jesus taught while He dwelt among men. Said He, \"And this is the will of Him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.\"  [Sidenote: What is eternal life?]  But perhaps it is not quite clear yet what the Father's will is. Perhaps you are asking yourself, What is eternal life? Of course, eternal, or everlasting life, is a condition of being--or of living--in"]]]
