Yea, each is here a prince in his own right,       Who dwelt disguised amid the multitude,       And when his time was come, in haughty mood,     Shook off his motley and reclaimed his might;         His sombre throne     In the vast province of perpetual night,         He holds secure, inviolate, alone.      The poor forgets that ever he was poor,       The priest has lost his science of the truth,       The maid her beauty, and the youth his youth,     The statesman has forgot his subtle lure,         The old his age,     The sick his suffering, and the leech his cure,         The poet his perplexed and vacant page.      These swains that tilled the uplands in the sun       Have all forgot the field’s familiar face,       And lie content within this ancient place,     Whereto when hands were tired their thought would run         To dream of rest,     When the last furrow was turned down, and won         The last harsh harvest from the earth’s patient breast.      O dwellers in the valley vast and fair,       I would that calling from your tranquil clime,       You make a truce for me with cruel time;     For I am weary of this eager care         That never dies;     I would be born into your tranquil air,         Your deserts crowned and sovereign silences.      I would, but that the world is beautiful,       And I am more in love with the sliding years,       They have not brought me frantic joy or tears,     But only moderate state and temperate rule;         Not to forget     This quiet beauty, not to be Time’s fool,         I will be man a little longer yet.      For lo, what beauty crowns the harvest hills!--       The buckwheat acres gleam like silver shields;       The oats hang tarnished in the golden fields;     Between the elms the yellow wheat-land fills;         The apples drop     Within the orchard, where the red tree spills,         The fragrant fruitage over branch and prop.      The cows go lowing through the lovely vale;       The clarion peacock warns the world of rain,       Perched on the barn a gaudy weather-vane;     The farm lad holloes from the shifted rail,         Along the grove     He beats a measure on his ringing pail,         And sings the heart-song of his early love.      There is a honey scent along the air;       The hermit thrush has tuned his fleeting note.       Among the silver birches far remote     His spirit voice appeareth here and there,         To fail and fade,     A visionary cadence falling fair,         That lifts and lingers in the hollow shade.      And now a spirit in the east, unseen,       Raises the moon above her misty eyes,       And travels up the veiled and starless skies,     Viewing the quietude of her demesne;         Stainless and slow,     I watch the lustre of her planet’s sheen,         From burnished gold to liquid silver flow.      And now I leave the dead with you, O night;       You wear the semblance of their fathomless state,       For you we long when the day’s fire is great,     And when stern life is cruellest in his might,         Of death we dream:     A country of dim plain and shadowy height,         Crowned with strange stars and silences supreme:      Rest here, for day is hot to follow you,       Rest here until the morning star has come,       Until is risen aloft dawn’s rosy dome,     Based deep on buried crimson into blue,         And morn’s desire     Has made the fragile cobweb drenched with dew         A net of opals veiled with dreamy fire.              SONG       I have done,     Put by the lute;     Songs and singing soon are over,     Soon as airy shades that hover     Up above the purple clover--     I have done, put by the lute.     Once I sang as early thrushes     Sing about the dewy bushes,     Now I’m mute;     I am like a weary linnet,     For my throat has no song in it,     I have had my singing minute.     I have done,     Put by the lute.              THE MAGIC HOUSE       In her chamber, wheresoe’er       Time shall build the walls of it,     Melodies shall minister,       Mellow sounds shall flit     Through a dusk of musk and myrrh.      Lingering in the spaces vague,       Like the breath within a flute,     Winds shall move along the stair;       When she walketh mute     Music meet shall greet her there.      Time shall make a truce with Time,       All the languid dials tell     Irised hours of gossamer,       Eve perpetual     Shall the night or light defer.      From her casement she shall see       Down a valley wild and dim,     Swart with woods of pine and fir;       Shall the sunsets swim     Red with untold gold to her.      From her terrace she shall see       Lines of birds like dusky motes     Falling in the heated glare;       How an eagle floats     In the wan unconscious air.      From her turret she shall see       Vision of a cloudy place,     Like a group of opal flowers       On the verge of space,     Or a town, or crown of towers.      From her garden she shall hear       Fall the cones between the pines;     She shall seem to hear the sea,       Or behind the vines     Some small noise, a voice may be.      But no thing shall habit there,       There no human foot shall fall,     No sweet word the silence stir,       Naught her name shall call,     Nothing come to comfort her.      But about the middle night,       When the dusk is loathéd most,     Ancient thoughts and words long said,       Like an alien host,     There shall come unsummonéd.      With her forehead on her wrist       She shall lean against the wall     And see all the dream go by;       In the interval     Time shall turn Eternity.      But the agony shall pass--       Fainting with unuttered prayer,     She shall see the world’s outlines       And the weary glare     And the bare unvaried pines.              IN THE HOUSE OF DREAMS            I      The lady Lillian knelt upon the sward,       Between the arbour and the almond leaves;       Beyond, the barley gathered into sheaves;     A blade of gladiolus, like a sword,     Flamed fierce against the gold; and down toward       The limpid west, a pallid poplar wove       A spell of shadow; through the meadow drove     A deep unbroken brook without a ford.      A fountain flung and poised a golden ball;       On the soft grass a frosted serpent lay,     With oval spots of opal over all;       Upon the basin’s edge within the spray,     Lulled by some craft of laughter in the fall,       An ancient crow dreamed hours and hours away.            II      The lady watched the serpent and the crow       For days, then came a little naked lad,       And smote the serpent with a spear he had;     Then stooped and caught the coil, and straining slow,     Took the lithe weight upon his shoulder, so,       And tugged, but could not move the ponderous thing,       Then flushing red with rage, his spear did fling,     And cut the gladiolus at one blow.      Then back he swung his flaming weapon high,       And smote the snake and called a magic name;     Then the whole garden vanished utterly,       And through a mist the lightning went and came,     And flooded all the caverns of the sky,       A rosy gulf of unimprisoned flame.              THE RIVER TOWN       There’s a town where shadows run       In the sparkle and the blue,     By the river and the sun       Swept and flooded thro’ and thro’.      There the sailor trolls a song,       There the sea-gull dips her wing,     There the wind is clear and strong,       There the waters break and swing.      But at night with leaden sweep       Come the clouds along the flood,     Lifting in the vaulted deep       Pinions of a giant brood.      Charging by the slip, the whole       River rushes black and sheer,     There the great fish heave and roll       In the gloom beyond the pier.      All the lonely hollow town       Towers above the windy quay,     And the ancient tide goes down       With its secret to the sea.              OFF THE ISLE AUX COUDRES       The moon, Capella, and the Pleiades       Silver the river’s grey uncertain floor;       Only a heron haunts the grassy shore;     A fox barks sharply in the cedar trees;     Then comes the lift and lull of plangent seas,       Swaying the light marish grasses more and more       Until they float, and the slow tide brims o’er,     And then a rivulet runs along the breeze.      O night! thou art so beautiful, so strange, so sad;       I feel that sense of scope and ancientness,     Of all the mighty empires thou hast had       Dreaming of power beneath thy palace dome,     Of how thou art untouched by their distress,       Supreme above this dreaming land, my home.              AT LES EBOULEMENTS           TO M. E. S.       The bay is set with ashy sails,       With purple shades that fade and flee,     And curling by in silver wales,       The tide is straining from the sea.      The grassy points are slowly drowned,       The water laps and over-rolls,     The wicker pêche; with shallow sound       A light wave labours on the shoals.      The crows are feeding in the foam,       They rise in crowds tumultuously,     ‘Come home,’ they cry, ‘come home, come home,       And leave the marshes to the sea.’              ABOVE ST. IRÉNÉE       I rested on the breezy height,       In cooler shade and clearer air,         Beneath a maple tree;           Below, the mighty river took     Its sparkling shade and sheeny light         Down to the sombre sea,           And clustered by the leaping brook,         The roofs of white St. Irénée.      The sapphire hills on either hand       Broke down upon the silver tide,         The river ran in streams,           In streams of mingled azure-grey,     With here a broken purple band,         And whorls of drab, and beams           Of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52935"],["title","Mr. Blake's Walking-Stick: A Christmas Story for Boys and Girls (#1)"],["body","’ use to butt my head agin the machines, when I ain’t got no eyes nother. It’s like a goat trying its head on a locomotive. Ef I could only eddicate Peter and the other two, I’d be satisfied. You see, I never had no book-larnin’ myself, and I can’t talk proper no more’n a cow can climb a tree.”  “But, Mr. Sitles, how much would a broom-machine cost you?” asked the minister.  “More’n it’s any use to think on. It’ll cost seventy dollars, and if it cost seventy cents ’twould be jest exactly seventy cents more’n I could afford to pay. For the money my ole woman gits fer washin’ don’t go noways at all towards feedin’ the four children, let alone buying me a machine.”  The minister looked at his cane, but it did not answer him. Something must be done. The minister was sure of that. Perhaps the walking-stick was, too. But what?  That was the question.  The minister told Sitles good-bye, and started to make other visits. And on the way the cane kept crying out, “Something _must_ be done,--something MUST be done,--something MUST be done,” making the _must_ ring out sharper every time. When Mr. Blake and the walking-stick got to the market-house, just as they turned off from Milk Street into the busier Main Street, the cane changed its tune and begun to say, “But what,--but _what_,--but WHAT,--but WHAT,” until it said it so sharply that the minister’s head ached, and he put Old Ebony under his arm, so that it couldn’t talk any more. It was a way he had of hushing it up when he wanted to think.     CHAPTER II.  _LONG-HEADED WILLIE._   “De biskits is cold, and de steaks is cold as--as--ice, and dinner’s spiled!” said Curlypate, a girl about three years old, as Mr. Blake came in from his forenoon of visiting. She tried to look very much vexed and “put out,” but there was always either a smile or a cry hidden away in her dimpled cheek.  “Pshaw! Curlypate,” said Mr. Blake, as he put down his cane, “you don’t scold worth a cent!” And he lifted her up and kissed her.  And then Mamma Blake smiled, and they all sat down to the table. While they ate, Mr. Blake told about his morning visits, and spoke of Parm’ly without coal, and Peter Sitles with no broom-machine, and described little Ben Sitles’s hungry face, and told how he had visited the widow Martin, who had no sewing-machine, and who had to receive help from the overseer of the poor. The overseer told her that she must bind out her daughter, twelve years old, and her boy of ten, if she expected to have any help; and the mother’s heart was just about broken at the thought of losing her children.  Now, while all this was taking place, Willie Blake, the minister’s son, a boy about thirteen years of age, sat by the big porcelain water-pitcher, listening to all that was said. His deep blue eyes looked over the pitcher at his father, then at his mother, taking in all their descriptions of poverty with a wondrous pitifulness. But he did not say much. What went on in his long head I do not know, for his was one of those heads that projected forward and backward, and the top of which overhung the base, for all the world like a load of hay. Now and then his mother looked at him, as if she would like to see through his skull and read his thoughts. But I think she didn’t see anything but the straight, silken, fine, flossy hair, silvery white, touched a little bit,--only a little,--as he turned it in looking from one to the other, with a tinge of what people call a golden, but what is really a sort of a pleasant straw color. He usually talked, and asked questions, and laughed like other boys; but now he seemed to be swallowing the words of his father and mother more rapidly even than he did his dinner; for, like most boys, he ate as if it were a great waste of time to eat. But when he was done he did not hurry off as eagerly as usual to reading or to play. He sat and listened.  “What makes you look so sober, Willie?” asked Helen, his sister.  “What you thinkin’, Willie?” said Curlypate, peering through the pitcher handle at him.  “Willie,” broke in his father, “mamma and I are going to a wedding out at Sugar Hill”--  “Sugar Hill; O my!” broke in Curlypate.  “Out at Sugar Hill,” continued Mr. Blake, stroking the Curlypate, “and as I have some calls to make, we shall not be back till bedtime. I am sorry to keep you from your play this Saturday afternoon, but we have no other housekeeper but you and Helen. See that the children get their suppers early, and be careful about fire.”  I believe to “be careful about fire” is the last command that every parent gives to children on leaving them alone.  Now I know that people who write stories are very careful nowadays not to make their boys too good. I suppose that I ought to represent Willie as “taking on” a good deal when he found that he couldn’t play all Saturday afternoon, as he had expected. But I shall not. For one thing, at least, in my story, is true; that is, Willie. If I tell you that he is good you may believe it. I have seen him.  He only said, “Yes, sir.”  Mrs. Blake did not keep a girl. The minister did not get a small fortune of a salary. So it happened that Willie knew pretty well how to keep house. He was a good brave boy, never ashamed to help his mother in a right manly way. He could wash dishes and milk the cow, and often, when mamma had a sick-headache, had he gotten a good breakfast, never forgetting tea and toast for the invalid.  So Sancho, the Canadian pony, was harnessed to the minister’s rusty buggy, and Mr. and Mrs. Blake got in and told the children good-bye. Then Sancho started off, and had gone about ten steps, when he was suddenly reined up with a “Whoa!”  “Willie!” said Mr. Blake.  “Sir.”  “Be careful about fire.”  “Yes, sir.”  And then old blackey-brown Sancho moved on in a gentle trot, and Willie and Helen and Richard went into the house, where Curlypate had already gone, and where they found her on tiptoe, with her short little fingers in the sugar-bowl, trying in vain to find a lump that would not go to pieces in the vigorous squeeze that she gave it in her desire to make sure of it.  So Willie washed the dishes, while Helen wiped them, and Richard put them away, and they had a merry time, though Willie had to soothe several rising disputes between Helen and Richard. Then a glorious lot of wood was gotten in, and Helen came near sweeping a hole in the carpet in her eager desire to “surprise mamma,” Curlypate went in the parlor and piled things up in a wonderful way, declaring that she, too, was going to “_susprise_ mamma.” And doubtless mamma would have felt no little surprise if she could have seen the parlor after Curlypate “put it to rights.”  Later in the evening the cow was milked, and a plain supper of bread and milk eaten. Then Richard and Curlypate were put away for the night. And presently Helen, who was bravely determined to keep Willie company, found her head trying to drop off her shoulders, and so she had to give up to the “sand man,” and go to bed.     CHAPTER III.  _THE WALKING-STICK A TALKING STICK._   Willie was now all by himself. He put on more wood, and drew the rocking-chair up by the fire, and lay back in it. It was very still; he could hear every mouse that moved. The stillness seemed to settle clear down to his heart. Presently a wagon went clattering by. Then, as the sound died away in the distance, it seemed stiller than ever. Willie tried to sleep; but he couldn’t. He kept listening; and after all he was listening to nothing; nothing but that awful clock, that would keep up such a tick-tick, tick-tick, tick-tick. The curtains were down, and Willie didn’t dare to raise them, or to peep out. He could _feel_ how dark it was out doors.  But presently he forgot the stillness. He fell to thinking of what Mr. Blake had said at dinner. He thought of poor old rheumatic Parm’ly, and her single bucket of coal at a time. He thought of the blind broom-maker who needed a broom-machine, and of the poor widow whose children must be taken away because the mother had no sewing-machine. All of these thoughts made the night seem dark, and they made Willie’s heart heavy. But the thoughts kept him company.  Then he wished he was rich, and he thought if he were as rich as Captain Purser, who owned the mill, he would give away sewing-machines to all poor widows who needed them. But pshaw! what was the use of wishing? His threadbare pantaloons told him how far off he was from being rich.  But he would go to the Polytechnic; he would become a civil engineer. He would make a fortune some day when he became celebrated. Then he would give widow Martin a sewing-machine. This was the nice castle in the air that Willie built. But just as he put on the last stone a single thought knocked it down.  What would become of the widow and her children while he was learning to be an engineer and making a fortune afterward? And where would he get the money to go to the Polytechnic? This last question Willie had asked every day for a year or two past.  [Illustration]  Unable to solve this problem, his head grew tired, and he lay down on the lounge, saying to himself, “Something must be done!”  “Something must be done!” Willie was sure somebody spoke. He looked around. There was nobody in the room.  “Something _must_ be done!” This time he saw in the corner of the room, barely visible in the shadow, his father’s cane. The voice seemed to come from that corner.  “Something MUST be done!” Yes, it was the cane. He could see its yellow head, and the face on one side was toward him. How bright its eyes were! It did not occur to Willie just then that there was anything surprising in the fact that the walking-stick had all at once become a talking stick.  “Something MUST be done!” said the cane, lifting its one foot up and bringing it down with emphasis at the word must. Willie felt pleased that the little old man--I mean the walking-stick--should come to his help.  “I tell you what,” said Old Ebony, hopping out of his shady"]]]
