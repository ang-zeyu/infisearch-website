The multitude gave vent to their impatience by shouting, singing, and quarrelling; but the priests and magnates on the steps preserved a dignified and solemn silence.  Each, with his steady, unmoved gaze, his stiffly-curled false wig and beard, and his solemn, deliberate manner, resembled the two huge statues, which, the one precisely similar to the other, stood also motionless in their respective places, gazing calmly into the stream.  At last silken sails, chequered with purple and blue, appeared in sight.  The crowd shouted with delight.  Cries of, \"They are coming!  Here they are!\"  \"Take care, or you'll tread on that kitten,\"  \"Nurse, hold the child higher that she may see something of the sight.\"  \"You are pushing me into the water, Sebak!\"  \"Have a care Phoenician, the boys are throwing burs into your long beard.\"  \"Now, now, you Greek fellow, don't fancy that all Egypt belongs to you, because Amasis allows you to live on the shores of the sacred river!\"  \"Shameless set, these Greeks, down with them!\" shouted a priest, and the cry was at once echoed from many mouths. \"Down with the eaters of swine's flesh and despisers of the gods!\"       [The Egyptians, like the Jews, were forbidden to eat swine's flesh.      This prohibition is mentioned in the Ritual of the Dead, found in a      grave in Abd-el-Qurnah, and also in other places.  Porphyr. de      Abstin. IV.  The swine was considered an especially unclean animal      pertaining to Typhon (Egyptian, Set) as the boar to Ares, and      swineherds were an especially despised race.  Animals with bristles      were only sacrificed at the feasts of Osiris and Eileithyia.  Herod.      I. 2. 47.  It is probable that Moses borrowed his prohibition of      swine's flesh from the Egyptian laws with regard to unclean      animals.]  From words they were proceeding to deeds, but the police were not to be trifled with, and by a vigorous use of their staves, the tumult was soon stilled.  The large, gay sails, easily to be distinguished among the brown, white and blue ones of the smaller Nile-boats which swarmed around them, came nearer and nearer to the expectant throng.  Then at last the crown-prince and the dignitaries arose from their seats.  The royal band of trumpeters blew a shrill and piercing blast of welcome, and the first of the expected boats stopped at the landing-place.  It was a rather long, richly-gilded vessel, and bore a silver sparrow- hawk as figure-head.  In its midst rose a golden canopy with a purple covering, beneath which cushions were conveniently arranged.  On each deck in the forepart of the ship sat twelve rowers, their aprons attached by costly fastenings.       [Splendid Nile-boats were possessed, in greater or less numbers, by      all the men of high rank.  Even in the tomb of Ti at Sakkara, which      dates from the time of the Pyramids, we meet with a chief overseer      of the vessels belonging to a wealthy Egyptian.]  Beneath the canopy lay six fine-looking men in glorious apparel; and before the ship had touched the shore the youngest of these, a beautiful fair-haired youth, sprang on to the steps.  Many an Egyptian girl's mouth uttered a lengthened \"Ah\" at this glorious sight, and even the grave faces of some of the dignitaries brightened into a friendly smile.  The name of this much-admired youth was Bartja.       [This Bartja is better known under the name of Smerdis, but on what      account the Greeks gave him this name is not clear.  In the      cuneiform inscriptions of Bisitun or Behistun, he is called Bartja,      or, according to Spiegel, Bardiya.  We have chosen, for the sake of      the easy pronunciation, the former, which is Rawlinson's simplified      reading of the name.]  He was the son of the late, and brother of the reigning king of Persia, and had been endowed by nature with every gift that a youth of twenty years could desire for himself.  Around his tiara was wound a blue and white turban, beneath which hung fair, golden curls of beautiful, abundant hair; his blue eyes sparkled with life and joy, kindness and high spirits, almost with sauciness; his noble features, around which the down of a manly beard was already visible, were worthy of a Grecian sculptor's chisel, and his slender but muscular figure told of strength and activity.  The splendor of his apparel was proportioned to his personal beauty.  A brilliant star of diamonds and turquoises glittered in the front of his tiara.  An upper garment of rich white and gold brocade reaching just below the knees, was fastened round the waist with a girdle of blue and white, the royal colors of Persia.  In this girdle gleamed a short, golden sword, its hilt and scabbard thickly studded with opals and sky-blue turquoises.  The trousers were of the same rich material as the robe, fitting closely at the ankle, and ending within a pair of short boots of light-blue leather.  The long, wide sleeves of his robe displayed a pair of vigorous arms, adorned with many costly bracelets of gold and jewels; round his slender neck and on his broad chest lay a golden chain.  Such was the youth who first sprang on shore.  He was followed by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, a young Persian of the blood royal, similar in person to Bartja, and scarcely less gorgeously apparelled than he.  The third to disembark was an aged man with snow-white hair, in whose face the gentle and kind expression of childhood was united, with the intellect of a man, and the experience of old age.  His dress consisted of a long purple robe with sleeves, and the yellow boots worn by the Lydians;--his whole appearance produced an impression of the greatest modesty and a total absence of pretension.       [On account of these boots, which are constantly mentioned, Croesus      was named by the oracle \"soft-footed.\"]  Yet this simple old man had been, but a few years before, the most envied of his race and age; and even in our day at two thousand years' interval, his name is used as a synonyme for the highest point of worldly riches attainable by mankind.  The old man to whom we are now introduced is no other than Croesus, the dethroned king of Lydia, who was then living at the court of Cambyses, as his friend and counsellor, and had accompanied the young Bartja to Egypt, in the capacity of Mentor.  Croesus was followed by Prexaspes, the king's Ambassador, Zopyrus, the son of Megabyzus, a Persian noble, the friend of Bartja and Darius; and, lastly, by his own son, the slender, pale Gyges, who after having become dumb in his fourth year through the fearful anguish he had suffered on his father's account at the taking of Sardis, had now recovered the power of speech.  Psamtik descended the steps to welcome the strangers.  His austere, sallow face endeavored to assume a smile.  The high officials in his train bowed down nearly to the ground, allowing their arms to hang loosely at their sides.  The Persians, crossing their hands on their breasts, cast themselves on the earth before the heir to the Egyptian throne.  When the first formalities were over, Bartja, according to the custom of his native country, but greatly to the astonishment of the populace, who were totally unaccustomed to such a sight, kissed the sallow cheek of the Egyptian prince; who shuddered at the touch of a stranger's unclean lips, then took his way to the litters waiting to convey him and his escort to the dwelling designed for them by the king, in the palace at Sais.  A portion of the crowd streamed after the strangers, but the larger number remained at their places, knowing that many a new and wonderful sight yet awaited them.  \"Are you going to run after those dressed-up monkeys and children of Typhon, too?\"  asked an angry priest of his neighbor, a respectable tailor of Sais.  \"I tell you, Puhor, and the high-priest says so too, that these strangers can bring no good to the black land!  I am for the good old times, when no one who cared for his life dared set foot on Egyptian soil.  Now our streets are literally swarming with cheating Hebrews, and above all with those insolent Greeks whom may the gods destroy!       [The Jews were called Hebrews (Apuriu) by the Egyptians; as brought      to light by Chabas.  See Ebers, Aegypten I.  p. 316.  H. Brugsch      opposes this opinion.]  \"Only look, there is the third boat full of strangers!  And do you know what kind of people these Persians are?  The high-priest says that in the whole of their kingdom, which is as large as half the world, there is not a single temple to the gods; and that instead of giving decent burial to the dead, they leave them to be torn in pieces by dogs and vultures.\"       [These statements are correct, as the Persians, at the time of the      dynasty of the Achaemenidae, had no temples, but used fire-altars      and exposed their dead to the dogs and vultures.  An impure corpse      was not permitted to defile the pure earth by its decay; nor might      it be committed to the fire or water for destruction, as their      purity would be equally polluted by such an act.  But as it was      impossible to cause the dead bodies to vanish, Dakhmas or burying-      places were laid out, which had to be covered with pavement and      cement not less than four inches thick, and surrounded by cords to      denote that the whole structure was as it were suspended in the air,      and did not come in contact with the pure earth.  Spiegel, Avesta      II.]  \"The tailor's indignation at hearing this was even greater than his astonishment, and pointing to the landing-steps, he cried:  \"It is really too bad; see, there is the sixth boat full of these foreigners!\"  \"Yes, it is hard indeed!\"  sighed the priest, \"one might fancy a whole army arriving.  Amasis will go on in this manner until the strangers drive him from his throne and country,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5452"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 03 (#1)"],["body","gypt, would he but hearken to our counsel, and to the commandments of the gods!\"  \"But hear me, my father! in his emotion he granted me the life of Phanes!\"  \"Thine eyes flash, Psamtik! that pleaseth me not.  The Athenian must die, for he has offended the gods; but though he that condemns must let justice have her way, he should have no pleasure in the death of the condemned; rather should he mourn.  Now speak; didst thou obtain aught further?\"  \"The king declared unto me to what house Nitetis belongs.\"  \"And further naught?\"  \"No, my father; but art thou not eager to learn ... ?\"  \"Curiosity is a woman's vice; moreover, I have long known all that thou canst tell me.\"  \"But didst thou not charge me but yesterday to ask my father this question?\"  \"I did do so to prove thee, and know whether thou wert resigned to the Divine will, and wert walking in those ways wherein alone thou canst become worthy of initiation into the highest grade of knowledge. Thou hast told us faithfully all that thou hast heard, and thereby proved that thou canst obey--the first virtue of a priest.\"  \"Thou knewest then the father of Nitetis?\"  \"I myself pronounced the prayer over king Hophra's tomb.\"  \"But who imparted the secret to thee?\"  \"The eternal stars, my son, and my skill in reading them.\"  \"And do these stars never deceive?\"  \"Never him that truly understands them.\"  Psamtik turned pale.  His father's dream and his own fearful horoscope passed like awful visions through his mind.  The priest detected at once the change in his features and said gently: \"Thou deem'st thyself a lost man because the heavens prognosticated evil at thy birth; but take comfort, Psamtik; I observed another sign in the heavens at that moment, which escaped the notice of the astrologers.  Thy horoscope was a threatening, a very threatening one, but its omens may be averted, they may .  .  .\"  \"O tell me, father, tell me how!\"  \"They must turn to good, if thou, forgetful of all else, canst live alone to the gods, paying a ready obedience to the Divine voice audible to us their priests alone in the innermost and holiest sanctuary.\"  \"Father, I am ready to obey thy slightest word.\"  \"The great goddess Neith, who rules in Sais, grant this, my son!\" answered the priest solemnly.  \"But now leave me alone,\" he continued kindly, \"lengthened devotions and the weight of years bring weariness. If possible, delay the death of Phanes, I wish to speak with him before he dies.  Yet one more word.  A troop of Ethiopians arrived yesterday. These men cannot speak a word of Greek, and under a faithful leader, acquainted with the Athenians and the locality, they would be the best agents for getting rid of the doomed man, as their ignorance of the language and the circumstances render treachery or gossip impossible. Before starting for Naukratis, they must know nothing of the design of their journey; the deed once accomplished, we can send them back to Kush.--[The Egyptian name for Ethiopia.]  Remember, a secret can never be too carefully kept!  Farewell.\"  Psamtik had only left the room a few moments, when a young priest entered, one of the king's attendants.  \"Have I listened well, father?\"  he enquired of the old man.  \"Perfectly, my son.  Nothing of that which passed between Amasis and Psamtik has escaped thine ears.  May Isis preserve them long to thee!\"  \"Ah, father, a deaf man could have heard every word in the ante-chamber to-day, for Amasis bellowed like an ox.\"  \"The great Neith has smitten him with the lack of prudence, yet I command thee to speak of the Pharaoh with more reverence.  But now return, keep thine eyes open and inform me at once if Amasis, as is possible, should attempt to thwart the conspiracy against Phanes.  Thou wilt certainly find me here.  Charge the attendants to admit no one, and to say I am at my devotions in the Holy of holies.  May the ineffable One protect thy footsteps!\"       [Isis, the wife or sister of Osiris, is the phenomena of nature, by      means of which the god is able to reveal himself to human      contemplation.]                 ..................................  While Psamtik was making every preparation for the capture of Phanes, Croesus, accompanied by his followers, had embarked on board a royal bark, and was on his way down the Nile to spend the evening with Rhodopis.  His son Gyges and the three young Persians remained in Sais, passing the time in a manner most agreeable to them.  Amasis loaded them with civilities, allowed them, according to Egyptian custom, the society of his queen and of the twin-sisters, as they were called, taught Gyges the game of draughts, and looking on while the strong, dexterous, young heroes joined his daughters in the game of throwing balls and hoops, so popular among Egyptian maidens, enlivened their amusements with an inexhaustible flow of wit and humor.       [The Pharaohs themselves, as well as their subjects, were in the      habit of playing at draughts and other similar games.  Rosellini      gives its Rameses playing with his daughter; see also two Egyptians      playing together, Wilkinson II.  419.  An especially beautiful      draught-board exists in the Egyptian collection at the Louvre      Museum.  The Egyptians hoped to be permitted to enjoy these      pleasures even in the other world.]       [Balls that have been found in the tombs are still to be seen; some,      for instance, in the Museum at Leyden.]  \"Really,\" said Bartja, as he watched Nitetis catching the slight hoop, ornamented with gay ribbons, for the hundredth time on her slender ivory rod, \"really we must introduce this game at home.  We Persians are so different from you Egyptians.  Everything new has a special charm for us, while to you it is just as hateful.  I shall describe the game to Our mother Kassandane, and she will be delighted to allow my brother's wives this new amusement.\"  \"Yes, do, do!\"  exclaimed the fair Tachot blushing deeply.  \"Then Nitetis can play too, and fancy herself back again at home and among those she loves; and Bartja,\"  she added in a low voice,  \"whenever you watch the hoops flying, you too must remember this hour.\"  \"I shall never forget it,\" answered he with a smile, and then, turning to his future sister-in-law, he called out cheerfully, \"Be of good courage, Nitetis, you will be happier than you fancy with us.  We Asiatics know how to honor beauty; and prove it by taking many wives.\"  Nitetis sighed, and the queen Ladice exclaimed, \"On the contrary, that very fact proves that you understand but poorly how to appreciate woman's nature!  You can have no idea, Bartja, what a woman feels on finding that her husband--the man who to her is more than life itself, and to whom she would gladly and without reserve give up all that she treasures as most sacred--looks down on her with the same kind of admiration that he bestows on a pretty toy, a noble steed, or a well-wrought wine-bowl. But it is yet a thousand-fold more painful to feel that the love which every woman has a right to possess for herself alone, must be shared with a hundred others!\"  \"There speaks the jealous wife!\"  exclaimed Amasis.  \"Would you not fancy that I had often given her occasion to doubt my faithfulness?\"  \"No, no, my husband,\" answered Ladice, \"in this point the Egyptian men surpass other nations, that they remain content with that which they have once loved; indeed I venture to assert that an Egyptian wife is the happiest of women.       [According to Diodorus (I. 27) the queen of Egypt held a higher      position than the king himself.  The monuments and lists of names      certainly prove that women could rule with sovereign power.  The      husband of the heiress to the throne became king.  They had their      own revenues (Diodorus I. 52) and when a princess, after death, was      admitted among the goddesses, she received her own priestesses.      (Edict of Canopus.)  During the reigns of the Ptolemies many coins      were stamped with the queen's image and cities were named for them.      We notice also that sons, in speaking of their descent, more      frequently reckon it from the mother's than the father's side, that      a married woman is constantly alluded to as the \"mistress\" or \"lady\"      of the house, that according to many a Greek Papyrus they had entire      disposal of all their property, no matter in what it consisted, in      short that the weaker sex seems to have enjoyed equal influence with      the stronger.]  Even the Greeks, who in so many things may serve as patterns to us, do not know how to appreciate woman rightly.  Most of the young Greek girls pass their sad childhood in close rooms, kept to the wheel and the loom by their mothers and those who have charge of them, and when marriageable, are transferred to the quiet house of a husband they do not know, and whose work in life and in the state allows him but seldom to visit his wife's apartments.  Only when the most intimate friends and nearest relations are with her husband, does she venture to appear in their midst, and then shyly and timidly, hoping to hear a little of what is going on in the great world outside.  Ah, indeed! we women thirst for knowledge too, and there are certain branches of learning at least, which it cannot be right to withhold from those who are to be the mothers and educators of the next generation.  What can an Attic mother, without knowledge, without experience, give to her daughters?  Naught but her own ignorance.  And so it is, that a Hellene, seldom satisfied with the society of his lawful, but, mentally, inferior wife, turns for satisfaction to those courtesans, who, from their constant intercourse with men, have acquired knowledge, and well understand how to adorn it with the flowers of feminine grace, and to season it with the salt of a woman's more refined and delicate wit.  In Egypt it is different.  A young girl is allowed to associate freely with the most enlightened men. Youths and maidens"]]]
