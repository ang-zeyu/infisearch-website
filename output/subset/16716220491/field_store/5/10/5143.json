Sister Eliza returned from a long tour of missionary labor just in time to preside at a grand Mass Meeting of 15,000 women, held in the Theatre, November 16th, 1878, in reply to representations of the Anti-Polygamic Society. The year 1880 was spent visiting the L. D. S. Women's Organizations, and the production of the Childrens Primary Hymn Book, soon followed by a tune book to accompany the above. On Saturday, July 17th, Fourteenth Ward Assembly Rooms, President John Taylor ordained Sister Eliza to the office to which she had been elected; President of Latter Day Saints' Women's Organizations throughout the world, wherever our people are; also, Sister Zina D. H. Young as her First Counselor, Elizabeth A. Whitney (since deceased) Second Counselor, Sarah M. Kimball as Secretary, and Mary Isabella Horne as Treasurer.  \"In August Sister Eliza visited Sanpete Co., and in Thistle Valley assisted the Bishop in organizing a Relief Society, with an Indian sister as a counselor; the first Indian woman ordained and set apart to an office in this dispensation. November 8th, Sister Eliza accompanied by Sister Zina D. Young, left home for St. George to do a work in the Temple. They traveled over one thousand miles in carriages and wagons, doing missionary work among the Saints. In St. George the anniversary of Sister Eliza's birthday was publicly celebrated, and on the same day the people of Weber Stake paid a delicate tribute to the honorable lady by a similar celebration at Ogden City.  \"Sisters Eliza and Zina returned from St. George March 31st, and were met at the depot by a party of thirty ladies who escorted them to the Lion House, where a reception, a welcome home, awaited them. In 1881, during the intervals of her many public duties, she prepared her new book Bible Questions and Answers. In September, visited Thistle Valley, organizing a Primary Association with ten little Indian children enrolled as members. April 1883, the Relief Society was organized among the Indians at Washakie, an Indian village in Box Elder Co. After duly considering the long-felt necessity among our own people of an institution for the sick and injured, where the ordinances of faith might be administered freely and without restraint, in fact, one that we might term our own, and as one of the links in our system of organizations, the sisters took a course that led to the establishment of the Deseret Hospital, at which institution the dedication services were held, July 17th, 1882, by the First Presidency, Stake Presidency, Apostles Wilford Woodruff and F. D. Richards; Mayor William Jennings, C. W. Penrose, Editor _Deseret News_, L. John Nuttall and Joseph Horne being present. Eliza R. S. Smith, President, E. B. Wells, Secretary.\"  I will conclude this brief sketch with one of her latest poems:    BURY ME QUIETLY WHEN I DIE.    When my spirit ascends to the world above,   To smile with the choirs in celestial love,   Let the finger of silence control the bell,   To restrain the chime of a funeral knell,   Let no mourning strain--not a sound be heard,   By which a pulse of the heart is stirred--   No note of sorrow to prompt a sigh;   Bury me quietly when I die.    I am aiming to earn a celestial crown--   To merit a heavenly; pure renown;   And, whether in grave or in tomb I'm laid,   Beneath the tall oak or the cypress shade;   Whether at home with dear friends around;   Or in distant lands upon stranger ground--   Under wintry clouds or a summer sky;   Bury me quietly when I die.    What avail the parade and the splendor here,   To a legal heir to a heavenly sphere?   To the heirs of salvation what is the worth,   In their perishing state, the frail things of earth?   What is death to the good, but an entrance gate   That is placed on the verge of a rich estate   Where commissioned escorts are waiting by?   Bury me quietly when I die.    On the \"iron rod\" I have laid my hold;   If I keep the faith, and like Paul of old   Shall have \"fought the good fight\" and Christ the Lord   Has a crown in store with a full reward   Of the holy priesthood in fulness rife,   With the gifts and the powers of an endless life,   And a glorious mansion for me on high;   Bury me quietly when I die.    Like a beacon that rises o'er ocean's wave,   There's a light--there's a life beyond the grave;   The future is bright and it beckons me on   Where the noble and pure and the brave have gone;   Those who have battled for truth with their mind and might,   With their garments clean and their armor bright;   They are dwelling with God in a world on high:   Bury me quietly when I die.    ZINA D. H. YOUNG,  FIRST COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE L. D. S. WOMEN'S ORGANIZATIONS.  \"And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.\" How fitting are these sacred words to the subject of this sketch and her family. In obedience to this command renewed in this dispensation, searching through their genealogical records for ten generations back, they have brought forth to light, and to eternal life in the celestial kingdom of God, the forgotten and unknown ancestry of their family, finding now and then some noble representative of their race linked with even a kingdom's honor, and at last, far back, upon the throne of England.  Sister Zina's career of religious devotion and service is not a new feature in the Huntington family, nor America a new field of labor to them. One hundred years ago Lady Salina Huntington, saving to herself only sufficient for the real needs of life, devoted a great portion of her vast fortune to missionary service, for the introduction of Christianity among the North American Indians, by the founding of schools for the natives and the support of ministers and teachers. \"She allowed herself but one dress a year. Lady Salina Huntington was the second daughter of the Earl of Ferrars. She was born in 1707, and was the co-laborer of Whitefield and Wesley. 'The pedigree of Lady Huntington and her husband, and of George Washington, first President of the United States, (as traced by Mapleson in his researches) meet in the same parentage.' 'Lady Huntington and her chaplains often journeyed during the summer, making their presence a means of religious revivals wherever they went. A church needed. With her, to resolve was to accomplish. Her jewels she determined to offer to the Lord. They were sold for six hundred and ninety-eight pounds, and with this she erected a house of worship in 1760. Her daughter, Lady Salina, was one of the six earls daughters chosen to assist the Princess Augusta to bear the train of Queen Charlotte on her coronation day.\" Did it foreshadow an era of revelations dawning upon the world, when she prayed \"that God would give us new bread, not stale, but what was baked in the oven that day.\" Lady Huntington built seven chapels, her private property, beside aiding sixty others. At the age of eighty-four a few hours before the last struggle she whispered joyfully, \"I shall go to my Father tonight,\" and so she went home, June 17th, 1791.  Thus by birthright and by heritage is the land of Freedom the Huntingtons' field of religious labor. The mantles of Lady Huntington and remoter noble ancestors have at last been lifted from the silence and the shadows of departed centuries to the shoulders of worthy descendants and representatives, who are doing works of greater magnitude than they ever comprehended. Superintended by Dimock B. Huntington, and assisted by the family, Zina and her sister Prescinda have been baptized for ten generations, numbering nearly five thousand.  By permission I select from matter collected and published by Emmeline B. Wells, in _Woman's Exponent_ the following portions of biography:  \"Zina Diantha Huntington was born January 31st, 1821, at Watertown. Her father was William Huntington, her mother Zina Baker, whose father was one of the first physicians in New Hampshire. Her grandmother on the mother's side was Dorcas Dimock, 'descended from the noble family of Dimocks, whose representatives held the hereditary knight-championship of England; instance: Sir Edward Dymock, Queen Elizabeth's champion.'  \"The father of Mrs. Zina D. H. Young was also a patriot and served in the war of 1812. Samuel Huntington, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, was the uncle of this old revolutionary soldier. She says: 'My father's family is directly descended from Simon Huntington, the Puritan immigrant who sailed for America in 1633. He died at sea, but left three sons and his widow, Margaret. The church records of Roxbury, Mass., contain the earliest record of the Huntington name known in New England, and is in the handwriting of the Rev. John Elliot himself, the pastor of that ancient church. This is the record: 'Margaret Huntington, widow, came in 1633, her husband died by the way of small pox. She brought children with her.' 'My grandfather, Wm. Huntington, the revolutionary soldier, married Prescinda Lathrop, and was one of the first settlers in the Black River Valley, Northern New York. The Huntingtons and Lathrops intermarried, and my sister Prescinda Lathrop Huntington, bears the family name of generations.' The Huntingtons embraced the Gospel at Watertown, New York, and Zina D., when only fifteen years old was baptized by the Patriarch Hyrum Smith, August 14th, 1835, and soon after went to Kirtland with her father's family. In this year she received the gift of tongues. On one occasion in the Kirtland Temple she heard a whole invisible choir of angels singing, till the house seemed filled with numberless voices. At Kirtland she received the gift of interpretation. She was also at the memorable Pentecost when the spirit of God filled the house like a mighty, rushing wind. Zina was also a member of the Kirtland Temple Choir, of whom but few are now living."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50959"],["title","End as a World (#1)"],["body"," in time. Not that it really mattered.  It was more crowded than usual for Saturday, but at the same time it was quiet. People were shopping, but they weren't really buying much or else they bought it faster. Nobody wanted to miss it. They all seemed to have one eye on their lists and another on the clock.  Howie and Paul came up the street and we nodded and said something. A few other boys from the school passed by and we stopped. We gathered together. It was getting closer--and the space between the minutes was growing longer and longer.  I looked at Paul's watch. He said it was on the minute. I decided there was time to go in and get a candy bar. All of a sudden I was hungry. I didn't know where it came from. I'd had to stuff down lunch not long ago. And now I was hungry.  I went to a store and had to fight my way in. People were coming out. Not just customers, but the clerks and owner, too. There was a big television screen inside, but nobody wanted to see it on that. They wanted to be outside where it would happen to them. Not just see it, have it happen. The store was empty. Not closed--empty.  I turned and rushed out to join the others. I couldn't miss it. There were still minutes to go, but suppose there _had_ been a miscalculation. I knew what that would mean, but even so I had to be there. I would almost die, too.  Now we were all looking up--all over the world people were, I suppose. It was quiet. You could hear them breathing.  And then it came, a flash across the sky, a silver streak, the biggest vapor trail there ever was. It went from this side to that side in no time. It split the sky and was gone before the shock blast hit us. Nobody said anything. We stood there and shivered and straightened up after the rumbling sound passed.  But there was the vapor trail that stretched farther than anyone could see. It would go around the world at least once before it came to an end somewhere in the desert. I saw my science teacher--he was trying to smile, but couldn't. And then there was the pharmacist who had wanted to be a research chemist, but wasn't good enough.  In front of me, old Fred Butler who drives the bus to Orange Point and King City cracked his knuckles. \"He did it,\" he whispered. \"All the way to Mars and back. Safe and right on schedule.\" He jumped up in the air and kept jumping up. He hadn't been that high off the ground in several years. He never would be again unless he took an elevator. And I knew he hated elevators.  Factory whistles started blowing. They sounded louder than Gabriel. I wonder if he heard them. I grabbed hold of the nearest person and started hugging. I didn't know it was the snooty girl from the next block until she hugged back and began kissing me. We yelled louder than the factory whistles. We had a right.  It was just like the papers said: This was the day the world ended--  And the Universe began."]]]
