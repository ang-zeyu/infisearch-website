I need to stop being a master and start being a man again.\"  Albin sighed. \"Slavery,\" he said. \"You think of slavery and it all rises up in front of you--Greece, India, China, Rome, England, the United States--all the past before the Confederation, all the different slaves.\" He grinned again. \"You think it's terrible, don't you?\"  \"It is terrible,\" Dodd said. \"It's--they're people, just like us. They have a right to their own lives.\"  \"Sure they do,\" Albin said. \"They have the right to--oh, to starve and die in that forest out there, for instance. And work out a lot of primitive rituals, and go through all the Stone Age motions for thousands of years until they develop civilization like you and me. Instead of being kept nice and warm and comfortable and taken care of, and taught things, by the evil old bastards like--well, like you and me again. Right?\"  \"They have rights,\" Dodd said stubbornly. \"They have rights of their own.\"  \"Sure they do,\" Albin agreed with great cheerfulness. \"How'd you like it if they got some of them? Dodd, maybe you'd like to see them starve? Because it's going to be a long, long time before they develop anything like a solid civilization, kiddo. And in the meantime a lot of them are going to die of things we can prevent. Right? And how'd you like that, Dodd? How would you like that?\"  Dodd hesitated. \"We ought to help them,\" he muttered.  \"Well,\" Albin said cheerfully, \"that's what we are doing. Keeping them alive, for instance. And teaching them.\"  \"Teaching,\" Dodd said. Again his voice had the faintly mocking sound of an echo. \"And what are we teaching them? Push this button for us. Watch this process for us. If anything changes push this button. Dig here. Carry there.\" He paused. \"Wonderful--for us. But what good does it do them?\"  \"We've got to live, too,\" Albin said.  Dodd stared. \"At their expense?\"  \"It's a living,\" Albin said casually, shrugging. Then: \"But I'm serious. One good dose of real enjoyment will cure you, friend. One good dose of fun--by which, kiddo, I mean plain ordinary old sex, such as can be had any free evening around here--and you'll stop being depressed and worried. Uncle Albin Cendar's Priceless Old Recipe, kiddo, and don't argue with me: it works.\"  Dodd said nothing at all. After a few seconds his eyes slowly closed and he sat like a statue in the room.  Albin, watching him, whistled inaudibly under his breath. A minute went by silently. The light in the room began to diminish.  \"Sun's going down,\" Albin offered.  There was no response. Albin got up again and went to the window.  \"Maybe you're right,\" he said with his back to Dodd's still figure. \"There ought to be some way of getting people off-planet, people who just don't want to stay here.\"  \"Do you know why there isn't?\" Dodd's voice was a shock, stronger than before.  \"Sure I know,\" Albin said. \"There's--\"  \"Slavery,\" Dodd said. \"Oh, sure, maybe somebody knows about it, but it's got to be kept quiet. And if anybody got back--well, look.\"  \"Don't bother me with it.\" Albin's voice was suddenly less sure.  \"Look,\" Dodd said. \"The Confederation needs the metal. It exists pure here, and in quantity. But if they knew, really knew, how we mined and smelted and purified it and got it ready for shipment....\"  \"So suppose somebody goes back,\" Albin said. \"Suppose somebody talks. What difference does it make? It's just rumor, nothing official. No, the reason nobody goes back is cargo space, pure and simple. We need every inch of cargo space for the shipments.\"  \"If somebody goes back,\" Dodd said, \"the people will know. Not the government, not the businesses, the people. And the people don't like slavery, Albin. No matter how necessary a government finds it. No matter what kind of a jerry-built defense you can put up for it.\"  \"Don't be silly,\" Albin said. There was less conviction in his voice; he looked out at the sunset as if he were trying to reassure himself.  \"Nobody's allowed to leave,\" Dodd said, more quietly. \"We're--they're taking every precaution they can. But some day--maybe some day, Albin--the people are going to find out in spite of every precaution.\" He sat straighter. \"And then it'll all be over. Then they'll be wiped out, Albin. Wiped out.\"  \"They need us,\" Albin said uncertainly. \"They can't do without us.\"  Dodd swung round to face him. The sunset was a deepening blaze in the Commons Room. \"Wait and find out,\" he said in a voice that suddenly rang on the metal walls. \"Wait and find out.\"         *       *       *       *       *  After a long time Albin said. \"Damn it, what you need is education. A cure. Fun. What I've been saying.\" He paused and took a breath. \"How about it, Dodd?\"  Dodd didn't move. Another second passed. \"All right, Albin,\" he said slowly, at last. \"I'll think about it. I'll think about it.\"     3   The sleeping room for the Small Ones was, by comparison with the great Commons Room only the masters inhabited, a tiny place. It had only the smallest of windows, so placed as to allow daylight without any sight of the outside; the windows were plastic-sheeted slits high up on the metal walls, no more. The room was, at best, dim, during the day, but that hardly mattered: during the day the room was empty. Only at night, when the soft artificial lights went on, shedding the glow from their wall-shielded tubes, was the room fit for normal vision. There were no decorations, of course, and no chairs: the Alberts had no use for chairs, and decorations were a refinement no master had yet bothered to think of. The Alberts were hardly taught to appreciate such things in any case: that was not what they had come to learn: it was not useful.  The floor of the room was covered with soft leaves striped a glossy brown over the pervasive gray-green of the planet's foliage. These served as a soft mat for sleeping, and were also the staple food of the Alberts. These were not disturbed to find their food strewn in such irregular heaps and drifts across the metal floor: in their birth sacs, they had lived by ingestion from the floor of the forest, and, later, they had been so fed in the Birth Huts to which the Elders had taken them, and where they had been cleaned and served and taught, among other matters, English.  What they had been taught was, at any rate, English of a sort, bearing within it the seeds of a more complex tongue, and having its roots far back in the pre-space centuries, when missionaries had first begun to visit strange lands. Men had called it pidgin and Beche-le-mer and a hundred different names in a hundred different variations. Here, the masters called it English. The Alberts called it words, and nothing more.  Now, after sunset, they filed in, thirty or so jewel-green cyclopean alligators at the end of their first day of training, waddling clumsily past the doorway and settled with a grateful, crouching squat on the leaves that served as bed and food. None were bothered by the act of sitting on the leaves: for one thing, they had no concept of dirt. In the second place, they were rather remarkably clean. They had neither sex organs, in any human sense of the word, or specific organs of evacuation: their entire elimination was gaseous. Air ducts in the room would draw off the waste products, and the Alberts never noticed them: they had, in fact, no conception of evacuation as a process, since to them the entire procedure was invisible and impalpable.  The last of them filed in, and the masters--two of them, carrying long metal tubes--shut the door. The Alberts were alone. The door's clang was followed by other sounds as the lock was thrown. The new noises, and the strangeness of bare metal walls and artificial light, still novel after only a single day's training, gave rise to something very like a panic, and a confused babble of voices arose from the crowd.  \"What is this?\"  \"What place is this?\"  \"It is a training place.\"  \"My name Hortat. My name Hortat.\"  \"What is training?\"  \"There is food here.\"  \"What place is this?\"  \"Where are elders?\"  \"Are masters here?\"  \"My food.\"  \"Is this a place for sleeping?\"  \"Training is to do what a master says. Training--\"  \"There are no elders. My name Hortat.\"  \"My place.\"  \"My food.\"  \"Where is this?\"  \"Where is this place?\"  Like the stirring of a child in sleep, the panic lasted only a little while, and gave way to an apathetic peace. Here and there an Albert munched on a leaf, holding it up before his wide mouth in the pose of a giant squirrel. Others sat quietly looking at the walls or the door or the window, or at nothing. One, whose name was Cadnan, stirred briefly and dropped the leaf he was eating and turned to the Albert next to him.  \"Marvor,\" he said. \"Are you troubled?\"  Marvor seemed slighter than Cadnan, and his single eye larger, but both looked very much alike to humans, as members of other races, and particularly such races as the human in question judges inferior, are prone to do. \"I do not know what happens,\" he said in a flat tone. \"I do not know what is this place, or what we do.\"  \"This is the place of masters,\" Cadnan said. \"We train here, and we work here, and live here. It is the rule of the masters.\"  \"Yet I do not know,\" Marvor said. \"This training is a hard thing, and the work is also hard when it comes.\"  Cadnan closed his eye for a second, to relax, but he found he wanted to talk. His first day in the world of the masters had been too confusing for him to order it into any sensible structure. Conversation, of whatever kind, was a release, and might provide more facts. Cadnan was hungry for facts.  He opened his eye again.  \"It is what the masters say,\" he told Marvor. \"The masters say we do a thing, and we do it. This is right.\"  Marvor bent toward him. \"Why is it right?\" he asked.  \"Because the masters say it is right,\" Cadnan told him, with the surprised air of a person explaining the obvious. \"The elders, too, say it before we come to this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51867"],["title","Sentry of the Sky (#1)"],["body","on a U-E level, you can fight the machines; tape your own music if you like.\"  Clarey said nothing, but his initial hostility was ebbing slowly away.  \"I wanted to be a writer,\" Spano said. \"The machines said no. So I became a soldier, rose to the top. Now--this is in strictest confidence--I write most of the episodes of _Sentries of the Sky_ myself. There's always another route for the man with guts and vision, and, above all, faith. Why don't we continue the discussion over lunch?\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was almost unthinkable for L-E and U-E to eat together. For Clarey this was an honor--too great an honor--and there was no way out of it. Spano and the girl put on their masks; the general touched a section of the wall and it slid back. There was a car waiting for them outside. It skimmed over the delicately wrought, immensely strong bridges that, together with the tunnels, linked the great glittering metropolis into a vast efficient whole.  Spano was not really broadminded. Although they went to the _Aurora Borealis_, it was through a side door, and they were served in a private dining room. Clarey was glad and nettled at the same time.  The first few mouthfuls of the food tasted ambrosial; then it cloyed and Clarey had to force it down with a thin, almost astringent pale blue liquid. In itself, the liquor had only a mild, slightly pungent taste, but it made everything else increasingly delightful--the warm, luxurious little room, the perfume that wafted from the air-conditioning ducts, Han Vollard.  \"Martian mountain wine,\" she warned him. \"Rather overwhelming if you're not used to it, and sometimes even if you are....\" Her eyes rested on the general.  \"But there are no mountains on Mars,\" Clarey said, startled.  \"That's it!\" Spano chortled. \"When you've drunk it, you see mountains!\" And he filled his glass again.  While they ate, he told Clarey about Damorlan--its beautiful climate, light gravity, intelligent and civilized natives. Though the planet had been known for two decades, no one from Earth had ever been there except a few selected government officials, and, of course, the regular staff posted there.  \"You mean it hasn't been colonized yet?\" Clarey was relieved, because he felt he should, as an Archivist, have known more about the planet than its name and coordinates. \"Why? It sounds like a splendid place for a colony.\"  \"The natives,\" Spano said.  \"There were natives on a lot of the planets we colonized. You disposed of them somehow.\"  \"By co-existence in most cases, Sub-Archivist,\" Spano said drily. \"We've found it best for Terrans and natives to live side by side in harmony. We dispose of a race only when it's necessary for the greatest good. And we would especially dislike having to dispose of the Damorlanti.\"  \"What's wrong with them?\" Clarey asked, pushing away his half-finished crême brulée a la Betelgeuse with a sigh. \"Are they excessively belligerent, then?\"  \"No more belligerent than any intelligent life-form which has pulled itself up by its bootstraps.\"  \"Rigid?\" Clarey suggested. \"Unadaptable? Intolerant? Indolent? Personally offensive?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Spano smiled. He leaned back with half-shut eyes, as if this were a guessing game. \"None of those.\"  \"Then why consider disposing of them?\" Clarey asked. \"They sound pretty decent for natives. Don't wipe them out; even an ilf has a right to live.\"  \"Clarey,\" the girl said, \"you're drunk.\"  \"I'm in full command of my faculties,\" he assured her. \"My wits are all about me, moving me to ask how you could possibly expect to use a secret agent on Damorlan if there are no colonists. What would he disguise himself as--a touring Earth official?\" He laughed with modest triumph.  Spano smiled. \"He could disguise himself as one of them. They're humanoid.\"  \"_That_ humanoid?\"  \"That humanoid. So there you have the problem in a nutshell.\"  But Clarey still couldn't see that there was a problem. \"I thought we--the human race, that is--were supposed to be the very apotheosis of life species.\"  \"So we are. And that's the impression we've conveyed to such other intelligent life-forms as we've taken under our aegis. What we're afraid of is that the other ilfs might become ... confused when they see the Damorlanti, think they're the ruling race.\" Leaning forward, he pounded so loudly on the table both the others jumped. \"This is our galaxy and we don't intend that anyone, humanoid or otherwise, is going to forget it!\"  \"You're drunk, too, Steff,\" the girl said. She had changed completely; her coquetry had dropped as if it were another mask. And it had been, Clarey thought--an advertising mask. An offer had been made, and, if he accepted it, he would get probably not Han herself but a reasonable facsimile.  He tried to sort things out in his whizzing brain. \"But why should the other ilfs ever see a Damorlant?\" he asked, enunciating very precisely. \"I've never seen another life-form to speak of. I thought the others weren't allowed off-planet--except the Baluts, and there's no mistaking them, is there?\" For the Baluts, although charming, were unmistakably non-human, being purplish, amiable, and octopoid.  \"We don't forbid the ilfs to go off-planet,\" Spano proclaimed. \"That would be tyrannical. We simply don't allow them passage in our spaceships. Since they don't have any of their own, they can't leave.\"  \"Then you're afraid the Damorlanti will develop space travel on their own,\" Clarey cried. \"Superior race--seeking after knowledge--spread their wings and soar to the stars.\" He flapped his arms and fell off the stool.  \"Really, Steff,\" Han said, motioning for the servo-mechanism to pick Clarey up, \"this is no way to conduct an interview.\"  \"I am a creative artist,\" the general said thickly. \"I believe in suiting the interview to the occasion. Clarey understands, for he, too, is an artist.\" The general sneezed and rubbed his nose with his silver sleeve. \"Listen to me, boy. The Damorlanti are a fine, creative, productive race. It isn't generally known, but they developed the op fastener for evening wear, two of the new scents on the roster come from Damorlan, and the snettis is an adaptation of a Damorlant original. Would you want a species as artistic as that to be annihilated by an epidemic?\"  \"Do our germs work on them?\" Clarey wanted to know.  \"That hasn't been established yet. But their germs certainly work on us.\" The general sneezed again. \"That's where I got this sinus trouble, last voyage to Damorlan. But you'll be inoculated, of course. Now we know what to watch out for, so you'll be perfectly safe. That is, as far as disease is concerned.\"         *       *       *       *       *  His face assumed a stern, noble aspect. \"Naturally, if you're discovered as a spy, we'll have to repudiate you. You must know that from the tri-dis.\"  \"But I haven't said I would go!\" Clarey howled. \"And I can't see why you'd want _me_, anyway!\"  \"Modest,\" the general said, lighting a smoke-stick. \"An admirable trait in a young intelligence operative--or, indeed, anyone. Have a smoke-stick?\"  Clarey hesitated. He had never tried one; he had always wanted to.  \"Don't, Clarey,\" the girl advised. \"You'll be sick.\"  She spoke with authority and reason. Clarey shook his head.  The general inhaled and exhaled a cloud of smoke in the shape of a bunnit. \"The Damorlanti look like us, but because they look like us, that doesn't mean they think like us. They may not have the least idea of developing space travel, simply be interested in developing thought, art, ideals, splendid cultural things like that. We don't know enough about them; we may be making mountains out of molehills.\"  \"Martian molehills,\" Clarey snickered.  \"Precisely,\" the general agreed. \"Except that there are no moles on Mars either.\"  \"But I still can't understand. Why _me_?\"  The general leaned forward and said in a confidential tone, \"We want to understand the true Damorlan. Our observations have been too superficial; couldn't help being. There we come, blasting out of the skies with the devil of a noise, running all over the planet as if we owned it. You know how those skyboys throw their gravity around.\"  Clarey nodded. _Sentries of the Sky_ had kept him well informed on such matters.  \"So what we want is a man who can go to Damorlan for five or ten years and become a Damorlant in everything but basic loyalties. A man who will absorb the very spirit of the culture, but in terms our machines can understand and interpret.\" Spano stood erect. \"You, Clarey, are that man!\"  The girl applauded. \"Well done, Steff! You finally got it right side up!\"  \"But I've lived twenty-eight years on this planet and I'm not a part of its culture,\" Clarey protested. \"I'm a lonely, friendless man--you must know that if you've deep-probed me--so why should I put up a front and be brave and proud about it?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Then he gave a short, bitter laugh. \"I see. That's the reason you want me. I have no roots, no ties; I belong nowhere. Nobody loves me. Who else, you think, but a man like me would spend ten years on an alien planet as an alien?\"  \"A patriot, Sub-Archivist,\" the general said sternly. \"By God, sir, a patriot!\"  \"There's nothing I'd like better than to see Terra and all its colonies go up in smoke. Mind you,\" Clarey added quickly, for he was not as drunk as all that, \"I've nothing against the government. It's a purely personal grievance.\"  The general unsteadily patted his arm. \"You're detached, m'boy. You can examine an alien planet objectively, without trying to project your own cultural identity upon it, because you have no cultural identity.\"  \"How about physical identity?\" Clarey asked. \"They can't be ex-exactly like us. Against the laws of nature.\"  \"The laws of man are higher than the laws of nature,\" the general said, waving his arm. A gout of smoke curled around his head and became a halo. \"Very slight matter of plastic surgery."]]]
