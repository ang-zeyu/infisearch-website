She looked up and shook her head.  \"It belongs to somebody else. If it fixes a libido attachment on you, you're actually robbing its owner. They can't love many people at once.\"  She snorted, but installed the thing in its cage.  \"Anne--\" Norris hesitated, hating to approach the subject. \"Do you--want one--for yourself? I can sign an unclaimed one over to you to keep in the house. It won't cost us anything.\"  Slowly she shook her head, and her pale eyes went moody and luminous. \"I'm going to have one of my own,\" she said.  He stood in the back of the truck, staring down at her. \"Do you realize what--\"  \"I know what I'm saying. We're class-C on account of heart-trouble in both our families. Well, I don't care, Terry. I'm not going to waste a heart over one of these pathetic little artificial animals. We're going to have a baby.\"  \"You know what they'd do to us?\"  \"If they catch us, yes--compulsory divorce, sterilization. But they won't catch us. I'll have it at home, Terry. Not even a doctor. We'll hide it.\"  \"I won't let you do such a thing.\"  She faced him angrily. \"Oh, this whole rotten _world_!\" she choked. Suddenly she turned and fled out of the building. She was sobbing.         *       *       *       *       *  Norris climbed slowly down from the truck and wandered on into the house. She was not in the kitchen nor the living room. The bedroom door was locked. He shrugged and went to sit on the sofa. The television set was on, and a newscast was coming from a local station.  \"... we were unable to get shots of the body,\" the announcer was saying. \"But here is a view of the Georges residence. I'll switch you to our mobile unit in Sherman II, James Duncan reporting.\"  Norris frowned with bewilderment as the scene shifted to a two-story plasticoid house among the elm trees. It was after dark, but the mobile unit's powerful floodlights made daylight of the house and its yard and the police 'copters sitting in a side lot. An ambulance was parked in the street. A new voice came on the audio.  \"This is James Duncan, ladies and gentlemen, speaking to you from our mobile unit in front of the late Doctor Hiram Georges' residence just west of Sherman II. We are waiting for the stretcher to be brought out, and Police Chief Erskine Miler is standing here beside me to give us a word about the case. Doctor Georges' death has shocked the community deeply. Most of you local listeners have known him for many years--some of you have depended upon his services as a family physician. He was a man well known, well loved. But now let's listen to Chief Miler.\"  Norris sat breathing quickly. There could scarcely be two Doctor Georges in the community, but only this morning....  A growling drawl came from the audio. \"This's Chief Miler speaking, folks. I just want to say that if any of you know the whereabouts of a Mrs. Sarah Glubbes, call me immediately. She's wanted for questioning.\"  \"Thank you, Chief. This is James Duncan again. I'll review the facts for you briefly again, ladies and gentlemen. At seven o'clock, less than an hour ago, a woman--allegedly Mrs. Glubbes--burst into Doctor Georges' dining room while the family was at dinner. She was brandishing a pistol and screaming, 'You stole my baby! You gave me the wrong baby! Where's my baby?'  \"When the doctor assured her that there was no other baby, she fired, shattering his salad plate. Glancing off it, the bullet pierced his heart. The woman fled. A peculiar feature of the case is that Mrs. Glubbes, the alleged intruder, _has no baby_. Just a minute--just a minute--here comes the stretcher now.\"  Norris turned the set off and went to call the police. He told them what he knew and promised to make himself available for questioning if it became necessary. When he turned from the phone, Anne was standing in the bedroom doorway. She might have been crying a little, but she concealed it well.  \"What was all that?\" she asked.  \"Woman killed a man. I happened to know the motive.\"  \"What was it?\"  \"Neutroid trouble.\"  \"You meet up with a lot of unpleasantness in this business, don't you?\"  \"Lot of unpleasant emotions tangled up in it,\" he admitted.  \"I know. Well, supper's been keeping hot for two hours. Shall we eat?\"         *       *       *       *       *  They went to bed at midnight, but it was after one when he became certain that his wife was asleep. He lay in darkness for a time, listening to her even breathing. Then he cautiously eased himself out of bed and tiptoed quietly through the door, carrying his shoes and trousers. He put them on in the kitchen and stole silently out to the kennels. A half moon hung low in a misty sky, and the wind was chilly out of the north.  He went into the neutroid room and flicked a switch. A few sleepy chatters greeted the light.  One at a time, he awoke twenty-three of the older doll-things and carried them to a large glass-walled compartment. These were the long-time residents; they knew him well, and they came with him willingly--like children after the Piper of Hamlin. When he had gotten them in the glass chamber, he sealed the door and turned on the gas. The conveyor would automatically carry them on to the incinerator.  Now he had enough cages for the Bermuda-K-99s.  He hurriedly quit the kennels and went to sit on the back steps. His eyes were burning, but the thought of tears made him sicker. It was like an assassin crying while he stabbed his victim. It was more honest just to retch.  When he tiptoed back inside, he got as far as the hall. Then he saw Anne's small figure framed in the bedroom window, silhouetted against the moonlit yard. She had slipped into her negligee and was sitting on the narrow windowstool, staring silently out at the dull red tongue of exhaust gases from the crematory's chimney.  Norris backed away. He went to the parlor and lay down on the couch.  After a while he heard her come into the room. She paused in the center of the rug, a fragile mist in the darkness. He turned his face away and waited for the rasping accusation. But soon she came to sit on the edge of the sofa. She said nothing. Her hand crept out and touched his cheek lightly. He felt her cool finger-tips trace a soft line up his temple.  \"It's all right, Terry,\" she whispered.  He kept his face averted. Her fingers traced a last stroke. Then she padded quietly back to the bedroom. He lay awake until dawn, knowing that it would never be all right, neither the creating nor the killing, until he--and the whole world--completely lost sanity. And then everything would be all right, only it still wouldn't make sense.         *       *       *       *       *  Anne was asleep when he left the house. The night mist had gathered into clouds that made a gloomy morning of it. He drove on out in the kennel-truck, meaning to get the rest of the Bermuda-K-99s so that he could begin his testing.  Still he felt the night's guilt, like a sticky dew that refused to depart with morning. Why should he have to kill the things? The answer was obvious. Society manufactured them because killing them was permissible. Human babies could not be disposed of when the market became glutted. The neutroids offered solace to childless women, kept them satisfied with a restricted birth rate. And why a restricted birth rate? Because by keeping the population at five billions, the Federation could insure a decent living standard for everybody.  Where there was giving, Norris thought glumly, there was also taking away. Man had always deluded himself by thinking that he \"created,\" but he created nothing. He thought that he had created--with his medical science and his end to wars--a longer life for the individual. But he found that he had only taken the lives of the unborn and added them to the years of the aged. Man now had a life expectancy of eighty, except that he had damn little chance of being born to enjoy it.  A neutroid filled the cradle in his stead. A neutroid that never ate as much, or grew up to be unemployed. A neutroid could be killed if things got tough, but could still satisfy a woman's craving to mother something small.  Norris gave up thinking about it. Eventually he would have to adjust to it. He was already adjusted to a world that loved the artificial mutants as children. He had been brought up in it. Emotion came in conflict with the grim necessities of his job. Somehow he would have to love them in the parlor and kill them in the kennel. It was only a matter of adjustment.         *       *       *       *       *  At noon, he brought back another dozen K-99s and installed them in his cages. There had been two highly reluctant mothers, but he skipped them and left the seizure to the local authorities. Yates had already brought in the three from yesterday.  \"No more scratches?\" Anne asked him while they ate lunch. They did not speak of the night's mass-disposal.  Norris smiled mechanically. \"I learned my lesson yesterday. If they bare their fangs, I get out without another word. Funny thing though--I've got a feeling one mother pulled a fast one.\"  \"What happened?\"  \"Well, I told her what I wanted and why. She didn't like it, but she let me in. I started out with her newt, but she wanted a receipt. So I gave her one; took the serial number off my checklist. She looked at it and said, 'Why, that's not Chichi's number!' I looked at the newt's foot, and sure enough it wasn't. I had to leave it. It was a K-99, but not even from Bermuda.\"  \"I thought they were all registered,\" Anne said.  \"They are. I told her she had the wrong neutroid, but she got mad. Went and got the sales receipt. It checked with her newt, and it was from O'Reilley's pet shop--right place, wrong number. I just don't get it.\"  \"Nothing to worry about, is it Terry?\"  He looked at her peculiarly. \"Ever think what might happen if someone started a black market in neutroids?\"  They finished the meal in silence. After lunch he went out again to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51656"],["title","Pick a Crime (#1)"],["body",". You'd be surprised at the number of conspiracies that take place in alleys!\"  Joe listened numbly to his voice as it came from one of the hundreds of machines on the walls, \"_Scream. Scream as loud as you can, and when the cops get here, tell 'em I tried to rape you._\" And then the girl's voice, \"_Sorry, buddy. Can't help--_\"  He waved his hand. \"Okay. Shut it off. I confess to conspiracy.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Hendricks rose from behind the desk, walked leisurely to where Joe was slouched in a chair. \"Give me your CPA ID.\"  Joe handed him the card with trembling fingers. He felt as if the world had collapsed beneath him. Conspiracy to commit a crime wasn't a crime. Anyone could conspire. And if the conspirators were prevented from committing a crime, then that meant the CPA had functioned properly once again. That meant the CPA had once again _prevented_ crime, and the CPA didn't punish crimes or attempted crimes, and it didn't attempt to prevent crimes _by_ punishment. If it did, that would be a violation of the New Civil Rights.  Hendricks crossed the room, deposited the card in a slot and punched a button. The machine hummed and a new card appeared.  When Hendricks handed him the new card, Joe saw that the words DANGEROUS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES were now in red and larger than before. And, in slightly smaller print, the ID card stated that the owner was a DCT First Class.  \"You've graduated,\" Hendricks said coldly. \"You guys never learn, do you? Now you're a DCT First Class instead of a Second Class. You know what that means?\"  Hendricks leaned closer until Joe could feel his breath on his face. \"That means your case history will be turned over to the newspapers. You'll be the hobby of thousands of amateur cops. You know how it works? It's like this. The Joneses are sitting around tomorrow night and they're bored. Then Mr. Jones says, 'Let's go watch this Joe Harper.' So they look up your record--amateur cops always keep records of First Classes in scrapbooks--and they see that you stop frequently at Walt's Tavern.  \"So they go there and they sit and drink and watch you, trying not to let you know they're watching you. They watch you all night, just hoping you'll do something exciting, like trying to kill someone, so they can be the first ones to yell '_Police!_' They'll watch you because it's exciting to be an amateur cop, and if they ever _did_ prevent you from committing a crime, they'd get a nice reward and they'd be famous.\"  \"Lay off,\" Joe said. \"I got a headache. That girl--\"  Hendricks leaned even closer and glared. \"You listen, Joe. This is interesting. You see, it doesn't stop with Mr. and Mrs. Jones. There's thousands of people like them. Years ago, they got their kicks from reading about guys like you, but these days things are dull because it's rare when anyone commits a crime. So every time you walk down the street, there'll be at least a dozen of 'em following you, and no matter where you go, you can bet there'll be some of 'em sitting next to you, standing next to you.  \"During the day, they'll take your picture with their spy cameras that look like buttons on their coats. At night, they'll peep at you through your keyhole. Your neighbors across the street will watch you through binoculars and--\"  \"Lay off!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Joe squirmed in the chair. He'd been lectured by Hendricks before and it was always an unpleasant experience. The huge man was like a talking machine once he got started, a machine that couldn't be stopped.  \"And the kids are the worst,\" Hendricks continued. \"They have Junior CPA clubs. They keep records of hoodlums like you in little cardboard boxes. They'll stare at you on the street and stare at you through restaurant windows while you're eating meals. They'll follow you in public rest rooms and watch you out of the corners of their eyes while they wash their little hands, and almost every day when you look back, you'll see a dozen freckle-faced little boys following you half a block behind, giggling and gaping at you. They'll follow you until the day you die, because you're a freak!\"  Joe couldn't stand the breath in his face any longer. He rose and paced the floor.  \"And it doesn't end _there_, Joe. It goes on and on. You'll be the object of every do-gooder and parlor psychologist. Strangers will stop you on the street and say, 'I'd like to help you, friend.' Then they'll ask you queer questions like, 'Did your father reject you when you were a child?' 'Do you like girls?' 'How does it feel to be a DCT First Class?' And then there'll be the strangers who hate DCTs. They'll stop you on the street and insult you, call you names, spit on you and--\"  \"Okay, goddam it! _Stop it!_\"  Hendricks stopped, wiped the sweat from his face with a handkerchief and lit a cigarette.  \"I'm doing you a favor, Joe. I'm trying to explain something you're too dumb to realize by yourself. We've taught everyone to hate crime and criminals ... to _hate_ them as nothing has ever been hated before. Today a criminal is a freak, an alien. Your life will be a living hell if you don't leave New York. You should go to some small town where there aren't many people, or be a hermit, or go to Iceland or--\"  Joe eyed the huge man suspiciously. \"_Favor_, did you say? The day you do _me_ a favor--\"  Hendricks shrugged his shoulders negligently. \"Not entirely a favor. I want to get rid of you. Usually I come up here and sit around and read books. But guys like you are a nuisance and take up my time.\"  \"I couldn't leave if I wanted to,\" Joe said. \"I'm flat broke. Thanks to your CPA system, a DCT can't get a decent job.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Hendricks reached into a pocket, withdrew several bills and extended them. \"I'll loan you some money. You can sign an IOU and pay me back a little at a time.\"  Joe waved the money away. \"Listen, why don't you do me a favor? Why don't you frame me? If I'm such a nuisance, pin a crime on me--any crime.\"  \"Can't do it. Convicting a man of a crime he didn't commit is a violation of Civil Rights and a crime in itself.\"  \"Umm.\"  \"Why don't you take the free psycho treatment? A man doesn't _have_ to be a DCT. With the free treatment, psychologists can remove all your criminal tendencies and--\"  \"Go to those _head-shrinkers_?\"  Hendricks shrugged again. \"Have it your way.\"  Joe laughed. \"If your damned CPA is so all-powerful, why can't you _make_ me go?\"  \"Violation of Civil Rights.\"  \"Damn it, there must be some way you can help me! We both want the same thing. We both want to see me convicted of a crime.\"  \"How can I help you without committing a crime myself?\" Hendricks walked to his desk, opened a drawer and removed a small black book. \"See this? It contains names and addresses of all the people in New York who aren't properly protected. Every week we find people who aren't protected properly--blind spots in our protection devices. As soon as we find them, we take steps to install anti-robbery devices, but this is a big city and sometimes it takes days to get the work done.  \"In the meantime, any one of these people could be robbed. But what can I do? I can't hold this book in front of your nose and say, 'Here, Joe, pick a name and go out and rob him.'\" He laughed nervously. \"If I did that, I'd be committing a crime myself!\"  He placed the book on the desk top, took a handkerchief from a pocket again and wiped sweat from his face. \"Excuse me a minute. I'm dying of thirst. There's a water cooler in the next room.\"  Joe stared at the door to the adjoining office as it closed behind the big man. Hendricks was--unbelievably--offering him a victim, offering him a crime!  Almost running to the desk, Joe opened the book, selected a name and address and memorized it: _John Gralewski, Apt. 204, 2141 Orange St._  When Hendricks came back, Joe said, \"Thanks.\"  \"Huh? Thanks for what? I didn't do anything.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When Joe reached the street, he hurried toward the nearest subway. As a child, he had been frightened of the dark. As a man, he wasn't afraid of the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel ill at ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by his own imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug the feeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for him to make a mistake.  Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went. Twenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns, alleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited for someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked up was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.  If the words \"Let's see a movie\" were received in the Brain, they were discarded. But if the words \"Let's roll this guy\" were received, the message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene in two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hidden microphones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messages to the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun in someone's pocket at forty yards.  Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocery store was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a place of business for years.  Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors--devices placed in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity of heat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research had made poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containing poison, and while an ant-poison might kill ants, no concentrated amount of it would kill a human.  The FBI had always been a powerful organization, but under the supervision of the CPA, it was a scientific colossus and to think of kidnapping someone or to contemplate the use of narcotics was pointless.
