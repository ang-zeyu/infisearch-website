Look over at that bank.”  Little Joe Otter looked over at the bank. He stared and stared, but he didn't see anything unusual. It looked just as it always did. He told Jerry Muskrat so.  “Then it must be my eyes,” sighed Jerry. “It certainly must be my eyes. It looks to me as if the water does not come as high up on the bank as it did yesterday.”  Little Joe Otter looked again and his eyes opened wide. “You are right, Jerry Muskrat!” he cried. “There's nothing the matter with your eyes. The water is as low as it ever gets, even in the very middle of summer. What can it mean?”  “I don't know,” replied Jerry Muskrat. “It is queer! It certainly is very queer! Let's go ask Grandfather Frog. You know he is very old and very wise, so perhaps he can tell us what it means.”  Splash! Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter dived into the Smiling Pool and started a race to see who could reach Grandfather Frog first. He was sitting among the bulrushes on the edge of the Smiling Pool, for the lily-pads were not yet big enough for him to sit on comfortably.  “Oh, Grandfather Frog, what's the matter with the Smiling Pool?” they shouted, as they came up quite out of breath.  “Chugarum! There's nothing the matter with the Smiling Pool; it's the best place in all the world,” replied Grandfather Frog gruffly.  “But there is something the matter,” insisted Jerry Muskrat, and then he told what he had discovered.  “I don't believe it,” said Grandfather Frog. “I never heard of such a thing in the springtime.”    CHAPTER VIII: Grandfather Frog Watches His Toes  Grandfather Frog sat among the bulrushes on the edge of the Smiling Pool. Over his head Mr. Redwing was singing as if his heart would burst with the very joy of springtime.   “Tra-la-la-lee, see me!  See me!   Happy am I as I can be!   Happy am I the whole day long   And so I sing my gladsome song.”  Of course Mr. Redwing was happy. Why shouldn't he be? Here it was the beautiful springtime, the gladdest time of all the year, the time when happiness creeps into everybody's heart. Grandfather Frog listened. He nodded his head. “Chugarum! I'm happy, too,” said Grandfather Frog. But even as he said it, a little worried look crept into his big goggly eyes and then down to the corners of his big mouth, which had been stretched in a smile. Little by little the smile grew smaller and smaller, until there wasn't any smile. No, Sir, there wasn't any smile. Instead of looking happy, as he said he felt, Grandfather Frog actually looked unhappy.  The fact is he couldn't forget what Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter had told him--that there was something the matter with the Smiling Pool. He didn't believe it, not a word of it. At least he tried to make himself think that he didn't believe it. They had said that the water in the Smiling Pool was growing lower and lower, just as it did in the middle of summer, in the very hottest weather. Now Grandfather Frog is very old and very wise, and he had never heard of such a thing happening in the springtime. So he wouldn't believe it now. And yet--and yet Grandfather Frog had an uncomfortable feeling that something was wrong. Ha! he knew now what it was! He had been sitting up to his middle in water, and now he was sitting with only his toes in the water, and he couldn't remember having changed his position!  “Of course, I moved without thinking what I was doing,” muttered Grandfather Frog, but still the worried look didn't leave his face. You see he just couldn't make himself believe what he wanted to believe, try as he would.  “Chugarum! I know what I'll do; I'll watch my toes!” exclaimed Grandfather Frog.  So Grandfather Frog waded out into the water until it covered his feet, and then he sat down and began to watch his toes. Mr. Redwing looked down and saw him, and Grandfather Frog looked so funny gazing at his own toes that Mr. Redwing stopped singing long enough to ask: “What are you doing, Grandfather Frog?”  “Watching my toes,” replied Grandfather Frog gruffly.  “Watching your toes! Ho, ho, ho! Watching your toes! Who ever heard of such a thing? Are you afraid that they will run away, Grandfather Frog?”  shouted Mr. Redwing.  Grandfather Frog didn't answer. He kept right on watching his toes. Mr. Redwing flew away to tell everybody he met how Grandfather Frog had become foolish and was watching his toes. The sun shone down warm and bright, and pretty soon Grandfather Frog's big goggly eyes began to blink. Then his head began to nod, and then--why, then Grandfather Frog fell fast asleep.  By and by Grandfather Frog awoke with a start. He looked down at his toes. They were not in the water at all! Indeed, the water was a good long jump away.  “Chugarum! There is something wrong with the Smiling Pool!” cried Grandfather Frog, as he made a long jump into the water and started to swim out to the Big Rock.    CHAPTER IX: The Laughing Brook Stops Laughing  There was something wrong. Grandfather Frog knew it the very minute he got up that morning. At first he couldn't think what it was. He sat with just his head out of water and blinked his great goggly eyes, as he tried to think what it was that was wrong. Suddenly Grandfather Frog realized how still it was. It was a different kind of stillness from anything he could ever remember. He missed something, and he couldn't think what it was. It wasn't the song of Mr. Redwing. There were many times when he didn't hear that. It was--Grand-father Frog gave a startled jump out on to the shore. “Chugarum! It's the Laughing Brook! The Laughing Brook has stopped laughing!” cried Grandfather Frog.  Could it be? Who ever heard of such a thing, excepting when Jack Frost bound the Laughing Brook with hard black ice? Why, in the spring and in the summer and in the fall the Laughing Brook had laughed--such a merry, happy laugh--ever since Grandfather Frog could remember, and you know he can remember way back in the long ago, for he is very old and very wise. Never once in all that time had the Laughing Brook failed to laugh. It couldn't be true now! Grandfather Frog put a hand behind one ear and listened and listened, but not a sound could he hear.  “Chugarum! It must be me,” said Grandfather Frog. “It must be that I am growing old and deaf. I'll go over and ask Jerry Muskrat.”  So Grandfather Frog dove into the water and swam out to the middle of the Smiling Pool, on his way to Jerry Muskrat's house. It was then that he first fully realized the truth of what Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter had told him the day before--that there was something very, very wrong with the Smiling Pool. He stopped swimming to look around, and it seemed as if his great goggly eyes would pop right out of his head. Yes, Sir, it seemed as if those great goggly eyes certainly would pop right out of Grandfather Frog's head. The Smiling Pool had grown so small that there wasn't enough of it left to smile!  “Where are you going, Grandfather Frog?” asked a voice over his head.  Grandfather Frog looked up. Looking down on him from over the edge of the Big Rock was Jerry Muskrat. The edge of the Big Rock was twice as high above the water as Grandfather Frog had ever seen it before.  “I--I--was going to swim over to your house to see you,” replied Grandfather Frog.  “It's of no use,” replied Jerry, “because I'm not there. Besides, you couldn't swim there, anyway.”  “Why not?” demanded Grandfather Frog in great surprise.  “Because it isn't in the water any longer; it's way up on dry land,”  said Jerry Muskrat in the most mournful voice.  “What's that you say?” cried Grandfather Frog, as if he couldn't believe his own ears.  “It's just as true as that I'm sitting here,” replied Jerry sadly.  “Listen, Jerry Muskrat, and tell me truly; is the Laughing Brook laughing?” cried Grandfather Frog sharply.  “No,” replied Jerry, “the Laughing Brook has stopped laughing, and the Smiling Pool has stopped smiling, and I think the world is upside down.”    CHAPTER X: Why The World Seemed Upside Down To Jerry Muskrat  Jerry Muskrat sat on the Big Rock in the Smiling Pool, which smiled no longer, and held his head in both hands, for his head ached. He had thought and thought and thought, until it seemed to him that his head would split; and with all his thinking, he didn't understand things any more now than he had in the beginning. You see, Jerry Muskrat's little world was topsy-turvy. Yes, Sir, Jerry's world was upside down! Anyway, it seemed so to him, and he couldn't understand it at all.  The Smiling Pool, the Laughing Brook, and the Green Meadows are Jerry Muskrat's little world. Now, as he sat on the Big Rock and looked about him, the Green Meadows were as lovely as ever. He could see no change in them. But the Laughing Brook had stopped laughing, and the Smiling Pool had stopped smiling. The truth is there wasn't enough of the Laughing Brook left to laugh, and there wasn't enough of the Smiling Pool left to smile.  It was dreadful! Jerry looked over to his house, of which he had once been so proud. He had built it with the doorway under water. He had felt perfectly safe there, because no one excepting Billy Mink or Little Joe Otter, who can swim under water, could reach him. Now the Smiling Pool had grown so small that Jerry's house wasn't in the water at all. Anybody who wanted to could get into it. There was the doorway plainly to be seen. Worse still, there was the secret entrance to the long tunnel leading to his castle under the roots of the Big Hickory-tree. That had been Jerry's most secret secret, and now there it was for all the world to see. And there were all the wonderful caves and holes and hiding-places under the bank which had been known only to Jerry Muskrat and Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter, because the openings had always been under water. Now anybody could find them, for they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51101"],["title","Nice Girl with 5 Husbands (#1)"],["body","colorful, costly-looking, and mostly Egyptian and Cretan in inspiration. Some of them would have been quite immodest, even compared to Miss Tosker's famous playsuits, except that the wearers didn't seem to feel so.  \"There goes the middle-morning rocket!\" one of them eagerly cried.  Tom looked up with the rest, but his eyes caught the dazzling sun. However, he heard a faint roaring that quickly sank in volume and pitch, and it reminded him that the Army had a rocket testing range in this area. He had little interest in science, but he hadn't known they were on a daily schedule.  \"Do you suppose it's off the track?\" he asked anxiously.  \"Not a chance,\" someone told him--the beard, he thought. The assurance of the tones gave him a possible solution. Scientists came from all over the world these days and might have all sorts of advanced ideas. This could be a group working at a nearby atomic project and leading its peculiar private life on the side.         *       *       *       *       *  As they eddied toward the house he heard Lois remind someone, \"But you finally did declare it a holiday,\" and a husband who looked like a gay pharaoh respond, \"I had another see at the mood charts and I found a subtle surge I'd missed.\"  Meanwhile the beard (a black one) had taken Tom in charge. Tom wasn't sure of his name, but he had a tan skin, a green sarong, and a fiercely jovial expression. \"The swimming pool's around there, the landing spot's on the other side,\" he began, then noticed Tom gazing at the sooty roof. \"Sun power cells,\" he explained proudly. \"They store all the current we need.\"  Tom felt his idea confirmed. \"Wonder you don't use atomic power,\" he observed lightly.  The beard nodded. \"We've been asked that. Matter of esthetics. Why waste sunlight or use hard radiations needlessly? Of course, you might feel differently. What's your group, did you say?\"  \"Tosker-Brown,\" Tom told him, adding when the beard frowned, \"the Fellowship people, you know.\"  \"I don't,\" the beard confessed. \"Where are you located?\"  Tom briefly described the ranch house and cabins at the other end of the valley.  \"Comic, I can't place it.\" The beard shrugged. \"Here come the children.\"  A dozen naked youngsters raced around the ranch house, followed by a woman in a vaguely African dress open down the sides.  \"Yours?\" Tom asked.  \"Ours,\" the beard answered.  \"C'est un homme!\"  \"Regardez des vêtements!\"  \"No need to practice, kids; this is a holiday,\" the beard told them. \"Tom, Helen,\" he said, introducing the woman with the air-conditioned garment. \"Her turn today to companion die Kinder.\"  One of the latter rapped on the beard's knee. \"May we show the stranger our things?\" Instantly the others joined in pleading. The beard shot an inquiring glance at Tom, who nodded. A moment later the small troupe was hurrying him toward a spacious lean-to at the end of the ranch house. It was chuckful of strange toys, rocks and plants, small animals in cages and out, and the oddest model airplanes, or submarines. But Tom was given no time to look at any one thing for long.  \"See my crystals? I grew them.\"  \"Smell my mutated gardenias. Tell now, isn't there a difference?\" There didn't seem to be, but he nodded.  \"Look at my squabbits.\" This referred to some long-eared white squirrels nibbling carrots and nuts.  \"Here's my newest model spaceship, a DS-57-B. Notice the detail.\" The oldest boy shoved one of the submarine affairs in his face.         *       *       *       *       *  Tom felt like a figure that is being tugged about in a rococo painting by wide pink ribbons in the chubby hands of naked cherubs. Except that these cherubs were slim and tanned, fantastically energetic, and apparently of depressingly high IQ. (What these scientists did to children!) He missed Lois and was grateful for the single little girl solemnly skipping rope in a corner and paying no attention to him.  The odd lingo she repeated stuck in his mind: \"Gik-lo, I-o, Rik-o, Gis-so. Gik-lo, I-o....\"  Suddenly the air was filled with soft chimes. \"Lunch,\" the children shouted and ran away.  Tom followed at a soberer pace along the wall of the ranch house. He glanced in the huge windows, curious about the living and sleeping arrangements of the Wolvers, but the panes were strangely darkened. Then he entered the wide doorway through which the children had scampered and his curiosity turned to wonder.  A resilient green floor that wasn't flat, but sloped up toward the white of the far wall like a breaking wave. Chairs like giants' hands tenderly cupped. Little tables growing like mushrooms and broad-leafed plants out of the green floor. A vast picture window showing the red rocks.  Yet it was the wood-paneled walls that electrified his artistic interest. They blossomed with fruits and flowers, deep and poignantly carved in several styles. He had never seen such work.  He became aware of a silence and realized that his hosts and hostesses were smiling at him from around a long table. Moved by a sudden humility, he knelt and unlaced his sneakers and added them to the pile of sandals and digitals by the door. As he rose, a soft and comic piping started and he realized that beyond the table the children were lined up, solemnly puffing at little wooden flutes and recorders. He saw the empty chair at the table and went toward it, conscious for the moment of nothing but his dusty feet.  He was disappointed that Lois wasn't sitting next to him, but the food reminded him that he was hungry. There was a charming little steak, striped black and brown with perfection, and all sorts of vegetables and fruits, one or two of which he didn't recognize.  \"Flown from Africa,\" someone explained to him.  These sly scientists, he thought, living behind their security curtain in the most improbable world!  When they were sitting with coffee and wine, and the children had finished their concert and were busy at another table, he asked, \"How do you manage all this?\"  Jock, the gay pharaoh, shrugged. \"It's not difficult.\"  Rachel, the slim Negro, chuckled in her throat. \"We're just people, Tom.\"  He tried to phrase his question without mentioning money. \"What do you all do?\"  \"Jock's a uranium miner,\" Larry (the beard) answered, briskly taking over. \"Rachel's an algae farmer. I'm a rocket pilot. Lois--\"         *       *       *       *       *  Although pleased at this final confirmation of his guess, Tom couldn't help feeling a surge of uneasiness. \"Sure you should be telling me these things?\"  Larry laughed. \"Why not? Lois and Jokichi have been exchange-workers in China the last six months.\"  \"Mostly digging ditches,\" Jokichi put in with a smile.  \"--and Sasha's in an assembly plant. Helen's a psychiatrist. Oh, we just do ordinary things. Now we're on grand vacation.\"  \"Grand vacation?\"  \"When all of us have a vacation together,\" Larry explained. \"What do you do?\"  \"I'm an artist,\" Tom said, taking out a cigaret.  \"But what else?\" Larry asked.  Tom felt an angry embarrassment. \"Just an artist,\" he mumbled, cigaret in mouth, digging in his pockets for a match.  \"Hold on,\" said Joyce beside him and pointed a silver pencil at the tip of the cigaret. He felt a faint thrill in his lips and then started back, coughing. The cigaret was lighted.  \"Please mutate my poppy seeds, Mommy.\" A little girl had darted to Joyce from the children's table.  \"You're a very dirty little girl,\" Joyce told her without reproof. \"Hold them out.\" She briefly directed the silver pencil at the clay pellets on the grimy little palm. The little girl shivered delightedly. \"I love ultrasonics, they feel so funny.\" She scampered off.  Tom cleared his throat. \"I must say I'm tremendously impressed with the wood carvings. I'd like to photograph them. Oh, Lord!\"  \"What's the matter?\" Rachel asked.  \"I lost my camera somewhere.\"  \"Camera?\" Jokichi showed interest. \"You mean one for stills?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What kind?\"  \"A Leica,\" Tom told him.  Jokichi seemed impressed. \"That is interesting. I've never seen one of those old ones.\"  \"Tom's a button man,\" Lois remarked by way of explanation, apparently. \"Was the camera in a brown case? You dropped it where we met. We can get it later.\"  \"Good, I'd really like to take those pictures,\" Tom said. \"Incidentally, who did the carvings?\"  \"We did,\" Jock said. \"Together.\"  Tom was grateful that the scamper of the children out of the room saved him from having to reply. He couldn't think of anything but a grunt of astonishment.  The conversation split into a group of chats about something called a psych machine, trips to Russia, the planet Mars, and several artists Tom had never heard of. He wanted to talk to Lois, but she was one of the group gabbling about Mars like children. He felt suddenly uneasy and out of things, and neither Rachel's deprecating remarks about her section of the wood carvings nor Joyce's interesting smiles helped much. He was glad when they all began to get up. He wandered outside and made his way to the children's lean-to, feeling very depressed.         *       *       *       *       *  Once again he was the center of a friendly naked cluster, except for the same solemn-faced little girl skipping rope. A rather malicious but not very hopeful whim prompted him to ask the youngest, \"What's one and one?\"  \"Ten,\" the shaver answered glibly. Tom felt pleased.  \"It could also be two,\" the oldest boy remarked.  \"I'll say,\" Tom agreed. \"What's the population of the world?\"  \"About seven hundred million.\"  Tom nodded noncommittally and, grabbing at the first long word that he thought of, turned to the eldest girl. \"What's poliomyelitis?\"  \"Never heard of it,\" she said.  The solemn little girl kept droning the same ridiculous chant: \"Gik-lo, I-o, Rik-o, Gis-so.\"  His ego eased, Tom went outside and there was Lois.  \"What's the matter?\" she asked.  \"Nothing,\" he said.  She took his hand. \"Have we pushed ourselves at you too much? Has our jabbering bothered you? We're a loud-mouthed family"]]]
