It is indeed expected that the princes shall marry in their own family, the Achaemenidae; but the Persians have an unbounded predilection for everything foreign.  Enchanted with the beauty of your granddaughter, and rendered indulgent by their partiality for Bartja, they would easily forgive this breach of an ancient custom.  Indeed, if the king gives his approval, no objection on the part of his subjects can be entertained. The history of Iran too offers a sufficient number of examples, in which even slaves became the mothers of kings.  The queen mother, whose position, in the eyes of the people, is nearly as high as that of the monarch himself, will do nothing to thwart the happiness of her youngest and favorite son.  When she sees that he will not give up Sappho,--that his smiling face, in which she adores the image of her great husband Cyrus, becomes clouded, I verily believe she would be ready to sanction his taking even a Scythian woman to wife, if it could restore him to cheerfulness.  Neither will Cambyses himself refuse his consent if his mother press the point at a right moment.\"  \"In that case every difficulty is set aside,\" cried Rhodopis joyfully.  \"It is not the marriage itself, but the time that must follow, which causes me uneasiness,\" answered Croesus.  \"Do you think then that Bartja .  .  . ?\"  \"From him I fear nothing.  He has a pure heart, and has been so long proof against love, that now he has once yielded, he will love long and ardently.\"  \"What then do you fear?\"  \"You must remember that, though the charming wife of their favorite will be warmly received by all his friends of his own sex, there are thousands of idle women in the harems of the Persian nobles, who will endeavor, by every artifice and intrigue in their power, to injure the newly-risen star; and whose greatest joy it will be to ruin such an inexperienced child and make her unhappy.\"  \"You have a very bad opinion of the Persian women.\"  \"They are but women, and will naturally envy her, who has gained the husband they all desired either for themselves or for their daughters. In their monotonous life, devoid of occupation, envy easily becomes hatred, and the gratification of these evil passions is the only compensation which the poor creatures can obtain for the total absence of love and loss of freedom.  I repeat, the more beautiful Sappho is, the more malicious they will feel towards her, and, even if Bartja should love her so fervently as not to take a second wife for two or three years, she will still have such heavy hours to encounter, that I really do not know whether I dare congratulate you on her apparently brilliant future.\"  \"That is quite my own feeling.  A simple Greek would be more welcome to me than this son of a mighty monarch.\"  In this moment Knakias brought Bartja into the room.  He went to Rhodopis at once, besought her not to refuse him the hand of her granddaughter, spoke of his ardent love, and assured her that his happiness would be doubled, if she would consent to accompany them to Persia.  Then turning to Croesus, he seized his hand and entreated forgiveness for having so long concealed his great happiness from one who had been like a father to him, at the same time begging him to second his suit with Rhodopis.  The old man listened to the youth's passionate language with a smile, and said: \"Ah, Bartja, how often have I warned thee against love!  It is a scorching fire.\"  \"But its flame is bright and beautiful.\"  \"It causes pain.\"  \"But such pain is sweet.\"  \"It leads the mind astray.\"  \"But it strengthens the heart.\"  \"Oh, this love!\"  cried Rhodopis.  \"Inspired by Eros, the boy speaks as if he had been all his life studying under an Attic orator!\"  \"And yet,\" answered Croesus, \"these lovers are the most unteachable of pupils.  Convince them as clearly as you will, that their passion is only another word for poison, fire, folly, death, they still cry, 'Tis sweet,' and will not be hindered in their course.\"  As he was speaking Sappho came in.  A white festal robe, with wide sleeves, and borders of purple embroidery, fell in graceful folds round her delicate figure, and was confined at the waist by a golden girdle. Her hair was adorned with fresh roses, and on her bosom lay her lover's first gift, the flashing diamond star.  She came up modestly and gracefully, and made a low obeisance to the aged Croesus.  His eyes rested long on the maidenly and lovely countenance, and the longer he gazed the kindlier became his gaze.  For a moment he seemed to grow young again in the visions conjured up by memory, and involuntarily he went up to the young girl, kissed her affectionately on the forehead, and, taking her by the hand, led her to Bartja with the words: \"Take her, thy wife she must be, if the entire race of the Achaemenidae were to conspire against us!\"  \"Have I no voice in the matter?\"  said Rhodopis, smiling through her tears.  On hearing these words, Bartja and Sappho each took one of her hands, and gazed entreatingly into her face.  She rose to her full stature, and like a prophetess exclaimed: \"Eros, who brought you to each other, Zeus and Apollo defend and protect you.  I see you now like two fair roses on one stem, loving and happy in the spring of life.  What summer, autumn and winter may have in store for you, lies hidden with the gods.  May the shades of thy departed parents, Sappho, smile approvingly when these tidings of their child shall reach them in the nether world.\"                 .................................  Three days later a densely packed crowd was once more surging round the Sais landing-place.  This time they had assembled to bid a last farewell to their king's daughter, and in this hour the people gave clear tokens that, in spite of all the efforts of the priestly caste, their hearts remained loyal to their monarch and his house.  For when Amasis and Ladice embraced Nitetis for the last time with tears--when Tachot, in presence of all the inhabitants of Sais, following her sister down the broad flight of steps that led to the river, threw her arms round her neck once more and burst into sobs--when at last the wind filled the sails of the royal boat and bore the princess, destined to be the great king's bride, from their sight, few eyes among that vast crowd remained dry.  The priests alone looked on at this sad scene with unmoved gravity and coldness; but when the south wind at last bore away the strangers who had robbed them of their princess, many a curse and execration followed from the Egyptians on the shore; Tachot alone stood weeping there and waving her veil to them.  For whom were these tears?  for the play-fellow of her youth, or for the handsome, beloved prince?  Amasis embraced his wife and daughter in the eyes of all his people; and held up his little grandson, Prince Necho, to their gaze, the sight eliciting cries of joy on all sides.  But Psamtik, the child's own father, stood by the while, tearless and motionless.  The king appeared not to observe him, until Neithotep approached, and leading him to his father, joined their hands and called down the blessing of the gods upon the royal house.  At this the Egyptians fell on their knees with uplifted hands.  Amasis clasped his son to his heart, and when the high-priest had concluded his prayer, the following colloquy between the latter and Amasis took place in low tones:  \"Let peace be between us for our own and Egypt's sake!\"  \"Hast thou received Nebenchari's letter?\"  \"A Samian pirate-vessel is in pursuit of Phanes' trireme.\"  \"Behold the child of thy predecessor Hophra, the rightful heiress of the Egyptian throne, departing unhindered to a distant land!\"  \"The works of the Greek temple now building in Memphis shall be discontinued.\"  \"May Isis grant us peace, and may prosperity and happiness increase in our land!\"                      ............................  The Greek colonists in Naukratis had prepared a feast to celebrate the departure of their protector's daughter.  Numerous animals had been slaughtered in sacrifice on the altars of the Greek divinities, and the Nile-boats were greeted with a loud cry of \"Ailinos\" on their arrival in the harbor.  A bridal wreath, composed of a hoop of gold wound round with scented violets, was presented to Nitetis by a troop of young girls in holiday dresses, the act of presentation being performed by Sappho, as the most beautiful among the maidens of Naukratis.  On accepting the gift Nitetis kissed her forehead in token of gratitude. The triremes were already waiting; she went on board, the rowers took their oars and began the Keleusma.       [The measure of the Keleusma was generally given by a flute-player,      the Trieraules.  AEschylus, Persians 403.  Laert. Diog. IV. 22.  In      the Frogs of Aristophanes the inhabitants of the marshes are made to      sing the Keleusma, v. 205.  The melody, to the measure of which the      Greek boatmen usually timed their strokes.]  Ailinos rang across the water from a thousand voices.  Bartja stood on the deck, and waved a last loving farewell to his betrothed; while Sappho prayed in silence to Aphrodite Euploia, the protectress of those who go down to the sea in ships.  A tear rolled down her cheek, but around her lips played a smile of love and hope, though her old slave Melitta, who accompanied her to carry her parasol, was weeping as if her heart would break.  On seeing, however, a few leaves fall from her darling's wreath, she forgot her tears for a moment and whispered softly: \"Yes, dear heart, it is easy to see that you are in love; when the leaves fall from a maiden's wreath, 'tis a sure sign that her heart has been touched by Eros.     CHAPTER XII.  Seven weeks after Nitetis had quitted her native country, a long train of equipages and horsemen was to be seen on the king's highway from the west to Babylon, moving steadily towards that gigantic city, whose towers might already be descried in the far"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5454"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 05 (#1)"],["body","feast among the Persians, and      called \"the perfect feast.\"  Herod. I. 133.  Birthdays were held in      much honor by the ancients, and more especially those of their      kings.  Both the great bilingual Egyptian tablets, which we possess      (the Rosetta stone, line 10 of hieroglyphic text; Gr. text, line 46.      and the edict of Canopus ed. Lepsius, hieroglyphic text 1. 3.  Gr.      text 1. 5.) mention the celebration of the birthday of one of the      Ptolemies; and even of Rameses II., so early as the 14th century B.      C.  we read: \"There was joy in heaven on his birthday.\"]  The entire body of officials and deputies streamed from the provinces up to the royal city, bringing presents to their ruler and good wishes; they came also to take part in the great sacrifices at which horses, stags, bulls and asses were slaughtered in thousands as offerings to the gods.  At this festival all the Persians received gifts, every man was allowed to ask a petition of the king, which seldom remained unfulfilled, and in every city the people were feasted at the royal expense.  Cambyses had commanded that his marriage with Nitetis should be celebrated eight days after the birthday, and all the magnates of the realms should be invited to the ceremony.  The streets of Babylon swarmed with strangers, the colossal palaces on both shores of the Euphrates were overfilled, and all the houses stood adorned in festal brightness.  The zeal thus displayed by his people, this vast throng of human beings, --representing and bringing around him, as it were, his entire kingdom, contributed not a little to raise the king's spirits.  His pride was gratified; and the only longing left in his heart had been stilled by Nitetis' love.  For the first time in his life he believed himself completely happy, and bestowed his gifts, not only from a sense of his duty as king of Persia, but because the act of giving was in itself a pleasure.  Megabyzus could not extol the deeds of Bartja and his friends too highly. Cambyses embraced the young warriors, gave them horses and gold chains, called them \"brothers\" and reminded Bartja, that he had promised to grant him a petition if he returned victorious.  At this Bartja cast down his eyes, not knowing at first in what form to begin his request, and the king answered laughing: \"Look, my friends; our young hero is blushing like a girl!  It seems I shall have to grant something important; so he had better wait until my birthday, and then, at supper, when the wine has given him courage, he shall whisper in my ear what he is now afraid to utter.  Ask much, Bartja, I am happy myself, and wish all my friends to be happy too.\"  Bartja only smiled in answer and went to his mother; for he had not yet opened his heart to her on the matter which lay so near it.  He was afraid of meeting with decided opposition; but Croesus had cleared the way far him by telling Kassandane so much in praise of Sappho, her virtues and her graces, her talents and skill, that Nitetis and Atossa maintained she must have given the old man a magic potion, and Kassandane, after a short resistance, yielded to her darling's entreaties.  \"A Greek woman the lawful wife of a Persian prince of the blood!\"  cried the blind woman.  \"Unheard of! What will Cambyses say?  How can we gain his consent?\"  \"On that matter you may be at ease, my mother,\" answered Bartja, \"I am as certain that my brother will give his consent, as I am that Sappho will prove an ornament and honor to our house.\"  \"Croesus has already told me much in favor of this maiden,\" answered Kassandane,\" and it pleases me that thou hast at last resolved to marry; but never-the-less this alliance does not seem suitable for a son of Cyrus.  And have you forgotten that the Achaemenidae; will probably refuse to recognize the child of a Greek mother as their future king, if Cambyses should remain childless?\"  \"Mother, I fear nothing; for my heart is not set upon the crown.  And indeed many a king of Persia has had a mother of far lower parentage than my Sappho.\"  I feel persuaded that when my relations see the precious jewel I have won on the Nile, not one of them will chide me.\"  \"The gods grant that Sappho may be equal to our Nitetis!\"  answered Kassandane, \"I love her as if she were my own child, and bless the day which brought her to Persia.  The warm light of her eyes has melted your brother's hard heart; her kindness and gentleness bring beauty into the night of my blind old age, and her sweet earnestness and gravity have changed your sister Atossa from an unruly child into a gentle maiden. But now call them, (they are playing in the garden), and we will tell them of the new friend they are to gain through you.\"  \"Pardon me, my mother,\" answered Bartja, \"but I must beg you not to tell my sister until we are sure of the king's consent.\"  \"You are right, my son.  We must conceal your wish, to save Nitetis and Atossa from a possible disappointment.  A bright hope unfulfilled is harder to bear than an unexpected sorrow.  So let us wait for your brother's consent, and may the gods give their blessing!\"  Early in the morning of the king's birthday the Persians offered their sacrifices on the shores of the Euphrates.  A huge altar of silver had been raised on an artificial hill.  On this a mighty fire had been kindled,  from which flames and sweet odors rose towards heaven.  White-robed magi fed the fire with pieces of daintily-cut sandal-wood, and stirred it with bundles of rods.  A cloth, the Paiti-dhana, was bound round the  heads of the priests, the ends of which covered the mouth, and thus preserved the pure fire from pollution by human breath.       [The Persians were ordered to hold this little square piece of cloth      before their mouths when they prayed.  It was from 2 to 7 fingers      broad.  Anquetil gives a drawing of it in his Zend-Avesia.  Strabo      speaks of the Paiti-dhana p. 733.  He says the ends of the cloth      used as a covering for the head hung down over the mouth.]  The victims had been slaughtered in a meadow near the river, the flesh cut into pieces, sprinkled with salt, and laid out on tender grasses, sprouts of clover, myrtle-blossoms, and laurel-leaves, that the beautiful daughter of Ormuzd, the patient, sacred Earth, might not be touched by aught that was dead or bleeding.  Oropastes, the chief Destur,--[Priest]--now drew near the fire and cast fresh butter into it.  The flames leapt up into the air and all the Persians fell on their knees and hid their faces, in the belief that the fire was now ascending to their great god and father.  The Magian then took a mortar, laid some leaves and stalks of the sacred herb Haomas within it, crushed them and poured the ruddy juice, the food of the gods, into the flames.  After this he raised his hands to heaven, and, while the other priests continually fed the flames into a wilder blaze by casting in fresh butter, sang a long prayer out of the sacred books.  In this prayer the blessing of the gods was called down on everything pure and good, but principally on the king and his entire realm.  The good spirits of light, life and truth; of all noble deeds; of the Earth, the universal giver; of the refreshing waters, the shining metals, the pastures, trees and innocent creatures, were praised: the evil spirits of darkness; of lying, the deceiver of mankind; of disease, death and sin; of the rigid cold; the desolating heat; of all odious dirt and vermin, were cursed, together with their father the malignant Ahriman.  At the end all present joined in singing the festival prayer: \"Purity and glory are sown for them that are pure and upright in heart.\"  The sacrificial ceremony was concluded with the king's prayer, and then Cambyses, arrayed in his richest robes, ascended a splendid chariot drawn by four snow-white Nicoean horses, and studded with topazes, cornelian and amber, and was conveyed to the great reception-hall, where the deputies and officers from the provinces awaited him.  As soon as the king and his retinue had departed, the priests selected, for themselves, the best pieces of the flesh which had been offered in sacrifice, and allowed the thronging crowd to take the rest.  The Persian divinities disdained sacrifices in the light of food, requiring only the souls of the slaughtered animals, and many a poor man, especially among the priests, subsisted on the flesh of the abundant royal sacrifices.  The prayer offered up by the Magian was a model for those of the Persian people.  No man was allowed to ask anything of the gods for himself alone.  Every pious soul was rather to implore blessings for his nation; for was not each only a part of the whole? and did not each man share in the blessings granted to the whole kingdom?  But especially they were commanded to pray for the king, in whom the realm was embodied and shadowed forth.  It was this beautiful surrender of self for the public weal, that had made the Persians great.  The doctrines of the Egyptian priesthood represented the Pharaohs as actual divinities, while the Persian monarchs were only called \"sons of the gods;\" yet the power of the latter was far more absolute and unfettered than that of the former; the reason for this being that the Persians had been wise enough to free themselves from priestly domination, while the Pharaohs, as we have seen, if not entirely under the dominion of the priestly caste, were yet under its influence in the most important matters.  The Egyptian intolerance of all strange religions was unknown in Asia. The conquered Babylonians were allowed by Cyrus to retain their own gods, after their incorporation in the great Asiatic kingdom.  The Jews, Ionians and inhabitants of Asia Minor, in short, the entire mass of nations subject to Cambyses remained unmolested in possession of their hereditary religions and customs.  Beside the great altar, therefore, might be seen many a smaller sacrificial flame, kindled in honor "]]]
