The darker it grew, the more his anguish rose, and the more hideous were the pictures that stood before his fancy; and when, presently, a pilgrim in the Pastophorium who had fallen into convulsions screamed out loud, he was no longer master of himself--he kicked open the door which, locked on the outside and rotten from age, had been closed for years, hastily concealed about him some silver coins he kept in his chest, and let himself down to the ground.  There he stood, between his cell and the outer wall of the temple, and now it was that he remembered his vows, and the oath he had sworn, and his former flight from his retreat.  Then he had fled because the pleasures and joys of life had tempted him forth--then he had sinned indeed; but now the love, the anxious care that urged him to quit his prison were the same as had brought him back to it.  It was to keep faith that he now broke faith, and mighty Serapis could read his heart, and his mother was dead, and while she lived she had always been ready and willing to forgive.  He fancied so vividly that he could see her kind old face looking at him that he nodded at her as if indeed she stood before him.  Then, he rolled an empty barrel to the foot of the wall, and with some difficulty mounted on it.  The sweat poured down him as he climbed up the wall built of loose unbaked bricks to the parapet, which was much more than a man's height; then, sliding and tumbling, he found himself in the ditch which ran round it on the outside, scrambled up its outer slope, and set out at last on his walk to Memphis.  What he had afterwards learned in the palace concerning Klea had but little relieved his anxiety on her account; she must have reached the border of the desert so much sooner than he, and quick walking was so difficult to him, and hurt the soles of his feet so cruelly!  Perhaps he might be able to procure a staff, but there was just as much bustle outside the gate of the citadel as by day.  He looked round him, feeling the while in his wallet, which was well filled with silver, and his eye fell on a row of asses whose drivers were crowding round the soldiers and servants that streamed out of the great gate.  He sought out the strongest of the beasts with an experienced eye, flung a piece of silver to the owner, mounted the ass, which panted under its load, and promised the driver two drachmm in addition if he would take him as quickly as possible to the second tavern on the road to the Serapeum.  Thus--he belaboring the sides of the unhappy donkey with his sturdy bare legs, while the driver, running after him snorting and shouting, from time to time poked him up from behind with a stick-- Serapion, now going at a short trot, and now at a brisk gallop, reached his destination only half an hour later than Klea.  In the tavern all was dark and empty, but the recluse desired no refreshment.  Only his wish that he had a staff revived in his mind, and he soon contrived to possess himself of one, by pulling a stake out of the fence that surrounded the innkeeper's little garden.  This was a somewhat heavy walking-stick, but it eased the recluse's steps, for though his hot and aching feet carried him but painfully the strength of his arms was considerable.  The quick ride had diverted his mind, had even amused him, for he was easily pleased, and had recalled to him his youthful travels; but now, as he walked on alone in the desert, his thoughts reverted to Klea, and to her only.  He looked round for her keenly and eagerly as soon as the moon came out from behind the clouds, called her name from time to time, and thus got as far as the avenue of sphinxes which connected the Greek and Egyptian temples; a thumping noise fell upon his ear from the cave of the Apis- tombs.  Perhaps they were at work in there, preparing for the approaching festival.  But why were the soldiers, which were always on guard here, absent from their posts to-night?  Could it be that they had observed Klea, and carried her off?  On the farther side of the rows of sphinxes too, which he had now reached, there was not a man to be seen--not a watchman even though the white limestone of the tombstones and the yellow desert-sand shone as clear in the moonlight as if they had some internal light of their own.  At every instant he grew more and more uneasy, he climbed to the top of a sand-hill to obtain a wider view, and loudly called Klea's name.  There--was he deceived?  No--there was a figure visible near one of the ancient tomb-shrines--a form that seemed wrapped in a long robe, and when once more he raised his voice in a loud call it came nearer to him and to the row of sphinxes.  In greate haste and as fast as he could he got down again to the roadway, hurried across the smooth pavement, on both sides of which the long perspective of man-headed lions kept guard, and painfully clambered up a sand-heap on the opposite side.  This was in truth a painful effort, for the sand crumbled away again and again under his feet, slipping down hill and carrying him with it, thus compelling him to find a new hold with hand and foot.  At last he was standing on the outer border of the sphinx-avenue and opposite the very shrine where he fancied he had seen her whom he sought; but during his clamber it had become perfectly dark again, for a heavy cloud had once more veiled the moon.  He put both hands to his mouth, and shouted as loud as he could, \"Klea!\"--and then again, \"Klea!\"  Then, close at his feet he heard a rustle in the sand, and saw a figure moving before him as though it had risen out of the ground.  This could not be Klea, it was a man--still, perhaps, he might have seen his darling--but before he had time to address him he felt the shock of a heavy blow that fell with tremendous force on his back between his shoulders.  The assassin's sand-bag had missed the exact spot on the nape of the neck, and Serapion's strongly-knit backbone would have been able to resist even a stronger blow.  The conviction that he was attacked by robbers flashed on his consciousness as immediately as the sense of pain, and with it the certainty that he was a lost man if he did not defend himself stoutly.  Behind him he heard another rustle in the sand.  As quickly as he could he turned round with an exclamation of \"Accursed brood of vipers!\" and with his heavy staff he fell upon the figure before him like a smith beating cold iron, for his eye, now more accustomed to the darkness, plainly saw it to be a man.  Serapion must have hit straight, for his foe fell at his feet with a hideous roar, rolled over and over in the sand, groaning and panting, and then with one shrill shriek lay silent and motionless.  The recluse, in spite of the dim light, could see all the movements of the robber he had punished so severely, and he was bending over the fallen man anxiously and compassionately when he shuddered to feel two clammy hands touching his feet, and immediately after two sharp pricks in his right heel, which were so acutely painful that he screamed aloud, and was obliged to lift up the wounded foot.  At the same time, however, he did not overlook the need to defend himself.  Roaring like a wounded bull, cursing and raging, he laid about him on all sides with his staff, but hit nothing but the ground.  Then as his blows followed each other more slowly, and at last his wearied arms could no longer wield the heavy stake, and he found himself compelled to sink on his knees, a hoarse voice addressed him thus:  \"You have taken my comrade's life, Roman, and a two-legged serpent has stung you for it.  In a quarter of an hour it will be all over with you, as it is with that fellow there.  Why does a fine gentleman like you go to keep an appointment in the desert without boots or sandals, and so make our work so easy?  King Euergetes and your friend Eulaeus send you their greetings.  You owe it to them that I leave you even your ready money; I wish I could only carry away that dead lump there!\"  During this rough speech Serapion was lying on the ground in great agony; he could only clench his fists, and groan out heavy curses with his lips which were now getting parched.  His sight was as yet undimmed, and he could distinctly see by the light of the moon, which now shone forth from a broad cloudless opening in the sky, that the murderer attempted to carry away his fallen comrade, and then, after raising his head to listen for a moment sprang off with flying steps away into the desert.  But the recluse now lost consciousness, and when some minutes later he once more opened his eyes his head was resting softly in the lap of a young girl, and it was the voice of his beloved Klea that asked him tenderly.  \"You poor dear father!  How came you here in the desert, and into the hands of these murderers?  Do you know me--your Klea?  And he who is looking for your wounds--which are not visible at all--he is the Roman Publius Scipio.  Now first tell us where the dagger hit you that I may bind it up quickly--I am half a physician, and understand these things as you know.\"  The recluse tried to turn his head towards Klea's, but the effort was in vain, and he said in a low voice: \"Prop me up against the slanting wall of the tomb shrine yonder; and you, child, sit down opposite to me, for I would fain look at you while I die.  Gently, gently, my friend Publius, for I feel as if all my limbs were made of Phoenician glass, and might break at the least touch.  Thank you, my young friend--you have strong arms, and you may lift me a little higher yet.  So--now I can bear it; nay, I am well content, I am to be envied--for the moon shows me your dear face, my child, and I see tears on your cheeks, tears for me, a surly old man.  Aye, it is good, it is very good to die thus.\"  \"Oh, father, father!\"  cried Klea.  \"You must not speak so.  You must live, you must not die; for see, Publius here asks me to be his wife, and the Immortals only can know how"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5465"],["title","The Sisters â€” Volume 5 (#2)"],["body"," I am to go with him, and Irene is to stay with us, and be my sister and his.  That must make you happy, father.--But tell us, pray tell us where the wound hurts that the murderer gave you?\"  \"Children,  children,\"  murmured  the  anchorite, and a happy smile parted his lips.  \"The gracious gods are merciful in permitting me to see that--aye, merciful to me, and to effect that end I would have died twenty deaths.\"  Klea pressed his now cold hand to her lips as he spoke and again asked, though hardly able to control her voice for tears:  \"But the wound, father--where is the wound?\"  \"Let be, let be,\" replied Serapion.  \"It is acrid poison, not a dagger or dart that has undone my strength.  And I can depart in peace, for I am no longer needed for anything.  You, Publius, must now take my place with this child, and will do it better than I.  Klea, the wife of Publius Scipio!  I indeed have dreamt that such a thing might come to pass, and I always knew, and have said to myself a thousand times that I now say to you my son: This girl here, this Klea is of a good sort, and worthy only of the noblest.  I give her to you, my son Publius, and now join your hands before me here --for I have always been like a father to her.\"  That you have indeed,\" sobbed Klea.  \"And it was no doubt for my sake, and to protect me, that you quitted your retreat, and have met your death.\"  \"It was fate, it was fate,\" stammered the old man.  \"The assassins were in ambush for me,\" cried Publius, seizing Serapion's hand, \"the murderers who fell on you instead of me.  Once more, where is your wound?\"  \"My destiny fulfils itself,\" replied the recluse.  \"No locked-up cell, no physician, no healing herb can avail against the degrees of Fate. I am dying of a serpent's sting as it was foretold at my birth; and if I had not gone out to seek Klea a serpent would have slipped into my cage, and have ended my life there.  Give me your hands, my children, for a deadly chill is creeping over me, and its cold hand already touches my heart.\"  For a few minutes his voice failed him, and then he said softly:  \"One thing I would fain ask of you.  My little possessions, which were intended for you and Irene, you will now use to bury me.  I do not wish to be burnt, as they did with my father--no, I should wish to be finely embalmed, and my mummy to be placed with my mother's.  If indeed we may meet again after death--and I believe we shall--I would rather see her once more than any one, for she loved me so much--and I feel now as if I were a child again, and could throw my arms round her neck.  In another life, perhaps, I may not be the child of misfortune that I have been in this--in another life--now it grips my heart--in another----Children whatever joys have smiled on me in this, children, it was to you I have owed it--Klea, to you--and there is my little Irene too----\"  These were the last words of Serapion the recluse; he fell back with a deep sigh and was dead.  Klea and Publius tenderly closed his faithful eyes.     CHAPTER XXIII.  The unwonted tumult that had broken the stillness of the night had not been unobserved in the Greek Serapeum any more than in the Egyptian temple adjoining the Apis-tombs; but perfect silence once more reigned in the Necropolis, when at last the great gate of the sanctuary of Osiris- Apis was thrown open, and a little troop of priests arranged in a procession came out from it with a vanguard of temple servants, who had been armed with sacrificial knives and axes.  Publius and Klea, who were keeping faithful watch by the body of their dead friend, saw them approaching, and the Roman said:  \"It would have been even less right in such a night as this to let you proceed to one of the temples with out my escort than to have let our poor friend remain unwatched.\"  \"Once more I assure you,\" said Klea eagerly \"that we should have thrown away every chance of fulfilling Serapion's last wish as he intended, if during our absence a jackal or a hyena had mutilated his body, and I am happy to be able at least to prove to my friend, now he is dead, how grateful I am for all the kindness he showed us while he lived.  We ought to be grateful even to the departed, for how still and blissful has this hour been while guarding his body.  Storm and strife brought us together--\"  \"And here,\" interrupted Publius, \"we have concluded a happy and permanent treaty of peace for the rest of our lives.\"  \"I accept it willingly,\" replied Klea, looking down, \"for I am the vanquished party.\"  \"But you have already confessed,\" said Publius, \"that you were never so unhappy as when you thought you had asserted your strength against mine, and I can tell you that you never seemed to me so great and yet so lovable as when in the midst of your triumph, you gave up the battle for lost.  Such an hour as that, a man experiences but once in his lifetime. I have a good memory, but if ever I should forget it, and be angry and passionate--as is sometimes my way--remind me of this spot, or of this our dead friend, and my hard mood will melt, and I shall remember that you once were ready to give your life for mine.  I will make it easy for you, for in honor of this man, who sacrificed his life for yours and who was actually murdered in my stead, I promise to add his name of Serapion to my own, and I will confirm this vow in Rome.  He has behaved to us as a father, and it behoves me to reverence his memory as though I had been his son.  An obligation was always unendurable to me, and how I shall ever make full restitution to you for what you have done for me this night I do not yet know--and yet I should be ready and willing every day and every hour to accept from you some new gift of love.  'A debtor,' says the proverb, 'is half a prisoner,' and so I must entreat you to deal mercifully with your conquerer.\"  He took her hand, stroked back the hair from her forehead, and touched it lightly with his lips.  Then he went on:  \"Come with me now that we may commit the dead into the hands of these priests.\"  Klea once more bent over the remains of the anchorite, she hung the amulet he had given her for her journey round his neck, and then silently obeyed her lover.  When they came up with the little procession Publius informed the chief priest how he had found Serapion, and requested him to fetch away the corpse, and to cause it to be prepared for interment in the costliest manner in the embalming house attached to their temple. Some of the temple-servants took their places to keep watch over the body, and after many questions addressed to Publius, and after examining too the body of the assassin who had been slain, the priests returned to the temple.  As soon as the two lovers were left alone again Klea seized the Roman's hand, and said passionately: \"You have spoken many tender words to me, and I thank you for them; but I am wont always to be honest, and less than any one could I deceive you.  Whatever your love bestows upon me will always be a free gift, since you owe me nothing at all and I owe you infinitely much; for I know now that you have snatched my sister from the clutches of the mightiest in the land while I, when I heard that Irene had gone away with you, and that murder threatened your life, believed implicitly that on the contrary you had lured the child away to become your sweetheart, and then--then I hated you, and then--I must confess it\\ --in my horrible distraction I wished you dead!\"  \"And you think that wish can offend me or hurt me?\"  said Publius.  \"No, my child; it only proves to me that you love me as I could wish to be loved.  Such rage under such circumstances is but the dark shadow cast by love, and is as inseparable from love as from any tangible body.  Where it is absent there is no such thing as real love present--only an airy vision, a phantom, a mockery.  Such an one as Klea does not love nor hate by halves; but there are mysterious workings in your soul as in that of every other woman.  How did the wish that you could see me dead turn into the fearful resolve to let yourself be killed in my stead?\"  \"I saw the murderers,\" answered Klea, \"and I was overwhelmed with horror of them and of their schemes, and of all that had to do with them; I would not destroy Irene's happiness, and I loved you even more deeply than I hated you; and then--but let us not speak of it.\"  \"Nay-tell me all.\"  \"Then there was a moment--\"  \"Well, Klea?\"  \"Then--in these last hours, while we have been sitting hand in hand by the body of poor Serapion, and hardly speaking, I have felt it all over again--then the midnight hymn of the priests fell upon my heart, and as I lifted up my soul in prayer at their pious chant I felt as if all my inmost heart had been frozen and hardened, and was reviving again to new life and tenderness and warmth.  I could not help thinking of all that is good and right, and I made up my mind to sacrifice myself for you and for Irene's happiness far more quickly and easily than I could give it up afterwards.  My father was one of the followers of Zeno--\"  \"And you,\" interrupted Publius, \"thought you were acting in accordance with the doctrine of the Stoa.  I also am familiar with it, but I do not know the man who is so virtuous and wise that he can live and act, as that teaching prescribes, in the heat of the struggle of life, or who is the living representative in flesh and blood of the whole code of ethics, not sinning against one of its laws and embodying it in himself.  Did you ever hear of the peace of mind, the lofty indifference and equanimity of the Stoic sages?  You look as if the question offended you, but you did not by any means know how to attain that magnanimity, for I have seen you fail in it; indeed it is contrary to the very nature of woman, and-- the gods be thanked--you are not a Stoic in woman's dress, but a woman --a true woman, as you should be.  You have learned nothing from Zeno and Chrysippus but what any peasant girl might"]]]
