How else would I be knowing you?\"  \"You've seen me often enough.\"  \"Maybe. But don't forget that I see a few thousand people every day. And I know you only well enough to know that you do own bona fide credentials. You've got 'em?\"  \"I--\" Paul blinked. A great searing light was starting to cut through the cobwebs of his brain. The airy feeling of well-being dropped below the cumulus cloud and made a one-point landing on strictly solid ground. \"Look,\" he said soberly. \"You claim a man came through here a few minutes ago, resembling me?\"  \"Unless you ain't who you are, he was you.\"  \"He wasn't me. My papers were stolen less than an hour ago. He must have--\"  The guard was no imbecile. He turned in a flash and hit a button on the desk beside him. An alarm bell rang in some inner room and four more guards came tumbling out of a doorway, alert and ready for trouble.  \"Tommy,\" snapped the guard at the door, \"Go check Paul Grayson's ship, that's number--\"  \"BurAst 33-P.G.1.\"  The guard looked at Paul carefully. \"You're a dead ringer for the other guy that came through here,\" he said. \"But you happen to know Paul Grayson's BurAst number. Anybody could memorize it.\"  Paul watched the other guards tumble out of the building and head off across the spaceport on a dead run, drawing pistols as they went. He started to follow them.  The guard barred his way.  \"No you don't!\"  \"But that guy is stealing--\"  \"Maybe your name is Grayson and maybe the other guy is Grayson. You look alike and he had identification. I don't know Paul Grayson well enough to accept or deny you--or him. But until you show me credentials entitling you to roam this spaceport, you stay outside!\"  \"But--\"  \"The boys I sent out there are capable. Don't get in their way. They might shoot the wrong Paul Grayson.\"  \"But--\"  \"Get your credentials. Get some sort of identification.\"  Paul looked at the big standard clock on the wall. \"But I've got less than eight minutes until take-off time.\"  \"There's always tomorrow. You'll get cleared first or no entry! And that's final.\"  \"Hell's Eternal Bells!\" exploded Paul. \"The cops that brought me here did so because I was clipped on the bean and robbed.\"  \"It's my job,\" explained the guard quietly. \"I don't want to be any more of a bastard than I have to be. If you're Paul Grayson and the cops know you were robbed, there's the telephone.\"  Paul grabbed the phone and started to dial, fuming at the delay. First there was a few seconds until the dial tone came, then Paul dialed the outside line. Another few seconds of delay until he could dial the number of the municipal police department. Then a bored voice asked:  \"Police headquarters, who's calling please.\"  \"This is Paul Grayson at the Municipal Spaceport.\"  \"What's the trouble out there?\"  \"A crook stole my identification.\"  \"We'll send a man out to investigate.\"  \"No!\" yelled Paul to prevent the telephone operator from cutting off the line on the assumption that the call was closed. \"You don't understand. I'm supposed to take off in--ah--seven minutes.\"  \"We can't get a man there that quickly. You'll have to wait.\"  \"Look,\" said Paul hurriedly, \"there's a squad car that just dropped me here. I was clipped on Talman Avenue and they went there to investigate, they brought me here. Why not call them and ask them to come back and explain to the guards here what happened?\"  \"I'll check that and take action,\" promised the voice in a completely bored tone.  Paul fumed.  There was the sound of a shot outside, followed instantly by the shrill, whining song of a ricochet, probably a glance from the hard metal flank of a parked spacecraft.  The telephone went dead and a second later came the dial tone again. Paul hung it up reluctantly.  And that made it worse. Other hands were not as imbued with the importance of the project. To other hands it was a routine bit of trouble, not the matter of life and death that it was to Paul Grayson; yet he to whom this thing was vastly important must sit with folded hands while men handled the matter in ponderous routine.  The clock continued to turn inexorably. Paul's mathematically-inclined mind went to work; it was less than two minutes since the police car left. Give them a minute to check up, and a minute to make sure, then a minute to call the car. That was three of the precious seven minutes gone to hell. If it took them as long to return as it took them to get where they now were, throw another two minutes down the drain and that left two minutes in which to let the sergeant explain to the guard, clear Paul Grayson on a pro tem basis, get him across the spaceport to his ship, in, up, and away.  He groaned.  He wished frantically for some means of knowing what was going on; what measures were being made in his behalf. He wanted desperately to listen to the radio in the police car. He wanted to get on the radio himself and roar out explanations, to exhort them to greater effort--  The siren wail of the police car cut into his thoughts and Paul raced to the door to fling it open. The car slid to the curb and the siren whined down the scale as the driver turned it off. They got out of the car and came up the walk briskly.  \"Hurry!\" he called.  He cast a glance over his shoulder at the standard clock. He had three minutes.  \"Tell 'em who I am!\" he exploded breathlessly.  The sergeant blinked. \"But I don't know who you are.\"  \"But I've told you.\"  \"Hell,\" grunted the guard. \"You've told me, too.\" To the sergeant, the guard said: \"Do you know anything about all this?\"  \"We got a call that this man had been clipped and robbed. He was.\" The sergeant looked at Nora Phillips. \"Can you identify this man?\"  Nora bit her lip. \"He's Paul Grayson.\"  The guard speared Nora with a cold look. \"Do you know that or is it just what he said?\"  \"Why I've--\"  \"She's never met him otherwise,\" put in the sergeant.  \"That's true, but I think--\"  \"Thinking ain't good enough.\"  Nora looked at Paul. \"Haven't you anything to show?\"  Paul shook his head. \"Nothing that would cut any ice. Belt buckle with initial G. A few laundry marks and cleaners' marks. A checkbook in my hip pocket but no name printed in it. I might check the balance against the bank, but that would be tomorrow morning. We might call Doctor Haedaecker, but by the time we arrived on some means of personal identification, take-off time would be gone and past.\"  Paul paused, breathless, his whole body poised tense and his head bent to listen. There came the patter of feet outside.  The standard clock was swinging towards the hour, two minutes remained, enough if all went quick and well.  One of the guards burst in. He took a quick look around and spotted the police sergeant. \"Good,\" he said, breathing heavily. \"We've just shot a man out there. You're needed.\"  \"Was it the man who passed himself off as me?\" shouted Paul Grayson.  \"As we came up to BurAst 33-P.G.1, this guy jumped from the airlock and started to run. We gave chase and lost him in the dark beyond a group of parked spacecraft. We called for him to halt. We found him again on the far side of the ships and Joe fired a shot.  \"It must of missed him because he kept running, and then we all started shooting, losing him behind another ship parked by the fence. You know old Mupol 3316? The way the guts are parked all over the spaceport and left to rust? A derelict if I ever saw one, and after this I'd say it was about time we cleaned up that old wreck--\"  \"--Please hurry,\" blurted Paul.  \"--we got to the fence where he'd climbed out over some junk stacked behind Mupol 3316. We went after him, and then guess what?\"  \"What?\"  \"We found this character flat on his face in the road, as dead a corpse as ever died.\"  Paul exploded again. \"That proves it,\" he said. \"Now--\"  The spaceport guard shook his head. This shake was echoed by the sergeant of police.  \"But I've work to do--\"  The sergeant smiled unhappily. \"We've work to do too, son. I'll call you Grayson for the benefit of the doubt. There is not much doubt that something is highly rotten here, but we've got to be certain. There's been one slugging and robbery, the attempted theft of spacecraft, and now a man killed by armed guards in performance of their duty. This is going to require clearing up before we let you go.\"  \"But you know where to find me. I'm due on Proxima Centauri I to check the arrival of the Bureau of Astrogation survey beam. I'm to take off--\"  \"_IF_ you are Paul Grayson.\"  \"If the other guy was Paul Grayson, would he have run from cops?\"  The sergeant laughed bitterly. \"This may come as a shock to you, son. But you have no idea of how many of our Nicest People, Pillars of Society, and Solid Citizens have secrets in their daily lives that make them shun Law and Order when Law and Order comes toward them with a drawn pistol, a subpoena, or a warrant for arrest.\"  The loudspeaker came to life at that moment. \"BurAst 33-P.G.1 taking off for Proxima Centauri I. Timing signal for synchronization first check ...\" the voice died to be replaced by a series of clicks, one second apart.  \"That's my notice--\"  The guard snapped a switch. \"Master Control,\" he said quietly. \"This is Edwards, guard at the main gate, hold the flight.\"  \"Hold the flight?\" answered the speaker.  \"Hold the flight. We've had trouble here.\"  \"Is that what the shooting was all about?\" The timing clicks died in the background. \"What's the trouble?\"  \"We've got two Paul Graysons wanting to take off.\"  \"Tell 'em to draw straws. This is costing money.\"  \"One of them--\"  \"Goddammmit!\" yelled Paul, \"I'm Paul Grayson and I've--\"  \"That you'll have to prove, son,\" said the sergeant.  \"--"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50441"],["title","Master of Life and Death (#1)"],["body","'s not poetry, Mr. Prior--and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is. Take Yeats, for instance--\"  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior back to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand, anything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.  \"Mr. Walton....\"  \"Yes?\"  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt cold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning--potentially tubercular. The boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you--\"  Walton rose. \"_No_,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't ask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're an intelligent man; you understand our program.\"  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the Euthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected--\"  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for _other_ people. So did everyone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly he said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a baby every chance to live.\"  \"_I_ was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced euthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it. \"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe it out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic traits.\"  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr. Prior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do the impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly at Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton feared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his upper left desk drawer.  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly. \"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and slipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the chute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three basilisks.  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been ticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes had been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been sterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves ahead of time.  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn generations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal progeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain, consuming precious food?  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his team succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light outfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about Earth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was still growing.  Prior's words haunted him. _I was tubercular ... where would my poems be now?_  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been tubercular too.  _What good are poets?_ he asked himself savagely.  The reply came swiftly: _What good is anything, then?_ Keats, Shakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How much duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing his bookshelf--his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a one-room home.  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he admitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it would be a criminal act.  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.  Prior's baby.  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there are any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for the next half-hour.\"     II   He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer office was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening letters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into the hallway.  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the lift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek was organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the second-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a single child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking as effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought about repeal of the entire Equalization Law.  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child, and after that I'll keep within the law.  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The clinic was on the twentieth floor.  \"Roy.\"  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise. He steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood there.  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly, his mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy. Something the matter?\"  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been a lot of work lately.\"  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek worked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham had striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at the age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving mankind from itself.  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength, Roy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad you're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning, though. Mind if I join you?\"  \"I'm--not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried, drawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a little, I think.\"  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid you'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director to enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed _Fourteen_; there was a coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed _twenty_, covering the panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his destination.  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to see you this morning?\"  \"Yes,\" Walton said.  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was on his mind?\"  Walton hesitated. \"He--he wanted his son spared from Happysleep. Naturally, I had to turn him down.\"  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one exception, the whole framework crumbles.\"  \"Of course, sir.\"  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back, revealing a neat, gleaming sign:                                _FLOOR 20_                      _Euthanasia Clinic and Files_  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided traveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem nakedly obvious now.  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\" he said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really should take some time off for relaxation each day.\"  \"I'll try, sir.\"  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the door closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.  _Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And damn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!_  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep breath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia files were kept.         *       *       *       *       *  The room was large, as rooms went nowadays--thirty by twenty, with deck upon deck of Donnerson micro-memory-tubes racked along one wall and a bank of microfilm records along the other. In six weeks of life Popeek had piled up an impressive collection of data.  While he stood there, the computer chattered, lights flashed. New facts poured into the memory banks. It probably went on day and night.  \"Can I help--oh, it's you, Mr. Walton,\" a white-smocked technician said. Popeek employed a small army of technicians, each one faceless and without personality, but always ready to serve. \"Is there anything I can do?\"  \"I'm simply running a routine checkup. Mind if I use the machine?\"  \"Not at all, sir. Go right ahead.\"  Walton grinned lightly and stepped forward. The technician practically backed out of his presence.  _No doubt I must radiate charisma_, he thought. Within the building he wore a sort of luminous halo, by virtue of being Director FitzMaugham's protégé and second-in-command. Outside, in the colder reality of the crowded metropolis, he kept his identity and Popeek rank quietly to himself.  Frowning, he tried to remember the Prior boy's name. Ah ... Philip, wasn't it? He punched out a request for the card on Philip Prior.  A moment's pause followed, while the millions of tiny cryotronic circuits raced with information pulses, searching the Donnerson tubes for Philip Prior's record. Then, a brief squeaking sound and a yellow-brown card dropped out of the slot:      _3216847AB1_      _PRIOR, Philip Hugh. Born 31 May 2232, New York General Hospital,     New York. First son of Prior, Lyle Martin and Prior, Ava Leonard.     Wgt. at birth 5lb. 3oz._  An"]]]
