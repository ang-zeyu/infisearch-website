Altogether it was a very neat affair. The windows in front and back were curtained and a pot of geraniums stood on a diminutive shelf. I was amused to see a sandy Irish terrier curled up on a bright Mexican blanket in the bunk.  \"Miss McGill,\" he said, \"I couldn't sell Parnassus for less than four hundred. I've put twice that much into her, one time and another. She's built clean and solid all through, and there's everything a man would need from blankets to bouillon cubes. The whole thing's yours for $400--including dog, cook stove, and everything--jib, boom, and spanker. There's a tent in a sling underneath, and an ice box (he pulled up a little trap door under the bunk) and a tank of coal oil and Lord knows what all. She's as good as a yacht; but I'm tired of her. If you're so afraid of your brother taking a fancy to her, why don't you buy her yourself and go off on a lark? Make _him_ stay home and mind the farm!... Tell you what I'll do. I'll start you on the road myself, come with you the first day and show you how it's worked. You could have the time of your life in this thing, and give yourself a fine vacation. It would give your brother a good surprise, too. Why not?\"  I don't know whether it was the neatness of his absurd little van, or the madness of the whole proposition, or just the desire to have an adventure of my own and play a trick on Andrew, but anyway, some extraordinary impulse seized me and I roared with laughter.  \"Right!\" I said. \"I'll do it.\"  I, Helen McGill, in the thirty-ninth year of my age!    CHAPTER THREE   \"Well,\" I thought, \"if I'm in for an adventure I may as well be spry about it. Andrew'll be home by half-past twelve and if I'm going to give him the slip I'd better get a start. I suppose he'll think I'm crazy! He'll follow me, I guess. Well, he just shan't catch me, that's all!\" A kind of anger came over me to think that I'd been living on that farm for nearly fifteen years--yes, sir, ever since I was twenty-five--and hardly ever been away except for that trip to Boston once a year to go shopping with cousin Edie. I'm a home-keeping soul, I guess, and I love my kitchen and my preserve cupboard and my linen closet as well as grandmother ever did, but something in that blue October air and that crazy little red-bearded man just tickled me.  \"Look here, Mr. Parnassus,\" I said, \"I guess I'm a fat old fool but I just believe I'll do that. You hitch up your horse and van and I'll go pack some clothes and write you a check. It'll do Andrew all the good in the world to have me skip. I'll get a chance to read a few books, too. It'll be as good as going to college!\" And I untied my apron and ran for the house. The little man stood leaning against a corner of the van as if he were stupefied. I dare say he was.  I ran into the house through the front door, and it struck me as comical to see a copy of one of Andrew's magazines lying on the living-room table with \"The Revolt of Womanhood\" printed across it in red letters. \"Here goes for the revolt of Helen McGill,\" I thought. I sat down at Andrew's desk, pushed aside a pad of notes he had been jotting down about \"the magic of autumn,\" and scrawled a few lines:  DEAR ANDREW,  Don't be thinking I'm crazy. I've gone off for an adventure. It just came over me that you've had all the adventures while I've been at home baking bread. Mrs. McNally will look after your meals and one of her girls can come over to do the housework. So don't worry. I'm going off for a little while--a month, maybe--to see some of this happiness and hayseed of yours. It's what the magazines call the revolt of womanhood. Warm underwear in the cedar chest in the spare room when you need it. With love, HELEN.  I left the note on his desk.  Mrs. McNally was bending over the tubs in the laundry. I could see only the broad arch of her back and hear the vigorous zzzzzzz of her rubbing. She straightened up at my call.  \"Mrs. McNally,\" I said, \"I'm going away for a little trip. You'd better let the washing go until this afternoon and get Andrew's dinner for him. He'll be back about twelve-thirty. It's half-past ten now. You tell him I've gone over to see Mrs. Collins at Locust Farm.\"  Mrs. McNally is a brawny, slow-witted Swede. \"All right Mis' McGill,\" she said. \"You be back to denner?\"  \"No, I'm not coming back for a month,\" I said. \"I'm going away for a trip. I want you to send Rosie over here every day to do the housework while I'm away. You can arrange with Mr. McGill about that. I've got to hurry now.\"  Mrs. McNally's honest eyes, as blue as Copenhagen china, gazing through the window in perplexity, fell upon the travelling Parnassus and Mr. Mifflin backing Pegasus into the shafts. I saw her make a valiant effort to comprehend the sign painted on the side of the van--and give it up.  \"You going driving?\" she said blankly.  \"Yes,\" I said, and fled upstairs.  I always keep my bank book in an old Huyler box in the top drawer of my bureau. I don't save very quickly, I'm afraid. I have a little income from some money father left me, but Andrew takes care of that. Andrew pays all the farm expenses, but the housekeeping accounts fall to me. I make a fairish amount of pin money on my poultry and some of my preserves that I send to Boston, and on some recipes of mine that I send to a woman's magazine now and then; but generally my savings don't amount to much over $10 a month. In the last five years I had put by something more than $600. I had been saving up for a Ford. But just now it looked to me as if that Parnassus would be more fun than a Ford ever could be. Four hundred dollars was a lot of money, but I thought of what it would mean to have Andrew come home and buy it. Why, he'd be away until Thanksgiving! Whereas if I bought it I could take it away, have my adventure, and sell it somewhere so that Andrew never need see it. I hardened my heart and determined to give the Sage of Redfield some of his own medicine.  My balance at the Redfield National Bank was $615.20. I sat down at the table in my bedroom where I keep my accounts and wrote out a check to Roger Mifflin for $400. I put in plenty of curlicues after the figures so that no one could raise the check into $400,000; then I got out my old rattan suit case and put in some clothes. The whole business didn't take me ten minutes. I came downstairs to find Mrs. McNally looking sourly at the Parnassus from the kitchen door.  \"You going away in that--that 'bus, Mis' McGill?\" she asked.  \"Yes, Mrs. McNally,\" I said cheerfully. Her use of the word gave me an inspiration. \"That's one of the new jitney 'buses we hear about. He's going to take me to the station. Don't you worry about me. I'm going for a holiday. You get Mr. McGill's dinner ready for him. After dinner tell him there's a note for him in the living-room.\"  \"I tank that bane a queer 'bus,\" said Mrs. McNally, puzzled. I think the excellent woman suspected an elopement.  I carried my suit case out to the Parnassus. Pegasus stood placidly between the shafts. From within came sounds of vigorous movement. In a moment the little man burst out with a bulging portmanteau in his hand. He had a tweed cap slanted on the back of his head.  \"There!\" he cried triumphantly. \"I've packed all my personal effects--clothes and so on--and everything else goes with the transaction. When I get on the train with this bag I'm a free man, and hurrah for Brooklyn! Lord, won't I be glad to get back to the city! I lived in Brooklyn once, and I haven't been back there for ten years,\" he added plaintively.  \"Here's the check,\" I said, handing it to him. He flushed a little, and looked at me rather shamefacedly. \"See here,\" he said, \"I hope you're not making a bad bargain? I don't want to take advantage of a lady. If you think your brother....\"  \"I was going to buy a Ford, anyway,\" I said, \"and it looks to me as though this parcheesi of yours would be cheaper to run than any flivver that ever came out of Detroit. I want to keep it away from Andrew and that's the main thing. You give me a receipt and we'll get away from here before he comes back.\"  He took the check without a word, hoisted his fat portmanteau on the driver's seat, and then disappeared in the van. In a minute he reappeared. On the back of one of his poetical cards he had written:  Received from Miss McGill the sum of four hundred dollars in exchange for one Travelling Parnassus in first class condition, delivered to her this day, October 3rd, 19--.  Signed ROGER MIFFLIN.  \"Tell me,\" I said, \"does your Parnassus--_my_ Parnassus, rather--contain everything I'm likely to need? Is it stocked up with food and so on?\"  \"I was coming to that,\" he said. \"You'll find a fair supply of stuff in the cupboard over the stove, though I used to get most of my meals at farmhouses along the road. I generally read aloud to people as I go along, and they're often good for a free meal. It's amazing how little most of the country folk know about books, and how pleased they are to hear good stuff. Down in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania....\"  \"Well, how about the horse?\" I said hastily, seeing him about to embark on an anecdote. It wasn't far short of eleven o'clock, and I was anxious to get started.  \"It might be well to take along some oats. My supply's about exhausted.\"  I filled a sack with oats in the stable and Mr. Mifflin showed me where to hang it under the van. Then in the kitchen I loaded a big basket with provisions for an emergency: a dozen eggs, a jar of sliced bacon, butter, cheese, condensed milk, tea, biscuits, jam, and two loaves of bread. These Mr. Mifflin stowed inside the van, Mrs. McNally watching in amazement.  \"I tank this bane a queer picnic!\" she said. \"Which way are you going? Mr. McGill, is he coming after you?\"  \"No,\" I insisted, \"he's not coming. I'm going off on a holiday. You get dinner for him and he won't worry about anything until after that."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5312"],["title","Mother Goose in Prose (#1)"],["body","that they have been relegated to oblivion, while the real gems of the collection will doubtless live and grow in popular favor for many ages.  While I have taken some pains to record the various claims to the origin of Mother Goose, it does not matter in the least whether she was in reality a myth, or a living Eliza Goose, Martha Gooch or the \"M廨e Oye\" of Perrault. The songs that cluster around her name are what we love, and each individual verse appeals more to the childish mind than does Mother Goose herself.  Many of these nursery rhymes are complete tales in themselves, telling their story tersely but completely; there are others which are but bare suggestions, leaving the imagination to weave in the details of the story. Perhaps therein may lie part of their charm, but however that may be I have thought the children might like the stories told at greater length, that they may dwell the longer upon their favorite heroes and heroines.  For that reason I have written this book.  In making the stories I have followed mainly the suggestions of the rhymes, and my hope is that the little ones will like them, and not find that they interfere with the fanciful creations of their own imaginations.                                              L. FRANK BAUM.  Chicago, Illinois, July, 1899.     [Illustration: Sing a Song o' Sixpence]     Sing a Song o' Sixpence      Sing a song o' sixpence, a handful of rye,     Four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie;     When the pie was opened the birds began to sing,     Wasn't that a dainty dish to set before the King?   IF you have never heard the legend of Gilligren and the King's pie you will scarcely understand the above verse; so I will tell you the whole story, and then you will be able to better appreciate the rhyme.  Gilligren was an orphan, and lived with an uncle and aunt who were very unkind to him. They cuffed him and scolded him upon the slightest provocation, and made his life very miserable indeed. Gilligren never rebelled against this treatment, but bore their cruelty silently and with patience, although often he longed to leave them and seek a home amongst kinder people.  It so happened that when Gilligren was twelve years old the King died, and his son was to be proclaimed King in his place, and crowned with great ceremony. People were flocking to London from all parts of the country, to witness the festivities, and the boy longed to go with them.  One evening he said to his uncle,  \"If I had sixpence I could make my fortune.\"  \"Pooh! nonsense!\" exclaimed his uncle, \"a sixpence is a small thing. How then could you make a fortune from it?\"  \"That I cannot tell you,\" replied Gilligren, \"but if you will give me the sixpence I will go to London, and not return until I am a rich man.\"  \"The boy is a fool!\" said his uncle, with anger; but the aunt spoke up quickly.  \"Give him the money and let him go,\" she said, \"and then we shall be well rid of him and no longer be obliged to feed and clothe him at our expense.\"  \"Well,\" said her husband, after a moment's thought, \"here is the money; but remember, this is all I shall ever give you, and when it is gone you must not come to me for more.\"  \"Never fear,\" replied Gilligren, joyfully, as he put the sixpence in his pocket, \"I shall not trouble you again.\"  The next morning he cut a short stick to assist him in walking, and after bidding good-bye to his uncle and aunt he started upon his journey to London.  \"The money will not last him two days,\" said the man, as he watched Gilligren go down the turnpike road, \"and when it is gone he will starve to death.\"  \"Or he may fall in with people who will treat him worse than we did,\" rejoined the woman, \"and then he'll wish he had never left us.\"  But Gilligren, nothing dismayed by thoughts of the future, trudged bravely along the London road. The world was before him, and the bright sunshine glorified the dusty road and lightened the tips of the dark green hedges that bordered his path. At the end of his pilgrimage was the great city, and he never doubted he would find therein proper work and proper pay, and much better treatment than he was accustomed to receive.  So, on he went, whistling merrily to while away the time, watching the sparrows skim over the fields, and enjoying to the full the unusual sights that met his eyes. At noon he overtook a carter, who divided with the boy his luncheon of bread and cheese, and for supper a farmer's wife gave him a bowl of milk. When it grew dark he crawled under a hedge and slept soundly until dawn.  The next day he kept steadily upon his way, and toward evening met a farmer with a wagon loaded with sacks of grain.  \"Where are you going, my lad?\" asked the man.  \"To London,\" replied Gilligren, \"to see the King crowned.\"  \"Have you any money?\" enquired the farmer.  \"Oh yes,\" answered Gilligren, \"I have a sixpence.\"  \"If you will give me the sixpence,\" said the man, \"I will give you a sack of rye for it.\"  \"What could I do with a sack of rye?\" asked Gilligren, wonderingly.  \"Take it to the mill, and get it ground into flour. With the flour you could have bread baked, and that you can sell.\"  \"That is a good idea,\" replied Gilligren, \"so here is my sixpence, and now give me the sack of rye.\"  The farmer put the sixpence carefully into his pocket, and then reached under the seat of the wagon and drew out a sack, which he cast on the ground at the boy's feet.  \"There is your sack of rye,\" he said, with a laugh.  \"But the sack is empty!\" remonstrated Gilligren.  \"Oh, no; there is some rye in it.\"  \"But only a handful!\" said Gilligren, when he had opened the mouth of the sack and gazed within it.  \"It is a sack of rye, nevertheless,\" replied the wicked farmer, \"and I did not say how much rye there would be in the sack I would give you. Let this be a lesson to you never again to buy grain without looking into the sack!\" and with that he whipped up his horses and left Gilligren standing in the road with the sack at his feet and nearly ready to cry at his loss.  \"My sixpence is gone,\" he said to himself, \"and I have received nothing in exchange but a handful of rye! How can I make my fortune with that?\"  He did not despair, however, but picked up the sack and continued his way along the dusty road. Soon it became too dark to travel farther, and Gilligren stepped aside into a meadow, where, lying down upon the sweet grass, he rolled the sack into a pillow for his head and prepared to sleep.  The rye that was within the sack, however, hurt his head, and he sat up and opened the sack.  \"Why should I keep a handful of rye?\" he thought, \"It will be of no value to me at all.\"  So he threw out the rye upon the ground, and rolling up the sack again for a pillow, was soon sound asleep.  When he awoke the sun was shining brightly over his head and the twitter and chirping of many birds fell upon his ears. Gilligren opened his eyes and saw a large flock of blackbirds feeding upon the rye he had scattered upon the ground. So intent were they upon their feast they never noticed Gilligren at all.  He carefully unfolded the sack, and spreading wide its opening threw it quickly over the flock of blackbirds. Some escaped and flew away, but a great many were caught, and Gilligren put his eye to the sack and found he had captured four and twenty. He tied the mouth of the sack with a piece of twine that was in his pocket, and then threw the sack over his shoulder and began again his journey to London.  \"I have made a good exchange, after all,\" he thought, \"for surely four and twenty blackbirds are worth more than a handful of rye, and perhaps even more than a sixpence, if I can find anyone who wishes to buy them.\"  He now walked rapidly forward, and about noon entered the great city of London.  Gilligren wandered about the streets until he came to the King's palace, where there was a great concourse of people and many guards to keep intruders from the gates.  Seeing he could not enter from the front, the boy walked around to the rear of the palace and found himself near the royal kitchen, where the cooks and other servants were rushing around to hasten the preparation of the King's dinner.  Gilligren sat down upon a stone where he could watch them, and laying the sack at his feet was soon deeply interested in the strange sight.  Presently a servant in the King's livery saw him and came to his side.  \"What are you doing here?\" he asked, roughly.  \"I am waiting to see the King,\" replied Gilligren.  \"The King! The King never comes here,\" said the servant; \"and neither do we allow idlers about the royal kitchen. So depart at once, or I shall be forced to call a guard to arrest you.\"  Gilligren arose obediently and slung his sack over his shoulder. As he did so the birds that were within began to flutter.  \"What have you in the sack?\" asked the servant.  \"Blackbirds,\" replied Gilligren.  \"Blackbirds!\" echoed the servant, in surprise, \"well, that is very fortunate indeed. Come with me at once!\" He seized the boy by the arm and drew him hastily along until they entered the great kitchen of the palace.  \"Here, Mister Baker!\" the man called, excitedly, \"I have found your blackbirds!\"  A big, fat man who was standing in the middle of the kitchen with folded arms and a look of despair upon his round, greasy face, at once came toward them and asked eagerly,  \"The blackbirds? are you sure you can get them?\"  \"They are here already; the boy has a bag full of them.\"  \"Give them to me,\" said the cook, who wore a square cap, that was shaped like a box, upon his head.  \"What do you want with them?\" asked Gilligren.  \"I want them for a pie for the King's dinner,\" answered Mister Baker; \"His Majesty ordered the dish, and I have hunted all over London for the blackbirds, but could not find them. Now that you have brought them, however, you have saved me my position as cook, and perhaps my head as well.\"  \"But it would be cruel to put the beautiful birds in a pie,\" remonstrated"]]]
