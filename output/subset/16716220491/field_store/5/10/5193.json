Every native Frenchman, therefore, was at least the son of a king. It was impossible for Thatcher Blitt to be less.  So the hunt went on from day to day, past ancient Greece, past Jarmo, past the wheel and metals and farming and on even past all civilization, outward and backward into the cold primordial wastes of northern Germany.  And still there was nothing. Though Jukes lived in daily fear of losing his job, there was nothing to do but press on. In Germany, he reduced Blitt's ancestor to a slovenly little man who was one of only three men in the entire tribe, or family, one of three in an area which now contains millions. But Blitt's ancestor, true to form, was simply a member of the tribe. As was his father before him.  Yet onward it went. Westward back into the French caves, southward into Spain and across the unrecognizable Mediterranean into a verdant North Africa, backward in time past even the Cro-Magnons, and yet ever backward, 30,000 years, 35,000, with old Blitt reduced now practically to gibbering and still never an exceptional forebear.  There came a time when Jukes had at last, inevitably, to face the old man. He had scanned back as far as he could. The latest ancestor he had unearthed for Blitt was a hairy creature who did not walk erect. And yet, even here, Blitt refused to concede.  \"It may be,\" he howled, \"it _must_ be that my ancestor _was_ the first man to walk erect or light a fire--to do _something_.\"  It was not until Jukes pointed out that all those things had been already examined and found hopeless that Blitt finally gave in. Blitt was a relative, of course, of the first man to stand erect, the man with the first human brain. But so was everybody else on the face of the Earth. There was truly nowhere else to explore. What would be found now would be only the common history of mankind.  Blitt retired to his chambers and refused to be seen.         *       *       *       *       *  The story went the rounds, as such stories will. And it was then at last, after 40,000 years of insignificance, that the name of Blitt found everlasting distinction. The story was picked up, fully documented, by psychologists and geneticists of the time, and inserted into textbooks as a profound commentary on the forces of heredity. The name of Thatcher Blitt in particular has become famous, has persisted until this day. For he is the only man yet discovered, or ever likely to be discovered, with this particular distinction.  In 40,000 years of scanner-recorded history, the blood line of Blitt (or Blott) never once produced an exceptional man.  That record is unsurpassed."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51295"],["title","The Man Who Was Six (#1)"],["body","to have psychotherapy and I'd have to have orientation before I could see you. That's why I was so surprised when you rang the bell.\"  His head was churning with ideas, trying to sort them out. Part of last night was dim, part sharp and satisfying.  \"What's Wysocki's theorem?\" she asked.  \"_Whose_ theorem?\"  \"Wysocki's. I started to call the hospital and you wouldn't let me, because of the theorem. You said you'd explain it this morning.\" She glanced at the bruise on her arm.  It was then he'd grabbed her, to keep her from talking to the hospital. He'd been unnecessarily rough, but that could be ascribed to lack of coordination. She could have been terrified, might have resisted--but she hadn't. At that time, she must have half-believed he was Dan Merrol, still dangerously near the edges of post-regrowth shock.         *       *       *       *       *  She was looking at him, waiting for that explanation. He shook his mind frantically and the words came out. \"Self-therapy,\" he said briskly. \"The patient alone understands what he needs.\" She started to interrupt, but he shook his head and went on blithely. \"That's the first corollary of the theorem. The second is that there are critical times in the recovery of the patient. At such times, with the least possible supervision, he should be encouraged to make his own decisions and carry them through by himself, even though running a slight risk of physical complications.\"  \"That's new, isn't it?\" she said. \"I always thought they watched the patient carefully.\"  It ought to be new--he'd just invented it. \"You know how rapidly medical practices change,\" he said quickly. \"Anyway, when they examined me last night, I was much stronger than they expected--so, when I wanted to come home, they let me. It's their latest belief that initiative is more important than perfect health.\"  \"Strange,\" she muttered. \"But you are very strong.\" She looked at him and blushed. \"Initiative, certainly you have. Dan could use some, wherever he is.\"  Dan again, whether it was himself or another person. For a brief time, as she listened to him, he'd had the silly idea that.... But it could never happen to him. He'd better leave now while she was distracted and bewildered and believed what he was saying. \"I've got to go. I'm due back,\" he told her.  \"Not before you eat,\" she said. \"Any man who's spent the night with me is hungry in the morning.\"  It was a domestic miracle that amidst all the pressing and fitting, she'd somehow prepared breakfast and he hadn't noticed. It was a simple chore with the automatics, but to him it seemed a proof of her wifely skill.  He wanted to protest, but didn't. Maybe it was the hand she was holding--it seemed to be equipped with a better set of nerves than its predecessor. It tingled at her touch. Sadly, he sat down and looked at his food. Eat? Did he want to eat? Oddly enough, he did.  \"How much do you remember of the accident?\" She shoved aside her own food and sat watching him.         *       *       *       *       *  Not a thing, now that she asked. In fact, there wasn't much he did remember. There had been the chart at his bed-side, with one word scrawled on it--_accident_--and that was where he'd got the idea. There had been other marks too, but he hadn't been able to decipher them. He nodded and said nothing and she took it as he thought she would.  \"It wasn't anybody's fault. The warning devices which were supposed to work didn't,\" she began. \"A Moon ship collided with a Mars liner in the upper atmosphere. The ships broke up in several parts and since they are compartmented and the delay rockets switched on immediately, the separate parts fell rather gently, considering how high they were. Casualties weren't as great as you might think.  \"Parts of the two ships fell together, the rest were scattered. There was some interchange of passengers in the wreckage, but since you were found in the control compartment of the Mars liner, they assumed you were the pilot. They never let me see you until yesterday and then it was just a glimpse. I took their word when they said you were Dan Merrol.\"  At least he knew who or what Dan Merrol was--the pilot of the Mars liner. They had assumed he was the pilot because of where he was found, but he might have been tossed there--impact did strange things.  Dan Merrol was a spaceship pilot and he hadn't included it among his skills. It was strange that she had believed him at all. But now that it was out in the open, he did remember some facts about spaceships. He felt he could manage a takeoff at this instant.  But why hadn't he told her? Shock? Perhaps--but where had those other identities come from--lepidopterist, musician, actor, mathematician and wrestler? And where had he got memories of wives, slender and passionate, petite and wild, casual and complaisant, nagging and insecure?  Erica he didn't remember at all, save from last night, and what was that due to?  \"What are you going to do?\" he asked, deliberately toying with the last bite of breakfast. It gave him time to think.  \"They said they'd identified everyone, living or dead, and I supposed they had. After seeing you, I can believe they made any number of similar mistakes. Dan Merrol may be alive under another name. It will be hard to do, but I must try to find him. Some of the accident victims went to other hospitals, you know, the ones located nearest where they fell.\"  Even if he was sure, he didn't know whether he could tell her--and he wasn't sure any longer, although he had been. On the physical side of marriage, how could he ask her to share a body she'd have to laugh at? Later, he might tell her, if there was to be a 'later.' He pushed back his chair and looked at her uncertainly.  \"Let me call a 'copter,\" she said. \"I hate to see you go.\"  \"Wysocki's theorem,\" he told her. \"The patient has decided to walk.\" He weaved toward the door and twisted the knob. He turned in time to catch her in his arms.  \"I know this is wrong,\" she said, pressing against him.  It might be wrong, but it was very pleasant, though he did guess her motives. She was a warmhearted girl and couldn't help pitying him. \"Don't be so damned considerate,\" he mumbled.  \"You'll have to put me down,\" she said, averting her eyes. \"Otherwise.... You're an intolerable funny man.\"  He knew it--he could see himself in the mirror. He was something to laugh at when anyone got tired of pretending sympathy. He put her down and stumbled out. He thought he could hear the bed creak as she threw herself on it.   II  Once he got started, walking wasn't hard. His left side swung at a different rate from his right, but that was due to the variation in the length of his thighs and lower legs, and the two rhythms could be reconciled. He swept along, gaining control of his muscles. He became aware that he was whizzing past everyone.  He slowed down--he didn't want to attract attention. It was difficult but he learned to walk at a pedestrian pace. However poorly they'd matched his legs, they'd given him good ones.  Last night, on an impulse, he'd left the hospital and now he had to go back. _Had_ to? Of course. There were too many uncertainties still to be settled. He glanced around. It was still very early in the morning and normal traffic was just beginning. Maybe they hadn't missed him yet, though it was unlikely.  He seemed to know the route well enough and covered the distance in a brief time. He turned in at the building and, scanning the directory, went at once to the proper floor and stopped at the desk.         *       *       *       *       *  The receptionist was busy with the drawer of the desk. \"Can I help you?\" she asked, continuing to peer down.  \"The director--Doctor Crander. I don't have an appointment.\"  \"Then the director can't see you.\" The girl looked up and her firmly polite expression became a grimace of barely suppressed laughter.  Then laughter was swept away. What replaced it he couldn't say, but it didn't seem related to humor. She placed her hand near his but it went astray and got tangled with his fingers. \"I just thought of a joke,\" she murmured. \"Please don't think that I consider you at all funny.\"  The hell she didn't--and it was the second time within the hour a woman had used that word on him. He wished they'd stop. He took back his hand, the slender one, an exquisite thing that might once have belonged to a musician. Was there an instrument played with one hand? The other one was far larger and clumsier, more suited to mayhem than music. \"When can I see the director?\"  She blinked at him. \"A patient?\" She didn't need to look twice to see that he had been one. \"The director does occasionally see ex-patients.\"  He watched her appreciatively as she went inside. The way she walked, you'd think she had a special audience. Presently the door opened and she came back, batting her eyes vigorously.  \"You can go in now,\" she said huskily. Strange, her voice had dropped an octave in less than a minute. \"The old boy tried to pretend he was in the middle of a grave emergency.\"  On his way in, he miscalculated, or she did, and he brushed against her. The touch was pleasant, but not thrilling. That reaction seemed reserved for Erica.  \"Glad to see you,\" said Doctor Crander, behind the desk. He was nervous and harassed for so early in the morning. \"The receptionist didn't give me your name. For some reason she seems upset.\"  She did at that, he thought--probably bewildered by his appearance. The hospital didn't seem to have a calming influence on either her or the doctor. \"That's why I came here. I'm not sure who I am. I thought I was Dan Merrol.\"  Doctor Crander tried to fight his way through the desk. Being a little wider and solider, though not by much, the desk won. He contented himself by wiping his forehead. \"Our missing patient,\" he said, sighing with vast relief. \"For a while I had visions of....\" He then decided that visions were nothing a medical man should place much"]]]
