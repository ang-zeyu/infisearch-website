Then he entreated her not to mourn for him, but to consider him happy; for he had enjoyed the richest favours of Fortune.  He owed his brightest hours to her love; but he had also been the first and most powerful man on earth.  Now he was dying in the arms of Love, honourable as a Roman who succumbed to Romans.  In this conviction he died after a short struggle.  Cleopatra had watched his last breath, closed his eyes, and then thrown herself tearlessly on her lover's body.  At last she fainted, and lay unconscious with her head upon his marble breast.  The private secretary had witnessed all this, and then returned with tearful eyes to the second story.  There he met Gorgias, who had climbed the scaffolding, and told him what he had seen and heard from the stairs. But his story was scarcely ended when a carriage stopped at the Corner of the Muses and an aristocratic Roman alighted.  This was the very Proculejus whom the dying Antony had recommended to the woman he loved as worthy of her confidence.  \"In fact,\" Gorgias continued, \"he seemed in form and features one of the noblest of his haughty race.  He came commissioned by Octavianus, and is said to be warmly devoted to the Caesar, and a well-disposed man.  We have also heard him mentioned as a poet and a brother-in-law of Maecenas. A wealthy aristocrat, he is a generous patron of literature, and also holds art and science in high esteem.  Timagenes lauds his culture and noble nature.  Perhaps the historian was right; but where the object in question is the state and its advantage, what we here regard as worthy of a free man appears to be considered of little moment at the court of Octavianus.  The lord to whom he gives his services intrusted him with a difficult task, and Proculejus doubtless considered it his duty to make every effort to perform it--and yet----If I see aright, a day will come when he will curse this, and the obedience with which he, a free man, aided Caesar  But listen.  \"Erect and haughty in his splendid suit of armour, he knocked at the door of the tomb.  Cleopatra had regained consciousness and asked--she must have known him in Rome--what he desired.  \"He had come, he answered courteously, by the command of Octavianus, to negotiate with her, and the Queen expressed her willingness to listen, but refused to admit him into the mausoleum.  \"So they talked with each other through the door.  With dignified composure, she asked to have the sons whom she had given to Antony--not Caasarion--acknowledged as Kings of Egypt.  \"Proculejus instantly promised to convey her wishes to Caesar, and gave hopes of their fulfilment.  \"While she was speaking of the children and their claims--she did not mention her own future--the Roman questioned her about Mark Antony's death, and then described the destruction of the dead man's army and other matters of trivial importance.  Proculejus did not look like a babbler, but I felt a suspicion that he was intentionally trying to hold the attention of the Queen.  This proved to be his design; he had been merely waiting for Cornelius Gallus, the commander of the fleet, of whom you have heard.  He, too, ranks among the chief men in Rome, and yet he made himself the accomplice of Proculejus.  \"The latter retired as soon as he had presented the new-comer to the hapless woman.  \"I remained at my post and now heard Gallus assure Cleopatra of his master's sympathy.  With the most bombastic exaggeration he described how bitterly Octavianus mourned in Mark Antony the friend, the brother-in- law, the co-ruler and sharer in so many important enterprises.  He had shed burning tears over the tidings of his death.  Never had more sincere ones coursed down any man's cheeks.  \"Gallus, too, seemed to me to be intentionally prolonging the conversation.  \"Then, while I was listening intently to understand Cleopatra's brief replies, my foreman, who, when the workmen were driven away by the Romans, had concealed himself between two blocks of granite, came to me and said that Proculejus had just climbed a ladder to the scaffold in the rear of the monument.  Two servants followed, and they had all stolen down into the hall.  \"I hastily started up.  I had been lying on the floor with my head outstretched to listen.  \"Cost what it might, the Queen must be warned.  Treachery was certainly at work here.  \"But I came too late.  \"O Dion!  If I had only been informed a few minutes before, perhaps something still more terrible might have happened, but the Queen would have been spared what now threatens her.  What can she expect from the conqueror who, in order to seize her alive, condescends to outwit a noble, defenceless woman, who has succumbed to superior power?  \"Death would have released the unhappy Queen from sore trouble and horrible shame.  And she had already raised the dagger against her life. Before my eyes she flung aloft her beautiful arm with the flashing steel, which glittered in the light of the candles in the many-branched candelabra beside the sarcophagi.  But I will try to remain calm!  You shall hear what happened in regular order.  My thoughts grow confused as the terrible scene recurs to my memory.  To describe it as I saw it, I should need to be a poet, an artist in words; for what passed before me happened on a stage--you know, it was a tomb.  The walls were of dark stone-dark, too, were the pillars and ceiling--all dark and glittering; most portions were smoothly polished stone, shining like a mirror.  Near the sarcophagi, and around the candelabra as far as the vicinity of the door, where the rascally trick was played, the light was brilliant as in a festal hall.  Every blood-stain on the hand, every scratch, every wound which the desperate woman had torn with her own nails on her bosom, which gleamed snow-white from her black robes, was distinctly visible.  Farther away, on the right and left, the light was dim, and near the side walls the darkness was as intense as in a real tomb.  On the smooth porphyry columns, the glittering black marble and serpentine--here, there, and everywhere--flickered the wavering reflection of the candlelight.  The draught kept it continually in motion, and it wavered to and fro in the hall, like the restless souls of the damned.  Wherever the eye turned it met darkness.  The end of the hall seemed black--black as the anteroom of Hades--yet through it pierced a brilliant moving bar; sunbeams which streamed from the stairway into the tomb and amid which danced tiny motes.  How the scene impressed the eye!  The home of gloomy Hecate!  And the Queen and her impending fate.  A picture flooded with light, standing forth in radiant relief against the darkness of the heavy, majestic forms surrounding it in a wide circle.  This tomb in this light would be a palace meet for the gloomy rule of the king of the troop of demons conjured up by the power of a magician--if they have a ruler.  But where am I wandering?  'The artist!'  I hear you  exclaim  again, 'the  artist! Instead of rushing forward and interposing, he stands studying the light and its effects in the royal tomb.'  Yes, yes; I had come too late, too late--far too late!  On the stairs leading to the lower story of the building I saw it, but I was not to blame for the delay--not in the least!  \"At first I had been unable to see the men--or even a shadow; but I beheld plainly in the brightest glare of the light the body of Mark Antony on the couch and, in the dusk farther towards the right, Iras and Charmian trying to raise a trapdoor.  It was the one which closed the passage leading to the combustible materials stored in the cellar.  A sign from the Queen had commanded them to fire it.  The first steps of the staircase, down which I was hastening, were already behind me--then-- then Proculejus, with two men, suddenly dashed from the intense darkness on the other side.  Scarcely able to control myself, I sprang down the remaining steps, and while Iras's shrill cry, 'Poor Cleopatra, they will capture you!' still rang in my ears, I saw the betrayed Queen turn from the door through which, resolved on death, she was saying something to Gallus, perceive Proculejus close behind her, thrust her hand into her girdle, and with the speed of lightning--you have already heard so--throw up her arm with the little dagger to bury the sharp blade in her breast. What a picture!  In the full radiance of the brilliant light, she resembled a statue of triumphant victory or of noble pride in great deeds accomplished; and then, then, only an instant later, what an outrage was inflicted!  \"Like a robber, an assassin, Proculejus rushed upon her, seized her arm, and wrested the weapon from her grasp.  His tall figure concealed her from me.  But when, struggling to escape from the ruffian's clutch, she again turned her face towards the hall, what a transformation had occurred!  Her eyes--you know how large they are--were twice their usual size, and blazed with scorn, fury, and hatred for the traitor.  The cheering light had become a consuming fire.  So I imagine the vengeance, the curse which calls down ruin upon the head of a foe.  And Proculejus, the great lord, the poet whose noble nature is praised by the authors on the banks of the Tiber, held the defenceless woman, the worthy daughter of a brilliant line of kings, in a firm grasp, as if it required the exertion of all his strength to master this delicate embodiment of charming womanhood.  True, the proud blood of the outwitted lioness urged her to resist this profanation, and Proculejus--an enviable honour--made her feel the superior strength of his arm.  I am no prophet, but Dion, I repeat, this shameful struggle and the glances which flashed upon him will be remembered to his dying hour.  Had they been darted at me, I should have cursed my life.  \"They blanched even the Roman's cheeks.  He was lividly pale as he completed what he deemed his duty. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5481"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 09 (#2)"],["body"," His own aristocratic hands were degraded to the menial task of searching the garments of a woman, the Queen, for forbidden wares, poisons or weapons.  He was aided by one of Caesar's freedmen, Epaphroditus, who is said to stand so high in the favour of Octavianus.  \"The scoundrel also searched Iras and Charmian, yet all the time both Romans constantly spoke in cajoling terms of Caesar's favour; and his desire to grant Cleopatra everything which was due a Queen.  \"At last she was taken back to Lochias, but I felt like a madman; for the image of the unfortunate woman pursued me like my shadow.  It was no longer a vision of the bewitching sovereign nay, it resembled the incarnation of despair, tearless anguish, wrath demanding vengeance. I will not describe it; but those eyes, those flashing, threatening eyes, and the tangled hair on which Antony's blood had flowed-terrible, horrible!  My heart grew chill, as if I had seen upon Athene's shield the head of the Medusa with its serpent locks.  \"It had been impossible for me to warn her in time, or even to seize the traitor's arm--I have already said so--and yet, yet her shining image gazed reproachfully at me for my cowardly delay.  Her glance still haunts me, robbing me of calmness and peace.  Not until I gaze into Helena's pure, calm eyes will that terrible vision of the face, flooded by light in the midst of the tomb, cease to haunt me.\"  His friend laid his hand on his arm, spoke soothingly to him, and reminded him of the blessings which this terrible day--he had said so himself--had brought.  Dion was right to give this warning; for Gorgias's bearing and the very tone of his voice changed as he eagerly declared that the frightful events had been followed by more than happy ones for the city, his friend, and Barine.  Then, with a sigh of relief, he continued: \"I pursued my way home like a drunken man.  Every attempt to approach the Queen or her attendants was baffled, but I learned from Charmian's clever Nubian that Cleopatra had been permitted, in Caesar's name, to choose the palace she desired to occupy, and had selected the one at Lochias.  \"I did not make much progress towards my house; the crowd in front of the great gymnasium stopped me.  Octavianus had gone into the city, and the people, I heard, had greeted him with acclamations and flung themselves on their knees before him.  Our stiff-necked Alexandrians in the dust before the victor!  It enraged me, but my resentment was diminished.  \"The members of the gymnasium all knew me.  They made way and, ere I was aware of it, I had passed through the door.  Tall Phryxus had drawn my arm through his.  He appears and vanishes at will, is as alert as he is rich, sees and hears everything, and manages to secure the best places. This time he had again succeeded; for when he released me we were standing opposite to a newly erected tribune.  \"They were waiting for Octavianus, who was still in the hypostyle of Euergetes receiving the homage of the epitrop, the members of the Council, the gymnasiarch, and I know not how many others.  \"Phryxus said that on Caesar's entry he had held out his hand to his former tutor, bade him accompany him, and commanded that his sons should be presented.  The philosopher had been distinguished above every one else, and this will benefit you and yours; for he is Berenike's brother, and therefore your wife's uncle.  What he desires is sure to be granted. You will hear at once how studiously the Caesar distinguishes him.  I do not grudge it to the man; he interceded boldly for Barine; he is lauded as an able scholar, and he does not lack courage.  In spite of Actium and the only disgraceful deed with which, to my knowledge, Mark Antony could be reproached--I mean the surader of Turullius--Arius remained here, though the Imperator might have held the friend of Julius Caesar's nephew as a hostage as easily as he gave up the Emperor's assassin.  \"Since Octavianus encamped before the city, your uncle has been in serious danger, and his sons shared his peril.  Surely you must know the handsome, vigorous young Ephebi.  \"We were not obliged to wait long in the gymnasium ere the Caesar appeared on the platform; and now--if your hand clenches, it is only what I expect--now all fell on their knees.  Our turbulent, rebellious rabble raised their hands like pleading beggars, and grave, dignified men followed their example.  Whoever saw me and Phryxus will remember us among the kneeling lickspittles;  for had we remained standing we should certainly have been dragged down.  So we followed the example of the others.\"  \"And Octavianus?\" asked Dion eagerly.  \"A man of regal bearing and youthful aspect; beardless face of the finest chiselling, a profile as beautiful as if created for the coin-maker; all the lines sharp and yet pleasing; every inch an aristocrat; but the very mirror of a cold nature, incapable of any lofty aspiration, any warm emotion, any tenderness of feeling.  All in all, a handsome, haughty, calculating man, whose friendship would hardly benefit the heart, but from whose enmity may the immortals guard all we love!  \"Again he led Arius by the hand.  The philosopher's sons followed the pair.  When he stood on the stage, looking down upon the thousands kneeling before him, not a muscle of his noble face--it is certainly that --betrayed the slightest emotion.  He gazed at us like a farmer surveying his flocks and, after a long silence, said curtly in excellent Greek that he absolved the Alexandrians from all guilt towards him: first--he counted as if he were summoning individual veterans to reward them--from respect for the illustrious founder of our city, Alexander, the conqueror of the world; secondly, because the greatness and beauty of Alexandria filled him with admiration; and, thirdly--he turned to Arius as he spoke --to give pleasure to his admirable and beloved friend.  \"Then shouts of joy burst forth.  \"Every one, from the humblest to the greatest, had had a heavy burden removed from his mind, and the throng had scarcely left the gymnasium when they were again laughing saucily enough, and there was no lack of biting and innocent jests.  \"The fat carpenter, Memnon--who furnished the wood-work for your palace-- exclaimed close beside me that formerly a dolphin had saved Arius from the pirates; now Arius was saving marine Alexandria from the robbers.  So the sport went on.  Philostratus, Barine's first husband, offered the best butt for jests.  The agitator had good reason to fear the worst; and now, clad in black mourning robes, ran after Arius, whom but a few months ago he persecuted with the most vindictive hatred, continually repeating this shallow bit of verse:            \"'If he is a wise man, let the wise aid the wise.'  \"Reaching home was not easy.  The street was swarming with Roman soldiers.  They fared well enough; for in the joy of their hearts many a prosperous citizen who saw his property saved invited individual warriors, or even a whole maniple, to the taverns or cook-shops, and the stock of wine in Alexandrian cellars will be considerably diminished to- night.  \"Many, as I have already said, had been quartered in the houses, with orders to spare the property of the citizens; and it was in this way that the misfortune with which I commenced my narrative befell the grandmother.  She died before my departure.  \"All the gates of the city will now stand open to you, and the niece of Arius and her husband will be received with ovations.  I don't grudge Barine the good fortune; for the way in which your noble wife, who had cast her spell over me too, flung aside what is always dear to the admired city beauty and found on the loneliest of islands a new world in love, is worthy of all admiration and praise.  For yourself, I dread new happiness and honours; if they are added to those which Fate bestowed upon you in such a wife and your son Pyrrhus, the gods would not be themselves if they did not pursue you with their envy.  I have less reason to fear them.\"  \"Ungrateful fellow!\" interrupted his friend.  \"There will be numerous mortals to grudge you Helena.  As for me, I have already felt many a slight foreboding; but we have already paid by no means a small tribute to the divine ones.  The lamp is still burning in the sitting-room. Inform the sisters of their grandmother's death, and tell them the pleasant tidings you have brought us, but reserve until the morning a description of the terrible scenes you witnessed.  We will not spoil their sleep.  Mark my words!  Helena's silent grief and her joy at our escape will lighten your heart.\"  And so it proved.  True, Gorgias lived over again in his dreams the frightful spectacle witnessed the day before; but when the sun of the 2d day of August rose in full radiance over Alexandria and, early in the morning, boat after boat reached the Serpent Island, landing first Berenike and her nephews, the sons of the honoured philosopher Arius, then clients, officials, and friends of Dion, and former favourite guests of Barine, to greet the young pair and escort them from the refuge which had so long sheltered them back to the city and their midst, new and pleasant impressions robbed the gloomy picture of a large portion of its terrors.  \"Tall Phryxus\" had rapidly spread the news of the place where Dion and Barine had vanished, and that they had long been happily wedded.  Many deemed it well worth a short voyage to see the actors in so strange an adventure and be the first to greet them.  Besides, those who knew Barine and her husband were curious to learn how two persons accustomed to the life of a great capital had endured for months such complete solitude. Many feared or expected to see them emaciated and careworn, haggard or sunk in melancholy, and hence there were a number of astonished faces among those whose boats the freedman Pyrrhus guided as pilot through the shallows which protected his island.
