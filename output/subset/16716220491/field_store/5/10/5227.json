Then he remembered that the doctor had gone through his pockets.  \"I can pay you for this,\" he said. \"It's very kind of you, but you mustn't think I'm penniless. I've just been too preoccupied to take care of myself.\"  \"Sure,\" said the girl. \"But we can call this an advance. I want to sign up for some classes.\"  \"Be happy to have you.\"  \"Am I bothering you?\" asked the girl. \"You said something odd when you fainted--'Orpheus.'\"  \"Did I say that? I must have been thinking of Milles' Orpheus Fountain in Copenhagen. I've seen photos, but I've never been there.\"  \"Germany? But there's nothing left of Germany.\"  \"Copenhagen's in Denmark. There's quite a lot of Denmark left. It was only on the fringes. Heavily radiated, but still there.\"  \"I want to travel, too,\" she said. \"I work at La Guardia and I've never been off, except for an orbiting excursion. I want to go to the Moon on my vacation. They give us a bonus in travel vouchers. It must be wonderful dancing under the low gravity.\"  Spaceport? Off? Low gravity? Terms belonging to the detested electronic world of the stereopantograph in which he had no place.  \"Be very interesting,\" he said, closing his eyes to conceal disgust.  \"I _am_ bothering you. I'll go away now, but I'll be back Tuesday night for the class. What time do I come and what should I bring?\"  \"Eight. It's charcoal--I sell you the sticks and paper. Just bring a smock.\"  \"All right. And I want to take the oils class, too. And I want to bring some people I know to see your work. I'm sure they'll see something they like. Austin Malone's in from Venus--he's a special friend of mine.\"  \"Lucretia,\" he said. \"Or do some people call you Lucy?\"  \"Lucy.\"  \"Will you take that little bronze you liked? As a thank you?\"  \"I can't do that!\"  \"Please. I'd feel much better about this. I really mean it.\"  She nodded abruptly, flushing, and almost ran from the room.  _Now why did I do that?_ he asked himself. He hoped it was because he liked Lucy Grumman very much. He hoped it wasn't a cold-blooded investment of a piece of sculpture that would never be sold, anyway, just to make sure she'd be back with class fees and more groceries.   III  She was back on Tuesday, a half-hour early and carrying a smock. He introduced her formally to the others as they arrived: a dozen or so bored young women who, he suspected, talked a great deal about their art lessons outside, but in class used any excuse to stop sketching.  He didn't dare show Lucy any particular consideration. There were fierce little miniature cliques in the class. Halvorsen knew they laughed at him and his line among themselves, and yet, strangely, were fiercely jealous of their seniority and right to individual attention.  The lesson was an ordeal, as usual. The model, a muscle-bound young graduate of the barbell gyms and figure-photography studios, was stupid and argumentative about ten-minute poses. Two of the girls came near a hair-pulling brawl over the rights to a preferred sketching location. A third girl had discovered Picasso's cubist period during the past week and proudly announced that she didn't _feel_ perspective in art.  But the two interminable hours finally ticked by. He nagged them into cleaning up--not as bad as the Saturdays with oils--and stood by the open door. Otherwise they would have stayed all night, cackling about absent students and snarling sulkily among themselves. His well-laid plans went sour, though. A large and flashy car drove up as the girls were leaving.  \"That's Austin Malone,\" said Lucy. \"He came to pick me up and look at your work.\"  That was all the wedge her fellow-pupils needed.  \"_Aus_-tin Ma-_lone_! _Well!_\"  \"Lucy, darling, I'd love to meet a real _spaceman_.\"  \"Roald, darling, would you mind very much if I stayed a moment?\"  \"I'm certainly not going to miss this and I don't care if you mind or not, Roald, darling!\"  Malone was an impressive figure. Halvorsen thought: he looks as though he's been run through an esthetikon set for 'brawny' and 'determined.' Lucy made a hash of the introductions and the spaceman didn't rise to conversational bait dangled enticingly by the girls.  In a clear voice, he said to Halvorsen: \"I don't want to take up too much of your time. Lucy tells me you have some things for sale. Is there any place we can look at them where it's quiet?\"  The students made sulky exits.  \"Back here,\" said the artist.  The girl and Malone followed him through the curtains. The spaceman made a slow circuit of the studio, seeming to repel questions.  He sat down at last and said: \"I don't know what to think, Halvorsen. This place stuns me. Do you _know_ you're in the Dark Ages?\"  _People who never have given a thought to Chartres and Mont St. Michel usually call it the Dark Ages_, Halvorsen thought wryly. He asked, \"Technologically, you mean? No, not at all. My plaster's better, my colors are better, my metal is better--tool metal, not casting metal, that is.\"  \"I mean _hand_ work,\" said the spaceman. \"Actually working by _hand_.\"  The artist shrugged. \"There have been crazes for the techniques of the boiler works and the machine shop,\" he admitted. \"Some interesting things were done, but they didn't stand up well. Is there anything here that takes your eye?\"  \"I like those dolphins,\" said the spaceman, pointing to a perforated terra-cotta relief on the wall. They had been commissioned by an architect, then later refused for reasons of economy when the house had run way over estimate. \"They'd look bully over the fireplace in my town apartment. Like them, Lucy?\"  \"I think they're wonderful,\" said the girl.  Roald saw the spaceman go rigid with the effort not to turn and stare at her. He loved her and he was jealous.  Roald told the story of the dolphins and said: \"The price that the architect thought was too high was three hundred and sixty dollars.\"  Malone grunted. \"Doesn't seem unreasonable--if you set a high store on inspiration.\"  \"I don't know about inspiration,\" the artist said evenly. \"But I was awake for two days and two nights shoveling coal and adjusting drafts to fire that thing in my kiln.\"  The spaceman looked contemptuous. \"I'll take it,\" he said. \"Be something to talk about during those awkward pauses. Tell me, Halvorsen, how's Lucy's work? Do you think she ought to stick with it?\"  \"Austin,\" objected the girl, \"don't be so blunt. How can he possibly know after one day?\"  \"She can't draw yet,\" the artist said cautiously. \"It's all coordination, you know--thousands of hours of practice, training your eye and hand to work together until you can put a line on paper where you want it. Lucy, if you're really interested in it, you'll learn to draw well. I don't think any of the other students will. They're in it because of boredom or snobbery, and they'll stop before they have their eye-hand coordination.\"  \"I _am_ interested,\" she said firmly.  Malone's determined restraint broke. \"Damned right you are. In--\" He recovered himself and demanded of Halvorsen: \"I understand your point about coordination. But thousands of hours when you can buy a camera? It's absurd.\"  \"I was talking about drawing, not art,\" replied Halvorsen. \"Drawing is putting a line on paper where you want it, I said.\" He took a deep breath and hoped the great distinction wouldn't sound ludicrous and trivial. \"So let's say that art is knowing how to put the line in the right place.\"  \"Be practical. There isn't any art. Not any more. I get around quite a bit and I never see anything but photos and S.P.G.s. A few heirlooms, yes, but nobody's painting or carving any more.\"  \"There's some art, Malone. My students--a couple of them in the still-life class--are quite good. There are more across the country. Art for occupational therapy, or a hobby, or something to do with the hands. There's trade in their work. They sell them to each other, they give them to their friends, they hang them on their walls. There are even some sculptors like that. Sculpture is prescribed by doctors. The occupational therapists say it's even better than drawing and painting, so some of these people work in plasticene and soft stone, and some of them get to be good.\"  \"Maybe so. I'm an engineer, Halvorsen. We glory in doing things the easy way. Doing things the easy way got me to Mars and Venus and it's going to get me to Ganymede. You're doing things the hard way, and your inefficiency has no place in this world. Look at you! You've lost a fingertip--some accident, I suppose.\"  \"I never noticed--\" said Lucy, and then let out a faint, \"Oh!\"  Halvorsen curled the middle finger of his left hand into the palm, where he usually carried it to hide the missing first joint.  \"Yes,\" he said softly. \"An accident.\"  \"Accidents are a sign of inadequate mastery of material and equipment,\" said Malone sententiously. \"While you stick to your methods and I stick to mine, _you can't compete with me_.\"  His tone made it clear that he was talking about more than engineering.  \"Shall we go now, Lucy? Here's my card, Halvorsen. Send those dolphins along and I'll mail you a check.\"   IV  The artist walked the half-dozen blocks to Mr. Krehbeil's place the next day. He found the old man in the basement shop of his fussy house, hunched over his bench with a powerful light overhead. He was trying to file a saw.  \"Mr. Krehbeil!\" Halvorsen called over the shriek of metal.  The carpenter turned around and peered with watery eyes. \"I can't see like I used to,\" he said querulously. \"I go over the same teeth on this damn saw, I skip teeth, I can't see the light shine off it when I got one set. The glare.\" He banged down his three-cornered file petulantly. \"Well, what can I do for you?\"  \"I need some crating stock. Anything. I'll trade you a couple of my maple four-by-fours.\"  The old face became cunning. \"And will you set my saw? My _saws_, I mean. It's nothing to you--an hour's work. You have the eyes.\"  Halvorsen said bitterly, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51534"],["title","Self Portrait (#1)"],["body","heartily at Len's wisecracks.         *       *       *       *       *  _October 18, 1959_  Things are shaping up in the Pro lab. Here's how I get the picture.  A year ago, the boss laid down a policy for the lab: begin with legs because, while the neuro-motor systems in legs and arms are a lot alike, those in legs are much simpler. If we build satisfactory legs, the boss figures, we can then tackle arms; the main difficulties will have been licked.  Well, last summer, in line with this approach, the Army picked out a double amputee from the outpatient department of Walter Reed Hospital--fellow by the name of Kujack, who lost both his legs in a land mine explosion outside Pyongyang--and shipped him up here to be a subject in our experiments.  When Kujack arrived, the neuro boys made a major decision. It didn't make sense, they agreed, to keep building experimental legs directly into the muscles and nerves of Kujack's stumps; the surgical procedure in these cine-plastic jobs is complicated as all getout, involves a lot of pain for the subject and, what's more to the point, means long delays each time while the tissues heal.  Instead, they hit on the idea of integrating permanent metal and plastic sockets into the stumps, so constructed that each new experimental limb can be snapped into place whenever it's ready for a trial.  By the time I took over, two weeks ago, Goldweiser had the sockets worked out and fitted to Kujack's stumps, and the muscular and neural tissues had knitted satisfactorily. There was only one hitch: twenty-three limbs had been designed, and all twenty-three had been dismal flops. That's when the boss called me in.  There's no mystery about the failures. Not to me, anyhow. Cybernetics is simply the science of building machines that will duplicate and improve on the organs and functions of the animal, based on what we know about the systems of communication and control in the animal. All right. But in any particular cybernetics project, everything depends on just how _many_ of the functions you want to duplicate, just how _much_ of the total organ you want to replace.  That's why the robot-brain boys can get such quick and spectacular results, have their pictures in the papers all the time, and become the real glamor boys of the profession. They're not asked to duplicate the human brain in its _entirety_--all they have to do is isolate and imitate one particular function of the brain, whether it's a simple operation in mathematics or a certain type of elementary logic.  The robot brain called the Eniac, for example, is exactly what its name implies--an Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, and it just has to be able to integrate and compute figures faster and more accurately than the human brain can. It doesn't have to have daydreams and nightmares, make wisecracks, suffer from anxiety, and all that. What's more, it doesn't even have to _look_ like a brain or fit into the tiny space occupied by a real brain. It can be housed in a six-story building and look like an overgrown typewriter or an automobile dashboard or even a pogo stick. All it has to do is tell you that two times two equals four, and tell you fast.  When you're told to build an artificial leg that'll take the place of a real one, the headaches begin. Your machine must not only _look_ like its living model, it must _also_ balance and support, walk, run, hop, skip, jump, etc., etc. _Also_, it must fit into the same space. _Also_, it must feel everything a real leg feels--touch, heat, cold, pain, moisture, kinesthetic sensations--_as well as_ execute all the brain-directed movements that a real leg can.  So you're not duplicating this or that function; you're reconstructing the organ in its totality, or trying to. Your pro must have a full set of sensory-motor communication systems, plus machines to carry out orders, which is impossible enough to begin with.  But our job calls for even more. The pro mustn't only _equal_ the real thing, it must be _superior_! That means creating a synthetic neuro-muscular system that actually _improves_ on the nerves and muscles Nature created in the original!  When our twenty-fourth experimental model turned out to be a dud last week--it just hung from Kujack's stump, quivering like one of my robot bedbugs, as though it had a bad case of intention tremor--Goldweiser said something that made an impression on me.  \"They don't want much from us,\" he said sarcastically. \"They just want us to be God.\"  I didn't care for his cynical attitude at all, but he had a point. Len Ellsom just has to build a fancy adding machine to get his picture in the papers. _I_ have to be God!         *       *       *       *       *  _October 22, 1959_  Don't know what to make of Kujack. His attitude is peculiar. Of course, he's very co-operative, lies back on the fitting table and doesn't even wince when we snap on the pros, and he does his best to carry out instructions. Still, there's something funny about the way he looks at me. There's a kind of malicious expression in his eyes. At times, come to think of it, he reminds me of Len.  Take this afternoon, for instance. I've just worked out an entirely different kind of leg based on a whole new arrangement of solenoids to duplicate the muscle systems, and I decided to give it a try. When I was slipping the model into place, I looked up and caught Kujack's eye for a moment. He seemed to be laughing at something, although his face was expressionless.  \"All right,\" I said. \"Let's make a test. I understand you used to be quite a football player. Well, just think of how you used to kick a football and try to do it now.\"  He really seemed to be trying; the effort made him sweat. All that happened, though, was that the big toe wriggled a little and the knee buckled. Dud Number Twenty-five. I was sore, of course, especially when I noticed that Kujack was more amused than ever.  \"You seem to think something's pretty funny,\" I said.  \"Don't get me wrong, Doc,\" he said, much too innocently. \"It's just that I've been thinking. Maybe you'd have more luck if you thought of me as a bedbug.\"  \"Where did you get that idea?\"  \"From Doc Ellsom. I was having some beers with him the other night. He's got a very high opinion of you, says you build the best bedbugs in the business.\"  I find it hard to believe that Len Ellsom would say anything really nice about me. Must be his guilt about Marilyn that makes him talk that way. I don't like his hanging around Kujack.         *       *       *       *       *  _October 25, 1959_  The boss came along on our woodcutting expedition this morning and volunteered to work the other end of my two-handled saw. He asked how things were coming in the Pro lab.  \"As I see it,\" I said, \"there are two sides to the problem, the kinesthetic and the neural. We're making definite progress on the K side--I've worked out a new solenoid system, with some miniature motors tied in, and I think it'll give us a leg that _moves_ damned well. I don't know about the N side, though. It's pretty tough figuring out how to hook the thing up electrically with the central nervous system so that the brain can control it. Some sort of compromise system of operation, along mechanical rather than neural lines, would be a lot simpler.\"  \"You mean,\" the boss said with a smile, \"that it's stumping you.\"  I was relieved to see him taking it so well because I know how anxious he is to get results from the Pro lab. Since Pro is one of the few things going on at IFACS that can be talked about, he's impatient for us to come up with something he can release to the press. As the public relations officer explained it to me at dinner the other night, people get worried when they know there's something like IFACS going, but don't get any real information about it, so the boss, naturally, wants to relieve the public's curiosity with a good, reassuring story about our work.  I knew I was taking an awful chance spilling the whole K-N thing to him the way I did, but I had to lay the groundwork for a little plan I've just begun to work on.  \"By the way, sir,\" I said, \"I ran into Len Ellsom the other day. I didn't know he was here.\"  \"Do you know him?\" the boss said. \"Good man. One of the best brains-and-games men you'll find anywhere.\"  I explained that Len had gotten his degree at M.I.T. the year before I did. From what I'd heard, I added, he'd done some important work on the Remington-Rand ballistics computer.  \"He did indeed,\" the boss said, \"but that's not the half of it. After that he made some major contributions to the robot chess player. As a matter of fact, that's why he's here.\"  I said I hadn't heard about the chess player.  \"As soon as it began to play a really good game of chess, Washington put the whole thing under wraps for security reasons. Which is why you won't hear any more about it from me.\"  I'm no Eniac, but I can occasionally put two and two together myself. If the boss's remarks mean anything, they mean that an electronic brain capable of playing games has been developed, and that it's led to something important militarily. Of course! I could kick myself for not having guessed it before.  Brains-and-games--that's what MS is all about, obviously. It had to happen: out of the mathematical analysis of chess came a robot chess player, and out of the chess player came some kind of mechanical brain that's useful in military strategy. _That's_ what Len Ellsom's in the middle of.  \"Really brilliant mind,\" the boss said after we'd sawed for a while. \"Keen. But he's a little erratic--quirky, queer sense of humor. Isn't that your impression?\"  \"Definitely,\" I said. \"I'd be the last one in the world to say a word against Len, but he was always a little peculiar. Very gay one moment and very sour the next, and inclined to poke fun at things other people take seriously. He used to write poetry.\"  \"I'm very glad to know that,\" the boss said. \"Confirms my own feeling about him.\""]]]
