It was dark when for the first time she turned her head toward the camp-fire and stared curiously at the figure there. The appetizing odor of broiling bacon had drawn her attention, and as if no move went unnoticed the man said, without lifting his eyes:  \"Let 'em soak! Supper'll be ready directly. How'd you like your eggs--if we had any?\"  Evidently he expected no reply, for after a chuckle he began to whistle softly, in a peculiarly clear and liquid tone, almost like some bird-call. He had spoken with an unmistakable Texas drawl; the woman put him down at once for a cowboy. She settled her back against a boulder and rested.  The pool had become black and mysterious, the sky was studded with stars when he called her, and she laboriously drew on her stockings and boots. Well back from the fire he had arranged a seat for her, using a saddle-blanket for a covering, and upon this she lowered herself stiffly. As she did so she took fuller notice of the man, and found his appearance reassuring.  \"I suppose you wonder how I--happen to be here,\" she said.  \"Now don't talk 'til you're rested, miss. This coffee is strong enough to walk on its hands, and I reckon about two cups of it'll rastle you into shape.\" As she raised the tin mug to her lips he waved a hand and smiled. \"Drink hearty!\" He set a plate of bread and bacon in her lap, then opened a glass jar of jam. \"Here's the dulces. I've got a sort of sweet tooth in my head. I reckon you'll have to make out with this, 'cause I rode in too late to rustle any fresh meat, and the delivery-wagon won't be 'round before morning.\" So saying, he withdrew to the fire.  The woman ate and drank slowly. She was too tired to be hungry, and meanwhile the young man squatted upon his heels and watched her through the smoke from a husk cigarette. It was perhaps fortunate for her peace of mind that she could not correctly interpret his expression, for had she been able to do so she would have realized something of the turmoil into which her presence had thrown him. He was accustomed to meeting men in unexpected places--even in the desert's isolation--but to have a night camp in the chaparral invaded by a young and unescorted woman, to have a foot-sore goddess stumble out of the dark and collapse into his arms, was a unique experience and one calculated to disturb a person of his solitary habits.  \"Have you had your supper?\" she finally inquired.  \"Who, me? Oh, I'll eat with the help.\" He smiled, and when his flashing teeth showed white against his leathery tan the woman decided he was not at all bad-looking. He was very tall and quite lean, with the long legs of a horseman--this latter feature accentuated by his high-heeled boots and by the short canvas cowboy coat that reached only to his cartridge-belt. His features she could not well make out, for the fire was little more than a bed of coals, and he fed it, Indian-like, with a twig or two at a time.  \"I beg your pardon. I'm selfish.\" She extended her cup and plate as an invitation for him to share their contents. \"Please eat with me.\"  But he refused. \"I ain't hungry,\" he affirmed. \"Honest!\"  Accustomed as she was to the diffidence of ranch-hands, she refrained from urging him, and proceeded with her repast. When she had finished she lay back and watched him as he ate sparingly.  \"My horse fell crossing the Arroyo Grande,\" she announced, abruptly. \"He broke a leg, and I had to shoot him.\"  \"Is there any water in the Grande?\" asked the man.  \"No. They told me there was plenty. I knew of this charco, so I made for it.\"  \"Who told you there was water in the arroyo?\"  \"Those Mexicans at the little-goat ranch.\"  \"Balli. So you walked in from Arroyo Grande. Lord! It's a good ten miles straightaway, and I reckon you came crooked. Eh?\"  \"Yes. And it was very hot. I was never here but once, and--the country looks different when you're afoot.\"  \"It certainly does,\" the man nodded. Then he continued, musingly: \"No water there, eh? I figured there might be a little.\" The fact appeared to please him, for he nodded again as he went on with his meal. \"Not much rain down here, I reckon.\"  \"Very little. Where are you from?\"  \"Me? Hebbronville. My name is Law.\"  Evidently, thought the woman, this fellow belonged to the East outfit, or some of the other big cattle-ranches in the Hebbronville district. Probably he was a range boss or a foreman. After a time she said, \"I suppose the nearest ranch is that Balli place?\"  \"Yes'm.\"  \"I'd like to borrow your horse.\"  Mr. Law stared into his plate. \"Well, miss, I'm afraid--\"  She added, hastily, \"I'll send you a fresh one by Balli's boy in the morning.\"  He looked up at her from under the brim of his hat. \"D'you reckon you could find that goat-ranch by star-light, miss?\"  The woman was silent.  \"'Ain't you just about caught up on traveling, for one day?\" he asked. \"I reckon you need a good rest about as much as anybody I ever saw. You can have my blanket, you know.\"  The prospect was unwelcome, yet she reluctantly agreed. \"Perhaps-- Then in the morning--\"  Law shook his head. \"I can't loan you my horse, miss. I've got to stay right here.\"  \"But Balli's boy could bring him back.\"  \"I got to meet a man.\"  \"Here?\"  \"Yes'm.\"  \"When will he come?\"  \"He'd ought to be here at early dark to-morrow evening.\" Heedless of her dismay, he continued, \"Yes'm, about sundown.\"  \"But--I can't stay here. I'll ride to Balli's and have your horse back by afternoon.\"  \"My man might come earlier than I expect,\" Mr. Law persisted.  \"Really, I can't see what difference it would make. It wouldn't interfere with your appointment to let me--\"  Law smiled slowly, and, setting his plate aside, selected a fresh cigarette; then as he reached for a coal he explained:  \"I haven't got what you'd exactly call an appointment. This feller I'm expectin' is a Mexican, and day before yesterday he killed a man over in Jim Wells County. They got me by 'phone at Hebbronville and told me he'd left. He's headin' for the border, and he's due here about sundown, now that Arroyo Grande's dry. I was aimin' to let you ride his horse.\"  \"Then--you're an officer?\"  \"Yes'm. Ranger. So you see I can't help you to get home till my man comes. Do you live around here?\" The speaker looked up inquiringly, and after an instant's hesitation the woman said, quietly:  \"I am Mrs. Austin.\" She was grateful for the gloom that hid her face. \"I rode out this way to examine a tract of grazing-land.\"  It seemed fully a minute before the Ranger answered; then he said, in a casual tone, \"I reckon Las Palmas is quite a ranch, ma'am.\"  \"Yes. But we need more pasture.\"  \"I know your La Feria ranch, too. I was with General Castro when we had that fight near there.\"  \"You were a Maderista?\"  \"Yes'm. Machine-gun man. That's a fine country over there. Seems like God Almighty got mixed and put the Mexicans on the wrong side of the Rio Grande. But I reckon you haven't seen much of La Feria since the last revolution broke out.\"  \"No. We have tried to remain neutral, but--\" Again she hesitated. \"Mr. Austin has enemies. Fortunately both sides have spared La Feria.\"  Law shrugged his broad shoulders. \"Oh, well, the revolution isn't over! A ranch in Mexico is my idea of a bad investment.\" He rose and, taking his blanket, sought a favorable spot upon which to spread it. Then he helped Mrs. Austin to her feet--her muscles had stiffened until she could barely stand--after which he fetched his saddle for a pillow. He made no apologies for his meager hospitality, nor did his guest expect any.  When he had staked out his horse for the night he returned to find the woman rolled snugly in her covering, as in a cocoon. The dying embers flickered into flame and lit her hair redly. She had laid off her felt Stetson, and one loosened braid lay over her hard pillow. Thinking her asleep, Law stood motionless, making no attempt to hide his expression of wonderment until, unexpectedly, she spoke.  \"What will you do with me when your Mexican comes?\" she said.  \"Well, ma'am, I reckon I'll hide you out in the brush till I tame him. I hope you sleep well.\"  \"Thank you. I'm used to the open.\"  He nodded as if he well knew that she was; then, shaking out his slicker, turned away.  As he lay staring up through the thorny mesquite branches that roofed him inadequately from the dew he marveled mightily. A bright, steady-burning star peeped through the leaves at him, and as he watched it he remembered that this red-haired woman with the still, white face was known far and wide through the lower valley as \"The Lone Star.\" Well, he mused, the name fitted her; she was, if reports were true, quite as mysterious, quite as cold and fixed and unapproachable, as the title implied. Knowledge of her identity had come as a shock, for Law knew something of her history, and to find her suing for his protection was quite thrilling. Tales of her pale beauty were common and not tame, but she was all and more than she had been described. And yet why had no one told him she was so young? This woman's youth and attractiveness amazed him; he felt that he had made a startling discovery. Was she so cold, after all, or was she merely reserved? Red hair above a pure white face; a woman's form wrapped in his blanket; ripe red lips caressing the rim of his mean drinking-cup! Those were things to think about. Those were pictures for a lonely man.  She had not been too proud and cold to let him help her. In her fatigue she had allowed him to lift her and to make her more comfortable. Hot against his palms--palms unaccustomed to the touch of woman's flesh--he felt the contact of her naked feet, as at the moment when he had placed them in the cooling water. Her feeble resistance had only called attention to her sex--to the slim whiteness of her ankles beneath her short riding-skirt.  Following his first amazement at beholding her had come a fantastic explanation of her presence--"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5099"],["title","Heart of the Sunset (#2)"],["body","a moment or two it had seemed as if the fates had taken heed of his yearnings and had sent her to him out of the dusk--wild fancies, like these, bother men who are much alone. Of course he had not dreamed that she was the mistress of Las Palmas. That altered matters, and yet--they were to spend a long idle day together. If the Mexican did not come, another night like this would follow, and she was virtually his prisoner. Perhaps, after all--  Dave Law stirred nervously and sighed.  \"Don't this beat hell?\" he murmured.     II  THE AMBUSH   Alaire Austin slept badly. The day's hardships had left their traces. The toxins of fatigue not only poisoned her muscles with aches and pains, but drugged her brain and rendered the night a long succession of tortures during which she experienced for a second time the agonies of thirst and fatigue and despair. Extreme physical ordeals, like profound emotional upheavals, leave imprints upon the brain, and while the body may recover quickly, it often requires considerable time to rest exhausted nerves. The finer the nervous organism, the slower is the process of recuperation. Like most normal women, Alaire had a surprising amount of endurance, both nervous and muscular, but, having drawn heavily against her reserve force, she paid the penalty. During the early hours of the night she slept hardly at all, and as soon as her bodily discomfort began to decrease her mind became unruly. Twice she rose and limped to the water-hole for a drink, and it was not until nearly dawn that she dropped off into complete unconsciousness. She was awakened by a sunbeam which pierced her leafy shelter and with hot touch explored her upturned face.  It was still early; the sun had just cleared the valley's rim and the ground was damp with dew. Somewhere near by an unfamiliar bird was sweetly trilling. Alaire listened dreamily until the bird-carol changed to the air of a familiar cowboy song, then she sat up, queerly startled.  David Law was watering his horse, grooming the animal meanwhile with a burlap doth. Such attention was unusual in a stock country where horses run wild, but this horse, Mrs. Austin saw, justified unusual care. It was a beautiful blood-bay mare, and as the woman looked it lifted its head, then with wet, trembling muzzle caressed its owner's cheek. Undoubtedly this attention was meant for a kiss, and was as daintily conferred as any woman's favor. It brought a reward in a lump of sugar. There followed an exhibition of equine delight; the mare's lips twitched, her nose wrinkled ludicrously, she stretched her neck and tossed her head as the sweetness tickled her palate. Even the nervous switching of her tail was eloquent of pleasure. Meanwhile the owner showed his white teeth in a smile.  \"Good morning,\" said Mrs. Austin.  Law lifted his hat in a graceful salute as he approached around the edge of the pool, his spurs jingling musically. The mare followed.  \"You have a fine horse, there.\"  \"Yes'm. Her and me get along all right. I hope we didn't wake you, ma'am.\"  \"No. I was too tired to sleep well.\"  \"Of course. I heard you stirring about during the night.\" Law paused, and the mare, with sharp ears cocked forward, looked over his shoulder inquisitively. \"Tell the lady good morning, Bessie Belle,\" he directed. The animal flung its head high, then stepped forward and, stretching its neck, sniffed doubtfully at the visitor.  \"What a graceful bow!\" Mrs. Austin laughed. \"You taught her that, I presume.\"  \"Yes'm! She'd never been to school when I got her; she was plumb ignorant. But she's got all the airs of a fine lady now. Sometimes I go without sugar, but Bessie Belle never does.\"  \"And you with a sweet tooth!\"  The Ranger smiled pleasantly. \"She's as easy as a rockin'-chair. We're kind of sweethearts. Ain't we, kid?\" Again Bessie Belle tossed her head high. \"That's 'yes,' with the reverse English,\" the speaker explained. \"Now you just rest yourself, ma'am, and order your breakfast. What 'll it be--quail, dove, or cottontail?\"  \"Why--whatever you can get.\"  \"That ain't the kind of restaurant we run. Bessie Belle would sure be offended if she understood you. Ever see anybody call a quail?\"  \"Can it really be done?\"  Law's face brightened. \"You wait.\" He led his mare down the arroyo, then returned, and, taking his Winchester from its scabbard, explained: \"There's a pair of 'top-knots' on that side-hill waitin' for a drink. Watch 'em run into my lap when I give the distress signal of our secret order.\" He skirted the water-hole, and seated himself with his heels together and his elbows propped upon his spread knees in the military position for close shooting. From where he sat he commanded an unobstructed view of the thicket's edge. Next he moistened his lips and uttered an indescribable low whistle. At intervals he repeated the call, while the woman looked on with interest. Suddenly out of the grass burst a blue quail, running with wings outstretched and every feather ruffled angrily. It paused, the man's cheeks snuggled against the stock of his gun, and the bark of the thirty-thirty sounded loudly. Mrs. Austin saw that he had shot the little bird's head off. She spoke, but he stilled her with a gesture, threw in a second shell, and repeated his magic call. There was a longer wait this time, but finally the performance was repeated. The marksman rose, picked up the two birds, and came back to the camping-place.  \"Kind of a low-down trick when they've just started housekeeping, ain't it?\" he smiled.  Mrs. Austin saw that both crested heads had been cleanly severed. \"That is quite wonderful\" she said. \"You must be an unusually good shot.\"  \"Yes'm. You can fool turkeys the same way. Turkeys are easy.\"  \"What do you say to them? What brings them out, all ruffled up?\" she asked, curiously.  Law had one of the birds picked by this time. \"I tell 'em a snake has got me. I reckon each one thinks the other is in trouble and comes to the rescue. Anyhow, it's a mighty mean trick.\"  He would not permit her to help with the breakfast, so she lay back enjoying the luxury of her hard bed and watching her host, whose personality, now that she saw him by daylight, had begun to challenge her interest. Of late years she had purposely avoided men, and circumstances had not permitted her to study those few she had been forced to meet; but now that fate had thrown her into the company of this stranger, she permitted some play to her curiosity.  Physically Law was of an admirable make--considerably over six feet in height, with wide shoulders and lean, strong limbs. Although his face was schooled to mask all but the keenest emotions, the deftness of his movements was eloquent, betraying that complete muscular and nervous control which comes from life in the open. A pair of blue-gray, meditative eyes, with a whimsical fashion of wrinkling half-shut when he talked, relieved a countenance that otherwise would have been a trifle grim and somber. The nose was prominent and boldly arched, the ears large and pronounced and standing well away from the head; the mouth was thin-lipped and mobile. Alaire tried to read that bronzed visage, with little success until she closed her eyes and regarded the mental image. Then she found the answer: Law had the face and the head of a hunter. The alert ears, the watchful eyes, the predatory nose were like those of some hunting animal. Yes, that was decidedly the strongest impression he gave. And yet in his face there was nothing animal in a bad sense. Certainly it showed no grossness. The man was wild, untamed, rather than sensual, and despite his careless use of the plains vernacular he seemed to be rather above the average in education and intelligence. At any rate, without being stupidly tongue-tied, he knew enough to remain silent when there was nothing to say, and that was a blessing, for Mrs. Austin herself was not talkative, and idle chatter distressed her.  On the whole, when Alaire had finished her analysis she rather resented the good impression Law had made upon her, for on general principles she chose to dislike and distrust men. Rising, she walked painfully to the pond and made a leisurely toilet.  Breakfast was ready when she returned, and once more the man sat upon his heels and smoked while she ate. Alaire could not catch his eyes upon her, except when he spoke, at which time his gaze was direct and open; yet never did she feel free from his intensest observation.  After a while she remarked: \"I'm glad to see a Ranger in this county. There has been a lot of stealing down our way, and the Association men can't seem to stop it. Perhaps you can.\"  \"The Rangers have a reputation in that line,\" he admitted. \"But there is stealing all up and down the border, since the war. You lost any stuff?\"  \"Yes. Mostly horses.\"  \"Sure! They need horses in Mexico.\"  \"The ranchers have organized. They have formed a sort of vigilance committee in each town, and talk of using bloodhounds.\"  \"Bloodhounds ain't any good, outside of novels. If beef got scarce, them Greasers would steal the dogs and eat 'em.\" He added, meditatively, \"Dog ain't such bad eatin', either.\"  \"Have you tried it?\"  Mr. Law nodded. \"It was better than some of the army beef we got in the Philippines.\" Then, in answer to her unspoken inquiry, \"Yes'm, I served an enlistment there.\"  \"You--were a private soldier?\"  \"Yes'm.\"  Mrs. Austin was incredulous, and yet she could not well express her surprise without too personal an implication. \"I can't imagine anybody--that is, a man like you, as a common soldier.\"  \"Well, I wasn't exactly that,\" he grinned. \"No, I was about the most UNcommon soldier out there. I had a speakin' acquaintance with most of the guard-houses in the islands before I got through.\"  \"But why did you enlist--a man like you?\"  \"Why?\" He pondered the question. \"I was young. I guess I needed the excitement. I have to get about so much or I don't enjoy my food.\"  \"Did you join the Maderistas for"]]]
