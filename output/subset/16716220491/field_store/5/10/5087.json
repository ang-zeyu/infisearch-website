That does not mean that each must enjoy an equal voice, but it does mean that each must be heard.  Last November, Prime Minister Attlee, Prime Minister MacKenzie King, and I announced our proposal that a commission be established within the framework of the United Nations to explore the problems of effective international control of atomic energy.  The Soviet Union, France, and China have joined us in the purpose of introducing in the General Assembly a resolution for the establishment of such a commission. Our earnest wish is that the work of this commission go forward carefully and thoroughly, but with the greatest dispatch. I have great hope for the development of mutually effective safeguards which will permit the fullest international control of this new atomic force.  I believe it possible that effective means can be developed through the United Nations Organization to prohibit, outlaw, and prevent the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes.  The power which the United States demonstrated during the war is the fact that underlies every phase of our relations with other countries. We cannot escape the responsibility which it thrusts upon us. What we think, plan, say, and do is of profound significance to the future of every corner of the world.  The great and dominant objective of United States foreign policy is to build and preserve a just peace. The peace we seek is not peace for twenty years. It is permanent peace. At a time when massive changes are occurring with lightning speed throughout the world, it is often difficult to perceive how this central objective is best served in one isolated complex situation or another. Despite this very real difficulty, there are certain basic propositions to which the United States adheres and to which we shall continue to adhere.  One proposition is that lasting peace requires genuine understanding and active cooperation among the most powerful nations. Another is that even the support of the strongest nations cannot guarantee a peace unless it is infused with the quality of justice for all nations.  On October 27, 1945, I made, in New York City, the following public statement of my understanding of the fundamental foreign policy of the United States. I believe that policy to be in accord with the opinion of the Congress and of the people of the United States. I believe that that policy carries out our fundamental objectives.  1. We seek no territorial expansion or selfish advantage. We have no plans for aggression against any other state, large or small. We have no objective which need clash with the peaceful aims of any other nation.  2. We believe in the eventual return of sovereign rights and self-government to all peoples who have been deprived of them by force.  3. We shall approve no territorial changes in any friendly part of the world unless they accord with the freely expressed wishes of the people concerned.  4. We believe that all peoples who are prepared for self-government should be permitted to choose their own form of government by their own freely expressed choice, without interference from any foreign source. That is true in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, as well as in the Western Hemisphere.  5. By the combined and cooperative action of our war allies, we shall help the defeated enemy states establish peaceful democratic governments of their own free choice. And we shall try to attain a world in which nazism, fascism, and military aggression cannot exist.  6. We shall refuse to recognize any government imposed upon any nation by the force of any foreign power. In some cases it may be impossible to prevent forceful imposition of such a government. But the United States will not recognize any such government.  7. We believe that all nations should have the freedom of the seas and equal rights to the navigation of boundary rivers and waterways and of rivers and waterways which pass through more than one country.  8. We believe that all states which are accepted in the society of nations should have access on equal terms to the trade and the raw materials of the world.  9. We believe that the sovereign states of the Western Hemisphere, without interference from outside the Western Hemisphere, must work together as good neighbors in the solution of their common problems.  10. We believe that full economic collaboration between all nations, great and small, is essential to the improvement of living conditions all over the world, and to the establishment of freedom from fear and freedom from want.  11. We shall continue to strive to promote freedom of expression and freedom of religion throughout the peace-loving areas of the world.  12. We are convinced that the preservation of peace between nations requires a United Nations Organization composed of all the peace-loving nations of the world who are willing jointly to use force, if necessary, to insure peace.  That is our foreign policy.  We may not always fully succeed in our objectives. There may be instances where the attainment of those objectives is delayed. But we will not give our full sanction and approval to actions which fly in the face of these ideals.  The world has a great stake in the political and economic future of Germany. The Allied Control Council has now been in operation there for a substantial period of time. It has not met with unqualified success. The accommodation of varying views of four governments in the day-to-day civil administration of occupied territory is a challenging task. In my judgment, however, the Council has made encouraging progress in the face of most serious difficulties. It is my purpose at the earliest practicable date to transfer from military to civilian personnel the execution of United States participation in the government of occupied territory in Europe. We are determined that effective control shall be maintained in Germany until we are satisfied that the German people have regained the right to a place of honor and respect.  On the other side of the world, a method of international cooperation has recently been agreed upon for the treatment of Japan. In this pattern of control, the United States, with the full approval of its partners, has retained primary authority and primary responsibility. It will continue to do so until the Japanese people, by their own freely expressed choice, choose their own form of government.  Our basic policy in the Far East is to encourage the development of a strong, independent, united, and democratic China. That has been the traditional policy of the United States.  At Moscow the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and Great Britain agreed to further this development by supporting the efforts of the national government and nongovernmental Chinese political elements in bringing about cessation of civil strife and in broadening the basis of representation in the Government. That is the policy which General Marshall is so ably executing today.  It is the purpose of the Government of the United States to proceed as rapidly as is practicable toward the restoration of the sovereignty of Korea and the establishment of a democratic government by the free choice of the people of Korea.  At the threshold of every problem which confronts us today in international affairs is the appalling devastation, hunger, sickness, and pervasive human misery that mark so many areas of the world.  By joining and participating in the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration the United States has directly recognized and assumed an obligation to give such relief assistance as is practicable to millions of innocent and helpless victims of the war. The Congress has earned the gratitude of the world by generous financial contributions to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.  We have taken the lead, modest though it is, in facilitating under our existing immigration quotas the admission to the United States of refugees and displaced persons from Europe.  We have joined with Great Britain in the organization of a commission to study the problem of Palestine. The Commission is already at work and its recommendations will be made at an early date.  The members of the United Nations have paid us the high compliment of choosing the United States as the site of the United Nations headquarters. We shall be host in spirit as well as in fact, for nowhere does there abide a fiercer determination that this peace shall live than in the hearts of the American people.  It is the hope of all Americans that in time future historians will speak not of World War I and World War II, but of the first and last world wars.  2. FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY  The foreign economic policy of the United States is designed to promote our own prosperity, and at the same time to aid in the restoration and expansion of world markets and to contribute thereby to world peace and world security. We shall continue our efforts to provide relief from the devastation of war, to alleviate the sufferings of displaced persons, to assist in reconstruction and development, and to promote the expansion of world trade.  We have already joined the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We have expanded the Export-Import Bank and provided it with additional capital. The Congress has renewed the Trade Agreements Act which provides the necessary framework within which to negotiate a reduction of trade barriers on a reciprocal basis. It has given our support to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.  In accordance with the intentions of the Congress, lend-lease, except as to continuing military lend-lease in China, was terminated upon the surrender of Japan. The first of the lend-lease settlement agreements has been completed with the United Kingdom."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50400"],["title","Dave Dawson, Flight Lieutenant (#1)"],["body"," be sure that it'll be something like capturing two whole Nazi Staffels complete with equipment, or kidnapping Hitler, Goering, and Himmler, and bringing them back here to England to keep Rudolph Hess company. And chances are, it'll be something even more difficult. You know, Group Captain Ball has been given a standing order at Air Ministry.\"  \"A standing order, sir?\" Phipps echoed with a blank look.  Squadron Leader Markham crushed out his cigarette and stood up.  \"I suspect it, anyway!\" he mumbled and stared fixedly at the huge pin-pointed map of Europe on the opposite wall. \"I believe he has orders to think up the strangest, the riskiest, and the craziest patrol assignments. And then pass them out to poor blasted beggars like us. Well, I suppose a lot of chaps have got to take-off and get themselves killed before this confounded war is won. But it's a rum business, Phipps. Always bear that in mind.\"  \"Yes sir, I will,\" the Adjutant said and shook his head sadly from side to side as Markham walked out of the office.  When the door slammed shut Adjutant Phipps sighed heavily, leaned back in his chair and stroked his greying hair.  \"Yes, I should have joined the artillery,\" he murmured. \"I'm too old to understand these brave young lads who wear wings. They're chaps from another world, I fancy.\"     CHAPTER TWO  _A Present from Satan_   Out on the tarmac of Eighty-Four Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer stood peeling off their flying gear and feasting their eyes on the new Mark 5 Spitfires. Lights of joy danced in their eyes, and their faces were flushed with excitement and eagerness for the future to become the present in a hurry.  \"That _is_ an airplane!\" Dave cried and slung his parachute pack up into the pit. \"That's a dream. The sugar in my coffee. The moonlight on a summer night. The smell of a lovely rose. The goal from the field in the last ten seconds of play. The whozit of the whatzit. And how!\"  Freddy looked at him and sighed unhappily.  \"And he was such a bright chap before he took that Mark Five up for a test hop!\" he murmured. \"He could count all the way up to ten. He could write his own name. And he even knew what day of the month it was. But, now.... O well! They say his kind last just so long. And, of course, he's a blinking Yank at heart. So.... Hey! Ouch!\"  The swinging Mae West life preserver jacket caught Freddy on the ear, and almost toppled him off his feet. He caught himself in time, ducked as the Mae West came sailing around again, and charged at his best pal. Dave backed up and stepped quickly to the side.  \"You had that coming to you, my little man,\" he said sternly. \"You should learn to understand expressions of beauty.\"  \"Sugar in his coffee!\" the English youth snorted. \"Moonlight on a summer night! Good grief! Whoever heard of such things?\"  \"Oh, I've got lots more of them,\" Dave chuckled. \"Better ones, too. Listen.\"  \"Don't!\" Freddy groaned.  Dave ignored him and stuck one hand inside his tunic and extended the other palm up toward the nearest Spitfire.  \"A Mark Five is the lace in your shoe!\" he cried. \"It is the frosting on mother's cake. It is the apple in her dumpling pie. It is the breath of spring. It is the kiss of your girl. It is....\"  Dave stopped short and shook his head.  \"No, that's wrong,\" he said. \"No girl would kiss that map of yours, Freddy. They'd.... Hey! So I'm talking to myself, huh?\"  It was true. Dave was simply throwing beautiful words at free air. Freddy had left him cold and walked over to Flight Lieutenant Barker, who had led the test hop patrol. Dave went over there scowling.  \"Fine business!\" he growled. \"I try to better his education and he walks out on me!\"  Freddy snorted in disgust and Flight Lieutenant Barker grinned.  \"You've got a bite, Dawson?\" he asked. \"Fleas, perhaps?\"  \"Huh, me?\" Dave echoed, and then turned beet red.  He still had one hand stuck inside his tunic. He pulled it out and they all laughed.  \"No kidding, though, Flight Lieutenant,\" he said. \"Isn't that Mark Five the best thing that ever came down the pike?\"  \"Down the pike?\" the senior officer murmured. Then brightening, \"Oh yes, I get what you mean. Quite! Best bus in the R.A.F. I'm all for having a go at a Jerry or two right now. I think we'll sweep the skies with the Mark Fives. But I hear that even better planes are on the drafting boards right now.\"  \"Phew, that's hard to believe!\" Freddy breathed. \"I mean, that anything could be better than the Mark Five.\"  \"Shame, Farmer!\" Barker said with a grin. \"And that statement from the lips of an Englishman!\"  \"Is he?\" Dave asked with a mock gasp.  \"Is he what?\" Barker wanted to know.  \"Is Freddy really and truly an Englishman?\" Dave replied and set himself to jump fast. \"From the way his eyes slant up, I'd always thought that he was a little bit....\"  Dave didn't finish the rest. And it was not Freddy making a dive for him that choked off his words. On the contrary it was the wail of the alarm siren mounted atop the Operations Office. As one man the three spun around and dashed over to the little hut that was the nerve center of the Squadron. And so did every other pilot on stand-to duty.  The Operations Officer met them at the door. He waved a slip of paper at them.  \"Zone Ten Spotters!\" he snapped. \"A single Messerschmitt One-Ten sneaking in from the coast. Altitude twenty one thousand. Course, due west. Intercept and teach the beggar a lesson. Chap's balmy to try it alone these days. Off with you. I'll give you further spotter reports in the air.\"  The half dozen pilots turned from the Operations Office door and raced back to the line of Spitfires. Mechanics already had the propellers ticking over. Dave skidded to a halt by his ship and practically jumped into the parachute harness and Mae West that his own mechanic held up for him. Then in a single leap he vaulted into the pit, snapped his safety harness in place, plugged in his radio jack, and reached for the throttle.  \"Get one of the dirty beggars for me, sir!\" the mechanic cried out. \"I come from Coventry, you know, sir!\"  \"Fair enough!\" Dave yelled and sent the Mark 5 Spitfire streaking straight out across the field. \"One Messerschmitt coming up, for Coventry! I mean, coming _down_!\"  Split seconds after the words popped off his lips he was in the air with wheels up, and curving up and around toward Zone 10. He did not have to glance at his map to determine the location of Zone 10. Its location, like the locations of all the zones that Eighty-Four guarded, was stamped indelibly on his brain. Zone 10 was on the coast south of Harwich, and he headed in that direction at top speed.  Out the corner of his eye he saw the other planes of the flight streaking along in the same direction. He grinned and jammed his hand against the already wide open throttle as though in so doing he might get more power out of the singing Rolls-Royce in the nose. And he knew that Freddy, Flight Lieutenant Barker, and the three other Spitfire pilots were doing the same thing. If the alarm had said two or more enemy aircraft were sighted the Eighty-Four lads would have dropped into formations of flights of three with Barker giving the orders for attack and so forth. That wasn't necessary, however, with just one lone Jerry plane in the offing. Instead, it was a case of first come, first crack at the Jerry. And so the six Eighty-Four lads were hopping their planes along as fast as they could so that they might be the one to get first licks at the Messerschmitt. True, that sort of thing wasn't strictly regulations, but the R.A.F. lads did it ... and often.  \"Ten shillings says you guys are wasting your time!\" Dave shouted happily into his radio mike.  \"Ten shillings says you've forgotten there's lots of radios in England, Dawson!\" Flight Lieutenant Barker snapped back at him in the earphones.  Dave gulped and went beet red to the roots of his hair. In his excitement he had clean forgotten that ground stations are tuned in on aircraft aloft all the time. Whatever is said up there goes right into the ears of the big shots, if they happen to be listening.  \"I mean when the formation reaches the objective!\" Dave said hurriedly. \"One Mark Five is more than enough for any One-Ten!\"  Barker's laugh came over the radio.  \"That's nice quick thinking, Dawson,\" he said. \"No wonder you've got more than a couple of the beggars in your bag.\"  \"Luck! Absolutely nothing else. I was present each time!\"  The voice was Freddy Farmer's. Dave opened his mouth to make a fitting retort, but checked himself. At that instant he heard the voice of the Operations officer back down on the field.  \"Tiger Flight!\" he called, using the code name for the patrol in the air. \"Change course twenty degrees north. Clouds ahead of you. Enemy aircraft climbing to twenty-four thousand. Operations to Tiger. That is all!\"  \"Tiger to Operations!\" Dave heard Flight Lieutenant Barker check back. \"Changing course. Right you are!\"  Dave had already swung his ship around more to the north, and was hunched forward over the stick staring hard at the mountain cloud bank looming up ahead. His eagle eyes swept it from side to side and from top to bottom. But he failed to see a single moving dot that could be the Messerschmitt One-Ten trying to climb up over the stuff. He saw nothing but that bank of clouds and the crazy shadows that marked nature's nooks and crags in the stuff.  And then he heard Freddy Farmer's excited voice coming into his earphones.  \"Enemy aircraft sighted! Five more degrees northward. Just under the tip of that finger of the stuff on the left!\"  Dave snapped his gaze in the direction indicated, and then suddenly saw the blurred dot curving upward and to the north. He grinned and gave a little shake of his head.  \"Old Sharp Eyes Freddy Farmer!\" he grunted. \"Boy! How does he do it?\"  \"Simple!\" the radio's earphones told him instantly. \"I jolly well fly with my eyes _open_. Try it sometime, old bean. You'll be surprised at the"]]]
