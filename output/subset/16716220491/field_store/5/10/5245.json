And the percentage of crimes had dwindled even more with the appearance of the robot police officers. Many a criminal in the past had gambled that he could outshoot a pursuing policeman. But the robots were different: they weren't flesh and blood. Bullets bounced off them and their aim was infallible.         *       *       *       *       *  It was like a fantastic dream come true. Only the dream wasn't fantastic any more. With the huge atomic power plants scattered across the country and supplying endless electrical power at ridiculously low prices, no endeavor that required power was fantastic. The power required to operate the CPA devices cost each taxpayer an average of four dollars a year, and the invention, development and manufacture of the devices had cost even less.  And the CPA had attacked crime through society itself, striking at the individual. In every city there were neon signs that blinked subliminally with the statement, CRIME IS FILTH. Listening to a radio or watching television, if a person heard station identification, he invariably heard or saw just below perception the words CRIME IS FILTH. If he went for a walk or a ride, he saw the endless subliminal posters declaring CRIME IS FILTH, and if he read a magazine or newspaper he always found, in those little dead spaces where an editor couldn't fit anything else, the below-perception words CRIME IS FILTH.  It was monotonous and, after a while, a person looked at the words and heard them without thinking about them. And they were imprinted on his subconscious over and over, year after year, until he knew that crime was the same as filth and that criminals were filthy things.  Except men like Joe Harper. No system is perfect. Along with thousands of other DCTs, Joe refused to believe it, and when he reached apartment 204 at 2141 Orange Street, he felt as if he'd inherited a gold mine.  The hall was dimly lit, but when he stood before the door numbered 204, he could see that the wall on either side of it was _new_. That is, instead of being covered with dust, dirt and stains as the other walls were, it was clean. The building was an old one, the hall was wide, and the owner had obviously constructed a wall across the hall, creating another room. If the owner had reported the new room as required by law, it would have been wired with CPA burglarproof devices, but evidently he didn't want to pay for installation.  When Joe entered the cubbyhole, he had to stand to one side in order to close the door behind him. The place was barely large enough for the bed, chair and bureau; it was a place where a man could fall down at night and sleep, but where no normal man could live day after day.  Fearing that someone might detect him before he actually committed the crime, Joe hurried to the bureau and searched it.         *       *       *       *       *  He broke out in a sweat when he found nothing but underwear and old magazines. If he stole underwear and magazines, it would still be a crime, but the newspapers would splash satirical headlines. Instead of being respected as a successful criminal, he would be ridiculed.  He stopped sweating when he found a watch under a pile of underwear. The crystal was broken, one hand was missing and it wouldn't run, but--perfection itself--engraved on the back was the inscription, _To John with Love_. His trial would be a clean-cut one: it would be easy for the CPA to prove ownership and that a crime had been committed.  Chuckling with joy, he opened the window and shouted, \"_Thief! Police! Help!_\"  He waited a few seconds and then ran. When he reached the street, a police helicopter landed next to him. Strong metal arms seized him; cameras clicked and recorded the damning evidence.  When Joe was securely handcuffed to a seat inside the helicopter, the metal police officers rang doorbells. There was a reward for anyone who reported a crime, but no one admitted shouting the warning.         *       *       *       *       *  He was having a nightmare when he heard the voice, \"Hey. Wake up. Hey!\"  He opened his eyes, saw Hendricks' ugly face and thought for a minute he was still having the nightmare.  \"I just saw your doctor,\" Hendricks said. \"He says your treatment is over. You can go home now. I thought I'd give you a lift.\"  As Joe dressed, he searched his mind and tried to find some difference.  During the treatment, he had been unconscious or drugged, unable to think. Now he could think clearly, but he could find no difference in himself.  He felt more relaxed than he'd ever felt before, but that could be an after-effect of all the sedatives he'd been given. And, he noticed when he looked in the mirror, he was paler. The treatment had taken months and he had, between operations, been locked in his room.  Hendricks was standing by the window. Joe stared at the massive back. Deliberately goading his mind, he discovered the biggest change: Before, the mere sight of the man had aroused an intense hatred. Now, even when he tried, he succeeded in arousing only a mild hatred. They had toned down his capacity to hate, but not done away with it altogether.  \"Come here and take a look at your public,\" said Hendricks.  Joe went to the window. Three stories below, a large crowd had gathered on the hospital steps: a band, photographers, television trucks, cameramen and autograph hunters. He'd waited a long time for this day. But now--another change in him--  He put the emotion into words: \"I don't feel like a hero. Funny, but I don't.\"  \"Hero!\" Hendricks laughed and, with his powerful lungs, it sounded like a bull snorting. \"You think a successful criminal is a hero? You stupid--\"  He laughed again and waved a hand at the crowd below them. \"You think those people are down there because they admire what you did? They're down there waiting for you because they're curious, because they're glad the CPA caught you, and because they're glad you're an Ex. You're an _ex_-criminal now, and because of your treatment, you'll never be able to commit another crime as long as you live. And that's the kind of guy they admire, so they want to see you, shake your hand and get your autograph.\"  Joe didn't understand Hendricks completely, but the part he did understand he didn't believe. A crowd was waiting for him. He could see the people with his own eyes. When he left the hospital, they'd cheer and shout and ask for his autograph. If he wasn't a hero, _what was he_?         *       *       *       *       *  It took half an hour to get through the crowd. Cameras clicked all around him, a hundred kids asked for his autograph, everyone talked at once and cheered, smiled, laughed, patted him on the back and cheered some more.  Only one thing confused him during all the excitement: a white-haired old lady with tears in her eyes said, \"Thank heaven it was only a watch. Thank heaven you didn't kill someone! God bless you, son.\" And then the old lady had handed him a box of fudge and left him in total confusion.  What she said didn't make sense. If he had killed someone rather than stealing a watch, he would be even more of a hero and the crowd would have cheered even louder. He knew: he had stood outside the CPA hospitals many times and the crowds always cheered louder when an ex-murderer came out.  In Hendricks' robot-chauffeured car, he ate the fudge and consoled himself with the thought, _People are funny. Who can understand 'em?_  Feeling happy for one of the few times in his life, he turned toward Hendricks and said, \"Thanks for what you did. It turned out great. I'll be able to get a good job now.\"  \"That's why I met you at the hospital,\" Hendricks said. \"I want to explain some things. I've known you for a long time and I know you're spectacularly dumb. You can't figure out some things for yourself and I don't want you walking around the rest of your life thinking I did you a favor.\"  Joe frowned. Few men had ever done him a favor and he had rarely thanked anyone for anything. And now ... after thanking the man who'd done him the biggest favor of all, the man was denying it!  \"You robbed Gralewski's apartment,\" Hendricks said. \"Gralewski is a CPA employee and he doesn't live in the apartment you robbed. The CPA pays the rent for that one and he lives in another. We have a lot of places like that. You see, it gives us a way to get rid of saps like you before they do real damage. We use it as a last resort when a DCT First Class won't take the free psycho treatment or--\"  \"Well, it's still a favor.\"  Hendricks' face hardened. \"Favor? You wouldn't know a favor if you stumbled over one. I did it because it's standard procedure for your type of case. Anyone can--free of charge--have treatment by the best psychologists. Any DCT can stop being a DCT by simply asking for the treatment and taking it. But you wouldn't do that. You wanted to commit a crime, get caught and be a hero ... an _Ex_.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The car passed one of the CPA playgrounds. Boys and girls of all ages were laughing, squealing with joy as they played games designed by CPA psychologists to relieve tension. And--despite the treatment, Joe shuddered when he saw the psychologists standing to one side, quietly watching the children. The whole world was filled with CPA employees and volunteer workers. Everywhere you went, it was there, quietly watching you and analyzing you, and if you showed criminal tendencies, it watched you even more closely and analyzed you even more deeply until it took you apart and put you back together again the way it wanted you to be.  \"Being an Ex, you'll get the kind of job you always wanted,\" Hendricks continued. \"You'll get a good-paying job, but you'll work for it. You'll work eight hours a day, work harder than you've ever worked before in your life,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51657"],["title","Charity Case (#1)"],["body","g.  The next time I glanced at the clock, it said ten minutes had gone by. My hand still wasn't free and I hadn't budged the box.  \"This,\" Brother Partridge said, \"is one of the most profound experiences of my life.\"  My head hinged until it lined my eyes up with Brother Partridge. The pipe hung heavy in my pocket, but he was too far from me.  \"A vision of you at the box projected itself on the crest of my soup,\" the preacher explained in wonderment.  I nodded. \"Swimming right in there with the dead duck.\"  \"Cold turkey,\" he corrected. \"Are you scoffing at a miracle?\"  \"People are always watching me, Brother,\" I said. \"So now they do it even when they aren't around. I should have known it would come to that.\"  The pipe was suddenly a weight I wanted off me. I would try robbing a collection box, knowing positively that I would get caught, but I wasn't dumb enough to murder. Somebody, somewhere, would be a witness to it. I had never got away with anything in my life. I was too smart to even try anything but the little things.  \"I may be able to help you,\" Brother Partridge said, \"if you have faith and a conscience.\"  \"I've got something better than a conscience,\" I told him.         *       *       *       *       *  Brother Partridge regarded me solemnly. \"There must be something special about you, for your apprehension to come through miraculous intervention. But I can't imagine what.\"  \"I _always_ get apprehended somehow, Brother,\" I said. \"I'm pretty special.\"  \"Your name?\"  \"William Hagle.\" No sense lying. I had been booked and printed before.  Partridge prodded me with his bony fingers as if making sure I was substantial. \"Come. Let's sit down, if you can remove your fist from the money box.\"  I opened up my fingers and let the coins ring inside the box and I drew out my hand. The bill stuck to the sweat on my fingers and slid out along with the digits. A one, I decided. I had got into trouble for a grubby single. It wasn't any century. I had been kidding myself.  I unfolded the note. Sure enough, it wasn't a hundred-dollar bill, but it was a twenty, and that was almost the same thing to me. I creased it and put it back into the slot.  As long as it stalled off the cops, I'd talk to Partridge.  We took a couple of camp chairs and I told him the story of my life, or most of it. It was hard work on an empty stomach; I wished I'd had some of that turkey soup. Then again I was glad I hadn't. Something always happened to me when I thought back over my life. The same thing.  The men filed out of the kitchen, wiping their chins, and I went right on talking.  After some time Sister Partridge bustled in and snapped on the overhead lights and I kept talking. The brother still hadn't used the phone to call the cops.  \"Remarkable,\" Partridge finally said when I got so hoarse I had to take a break. \"One is almost--_almost_--reminded of Job. William, you are being punished for some great sin. Of that, I'm sure.\"  \"Punished for a sin? But, Brother, I've always had it like this, as long as I can remember. What kind of a sin could I have committed when I was fresh out of my crib?\"  \"William, all I can tell you is that time means nothing in Heaven. Do you deny the transmigration of souls?\"  \"Well,\" I said, \"I've had no personal experience--\"  \"Of course you have, William! Say you don't remember. Say you don't want to remember. But don't say you have no personal experience!\"  \"And you think I'm being punished for something I did in a previous life?\"  He looked at me in disbelief. \"What else could it be?\"  \"I don't know,\" I confessed. \"I certainly haven't done anything that bad in _this_ life.\"  \"William, if you atone for this sin, perhaps the horde of locusts will lift from you.\"  It wasn't much of a chance, but I was unused to having any at all. I shook off the dizziness of it. \"By the Lord Harry, Brother, I'm going to give it a try!\" I cried.  \"I believe you,\" Partridge said, surprised at himself.  He ambled over to the money box on the wall. He tapped the bottom lightly and a box with no top slid out of the slightly larger box. He reached in, fished out the bill and presented it to me.  \"Perhaps this will help in your atonement,\" he said.  I crumpled it into my pocket fast. Not meaning to sound ungrateful, I'm pretty sure he hadn't noticed it was a twenty.  And then the bill seemed to lie there, heavy, a lead weight. It would have been different if I had managed to get it out of the box myself. You know how it is.  Money you haven't earned doesn't seem real to you.         *       *       *       *       *  There was something I forgot to mention so far. During the year between when I got out of the reformatory and the one when I tried to steal Brother Partridge's money, I killed a man.  It was all an accident, but killing somebody is reason enough to get punished. It didn't have to be a sin in some previous life, you see.  I had gotten my first job in too long, stacking boxes at the freight door of Baysinger's. The drivers unloaded the stuff, but they just dumped it off the truck. An empty rear end was all they wanted. The freight boss told me to stack the boxes inside, neat and not too close together.  I stacked boxes the first day. I stacked more the second. The third day I went outside with my baloney and crackers. It was warm enough even for November.  Two of them, dressed like Harvard seniors, caps and striped duffer jackets, came up to the crate I was dining off.  \"Work inside, Jack?\" the taller one asked.  \"Yeah,\" I said, chewing.  \"What do you do, Jack?\" the fatter one asked.  \"Stack boxes.\"  \"Got a union card?\"  I shook my head.  \"Application?\"  \"No,\" I said. \"I'm just helping out during Christmas.\"  \"You're a scab, buddy,\" Long-legs said. \"Don't you read the papers?\"  \"I don't like comic strips,\" I said.  They sighed. I think they hated to do it, but I was bucking the system.  Fats hit me high. Long-legs hit me low. I blew cracker crumbs into their faces. After that, I just let them go. I know how to take a beating. That's one thing I knew.  Then lying there, bleeding to myself, I heard them talking. I heard noises like _make an example of him_ and _do something permanent_ and I squirmed away across the rubbish like a polite mouse.  I made it around a corner of brick and stood up, hurting my knee on a piece of brown-splotched pipe. There were noises on the other angle of the corner and so I tested if the pipe was loose and it was. I closed my eyes and brought the pipe up and then down.  It felt as if I connected, but I was so numb, I wasn't sure until I unscrewed my eyes.  There was a big man in a heavy wool overcoat and gray homburg spread on a damp centerfold from the _News_. There was a pick-up slip from the warehouse under the fingers of one hand, and somebody had beaten his brains out.  The police figured it was part of some labor dispute, I guess, and they never got to me.  I suppose I was to blame anyway. If I hadn't been alive, if I hadn't been there to get beaten up, it wouldn't have happened. I could see the point in making me suffer for it. There was a lot to be said for looking at it like that. But there was nothing to be said for telling Brother Partridge about the accident, or murder, or whatever had happened that day.         *       *       *       *       *  Searching myself after I left Brother Partridge, I finally found a strip of gray adhesive tape on my side, out of the fuzzy area. Making the twenty the size of a thick postage stamp, I peeled back the tape and put the folded bill on the white skin and smoothed the tape back.  There was only one place for me to go now. I headed for the public library. It was only about twenty blocks, but not having had anything to eat since the day before, it enervated me.  The downstairs washroom was where I went first. There was nobody there but an old guy talking urgently to a kid with thick glasses, and somebody building a fix in one of the booths. I could see charred matches dropping down on the floor next to his tennis shoes, and even a few grains of white stuff. But he managed to hold still enough to keep from spilling more from the spoon.  I washed my hands and face, smoothed my hair down, combing it with my fingers. Going over my suit with damp toweling got off a lot of the dirt. I put my collar on the outside of my jacket and creased the wings with my thumbnail so it would look more like a sports shirt. It didn't really. I still looked like a bum, but sort of a neat, non-objectionable bum.  The librarian at the main desk looked sympathetically hostile, or hostilely sympathetic.  \"I'd like to get into the stacks, miss,\" I said, \"and see some of the old newspapers.\"  \"Which newspapers?\" the old girl asked stiffly.  I thought back. I couldn't remember the exact date. \"Ones for the first week in November last year.\"  \"We have the _Times_ microfilmed. I would have to project them for you.\"  \"I didn't want to see the _Times_,\" I said, fast. \"Don't you have any newspapers on paper?\" I didn't want her to see what I wanted to read up on.  \"We have the _News_, bound, for last year.\"  I nodded. \"That's the one I wanted to see.\"  She sniffed and told me to follow her. I didn't rate a cart to my table, I guess, or else the bound papers weren't supposed to come out of the stacks.  The cases of books, row after row, smelled good. Like old leather and good pipe tobacco. I had been here before. In this world, it's the man with education who makes the money. I had been reading the Funk & Wagnalls Encyclopedia. So far I knew a lot about Mark Antony, Atomic Energy, Boron, Brussels, Catapults, Demons, and Divans.  I guess I had stopped to look around at some of the titles, because the busy librarian said sharply, \"Follow me.\"  I heard my voice say, \"A pleasure. What about after work?\"  I didn't say it, but I was used to my voice independently saying things. Her neck got to flaming, but she walked stiffly ahead. She didn't say anything. She must be awful mad, I"]]]
