I was unable to learn the cost of the construction, but judge it must have required at least several millions of dollars.  Such is the location of Nauvoo; such its immediate surroundings. It now remains for me to relate the events which led to the establishment of a thriving city on the site we have briefly described; how it was converted from a sickly wilderness to the most desirable section of the great State of Illinois; and then how, through acts of injustice and treachery, some of its principal founders were murdered and the rest of its inhabitants cruelly driven from the city by mob violence into the wilderness; and how the city sank from its prosperous condition, to become the semi-desolate place it is today; and, what is of more importance, to trace the development of that faith taught by Joseph Smith, which is destined to become, and indeed now is, one of the world's great religions.

THE RECEPTION OF THE EXILES IN ILLINOIS.  IN what is properly a companion volume to this--\"The Missouri Persecutions\"--I have told how the Latter-day Saints were driven from Missouri under a threat of extermination from the executive of that State, Lilburn W. Boggs. When fleeing from Missouri, where they had suffered so much from mob violence, and from the State government officials, the Mormon exiles crossed the Mississippi into the State of Illinois, at the point near where the city of Quincy is located--in fact, at the Quincy Ferry. Their destitute condition, together with the injustice they had suffered in Missouri--the spectacle of a people in free America being driven from their homes and exiled from one of the States of the American Union because of religious beliefs--aroused the indignation and excited the sympathy of the people of Quincy and vicinity. A kind reception was given to the exiles by the people of this section of Illinois, one very similar to that given to many of the same people by the inhabitants of Clay County, when a cruel persecution had driven some twelve hundred of them from their homes in Jackson County, Missouri, five years before. [1] The Democratic Association of Quincy was especially active in the interests of the exiles. In the month of February a meeting was called by this association to inquire into the situation of the Mormon exiles. At this first meeting all that was done was to pass a resolution, to the effect that the people called Latter-day Saints were in a situation requiring the aid of the people of Quincy. A committee of eight was appointed to call a general meeting of both citizens and Mormons, and to receive a statement from the latter of their condition, with a view to relieving their necessities. The committee was instructed to get the Congregational church in which to hold the next meeting, but the directors having in charge that building would not allow it to be used for that purpose. I speak of this to show the kind of charity existing in the breasts of some pretended followers of Him who taught that charity was the crowning virtue. Failing to secure the church, the second meeting was held in the courthouse.  At this meeting the special committee appointed at the first meeting reported its labors. The committee had received statements from Sidney Rigdon and others in relation to the expulsion of the Mormons from Missouri, and suggested a series of resolutions setting forth that the exiled strangers were entitled to the sympathy and aid of the people of Quincy;  That a numerous committee, composed of individuals from every part of the town, be appointed to allay the prejudices of the misguided citizens of Quincy, and explain that it was not the design of the exiled Saints to lower the wages of the laboring classes, but to secure something to save them from starvation;  That a standing committee be appointed to relieve, so far as in their power, the wants of the destitute and homeless; and to use their utmost endeavors to procure employment for those who were able and willing to labor.  The report closed by saying:--      We recommend to all the citizens of Quincy that in all their     intercourse with the strangers, they use and observe a becoming     decorum and delicacy, and be particularly careful not to indulge in     any conversation or expression calculated to wound their feelings,     or in any way to reflect upon those who, by every law of humanity,     are entitled to our sympathy and commiseration.  This good work begun by the Democratic Association was continued by them, and substantial assistance was given to the suffering Saints through their exertions. At a subsequent meeting of the association the following resolutions were adopted:      That we regard the right of conscience as natural and inalienable,     and the most sacredly guaranteed by the Constitution of our free     government;      That we regard the acts of all mobs in violation of law; and those     who compose them individually responsible, both to the laws of God     and man, for every depredation committed upon the property, rights,     or life of any citizen;      That the inhabitants upon the western frontier of the State of     Missouri, in their late persecution of the people denominated     Mormons, have violated the sacred rights of conscience and every     law of justice and humanity;      That the governor of Missouri, in refusing protection to this class     of people, when pressed upon by a heartless mob, and turning upon     them a band of unprincipled militia, with orders encouraging their     extermination, has brought a lasting disgrace upon the State over     which he presides.  Thus with expressions of sympathy and material aid did the people of Quincy assist the exiles and bid them hope for better days. Nor was this kindly feeling confined to the people of Quincy and vicinity; it extended throughout the State; and especially was it exhibited by some of the leading men thereof, including Governor Carlin, Stephen A. Douglas, Dr. Isaac Galland and many others.  Footnotes  1. Missouri Persecutions, Chapter xiv.    CHAPTER III.  COMMERCE--LAND PURCHASES.  IN the fall of 1838 a brother by the name of Israel Barlow left the State of Missouri under the exterminating order of Governor Boggs. By missing his way, or, what is more likely, directed by the hand of a kind Providence, he did not leave the State by the same route as the great body of his people, but taking a northeasterly course, struck the Des Moines River a short distance above its mouth, in the Territory of Iowa. He was without food and destitute of clothing. Making his wants known to the people living in that locality, they kindly supplied him with food and raiment. To them he related the story of the persecution of the Latter-day Saints in Missouri, and how his people, poor and destitute as himself, were fleeing from the State _en masse_. His relation of the sufferings of the Saints, and the cruelties heaped upon them by their heartless persecutors, enlisted the sympathies of his hearers, and they gave him letters of introduction to several gentlemen, among which was one to Dr. Isaac Galland, a gentleman of some influence living at Commerce, a small settlement on the banks of the Mississippi, in Illinois, and which afterward became the site of Nauvoo.  Dr. Galland owned considerable land in Commerce, and he wrote the Saints located in Quincy that several farms could doubtless be rented in his locality, and that perhaps some fifty families could be accommodated at Commerce. In addition to this offer of lands made to The Church, another and a previous one had been made of twenty thousand acres, between the Des Moines and the Mississippi rivers. This tract could have been purchased at two dollars per acre, to be paid in twenty annual payments without interest. A conference was convened at Quincy in February, and the advisability of making the purchase and settling the Saints in a body came up for consideration. It was decided by the conference that it was not advisable to locate lands at that time.  Subsequently, however, on the ninth day of March, the Saints having received further offers of land in Illinois and Iowa, called another public meeting and appointed a committee to go and examine the lands offered. In Iowa, the people and officers of the Territory expressed a kindly feeling toward the exiled Saints. The governor of Iowa--Robert Lucas--had known the Saints in Ohio, and testified to Dr. Galland that the Mormon people, when they were in Ohio, were good citizens, and he respected them as such now, and would treat them accordingly, should they, or any part of them, decide to settle in his Territory. The statement is made in answer to a letter of inquiry on the subject of the Mormons settling in Iowa. He wrote to Dr. Isaac Galland as follows:                                     EXECUTIVE OFFICE, IOWA, BURLINGTON                                                          March, 1839.      DEAR SIR--On my return to this city, after a few weeks' absence in     the interior of the Territory, I received your letter of the 25th     ultimo, in which you give a short account of the sufferings of the     _people called Mormons_, and ask \"whether they could be permitted     to purchase lands, and settle upon them, in the Territory of Iowa,     and there worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their     own consciences, secure from oppression,\" etc.      In answer to your inquiry, I would say, that I know of no authority     that can constitutionally deprive them of this right.

Coming in, Crimson. Over.\"  \"Okay, Patrol!\" the earphones said. And then the radio went silent.  Dave turned to see if Freddy had had his radio switched on. The English youth had, of course, and he gave Dave a wide-eyed stare of wonder.  \"What's up, do you think, Dave?\" he asked.  \"Search me,\" Dave replied with a shrug. \"But orders are orders, and so down we go. Hang onto your hats, children.\"  As Dave spoke the last he eased back the throttle and sent the Skua seaward in a long three quarter throttle power dive. He had dropped some five or six thousand feet before he saw the relief patrol climbing up into the blue. He waved a hand in greeting and continued on down. At ten thousand feet he leveled off and banked west. A couple of seconds later he picked up the aircraft carrier Victory. In the golden glare of the sun it reminded him a little of a long narrow flatiron floating upside down in the water. He headed straight for it, then suddenly grinned and turned around to Freddy.  \"Figured it out yet?\" he asked.  \"Naturally not,\" Freddy replied. \"Have you?\"  Dave struggled to keep his face straight.  \"Of course I don't know for sure,\" he said, \"but I think I've got a pretty good hunch. It's Group Captain Spencer. He's a very considerate officer, you know.\"  \"Group Captain Spencer?\" Freddy echoed unsuspecting. \"What has being a considerate officer got to do with it?\"  \"Well, I've got a hunch he likes me,\" Dave said. \"So I suppose he figured that being aloft with a guy named Farmer for three whole hours was just too much to take. Ouch! Hey, lay off! Want me to dive us down into the drink?\"  The last was because Freddy had moved swiftly forward, unsnapped Dave's helmet strap and tilted the helmet down over his face. He held it there as Dave struggled with his free hand.  \"Apologize?\" Freddy demanded.  \"Okay, okay!\" Dave cried. \"I take it all back. Boy! Am I glad I didn't make that crack just as we were sliding in to land.\"  \"Oh, I'd have waited a bit, I fancy,\" Freddy said, and grinned at him. \"No sense cracking up a nice airplane just to teach you a bit of manners. Now, my lad, close that pretty mouth of yours and get us down safely.\"  \"For two cents,\" Dave growled as he adjusted his helmet, \"I'd--No, let it go. Okay, my fine feathered friend. Watch, and learn.\"  The Victory was now just ahead and steaming straight into the wind. Dave roared by on the port side and took a look at the landing officer (or flag officer) standing in a box-like structure that jutted out to the right of the bridge. The officer held a yellow flag in each hand, and as Dave and Freddy thundered by he signaled with the flags that the deck was clear for a landing.  After continuing on a certain distance astern of the carrier, Dave then banked around and headed straight back, one hand on the stick, the other on the throttle, and his eyes fixed steadfastly on the landing officer. Landing on a carrier is not the same as landing on a ground airdrome. When landing on a ground airdrome, the pilot does the whole job. Not so on a carrier, however. There the landing officer tells the incoming pilot exactly what to do. He does this with his signal flags. He signals whether the pilot is too high, or too low; whether he is too much to the left, or to the right; or if his plane is not trimmed correctly. The pilot (if he is a wise pilot) does exactly as the landing officer signals, and does not rely on his own judgment at all. It has been proved time and time again that the incoming pilot who does not obey the landing officer's signals implicitly winds up in a whole lot of trouble, if not in the ship's Sick Bay.  And so Dave kept his eyes fixed on that officer with the yellow flags and brought the Blackburn Skua down closer and closer to the Victory's polished flight deck. Finally he caught the signal to cut his throttle way back. He did so, and the plane sank down onto the deck. Almost before the secret arresting gear had pulled it to a full stop, mechanics were rushing out to take over.  As Dave and Freddy climbed out and stretched their cramped legs, the deck duty officer came over.  \"Get out of your duds and get polished up, you two,\" he said with a grin. \"All pilots are to report in the Ready Room in twenty minutes. So hop to it.\"  The deck duty officer was no more than a couple of years older than Dave and Freddy, and his flying rank was the same. His name was Talbert, and he ate at the same mess table as the boys. Dave gave him a searching look, then spoke in a low voice.  \"You wouldn't know, would you, Tal?\" he asked. \"I mean, what it's all about?\"  \"Not a blessed thing, Dawson,\" the other replied with a shake of his head. \"Big doings, though, I shouldn't wonder. Group Captain Spencer looks quite hot and bothered. I fancy he isn't collecting us to serve tea. Now off with you. Mustn't clutter up the flight deck, you know.\"     CHAPTER TWO  _Orders from G.H.Q._   Group Captain Spencer was a big man with iron grey hair and a face that made you think of chiseled granite. He had served as a fighting pilot in World War No. 1, and the double row of decoration ribbons under his wings were proof enough that he had served his country well. A bullet scar just over his right eye was a constant reminder of a very close shave with Death. It added to the striking appearance of his broad, square-jawed face. As a matter of fact, Group Captain Spencer had yet to see forty-five years of age, but war had left its stamp on him so that he actually looked well over fifty.  He stood straddle-legged on the small platform at one end of the Ready Room while the Victory's fighter pilots, an even thirty-four of them, filed into the room and found seats. When finally they were all seated and silent, Group Captain Spencer cleared his throat and took a step closer to the edge of the platform.  \"No doubt you lads are pretty fed up with patrolling around and not getting much of a chance to do any shooting,\" he said, and grinned faintly. \"Well, that's because the fleet has been trying to smoke out the Italian navy--that is, what's left of it.\"  The senior officer paused, and a ripple of laughter spread from lip to lip.  \"It's now pretty plain that Mussolini's sea chaps don't fancy a fight,\" Group Captain Spencer continued. \"They've bottled themselves up in port, and won't come out. In time we'll have to go after them like we did at the Taranto Naval Base last November Twelfth. That kind of fun will have to wait a bit, though. More important things to do first. In short, Hitler is sticking his finger in the African pie--the Libyan pie, to be exact.\"  A murmur of suppressed excitement spread about the room. The pilots sat up a bit straighter and waited expectantly. Freddy looked at Dave and winked. Dave winked back and nodded his head.  \"I'll give you a picture of what has happened,\" Group Captain Spencer said abruptly. \"Last fall General Wavell, commander in chief of His Majesty's Middle East Armies, had two jobs to tackle, two rather tough nuts to crack. One was the job of pushing Marshal Graziani's Italian forces out of western Egypt and back into Libya. The other was to drive the Italians out of Eritrea and Ethiopia to the south of Egypt. I say they were two tough nuts to crack because General Wavell didn't have the troops, mechanized divisions or the planes he really needed for the jobs. However, as the world knows now, he did what he could with what he had, and did a very fine job, too.\"  The senior officer paused and made a little gesture with his hand that said the pilots could smoke if they wished. As a matter of fact, he lighted up a cigarette himself.  \"On December Ninth, last year,\" the group captain went on, \"General Wavell started a surprise offensive against Graziani's most advanced forces at Matruh, in Egypt. He caught the Italians completely off guard and they started one of the wildest retreats in military history. By February of this year General Wavell's British, Australian, New Zealand, and South African troops were in possession of Bengazi, in Libya, some eight hundred miles from the starting point of the drive. And what was left of the Italian army was fleeing for its life along the desert shoreline to Tripoli, the main Italian base in Libya, and its capital. That offensive by Wavell will go down in war history as one of the most brilliant ever accomplished.  \"Now, as soon as the Italians had been thrown back, General Wavell took all the troops, tanks, and planes that he could spare and sent them against the Italians in Eritrea and Ethiopia. In short, he left but a skeleton force occupying the captured Italian positions in Libya. He had to do that because he didn't have enough troops for both jobs. As we know, he did another fine job down to the south. It won't be long now before the whole of Eritrea and Ethiopia will be in British hands. However--\"  Group Captain Spencer paused, and his face became grim and set.  \"However,\" he began again, \"while General Wavell has been busy down in Eritrea and Ethiopia, Hitler has stepped in to lend a hand to the Italians in Libya. In short, during the last two weeks or so, German transport planes have been transporting German troops across the Mediterranean from Sicily to Tripoli in Libya. Tanks, guns, and supplies have been sneaked across in Italian ships that race for French Tunisia and then hug the coast of that French African colony and get safely to Tripoli. The British Mediterranean Naval Command has known what was going on, at least to a certain degree. Anyway, steps have now been taken to put a stop to it. However, the naval job out here is a big one, and the first job was to knock out the Italian navy.\"  The senior officer took time out to clear his throat and have a glass of water.  \"Well, the Italian navy isn't very much, now,\" he continued presently, \"so the next job is to do something about this business of Hitler helping the Italians in Libya."]]]
