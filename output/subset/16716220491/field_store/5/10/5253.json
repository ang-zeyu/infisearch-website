Designs adapted to this work are found in Plate 9.  Occasionally, students having a natural bent or enthusiasm for design will be found anxious to produce a card of the style found in Plate 10. In cards of this kind, careful attention must be given to the motifs used and to the placing of these motifs in the general composition. As most of the stress is laid on the design, rather than the lettering, it is important that this design be well planned and equally well carried out. In case of doubt, it is better to leave out some of the ornament rather than have the card overcrowded or ornate.  The holiday motifs shown in Plate 11 are not only adapted to gift cards, but also to posters, place cards, and room or tree decorations. It is a good problem to allow the students to take such a page of motifs and from them to plan their own card, using their own ideas as to size of card, proportion, lettering, etc. This is splendid training for the artists in the line of what is known to the printers as “make-up.” After the preliminary sketches have been made the teacher can call attention to mistakes in balance, rhythm, etc., and suggest corrections.  Other useful ornaments, not only for Christmas but also for Easter and Hallowe’en, are found in Plates 12 and 13. The test of a student’s ability lies in the way he is able to arrange such motifs into a good card, or the manner in which he derives ideas from these motifs for original work.  Plate 14 gives us some very effective motifs for Washington’s Birthday. These figures can be cut in paper, done in opaque wash, or finished in pen and ink. Original poems may be written by members of the class and added to the card. School programs or invitations can be made a class problem for this topic.  Valentines also afford a good opportunity for a class problem. Try to encourage in the students the development of new ideas or original treatment in the handling of their valentine cards. A card does not need to be gaudy, over-elaborate, or grotesque, in order to be attractive. A few simple motifs, well placed, and with good coloring, will produce the most pleasing kind of a card. Humorous cards, containing good clean fun are always acceptable, if well done.  A Valentine containing unique possibilities is shown in Plate 16. The same idea can be varied so as to make a number of novel cards. The little envelope, which this card features, is easily constructed and will hold quite a message, if written carefully. The figure of the messenger can be hand colored in buff and vermilion.  The cards and motifs shown on these plates make a series of general suggestions. Based on the types shown here, as regards lettering, design, and card sizes, gift cards for the various holidays and for birthdays can be planned and worked out. Once your students produce such cards, they will never again be satisfied with stock cards. Successful students can find remuneration as well as much joy in designing gift cards for their friends’ needs, and in time may be able to create a market in their own locality.   Outline for Problems in Gift Card Work       PROBLEM 1. Have students select or originate a good Christmas      sentiment. Next, sketch on an 8 x 10 sheet of pencil paper four      different arrangements of this idea.       PROBLEM 2. After selecting the best composition from sketches in      Problem 1, plan a card and envelope arrangement to go with it.      Study over suggestions given in Plate 2.       PROBLEM 3. Using three colors and a tinted paper, complete the idea      planned in Problems 1 and 2. Possibly two varied types of cards can      be worked up.       PROBLEM 4. As a variation, design and complete two simple cards in      cut paper. Use about four colors, using the background as one of      the colors.       PROBLEM 5. Keeping the flat decorative type of work as a standard      study the cards in Plate 7. Next, design a Christmas folder of two      or four pages, having a cover design and lettered verse inside.       PROBLEM 6. Plan a set of four holiday tags or stickers to go with      packages. These should not exceed 2 x 3 inches in size and can be      of the semi-humorous type.       PROBLEM 7. Have students copy a good pen alphabet using both the      capitals and small letters. This card should be made on a 8 x 10      sheet of bristol board.       PROBLEM 8. Either look up or originate some text that will make a      good holiday gift. Block out a wall card that will be about 6 x 9      inches in proportion and design the motto to fit this space using      the pen letters studied.       PROBLEM 9. Study the cut paper cards made in Problem 4. Also look      at Plate 9. Next, on pencil paper, block out two compositions that      will cut well in linoleum. Select the best and work it out      carefully in color, planning every part in flat tones.       PROBLEM 10. From color sketch, trace and cut out the linoleum      blocks. Using opaque water colors, print a set of fifteen or twenty      good cards. Make envelopes to go with them. Vary color schemes if      desired.       PROBLEM 11. Allow each student to originate a color scheme and      table plan for a Christmas dinner. After this has been perfected,      have each student make six place cards to go with the decorations.       PROBLEM 12. Study suggestions in Plate 12 and 13. From these or      other material, design one round and one oblong sticker to be      placed on a gift package. This may be for any of the holidays or      for a birthday.       PROBLEM 13. Look over Plate 14. Using these suggestions or similar      ones, plan a program or an invitation to Washington’s Birthday      exercises at the school. Size and color optional.       PROBLEM 14. Study Plates 15 and 16. Next, design two good      Valentines, one being of the greeting type and the other having      some novelty added, as the one found in Plate 16. Keep lettering      clear and simple.       PROBLEM 15. Design an artistic Easter Card, using white or cream      paper and delicate coloring. Tie with appropriate cord or ribbon.       PROBLEM 16. Plan invitations to a Fourth of July party. Work for a      unique effect without using too many colors.       PROBLEM 17. Do the same with Hallowe’en, using cut paper instead of      colors.       PROBLEM 18. Design an invitation to a Thanksgiving dinner, using a      combination of ink outlines and flat washes of watercolor.

All the originals, several published for general sale, others privately printed, were in color. 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were hand colored. To make an original card, choose the arrangement that seems most desirable, and substitute elements having a personal appeal--other salutations or quotations and appropriate decorative elements.]  [Illustration: PLATE 6  FOUR VARIED STYLES of design in holiday cards, for more advanced talent.

Notice how the designs have been kept in simple broad masses and the lettering made part of the design.

If printed in a deep gray or brown and hand colored with light washes of transparent color they make an unusually rich looking card.]  [Illustration: PLATE 10  CARDS using figures of the poster type. In these the accent has been placed on the decorative design quality.
