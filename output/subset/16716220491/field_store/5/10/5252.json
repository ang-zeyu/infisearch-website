Don't go too fast,\" warned the General. \"My Nomes are good fighters, but they are not strong enough to conquer the Emerald City.\"  \"Are you sure?\" asked the King.  \"Absolutely certain, your Majesty.\"  \"Then what am I to do?\"  \"Give up the idea and mind your own business,\" advised the General. \"You have plenty to do trying to rule your underground kingdom.\"  \"But I want the Magic Belt--and I'm going to have it!\" roared the Nome King.  \"I'd like to see you get it,\" replied the General, laughing maliciously.  The King was by this time so exasperated that he picked up his scepter, which had a heavy ball, made from a sapphire, at the end of it, and threw it with all his force at General Blug.  The sapphire hit the General upon his forehead and knocked him flat upon the ground, where he lay motionless.  Then the King rang his gong and told his guards to drag out the General and throw him away; which they did.  This Nome King was named Roquat the Red, and no one loved him.  He was a bad man and a powerful monarch, and he had resolved to destroy the Land of Oz and its magnificent Emerald City, to enslave Princess Ozma and little Dorothy and all the Oz people, and recover his Magic Belt. This same Belt had once enabled Roquat the Red to carry out many wicked plans; but that was before Ozma and her people marched to the underground cavern and captured it.  The Nome King could not forgive Dorothy or Princess Ozma, and he had determined to be revenged upon them.  But they, for their part, did not know they had so dangerous an enemy. Indeed, Ozma and Dorothy had both almost forgotten that such a person as the Nome King yet lived under the mountains of the Land of Ev--which lay just across the deadly desert to the south of the Land of Oz.  An unsuspected enemy is doubly dangerous.    2.  How Uncle Henry Got Into Trouble  Dorothy Gale lived on a farm in Kansas, with her Aunt Em and her Uncle Henry.  It was not a big farm, nor a very good one, because sometimes the rain did not come when the crops needed it, and then everything withered and dried up.  Once a cyclone had carried away Uncle Henry's house, so that he was obliged to build another; and as he was a poor man he had to mortgage his farm to get the money to pay for the new house.  Then his health became bad and he was too feeble to work.  The doctor ordered him to take a sea voyage and he went to Australia and took Dorothy with him.  That cost a lot of money, too.  Uncle Henry grew poorer every year, and the crops raised on the farm only bought food for the family.  Therefore the mortgage could not be paid.  At last the banker who had loaned him the money said that if he did not pay on a certain day, his farm would be taken away from him.  This worried Uncle Henry a good deal, for without the farm he would have no way to earn a living.  He was a good man, and worked in the field as hard as he could; and Aunt Em did all the housework, with Dorothy's help.  Yet they did not seem to get along.  This little girl, Dorothy, was like dozens of little girls you know. She was loving and usually sweet-tempered, and had a round rosy face and earnest eyes.  Life was a serious thing to Dorothy, and a wonderful thing, too, for she had encountered more strange adventures in her short life than many other girls of her age.  Aunt Em once said she thought the fairies must have marked Dorothy at her birth, because she had wandered into strange places and had always been protected by some unseen power.  As for Uncle Henry, he thought his little niece merely a dreamer, as her dead mother had been, for he could not quite believe all the curious stories Dorothy told them of the Land of Oz, which she had several times visited.  He did not think that she tried to deceive her uncle and aunt, but he imagined that she had dreamed all of those astonishing adventures, and that the dreams had been so real to her that she had come to believe them true.  Whatever the explanation might be, it was certain that Dorothy had been absent from her Kansas home for several long periods, always disappearing unexpectedly, yet always coming back safe and sound, with amazing tales of where she had been and the unusual people she had met. Her uncle and aunt listened to her stories eagerly and in spite of their doubts began to feel that the little girl had gained a lot of experience and wisdom that were unaccountable in this age, when fairies are supposed no longer to exist.  Most of Dorothy's stories were about the Land of Oz, with its beautiful Emerald City and a lovely girl Ruler named Ozma, who was the most faithful friend of the little Kansas girl.  When Dorothy told about the riches of this fairy country Uncle Henry would sigh, for he knew that a single one of the great emeralds that were so common there would pay all his debts and leave his farm free.  But Dorothy never brought any jewels home with her, so their poverty became greater every year.  When the banker told Uncle Henry that he must pay the money in thirty days or leave the farm, the poor man was in despair, as he knew he could not possibly get the money.  So he told his wife, Aunt Em, of his trouble, and she first cried a little and then said that they must be brave and do the best they could, and go away somewhere and try to earn an honest living.  But they were getting old and feeble and she feared that they could not take care of Dorothy as well as they had formerly done.  Probably the little girl would also be obliged to go to work.  They did not tell their niece the sad news for several days, not wishing to make her unhappy; but one morning the little girl found Aunt Em softly crying while Uncle Henry tried to comfort her.  Then Dorothy asked them to tell her what was the matter.  \"We must give up the farm, my dear,\" replied her uncle sadly, \"and wander away into the world to work for our living.\"  The girl listened quite seriously, for she had not known before how desperately poor they were.  \"We don't mind for ourselves,\" said her aunt, stroking the little girl's head tenderly; \"but we love you as if you were our own child, and we are heart-broken to think that you must also endure poverty, and work for a living before you have grown big and strong.\"  \"What could I do to earn money?\" asked Dorothy.  \"You might do housework for some one, dear, you are so handy; or perhaps you could be a nurse-maid to little children.  I'm sure I don't know exactly what you CAN do to earn money, but if your uncle and I are able to support you we will do it willingly, and send you to school. We fear, though, that we shall have much trouble in earning a living for ourselves.  No one wants to employ old people who are broken down in health, as we are.\"  Dorothy smiled.  \"Wouldn't it be funny,\" she said, \"for me to do housework in Kansas, when I'm a Princess in the Land of Oz?\"  \"A Princess!\" they both exclaimed, astonished.  \"Yes; Ozma made me a Princess some time ago, and she has often begged me to come and live always in the Emerald City,\" said the child.  Her uncle and aunt looked at her in amazement.  Then the man said:  \"Do you suppose you could manage to return to your fairyland, my dear?\"  \"Oh yes,\" replied Dorothy; \"I could do that easily.\"  \"How?\" asked Aunt Em.  \"Ozma sees me every day at four o'clock, in her Magic Picture.  She can see me wherever I am, no matter what I am doing.  And at that time, if I make a certain secret sign, she will send for me by means of the Magic Belt, which I once captured from the Nome King.  Then, in the wink of an eye, I shall be with Ozma in her palace.\"  The elder people remained silent for some time after Dorothy had spoken.  Finally, Aunt Em said, with another sigh of regret:  \"If that is the case, Dorothy, perhaps you'd better go and live in the Emerald City.  It will break our hearts to lose you from our lives, but you will be so much better off with your fairy friends that it seems wisest and best for you to go.\"  \"I'm not so sure about that,\" remarked Uncle Henry, shaking his gray head doubtfully.  \"These things all seem real to Dorothy, I know; but I'm afraid our little girl won't find her fairyland just what she had dreamed it to be.  It would make me very unhappy to think that she was wandering among strangers who might be unkind to her.\"  Dorothy laughed merrily at this speech, and then she became very sober again, for she could see how all this trouble was worrying her aunt and uncle, and knew that unless she found a way to help them their future lives would be quite miserable and unhappy.  She knew that she COULD help them.  She had thought of a way already.  Yet she did not tell them at once what it was, because she must ask Ozma's consent before she would be able to carry out her plans.  So she only said:  \"If you will promise not to worry a bit about me, I'll go to the Land of Oz this very afternoon.  And I'll make a promise, too; that you shall both see me again before the day comes when you must leave this farm.\"  \"The day isn't far away, now,\" her uncle sadly replied.  \"I did not tell you of our trouble until I was obliged to, dear Dorothy, so the evil time is near at hand.  But if you are quite sure your fairy friends will give you a home, it will be best for you to go to them, as your aunt says.\"  That was why Dorothy went to her little room in the attic that afternoon, taking with her a small dog named Toto.  The dog had curly black hair and big brown eyes and loved Dorothy very dearly.  The child had kissed her uncle and aunt affectionately before she went upstairs, and now she looked around her little room rather wistfully, gazing at the simple trinkets and worn calico and gingham dresses, as if they were old friends.  She was tempted at first to make a bundle of them, yet she knew very well that they would be of no use to her in her future life.  She"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/517"],["title","The Emerald City of Oz (#2)"],["body","down upon a broken-backed chair--the only one the room contained--and holding Toto in her arms waited patiently until the clock struck four.  Then she made the secret signal that had been agreed upon between her and Ozma.  Uncle Henry and Aunt Em waited downstairs.  They were uneasy and a good deal excited, for this is a practical humdrum world, and it seemed to them quite impossible that their little niece could vanish from her home and travel instantly to fairyland.  So they watched the stairs, which seemed to be the only way that Dorothy could get out of the farmhouse, and they watched them a long time.  They heard the clock strike four but there was no sound from above.  Half-past four came, and now they were too impatient to wait any longer.  Softly, they crept up the stairs to the door of the little girl's room.  \"Dorothy!  Dorothy!\" they called.  There was no answer.  They opened the door and looked in.  The room was empty.    3.  How Ozma Granted Dorothy's Request  I suppose you have read so much about the magnificent Emerald City that there is little need for me to describe it here.  It is the Capital City of the Land of Oz, which is justly considered the most attractive and delightful fairyland in all the world.  The Emerald City is built all of beautiful marbles in which are set a profusion of emeralds, every one exquisitely cut and of very great size.  There are other jewels used in the decorations inside the houses and palaces, such as rubies, diamonds, sapphires, amethysts and turquoises.  But in the streets and upon the outside of the buildings only emeralds appear, from which circumstance the place is named the Emerald City of Oz.  It has nine thousand, six hundred and fifty-four buildings, in which lived fifty-seven thousand three hundred and eighteen people, up to the time my story opens.  All the surrounding country, extending to the borders of the desert which enclosed it upon every side, was full of pretty and comfortable farmhouses, in which resided those inhabitants of Oz who preferred country to city life.  Altogether there were more than half a million people in the Land of Oz--although some of them, as you will soon learn, were not made of flesh and blood as we are--and every inhabitant of that favored country was happy and prosperous.  No disease of any sort was ever known among the Ozites, and so no one ever died unless he met with an accident that prevented him from living.  This happened very seldom, indeed.  There were no poor people in the Land of Oz, because there was no such thing as money, and all property of every sort belonged to the Ruler.  The people were her children, and she cared for them.  Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as any one may reasonably desire.  Some tilled the lands and raised great crops of grain, which was divided equally among the entire population, so that all had enough.  There were many tailors and dressmakers and shoemakers and the like, who made things that any who desired them might wear. Likewise there were jewelers who made ornaments for the person, which pleased and beautified the people, and these ornaments also were free to those who asked for them.  Each man and woman, no matter what he or she produced for the good of the community, was supplied by the neighbors with food and clothing and a house and furniture and ornaments and games.  If by chance the supply ever ran short, more was taken from the great storehouses of the Ruler, which were afterward filled up again when there was more of any article than the people needed.  Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do.  There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them.  So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.  You will know by what I have here told you, that the Land of Oz was a remarkable country.  I do not suppose such an arrangement would be practical with us, but Dorothy assures me that it works finely with the Oz people.  Oz being a fairy country, the people were, of course, fairy people; but that does not mean that all of them were very unlike the people of our own world.  There were all sorts of queer characters among them, but not a single one who was evil, or who possessed a selfish or violent nature.  They were peaceful, kind hearted, loving and merry, and every inhabitant adored the beautiful girl who ruled them and delighted to obey her every command.  In spite of all I have said in a general way, there were some parts of the Land of Oz not quite so pleasant as the farming country and the Emerald City which was its center.  Far away in the South Country there lived in the mountains a band of strange people called Hammer-Heads, because they had no arms and used their flat heads to pound any one who came near them.  Their necks were like rubber, so that they could shoot out their heads to quite a distance, and afterward draw them back again to their shoulders.  The Hammer-Heads were called the \"Wild People,\" but never harmed any but those who disturbed them in the mountains where they lived.  In some of the dense forests there lived great beasts of every sort; yet these were for the most part harmless and even sociable, and conversed agreeably with those who visited their haunts.  The Kalidahs--beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers--had once been fierce and bloodthirsty, but even they were now nearly all tamed, although at times one or another of them would get cross and disagreeable.  Not so tame were the Fighting Trees, which had a forest of their own. If any one approached them these curious trees would bend down their branches, twine them around the intruders, and hurl them away.  But these unpleasant things existed only in a few remote parts of the Land of Oz.  I suppose every country has some drawbacks, so even this almost perfect fairyland could not be quite perfect.  Once there had been wicked witches in the land, too; but now these had all been destroyed; so, as I said, only peace and happiness reigned in Oz.  For some time Ozma had ruled over this fair country, and never was Ruler more popular or beloved.  She is said to be the most beautiful girl the world has ever known, and her heart and mind are as lovely as her person.  Dorothy Gale had several times visited the Emerald City and experienced adventures in the Land of Oz, so that she and Ozma had now become firm friends.  The girl Ruler had even made Dorothy a Princess of Oz, and had often implored her to come to Ozma's stately palace and live there always; but Dorothy had been loyal to her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, who had cared for her since she was a baby, and she had refused to leave them because she knew they would be lonely without her.  However, Dorothy now realized that things were going to be different with her uncle and aunt from this time forth, so after giving the matter deep thought she decided to ask Ozma to grant her a very great favor.  A few seconds after she had made the secret signal in her little bedchamber, the Kansas girl was seated in a lovely room in Ozma's palace in the Emerald City of Oz.  When the first loving kisses and embraces had been exchanged, the fair Ruler inquired:  \"What is the matter, dear?  I know something unpleasant has happened to you, for your face was very sober when I saw it in my Magic Picture. And whenever you signal me to transport you to this safe place, where you are always welcome, I know you are in danger or in trouble.\"  Dorothy sighed.  \"This time, Ozma, it isn't I,\" she replied.  \"But it's worse, I guess, for Uncle Henry and Aunt Em are in a heap of trouble, and there seems no way for them to get out of it--anyhow, not while they live in Kansas.\"  \"Tell me about it, Dorothy,\" said Ozma, with ready sympathy.  \"Why, you see Uncle Henry is poor; for the farm in Kansas doesn't 'mount to much, as farms go.  So one day Uncle Henry borrowed some money, and wrote a letter saying that if he didn't pay the money back they could take his farm for pay.  Course he 'spected to pay by making money from the farm; but he just couldn't.  An' so they're going to take the farm, and Uncle Henry and Aunt Em won't have any place to live.  They're pretty old to do much hard work, Ozma; so I'll have to work for them, unless--\"  Ozma had been thoughtful during the story, but now she smiled and pressed her little friend's hand.  \"Unless what, dear?\" she asked.  Dorothy hesitated, because her request meant so much to them all.  \"Well,\" said she, \"I'd like to live here in the Land of Oz, where you've often 'vited me to live.  But I can't, you know, unless Uncle Henry and Aunt Em could live here too.\"  \"Of course not,\" exclaimed the Ruler of Oz, laughing gaily.  \"So, in order to get you, little friend, we must invite your Uncle and Aunt to live in Oz, also.\"  \"Oh, will you, Ozma?\" cried Dorothy, clasping her chubby little hands eagerly.  \"Will you bring them here with the Magic Belt, and give them a nice little farm in the Munchkin Country, or the Winkie Country--or some other place?\"  \"To be sure,\" answered Ozma, full of joy at the chance to please her little friend.  \"I have long been thinking of this very thing, Dorothy dear, and often I have had it in my mind to propose it to you.  I am sure your uncle and aunt must be good and worthy people, or you would not love them so much; and for YOUR friends, Princess, there is always room in the Land of Oz.\"  Dorothy was delighted, yet not altogether surprised, for she had clung to the hope that Ozma would be kind enough to grant her request.  When, indeed, had her powerful and faithful friend refused her anything?  \"But you must not call me 'Princess',\" she said; \"for after this I shall live"]]]
