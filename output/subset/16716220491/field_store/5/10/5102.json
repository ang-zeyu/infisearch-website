I felt a little silly, but the outfit was Baxter's idea.  \"I understand you were aboard the _Phobos II_ when the incident occurred?\" I said sternly, which was unusual for my wonted demeanor.  \"Yes, sir!\" he replied swiftly, at stiff attention.  \"I don't really have any details,\" I said, and waited for him to take his cue. As an afterthought, to help him talk, I added, \"At ease, by the way, Anders.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" he said, not actually loosening much in his rigid position, but his face looking happier. \"See, I was supposed to pilot the kids back here from Mars when their trip was done, and--\" He gave a helpless shrug. \"I dunno, sir. I got 'em all aboard, made sure they were secure in the takeoff racks, and then I set my coordinates for Earth and took off. Just a run-of-the-mill takeoff, sir.\"  \"And when did you notice they were missing?\" I asked, looking at the metallic bulk of the ship and wondering what alien force could snatch fifteen fair-sized young boys through its impervious hull without leaving a trace.  \"Chow time, sir. That's when you expect to have the little--to have the kids in your hair, sir. Everyone wants his rations first--You know how kids are, sir. So I went to the galley and was about to open up the ration packs, when I noticed how damned quiet it was aboard. And especially funny that no one was in the galley waiting for me to start passing the stuff out.\"  \"So you searched,\" I said.  Anders nodded sorrowfully. \"Not a trace of 'em, sir. Just some of their junk left in their storage lockers.\"  I raised my eyebrows. \"Really? I'd be interested in seeing this junk, Anders.\"  \"Oh, yes, sir. Right this way, sir. Watch out for these rungs, they're slippery.\"  I ascended the retractable metal rungs that jutted from a point between the tailfins to the open airlock, twenty feet over ground level, and followed Anders inside the ship.  I trailed Anders through the ship, from the pilot's compartment--a bewildering mass of dials, switches, signal lights and wire--through the galley into the troop section. It was a cramped cubicle housing a number of nylon-webbed foam rubber bunks. The bunks were empty, but I looked them over anyhow. I carefully tugged back the canvas covering that fitted envelope-fashion over a foam rubber pad, and ran my finger over the surface of the pad. It came away just slightly gritty.  \"Uh-huh!\" I said, smiling. Anders just stared at me.  I turned to the storage lockers. \"Let's see this junk they were suddenly deprived of.\"  Anders, after a puzzled frown, obediently threw open the doors of the riveted tiers of metal boxes along the rear wall; the wall next to the firing chambers, which I had no particular desire to visit. I glanced inside at the articles therein, and noted with interest their similarity.  \"Now, then,\" I resumed, \"the thrust of this rocket to get from Mars to Earth is calculated with regard to the mass on board, is that correct?\" He nodded. \"Good, that clears up an important point. I'd also like to know if this rocket has a dehumidifying system to keep the cast-off moisture from the passengers out of the air?\"  \"Well, sure, sir!\" said Anders. \"Otherwise, we'd all be swimming in our own sweat after a ten-hour trip across space!\"  \"Have you checked the storage tanks?\" I asked. \"Or is the cast-off perspiration simply jetted into space?\"  \"No. It's saved, sir. It gets distilled and stored for washing and drinking. Otherwise, we'd all dehydrate, with no water to replace the water we lost.\"  \"Check the tanks,\" I said.  Anders, shaking his head, moved into the pilot's section and looked at a dial there. \"Full, sir. But that's because I didn't drink very much, and any sweating I did--which was a hell of a lot, in this case--was a source of new water for the tanks.\"  \"Uh-huh.\" I paused and considered. \"I suppose the tubing for these tanks is all over the ship? In all the hollow bulkhead space, to take up the moisture fast?\"  Anders, hopelessly lost, could only nod wearily.  \"Would it hold--\" I did some quick mental arithmetic--\"let's say, about twenty-four extra cubic feet?\"  He stared, then frowned, and thought hard. \"Yes, sir,\" he said, after a minute. \"Even twice that, with no trouble, but--\" He caught himself short. It didn't pay to be too curious about the aims of an Amnesty-bearer.  \"It's all right, Anders. You've been a tremendous help. Just one thing. When you left Mars, you took off from the night side, didn't you?\"  \"Why, yes, I did, sir. But how did you--?\"  \"No matter, Anders. That'll be all.\"  \"Yes, sir!\" He saluted sharply and started off.  I started back for Interplanetary Security, and my second--and I hoped, last--interview with Chief Baxter. I had a slight inkling why the Brain had chosen me; because, in the affair of the missing Space Scouts, my infallible talent for spotting the True within the Apparent had come through nicely. I had found a very interesting clinker.     4   \"Strange,\" I remarked to Chief Baxter when I was seated once again in his office, opposite his newly replaced desk. \"I hardly acted like myself out at that airfield. I was brusque, highhanded, austere, almost malevolent with the pilot. And I'm ordinarily on the shy side, as a matter of fact.\"  \"It's the Amnesty that does it,\" he said, gesturing toward the disc. It lay on his desk, now, along with the collapser. I felt, with the new information I'd garnered, that my work was done, and that the new data fed into the Brain would produce some other results, not involving me.  I looked at the Amnesty, then nodded. \"Kind of gets you, after awhile. To know that you are the most influential person in creation is to automatically act the part. A shame, in a way.\"  \"The hell it is!\" Baxter snapped. \"Good grief, man, why'd you think the Amnesty was created in the first place?\"  I sat up straight and scratched the back of my head. \"Now you mention it, I really don't know. It seems a pretty dangerous thing to have about, the way people jump when they see it.\"  \"It is dangerous, of course, but it's vitally necessary. You're young, Jery Delvin, and even the finest history course available these days is slanted in favor of World Government. So you have no idea how tough things were before the Amnesty came along. Ever hear of red tape?\"  I shook my head. \"No, I don't believe so. Unless it had something to do with the former communist menace? They called themselves the Reds, I believe....\"  He waved me silent. \"No connection at all, son. No, red tape was, well, involvement. Forms to be signed, certain factors to be considered, protocol to be dealt with, government agencies to be checked with, classifications, bureaus, sub-bureaus, congressional committees. It was impossible, Jery, my boy, to get anything done whatsoever without consulting someone else. And the time lag and paperwork involved made accurate and swift action impossible, sometimes. What we needed, of course, was a person who could simply have all authority, in order to save the sometimes disastrous delays. So we came up with the Amnesty.\"  \"But the danger. If you should pick the wrong man--\"  Baxter smiled. \"No chance of that, Jery. We didn't leave it up to any committee or bureau or any other faction to do the picking. Hell, that would have put us right back where we'd been before. No, we left it up to the Brain. We'd find ourselves in a tight situation, and the Brain after being fed the data, would come up with either a solution, or a name.\"  I stared at him. \"Then, when I was here before, I was here solely to receive the Amnesty, is that it?\"  Baxter nodded. \"The Brain just picks the men. Then we tell the men the situation, hand over the Amnesty, and pray.\"  I had a sudden thought. \"Say, what happens if two men are selected by the Brain? Who has authority over whom?\"  Baxter grimaced and shivered. \"Don't even think such a thing! Even your mentioning such a contingency gives me a small migraine. It'd be unprecedented in the history of the Brain or the Amnesty.\" He grinned, suddenly. \"Besides, it can't happen. There's only one of these--\" he tapped the medallion gently \"--in existence, Jery. So we couldn't have such a situation!\"  I sank back into the contour chair, and glanced at my watch. Much too late to go back to work. I'd done a lot in one day, I reasoned. Well, the thing was out of my hands. Baxter had the information I'd come up with, and it had been coded and fed to the Brain. As soon as the solution came through, I could be on my way back to the world of hard and soft sell.  \"You understand,\" said Baxter suddenly, \"that you're to say nothing whatever about the disappearance of the Space Scouts until this office makes the news public? You know what would happen if this thing should leak!\"  The intercom on Baxter's desk suddenly buzzed, and a bright red light flashed on. \"Ah!\" he said, thumbing a knob. \"Here we go, at last!\"  As he exerted pressure on the knob, a thin slit in the side of the intercom began feeding out a long sheet of paper; the new answer from the Brain. It reached a certain length, then was automatically sheared off within the intercom, and the sheet fell gently to the desktop. Baxter picked it up and swiftly scanned its surface. A look of dismay overrode his erstwhile genial features.  I had a horrible suspicion. \"Not again?\" I said softly.  Baxter swore under his breath. Then he reached across the desktop and tossed me the Amnesty.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I hope you know what you're doing,\" said Baxter at the gleaming glass doorway of the spaceport. \"Why a man who has absolute authority should choose to ride public transportation when he could have his pick of the fleetest government ships on Earth--\"  I didn't tell him it was because of little details like stereovision, autobars, and, not least of all, comfort, that I had chosen to ride the _Valkyrie_.

Small objects moved around it, so small that Shefford thought he saw several dogs led by a child. But it was the distance that deceived him. There was a man down there watering his horses. That reminded Shefford of the duty owing to his own tired and thirsty beast. Whereupon he untied his pack, took off the saddle, and was about ready to start down when the Indian girl grasped the bridle from his hand.  “Me go,” she said.  He saw her eyes then, and they made her look different. They were as black as her hair. He was puzzled to decide whether or not he thought her handsome.  “Thanks, but I'll go,” he replied, and, taking the bridle again, he started down the slope. At every step he sank into the deep, soft sand. Down a little way he came upon a pile of tin cans; they were everywhere, buried, half buried, and lying loose; and these gave evidence of how the trader lived. Presently Shefford discovered that the Indian girl was following him with her own pony. Looking upward at her against the light, he thought her slender, lithe, picturesque. At a distance he liked her.  He plodded on, at length glad to get out of the drifts of sand to the hard level floor of the valley. This, too, was sand, but dried and baked hard, and red in color. At some season of the year this immense flat must be covered with water. How wide it was, and empty! Shefford experienced again a feeling that had been novel to him--and it was that he was loose, free, unanchored, ready to veer with the wind. From the foot of the slope the water hole had appeared to be a few hundred rods out in the valley. But the small size of the figures made Shefford doubt; and he had to travel many times a few hundred rods before those figures began to grow. Then Shefford made out that they were approaching him.  Thereafter they rapidly increased to normal proportions of man and beast. When Shefford met them he saw a powerful, heavily built young man leading two ponies.  “You're Mr. Presbrey, the trader?” inquired Shefford.  “Yes, I'm Presbrey, without the Mister,” he replied.  “My name's Shefford. I'm knocking about on the desert. Rode from beyond Tuba to-day.”  “Glad to see you,” said Presbrey. He offered his hand. He was a stalwart man, clad in gray shirt, overalls, and boots. A shock of tumbled light hair covered his massive head; he was tanned, but not darkly, and there was red in his cheeks; under his shaggy eyebrows were deep, keen eyes; his lips were hard and set, as if occasion for smiles or words was rare; and his big, strong jaw seemed locked.  “Wish more travelers came knocking around Red Lake,” he added. “Reckon here's the jumping-off place.”  “It's pretty--lonesome,” said Shefford, hesitating as if at a loss for words.  Then the Indian girl came up. Presbrey addressed her in her own language, which Shefford did not understand. She seemed shy and would not answer; she stood with downcast face and eyes. Presbrey spoke again, at which she pointed down the valley, and then moved on with her pony toward the water-hole.  Presbrey's keen eyes fixed on the receding black dot far down that oval expanse.  “That fellow left--rather abruptly,” said Shefford, constrainedly. “Who was he?”  “His name's Willetts. He's a missionary. He rode in to-day with this Navajo girl. He was taking her to Blue Cañon, where he lives and teaches the Indians. I've met him only a few times. You see, not many white men ride in here. He's the first white man I've seen in six months, and you're the second. Both the same day!... Red Lake's getting popular! It's queer, though, his leaving. He expected to stay all night. There's no other place to stay. Blue Cañon is fifty miles away.”  “I'm sorry to say--no, I'm not sorry, either--but I must tell you I was the cause of Mr. Willetts leaving,” replied Shefford.  “How so?” inquired the other.  Then Shefford related the incident following his arrival.  “Perhaps my action was hasty,” he concluded, apologetically. “I didn't think. Indeed, I'm surprised at myself.”  Presbrey made no comment and his face was as hard to read as one of the distant bluffs.  “But what did the man mean?” asked Shefford, conscious of a little heat. “I'm a stranger out here. I'm ignorant of Indians--how they're controlled. Still I'm no fool.... If Willetts didn't mean evil, at least he was brutal.”  “He was teaching her religion,” replied Presbrey. His tone held faint scorn and implied a joke, but his face did not change in the slightest.  Without understanding just why, Shefford felt his conviction justified and his action approved. Then he was sensible of a slight shock of wonder and disgust.  “I am--I was a minister of the Gospel,” he said to Presbrey. “What you hint seems impossible. I can't believe it.”  “I didn't hint,” replied Presbrey, bluntly, and it was evident that he was a sincere, but close-mouthed, man. “Shefford, so you're a preacher?... Did you come out here to try to convert the Indians?”  “No. I said I WAS a minister. I am no longer. I'm just a--a wanderer.”  “I see. Well, the desert's no place for missionaries, but it's good for wanderers.... Go water your horse and take him up to the corral. You'll find some hay for him. I'll get grub ready.”  Shefford went on with his horse to the pool. The water appeared thick, green, murky, and there was a line of salty crust extending around the margin of the pool. The thirsty horse splashed in and eagerly bent his head. But he did not like the taste. Many times he refused to drink, yet always lowered his nose again. Finally he drank, though not his fill. Shefford saw the Indian girl drink from her hand. He scooped up a handful and found it too sour to swallow. When he turned to retrace his steps she mounted her pony and followed him.  A golden flare lit up the western sky, and silhouetted dark and lonely against it stood the trading-post. Upon his return Shefford found the wind rising, and it chilled him. When he reached the slope thin gray sheets of sand were blowing low, rising, whipping, falling, sweeping along with soft silken rustle. Sometimes the gray veils hid his boots. It was a long, toilsome climb up that yielding, dragging ascent, and he had already been lame and tired. By the time he had put his horse away twilight was everywhere except in the west. The Indian girl left her pony in the corral and came like a shadow toward the house.  Shefford had difficulty in finding the foot of the stairway. He climbed to enter a large loft, lighted by two lamps. Presbrey was there, kneading biscuit dough in a pan.  “Make yourself comfortable,” he said.  The huge loft was the shape of a half-octagon. A door opened upon the valley side, and here, too, there were windows. How attractive the place was in comparison with the impressions gained from the outside! The furnishings consisted of Indian blankets on the floor, two beds, a desk and table, several chairs and a couch, a gun-rack full of rifles, innumerable silver-ornamented belts, bridles, and other Indian articles upon the walls, and in one corner a wood-burning stove with teakettle steaming, and a great cupboard with shelves packed full of canned foods.  Shefford leaned in the doorway and looked out. Beneath him on a roll of blankets sat the Indian girl, silent and motionless. He wondered what was in her mind, what she would do, how the trader would treat her. The slope now was a long slant of sheeted moving shadows of sand. Dusk had gathered in the valley. The bluffs loomed beyond. A pale star twinkled above. Shefford suddenly became aware of the intense nature of the stillness about him. Yet, as he listened to this silence, he heard an intermittent and immeasurably low moan, a fitful, mournful murmur. Assuredly it was only the wind. Nevertheless, it made his blood run cold. It was a different wind from that which had made music under the eaves of his Illinois home. This was a lonely, haunting wind, with desert hunger in it, and more which he could not name. Shefford listened to this spirit-brooding sound while he watched night envelop the valley. How black, how thick the mantle! Yet it brought no comforting sense of close-folded protection, of walls of soft sleep, of a home. Instead there was the feeling of space, of emptiness, of an infinite hall down which a mournful wind swept streams of murmuring sand.  “Well, grub's about ready,” said Presbrey.  “Got any water?” asked Shefford.  “Sure. There in the bucket. It's rain-water. I have a tank here.”  Shefford's sore and blistered face felt better after he had washed off the sand and alkali dust.  “Better not wash your face often while you're in the desert. Bad plan,”  went on Presbrey, noting how gingerly his visitor had gone about his ablutions. “Well, come and eat.”  Shefford marked that if the trader did live a lonely life he fared well. There was more on the table than twice two men could have eaten. It was the first time in four days that Shefford had sat at a table, and he made up for lost opportunity.  His host's actions indicated pleasure, yet the strange, hard face never relaxed, never changed. When the meal was finished Presbrey declined assistance, had a generous thought of the Indian girl, who, he said, could have a place to eat and sleep down-stairs, and then with the skill and despatch of an accomplished housewife cleared the table, after which work he filled a pipe and evidently prepared to listen.  It took only one question for Shefford to find that the trader was starved for news of the outside world; and for an hour Shefford fed that appetite, even as he had been done by. But when he had talked himself out there seemed indication of Presbrey being more than a good listener.  “How'd you come in?” he asked, presently.  “By Flagstaff--across the Little Colorado--and through Moencopie.”  “Did you stop at Moen Ave?”  “No. What place is that?”  “A missionary lives there. Did you stop at Tuba?”  “Only long enough to drink and water my horse. That was a wonderful spring for the"]]]
