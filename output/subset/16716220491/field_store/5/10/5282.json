It was larger than the stars around it, but many of them were nearly as bright.  A high-pitched male voice said: \"Citizen Germyn, good morning.\"  Germyn was caught off balance. He took his eyes off the sky, half turned, glanced at the face of the person who had spoken to him, raised his hand in the assurance-of-identity sign. It was all very quick and fluid--almost too quick, for he had had his fingers bent nearly into the sign for female friends and this was a man. Citizen Boyne. Germyn knew him well; they had shared the Ice Viewing at Niagara a year before.  Germyn recovered quickly enough, but it had been disconcerting.  He improvised swiftly: \"There are stars, but are stars still there if there is no Sun?\" It was a hurried effort, he grieved, but no doubt Boyne would pick it up and carry it along. Boyne had always been very good, very graceful.  Boyne did no such thing. \"Good morning,\" he said again, faintly. He glanced at the stars overhead, as though trying to unravel what Germyn was talking about. He said accusingly, his voice cracking sharply: \"There isn't any Sun, Germyn. What do you think of that?\"  Germyn swallowed. \"Citizen, perhaps you--\"  \"No Sun, you hear me!\" the man sobbed. \"It's cold, Germyn. The Pyramids aren't going to give us another Sun, do you know that? They're going to starve us, freeze us; they're through with us. We're done, all of us!\" He was nearly screaming.  All up and down Pine Street, people were trying not to look at him and some of them were failing.  Boyne clutched at Germyn helplessly. Revolted, Germyn drew back--_bodily contact!_  It seemed to bring the man to his senses. Reason returned to his eyes. He said: \"I--\" He stopped, stared about him. \"I think I'll have bread for breakfast,\" he said foolishly, and plunged into the stall.  Boyne left behind him a shaken Citizen, caught halfway into the wrist-flip of parting, staring after him with jaw slack and eyes wide, as though Germyn had no manners, either.  All this on Sun Re-creation Day!  What could it mean? Germyn wondered fretfully, worriedly.  Was Boyne on the point of--  Could Boyne be about to--  Germyn drew back from the thought. There was one thing that might explain Boyne's behavior. But it was not a proper speculation for one Citizen to make about another.  All the same--Germyn dared the thought--all the same, it _did_ seem almost as though Citizen Boyne were on the point of--well, running amok.         *       *       *       *       *  At the oatmeal stall, Glenn Tropile thumped on the counter. The laggard oatmeal vendor finally brought the ritual bowl of salt and the pitcher of thin milk. Tropile took his paper twist of salt from the top of the neatly arranged pile in the bowl. He glanced at the vendor. His fingers hesitated. Then, quickly, he ripped the twist of paper into his oatmeal and covered it to the permitted level with the milk.  He ate quickly and efficiently, watching the street outside.  They were wandering and mooning about, as always--maybe today more than most days, since they hoped it would be the day the Sun blossomed flame once more.  Tropile always thought of the wandering, mooning Citizens as _they_. There was a _we_ somewhere for Tropile, no doubt, but Tropile had not as yet located it, not even in the bonds of the marriage contract.  He was in no hurry. At the age of fourteen, Glenn Tropile had reluctantly come to realize certain things about himself--that he disliked being bested, that he had to have a certain advantage in all his dealings, or an intolerable itch of the mind drove him to discomfort. The things added up to a terrifying fear, gradually becoming knowledge, that the only we that could properly include him was one that it was not very wise to join.  He had realized, in fact, that he was a Wolf.  For some years, Tropile had struggled against it, for Wolf was an obscene word; the children he played with were punished severely for saying it, and for almost nothing else.  It was not _proper_ for one Citizen to advantage himself at the expense of another; Wolves did that.  It was _proper_ for a Citizen to accept what he had, not to strive for more, to find beauty in small things, to accommodate himself, with the minimum of strain and awkwardness, to whatever his life happened to be.  Wolves were not like that. Wolves never meditated, Wolves never Appreciated, Wolves _never_ were Translated--that supreme fulfillment, granted only to those who succeeded in a perfect meditation, that surrender of the world and the flesh by taking leave of both, which could never be achieved by a Wolf.  Accordingly, Glenn Tropile had tried very hard to do all the things that Wolves could not do.  He had nearly succeeded. His specialty, Water Watching, had been most rewarding. He had achieved many partly successful meditations on Connectivity.  And yet he was still a Wolf, for he still felt that burning, itching urge to triumph and to hold an advantage. For that reason, it was almost impossible for him to make friends among the Citizens; and gradually he had almost stopped trying.  Tropile had arrived in Wheeling nearly a year before, making him one of the early settlers in point of time. And yet there was not a Citizen in the street who was prepared to exchange recognition gestures with him.  _He_ knew _them_, nearly every one. He knew their names and their wives' names. He knew what northern states they had moved down from with the spreading of the ice, as the sun grew dim. He knew very nearly to the quarter of a gram what stores of sugar and salt and coffee each one of them had put away--for their guests, of course, not for themselves; the well-bred Citizen hoarded only for the entertainment of others.  Tropile knew these things because there was an advantage in knowing them. But there was no advantage in having anyone know him.  A few did--that banker, Germyn; Tropile had approached him only a few months before about a prospective loan. But it had been a chancy, nervous encounter. The idea was so luminously simple to Tropile--organize an expedition to the coal mines that once had flourished nearby, find the coal, bring it to Wheeling, heat the houses. And yet it had seemed blasphemous to Germyn. Tropile had counted himself lucky merely to have been refused the loan, instead of being cried out upon as Wolf.         *       *       *       *       *  The oatmeal vendor was fussing worriedly around his neat stack of paper twists in the salt bowl.  Tropile avoided the man's eyes. Tropile was not interested in the little wry smile of self-deprecation which the vendor would make to him, given half a chance. Tropile knew well enough what was disturbing the vendor. Let it disturb him. It was Tropile's custom to take extra twists of salt. They were in his pockets now; they would stay there. Let the vendor wonder why he was short.  Tropile licked the bowl of his spoon and stepped into the street. He was comfortably aware under a double-thick parka that the wind was blowing very cold.  A Citizen passed him, walking alone: odd, thought Tropile. He was walking rapidly and there was a look of taut despair on his face. Still more odd. Odd enough to be worth another look, because that sort of haste, that sort of abstraction, suggested something to Tropile. They were in no way normal to the gentle sheep of the class _They_, except in one particular circumstance.  Glenn Tropile crossed the street to follow the abstracted Citizen, whose name, he knew, was Boyne. The man blundered into Citizen Germyn outside the baker's stall, and Tropile stood back out of easy sight, watching and listening.  Boyne was on the ragged edge of breakdown. What Tropile heard and saw confirmed his diagnosis. The one particular circumstance was close to happening--Citizen Boyne was on the verge of running amok.  Tropile looked at the man with amusement and contempt. Amok! The gentle sheep _could_ be pushed too far. He had seen Citizens run amok, the signs were obvious.  There was pretty sure to be an advantage in it for Glenn Tropile. There was an advantage in almost anything, if you looked for it.  He watched and waited. He picked his spot with care, so that he could see Citizen Boyne inside the baker's stall, making a dismal botch of slashing his quarter-kilo of bread from the Morning Loaf.  He waited for Boyne to come racing out....  Boyne did.  A yell--loud, piercing. It was Citizen Germyn, shrilling: \"Amok, amok!\" A scream. An enraged wordless cry from Boyne, and the baker's knife glinting in the faint light as Boyne swung it. And then Citizens were scattering in every direction--all of the Citizens but one.  One Citizen was under the knife--his own knife, as it happened; it was the baker himself. Boyne chopped and chopped again. And then Boyne came out, roaring, the broad knife whistling about his head. The gentle Citizens fled panicked before him. He struck at their retreating forms and screamed and struck again. Amok.  It was the one particular circumstance when they forgot to be gracious--one of the two, Tropile corrected himself as he strolled across to the baker's stall. His brow furrowed, because there was another circumstance when they lacked grace, and one which affected him nearly.         *       *       *       *       *  He watched the maddened creature, Boyne, already far down the road, chasing a knot of Citizens around a corner. Tropile sighed and stepped into the baker's stall to see what he might gain from this.  Boyne would wear himself out--the surging rage would leave him as quickly as it came; he would be a sheep again and the other sheep would close in and capture him. That was what happened when a Citizen ran amok. It was a measure of what pressures were on the Citizens that, at any moment, there might be one gram of pressure too much and one of them would crack.

What happened to Frank Jacklin? Or is that part of the gag?\"  Tolan turned and stared at me with an official glitter in his Navy (Reserve) eye. \"Jacklin? He _was_ at Kwajalein with me, now that I think of it. A skinny sort of s.o.b., wasn't he?\"  \"I wouldn't say that,\" I hotly rejoined. \"I thought he was a pretty decent sort of guy. Where is he?\"  \"Jacklin? Oh, he got another half-stripe last January and was given some screw-ball assignment which took him out of touch. He'll turn up sooner or later, without a scratch; those New Dealers always do.\"  \"Say,\" Tolan added. \"You always did have a Jacklin fixation but you never had a good word to say for the louse. What did he ever do to you, anyhow? Ever since I've known you, you've always been griping about him, specially since he got into uniform. Lay off, will you, and give us honest hard-drinking guys a chance to get a breath. Period.\"  I took my drink and sipped it attentively. Whatever had happened to me since the thorium bomb burst off Adak, this was Scotch and it was cold, so I doubted that this place was Hell. Probably it was all a dream in the last split-second of disintegration.  \"Thanks, Ranty, that feels better. Now I've got to be going.\"  \"Winnie,\" drawled one of the brokers, \"tell us who she is this time. You ought to stop chasing at your age and blood-pressure or let your friends in on the secret.\"  \"This time,\" I said, \"I'm going home.\"  The steward came around from the bar and helped me into a fine fur-lined overcoat which I assumed was the lawful property of Winnie Tompkins.  \"There were two telephone messages for you, sir, while you were dozing,\" he said.  \"Who were they from, Tammy?\"  \"The first one, sir, was from the vet's to say that Ponto--that would be your dog, sir--would recover after all. He was the one that had distemper so bad, wasn't it, sir? I remember you told me that he was expected to die any minute. Well, now, the vet says he will recover. The second call, sir, was from Mrs. Tompkins. She asked if you had left for your home.\"  \"What did you tell her, Tammy?\" I asked.  \"Why, what you told me, sir, of course, when you came in, sir. I said that you hadn't been in all day, but that I would deliver any messages.\"  Wait a minute, Jacklin, I said to myself. Let's figure this one out. We were blown up on the Alaska, off the westernmost Aleutians, and now we find ourselves at the Pond Club, in New York City, masquerading in the flabby body of Winnie Tompkins. This must be Purgatory, since nobody who has ever been there would call the Pond--or, as the initiates prefer, the Puddle--either Heaven or Hell. This is one of those damned puzzles designed to test our intelligence. My cue is to turn in the best and most convincing performance as Winnie Tompkins, who has undoubtedly been sent to Hell. If we pass, we'll be like the rats the scientists send racing through mazes: we'll get the cheese and move on up. If we flunk, we'll be sent down, as the English say. Ingenious deity, the Manager!  \"Tammy,\" I said, \"will you get me the latest Social Register?\"  \"Certainly, sir.\"  I sat down by the door and thumbed through the testament of social acceptability as measured in Manhattan. There I was: Winfred S. (Sturgis) Tompkins. Born, New York City, April 27, 1898. St. Mark's School, Southboro, Mass., 1916. Harvard, A. B. 1920. Married: Miss Germaine Lewis Schuyler, of New York City, 1936. Clubs: Porcellian, Pond, Racquet, Harvard, Westchester Country. Residence: \"Pook's Hill,\" Bedford Hills, N.Y. Office: No. 1 Wall Street, N.Y.C.  \"Thanks, Tammy,\" I said and returned the register to him.  Then I reached inside my coat and pulled out the well-stuffed pocket-book I found inside the suave tweeds. It was of ostrich-hide with W.S.T. in gold letters on it, and contained--in addition to some junk which I didn't bother to examine--sixty-one dollars in small bills and a new commutation-ticket between New York City and Bedford Hills, N.Y.  So far, so good. My sense of identity was building up rapidly. I felt in my trousers' pocket and found a bunch of keys and about a dollar and a half in silver. I peeled a five-dollar bill from the roll in the pocket-book and handed it to the club steward.  \"This is for you, Tammy, and a happy Easter Monday to you. If anyone calls, you haven't seen me all day.\"  \"Thank you very much, sir, I'm sure,\" he said, pocketing the five spot with the effortless ease of a prestidigitator or head-waiter.  I strolled out to the street--dusk was beginning to darken the city and already there were lights burning in the office windows--and walked across to the corner of Park Avenue. To my surprise, remembering New York, there were few taxis and those were already occupied. After about five minutes of vain waiting, I remembered reading somewhere of the cab shortage in the United States, and walked south to Grand Central. As I turned down Vanderbilt Avenue, I noticed something fairly bulky in the pocket of my overcoat. I stopped and dragged out two expensively tidy packages, with the Tiffany label on them. One was inscribed \"For Jimmie\" and the other \"For Virginia.\"  This represented a new puzzle--perhaps a trap--so I paid a dime for the use of one of the pay-toilets in the Terminal and unwrapped my find. The one marked for \"Jimmie\"--who might be, I guessed, my wife Germaine--was a neat little solid gold bracelet, the sort of thing you give your eldest niece on graduation day. The one marked \"Virginia\" contained a diamond-brooch of the kind all too rarely given to a girl for any good reason.  \"Uh-uh!\" I shook my head. Whoever \"Virginia\" might be, she was obviously not my wife and the Social Register had not mentioned any children, ex-wives or such appertaining to Winnie Tompkins. And you don't give diamonds to your aged aunt or your mother-in-law. We can't have Winnie start off his new life by palming off mere gold on his wedded wife and diamonds on the Other Woman, I decided. So I switched the labels on the packages and returned to circulation in time to catch the 4:45 Westchester Express.         *       *       *       *       *  Here, I resorted to a low subterfuge. Instead of the broker's bible, \"The New York Sun,\" with its dim view of all that had happened to the commuting public since 1932, I was coward enough to disguise myself by buying a copy of \"P.M.\" in order to lessen the risk of being recognized by fellow-passengers whom I certainly would not know by sight. I buried my face in that spirited journal, with its dim view of all that had ever happened outside the Soviet Union, as I slunk past the Club Car, and did not fully emerge from its gallant defense of the Negro and the Jew until I was in the smoker, directly behind the baggage compartment. The train was fairly crowded but I was able to find a seat far forward where few passengers could see my face. I decided that my strategy had been sound when the conductor, on punching my ticket, remarked: \"See you're not using the Club Car today, Mr. Tompkins. Shall I tell Mr. Snyder not to wait for you for gin rummy?\"  \"Don't tell him a thing, please,\" I begged. \"I'm feeling done in--a friend of mine was just killed in the Pacific--and I don't want to be bothered.\"  He clucked consolingly and passed on. I was lucky enough to reach Bedford Hills without other encounters and walked along the darkened platform until I spied a taxicab.  \"Can you drive me out to my place?\" I asked the driver.  \"Sure, Mr. Tompkins. Glad to,\" he replied. \"Goin' to leave your coop down here?\"  I nodded. \"Yep. I'm too damned tired to drive home. Got any other passengers?\"  \"Only a couple of maids from the Milgrim place,\" he said, \"but we can drop you first and let them off afterwards if you're feelin' low.\"  \"Hell, no!\" I insisted. \"This is a free country--first come first served. You can drive me on to Pook's Hill after you've left them at the Milgrim's. Perhaps they'd get in trouble if they were delayed.\"  The driver looked surprised and rather relieved.  \"Haven't heard of any employers firin' maids in these parts since Wilkie was a candidate,\" he said.  I climbed into the cab, across the rather shapely legs and domestic laps of two attractive-looking girls who murmured vaguely at me and then resumed a discussion of the awful cost of hair-do's. I felt rather pleased with myself. I seemed to have won at least one man's approval in the opening stages of my celestial rat-race. Now for my first meeting with the woman whom I had married nearly ten years ago, according to the Social Register. Surely she would recognize that there was something radically wrong with her husband before I had been five minutes at Pook's Hill. Why! I wouldn't know where the lavatory was, let alone her bedroom, and what should I call the maid who answered the door, assuming we had a maid?     CHAPTER 2   A pretty, dark-haired maid opened the door of \"Pook's Hill\" with a twitch of the hip that was wasted on Bedford Hills.  \"Oh, it's you!\" She remarked conversationally. \"Shall I tell Mrs. Tompkins you are here?\"  \"And why not?\" I asked.  She looked at me slant-eyed. \"Why not, sir? She must have forgotten to eat an apple this morning. That's why.\"  \"Where shall I dump my hat and coat, Mary?\" I asked guessing wildly at her name. Suburban maids were named Mary as often as not.  \"The name is Myrtle, Mr. Tompkins,\" she replied, and did not bother to add the \"as well you know\" she implied.  \"From now on, Myrtle, you shall be Mary so far as I am concerned. And where, Mary, shall I leave my hat and coat?\"  \"In the den, sir, of course. Come, I'll lend a hand. You've been drinking again.\"  The girl moved quite close to me, in helping me off with my things and it was only by a distinct effort of will that I refrained"]]]
