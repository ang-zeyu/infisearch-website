You think he can, don't you? Don't you?\"  \"He can do anything any space skipper has ever done, and more,\" said Sue Eagen, and her face glowed. \"But it isn't easy. Right this minute he's working over the computer--a small, simple, ship-board computer--working out orbital and positional and blast-intensity data that would be a hard nut for the giant calculators on Earth to crack. And he's doing it in half the time--or less--than it would take the average mathematician, because he has to; because it's a life-and-death matter if he makes a mistake or takes too long.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"But--but--\"  \"But what?\" Miss Eagen's composure seemed to have been blasted to shreds by the powerful currents of her indignation. Her eyes flashed. \"You mean, but why doesn't he just work the ship while it's spinning the same way he does when it isn't?\"  Through a growing fear, Marcia nodded mutely.  \"He'll spin the ship on its long axis,\" said the stewardess with exaggerated patience. \"That means that the steering jet tubes in the nose and tail are spinning, too. You don't just turn with a blast on one tube or another. The blasts have to be let off in hundreds of short bursts, timed to the hundredth of a second, to be able to make even a slight course correction. The sighting instruments are wheeling round and round while you're checking your position. Your fuel has to be calculated to the last ounce--because enough fuel for a Moon flight, with hours of fuelless free-fall, and enough fuel for a power spin and course corrections while spinning, are two very different things. Captain McHenry won't be able to maneuver to a landing on the Moon. He'll do it exactly right the first time, or not at all.\"  Marcia was white and still. \"I--I never--\"  \"But I haven't told you the toughest part of it yet,\" Miss Eagen went on inexorably. \"A ship as massive as this, spinning on its long axis, is a pretty fair gyroscope. It doesn't want to turn. Any force that tries to make it turn is resisted at right angles to the force applied. When that force is applied momentarily from jets, as they swing into position and away again, the firing formulas get--well, complex. And the ship's course and landing approach are completely new. Instead of letting the ship fall to the Moon, turning over and approaching tail-first with the main jets as brakes, Captain McHenry is going to have to start the spin first and go almost the whole way nose-first. He'll come up on the Moon obliquely, pass it, stop the spin, turn over once to check the speed of the ship, and once again to put the tail down when the Moon's gravity begins to draw us in. There'll be two short periods of free-fall there, but they won't be long enough to bother you much. And if we can do all that with the fuel we've got, it will be a miracle. A miracle from the brain of Captain McHenry.\"  Marcia forced herself away from the bulkhead with a small whimper of hurt and hatred--hatred of the stars, of this knowledgeable, inspired girl, and--even more so--of herself. She darted toward the door.  Miss Eagen was beside her in an instant, a hard small hand on her arm. \"Where are you going?\"  \"I'm going to stop him. He can't take that chance with his ship, with these people....\"  \"He will and he must. You surely know your husband.\"  \"I know him as well as you do.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Miss Eagen's firm lips shut in a thin hard line. \"Do as you like,\" she whispered. \"And while you're doing it--think about whom he's spinning ship for.\" She took her hand from Marcia's arm.  Marcia twisted away and went into the corridor.  She found herself at the entrance to the pilot room. In one sweeping glance she saw a curved, silver board. Before it a man sat tranquilly. Nearer to her was Jack, hunched over the keyboard of a complex, compact machine, like a harried bookkeeper on the last day of the month.  Her lips formed his name, but she was silent. She watched him, his square, competent hands, his detached and distant face. Through the forward view-plate she saw a harsh, jagged line, the very edge of the Moon's disc. Next to it, and below, was the rear viewer, holding the shimmering azure shape of Earth.  \"_All Earth watches me when I work, but with your eyes._\"  Jack had said that to her once, long ago, when he still loved her.  \"... human damnfoolishness botching up the equations....\" He had said that once, too.  Miss Eagen was standing by the hospital door, watching her. When Marcia turned away without speaking to Jack, Miss Eagen smiled and held out her hand.  Marcia went to her and took the hand. They went into the hospital. Miss Eagen didn't speak; she seemed to be waiting.  \"Yes, I know who Jack's spinning the ship for,\" said Marcia.  Miss Eagen looked an unspoken question.  Marcia said, painfully, \"He's like the Captain of the _Elsinore_. He's risking his life for a--a stranger. A jaywalker. Not for me. Not even for his baby.\"  \"Does it hurt to know that?\"  Marcia looked into the smooth, strong face and said with genuine astonishment, \"Hurt? Oh, no! It's so--so big!\"  There was a sudden thunder. Over Miss Eagen's shoulder, through the port, Marcia saw the stars begin to move. Miss Eagen followed her gaze. \"He's started the spin. You'll be all right now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Marcia could never recall the rest of the details of the trip. There was the outboard bulkhead that drew her like a magnet, increasingly, until suddenly it wasn't an attracting wall, but normally and naturally \"down.\" Then a needle, and another one, and a long period of deep drowsiness and unreality.  But through and through that drugged, relaxed period, Jack and the stars, the Moon and Sue Eagen danced and wove. Words slipped in and out of it like shreds of melody:  \"A man comes to love the things he has to fight for.\" And Jack fighting--for his ship, for the Moon, for the new-building traditions of the great ones who would carry humanity out to the stars.  Sue Eagen was there, too, and the thing she shared with Jack. Of course there was something between them--so big a thing that there was nothing for her to fear in it.  Jack and Sue Eagen had always had it, and always would have; and now Marcia had it too. And with understanding replacing fear, Marcia was free to recall that Jack had worked with Sue Eagen--but it was Marcia that he had loved and married.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a long time of blackness, and then a time of agony, when she was falling, falling, and her lungs wanted to split, explode, disintegrate, and someone kept saying, \"Hold tight, Marcia; hold tight to me,\" and she found Sue Eagen's cool strong hands in hers.  _Marcia. She called me Marcia._  More blackness, more pain--but not so much this time; and then a long, deep sleep.  A curved ceiling, but a new curve, and soft rose instead of the gunmetal-and-chrome of the ship. White sheets, a new feeling of \"down\" that was unlike either Earth or the ship, a novel and exhilarating buoyancy. And kneeling by the bed--  \"Jack!\"  \"You're all right, honey.\"  She raised herself on her elbow and looked out through the unglazed window at the ordered streets of the great Luna Dome. \"The Moon.... Jack, you did it!\"  He snapped his fingers. He looked like a high-school kid. \"Nothin' to it.\" She could see he was very proud. Very tired, too. He reached out to touch her.  She drew back. \"You don't have to be sweet to me,\" she said quietly. \"I understand how you must feel.\"  \"Don't _have_ to?\" He rose, bent over her, and slid his arms around her. He put his face into the shadowed warmth between her hair and her neck and said, \"Listen, egghead, there's no absolute scale for courage. We had a bad time, both of us. After it was over, and I had a chance to think, I used it trying to look at things through your eyes. And that way I found out that when you walked up that gangway, you did the bravest thing I've ever known anyone to do. And you did it for me. It doesn't matter what else happened. Sue told me a lot about you that I didn't know, darling. You're ... real huge for your size. As for the bad part of what happened--nothing like it can ever happen again, can it?\"  He hugged her. After a time he reached down and touched her swelling waist. It was like a benediction. \"He'll be born on the Moon,\" he whispered, \"and he'll have eyes the color of all Earth when it looks out to the stars.\"  \"_She'll_ be born on the Moon,\" corrected Marcia, \"and her name will be Sue, and ... and she'll be almost as good as her father.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51037"],["title","Second Childhood (#1)"],["body","never follow. I don't know even a fraction of them and I listen to them carefully explain a relationship so tangled and trivial that it makes me yawn in their faces. It's all new to them and so old, so damned and damnably old to me.\"  \"Ancestor Young,\" said Stanford, \"you have seen Man spread out from Earth to distant stellar systems. You have seen the human race expand from one planet to several thousand planets. You have had a part in this. Is there not some satisfaction....\"  \"You're talking in abstracts,\" Young cut in. \"What I am concerned about is myself ... a certain specific mass of protoplasm shaped in biped form and tagged by the designation, ironic as it may seem, of Andrew Young. I have been unselfish all my life. I've asked little for myself. Now I am being utterly and entirely selfish and I ask that this matter be regarded as a personal problem rather than as a racial abstraction.\"  \"Whether you'll admit it or not,\" said Stanford, \"it is more than a personal problem. It is a problem which some day must be solved for the salvation of the race.\"  \"That is what I am trying to impress upon you,\" Young snapped. \"It is a problem that you must face. Some day you will solve it, but until you do, you must make provisions for those who face the unsolved problem.\"  \"Wait a while,\" counseled Chairman Riggs. \"Who knows? Today, tomorrow.\"  \"Or a million years from now,\" Young told him bitterly and left, a tall, vigorous-looking man whose step was swift in anger where normally it was slow with weariness and despair.         *       *       *       *       *  There was yet a chance, of course.  But there was little hope.  How can a man go back almost six thousand years and snare a thing he never understood?  And yet Andrew Young remembered it. Remembered it as clearly as if it had been a thing that had happened in the morning of this very day.  It was a shining thing, a bright thing, a happiness that was brand-new and fresh as a bluebird's wing of an April morning or a shy woods flower after sudden rain.  He had been a boy and he had seen the bluebird and he had no words to say the thing he felt, but he had held up his tiny fingers and pointed and shaped his lips to coo.  Once, he thought, I had it in my very fingers and I did not have the experience to know what it was, nor the value of it. And now I know the value, but it has escaped me--it escaped me on the day that I began to think like a human being. The first adult thought pushed it just a little and the next one pushed it farther and finally it was gone entirely and I didn't even know that it had gone.  He sat in the chair on the flagstone patio and felt the Sun upon him, filtering through the branches of trees misty with the breaking leaves of Spring.  Something else, thought Andrew Young. Something that was not human--yet. A tiny animal that had many ways to choose, many roads to walk. And, of course, I chose the wrong way. I chose the human way. But there was another way. I know there must have been. A fairy way--or a brownie way, or maybe even pixie. That sounds foolish and childish now, but it wasn't always.  I chose the human way because I was guided into it. I was pushed and shoved, like a herded sheep.  I grew up and I lost the thing I held.  He sat and made his mind go hard and tried to analyze what it was he sought and there was no name for it. Except happiness. And happiness was a state of being, not a thing to regain and grasp.         *       *       *       *       *  But he could remember how it felt. With his eyes open in the present, he could remember the brightness of the day of the past, the clean-washed goodness of it, the wonder of the colors that were more brilliant than he ever since had seen--as if it were the first second after Creation and the world was still shiningly new.  It was that new, of course. It would be that new to a child.  But that didn't explain it all.  It didn't explain the bottomless capacity for seeing and knowing and believing in the beauty and the goodness of a clean new world. It didn't explain the almost non-human elation of knowing that there were colors to see and scents to smell and soft green grass to touch.  I'm insane, Andrew Young said to himself. Insane, or going insane. But if insanity will take me back to an understanding of the strange perception I had when I was a child, and lost, I'll take insanity.  He leaned back in his chair and let his eyes go shut and his mind drift back.  He was crouching in a corner of a garden and the leaves were drifting down from the walnut trees like a rain of saffron gold. He lifted one of the leaves and it slipped from his fingers, for his hands were chubby still and not too sure in grasping. But he tried again and he clutched it by the stem in one stubby fist and he saw that it was not just a blob of yellowness, but delicate, with many little veins. When he held it so that the Sun struck it, he imagined that he could almost see through it, the gold was spun so fine.  He crouched with the leaf clutched tightly in his hand and for a moment there was a silence that held him motionless. Then he heard the frost-loosened leaves pattering all around him, pattering as they fell, talking in little whispers as they sailed down through the air and found themselves a bed with their golden fellows.  In that moment he knew that he was one with the leaves and the whispers that they made, one with the gold and the autumn sunshine and the far blue mist upon the hill above the apple orchard.  A foot crunched stone behind him and his eyes came open and the golden leaves were gone.  \"I am sorry if I disturbed you, Ancestor,\" said the man. \"I had an appointment for this hour, but I would not have disturbed you if I had known.\"  Young stared at him reproachfully without answering.  \"I am kin,\" the man told him.  \"I wouldn't doubt it,\" said Andrew Young. \"The Galaxy is cluttered up with descendants of mine.\"  The man was very humble. \"Of course, you must resent us sometimes. But we are proud of you, sir. I might almost say that we revere you. No other family--\"  \"I know,\" interrupted Andrew Young. \"No other family has any fossil quite so old as I am.\"  \"Nor as wise,\" said the man.  Andrew Young snorted. \"Cut out that nonsense. Let's hear what you have to say and get it over with.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The technician was harassed and worried and very frankly puzzled. But he stayed respectful, for one always was respectful to an ancestor, whoever he might be. Today there were mighty few left who had been born into a mortal world.  Not that Andrew Young looked old. He looked like all adults, a fine figure of a person in the early twenties.  The technician shifted uneasily. \"But, sir, this ... this....\"  \"Teddy bear,\" said Young.  \"Yes, of course. An extinct terrestrial subspecies of animal?\"  \"It's a toy,\" Young told him. \"A very ancient toy. All children used to have them five thousand years ago. They took them to bed.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The technician shuddered. \"A deplorable custom. Primitive.\"  \"Depends on the viewpoint,\" said Young. \"I've slept with them many a time. There's a world of comfort in one, I can personally assure you.\"  The technician saw that it was no use to argue. He might as well fabricate the thing and get it over with.  \"I can build you a fine model, sir,\" he said, trying to work up some enthusiasm. \"I'll build in a response mechanism so that it can give simple answers to certain keyed questions and, of course, I'll fix it so it'll walk, either on two legs or four....\"  \"No,\" said Andrew Young.  The technician looked surprised and hurt. \"No?\"  \"No,\" repeated Andrew Young. \"I don't want it fancied up. I want it a simple lump of make-believe. No wonder the children of today have no imagination. Modern toys entertain them with a bag of tricks that leave the young'uns no room for imagination. They couldn't possibly think up, on their own, all the screwy things these new toys do. Built-in responses and implied consciousness and all such mechanical trivia....\"  \"You just want a stuffed fabric,\" said the technician, sadly, \"with jointed arms and legs.\"  \"Precisely,\" agreed Young.  \"You're sure you want fabric, sir? I could do a neater job in plastics.\"  \"Fabric,\" Young insisted firmly, \"and it must be scratchy.\"  \"Scratchy, sir?\"  \"Sure. You know. Bristly. So it scratches when you rub your face against it.\"  \"But no one in his right mind would want to rub his face....\"  \"I would,\" said Andrew Young. \"I fully intend to do so.\"  \"As you wish, sir,\" the technician answered, beaten now.  \"When you get it done,\" said Young, \"I have some other things in mind.\"  \"Other things?\" The technician looked wildly about, as if seeking some escape.  \"A high chair,\" said Young. \"And a crib. And a woolly dog. And buttons.\"  \"Buttons?\" asked the technician. \"What are buttons?\"  \"I'll explain it all to you,\" Young told him airily. \"It all is very simple.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It seemed, when Andrew Young came into the room, that Riggs and Stanford had been expecting him, had known that he was coming and had been waiting for him.  He wasted no time on preliminaries or formalities.  They know, he told himself. They know, or they have guessed. They would be watching me. Ever since I brought in my petition, they have been watching me, wondering what I would be thinking, trying to puzzle out what I might do next. They know every move I've made, they know about the toys and the furniture and all the other things. And I don't need to tell them what I plan to do.  \"I need some help,\" he said, and they nodded soberly, as if they had guessed he needed help.  \"I want to build a house,\" he explained. \"A big house. Much larger than the usual house.\"  Riggs said, \"We'll draw the plans for you. Do anything else that you--\"  \"A house,\" Young went on, \"about four or five times as big as the ordinary house. Four or five times normal"]]]
