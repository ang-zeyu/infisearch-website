If you pull it about a little, you will find that you can separate it easily into parcels or slips running lengthways down the leg, each slip being fastened tight at either end, but loose between. Each slip is what is called =a muscle=. You will notice that many of these muscles are joined, sometimes at one end only, sometimes at both, to white or bluish white glistening cords or bands; made evidently of different material from the muscle itself. They are not soft and fleshy like the muscle, but firm and stiff. These are =tendons=. Sometimes they are broad and short, sometimes thin and long.  As you are separating these muscles from each other you will see (running down the leg between them) little white soft threads, very often branching out and getting too small to be seen. These are =nerves=. Between the muscles too are other little cords, red, or reddish black, and if you prick them, a drop or several drops of blood will ooze out. These are =veins=, and are not really cords or threads, but hollow tubes, filled with blood. Lying alongside the veins are similar small tubes, containing very little blood, or none at all. These are =arteries=. The =veins= and =arteries= together are called =blood-vessels=, and it will be easy for you to make out that the larger ones you see are really hollow tubes. Lastly, if you separate the muscles still more, you will come upon the hard =bone= in the middle of the leg, and if you look closely you will find that many of the muscles are fastened to this bone.  Now try to put back everything in its place, and you will find that though you have neither cut nor torn nor broken either muscle or blood-vessel or bone, you cannot get things back into their place again. Everything looks “messy.” This is partly because, though you have torn neither muscle nor blood-vessel, you have torn something which binds skin and muscle and fat and blood-vessels and bone all together; and if you look again you will see that between them there is a delicate stringy substance which binds and packs them all together, just as cotton-wool is used to pack up delicate toys and instruments. This stringy packing material which you have torn and spoilt is called =connective= because it connects all the parts together.  Well, then, in the leg (and it is just the same in the arm) we have skin, fat, muscle, tendons, blood-vessels, nerves, and bone all packed together with connective and covered with skin. These together form the solid leg. We may speak of them as =the tissues= of the leg.  =8.= If now you turn to the trunk and cut through the skin of the belly, you will first of all see muscles again, with nerves and blood-vessels as before. But when you carefully cut through the muscles (for you cannot easily separate them from each other here), you come upon something which you did not find in  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--_The Viscera of a Rabbit as seen upon simply opening the Cavities of the Thorax and Abdomen without any further Dissection._       _A_, cavity of the thorax, pleural cavity of either side; _B_,      diaphragm; _C_, ventricles of the heart; _D_, auricles; _E_,      pulmonary artery; _F_, aorta; _G_, lungs, collapsed, and occupying      only the back part of the chest; _H_, lateral portions of pleural      membranes; _I_, cartilage at the end of sternum; _K_, portion of      the wall of body left between thorax and abdomen; _a_, cut ends of      the ribs; _L_, the liver, in this case lying more to the left than      the right of the body; _M_, the stomach; _N_, duodenum; _O_, small      intestine; _P_, the cæcum, so largely developed in this and other      herbivorous animals; _Q_, the large intestine. ]  the leg, a =great cavity=. This is something quite new--there is nothing like it in the leg--a great cavity, quite filled with something, but still a great cavity; and if you slit the rabbit right up the front of its trunk and turn down or cut away the sides as has been done in Fig. 1, you will see that the whole trunk is =hollow= from top to bottom, from the neck to the legs.  If you look carefully you will see that the cavity is divided into two by a cross partition (Fig. 1, _B_) called the =diaphragm=. The part =below= the diaphragm is the larger of the two, and is called the =abdomen= or belly; in it you will see a large dark red mass, which is the =liver= (_L_). Near the liver is the smooth pale =stomach= (_M_), and filling up the rest of the abdomen you will see the coils of the =intestine= or bowel, very narrow in some parts (_O_), very broad (_P_ _Q_), broader even than the stomach, in others. If you pull the bowels on one side as you easily can do, you will find lying underneath them two small brownish red lumps, one on each side. These are the =kidneys=.  In the smaller cavity =above= the diaphragm, called the =thorax= or chest, you will see in the middle the =heart= (_C_), and on each side of the heart two pink bodies, which when you squeeze them feel spongy. These are the two =lungs= (_G_). You will notice that the heart and lungs do not fill up the cavity of the chest nearly so much as the liver, stomach, bowels, &c. fill up the cavity of the belly. In fact, in the chest there seems to be a large empty space. But as we shall see further on, the lungs did quite fill the chest before you opened it, but shrank up very much directly you cut into it, and so left the great space you see.  =9.= The trunk then is really a great chamber containing what are called the =viscera=, and divided into an upper and lower half, the upper half being filled with the heart and lungs, the lower with the liver, stomach, bowels, and some other organs. In front the abdomen is covered by skin and muscle only. But if all the sides of the trunk were made of such soft material it would be then a mere bag which could never keep its shape unless it were stuffed quite full. Some part of it must be strengthened and stiffened. And indeed the trunk is not a bag with soft yielding sides, but a box with walls which are in part firm and hard. You noticed that when you were cutting through the front of the chest you had to cut through several hard places. These were the =ribs= (Fig. 1, _a_), made either of hard bone or of a softer gristly substance called =cartilage=. And if you take away all the viscera from the cavity of the trunk and pass your finger along the back of the cavity, you will feel all the way down from the neck to the legs a hard part. This is the =backbone= or =vertebral column=. When you want to make a straw man stand upright you run a pole right through him to give him support. Such a support is the backbone to your own body, keeping the trunk from falling together.  In the abdomen nothing more is wanted than this backbone, the sides and front of the cavity being covered in with skin and muscle only. In the chest the sides are strengthened by the ribs, long thin hoops of bone which are fastened to the backbone behind and meet in front in a firm hard part, partly bone, partly cartilage, called the =sternum=.  But this backbone is not made of one long straight piece of bone. If it were you would never be able to bend your body. To enable you to do this it is made up of ever so many little flat round pieces of bone, laid one a-top of the other, with their flat sides carefully joined together, like so many bungs stuck together. Each of these little round flat pieces of the backbone is called a =vertebra=, and is of a very peculiar shape. Suppose you took a bung of bone, and fastened on to one side of its edge a ring of bone. That would represent a vertebra. The solid bung is what is called the =body=, and the hollow ring is what is called the =arch= of the vertebra. Now if you put a number of these bodies together one upon the top of the other, so that the bodies all came together and the rings all came together, you would have something very like the vertebral column (see Frontispiece, also Fig. 2). The bungs or bodies would make a solid jointed pillar, and the rings or arches would make together a tunnel or canal. And that is really what you have in the backbone. Only each vertebra is not exactly shaped like a bung and a ring; the body is very like a bung, but the arch is rough and jagged, and the bodies are joined together in a particular way. Still we have all the bodies of the vertebræ forming together a solid pillar which gives support to the trunk; and the arches forming together a tunnel or canal which is called the =spinal canal=, (Fig. 2, _C.S._) the use of which we shall see  [Illustration: FIG. 2.       A, a diagrammatic view of the human body cut in half lengthways.      _C.S._, the cavity of the brain and spinal cord; _N_, that of the      nose; _M_, that of the mouth; _Al.

B, a transverse vertical section of the head taken along the line      _a b_; letters as before.       C, a transverse section taken along the line _c d_; letters as      before. ]  directly. The round flat body of each vertebra is turned to the front towards the cavity of the trunk, and it is the row of vertebral bodies which you feel as a hard ridge when you pass your fingers down the back of the abdomen. The arches are at the back of the bodies, so you cannot feel them in the abdomen; but if you turn the rabbit on its belly and pass your finger down its back, you will feel through the skin (and you can feel the same on your own body) a sharp edge, formed by what are called the spines, _i.e._ the uneven tips of the arches of the vertebræ (Fig. 2) all the way down the back.  So that what we really have in the trunk is this. In front a large cavity, containing the viscera, and surrounded in the upper part or thorax by hoops of bone, but not (or only slightly) in the lower part or abdomen; behind, a much smaller long narrow cavity or canal formed by the arches of the vertebræ, and therefore surrounded by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53356"],["title","Kate Vernon: A Tale.

I must write to Moore this very day, I'll be in time for the Irish post, give me my desk, Kate.\"  \"But suppose this man insists on the production of these papers, and you cannot satisfy him?\" asked Kate, as she was leaving the room after arranging the Colonel's writing materials.  He looked up with a sudden expression of pain in his noble, benevolent countenance.  \"We shall be beggars, my child! that's all.\"  Miss Vernon walked into the drawing-room, and opened the piano mechanically; while her thoughts were busily engaged in conjecturing whether the lingering debility of indisposition, rather than justly grounded fears, prompted her grandfather's gloomy view of Lady Desmond's intelligence.  \"Shall we then really know the poverty, nurse talks of? Shall I be strong enough to say, in sincerity, '_Thy will be done!_'\"  But soon these gloomy speculations gave place to the pleasanter topic of her cousin's invitation, which seemed to have escaped her grandfather's notice.  She had been _thus_ meditating for some time, when nurse entered with a letter in her hand.  \"The master's love, Miss Kate, and if it's not too early he'd like you to go out wid him, he says he does not feel so well!\"  \"Yes, nurse, I will go and get my bonnet and shawl, when I have settled this music.\"  \"Faith now, alannah, I'm not plaised at all with the looks iv him!\"  \"How?\" said Kate, suspending her occupation of replacing the books in the music-stand, and looking up anxiously in Mrs. O'Toole's face, which wore an unusual look of care, especially about the depressed corners of her expressive mouth.  \"Sorra one iv me can tell why, but he looks like as when a big black cloud is beginin' to be dhrawn over the sun in a fine summer's day; he just sits in the chair tired like; an ses he, 'only one letther for the post, nurse,' ses he, 'but be sure it's in time for the Irish maal,' and then he give me the message, I gave yes. The Cross iv Christ betune us an harum, ses I, as soon as I see 'J. Moore, Esquire,' on the letther; how are we to have luck or grace when we have any thing to say to the man that sould Dungar, an give it up to the spalpeen that has it now; look Miss Kate, thim's the Esquires that's going now! Faith an I remember Paddy Moore, his father, carrying sacks iv corn to the mill, an meself own maid up at the big house! Ay, then, J. Moore, Esquire, ye'r the first esquire in yer family, any ways, an there was ever an always sorra to sup when there was letthers goin back an forward betune you an the masther!\"  \"But, nurse, I have always heard that Mr. Moore was an upright honourable man, and I hope grandpapa's letter will be only productive of good.\"  \"Well, well, may be so, but I'd a mighty quare dhrame both last night an the night afore. Oh, ye may laugh now, Miss Kate, but no matther! I seen the masther as plain as I see yer own sweet face forenent me, slippin, slippin down a steep slim place wid the say roarin mad ondher, an you houlding him for the dear life, an yer round white arms all strained an tremblin wid the weight that was too much for yez, an I couldn't help yez, tho' I struve an struve to run to yez; an in the struggle I woke up, all in a shake; an God forgive the word, but it's a mighty bad dhrame intirely!\"  \"No, Nurse--you say dreams go by contraries, so it is grandpapa that will be ascending some lofty eminence and dragging me after him.\"  \"It was in the mornin', asthore, in the mornin' I dhreamt it.\"  \"Never mind, nurse, if so, God will lend these slight arms strength for all that may be required of them--do not tell me any more dreams now, I must go to grandpapa.\"  \"Sweet Mary, shield ye darlint!\" ejaculated Mrs. O'Toole, as she looked after her nursling, \"but we've rested so long widout them thieving attorneys, I don't like to see them beginin' their letthers agin. _J. Moore, esquire!_ the divil go wid such esquires! amen.\"  Fearful and wonderful indeed is our spiritual organisation. Reason may smile at fears, unsubstantiated by any tangible motive, but the instant her accents of reproof have ceased, lo! the same formless and gnawing terror steals back, undiminished by one iota of its influence, to depress the soul, until again routed by reason's disciplined troops; a true guerilla warfare in which the irregular forces, ever ready to disperse and reassemble, always repulsed, but never conquered, are sure to wear out resistance in the end.  So Kate Vernon, in spite of her clear and cultivated intellect, her sound judgment, and her sense of the ridiculous, could not keep nurse's evil omen from dwelling on her mind; more, ay, a thousand times more, than her grandfather's apparent anxiety about the intelligence communicated by Lady Desmond, and they accomplished the circuit of the walls, silently, or, exchanging occasional remarks very foreign from the subject occupying both their minds.  At length the Colonel said abruptly--  \"Kate, my child, what do you think of Lady Desmond's invitation?\"  \"Oh! I think it a delightful plan; but you, grandpapa, do you think we shall be able to accept it?\"  \"At present decidedly not. I must not be farther from Dublin than I am--I fear I shall have much letter writing, if indeed I am not obliged to go to Ireland myself; if matters come right again, I shall certainly endeavour to let the Priory, and take you to Italy; this complete retirement is not good or safe.\"  \"Safe!\" said Kate, laughing. \"Why I thought it was quite _selon les regles_, of all romances, that a dethroned prince, and his lovely and interesting daughter, like you and I, should be safe only while in obscurity.\"  \"According to old romances, I grant; but according to reality, there is more danger in the strong contrasts which the occasional breaks in a life of retirement present, in the tone of mind it engenders, than in the action of society, at least to you, Kate.\"  \"Danger! Oh, tempt me not to boast,\" cried Kate, endeavouring to draw her grandfather from his moralising mood. \"You may despise old romances, but you are nevertheless assuming the tone of some melancholy Count Alphonso, warning a sensitive and angelic Lady Malvina, against the world in general: dearest and best,\" she continued, in graver and tenderer tones, \"I must swim down the troubled current of life, as you have done before me, and meet its difficulties and trials--leave me then to the same guide by whose aid, you have passed many a dangerous rapid safely, to float in a smooth, though diminutive haven at last.\"  \"You are right, Kate, quite right; but how much longer the smoothness will last, God only knows.\"  \"Well, there _is_ a God, to know all, and direct all, and that consciousness, must rob the future of all apprehension. Shall I write to Lady Desmond, on our return, and tell her of our indecision and its causes?\"  \"By all means. Yet, dear child, I wish _you_ would accept her invitation, you want change, and I could remain quite comfortably with nurse and--\"  \"Do not utter such treason! Leave you! and to amuse myself in Italy, when there is a chance that so far from being able to do without me, you may peculiarly want me.\"  \"My dear, dear, unselfish child.\"  \"Not a bit unselfish--_tout au contraire_. I should be miserable away, besides--but here are our friends, Winter and Gilpin, so, dearest grandpapa, leave the future to take care of itself; all will be arranged for the best.\"  There was no time to say more, as the painter and organist approached; but though the Colonel made no reply, some unexplained current of feeling induced him to pass his arm through Kate's, instead of offering it, as was his habit, for her support.  \"Ha! Miss Vernon, I see you have taken advantage of a stray gleam of sun, to seduce the Colonel into risking another cold--the wind is truly detestable, but as I could not keep Gilpin in doors, I came out with him, he has not a grain of prudence!\"  \"My dear Winter, it is a remarkable fine day for March, I am glad, Gilpin, you felt equal to a walk.\"  \"I think you look better,\" observed Kate.  \"Yes: I think I am better, I feel to revive at the approach, however boisterous, of spring.\"  \"_Cospetto!_ three months in Italy would make you a new man; but here, the great mystery to me is, how any one who catches a cold ever loses it.\"  \"The remedy is worse than the disease; imagine a depressed invalid in a strange country, without a single friend, or, even acquaintance, and ignorant of its language,\" returned Gilpin.  \"Wretched indeed! but wait for me, Mr. Gilpin, we have some thoughts of taking a flight to Italy, this summer,\" said Miss Vernon.  \"_Corpo di Baccho!_ I'll not be left behind: to act as Miss Vernon's _cicerone_, would be something more than commonly delightful--what a state of enjoyment you would be in; but what put such a move into your head, Colonel?\"  \"An invitation from Lady Desmond, who is at Florence,\" said Colonel Vernon, \"Our acceptance of it however is very uncertain, though I see Kate is full of the project. I had another letter, Messieurs, which I think will give you pleasure--here; read it, Winter.\"  \"Bombay--Fred Egerton--_che gusto_.\"  A quick glance at Kate. The whole party moved slowly towards Abbey Gardens, the Colonel and Winter, who read the letter aloud, and Gilpin close behind with Kate.  \"_Ad ogni uccello suo nido é bello_,\" said Winter, as he concluded the epistle, \"here am I shivering and pining for a warm sun, which many years' custom has made natural to me, and there is that young scape-grace, revelling in baths; and slaves, and sunshine, dying to be back among east winds and consumption!\"  \"Captain Egerton does not"]]]
