I didn't expect that you'd come walking in my office--that's why I didn't recognize you immediately.\" He exhaled peevishly. \"Where did you go? We've been searching for you everywhere.\"  It seemed wiser to Dan not to tell him everything. \"It was stuffy inside. I went out for a stroll before the nurse came in.\"  Crander frowned, his nervousness rapidly disappearing. \"Then it was about an hour ago. We didn't think you could walk at all so soon, or we would have kept someone on duty through the night.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They had underestimated him, but he didn't mind. Of course, he didn't know how a patient from the regrowth tanks was supposed to act. The doctor took his pulse. \"Seems fine,\" he said, surprised. \"Sit down--please sit down.\"  Without waiting for him to comply, Crander pushed him into a chair and began hauling out a variety of instruments with which he poked about his bewildered patient.  Finally Crander seemed satisfied. \"Excellent,\" he said. \"If I didn't know better, I'd say you were almost fully recovered. A week ago, we considered removing you from the regrowth tank. Our decision to leave you there an extra week has paid off very, very nicely.\"  Merrol wasn't as pleased as the doctor appeared to be. \"Granted you can identify me as the person who came out of regrowth--but does that mean I'm Dan Merrol? Could there be a mistake?\"  Crander eyed him clinically. \"We don't ordinarily do this--but it is evident that with you peace of mind is more important than procedure. And you look well enough to stand the physical strain.\"  He pressed the buzzer and an angular woman in her early forties answered. \"Miss Jerrems, the Dan Merrol file.\"  Miss Jerrems flashed a glance of open adoration at the doctor and before she could reel it in, her gaze swept past Dan, hesitated and returned to him. Her mouth opened and closed like that of a nervous goldfish and she darted from the room.  _They see me and flee as fast as they can caper_, thought Merrol. It was not wholly true--Crander didn't seem much affected. But he was a doctor and used to it. Furthermore, he probably had room for only one emotion at the moment--relief at the return of his patient.  Miss Jerrems came back, wheeling a large cart. Dan was surprised at the mass of records. Crander noticed his expression and smiled. \"You're our prize case, Merrol. I've never heard of anyone else surviving such extensive surgery. Naturally, we have a step-by-step account of everything we did.\"  He turned to the woman. \"You may leave, Miss Jerrems.\" She went, but the adoration she had showed so openly for her employer seemed to have curdled in the last few moments.  Crander dug into the files and rooted out photographs. \"Here are pictures of the wreckage in which you were found--notice that you were strapped in your seat--as you were received into the hospital--at various stages in surgery and finally, some taken from the files of the company for which you worked.\"  Merrol winced. The photographic sequence was incontrovertible. He had been a handsome fellow.  \"Here is other evidence you may not have heard of. It's a recent development, within the last ten years, in fact. It still isn't accepted by most courts--they're always lagging--but to medical men it's the last word.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Merrol studied the patterns of waves and lines and splotches. \"What is it?\"  \"Mass-cell radiographs. One was loaned by your employer. The other was taken just after your last operation. Both were corrected according to standard methods. One cell won't do it, ten yield an uncertain identity--but as few as a hundred cells from any part of the original body, excepting the blood, constitute proof more positive than fingerprints before the surgical exchange of limbs. Don't ask me why--no one knows. But it is true that cells differ from one body to the next, and this test detects the difference.\"  The mass-cell radiographs did seem identical and Dr. Crander seemed certain. Taken altogether, the evidence was overwhelming. There had been no mistake--he was Dan Merrol, though it was not difficult to understand why Erica couldn't believe he was her husband.  \"You did a fine job,\" he said. Recalling the picture of the wreckage, he knew they had. \"But couldn't you have done just a little better?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Crander's eyebrows bounced up. \"We're amazed at how well we have done. You can search case histories and find nothing comparable.\" His eyebrows dropped back into place. \"Of course, if you have a specific complaint....\"  \"Nothing specific. But look at this hand....\"  The doctor seized it. \"Beautiful, isn't it?\"  \"Perhaps--taken by itself.\" Dan rolled up his sleeve. \"See how it joins the forearm.\"  Crander waggled it gravely. \"It coordinates perfectly. I've observed you have complete control over it. The doctor's eye, my boy. The doctor's diagnostic eye.\"  The other just didn't understand. \"But the size--it doesn't match my arm!\"  \"Doesn't _match_?\" cried the doctor. \"Do you have any idea of the biological ways in which it _does_ match? True, it may not be esthetically harmonized, but here we delve into the mysteries of the human organism, and we can hardly be striving for Botticelli bodies and Michelangelo men. First, your hand moves freely at the joint, a triumph of surgical skill.\" He moved the hand experimentally, to show Merrol how it was done. He dropped the hand and hurried to a screen against the wall.  Crander drew his finger across the surface and the mark remained. \"You know about Rh positive and negative blood. Mixed, they can be lethal. This was discovered long ago, by someone I've forgotten. But there are other factors just as potent and far more complex.\"  He scribbled meaningless symbols on the screen with his finger. \"Take the bone factors--three. They must be matched in even such a slight contact as a joint ... this was done. Then there are the tissue factors--four. Tendon factors--two. Nerve-splice factors--three again. After that, we move into a complex field, hormone-utilization factors--seven at the latest count and more coming up with further research.  \"That's the beginning, but at the sensory organs we leave the simple stuff behind. Take the eye, for instance.\" Merrol leaned away because Dr. Crander seemed about to pluck one of Dan's eyes from its socket. \"Surgical and growth factors involved in splicing a massive nerve bundle pass any layman's comprehension. There are no non-technical terms to describe it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was just as well--Merrol didn't want a lecture. He extended his arms. One was of normal length, the other longer. \"Do you think you can do something with this? I don't mind variation in thickness--some of that will smooth out as I exercise--but I'd like them the same length.\"  \"There were many others injured at the same time, you know--and you were one of the last to be extricated from the ship. Normally, when we have to replace a whole arm, we do so at the shoulder for obvious reasons. But the previously treated victims had depleted our supplies. Some needed only a hand and we gave them just that, others a hand and a forearm, and so on. When we got to you, we had to use leftovers or permit you to die--there wasn't time to send to other hospitals. In fact there wasn't any time at all--we actually thought you were dead, but soon found we were wrong.\"  Crander stared at a crack in the ceiling. \"Further recovery will take other operations and your nervous system isn't up to it.\" He shook his head. \"Five years from now, we can help you, not before.\"  Merrol turned away miserably. There were other things, but he had learned the essentials. He was Dan Merrol and there was nothing they could do for him until it was too late. How long could he expect Erica to wait?  The doctor hadn't finished the medical session. \"Replacement of body parts is easy, after all. The big trouble came when we went into the brain.\"  \"Brain?\" Dan was startled.  \"How hard do you think your skull is?\" Crander came closer. \"Bend your head.\"  Merrol obeyed and could feel the doctor's forefinger slice across his scalp in a mock operation. \"This sector was crushed.\" Roughly half his brain, it appeared. \"That's why so many memories were gone--not just from shock. In addition, other sectors were damaged and had to be replaced.\"  Crander traced out five areas he could feel, but not see. \"Samuel Kaufman, musician--Breed Mannly, cowboy actor--George Elkins, lepidopterist--Duke DeCaesares, wrestler--and Ben Eisenberg, mathematician, went into the places I tapped.\"  Dan raised his head. Some things were clearer. The memories were authentic, but they weren't his--nor did the other wives belong to him. It was no wonder Erica had cringed at their names.  \"These donors were dead, but you can be thankful we had parts of their brains available.\" Crander delved into the file and came up with a sheet.  \"Here are some body part contributors.\" He read rapidly. \"Dimwiddie, Barton, Colton, Morton, Flam and Carnera were responsible for arms and hands. Greenberg, Rochefault, Gonzalez, Tall-Cloud, Gowraddy and Tsin supplied feet and legs.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He was not a man, Merrol thought. Not now. If anything, he was a convention and one body was not a large enough hotel to hold it in comfort.  \"These were the major human donors, but there were others I didn't bother to read, for the kidneys and so on. And I think our four-footed friends deserve some mention.\" He looked up. \"The skin on your face is from a pig embryo.\"  That explained why it was hard to shave. \"_Oink?_\" he said. \"I mean did it have to be a pig?\"  \"You'd be surprised how hard it is to transplant human skin,\" commented Crander. \"Besides, we wanted to give you a masculine look. The finest face there is,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51296"],["title","The Sense of Wonder (#1)"],["body","any longer, and he turned to look at the viewport. What he saw now was so new that he couldn't at first accept it. Instead, he blinked and rubbed his eyes, sure that the ball of blue-white fire somehow had damaged them. But the new view persisted.  Of stars there were few, and of the blackness, almost nothing. Gone, too, was the burning globe. Something loomed there in the port, so huge that it spread out over almost the entire surface. Something big and round, all grays and greens and browns, and something for which Rikud had no name.  A few moments more, and Rikud no longer could see the sphere. A section of it had expanded outward and assumed the rectangular shape of the viewport, and its size as well. It seemed neatly sheered down the middle, so that on one side Rikud saw an expanse of brown and green, and on the other, blue.  Startled, Rikud leaped back. The sullen roar in the rear of the world had ceased abruptly. Instead an ominous silence, broken at regular intervals by a sharp booming.  Change--  \"Won't you eat, Rikud?\" Chuls called from somewhere down below.  \"Damn the man,\" Rikud thought. Then aloud: \"Yes, I'll eat. Later.\"  \"It's time....\" Chuls' voice trailed off again, impotently.  But Rikud forgot the old man completely. A new idea occurred to him, and for a while he struggled with it. What he saw--what he had always seen, except that now there was the added factor of change--perhaps did not exist _in_ the viewport.  Maybe it existed _through_ the viewport.  That was maddening. Rikud turned again to the port, where he could see nothing but an obscuring cloud of white vapor, murky, swirling, more confusing than ever.  \"Chuls,\" he called, remembering, \"come here.\"  \"I am here,\" said a voice at his elbow.  Rikud whirled on the little figure and pointed to the swirling cloud of vapor. \"What do you see?\"  Chuls looked. \"The viewport, of course.\"  \"What else?\"  \"Else? Nothing.\"  Anger welled up inside Rikud. \"All right,\" he said, \"listen. What do you hear?\"  \"Broom, brroom, brrroom!\" Chuls imitated the intermittent blasting of the engines. \"I'm hungry, Rikud.\"  The old man turned and strode off down the corridor toward the dining room, and Rikud was glad to be alone once more.         *       *       *       *       *  Now the vapor had departed, except for a few tenuous whisps. For a moment Rikud thought he could see the gardens rearward in the world. But that was silly. What were the gardens doing in the viewport? And besides, Rikud had the distinct feeling that here was something far vaster than the gardens, although all of it existed in the viewport which was no wider than the length of his body. The gardens, moreover, did not jump and dance before his eyes the way the viewport gardens did. Nor did they spin. Nor did the trees grow larger with every jolt.  Rikud sat down hard. He blinked.  The world had come to rest on the garden of the viewport.         *       *       *       *       *  For a whole week that view did not change, and Rikud had come to accept it as fact. There--through the viewport and in it--was a garden. A garden larger than the entire world, a garden of plants which Rikud had never seen before, although he had always liked to stroll through the world's garden and he had come to know every plant well. Nevertheless, it was a garden.  He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, \"It is the viewport.\"  Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. \"It looks like the garden,\" he admitted to Rikud. \"But why should the garden be in the viewport?\"  Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign. But he could not tell them of his most amazing thought of all. The change in the viewport could mean only one thing. The world had been walking--the word seemed all wrong to Rikud, but he could think of no other, unless it were running. The world had been walking somewhere. That somewhere was the garden and the world had arrived.  \"It is an old picture of the garden,\" Chuls suggested, \"and the plants are different.\"  \"Then they've changed?\"  \"No, merely different.\"  \"Well, what about the viewport? _It_ changed. Where are the stars? Where are they, Chuls, if it did not change?\"  \"The stars come out at night.\"  \"So there is a change from day to night!\"  \"I didn't say that. The stars simply shine at night. Why should they shine during the day when the world wants them to shine only at night?\"  \"Once they shone all the time.\"  \"Naturally,\" said Crifer, becoming interested. \"They are variable.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Rikud regretted that he never had had the chance to read that book on astronomy. He hadn't been reading too much lately. The voice of the reading machine had begun to bore him. He said, \"Well, variable or not, our whole perspective has changed.\"  And when Chuls looked away in disinterest, Rikud became angry. If only the man would realize! If only anyone would realize! It all seemed so obvious. If he, Rikud, walked from one part of the world to another, it was with a purpose--to eat, or to sleep, or perhaps to bathe in the health-rays. Now if the world had walked from--somewhere, through the vast star-speckled darkness and to the great garden outside, this also was purposeful. The world had arrived at the garden for a reason. But if everyone lived as if the world still stood in blackness, how could they find the nature of that purpose?  \"I will eat,\" Chuls said, breaking Rikud's revery.  Damn the man, all he did was eat!  Yet he did have initiative after a sort. He knew when to eat. Because he was hungry.  And Rikud, too, was hungry.  Differently.         *       *       *       *       *  He had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, and now, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, reading machine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached the door.  \"What's in here?\" he demanded.  \"It's a door, I think,\" said Crifer.  \"I know, but what's beyond it?\"  \"Beyond it? Oh, you mean _through_ the door.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well,\" Crifer scratched his head, \"I don't think anyone ever opened it. It's only a door.\"  \"I will,\" said Rikud.  \"You will what?\"  \"Open it. Open the door and look inside.\"  A long pause. Then, \"Can you do it?\"  \"I think so.\"  \"You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before? There's nothing. It just isn't. It's only a door, Rikud.\"  \"No--\" Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake of breath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently, and Crifer said, \"Doors are variable, too, I think.\"  Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the other end of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across, Rikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine.  He missed the beginning, but then:      --therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this     door. The machinery in the next room is your protection against the     rigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey's end, you may     have discarded it for something better--who knows? But if you have     not, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship     is a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it is     human-sustaining as well. Try to hurt yourself and the ship will     not permit it--within limits, of course. But you can damage the     ship, and to avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons     are to be permitted through this door--  Rikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusing words. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interesting than that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to another voice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn't.  When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentle humming, punctuated by a _throb-throb-throb_ which sounded not unlike the booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn't blast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud's eyes--he blinked and looked again, but it was still there--cogs and gears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful because they shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.  \"Odd,\" Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, \"Now there's a good word, but no one quite seems to know its meaning.\"  Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there might exist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one opened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.  Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The viewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and, although it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography was different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had thought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way off in the distance.  And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his hand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new viewport. He began to turn the handle.  Then he trembled.  What would he do out in the garden?  He couldn't go alone. He'd die of the strangeness. It was a silly thought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikud couldn't fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth felt dry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn't.  Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way back through the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finally through the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer.  By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He did not dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer's side, and sweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at the garden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he could walk and then might find himself in the garden.  It was so big.         *       *       *       *       *  Three or four days passed before Rikud calmed himself enough to talk about his"]]]
