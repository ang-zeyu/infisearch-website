The next thing to be done, is to make one of the principal axes of the central ellipsoid coincide with the axle of the top.  To effect this, we must begin by spinning the top gently about its axle, steadying the upper part with the finger at first. If the axle is already a principal axis the top will continue to revolve about its axle when the finger is removed. If it is not, we observe that the top begins to spin about some other axis, and the axle moves away from the centre of motion and then back to it again, and so on, alternately widening its circles and contracting them.  It is impossible to observe this motion successfully, without the aid of the coloured disc placed near the upper end of the axis. This disc is divided into sectors, and strongly coloured, so that each sector may be recognised by its colour when in rapid motion. If the axis about which the top is really revolving, falls within this disc, its position may be ascertained by the colour of the spot at the centre of motion. If the central spot appears red, we know that the invariable axis at that instant passes through the red part of the disc.  In this way we can trace the motion of the invariable axis in the revolving body, and we find that the path which it describes upon the disc may be a circle, an ellipse, an hyperbola, or a straight line, according to the arrangement of the instrument.  In the case in which the invariable axis coincides at first with the axle of the top, and returns to it after separating from it for a time, its true path is a circle or an ellipse having the axle in its _circumference_. The true principal axis is at the centre of the closed curve. It must be made to coincide with the axle by adjusting the vertical screws $l$, $m$, $n$.  Suppose that the colour of the centre of motion, when farthest from the axle, indicated that the axis of rotation passed through the sector $L$, then the principal axis must also lie in that sector at half the distance from the axle.  If this principal axis be that of _greatest_ moment of inertia, we must _raise_ the screw $l$ in order to bring it nearer the axle $A$. If it be the axis of least moment we must _lower_ the screw $l$. In this way we may make the principal axis coincide with the axle. Let us suppose that the principal axis is that of greatest moment of inertia, and that we have made it coincide with the axle of the instrument. Let us also suppose that the moments of inertia about the other axes are equal, and very little less than that about the axle. Let the top be spun about the axle and then receive a disturbance which causes it to spin about some other axis. The instantaneous axis will not remain at rest either in space or in the body. In space it will describe a right cone, completing a revolution in somewhat less than the time of revolution of the top. In the body it will describe another cone of larger angle in a period which is longer as the difference of axes of the body is smaller. The invariable axis will be fixed in space, and describe a cone in the body.  The relation of the different motions may be understood from the following illustration. Take a hoop and make it revolve about a stick which remains at rest and touches the inside of the hoop. The section of the stick represents the path of the instantaneous axis in space, the hoop that of the same axis in the body, and the axis of the stick the invariable axis. The point of contact represents the pole of the instantaneous axis itself, travelling many times round the stick before it gets once round the hoop. It is easy to see that the direction in which the hoop moves round the stick, so that if the top be spinning in the direction $L$, $M$, $N$, the colours will appear in the same order.  By screwing the bob B up the axle, the difference of the axes of inertia may be diminished, and the time of a complete revolution of the invariable axis in the body increased. By observing the number of revolutions of the top in a complete cycle of colours of the invariable axis, we may determine the ratio of the moments of inertia.  By screwing the bob up farther, we may make the axle the principal axis of _least_ moment of inertia.  The motion of the instantaneous axis will then be that of the point of contact of the stick with the _outside_ of the hoop rolling on it. The order of colours will be $N$, $M$, $L$, if the top be spinning in the direction $L$, $M$, $N$, and the more the bob is screwed up, the more rapidly will the colours change, till it ceases to be possible to make the observations correctly.  In calculating the dimensions of the parts of the instrument, it is necessary to provide for the exhibition of the instrument with its axle either the greatest or the least axis of inertia. The dimensions and weights of the parts of the top which I have found most suitable, are given in a note at the end of this paper.  Now let us make the axes of inertia in the plane of the ring unequal. We may do this by screwing the balance screws $x$ and $x^1$ farther from the axle without altering the centre of gravity.  Let us suppose the bob $B$ screwed up so as to make the axle the axis of least inertia. Then the mean axis is parallel to $xx^1$, and the greatest is at right angles to $xx^1$ in the horizontal plane. The path of the invariable axis on the disc is no longer a circle but an ellipse, concentric with the disc, and having its major axis parallel to the mean axis $xx^1$.  The smaller the difference between the moment of inertia about the axle and about the mean axis, the more eccentric the ellipse will be; and if, by screwing the bob down, the axle be made the mean axis, the path of the invariable axis will be no longer a closed curve, but an hyperbola, so that it will depart altogether from the neighbourhood of the axle. When the top is in this condition it must be spun gently, for it is very difficult to manage it when its motion gets more and more eccentric.  When the bob is screwed still farther down, the axle becomes the axis of greatest inertia, and $xx^1$ the least. The major axis of the ellipse described by the invariable axis will now be perpendicular to $xx^1$, and the farther the bob is screwed down, the eccentricity of the ellipse will diminish, and the velocity with which it is described will increase.  I have now described all the phenomena presented by a body revolving freely on its centre of gravity. If we wish to trace the motion of the invariable axis by means of the coloured sectors, we must make its motion very slow compared with that of the top. It is necessary, therefore, to make the moments of inertia about the principal axes very nearly equal, and in this case a very small change in the position of any part of the top will greatly derange the _position_ of the principal axis. So that when the top is well adjusted, a single turn of one of the screws of the ring is sufficient to make the axle no longer a principal axis, and to set the true axis at a considerable inclination to the axle of the top.  All the adjustments must therefore be most carefully arranged, or we may have the whole apparatus deranged by some eccentricity of spinning. The method of making the principal axis coincide with the axle must be studied and practised, or the first attempt at spinning rapidly may end in the destruction of the top, if not the table on which it is spun.  On the Earth’s Motion   We must remember that these motions of a body about its centre of gravity, are _not_ illustrations of the theory of the precession of the Equinoxes. Precession can be illustrated by the apparatus, but we must arrange it so that the force of gravity acts the part of the attraction of the sun and moon in producing a force tending to alter the axis of rotation. This is easily done by bringing the centre of gravity of the whole a little below the point on which it spins. The theory of such motions is far more easily comprehended than that which we have been investigating.  But the earth is a body whose principal axes are unequal, and from the phenomena of precession we can determine the ratio of the polar and equatorial axes of the “central ellipsoid;” and supposing the earth to have been set in motion about any axis except the principal axis, or to have had its original axis disturbed in any way, its subsequent motion would be that of the top when the bob is a little below the critical position.  The axis of angular momentum would have an invariable position in space, and would travel with respect to the earth round the axis of figure with a velocity $\\displaystyle = \\omega\\frac{C - A}{A}$ where $\\omega$ is the sidereal angular velocity of the earth. The apparent pole of the earth would travel (with respect to the earth) from west to east round the true pole, completing its circuit in $\\displaystyle \\frac{A}{C - A}$ sidereal days, which appears to be about 325.6 solar days.  The instantaneous axis would revolve about this axis in space in about a day, and would always be in a plane with the true axis of the earth and the axis of angular momentum. The effect of such a motion on the apparent position of a star would be, that its zenith distance should be increased and diminished during a period of 325.6 days. This alteration of zenith distance is the same above and below the pole, so that the polar distance of the star is unaltered. In fact the method of finding the pole of the heavens by observations of stars, gives the pole of the _invariable axis_, which is altered only by external forces, such as those of the sun and moon.  There is therefore no change in the apparent polar distance of stars due to this cause. It is the latitude which varies. The magnitude of this variation cannot be determined by theory. The periodic time of the variation may be found approximately from the known"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5194"],["title","The Ivory Trail (#1)"],["body","s!\"  Monty declined to take fire.  It was I, latest to join the partnership and much the least affluent, who bit.  \"If you love the Lord, explain!\" said I.  \"This old one-eyed lazaretto attendant is an ex-slave, ex-accomplice of Tippoo Tib!\"  \"And Tippoo Tib?\" I asked.  \"Ignorant fo'castle outcast!\"  (All that because I had made one voyage as foremast hand, and deserted rather than submit to more of it.) \"Tippoo Tib is the Arab--is, mind you, my son, not was--the Arab who was made governor of half the Congo by H. M. Stanley and the rest of 'em.  Tippoo Tib is the expert who used to bring the slave caravans to Zanzibar--bring 'em, send 'em, send for 'em--he owned 'em anyway. Tippoo Tib was the biggest ivory hunter and trader lived since old King Solomon!  Tippoo Tib is here--in Zanzibar--to all intents and purposes a prisoner on parole--old as the hills--getting ready to die--and proud as the very ace of hell.  So says One-eye!\"  \"So we're all rich?\" suggested Monty.  \"Of course we are!  Listen!  The British government took Tippoo's slaves away and busted his business.  Made him come and live in this place, go to church on Sundays, and be good.  Then they asked him what he'd done with his ivory.  Asked him politely after putting him through that mill!  One-eye here says Tippoo had a million tusks--a million!--safely buried!  Government offered him ten per cent. of their cash value if he'd tell 'em where, and the old sport spat in their faces!  Swears he'll die with the secret!  One-eye vows Tippoo is the only one who knows.  There were others, but Tippoo shot or poisoned 'em.\"  \"So we're rich,\" smiled Yerkes.  \"Of course we are!  Consider this, America, and tell me if Standard Oil can beat it!  One million tusks!  I'm told--\"  \"By whom?\"  \"One-eye says--\"  \"You'll say 'Oh!' at me to a different tune, before I've done!  One-eye says it never paid to carry a tusk weighing less than sixty pounds. Some tusks weigh two hundred--some even more--took four men to carry some of 'em!  Call it an average weight of one hundred pounds and be on the safe side.\"  \"Yes, let's play safe,\" agreed Monty seriously.  \"One hundred million pounds of ivory!\" said Fred, with a smack of his lips and the air of a man who could see the whole of it.  \"The present market price of new ivory is over ten shillings a pound on the spot. That'll all be very old stuff, worth at least double.  But let's say ten shillings a pound and be on the safe side.\"  \"Yes, let's!\" laughed Yerkes.  \"One thousand million--a billion shillings!\" Fred announced.  \"Fifty million pounds!\"  \"Two hundred and fifty million dollars!\" Yerkes calculated, beginning to take serious notice.  \"But how are we to find it?\" I objected.  \"That's the point.  Government 'ud hog the lot, but has hunted high and low and can't find it.  So the offer stands ten per cent. to any one who does--ten per cent. of fifty million--lowest reckoning, mind you!--five million pounds!  Half for Monty--two and a half million.  A million for Yerkes, a million for me, and a half a million for you all according to contract!  How d'you like it?\"  \"Well enough,\" I answered. \"If its only the hundredth part true, I'm enthusiastic!\"  \"So now suit yourselves!\" said Fred, collapsing with a sweep of his skirts into the nearest chair.  \"I've told you what One-eye says. These dusky gents sometimes exaggerate of course--\"  \"Now and then,\" admitted Monty.  \"But where there's smoke you mean there's prob'ly some one smoking hams?\" suggested Yerkes.  \"I mean, let's find that ivory!\" said Fred.  \"We might do worse than make an inquiry or two,\" Monty assented cautiously.  \"Didums, you damned fool, you're growing old!  You're wasting time! You're trying to damp enthusiasm!  You're--you're--\"  \"Interested, Fred.  I'm interested.  Let's--\"  \"Let's find that ivory and to hell with caution!  Why, man alive, it's the chance of a million lifetimes!\"  \"Well, then,\" said Monty, \"admitting the story's true for the sake of argument, how do you propose to get on the track of the secret?\"  \"Get on it?  I am on it!  Didn't One-eye say Tippoo Tib is alive and in Zanzibar?  The old rascal!  Many a slave he's done to death!  Many a man he's tortured!  I propose we catch Tippoo Tib, hide him, and pull out his toe-nails one by one until be blows the gaff!\"  (To hear Fred talk when there is nothing to do but talk a stranger might arrive at many false conclusions.)  \"If there's any truth in the story at all,\" said Monty, \"government will have done everything within the bounds of decency to coax the facts from Tippoo Tib.  I suspect we'd have to take our chance and simply hunt.  But let's hear Juma's story.\"  So the old attendant left off sprinkling water from a yellow jar, and came and stood before us.  Fred's proposal of tweaking toe-nails would not have been practical in his case, for he had none left.  His black legs, visible because he had tucked his one long garment up about his waist, were a mass of scars.  He was lean, angular, yet peculiarly straight considering his years.  As he stood before us he let his shirt-like garment drop, and the change from scarecrow to deferential servant was instantaneous.  He was so wrinkled, and the wrinkles were so deep, that one scarcely noticed his sightless eye, almost hidden among a nest of creases; and in spite of the wrinkles, his polished, shaven head made him look ridiculously youthful because one expected gray hair and there was none.  \"Ask him how he lost his toe-nails, Fred,\" said I.  But the old man knew enough English to answer for himself.  He made a wry grimace and showed his hands.  The finger-nails were gone too.  \"Tell us your story, Juma,\" said Monty.  \"Tell 'em about the pembe--the ivory--the much ivory--the meengi pembe,\" echoed Fred.  \"Let's hear about those nails of his first,\" said I.  \"One thing'll prob'ly lead to another,\" Yerkes agreed. \"Start him on the toe-nail story.\"  But it did not lead very far.  Fred, who had picked up Kiswahili enough to piece out the old man's broken English, drew him out and clarified the tale.  But it only went to prove that others besides ourselves had heard of Tippoo Tib's hoard.  Some white man--we could not make head or tail of the name, but it sounded rather like Somebody belonging to a man named Carpets--had trapped him a few years before and put him to torture in the belief that he knew the secret.  \"But me not knowing nothing!\" he assured us solemnly, shaking his head again and again.  But he was not in the least squeamish about telling us that Tippoo Tib had surely buried huge quantities of ivory, and had caused to be slain afterward every one who shared the secret.  \"How long ago?\" asked Monty.  But natives of that part of the earth are poor hands at reckoning time.  \"Long time,\" he assured us.  He might have meant six years, or sixty. It would have been all the same to him.  \"No.  Me not liking Tippoo Tib.  One time his slave.  That bad.  Byumby set free.  That good.  Now working here.  This very good.\"  \"Where do you think the ivory is?\" (This from Yerkes.)  But the old man shook his head.  \"As I understand it,\" said Monty, \"slaves came mostly from the Congo side of Lake Victoria Nyanza.  Slave and elephant country were approximately the same as regards general direction, and there were two routes from the Congo--the southern by way of Ujiji on Tanganyika to Bagamoyo on what is now the German coast, and the other to the north of Victoria Nyanza ending at Mombasa. Ask him, Fred, which way the ivory used to come.\"  \"Both ways,\" announced Juma without waiting for Fred to interpret.  He had an uncanny trick of following conversation, his intelligence seeming to work by fits and starts.  \"That gives us about half Africa for hunting-ground, and a job for life!\" laughed Yerkes.  \"Might have a worse!\" Fred answered, resentful of cold water thrown on his discovery.  \"Were you Tippoo Tib's slave when he buried the ivory?\" demanded Monty, and the old man nodded.  \"Where were you at the time?\"  Juma made a gesture intended to suggest immeasurable distances toward the West, and the name of the place he mentioned was one we had never heard of.  \"Can you take us to Tippoo Tib when we leave this place?\" I asked, and he nodded again.  \"How much ivory do you suppose there was?\" asked Yerkes.  \"Teli, teli!\" he answered, shaking his head.  \"Too much!\" Fred translated.  \"Pretty fair to middling vague,\" said Yerkes, \"but\"--judicially--\"almost worth investigating!\"  \"Investigating?\" Fred sprang from his chair.  \"It's better than all King Solomon's mines, El Dorado, Golconda, and Sindbad the Sailor's treasure lands--rolled in one!  It's an obviously good thing!  All we need is a bit of luck and the ivory's ours!\"  \"I'll sell you my share now for a thousand dollars--come--come across!\" grinned Yerkes.  There was a rough-house after that.  He and Fred nearly pulled the old attendant in two, each claiming the right to torture him first and learn the secret.  They ended up without a whole rag between them, and had to send Juma to head-quarters for new blue dressing-gowns.  The doctor came himself--a fat good-natured party with an eye-glass and a cocktail appetite, acting locum-tenens for the real official who was home on leave.  He brought the ingredients for cocktails with him.  \"Yes,\" he said, shaking the mixer with a sort of deft solicitude. \"There's more than something in the tale.  I've had a try myself to get details.  Tippoo Tib believes in up-to-date physic, and when the old rascal's sick he sends for me.  I offered to mix him an elixir of life that would make him out-live Methuselah if he'd give me as much as a hint of the general direction of his cache.\"  \"He ought to have fallen for that,\" said Yerkes, but the doctor shook his head.  \"He's an Arab.  They're Shiah Muhammedans.  Their Paradise is a pleasant place from all accounts.  He advised me to drink my own elixir, and have lots and lots of years in which to find the ivory, without being beholden"]]]
