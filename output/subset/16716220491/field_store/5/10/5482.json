We doubtless exposed ourselves to great peril, but we did so gladly, and left Alexandria with a few camels, an ox-cart, and some trusted slaves. We were to go to Gaza, where Cleopatra was already beginning to collect an army, and had disguised ourselves as Nabataean merchants.  The languages which I had learned, in order not to be distanced by Cleopatra, were now of great service.  \"Those were stirring times.  The names of Caesar and Pompey were in every mouth.  After the defeat at Dyrrachium the cause of Julius seemed lost, but the Pharsalian battle again placed him uppermost, unless the East rose in behalf of Pompey.  Both seemed to be favourites of Fortune.  The question now was to which the goddess would prove most faithful.  \"My sister Charmian was with the Queen, but through one of Arsinoe's maids, who was devoted to her, we had learned from the palace that Pompey's fate was decided.  He had come a fugitive from the defeat of Pharsalus, and begged the King of Egypt--that is, the men who were acting in his name--for a hospitable reception.  Pothinus and his associates had rarely confronted a greater embarrassment.  The troops and ships of the victorious Caesar were close at hand; many of Gabinius' men were serving in the Egyptian army.  To receive the vanquished Pompey kindly was to make the victorious Caesar a foe.  I was to witness the terrible solution of this dilemma.  The infamous words of Theodotus, 'Dead dogs no longer bite,' had turned the scale.  \"My brother and I reached Mount Casius with our precious freight, and pitched our tents to await a messenger, when a large body of armed men approached from the city.  At first we feared that we were pursued; but a spy reported that the King himself was among the soldiery, and at the same time a large Roman galley drew near the coast.  It must be Pompey's. So they had changed their views, and the King was coming in person to receive their guest.  The troops encamped on the flat shore on which stood the Temple of the Casian Amon.  \"The September sun shone brightly, and was reflected from the weapons. From the high bank of the dry bed of the river, where we had pitched our tent, we saw something scarlet move to and fro.  It was the King's mantle.  The waves, stirred by the autumn breeze, rippled lightly, blue as cornflowers, over the yellow sand of the dunes; but the King stood still, shading his eyes with his hand as he gazed at the galley. Meanwhile, Achillas, the commander of the troops, and Septimius, the tribune, who belonged to the Roman garrison in Alexandria, and who, I knew, had served under Pompey and owed him many favours, had entered a boat and put off to the vessel, which could not come nearer the land on account of the shallow water.  \"The conference now began, and Achillas's offer of hospitality must have been very warm and well calculated to inspire confidence, for a tall lady--it was Cornelia, the wife of the Imperator--waved her hand to him in token of gratitude.\"  Here the speaker paused, drew a long breath, and, pressing his hand to his brow, continued \"What follows--alas, that it was my fate to witness the dreadful scene!  How often a garbled account has been given, and yet the whole was so terribly simple!  \"Fortune  makes  her  favourites  confiding.  Pompey was also.  Though more than fifty years old--he lacked two years of sixty--he sprang into the boat quickly enough, with merely a little assistance from a freedman. A sailor--he was a negro--shoved the skiff off from the side of the huge ship as violently as if the pole he used for the purpose was a spear, and the galley his foe.  The boat, urged by his companions' oars, had already moved forward, and he stumbled, the brown cap falling from his woolly head in the act.  \"It seems as if I could still see him.  Ere I clearly realized that this was an evil omen, the boat stopped.  \"The water was shallow.  I saw Achillas point to the shore.  It could be reached by a single bound.  Pompey looked towards the King.  The freedman put his hand under his arm to help him rise.  Septimius also stood up.  I thought he intended to assist him.  But no!  What did this mean? Something flashed  by the  Imperator's silver-grey hair as if a spark had fallen from the sky.  Would Pompey defend himself, or why did he raise his hand?  It was to draw around him the toga, with which he silently covered his face.  The tribune's arm was again raised high into the air, and then--what confusion!  Here, there, yonder, hands suddenly appeared aloft, bright flashes darted through the clear air.  Achillas, the general, dealt blows with his dagger as if he were skilled in murder. The Imperator's stalwart figure sank forward.  The freedman supported him.  \"Then shouts arose, here a cry of fury, yonder a wail of grief, and, rising above all, a woman's shriek of anguish.  It came from the lips of Cornelia, the murdered man's wife.  Shouts of applause from the King's camp followed, then the blast of a trumpet; the Egyptians drew back from the shore.  The scarlet cloak again appeared.  Septimius, bearing in his hand a bleeding head, went towards it and held the ghastly trophy aloft.  \"The royal boy gazed into the dull eyes of the victim, who had guided the destinies of many a battlefield, of Rome, of two quarters of the globe. The sight was probably too terrible for the child upon the throne, for he averted his head.  The ship moved away from the land, the Egyptians formed into ranks and marched off.  Achillas cleansed his blood-stained hands in the sea-water.  The freedman beside him washed his master's headless trunk.  The general shrugged his shoulders as the faithful fellow heaped reproaches on him.\"  Here Archibius paused, drawing a long breath.  Then he continued more calmly:  \"Achillas did not lead the troops back to Alexandria, but eastward, towards Pelusium, as I learned later.  \"My brother and I stood on the rocky edge of the ravine.  It was long ere either spoke.  A cloud of dust concealed the King and his body-guard, the sails of the galley disappeared.  Twilight closed in, and Straton pointed westward towards Alexandria.  Then the sun set.  Red! red!  It seemed as if a torrent of blood was pouring over the city.  \"Night followed.  A scanty fire was glimmering on the strand.  Where had the wood been gathered in this desert?  How had it been kindled?  A wrecked, mouldering boat had lain close beside the scene of the murder. The freedman and his companions had broken it up and fed the flames with withered boughs, the torn garments of the murdered man, and dry sea-weed. A blaze soon rose, and a body was carefully placed upon the wretched funeral pyre.  It was the corpse of the great Pompey.  One of the Imperator's veterans aided the faithful servant.\"  Here Archibius sank back again among the cushions, adding in explanation:  \"Cordus, the man's name was Servius Cordus.  He fared well later.  The Queen provided for him.  The others?  Fate overtook them all soon enough. Theodotus was condemned by Brutus to a torturing death.  Amid his loud shrieks of agony one of Pompey's veterans shouted, 'Dead dogs no longer bite, but they howl when dying!'  \"It was worthy of Caesar that he averted his face in horror from the head of his enemy, which Theodotus sent to him.  Pothinus, too, vainly awaited the reward of his infamous deed.  \"Julius Caesar had cast anchor before Alexandria shortly after the King's return.  Not until after his arrival in Egypt did he learn how Pompey had been received there.  You know that he remained nine months.  How often I have heard it said that Cleopatra understood how to chain him here!  This is both true and false.  He was obliged to stay half a year; the following three months he did indeed give to the woman whom he loved. Ay, the heart of the man of fifty-four had again opened to a great passion.  Like all wounds, those inflicted by the arrows of Eros heal more slowly when youth lies behind the stricken one.  It was not only the eyes and the senses which attracted a couple so widely separated by years, but far more the mental characteristics of both.  Two winged intellects had met.  The genius of one had recognized that of the other. The highest type of manhood had met perfect womanhood.  They could not fail to attract each other.  I expected it; for Cleopatra had long watched breathlessly the flight of this eagle who soared so far above the others, and she was strong enough to keep at his side.  \"We succeeded in joining Cleopatra, and heard that, spite of the hostility of our citizens, Caesar had occupied the palace of the Ptolemies and was engaged in restoring order.  \"We knew in what way Pothinus, Achillas, and Arsinoe would seek to influence him.  Cleopatra had good reason to fear that her foes might deliver Egypt unconditionally to Rome, if Caesar should leave the reins of government in their hands and shut her out.  She had cause to dread this, but she also had the courage to act in person in her own behalf.  \"The point now was to bring her into the city, the palace-nay, into direct communication with the dictator.  Children tell the tale of the strong man who bore Cleopatra in a sack through the palace portals.  It was not a sack which concealed her, but a Syrian carpet.  The strong man was my brother Straton.  I went first, to secure a free passage.  \"Julius Caesar and she saw and found each other.  Fate merely drew the conclusion which must result from such premises.  Never have I seen Cleopatra happier, more exalted in mind and heart, yet she was menaced on all sides by serious perils.  It required all the military genius of Caesar to conquer the fierce hostility which he encountered here.  It was this, not the thrall of Cleopatra, I repeat, which first bound him to Egypt.  What would have prevented him--as he did later--from taking the object of his love to Rome, had it been possible at that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5475"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 03 (#2)"],["body","e?  But this was not the case.  The Alexandrians provided for that.  \"He had recognized the flute-player's will, nay, had granted more to the royal house than could have been given to the former.  Cleopatra and her brother-husband, Dionysus, were to share the government, and he also bestowed on Arsinoe and her youngest brother the island of Cyprus, which had been wrested from their uncle Ptolemy by the republic.  Rome was, of course, to remain the guardian of the brothers and sisters.  \"This arrangement was unendurable to Pothinus and the former rulers of the state.  Cleopatra as Queen, and Rome--that is Caesar, the dictator, her friend, as guardian--meant their removal from power, their destruction, and they resisted violently.  \"The Egyptians and even the Alexandrians supported them.  The young King hated nothing more than the yoke of the unloved sister, who was so greatly his superior.  Caesar had come with a force by no means equal to theirs, and it might be possible to draw the mighty general into a snare. They fought with all the power at their command, with such passionate eagerness, that the dictator had never been nearer succumbing to peril. But Cleopatra certainly did not paralyze his strength and cautious deliberation.  No!  He had never been greater; never proved the power of his genius so magnificently.  And against what superior power, what hatred he contended!  I myself saw the young King, when he heard that Cleopatra had succeeded in entering the palace and meeting Caesar, rush into the street, fairly crazed by rage, tear the diadem from his head, hurl it on the pavement, and shriek to the passers-by that he was betrayed, until Caesar's soldiers forced him back into the palace, and dispersed the mob.  \"Arsinoe had received more than she could venture to expect; but she was again most deeply angered.  After Caesar's entry into the palace, she had received him as Queen, and hoped everything from his favour.  Then her hated sister had come and, as so often happened, she was forgotten for Cleopatra's sake.  \"This  was  too much,  and with  the  eunuch Ganymedes, her confidant, and--as I have already said--an able warrior, she left the palace and joined the dictator's foes.  \"There were severe battles on land and sea; in the streets of the city, for the drinkable water excavated by the foe; and against the conflagration which destroyed part of the Bruchium and the library of the museum.  Yet, half dead with thirst, barely escaped from drowning, threatened on all sides by fierce hatred, he stood firm, and remained victor also in the open field, after the young King had placed himself at the head of the Egyptians and collected an army.  \"You know that the boy was drowned in the flight.  \"In battle and mortal peril, amid blood and the clank of arms, Caesar and Cleopatra spent half a year ere they were permitted to pluck the fruit of their common labour.  The dictator now made her Queen of Egypt, and gave her, as co-regent, her youngest brother, a boy not half her own age.  To Arsinoe he granted the life she had forfeited, but sent her to Italy.  \"Peace followed the victory.  Now, it is true, grave duties must have summoned the statesman back to Rome, but he tarried three full months longer.  \"Whoever knows the life of the ambitious Julius, and is aware what this delay might have cost him, may well strike his brow with his hand, and ask, 'Is it true and possible that he used this precious time to take a trip with the woman he loved up the Nile, to the island of Isis, which is so dear to the Queen, to the extreme southern frontier of the country?' Yet it was so, and I myself went in the second ship, and not only saw them together, but more than once shared their banquets and their conversation.  It was giving and taking, forcing down and elevating, a succession of discords, not unpleasant to hear, because experience taught that they would finally terminate in the most beautiful harmony.  It was a festal day for all the senses.\"  \"I imagine the whole Nile journey,\" interrupted Barine, \"to be like the fairy voyage, when the purple silk sails of Cleopatra's galley bore Antony along the Cydnus.\"  \"No, no,\" replied Archibius, \"she first learned from Antony the art of filling this earthly existence with fleeting pleasures.  Caesar demanded more.  Her intellect offered him the highest enjoyment.\"  Here he hesitated.  \"True, the skill with which, to please Antony, she daily offered him for years fresh charms for every sense, was not a matter of accident.\"  \"And this,\" cried Barine, \"this was undertaken by the woman who had recognized the chief good in peace of mind!\"  \"Ay,\" replied Archibius thoughtfully, \"yet this was the inevitable result.  Pleasure had been the young girl's object in life.  Ere passion awoke in her soul, peace of mind was the chief good she knew.  When the hour arrived that this proved unattainable, the firmly rooted yearning for happiness still remained the purpose of her existence.  My father would have been wiser to take her to the Stoa and impress it upon her that, if life must have a goal, it should be only to live in accordance with the sensibly arranged course of the world, and in harmony with one's own nature.  He should have taught her to derive happiness from virtue. He should have stamped goodness upon the soul of the future Queen as the fundamental law of her being.  He omitted to do this, because in his secluded life he had succeeded in finding the happiness which the master promises to his disciples.  From Athens to Cyrene, from Epicurus to Aristippus, is but a short step, and Cleopatra took it when she forgot that the master was far from recognizing the chief good in the enjoyment of individual pleasure.  The happiness of Epicurus was not inferior to that of Zeus, if he had only barley bread and water to appease his hunger and thirst.  \"Yet she still considered herself a follower of Epicurus, and later, when Antony had gone to the Parthian war, and she was a long time alone, she once more began to strive for freedom from pain and peace of mind, but the state, her children, the marriage of Antony--who had long been her lover--to Octavia, the yearning of her own heart, Anubis, magic, and the Egyptian teachings of the life after death, above all, the burning ambition, the unresting desire to be loved, where she herself loved, to be first among the foremost--\"  Here he was interrupted by the messenger, who informed him that the ship was ready.     CHAPTER VII.  Archibius had buried himself so deeply in the past that it was several minutes ere he could bring himself back to the present.  When he did so, he hastily discussed with the two ladies the date of their departure.  It was hard for Berenike to leave her injured brother, and Barine longed to see Dion once more before the journey.  Both were reluctant to quit Alexandria ere decisive news had arrived from the army and the fleet.  So they requested a few days' delay; but Archibius cut them short, requiring them, with a resolution which transformed the amiable friend into a stern master, to be ready for the journey the next day at sunset.  His Nile boat would await them at the Agathodaemon harbour on Lake Mareotis, and his travelling chariot would convey them thither, with as much luggage and as many female slaves as they desired to take with them.  Then softening his tone, he briefly reminded the ladies of the great annoyances to which a longer stay would expose them, excused his rigour on the plea of haste, pressed the hands of the mother and daughter, and retired without heeding Barine, who called after him, yet could desire nothing save to plead for a longer delay.  The carriage bore him swiftly to the great harbour.  The waxing moon was mirrored like a silver column, now wavering and tremulous, now rent by the waves tossing under a strong southeast wind, and illumined the warm autumn night.  The sea outside was evidently running high.  This was apparent by the motion of the vessels lying at anchor in the angle which the shore in front of the superb Temple of Poseidon formed with the Choma.  This was a tongue of land stretched like a finger into the sea, on whose point stood a little palace which Cleopatra, incited by a chance remark of Antony, had had built there to surprise him.  Another, of white marble, glimmered in the moonlight from the island of Antirrhodus; and farther still a blazing fire illumined the darkness. Its flames flared from the top of the famous lighthouse on the island of Pharos at the entrance of the harbour, and, swayed to and fro by the wind, steeped the horizon and the outer edge of the dark water in the harbour with moving masses of light which irradiated the gloomy distance, sometimes faintly, anon more brilliantly.  Spite of the late hour, the harbour was full of bustle, though the wind often blew the men's cloaks over their heads, and the women were obliged to gather their garments closely around them.  True, at this hour commerce had ceased; but many had gone to the port in search of news, or even to greet before others the first ship returning from the victorious fleet; for that Antony had defeated Octavianus in a great battle was deemed certain.  Guards were watching the harbour, and a band of Syrian horsemen had just passed from the barracks in the southern part of the Lochias to the Temple of Poseidon.  Here the galleys lay at anchor, not in the harbour of Eunostus, which was separated from the other by the broad, bridge-like dam of the Heptastadium, that united the city and the island of Pharos.  Near it were the royal palaces and the arsenal, and any tidings must first reach this spot.  The other harbour was devoted to commerce, but, in order to prevent the spread of false reports, newly arrived ships were forbidden to enter.  True, even at the great harbour, news could scarcely be expected, for a chain stretching from the end of the Pharos to a cliff directly opposite in the Alveus"]]]
