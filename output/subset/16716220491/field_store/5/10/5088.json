At that instant the moving dot moved right into the billowy clouds and was completely lost to view.  \"Spread out, chaps!\" came Barker's orders. \"Don't think the beggar is turning back. Spread out and keep your eyes skinned. And bear northward.\"  As he was flying on the extreme left Dave cut around sharp north, and stuck his nose down for additional speed. The dot had entered the cloud bank at approximately the same altitude as that of his own Spitfire, but he had the sudden hunch that the Jerry pilot was going to stop climbing. That he was going to go down and try to sneak out from under the cloud bank while the lads of Eighty-Four fruitlessly hunted for him at high altitudes.  \"Maybe I'm wrong,\" Dave murmured. \"And that won't be anything new, and how. But if he sticks to those clouds it'll mean he isn't on photo reconnaissance. And if he goes down under the stuff it'll mean the same thing. Right! There's nothing down there that Goering's little dopes haven't taken a million pictures of since they started this cockeyed war. Yeah! It's my hunch that lad is over here on other business.\"  With a nod for emphasis he steepened the Spitfire's dive a bit and went cutting down across the English sky like a comet gone haywire. In less than practically nothing flat he was down below the altitude of the belly of the stuff. He pulled out and let the Mark 5 prop claw straight forward at an even keel. At the same time he threw back his head and raked the underside of the cloud bank with his eyes.  He saw nothing, however. Nothing but clouds and more clouds. Seconds ticked by to form a minute. He banked slightly and glanced back to see if any of his pals had the same hunch. His was the only Spitfire to be seen, however. The others were way up above him and completely out of sight.  \"A horse on you, Dawson,\" he grunted, \"if they smack the guy down, and buzz back for a spot of tea, leaving you to hunt the little man who isn't there. Yeah! It would be.... Hold it! So there you are, my little Jerry!\"  A war painted Messerschmitt One-Ten had cut down out of the belly of the cloud bank about half a mile ahead of him and perhaps the same distance to the left. It leveled off immediately once it was in clear air and started streaking to the west again.  \"Not today!\" Dave shouted and kicked his Mark Five around in a flash half turn. Then into his flap-mike he bellowed, \"Tally-ho, gang! Downstairs with you!\"     CHAPTER THREE  _Broken Wings_   Whether or not the Messerschmitt's pilot saw Dave closing in on him at lightning speed, the German plane held straight to its course westward. Dave frowned and slid off the safety guard on his trigger button, and started lining up the Messerschmitt in his electric windshield sight.  \"Of course the guy could have suddenly gone blind,\" he murmured to himself. \"Or maybe he's just sick and tired of this war. Me, I wouldn't know. But ... there's just one thing to do when you see a Jerry lad plowing around over forbidden ground. And so!\"  As he spoke the last he started to apply pressure on the little button that would send a shower of machine gun and aerial cannon slugs straight at the German plane. That is, he started to. He didn't complete the action, for at that instant something happened that brought him up straight in the seat with a gasp of surprise.  The Messerschmitt dropped down by the left wing and something went hurtling out through the opened glass \"hatch\" of the three place cockpit. That something became the figure of a man in the next split second. And in the split second after that Dave saw the white puff and the man's parachute blossoming into being. The tumbling figure was jerked sharply upward toward the sky. It seemed to hover motionless for a brief instant, and then start swinging back and forth like the pendulum of a clock while the air filled parachute envelop drifted slowly earthward.  \"Now, ain't that something!\" Dave grunted. \"The boys start getting scared before I've even fired a shot. Wonder which one he is. The pilot, radioman, or the rear gunner. Anyway, he sure....\"  He bit off the rest as he took another look at the figure swaying back and forth at the ends of the parachute's shroud lines. There was something about the man that didn't seem right. But in the next instant Dave realized why. The parachutist was not garbed in flying gear, or even in the uniform of a member of the Nazi Luftwaffe. Instead he wore civilian clothes.  \"Spy dropping in broad daylight?\" Dave gasped. \"Well, I've seen almost everything now! If that isn't a dumb thing to try and pull on us. What does Hitler think we are, anyway? As dumb and thick as his murdering Nazi gang?\"  He let it go unanswered. As a matter of fact he didn't bother to give it a second thought. He didn't for the very simple reason that sudden movement of the Messerschmitt showed that the pilot was still aboard. And the sudden movement also showed, rather, indicated, that the German pilot had decided to knock one Dave Dawson out of the English sky before buzzing on back home to Naziland.  At any rate, the One-Ten whipped around in a wing screaming turn, dropped sharply by the nose for a brief instant and then came tearing up at an angle for the belly of Dave's Spitfire. The Messerschmitt's machine guns and air cannon hammered out sound and jetting flame. Not a shot, however, smacked into the Mark 5 Spitfire. Before the German plane started to zoom Dave belted the stick over, jumped hard on right rudder and spun in less than the area of a dime. Before the maneuver was half completed Dave pulled the Spitfire's nose up straight for the sky.  He roared up a good hundred feet, then kicked the ship over on wingtip and dropped straight down like ten ton of brick. Right below him was the Messerschmitt One-Ten, its pilot striving frantically to kick out from under and go skidding away into the clear. He might just as well have jumped out and tried to walk across the sky back across the Channel. Dave had him cold, and everybody concerned knew it.  \"Next time, stay home!\" Dave shouted and pressed the trigger button.  His guns yammered sound and death. The Messerschmitt took the whole works square in the cockpit. The plane leaped and bolted off to one side as though it had been sideswiped by an invisible express train. For a brief moment Dave saw the pilot and the gunner fighting desperately to shove the cockpit's hood wide open and bail out with their parachutes. Then they became lost to view as sheets of flame belched out from both the port and starboard engines, and the whole plane became a raging ball of fire that went tumbling over and over down toward the ground.  \"Another one you won't be using any more, Goering!\" Dave grunted and pulled the Mark 5 out of its engine howling dive. \"But I wonder why one of those birds jumped so soon? Was he a spy, or was he just too yellow to even be in the Nazi Air Force. Boy! That would be being plenty yellow, what I mean!\"  As he voiced his thoughts aloud he started circling about staring downward for a sign of the descending parachute. He spotted it in less time than it takes to tell. The parachutist was still a good two thousand feet from the ground, and a stiff wind was sending it skidding rapidly to the right as the figure at the ends of the shroud lines made no effort to \"slip\" his 'chute (or spill air from the envelop by hauling down on the shroud lines on that side) to counteract the side-ward movement. As a matter of fact the figure at the ends of the shroud lines didn't seem to be moving a muscle. Instead of the man's hands reaching up to grab the shroud lines and take some of his weight off the harness, the arms just dangled down at the man's side.  \"Maybe he broke them bailing out,\" Dave grunted and stuck the nose of his Spitfire down. \"If so, he's going to land with an awful jolt. And that ground wind's liable to drag him half way across this little island of England. Yeah! Maybe you should have stayed put, my little Jerry.\"  Dave kept his eyes on the seemingly lifeless figure floating earthward with his parachute, and held the Spitfire in its dive until he was down close. There he pulled out, leveled off, and began to circle about the parachutist as a strange sense of weird curiosity got hold of him. And as he cut in closer and closer to the dangling figure his curiosity gradually changed to a sense of utter astonishment. The man in civilian clothes kept his chin sunk down on his chest all the time. He didn't once raise his head to look at Dave's circling plane. And it was absolutely certain that he must be hearing the roar of the Rolls-Royce engine.  As far as that went, however, the man didn't do anything. Any and all movement was caused by the wind whipping at the parachute. The man could well be a sack of wet meal being lowered to earth.  \"Maybe he took sleeping tablets before he jumped out,\" Dave grunted aloud. \"Or maybe.... Hey! What gives?\"  He shouted the question and sent the Spitfire ripping in so close to the dangling figure that he came within a foot of brushing the man with his wingtip. He veered off just in time but not before he saw that there was a sheet of paper pinned to the front of the man's jacket. Whether or not there was writing on the paper, Dave couldn't see. But that the sheet of paper was pinned there was enough to make up his mind.  \"This gets screwier!\" he shouted and hauled back his throttle. \"Screwy as can be. Maybe I'm all wet, but that lad looks stone dead to me. And somebody has pinned a note on his jacket. Me, I'm going down and find out what in heck this is all about.\"  Checking the general direction in which the parachute was drifting, Dave then took a look at the ground below. As luck would have it he spotted a field with plenty of room for a Spitfire to sit down. Having spotted the field he slid down, let down his wing flaps, and presently settled light as a feather on an expanse of slightly uneven ground. As he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50406"],["title","Operation Interstellar (#1)"],["body","you. You fell. I screamed. He grabbed at your wallet----\" Her voice trailed away unhappily.  Paul smiled. \"Nothing in it but personal papers all replaceable. Not more than a few dollars. I'd have handed it over rather than get this clip on the skull. Too bad you couldn't see him.\"  The touch of amusement came again. \"I had my eyes closed, sort of.\"  Paul smiled again. Inwardly he was welcoming the footpad to the contents of his wallet and accepting the bop on the bean as the price to pay for an introduction to the girl.  Someone in the crowd said: \"You'd better come inside until you feel all right.\"  Paul shook his head and was happy to find that the knot inside had diminished to a faint pinpoint. His voice was sounding more like his own, too. \"I've got to go,\" he said.  \"But----\"  The wail of sirens came and a police car dashed to the curb. It spilled policemen from all doors, who came warily. \"What's going on here?\" demanded the sergeant.  Paul explained.  \"You'd better come to the station and lodge a complaint.\"  Paul shook his head. \"I'm Paul Grayson of the Bureau of Astrogation,\" he said. \"I could prove it but the crook has my identification papers. I'm due to take off for space within--\" Paul looked at his watch--\"within forty minutes,\" he finished.  \"We'll require a complaint.\"  \"Can't you take it?\" pleaded Paul. \"Good Lord, man, I can't identify a criminal that clipped me from behind. Hell, the only contact I had with him was hitting the back of my head against his blackjack.\"  The sergeant looked at the woman. \"You can't help?\"  \"Not much more. He was just a blurred shadow to me, he looked like any other man wearing dark clothing--which can be changed all too easily.\"  The sergeant went to the police car and spoke to the main office over the radio. He returned in a moment. \"The lieutenant says we're to run you over to the spaceport and take depositions en route. That'll save time for you, and it will get the dope for our records that we must have. You too, Miss--?\"  \"I'm Nora Phillips. I'll go along, of course. Will you have one of your men keep an eye out for a tall man who should have been passing here by now. He's overdue. He will be Tommy Morgan; we had a date but I came out to meet him on his way to my home. Tell him what happened and explain that I'll return home as soon as this matter is taken care of.\"  The sergeant smiled. \"Toby, you take this stand and ask everybody that comes along if he's Mr. Morgan. Then explain.\"  \"Right.\"  The ride, so far as official information went, was strictly a waste of time. Paul made a mental note of Nora Phillips' address and telephone number and decided that the incident called for good reason to renew the acquaintance. The sergeant made it easy by telling them: \"When you return from your trip, Mr. Grayson, I'll ask you to come in to the station and make a formal complaint. You'll be there too, Miss Phillips.\"  \"I'll be glad to help,\" she told them. Then she turned to Paul. \"You're with Astrogation?\"  He nodded.  \"But why Proxima? I've heard it was a completely useless place.\"  Paul shook his head. \"We want to measure the distance to better accuracy than heliocentric parallax will permit us,\" he said. \"We know the speed of light to a fine decimal, and we can measure time to even a finer degree. So we started a radio beam towards Centauri four years ago, and it will be arriving in not-too-long a time. Then we'll have the distance to a nice detail of perfection.\"  Nora thought for a moment. \"I suppose you're ultimately aiming at Neosol,\" she suggested.  \"That's the idea.\"  \"But Neosol is a hundred light years away--\"  \"One hundred and forty-three at the last count,\" Paul corrected.  \"So it will take a hundred and forty--\"  \"No,\" he smiled. \"Less than three years from now. You see, seven light years is the greatest distance that separates the stars between here and Neosol. We've got a nice network of radio beams criss-crossing the pathway between here and Neosol. Oh,\" he admitted with a smile, \"the triangulation beams will be arriving from now until a hundred years from now, but they're mostly check-beams, and the final beam from Earth to Neoterra will take the full time. But in the meantime we can refine our space charts using the network of beams once they start to arrive. And each time one of the triangulation check-beams gets home, we'll be able to refine the charts even more. But there's no sense in waiting for a century and a half.\"  The sergeant looked at Paul. \"You're certain you can fly with that bump on the head?\"  \"Sure.\"  \"Why not let someone else take it.\"  Paul shook his head. \"It's my job,\" he said quickly.  \"But there must be someone else that can do it. What if you died?\"  \"Oh, there are others trained in this sort of job in that case.\"  \"Why not let one of them take it, then?\"  Paul shook his head again. \"I'm all right,\" he said. He realized that his insistence was too vigorous and that his reasons were too lame. But he could not let them know why it was so important that Paul Grayson go in person. If Haedaecker got wind of what Paul carried in his spacecraft, there would be hell to pay. He thought of a plausible excuse. \"Most of them aren't on earth right now.\"  \"Couldn't you call one of them?\"  Paul smiled ruefully. \"They're outside of the solar system.\"  The sergeant nodded. \"The Z-wave can't cross interstellar space,\" he said. It was a statement thrown in to display his knowledge to the technician from the Bureau of Astrogation, and also a leader for more conversation.  Paul did not bite.  \"That's Haedaecker's Theory,\" added the sergeant. \"Isn't it?\" he added after another moment of silence.  \"Haedaecker's Theory is that the Z-wave propagates only in a region under the influence of solar activity,\" explained Paul. He looked out of the police car and saw the spaceport only a few moments away. Then he talked volubly to fill in the time so that he could be off without further questioning. Haedaecker had plenty of evidence to support his theory, but they all were missing one point that was as plain as the nose on Haedaecker's face.  \"We can talk with ease from the Zero Laboratory on Pluto to the Solar Lab on Mercury, to the boys who are working in the poisonous atmosphere of Jupiter, to the extra-terran paleontologists who are combing Venus,\" said Paul. \"And the Radiation Laboratory sent a gang to try the five planets of Sirius. Again they got the Z-wave working after a bit of fiddling with the tuning. But we've not been able to get so much as a whisper from Sol to Proxima Centauri via Z-wave. What started Haedaecker thinking was the experiment they tried about ten years ago.\" Paul went on before anybody could interrupt.  \"No one can measure the velocity of the Z-wave, you know. So they started a spacecraft running right away from Sol. So long as they were within a fair radius, the Z-wave went both ways easily. But once they went into superdrive and raced away from Sol and got out beyond the orbit of Pluto by quite a bit, they lost contact completely. They made some measurements but these were quite unsuccessful. All we know is that we can use the Z-wave for speech for a long distance beyond the orbit of Pluto, but beyond some distance that might lie between ten times that orbit and--I think they tried it at a light month--the Z-wave dies out abruptly. It falls off like a cliff, you know. There's no apparent attenuation of the Z-wave so long as it is strong enough to get there. Beyond that, there is not even the whisper of a signal. It's a peculiar thing, but we know very little about the Z-wave, and--\"  The driver brought the police car to a screeching halt. \"Here you are, folks,\" he chirped.  Paul got out of the car quickly. \"I'll be back,\" he told the sergeant. \"I'll call you.\" And then to Nora Phillips he added, \"I'll call you, too.\"  \"Do,\" she said pointedly. \"I'd like to know more about the Z-wave.\"  Paul nodded amiably. He did not voice his inner thought: _So would I, Baby!_     CHAPTER 2   The police car U-turned in the broad roadway and headed off to return Nora Phillips to her home and to pick up the officer set to sentry duty. Paul waved them off and then started to walk up the pavement towards the administration building.  He was feeling better. Everything pleased him vastly. The knot inside of his head was gone, he had made the acquaintance of a very delectable armful of femininity, and now he had been chauffeured to the spaceport by none other than the City Police Department, complete with siren.  On his way up the sidewalk, Paul planned the retort perfect. Anticipating some humorous sarcasm on the mode of his arrival, Paul hoped to crush any verbal volley with unanswerable repartee. Usually Paul's fount of boundless wit ran just a trifle slow, following the definition of a bon mot: something you think of on the way home. This time he was going to be prepared.  He swung the door airily and strode in, his tongue poised over a few words of terse wit.  The guard looked at him and swallowed a large lump. \"How in hell did you get out?\" he gasped.  This was not according to plan; unfortunately, the guard had not read Paul's script, and the prepared answer would not fit the question. \"I was never in,\" said Paul lamely, again wishing he had a tongue full of ready wit instead of fumbling for a prepared speech.  \"The hell you weren't.\"  Paul took it from there, ignoring the fact that the guard had not followed Paul's mental conversation. \"That was a car reserved for very important personages,\" he said. \"From now on you can call me Viper.\"  The guard by-passed this. \"But how did you get out?\" he asked. His voice was almost a plea. \"You didn't pass me.\"  \"Were you guarding the jail too?\" chuckled Paul. \"Fast man, no?\"  \"You came in a taxicab the first time.\"  \"Ah yes. But that was years ago before people knew of my brilliance, importance, and high station. Now--\"  \"Years ago, my eye. Less than fifteen minutes ago--\"  \"I did not.\"  \"You"]]]
