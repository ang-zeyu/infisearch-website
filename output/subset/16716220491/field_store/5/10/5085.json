Their designing leaders have left them to seek after     fortunes elsewhere. Those that remain of the old stock are the     masses, always honest in the main and sincere even in delusion; and     their guides are a few tried and trusty men, little initiated in     the plotting of synagogues, and more noted for services rendered     than bounties received. They are the men whom I saw on the prairie     trail, sharing sorrow with the sorrowful, and poverty with the     poor; the chief of them all, a man of rare natural endowment, to     whose masterly guidance they are mainly indebted for their present     prosperity, driving his own ox team and carrying his sick child in     his arms.\"  We have the statement of Sidney Rigdon, one of those who forsook the cause. It is found in his Messenger and Advocate for June, 1846, pages 474-5, and a portion of his statement I will now read:      \"Their camp [that is the camp of the exiles, the pioneers] is in     the western part of Iowa, some 200 miles west of Nauvoo. Their     situation according to our informant, is as miserable as it well     could be. Their stock of provisions they took with them, is getting     fast reduced, so much so, that they can proceed no further; neither     can they go back. They are there without shelter, other than tents     and wagons, and their tents so indifferent that they will not shed     the rain, which has been incessantly falling since their arrival.     In this awful condition is to be found the aged and infirm, the     mother and tender infant. When our informant left, they were     going to fence in some 300 or 400 acres of land, for the purpose     of raising a crop of corn to try and preserve life. The remains     of their furniture, which in part consists of beds and bedding,     they are sending off to Missouri to exchange for corn and bacon to     sustain life. * * * * This said Young professed to be a follower     of Christ, and hold communion with Him, and to receive revelations     from Him; but where are his pretensions now? He has got, according     to our informant, some 800 or 1,000 people far into the wilds,     without food, without shelter, and himself being judge, without     object. * * * A state of wretchedness beyond this is not easily     conceived of. Our informant says when he left, which was some three     weeks since [and I may add that it is quite evident from this     account why he left] the mud, by reason of the incessant rains, was     six inches deep round their camp.\"  I suppose that there are some present this afternoon who realize the hardships through which the pioneers had to pass that tried men's souls and that only the faithful were able to endure.  I have now shown that the great majority of the Latter-day Saints followed President Brigham Young and were true to the Church. We get a good idea of the number who scattered from the testimony of William W. Blair.   FEW JOINED REORGANITES.  Of the members of the Church who were in fellowship in 1844-6, the \"Reorganized\" Church has received no more, and likely less than 1,000 converts, which fact shows that the apostasy was not so great in 1844-6 as has been stated by the Senator from Michigan and members of the \"Reorganization.\" This statement is based on the testimony of William W. Blair, one of the original members of the \"Reorganized\" Church, as he testified before the United States court of appeals for the Western district of Missouri, in 1894, in the temple lot suit, which was for the possession of property in the hands of the \"Church of Christ,\" or \"Hedrickites.\"  Before that court Mr. Blair, who was for many years a member of the presidency of the \"Reorganized\" Church, testified that \"1,000 was probably too high an estimate for the members of the original Church, that had joined the 'Reorganized' Church.\" He could \"approximately say,\" that 1,000 had joined the \"Reorganized\" Church, and \"possibly that estimate was too large.\" (Record pp. 180, 181).   ORIGIN OF \"REORGANIZED\" CHURCH.  We will now consider the origin of this \"Reorganized\" Church. Many people have been lead to believe that this society had its origin at the martyrdom, or immediately following the martyrdom. But this is not the fact. Properly it did not come into existence until 1860--16 years after the martyrdom, but the two men who were mainly responsible for the organization commenced their work in 1852-3. These men were Jason W. Briggs and Zenas H. Gurley. Perhaps a brief outline of their lives would be interesting.  Jason W. Briggs who was really the founder of the \"Reorganized\" Church, or, who perhaps did more than any other one man to bring about that sect, was born June 25, 1821, at Pompey, Onondaga county, N. Y. It is said he joined the Church at Potosi, Wis., about 1841, but most of the history of this man we get through the records of the \"reorganization.\" His home was at Beloit, Wis., from 1842 to 1854.[3] He remained with the Church under the leadership of President Young and the Twelve until the year 1846 (Reorg. Hist., 3:737). It is interesting to note in this regard that the exodus commenced February 4, 1846, so we are quite safe in saying that this man was one of \"the fair weather friends.\"  After the exodus he joined James J. Strang, and in his organization labored in the ministry quite extensively (Reorganite History 3; 737), filling short missions to various parts of New York and in Wisconsin.  In September of 1849, with B. G. Wright, he organized the Waukesha branch of Mr. Strang's church (Hist. Reorganized Church, 3; 737-8). Now, remember this was in September, 1849, and the organization of this branch was in the Strangite church. About this same time he also organized the Beloit branch for the same organization.[4]  In 1850 he left Mr. Strang's organization and joined with William Smith, who had himself been a follower of Mr. Strang until excommunicated from that organization. In William Smith's church Mr. Briggs accepted the position of \"apostle;\" but at the time of the disintegration of William Smith's church in 1851, he withdrew, and in 1852 joined with Zenas H. Gurley. These two men then organized what was called at the time the \"New Organization of the Church,\" but today known as the \"Reorganized\" Church.  In 1886, together with the family of Zenas H. Gurley,[5] Mr. Briggs withdrew from the \"Reorganization,\" which he had begotten. (Saints' Herald, 33; 248-9). His reasons for withdrawing we will consider later.  Zenas H. Gurley was more active in the Church previous to the martyrdom. He was ordained a Seventy in Nauvoo in 1844, and when the Twenty-first quorum of Seventy was organized, April 6, 1845, he was chosen as the senior president, he being the oldest of the presidents chosen. He was a native of New York state, born May 29, 1801, and was therefore 43 years of age in 1844.  We know something about this man's career between the martyrdom and the exodus from the minutes of this quorum of Seventy. And as this record contains some very interesting items I will read a few of them here. In the minutes of November 2, 1845, we read:      \"President Zenas H. Gurley apologized for his absence the two last     meetings. He then enlarged upon the subject (i. e., the subject     before the quorum). He said he had received the assurance of     an addition of power of the Priesthood upon every accession of     authority he had received. We ought to be the best men living in     consideration of our privileges as members of the Church of Jesus     Christ of Latter-day Saints, enlightened as it was with divine     revelation, He exhorted the brethren not to aspire but to rise upon     their own merits and to visit the poor in their afflictions.\"  In the minutes of November 9, we are informed that President Erastus H. Derby, one of the presidents of that quorum, said:      \"Brother Brigham advised and counseled the Saints to get ready for     emigration in May, 1846. If he (Derby) possessed the wealth of the     whole nation he would not stay behind the Church going into the     wilderness.\"  Immediately following these remarks, Zenas H. Gurley arose and said, as the minutes read, that \"He confirmed the same.\" That is, he too would rather forsake the wealth of the whole nation than fail to go with the Church into the wilderness. Then continuing his remarks, he said:      \"Small prototypes of great national events were given by command     of God, by the ancient prophets, and the like would probably     nowadays distinguish what God is about to do in the earth. * * *     Certain characters have been elected from before time to fulfill     certain purposes in the earth, called though they were from all     nations, tongues, and ranks. * * * The order of free masonry was     outrageously violated by the people of Hancock; but the pledges,     obligations and vows of the Latter-day Saints would, if adhered to,     exalt them to thrones dominions and power.\"  This was in relation to temple work. On the 21st of December, 1845, he said:      \"He remembered forcibly the sayings of the first presidents of     Seventy, that we should so live that no charge can be brought     against us. A few years ago the men in high standing in this     Church (the Twelve) were as little as we are. They obtained their     exaltation by patient submission to right, and minding their own     business. * * * There are many young men in this quorum able to     travel a great way. You will be called on to go, also to receive     your endowment. Keep always meek and a teachable spirit. The willow     always bends in the breeze and is also firm in the root. Though     many have gone out from the Church.\"--now remember this--\"YET     it increases as fast as ever and evinces to the world as great     affinity and identity to the eternal plan of Jehovah as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5038"],["title","State of the Union Addresses (#1)"],["body","believed that we were in the past generation raising the ethical standards of business. They call for stringent preventive or regulatory measures. I am speaking of those individuals who have evaded the spirit and purpose of our tax laws, of those high officials of banks or corporations who have grown rich at the expense of their stockholders or the public, of those reckless speculators with their own or other people's money whose operations have injured the values of the farmers' crops and the savings of the poor.  In the other category, crimes of organized banditry, coldblooded shooting, lynching and kidnapping have threatened our security.  These violations of ethics and these violations of law call on the strong arm of Government for their immediate suppression; they call also on the country for an aroused public opinion.  The adoption of the Twenty-first Amendment should give material aid to the elimination of those new forms of crime which came from the illegal traffic in liquor.  I shall continue to regard it as my duty to use whatever means may be necessary to supplement State, local and private agencies for the relief of suffering caused by unemployment. With respect to this question, I have recognized the dangers inherent in the direct giving of relief and have sought the means to provide not mere relief, but the opportunity for useful and remunerative work. We shall, in the process of recovery, seek to move as rapidly as possible from direct relief to publicly supported work and from that to the rapid restoration of private employment.  It is to the eternal credit of the American people that this tremendous readjustment of our national life is being accomplished peacefully, without serious dislocation, with only a minimum of injustice and with a great, willing spirit of cooperation throughout the country.  Disorder is not an American habit. Self-help and self-control are the essence of the American tradition--not of necessity the form of that tradition, but its spirit. The program itself comes from the American people.  It is an integrated program, national in scope. Viewed in the large, it is designed to save from destruction and to keep for the future the genuinely important values created by modern society. The vicious and wasteful parts of that society we could not save if we wished; they have chosen the way of self-destruction. We would save useful mechanical invention, machine production, industrial efficiency, modern means of communication, broad education. We would save and encourage the slowly growing impulse among consumers to enter the industrial market place equipped with sufficient organization to insist upon fair prices and honest sales.  But the unnecessary expansion of industrial plants, the waste of natural resources, the exploitation of the consumers of natural monopolies, the accumulation of stagnant surpluses, child labor, and the ruthless exploitation of all labor, the encouragement of speculation with other people's money, these were consumed in the fires that they themselves kindled; we must make sure that as we reconstruct our life there be no soil in which such weeds can grow again.  We have plowed the furrow and planted the good seed; the hard beginning is over. If we would reap the full harvest, we must cultivate the soil where this good seed is sprouting and the plant is reaching up to mature growth.  A final personal word. I know that each of you will appreciate that. I am speaking no mere politeness when I assure you how much I value the fine relationship that we have shared during these months of hard and incessant work. Out of these friendly contacts we are, fortunately, building a strong and permanent tie between the legislative and executive branches of the Government. The letter of the Constitution wisely declared a separation, but the impulse of common purpose declares a union. In this spirit we join once more in serving the American people.   ***  State of the Union Address Franklin D. Roosevelt January 4, 1935  Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:  The Constitution wisely provides that the Chief Executive shall report to the Congress on the state of the Union, for through you, the chosen legislative representatives, our citizens everywhere may fairly judge the progress of our governing. I am confident that today, in the light of the events of the past two years, you do not consider it merely a trite phrase when I tell you that I am truly glad to greet you and that I look forward to common counsel, to useful cooperation, and to genuine friendships between us.  We have undertaken a new order of things; yet we progress to it under the framework and in the spirit and intent of the American Constitution. We have proceeded throughout the Nation a measurable distance on the road toward this new order. Materially, I can report to you substantial benefits to our agricultural population, increased industrial activity, and profits to our merchants. Of equal moment, there is evident a restoration of that spirit of confidence and faith which marks the American character. Let him, who, for speculative profit or partisan purpose, without just warrant would seek to disturb or dispel this assurance, take heed before he assumes responsibility for any act which slows our onward steps.  Throughout the world, change is the order of the day. In every Nation economic problems, long in the making, have brought crises of many kinds for which the masters of old practice and theory were unprepared. In most Nations social justice, no longer a distant ideal, has become a definite goal, and ancient Governments are beginning to heed the call.  Thus, the American people do not stand alone in the world in their desire for change. We seek it through tested liberal traditions, through processes which retain all of the deep essentials of that republican form of representative government first given to a troubled world by the United States.  As the various parts in the program begun in the Extraordinary Session of the 73rd Congress shape themselves in practical administration, the unity of our program reveals itself to the Nation. The outlines of the new economic order, rising from the disintegration of the old, are apparent. We test what we have done as our measures take root in the living texture of life. We see where we have built wisely and where we can do still better.  The attempt to make a distinction between recovery and reform is a narrowly conceived effort to substitute the appearance of reality for reality itself. When a man is convalescing from illness, wisdom dictates not only cure of the symptoms, but also removal of their cause.  It is important to recognize that while we seek to outlaw specific abuses, the American objective of today has an infinitely deeper, finer and more lasting purpose than mere repression. Thinking people in almost every country of the world have come to realize certain fundamental difficulties with which civilization must reckon. Rapid changes--the machine age, the advent of universal and rapid communication and many other new factors--have brought new problems. Succeeding generations have attempted to keep pace by reforming in piecemeal fashion this or that attendant abuse. As a result, evils overlap and reform becomes confused and frustrated. We lose sight, from time to time, of our ultimate human objectives.  Let us, for a moment, strip from our simple purpose the confusion that results from a multiplicity of detail and from millions of written and spoken words.  We find our population suffering from old inequalities, little changed by vast sporadic remedies. In spite of our efforts and in spite of our talk, we have not weeded out the over privileged and we have not effectively lifted up the underprivileged. Both of these manifestations of injustice have retarded happiness. No wise man has any intention of destroying what is known as the profit motive; because by the profit motive we mean the right by work to earn a decent livelihood for ourselves and for our families.  We have, however, a clear mandate from the people, that Americans must forswear that conception of the acquisition of wealth which, through excessive profits, creates undue private power over private affairs and, to our misfortune, over public affairs as well. In building toward this end we do not destroy ambition, nor do we seek to divide our wealth into equal shares on stated occasions. We continue to recognize the greater ability of some to earn more than others. But we do assert that the ambition of the individual to obtain for him and his a proper security, a reasonable leisure, and a decent living throughout life, is an ambition to be preferred to the appetite for great wealth and great power.  I recall to your attention my message to the Congress last June in which I said: \"among our objectives I place the security of the men, women and children of the Nation first.\" That remains our first and continuing task; and in a very real sense every major legislative enactment of this Congress should be a component part of it.  In defining immediate factors which enter into our quest, I have spoken to the Congress and the people of three great divisions:  1. The security of a livelihood through the better use of the national resources of the land in which we live.  2. The security against the major hazards and vicissitudes of life.  3. The security of decent homes.  I am now ready to submit to the Congress a broad program designed ultimately to establish all three of these factors of security--a program which because of many lost years will take many future years to fulfill.  A study of our national resources, more comprehensive than any previously made, shows the vast amount of necessary and practicable work which needs to be done for the development and preservation of our natural wealth for the enjoyment and advantage of our people in"]]]
