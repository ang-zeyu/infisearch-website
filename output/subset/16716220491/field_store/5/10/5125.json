We got a planet-wide radar, and ain't no unidentified ships come near, not since we first landed more'n a year ago.\" He lifted the rifle and peered through the bore. \"Uh-uh. One of us did it.\"  The man had been thinking. And he knew the planet.  \"Telepathy?\" asked Dylan.  \"Might be.\"  \"Can't see it. You people live too close, you'd notice right away if one of you wasn't ... himself. And, if they've got one, why not all?\"  Rush calmly--at least outwardly calmly--lit his pipe. There was a strength in this man that Dylan had missed before.  \"Don't know,\" he said gruffly. \"But these are aliens, mister. And until I know different I'm keepin' an eye on my neighbor.\"  He gave Rossel a sour look and Rossel stared back, uncomprehending.  Then Rossel jumped. \"My God!\"  Dylan moved to quiet him. \"Look, is there any animal at all that ever comes near here that's as large as a dog?\"  After a pause, Rush answered. \"Yep, there's one. The viggle. It's like a reg'lar monkey but with four legs. Biology cleared 'em before we landed. We shoot one now and then when they get pesky.\" He rose slowly, the rifle held under his arm. \"I b'lieve we might just as well go post them sentries.\"  Dylan wanted to go on with this but there was nothing much else to say. Rossel went with them as far as the radio shack, with a strained expression on his face, to put through that call to Three.  When he was gone Rush asked Dylan, \"Where you want them sentries? I got Walt Halloran and Web Eggers and six others lined up.\"  Dylan stopped and looked around grimly at the circling wall of snow. \"You know the site better than I do. Post 'em in a ring, on rises, within calling distance. Have 'em check with each other every five minutes. I'll go help your people at the ship.\"  The gloomy man nodded and fluffed up his collar. \"Nice day for huntin',\" he said, and then he was gone with the snow quickly covering his footprints.         *       *       *       *       *  The Alien lay wrapped in a thick electric cocoon, buried in a wide warm room beneath the base of a tree. The tree served him as antennae; curiously he gazed into a small view-screen and watched the humans come. He saw them fan out, eight of them, and sink down in the snow. He saw that they were armed.  He pulsed thoughtfully, extending a part of himself to absorb a spiced lizard. Since the morning, when the new ship had come, he had been watching steadily, and now it was apparent that the humans were aware of their danger. Undoubtedly they were preparing to leave.  That was unfortunate. The attack was not scheduled until late that night and he could not, of course, press the assault by day. But _flexibility_, he reminded himself sternly, _is the first principle of absorption_, and therefore he moved to alter his plans. A projection reached out to dial several knobs on a large box before him, and the hour of assault was moved forward to dusk. A glance at the chronometer told him that it was already well into the night on Planet Three, and that the attack there had probably begun.  The Alien felt the first tenuous pulsing of anticipation. He lay quietly, watching the small square lights of windows against the snow, thanking the Unexplainable that matters had been so devised that he would not have to venture out into that miserable cold.  Presently an alarming thought struck him. These humans moved with uncommon speed for intelligent creatures. Even without devices, it was distinctly possible that they could be gone before nightfall. He could take no chance, of course. He spun more dials and pressed a single button, and lay back again comfortably, warmly, to watch the disabling of the colonists' ship.         *       *       *       *       *  When Three did not answer, Rossel was nervously gazing at the snow, thinking of other things, and he called again. Several moments later the realization of what was happening struck him like a blow. Three had never once failed to answer. All they had to do when they heard the signal buzz was go into the radio shack and say hello. That was all they had to do. He called again and again, but nobody answered. There was no static and no interference and he didn't hear a thing. He checked frenziedly through his own apparatus and tried again, but the air was as dead as deep space. He raced out to tell Dylan.  Dylan accepted it. He had known none of the people on Three and what he felt now was a much greater urgency to be out of here. He said hopeful things to Rossel, and then went out to the ship and joined the men in lightening her. About the ship at least, he knew something and he was able to tell them what partitions and frames could go and what would have to stay or the ship would never get off the planet. But even stripped down, it couldn't take them all. When he knew that, he realized that he himself would have to stay here, for it was only then that he thought of Bossio.  Three was dead. Bossio had gone down there some time ago and, if Three was dead and Bossio had not called, then the fact was that Bossio was gone too. For a long, long moment Dylan stood rooted in the snow. More than the fact that he would have to stay here was the unspoken, unalterable, heart-numbing knowledge that Bossio was dead--the one thing that Dylan could not accept. Bossio was the only friend he had. In all this dog-eared, aimless, ape-run Universe Bossio was all his friendship and his trust.  He left the ship blindly and went back to the settlement. Now the people were quiet and really frightened, and some of the women were beginning to cry. He noticed now that they had begun to look at him with hope as he passed, and in his own grief, humanly, he swore.  Bossio--a big-grinning kid with no parents, no enemies, no grudges--Bossio was already dead because he had come out here and tried to help these people. People who had kicked or ignored him all the days of his life. And, in a short while, Dylan would also stay behind and die to save the life of somebody he never knew and who, twenty-four hours earlier, would have been ashamed to be found in his company. Now, when it was far, far too late, they were coming to the army for help.         *       *       *       *       *  But in the end, damn it, he could not hate these people. All they had ever wanted was peace, and even though they had never understood that the Universe is unknowable and that you must always have big shoulders, still they had always sought only for peace. If peace leads to no conflict at all and then decay, well, that was something that had to be learned. So he could not hate these people.  But he could not help them either. He turned from their eyes and went into the radio shack. It had begun to dawn on the women that they might be leaving without their husbands or sons, and he did not want to see the fierce struggle that he was sure would take place. He sat alone and tried, for the last time, to call Bossio.  After a while, an old woman found him and offered him coffee. It was a very decent thing to do, to think of him at a time like this, and he was so suddenly grateful he could only nod. The woman said that he must be cold in that thin army thing and that she had brought along a mackinaw for him. She poured the coffee and left him alone.  They were thinking of him now, he knew, because they were thinking of everyone who had to stay. Throw the dog a bone. Dammit, don't be like that, he told himself. He had not had anything to eat all day and the coffee was warm and strong. He decided he might be of some help at the ship.  It was stripped down now and they were loading. He was startled to see a great group of them standing in the snow, removing their clothes. Then he understood. The clothes of forty people would change the weight by enough to get a few more aboard. There was no fighting. Some of the women were almost hysterical and a few had refused to go and were still in their cabins, but the process was orderly. Children went automatically, as did the youngest husbands and all the women. The elders were shuffling around in the snow, waving their arms to keep themselves warm. Some of them were laughing to keep their spirits up.  In the end, the ship took forty-six people.  Rossel was one of the ones that would not be going. Dylan saw him standing by the airlock holding his wife in his arms, his face buried in her soft brown hair. A sense of great sympathy, totally unexpected, rose up in Dylan, and a little of the lostness of thirty years went slipping away. These were his people. It was a thing he had never understood before, because he had never once been among men in great trouble. He waited and watched, learning, trying to digest this while there was still time. Then the semi-naked colonists were inside and the airlock closed. But when the ship tried to lift, there was a sharp burning smell--she couldn't get off the ground.         *       *       *       *       *  Rush was sitting hunched over in the snow, his rifle across his knees. He was coated a thick white and if he hadn't spoken Dylan would have stumbled over him. Dylan took out his pistol and sat down.  \"What happened?\" Rush asked.  \"Lining burned out. She's being repaired.\"  \"Coincidence?\"  Dylan shook his head.  \"How long'll it take to fix?\"  \"Four--five hours.\"  \"It'll be night by then.\" Rush paused. \"I wonder.\"  \"Seems like they want to wait 'til dark.\"  \"That's what I was figurin'. Could be they ain't got much of a force.\"  Dylan shrugged. \"Also could mean they see better at night. Also could mean they move slow. Also could mean they want the least number of casualties.\"  Rush was quiet and the snow fell softly on his face, on his eyebrows, where it had begun to gather. At length he said, \"You got any idea how they got to the ship?\"  Dylan shook his head again. \"Nobody saw anything--but they were all pretty busy. Your theory about it maybe being one of us is "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50863"],["title","Alien Minds (#1)"],["body","roches deserve the best.\"  \"Yes, my food is poor,\" the dealer moved his hand deprecatingly. \"I'm glad the roches are to have such a considerate master.\"  And Hanlon could read in his mind that the merchant actually was pleased. The S S man felt that he had passed this first public test with high grades.  In one of the better-class food stalls Hanlon found some good, clean meat, and the other foods such animals ate. After the customary game of haggling, he ordered a two days' supply to be delivered at once, and the order duplicated every other day until further notice.  Then he hunted up a suit-maker. Here it took a lot of persuasion, and the showing of his money, before the tailor would even believe that Hanlon really meant what he said when he tried to order nine uniforms, eight of them of such outlandish shape and size. For one of them was for himself, the others for his newly-bought roches.  It was only when Hanlon finally lost patience and said sharply, \"You stupid lout, I want them for a theatrical act,\" that the uniform-maker realized the reason for such an unusual order. Then things ran smoothly. The design was sketched, and material of a red to harmonize with the grayish-tan of the roches was chosen. The tailor consented also, for an added fee, to rush the job.  Hanlon's way home led through part of the district where the larger, better-class shops were located. He stopped in front of one of these.  He knew from his studies and from what he had seen here, that Estrella was just at the beginning of a mechanical culture. What sciences and machines they had were unbelievably crude and primitive to him, accustomed as he was to the high technologies of Terra and the colonized planets.  This display he was scanning featured their means of personal transportation. There were, of course, no moving slideways, nor even automobiles nor ground cabs nor copters. Instead, the Estrellans used motorized tricycles. Even the smallest of these was heavy, cumbersome, crude and inefficient, but they were speedier and easier than walking--when they worked.  The tricycles had large wheels, about three feet in diameter, with semi-hard, rubber-like tires. There were two wheels in back and one in front, steered by a tiller lever. Because of the weight of the engine and tank for the gas, even the smallest trike weighed several hundred pounds.  The fuel was acetylene gas, Hanlon found to his dismay. Electricity had been discovered here, but as yet they knew only direct current. No AC--no vacuum tubes--no telephones--no radios--no television--\"ner nothing,\" Hanlon snorted in disgust.  But the native scientists and technicians had found how to use their D C to manufacture calcium carbide. Thus, they had plenty of acetylene gas, and many ways of using this for power.  \"I'd lots rather have a good two-wheeled bike,\" Hanlon thought to himself, but decided, \"guess I'd better buy one of these. Probably have to do a lot of chasing around, and since there's no 'for hire' ground cabs, I don't want to have to walk all the time. Besides, I might have to get somewhere in a hurry.\"  The salesman had first tried to sell him one of the larger three- or four-place family-sized tricycles that steered with a wheel. But Hanlon finally made the man understand that he wanted only a one-man machine, and the purchase was haggled into completion--at a price so low it surprised the young secret serviceman.  \"Sure is one screwy world,\" he shook his head as he rode back toward his apartment, after learning how to operate his new machine and its tricky engine.  Back in his room, Hanlon reviewed the situation to date on this, his second assignment for the secret service of the Inter-Stellar Corps. He had been at the head of the commission sent to Algon where he (Hanlon) had been largely instrumental in freeing from slavery the strange, vegetable-like people, the Guddus.[1] The commission had helped them make a treaty with the Federated Planets by which the natives allowed the humans to mine certain valuable metals from their planet, and to maintain the spaceship-yards that had been built by the men who had formerly enslaved them, in return for protection from exploiters, and for certain cultural assistance. Just as his work there was about finished, a message had come for Captain Hanlon to report back to the planet Simonides.  [Footnote 1: See \"MAN OF MANY MINDS,\" Fantasy Press, 1953.]  There he met his father, Regional Admiral Newton, second in command of the secret service. (This discrepancy of names was due to the fact that after young Spencer Newton's mother died, and his father \"disappeared\"--at the time he joined the secret service--the boy was adopted by George Hanlon, an ex-Corpsman, and his wife, and had taken his foster-father's name.)  \"We're not getting anywhere on Estrella,\" his father had begun abruptly once they had warmly greeted each other. \"I've come to the conclusion, and the Council agrees, that we need your special mental abilities there. But take it easy, Spence ... er, I never can seem to get used to calling you 'George'. Don't try to go it alone ... and you can wipe that cocky smirk off your face, mister,\" he commanded sternly. \"This time it's an official order from the top brass. Those Estrellans are distinctly alien--not humans gone wrong.\"  Hanlon sobered down a bit, but secretly could not entirely shake off his attitude, feeling sure he was more than a match for any trouble he might run into. Hadn't he proved it, on Algon and right here on Simonides? Sure he had. Great Snyder, he wasn't a kid any more. He was a secret serviceman of the Inter-Stellar Corps, whom they called in when the rest of them, even his adored dad, failed.  \"Just what's the problem there?\" he asked, trying not to let these thoughts show in his face.  \"The people of Estrella are not colonists from Terra or any of the colonized planets,\" the admiral explained slowly. \"They are native to that world--the first such, by the way, that we have discovered who are advanced enough to be asked to join the Federation with equal status. They are quite man-like in shape, and of a high order of civilization. Their culture is much like Earth's was two hundred and fifty or three hundred years ago.\"  \"Just beginning their real introduction to scientific and mechanical technologies on a planetary scale, eh?\"  \"That's it. Their system was discovered and mapped a few years ago. The Colonial Board immediately sent psychologists and linguists there to learn their language and study the natives and their form of government, their economics and general advancement. What they found, although far different from our own, was so surprisingly high that we sent them a formal offer to join the Federation. But ...\" he stopped, frowning.  \"Yes?\" Hanlon was interested now, and paying close attention. \"But what?\"  \"That's what we don't know. At first they seemed very pleased with the offer. They studied it carefully and, at our suggestion, sent a picked group of statesmen, scientists and merchants on a trip to our various worlds in one of our ships. These men and women seemed delighted with what they found, and enthusiastic about their world joining us. But, shortly after their return home and before the final treaties were signed, opposition began to develop.\"  \"What kind of...?\"  \"All kinds. Enough to make the plans slow down and halt. The embassy sent there couldn't discover the reason--we have trouble enough understanding their way of thinking at all--and they yelled for help. We sent a couple of S S men there, and when they failed, I went there myself, to help them, and the embassy came home.\"  He shook his head. \"I can't find a thing, either, that seems significant. Oh, the surface opposition is easily discernable. Papers, handbills, inflammatory speeches by spellbinders, whispering campaigns, all calling for keeping Estrella for the Estrellans and running out all foreigners bent on plundering the planet for their own enrichment--that sort of thing.\"  \"Maybe some natives who want to take over, themselves,\" Hanlon ventured.  \"Could be. We've thought of that, but have found no proof. We have no proof of anything except the opposition. Only one thing, that may or may not have something to do with this. We've discovered that almost simultaneously with this opposition an unprecedented crime wave started there--every type of criminal activity imaginable, and that is almost unheard of on that world. But we can't even get the first leads as to _who_ is behind it all. That's why I suggested you be called in, and the staff agreed.\"  The admiral paused and his piercing gray eyes bored earnestly into the blue ones of his son. \"Keep this in mind at all times, Spence, for it is most important. We _must_ succeed there. This is the first non-Terran world we've found equal in cultural advancement to ours. But surely it won't be the last. And we must win them over. All civilized worlds must band together for mutual growth and well-being. So this is our most important project just now.\"  \"Yes,\" seriously, \"I can see that. Also, that if we do get them to join us, we can point out that fact to any other planets we may discover and try to bring into the Federation in the future.\"  _And lying at ease on a heavily-padded bench before the control board of a space cruiser, a stranger looked deeply into a multiphased scanner that worked on scientific principles not yet discovered by humans._  _For long, long months its mind had been studying this new world and its inhabitants. The language had been learned, after a fashion, as had much of the planetary economics and governmental intricacies. Now the minds of the people were being studied; it was searching, always searching, for certain types._  _But part of that mind remained continually in that of one certain Estrellan it had long ago selected._     CHAPTER 2   So now SSM George Hanlon was here on this planet they called Estrella, trying to see what he could"]]]
