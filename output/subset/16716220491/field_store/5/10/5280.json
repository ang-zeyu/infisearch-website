Within a few minutes of taking the sleeping compound, she was calm. As he put her back to bed, she laughed with a lazy indolence.  \"Oh, Conrad, you take it so seriously. I only needed a sleeping compound very badly and now I feel fine. I'll sleep all day. It's a rest day, isn't it? Now go race a rocket and stop worrying and thinking about calling the medicops.\"  But Conrad did not go rocket racing as he had planned. Clara had been asleep only a few minutes when there was a call on the visiophone; they wanted him at the office. The city of Santa Fe would be completely out of balance within twelve shifts if revised plans were not put into operation immediately. They were to start during the next five days while he would be out of shift. In order to carry on the first day of their next shift, he and the other three traffic managers he worked with would have to come down today and familiarize themselves with the new operations.  There was no getting out of it. His rest day was spoiled. Conrad resented it all the more because Santa Fe was clear out on the edge of their traffic district and could have been revised out of the Mexican offices just as well. But those boys down there rested all five days of their shift.  Conrad looked in on Clara before he left and found her asleep in the total suspension of proper drug level. The unpleasant memory of her behavior made him squirm, but now that the episode was over, it no longer worried him. It was typical of him that, things having been set straight in the proper manner, he did not think of her again until late in the afternoon.         *       *       *       *       *  As early as 1950, the pioneer communications engineer Norbert Wiener had pointed out that there might be a close parallel between disassociation of personalities and the disruption of a communication system. Wiener referred back specifically to the first clear description, by Morton Prince, of multiple personalities existing, together in the same human body. Prince had described only individual cases and his observations were not altogether acceptable in Wiener's time. Nevertheless, in the schizophrenic society of the 29th Century, a major managerial problem was that of balancing the communicating and non-communicating populations in a city.  As far as Conrad and the other traffic men present at the conference were concerned, Santa Fe was a resort and retirement area of 100,000 human bodies, alive and consuming more than they produced every day of the year. Whatever the representatives of the Medicorps and Communications Board worked out, it would mean only slight changes in the types of foodstuffs, entertainment and so forth moving into Santa Fe, and Conrad could have grasped the entire traffic change in ten minutes after the real problem had been settled. But, as usual, he and the other traffic men had to sit through two hours while small wheels from the Medicorps and Communications acted big about rebalancing a city.  For them, Conrad had to admit, Santa Fe was a great deal more complex than 100,000 consuming, moderately producing human bodies. It was 200,000 human personalities, two to each body. Conrad wondered sometimes what they would have done if the three and four personality cases so common back in the 20th and 21st Centuries had been allowed to reproduce. The 200,000 personalities in Santa Fe were difficult enough.  Like all cities, Santa Fe operated in five shifts, A, B, C, D, and E.  Just as it was supposed to be for Conrad in his city, today was rest day for the 20,000 hypoalters on D-shift in Santa Fe. Tonight at around 6:00 P.M. they would all go to shifting rooms and be replaced by their hyperalters, who had different tastes in food and pleasure and took different drugs.  Tomorrow would be rest day for the hyperalters on E-shift and in the evening they would turn things over to their hyperalters.  The next day it would be rest for the A-shift hyperalters and three days after that the D-shift hyperalters, including Bill Walden, would rest till evening, when Conrad and the D-shift hypoalters everywhere would again have their five day use of their bodies.  Right now the trouble with Santa Fe's retired population, which worked only for its own maintenance, was that too many elderly people on the D-shift and E-shift had been dying off. This point was brought out by a dapper young department head from Communications.  Conrad groaned when, as he knew would happen, a Medicorps officer promptly set out on an exhaustive demonstration that Medicorps predictions of deaths for Santa Fe had indicated clearly that Communications should have been moving people from D-shift and E-shift into the area.  Actually, it appeared that someone from Communications had blundered and had overloaded the quota of people on A-shift and B-shift moving to Santa Fe. Thus on one rest day there weren't enough people working to keep things going, and later in the week there were so many available workers that they were clogging the city.  None of this was heated exchange or in any way emotional. It was just interminably, exhaustively logical and boring. Conrad fidgeted through two hours of it, seeing his chance for a rocket race dissolving. When at last the problem of balanced shift-populations for Santa Fe was worked out, it took him and the other traffic men only a few minutes to apply their tables and reschedule traffic to coordinate with the population changes.  Disgusted, Conrad walked over to the Tennis Club and had lunch.  There were still two hours of his rest day left when Conrad Manz realized that Bill Walden was again forcing an early shift. Conrad was in the middle of a volley-tennis game and he didn't like having the shift forced so soon. People generally shifted at their appointed regular hour every five days, and a hyperalter was not supposed to use his power to force shift. It was such an unthinkable thing nowadays that there was occasional talk of abolishing the terms hyperalter and hypoalter because they were somewhat disparaging to the hypoalter, and really designated only the antisocial power of the hyperalter to force the shift.  Bill Walden had been cheating two to four hours on Conrad every shift for several periods back. Conrad could have reported it to the Medicorps, but he himself was guilty of a constant misdemeanor about which Bill had not yet complained. Unlike the sedentary Walden, Conrad Manz enjoyed exercise. He overindulged in violent sports and put off sleep, letting Bill Walden make up the fatigue on his shift. That was undoubtedly why the poor old sucker had started cheating a few hours on Conrad's rest day.  Conrad laughed to himself, remembering the time Bill Walden had registered a long list of sports which he wished Conrad to be restrained from--rocket racing, deepsea exploration, jet-skiing. It had only given Conrad some ideas he hadn't had before. The Medicorps had refused to enforce the list on the basis that danger and violent exercise were a necessary outlet for Conrad's constitution. Then poor old Bill had written Conrad a note threatening to sue him for any injury resulting from such sports. As if he had a chance against the Medicorps ruling!  Conrad knew it was no use trying to finish the volley-tennis game. He lost interest and couldn't concentrate on what he was doing when Bill started forcing the shift. Conrad shot the ball back at his opponent in a blistering curve impossible to intercept.  \"So long,\" he yelled at the man. \"I've got some things to do before my shift ends.\"  He lounged into the locker rooms and showered, put his clothes and belongings, including his pharmacase, in a shipping carton, addressed them to his own home and dropped them in the mail chute.  He stepped with languid nakedness across the hall, pressed his identifying wristband to a lock-face and dialed his clothing sizes.  In this way he procured a neatly wrapped, clean shifting costume from the slot. He put it on without bothering to return to his shower room.  He shouted a loud good-bye to no one in particular among the several men and women in the baths and stepped out onto the street.  Conrad felt too good even to be sorry that his shift was over. After all, nothing happened except you came to, five days later, on your next shift. The important thing was the rest day. He had always said the last day of the shift should be a work day; then you would be glad it was over. He guessed the idea was to rest the body before another personality took over. Well, poor old Bill Walden never got a rested body. He probably slept off the first twelve hours.  Walking unhurriedly through the street crowds, Conrad entered a public shifting station and found an empty room. As he started to open the door, a girl came out of the adjoining booth and Conrad hastily averted his glance. She was still rearranging her hair. There were so many rude people nowadays who didn't seem to care at all about the etiquette of shifting, women particularly. They were always redoing their hair or makeup where a person couldn't help seeing them.  Conrad pressed his identifying wristband to the lock and entered the booth he had picked. The act automatically sent the time and his shift number to Medicorps Headquarters.  Once inside the shifting room, Conrad went to the lavatory and turned on the faucet of makeup solvent. In spite of losing two hours of his rest day, he decided to be decent to old Bill, though he was half tempted to leave his makeup on. It was a pretty foul joke, of course, especially on a humorless fellow like poor Walden.  Conrad creamed his face thoroughly and then washed in water and used the automatic dryer. He looked at his strong-lined features in the mirror. They displayed a less distinct expression of his own personality with the makeup gone.  He turned away from the mirror and it "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51844"],["title","Someone to Watch Over Me (#1)"],["body","time, but I don't know if it's always the same one.\" She shivered again.  \"It must be your nerves.\" He went on resolutely, \"Maybe you do need a change of scene.\" Actually it was absurd to feel so apprehensive about the Jump. She'd be safer in hyperspace in his ship than anywhere else in the universe. And a large metropolis might provide distractions to take her mind off--shadows. \"How would you like to go to Burdon?\"  \"That would be real nice!\" But she was not as enthusiastic about it as he had expected.         *       *       *       *       *  She laid a hesitant hand on his arm. \"Honey,\" she began tentatively, \"you--you seem to spend so much time all by yourself. Do I bore you?\"  \"Of course not, dear,\" he said awkwardly. \"It just seems that way to you. Pressure of business....\"  \"But why do you play chess with yourself all the time?\"  \"I've spent so much time in space that I got into the habit of playing alone. Many spacemen do that.\"  She bit her painted lip. \"Sometimes--sometimes when you're alone in your room, I hear your voice. Why do you talk to yourself?\"  It was an effort for him to meet the beautiful, blank blue eyes. \"When you're alone a lot of the time, sweetheart, you have to hear the sound of a voice even if it's your own, or you start hearing voices.\"  \"But you have me,\" she said. \"You're _not_ alone. But you still do it.\"  \"Old habits are hard to break, dear.\"  She looked up at him, trying to force her way past the wall in his eyes. God help her, he thought, if she ever succeeds. \"Would you like me to learn to play chess?\"  \"Would you like to?\"  \"I--don't know,\" she murmured doubtfully. \"I've never been much good at mind things. But I want to be _everything_ to you.\"  \"You are, sweetheart.\" He stooped and kissed her. \"Don't force yourself to do anything you don't want to for my sake. I'm used to playing alone.\"  \"But I want you to do things with _me_!\"  \"I'll do everything else with you,\" he promised.  He went to his room and shut the door behind him. But she had heard him talking there, so sounds must carry through. When they got a place of their own, he would have the walls and doors sound-proofed. Meanwhile, it would be safer to go to the ship.  As he came out of the hotel door, he collided with a man who looked familiar. It took him a moment to identify the sullen, startled face as belonging to that newest member of his crew, young Something Raines.  \"Hello there,\" he said. \"Were you coming to see me?\"  \"N-no, sir. I was just coming in for a--a pack of Earth smokesticks. I can't stand those _stinking_ native brands!\" The boy spoke with a viciousness so unsuited to the subject that it was almost funny. He flushed, perhaps realizing this, perhaps remembering that Mattern was reputed to hail from this sector. \"It's a question of what you're used to, see?\" he mumbled.  \"Of course,\" Mattern agreed pleasantly. \"This is your first time on Erytheia, is it?\"  \"Yes, my first time here.\"  \"Are you enjoying it?\"  \"Well, I dunno exactly.\" There was doubt in the boy's blue eyes. Something in them seemed familiar, more familiar than just recognizing one of his own crewmen. He had a look of--who? Of Lyddy? But that was absurd.         *       *       *       *       *  The doubt in Raines' face had changed to fear, and Mattern realized that he himself must have been just standing there, staring at him. He laughed. \"You're supposed to _enjoy_ Erytheia; it's a pleasure planet.\"  \"Well,\" the boy said, choosing his words with care, \"it's a pretty enough place, but it's set up more for people with money. I mean there's nothing here for fellows like me; the pleasure's for the rich people only. Even the smokesticks cost almost twice as much as anywhere else.\"  \"We'll probably be leaving soon, so you'll only have to stick it a little while longer.\" Mattern's hand went to his pocket, then fell to his side as he saw the look on the boy's face. If Raines was proud, Mattern would not offend him by offering him money. \"Maybe you'll find Burdon more to your liking.\"  \"Oh, _yes_, sir!\" The young spaceman's face was virtually radiant. _He must have a girl on Burdon_, Mattern thought, amused.  As he walked over to the landing field where his ship was moored, he was troubled by the memory of the boy's voice. Not that it was familiar--but there was the faintest hint of a Far Planets accent. Provincials as a rule didn't go to the terrestrial space schools, but it was, of course, possible. Raines must have had an Earth education, because Mattern followed the rule of the Marine service and never hired a man who didn't have a degree from one of the space schools. He must look at the boy's records as soon as he got a chance.  _The Hesperian Queen_ was not a small vessel. She was one of the newest, fastest, most fully automated models. Moreover, she was large and she glittered like a dwarf star. Lyddy would get a surprise when she came to see the ship.  Mattern greeted the crew member on watch and went up to his luxuriously appointed cabin--suite, really. Inside, a chessboard was set up, as its counterpart was set up in his hotel room, one side in the light from a porthole, the other in a corner full of shadows.  The pieces were not only in position, but a game had been started. Mattern sat down on the bright side and moved a piece.  \"Lyddy's aware of you,\" he told the shadows. \"She has no idea of what you are, of course. But she knows you're around, kqyres. She's half seen you and it's beginning to bother her. It's beginning to bother me, too.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Part of the shifting grayness flowed over the board. When it receded, a knight had changed its place. \"Truly, I have tried to be careful,\" a quiet, rather tired voice said out of a darkness at the heart of the shadows, an area that was tenuously substant. \"Is it certain that you yourself have not in some way given her cause for suspicion?\"  \"Quite certain. I've watched myself night and day.\" Mattern smiled ruefully. \"Which is damned hard when you're on your honeymoon.\"  \"Is there anyone else who might have spoken of these things to her?\" the kqyres asked.  \"No one.\" Then Mattern remembered the young spaceman he had met coming into the hotel, who seemed to have a look of Lyddy. But that was nonsensical. Looking _like_ her didn't mean talking _to_ her. In any case, what would Raines know that he could tell her? Silly to be so suspicious. The Golden Apple _was_ one of the few places in Erytheia City where one could get Earth smokesticks. \"No one,\" Mattern repeated. \"No one at all.\"  The patterns shifted and darkened. \"Then I must be getting careless. I am growing old.\"  \"Anyone can make a slip,\" Mattern said reassuringly. \"Just try to be a little more careful, that's all.\" He moved a rook.  The grayness crept out over the board, touched a bishop, hesitated, and moved to a pawn. _He is getting old_, Mattern thought pityingly, as he took the pawn. _Once I could never beat him. Now I win two games out of three._  \"But you are content with the woman?\" his partner asked anxiously. \"You are not disappointed with her in any way? She pleases you as much today as she did when first you set eyes on her?\"  \"Of course she does! You'd think it was you who'd been dreaming of her all these years, not me.\"  \"I suppose we shared those dreams....\"  \"And you'd never seen her.\" Mattern stared intently at the shadow. \"Are you disappointed, then?\"  \"Of course not. You know that to me a human woman is merely an object of art. And she _is_ very beautiful. But I thought she might not have come up to your expectations. Reality often falls short of dreams.\" The shadow's voice tautened. \"Has she changed much?\"  \"Very little,\" Mattern said, absorbed once more in the game. \"You'd think only a year or two had passed. Surprising how women do it.\"  The shadow sighed. \"Surprising,\" it agreed, its voice relaxing. \"But then the female sex is mysterious.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They played on a while in silence. The kqyres finally spoke. \"You will need a lot of money to provide an establishment fitting for so lovely a lady.\"  \"I have a lot of money,\" Mattern said. \"More than enough.\"  The kqyres flickered so violently that Mattern's eyes hurt. \"Not enough for the things she deserves to have. Jewels, palaces, planets....\"  \"One thing I know would make it a lot more comfortable for her,\" Mattern suggested. \"If only you didn't have to be close to me all the time, kqyres. If only you could stay on the ship even when I'm not there. Not that I don't enjoy your company,\" he added quickly, \"but she seems to be highly strung.\"  \"Do you think I like the situation any better than you? But this is the way the mbretersha has ordered it.\"  \"I suppose she knows what she's doing,\" Mattern sighed. In any case, the mbretersha's orders were absolute and could not be contravened--otherwise, at least one universe might be destroyed. There were still so many things he didn't understand and was not likely to learn.  \"Strange,\" he went on pensively, \"that Lyddy should have seen you, when I hardly can, and I _know_ you're here.\" He knew, too, that the kqyres was deliberately vibrating out of phase, so that the horror of his appearance in this continuum would be spared not only those he chanced to meet, but also himself. There was always the danger of passing a mirror. Knowing how the kqyres looked in his own universe, knowing how he himself looked in the kqyres' universe, Mattern didn't doubt that any revelation would be a frightful one. However, he couldn't help being curious.  \"I still think someone must have told her where to stare,\" the shadow said, \"and what for.\"  \"Don't be absurd!\" Mattern snapped, outraged at the idea that his carefully kept secret might not be a secret at all. \"Just try to be careful when she's around. Vibrate harder, or something.\"  \"I shall do my poor best.\" The shadowy one hesitated. \"Do you not think that if perhaps you were to tell her the truth--\"  \"Lord,"]]]
