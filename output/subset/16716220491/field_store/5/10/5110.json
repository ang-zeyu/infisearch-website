No accidental was like any other.  The self-deception was vicious precisely because the accidentals _were_ qualified. Of all the billions of solar citizens _they alone could make the long journey there and return_. But there were other factors that ruled them out. It was never safe to discuss the first reason with them because the second would have to be explained. Cameron himself wasn't sadistic and no one else was interested enough to inform them.     2   Docchi sat beside the pool. It would be pleasant if he could forget where he was. It was pastoral though not quite a scene from Earth. The horizon was too near and the sky was shallow and only seemed to be bright. Darkness lurked outside.  A small tree stretched shade overhead. Waves lapped and made gurgling sounds against the banks. But there was no plant life of any kind, and no fish swam in the liquid. It looked like water but wasn't--the pool held acid. And floating in it, all but submerged, was a shape. The records in the hospital said it was a woman.  \"Anti, they turned us down,\" said Docchi bitterly.  \"What did you expect?\" rumbled the creature in the pool. Wavelets of acid danced across the surface, stirred by her voice.  \"I didn't expect that.\"  \"You don't know the Medicouncil very well.\"  \"I guess I don't.\" He stared sullenly at the fluid. It was faintly blue. \"I have the feeling they didn't consider it, that they held the request for a time and then answered no without looking at it.\"  \"Now you're beginning to learn. Wait till you've been here as long as I have.\"  Morosely he kicked an anemic tuft of grass. Plants didn't do well here either. They too were exiled, far from the sun, removed from the soil they originated in. The conditions they grew in were artificial. \"Why did they turn us down?\" said Docchi.  \"Answer it yourself. Remember what the Medicouncil is like. Different things are important to them. The main thing is that we don't have to follow their example. There's no need to be irrational even though they are.\"  \"I wish I knew what to do,\" said Docchi. \"It meant so much to us.\"  \"We can wait, outlast the attitude,\" said Anti, moving slowly. It was the only way she could move. Most of her bulk was beneath the surface.  \"Cameron suggested waiting.\" Reflectively Docchi added: \"It's true we are biocompensators.\"  \"They always bring in biocompensation,\" muttered Anti restlessly. \"I'm getting tired of that excuse. Time passes just as slow.\"  \"But what else is there? Shall we draw up another request?\"  \"Memorandum number ten? Let's not be naive. Things get lost when we send them to the Medicouncil. Their filing system is in terrible shape.\"  \"Lost or distorted,\" grunted Docchi angrily. The grass he'd kicked already had begun to wilt. It wasn't hardy in this environment. Few things were.  \"Maybe we ought to give the Medicouncil a rest. I'm sure they don't want to hear from us again.\"  Docchi moved closer to the pool. \"Then you think we should go ahead with the plan we discussed before we sent in the petition? Good. I'll call the others together and tell them what happened. They'll agree that we have to do it.\"  \"Then why call them? More talk, that's all. Besides I don't see why we should warn Cameron what we're up to.\"  Docchi glanced at her worriedly. \"Do you think someone would report it? I'm certain everyone feels as I do.\"  \"Not everyone. There's bound to be dissent,\" said Anti placidly. \"But I wasn't thinking of people.\"  \"Oh that,\" said Docchi. \"We can block that source any time we need to.\" It was a relief to know that he could trust the accidentals. Unanimity was important and some of the reasons weren't obvious.  \"Maybe you can and maybe you can't,\" said Anti. \"But why make it difficult, why waste time?\"  Docchi got up awkwardly but he wasn't clumsy once he was on his feet. \"I'll get Jordan. I know I'll need arms.\"  \"Depends on what you mean,\" said Anti.  \"Both,\" said Docchi, smiling. \"We're a dangerous weapon.\"  She called out as he walked away. \"I'll see you when you leave for far Centauri.\"  \"Sooner than that, Anti. Much sooner.\"  Stars were beginning to wink. Twilight brought out the shadows and tracery of the structure that supported the transparent dome overhead. Soon controlled slow rotation would bring near darkness to this side of the asteroid. The sun was small at this distance but even so it was a tie to the familiar scenes of Earth. Before long it would be lost.         *       *       *       *       *  Cameron leaned back and looked speculatively at the gravity engineer, Vogel. The engineer could give him considerable assistance. There was no reason why he shouldn't but anyone who voluntarily had remained on the asteroid as long as Vogel was a doubtful quantity. He didn't distrust him, the man was strange.  \"I've been busy trying to keep the place running smoothly. I hope you don't mind that I haven't been able to discuss your job at length,\" said the doctor, watching him closely.  \"Naw, I don't mind,\" said Vogel. \"Medical directors come and go. I stay on. It's easier than getting another job.\"  \"I know. By now you should know the place pretty well. I sometimes think you could do my work with half the trouble.\"  \"Ain't in the least curious about medicine and never bothered to learn,\" grunted Vogel. \"I keep my stuff running and that's all. I don't interfere with nobody and they don't come around and get friendly with me.\"  Cameron believed it. The statement fit the personality. He needn't be concerned about fraternization. \"There are a few things that puzzle me,\" he began. \"That's why I called you in. Usually we maintain about half Earth-normal gravity. Is that correct?\"  The engineer nodded and grunted assent.  \"I'm not sure why half gravity is used. Perhaps it's easier on the weakened bodies of the accidentals. Or there may be economic factors. Either way it's not important as long as half gravity is what we get.\"  \"You want to know why we use that figure?\"  \"If you can tell me without getting too technical, yes. I feel I should learn everything I can about the place.\"  The engineer warmed up, seeming to enjoy himself. \"Ain't no reason except the gravity units themselves,\" Vogel said. \"Theoretically we can get anything we want. Practically we take whatever comes out, anything from a quarter to full Earth gravity.\"  \"You have no control over it?\" This contradicted what he'd heard. His information was that gravity generators were the product of an awesome bit of scientific development. It seemed inconceivable that they should be so haphazardly directed.  \"Sure we got control,\" answered the engineer, grinning. \"We can turn them off or on. If gravity varies, that's too bad. We take the fluctuation or we don't get anything.\"  Cameron frowned; the man knew what he was doing or he wouldn't be here. His position was of only slightly less importance than that of the medical director--and where it mattered the Medicouncil wouldn't tolerate incompetence. And yet----  The engineer rumbled on. \"You were talking how the generators were designed especially for the asteroid. Some fancy medical reason why it's easier on the accidentals to have a lesser gravity plus a certain amount of change. Me, I dunno. I guess the designers couldn't help what was built and the reason was dug up later.\"  Cameron concealed his irritation. He wanted information, not a heart to heart confession. Back on Earth he _had_ been told it was for the benefit of the accidentals. He'd reserved judgment then and saw no reason not to do so now. \"All practical sciences try to justify what they can't escape but would like to. Medicine, I'm sure, is no exception.\"  He paused thoughtfully. \"I understand there are three separate generators on the asteroid. One runs for forty-five minutes while two are idle. When the first one stops another one cuts in. The operations are supposed to be synchronized. I don't have to tell you that they're not. Not long ago you felt your weight increase suddenly. I know I did. What is wrong?\"  \"Nothing wrong,\" said the engineer soothingly. \"You get fluctuations while one generator is running. You get a gravity surge when one generator is supposed to drop out but doesn't. The companion machine adds to it, that's all.\"  \"They're supposed to be that way? Overlapping so that for a time we have Earth or Earth and a half gravity?\"  \"Better than having none,\" said Vogel with heavy pride. \"Used to happen quite often, before I came. You can ask any of the old timers. I fixed that though.\"  He didn't like the direction his questions were taking him. \"What did you do?\" he asked suspiciously.  \"Nothing,\" said the engineer uncomfortably. \"Nothing I can think of. I guess the machines just got used to having me around.\"  There were people who tended to anthropomorphize anything they came in contact with and Vogel was one of them. It made no difference to him that he was talking about insensate machines. He would continue to endow them with personality. \"This is the best you can say, that we'll get a wild variation of gravity, sometimes none?\"  \"It's not _supposed_ to work that way but nobody's ever done better with a setup like this,\" said Vogel defensively. \"If you want you can check the company that makes these units.\"  \"I'm not trying to challenge your knowledge and I'm not anxious to make myself look silly. I do want to make sure I don't overlook anything. You see, I think there's a possibility of sabotage.\"  The engineer's grin was wider than the remark required.  Cameron swiveled the chair around and leaned on the desk. \"All right,\" he said tiredly, \"tell me why the idea of sabotage is so funny.\"  \"It would have to be someone living here,\" said the big engineer. \"He wouldn't like it if it jumped up to nine G, which it could. I think he'd let it alone. But there are better reasons. Do you know how each gravity unit is put together?\"  \"Not in detail.\"  The gravity"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5075"],["title","The Lion of the North: A Tale of the Times of Gustavus Adolphus (#1)"],["body","will warrant me a draught of spiced wine will drive the cold of the Nith out of your bones.”  The travellers drank off the liquor.  “'Tis a famous drink,” Hume said, “and there is nowhere I enjoy it so much as in Scotland, for the cold here seems to have a knack of getting into one's very marrow, though I will say there have been times in the Low Countries when we have appreciated such a draught. Well, and how goes it with you, Graheme?”  “Things might be better; in fact, times in Scotland have been getting worse and worse ever since King James went to England, and all the court with him. If it were not for an occasional raid among the wild folks of Galloway, and a few quarrels among ourselves, life would be too dull to bear here.”  “But why bear it?” Captain Hume asked. “You used to have plenty of spirit in our old college days, Graheme, and I wonder at your rusting your life out here when there is a fair field and plenty of honour, to say nothing of hard cash, to be won in the Low Country. Why, beside Hepburn's regiment, which has made itself a name throughout all Europe, there are half a score of Scottish regiments in the service of the King of Sweden, and his gracious majesty Gustavus Adolphus does not keep them idle, I warrant you.”  “I have thought of going a dozen times,” Graheme said, “but you see circumstances have kept me back; but I have all along intended to cross the seas when Malcolm came of an age to take the charge of his father's lands. When my brother James was dying from that sword thrust he got in a fray with the Duffs, I promised him I would be a father to the boy, and see that he got his rights.”  “Well, we will talk of the affair after supper, Graheme, for now that I have got rid of the cold I begin to perceive that I am well nigh famished.”  As the officer was speaking, the servitors were laying the table, and supper was soon brought in. After ample justice had been done to this, and the board was again cleared, the three men drew their seats round the fire, Malcolm seating himself on a low stool by his uncle.  “And now to business, Nigel,” Colonel Munro said. “We have not come back to Scotland to see the country, or to enjoy your weather, or even for the pleasure of swimming your rivers in flood.  “We are commissioned by the King of Sweden to raise some 3000 or 4000 more Scottish troops. I believe that the king intends to take part in the war in Germany, where the Protestants are getting terribly mauled, and where, indeed, it is likely that the Reformed Religion will be stamped out altogether unless the Swedes strike in to their rescue. My chief object is to fill up to its full strength of two thousand men the Mackay Regiment, of which I am lieutenant colonel. The rest of the recruits whom we may get will go as drafts to fill up the vacancies in the other regiments. So you see here we are, and it is our intention to beat up all our friends and relations, and ask them each to raise a company or half a company of recruits, of which, of course, they would have the command.  “We landed at Berwick, and wrote to several of our friends that we were coming. Scott of Jedburgh has engaged to raise a company. Balfour of Lauderdale, who is a cousin of mine, has promised to bring another; they were both at St. Andrew's with us, as you may remember, Graheme. Young Hamilton, who had been an ensign in my regiment, left us on the way. He will raise a company in Douglasdale. Now, Graheme, don't you think you can bring us a band of the men of Nithsdale?”  “I don't know,” Graheme said hesitatingly. “I should like it of all things, for I am sick of doing nothing here, and my blood often runs hot when I read of the persecutions of the Protestants in Germany; but I don't think I can manage it.”  “Oh, nonsense, Nigel!” said Hume; “you can manage it easily enough if you have the will. Are you thinking of the lad there? Why not bring him with you? He is young, certainly, but he could carry a colour; and as for his spirit and bravery, Munro and I will vouch for it.”  “Oh, do, uncle,” the lad exclaimed, leaping to his feet in his excitement. “I promise you I would not give you any trouble; and as for marching, there isn't a man in Nithsdale who can tire me out across the mountains.”  “But what's to become of the house, Malcolm, and the land and the herds?”  “Oh, they will be all right,” the boy said. “Leave old Duncan in charge, and he will look after them.”  “But I had intended you to go to St. Andrews next year, Malcolm, and I think the best plan will be for you to go there at once. As you say, Duncan can look after the place.”  Malcolm's face fell.  “Take the lad with you, Graheme,” Colonel Munro said. “Three years under Gustavus will do him vastly more good than will St. Andrews. You know it never did us any good to speak of. We learned a little more Latin than we knew when we went there, but I don't know that that has been of any use to us; whereas for the dry tomes of divinity we waded through, I am happy to say that not a single word of the musty stuff remains in my brains. The boy will see life and service, he will have opportunities of distinguishing himself under the eye of the most chivalrous king in Europe, he will have entered a noble profession, and have a fair chance of bettering his fortune, all of which is a thousand times better than settling down here in this corner of Scotland.”  “I must think it over,” Graheme said; “it is a serious step to take. I had thought of his going to the court at London after he left the university, and of using our family interest to push his way there.”  “What is he to do in London?” Munro said. “The old pedant James, who wouldn't spend a shilling or raise a dozen men to aid the cause of his own daughter, and who thought more of musty dogmatic treatises than of the glory and credit of the country he ruled over, or the sufferings of his co-religionists in Germany, has left no career open to a lad of spirit.”  “Well, I will think it over by the morning,” Graheme said. “And now tell me a little more about the merits of this quarrel in Germany. If I am going to fight, I should like at least to know exactly what I am fighting about.”  “My dear fellow,” Hume laughed, “you will never make a soldier if you always want to know the ins and outs of every quarrel you have to fight about; but for once the tenderest conscience may be satisfied as to the justice of the contention. But Munro is much better versed in the history of the affair than I am; for, to tell you the truth, beyond the fact that it is a general row between the Protestants and Catholics, I have not troubled myself much in the matter.”  “You must know,” Colonel Munro began, “that some twenty years ago the Protestant princes of Germany formed a league for mutual protection and support, which they called the Protestant Union; and a year later the Catholics, on their side, constituted what they called the Holy League. At that time the condition of the Protestants was not unbearable. In Bohemia, where they constituted two-thirds of the population, Rudolph II, and after him Mathias, gave conditions of religious freedom.  “Gradually, however, the Catholic party about the emperor gained the upper hand; then various acts in breach of the conditions granted to the Protestants were committed, and public spirit on both sides became much embittered. On the 23d of May, 1618, the Estates of Bohemia met at Prague, and the Protestant nobles, headed by Count Thurn, came there armed, and demanded from the Imperial councillors an account of the high handed proceedings. A violent quarrel ensued, and finally the Protestant deputies seized the councillors Martinitz and Slavata, and their secretary, and hurled them from the window into the dry ditch, fifty feet below. Fortunately for the councillors the ditch contained a quantity of light rubbish, and they and their secretary escaped without serious damage. The incident, however, was the commencement of war. Bohemia was almost independent of Austria, administering its own internal affairs. The Estates invested Count Thurn with the command of the army. The Protestant Union supported Bohemia in its action. Mathias, who was himself a tolerant and well meaning man, tried to allay the storm; but, failing to do so, marched an army into Bohemia.  “Had Mathias lived matters would probably have arranged themselves, but he died the following spring, and was succeeded by Ferdinand II. Ferdinand is one of the most bigoted Catholics living, and is at the same time a bold and resolute man; and he had taken a solemn vow at the shrine of Loretto that, if ever he came to the throne, he would re-establish Catholicism throughout his dominions. Both parties prepared for the strife; the Bohemians renounced their allegiance to him and nominated the Elector Palatine Frederick V, the husband of our Scotch princess, their king.  “The first blow was struck at Zablati. There a Union army, led by Mansfeldt, was defeated by the Imperial general Bucquoi. A few days later, however, Count Thurn, marching through Moravia and Upper Austria, laid siege to Vienna. Ferdinand's own subjects were estranged from him, and the cry of the Protestant army, 'Equal rights for all Christian churches,' was approved by the whole population--for even in Austria itself there were a very large number of Protestants. Ferdinand had but a few soldiers, the population of the city were hostile, and had Thurn only entered the town he could have seized the emperor without any resistance.  “Thurn hesitated, and endeavoured instead to obtain the conditions of toleration which the Protestants required; and sixteen Austrian barons in the city were in the act of insisting upon Ferdinand signing these when the head of the relieving army entered the city. Thurn retired hastily. The Catholic princes and representatives met at Frankfort and elected Ferdinand Emperor of Germany. He at once entered into a strict agreement with Maximilian of Bavaria "]]]
