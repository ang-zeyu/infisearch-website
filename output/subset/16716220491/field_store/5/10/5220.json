It had apparently disappeared entirely, though the day seemed hardly dry enough for total evaporation. Then she saw it standing in a puddle by the wall fully ten feet away from the bowl. She made a quick deduction and frowned a bit worriedly.  \"I never realized the kitchen floor sloped _that_ much,\" she told Old Horsemeat after dinner. \"Maybe some beams need to be jacked up in the basement. I'd hate to think of collapsing into it while I cooked dinner.\"  \"I'm sure this house finished all its settling thirty years ago,\" her husband assured her hurriedly. \"That slope's always been there.\"  \"Well, if you say so,\" Kitty-Come-Here allowed doubtfully.  Next day she found Gummitch's bowl upset again and the remains of the boiled water in a puddle across the room. As she mopped it up, she began to do some thinking without benefit of Concentration Box.         *       *       *       *       *  That evening, after Old Horsemeat and Sissy had vehemently denied kicking into the water bowl or stepping on its edge, she voiced her conclusions. \"I think _Gummitch_ upsets it,\" she said. \"He's rejecting it. It still doesn't taste right to him and he wants to show us.\"  \"Maybe he only likes it after it's run across the floor and got seasoned with household dust and the corpses of germs,\" suggested Old Horsemeat, who believed most cats were bohemian types.  \"I'll have you know I _scrub_ that linoleum,\" Kitty-Come-Here asserted.  \"Well, with detergent and scouring powder, then,\" Old Horsemeat amended resourcefully.  Kitty-Come-Here made a scornful noise. \"I still want to know where he gets his liquids,\" she said. \"He's been off milk for weeks, you know, and he only drinks a little broth when I give him that. Yet he doesn't seem dehydrated. It's a real mystery and--\"  \"Maybe he's built a still in the attic,\" Old Horsemeat interjected.  \"--and I'm going to find the answers,\" Kitty-Come-Here concluded, ignoring the facetious interruption. \"I'm going to find out _where_ he gets the water he does drink and _why_ he rejects the water I give him. This time I'm going to boil it and put in a pinch of salt. Just a pinch.\"  \"You make animals sound more delicate about food and drink than humans,\" Old Horsemeat observed.  \"They probably are,\" his wife countered. \"For one thing they don't smoke, or drink Martinis. It's my firm belief that animals--cats, anyway--like good food just as much as we do. And the same sort of good food. They don't enjoy canned catfood any more than we would, though they _can_ eat it. Just as we could if we had to. I really don't think Gummitch would have such a passion for raw horsemeat except you started him on it so early.\"  \"He probably thinks of it as steak tartare,\" Old Horsemeat said.  Next day Kitty-Come-Here found her salted offering upset just as the two previous bowls had been.         *       *       *       *       *  Such were the beginnings of the Great Spilled Water Mystery that preoccupied the human members of the Gummitch household for weeks. Not every day, but frequently, and sometimes two and three times a day, Gummitch's little bowl was upset. No one ever saw the young cat do it. But it was generally accepted that he was responsible, though for a time Old Horsemeat had theories that he did not voice involving Sissy and Baby.  Kitty-Come-Here bought Gummitch a firm-footed rubber bowl for his water, though she hesitated over the purchase for some time, certain he would be able to taste the rubber. This bowl was found upset just like his regular china one and like the tin one she briefly revived from his kitten days.  All sorts of clues and possibly related circumstances were seized upon and dissected. For instance, after about a month of the mysterious spillings, Kitty-Come-Here announced, \"I've been thinking back and as far as I can remember it never happens except on sunny days.\"  \"Oh, Good Lord!\" Old Horsemeat reacted.  Meanwhile Kitty-Come-Here continued to try to concoct a kind of water that would be palatable to Gummitch. As she continued without success, her formulas became more fantastic. She quit boiling it for the most part but added a pinch of sugar, a spoonful of beer, a few flakes of oregano, a green leaf, a violet, a drop of vanilla extract, a drop of iodine....  \"No wonder he rejects the stuff,\" Old Horsemeat was tempted to say, but didn't.  Finally Kitty-Come-Here, inspired by the sight of a greenly glittering rack of it at the supermarket, purchased a half gallon of bottled water from a famous spring. She wondered why she hadn't thought of this step earlier--it certainly ought to take care of her haunting convictions about the unpalatableness of chlorine or fluorides. (She herself could distinctly taste the fluorides in the tap water, though she never mentioned this to Old Horsemeat.)  One other development during the Great Spilled Water Mystery was that Gummitch gradually emerged from depression and became quite gay. He took to dancing cat schottisches and gigues impromptu in the living room of an evening and so forgot his dignity as to battle joyously with the vacuum-cleaner dragon when Old Horsemeat used one of the smaller attachments to curry him; the young cat clutched the hairy round brush to his stomach and madly clawed it as it _whuffled_ menacingly. Even the afternoon he came home with a shoulder gashed by the Mad Eunuch he seemed strangely light-hearted and debonair.         *       *       *       *       *  The Mystery was abruptly solved one sunny Sunday afternoon. Going into the bathroom in her stocking feet, Kitty-Come-Here saw Gummitch apparently trying to drown himself in the toilet. His hindquarters were on the seat but the rest of his body went down into the bowl. Coming closer, she saw that his forelegs were braced against the opposite side of the bowl, just above the water surface, while his head thrust down sharply between his shoulders. She could distinctly hear rhythmic lapping.  To tell the truth, Kitty-Come-Here was rather shocked. She had certain rather fixed ideas about the delicacy of cats. It speaks well for her progressive grounding that she did not shout at Gummitch but softly summoned her husband.  By the time Old Horsemeat arrived the young cat had refreshed himself and was coming out of his \"well\" with a sudden backward undulation. He passed them in the doorway with a single mew and upward look and then made off for the kitchen.  The blue and white room was bright with sunlight. Outside the sky was blue and the leaves were rustling in a stiff breeze. Gummitch looked back once, as if to make sure his human congeners had followed, mewed again, and then advanced briskly toward his little bowl with the air of one who proposes to reveal all mysteries at once.  Kitty-Come-Here had almost outdone herself. She had for the first time poured him the bottled water, and she had floated a few rose petals on the surface.  Gummitch regarded them carefully, sniffed at them, and then proceeded to fish them out one by one and shake them off his paw. Old Horsemeat repressed the urge to say, \"I told you so.\"  When the water surface was completely free and winking in the sunlight, Gummitch curved one paw under the side of the bowl and jerked.  Half the water spilled out, gathered itself, and then began to flow across the floor in little rushes, a silver ribbon sparkling with sunlight that divided and subdivided and reunited as it followed the slope. Gummitch crouched to one side, watching it intensely, following its progress inch by inch and foot by foot, almost pouncing on the little temporary pools that formed, but not quite touching them. Twice he mewed faintly in excitement.         *       *       *       *       *  \"He's _playing_ with it,\" Old Horsemeat said incredulously.  \"No,\" Kitty-Come-Here countered wide-eyed, \"he's _creating_ something. Silver mice. Water-snakes. Twinkling vines.\"  \"Good Lord, you're right,\" Old Horsemeat agreed. \"It's a new art form. Would you call it water painting? Or water sculpture? Somehow I think that's best. As if a sculptor made mobiles out of molten tin.\"  \"It's gone so quickly, though,\" Kitty-Come-Here objected, a little sadly. \"Art ought to last. Look, it's almost all flowed over to the wall now.\"  \"Some of the best art forms are completely fugitive,\" Old Horsemeat argued. \"What about improvisation in music and dancing? What about jam sessions and shadow figures on the wall? Gummitch can always do it again--in fact, he must have been doing it again and again this last month. It's never exactly the same, like waves or fires. But it's beautiful.\"  \"I suppose so,\" Kitty-Come-Here said. Then coming to herself, she continued, \"But I don't think it can be healthy for him to go on drinking water out of the toilet. Really.\"  Old Horsemeat shrugged. He had an insight about the artistic temperament and the need to dig for inspiration into the smelly fundamentals of life, but it was difficult to express delicately.  Kitty-Come-Here sighed, as if bidding farewell to all her efforts with rose petals and crystalline bottled purity and vanilla extract and the soda water which had amazed Gummitch by faintly spitting and purring at him.  \"Oh, well,\" she said, \"I can scrub it out more often, I suppose.\"  Meanwhile, Gummitch had gone back to his bowl and, using both paws, overset it completely. Now, nose a-twitch, he once more pursued the silver streams alive with suns, refreshing his spirit with the sight of them. He was fretted by no problems about what he was doing. He had solved them all with one of his characteristically sharp distinctions: there was the _sacred_ water, the sparklingly clear water to create with, and there was the water with character, the water to _drink_."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51499"],["title","Blueblood (#1)"],["body"," of fruit.  Ellik kicked the Indigo. \"It's overripe, blockhead. _Amum, amum._\"  The Indigo backed out, bowing, eyes very round.  Ellik felt me looking at him.  \"Well, I don't _like_ kicking the oaf, but that's all he's been conditioned to understand as a sign of disapproval.\"  \"Sure,\" I said.  Ellik passed through the scimitar of gray shadow into the sunlight that washed lines and years out of his face. He braced a hand against the doorframe and craned his head back. It stopped and steadied.  \"He's still there,\" Ellik said. \"Sometimes I wish his orbit would decay enough to burn him up in this damned sour air.\" He coughed into his fist.  \"He could probably correct,\" I suggested.  Ellik sneered. \"He hasn't got the brains.\"  \"Pretty hard for one man to manage a takeoff. He was lucky to make it into orbit.\"  \"I just wish he would come down. Somehow, someway, I'd get to him, no matter where he went on this planet.\"  \"I suppose that's why he stays up.\"  Ellik slammed his fist into his palm. \"I'm going to call him again. He can't get away without us. If he fouled up a takeoff that badly, he's not going to try to solo into hyperspace.\"  \"I don't think anyone would solo into hyperspace. I don't think he would be able to come back.\"  \"Oh, what do you know about it?\" Ellik said shortly. \"He's just building up his courage to try the big jump. He's yellow, sure, but sooner or later he'll get desperate enough, or scared enough, to actually go. Then we'll be stranded for fair. This planet may not be colonized for centuries!\"  \"Probably never,\" I said. \"Not after Lee's reports.\"  \"You think he would falsify reports?\" Ellik asked, blinking at me.  \"I suppose he'll have to.\"  Ellik held his head with his hands. \"Of course, of course. There's no limit to the depths to which he would plummet.\" He ran over to the corner and snatched a communicator off the pile of our gear. \"I'm going to call him and tell him what I think of him and his wild obsession.\"  I didn't remind Ellik that he had been telling Chon just that at least once a day for a month. I knew his nerves got tighter and tighter and cussing out Chon helped release them and make him feel better.  \"Come down, Lee!\" Ellik called. \"The three of us can make the jump together. You're martyring yourself for a crazy reason!\"  \"We've talked this over before,\" Chon answered. \"This is the last time I'm going to respond to your call. I've made it clear to you that I think knowledge of this world will cause great suffering, a lot of death, among the majority of Earth's people.\"  \"You're talking prejudice, Lee! _Your_ prejudice. People aren't like that any more.\"  \"We haven't gone _that_ far, Mike. The bigots, the hatemongers, the pettiness and xenophobia lurking in everybody haven't been asleep that long. Just look at it from _my_ side, Mike. What will the white people of Earth think about the Orientals, Negroes and Indians of Earth when they find out the dark-skinned humanoids of another planet are--measurably, unquestionably, vastly--_inferior_ to the light-skinned race of the same world? I ask you, Mike!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mike Ellik said, \"It's an inept analogy, Lee, and you know it.\"  \"But most people reason by analogy,\" said Lee Chon. \"No, Mike. I have to leave you and Johnny to prevent a recurrence of racial hatred, intolerance and all the ugly consequences on both sides. This is the last time I'll answer you, Mike. I'm getting lonesome. In a few years, I'll get hungry for human companionship. I don't want to be tempted down. Good-by, Johnny. So long, Mike.\"  Ellik screamed. \"Wait! Answer one more call, Lee. It's the least you can do for me. I don't know when I'll make it. It may be in a few weeks or a few years. It won't be just argument, Lee. I'll have something you'll _want_ to tell Earth about this place and these people.\"  \"I'm still here. Tell it to me now,\" Chon's voice said.  \"No. I want to get proof. Let me rig up some kind of video circuit for you. I can use parts out of our tape camera and the translators. I want to get it all across to you.\"  I could hear Chon breathing. \"Very well. I'll answer your next call.\"  \"Lee,\" I called out, \"Mike and me will be expecting you to answer.\"  Chon laughed. \"I'm not going anywhere, Johnny. Only around this world every couple of hours.\"  \"You couldn't make the jump through hyperspace without us, Lee,\" Ellik said.  \"That's right, Mike. I'm--I'm sorry to quarantine you two down there.\"  \"_Quarantine!_\" Ellik stormed. \"_We're_ not sick, Lee. _You_ are the sick one!\"  There wasn't any sound, not even of breathing.  \"You have an idea to change Lee's mind, Mike?\" I asked.  He cupped his hand on the back of my neck. \"Affirmative, Jonathan. A pretty damned good one, too.\"  Ellik stood staring out the door, gnawing on one of his knuckles, letting the sun turn the front of him into gold, so he looked like half a statue, and half a man.  \"I suppose it had to come out in him sooner or later,\" he said.  \"What, Mike?\"  \"What could we expect? It's the basic quality of treachery in the Oriental mind.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When the shadows were at their longest and the alien sun was down the closest to the horizon without actually going under, Ellik marched up the path shoving a new Indigo. The Azures supplied Mike with all the flunkies he wanted to gather food and the like for him, as his natural right. But I thought we had enough of them hanging around our quarters. I couldn't imagine what he would want with another one.  The alien hovered at the door. Ellik kicked him in the calf to make him understand he was to go inside.  \"Look at him, Johnny,\" Ellik said, pushing the fellow forward. \"Not a mongoloid, would you say?\"  \"No.\"  The alien looked stupid--blue and stupid. His face was hanging there, but it wasn't pushed out of shape any more than the faces of the Azures. The Indigo blinked back at me. What he also looked was not friendly.  Ellik took the Indigo's cheeks in his hand and angled the face toward the light. \"He's a half-breed, Johnny, or otherwise the gene was recessive. He wasn't damaged before birth, only after--when he started to breathe.\"  \"What do you mean, Mike?\"  \"You ever hear of cyanosis, Johnny?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well, these creatures have something like it. The Indigos don't get enough oxygen in their blood cells. It makes them sluggish; it turns them blue like the pictures of 'blue babies' in the old books.\"  \"I never saw a picture like that in an old book,\" I said.  \"Did you ever _see_ a book? Sorry, Johnny. Just kidding.\" Ellik rubbed his hands together. \"Well! I theorized that there is no basic difference in the Azures and the Indigos except improper aeration of their blood. So, you see, an Indigo is only a _sick_ Azure, and I am going to make this Indigo _well_.\"  \"How can you do that?\"  \"It's simple,\" Mike said irritably. \"The Indigos must have a malformation of the heart causing an abnormal communication between the venous and arterial side of the circulation system. A little surgery and I adjust a valve in the heart. No more communication. Proper aeration. Enough oxygen. The deep blue color goes, leaving only the lighter blue of the natural pigmentation. The patient feels better, acts better, thinks better, looks better. In short, he is no longer an Indigo but an Azure.\"  \"Is--is this what you're going to show Lee?\" I ventured.  \"Of course! It proves the Indigos _aren't_ an inferior race. They are the same as the Azures except that they are sick. Their being sick can't reflect unfavourably on any terrestrial colored race. There is no analogy. But I have to prove it to Chon. We're going to tape the whole process and feed it to him.\"  \"I think,\" I said, \"that that might get to him.\"  \"Sure it will.\" Ellik's jaw muscles flexed. \"I should ruin Lee with this thing, but I won't. I'm not a vindictive man. Lee and I will probably be working together for years. But whenever he gets out of line--has some stubborn idea about doing something his way--don't think I won't remind him of this!\"  Suddenly, he was smiling again. He turned to the gawking Indigo. He pointed two fingers at him.  \"_Mmr?_\" Ellik asked.  The alien tapped himself on his chest cavity twice. \"_Mhaw_,\" he gave his name.  \"_Mhaw M'i uh M'i m M'm'-uh?_\" Ellik asked him, without even using the translators.  \"_M-m-M-m-M_,\" the alien went, slapping himself on the chest with his opened palms.  Ellik turned to me, grinning. \"I asked him if he wanted to stop being an Indigo and become an Azure. He thinks I can do anything and he's all for it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  After we fed Mhaw a dose of null-shock from our packs, Doc Ellik started to slice him open with a ceramic knife he had borrowed from the Azures.  But Ellik had forgotten that the alien might get frightened seeing himself cut open, even if he couldn't feel any pain. It had never happened to him before.  The alien lumbered to his feet, his chest hanging open, showing his heart beating like some animal caught inside a blueberry pudding.  I drove a right cross into his jaw, and felt the jar all the way up to my shoulder.  He melted back down onto the pallet.  \"Good work, Johnny,\" Ellik said, stooping and starting his work.  Right away, Mhaw started to lose that Indigo color and get real light--lighter than the Azures, in fact. None of the blue of the race was actually in the pigmentation, Mike found out. Even the Azures suffered some degree of improper aeration of the blood.  \"You going to call Lee Chon now?\" I asked Mike. \"You going to show him the tape we had running during the operation and all?\"  \"Not quite yet, Johnny,\" he said. \"First I want to educate Mhaw a bit, up to the Azure level or better. That should convince Lee.\"  Mhaw learned fast, probably faster than the Azures, even. Almost the first thing he wanted was for us to stop calling him Mhaw and start using an Azure name, Aedo.  Once a day, Ellik left our hut to take some exercise--a walk"]]]
