There wasn't any feeling of motion or speed, but I felt a fresh breeze on my face and when I opened my eyes I was standing beside a familiar stone fence on a hill above the house where I was born. You haven't told me, but the others came back, too, didn't they?\"  \"All but Ragan,\" Erwin said. His tone made Costain think wryly, _Even the military can snatch at straws_. \"Maxon and Vaughn called in. But we haven't heard from Ragan.\"  \"He wasn't left behind,\" Walraven said with certainty. \"Ragan has no family, but he has a home. We're standing on it.\"  An orderly came in with an envelope for Costain, who opened it and handed the paper to Erwin. To Walraven, Costain said, \"It's a cablegram from North Ireland. Ragan is back.\"  Erwin was still gripping the paper in his hand when he walked with Costain out of the hospital into the bright airiness of a spring day. He glared at the warm, blue sky.  \"We'll find a way,\" Erwin said. \"We've proved that we can put men on Mars. With the right conditioning, we can keep them there.\"  \"You're a dedicated and resolute man, Coordinator,\" Costain said. \"Do you really suppose that any amount of conditioning could fit you to do what those boys failed at?\"  The long moment of considering that passed before Erwin answered left a fine sheen of sweat on his face.  \"No,\" Erwin said."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51519"],["title","The Drug (#1)"],["body","and he expressed himself pungently on Wednesday night bridge, after a nightclub party on Tuesday and a formless affair at somebody's house on Monday.  She stared at him without compassion or comprehension. \"Well, they're all business associates of yours. I wonder where you think you'd be without a wife who was willing to entertain.\"  He'd been getting a lot of that lately; she was squeezing the role of Executive's Wife for the last drop of satisfaction. Well, since he couldn't relax with his indigestion there was only one thing to do. He headed for the bar.  \"Now don't get tipsy before dinner,\" she called after him.  He got through the evening well enough, doused with martinis, and the night that followed was no worse than most.         *       *       *       *       *  At nine the next morning, the call he'd been expecting from Buffalo came through. \"Hello, Stu,\" he said to the president of the company.  \"Hello, Amos. Still morning out there, eh? How's the family? Good. Say, Amos; couple of things. This big factory charge. Production's screaming.\"  \"It was definitely a bad batch, Stu.\"  \"Well, that's it, then. Question is, how'd it happen?\"  \"Jim Glover says he needs another control chemist.\"  \"Hope you're not practicing false economy out there.\"  \"We wanted to hire another man, Stu, but Buffalo turned it down.\"  \"You should have brought it to me personally if it was that important. It's going to take a big bite out of your year's profit. Been able to get your margin up any?\"  Amos didn't feel up to pointing out that Sales wanted lower prices and the union wanted higher wages, so that the margin would get even worse. He described a couple of minor economies he'd been able to find, then mentioned the contract with the Peach Association.  \"Yes, I heard about that,\" said the president of the company. \"Nice piece of business. By the way, how you coming on that animal hormone?\"  That was the main reason for the call, of course. Detrick had undoubtedly phoned east and intimated that Amos was dragging his feet on a potential bonanza. \"I was going to call you on that, Stu. It'll take a year to test and get registered and--\"  \"Amos, I hope you're not turning conservative on us.\"  The message was plain; Amos countered automatically. \"You know me better than that, Stu. It's the Legal Department I'm worried about. If they set up a lot of roadblocks, we may need you to run interference.\"  \"You know I'm always right behind you, Amos.\"  That's true, thought Amos as he hung up. Right behind me. A hell of a place to run interference.  He knew exactly what to expect. If he tried to cut corners, the Legal Department would scream about proper testing and registration, Production would say he was pushing Jim Glover unreasonably, and everyone who could would assume highly moral positions astraddle the fence. A ton of paperwork would go to Buffalo to be distributed among fifty desks and expertly stalled.  Not to mention that this was no ordinary product. He realized for the first time that the Government might not let him produce it, let alone sell it. Even as a minute percentage in feeds. If it was a narcotic, it could be misused.         *       *       *       *       *  His buzzer sounded, and he was surprised when Mrs. Grant announced Frank Barnes. It was out of character for Frank not to make a formal appointment first.  One look told Amos what was coming. He listened to Frank's resignation with a fraction of his mind while the rest of it mused upon the purposeful way things were converging.  Barnes stopped talking and Amos said mechanically, \"You've been part of the team for a long time, Frank. It's especially awkward to lose you just now.\" It was banal, but it didn't matter; he wasn't going to change the man's mind anyway. He looked closer. The timidity was gone. So were the eyeglasses. A frightening thought struck him. \"You've taken some of that drug.\"  Barnes grinned and handed a small vial full of powder across the desk, along with a file folder. \"Last night,\" he said. \"Between frustration with the job and curiosity about this stuff, I yielded to temptation.\"  Amos took the vial and folder. \"What are these for?\"  \"So you can destroy them if you want to. I've doctored up the lab records to make the whole thing look like a false alarm. You're holding all that's left of the whole program.\"  Amos looked for signs of irrationality and saw none. \"Do you feel all right?\"  \"Better than you can imagine. But let me tell you what you're up against. I can at least do that for you, Mr. Parry.\"  \"Thanks. Don't you suppose you could call me Amos now?\"  \"Sure, Amos. First of all, you were right about that pig trying to imitate the cat. He couldn't do much because he only had a pig's brain to work with.\" He stopped and grinned, evidently at Amos' expression. \"I'll try to explain. What is an animal? Physically, I mean?\"  Amos shook his head. \"You've got the floor.\"  \"All right. An animal is a colony of cells. Different kinds of cells form organs and do different things for the colony, but each cell has a life of its own, too. When it dies a new one of the same kind takes over. But what regulates the colony? What maintains the pattern?\"  Amos waited.  \"Part of it's automatic replacement, cell for cell. But beyond that there's a control; and it's the unconscious mind.\" He paused and studied Amos. \"You think I'm theorizing. I'm not. That drug broke down some barriers, and I see all this as you see your own fingers moving.\"  Amos remembered the mention of hallucinations.         *       *       *       *       *  Barnes grinned again. \"Let's say it's only one per cent awake and walled off from the conscious mind. What would happen if something removed the wall and woke up the other ninety-nine per cent?\"  Remembering the pig, it was impossible not to feel a cold seed of belief. Amos dreaded what was coming next; clearly, it would be a demonstration.  Barnes held out his hand, palm up. In a few seconds a pink spot appeared. It turned red, oozed dismayingly, and became a small pool of blood. Barnes let it stay for a moment, then wiped it off with a handkerchief. There was no more bleeding. \"That's something I can do fast,\" he said. \"I opened the pores, directed blood to them, then closed them again. Amos, do you believe in werewolves?\"  Amos wanted to jump up and shout, \"No! You're insane!\" but he could only sit staring.  \"I could move that thumb around to the other side of my hand,\" Barnes said thoughtfully. \"I'm still exploring, but I don't think even the bone would take too long. You'll notice I don't need glasses any more.\"  The buzzer buzzed. Amos jumped, and from habit answered. \"Bill Detrick and that customer are here, Mr. Parry,\" came Alice Grant's voice.  \"I--ask them to wait,\" he managed.  His mind was a muddle; he needed time. \"You--Frank--will you stay for a few days?\"  \"Sure. I'm in no hurry now. And while you're thinking, let me give you a few hints. No more cripples or disease. No ugly people, unless they choose to be. And no law.\"  \"No--law?\"  \"How would you police such a world? A man could change his face at will, or his fingerprints. Even his teeth. Probably he could do things I can't imagine yet.\"  The buzzer went again, with Mrs. Grant's subtle urgency. Amos ignored it, yet he hardly knew when Frank left the room.  He realized the chemist had done him a favor. The selfish thing would have been to keep the secret and the boon all to himself; instead, he'd given Amos the choice.  But what was the choice? Suppressing the drug would cost him his job. There was no doubt about that.  He was standing with his back to the door when he heard it open. He turned and faced Detrick's annoyed frown. \"Amos, we can't keep this man waiting. He's--\"  All of Amos' frustration and the new burden coalesced into rage. He ran toward Detrick. \"You baboon-faced huckster!\" he yelled. \"Get out! Get out! I'll tell you when you can come in here!\" He barely caught his upraised fist in time.  Detrick stood petrified, his face ludicrous. Then he came to life, ducked out, and pulled the door shut behind him.  Amos waited no longer; if he had to decide, he wanted the data first-hand. He spread out the file Barnes had left him and looked through it for dosages. Apparently it wasn't critical, so he poured a little of the powder into a tumbler, added water and threw it down. There was a mild alkaline taste, which he washed out of his mouth with more water. Then he sat down to wait.         *       *       *       *       *  A monotone seemed to be rattling off trivia; almost faster than he could grasp it, even though it was in his head and not in his ears: \"Paris green/calcium acetoarsenite/beetle invasion Texan cotton/paint pigment/obsolete/should eliminate/compensation claim/man probably faking infection/Detrick likes because we only source/felt like hitting him when we argued about it/correspondence Buffalo last year/they say keep/check how use as poison/damned wife--\"  The last thought shocked his intellect awake. \"Hey!\" Intellect demanded. \"What's going on here?\"  \"Oh; you've broken through,\" said Unconscious. \"That was fast. Fifteen minutes and twenty-three seconds since you drank it. Probable error, one-third second. I've only been awake a few minutes myself. Minute/sixty per hour/twenty-four hours day/days getting shorter/September/have raincoat in car/wife wants new car/raincoat sweats plasticizer/stinks/Hyatt used camphor--\"  \"Hold up a minute!\" cried Intellect.  \"You want me to stop scanning?\"  \"Is that what you're doing? Scanning what?\"  \"Memory banks, of course. Don't you remember the book we read three years ago? 'Human brain estimated--' Oh, all right; I'll slow down. You could follow me better if you'd let me grow some permanent direct connections.\"  \"Am I stopping you?\"  \"Well, not you, exactly. I'll show you.\" Unconscious began directing the growth of certain nerve tendrils in the brain. Amos could only follow it vaguely.  \"Fear!\""]]]
