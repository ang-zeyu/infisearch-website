Barbo gasped. This particular kind of courage was wholly beyond him.  Half an hour later Eliphalet carried his carpet-bag up three flights and put it down in a tiny bedroom under the eaves, still pulsing with heat waves. Here he was to live, and eat at Miss Crane's table for the consideration of four dollars a week.  Such is the story of the humble beginning of one substantial prop of the American Nation. And what a hackneyed story it is! How many other young men from the East have travelled across the mountains and floated down the rivers to enter those strange cities of the West, the growth of which was like Jonah's gourd.  Two centuries before, when Charles Stuart walked out of a window in Whitehall Palace to die; when the great English race was in the throes of a Civil War; when the Stern and the Gay slew each other at Naseby and Marston Moor, two currents flowed across the Atlantic to the New World. Then the Stern men found the stern climate, and the Gay found the smiling climate.  After many years the streams began to move again, westward, ever westward. Over the ever blue mountains from the wonderland of Virginia into the greater wonderland of Kentucky. And through the marvels of the Inland Seas, and by white conestogas threading flat forests and floating over wide prairies, until the two tides met in a maelstrom as fierce as any in the great tawny torrent of the strange Father of Waters. A city founded by Pierre Laclede, a certain adventurous subject of Louis who dealt in furs, and who knew not Marly or Versailles, was to be the place of the mingling of the tides. After cycles of separation, Puritan and Cavalier united on this clay-bank in the Louisiana Purchase, and swept westward together--like the struggle of two great rivers when they meet the waters for a while were dangerous.  So Eliphalet was established, among the Puritans, at Miss Crane's. The dishes were to his taste. Brown bread and beans and pies were plentiful, for it was a land of plenty. All kinds of Puritans were there, and they attended Mr. Davitt's Congregational Church. And may it be added in justice to Mr. Hopper, that he became not the least devout of the boarders.     CHAPTER. II  THE MOLE  For some years, while Stephen A. Douglas and Franklin Pierce and other gentlemen of prominence were playing at bowls on the United States of America; while Kansas was furnishing excitement free of charge to any citizen who loved sport, Mr. Eliphalet Hopper was at work like the industrious mole, underground. It is safe to affirm that Colonel Carvel forgot his new hand as soon as he had turned him over to Mr. Hood, the manager. As for Mr. Hopper, he was content. We can ill afford to dissect motives. Genius is willing to lay the foundations of her structure unobserved.  At first it was Mr. Barbo alone who perceived Eliphalet's greatness,--Mr. Barbo, whose opinions were so easily had that they counted for nothing. The other clerks, to say the least, found the newcomer uncompanionable. He had no time for skylarking, the heat of the day meant nothing to him, and he was never sleepy. He learned the stock as if by intuition, and such was his strict attention to business that Mr. Hood was heard is say, privately, he did not like the looks of it. A young man should have other interests. And then, although he would not hold it against him, he had heard that Mr. Hopper was a teacher in Mr. Davitt's Sunday School.  Because he did not discuss his ambitions at dinner with the other clerks in the side entry, it must not be thought that Eliphalet was without other interests. He was likewise too shrewd to be dragged into political discussions at the boarding-house table. He listened imperturbably to the outbursts against the Border Ruffian, and smiled when Mr. Abner Reed, in an angry passion, asked him to declare whether or not he was a friend of the Divine Institution. After a while they forgot about him (all save Miss Crane), which was what Mr. Hopper of all things desired.  One other friend besides Miss Crane did Eliphalet take unto himself, wherein he showed much discrimination. This friend was none other than Mr. Davitt, minister for many years of the Congregational Church. For Mr. Davitt was a good man, zealous in his work, unpretentious, and kindly. More than once Eliphalet went to his home to tea, and was pressed to talk about himself and his home life. The minister and his wife ware invariably astonished, after their guest was gone, at the meagre result of their inquiries.  If Love had ever entered such a discreet soul as that into which we are prying, he used a back entrance. Even Mr. Barbo's inquiries failed in the discovery of any young person with whom Eliphalet \"kept company.\" Whatever the notions abroad concerning him, he was admittedly a model. There are many kinds of models. With some young ladies at the Sunday School, indeed, he had a distant bowing acquaintance. They spoke of him as the young man who knew the Bible as thoroughly as Mr. Davitt himself. The only time that Mr. Hopper was discovered showing embarrassment was when Mr. Davitt held his hand before them longer than necessary on the church steps. Mr. Hopper was not sentimental.  However fascinating the subject, I do not propose to make a whole book about Eliphalet. Yet sidelights on the life of every great man are interesting. And there are a few incidents in his early career which have not gotten into the subscription biographical Encyclopaedias. In several of these volumes, to be sure, we may see steel engravings of him, true likenesses all. His was the type of face which is the glory of the steel engraving,--square and solid, as a corner-stone should be. The very clothes he wore were made for the steel engraving, stiff and wiry in texture, with sharp angles at the shoulders, and sombre in hue, as befit such grave creations.  Let us go back to a certain fine morning in the September of the year 1857, when Mr. Hopper had arrived, all unnoticed, at the age of two and thirty. Industry had told. He was now the manager's assistant; and, be it said in passing, knew more about the stock than Mr. Hood himself. On this particular morning, about nine o'clock, he was stacking bolts of woollen goods near that delectable counter where the Colonel was wont to regale his principal customers, when a vision appeared in the door. Visions were rare at Carvel & Company's. This one was followed by an old negress with leathery wrinkles, whose smile was joy incarnate. They entered the store, paused at the entrance to the Colonel's private office, and surveyed it with dismay.  \"Clar t' goodness, Miss Jinny, yo' pa ain't heah! An' whah's Ephum, dat black good-fo'-nuthin'!\"  Miracle number one,--Mr. Hopper stopped work and stared. The vision was searching the store with her eyes, and pouting.  \"How mean of Pa!\" she exclaimed, \"when I took all this trouble to surprise him, not to be here! Where are they all? Where's Ephum? Where's Mr. Hood?\"  The eyes lighted on Eliphalet. His blood was sluggish, but it could be made to beat faster. The ladies he had met at Miss Crane's were not of this description. As he came forward, embarrassment made him shamble, and for the first time in his life he was angrily conscious of a poor figure. Her first question dashed out the spark of his zeal.  \"Oh,\" said she, \"are you employed here?\"  Thoughtless Virginia! You little know the man you have insulted by your haughty drawl.  \"Yes.\"  Then find Mr. Carvel, won't you, please? And tell him that his daughter has come from Kentucky, and is waiting for him.\"  \"I callate Mr. Carvel won't be here this morning,\" said Eliphalet. He went back to the pile of dry goods, and began to work. But he was unable to meet the displeasure in her face.  \"What is your name?\" Miss Carvel demanded.  \"Hopper.\"  \"Then, Mr. Hopper, please find Ephum, or Mr. Hood.\"  Two more bolts were taken off the truck. Out of the corner of his eye he watched her, and she seemed very tall, like her father. She was taller than he, in fact.  \"I ain't a servant, Miss Carvel,\" he said, with a meaning glance at the negress.  \"Laws, Miss Jinny,\" cried she, \"I may's 'ell find Ephum. I knows he's loafin' somewhar hereabouts. An' I ain't seed him dese five month.\" And she started for the back of the store.  \"Mammy!\"  The old woman stopped short. Eliphalet, electrified, looked up and instantly down again.  \"You say you are employed by Mr. Carvel, and refuse to do what I ask?\"  \"I ain't a servant,\" Mr. Hopper repeated doggedly. He felt that he was in the right,--and perhaps he was.  It was at this critical juncture in the proceedings that a young man stepped lightly into the store behind Miss Jinny. Mr. Hopper's eye was on him, and had taken in the details of his costume before realizing the import of his presence. He was perhaps twenty, and wore a coat that sprung in at the waist, and trousers of a light buff-color that gathered at the ankle and were very copious above. His features were of the straight type which has been called from time immemorial patrician. He had dark hair which escaped in waves from under his hat, and black eyes that snapped when they perceived Miss Virginia Carvel. At sight of her, indeed, the gold-headed cane stopped in its gyrations in midair.  \"Why, Jinny!\" he cried--\"Jinny!\"  Mr. Hopper would have sold his soul to have been in the young man's polished boots, to have worn his clothes, and to have been able to cry out to the young lady, \"Why, Jinny!\"  To Mr. Hopper's surprise, the young lady did not turn around. She stood perfectly still. But a red flush stole upon her cheek, and laughter was dancing in her eyes yet she did not move. The young man took a step forward, and then stood staring at her with such a comical expression of injury on his face as was too much for Miss Jinny's serenity. She laughed. That laugh also struck minor chords upon Mr. Hopper's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5389"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 02 (#1)"],["body","here, and a few niggers. That's enough for a gentleman.\"  \"Pooh!\" exclaimed his cousin, \"this isn't a cotton plantation. Aunt Lillian doesn't farm for money. If she did, you would have to check your extravagances mighty quick, sir.\"  \"I look after Pompey's reports, I do as much work as my ancestors,\" answered Clarence, hotly.  \"Ah, that is the trouble,\" said Virginia.  \"What do you mean?\" her cousin demanded.  \"We have been gentlemen too long,\" said Virginia.  The boy straightened up and rose. The pride and wilfulness of generations was indeed in his handsome face. And something else went with it. Around the mouth a grave tinge of indulgence.  \"What has your life been?\" she went on, speaking rapidly. \"A mixture of gamecocks and ponies and race horses and billiards, and idleness at the Virginia Springs, and fighting with other boys. What do you know? You wouldn't go to college. You wouldn't study law. You can't write a decent letter. You don't know anything about the history of your country. What can you do--?\"  \"I can ride and fight,\" he said. \"I can go to New Orleans to-morrow to join Walker's Nicaragua expedition. We've got to beat the Yankees, --they'll have Kansas away from us before we know it.\"  Virginia's eye flashed appreciation.  \"Do you remember, Jinny,\" he cried, \"one day long ago when those Dutch ruffians were teasing you and Anne on the road, and Bert Russell and Jack and I came along? We whipped 'em, Jinny. And my eye was closed. And you were bathing it here, and one of my buttons was gone. And you counted the rest.\"  \"Rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief, doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief,\" she recited, laughing. She crossed over and sat beside him, and her tone changed. \"Max, can't you understand? It isn't that. Max, if you would only work at something. That is why the Yankees beat us. If you would learn to weld iron, or to build bridges, or railroads. Or if you would learn business, and go to work in Pa's store.\"  \"You do not care for me as I am?\"  \"I knew that you did not understand,\" she answered passionately. \"It is because I care for you that I wish to make you great. You care too much for a good time, for horses, Max. You love the South, but you think too little how she is to be saved. If war is to come, we shall want men like that Captain Robert Lee who was here. A man who can turn the forces of the earth to his own purposes.\"  For a moment Clarence was moodily silent.  \"I have always intended to go into politics, after Pa's example,\" he said at length.  \"Then--\" began Virginia, and paused.  \"Then--?\" he said.  \"Then--you must study law.\"  He gave her the one keen look. And she met it, with her lips tightly pressed together. Then he smiled.  \"Virginia, you will never forgive that Yankee, Brice.\"  \"I shall never forgive any Yankee,\" she retorted quickly. \"But we are not talking about him. I am thinking of the South, and of you.\"  He stooped toward her face, but she avoided him and went back to the bench.  \"Why not?\" he said.  \"You must prove first that you are a man,\" she said.  For years he remembered the scene. The vineyard, the yellow stubble; and the river rushing on and on with tranquil power, and the slow panting of the steamboat. A doe ran out of the forest, and paused, her head raised, not twenty feet away.  \"And then you will marry me, Jinny?\" he asked finally.  \"Before you may hope to control another, we shall see whether you can control yourself, sir.\"  \"But it has all been arranged,\" he exclaimed, \"since we played here together years ago!\"  \"No one shall arrange that for me,\" replied Virginia promptly. \"And I should think that you would wish to have some of the credit for yourself.\"  \"Jinny!\"  Again she avoided him by leaping the low railing. The doe fled into the forest, whistling fearfully. Virginia waved her hand to him and started toward the house. At the corner of the porch she ran into her aunt Mrs. Colfax was a beautiful woman. Beautiful when Addison Colfax married her in Kentucky at nineteen, beautiful still at three and forty. This, I am aware, is a bald statement. \"Prove it,\" you say. \"We do not believe it. It was told you by some old beau who lives upon the memory of the past.\"  Ladies, a score of different daguerrotypes of Lillian Colfax are in existence. And whatever may be said of portraits, daguerrotypes do not flatter. All the town admitted that she was beautiful. All the town knew that she was the daughter of old Judge Colfax's overseer at Halcyondale. If she had not been beautiful, Addison Colfax would not have run away with her. That is certain. He left her a rich widow at five and twenty, mistress of the country place he had bought on the Bellefontaine Road, near St. Louis. And when Mrs. Colfax was not dancing off to the Virginia watering-places, Bellegarde was a gay house.  \"Jinny,\" exclaimed her aunt, \"how you scared me! What on earth is the matter?\"  \"Nothing,\" said Virginia  \"She refused to kiss me,\" put in Clarence, half in play, half in resentment.  Mrs. Colfax laughed musically. She put one of her white hands on each of her niece's cheeks, kissed her, and then gazed into her face until Virginia reddened.  \"Law, Jinny, you're quite pretty,\" said her aunt  \"I hadn't realized it--but you must take care of your complexion. You're horribly sunburned, and you let your hair blow all over your face. It's barbarous not to wear a mask when you ride. Your Pa doesn't look after you properly. I would ask you to stay to the dance to-night if your skin were only white, instead of red. You're old enough to know better, Virginia. Mr. Vance was to have driven out for dinner. Have you seen him, Clarence?\"  \"No, mother.\"  \"He is so amusing,\" Mrs. Colfax continued, \"and he generally brings candy. I shall die of the blues before supper.\" She sat down with a grand air at the head of the table, while Alfred took the lid from the silver soup-tureen in front of her. \"Jinny, can't you say something bright? Do I have to listen to Clarence's horse talk for another hour? Tell me some gossip. Will you have some gumbo soup?\"  \"Why do you listen to Clarence's horse talk?\" said Virginia. \"Why don't you make him go to work!\"  \"Mercy!\" said Mrs. Colfax, laughing, \"what could he do?\"  \"That's just it,\" said Virginia. \"He hasn't a serious interest in life.\"  Clarence looked sullen. And his mother, as usual, took his side.  \"What put that into your head, Jinny,\" she said. \"He has the place here to look after, a very gentlemanly occupation. That's what they do in Virginia.\"  \"Yes,\" said Virginia, scornfully, \"we're all gentlemen in the South. What do we know about business and developing the resources of the country? Not THAT.\"  \"You make my head ache, my dear,\" was her aunt's reply. \"Where did you get all this?\"  \"You ask me because I am a girl,\" said Virginia. \"You believe that women were made to look at, and to play with,--not to think. But if we are going to get ahead of the Yankees, we shall have to think. It was all very well to be a gentleman in the days of my great-grandfather. But now we have railroads and steamboats. And who builds them? The Yankees. We of the South think of our ancestors, and drift deeper and deeper into debt. We know how to fight, and we know how to command. But we have been ruined by--\" here she glanced at the retreating form of Alfred, and lowered her voice, \"by niggers.\"  Mrs. Colfax's gaze rested languidly on her niece's faces which glowed with indignation.  \"You get this terrible habit of argument from Comyn,\" she said. \"He ought to send you to boarding-school. How mean of Mr. Vance not to come! You've been talking with that old reprobate Whipple. Why does Comyn put up with him?\"  \"He isn't an old reprobate,\" said Virginia, warmly.  \"You really ought to go to school,\" said her aunt. \"Don't be eccentric. It isn't fashionable. I suppose you wish Clarence to go into a factory.\"  \"If I were a man,\" said Virginia, \"and going into a factory would teach me how to make a locomotive or a cotton press, or to build a bridge, I should go into a factory. We shall never beat the Yankees until we meet them on their own ground.\"  \"There is Mr. Vance now,\" said Mrs. Colfax, and added fervently, \"Thank the Lord!\"     CHAPTER IX  A QUIET SUNDAY IN LOCUST STREET  IF the truth were known where Virginia got the opinions which she expressed so freely to her aunt and cousin, it was from Colonel Carvel himself. The Colonel would rather have denounced the Dred Scott decision than admit to Judge Whipple that one of the greatest weaknesses of the South lay in her lack of mechanical and manufacturing ability. But he had confessed as much in private to Captain Elijah Brent. The Colonel would often sit for an hour or more, after supper, with his feet tucked up on the mantel and his hat on the back of his head, buried in thought. Then he would saunter slowly down to the Planters' House bar, which served the purposes of a club in those days, in search of an argument with other prominent citizens. The Colonel had his own particular chair in his own particular corner, which was always vacated when he came in at the door. And then he always had three fingers of the best Bourbon whiskey, no more and no less, every evening.  He never met his bosom friend and pet antagonist at the Planters' House bar. Judge Whipple, indeed, took his meals upstairs, but he never descended,--it was generally supposed because of the strong slavery atmosphere there. However, the Judge went periodically to his friend's for a quiet Sunday dinner (so called in derision by St. Louisans), on which occasions Virginia sat at the end of the table and endeavored to pour water on the flames when they flared up too fiercely.  The Sunday following her ride to Bellegarde was the Judge's Sunday, Certain tastes which she had inherited had hitherto provided her with pleasurable sensations while these battles were in progress. More than once had she scored a fair hit on the Judge for her father,--to the mutual delight of both"]]]
