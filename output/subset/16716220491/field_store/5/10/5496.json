I heard her voice, and her silvery bell-like laughter--and then-- and then--.  You know very well what I learned yesterday.  The unworthy wife of an unworthy husband, the woman Sirona, is gone from me for ever, and I was striving to drive her image from my soul, to annihilate it and dissipate it--but in vain! and by degrees a wonderful stress of creative power came upon me.  I hastily placed the lamps, took the clay in my hand, and feature by feature I brought forth with bitter joy the image that is deeply graven in my heart, believing that thus I might be released from the spell.  There is the fruit which was ripened in my heart, but there, where it so long has dwelt, I feel a dismal void, and if the husk which so long tenderly enfolded this image were to wither and fall asunder, I should not wonder at it.--To that thing there clings the best part of my life.\"  \"Enough!\"  exclaimed Dorothea, interrupting her son who stood before her in great agitation and with trembling lips.  \"God forbid that that mask there should destroy your life and soul.  I suffer nothing impure within my house, and you should not in your heart.  That which is evil can never more be fair, and however lovely the face there may look to you, it looks quite as repulsive to me when I reflect that it probably smiled still more fascinatingly on some strolling beggar.  If the Gaul brings her back I will turn her out of my house, and I will destroy her image with my own hands if you do not break it in pieces on the spot.\"  Dorothea's eyes were swimming in tears as she spoke these words.  She had felt with pride and emotion during her son's speech how noble and high- minded he was, and the idea that this rare and precious treasure should be spoilt or perhaps altogether ruined for the sake of a lost woman, drove her to desperation, and filled her motherly heart with indignation.  Firmly resolved to carry out her threat she stepped towards the figure, but Polykarp placed himself in her way, raising his arm imploringly to defend it, and saying, \"Not to-day--not yet, mother!  I will cover it up, and will not look at it again till to-morrow, but once--only once--I must see it again by sunlight.\"  \"So that to-morrow the old madness may revive in you!\"  cried Dorothea. \"Move out of my way or take the hammer yourself.\"  \"You order it, and you are my mother,\" said Polykarp.  He slowly went up to the chest in which his tools and instruments lay, and bitter tears ran down his cheeks, as he took his heaviest hammer in his hand.  When the sky has shown for many days in summer-blue, and then suddenly the clouds gather for a storm, when the first silent but fearful flash with it noisy but harmless associate the thunder-clap has terrified the world, a second and third thunder-bolt immediately follow.  Since the stormy night of yesterday had broken in on the peaceful, industrious, and monotonous life by the senator's hearth, many things had happened that had filled him and his wife with fresh anxiety.  In other houses it was nothing remarkable that a slave should run away, but in the senator's it was more than twenty years since such a thing had occurred, and yesterday the goat-herd Miriam had disappeared.  This was vexatious, but the silent sorrow of his son Polykarp was a greater anxiety to Petrus.  It did not please him that the youth, who was usually so vehement, should submit unresistingly and almost indifferently to the Bishop Agapitus, who prohibited his completing his lions.  His son's sad gaze, his crushed and broken aspect were still in his mind when at last he went to rest for the night; it was already late, but sleep avoided him even as it had avoided Dorothea.  While the mother was thinking of her son's sinful love and the bleeding wound in his young and betrayed heart, the father grieved for Polykarp's baffled hopes of exercising his art on a great work and recalled the saddest, bitterest day of his own youth; for he too had served his apprenticeship under a sculptor in Alexandria, had looked up to the works of the heathen as noble models, and striven to form himself upon them.  He had already been permitted by his master to execute designs of his own, and out of the abundance of subjects which offered themselves, he had chosen to model an Ariadne, waiting and longing for the return of Thescus, as a symbolic image of his own soul awaiting its salvation.  How this work had filled his mind! how delightful had the hours of labor seemed to him!--when, suddenly, his stern father had come to the city, had seen his work before it was quite finished, and instead of praising it had scorned it; had abused it as a heathen idol, and had commanded Petrus to return home with him immediately, and to remain there, for that his son should be a pious Christian, and a good stone-mason withal--not half a heathen, and a maker of false gods.  Petrus had much loved his art, but he offered no resistance to his father's orders; he followed him back to the oasis, there to superintend the work of the slaves who hewed the stone, to measure granite-blocks for sarcophagi and pillars, and to direct the cutting of them.  His father was a man of steel, and he himself a lad of iron, and when he saw himself compelled to yield to his father and to leave his master's workshop, to abandon his cherished and unfinished work and to become an artizan and mail of business, he swore never again to take a piece of clay in his hand, or to wield a chisel.  And he kept his word even after his fathers death; but his creative instincts and love of art continued to live and work in him, and were transmitted to his two sons.  Antonius was a highly gifted artist, and if Polykarp's master was not mistaken, and if he himself were not misled by fatherly affection, his second son was on the high road to the very first rank in art--to a position reached only by elect spirits.  Petrus knew the models for the Good Shepherd and for the lions, and declared to himself that these last were unsurpassable in truth, power, and majesty.  How eagerly must the young artist long to execute them in hard stone, and to see them placed in the honored, though indeed pagan, spot, which was intended for them.  And now the bishop forbade him the work, and the poor fellow might well be feeling just as he himself had felt thirty years ago, when he had been commanded to abandon the immature first-fruits of his labor.  Was the bishop indeed right?  This and many other questions agitated the sleepless father, and as soon as he heard that his wife had risen from her bed to go to her son, whose footsteps he too could hear overhead, he got up and followed her.  He found the door of the work-room open, and, himself unseen and unheard, he was witness to his wife's vehement speech, and to the lad's justification, while Polykarp's work stood in the full light of the lamps, exactly in front of him.  His gaze was spell-bound to the mass of clay; he looked and looked, and was not weary of looking, and his soul swelled with the same awe-struck sense of devout admiration that it had experienced, when for the first time, in his early youth, he saw with his own eyes the works of the great old Athenian masters in the Caesareum.  And this head was his son's work!  He stood there greatly overcome, his hands clasped together, holding his breath till his mouth was dry, and swallowing his tears to keep them from falling.  At the same time he listened with anxious attention, so as not to lose one word of Polykarp's.  \"Aye, thus and thus only are great works of art begotten,\" said he to himself, \"and if the Lord had bestowed on me such gifts as on this lad, no father, nay, no god, should have compelled me to leave my Ariadne unfinished.  The attitude of the body was not bad I should say--but the head, the face--Aye, the man who can mould such a likeness as that has his hand and eye guided by the holy spirits of art.  He who has done that head will be praised in the latter days together with the great Athenian masters--and he-yes, he, merciful Heaven! he is my own beloved son!\"  A blessed sense of rejoicing, such as he had not felt since his early youth, filled his heart, and Dorothea's ardor seemed to him half pitiful and half amusing.  It was not till his duteous son took the hammer in his hand, that he stepped between his wife and the bust, saying kindly:  \"There will be time enough to-morrow to destroy the work.  Forget the model, my son, now that you have taken advantage of it so successfully. I know of a better mistress for you--Art--to whom belongs everything of beauty that the Most High has created--In Art in all its breadth and fulness, not fettered and narrowed by any Agapitus.\"  Polykarp flung himself into his father's arms, and the stern man, hardly master of his emotions, kissed the boy's forehead, his eyes, and his cheeks.     CHAPTER XIV.  At noon of the following day the senator went to the women's room, and while he was still on the threshold, he asked his wife--who was busy at the loom:  \"Where is Polykarp?  I did not find him with Antonius, who is working at the placing of the altar, and I thought I might find him here.\"  \"After going to the church,\" said Dorothea, \"he went up the mountain. Go down to the workshops, Marthana, and see if your brother has come back.\"  Her daughter obeyed quickly and gladly, for her brother was to her the dearest, and seemed to her to be the best, of men.  As soon as the pair were alone together Petrus said, while he held out his hand to his wife with genial affection, \"Well, mother--shake hands.\"  Dorothea paused for an instant, looking him in the face, as if to ask him, \"Does your pride at last allow you to cease doing me an injustice?\"  It was a reproach, but in truth not a severe one, or her lips would hardly have trembled so tenderly, as she said.  \"You cannot be angry with me any longer, and it is well that all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5497"],["title","Homo Sum — Volume 04 (#2)"],["body","once more be as it ought.\"  All certainly had not been \"as it ought,\" for since the husband and wife had met in Polykarp's work-room, they had behaved to each other as if they were strangers.  In their bedroom, on the way to church, and at breakfast, they had spoken to each no more than was absolutely necessary, or than was requisite in order to conceal their difference from the servants and children.  Up to this time, an understanding had always subsisted between them that had never taken form in words, and yet that had scarcely in a single case been infringed, that neither should ever praise one of their children for anything that the other thought blameworthy, and vice versa.  But in this night, her husband had followed up her severest condemnation by passionately embracing the wrong-doer.  Never had she been so stern in any circumstances, while on the other hand her husband, so long as she could remember, had never been so softhearted and tender to his son, and yet she had controlled herself so far, as not to contradict Petrus in Polykarp's presence, and to leave the work-room in silence with her husband.  \"When we are once alone together in the bedroom,\" thought she, \"I will represent to him his error as I ought, and he will have to answer for himself.\"  But she did not carry out this purpose, for she felt that something must be passing in her husband's mind that she did not understand; otherwise how could his grave eyes shine so mildly and kindly, and his stern lips smile so affectionately after all that had occurred when he, lamp in hand, had mounted the narrow stair.  He had often told her that she could read his soul like an open book, but she did not conceal from herself that there were certain sides of that complex structure whose meaning she was incapable of comprehending. And strange to say, she ever and again came upon these incomprehensible phases of his soul, when the images of the gods, and the idolatrous temples of the heathen, or when their sons' enterprises and work were the matters in hand.  And yet Petrus was the son of a pious Christian; but his grandfather had been a Greek heathen, and hence perhaps a certain something wrought in his blood which tormented her, because she could not reconcile it with Agapitus' doctrine, but which she nevertheless dared not attempt to oppose because her taciturn husband never spoke out with so much cheerfulness and frankness as when he might talk of these things with his sons and their friends, who often accompanied them to the oasis. Certainly, it could be nothing sinful that at this particular moment seemed to light up her husband's face, and restore his youth.  \"They just are men,\" said she to herself, \"and in many things they have the advantage of us women.  The old man looks as he did on his wedding- day!  Polykarp is the very image of him, as every one says, and now, looking at the father, and recalling to my mind how the boy looked when he told me how he could not refrain from making Sirona's portrait, I must say that I never saw such a likeness in the whole course of my life.\"  He bid her a friendly good night, and extinguished the lamp.  She would willingly have said a loving word to him, for his contented expression touched and comforted her, but that would just then have been too much after what she had gone through in her son's workroom.  In former years it had happened pretty often that, when one of them had caused dissatisfaction to the other, and there had been some quarrel between them, they had gone to rest unreconciled, but the older they grew the more rarely did this occur, and it was now a long time since any shadow had fallen on the perfect serenity of their married life.  Three years ago, on the occasion of the marriage of their eldest son, they had been standing together, looking up at the starry sky, when Petrus had come close up to her, and had said, \"How calmly and peacefully the wanderers up there follow their roads without jostling or touching one another!  As I walked home alone from the quarries by their friendly light, I thought of many things.  Perhaps there was once a time when the stars rushed wildly about in confusion, crossing each other's path, while many a star flew in pieces at the impact.  Then the Lord created man, and love came into the world and filled the heavens and the earth, and he commanded the stars to be our light by night; then each began to respect the path of the other, and the stars more rarely came into collision till even the smallest and swiftest kept to its own path and its own period, and the shining host above grew to be as harmonious as it is numberless. Love and a common purpose worked this marvel, for he who loves another, will do him no injury, and he who is bound to perfect a work with the help of another, will not hinder nor delay him.  We two have long since found the right road, and if at any time one of us is inclined to cross the path of the other, we are held back by love and by our common duty, namely to shed a pure light on the path of our children.\"  Dorothea had never forgotten these words, and they came into her mind now again when Petrus held out his hand to her so warmly; as she laid hers in it, she said:  \"For the sake of dear peace, well and good--but one thing I cannot leave unsaid.  Soft-hearted weakness is not usually your defect, but you will utterly spoil Polykarp.\"  \"Leave him, let us leave him as he is,\" cried Petrus, kissing his wife's brow.  \"It is strange how we have exchanged parts!  Yesterday you were exhorting me to mildness towards the lad, and to-day--\"  \"To-day I am severer than you,\" interrupted Dorothea.  \"Who, indeed, could guess that an old graybeard would derogate from the duties of his office as father and as judge for the sake of a woman's smiling face in clay--as Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage?\"  \"And to whom would it occur,\" asked Petrus, taking up his wife's tone, \"that so tender a mother as you would condemn her favorite son, because he labored to earn peace for his soul by a deed--by a work for which his master might envy him?\"  \"I have indeed observed,\" interrupted Dorothea, that Sirona's image has bewitched you, and you speak as if the boy had achieved some great miracle.  I do not know much about modelling and sculpture, and I will not contradict you, but if the fair-haired creature's face were less pretty, and if Polykarp had not executed any thing remarkable, would it have made the smallest difference in what he has done and felt wrong? Certainly not.  But that is just like men, they care only for success.\"  \"And with perfect justice,\" answered Petrus, \"if the success is attained, not in mere child's play, but by a severe struggle.  'To him, that hath, shall more be given,' says the scripture, and he who has a soul more richly graced than others have--he who is helped by good spirits--he shall be forgiven many things that even a mild judge would be unwilling to pardon in a man of poor gifts, who torments and exerts himself and yet brings nothing to perfection.  Be kind to the boy again.  Do you know what prospect lies before you through him?  You yourself in your life have done much good, and spoken much wisdom, and I, and the children, and the people in this place, will never forget it all.  But I can promise you the gratitude of the best and noblest who now live or who will live in centuries to come--for that you are the mother of Polykarp!\"  \"And people say,\" cried Dorothea, \"that every mother has four eyes for her children's merits.  If that is true, then fathers no doubt have ten, and you as many as Argus, of whom the heathen legend speaks--But there comes Polykarp.\"  Petrus went forward to meet his son, and gave him his hand, but in quite a different manner to what he had formerly shown; at least it seemed to Dorothea that her husband received the youth, no longer as his father and master, but as a friend greets a friend who is his equal in privileges and judgment.  When Polykarp turned to greet her also she colored all over, for the thought flashed through her mind that her son, when he thought of the past night, must regard her as unjust or foolish; but she soon recovered her own calm equanimity, for Polykarp was the same as ever, and she read in his eyes that he felt towards her the same as yesterday and as ever.  \"Love,\" thought she, \"is not extinguished by injustice, as fire is by water.  It blazes up brighter or less bright, no doubt, according to the way the wind blows, but it cannot be wholly smothered--least of all by death.\"  Polykarp had been up the mountain, and Dorothea was quite satisfied when he related what had led him thither.  He had long since planned the execution of a statue of Moses, and when his father had left him, he could not get the tall and dignified figure of the old man out of his mind.  He felt that he had found the right model for his work.  He must, he would forget--and he knew, that he could only succeed if he found a task which might promise to give some new occupation to his bereaved soul.  Still, he had seen the form of the mighty man of God which he proposed to model, only in vague outline before his mind's eye, and he had been prompted to go to a spot whither many pilgrims resorted, and which was known as the Place of Communion, because it was there that the Lord had spoken to Moses.  There Polykarp had spent some time, for there, if anywhere--there, where the Law-giver himself had stood, must he find right inspiration.  \"And you have accomplished your end?\"  asked his father.  Polykarp shook his head.  \"If you go often enough to the sacred spot, it will come to you,\" said Dorothea.  \"The beginning is always the chief difficulty; only begin at once to model your father's head.\"  \"I have already begun it,\" replied Polykarp, \"but I am still tired from last night.\"  \"You look pale, and have dark lines under your eyes,\" said Dorothea anxiously.  \"Go up stairs and he down to rest.
