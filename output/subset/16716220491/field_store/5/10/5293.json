He probably isn't pretty.\"  \"Because I want to write a book about him.\"  \"A book--\" Ronson's memory suddenly came alive and he remembered where he had seen her name before. He stared at her, startled and almost aghast. Back on Earth, this woman was almost a legend. Every tabloid and every Sunday supplement had carried her picture and stories about her. The programs beamed to space had carried tales of her exploits. She had explored the depths of the Venusian jungles, she had ridden a _dothar_ across half of Mars. When Deep Space Flight One had blasted off from Pluto, bound for the exploration of deep space, the news telecasts back to Earth had carried the information that a stowaway had been discovered and ejected from the ship just before blast off. No one had been surprised when this stowaway had turned out to be Jennie Ware. Subsequent rumors had whispered that she had practically torn Pluto Dome apart because she had been ejected from the ship. Even the fact that the ship had never returned had not cooled her anger.  In addition, she was also a very competent author. Ronson had read two of her books and had admired her deft touch with words and the deep sincerity that had showed through in even the most hard-boiled and raucous passages. Unquestionably Jennie Ware was a very unusual human being.  But in spite of this, Ronson stared at her in growing horror. Her reputation across the solar system was that of an uninhibited vixen. Here in this place, where their lives might ride on the blinking of an eye-lash, or on not blinking it, a temper tantrum thrown by Jennie Ware--or by anybody else--was the last thing he wanted to see.  A tall figure loomed beside the table. A deep voice asked, laughingly, \"Well, Jim, since you've already met our lady authoress, how do you like her?\"  Ronson looked up, then got up, his hand going out, a grin spurting to his face. The man standing there, Sam Crick, took the outstretched hand and grinned back at him.  Crick was tall and lean. His skin was tanned a deep brown, a color that had resulted from facing all the winds that had ever blown on Mars and all the sun that had ever shown there. Crick was something of a legend on the Red Planet. He was the eternal adventurer, the lonely wanderer of the waste place, the type of human who was always looking for something that lay just over the edge of the horizon.  Jim Ronson and Sam Crick had grown up together as boys on Earth. Ronson had gone into a laboratory, Crick had hopped a freighter bound for Mars. Ronson had not seen his old friend in many years, but he had heard from him and about him. A feeling of deep warmth came up inside the scientist at the sight of the tanned face grinning at him.  \"Then you did get my space radio?\" Ronson said. \"I couldn't locate you in Mars Port and I was never sure.\" Relief at finding Crick here was a surging feeling deep within him. With Crick here, he not only had a man experienced in Martian ways and customs to help him, but what was more important, he had a friend.  Crick's face lost its smile. Wrinkles showed on his forehead. \"What space radio, Jim?\"  \"The one I sent you, asking you to meet me here. Quit kidding me. If you didn't get my space radio, how does it happen that you're here? Don't tell me this is a coincidence.\"  Crick shook his head. A doleful expression appeared on his face. \"I sure didn't get it, Jim. As to what I'm doing here, I'm chaperoning our lady authoress. Meet my boss.\" He nodded to Jennie Ware.  Ronson turned startled eyes toward the girl.  \"I caught him flat broke in Mars Port just before you arrived,\" she answered. \"Since he was broke, I took advantage of him and hired him as my bodyguard. Not that I would really need a bodyguard, but in case I fell and broke a leg, he might be handy. But his being here wasn't a coincidence.\"  \"Eh?\" Ronson said. It was difficult to follow her thinking. She seemed to say a lot, or nothing, all with the same words, the only difference being the voice tone she used. If she chose, she had all the gifts of a man in concealing her true feelings and real opinions.  Her voice was calm, her face expressionless. \"The grapevine in Mars Port said the Earth's top-flight bio-physicist was coming here, that old Les Ro was thought to have something that human scientists were all hotted up about, and that you were coming here to investigate, and to chisel Les Ro out of a piece of it, if he would stand still for such treatment.\"  Ronson blinked at her. She had delivered a bombshell and she had done it as if she thought what she said was of no importance: \"I'm not trying to chisel Les Ro or anybody out of anything.\" His calm matched her aplomb.  \"That's not the way the grapevine had it.\"  \"I don't care how the grapevine had it. I know my own motives and my purpose in coming here.\" An edge crept into his voice as he realized one possible result of what she was saying.  \"That may be true. But do the Martians know them?\"  Ronson was silent, his thinking perturbed.  \"So I hired Sam and came here,\" Jennie Ware continued. \"If Les Ro was big enough to attract you, he was also big enough to provide me with copy for my next book.\"  \"So you could find copy for a damned book, you risked my neck!\" Ronson said, his voice hot.  \"I didn't risk it a tenth as much as you're doing, by yelling at the top of your lungs where half of Mars can hear you. Anyhow, I saved your clothes and maybe your hide out in front a while ago. Doesn't that count for something?\"  \"Sorry,\" Ronson said abruptly. \"I lost my temper.\"  \"I'd like to make one point,\" Crick said. \"We've got a mighty hot collection of thieves, crooks, and killers present in this joint.\"  Jennie Ware and Jim Ronson stared at him.  Crick gestured toward the Martian with the two guards. \"That's Tal Bock. He belongs in the upper lentz country, where he is the leader of a gang of killers and thieves. The one over there soaking his hands in smoke is Kus Dorken. He's not any better than Tal Bock.\"  \"What are they doing here?\" the girl asked.  \"I don't know,\" Crick answered. \"Unless maybe they've been listening in on the grapevine too.\"  For a moment, it looked as if Jennie Ware was about to cry. She seemed, suddenly, to become a small girl who had done something wrong and was very sorry for it and was trying to find some way to express her sorrow. Her hand came across the table again, touched Ronson's hand hesitantly.  \"I'm sorry, Jim, if I got you into trouble. But I knew your reputation. If you were coming here, something big was here. I--I wanted to be in on it. I guess all my life I've wanted to be in on something big. If I actually got you into trouble, Sam and I are here to help you get out of it. Isn't that right, Sam?\"  \"Right, Jennie.\" A growl sounded in the tall adventurer's voice. \"Thanks, both of you,\" Ronson said. He was deeply touched. In spite of the shell of bravado that she wore, and her sudden spurting anger, he liked this girl. She might have the reputation of an uninhibited vixen, but somewhere inside of her was a small girl looking out from awed and wondering eyes at the vastness of the world.  \"Watch it!\" Crick's whisper was shrill and sharp. His eyes were focused on the ceiling.  All the sounds of the place, the rattle of glasses, the sharp giggling of soliciting women, the deep voices of the Martian males, had gone into sudden and complete silence. Like Crick, they were looking upward. Ronson followed their gaze to the ceiling. Jennie Ware gave a quick cry. Glass tinkled and broke as she dropped her drink.  Jim Ronson did not hear the sound. His entire attention was focused on what was happening on the ceiling.  The dive itself had been cut into the side of the cliff. The solid rock of the ceiling had not been disguised or masked.  At first glance, Ronson thought his eyes were deceiving him. The solid stone itself seemed to be in motion. A sort of melting, shifting flow seemed to be taking place as if the molecules and perhaps even the atoms themselves were dissolving.  \"That's atomic disintegration, or atomic shifting, under control!\" Sam Crick gasped.  \"It's a mirage,\" Jennie Ware whispered. \"It must be.\"  \"If it's a mirage, everybody in the place is seeing it,\" Ronson said.  There was not a sound in the huge room. The waiters had come to attention like trained soldiers. The females had abruptly lost all interest in what they were doing. Out of the corner of his eyes, Ronson saw one female make a sudden darting movement across the room. One foot touched the circle on the floor as she ran. She took two more steps and fell, sagging downward as if every muscle in her body had suddenly refused to function. She lay on the floor without moving. Not a head was turned toward her, not a Martian moved to help her. In her action Ronson saw one reason why the Martians avoided the circle on the floor. Something was definitely wrong with that circle. Looking at the roof, he saw the reason.  The flowing, shifting movement there had formed into a circle the same size as the circle on the floor and directly above it. Little flickers of light, like the discharge of high frequency currents, were flowing between the two circles. Swiftly the flickers of light became an opaque cylinder of misty flame extending from the ceiling to the floor.  From the opaque cylinder of light, a Martian stepped.  Without quite knowing how he knew it, Ronson knew that this was Les Ro's Messenger.  The Messenger was old, perhaps as old as the granite mountain above them, if the network of fine wrinkles on his face were an accurate indication of his age. With age, calmness and serenity had come to this Martian. His eyes gave the impression that they had seen everything. What they had not seen, the brain behind them had imagined. Peace was in the eyes and on the face, the deep peace that many human saints had sought and had found.  \"I like him,\" Jennie Ware whispered."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5201"],["title","Don Juan Tenorio (#1)"],["body","vive Dios!, que me impaciento.
