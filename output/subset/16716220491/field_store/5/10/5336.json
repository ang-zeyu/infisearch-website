On this occasion I could not but think our situation most alarming. We were drawn up on a narrow bridge over a foaming torrent, with jagged rocks sticking up from the bottom, suggesting a not very pleasant fate had we been rolled over. Here we remained for four hours and a half. Luckily I was so much occupied with my own thoughts, that I did not hear a gentleman in an adjoining compartment recounting to his horrified audience an accident on the Boston Railway, in which he had been a reluctant participator, the week before, and which occurred to a train in a similar position to ours. This train waited for many hours, _was_ at last run into, and twenty-five of the passengers were killed. Your sister heard every word, but took care not to disturb my meditations.  This accident detained us so long, that it was past midnight when we got into Toronto, and, hiring a carriage, were driven to a respectable, cheap family hotel, strongly recommended to your brother by a kind and gentlemanly Canadian, who was our fellow-passenger from England.  Unfortunately they were full, from garret to cellar, and could not take us in. Our driver, left to his own devices, took us to the “Rossin House,” where we remained till the next day, most _supremely uncomfortable_, in a rambling hotel of immense extent, where I lost my way every time I left the saloon; where, from not knowing the hours, we were all but starved; and where it was hardly possible to obtain a civil answer from any one of the attendants.  We started from Toronto at three p.m. the next day, leaving our young friend C. W. behind, who, having drawn his money, was going back to Montreal, to pass a little time there before joining us in the Bush. He had also to present letters of introduction to Judge J----n, who was _known_ to be _able_ and _presumed_ to be _willing_, to assist the views of the son of his old friend.  The farther we went from Toronto, the more barren and ugly the country appeared, and the hideous stumps in every clearing became more and more visible. By degrees also the gardens by the roadside became more denuded of floral vegetation, till at last my eyes rested for miles on little but holly-hocks and pumpkins. Towards dusk, the lurid glare of the burning trees in the far-off forest became appalling, as well as magnificent. I was told that the season had been exceptionally dry, no rain having fallen for three months, and that in different parts the fires had been most destructive. In almost every case these fires have been the natural result of some incidental carelessness. Some wayfarer, far from his home, and camping out for the night, leaves the smouldering ashes of his fire to be blown into a flame by a sudden breeze, or flings the ashes of his pipe into the adjacent brushwood; in leaving the place of his temporary halt, he little imagines the loss of property, and even of life, which may be occasioned by his thoughtlessness.  We slept that night at Belle Ewart, a rising town on Lake Simere, and the next morning took the steamer to Orillia. This passage across the lake was the most beautiful part of our journey. The day was bright and clear, the water blue, and the scenery most beautiful. All was changed when we landed at Orillia. We had to leave our nice, roomy, well-appointed steamer for a filthy, over-crowded little boat, where we had hardly standing-room.  I now saw, for the first time, _real live Indians_, both men and women, some of each being on board the boat. Their encampment on the lake was likewise pointed out to me. Alas for my enthusiasm! Alas for my remembrance of youthful delight over Cooper’s enchanting novels! I was never more disappointed in my life than when I first took notice of these degenerate samples of “Red Men!”  The men appeared to me undersized and sinister-looking, the squaws filthy and almost repulsive. No stretch of imagination could bring before me in the persons of these very ordinary mortals the dignified and graceful “Uncas,” or the stately and warlike “Chingachook!” We landed at Washage, and after standing for more than an hour on the quay, took the stage-wagon for Gravenhurst, the vehicle being so crowded that even the personal baggage most essential to our comfort had to be left behind. Oh! the horrors of that journey! The road was most dreadful--our first acquaintance with “corduroy” roads. The forest gradually closed in upon us, on fire on both sides, burnt trees crashing down in all directions, here and there one right across the road, which had to be dragged out of the way before we could go on. Your brother with his arm round me the whole way (I clinging to the collar of his coat), could hardly keep me steady as we bumped over every obstacle. In the worst places I was glad to shut my eyes that I might not see the danger. Your poor sister had to cling convulsively to the rope which secured the passengers’ baggage (ours was left behind and we did not see it for weeks) to avoid being thrown out, and for long afterwards we both suffered from the bruises we received and the strain upon our limbs. At last, long after dark, we arrived at Gravenhurst, where we were obliged to sleep, as the steamer to Bracebridge could not start before morning on account of the fog. The steam-boat had no accommodation for sleeping, but we had a good supper on board, and a gentlemanly Englishman, a passenger by the stage and well acquainted with Muskoka, took us to a small hotel to sleep. The next morning we went to Bracebridge, and there we found a letter from your brother-in-law advising me to go before the commissioner of crown-lands and sign for my land. The papers for my free grant of a hundred acres had gone to France, but had missed me, as I had already left. Unfortunately our means were too exhausted to allow of our remaining even one day in Bracebridge, and we thought it more prudent to start early in the stage-wagon, as the magistrate’s office would not be open till ten a.m.  The not being able to sign at once lost me the power of selling my pine-trees, the new law (a most unjust one) coming into operation before I was able to come in again. We were at the N. A. Hotel, and the mistress of it, herself an Englishwoman and not long from Devonshire, told me afterwards how sincerely she pitied us, and said to her husband when we were gone, “That poor lady and her daughter little know what hardships they are about to encounter in the ‘Bush!’” The drive from Bracebridge to Utterson, the nearest post-town to our settlement and distant from it six miles, was a long and fatiguing stretch of fifteen miles, but unmarked by any incident of consequence. The forest fires were burning fiercely, and our driver told us that a week before the road had been impassable. At times when the trees were burning at each side of the narrow road we felt a hot stifling air as we passed rapidly along. It was a gloomy afternoon, with fitful gusts of wind portending a change of weather, and we were almost smothered in clouds of Muskoka dust, much resembling pounded bricks. When we got to Utterson we were obliged to remain for two hours to rest the poor horses, as no fresh ones were to be got. While at the little tavern we heard that your brother C. had been married a few weeks before, as we expected, and that your dear sister F., with her husband, children, and the _fiancée_, had rested there on their way to the “Bush,” six weeks before our arrival. We were more easy in our minds after this. We were near our journey’s end, the dear ones who had preceded us were all well, and the marriage which for four years I had been endeavouring to secure for your youngest brother had been happily accomplished. _I_ alone of all our party felt a hopeless depression of spirits, a presentiment of long months of unhappiness. Our drive from Utterson was short, but we went slowly, and it was late in the day before we turned into the “Bush.” Our driver called the path we were going a “road;” I saw nothing but a narrow track with frightful stumps, over which our wagon jolted in a manner to endanger our limbs; indeed, though more than three miles from your brother-in-law’s, we soon insisted on walking, thinking it safer. We found the thick undergrowth of “ground-hemlock” very trying to walk upon, as it caught our feet in an alarming manner. Our path was intersected by deep gullies, the sides of which were precipitous. I must say that the horses of this country, like the mules of Spain, seem wonderfully sure-footed, and the drivers, who mostly appear as reckless and daring as Irish carmen, guide them very safely, and accidents rarely occur.  After we had crossed the second gully, our driver said he could go no farther, as it would be dark before he got out of the “Bush,” a thing much dreaded here. Accordingly your brother paid and dismissed him, and we were left with all our packages by the roadside to find our way as best we could. Luckily we came upon a very respectable settler, working on a part of his clearing near the path, who most kindly left his work and piloted us to your brother-in-law’s lot, where we found a very small “clearing,” and a log-house in the middle of it. Your sister F. and the dear children came running out to meet and welcome us, and after the first warm congratulations, F. and your brother went to fetch the newly-married couple, who at once came back with them. There was much to hear and to tell, and you may judge how great was our dismay to find that those we had come to burthen with our presence, were for the time being as penniless as ourselves, and that weary and fatigued as we were, the only refreshment my dear child could offer us was linseed tea without sugar or milk, and sour, doughy bread which I could not persuade myself to swallow. Our sleeping arrangements were of the most primitive description.

I won’t burden you with it,” said Carl, rising from his recumbent position.  “Look here, Carl, how far have you walked with it this morning?”  “About twelve miles.”  “Then, of course, you’re tired, and require rest. Just jump on that bicycle, and I’ll take the gripsack. If you have carried it twelve miles, I can surely carry it one.”  “You are very kind, Gilbert.”  “Why shouldn’t I be?”  “But it is imposing up on your good nature.”  But Gilbert had turned his head in a backward direction, and nodded in a satisfied way as he saw a light, open buggy rapidly approaching.  “There’s my sister in that carriage,” he said. “She comes in good time. I will put you and your gripsack in with her, and I’ll take to my bicycle again.”  “Your sister may not like such an arrangement.”  “Won’t she though! She’s very fond of beaux, and she will receive you very graciously.”  “You make me feel bashful, Gilbert.”  “You won’t be long. Julia will chat away to you as if she’d known you for fifty years.”  “I was very young fifty years ago,” said Carl, smiling.  “Hi, there, Jule!” called Gilbert, waving his hand.  Julia Vance stopped the horse, and looked inquiringly and rather admiringly at Carl, who was a boy of fine appearance.  “Let me introduce you to my friend and schoolmate, Carl Crawford.”  Carl took off his hat politely.  “I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Crawford,” said Julia, demurely; “I have often heard Gilbert speak of you.”  “I hope he said nothing bad about me, Miss Vance.”  “You may be sure he didn’t. If he should now--I wouldn’t believe him.”  “You’ve made a favorable impression, Carl,” said Gilbert, smiling.  “I am naturally prejudiced against boys--having such a brother,” said Julia; “but it is not fair to judge all boys by him.”  “That is outrageous injustice!” said Gilbert; “but then, sisters seldom appreciate their brothers.”  “Some other fellows’ sisters may,” said Carl.  “They do, they do!”  “Did you ever see such a vain, conceited boy, Mr. Crawford?”  “Of course you know him better than I do.”  “Come, Carl; it’s too bad for you, too, to join against me. However, I will forget and forgive. Jule, my friend, Carl, has accepted my invitation to make us a visit.”  “I am very glad, I am sure,” said Julia, sincerely.  “And I want you to take him in, bag and baggage, and convey him to our palace, while I speed thither on my wheel.”  “To be sure I will, and with great pleasure.”  “Can’t you get out and assist him into the carriage, Jule?”  “Thank you,” said Carl; “but though I am somewhat old and quite infirm, I think I can get in without troubling your sister. Are you sure, Miss Vance, you won’t be incommoded by my gripsack?”  “Not at all.”  “Then I will accept your kind offer.”  In a trice Carl was seated next to Julia, with his valise at his feet.  “Won’t you drive, Mr. Crawford?” said the young lady.  “Don’t let me take the reins from you.”  “I don’t think it looks well for a lady to drive when a gentleman is sitting beside her.”  Carl was glad to take the reins, for he liked driving.  “Now for a race!” said Gilbert, who was mounted on his bicycle.  “All right!” replied Carl. “Look out for us!”  They started, and the two kept neck and neck till they entered the driveway leading up to a handsome country mansion.  Carl followed them into the house, and was cordially received by Mr. and Mrs. Vance, who were very kind and hospitable, and were favorably impressed by the gentlemanly appearance of their son’s friend.  Half an hour later dinner was announced, and Carl, having removed the stains of travel in his schoolmate’s room, descended to the dining-room, and, it must be confessed, did ample justice to the bounteous repast spread before him.  In the afternoon Julia, Gilbert and he played tennis, and had a trial at archery. The hours glided away very rapidly, and six o’clock came before they were aware.  “Gilbert,” said Carl, as they were preparing for tea, “you have a charming home.”  “You have a nice house, too, Carl.”  “True; but it isn’t a home--to me. There is no love there.”  “That makes a great difference.”  “If I had a father and mother like yours I should be happy.”  “You must stay here till day after tomorrow, and I will devote to-morrow to a visit in your interest to your home. I will beard the lion in his den--that is, your stepmother. Do you consent?”  “Yes, I consent; but it won’t do any good.”  “We will see.”    CHAPTER III.  INTRODUCES PETER COOK.   Gilbert took the morning train to the town of Edgewood Center, the residence of the Crawfords. He had been there before, and knew that Carl’s home was nearly a mile distant from the station. Though there was a hack in waiting, he preferred to walk, as it would give him a chance to think over what he proposed to say to Dr. Crawford in Carl’s behalf.  He was within a quarter of a mile of his destination when his attention was drawn to a boy of about his own age, who was amusing himself and a smaller companion by firing stones at a cat that had taken refuge in a tree. Just as Gilbert came up, a stone took effect, and the poor cat moaned in affright, but did not dare to come down from her perch, as this would put her in the power of her assailant.  “That must be Carl’s stepbrother, Peter,” Gilbert decided, as he noted the boy’s mean face and turn-up nose. “Stoning cats seems to be his idea of amusement. I shall take the liberty of interfering.”  Peter Cook laughed heartily at his successful aim.  “I hit her, Simon,” he said. “Doesn’t she look seared?”  “You must have hurt her.”  “I expect I did. I’ll take a bigger stone next time.”  He suited the action to the word, and picked up a rock which, should it hit the poor cat, would in all probability kill her, and prepared to fire.  “Put down that rock!” said Gilbert, indignantly.  Peter turned quickly, and eyed Gilbert insolently.  “Who are you?” he demanded.  “No matter who I am. Put down that rock!”  “What business is it of yours?”  “I shall make it my business to protect that cat from your cruelty.”  Peter, who was a natural coward, took courage from having a companion to back him up, and retorted: “You’d better clear out of here, or I may fire at you.”  “Do it if you dare!” said Gilbert, quietly.  Peter concluded that it would be wiser not to carry out his threat, but was resolved to keep to his original purpose. He raised his arm again, and took aim; but Gilbert rushed in, and striking his arm forcibly, compelled him to drop it.  “What do you mean by that, you loafer?” demanded Peter, his eyes blazing with anger.  “To stop your fun, if that’s what you call it.”  “I’ve a good mind to give you a thrashing.”  Gilbert put himself in a position of defense.  “Sail in, if you want to!” he responded.  “Help me, Simon!” said Peter. “You grab his legs, and I’ll upset him.”  Simon, who, though younger, was braver than Peter, without hesitation followed directions. He threw himself on the ground and grasped Gilbert by the legs, while Peter, doubling up his fists, made a rush at his enemy. But Gilbert, swiftly eluding Simon, struck out with his right arm, and Peter, unprepared for so forcible a defense, tumbled over on his back, and Simon ran to his assistance.  Gilbert put himself on guard, expecting a second attack; but Peter apparently thought it wiser to fight with his tongue.  “You rascal!” he shrieked, almost foaming at the mouth; “I’ll have you arrested.”  “What for?” asked Gilbert, coolly.  “For flying at me like a--a tiger, and trying to kill me.”  Gilbert laughed at this curious version of things.  “I thought it was you who flew at me,” he said.  “What business had you to interfere with me?”  “I’ll do it again unless you give up firing stones at the cat.”  “I’ll do it as long as I like.”  “She’s gone!” said Simon.  The boys looked up into the tree, and could see nothing of puss. She had taken the opportunity, when her assailant was otherwise occupied, to make good her escape.  “I’m glad of it!” said Gilbert. “Good-morning, boys! When we meet again, I hope you will be more creditably employed.”  “You don’t get off so easy, you loafer,” said Peter, who saw the village constable approaching. “Here, Mr. Rogers, I want you to arrest this boy.”  Constable Rogers, who was a stout, broad-shouldered man, nearly six feet in height, turned from one to the other, and asked: “What has he done?”  “He knocked me over. I want him arrested for assault and battery.”  “And what did you do?”  “I? I didn’t do anything.”  “That is rather strange. Young man, what is your name?”  “Gilbert Vance.”  “You don’t live in this town?”  “No; I live in Warren.”  “What made you attack Peter?”  “Because he flew at me, and I had to defend myself.”  “Is this so, Simon? You saw all that happened.”  “Ye--es,” admitted Simon, unwillingly.  “That puts a different face on the matter. I don’t see how I can arrest this boy. He had a right to defend himself.”  “He came up and abused me--the loafer,” said Peter.  “That was the reason you went at him?”  “Yes.”  “Have you anything to say?” asked the constable, addressing Gilbert.  “Yes, sir; when I came up I saw this boy firing stones at a cat, who had taken refuge in that tree over there. He had just hit her, and had picked up a larger stone to fire when I ordered him to drop it.”  “It was no business of yours,” muttered Peter.  “I made it my business, and will again.”  “Did the cat have a white spot on her forehead?” asked the constable.  “Yes, sir.”  “And was mouse colored?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Why, it’s my little girl’s cat. She would be heartbroken if the cat were seriously hurt. You young rascal!” he continued, turning suddenly upon Peter, and shaking him vigorously. “Let me catch you at this business again, and I’ll give you such a warming that you’ll never want to touch another cat.”  “Let me go!” cried the terrified boy. “I didn’t know it was your cat.”  “"]]]
