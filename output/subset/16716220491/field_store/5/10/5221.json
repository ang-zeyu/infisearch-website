I used to stay with the doctored alien, now Aedo, but we finally learned we could trust him to follow our orders--which were to stay inside, away from the others, since we didn't know how they would take him. So I got to walking along with Ellik.  As dusk lengthened, we could see the spark that was our ship in its orbit along the retreating horizon.  Ellik twisted back his head and the side of his mouth. \"Look at him up there--_look!_\"  The spark burned brighter and danced in another direction.  \"He's gone! He left us!\" Ellik said.  \"It's okay. He's still there. Just corrected the orbit a little, I guess.\"  \"No, no, no,\" Ellik said. \"He started to make another try. But he got afraid to try to go into hyperspace alone.\"  \"He was just correcting for orbital decay.\"  \"You don't understand, Johnny. He's a coward. That makes him dangerous. He's getting desperate. That desperation will burst the dam of his own weakness and wash away our hope, _our lives_.\"  His voice hushed. He stood staring starkly ahead, his palms outstretched at his sides.  \"Maybe he isn't _that_ cowardly,\" I said hopefully.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Finished,\" Ellik announced. He meant he had finished editing the tape showing the operation on the alien and his recovery from his blue disease, from being an Indigo to better than an Azure.  \"The transmitter is finished too,\" I said.  Ellik had suggested a way of switching the tape camera to a video converter for one of the audio communicators, and I had been able to do it easy. It took parts from both our communicators and translators too.  Ellik fitted the coiled snake of tape into place. \"This will be a great day for your people, Aedo. After our friend from heaven lands, we will be able to teach you a way to cure all of your sick, to make all the Indigos like you.\"  \"Like me? Make like me?\" Aedo said in the pidgin terrestrial that Mike Ellik had taught him.  \"Yes. We'll show them how we cured you and how all can be cured.\"  \"You make show fellow like me? Make tell make that fellow like fellow like me?\"  \"Everything's ready, Mike,\" I called.  \"That's right, Aedo,\" Mike said. \"You'll show your people the way to equality.\"  \"Make all fellow like this fellow?\" Aedo asked.  \"Shall I call in Lee?\" I asked Mike.  \"Yes, that's right, Aedo. Just right.\"  \"No,\" Aedo said.  The alien stomped the tape camera and the communicator to bits before I could get a hammerlock on him.  Ellik just stared at the complete wreck of our only means of communication with the spaceship.  \"I be much man now. I much smart. Much smart than Azure hicks and Indigo slobs. I much smart all. I much man! Not to be all same now. _No._\" The snarl hung on in Aedo's throat.  Ellik lifted his head and sort of smiled. But not quite.  \"Well,\" he said slowly and sadly, \"what could you expect in the way of gratitude from a dirty alien?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Azures did accept Aedo all right. They seem to think he must have come from some other tribe. They don't associate him with the Indigo that disappeared. No Indigo ever became an Azure before.  Of course, Azures sometimes become Indigos, we found out.  It seems there's a virus of what Ellik called pseudo-cyanosis in the air. The Azures have become a pretty resistant breed to it, while the Indigos are all easy victims. But once in a while an Azure will come down with it and turn Indigo.  Mike Ellik caught it too.  It happened pretty fast. By the time we realized what it was, he was already too stupid to finish the operation he started on himself. I had to sew him up, not very neatly.  Ellik is treated pretty much like the rest of the Indigos. So am I. He takes it all pretty calm. He can still talk a little Earth. Whenever anybody kicks him, Ellik just mutters something about, \"What can fellow expect bunch lousy creeps like those fellow?\"  I guess I'll get it too. I think I am getting it.  It won't be so bad for me. Just like maybe going around drunk all the time, not being able to think or coordinate very well.  It will be kind of bad being a member of an inferior race, but the thing I'll hate about it the most isn't that, or even leaving old Lee up there, circling around and waiting for our call forever.  No, the thing I hate is having it happen _now_, just when I'm beginning to _learn_ something.  I'm not dead sure I know just exactly what I learned, but I think maybe I do:  You get just what you damned well expected all along from a bunch of blue-blooded mongrels!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51508"],["title","The Chasers (#1)"],["body"," Cassidy grunted, heading for the hatch.  \"I was only joking.\"  \"I'm not. If we can get in that house, we'll know for sure whether or not they've developed electronic devices.\"  Halfway across the field, they were almost run down by the laughing girl and her retinue of galloping suitors, if that's what they were. She was a well-proportioned blonde whose wind-frothed tresses suggested a nymph in flight.  At the fence, they were confronted by Riva, who smiled up at Cassidy and said, \"You I was just going to come and get. Ready to play yet you are?\"  He looked away and cleared his throat. \"Not quite, Riva. We'd like to visit your house.\"  \"It's some interesting games I know. Enjoying them you'd surely be.\" Her smile, revealing even teeth that contrasted ruddy cheeks, was as persistent as her intent on playing.  Staring at the girl, Cassidy wrestled with a pang of wistful envy over the Olympian life he had witnessed thus far on this world. Maybe they were all irresponsible and childlike. But was that bad?         *       *       *       *       *  Mason pointed in alarm toward the meadow in front of the next estate. An ominous-looking, furry thing, supported on six or eight spindly legs, was racing across their field of vision.  \"Hurt you he won't,\" the girl assured them, noticing their apprehension. \"Nothing to be afraid of there is.\"  \"_What_ is it?\" Cassidy was still trying to determine whether it was an overgrown spider or a dry-land octopus.  \"Look!\" Mason exclaimed. \"It's on a leash!\"  And Cassidy noticed the thong that extended from the creature to the human who was running along behind it.  \"To Wolruf he belongs,\" the girl explained. \"One of them I can get for you too--if you want.\"  Her slender hand reached out through the fence and tugged at Cassidy's sleeve. \"To chase me wouldn't you like?\" she asked, pouting.  Glancing behind her, Cassidy spotted the girl's father bearing down on them in a sprint that was nothing short of phenomenal for his age. He began shouting with the last few strides and was in full lung when he hurled himself at the fence. \"Git! Out! Away! I'll--\"  Riva moved back and glanced overhead and Papa, seeing some hidden significance in her gesture, lowered his voice.  \"You I'll tear into and apart I'll rip!\" he went on in a menacing whisper. \"Your limbs I'll scatter like--\"  \"Papa, it's not afraid of you they are.\"  \"They're _not_?\" He was disappointed.  \"The house they want to come in and see.\"  He began working up a rage again, but caught himself and looked up into his daughter's face. \"Mean you--_my_ house they want to see?\"  When she nodded Papa seized the lowest strand of wire and lifted the fence high enough for Cassidy and Mason to crawl under. \"Why, arranged it can be, I think.\"  Its architectural prominences rendered shadowless in the tri-solar light, the manor was even more imposing close at hand. Of stone construction, it flaunted millwork and beams whose rich carvings would have been welcome on any mansion in the known Galaxy.  Mounting the steps, Mason observed, \"Nice little layout they've got here.\"  Riva moved closer to Cassidy. \"Inside is cozy,\" she said behind a coy smile. \"Play we can _really_ in there.\"  Papa had been at the door for some time, fumbling with the lock. In a burst of impatience, he drew off and gave it a solid kick. Then he went back and tried rattling the handle. After a while there was a click and it swung open.  Cassidy followed him into a blaze of iridescent color and unfamiliar form. The huge, circular room was like a vast diorama and it was impossible to tell exactly where the solid objects blended in with the jumbled geometric pattern of the wall.  He walked across a carpet of undulant fibers that reached well above his ankles. And he tripped across a padded, Z-shaped slab that protruded from the wall but slithered into a U and retracted as soon as it received the burden of his weight.  Laughing, Riva helped him up and he paused for a closer visual inspection of his outlandish surroundings. Objects of weird shapes and unguessable purposes hung from the ceiling, some changing form and size as he watched. Scattered about were articles of furniture (he guessed) that resembled giant starfish supported at their centers and extremities by coiled springs. Only, each arm was shaped like a trough that ran into the bowl-like central depression of the piece.         *       *       *       *       *  A gleeful scream sounded behind them and Papa went tearing by. With a running leap, he landed on an arm of one of the starfish. Its supporting spring contracted under the weight, then catapulted him ceilingward. When he came down again, it was on an arm of another starfish, then another.  The fourth collapsed, depositing him on the floor, and its spring went twanging across the room. Struggling to his feet, he staggered into something resembling a clothes tree, knocked it over and sprawled beside it.  He roared with delight as he snapped the stem of the thing across his knee and hurled the pieces at the ceiling. They scored direct hits on one of the bulky objects suspended overhead and it came crashing down with a twinkling roar amid a shower of sparks.  \"Yow-ee!\" he exuberated. \"So much fun I never had!\"  Riva helped him up. \"Papa, it's control yourself you must. The last time--remember?\"  But he only shook her off and went bounding through an archway. His hectic progress through the house was punctuated by sounds of crashing destruction.  \"Honestly,\" Riva said, spreading her hands, \"what to do with him I don't know.\"  Cassidy continued staring in the direction the old man had gone. \"He's wrecking the place!\"  \"That he is,\" she admitted sighing. \"And such a nice joint it be, too.\"  \"He's just plain nuts!\" said Mason.  Riva smiled. \"But it's _so_ much fun he has.\"  Cassidy moved away to get a better view of a silvery gray screen set in the wall and flanked by twin rows of dials and knobs.  \"You got stereovision, Riva?\" he asked.  Mason went over and twisted several of the controls until a soft light began suffusing the screen.  \"Ster-eo-what?\" the girl asked.  \"Video, television--pictures with sound.\"  Her face brightened. \"Pictures we got--sounds too. Right in that little window.\"  Just then Papa, uninhibited as ever, came storming back into the room with a lusty \"Ya-hoo!\" He lost his footing and crashed against the screen. Sparks shot out and the picture that was beginning to take shape faded into obscurity.  \"It that settles, Papa!\" Riva said, exasperated. \"Outside I'm going and for what happens to you I'm not responsible!\"  At the door, she paused and smiled at Cassidy. \"It'll have to be out there that we play, but no less fun will we have. Put on my best cavorting clothes I'm going to.\"  Mason turned the knobs again, but produced nothing more than the smell of burning insulation and a few snickers from Papa.  \"At least,\" Cassidy observed, \"they evidently do know something about electronics. All we have to do now is run down one of the technicians and we might get the parts we need for the stabilizer.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Outside Mason dropped down on the steps and sat with his shoulders slumping. \"Damnedest thing I've ever seen,\" he mumbled.  Cassidy paced to the edge of the porch and stared out over the field. A monstrous skimmer craft appeared in the distance, floating over toward what seemed to be a pile of trash in front of one of the estates. Twin beams of crimson light darted from the nose of the vehicle and played over the mound. In seconds, the heap had melted away and the skimmer floated on.  Wolruf was still walking his octopus-spider pet. There were now two packs of youths out chasing girls. And another skimmer car was having no difficulty surviving the stone-throwing assault of not one, but two dedicated pursuers. Outside of that, Cassidy noted, things appeared quite normal.  Mason slapped his thighs and rose. \"You go see if Riva knows how we can contact the authorities. I'm going back and stay with the ship.\"  Cassidy watched him crawl under the fence, then went around the side of the house. When he caught sight of the girl, she was just disappearing into a smaller structure that might have been a guest house or garage.  Following, he knocked on the door and called out her name anxiously.  \"To play are you ready?\" There was an eager note in her voice as it came through the panel. \"In come on. It's all set I'll be in a jiffy.\"  He turned the knob, stepped half into the room, lurched back outside and slammed the door behind him. \"_Riva!_\"  The door started to open, then closed again as the girl laughed. \"Oh, all right. Funny you be. It's to play you want, don't you?\"  He assured her that he did and added, \"But there's something we have to talk about now, Riva.\"  \"Talk, talk, talk. And it gets you where? Only wastes time, it does.\"  A moment later the door opened and she stood there smiling, with legs apart and hands on her hips. But he hardly had time to react to the skimpiness of her halter and skirt.  \"Now,\" she urged as she sprang up on her toes and kissed him full on the lips, \"like a chaser make! To the races we're off!\"  With that, she whirled and went streaking through the next room.         *       *       *       *       *  He surveyed his surroundings. It was an ordinary bedroom with conventional furnishings--perhaps a bit crude even for a culture without any space technology. But, then, it didn't seem uncharacteristic, considering the circumstances.  Recognizing the contrast between this guest house and the manor, he frowned as he started off in search of the girl. A worrisome suspicion dogged his thoughts--there had to be sense to Riva and her father and this sumptuous estate, natives who made sport of chasing skimmer craft and voluptuous women when they weren't otherwise indiscreetly occupied. But what?  In the kitchen, he discovered Riva's shapely leg protruding from behind a cabinet. He suspected the"]]]
