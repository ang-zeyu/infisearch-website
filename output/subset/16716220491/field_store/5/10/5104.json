Look how she'd demanded he turn around 'right now'!\" She was wonderful, and Jon loved her dearly. But he also knew she would be absolutely out of place trying to make their decisions about where to go, how to get there, how to run the ship, and so on. She had always seemed content to \"keep house\" on the ship, just as she had on Terra, and paid but little attention to what else was going on.  And Jak was just about as bad. The older boy was quick-and-logical thinking, and knew a lot--but not about such things. Jon had been the one who was always tagging their father around, forever asking questions about how to do this, why was that done, what did this machine do and what was the theory behind it, and so on? He had always been working with machines, almost since he could toddle. He took them apart, not destructively but questioningly, and was very soon able to put back together again correctly an endless succession of ever-more-complicated mechanisms.  Recently he had begun the study of astrogation--he had also long been a \"math shark\"--and now knew enough to realize how little he really did know about this complicated subject--although actually it was a great deal.  Sobered, and suddenly aware of a growing maturity brought on by the terrific problems they faced, Jon sat up. He rose and went over to his mother's side. He touched her softly on the shoulder, and she looked up at him. At sight of his anxious face she threw her arms about him.  \"Jon, boy, what will we do now? How will we ever manage without Mr. C?\"  At this echo of his own questionings and doubts, the boy straightened. \"We'll make out all right, Mom,\" he said with a bravado he certainly did not feel, but which he hoped she would think was genuine. \"We'll have to make up our minds what we're going to do, then do it. We'll keep on with Pop's plans, of course.\" This was a statement rather than a question.  \"Why ... why....\" She seemed startled by the realization that she had to make a decision. \"I hadn't thought about that yet.\" She was silent a moment, then turned to her elder son, who had also risen and was listening intently. \"What do you think, Jak? You're older, so you'll have to take charge now and be the man of the family.\"  The slender, studious eighteen-year-old looked startled. \"I ... I don't know,\" he stammered, his eyes suddenly filled with strange fears. \"I ... I suppose we might as well go home. We don't know where we're going, or what we were to do when we got there....\" He suddenly looked like a little boy who has lost everything and everyone in whom he had looked for and found comfort and security. \"Don't ask me, Mother. I don't know what we're going to do. We're apt to die, without Father to keep us going safely!\"  Jon stared at him, this brother he had always loved and to whom he had looked up as a strong, elder companion ... in spite of their almost continuous, although friendly, bickerings, which never disturbed the warm affection underneath.  Now he just couldn't believe his eyes and ears. This couldn't be Jak--the strong, reliable Jak!  Suddenly he felt a surge of anger and distrust. Yet immediately he was ashamed of himself for such feelings. This wasn't any minnow of a predicament they were in--it was a very whale of a mess. He was scared, himself, and could understand just how Jak must feel. But, by the great horned catfish, he wasn't going to let himself cry about it any more--especially in front of Mom! Something had to be done, and it would be done!  A thought flashed through his mind, and he straightened with resolve. \"_Shut up!_\" he yelled at his brother ... and when Jak and their mother stared at him in amazement Jon grinned calmly and said, half apologetically, \"Just trying to snap you out of the dumps. I say we've got to think this out carefully, and not make any snap decisions--or give up like this. The ship's on automatic drive and decelerating, so we don't have to worry about running it for some time. But Pop wouldn't like it if we didn't keep on. You know how important this trip is to him. Besides, he'll be waking up soon, and even if he has to stay in his bunk, he can tell us what to do.\"  \"Do you know where we're going, and why?\" Jak was still upset.  \"Sure. Pop talked with me a lot about it.\"  Their mother looked from one to the other doubtfully, then smiled in a constrained manner. \"You ... you're probably right, Jon. Mr. C. did say this would make or break us. I leave it up to my two big boys to discuss and suggest plans until your father is able to take charge again.\"  With an effort she pulled herself together, and now her smile was firmer, brighter. \"Meanwhile, I think we'd better have something to eat. We have to keep up our strength for whatever is coming, you know.\"     2   When the boys woke up the next morning, their mother reported that their father had apparently had a restful night, coming out of his coma briefly a couple of times.  After breakfast the two boys went into the control room and began examining the various instruments and recorders on the panel, to see if they could figure out how much longer it would take them to reach the system their father was seeking. Through the visiplates they could now see not only the sun toward which Jon said they were heading, but even its nearer planets were beginning to show appreciable discs.  As they were studying these, Jak suddenly asked, \"How do you suppose we happened to run into a meteor way out here in space like that?\"  Jon shook his head helplessly. \"Darned if I can figure it out. I always supposed such stuff was only found inside a planetary system. Must be there's some in deep space, though, since we sure as perch got hit by one.\" He reached in his pocket and pulled out a small marble-sized stone. \"Here it is. I hunted around and found it last night. It dented the farther bulkhead, but must have lost so much momentum it couldn't penetrate.\"  \"Just one of those billions-to-one chances, eh?\" Jak looked up from his examination of the stone.  \"Yes, there's still so much about space nobody knows yet.\"  Jak thought silently for a moment, then asked, \"Well, what do you think we should do next?\"  \"Keep going, natch.\" Jon's voice was earnest. \"We can't be more than a couple of days away from the nearest planets--and we're over six weeks out of Terra. Pop said this system we're heading for has four or five planets, at least, and that probably Two and Three, and maybe Four, would be fairly Earthlike and habitable. So long as we're so close, it would be wrong if we didn't at least take a close-up looksee at them.\"  \"Yes,\" slowly, \"Father'd want us to do that.\"  \"You know darned well he would. He's sunk almost everything he's got into this ship and this trip, and if we miss now, the government probably wouldn't give us another exclusive crack at it, even if we could scrape up the credits to come out here again.\"  \"Didn't Father say something the other day about his spectro-analyzer--you know, 'Annie'--showing there was...?\"  \"Yes, 'Annie' popped up strong on that, and that's another reason we've got to keep going--especially since you think Pop'll snap out of it in a few days. You're sure of that, aren't you?\" He peered intently into his brother's eyes.  \"Yes, as far as I can tell. There's a concussion where his head hit the floor, but I don't think it's too bad, and it should wear off soon.\"  Jon sighed with relief. \"If ... if he was dead, or dying, it would be different, and I'd say go home. But there's another thing. Before we left Terra we heard a rumor Slik Bogin was chasing around out in this sector, and we don't want to let him beat us to this system.\"  \"Bogin? That's the notorious pirate, isn't it? No, if he's out here, we don't want to let him beat us--though what we could do if he did try, I don't know.\"  \"We'll figure that out if he tries to hijack us.\"  \"You hope!\" There was a long silence while the boys studied their instruments again. Then, \"What about landing, Chubby? Can you do it?\"  \"I've been studying up on it--put on the sleep-instructor last night.\" Jon was suddenly half-frightened with the prospect, but determined to keep his voice level. \"I've helped Pop land the crate several times--even handled the controls under his instructions--so I think I can do it, with you reading off the manual to me. Anyway, if--if Pop gets worse, we've got to land some time, so we might as well try it here as any time or anywhere.\"  Jak stood silent a long moment, rubbing his hand through his hair as he did when concentrating. Then he looked up with determination. \"Jon, you and I have got ourselves a job to do.\" And now his voice was steady and earnest. \"It's up to us to take care of Mother and keep her from worrying. So, whenever we're where she can hear us, we've got to act brave and sure of ourselves, no matter how we feel inside.\"  \"Yes, she's all broken up about Pop. We ought to do most of the work, too, so she....\"  \"No,\" Jak shook his head, \"that'd be the worst thing we could do. She isn't sick, physically, and if she keeps busy, she won't have time to worry so much. So we must keep her from having too much idle time.\"  \"Oh ... maybe you're right, Owl ... yes, guess you are, at that--that's more your dish. But we can act like everything's going to jet fair. It's a deal.\" He held out his hand, and the two brothers clasped in agreement.  They went into the living quarters. \"Hi, Mom, lunch ready yet? I'm starved.\"  \"As usual,\" Jak bantered.  Mrs. Carver looked up apathetically from the recline seat where she had been sitting, worrying, during the several hours the boys had been in the control room. She looked as though she were almost shocked at their seemingly heartless question, forgetting that she, herself, had used the same excuse the night before.  But in a moment she smiled tremulously. \"I guess I let myself forget my job, and that we have to go through the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/507"],["title","Adam Bede (#1)"],["body","ht, I should think. Ye’ll do finely t’ lead the singin’. But I don’ know what Parson Irwine ’ull say at his gran’ favright Adam Bede a-turnin’ Methody.”  “Never do you bother yourself about me, Ben. I’m not a-going to turn Methodist any more nor you are—though it’s like enough you’ll turn to something worse. Mester Irwine’s got more sense nor to meddle wi’ people’s doing as they like in religion. That’s between themselves and God, as he’s said to me many a time.”  “Aye, aye; but he’s none so fond o’ your dissenters, for all that.”  “Maybe; I’m none so fond o’ Josh Tod’s thick ale, but I don’t hinder you from making a fool o’ yourself wi’t.”  There was a laugh at this thrust of Adam’s, but Seth said, very seriously. “Nay, nay, Addy, thee mustna say as anybody’s religion’s like thick ale. Thee dostna believe but what the dissenters and the Methodists have got the root o’ the matter as well as the church folks.”  “Nay, Seth, lad; I’m not for laughing at no man’s religion. Let ’em follow their consciences, that’s all. Only I think it ’ud be better if their consciences ’ud let ’em stay quiet i’ the church—there’s a deal to be learnt there. And there’s such a thing as being oversperitial; we must have something beside Gospel i’ this world. Look at the canals, an’ th’ aqueduc’s, an’ th’ coal-pit engines, and Arkwright’s mills there at Cromford; a man must learn summat beside Gospel to make them things, I reckon. But t’ hear some o’ them preachers, you’d think as a man must be doing nothing all’s life but shutting’s eyes and looking what’s agoing on inside him. I know a man must have the love o’ God in his soul, and the Bible’s God’s word. But what does the Bible say? Why, it says as God put his sperrit into the workman as built the tabernacle, to make him do all the carved work and things as wanted a nice hand. And this is my way o’ looking at it: there’s the sperrit o’ God in all things and all times—weekday as well as Sunday—and i’ the great works and inventions, and i’ the figuring and the mechanics. And God helps us with our headpieces and our hands as well as with our souls; and if a man does bits o’ jobs out o’ working hours—builds a oven for ’s wife to save her from going to the bakehouse, or scrats at his bit o’ garden and makes two potatoes grow istead o’ one, he’s doin’ more good, and he’s just as near to God, as if he was running after some preacher and a-praying and a-groaning.”  “Well done, Adam!” said Sandy Jim, who had paused from his planing to shift his planks while Adam was speaking; “that’s the best sarmunt I’ve heared this long while. By th’ same token, my wife’s been a-plaguin’ on me to build her a oven this twelvemont.”  “There’s reason in what thee say’st, Adam,” observed Seth, gravely. “But thee know’st thyself as it’s hearing the preachers thee find’st so much fault with has turned many an idle fellow into an industrious un. It’s the preacher as empties th’ alehouse; and if a man gets religion, he’ll do his work none the worse for that.”  “On’y he’ll lave the panels out o’ th’ doors sometimes, eh, Seth?” said Wiry Ben.  “Ah, Ben, you’ve got a joke again’ me as ’ll last you your life. But it isna religion as was i’ fault there; it was Seth Bede, as was allays a wool-gathering chap, and religion hasna cured him, the more’s the pity.”  “Ne’er heed me, Seth,” said Wiry Ben, “y’ are a down-right good-hearted chap, panels or no panels; an’ ye donna set up your bristles at every bit o’ fun, like some o’ your kin, as is mayhap cliverer.”  “Seth, lad,” said Adam, taking no notice of the sarcasm against himself, “thee mustna take me unkind. I wasna driving at thee in what I said just now. Some ’s got one way o’ looking at things and some ’s got another.”  “Nay, nay, Addy, thee mean’st me no unkindness,” said Seth, “I know that well enough. Thee’t like thy dog Gyp—thee bark’st at me sometimes, but thee allays lick’st my hand after.”  All hands worked on in silence for some minutes, until the church clock began to strike six. Before the first stroke had died away, Sandy Jim had loosed his plane and was reaching his jacket; Wiry Ben had left a screw half driven in, and thrown his screwdriver into his tool-basket; Mum Taft, who, true to his name, had kept silence throughout the previous conversation, had flung down his hammer as he was in the act of lifting it; and Seth, too, had straightened his back, and was putting out his hand towards his paper cap. Adam alone had gone on with his work as if nothing had happened. But observing the cessation of the tools, he looked up, and said, in a tone of indignation, “Look there, now! I can’t abide to see men throw away their tools i’ that way, the minute the clock begins to strike, as if they took no pleasure i’ their work and was afraid o’ doing a stroke too much.”  Seth looked a little conscious, and began to be slower in his preparations for going, but Mum Taft broke silence, and said, “Aye, aye, Adam lad, ye talk like a young un. When y’ are six-an’-forty like me, istid o’ six-an’-twenty, ye wonna be so flush o’ workin’ for nought.”  “Nonsense,” said Adam, still wrathful; “what’s age got to do with it, I wonder? Ye arena getting stiff yet, I reckon. I hate to see a man’s arms drop down as if he was shot, before the clock’s fairly struck, just as if he’d never a bit o’ pride and delight in ’s work. The very grindstone ’ull go on turning a bit after you loose it.”  “Bodderation, Adam!” exclaimed Wiry Ben; “lave a chap aloon, will ’ee? Ye war afinding faut wi’ preachers a while agoo—y’ are fond enough o’ preachin’ yoursen. Ye may like work better nor play, but I like play better nor work; that’ll ’commodate ye—it laves ye th’ more to do.”  With this exit speech, which he considered effective, Wiry Ben shouldered his basket and left the workshop, quickly followed by Mum Taft and Sandy Jim. Seth lingered, and looked wistfully at Adam, as if he expected him to say something.  “Shalt go home before thee go’st to the preaching?” Adam asked, looking up.  “Nay; I’ve got my hat and things at Will Maskery’s. I shan’t be home before going for ten. I’ll happen see Dinah Morris safe home, if she’s willing. There’s nobody comes with her from Poyser’s, thee know’st.”  “Then I’ll tell mother not to look for thee,” said Adam.  “Thee artna going to Poyser’s thyself to-night?” said Seth rather timidly, as he turned to leave the workshop.  “Nay, I’m going to th’ school.”  Hitherto Gyp had kept his comfortable bed, only lifting up his head and watching Adam more closely as he noticed the other workmen departing. But no sooner did Adam put his ruler in his pocket, and begin to twist his apron round his waist, than Gyp ran forward and looked up in his master’s face with patient expectation. If Gyp had had a tail he would doubtless have wagged it, but being destitute of that vehicle for his emotions, he was like many other worthy personages, destined to appear more phlegmatic than nature had made him.  “What! Art ready for the basket, eh, Gyp?” said Adam, with the same gentle modulation of voice as when he spoke to Seth.  Gyp jumped and gave a short bark, as much as to say, “Of course.” Poor fellow, he had not a great range of expression.  The basket was the one which on workdays held Adam’s and Seth’s dinner; and no official, walking in procession, could look more resolutely unconscious of all acquaintances than Gyp with his basket, trotting at his master’s heels.  On leaving the workshop Adam locked the door, took the key out, and carried it to the house on the other side of the woodyard. It was a low house, with smooth grey thatch and buff walls, looking pleasant and mellow in the evening light. The leaded windows were bright and speckless, and the door-stone was as clean as a white boulder at ebb tide. On the door-stone stood a clean old woman, in a dark-striped linen gown, a red kerchief, and a linen cap, talking to some speckled fowls which appeared to have been drawn towards her by an illusory expectation of cold potatoes or barley. The old woman’s sight seemed to be dim, for she did not recognize Adam till he said, “Here’s the key, Dolly; lay it down for me in the house, will you?”  “Aye, sure; but wunna ye come in, Adam? Miss Mary’s i’ th’ house, and Mester Burge ’ull be back anon; he’d be glad t’ ha’ ye to supper wi’m, I’ll be’s warrand.”  “No, Dolly, thank you; I’m off home. Good evening.”  Adam hastened with long strides, Gyp close to his heels, out of the workyard, and along the highroad leading away from the village and down to the valley. As he reached the foot of the slope, an elderly horseman, with his portmanteau strapped behind him, stopped his horse when Adam had passed him, and turned round to have another long look at the stalwart workman in paper cap, leather breeches, and dark-blue worsted stockings.  Adam, unconscious of the admiration he was exciting, presently struck across the fields, and now broke out into the tune which had all day long been running in his head:  Let all thy converse be sincere, Thy conscience as the noonday clear; For God’s all-seeing eye surveys Thy secret thoughts, thy works and ways.     Chapter II The Preaching   About a quarter to seven there was an unusual appearance of excitement in the village of Hayslope, and through the whole length of its little street, from the Donnithorne Arms to the churchyard gate, the inhabitants had evidently been drawn out of their houses by something more than the pleasure of lounging in the evening sunshine. The Donnithorne Arms stood at the entrance of the village, and a small farmyard and stackyard which flanked it, indicating that there was a pretty take of land attached to the inn, gave the traveller a promise of good feed for himself and his horse, which might well console him for the ignorance in which the weather-beaten sign left him as to the heraldic bearings of that ancient family, the Donnithornes.
