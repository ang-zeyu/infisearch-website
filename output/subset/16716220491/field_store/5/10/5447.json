You'll love that Four Winds light, Anne.  It's a revolving one, and it flashes like a magnificent star through the twilights.  We can see it from our living room windows and our front door.\"  \"Who owns the house?\"  \"Well, it's the property of the Glen St. Mary Presbyterian Church now, and I rented it from the trustees.  But it belonged until lately to a very old lady, Miss Elizabeth Russell.  She died last spring, and as she had no near relatives she left her property to the Glen St. Mary Church.  Her furniture is still in the house, and I bought most of it--for a mere song you might say, because it was all so old-fashioned that the trustees despaired of selling it.  Glen St. Mary folks prefer plush brocade and sideboards with mirrors and ornamentations, I fancy. But Miss Russell's furniture is very good and I feel sure you'll like it, Anne.\"  \"So far, good,\" said Anne, nodding cautious approval.  \"But, Gilbert, people cannot live by furniture alone.  You haven't yet mentioned one very important thing.  Are there TREES about this house?\"  \"Heaps of them, oh, dryad!  There is a big grove of fir trees behind it, two rows of Lombardy poplars down the lane, and a ring of white birches around a very delightful garden.  Our front door opens right into the garden, but there is another entrance--a little gate hung between two firs.  The hinges are on one trunk and the catch on the other.  Their boughs form an arch overhead.\"  \"Oh, I'm so glad!  I couldn't live where there were no trees--something vital in me would starve.  Well, after that, there's no use asking you if there's a brook anywhere near.  THAT would be expecting too much.\"  \"But there IS a brook--and it actually cuts across one corner of the garden.\"  \"Then,\" said Anne, with a long sigh of supreme satisfaction, \"this house you have found IS my house of dreams and none other.\"    CHAPTER 3  THE LAND OF DREAMS AMONG  \"Have you made up your mind who you're going to have to the wedding, Anne?\" asked Mrs. Rachel Lynde, as she hemstitched table napkins industriously.  \"It's time your invitations were sent, even if they are to be only informal ones.\"  \"I don't mean to have very many,\" said Anne.  \"We just want those we love best to see us married.  Gilbert's people, and Mr. and Mrs. Allan, and Mr. and Mrs. Harrison.\"  \"There was a time when you'd hardly have numbered Mr. Harrison among your dearest friends,\" said Marilla drily.  \"Well, I wasn't VERY strongly attracted to him at our first meeting,\" acknowledged Anne, with a laugh over the recollection.  \"But Mr. Harrison has improved on acquaintance, and Mrs. Harrison is really a dear.  Then, of course, there are Miss Lavendar and Paul.\"  \"Have they decided to come to the Island this summer?  I thought they were going to Europe.\"  \"They changed their minds when I wrote them I was going to be married. I had a letter from Paul today.  He says he MUST come to my wedding, no matter what happens to Europe.\"  \"That child always idolised you,\" remarked Mrs. Rachel.  \"That 'child' is a young man of nineteen now, Mrs. Lynde.\"  \"How time does fly!\" was Mrs. Lynde's brilliant and original response.  \"Charlotta the Fourth may come with them.  She sent word by Paul that she would come if her husband would let her.  I wonder if she still wears those enormous blue bows, and whether her husband calls her Charlotta or Leonora.  I should love to have Charlotta at my wedding. Charlotta and I were at a wedding long syne.  They expect to be at Echo Lodge next week.  Then there are Phil and the Reverend Jo----\"  \"It sounds awful to hear you speaking of a minister like that, Anne,\" said Mrs. Rachel severely.  \"His wife calls him that.\"  \"She should have more respect for his holy office, then,\" retorted Mrs. Rachel.  \"I've heard you criticise ministers pretty sharply yourself,\" teased Anne.  \"Yes, but I do it reverently,\" protested Mrs. Lynde.  \"You never heard me NICKNAME a minister.\"  Anne smothered a smile.  \"Well, there are Diana and Fred and little Fred and Small Anne Cordelia--and Jane Andrews.  I wish I could have Miss Stacey and Aunt Jamesina and Priscilla and Stella.  But Stella is in Vancouver, and Pris is in Japan, and Miss Stacey is married in California, and Aunt Jamesina has gone to India to explore her daughter's mission field, in spite of her horror of snakes.  It's really dreadful--the way people get scattered over the globe.\"  \"The Lord never intended it, that's what,\" said Mrs. Rachel authoritatively.  \"In my young days people grew up and married and settled down where they were born, or pretty near it.  Thank goodness you've stuck to the Island, Anne.  I was afraid Gilbert would insist on rushing off to the ends of the earth when he got through college, and dragging you with him.\"  \"If everybody stayed where he was born places would soon be filled up, Mrs. Lynde.\"  \"Oh, I'm not going to argue with you, Anne.  _I_ am not a B.A.  What time of the day is the ceremony to be?\"  \"We have decided on noon--high noon, as the society reporters say. That will give us time to catch the evening train to Glen St. Mary.\"  \"And you'll be married in the parlor?\"  \"No--not unless it rains.  We mean to be married in the orchard--with the blue sky over us and the sunshine around us.  Do you know when and where I'd like to be married, if I could?  It would be at dawn--a June dawn, with a glorious sunrise, and roses blooming in the gardens; and I would slip down and meet Gilbert and we would go together to the heart of the beech woods,--and there, under the green arches that would be like a splendid cathedral, we would be married.\"  Marilla sniffed scornfully and Mrs. Lynde looked shocked.  \"But that would be terrible queer, Anne.  Why, it wouldn't really seem legal.  And what would Mrs. Harmon Andrews say?\"  \"Ah, there's the rub,\" sighed Anne.  \"There are so many things in life we cannot do because of the fear of what Mrs. Harmon Andrews would say. ''Tis true, 'tis pity, and pity 'tis, 'tis true.'  What delightful things we might do were it not for Mrs. Harmon Andrews!\"  \"By times, Anne, I don't feel quite sure that I understand you altogether,\" complained Mrs. Lynde.  \"Anne was always romantic, you know,\" said Marilla apologetically.  \"Well, married life will most likely cure her of that,\" Mrs. Rachel responded comfortingly.  Anne laughed and slipped away to Lover's Lane, where Gilbert found her; and neither of them seemed to entertain much fear, or hope, that their married life would cure them of romance.  The Echo Lodge people came over the next week, and Green Gables buzzed with the delight of them.  Miss Lavendar had changed so little that the three years since her last Island visit might have been a watch in the night; but Anne gasped with amazement over Paul.  Could this splendid six feet of manhood be the little Paul of Avonlea schooldays?  \"You really make me feel old, Paul,\" said Anne.  \"Why, I have to look up to you!\"  \"You'll never grow old, Teacher,\" said Paul.  \"You are one of the fortunate mortals who have found and drunk from the Fountain of Youth,--you and Mother Lavendar.  See here!  When you're married I WON'T call you Mrs. Blythe.  To me you'll always be 'Teacher'--the teacher of the best lessons I ever learned.  I want to show you something.\"  The \"something\" was a pocketbook full of poems.  Paul had put some of his beautiful fancies into verse, and magazine editors had not been as unappreciative as they are sometimes supposed to be.  Anne read Paul's poems with real delight.  They were full of charm and promise.  \"You'll be famous yet, Paul.  I always dreamed of having one famous pupil.  He was to be a college president--but a great poet would be even better.  Some day I'll be able to boast that I whipped the distinguished Paul Irving.  But then I never did whip you, did I, Paul? What an opportunity lost!  I think I kept you in at recess, however.\"  \"You may be famous yourself, Teacher.  I've seen a good deal of your work these last three years.\"  \"No.  I know what I can do.  I can write pretty, fanciful little sketches that children love and editors send welcome cheques for.  But I can do nothing big.  My only chance for earthly immortality is a corner in your Memoirs.\"  Charlotta the Fourth had discarded the blue bows but her freckles were not noticeably less.  \"I never did think I'd come down to marrying a Yankee, Miss Shirley, ma'am,\" she said.  \"But you never know what's before you, and it isn't his fault.  He was born that way.\"  \"You're a Yankee yourself, Charlotta, since you've married one.\"  \"Miss Shirley, ma'am, I'm NOT!  And I wouldn't be if I was to marry a dozen Yankees!  Tom's kind of nice.  And besides, I thought I'd better not be too hard to please, for I mightn't get another chance.  Tom don't drink and he don't growl because he has to work between meals, and when all's said and done I'm satisfied, Miss Shirley, ma'am.\"  \"Does he call you Leonora?\" asked Anne.  \"Goodness, no, Miss Shirley, ma'am.  I wouldn't know who he meant if he did.  Of course, when we got married he had to say, 'I take thee, Leonora,' and I declare to you, Miss Shirley, ma'am, I've had the most dreadful feeling ever since that it wasn't me he was talking to and I haven't been rightly married at all.  And so you're going to be married yourself, Miss Shirley, ma'am?  I always thought I'd like to marry a doctor.  It would be so handy when the children had measles and croup. Tom is only a bricklayer, but he's real good-tempered.  When I said to him, says I, 'Tom, can I go to Miss Shirley's wedding?  I mean to go anyhow, but I'd like to have your consent,' he just says, 'Suit yourself, Charlotta, and you'll suit me.'  That's a real pleasant kind of husband to have, Miss Shirley, ma'am.\"  Philippa and her Reverend Jo arrived at Green Gables the day before the wedding.  Anne and Phil had a rapturous meeting which presently simmered down"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5440"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 02 (#1)"],["body"," a sign from Paaker, who preceded the princess, and who drove his fiery black Syrian horses with so heavy a hand that the bloody foam fell from their bits.  When the Mohar had given the reins into the hand of a servant, he sprang from his chariot, and after the usual form of obeisance said to the princess:  \"In this valley lies the loathsome den of the people, to whom thou, O princess, dost deign to do such high honor.  Permit me to go forward as guide to thy party.\"  \"We will go on foot,\" said the princess, \"and leave our followers behind here,\"  Paaker bowed, Bent-Anat threw the reins to her charioteer and sprang to the ground, the wife of Mena and the courtiers left their litters, and the fan-bearers and chamberlains were about to accompany their mistress on foot into the little valley, when she turned round and ordered, \"Remain behind, all of you.  Only Paaker and Nefert need go with me.\"  The princess hastened forward into the gorge, which was oppressive with the noon-tide heat; but she moderated her steps as soon as she observed that the frailer Nefert found it difficult to follow her.  At a bend in the road Paaker stood still, and with him Bent-Anat and Nefert.  Neither of them had spoken a word during their walk.  The valley was perfectly still and deserted; on the highest pinnacles of the cliff, which rose perpendicularly to the right, sat a long row of vultures, as motionless as if the mid-day heat had taken all strength out of their wings.  Paaker bowed before them as being the sacred animals of the Great Goddess of Thebes,       [She formed a triad with Anion and Chunsu under the name of Muth.      The great \"Sanctuary of the kingdom\"--the temple of Karnak--was      dedicated to them.]  and the two women silently followed his example.  \"There,\" said the Mohar, pointing to two huts close to the left cliff of the valley, built of bricks made of dried Nile-mud, \"there, the neatest, next the cave in the rock.\"  Bent-Anat went towards the solitary hovel with a beating heart; Paaker let the ladies go first.  A few steps brought them to an ill-constructed fence of canestalks, palm-branches, briars and straw, roughly thrown together.  A heart-rending cry of pain from within the hut trembled in the air and arrested the steps of the two women.  Nefert staggered and clung to her stronger companion, whose beating heart she seemed to hear. Both stood a few minutes as if spellbound, then the princess called Paaker, and said:  \"You go first into the house.\"  Paaker bowed to the ground.  \"I will call the man out,\" he said, \"but how dare we step over his threshold.  Thou knowest such a proceeding will defile us.\"  Nefert looked pleadingly at Bent-Anat, but the princess repeated her command.  \"Go before me; I have no fear of defilement.\"  The Mohar still hesitated.  \"Wilt thou provoke the Gods?--and defile thyself?\"  But the princess let him say no more; she signed to Nefert, who raised her hands in horror and aversion; so, with a shrug of her shoulders, she left her companion behind with the Mohar, and stepped through an opening in the hedge into a little court, where lay two brown goats; a donkey with his forelegs tied together stood by, and a few hens were scattering the dust about in a vain search for food.  Soon she stood, alone, before the door of the paraschites' hovel.  No one perceived her, but she could not take her eyes-accustomed only to scenes of order and splendor--from the gloomy but wonderfully strange picture, which riveted her attention and her sympathy.  At last she went up to the doorway, which was too low for her tall figure.  Her heart shrunk painfully within her, and she would have wished to grow smaller, and, instead of shining in splendor, to have found herself wrapped in a beggar's robe.  Could she step into this hovel decked with gold and jewels as if in mockery?--like a tyrant who should feast at a groaning table and compel the starving to look on at the banquet.  Her delicate perception made her feel what trenchant discord her appearance offered to all that surrounded her, and the discord pained her; for she could not conceal from herself that misery and external meanness were here entitled to give the key-note and that her magnificence derived no especial grandeur from contrast with all these modest accessories, amid dust, gloom, and suffering, but rather became disproportionate and hideous, like a giant among pigmies.  She had already gone too far to turn back, or she would willingly have done so.  The longer she gazed into the but, the more deeply she felt the impotence of her princely power, the nothingness of the splendid gifts with which she approached it, and that she might not tread the dusty floor of this wretched hovel but in all humility, and to crave a pardon.  The room into which she looked was low but not very small, and obtained from two cross lights a strange and unequal illumination; on one side the light came through the door, and on the other through an opening in the time-worn ceiling of the room, which had never before harbored so many and such different guests.  All attention was concentrated on a group, which was clearly lighted up from the doorway.  On the dusty floor of the room cowered an old woman, with dark weather- beaten features and tangled hair that had long been grey.  Her black-blue cotton shirt was open over her withered bosom, and showed a blue star tattooed upon it.  In her lap she supported with her hands the head of a girl, whose slender body lay motionless on a narrow, ragged mat.  The little white feet of the sick girl almost touched the threshold.  Near to them squatted a benevolent-looking old man, who wore only a coarse apron, and sitting all in a heap, bent forward now and then, rubbing the child's feet with his lean hands and muttering a few words to himself.  The sufferer wore nothing but a short petticoat of coarse light-blue stuff.  Her face, half resting on the lap of the old woman, was graceful and regular in form, her eyes were half shut-like those of a child, whose soul is wrapped in some sweet dream-but from her finely chiselled lips there escaped from time to time a painful, almost convulsive sob.  An abundance of soft, but disordered reddish fair hair, in which clung a few withered flowers, fell over the lap of the old woman and on to the mat where she lay.  Her cheeks were white and rosy-red, and when the young surgeon Nebsecht--who sat by her side, near his blind, stupid companion, the litany-singer--lifted the ragged cloth that had been thrown over her bosom, which had been crushed by the chariot wheel, or when she lifted her slender arm, it was seen that she had the shining fairness of those daughters of the north who not unfrequently came to Thebes among the king's prisoners of war.  The two physicians sent hither from the House of Seti sat on the left side of the maiden on a little carpet.  From time to time one or the other laid his hand over the heart of the sufferer, or listened to her breathing, or opened his case of medicaments, and moistened the compress on her wounded breast with a white ointment.  In a wide circle close to the wall of the room crouched several women, young and old, friends of the paraschites, who from time to time gave expression to their deep sympathy by a piercing cry of lamentation.  One of them rose at regular intervals to fill the earthen bowl by the side of the physician with fresh water.  As often as the sudden coolness of a fresh compress on her hot bosom startled the sick girl, she opened her eyes, but always soon to close them again for longer interval, and turned them at first in surprise, and then with gentle reverence, towards a particular spot.  These glances had hitherto been unobserved by him to whom they were directed.  Leaning against the wall on the right hand side of the room, dressed in his long, snow-white priest's robe, Pentaur stood awaiting the princess. His head-dress touched the ceiling, and the narrow streak of light, which fell through the opening in the roof, streamed on his handsome head and his breast, while all around him was veiled in twilight gloom.  Once more the suffering girl looked up, and her glance this time met the eye of the young priest, who immediately raised his hand, and half- mechanically, in a low voice, uttered the words of blessing; and then once more fixed his gaze on the dingy floor, and pursued his own reflections.  Some hours since he had come hither, obedient to the orders of Ameni, to impress on the princess that she had defiled herself by touching a paraschites, and could only be cleansed again by the hand of the priests.  He had crossed the threshold of the paraschites most reluctantly, and the thought that he, of all men, had been selected to censure a deed of the noblest humanity, and to bring her who had done it to judgment, weighed upon him as a calamity.  In his intercourse with his friend Nebsecht, Pentaur had thrown off many fetters, and given place to many thoughts that his master would have held sinful and presumptuous; but at the same time he acknowledged the sanctity of the old institutions, which were upheld by those whom lie had learned to regard as the divinely-appointed guardians of the spiritual possessions of God's people; nor was he wholly free from the pride of caste and the haughtiness which, with prudent intent, were inculcated in the priests.  He held the common man, who put forth his strength to win a maintenance for his belongings by honest bodily labor--the merchant--the artizan--the peasant, nay even the warrior, as far beneath the godly brotherhood who strove for only spiritual ends; and most of all he scorned the idler, given up to sensual enjoyments.  He held him unclean who had been branded by the law; and how should it have been otherwise?  These people, who at the embalming of the dead opened the body of the deceased, had become despised for their office of mutilating the sacred temple of the soul; but no"]]]
