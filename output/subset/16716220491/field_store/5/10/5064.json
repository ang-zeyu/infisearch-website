And how and wherefore I do not describe my method of remaining under water and how long I can remain without eating. And I do not publish nor divulge these, by reason of the evil nature of men, who would use them for assassinations at the bottom of the sea by destroying ships, and sinking them, together with the men in them. Nevertheless I will impart others, which are not dangerous because the mouth of the tube through which you breathe is above the water, supported on air sacks or cork.

When you put together the science of the motions of water, remember to include under each proposition its application and use, in order that this science may not be useless.--  [Footnote: A comparatively small portion of Leonardo's notes on water-power was published at Bologna in 1828, under the title: \"_Del moto e misura dell'Acqua, di L. da Vinci_\".]  Admonition to readers.  3.  Let no man who is not a Mathematician read the elements of my work.  The disorder in the MSS.  4.  Begun at Florence, in the house of Piero di Braccio Martelli, on the 22nd day of March 1508. And this is to be a collection without order, taken from many papers which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they may treat. But I believe that before I am at the end of this [task] I shall have to repeat the same things several times; for which, O reader! do not blame me, for the subjects are many and memory cannot retain them [all] and say: 'I will not write this because I wrote it before.' And if I wished to avoid falling into this fault, it would be necessary in every case when I wanted to copy [a passage] that, not to repeat myself, I should read over all that had gone before; and all the more since the intervals are long between one time of writing and the next.  [Footnote: 1. In the history of Florence in the early part of the XVIth century _Piero di Braccio Martelli_ is frequently mentioned as _Commissario della Signoria_. He was famous for his learning and at his death left four books on Mathematics ready for the press; comp.

I don't expect to be on any nine this year.\"  \"I know, Sam, but Tom, here, has promised to play if he can possibly get the time.\"  \"And so I will play,\" said Tom. \"That is, provided I remain at Brill.\"  \"What, do you mean to say you are going to leave!\" cried several students.  \"We can't do without you, Tom,\" added Songbird.  \"Of course we can't,\" came from Bob Grimes. \"We need Tom the worst way this year.\"  \"Well, I'll talk that over with you fellows some other time. To-night we are in a hurry.\" And thus speaking, Tom tapped his brother on the shoulder, and both left the dining-room.  As my old readers know, the Rover boys possessed a very fine automobile. This was kept in one of the new garages on the place, which was presided over by Abner Filbury, the son of the old man who had worked for years around the dormitories.  \"Is she all ready, Ab?\" questioned Tom, as the young man came forward to greet them.  \"Yes, sir, I filled her up with gas and oil, and she's in apple-pie order.\"  \"Why, Tom!\" broke in Sam, in surprise. \"You must have given this order before supper.\"  \"I did,\" and Tom grinned at his younger brother. \"I took it for granted that you would make the trip.\" And thus speaking, Tom leaped into the driver's seat of the new touring car. Then Sam took his place beside his brother, and in a moment more the car was gliding out of the garage, and down the curving, gravel path leading to the highway running from Ashton past Brill College to Hope Seminary.  As Tom had predicted, it was a clear night, with the full moon just showing over the distant hills. Swinging into the highway, Tom increased the speed and was soon running at twenty-five to thirty miles an hour.  \"Don't run too fast,\" cautioned Sam. \"Remember this road has several dangerous curves in it, and remember, too, a good many of the countrymen around here don't carry lights when they drive.\"  \"Oh, I'll be careful,\" returned Tom, lightly. \"But about the lights, I think some of the countrymen ought to be fined for driving in the darkness as they do. I think----\"  \"Hark! what sort of a noise is that?\" interrupted the younger Rover.  Both boys strained their ears. A shrill honk of a horn had been followed by a heavy rumble, and now, around a curve of the road, shot the beams from a single headlight perched on a heavy auto-truck. This huge truck was coming along at great speed, and it passed the Rovers with a loud roar, and a scattering of dust and small stones in all directions.  \"Great Scott!\" gasped Sam, after he had recovered from his amazement. \"Did you ever see such an auto-truck as that, and running at such speed?\"  \"Certainly some truck,\" was Tom's comment. \"That must have weighed four or five tons. I wonder if it came over the Paxton River bridge?\"  \"If it did, it must have given the bridge an awful shaking up. That bridge isn't any too strong. It shakes fearfully every time we go over it. Better run slow, Tom, when we get there.\"  \"I will.\" And then Tom put on speed once more and the automobile forged ahead as before.  A short run up-hill brought them to the point where the road ran down to the Paxton River. In the bright moonlight the boys could see the stream flowing like a sheet of silver down between the bushes and trees. A minute more, and they came in sight of the bridge.  \"Stop!\" said Sam. \"I may be mistaken, but that bridge looks shifted to me.\"  \"So it does,\" returned Tom, and brought the automobile to a standstill. Both boys leaped out and walked forward.  To inspect the bridge in the bright moonlight was easy, and in less than a minute the boys made a startling discovery, which was to the effect that the opposite end of the structure had been thrown from its supports and was in danger of falling at any instant.  \"This is mighty bad,\" was Sam's comment. \"Why, Tom, this is positively dangerous. If anybody should come along here----\"  \"Hark!\" Tom put up his hand, and both boys listened. From the top of the hill they had left but a moment before, came the sounds of an approaching automobile. An instant later the rays of the headlights shot into view, almost blinding them.  \"We must stop them!\" came from both boys simultaneously. But scarcely had the words left their lips, when they saw that such a course might be impossible. The strange automobile was coming down the hill at a furious rate. Now, as the driver saw the Rovers' machine, he sounded his horn shrilly.  \"He'll have a smash-up as sure as fate!\" yelled Sam, and put up his hand in warning. Tom did likewise, and also yelled at the top of his lungs.  But it was too late. The occupant of the strange automobile--for the machine carried but a single person--tried to come to a stop. The brakes groaned and squeaked, and the car swept slightly to one side, thus avoiding the Rovers' machine. Then, with power thrown off and the hand-brake set, it rolled out on the bridge. There was a snap, followed by a tremendous crash, and the next instant machine and driver disappeared with a splash into the swiftly-flowing river.     CHAPTER II  TO THE RESCUE   The accident at the bridge had occurred so suddenly that, for the instant, neither Rover boy knew what to do. They saw that the farther end of the bridge had given way completely. Just where the end rested in the water they beheld several small objects floating about, one of them evidently a cap, and another a small wooden box. But the automobile with its driver was nowhere to be seen.  \"My gracious! That fellow will surely be drowned!\" gasped Sam, on recovering from the shock. \"Tom, do you see him anywhere?\"  \"No, I don't.\" Tom took a few steps forward and gazed down into the swiftly-flowing stream. \"Perhaps he is pinned under the auto, Sam!\"  \"Wait, I'll get the searchlight,\" cried the younger Rover, and ran back to their automobile. The boys made a point of carrying an electric pocket searchlight to be used in case they had to make repairs in the dark. Securing this, and turning on the light, Sam ran forward to the river bank, with Tom beside him.  To those who have read the previous volumes in this \"Rover Boys Series\" the lads just mentioned will need no special introduction. For the benefit of others, however, let me state that the Rover boys were three in number; Dick being the oldest, fun-loving Tom coming next, and sturdy Sam being the youngest. When at home, which was only for a short time each year, the boys lived with their father, Anderson Rover, and their Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha on a farm called Valley Brook, in New York State.  While their father was in Africa, the boys had been sent to Putnam Hall Military Academy, as related in the first volume of this series, entitled \"The Rover Boys at School.\" There they had made quite a few friends, and, also, some enemies.*  *For particulars regarding how Putnam Hall Military Academy was organized, and what fine times the cadets there enjoyed even before the Rovers appeared on the scene, read \"The Putnam Hall Series,\" six volumes, starting with \"The Putnam Hall Cadets.\"--Publishers  The first term at school was followed by an exciting trip on the ocean, and then another trip into the jungles of Africa, where the boys went looking for their parent. Then came a journey to the West, and some grand times on the Great Lakes and in the Mountains. After that, the Rover boys came back to the Hall to go into camp with their fellow-cadets. Then they took a long journey over land and sea, being cast away on a lonely island in the Pacific.  On returning home, the boys had imagined they were to settle down to a quiet life, but such was not to be. On a houseboat the lads, with some friends, sailed down the Ohio and the Mississippi rivers, and then found themselves on the Plains, where they solved the mystery of Red Rock ranch. Then they set sail on Southern Waters, and in the Gulf of Mexico discovered a deserted yacht.  \"Now for a good rest,\" Sam had said, and the three lads had returned to the home farm, where, quite unexpectedly, more adventures befell them. Then they returned to Putnam Hall; and all graduated with considerable honor.  It had been decided by Mr. Rover that the boys should next go to college, and he selected an institution of learning located in the Middle West, not far from the town of Ashton. Brill College was a fine place, and the Rovers knew they would like it as soon as they saw it. With them went their old-time school chum, Songbird Powell, already mentioned. At the same time, William Philander Tubbs came to the college from Putnam Hall. He was a dudish fellow, who thought far more of dress than of gaining an education, and he was often made the butt of some practical joke.  It did not take the Rover boys long to make a number of friends at Brill. These included Stanley Browne, a tall, gentlemanly youth; Bob Grimes, who was greatly interested in baseball and other sports; Max Spangler, a German-American youth, who was everybody's friend; and Will Jackson, always called \"Spud\" because of his unusual fondness for potatoes. Spud was a great story-teller, and some of his yarns were marvelous in the extreme.  During their first term at Putnam Hall, the Rover boys had become well acquainted with Dora Stanhope, who lived near the"]]]
