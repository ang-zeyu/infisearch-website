We raised almost everything we ate and he brought plenty of clothing with him when he came.  The entire family didn't require much money, and we had plenty of other things in life.  Grandpa was agreeable and compatible.  He was never grouchy.  He had a room and a bed of his own in our home and he soon became just one of the family and was accepted by all of us.  Then one morning Grandpa didn't come to breakfast.  A knock on his door brought no answer.  Had he slipped out and gone for a walk?  No one had noticed him out anywhere.  This was unusual for Grandpa.  He was usually there on time for meals so the rest of us wouldn't have to wait for him.  In our home no one ever started helping his plate at meal time until all were seated and the blessing was asked.  Papa knocked on Grandpa's door again, then he called to him, but there was still no answer.  As Mama and Papa opened the door to his room, there he was, still in bed, still asleep--but he was not breathing.  It seemed that Grandpa just went to sleep and didn't wake up.  Papa went to Hamlin that morning in a wagon and brought back a casket.  The women dressed Grandpa in his best suit.  Some men went to the graveyard and dug a grave.  Others went to tell the preacher, and found him plowing in his field.  He stopped plowing and went home to clean up and eat dinner.  Grandpa was placed in his casket and loaded into a wagon.  Then about three o'clock we drove him to the Neinda graveyard where the preacher and other friends were gathered.  And there, that afternoon, we laid him away in his final resting place.  It's amazing sometimes, how a very little thing can stick in the memory of a little boy, and that's the way it was this time, just a simple little statement made by an older brother one morning--a couple of mornings after we had buried Grandpa.  Four of us boys slept in the west room of our home, the room usually referred to as \"the boys room.\"  We boys were getting out of bed and getting dressed when Frank said, \"Well, Grandpa's in heaven by now.\" That was all he said.  That was enough.  After that, an air of reverence filled the room.  And as we finished dressing, we left the room one by one, in complete silence.  Frank had no way of knowing how much I honored and respected him for that little statement and the thought that went with it.  I was too young and timid to know how to tell him.  That's about all of my childhood memories concerning the Gaddies. In later years I had a desire to learn more about my mother's people.  But as I began digging into census records, I soon found that Grandma Gaddie had a first cousin by the name of Jesse James- -yes, that's right--\"The\" Jesse James.  So my desire suddenly changed to fear and I gave up digging into records.     CHAPTER 2  EARLY CHILDHOOD AT THE FLINT FARM  The first farm we owned, the one where I was born, is still spoken of as the Flint place, because we sold it to a family named Flint.  So at times I may refer back to it as the Flint place.  Since I was only five when we moved away from the Flint place, I remember only a few things which took place while we lived there.  I remember we had old hens that laid eggs for us to go gather up and take to the house in a bucket.  Sometimes the bucket would get so heavy I couldn't carry it.  And sometimes we had to get eggs out from under old setting hens that wouldn't get off their nests.  They would peck me to keep me away.  I was too little to get those eggs.  Mama or some of the bigger kids would have to get them.  But if the old setting hen was off the nest, I knew which eggs to get and which ones to leave in the nest.  The ones she was setting on to hatch out little chickens were marked all over with a lead pencil.  The ones that didn't have marks on them were fresh eggs that had been laid that day.  Some city folks are confused at times about some of the words we farmers use.  For instance, take the words sitting and setting. The truth is, if an old hen is on an egg that she has just laid, and if she is planning to go away in a minute or two, she is just sitting on the egg.  But if she is on the egg or eggs with the intention of hatching out little chickens, then she is not sitting, she is setting.  Even some people who are supposed to be smart don't know farm words.  In college English, the teacher had us making sentences using certain double words like, \"_Look up_ a word in the dictionary.\"  And \"_Hand over_ your gun.\"  I made a sentence like, \"The cow wouldn't _give down_ her milk.\"  The teacher gave me a zero on the sentence.  And when I asked her why, she said, \"A cow can not _hold up_ her milk nor _give down_ her milk.\"  I told her, \"Lady, you may know your English, but you sure don't know milk cows.\"  Now back to the Flint farm.  I was so little that, when I would throw out corn and maize seed to feed the chickens, I couldn't throw it far enough away from me.  Some of it would fall at my feet.  So the big chickens would crowd around my feet to pick up the grains and I was afraid of so many big hens so close to me.  And I really got scared when they started pecking the feed out of my feed bucket.  Sometimes I would drop the bucket and run away.  I remember seeing Papa digging up big trees where he was going to make a field.  It wasn't far from our house.  Sometimes I would go take him a drink of water.  And sometimes Mama would send me to tell Papa dinner was ready.  While Papa was drinking his water and resting a bit, I liked to get down in the big hole he dug around the bottom of a big tree. The dirt was damp and cool in the hole.  Some of the holes were so big and deep it was hard for me to crawl back out.  Sometimes our old surley (bull) was close by and I was afraid of him, so Mama would leave me at the house to watch after Albert while she took Papa a drink.  But if the cows were way over in the other side of the pasture, I wasn't afraid to go.  I remember our garden just outside our yard.  I was big enough to pick fresh beans and peas.  The older ones in the family taught me how to break the peas off the vines without breaking the vines.  Mama could pick them so easily, with just the right twist of her hands.  But I had to hold the vine with one hand while I twisted the peas off with the other hand.  I had the smartest Mama.  She could do so many things, and she could do them so easily.  I especially remember one little incident that took place in our home when I was three.  Most of the things I remember from my early childhood have been almost forgotten and I now remember them through special effort and recall.  But this one brief moment has lived with me and was never put aside to be recalled later.  Mama was sitting in a chair in our living room.  Albert was in her lap getting his natural milk breakfast.  I was in a hurry for the baby to get through nursing so I could play with him down on the floor.  In the meantime, I was standing leaning against Mama and playing with the baby--playing with his hands and feet, rubbing and patting his \"tummy,\" and sometimes tickling him to make him laugh.  Now all this activity caused a lot of wiggling and squirming in Mama's lap.  And it also caused a lot of letting go of, and getting back to, the baby's morning meal.  This kind of playing with the baby might have aggravated some mothers and might have brought a word of scorn, or at least an expression of impatient dissatisfaction from them, but not from this mother.  She was one of a kind.  She seemed to enjoy it all.  She was my Mama.  I was standing on Mama's left.  When Albert finished and was full, Mama stood him down on the floor on her right.  And while he was standing there holding to her dress for support, before Mama put his breakfast away, back into her blouse, she looked over at me and very motherly asked, \"Now, do you want some of the baby's milk?\"  I didn't say a word.  I just bashfully backed away a step or so and looked up at her and thought something like, \"That's for the baby, not for me.\"  For the first time in my life I was consciously aware of my mother's love for me, in that brief moment, because of that simple little gesture.  The poet expressed it better than I can, when he wrote, \". . .the love of a mother for her son that transcends all other affections of the soul.\"  I was deeply moved by the thought that, although she had another little one to hold closely and love and nourish, she had not pushed me aside.  Her love included me too.  As the years went by, sometimes all seemed hopeless and I would ask myself, \"What the heck?  Who cares anyway?\"  And always that little three-year-old kid would give me the answer, \"Mama does.\"  I remember the windmill by our garden and the water tank way up high on the tower.  When the wind blew and the mill was pumping water, we could open a faucet at the top of the well and get a drink of fresh cold water.  We had a tin cup hanging on a nail on the windmill tower to drink out of.  And we kept some water hanging up on our back porch in a wooden water bucket made out of cedar.  There was a dipper in the bucket that we all drank out of.  Once when Papa was building his big barn at the Flint place, before he got it finished, a strong wind hit it and leaned it way over, but it didn't blow it all the way down.  Papa took a block and tackle and got some men to help him and they pulled it back up straight.  Our house had three rooms.  One of them was a kitchen and dining room together.  There was a long porch at the front of the house and an L-shaped porch on the back.  There were flower beds and flowers in our front yard, and morning glory vines on the front yard fence and china trees in the back yard.  They made good shades to play in.  There was a hog pen on the north side of the barn, with sheds to protect the hogs from the summer heat and the winter cold.  The horse lots and cow lots were on the south side of the barn, with sheds to shelter the stock.  Feed troughs were under the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5420"],["title","Rab and His Friends (#1)"],["body","ready, from out the darkness; the strap across his mouth tense as a bow-string; his whole frame stiff with indignation and surprise; his roar asking us all around, \"Did you ever see the like of this?\" He looked a statue of anger and astonishment done in Aberdeen granite.  We soon had a crowd: the Chicken held on. \"A knife!\" cried Bob; and a cobbler gave him his knife: you know the kind of knife, worn away obliquely to a point, and always keen. I put its edge to the tense leather; it ran before it; and then!--one sudden jerk of that enormous head, a sort of dirty mist about his mouth, no noise,--and the bright and fierce little fellow is dropped, limp and dead. A solemn pause; this was more than any of us had bargained for. I turned the little fellow over, and saw he was quite dead; the mastiff had taken him by the small of the back like a rat, and broken it.  He looked down at his victim appeased, ashamed, and amazed, snuffed him all over, stared at him, and, taking a sudden thought, turned round and trotted off. Bob took the dead dog up, and said, \"John, we'll bury him after tea.\" \"Yes,\" said I, and was off after the mastiff. He made up the Cowgate at a rapid swing; he had forgotten some engagement. He turned up the Candlemaker Row, and stopped at the Harrow Inn.  There was a carrier's cart ready to start, and a keen, thin, impatient, black-a-vised little man, his hand at his gray horse's head, looking about angrily for something. \"Rab, ye thief!\" said he, aiming a kick at my great friend, who drew cringing up, and, avoiding the heavy shoe with more agility than dignity, and watching his master's eye, slunk dismayed under the cart, his ears down, and as much as he had of tail down too.  What a man this must be,--thought I,--to whom my tremendous hero turns tail! The carrier saw the muzzle hanging, cut and useless, from his neck, and I eagerly told him the story, which Bob and I always thought, and still think, Homer, or King David, or Sir Walter, alone were worthy to rehearse. The severe little man was mitigated, and condescended to say, \"Rab, ma man, puir Rabbie!\"--whereupon the stump of a tail rose up, the ears were cocked, the eyes filled, and were comforted; the two friends were reconciled. \"Hupp!\" and a stroke of the whip were given to Jess; and off went the three.  Bob and I buried the Game Chicken that night (we had not much of a tea) in the back-green of his house, in Melville Street, No. 17, with considerable gravity and silence; and being at the time in the Iliad, and, like all boys, Trojans, we called him Hector, of course.     Six years have passed,--a long time for a boy and a dog: Bob Ainslie is off to the wars; I am a medical student, and clerk at Minto House Hospital. Rab I saw almost every week, on the Wednesday; and we had much pleasant intimacy. I found the way to his heart by frequent scratching of his huge head, and an occasional bone. When I did not notice him he would plant himself straight before me, and stand wagging that bud of a tail, and looking up, with his head a little to the one side. His master I occasionally saw; he used to call me \"Maister John,\" but was laconic as any Spartan.  One fine October afternoon, I was leaving the hospital, when I saw the large gate open, and in walked Rab, with that great and easy saunter of his. He looked as if taking general possession of the place; like the Duke of Wellington entering a subdued city, satiated with victory and peace. After him came Jess, now white from age, with her cart, and in it a woman carefully wrapped up,--the carrier leading the horse anxiously, and looking back. When he saw me, James (for his name was James Noble) made a curt and grotesque \"boo,\" and said, \"Maister John, this is the mistress; she's got a trouble in her breest,--some kind o' an income, we're thinkin'.\"  By this time I saw the woman's face; she was sitting on a sack filled with straw, her husband's plaid round her, and his big-coat, with its large white metal buttons, over her feet.  I never saw a more unforgettable face,--pale, serious, LONELY, [Footnote: It is not easy giving this look by one word: it was expressive of her being so much of her life alone.] delicate, sweet, without being at all what we call fine. She looked sixty, and had on a mutch, white as snow, with its black ribbon; her silvery, smooth hair setting off her dark-gray eyes,--eyes such as one sees only twice or thrice in a lifetime, full of suffering, full also of the overcoming of it; her eyebrows [Footnote:                       \"Black brows, they say,       Become some women best; so that there be not       Too much hair there, BUT IN A SEMICIRCLE       OR A HALF-MOON MADE WITH A PEN.\"--A WINTER'S TALE.]  black and delicate, and her mouth firm, patient, and contented, which few mouths ever are.  As I have said, I never saw a more beautiful countenance, or one more subdued to settled quiet. \"Ailie,\" said James, \"this is Maister John, the young doctor; Rab's freend, ye ken. We often speak aboot you, doctor.\" She smiled, and made a movement, but said nothing, and prepared to come down, putting her plaid aside and rising. Had Solomon, in all his glory, been handing down the Queen of Sheba at his palace gate, he could not have done it more daintily, more tenderly, more like a gentleman, than did James the Howgate carrier, when he lifted down Ailie his wife. The contrast of his small, swarthy, weather-beaten, keen, worldly face to hers--pale, subdued, and beautiful--was something wonderful. Rab looked on concerned and puzzled, but ready for anything that might turn up,--were it to strangle the nurse, the porter, or even me. Ailie and he seemed great friends.  \"As I was sayin', she's got a kind o' trouble in her breest, doctor: wull ye tak' a look at it?\" We walked into the consulting-room, all four, Rab grim and comic, willing to be happy and confidential if cause could be shown, willing also to be the reverse on the same terms. Ailie sat down, undid her open gown and her lawn handkerchief round her neck, and, without a word, showed me her right breast. I looked at and examined it carefully,--she and James watching me, and Rab eying all three. What could I say? There it was, that had once been so soft, so shapely, so white, so gracious and bountiful, so \"full of all blessed conditions,\"--hard as a stone, a centre of horrid pain, making that pale face, with its gray, lucid, reasonable eyes, and its sweet resolved mouth, express the full measure of suffering overcome. Why was that gentle, modest, sweet woman, clean and lovable, condemned by God to bear such a burden?  I got her away to bed. \"May Rab and me bide?\" said James. \"YOU may; and Rab, if he will behave himself.\" \"I'se warrant he's do that, doctor;\" and in slunk the faithful beast. I wish you could have seen him. There are no such dogs now. He belonged to a lost tribe. As I have said, he was brindled, and gray like Rubislaw granite; his hair short, hard, and close, like a lion's; his body thick-set, like a little bull,--a sort of compressed Hercules of a dog. He must have been ninety pounds' weight, at the least; he had a large blunt head; his muzzle black as night, his mouth blacker than any night, a tooth or two--being all he had--gleaming out of his jaws of darkness. His head was scarred with the records of old wounds, a sort of series of fields of battle all over it; one eye out, one ear cropped as close as was Archbishop Leighton's father's; the remaining eye had the power of two; and above it, and in constant communication with it, was a tattered rag of an ear, which was forever unfurling itself, like an old flag; and then that bud of a tail, about one inch long, if it could in any sense be said to be long, being as broad as long,--the mobility, the instantaneousness of that bud were very funny and surprising, and its expressive twinklings and winkings, the intercommunications between the eye, the ear, and it, were of the oddest and swiftest.  Rab had the dignity and simplicity of great size; and, having fought his way all along the road to absolute supremacy, he was as mighty in his own line as Julius Caesar or the Duke of Wellington, and had the gravity [Footnote: A Highland game-keeper, when asked why a certain terrier, of singular pluck, was so much more solemn than the other dogs, said, \"Oh, sir, life's full o' sairiousness to him: he just never can get eneuch o' fechtin'.\"] of all great fighters.  You must have often observed the likeness of certain men to certain animals, and of certain dogs to men. Now, I never looked at Rab without thinking of the great Baptist preacher, Andrew Fuller. [Footnote: Fuller was in early life, when a farmer lad at Soham, famous as a boxer; not quarrelsome, but not without \"the stern delight\" a man of strength and courage feels in their exercise. Dr. Charles Stewart, of Dunearn, whose rare gifts and graces as a physician, a divine, a scholar, and a gentleman live only in the memory of those few who knew and survive him, liked to tell how Mr. Fuller used to say that when he was in the pulpit, and saw a buirdly man come along the passage, he would instinctively draw himself up, measure his imaginary antagonist, and forecast how he would deal with him, his hands meanwhile condensing into fists and tending to \"square.\" He must have been a hard hitter if he boxed as he preached,--what \"The Fancy\" would call an \"ugly customer.\"] The same large, heavy, menacing, combative, sombre, honest countenance, the same deep inevitable eye, the same look,--as of thunder asleep, but ready,--neither a dog nor a man to be trifled with.  Next day, my master, the surgeon, examined Ailie. There was no doubt it must kill her, and soon. It could be removed; it might never return; it would give her speedy relief: she should have it done. She courtesied, looked at James, and said, \"When?\" \"To-morrow,\" said the kind surgeon,--a man of few words. She and James and Rab and I retired. I noticed that he and she spoke"]]]
