Arranging these things so that we can maintain the Norm is often a delicate and arduous task. There are restrictions, and there are many variables involved, the most sensitive of which are the feelings of the people involved.\"  \"Your job must call for the ultimate in diplomacy,\" said Mrs. Harrison.  To his host's wife, Scholar Ross nodded. \"Yet,\" he said as an afterthought, \"of even greater value is a high regard for the perfect truth. This includes the self-discipline of admitting it when one has been wrong, and being able to state precisely how, where, why, and, most important, to what degree.\"  \"I don't understand,\" said his hostess.  \"Mrs. Harrison, let's consider Bertram.\"  She cast a glance at her son. In an earlier age, he would have been called \"indolent.\" During dinner, Bertram had employed the correct fork, plied his knife properly, conversed with his partners on both sides--yet she knew something was wrong.  \"Bertram,\" she said, \"haven't you been forgetting your pills?\"  \"Sorry, Mother,\" replied the young man tonelessly.  Bertram arose and left, and Scholar Ross said, \"This is what I mean, Mrs. Harrison. Genetics is not a precise science; it is statistical. We can consider highly favorable the mating of two well-balanced people, and we can predict that this union will produce well-balanced children. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee the desired results. Hence we have anomalies such as Bertram, whose problem is simply a lack of drive. Now this is no fault of yours, Mrs. Harrison, nor of yours, Mr. Harrison. It may be the fault of Genetics, but if it is our 'fault,' then the fault lies in the lack of total knowledge; but not in the misuse, or lack of use, of what knowledge we do already have.\"  \"I see what you mean, Scholar Ross.\"  \"You'll also see the opposite when the Hanfords arrive. Here we have parents as stable as you two. You'll pardon me if I say that if all four of your characteristic cards were dropped at once and I had been expected to render a considered opinion as to their most favorable mating combination, I could render no preference, so equal are you. However, your union has produced Bertram. Conversely, their mating has produced a girl who is wild, headstrong, willful.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Bertram returned, seated himself quietly, and when Scholar Ross stopped talking, Bertram said apologetically, \"I took a double dose, Mother.\"  \"Is that all right?\" she asked Scholar Ross.  \"Probably won't do any harm,\" he said.  Mr. Harrison cleared his throat. \"I'm not sure that I approve of Bertram marrying a headstrong girl, Scholar Ross.\"  Mrs. Harrison said, \"William, you know it's best.\"  \"For Bertram?\"  \"Now here,\" said Scholar Ross, \"we must cease considering the welfare of the individual alone and start thinking of him as a part of an integrated society. No man is an island, Mr. Harrison. In a less advanced culture, Bertram would have been permitted to meet contemporary personalities. Perhaps might have met someone who--as he does--lacks drive and initiative, and the result would have been a family of dull children. Had he been unlucky enough to marry a woman with drive and ambition, their children might have been normal, but the entire home life would have been an emotional battlefield. And that--\"  \"Isn't that what you're about to achieve?\" asked Mr. Harrison.  \"Not at all. We shall achieve the normal, happy children who will undoubtedly grow into fine, stable adults. To gain this end, of course, their home life must be happy and tranquil. We'll prescribe for them--allowing for the emotional change that results from marriage and--\"  The doorbell interrupted the scholar's explanation. \"Allow me,\" he said, rising and heading for the apartment door. The Harrisons followed him at a slight distance. It was the Hanfords.  There was the full round robin of introductions and small talk: \"You had no trouble?\" \"No, the intercity beacon was running clear--\" \"Lovely apartment, Mrs. Harrison.\" \"Mrs. Hanford, here in Philadelphia we feel that we're almost in the suburbs.\" \"Got a treat for you, Hanford--been saving a bottle of natural bourbon!\" \"That'll be a treat, all right!\" \"This is a real event. Scholar Ross.\" \"You know, Mrs. Hanford, the vidphone hardly does you justice!\" \"Why, thank you!\"  \"Miss Hanford, may I present Bertram Harrison?\" \"How do you do?\" \"I do as I please. What's your excuse?\" \"Huh?\" \"_Now, Gloria!_\" \"Bertram, show Gloria the flower room. Go on, now!\"  Scholar Ross watched the young couple walk through a French door to an outside terrace. He turned to Harrison and said, \"Everything set?\"  Harrison nodded. \"Had a little trouble with the Music people till I used your priority. They said they'd have Program R-147 piped into the flower room. Frankly, I think R-215 is better.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Scholar Ross laughed gently. \"Probably happy association.\"  \"Wife and I still have it piped in for our anniversary,\" Mr. Harrison admitted.  \"Good for you! But R-215 is for normal, happily well-balanced young people who'd probably fall in love without it. R-147 is sure-fire for emotional opposites.\"  \"Well, we finally got the program piped in, so what do we do now?\"  Scholar Ross smiled quietly. \"We wait. We get acquainted, because there is a very high probability that you two families will be united through the marriage of your children. Then I shall enter a new file in the Genetics Bureau of the Department of Domestic Tranquility. We shall watch through the years as your grandchildren grow, and make periodic checks, and thereby advance mankind's knowledge of genetics.\"  \"Doesn't this sort of master-minding ever give you a God complex?\" asked Mr. Hanford.  \"Not at all. Were I God, I'm sure I could arrange things a lot better.\"  \"In what way?\"  \"By Man's own laws, we are prevented from doing active genetic research on the human race. We apply what happens to mice and fruit flies to the human family tree. We've known for centuries how to breed blue-eyed or brown-eyed people, or, if we wanted, we could make the race predominantly fat or thin, tall or short. However, our main aim is not the ultimate purity of any physical characteristic. Our goal is to produce a stable, happy people by eliminating the lethargic personality below and the excitable types above.\"  The scholar thought for a moment, and then, remembering Bertram's error in forgetting to take his go-pills, said, \"But we are blocked by law. I can prescribe medication and therapy, but I have no power to force the patient to take the treatment. This is a most difficult problem, believe me.\"  \"In what way?\" asked Mrs. Harrison with some interest.  \"The lethargic types are very apt to forget, or to dismiss the medication or the therapy as too much trouble. The overactive type is more likely to be water skiing on Lake Superior than sitting and listening to the tranquilizing strains of prescribed music, and the medication dumped down the drain instead of taken.\"  \"You do have your problems, don't you?\" said Mrs. Hanford sympathetically.  \"Ah, yes. But our greatest problem is the overactive young female. Young males can be siphoned off in one way or another--work to be done that, unfortunately, females, can't also do.\" Scholar Ross smiled at Mr. and Mrs. Harrison. \"So we actually are grateful for the lethargic types. They provide us with a fine sobering influence upon the--\"  The scholar was interrupted by a wordless cry from beyond the French windows.         *       *       *       *       *  The Harrisons, the Hanfords, and Scholar Ross leaped to their feet and started for the terrace. They did not get all the way to the French doors, for Gloria Hanford came stamping in. Her eyes were bright, and she was dusting one palm with the other.  \"What--?\"  Gloria snapped, \"Someone been feeding that oaf red meat?\"  \"But what _happened_?\" asked Mr. Harrison.  \"Oh, I could stand the big dummy acting as if he'd never been alone with a girl before in all his life. But to _ask_ me for a kiss!\"  \"Is that what caused the eruption?\" said Scholar Ross.  \"When he _asked_ me for a kiss, I told him that I was saving my kisses for a _man_!\"  \"And then?\"  \"Then he decided that I meant a man big enough to wrestle.\" Gloria laughed and then looked thoughtful.  \"What's so funny--and not so funny now?\"  \"I just realized that _I like men_!\"  \"But Bertram?\"  \"Darned if it isn't the first time I've ever resented being pawed,\" said Gloria in a matter-of-fact tone, as if it were her hair-do rather than her virtue that was the subject of discussion. \"So I grabbed a hand, hung the arm over my shoulder with the inside upward, and hip-tossed the big oaf over the railing into that silly little fish pond.\"  \"Gloria!\" exploded her mother.  \"Poor Bertram!\" exclaimed his mother.  Scholar Ross sighed. \"These things often go awry at first. Bertram shouldn't have taken a double dose of his medication. And I'd guess that Gloria hasn't been meticulous about hers, either. Now--\"  He was interrupted by the arrival of Bertram Harrison, who looked as if he'd just waded home across a mud flat at low tide. He stepped toward Gloria purposefully; the girl crouched in a judo position and said, \"Want some more? Come and get it!\"  \"Now wait a moment,\" said Scholar Ross. \"Gloria, where did you ever learn such brutal, belligerent tactics?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gloria faced him, but kept one eye on Bertram. \"Out of a book--where else in this calm old world?\"  The scholar said, \"You see, Miss Hanford, the results of your outrageous behavior? You've committed an act of physical violence. You've--\"  The girl gave one sharp bark of laughter. \"Who started it with whose caveman technique?\"  \"I think,\" said Scholar Ross to the four parents, \"that this meeting should be resumed at a later date. Bertram must _not_ overdose himself in a misguided effort to make up for omitted medication.

The tiny immortals knew nothing of the capture of Santa Claus until some time after he had disappeared.  But finally they missed his cheery voice, and as their master always sang or whistled on his journeys, the silence warned them that something was wrong.  Little Wisk stuck out his head from underneath the seat and found Santa Claus gone and no one to direct the flight of the reindeer.  \"Whoa!\" he called out, and the deer obediently slackened speed and came to a halt.  Peter and Nuter and Kilter all jumped upon the seat and looked back over the track made by the sleigh.  But Santa Claus had been left miles and miles behind.  \"What shall we do?\" asked Wisk anxiously, all the mirth and mischief banished from his wee face by this great calamity.  \"We must go back at once and find our master,\" said Nuter the Ryl, who thought and spoke with much deliberation.  \"No, no!\" exclaimed Peter the Knook, who, cross and crabbed though he was, might always be depended upon in an emergency.  \"If we delay, or go back, there will not be time to get the toys to the children before morning; and that would grieve Santa Claus more than anything else.\"  \"It is certain that some wicked creatures have captured him,\" added Kilter thoughtfully, \"and their object must be to make the children unhappy.  So our first duty is to get the toys distributed as carefully as if Santa Claus were himself present.  Afterward we can search for our master and easily secure his freedom.\"  This seemed such good and sensible advice that the others at once resolved to adopt it.  So Peter the Knook called to the reindeer, and the faithful animals again sprang forward and dashed over hill and valley, through forest and plain, until they came to the houses wherein children lay sleeping and dreaming of the pretty gifts they would find on Christmas morning.  The little immortals had set themselves a difficult task; for although they had assisted Santa Claus on many of his journeys, their master had always directed and guided them and told them exactly what he wished them to do.  But now they had to distribute the toys according to their own judgment, and they did not understand children as well as did old Santa.  So it is no wonder they made some laughable errors.  Mamie Brown, who wanted a doll, got a drum instead; and a drum is of no use to a girl who loves dolls.  And Charlie Smith, who delights to romp and play out of doors, and who wanted some new rubber boots to keep his feet dry, received a sewing box filled with colored worsteds and threads and needles, which made him so provoked that he thoughtlessly called our dear Santa Claus a fraud.  Had there been many such mistakes the Daemons would have accomplished their evil purpose and made the children unhappy.  But the little friends of the absent Santa Claus labored faithfully and intelligently to carry out their master's ideas, and they made fewer errors than might be expected under such unusual circumstances.  And, although they worked as swiftly as possible, day had begun to break before the toys and other presents were all distributed; so for the first time in many years the reindeer trotted into the Laughing Valley, on their return, in broad daylight, with the brilliant sun peeping over the edge of the forest to prove they were far behind their accustomed hours.  Having put the deer in the stable, the little folk began to wonder how they might rescue their master; and they realized they must discover, first of all, what had happened to him and where he was.  So Wisk the Fairy transported himself to the bower of the Fairy Queen, which was located deep in the heart of the Forest of Burzee; and once there, it did not take him long to find out all about the naughty Daemons and how they had kidnapped the good Santa Claus to prevent his making children happy.  The Fairy Queen also promised her assistance, and then, fortified by this powerful support, Wisk flew back to where Nuter and Peter and Kilter awaited him, and the four counseled together and laid plans to rescue their master from his enemies.  It is possible that Santa Claus was not as merry as usual during the night that succeeded his capture.  For although he had faith in the judgment of his little friends he could not avoid a certain amount of worry, and an anxious look would creep at times into his kind old eyes as he thought of the disappointment that might await his dear little children.  And the Daemons, who guarded him by turns, one after another, did not neglect to taunt him with contemptuous words in his helpless condition.  When Christmas Day dawned the Daemon of Malice was guarding the prisoner, and his tongue was sharper than that of any of the others.  \"The children are waking up, Santa!\" he cried.  \"They are waking up to find their stockings empty!  Ho, ho!  How they will quarrel, and wail, and stamp their feet in anger!  Our caves will be full today, old Santa!  Our caves are sure to be full!\"  But to this, as to other like taunts, Santa Claus answered nothing. He was much grieved by his capture, it is true; but his courage did not forsake him.  And, finding that the prisoner would not reply to his jeers, the Daemon of Malice presently went away, and sent the Daemon of Repentance to take his place.  This last personage was not so disagreeable as the others.  He had gentle and refined features, and his voice was soft and pleasant in tone.  \"My brother Daemons do not trust me overmuch,\" said he, as he entered the cavern; \"but it is morning, now, and the mischief is done.  You cannot visit the children again for another year.\"  \"That is true,\" answered Santa Claus, almost cheerfully; \"Christmas Eve is past, and for the first time in centuries I have not visited my children.\"  \"The little ones will be greatly disappointed,\" murmured the Daemon of Repentance, almost regretfully; \"but that cannot be helped now.  Their grief is likely to make the children selfish and envious and hateful, and if they come to the Caves of the Daemons today I shall get a chance to lead some of them to my Cave of Repentance.\"  \"Do you never repent, yourself?\" asked Santa Claus, curiously.  \"Oh, yes, indeed,\" answered the Daemon.  \"I am even now repenting that I assisted in your capture.  Of course it is too late to remedy the evil that has been done; but repentance, you know, can come only after an evil thought or deed, for in the beginning there is nothing to repent of.\"  \"So I understand,\" said Santa Claus.  \"Those who avoid evil need never visit your cave.\"  \"As a rule, that is true,\" replied the Daemon; \"yet you, who have done no evil, are about to visit my cave at once; for to prove that I sincerely regret my share in your capture I am going to permit you to escape.\"  This speech greatly surprised the prisoner, until he reflected that it was just what might be expected of the Daemon of Repentance.  The fellow at once busied himself untying the knots that bound Santa Claus and unlocking the chains that fastened him to the wall.  Then he led the way through a long tunnel until they both emerged in the Cave of Repentance.  \"I hope you will forgive me,\" said the Daemon pleadingly.  \"I am not really a bad person, you know; and I believe I accomplish a great deal of good in the world.\"  With this he opened a back door that let in a flood of sunshine, and Santa Claus sniffed the fresh air gratefully.  \"I bear no malice,\" said he to the Daemon, in a gentle voice; \"and I am sure the world would be a dreary place without you.  So, good morning, and a Merry Christmas to you!\"  With these words he stepped out to greet the bright morning, and a moment later he was trudging along, whistling softly to himself, on his way to his home in the Laughing Valley.  Marching over the snow toward the mountain was a vast army, made up of the most curious creatures imaginable.  There were numberless knooks from the forest, as rough and crooked in appearance as the gnarled branches of the trees they ministered to.  And there were dainty ryls from the fields, each one bearing the emblem of the flower or plant it guarded.  Behind these were many ranks of pixies, gnomes and nymphs, and in the rear a thousand beautiful fairies floated along in gorgeous array.  This wonderful army was led by Wisk, Peter, Nuter, and Kilter, who had assembled it to rescue Santa Claus from captivity and to punish the Daemons who had dared to take him away from his beloved children.  And, although they looked so bright and peaceful, the little immortals were armed with powers that would be very terrible to those who had incurred their anger.  Woe to the Daemons of the Caves if this mighty army of vengeance ever met them!  But lo! coming to meet his loyal friends appeared the imposing form of Santa Claus, his white beard floating in the breeze and his bright eyes sparkling with pleasure at this proof of the love and veneration he had inspired in the hearts of the most powerful creatures in existence.  And while they clustered around him and danced with glee at his safe return, he gave them earnest thanks for their support.  But Wisk, and Nuter, and Peter, and Kilter, he embraced affectionately.  \"It is useless to pursue the Daemons,\" said Santa Claus to the army. \"They have their place in the world, and can never be destroyed.  But that is a great pity, nevertheless,\" he continued musingly.  So the fairies, and knooks, and pixies, and ryls all escorted the good man to his castle, and there left him to talk over the events of the night with his little assistants.  Wisk had already rendered himself invisible and flown through the big world to see how the children were getting along on this bright Christmas morning; and by the time he returned, Peter had finished telling Santa Claus of how they had distributed the toys.  \"We really did very well,\" cried the fairy, in a pleased voice; \"for I found little unhappiness among "]]]
