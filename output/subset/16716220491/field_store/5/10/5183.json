Just how many girls _are_ there in this raiding party?\"  His first Invader--and he had dropped his weapon!  Scrabbling fearfully in the dust for his hammer, Roddie paused suddenly. This girl--whatever _that_ was--seemed to think him one of her own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn delay to advantage. Maybe he could learn something of value before he killed her. That would make the soldiers accept him!  He stalled, seeking a gambit. \"How would _I_ know how many girls there are?\"  Half expecting a blow, he got instead an apology. \"I'm sorry,\" the girl said. \"I should have known. Never even heard your name before, either. Roddie.... Whose boat did you come in, Roddie?\"  Boat? What was a boat? \"How would I know?\" he repeated, voice tight with fear of discovery.  If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisper was friendly enough. \"Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then. They shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too. Tough, wasn't it, getting separated in the fog and tide like that? If only we didn't have to use boats.... But, say, how are we going to get away from here?\"  \"I wouldn't know,\" Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, and rising. \"How did you get in?\"  \"Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in the dust and they led me here. Where were you?\"  \"Scouting around,\" Roddie said vaguely. \"How did you know I was a man when I came back?\"  \"Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well these androids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!\"  Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could find him whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps the manhole would help him now to redeem himself....         *       *       *       *       *  \"I'd like to get a look at you,\" he said.  The girl laughed self-consciously. \"It's getting gray out. You'll see me soon enough.\"  But she'd see _him_, Roddie realized. He had to talk fast.  \"What'll we do when it's light?\" he asked.  \"Well, I guess the boats have gone,\" Ida said. \"You could swim the Gate, I guess--you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll think it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it over from the other side. I expect to try the Golden Gate Bridge!\"  Now he was getting somewhere! The bridge was ruined, impassable. Even her own people had crossed the Strait by other means. But if there _were_ a way over the bridge....  \"It's broken,\" he said. \"How in the world can we cross it?\"  \"Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I--I don't want to be alone, Roddie. Will you go with me? Now?\"  Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed her--_if_ nothing happened when she saw him.  Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand.  A giggle broke the pause. \"It's nice of you to wait and let me go first up the ladder,\" the girl said. \"But where the heck is the rusty old thing?\"  \"I'll go first,\" said Roddie. He might need the advantage. \"The ladder's right behind me.\"  He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from street level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously fingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn.  She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her shapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet that were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number.  Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that would make things easy when the time came.  He looked into her face. It smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, with a full mouth and bright dark eyes that hid under long lashes when he looked too long.  Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a rush of fear, but she gave his hand a squeeze before twisting loose, and burst into sudden laughter.  \"Diapers!\" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. \"My big, strong, blond and blue-eyed hero goes into battle wearing diapers, and carrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most unforgettable character I have ever known!\"  He'd passed inspection, then--so far. He expelled his withheld breath, and said, \"I think you'll find me a little odd, in some ways.\"  \"Oh, not at all,\" Ida replied quickly. \"Different, yes, but I wouldn't say odd.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When they started down the street, she was nervous despite Roddie's assertion that he knew where the soldiers were posted. He wondered if she felt some of the doubt he'd tried to conceal, shared his visions of what the soldiers might do if they found him brazenly strolling with an Invader. They might not believe he was only questioning a prisoner.  Every day, his friends were becoming more unpredictable.  For that very reason, because he didn't know what precautions would do any good, he took a chance and walked openly to the bridge by the most direct route. In time this apparent assurance stilled Ida's fears, and she began to talk.  Many of the things she said were beyond his experience and meaningless to him, but he did note with interest how effective the soldiers had been.  \"It's awful,\" Ida said. \"So few young men are left, so many casualties....  \"But why do you--we--keep up the fight?\" Roddie asked. \"I mean, the soldiers will never leave the city; their purpose is to guard it and they _can't_ leave, so they won't attack. Let them alone, and there'll be plenty of young men.\"  \"Well!\" said Ida, sharply. \"You need indoctrination! Didn't they ever tell you that the city is our home, even if the stupid androids do keep us out? Don't you know how dependent we are on these raids for all our tools and things?\"  She sounded suspicious. Roddie shot her a furtive, startled glance. But she wasn't standing off to fight him. On the contrary, she was too close for both comfort and combat. She bumped him hip and shoulder every few steps, and if he edged away, she followed.  He went on with his questioning. \"Why are _you_ here? I mean, sure, the others are after tools and things, but what's _your_ purpose?\"  Ida shrugged. \"I'll admit no girl has ever done it before,\" she said, \"but I thought I could help with the wounded. That's why I have no weapon.\"  She hesitated, glanced covertly up at him, and went on with a rush of words. \"It's the lack of men, I guess. All the girls are kind of bored and hopeless, so I got this bright idea and stowed away on one of the boats when it was dark and the fog had settled down. Do you think I was being silly?\"  \"No, but you do seem a little purposeless.\"  In silence they trudged through a vast area of charred wood and concrete foundations on the northern end of the city. Thick fog over the water hid Alcatraz, but in-shore visibility was better, and they could see the beginning of the bridge approach.  A stone rattled nearby. There was a clink of metal. Ida gasped, and clung to Roddie's arm.  \"Behind me!\" he whispered urgently. \"Get behind me and hold on!\"  He felt Ida's arms encircling his waist, her chin digging into his back below the left shoulder. Facing them, a hundred feet away, stood a soldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile.  \"It's all right,\" Roddie said, his voice breaking.  There was a long, sullen, heart-stopping stare. Then the soldier turned and walked away.  Ida's grip loosened, and he could feel her sag behind him. Roddie turned and held her. With eyes closed, she pressed cold blue lips to his. He grimaced and turned away his head.  Ida's response was quick. \"Forgive me,\" she breathed, and slipped from his arms, but she held herself erect. \"I was so scared. And then we've had no sleep, no food or water.\"  Roddie was familiar with these signs of weakness, proud of appearing to deny his own humiliating needs.  \"I guess you're not as strong as me,\" he said smugly. \"I'll take care of you. Of course we can't sleep now, but I'll get food and water.\"  Leaving her to follow, he turned left to the ruins of a supermarket he had previously visited, demonstrating his superior strength by setting a pace Ida couldn't match. By the time she caught up with him, he had grubbed out a few cans of the special size that Molly always chose. Picking two that were neither dented, swollen, nor rusted, he smashed an end of each with his hammer, and gave Ida her choice of strained spinach or squash.  \"Baby food!\" she muttered. \"Maybe it's just what we need, but to eat baby food with a man wearing a diaper.... Tell me, Roddie, how did you happen to know where to find it?\"  \"Well, this is the northern end of the city,\" he answered, shrugging. \"I've been here before.\"  \"Why did the soldier let us go?\"  \"This watch,\" he said, touching the radium dial. \"It's a talisman.\"  But Ida's eyes had widened, and the color was gone from her face. She was silent, too, except when asking him to fill his fast-emptied can with rain-water. She didn't finish her own portion, but lay back in the rubble with feet higher than her head, obviously trying to renew her strength.  And when they resumed their walk, her sullen, fear-clouded face showed plainly that he'd given himself away.  But to kill her now, before learning how she planned to cross the supposedly impassable bridge, seemed as purposeless and impulsive as Ida herself. Roddie didn't think, in any case, that her death would satisfy the soldiers. With new and useful information to offer, he might join them as an equal at last. But if his dalliance with this enemy seemed pointless, not even Molly's knitting needles could protect him.  He was sure the soldiers must be tracking the mysterious emanations of his watch dial, and had trouble to keep from glancing over his shoulder at every step. But arrival at the bridge approach ended the need"]]]
