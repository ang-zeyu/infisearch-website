We, who ask only for work--\"  \"We have received kindness, too. Don't let's doubt God's goodness on the eve of Christmas--the day when He gave His only Son for us all, my Suze! . . . 'Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.' Well, there's _no_ evil in this day--or to-morrow. There sha'n't be. Let's trust; let's not stop hoping, for not to hope is death. You go to the children, dearest, now, and I'll slip around the back way with this tree, so they sha'n't see it till it's lighted and decorated to-night---\"  \"Lighted and decorated!\" Suze echoed, with a laugh that came trembling out of tears.  \"Yes,\" insisted Paul, \"trust me. Your husband isn't an artist for nothing! Come along. No more time for repining if the tree's to be ready before the children's bedtime. I tell you, it will be a great work!\"  \"You're the most wonderful man in the world!\" breathed Suze senior. \"And we _adore you_--our soldier who fights for us always. Oh, but listen! There's Paulette calling me. I told the two I'd be back before they finished their Christmas present for father. Guess what it is--but no, it wouldn't be fair to the poor little things. They're coming to look for me. If you go by the mimosa path you can get away before they see you.\"  Without a word, the man picked up the miniature pine-tree and, shouldering it, limped off almost at a run. At the same instant the woman went down on her knees and began once more to drape the gray bagging over the flower-bed, as if nothing had happened to interrupt her task.  \"Here I am, by the palm-grove. Come and help me cover the flowers!\" she cried, almost cheerily, in answer to a child shouting \"Maman! Maman!\"  At the silver sound of the little voice, the kitten in Angel Odel's lap stiffened itself for a spring. Mechanically her hands tightened on the ball of fluff, but it wriggled free, and, with a jump, landed clear of the palm, on the grass beyond. Small as it was, the little animal left the fronds rustling in its wake, and the woman on her knees, looking up with a start, caught a glimpse of something gray under the tree. Two pinafored children, emerging from a side-path, caught the same glimpse, and as the younger snatched up the kitten the elder took a step forward and parted the long green plumes of the agitated palm.  \"Why, mother!\" she exclaimed in French, \"there's a strange child under our tree, sitting on _our_ seat! Oh, but a beautiful child in splendid clothes. Can she be real, or--oh, mother! Is she the Christmas fairy father says God sends to bless those who love one another?\"  Without answering, the woman got up from her knees. Flushed with embarrassment, she peeped over her daughter's golden head. The younger girl peeped, also, hanging shyly to her mother's dress. It was a horrid moment for Angel Odell.  The children were smaller than she--not more than six and four years old at most--and they were, Angel saw at a glance, pretty as life-size dolls, with their yellow curls, rose-red cheeks, and pink pinafores. Their great blue eyes stared at her, not with anger, but bewildered admiration. Even their mother did not look as if she meant to scold or sweep the intruder angrily out of her hiding-place. But, child as she was, Angel realized that she had been doing a forbidden thing, a shameful thing. She had been eavesdropping. She had seen the woman crying; she had heard her talking over family secrets with her husband; she had come to know what she had no right to know, and what those two had meant for each other's hearts alone. Ever since she was old enough to learn anything, she had been taught that \"eavesdropping\" was one of those disgusting sins no honorable girl or boy could possibly commit. Her father himself had said those very words; unforgettable words, because father was Angel's hero. What would he think if he could see her now? Somehow, she _must_ atone!  \"I--I didn't _mean_ to hide,\" she stammered. \"I looked in--the gate was open. I thought--maybe it was a fairy garden--\"  \"Oh, mother, you see she _is_ a fairy,\" gasped Suze junior, the elder of the children.  \"Perhaps,\" agreed Suze senior, doubtfully. And her eyes challenged the stranger. \"Who are you, really? Where do you come from?\"  \"I--I _often_ play I'm a fairy.\" The culprit seized the straw held out to her. \"I--expect I _am_ one. I know the _me_ in the looking-glass is, and sometimes I can't tell which is which Mademoiselle plays _she_ can't, either. She says when I come in, 'Which is this, today, the angel or the fairy?' My name's Angela.\"  \"Oh mother!\" breathed both children together, their eyes round with awe. \"An angel and a fairy.\"  \"And I'm lost,\" the wonderful visitor hurried on, heading off an answer from mother. \"I don't know where I live.\"  \"She doesn't know where she lives,\" murmured Suze and Paulette, in chorus. \"Then she can stay always and live with us, can't she?\"  \"Perhaps she wouldn't want to do that,\" said Suze senior. \"Perhaps _she_ has a mother waiting for her somewhere.\"  \"But do fairies have mothers?\" Paulette wanted to know.  \"Or angels?\" added Suze. \"I always thought they hadn't.\"  \"_I_ have,\" the visitor announced, hastily. \"Some kinds of angels do--the kind like me. My name's Angel Odell.\"  \"Well, I _never_ supposed angels had last names,\" Paulette reflected, aloud. \"I thought they were just called Gabriel or something like that, and that they were generally boys.\"  \"Oh _no!_\" Angel Odell announced, with decision. \"Boys are _never_ angels, anyhow, not in America where I live when I'm home.\"  \"She lives in America,\" the two children repeated to their mother. \"That's not fairyland or heaven, is it?\"  \"Fairyland can be anywhere, your father says,\" Suze senior answered. \"But see, it's going to be twilight soon! I think we must try to find out where Angel Odell lives, and take her home. She says she's lost--so her mother will be anxious.\"  \"She thinks I'm with my governess,\" said Angel.  \"Oh, fairy angels have _governesses_,\" the elder sister mourned, another illusion gone. \"That's as bad as being a real child and going to school.\" The two spoke English or French indiscriminately, seeming hardly to know which language they used, but luckily Angel understood French very well, thanks to Paris and Mademoiselle Rose.  \"I like my governess,\" she explained. \"She's very pretty and she's engaged to a soldier. That's why I'm lost. Because she met him by the sea, instead of his being dead as she thought, so she forgot to watch me. I was going home alone when I saw your garden gate open, and it looked just like fairyland. If you please, I wish you would find where I live. It's a--hotel, and it has a garden, too, but not like this.\"  Suze senior set her wits to work. She knew that, in those days of war, not many hotels were open in Mentone. She questioned Angel, and, learning that the hotel garden was high above the sea, with glass screens to keep off the wind and a view where you saw the town all piled together on the side of a hill with dark, tall trees on top, she guessed the Bellevue.  \"We'll all three put on our hats and cloaks, and take you back to your mother,\" she said, with the thought in her mind, perhaps, that Paul would be glad of the children's absence while he did his part of the tree-dressing. \"Suze and Paulette will leave you the kitten to play with, and you won't mind being alone here again for a few minutes, while we get ready?\"  Even if Angel had minded, now that a blue veil of twilight was dropping over the garden, she would have said \"No,\" bravely, to wipe off ever so little, if she could, of the stain of eavesdropping. But suddenly, when the children's mother asked that question, and she realized that she would have the place to herself, the most wonderful idea came into her head, straight and direct as a bee flies into an open flower. She happened at the moment to be putting on her mittens preparatory to a start, when a glint of her mother's diamond flashed up from her plump little thumb to her eyes. The flash was an inspiration. When the children and their mother were out of the way she would pull off her hair-ribbon and tie the ring to the kitten's neck. Then, when they had taken her home and come back, Suze and Paulette would find the ring and think it the magic gift of a fairy, because (they would say to each other) no ordinary little girl could have a gorgeous diamond like that to give away.  Oh, it was a splendid idea! Angel was sure her mother would approve when she had thoroughly explained, for mother was rich. Angel had often heard servants at home and in hotels, away over across the sea in America, telling one another that Mrs. Odell's father was Cyrus P. Holroyd, one of the big millionaires. Mother herself had heaps and heaps of money, too much to please father; and grandpa-- that very Cyrus P. Holroyd--was always sending presents of jewelry and things. He sent beautiful presents to Angel, as well. Probably she would find some from him when she went home, for when you visited at grandpa's house in New York, it was the rule to begin Christmas on Christmas Eve, and have still _more_ things on Christmas morning, too, when you thought you had got all there were.  No sooner had Suze senior and her two children turned their backs than Angel proceeded hurriedly to carry out her idea. The kitten, unused to being personally decorated at Christmas or any other time, resisted the ribbon with some determination. But Angel was even more determined, and, as in war, size counted. Before the trio returned, ready for their walk, the bow had been tied and the victim had dashed angrily away. This vanishing act suited Angel precisely, for the bright blue of the ribbon was conspicuous on the white fur, even in twilight, and to have the fairy's legacy discovered in the fairy's presence would have been premature. In fact, it would have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42923"],["title","The Doctor's Christmas Eve (#1)"],["body","was new--except in this country. She appeared to have gathered newness during her short life, to be newer than the day she was born. The air was full of frost spangles that zigzagged about her as she danced along; they rather seemed like particles of salt especially provided to escort her character. If it had been granted Lot's wife with tears of repentance to dissolve away the crystals of her curiosity and resume the duties of motherhood,--though possibly permeated by a mild saline solution as a warning,--that salt-cured matron might admirably have adapted herself to the decrees of Providence by producing Elsie.  The boy as she administered her caution stopped; and shutting his own red mouth, which was like hers though more generous, he drew a long breath through his nostrils; then, throwing back his head, he blew this out with an open-mouthed puff, and a column of white steam shot up into the blue ether and was whirled away by the wind. He stood studying it awhile as it disappeared, for he was a close observer always--a perpetual watcher of the thing that is--sometimes an observer fearful to confront. Then he sprang forward to catch up with his sharp-tongued monitress, who had hurried on. As he came alongside, he turned his face toward her and made his reply, which was certainly deliberate enough in arriving:--  \"We have to be _taught_ the best way to breathe, Elsie; as anything else!\"  The defence only brought on a fresh attack:--  \"I wonder who teaches the young of other animals how to breathe! I should like to know who teaches kittens and puppies and calves and lambs how to breathe! How _do_ they ever manage to get along without country doctors among them! Imagine a middle-aged sheep--old Dr. Buck--assembling a flock of lambs and trying to show them how to breathe!\" Judging from Elsie's expression, the lambs in the case could not have thought very highly of this queer and genial Dr. Buck.  \"But _they_ are all four-legged creatures, Elsie; and _they_ breathe backward and forward; if you are a two-legged animal and stand up straight, you breathe up and down: it's quite different! It's easier!\"  \"Then I suppose the fewer legs a thing has, the harder it is to get its breath. And I suppose if we ventured to stand on _one_ leg, we'd all soon suffocate! Dear me! why _don't_ all one-legged people die at once!\"  The lad looked over the field of war on which it would seem that he was being mowed down by small-gun fire before he could get his father's heavy artillery into action. He decided to terminate the wordy engagement, a prudential manoeuvre of the wiser head but slower tongue.  \"Father is right,\" he declared. His manner of speaking was sturdy and decisive: it was meant to remind her first that he had enough gallantry as a male to permit her to crowd him out of the path; but that the moment a struggle for mental footing arose between them, he reserved the whole road: the female could take to the weeds! He notified her also that he stood with his father not only in this puzzling question of legs and parlous types of respiration, but that the men in the family were regularly combined against the women--like good organized against evil!  But now something further had transpired. Had there been present on the winter fields that morning an ear trained to separate our complex human tones into simple ones--to disengage one from another the different fibres of meaning which always make up even the slenderest tendril of sound (as there is a cluster of grapes to a solitary stem), it might, as it noted one thing, have discovered another. While the boy asserted his father to be right in the matter they were debating, there escaped from him an accent of admission that his father was wrong--wrong in some far graver affair which was his discovery and his present trouble.  Therefore his voice, which should have been buoyant, for the instant was depressed; and his face, which should have been a healthy boy's happy face, was overcast as by a foreign interference. You might have likened it to a small luminary upon the shining disk of which a larger body, traversing its darkened orbit, has just begun to project a wavering shadow. And thus some patient astronomer of our inter-orbited lives, sweeping the spiritual heavens for signs of its pendent mysteries, here might have arrested his telescope to watch the portent of a celestial event: was there to take place the eclipse of a son by a father?  Certainly at least this weight of responsibility on the voice must have caused it to strike only the more winningly upon any hearer. It was such a devoted, loyal voice when he thus spoke of his father, with a curious quavering huskiness of its own, as though the bass note of his distant manhood were already beginning to clamor to be heard.  The voice of the little girl contrariwise was a shrill treble. Had you first become aware of it at your back, you must instantly have wheeled to investigate the small creature it came from, as a wild animal quickly turns to face any sound that startles its instincts. Voltaire might have had such a voice if he had been a little girl. Yet to look at her, you would never have imagined that anything but the honey of speech could have dripped from so perfect a little rose. (Many surprises await mankind behind round amiable female faces: shrews are not _all_ thin.)  Instead of being silenced by her brother's ultimatum, she did not deign to notice it, but continued to direct her voluble satire at her father--quite with the air of saying that a girl who can satirize a parent is not to be silenced by a son.  \"... forever telling us that American children must have the newest and best way of doing everything.... My, my, my! The working of our jaws! And the drinking and the breathing; and the stretching and the bending: developing everything we have--and everything we haven't! I am even trying now to find an original American way to go to sleep at night and to wake up in the morning! Dear me, but old people can be silly without knowing it!\" She laughed with much self-approval.  For Elsie had already entered into one of mankind's most dependable recreations--the joy of listening to our own words: into that economic arrangement of nature whereby whatsoever a human being might lose through the vocal cords is returned to the owner along the auditory nerve! So that a woman can eat her colloquial cake times over: and each time, having devoured it, can return it to the storeroom and have it brought out as whole and fresh as ever--sometimes actually increased in size. And a man can send his vocal Niagara through his whirlpool rapids and catch it again above the falls! The more gold the delver unearths, the more he can empty back into the thinking mine. One can sit in his own cranial theatre and produce his own play: he can be stage and orchestra, audience and critic; and he can see that the claque does not get drowsy and slack: it never does--in _this_ case!  The child now threw back her round winter-rose of a face and started along the path with a fresh outburst of speed and pride. Access of impertinence seemed to have released in her access of vitality. Perhaps it had. Perhaps it always does. Perhaps life itself at the full is sheer audacity.  The lad scrambled roughly along, and merely repeated the words that sufficed for him:--  \"Father knows.\"  Suddenly he gave a laughing outcry, and stood still.  \"Look!\" he called out, with amusement at his plight.  He had run into some burdock, and the nettles had stuck to his yarn stockings like stinging bees--a cluster of them about his knees and calves. He drew off his gloves, showing the strong, overgrown hands of boyhood: they, like his voice, seemed impatiently reaching out for maturity.  When he overtook his companion, who had not stopped, he had transferred a few of the burrs to his skull cap. He had done this with crude artistry--from some faint surviving impulse of primitive man to decorate his body with things around him in nature: especially his head (possibly he foresaw that his head would be most struck at). The lad was pleased with his caper; and, smiling, thrust his head across her path, expecting her to take sympathetic notice. He had reason to expect this, because on dull rainy days at home he often amused her with the things he did and the things he made: for he was a natural carpenter and toy-maker. But now she took only the contemptuous notice of disapproval. This morning her mind was intent on playthings of positive value: she was a little travelling ten-toed pagoda of holiday greed. Every Christmas she prepared for its celebration with a balancing eye to what it would cost her and what it would bring in: she always calculated to receive more than she gave: for Elsie, the Nativity must be made _to pay_!  He resented her refusal to approve his playfulness by so much as a smile, and he came back at her by doing worse:--  \"Why didn't I think to bring all the burrs along and make a Christmas basket for Elizabeth? Now what will I give her?\"  This drew out a caustic comment quickly enough:--  \"Poor Elizabeth!\"  A child resents injustice with a blow or rage or tears: the old have learned to endure without a sign--waiting for God's day of judgment (or their first good opportunity!).  He was furious at the way she said \"Poor Elizabeth\"--as though Elizabeth's hands would be empty of gifts from him.  \"You _know_ I have _bought_ my presents for Elizabeth, Elsie!\" he exclaimed. \"But Elizabeth thinks more of what I _make_ than of what I _buy_,\" he continued hotly. \"And the less it is worth, the more she values it. But you can't understand _that_, Elsie! And you needn't try!\"  The little minx laughed with triumph that she had incensed him.  \"I don't expect to try!\" she retorted blithely. \"I don't see that I'd gain anything, if I _did_ understand. You and Elizabeth are a great deal too--\"  He interrupted overbearingly:--  \"Leave Elizabeth out! Confine your remarks"]]]
