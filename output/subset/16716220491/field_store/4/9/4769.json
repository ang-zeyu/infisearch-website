If Horta had tried to apply pressure, he'd have turned obstinate on the instant. But there was no pressure. First the girl and now Horta tried to lure him with mystery and assurance of interest in high places.  \"And _La Rubia's_ involved in the secret?\" demanded Terry.  \"Innocently,\" said Horta promptly. \"As you are.\"  \"Thank you for faith in my innocence,\" said Terry with irony. \"All right. If I'm involved, I'm involved. I'll try to devolve out of being involved by playing along.\"  He turned to the workshop space at the back of the store. He found boxes to pack his working tools and the considerable stock of small parts needed to make such things as burglar alarms, submarine ears and the assorted electronic devices modern business finds increasingly necessary. He began to pack them. Surprisingly, Horta helped. Any man of Spanish blood is apt to be sensitive about manual labor. If he has an official position his sensitiveness is apt to be extreme. But Horta not only helped pack the boxes with Terry's stock of parts; he helped carry them to his car outside. He helped to load them.  Terry turned the key in the door and handed it to him, with the nearly complete inventory of the shop's contents.  \"Jimenez having run away, I leave the shop in your hands,\" he observed.  Horta put the key and document away. He started the motor of his car and drove along the Calle Enero. He drove with surprising moderation for a police officer authorized to ignore traffic rules on occasion. Presently the dock-area of Manila was left behind, and then the rest of the commercial district, and then for a time the car tooled along wide streets past the impressive residences of the wealthy. Some of the architecture was remarkable. A little further, and the harbor--the bay--appeared again. The car entered the grounds of Manila's swankiest yacht club. The design of the clubhouse was astounding. The car stopped by the small-boat pier. There were two men waiting there. Without being given any orders, they accepted the parcels Horta handed out. Also without orders, they carried them out to the float. They loaded them into the brass-trimmed motor tender which waited there.  \"They knew we were coming,\" said Terry shortly. \"Would I have been brought anyhow?\"  \"_Pero no_,\" said Horta. \"But there are telephones. When we left the shop, one was used.\"  The men who'd carried out the parcels vanished. Terry and Horta stepped aboard. The tender cast off and headed out into the harbor. There was a Philippine gunboat and a mine-layer and an American flattop in plain view. There were tankers and tramp steamers and a vast array of smaller craft at anchor. A seemingly top-heavy steamer ploughed across oily water two miles distant. The tender headed for a trim sixty-five-foot schooner anchored a mile from shore. It grew larger and seemed more trim as the tender approached it.  The smaller boat passed under the larger one's stern, and the name _Esperance_ showed plainly. On the starboard side a boat boom projected. The tender ran deftly up and a man in a sweat shirt and duck trousers snubbed the line. He said cheerfully, \"How do you do, Mr. Holt?\" Then he nodded to Horta. \"Good to see you, Captain.\" He offered his hand as Terry straightened up on deck. \"My name's Davis. We'll have your stuff aboard right away.\"  Two young men in dungarees and with crew cuts appeared and took over the motley lot of cartons that Terry and Horta had made ready.  \"Have you everything you need?\" asked Davis anxiously. \"Would some extra stuff be useful?\"  \"I could do with a few items,\" said Terry, stiffly.  He had quickly developed an acute dislike for the patent attempt to induce him to join the _Esperance_. He had no reason for his objection, save that he had not been informed about the task he was urged to undertake.  \"Also,\" he added abruptly, \"Captain Horta didn't think to stop at my hotel so I could get my baggage.\"  \"Write a list of what you want,\" suggested Davis. \"I'm sure something can be done about your baggage. Make the list complete. If something's left over, it won't matter. There's a desk in the cabin for you to write at.\" He turned to Horta. \"Captain, what's the news about _La Rubia_?\"  \"She sailed again yesterday,\" said Horta ruefully. \"She was followed by many other boats. And now there is a moon. It rises late, but it rises. Many sailors will be watching her from mastheads. It is said that all the night glasses in Manila have been bought by fishermen....\"  His voice died away as Terry went down the companion ladder. Belowdecks was attractive. There was no ostentation, but the d馗or was obviously expensive. There were armchairs, electric lamps, a desk, and shelves filled with books--two or three on electronics and a highly controversial one on marine monsters and sea serpents. There were some on anthropology. On skin diving. On astronomy. Two thick volumes on abyssal fish. There was a shelf of fiction and other shelves of reference books for navigation, radio and Diesel maintenance and repair. There were obvious reasons for these last, but no reason that could be imagined for two books on the solar planets.  Terry sat at the desk and compiled a list of electronic parts that he was sure wouldn't be available in Manila. He was annoyed as he realized afresh the smoothness of the operation that had brought him to the _Esperance_. He found satisfaction in asking for some multi-element vacuum tubes that simply couldn't be had except on special order from the manufacturers back in the United States. But it took time to think of them.  When he went abovedecks, half an hour later, he had listed just six electronic components. The tender was gone, and Horta with it. Davis greeted Terry as cordially as before.  \"The tender's left,\" said Terry with restraint. \"Here's my list.\"  Davis did not even glance at it, but beckoned to one of the crew-cut young men who'd unloaded the tender.  \"This is Nick Alden,\" he said to Terry. \"He's one of the gang. See about this list, Nick.\"  The crew-cut young man put out his hand and Terry shook it. It seemed expected. He went forward with the list and vanished down the forecastle ladder. Davis looked at his watch.  \"Five-thirty,\" he observed. \"A drink might not be a bad thing.\"  He went below, and Terry surveyed the _Esperance_. She had the look of a pleasure craft, but was built along the lines of something more reliable. There was an unusual power winch amidships, with an extraordinarily large reel. Next to it there was a heavy spar by which to swing something outboard. There were two boats, well stowed against heavy weather, and a number of often-omitted bits of equipment, so that the schooner was not convincing as the hobby of a mere yachtsman.  Then Terry saw the brass-trimmed tender heading out from the yacht-club float again. Foam spread out from its bow. A figure in it waved. Terry recognized the girl who'd come into the shop of Jimenez y C禘. She was smiling, and as the launch came nearer it seemed to Terry that there was triumph in her smile. He bristled. Then he saw some parcels in the bow of the tender. Next to the parcels--and he unbelievingly suspected what they were--he suddenly recognized something else: his suitcases and steamer-trunk. In order to sail with the _Esperance_ he need not go ashore to get his belongings. They were brought to him. He became totally convinced that these people had assumed he'd do what they wanted him to, without consulting him. He rebelled. Immediately. Any time other people took for granted that they could make plans for him, he would become obstinate. When he was in a fix--and now he was practically stranded in Manila with a need to go elsewhere for a time and no money with which to do it--he was especially touchy. He found himself scowling and angry, and the more angry because what was required of him would have been very convenient if there'd been no attempt to inveigle him into it.  The launch came around the _Esperance's_ stern. Davis came from below with two glasses. The girl said cheerfully, \"Howdo! We've got your extra items. All of them. And your baggage.\"  Terry said curtly, \"How did my list get ashore?\"  \"Nick phoned it,\" said Davis. \"By short-wave.\"  \"And where the devil did you find the stuff I named?\"  \"That,\" said Davis, \"is part of the mystery you don't like.\"  \"Right!\" said Terry grimly. \"I don't like it. I don't think I'll play. I'll go ashore in the tender.\"  \"Hold it!\" said Davis. But he was speaking to the operator of the tender. The crew-cut Nick was in the act of handing up the first piece of baggage. Davis waved it back. \"I'm sorry,\" he said to Terry. \"We'll stay at anchor here. If you change your mind, the tender will bring you out any time.\"  Terry brought out the sheaf of bills the girl had left in the shop of the vanished Jimenez. He held them out to the girl. She put her hands behind her back and shook her head.  \"We put you to trouble,\" she said pleasantly, \"and we haven't been frank with you. That's to make up for it.\"  \"I won't accept it,\" said Terry stiffly. \"I insist.\"  \"We won't have it back,\" said Davis. \"And we insist!\"  Terry felt idiotic. There was enough of a breeze to make it impractical simply to put the batch of bank notes down. They'd blow away. The girl looked at him regretfully.  \"I'm truly sorry,\" she said. \"I planned the way we went after you. You are exactly the person we're sure to need. We decided to try to get you to join us. We couldn't explain. So we asked what you were like. And you're not the sort of person who can be hired to do what he's told and no questions asked. Captain Horta said you were a gentleman. So since we couldn't ask you to volunteer blindly--though I think you would volunteer if you knew what we're about to do--we tried to make you come for the adventure of it. It didn't work. I'm sorry.\"  Terry had the singular conviction that she told the exact truth."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42914"],["title","Gladiator (#1)"],["body","saw the fire. It sensed warmth. The feline affinity for hearths drew it. One paw scratched tentatively on the door.  \"It's cold,\" Mrs. Danner said. \"Why don't you bring it here? No, I don't want it here. Take it a cover.\"  \"It--it has a cover.\" Danner did not wish to go into that dark room.  The kitten scratched again and then it became earnest. There was a splitting, rending sound. The bottom panel of the door was torn away and it emerged nonchalantly, crossing the room and curling up by the fire.  For five minutes Mrs. Danner sat motionless. Her eyes at length moved from the kitten to her husband's quivering face and then to the broken door. On his part, he made no move. The kitten was a scant six inches from his foot. Mrs. Danner rose. She went to the door and studied the orifice, prying at it with her fingers as if to measure the kitten's strength by her own. Then she turned the key and peered into the gloom. That required either consummate nerve or great curiosity. After her inspection she sat down again.  Ten minutes passed. Danner cleared his throat. Then she spoke. \"So. You've done it?\"  \"Done what?\" he asked innocently.  \"You've made all this rubbish you've been talking about strength--happen to that kitten.\"  \"It wasn't rubbish.\"  \"Evidently.\"  At that crisis Mr. Danner's toe trembled and the kitten, believing it a new toy, curled its paws over the shoe. There was a sound of tearing leather, and the shoe came apart. Fortunately the foot inside it was not hurt severely. Danner did not dare to budge. He heard his wife's startled inhalation.  Mrs. Danner did not resume her sewing. She breathed heavily and slow fire crept into her cheeks. The enormity of the crime overcame her. And she perceived that the hateful laboratory had invaded her portion of the house. Moreover, her sturdy religion had been desecrated. Danner read her thoughts.  \"Don't be angry,\" he said. Beads of perspiration gathered on his brow.  \"Angry!\" The kitten stirred at the sound of her voice. \"Angry! And why not? Here you defied God and man--and made that creature of the devil. You've overrun my house. You're a wicked, wicked man. And as for that cat, I won't have it. I won't stand for it.\"  \"What are you going to do?\"  Her voice rose to a scream. \"Do! Do! Plenty--and right here and now.\" She ran to the kitchen and came back with a broom. She flung the front door wide. Her blazing eyes rested for a moment on the kitten. To her it had become merely an obnoxious little animal. \"Scat! You little demon!\" The broom came down on the cat's back with a jarring thud.  After that, chaos. A ball of fur lashed through the air. What-not, bird cage, bookcase, morris chair flew asunder. Then the light went out. In the darkness a comet, a hurricane, ricochetted through the room. Then there was a crash mightier than the others, followed by silence.  When Danner was able, he picked himself up and lighted the lamp. His wife lay on the floor in a dead faint. He revived her. She sat up and wept silently over the wreck of her parlour. Danner paled. A round hole--a hole that could have been made by nothing but a solid cannon shot--showed where the kitten had left the room through the wall.  Mrs. Danner's eyes were red-rimmed. Her breath came jerkily. With incredulous little gestures she picked herself up and gazed at the hole. A draught blew through it. Mr. Danner stuffed it with a rug.  \"What are we going to do?\" she said.  \"If it comes back--we'll call it Samson.\"  And--as soon as Samson felt the gnawing of appetite, he returned to his rightful premises. Mrs. Danner fed him. Her face was pale and her hands trembled. Horror and fascination fought with each other in her soul as she offered the food. Her husband was in his classroom, nervously trying to fix his wits on the subject of the day.  \"Kitty, kitty, poor little kitty,\" she said.  Samson purred and drank a quart of milk. She concealed her astonishment from herself. Mrs. Danner's universe was undergoing a transformation.  At three in the afternoon the kitten scratched away the screen door on the back porch and entered the house. Mrs. Danner fed it the supper meat.  Danner saw it when he returned. It was chasing flies in the yard. He stood in awe. The cat could spring twenty or thirty feet with ease. Then the sharp spur of dread entered him. Suppose someone saw and asked questions. He might be arrested, taken to prison. Something would happen. He tried to analyze and solve the problem. Night came. The cat was allowed to go out unmolested. In the morning the town of Indian Creek rose to find that six large dogs had been slain during the dark hours. A panther had come down from the mountains, they said. And Danner lectured with a dry tongue and errant mind.  It was Will Hoag, farmer of the fifth generation, resident of the environs of Indian Creek, church-goer, and hard-cider addict, who bent himself most mercilessly on the capture of the alleged panther. His chicken-house suffered thrice and then his sheep-fold. After four such depredations he cleaned his rifle and undertook a vigil from a spot behind the barn. An old moon rose late and illuminated his pastures with a blue glow. He drank occasionally from a jug to ward off the evil effects of the night air.  Some time after twelve his attention was distracted from the jug by stealthy sounds. He moved toward them. A hundred yards away his cows were huddled together--a heap of dun shadows. He saw a form which he mistook for a weasel creeping toward the cows. As he watched, he perceived that the small animal behaved singularly unlike a weasel. It slid across the earth on taut limbs, as if it was going to attack the cows. Will Hoag repressed a guffaw.  Then the farmer's short hair bristled. The cat sprang and landed on the neck of the nearest cow and clung there. Its paw descended. There was a horrid sound of ripping flesh, a moan, the thrashing of hoofs, a blot of dribbling blood, and the cat began to gorge on its prey.  Hoag believed that he was intoxicated, that delirium tremens had overtaken him. He stood rooted to the spot. The marauder ignored him. Slowly, unbelievingly, he raised his rifle and fired. The bullet knocked the cat from its perch. Mr. Hoag went forward and picked it up.  \"God Almighty,\" he whispered. The bullet had not penetrated the cat's skin. And, suddenly, it wriggled in his hand. He dropped it. A flash of fur in the moonlight, and he was alone with the corpse of his Holstein.  He contemplated profanity, he considered kneeling in prayer. His joints turned to water. He called faintly for his family. He fell unconscious.  When Danner heard of that exploit--it was relayed by jeering tongues who said the farmer was drunk and a panther had killed the cow--his lips set in a line of resolve. Samson was taking too great liberties. It might attack a person, in which case he, Danner, would be guilty of murder. That day he did not attend his classes. Instead, he prepared a relentless poison in his laboratory and fed it to the kitten in a brace of meaty chops. The dying agonies of Samson, aged seven weeks, were Homeric.  After that, Danner did nothing for some days. He wondered if his formulæ and processes should be given to the world. But, being primarily a man of vast imagination, he foresaw hundreds of rash experiments. Suppose, he thought, that his discovery was tried on a lion, or an elephant! Such a creature would be invincible. The tadpoles were dead. The kitten had been buried. He sighed wearily and turned his life into its usual courses.     II   Before the summer was ended, however, a new twist of his life and affairs started the mechanism of the professor's imagination again. It was announced to him when he returned from summer school on a hot afternoon. He dropped his portfolio on the parlour desk, one corner of which still showed the claw-marks of the miscreant Samson, and sat down with a comfortable sigh.  \"Abednego.\" His wife seldom addressed him by his first name.  \"Yes?\"  \"I--I--I want to tell you something.\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Haven't you noticed any difference in me lately?\"  He had never noticed a difference in his wife. When they reached old age, he would still be unable to discern it. He shook his head and looked at her with some apprehension. She was troubled. \"What's the matter?\"  \"I suppose you wouldn't--yet,\" she said. \"But--well--I'm with child.\"  The professor folded his upper lip between his thumb and forefinger. \"With child? Pregnant? You mean--\"  \"I'm going to have a baby.\"  Soon after their marriage the timid notion of parenthood had escaped them. They had, in fact, avoided its mechanics except on those rare evenings when tranquillity and the reproductive urge conspired to imbue him with courage and her with sinfulness. Nothing came of that infrequent union. They never expected anything.  And now they were faced with it. He murmured: \"A baby.\"  Faint annoyance moved her. \"Yes. That's what one has. What are we going to do?\"  \"I don't know, Matilda. But I'm glad.\"  She softened. \"So am I, Abednego.\"  Then a hissing, spattering sound issued from the kitchen. \"The beans!\" Mrs. Danner said. The second idyl of their lives was finished.  Alone in his bed, tossing on the humid muslin sheets, Danner struggled within himself. The hour that was at hand would be short. The logical step after the tadpoles and the kitten was to vaccinate the human mammal with his serum. To produce a super-child, an invulnerable man. As a scientist he was passionately intrigued by the idea. As a husband he was dubious. As a member of society he was terrified.  That his wife would submit to the plan or to the step it necessitated was beyond belief. She would never allow a sticky tube of foreign animal matter to be poured into her veins. She would not permit the will of God to be altered or her offspring to be the subject of experiment. Another man would have laughed at the notion of persuading her. Mr. Danner never laughed at matters that involved his "]]]
