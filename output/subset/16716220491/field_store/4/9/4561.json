And on the next he appeared to step and swing in one action.  There was a ringing rap, and the ball shot toward right, curving down, a vicious, headed hit.  Mallory, at first base, snatched at it and found only the air.  Babcock had only time to take a few sharp steps, and then he plunged down, blocked the hit and fought the twisting ball.  Reddie turned first base, flitted on toward second, went headlong in the dust, and shot to the base before White got the throw-in from Babcock.  Then, as White wheeled and lined the ball home to catch the scoring Clammer, Reddie Ray leaped up, got his sprinter's start and, like a rocket, was off for third.  This time he dove behind the base, sliding in a half circle, and as Hanley caught Strickland's perfect throw and whirled with the ball, Reddie's hand slid to the bag.  Reddie got to his feet amid a rather breathless silence.  Even the coachers were quiet.  There was a moment of relaxation, then Wehying received the ball from Hanley and faced the batter.  This was Dump Kane.  There was a sign of some kind, almost imperceptible, between Kane and Reddie.  As Wehying half turned in his swing to pitch, Reddie Ray bounded homeward.  It was not so much the boldness of his action as the amazing swiftness of it that held the audience spellbound.  Like a thunderbolt Reddie came down the line, almost beating Wehying's pitch to the plate.  But Kane's bat intercepted the ball, laying it down, and Reddie scored without sliding. Dorr, by sharp work, just managed to throw Kane out.  Three runs so quick it was hard to tell how they had come.  Not in the major league could there have been faster work.  And the ball had been fielded perfectly and thrown perfectly.  \"There you are,\" said Delaney, hoarsely. \"Can you beat it?  If you've been wonderin' how the cripped Stars won so many games just put what you've seen in your pipe and smoke it.  Red Gilbat gets on--Reddy Clammer gets on--and then Reddie Ray drives them home or chases them home.\"  The game went on, and though it did not exactly drag it slowed down considerably.  Morrissey and Healy were retired on infield plays.  And the sides changed.  For the Grays, O'Brien made a scratch hit, went to second on Strickland's sacrifice, stole third and scored on Mallory's infield out.  Wehying missed three strikes.  In the Stars' turn the three end players on the batting list were easily disposed of.  In the third inning the clever Blake, aided by a base on balls and a hit following, tied the score, and once more struck fire and brimstone from the impatient bleachers.  Providence was a town that had to have its team win.  \"Git at 'em, Reds!\" said Delaney gruffly.  \"Batter up!\" called Umpire Fuller, sharply.  \"Where's Red?  Where's the bug?  Where's the nut?  Delaney, did you lock the gates?  Look under the bench!\"  These and other remarks, not exactly elegant, attested to the mental processes of some of the Stars. Red Gilbat did not appear to be forthcoming.  There was an anxious delay Capt. Healy searched for the missing player. Delaney did not say any more.  Suddenly a door under the grand stand opened and Red Gilbat appeared. He hurried for his bat and then up to the plate.  And he never offered to hit one of the balls Wehying shot over.  When Fuller had called the third strike Red hurried back to the door and disappeared.  \"Somethin' doin',\" whispered Delaney.  Lord Chesterfield Clammer paraded to the batter's box and, after gradually surveying the field, as if picking out the exact place he meant to drive the ball, he stepped to the plate.  Then a roar from the bleachers surprised him.  \"Well, I'll be dog-goned!\" exclaimed Delaney. \"Red stole that sure as shootin'.\"  Red Gilbat was pushing a brand-new baby carriage toward the batter's box.  There was a tittering in the grand stand; another roar from the bleachers.  Clammer's face turned as red as his hair.  Gilbat shoved the baby carriage upon the plate, spread wide his long arms, made a short presentation speech and an elaborate bow, then backed away.  All eyes were centered on Clammer.  If he had taken it right the incident might have passed without undue hilarity.  But Clammer became absolutely wild with rage.  It was well known that he was unmarried. Equally well was it seen that Gilbat had executed one of his famous tricks. Ball players were inclined to be dignified about the presentation of gifts upon the field, and Clammer, the dude, the swell, the lady's man, the favorite of the baseball gods--in his own estimation--so far lost control of himself that he threw his bat at his retreating tormentor.  Red jumped high and the bat skipped along the ground toward the bench.  The players sidestepped and leaped and, of course, the bat cracked one of Delaney's big shins.  His eyes popped with pain, but he could not stop laughing.  One by one the players lay down and rolled over and yelled.  The superior Clammer was not overliked by his co-players.  From the grand stand floated the laughter of ladies and gentlemen.  And from the bleachers--that throne of the biting, ironic, scornful fans--pealed up a howl of delight.  It lasted for a full minute.  Then, as quiet ensued, some boy blew a blast of one of those infernal little instruments of pipe and rubber balloon, and over the field wailed out a shrill, high-keyed cry, an excellent imitation of a baby.  Whereupon the whole audience roared, and in discomfiture Reddy Clammer went in search of his bat.  To make his chagrin all the worse he ingloriously struck out.  And then he strode away under the lea of the grand-stand wall toward right field.  Reddie Ray went to bat and, with the infield playing deep and the outfield swung still farther round to the right, he bunted a little teasing ball down the third-base line.  Like a flash of light he had crossed first base before Hanley got his hands on the ball.  Then Kane hit into second base, forcing Reddie out.  Again the game assumed less spectacular and more ordinary play.  Both Scott and Wehying held the batters safely and allowed no runs.  But in the fifth inning, with the Stars at bat and two out, Red Gilbat again electrified the field.  He sprang up from somewhere and walked to the plate, his long shape enfolded in a full-length linen duster.  The color and style of this garment might not have been especially striking, but upon Red it had a weird and wonderful effect. Evidently Red intended to bat while arrayed in his long coat, for he stepped into the box and faced the pitcher.  Capt. Healy yelled for him to take the duster off.  Likewise did the Grays yell.  The bleachers shrieked their disapproval.  To say the least, Red Gilbat's crazy assurance was dampening to the ardor of the most blindly confident fans.  At length Umpire Fuller waved his hand, enjoining silence and calling time.  \"Take it off or I'll fine you.\"  From his lofty height Gilbat gazed down upon the little umpire, and it was plain what he thought.  \"What do I care for money!\" replied Red.  \"That costs you twenty-five,\" said Fuller.  \"Cigarette change!\" yelled Red.  \"Costs you fifty.\"  \"Bah!  Go to an eye doctor,\" roared Red.  \"Seventy-five,\" added Fuller, imperturbably.  \"Make it a hundred!\"  \"It's two hundred.\"  \"ROB-B-BER!\" bawled Red.  Fuller showed willingness to overlook Red's back talk as well as costume, and he called, \"Play!\"  There was a mounting sensation of prophetic certainty.  Old fox Wehying appeared nervous. He wasted two balls on Red; then he put one over the plate, and then he wasted another.  Three balls and one strike!  That was a bad place for a pitcher, and with Red Gilbat up it was worse. Wehying swung longer and harder to get all his left behind the throw and let drive.  Red lunged and cracked the ball.  It went up and up and kept going up and farther out, and as the murmuring audience was slowly transfixed into late realization the ball soared to its height and dropped beyond the left-field fence.  A home run!  Red Gilbat gathered up the tails of his duster, after the manner of a neat woman crossing a muddy street, and ambled down to first base and on to second, making prodigious jumps upon the bags, and round third, to come down the home-stretch wagging his red head.  Then he stood on the plate, and, as if to exact revenge from the audience for the fun they made of him, he threw back his shoulders and bellowed:  \"HAW! HAW! HAW!\"  Not a handclap greeted him, but some mindless, exceedingly adventurous fan yelled:  \"Redhead! Redhead!  Redhead!\"  That was the one thing calculated to rouse Red Gilbat.  He seemed to flare, to bristle, and he paced for the bleachers.  Delaney looked as if he might have a stroke. \"Grab him!  Soak him with a bat!  Somebody grab him!\"  But none of the Stars was risking so much, and Gilbat, to the howling derision of the gleeful fans, reached the bleachers.  He stretched his long arms up to the fence and prepared to vault over. \"Where's the guy who called me redhead?\" he yelled.  That was heaping fuel on the fire.  From all over the bleachers, from everywhere, came the obnoxious word.  Red heaved himself over the fence and piled into the fans.  Then followed the roar of many voices, the tramping of many feet, the pressing forward of line after line of shirt-sleeved men and boys.  That bleacher stand suddenly assumed the maelstrom appearance of a surging mob round an agitated center.  In a moment all the players rushed down the field, and confusion reigned.  \"Oh!  Oh!  Oh!\" moaned Delaney.  However, the game had to go on.  Delaney, no doubt, felt all was over. Nevertheless there were games occasionally that seemed an unending series of unprecedented events.  This one had begun admirably to break a record.  And the Providence fans, like all other fans, had cultivated an appetite as the game proceeded.  They were wild to put the other redheads out of the field or at least out for the inning, wild to tie the score, wild to win and wilder than "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/385"],["title","The Redheaded Outfield, and Other Baseball Stories (#2)"],["body","for more excitement. Clammer hit safely.  But when Reddie Ray lined to the second baseman, Clammer, having taken a lead, was doubled up in the play.  Of course, the sixth inning opened with the Stars playing only eight men.  There was another delay.  Probably everybody except Delaney and perhaps Healy had forgotten the Stars were short a man.  Fuller called time.  The impatient bleachers barked for action.  Capt. White came over to Delaney and courteously offered to lend a player for the remaining innings.  Then a pompous individual came out of the door leading from the press boxes--he was a director Delaney disliked.  \"Guess you'd better let Fuller call the game,\" he said brusquely.  \"If you want to--as the score stands now in our favor,\" replied Delaney.  \"Not on your life!  It'll be ours or else we'll play it out and beat you to death.\"  He departed in high dudgeon.  \"Tell Reddie to swing over a little toward left,\" was Delaney's order to Healy.  Fire gleamed in the manager's eye.  Fuller called play then, with Reddy Clammer and Reddie Ray composing the Star outfield.  And the Grays evidently prepared to do great execution through the wide lanes thus opened up.  At that stage it would not have been like matured ball players to try to crop hits down into the infield.  White sent a long fly back of Clammer.  Reddy had no time to loaf on this hit.  It was all he could do to reach it and he made a splendid catch, for which the crowd roundly applauded him.  That applause was wine to Reddy Clammer.  He began to prance on his toes and sing out to Scott:  \"Make 'em hit to me, old man!  Make 'em hit to me!\" Whether Scott desired that or not was scarcely possible to say; at any rate, Hanley pounded a hit through the infield.  And Clammer, prancing high in the air like a check-reined horse, ran to intercept the ball.  He could have received it in his hands, but that would never have served Reddy Clammer.  He timed the hit to a nicety, went down with his old grand-stand play and blocked the ball with his anatomy.  Delaney swore. And the bleachers, now warm toward the gallant outfielder, lustily cheered him.  Babcock hit down the right-field foul line, giving Clammer a long run.  Hanley was scoring and Babcock was sprinting for third base when Reddy got the ball. He had a fine arm and he made a hard and accurate throw, catching his man in a close play.  Perhaps even Delaney could not have found any fault with that play. But the aftermath spoiled the thing.  Clammer now rode the air; he soared; he was in the clouds; it was his inning and he had utterly forgotten his team mates, except inasmuch as they were performing mere little automatic movements to direct the great machinery in his direction for his sole achievement and glory.  There is fate in baseball as well as in other walks of life.  O'Brien was a strapping fellow and he lifted another ball into Clammer's wide territory.  The hit was of the high and far-away variety.  Clammer started to run with it, not like a grim outfielder, but like one thinking of himself, his style, his opportunity, his inevitable success.  Certain it was that in thinking of himself the outfielder forgot his surroundings.  He ran across the foul line, head up, hair flying, unheeding the warning cry from Healy.  And, reaching up to make his crowning circus play, he smashed face forward into the bleachers fence.  Then, limp as a rag, he dropped.  The audience sent forth a long groan of sympathy.  \"That wasn't one of his stage falls,\" said Delaney.  \"I'll bet he's dead....  Poor Reddy! And I want him to bust his face!\"  Clammer was carried off the field into the dressing room and a physician was summoned out of the audience.  \"Cap., what'd it--do to him?\" asked Delaney.  \"Aw, spoiled his pretty mug, that's all,\" replied Healy, scornfully. \"Mebee he'll listen to me now.\"  Delaney's change was characteristic of the man. \"Well, if it didn't kill him I'm blamed glad he got it....  Cap, we can trim 'em yet. Reddie Ray'll play the whole outfield.  Give Reddie a chance to run! Tell the boy to cut loose.  And all of you git in the game.  Win or lose, I won't forget it.  I've a hunch.  Once in a while I can tell what's comin' off.  Some queer game this!  And we're goin' to win. Gilbat lost the game; Clammer throwed it away again, and now Reddie Ray's due to win it....  I'm all in, but I wouldn't miss the finish to save my life.\"  Delaney's deep presaging sense of baseball events was never put to a greater test.  And the seven Stars, with the score tied, exhibited the temper and timber of a championship team in the last ditch.  It was so splendid that almost instantly it caught the antagonistic bleachers.  Wherever the tired Scott found renewed strength and speed was a mystery.  But he struck out the hard-hitting Providence catcher and that made the third out.  The Stars could not score in their half of the inning.  Likewise the seventh inning passed without a run for either side; only the infield work of the Stars was something superb. When the eighth inning ended, without a tally for either team, the excitement grew tense. There was Reddy Ray playing outfield alone, and the Grays with all their desperate endeavors had not lifted the ball out of the infield.  But in the ninth, Blake, the first man up, lined low toward right center.  The hit was safe and looked good for three bases.  No one looking, however, had calculated on Reddie's Ray's fleetness. He covered ground and dove for the bounding ball and knocked it down. Blake did not get beyond first base.  The crowd cheered the play equally with the prospect of a run.  Dorr bunted and beat the throw. White hit one of the high fast balls Scott was serving and sent it close to the left-field foul line.  The running Reddie Ray made on that play held White at second base.  But two runs had scored with no one out.  Hanley, the fourth left-handed hitter, came up and Scott pitched to him as he had to the others--high fast balls over the inside corner of the plate.  Reddy Ray's position was some fifty yards behind deep short, and a little toward center field. He stood sideways, facing two-thirds of that vacant outfield.  In spite of Scott's skill, Hanley swung the ball far round into right field, but he hit it high, and almost before he actually hit it the great sprinter was speeding across the green.  The suspense grew almost unbearable as the ball soared in its parabolic flight and the red-haired runner streaked dark across the green. The ball seemed never to be coming down.  And when it began to descend and reached a point perhaps fifty feet above the ground there appeared more distance between where it would alight and where Reddie was than anything human could cover.  It dropped and dropped, and then dropped into Reddie Ray's outstretched hands.  He had made the catch look easy. But the fact that White scored from second base on the play showed what the catch really was.  There was no movement or restlessness of the audience such as usually indicated the beginning of the exodus.  Scott struck Babcock out.  The game still had fire.  The Grays never let up a moment on their coaching.  And the hoarse voices of the Stars were grimmer than ever. Reddie Ray was the only one of the seven who kept silent. And he crouched like a tiger.  The teams changed sides with the Grays three runs in the lead. Morrissey, for the Stars, opened with a clean drive to right.  Then Healy slashed a ground ball to Hanley and nearly knocked him down. When old Burns, by a hard rap to short, advanced the runners a base and made a desperate, though unsuccessful, effort to reach first the Providence crowd awoke to a strange and inspiring appreciation.  They began that most rare feature in baseball audiences--a strong and trenchant call for the visiting team to win.  The play had gone fast and furious.  Wehying, sweaty and disheveled, worked violently.  All the Grays were on uneasy tiptoes.  And the Stars were seven Indians on the warpath.  Halloran fouled down the right-field line; then he fouled over the left-field fence.  Wehying tried to make him too anxious, but it was in vain.  Halloran was implacable.  With two strikes and three balls he hit straight down to white, and was out.  The ball had been so sharp that neither runner on base had a chance to advance.  Two men out, two on base, Stars wanting three runs to tie, Scott, a weak batter, at the plate! The situation was disheartening.  Yet there sat Delaney, shot through and through with some vital compelling force. He saw only victory.  And when the very first ball pitched to Scott hit him on the leg, giving him his base, Delaney got to his feet, unsteady and hoarse.  Bases full, Reddie Ray up, three runs to tie!  Delaney looked at Reddie.  And Reddie looked at Delaney.  The manager's face was pale, intent, with a little smile.  The player had eyes of fire, a lean, bulging jaw and the hands he reached for his bat clutched like talons.  \"Reddie, I knew it was waitin' for you,\" said Delaney, his voice ringing.  \"Break up the game!\"  After all this was only a baseball game, and perhaps from the fans' viewpoint a poor game at that.  But the moment when that lithe, redhaired athlete toed the plate was a beautiful one.  The long crash from the bleachers, the steady cheer from the grand stand, proved that it was not so much the game that mattered.  Wehying had shot his bolt; he was tired.  Yet he made ready for a final effort.  It seemed that passing Reddie Ray on balls would have been a wise play at that juncture.  But no pitcher, probably, would have done it with the bases crowded and chances, of course, against the batter.  Clean and swift, Reddie leaped at the first pitched ball.  Ping!  For a second no one saw the hit.  Then it gleamed, a terrific drive, low along the ground, like a bounding bullet, straight at Babcock in right field.  It struck his hands and glanced viciously away to roll toward the fence.  Thunder broke loose"]]]
