The lowermost layer reaches a height of about 10 meters; in many places in the forest this layer is absent. Common trees in the lower stratum include _Crysophila argentea_, _Cymbopetalum penduliflorum_, _Casearia_ sp., and _Hasseltia dioica_.  The ground cover is sparce; apparently only a few small herbs and ferns live on the heavily shaded forest floor. Important herpetological habitats include the leaf litter, rotting stumps, and rotting tree trunks on the forest floor and the buttresses of many of the gigantic trees, especially _Ceiba pentandra_ (Pl. 2). Epiphytes, especially various kinds of bromeliads, are common. Most frequently these are in the trees in the upper and middle strata.  At Toocog there is sharp break between savanna and forest (Pl. 7, fig. 2). The forest is noticeably drier and more open than at Chinajá (Pl. 9). The crowns of the trees are lower, and there is no nearly continuous canopy between 40 and 50 meters above the ground. Although _Swietenia macrophylla_ and other large trees occur, they are less common than at Chinajá. Especially common at Toocog are _Achras zapote_, _Brosimum alicastrum_, and various species of _Ficus_.     GAZETTEER   The localities from which specimens were obtained are cited below and shown on the accompanying map (Fig. 1).  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Map of El Petén, Guatemala, showing localities mentioned in text.]        Chinajá.--Lat. 16° 02´, long. 90° 13´, elev. 140 m. Camp of       the Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala and formerly a small       settlement. On some maps Chinajá is located just to the north       of the Alta Verapaz--El Petén boundary; recent surveys place       the location just to the south of the imaginary line through       the rainforest. Field work was conducted in the immediate       vicinity of the camp, on the lower slopes of the Serrania de       Chinajá, and at several sites to the northwest and       north-northwest of Chinajá, where the forest was being       cleared. The entire area supports rainforest.        La Libertad.--Lat. 16° 47´, long. 90° 07´, elev., 170 m. A       town on the savannas in central El Petén; although we       collected there in the rainy season, the specimens obtained on       the savannas are not included in this report.        Paso Subín.--Lat. 16° 38´, long. 90° 12´, elev. 90 m. A small       settlement on the Río Subín, a tributary of the Río de la       Pasión.

Río de la Pasión.--A large river flowing northward through       southern El Petén and thence westward into the Río Usumacinta.       Specimens were obtained along the river between the Río Subín       and Sayaxché.        Río San Román.--A river flowing northward in south-central El       Petén to the Río Salinas (Usumacinta). We collected along the       river at a place about 16 kilometers north-northwest of       Chinajá, approximately at Lat. 16° 10´, long. 90° 17´, elev.       110 m. In the dry season the river was clear; it is surrounded       by rainforest.        Sayaxché.--Lat. 16° 31´, long. 90° 09´, elev. 80 m. A town on       the southern bank of the Río de la Pasión.

A camp of the Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala located at       the rainforest-savanna edge, 15 kilometers southeast of La       Libertad. Although we collected on the savannas as well as in       the forest, especially to the east of the camp, only species       obtained in the forest are considered in this report.     THE HERPETOFAUNA OF THE RAINFOREST   In presenting an account of the herpetofauna of southern El Petén three items need to be considered: (1) The composition of the fauna; (2) the ecology of the fauna; (3) the relationships of the fauna. Each of these topics is discussed briefly below. Logically a discussion of the origin of the fauna should follow, but this is being withheld for inclusion in a report on the herpetofauna of the entire El Petén by L. C. Stuart and the author; at that time the above topics will be expanded to cover the herpetofauna of the whole region.

Another 13 species probably occur in southern El Petén (see Hypothetical List of Species). The fauna primarily is composed of typical humid lowland forest inhabitants, such as:    _Hyla ebraccata_   _Hyla loquax_   _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_   _Smilisca phaeota cyanosticta_   _Anolis biporcatus_   _Anolis capito_   _Anolis humilis uniformis_   _Eumeces sumichrasti_   _Ameiva festiva edwardsi_   _Imantodes cenchoa leucomelas_   _Leptophis ahaetulla praestans_   _Xenodon rabdocephalus mexicanus_   _Bothrops nasutus_   _Bothrops schlegeli schlegeli_  Nevertheless, the region also provides at least a limited amount of habitat suitable for some species that are more frequently found in open forest of a drier nature; such species include:    _Hyla microcephala martini_   _Hyla staufferi_   _Hypopachus cuneus nigroreticulatus_   _Anolis sericeus sericeus_   _Eumeces schwartzei_   _Oxybelis aeneus aeneus_  Because of the absence of sufficiently open habitat or owing to the presence of competitors, some conspicuous members of sub-humid forests are not present in southern El Petén. Conspicuous absentees are the following:    _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_   _Phrynohyas spilomma_   _Triprion petasatus_   _Anolis tropidonotus_   _Ctenosaura similis_   _Ameiva undulata_   _Cnemidophorus angusticeps_   _Conophis lineatus_   _Masticophis mentovarius mentovarius_  PLATE 7  [Illustration: FIG. 1.

Rain pond in forest at Toocog. This was a breeding site for six species of frogs.]   Ecology of the Herpetofauna  Our two visits to Chinajá and Toocog afforded the opportunity to gather data on the ecology of the rainforests of southern El Petén and to study the relationships between the environment and members of the herpetofauna. Tropical rainforests present the optimum conditions for life, and it is in this environment that life reaches its greatest diversity. Here, too, biological inter-relationships are most complex. This complexity is illustrated by the presence of many species of some genera, all of which are found together in the same geographic region. In the rainforests of southern El Petén there are six species of _Anolis_, five of _Hyla_, four of _Bothrops_, and three of _Coniophanes_. Obviously, the diversity of ecological niches in the rainforest is sufficient to support a variety of related species. Of the examples mentioned above, fairly adequate ecological data were obtained for most of the species of _Anolis_, which will be used to show the ecological diversity and vertical stratification of sympatric species in the rainforests.  Of the six species of _Anolis_, all except _A. sericeus_ are typically found in humid forests. _Anolis sericeus sericeus_ is poorly represented in the collections from southern El Petén, where it may be in competition with _Anolis limifrons rodriguezi_ that resembles _Anolis s. sericeus_ in size, coloration, and habits. Therefore, _Anolis sericeus sericeus_ is excluded from the following discussion. The common terrestrial species is _Anolis humilis uniformis_; sometimes this small species perches or suns on the bases of small trees or buttresses of some large trees. When disturbed it takes to the ground and seeks cover in the leaf litter or beneath logs or palm fronds. _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ is about twice the size of _Anolis humilis uniformis_ and is usually observed on buttresses of large trees or on the lower two meters of tree trunks. Individuals were seen foraging on the ground along with _Anolis humilis uniformis_. At no time were _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ observed to ascend the trunks of large trees; they always took refuge near the bases of trees. _Anolis limifrons rodriguezi_ is found on the stems and branches of bushes. It is a small species that sometimes is observed on the ground but was never seen ascending large trees. _Anolis capito_ is about the same size as _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ and lives on the trunks of large trees. In the tops of the trees lives a large green species, _Anolis biporcatus_.  Similar segregation habitatwise can be demonstrated for other members of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38398"],["title","Amphibians and Reptiles of the Rainforests of Southern El Petén, Guatemala (#2)"],["body","auna. The avoidance of interspecific competition in feeding is well illustrated by three species of snakes that probably are the primary ophidian predators on frogs. _Drymobius margaritiferus margaritiferus_ is diurnal and terrestrial; it feeds on frogs at the edges of breeding ponds by day. Also during the day _Leptophis mexicanus mexicanus_ feeds on frogs in bushes and trees. At night the activities of both of these species is replaced by those of _Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta_, which not only feeds on the frogs in the trees and bushes, but descends to the ground and even enters the water in search of food.  From the examples discussed above, the importance of the three dimensional aspect of the rainforest is apparent. The presence of a large and diverse habitat above the ground is of great significance in the rainforest, for of the non-aquatic components of the herpetofauna in the rainforests of southern El Petén, 42 per cent of the species spend at least part of their lives in the bushes and trees. Another important part of the forest is the subterranean level--the rich mulch, underground tunnels, and rotting subterranean vegetation. Of the 78 species of amphibians and reptiles in southern El Petén, seven are primarily fossorial, and half-a-dozen others are secondarily fossorial. Probably the fossorial members of the fauna are the least well represented in the collection, for such widespread species as _Dermophis mexicanus mexicanus_, _Rhadinaea decorata decorata_ and _Tantilla schistosa schistosa_ were expected, but not found.  In the following discussion of the ecological distribution of amphibians and reptiles in the rainforest I have depended chiefly on my observations made in southern El Petén, but have taken into consideration observations made on the same species in other regions, together with reports from other workers. The reader should keep in mind that the evidence varies from species to species. Of some species I have observed only one animal in the field; of others, I have seen scores and sometimes hundreds of individuals. For species on which I have few observations or rather inconclusive evidence, the circumstance of inadequate data is mentioned.  In analyzing the ecological distribution within the forest, it is convenient to recognize five subdivisions (habitats); each is treated below as a unit.  1. AQUATIC.--This habitat includes permanent streams and rivers (Pl. 10, fig. 1), some of which are clear and others muddy. In the rainy season temporary ponds form in depressions on the forest floor (Pl. 10, fig. 2); these are important as breeding sites for many species of amphibians. Aquatic members of the herpetofauna are here considered to be those species that either spend the greatest part of their lives in the water or usually retreat to water for shelter. Seven species of turtles and one crocodilian are aquatic. Of these, _Dermatemys mawi_, _Staurotypus triporcatus_, and _Pseudemys scripta ornata_ inhabit clear water, whereas _Chelydra rossignoni_, _Claudius angustatus_, _Kinosternon acutum_, and _K. leucostomum_ inhabit muddy water. _Crocodylus moreleti_ apparently inhabits both clear and muddy water, for in the dry season it lives along the clear rivers, but in the rainy season inhabits flooded areas in the forest as well.  2. AQUATIC MARGIN.--Extensive marshes were lacking in the part of southern El Petén that I visited; consequently, the aquatic margin habitat is there limited to the edges of rivers and borders of temporary ponds. _Bufo marinus_, _Rana palmipes_, and _Rana pipiens_ are characteristic inhabitants of the aquatic margin, although in the rainy reason _Bufo marinus_ often is found away from water. Observations indicate that _Tretanorhinus nigroluteus lateralis_ inhabits the margins of ponds and streams and actually spends considerable time in the water. Although _Iguana iguana rhinolopha_ is arboreal, it lives in trees along rivers, into which it plunges upon being disturbed. Species included in this category are those that customarily spend most of their lives at the edge of permanent water. Frogs and toads that migrate to the water for breeding and the snakes that prey on the frogs at that time are not assigned to the aquatic-margin habitat.  3. FOSSORIAL.--Characteristic inhabitants of the mulch on the forest floor are _Bolitoglossa moreleti mulleri_, _Lepidophyma flavimaculatum flavimaculatum_, _Scincella cherriei cherriei_, _Ninia sebae sebae_, _Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis_, and _Micrurus affinis apiatus_. Other species of snakes that spend most of their lives above ground often forage in the mulch layer; among these are _Coniophanes bipunctatus biserialis_, _Coniophanes fissidens fissidens_, _Coniophanes imperialis clavatus_, _Lampropeltis doliata polyzona_, and _Stenorrhina degenhardti_. Among the amphibians, at least _Hypopachus cuneus nigroreticulatus_, _Eleutherodactylus rostralis_, and _Syrrhophus leprus_ are known to seek shelter in the mulch.  4. TERRESTRIAL.--One turtle, _Geoemyda areolata_, is primarily terrestrial. Among the lizards, conspicuous terrestrial species are _Anolis humilis uniformis_ and _Ameiva festiva edwardsi_; _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ and _Basiliscus vittatus_ spend part of their lives on the ground, but also live on trees and in bushes. _Eumeces schwartzei_ and _E. sumichrasti_ apparently are terrestrial. The only terrestrial lizard that is nocturnal is _Coleonyx elegans elegans_, which by day hides in the leaf litter or below ground. Nocturnal amphibians that are terrestrial include _Bufo marinus_, _Bufo valliceps valliceps_, _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus rugulosus_, _Syrrhophus leprus_, and _Hypopachus cuneus nigroreticulatus_. A large number of active diurnal snakes are terrestrial; these include _Boa constrictor imperator_, _Clelia clelia clelia_, _Dryadophis melanolomus laevis_, _Drymarchon corais melanurus_, _Drymobius margaritiferus margaritiferus_, _Pseustes poecilonotus poecilonotus_, and _Spilotes pullatus mexicanus_. Nocturnal terrestrial snakes include three kinds of _Bothrops_ (_B. atrox asper_, _B. nasutus_, and _B. nummifer nummifer_), all of which seem to be equally active by day.  5. ARBOREAL.--In this habitat the third dimension (height) of the rainforest probably is the most complex insofar as the inter-relationships of species and ecological niches are concerned. I have attempted to categorize species as to microhabitats within the arboreal habitat; in so doing, I recognize four subdivisions--bushes, tree trunks, tree tops, and epiphytes.  Bush inhabitants include several species of lizards and snakes, all of which have rather elongate, slender bodies, and long tails. Common bush-inhabitants in southern El Petén are _Anolis limifrons rodriguezi_, _Basiliscus vittatus_, _Laemanctus deborrei_, _Leptophis mexicanus mexicanus_, and _Oxybelis aeneus aeneus_. All of these are diurnal, and all but _Laemanctus_ have been observed sleeping on bushes at night.  Tree-trunk inhabitants include five species of lizards. _Thecadactylus rapicaudus_ lives on the trunks of large trees; _Sphaerodactylus lineolatus_ lives beneath the bark on dead trees and on corozo palms. _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ lives on the bases and buttresses of large trees, from which it often descends to the ground. _Corythophanes cristatus_ and _Anolis capito_ were found only on tree trunks and large vines.  The least information is available for the species living in the tree tops. The following species were obtained from tops of trees when they were felled, or have been observed living in the tree tops: _Anolis biporcatus_, _Iguana iguana rhinolopha_, _Celestus rozellae_, _Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta_, _Leptophis ahaetulla praestans_, _Sibon dimidiata dimidiata_, and _Sibon nebulata nebulata_.  Epiphytes, especially the bromeliads, provide refuge for a variety of tree frogs and small snakes. Of the tree frogs, _Hyla picta_, _Hyla staufferi_, _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_, _Similisca baudini_, and _Similisca phaeota cyanosticta_ have been found in bromeliads; other species probably occur there. Among the snakes, _Imantodes cenchoa leucomelas_, _Leptodeira frenata malleisi_, _Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta_, _Sibon dimidiata dimidiata_, and _Sibon nebulata nebulata_ are frequent inhabitants of bromeliads; all of these snakes are nocturnal.   Relationships of the Fauna  Most of the 78 species of amphibians and reptiles definitely known from the rainforest in southern El Petén have extensive ranges in the Atlantic lowlands of southern México and Central America; many extend into South America. Sixty-two (80%) of the species belong to this group having extensive ranges in Middle America. Three species (_Syrrhophus leprus_, _Leptodeira frenata_, and _Kinosternon acutum_) are at the southern limits of their distributions in southern El Petén and northern Alta Verapaz, whereas _Eleutherodactylus rostralis_ and _Thecadactylus rapicaudus_ are at the northern and western limits of their distributions in El Petén. Nine (11%) species have the center of their distributions in El Petén and the Yucatán Peninsula; representatives of this group include _Claudius angustatus_, _Dermatemys mawi_, _Laemanctus deborrei_, and _Eumeces schwartzei_.  In determining a measure of faunal resemblance, I have departed from the formulae discussed by Simpson (1960) and have analyzed the degree of resemblance by the following formula used to calculate an index of faunal relationships:        C (2) / (N_{1} + N_{2}) = R, where        C = species common to both faunas.        N_{1} = number of species in the first fauna.        N_{2} = number of species in the second fauna.        R = degree of relationships (when R = 1.00, the faunas are       identical; when R = 0, the faunas are completely different).  The herpetofauna of southern El Petén has been compared with that in the Tikal-Uaxactún area (Stuart, 1958), that in the humid lowlands of Alta Verapaz (Stu"]]]
