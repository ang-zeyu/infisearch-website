But tell us, sirrah, how travels his innocence?’  ’On foot, my lord, like a prophet’s.’  ’’Twill the sooner lie prone.’  He turned to my lady. ’Wouldst like to add him to Cicada and thy monkey, and carry him along with us?’  ’Nay,’ she said pettishly, ’I have enough of monstrosities. Will you keep me in the sun all day?’  ’Well,’ said Lanti, gathering his reins, ’it puzzles me only how the Abbot could part thus with his discretion.’  ’Nay, Illustrious,’ answered the landlord, ’he was in a grievous pet, ’tis stated.  But, there! prophecy will no more be denied than love.  A’ must out or kill.  And so he had to let Messer Bembo go his gaits with a letter only to this monastery and that, in providence of a sanctuary, and one even, ’tis whispered, to the good Duchess Bona herself.  But here, by the token, he comes.’  He bowed deferentially, backing apart.  Messer Lanti stared, and gave a profound whistle.  ’O, indeed!’ he muttered, showing his strong teeth, ’this Giuseppe propagates the faith very prettily!’  Madam Beatrice was staring too.  She expressed no further impatience to be gone for the moment.  A young man, followed by some kitchen company adoring and obsequious, had come out by the door, and stood regarding her quietly.  She had expected some apparition of austerity, some lean, neurotic friar, wasting between dogmatism and sensuality.  And instead she saw an angel of the breed that wrestled with Jacob.  He was so much a child in appearance, with such an aspect of wonder and prettiness, that the first motion of her heart towards him was like the leap of motherhood. Then she laughed, with a little dye come to her cheek, and eyed him over the screen of feathers she held in her hand.  He advanced into the sunlight.  ’Greeting, sweet Madonna,’ he said, in his grave young voice, ’and fair as your face be your way!’ and he was offering to pass her.  She could only stare, the bold jade, at a loss for an answer.  The soft umber eyes of the youth looked into hers.  They were round and velvety as a rabbit’s, with high, clean-pencilled brows over.  His nose was short and pretty broad at the bridge, and his mouth was a little mouth, pouting as a child’s, something combative, and with lips like tinted wax.  Like a girl’s his jaw was round and beardless, and his hair a golden fleece, cut square at the neck, and its ends brittle as if they had been singed in fire.  His doublet and hose were of palest pink; his bonnet, shoes, and mantlet of cypress-green velvet.  Rose-coloured ribbons, knotted into silver buckles, adorned his feet; and over his shoulder, pendent from a strand of the same hue, was slung a fair lute. He could not have passed, by his looks, his sixteenth summer.  Lanti pushed rudely forward.  ’A moment, saint troubadour, a moment!’ he cried. ’It will please us, hearing of your mission, to have a taste of your quality.’  The youth, looking at him a little, swung his lute forward and smiled.  ’What would you have, gracious sir?’ he said.  ’What?  Why, prophesy us our case in parable.’  ’I know not your name nor calling.’  ’A pretty prophet, forsooth.  But I will enlighten thee. I am Carlo Lanti, gentleman of the Duke, and this fair lady the wife of him we call the Count of Casa Caprona.’  The boy frowned a little, then nodded and touched the strings.  And all in a moment he was improvising the strangest ditty, a sort of cantefable between prose and song:—      ’A lord of little else possessed a jewel,     Of his small state incomparably the crown.     But he, going on a journey once,     To his wife committed it, saying,     \"This trust with you I pledge till my return;     See, by your love, that I redeem my trust.\"     But she, when he was gone, thinking \"he will not know,\"     Procured its exact fellow in green glass,     And sold her lord’s gem to one who bid her fair;     Then, conscience-haunted, wasted all those gains     Secretly, without enjoyment, lest he should hear and wonder.     But he returning, she gave him the bauble,     And, deceived, he commended her; and, shortly after, dying,     Left her that precious jewel for all dower,     Bequeathing elsewhere the residue of his estate.     Now, was not this lady very well served,     Inheriting the whole value, as she had appraised it,     Of her lord’s dearest possession?     Gentles, Dishonour is a poor estate.’   Half-chaunting, half-talking, to an accompaniment of soft-touched chords, he ended with a little shrug of abandonment, and dropped the lute from his fingers. His voice had been small and low, but pure; the sweet thrum of the strings had lifted it to rhapsody.  Messer Lanti scratched his head.  ’Well, if that is a parable!’ he puzzled.  ’But supposing it aims at our case, why—Casa Caprona is neither poor nor dead; and as to a jewel——’  He looked at Madam Beatrice, who was frowning and biting her lip.  ’Why heed the peevish stuff?’ she said.  ’Will you come?  I am sick to be moving.’  Carlo was suddenly illuminated.  ’O, to be sure, of course!’ he ejaculated—’the jewel——’  ’Hold your tongue!’ cried the lady sharply.  The honest blockhead went into a roar of laughter.  ’He has touched thee, he has touched thee!  And these are his means to convert the Duke!  By Saint Ambrose, ’twill be a game to watch!  I swear he shall go with us.’  ’Not with my consent,’ cried madam.  Carlo, chuckling tormentingly, looked at her, then doffed his cap mockingly to the boy.  ’Sweet Messer Bembo,’ he said, ’I take your lesson much to heart, and pray you gratefully—as we are both for Milan, I understand—to give us the honour of your company thither.  I am in good standing with the Duke, I say, and you would lose nothing by having a friend at court. Those half-boots’—he glanced at the pretty pumps—’could as ill afford the penalties of the road as your innocence its dangers.’  ’I have no more fear than my divine Master,’ said the boy boldly, ’in carrying His gospel of love.’  ’Well for you,’ said Carlo, with a grin of approval for his spirit; ’but a gospel that goes in silken doublet and lovelocks is like to be struck dumb before it is uttered.’  ’As to my condition, sir,’ said the boy, ’I dress as for a feast, our Master having prepared the board.  Are we not redeemed and invited?  We walk in joy since the Resurrection, and Limbo is emptied of its gloom. The kingdom of man shall be love, and the government thereof.  Preach heresy in rags.  ’Twas the Lord Abbot equipped me thus, my own stout heart prevailing. \"Well, they will encounter an angel walking by the road,\" quoth he, \"and, if they doubt, show ’em thy white shoulder-knobs, little Bernardino, and they will see the wings sprouting underneath like the teeth in a baby’s gums.\"’  He was evidently, if sage or lunatic, an amazing child. The rough libertine was quite captivated by him.  ’Well, you will come with us, Bernardino?’ said he; ’for with a cracked skull it might go hard with you to prove your shoulder-blades.’  ’I will come, lord, to reap the harvest where I have sowed the grain.’  He looked with a serene severity at the countess.  ’Shalt take thee pillion, Beatrice,’ shouted Lanti.  ’Up, pretty troubadour, and recount her more parables by the way.’  ’May I die but he shall not,’ cried the girl.  ’He shall, I say.’  ’I will bite, and rake him with my nails.’  ’The more fool you, to spoil a saint!  Reproofs come not often in such a guise as this.  Up, Bernardino, and parable her into submission!’  She made a show of resisting, in the midst of which Bembo won to his place deftly on the fore-saddle.  At the moment of his success, the fool Cicada sprang from the tavern door, and, lurching with wild, glazed eyes, leapt, hooting, upon the crupper of the beast, almost bringing it upon its haunches.  With an oath Lanti brought down his whip with such fury that the fool rolled in the dust.  ’Drunken dog!’ he roared, and would have ridden over the writhing body, had not Bembo backed the white palfrey to prevent him.  ’Thou strik’st the livery, not the man!’ he cried. ’Hast never thyself been drunk, and without the excuse of this poor fool to make a trade of folly?’  Messer Lanti glared, then in a moment laughed.  The battered grasshopper took advantage of the diversion to rise and slink to the rear.  The next moment the whole cavalcade was in motion.                                   *CHAPTER II*   They travelled on till sundown through the green plains; and, for one good hour dating from their start, not a word would Madam Beatrice utter.  Then she gave out—Messer Carlo being a distance in advance—but with no grace at all.  ’You are an ill horseman, Saint.  I am near jogged from my seat.’  ’Put thine arms about me.’  ’Nay, I am not holy enough.’  She was silent again, for five minutes.  ’Your lute bangs my nose.’  He shifted it.  She held her peace during two minutes.  ’Who taught you to play it, Saint?’  ’It was one of the fathers.  What would it profit you to know which?’  ’Nothing at all.  I trow he was a good master to that and your gospel.’  ’My gospel?’  ’Ay, of love.  He has made you worldly-wise for a saint.  Hast ever before been beyond thy walls?’  ’Of course.’  ’And studied this and that?  Experience, methinks is the right nurse for such a creed.  What made you accuse me of dishonour?’  ’I did not.’  ’Nay, is that to be a saint?’  ’Whom the shoe fits, let her wear it.’  ’Bernardo!  _Where got you the shoe_?’  ’Does it fit, I say?’  ’I fear me ’twas in some bagnio.’  ’Where you had dropped it?  For shame!’  A rather long pause.  ’I will not be angry—just yet.  Where got you the shoe, I say?  An eavesdropper is well equipped for a prophet.’  ’I am no eavesdropper.’  ’Who enlightened you?’  ’Your cicisbeo.’  ’Under that title?’  ’Nay; it is not the devil’s policy to call"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],["title","A Jay of Italy (#2)"],["body","devil.’  A shorter pause.  ’But you had heard of me?’  ’Nothing escapes the Church’s hearing.  Besides, Messer Lanti’s summer lodge is within call, one may say of San Zeno.’  ’You are daring.  Dost know in what high favour he stands with the Duke?’  ’Else how could he have compassed Uriah’s dismissal to the wars?’  Silence, and then a sigh.  ’Whom do you mean by Uriah?’  ’Thy lord, the Count of Casa Caprona.’  ’He is a soldier, and an old man.’  ’Didst covenant with his age in thy marriage vows?’  ’Bernardino, I am very sleepy.’  ’Sleep, then, and forget thyself, and awake, another.’  She sighed, and put her arms softly about him and her cheek against his shoulder.  Messer Lanti, falling back, saw her thus, with closed eyes; and laughed, and then frowned, and cried boisterously—  ’Hast converted her, Parablist?  Art a saint indeed?’  He spurred forward again, with a discontented look, and madam opened her eyes.  ’What gossips are thine old monks, Bernardino; and what hypocrites, denouncing the licence they example!’  ’I know not what you mean.’  ’Are they all saints, then, in San Zeno?’  ’That is for Rome to say.  It is a good law which lays down this wine of sanctity to mature.  In a hundred years we shall know what stood the test.’  ’Ah me!  And I am but seventeen.  Will you speak for your Abbot?’  ’Ay, like a dear son.’  ’Is he your father, Bernardo?’  ’Is he not the father of us all?’  ’Maybe.  But ’tis of Benjamin I ask.  Now, he is a strange father, methinks, to bid his Benjamin, thus apparelled, on a wild goose chase.’  ’He could not discount the voices.’  ’What voices?’  The boy lifted his face and eyes to the heavens, and lowered them again with no answer but a sigh of rapture.  ’So?  And did the voices bid thee wear a velvet mantlet and roses to thy shoes?’ whispered the girl, with a tiny chuckle.  ’They said, \"Not in cockle shells, but a plume, goes the Pilgrim of Love,\"’ answered Bembo.  ’As I am and have been, God finds me fitting in His sight.’  ’And the Father Abbot, I wot?’  ’Yes: \"Since,\" says he, \"Christ bequeathed His Kingdom to beauty.\"’  ’And you have inherited it?  I think I will be your subject, Bernardo.’  ’I hope so, Madonna.’  He spoke perfectly gravely, and made her a little courtly gesture backwards.  ’Well,’ said she, ’had _I_ been Father Abbot, I had put this pet of my fancy in a cage.’  ’You know not of what you speak,’ he answered seriously.  ’God works great ends with little instruments. The puny bee is yet the very fairy midwife of the forests, I should have broke my heart had he denied me.’  ’It would have saved others, alack!’  ’What do you mean?’  ’Nothing at all.  Will you sing me another parable, Bernardo?’  ’Ay, Madonna; and on what subject?  The woman taken in adultery?’  ’If you like; and whom Christ forgave.’  ’_And He said: \"Go, and sin no more\"_’  She began to weep softly.  ’It is shocking to be so abused for a little thing.  I would you were back with your monks.’  He sighed.  ’Ah!’ she murmured, still weeping, ’that this bee had been content to remain a pander to his flowers!  To dup hell’s door with a reed!  You know not to what you have engaged yourself, my poor boy.’  ’To Christ, His service of Love,’ he said simply.  ’Go back, go back!’ she cried in pain.  ’There are ten thousand sophisters to interpret that word according to their lusts.  Convert Galeazzo?  Convert the brimstone lake from burning!  Dost know the manner of man he is?’  ’Else why am I here?’  ’Ay, but his moods, his passions, his nameless, shameless deeds?  He hath no pity but for his desires; no mercy but through his caprices.  To cross him is to taste the rack, the fire, the living burial.  He is possessed. Some believe him Caligula reincarnate—an atavism of that dreadful stock.  And dost think to quench that furnace with a parable? Unless, indeed—Go back, little Bembo, and waste thy passion for reform on thy monks.’  ’Madonna,’ he said, ’I obey the voices.  I shall not be let to perish, since Christ died to save His world to loveliness.’  It was the early rapture of the renaissance, penetrating like an April song into these newly reclaimed lands.  The wind blew from Florence, and all the peaceful vales, so long trodden into a bloody mire, were awakening to the ecstasy of the _Promise_.  That men interpreted according to their lights—lights burning fast and passionate in most places, but in a few quiet and holy.  The breed of German bandits, of foreign mercenaries, was swept away.  Gone was the whole warring race of the Visconti, and in its place the peasant Sforza had set a guard about the land of his fierce adoption, that he might till and graft and prosper in peace.  Italy had asserted itself the inheritance of its children, the Court of God’s Vicegerent, the chosen land of Love’s gospel.  That, too, men interpreted according to their lights.  ’We are all the vineyard of Rome,’ said the little Parablist.  Alas! he thought Rome the Holy of Holies, and his father a saint.  But his father, who adored him, had committed him, with his blessing, to this mad romance! Such were the paradoxes of the Gospel of Love.  Beatrice spoke no more, and they rode on in silence. About evening they came into a pleasant dell, where there was a level sward among rocks; and a little stream, running down a stairway of stones, dropped laughing, like a child going to bed, into the quiet of a rushy pool. Great chestnuts clothed the slopes, and made a mantle, powdered with stars, to the setting sun.  It was a very nest for love.  Messer Lanti, halting, commanded the green tents to be pitched on the grass.  Then, with a stormy scowl and a mockery of courtesy, he came to dismount his lady.  ’Now,’ says he, as he got her aside, ’if I do not show thy saint to be a petticoat, my hug of thee is like to prove a bear’s.’  ’What!’ she said, amazed: ’Bernardo?’  He ground his teeth.  ’I do not mark his pink cheeks for nothing.’  ’Well, an he be,’ she retorted coldly, ’I am liker, than if he be not, to lose my gallant.’  ’That depends,’ he growled, ’upon whom your fickleship honours with that title’; and he strode away, calling roughly to Bembo, ’Art for a bath, saint, before supper?’  ’Why, gladly, Carlo,’ said the boy, ’so we may be private.’  They went down to the pool together, and stripped and entered.  Lanti saw a Ganymede, and was not pleased thereat.  He came to supper in a very bad humour, which no innocent artifice of his guest could allay. The kill that day of their falcons—partridges, served in their own feathers, and stuffed with artichokes and truffles—was tough; the pears and peaches were sour; the confetti savourless and of stale design.  He rated his cook, cursed his servitors, and drank more than he ate.  When the disagreeable meal was ended, he strode ruffling away, saying he desired his own sole company, which it were well that all should respect. Bembo saw him go, with a sigh and a smile.  ’Good, honest soul,’ quoth he, ’that already wakes to the reckoning!’  Madam misunderstood him, and pressed a little closer, with a happy echo of his sigh.  Her eyes were soft with wine and passion.  She had no precedent for doubting her influence on the moment she chose to make her own.  ’The reckoning!’ she murmured.  ’But I am wax in thy hands, pretty saint.  Shalt confess me, and take what toll thou wilt of my sins?’  Her hand settled light as a bird on his.  ’Sing to me, Bernardino,’ she whispered wooingly, ’sith the cloud is gone from our moon, and I am in the will to love.’  He shot one little startled glance her way; then slowly slung round his lute, and, touching the strings pensively, melted into the following reproach:—      ’Speak low!  What do you ask, false love?  Speak low!       Sin cannot speak too low.     The night-wind stealing to thy bosom,     The dead star, dropping like a blossom,       Less voiceless be than thou!      Low, lower yet, false love, if to confess       What guilt, what shameful need?     God, who can hear the budding grass,     And flake kiss flake in the snowy pass,       Your secret else will heed.      Ah! thou art silent, not from love, but fear,       And true love knows no fear.     Creeping, soft-footed, in the dust,     It is not love, but conscious lust,       Which dreads that God shall hear.’   He rose swiftly beside her, while she sat, dumbly biting a lock of her own hair.  The frown of outraged passion was in her eyes.  What had the fool dared in rejecting her!  To touch the perfumed essence of sin with a rebuke which was like a caress—that, _pace_ his monks, was Bernardo’s rendering of the Gospel; and who shall say that, in its girlish tenderness, its earnest emotionalism, it was not the most dangerous method of all?  Not every adulterous woman is fit to meet the gentle fate of Christ’s.  It is not always well to doctor too much kindness with more.  Surfeit, surely, is not safely cured, unless by a God, with sugar-plums.  ’For shame!’ he said quietly; ’for shame!  Christ weeps for thee!’  She looked up with a frozen, insolent smile.  ’Yet there is no tear in all the night, prophet.’  He raised his hand.  A star trailed down the sky, and disappeared behind the trees.  It startled her for a moment, and in that moment he was gone, striding into the moonlight.  She saw a sword gleam in the shadow of the tent.  ’Carlo!’ she hissed; ’Carlo! follow and kill him!’  Messer Lanti came out of his ambush, sheathing his blade.  His teeth grinned in the white glow.  He sauntered up to her, and stood looking down, hand on hip.  ’Not for all the bona-robas in the world,’ he said, and struck his hilt lightly.  ’This I dedicate to his service from this day.  Let who crosses my little saint beware it.’  He burst out laughing, not fierce, but low.  ’Thou art well served in thy confessor, woman.  Wert never dealt a fitter penance.’  It was significant enough that he had no word but mockery for her discomfiture.  He might have spitted the seduced on a point of gallantry; for the siren,"]]]
