He kicked backward gently, hoping that Pierrette, who sat next, would prompt him, but she too failed to respond. \"I'll ask a question,\" thought Pierre desperately, \"and while the Abbe is answering maybe it will come to me.\" Aloud he said: \"If you please, your reverence, I don't understand about that commandment. It says, 'Thou shalt not kill,' and yet our soldiers have gone to war on purpose to kill Germans, and the priests blessed them as they marched away!\"  This was indeed a question! The class gasped with astonishment at Pierre's boldness in asking it. The Abbe paused a moment before answering. Then he said, \"If you, Pierre, were to shoot a man in the street in order to take his purse, would that be wrong?\"  \"Yes,\" answered the whole class.  \"Very well,\" said the Abbe, \"so it would. But if you should see a murderer attack your mother or your sister, and you should kill him before he could carry out his wicked purpose, would that be just the same thing?\"  \"No,\" wavered the class, a little doubtfully.  \"If instead of defending your mother or sister you were simply to stand aside and let the murderer kill them both, you would really be helping the murderer, would you not? It is like that today in France. An enemy is upon us who seeks to kill us so that he may rob us of our beautiful home land. God sees our hearts. He knows that the soldiers of France go forth not to kill Germans but to save France! not wantonly to take life, but because it is the only way to save lives for which they themselves are ready to die. Ah, my children, it is one thing to kill as a murderer kills; it is quite another to be willing to die that others may live! Our Blessed Lord--\"  The Abbe lifted his hand to make the sign of the Cross--but it was stayed in mid-air. The sentence he had begun was never finished, for at that moment the great bell in the Cathedral tower began to ring. It was not the clock striking the hour; it was not the chimes calling the people to prayer. Instead, it was the terrible sound of the alarm bell ringing out a warning to the people of Rheims that the Germans were at their doors.  Wide-eyed with terror, the children sprang from their seats, but the Abbe, with hand uplifted, blocked the entrance and commanded them to stay where they were.  \"Let no one leave the Cathedral,\" he cried.  At this instant Mother Meraut appeared upon the threshold searching for her children, and behind her, coming as fast as his lameness would permit, came the Verger. The Abbe turned to them. \"I leave these children all in your care,\" he said. \"Stay with them until I return.\"  And without another word he disappeared in the shadows.  Mother Meraut sat down on one of the chairs she had dusted so carefully, and gathered the frightened children about her as a hen gathers her chickens under her wing. \"There, now,\" she said cheerfully, as she wiped their tears upon the corner of her apron, \"let's save our tears until we really know what we have to cry for. There never yet was misery that couldn't be made worse by crying, anyway. The boys will be brave, of course, whatever happens. And the girls--surely they will remember that it was a girl who once saved France, and meet misfortune bravely, like our blessed Saint Jeanne d'Arc.\"  The Cathedral organ had ceased to fill the great edifice with sweet and inspiring sounds. Instead, there now was only the muffled tread of marching feet, the rumble of heavy wheels, and the low, ominous beating of drums to break the stillness.  Mother Meraut and the children waited obediently in the chapel, scarcely breathing in their suspense, while Father Varennes went tap-tapping up and down the aisles eagerly watching for the Abbe to reappear. At last he came. Mother Meraut, the Verger, and the children all crowded about him, waiting breathlessly for him to speak.  The Abbe was pale, but his voice was firm. \"I have been to the north tower,\" he said, \"and there I could see for miles in every direction. Far away to the east and north are massed the hordes of the German Army; they are coming toward Rheims as a thunder-cloud comes rolling over the sky. Between us and them is our Army, but alas, their faces are turned this way. They are retreating before the German hosts! Already French troops are marching through Rheims; already the streets are filled with people who are fleeing from their homes for fear of the Boche. Unless God sends a miracle, our City is indeed doomed, for a time at least, to wear the German yoke.\"  He paused, and the children burst into wild weeping. Mother Meraut hushed them with comforting words. \"Do not cry, my darlings,\" she said. \"God is not dead, and we shall yet live to see justice done and our dear land restored to us. The soldiers now in the streets are all our own brave defenders. We shall be able to go in safety, even though in sorrow, to our homes.\"  \"Come,\" said the Abbe, \"there is no time to lose. Our Army will, without doubt, make a stand on the plains west of the City, and it will not be long before the Germans pass through. You must go to your homes as fast as possible. Henri, you remain here with your Jean, that you may meet any of the parents who come for their children. Tell them I have gone with them myself and will deliver each child safely at his own door.\"  \"I can take cart of my own,\" said Mother Meraut. \"You need have no fear for us.\"  \"Very well,\" said the Abbe, and, calling the rest of the children about him, he marched them down the aisle and out into the street.  Mother Meraut followed with Pierre and Pierrette. At the door they paused and stood for a moment under the great sculptured arches to survey the scene before them. The great square before the Cathedral was filled with people, some weeping, others standing about as if dazed by sorrow. Between the silent crowds which lined the sidewalks passed the soldiers, grim and with set faces, keeping time to the throbbing of the drums as they marched. Above the scene, in the center of the square, towered the beautiful statue of Jeanne d'Arc, mounted upon her charger and lifting her sword toward the sky.  \"Ah,\" murmured Mother Meraut to herself, \"our blessed Maid still keeps guard above the City!\" She lifted her clasped hands toward the statue. \"Blessed Saint Jeanne,\" she prayed, \"hear us in Paradise, and come once more to save our beautiful France!\"  Then, waving a farewell to the Verger and Jean, who had followed them to the door, she took her children by the hand and plunged with them into the sad and silent crowd.    II. ON THE WAY HOME  For some time after leaving the Cathedral, Mother Meraut and the Twins lingered in the streets, forgetful of everything but the retreating Army and the coming invasion. Everywhere there were crowds surging to and fro. Some were hastening to close their places of business and put up their shutters before the Germans should arrive. Some were hurrying through the streets carrying babies and bundles. Others were wheeling their few belongings upon barrows or in baby-carriages. Still others flew by on bicycles with packages of clothing fastened to the handle-bars; and there were many automobiles loaded to the brim with household goods and fleeing families.  Doors were flung open and left swinging on their hinges as people escaped, scarcely looking behind them as they fled. These were refugees from Rheims itself. There were many others wearily plodding through the City, people who had come from Belgium and the border towns of France. Some who had come from farms drove pitiful cattle before them, and some journeyed in farm wagons, with babies and old people, chickens, dogs, and household goods mixed in a heap upon beds of straw. In all the City there was not a cheerful sight, and everywhere, above all other sounds, were heard the rumble of wheels, the sharp clap-clap of horses' hoofs upon the pavement, and the steady beat of marching feet.  At last, weary and heartsick, the three wanderers turned into a side street and stepped into a little shop where food was sold. \"We must have some supper,\" said Mother Meraut to the Twins, \"Germans or no Germans! One cannot carry a stout heart above an empty stomach! And if it is to be our last meal in French Rheims, let us at least make it a good one!\" Though there was a catch in her voice, she smiled almost gaily as she spoke. \"Who knows?\" she went on. \"Perhaps after to-morrow we shall be able to get nothing but sauerkraut and sausage!\"  The shop was not far from the little home of the Merauts, and they often bought things of stout Madame Coudert, whose round face with its round spectacles rose above the counter like a full moon from behind a cloud. \"Ah, mon amie,\" said Mother Meraut as she entered the shop, \"it is good to see you sitting in your place and not running away like a hare before the hounds!\"  Madame Coudert shrugged her shoulders. \"But of what use is it to run when one has no place to run to?\" she demanded. \"As for me, I stay by the shop and die at least respectably among my own cakes and pies. To run through the country and die at last in a ditch--it would not suit me at all!\"  \"Bravo,\" cried Mother Meraut triumphantly. \"Just my own idea! My children and I will remain in our home and take what comes, rather than leap from the frying-pan into the fire as so many are doing. If every one runs away, there will be no Rheims at all.\" Then to Pierre and Pierrette she said \"Choose, each of you. What shall we buy for our supper?\"  Pierre pointed a grimy finger at a small cake with pink frosting. \"That,\" he said briefly.  His mother smiled. \"Ah, Pierre, that sweet-tooth of yours!\" she cried. \"Like Marie Antoinette you think if one lacks bread one may eat cakes! And now it is Pierrette's turn; only be quick, ma mie, for it is already late.\"  \"Eggs,\" said Pierrette promptly, \"for one of your savory omelets, mamma, and a bit of cheese.\"  The purchases were quickly made, and, having said good-night to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4091"],["title","The French Twins (#2)"],["body","Coudert, they hurried on to the little house in the Rue Charly where they lived. When they reached home, it was already quite dark. Mother Meraut hastened up the steps and unlocked the door, and in less time than it takes to tell it her bonnet was off, the fire was burning, and the omelet was cooking on the stove.  Pierrette set the table. \"I'm going to place father's chair too,\" she said to her mother. \"He is no doubt thinking of us as we are of him, and it will make him stem nearer.\"  Mother Meraut nodded her head without speaking, and wiped her eyes on her apron as she slid the omelet on to a hot plate. Then she seated herself opposite the empty chair and with a steady voice prayed for a blessing upon the food and upon the Armies of France.  When they had finished supper, cleared it away, and put the kitchen in order, Mother Meraut pointed to the clock. \"Voila!\" she cried, \"hours past your bedtime, and here you are still flapping about like two young owls! To bed with you as fast as you can go.\"  \"But, Mother,\" began Pierre.  \"Not a single 'but,'\" answered his Mother, wagging her finger at him. \"Va!\"  The children knew protest was useless, and in a few minutes they were snugly tucked away. Long after they were both sound asleep, their Mother sat with her head bowed upon the table, listening, listening to the distant sound of marching feet. At last, worn out with grief and anxiety, she too undressed, said her rosary, and, after a long look at her sleeping children, blew out the candle and crept into bed beside Pierrette.  Silence and darkness settled down upon the little household, and, for a time at least, their sorrows were forgotten in the blessed oblivion of sleep.    III. THE COMING OF THE GERMANS  When the Twins opened their eyes the next morning, the first thing they saw was the sun shining in at the eastern window of the kitchen, and Mother Meraut bending over the fire. There was a smell of chocolate in the air, and on the table there were rolls and butter. Pierre yawned and rubbed his eyes. Pierrette sat up and tried to think what it was she was so unhappy about; sleep had, for the time being, swept the terrors of the night quite out of her mind. In an instant more the fearful truth rolled over her like a wave, and she sank back upon the pillow with a little moan.  Her Mother heard and understood. She too had waked from sleep to sorrow, but she only cried out cheerfully, \"Bonjour, my sleepy heads! Last night you did not want to go to your beds at all. This morning you wish not to leave them! Hop into your clothes as fast as you can, or we shall be late.\"  \"Late where?\" asked Pierre.  \"To my work at the Cathedral, to be sure,\" answered Mother Meraut promptly. \"Where else? Did you think the Germans would make me sit at home and cry for terror while my work waits? Whoever rules in Rheims, the Cathedral still stands and must be kept clean.\"  It was wonderful how the dismal world brightened to Pierre and Pierrette as they heard their Mother's brave voice. They flew out of bed at once and were dressed in a twinkling.  While they ate their breakfast, Pierre thought of a plan. \"We ought to take a lot of food with us to-day,\" he said to his Mother. \"There's no telling what may happen before night. Maybe we can't get home at all and shall have to sleep in the Cathedral.\"  \"Oh,\" shuddered Pierrette, \"among all those tombs?\"  \"There are worse places where one might sleep,\" said the Mother. \"The dead are less to be feared than the living, and the Cathedral is the safest place in Rheims.\" She brought out a wicker basket and began to pack it with food as she talked. First she put in two pots of jam. \"There,\" said she, \"that's the jam Grandmother made from her gooseberries at the farm.\"  She paused, struck by a new alarm. Her father and mother lived in a tiny village far west of Rheims. What if the Germans should succeed in getting so far as that? What would become of them? She shut her fears in her breast, saying nothing to the children, and went on filling the basket. \"Here is a bit of cheese left from last night. I'll put that in, and a pat of butter,\" she said; \"but we must stop at Madame Coudert's for more bread. You two little pigs have eaten every scrap there was in the house.\"  \"There are eggs left,\" suggested Pierrette.  \"So there are, ma mie,\" said her Mother. \"We will boil them all and take them with us. There's a great deal of nourishment in eggs.\" She flew to get the saucepan, and while the eggs bubbled and boiled on the stove, she and the children set the little kitchen in order and got themselves ready for the street.  It was after nine o'clock when at last Mother Meraut took the basket on her arm and gave Pierrette her knitting to carry, and the three started down the steps.  \"Everything looks just the same as it did yesterday,\" said Pierrette as they walked down the street. \"There's that little raveled-out dog that always barks at Pierre, and there's Madame Coudert's cat asleep on the railing, just as she always is.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mother Meraut, with a sigh, \"the cats and dogs are the same, it is only the people who are different!\"  They entered the shop and exchanged greetings with Madame Coudert. They had bought a long loaf of bread, and Mother Meraut was just opening her purse to pay for it, when suddenly a shot rang out. It was followed by the rattle of falling tiles. Another and another came, and soon there was a perfect rain of shot and shell.  \"It is the Germans knocking at the door of Rheims before they enter,\" remarked Madame Coudert with grim humor. \"I did not expect so much politeness!\"  Mother Meraut did not reply. For once her cheerful tongue found nothing comforting to say. Pierre clung to her arm, and Pierrette put her fingers in her ears and hid her face against her Mother's breast.  For some time the deafening sounds continued. From the window they could see people running for shelter in every direction. A man came dashing down the street; dodging falling tiles as he ran, and burst into Madame Coudert's shop. He had just come from the Rue Colbert and had news to tell. \"The Boches have sent an emissary to the Mayor to demand huge supplies of provisions from the City, and a great sum of money besides,\" he told them, as he gasped for breath. \"They are shelling the champagne cellars and the public buildings of the City to scare us into giving them what they demand. The German Army will soon be here.\"  In a few moments there was a lull in the roar of the guns, and then in the distance another sound was heard. It was a mighty song of triumph as the conquerors came marching into Rheims!  \"There won't be any more shooting for a while anyway,\" said the stranger, who had now recovered his breath. \"They won't shell the City while it's full of their own men. I'm going to see them come in.\"  All Pierre's fears vanished in an instant. \"Come on,\" he cried, wild with excitement; \"let us go too.\"  \"I'll not stir a foot from my shop,\" said Madame Coudert firmly. \"I don't want to see the Germans, and if they want to see me, they can come where I am.\"  But Pierre had not waited for a reply, from her or any one else. He was already running up the street.  \"Catch him, catch him,\" gasped Mother Meraut.  Pierrette dashed after Pierre, and as she could run like the wind, she soon caught up with him and seized him by the skirt of his blouse. \"Stop! stop!\" she screamed. \"Mother doesn't want you to go.\"  But she might as well have tried to argue with a hurricane. Pierre danced up and down with rage, as Pierrette braced herself, and firmly anchored him by his blouse. \"Leggo, leggo!\" he shrieked. \"I'm going, I tell you! I'm not afraid of any Germans alive.\"  Just then, panting and breathless, Mother Meraut arrived upon the scene. While Pierrette held on to his blouse, she attached herself to his left ear. It had a very calming effect upon Pierre. He stopped tugging to get away lest he lose his ear.  \"Foolish boy,\" said his Mother, \"see how much trouble you give me! You shall see the Germans, but you shall not run away from me. If we should get separated, God only knows whether we should ever find each other again.\"  The music had grown louder and louder, and was now very near. \"I'll stay with you, if you'll only go,\" pleaded Pierre, \"but you aren't even moving.\"  \"Come, Pierrette,\" said his Mother, \"take hold of his left arm. I will attend to his right; he might forget again. What he really needs is a bit and bridle!\"  The three moved up the street, Pierre chafing inwardly, but helpless in his Mother's grasp, and at the next crossing the great spectacle burst upon them. A whole regiment of cavalry was passing, singing at the top of their lungs, \"Lieb' Vaterland, macht ruhig sein.\" The sun glistened on their helmets, and the clanking of swords and the jingling of spurs kept time with the swelling chorus. After the cavalry came soldiers on foot--miles of them.  \"Oh,\" murmured Pierrette, clinging to her Mother, \"it's like a river of men!\"  Her Mother did not answer. Pierrette looked up into her face. The tears were streaming down her cheeks, but her head was proudly erect. She looked at the other French people about them. There were tears on many cheeks, but not a head was bowed. Pierre was glaring at the troops and muttering through his teeth: \"Just you wait till I grow up! I'll make you pay for this, you pirates! I'll--\"  \"Hush!\" whispered Pierrette. \"Suppose they should hear you!\"  \"I don't care if they do! I wish they would!\" raged Pierre. \"I'm going--\"  But the German Army was destined not to suffer the consequences of Pierre's wrath. He did not even have a chance to tell Pierrette his plan for their destruction, for at this point his Mother, unable longer to endure the sight, dragged him forcibly from the scene. \"They shall not parade their colors before me,\" she said firmly, \"I will not stand still and look in silence upon my conquerors! If I could but face them with a gun, that would be different!\"  "]]]
