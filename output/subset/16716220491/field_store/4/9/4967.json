Nancy caught wildly at the clothes hammock to keep from being hurled into the aisle, as the Pullman crashed to a stop and toppled slightly to the right. Screams and moans were heard above the grinding noises.  Nancy clung to the hammock a moment, too stunned to move. She expected the tilting coach to crash to earth any moment. Lights had vanished beyond the cracks of her curtain. With shaking hands she found her flashlight in the zipper bag left at the foot of her berth. She opened the curtain and turned the light up and down the aisle. Several who hadn’t been thrown from their berths were climbing out, wanting to know what had happened. Groans, curses and cries only added to the confusion.  Then with the speed of a fireman preparing to answer a call to duty, Nancy put on her clothes. Some sure instinct warned her that in a few minutes there would be no time to think of herself. At last her long legs swung down from the berth. Her flashlight showed some people still lying where they had fallen in the aisle. Some actually climbed over them in their frantic haste to get out of the leaning Pullman.  She turned her light on the nearest injured person. It was a gray-haired lady, moaning that her arm was broken. A big man, clad only in his undershirt and army trousers, emerged from his berth.  “Here, give me a hand,” ordered Nancy. “This lady has a broken arm.”  The soldier, who was of powerful build, braced himself against the berth on the lower side, and lifted the stunned old lady to his shoulder. Nancy held her flashlight so he could see as they made their way toward the exit. She snatched a sheet to use for bandages from one of the berths as she went.  On reaching the platform they found the Pullman was leaning precariously against a clay cut on one side, while the steps on the other were high in air. Flares had already been lighted beside the track, and eager hands reached up to help with the injured woman. Nancy never remembered how she got down herself. Her one idea was to help the little old lady whose wavy gray hair was so like her own mother’s.  “Do you have a pocket knife?” she asked the service man as he was stretching the woman on the ground.  He dug in his trouser pocket and produced one.  “Cut me a splint off some bush or tree,” she ordered. “I’ll have to protect this broken arm till it can be X-rayed and properly set.”  She took off her coat to cushion the gray head. While she waited for the splint she saw that injured people were being brought from the three rear coaches. Just beyond the clay bank which had saved their car from greater damage, she saw that several coaches had overturned and telescoped into a horrible mass of wreckage.  The soldier came back promptly with a good splint from which he was deftly peeling the bark. To Nancy’s surprise he knelt on the ground, and in the light of her flash began to manipulate the broken bone into position. One glance at those skillful fingers and Nancy exclaimed, “Oh, you’re a doctor!”  “Yes,” was all he said as he proceeded to the business of the moment.  “Thank God,” she said earnestly, and began to tear the sheet into bandages.  As she had done numberless times before in the emergency room, Nancy helped bind up the broken arm.  “I see you’ve at least had first aid,” he said as they worked.  “I’m a nurse,” she retorted as tersely as he had informed her he was a doctor.  “There’ll be plenty for us to do tonight,” he told her.  When the arm was set, he lifted the frail woman and carried her out of the cut.  “Wait here with her,” the doctor ordered. “I’ll go back for my bag. She should have a hypo. You can help.”  Someone had placed some boxes for steps at the rear entrance to the coach and he returned that way. They were still hauling people out and stretching them beside the end coach, which by some miracle had not overturned. To Nancy’s surprise she recognized the ANC captain she had noticed on the train yesterday afternoon. She was trying to stop the bleeding in a leg wound of a man next to Nancy’s old lady.  “Please, someone try to find a doctor,” she said to no one in particular.  “One was here just now,” Nancy told her. “He’ll be back in a moment. He went for his bag.”  Nancy bent to help the captain make a tourniquet below the injured man’s knee. She had just secured the knot with a stick when she saw the doctor returning. The ANC captain straightened and saluted.  “This man will have to have some stitches, Major,” she said.  “I’ll look after him.”  To Nancy’s consternation she saw that the soldier she had just been ordering around, had put on his coat. His gold leaf indicated him a major, and the caduceus that he was a member of the medical corps. She felt terribly embarrassed at her mistake.  He seemed to think nothing of it, however, for he explained to the captain, “I’ll keep this young lady to help me. She says she’s a nurse.”  “Then I’ll go look after some of the others,” said the captain, alertly.  Major Reed was stooping to give attention to the injured man, and asked as he did so, “Where did you graduate?”  “Stanford Hospital. I’m Nancy Dale. I just joined the Army Nurse Corps and am on my way for basic training.”  This explanation seemed quite satisfactory to the major. He set his bag on the ground and pulled the zipper. “Give the lady there a hypo. We’ll need one here, too. Tell Captain Lewis to get what she needs from my bag.”  Until the sun rose over the red clay hills Nancy worked beside Major Reed, setting bones, sewing up cuts and giving sedatives to the hysterical. Several automobiles had gathered and focused their headlights upon the scene. Though Nancy had never faced such an emergency, she did not lose her head, nor did her hands shake as she worked to relieve the injured.  Only once did she feel an inward tremor and that was when she thought of how she had ordered Major Reed around. But there was no time to dwell on that in the busy hours before the arrival of nurses, doctors and ambulances from the nearest town.  “Someone to relieve us at last,” said Captain Mary Lewis, who now looked as weary as Nancy felt.  “I phoned the camp for a car to be sent for us,” Major Reed told them. “There’ll be plenty of room for the three of us and our baggage.”  Nancy glanced from one officer to the other in astonishment. “Oh, are we really within driving distance of the camp?”  “Only about fifty miles,” replied Major Reed.  “And you’re both going there?”  Captain Lewis nodded and smiled. “I’ve been on a tour of inspection, and Major Reed has been assigned work there.”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: _“I’m Nancy Dale,” Nancy Told the Major_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  “Then I can get there almost as soon as scheduled,” said Nancy in relief. “I was worrying over being off schedule.”  “Young lady, if you ever had a good excuse for being late you have it this time,” said the major. He looked down at her a moment and smiled whimsically. “I’d say she’s made of good fighting stuff, wouldn’t you, Miss Lewis?”  “I’ll say,” agreed Miss Lewis. “She’s had a fine try-out tonight.”  Nancy’s face flushed, then she burst forth impulsively, “Oh, I hope they’ll think me good enough to send to the South Pacific.”  “That’s something we have to leave to our Uncle Samuel, young lady.”  Nancy was silent a moment, then looked up at the major shyly out of the corner of her eye. “I owe you an apology, sir.”  “How’s that?”  “For ordering you about—demanding that you cut me a splint. But how could I know you were a major?”  He broke into a hearty laugh. “Well, Miss Dale, I can’t see that an officer is due any respect when he goes around in his undershirt. You did what any nurse should have done.”  “That must be your car over there, Major,” said Miss Lewis.  “So ’tis. Let’s get our baggage and be off.”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   CHAPTER TWO                                  HURDLES   At Major Reed’s request a young private brought Nancy’s baggage from the Pullman and packed it in the car. The major gave the local doctor last minute instructions about some of the injured, while Nancy and Captain Mary Lewis waited for him. It was the first five minutes Nancy had had since the accident to think quietly about the catastrophe.  With a sudden inner jolt she recalled the two German-speaking passengers who had sat behind her the previous afternoon. Could there possibly be any connection between their whispered conversation and this tragedy? The demand for her services during these last horrible hours had driven out all other thoughts except the use of her skill in helping the injured.  When the doctor returned to the car and started to get in, Nancy said, “Major Reed, there’s something I believe I should tell you before we leave here.”  He glanced at her, his foot lifted to the step, and said absent-mindedly, “Yes?”  “This may or may not have any connection with the wreck.”  “They’ve already found evidence that it’s the work of saboteurs,” he told her frankly.  Nancy felt the blood drain from her cheeks. What would they think of her not mentioning her suspicions sooner? She had gone too far now to remain silent. Briefly she gave an account of the German conversation behind her the previous afternoon.  “I might have thought little of it,” she hastened to add, on seeing the scowl on the major’s face, “but on boarding the train last night I noticed there were eight troop cars. Instantly I thought of what the two men behind me had said. I also noticed the blond corporal watching the entraining men. He stood at the edge of the crowd outside my coach.”  “You should have reported him as a suspect,” stated Captain Mary Lewis sharply.  Nancy flushed, and asked, “To whom should I have reported him? They would only have laughed at me. Nobody on that train knew who I was.”  “Never take a chance"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47307"],["title","Nancy Dale, Army Nurse (#2)"],["body","it comes to anything like that,” said Major Reed. “Where large numbers of lives are involved it’s excusable to be suspicious of your own brother, rather than take any chances.”  Nancy didn’t flare up in anger or burst into tears, but looked the major squarely in the eyes. “I’m sure you’re right. Had I been at a hospital, or in camp, I would have reported my suspicions to the right authorities. Under the circumstances, sir, what would you have done?”  The major got suddenly into the car and slammed the door. “I would probably have done exactly as you did, young lady.”  Then Nancy did want to cry from sheer relief. Their car crawled off through the traffic congestion at the scene of the accident. The highway ran parallel with the track for some distance. They had an appalling view of the twisted mass of wreckage in the forward part of the train. At a group of official-looking cars, Major Reed had the driver stop. He got out to talk to two men. A few minutes later he brought them over to the car and had Nancy give a description of the two suspects she had noticed on the train.  “You are to be commended, Miss Dale,” said Mr. Nelson, the taller of the two strangers, “for at least giving the suspects a looking over.”  “I had to see what they were like after I heard them whispering in German!” exclaimed Nancy. “But when I saw one was a corporal in the army I thought perhaps I was being too suspicious.”  Mr. Nelson laughed bitterly. “We’ve picked up several spies lately, disguised in soldier’s uniforms. A man isn’t always to be trusted just because he wears our colors.”  “I suppose it would be impossible now to locate the pair,” said Nancy unhappily. “The blond could be anywhere among the thousands back there at the station, or hundreds of miles away by this time.”  The other plainclothes official said, “You underrate our Secret Service, miss. The description you’ve given is elaborate compared with some we get. We’ve sometimes caught ’em on little more than a shoestring.”  He saluted respectfully and their car rolled out to the open country, and across the red clay hills. They were all too tired for conversation, even if they had had the heart for it after such a depressing experience. Captain Lewis did not seem inclined to conversation, and Nancy was glad enough to ride in silence. She snuggled deep into her corner, and was actually asleep before they had left the wreck five miles behind.  Some time later she was startled by a gentle hand shaking her shoulder. “Here we are, my dear,” Miss Lewis was saying. Nancy opened her eyes.  She sat up with a start, wondering if there’d been another wreck. To her amazement she found they had stopped in front of a long, one-story building. Some white-uniformed nurses were coming down the steps. Across the lawn she saw another group in coveralls.  “You mean we are actually there—at camp?” she asked in amazement.  “You slept like a baby all the way,” said Captain Lewis. “That ability to relax at once will stand you in good stead when you get in the thick of things.”  Nancy was pleased. “Mother has always said if anyone would give me a pillow I could go to sleep any time, anywhere.”  “And this time you didn’t even have a pillow.” Then suddenly Captain Lewis assumed her official air. “Lieutenant Hauser will show you to your room and help you get settled. Would you like to join me at breakfast when you get cleaned up?”  “Oh yes, thanks. This brisk morning air has really whipped up my appetite.”  Not until long afterward did Nancy discover what an honor Captain Lewis had bestowed upon her. Too many new and exciting things were happening just then for her to appreciate the full significance of the invitation.  Captain Lewis introduced her to Lieutenant Hauser who was rather short and stocky and had a ready smile. She gave Nancy the comfortable feeling that there was really no difference in their positions, even though Miss Hauser was already a first lieutenant.  “Your roommate is Mabel Larsen,” explained Miss Hauser. “She got in yesterday and already knows enough to show you the ropes.”  They went down a long, narrow hall. A moment later Miss Hauser opened the door of a neat little room with two beds, attractive cretonne drapes and comfortable chairs and floor lamps.  An exclamation of delight escaped Nancy, “Oh, I thought we’d be sleeping on army cots in tents!”  “You’ll get plenty of that later. Better enjoy these comforts while you have them,” Lieutenant Hauser warned her. “Mabel’s out on the obstacle course right now. You’ll have a chance to do some unpacking and clean up before she comes in.”  Miss Hauser pointed out a list of rules tacked on the door, told Nancy where the dining room was and left her to her own devices. An hour later when Nancy came back from a hearty breakfast with Captain Lewis she found Mabel Larsen stretched on her bed.  Mabel merely lifted her head when Nancy came in, and greeted her casually. “Oh, hello! You’re the latest shavetail, I suppose?”  “I’m Nancy Dale, and they tell me you’re Mabel Larsen.”  “Glad you came. Sorry I can’t be very formal just now, but I’m all in—got only fifteen minutes to get my wind back.” She groaned softly. “Gosh, but my legs ache!”  “What’s wrong? Are you ill?”  “Oh, nothing that won’t be worse tomorrow! Just wait till you try those hurdles!” Mabel turned over cautiously and groaned again. “I might’ve been pounded by Japs from the way these shanks feel.”  Nancy laughed in spite of herself. “You must’ve been neglecting your daily dozen before you came here.”  “I’ve never been one of those exercise addicts,” stated Mabel. “I’ve always gotten enough floor work in the wards without this one, two, three business.” Mabel reached for a bottle of rubbing alcohol and began to massage her rather plump legs.  “Wait, let me do it,” said Nancy.  Mabel lay back on the bed and gave herself up to the enjoyment of the soothing touch of Nancy’s hands.  “You oughter been a masseuse,” she sighed. Then after a moment she asked, “Why were you so late? We thought you were coming on that early train.”  “There was a wreck,” said Nancy, reluctant to recall her trying experience.  Mabel sat up suddenly. “You mean the train you were on?”  Nancy nodded and gave her a hasty sketch of what had happened, and their work with the injured.  “Well, if I’m not the daughter of a sloth!” burst forth Mabel. “Here I am letting you give me an alcohol rub when you’ve already been working like a trooper for hours!”  “Oh, I got a bit of sleep coming over in the car, but Miss Lewis suggested that I go to bed again till lunch time. I had breakfast with her just now.”  “Not Captain Mary Lewis?” asked Mabel.  Nancy nodded as she began to take off her clothes.  “Well, aren’t you the lucky bloke!” exclaimed Mabel. “Hobnobbing with the majors and captains on the very day of your arrival.”  “It just happened that way.”  “Think of the chance you had to prove to ’em right off the bat what stuff you’re made of. Some people do have all the luck.”  Nancy didn’t know just what to make of this talkative roommate, but she was too tired to care just then. She found her rumpled pajamas in the zipper bag and got them out. In the meantime Mabel was painfully putting on her uniform to report to class.  “They’ll probably give you a bunch of this gear this afternoon,” Mabel said. “I never had so many new duds all at one time as they issued to me yesterday.”  “Miss Hauser said I’d get my uniforms this afternoon, and be given my schedule, too. After that experience this morning I’m rather glad I don’t have to get down to business till tomorrow.”  Nancy crawled into bed and was thankful to find it very comfortable. She watched her new friend straighten her tie and set her new visor cap at a rakish angle on her reddish curls.  “Boy, do I feel swell in this uniform,” boasted Mabel. “It sure boosts your morale to feel you’re really one of the bunch at last. I’ve been raring to get in for months.”  “So have I,” Nancy told her. “But I only graduated last month.”  “Shake, sister! You’re a gal after my own heart. I just finished, too.” The irrepressible Mabel seized Nancy’s hand that lay on the spread. “I believe we’re gonner hit it off fine.”  “We’ll make a team to whip the Japs,” Nancy said, entering into the spirit of her banter.  “Say, that’s swell! So you want to go down under, too?”  “You bet! My brother’s flying a bomber there.”  “I’ve got a sweety out there, too. Yeah, we’ll make a team—the long and short, the chestnut curls and the strawberry-blond mop, your common sense and my nonsense.”  Then they were both laughing and the ice was completely broken.  Mabel glanced at her watch and bounded toward the door. “Be seeing you later,” she called back.  Nancy felt as though a whirlwind had just passed, and she settled into her pillow with a sigh of relief. She felt certain she was going to like her new roommate. Though most of her remarks were flippant, she showed that there was the right sort of stuff underneath.  After a couple of hours’ sleep and a shower, Nancy felt ready to tackle her new life. She spent the rest of the afternoon being fitted for her clothes. She was surprised to know the old blue uniforms were no longer issued, and that she would wear olive drab for dress.  “They found the Japs wearing blue sometimes in the Pacific area. It proved confusing,” Lieutenant Hauser told her. “White uniforms are not customarily worn, either, by nurses at the front—too easily spotted from the air. All these changes are the result of practical experience.”  When Nancy went out to supper with her new friend, Mabel remarked, “Leisure’s a scarce commodity round here. We put in eight hours of hard work every day, counting all the classes, ward work, drills and stuff. Six days a week, too, sister!”  “I’m used to that,” Nancy told her.  Nancy’s real initiation came the next morning when they were routed out before daylight for half an hour of calisthenics. Mabel stuck close to give her a prod or hint"]]]
