He had felt it himself, and had already seen a good deal of that air-fighting of which the youth spoke, as the ribbons below his wings indicated, for he was the winner of the D.S.O. and also the Military Cross.  \"Thank you, sir,\" and the pilot saluted again, but cast a sidelong glance at Jock, who stood a few paces away, and was already fretting in his soul lest Dastral should be sent away without him.  The major caught the glance and understood, for he turned sharply round after a few steps, and said:--  \"And Jock, what about him?\" smiling blandly at the lads.  \"He is of age, sir, he can speak for himself,\" replied Dastral. \"But I should like him to go overseas with me. We have done most of our training together, and we thoroughly understand each other, and I know that he's just dying to go with me, sir.\"  \"Is that so, Jock?\" asked the major, looking at the Scotch laddie, who had scarcely finished his course at Glasgow University when the war called him from his studies.  \"Oh, yes, sir, I'd give all I possess to go overseas with Dastral.\" And the youth's eyes shone with joy at the very possibility of the event coming off, for he had feared that they were now to be separated.  \"Very well. Don't expect too much, but possess your souls in patience for another fortnight or so. Goodbye!\"  \"Good-bye, sir!\" and once more after the customary salute, the youths went their way, wondering how soon they would be in France, within sound of the guns.  For the next fortnight they were busy every day at the aerodrome, trying new machines, testing, carrying out imaginary reconnaissances over the German lines, bombing raids, studying war maps and plans, night flying and a score of other things that would prove useful when they found themselves in France.  One morning, about two weeks later, a telegram was delivered to Dastral at his rooms. It came from the War Office, and ran as follows:--   \"Second Lieutenant Dastral and his observer to proceed overseas forthwith, on one of the new fighting 'planes, and to report his arrival at -- Squadron, British Expeditionary Force, France.\"   After the customary interview with the C.O., it was arranged that early next morning the two aviators were to make their first attempt at flying the Channel.     CHAPTER II  THE FERRY PILOT   IT was an hour before dawn, and the stars had not yet faded from the skies, when a group of air mechanics at one of the aerodromes just north of London were busy about the ailerons and fuselage of a new machine, which was destined to fly across the Channel that day, and to join one of the British Squadrons on the other side.  The secret of the machine had been well kept, and only a favoured few had been permitted to see the \"hornet,\" as she was called. Great things were claimed for her when she joined one of the active squadrons, now fighting in France for the supremacy of the air.  Just a few folk in Old Blighty had been scared by the advent of the Fokker, the new German aeroplane which had recently come into existence, and for which such wonderful things were being claimed daily by the German \"wireless.\"  \"Double up there, you sleepy imps!\" yelled Old Snorty, the aerodrome sergeant-major, a short, stout, florid, shiver-my-timbers type of disciplinarian. And another squad of sleepy air-mechanics, just out from their blankets, doubled up smartly to give a hand.  In a few minutes the hornet in question was ready for her long flight overseas. Every wire and strut had been carefully examined and proved, for men's lives depended upon the testing, and oiling, and straining. And now the silent, filmy thing was waiting only for the pilot and observer.  A sound of footsteps upon the soft turf of the aerodrome was heard, and voices carried lightly down the soft morning air.  \"Halt! Who goes there?\" called the sentry, standing near by, and at the same instant a hand lamp was flashed in the direction of the newcomers.  The sentry, however, appeared to recognise sonic important personality approaching, like the mastiff who knows, as if by instinct, the approach of his master, for, without waiting for an answer to his challenge, he shouted:--  \"Guard, turn out!\"  And instantly, the men in the guard tent turned out in time to salute the Commanding Officer of the Squadron, who came by with Dastral, the pilot, and Fisker, the observer.  Simultaneously, the air mechanics sprang to attention, as they stood about the hornet. Then, after a couple of minutes spent in chatting with the adventurers, who were about to sail forth on the wings of the morning, the O.C. and the pilot flung away their cigarettes and gave a few apparently casual glances over the framework by the aid of the hand-lamps.  \"Better load up with a few twenty pound bombs, Dastral,\" laughed the O.C. \"You may have the chance of using one going over seas. You never know your luck.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied the youth.  A moment later the pilot and observer were seated in the biplane, snugly wrapped in their thick leather coats, their hands encased in huge gauntlets, and their helmets tightly drawn about their ears, ready for the morning adventure.  Dastral gave a final glance around, his hand already on the controls, then gave a nod to the chief of the ground staff.  \"Swing the propellor!\" came next, followed by \"Stand clear!\"  \"Whiz-z-z!\" went the huge blades, and, as the pilot switched on the current, the engines--powerful 100 horse-power ones, capable of some 1400 or 1500 revolutions a minute--broke into their wonderful song, and with a final word of parting from the Squadron Commander, the machine taxied off rapidly over the level turf.  \"Burr-r-r-r!\"  The air seemed full of a mighty sound, and a terrible vibration filled the heavens. It was the song of the aeroplane.  At a hundred yards, in response to a very slight movement of the joy-stick, the winged creature leapt into the air, then circled around once or twice, climbing rapidly up to a couple of thousand feet, and made off south by south-east.  The first whisper of dawn came out of the east as the hornet headed off towards the great city, for a filmy streak of grey, followed by a saffron tint, appeared in the sky low down on their left hand. The stars overhead began to fade and disappear, as though withdrawn into the vaulted dome overhead. Then the saffron turned to crimson, and soon the eastern horizon was aflame with light, for, as the machine rose higher and higher, the horizon broadened, and the whole earth seemed to lie at her feet.  Now they were over the city, and the pilot laughed joyously, for he was exhilarated by the bracing air which rushed past him at a tremendous rate.  \"Look there, Jock,\" he cried, pointing down far below, where, through the gloom which still enfolded the lower regions, a faint silvery streak showed where the majestic Thames rolled down under its many bridges to the sea.  Jock Fisker, his chum and observer, who was destined to see many an adventure with Dastral in the near future, peered over the side of the fuselage, and noted the river and the many spires of the great city. He saw the thin spire of St. Bride's reaching up towards him, St. Martin's, and St. Clement Danes'; and then, as the upper rim of the sun appeared above the horizon, he saw the blue-grey dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, and caught the flash of the sun upon the golden cross above it.  \"How glorious!\" Dastral ejaculated, half turning his head every now and then for Fisker to hear, as some impulse moved him but half the words were lost, or carried on by the rushing air into infinitude.  Soon, they left the southern outskirts of London far behind, and, as the daylight broadened, they looked upon the Surrey Downs, and the wide heath of the rolling countryside. Village after village they passed, with its red tiled roofs and church spire pointing heavenwards, but onwards, always onwards, they sped towards the white cliffs and the sea.  The slender, filmy thing had found herself this morning, for the R.A.F. engines were working splendidly, doing already nearly fifteen hundred revolutions a minute. Vibrating with an intensity that was perfectly marvellous, considering her fragile build, with every strut, bolt and wire in perfect unison, the hornet sailed majestically along at over eighty miles an hour, as though on a pleasure trip, instead of a life and death errand; for in reality she was bound overseas to join the forces in their fight for freedom's cause.  Now they were in Kent, the garden of England, and far below were the cherry orchards and the hop-fields. With his glasses Jock could now and then pick out a few farm labourers, already trudging along the roads, or working in the fields.  \"There is the railway, Dastral!\" shouted the observer, as he picked up the narrow thread of metals winding along towards Tunbridge.  \"Yes, I see it now,\" replied his comrade, bringing his glasses to bear on the object for which he had been keenly searching for some minutes.  \"Straight road now. Give her a few more points eastward.\"  Dastral altered the controls a little, and, banking slightly, the hornet came round smartly upon her new course, which, for the rest of the journey to the coast, was almost due east.  The continuous roar of the engines and the whir-r-r of the propeller made conversation almost impossible, except for a few short, jerky sentences, uttered in a loud, shrill voice, and accompanied by corresponding gestures.  The world beneath them was waking up now, for the two aviators could see the smoke ascending from the chimneys of a few scattered farmhouses and cottages. The birds, too, were astir, and the larks, mounting up towards the sun, made sweet music which was drowned in the whir-r-r of that strange-looking bird of prey, which sailed serenely above them. Instinct, however, made the songsters shrink and flee away from that hawk-like menace with stretched-out wings, for they evidently feared that it might swoop down upon and destroy them.  \"Dover!\" shouted the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44348"],["title","Dastral of the Flying Corps (#2)"],["body","suddenly, as the Cinque Port came into view.  \"Yes, by Jove! So it is. I hope they won't turn the guns of the fort upon us.\"  \"No fear. They'll have been warned of our coming by now.\"  A minute later, they opened out the sea, the forts, and Shakespeare's Cliff, and within another three minutes they had crossed the boundary of sea and land, and at a tremendous altitude were gliding over the Channel.  \"Nine thousand!\" yelled Dastral, turning his head towards Jock, after casting a brief glance at his indicator.  \"Now let her rip,\" cried the other, for in climbing to get the required height to rush the Channel, the machine had lost speed.  \"Right-o!\" came the answer.  So, in order to get speed quickly, Dastral did a little nose dive of about three hundred feet, then flattened out again, intending to rush the Channel at one hundred and twenty miles an hour, lest they should slip unconsciously into an air-pocket.  As he did so, he noticed a flash of fire followed by a puff of white smoke down at the Castle.  \"A signal!\" shouted Jock, who had noticed the occurrence at the same instant.  \"Yes, they want to speak to us,\" and with a circling sweep the machine came round as Dastral pulled the joy-stick hard over, and swept back again until he hung right over Dover Castle.  \"Can you make it out, old man?\" asked the pilot.  \"Yes, I have it,\" cried Fisker, whose eyes had been glued to a spot on the Castle grounds just at the top of the hill overlooking the naval harbour.  \"What is it? Do they want us to go down?\"  \"No. The Commander of the fort says there are several enemy submarines in the Channel, and requests us to keep a sharp look-out for them as we cross over.\"  \"Cheery-o, Jock! That's good news. I'm going to drop down a bit, then. There's a D.S.O. for you if you spot one. Here goes!\" And with that, Dastral jammed over the controls again, and did a neat nose dive of two thousand feet, looping the loop once or twice just to express his joy, and give vent to his feelings.  Jock had picked up this information from a few white strips of calico, which had been stretched out in a curious fashion within the Castle grounds. To a trained observer like Fisker, it was mere child's play to read a code signal like that.  And now the daring joy-riders, keenly watched by hundreds of eyes far down below, left the shore once again, and the naval harbour with its shipping, and headed for the French coast, watching the surface of the sea as though they would read its secret.  \"East-south-east, Dastral! That's the course till we sight the opposite shore,\" shouted Jock to his comrade, who, he thought, in his excitement and eagerness to spot a submarine lurking in the depths, might miss his way, as many a brave aviator before him had done.  \"Right-o!\" came the answer to this reminder, for the French coast was hid as yet in the morning mist. Then the course was altered slightly once again, in order to make a proper landfall on the other side.  They were flying low now, much lower than the usual regulations permitted, for it is necessary to keep a good altitude in crossing the Channel, not only because of the chance of running into a stray air-pocket, but to enable one to 'plane to safety should anything go wrong with the engines, for only a seaplane can ride the waves like a ship; and this was no seaplane they were riding to-day.  Far down below them they could see the patrol boats hunting for their prey. They could also see the mine-sweepers at work, clearing the fairway from those foul nests of floating mines which the crafty foe had been busy laying with their submarines. Once or twice they thought they could make out some dark-grey object like a mine or sunken vessel beneath the surface of the water.  A string of mine-sweepers were stretched out below them now. They could see them distinctly, could see even the long nets that trailed between them, for the sun was gaining power and the morning mists were rolling away. The grey expanse of water took on another hue, changing from a dull grey to a greenish tint, with patches here and there of deep blue, where the water deepened, or the surface of the mirror reflected a corresponding patch of the azure above.  Keenly now they searched the face of the deep for any dark speck, for, from an aeroplane, it is possible to look far down, often even to the bed of the sea; but as yet they saw nothing, save an occasional piece of wreckage, which had probably detached itself and floated from the treacherous Goodwins, away to the eastward and the northward--those treacherous shoals which hold the remains of so many gallant barques and vessels, from the Roman galley to the modern liner.  They had not long left the mine-sweepers on their port quarter when Jock, through his glasses, noted something like a string of porpoises, which, owing to the motion of the waves, appeared to be travelling along. They seemed so regular and orderly in their movement, however, that he was about to pass them over. Thinking, however, that he would like to call Dastral's attention to them, he shouted:--  \"Starboard bow, Dastral! Look at 'em! What are they? Not mines, surely. Look like porpoises, only they're not dark enough, and they don't tumble about much.\"  Dastral peered over the side of the cockpit and looked down.  \"Can't say,\" he ejaculated.  \"Let's go down a bit lower, old man,\" said Fisker.  \"Aye, aye. Hold tight!\" cried the pilot, for he noticed that Jock was standing up and leaning over, unstrapped.  \"Right away! I'm all right,\" replied the observer, squatting down, and pressing his knees against the knee-board, which is the life-line of the aeroplane.  And down they went in a graceful nose-dive till they were within five hundred feet of the surface of the water, with the engines shut off. Then, as they flattened out, both men peered over the side again, and Dastral was the first to exclaim:--  \"Porpoises be hanged! They're German mines. A whole string of them floating about in the fairway, ready for the first ship that comes along. The dirty Huns!\"  \"Snakes alive! So they are. Now I can make them out quite plainly; I can even see the horns and contacts through my glasses. Phew! There'll be a deuce of a mess shortly unless they're cleared up.\"  \"Look alive, old man, or there'll be trouble!\" shouted the pilot.  \"How so?\"  \"See that ocean tramp coming up Channel. She's a seven thousand tonner, and her cargo's worth a couple of hundred thousand. She'll be right on the string of mines directly, and then--gee whiz!--there'll be fireworks, and another valuable cargo will have gone to Davy Jones' locker.\"  The mine-sweepers were about a couple of miles away by this time, but the Commodore of the little fleet had seen the rapid nose-dive of the hornet, and knew that something unusual was happening.  He had already strung out the signal for a boat to detach its nets and proceed at full steam to the spot, for he thought that the machine was coming down with engine trouble.  It was his duty, therefore, to save the men, and, if possible, salve the aeroplane also. Dastral saw the signal through his glasses, and watched the vessel cast off her nets to come up. His immediate concern, therefore, was for the tramp steamer surging up Channel, and nearing the end of her long voyage from Valparaiso to London. At all costs to the aeroplane, she must be saved from the deadly mines towards which she was now heading directly. The tide was with her, and she was coming up rapidly. In another five minutes she would be in the cunningly laid trap.  For the moment, Dastral continued to circle over the mine bed, hoping thereby to warn off the tramp. Of this she appeared to take no notice, though undoubtedly a score of eyes were watching his gymnastic gyrations from the deck and bridge of the vessel.  \"Try the gun, Jock. Quick!\"  \"Rip-r-r-r-r-r!\" went the Lewis gun, as Jock pressed the button and fired off half a drum of ammunition.  Even yet, the tramp steamer did not seem to understand, for her captain did not charge her course.  \"Is she fitted with wireless?\" yelled Dastral.  \"Yes,\" answered the observer, putting down his glasses into the socket for an instant.  \"Then give her a message on the international code. It's her last chance. She'll be on the infernal things in another two minutes.\"  \"Right-o! Here goes!\" and, uncoiling the long aerial wire, he tapped out just one word on the sending key:--  \"M I N E S!!!\"  \"Good. If that fails, the ship's done for!\" ejaculated Fisker, as he watched eagerly for the ship to change her course.  On came the vessel, quite oblivious of the danger. She was less than a cable's length from the string of mines, and still steaming fast, when Dastral noted some movement about the deck, where a dozen or so of the crew stood just for'ard of the bridge, in the waist, gazing intently at the 'plane.  \"Heavens! It's too late!\" gasped the pilot, as he saw the steamer's bows running dead on towards the very centre of the floating mines.  \"No, she may just do it,\" he ventured to his observer, as he saw the sudden commotion on board.  Suddenly, out of the wireless room, the operator, evidently carrying the message, dashed up the companion way to the bridge, flourishing a piece of paper in his hand, and shouted:--  \"Mines in the vicinity, sir!\"  Then it was that the captain realised the danger he was in, for the mine-sweeper coming up on the starboard bow was also flying the signal for her to heave to.  Dashing to the wheelhouse door, a few paces away from where he had been standing, the captain shouted to the man at the helm,  \"Hard-a-starboard!\"  And though the tide was with her, the good ship swung round smartly, only in the very nick of time, for, as she turned, one of the deadly mines was within two feet of her stern, and the wash from her screw and the rapid movement of her rudder as she came round, caused the nearest mine to come into contact with a piece of wreckage, at which there was a terrific roar,"]]]
