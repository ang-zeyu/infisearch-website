His heart beat thick; which astonished him: hitherto it had never made that sort of movement.  From Cles he despatched a letter to the fair chatelaine at Meran, telling her that by dainty and skilful management of the paces, he was bringing on the intractable heroine of the Fifteenth, and was to be expected in about two or three days.  The letter was entrusted to Wilhelm, who took the borrowed horse back to Trent.  Weisspriess was on the mule-track a mile above the last village ascending to the pass, when he observed the party of prisoners, and climbed up into covert.  As they went by he discerned but one person in female garments; the necessity to crouch for obscurity prevented him from examining them separately.  He counted three men and beheld one of them between gendarmes.  'That must be my villain,' he said.  It was clear that Vittoria had chosen to go forward alone.  The captain praised her spirit, and now pushed ahead with hunter's strides.  He passed an inn, closed and tenantless: behind him lay the Val di Non; in front the darker valley of the Adige: where was the prey?  A storm of rage set in upon him with the fear that he had been befooled.  He lit a cigar, to assume ease of aspect, whatever the circumstances might be, and gain some inward serenity by the outer reflection of it--not altogether without success.  'My lady must be a doughty walker,' he thought; 'at this rate she will be in the Ultenthal before sunset.'  A wooded height ranged on his left as he descended rapidly.  Coming to a roll of grass dotted with grey rock, he climbed it, and mounting one of the boulders, beheld at a distance of half-a-dozen stone-throws downward, the figure of a woman holding her hand cup-shape to a wayside fall of water.  The path by which she was going rounded the height he stood on.  He sprang over the rocks, catching up his clattering steel scabbard; and plunging through tinted leafage and green underwood, steadied his heels on a sloping bank, and came down on the path with stones and earth and brambles, in time to appear as a seated pedestrian when Vittoria turned the bend of the mountain way.  Gracefully withdrawing the cigar from his mouth, and touching his breast with turned-in fingers, he accosted her with a comical operatic effort at her high notes  'Italia!'  She gathered her arms on her bosom and looked swiftly round: then at the apparition of her enemy.  It is but an ironical form of respect that you offer to the prey you have been hotly chasing and have caught.  Weisspriess conceived that he had good reasons for addressing her in the tone best suited to his character: he spoke with a ridiculous mincing suavity:  'My pretty sweet!  are you not tired?  We have not seen one another for days!  Can you have forgotten the enthusiastic Herr Johannes?  You have been in pleasant company, no doubt; but I have been all--all alone. Think of that!  What an exceedingly fortunate chance this is!  I was smoking dolefully, and imagining anything but such a rapture.--No, no, mademoiselle, be mannerly.'  The captain blocked her passage.  'You must not leave me while I am speaking.  A good governess would have taught you that in the nursery.  I am afraid you had an inattentive governess, who did not impress upon you the duty of recognizing friends when you meet them!  Ha!  you were educated in England, I have heard.  Shake hands. It is our custom--I think a better one--to kiss on the right cheek and the left, but we will shake hands.'  'In God's name, sir, let me go on,' Vittoria could just gather voice to utter.  'But,' cried the delighted captain, 'you address me in the tones of a basso profundo!  It is absurd.  Do you suppose that I am to be deceived by your artifice?--rogue that you are!  Don't I know you are a woman? a sweet, an ecstatic, a darling little woman!'  He laughed.  She shivered to hear the solitary echoes.  There was sunlight on the farthest Adige walls, but damp shade already filled the East-facing hollows.  'I beg you very earnestly, to let me go on,' said Vittoria.  'With equal earnestness, I beg you to let me accompany you,' he replied. 'I mean no offence, mademoiselle; but I have sworn that I and no one but I shall conduct you to the Castle of Sonnenberg, where you will meet the Lenkenstein ladies, with whom I have the honour to be acquainted.  You see, you have nothing to fear if you play no foolish pranks, like a kicking filly in the pasture.'  'If it is your pleasure,' she said gravely; but he obtruded the bow of an arm.  She drew back.  Her first blank despair at sight of the trap she had fallen into, was clearing before her natural high courage.  'My little lady! my precious prima donna! do you refuse the most trifling aid from me?  It's because I'm a German.'  'There are many noble gentlemen who are Germans,' said Vittoria.  'It 's because I'm a German; I know it is.  But, don't you see, Germany invades Italy, and keeps hold of her?  Providence decrees it so--ask the priests!  You are a delicious Italian damsel, and you will take the arm of a German.'  Vittoria raised her face.  'Do you mean that I am your prisoner?'  'You did not look braver at La Scala'; the captain bowed to her.  'Ah, I forgot,' said she; 'you saw me there.  If, signore, you will do me the favour to conduct me to the nearest inn, I will sing to you.'  'It is precisely my desire, signorina.  You are not married to that man Guidascarpi, I presume?  No, no: you are merely his .  .  .  friend.  May I have the felicity of hearing you call me your friend?  Why, you tremble! are you afraid of me?'  'To tell the truth, you talk too much to please me,' said Vittoria.  The captain praised her frankness, and he liked it.  The trembling of her frame still fascinated his eyes, but her courage and the absence of all womanly play and cowering about her manner impressed him seriously.  He stood looking at her, biting his moustache, and trying to provoke her to smile.  'Conduct you to the nearest inn; yes,' he said, as if musing.  'To the nearest inn, where you will sing to me; sing to me.  It is not an objectionable scheme.  The inns will not be choice: but the society will be exquisite.  Say first, I am your sworn cavalier?'  'It does not become me to say that,' she replied, feigning a demure sincerity, on the verge of her patience.  'You allow me to say it?'  She gave him a look of fire and passed him; whereat, following her, he clapped hands, and affected to regard the movement as part of an operatic scena.  'It is now time to draw your dagger,' he said.  'You have one, I'm certain.'  'Anything but touch me!' cried Vittoria, turning on him.  'I know that I am safe.  You shall teaze me, if it amuses you.'  'Am I not, now, the object of your detestation?'  'You are near being so.'  'You see!  You put on no disguise; why should I?'  This remark struck her with force.  'My temper is foolish,' she said softly.  'I have always been used to kindness.'  He vowed that she had no comprehension of kindness; otherwise would she continue defiant of him?  She denied that she was defiant: upon which he accused the hand in her bosom of clutching a dagger.  She cast the dagger at his feet.  It was nobly done, and he was not insensible to the courage and inspiration of the act; for it checked a little example of a trial of strength that he had thought of exhibiting to an armed damsel.  'Shall I pick it up for you?' he said.  'You will oblige me,' was her answer; but she could not control a convulsion of her underlip that her defensive instinct told her was best hidden.  'Of course, you know you are safe,' he repeated her previous words, while examining the silver handle of the dagger.  'Safe?  certainly!  Here is C. A.  to V.  .  .  .  A.  neatly engraved: a gift; so that the young gentleman may be sure the young lady will defend herself from lions and tigers and wild boars, if ever she goes through forests and over mountain passes.  I will not obtrude my curiosity, but who is V .  .  .  .  A. ?'  The dagger was Carlo's gift to her; the engraver, by singular misadventure, had put a capital letter for the concluding letter of her name instead of little a; she remembered the blush on Carlo's face when she had drawn his attention to the error, and her own blush when she had guessed its meaning.  'It spells my name,' she said.  'Your assumed name of Vittoria.  And who is C. A.?'  'Those are the initials of Count Carlo Ammiani.'  'Another lover?'  'He is my sole lover.  He is my betrothed.  Oh, good God!' she threw her eyes up to heaven; 'how long am I to endure the torture of this man in my pathway?  Go, sir, or let me go on.  You are intolerable.  It 's the spirit of a tiger.  I have no fear of you.'  'Nay, nay,' said Weisspriess, 'I asked the question because I am under an obligation to run Count Carlo Ammiani through the body, and felt at once that I should regret the necessity.  As to your not fearing me, really, far from wishing to hurt you--'  Vittoria had caught sight of a white face framed in the autumnal forest above her head.  So keen was the glad expression of her face, that Weisspriess looked up.  'Come, Angelo, come to me;' she said confidently.  Weisspriess plucked his sword out, and called to him imperiously to descend.  Beckoned downward by white hand and flashing blade, Angelo steadied his feet and hands among drooping chestnut boughs, and bounded to Vittoria's side.  'Now march on,' Weisspriess waved his sword; 'you are my prisoners.'  'You,' retorted Angelo; 'I know you; you are a man marked out for one of us.  I bid you turn back, if you care for your body's safety.'  'Angelo Guidascarpi, I also know you.  Assassin!  you double murderer! Defy me, and I slay you in the sight of your paramour.'  'Captain Weisspriess, what you have spoken merits death.  I implore of my Maker that I may not have to kill you.'  'Fool! you are unarmed.'  Angelo took his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4439"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 5 (#2)"],["body","in his fist.  'I have warned you, Captain Weisspriess.  Here I stand.  I dare you to advance.'  'You pronounce my name abominably,' said the captain, dropping his sword's point.  'If you think of resisting me, let us have no women looking on.' He waved his left hand at Vittoria.  Angelo urged her to go.  'Step on for our Carlo's sake.'  But it was asking too much of her.  'Can you fight this man?' she asked.  'I can fight him and kill him.'  'I will not step on,' she said.  'Must you fight him?'  'There is no choice.'  Vittoria walked to a distance at once.  Angelo directed the captain's eyes to where, lower in the pass, there was a level plot of meadow.  Weisspriess nodded.  'The odds are in my favour, so you shall choose the ground.'  All three went silently to the meadow.  It was a circle of green on a projecting shoulder of the mountain, bounded by woods that sank toward the now shadowy South-flowing Adige vale, whose Western heights were gathering red colour above a strongly- marked brown line.  Vittoria stood at the border of the wood, leaving the two men to their work.  She knew when speech was useless.  Captain Weisspriess paced behind Angelo until the latter stopped short, saying, 'Here!'  'Wherever you please,' Weisspriess responded.  'The ground is of more importance to you than to me.'  They faced mutually; one felt the point of his stilet, the other the temper of his sword.  'Killing you, Angelo Guidascarpi, is the killing of a dog.  But there are such things as mad dogs.  This is not a duel.  It is a righteous execution, since you force me to it: I shall deserve your thanks for saving you from the hangman.  I think you have heard that I can use my weapon.  There's death on this point for you.  Make your peace with your Maker.'  Weisspriess spoke sternly.  He delayed the lifting of his sword that the bloody soul might pray.  Angelo said, 'You are a good soldier: you are a bad priest.  Come on.'  A nod of magnanimous resignation to the duties of his office was the captain's signal of readiness.  He knew exactly the method of fighting which Angelo must adopt, and he saw that his adversary was supple, and sinewy, and very keen of eye.  But, what can well compensate for even one additional inch of steel?  A superior weapon wielded by a trained wrist in perfect coolness means victory, by every reasonable reckoning.  In the present instance, it meant nothing other than an execution, as he had said.  His contemplation of his own actual share in the performance was nevertheless unpleasant; and it was but half willingly that he straightened out his sword and then doubled his arm.  He lessened the odds in his favour considerably by his too accurate estimation of them. He was also a little unmanned by the thought that a woman was to see him using his advantage; but she stood firm in her distant corner, refusing to be waved out of sight.  Weisspriess had again to assure himself that it was not a duel, but the enforced execution of a criminal who would not surrender, and who was in his way.  Fronting a creature that would vainly assail him, and temporarily escape impalement by bounding and springing, dodging and backing, now here now there, like a dangling bob-cherry, his military gorge rose with a sickness of disgust.  He had to remember as vividly as he could realize it, that this man's life was forfeited, and that the slaughter of him was a worthy service to Countess Anna; also, that there were present reasons for desiring to be quit of him.  He gave Angelo two thrusts, and bled him.  The skill which warded off the more vicious one aroused his admiration.  'Pardon my blundering,' he said; 'I have never engaged a saltimbanque before.'  They recommenced.  Weisspriess began to weigh the sagacity of his opponent's choice of open ground, where he could lengthen the discourse of steel by retreating and retreating, and swinging easily to right or to left.  In the narrow track the sword would have transfixed him after a single feint.  He was amused.  Much of the cat was in his combative nature.  An idea of disabling or dismembering Angelo, and forwarding him to Meran, caused him to trifle further with the edge of the blade. Angelo took a cut, and turned it on his arm; free of the deadly point, he rushed in and delivered a stab; but Weisspriess saved his breast.  Quick, they resumed their former positions.  'I am really so unused to this game!' said Weisspriess, apologetically.  He was pale: his unsteady breathing, and a deflection of his dripping sword-wrist, belied his coolness.  Angelo plunged full on him, dropped, and again reached his right arm; they hung, getting blood for blood, with blazing interpenetrating eyes; a ghastly work of dark hands at half lock thrusting, and savage eyes reading the fiery pages of the book of hell. At last the Austrian got loose from the lock and hurled him off.  'That bout was hotter,' he remarked; and kept his sword-point out on the whole length of the arm: he would have scorned another for so miserable a form either of attack or defence.  Vittoria beheld Angelo circling round the point, which met him everywhere; like the minute hand of a clock about to sound his hour, she thought.  He let fall both his arms, as if beaten, which brought on the attack: by sheer evasion he got away from the sword's lunge, and essayed a second trial of the bite of steel at close quarters; but the Austrian backed and kept him to the point, darting short alluring thrusts, thinking to tempt him on, or to wind him, and then to have him.  Weisspriess was chilled by a more curious revulsion from this sort of engagement than he at first experienced.  He had become nervously incapable of those proper niceties of sword-play which, without any indecent hacking or maiming, should have stretched Angelo, neatly slain, on the mat of green, before he had a chance.  Even now the sight of the man was distressing to an honourable duellist.  Angelo was scored with blood-marks.  Feeling that he dared not offer another chance to a fellow so desperately close-dealing, Weisspriess thrust fiercely, but delayed his fatal stroke.  Angelo stooped and pulled up a handful of grass and soft earth in his left hand.  'We have been longer about it than I expected,' said Weisspriess.  Angelo tightened his fingers about the stringy grasstuft; he stood like a dreamer, leaning over to the sword; suddenly he sprang on it, received the point right in his side, sprang on it again, and seized it in his hand, and tossed it up, and threw it square out in time to burst within guard and strike his stilet below the Austrian's collar-bone.  The blade took a glut of blood, as when the wolf tears quick at dripping flesh.  It was at a moment when Weisspriess was courteously bantering him with the question whether he was ready, meaning that the affirmative should open the gates of death to him.  The stilet struck thrice.  Weisspriess tottered, and hung his jaw like a man at a spectre: amazement was on his features.  'Remember Broncini and young Branciani!'  Angelo spoke no other words throughout the combat.  Weisspriess threw himself forward on a feeble lunge of his sword, and let the point sink in the ground, as a palsied cripple supports his frame, swayed, and called to Angelo to come on, and try another stroke, another --one more!  He fell in a lump: his look of amazement was surmounted by a strong frown.  His enemy was hanging above him panting out of wide nostrils, like a hunter's horse above the long-tongued quarry, when Vittoria came to them.  She reached her strength to the wounded man to turn his face to heaven.  He moaned, 'Finish me'; and, as he lay with his back to earth, 'Good- evening to the old army!'  A vision of leaping tumbrils, and long marching columns about to deploy, passed before his eyelids: he thought he had fallen on the battle-field, and heard a drum beat furiously in the back of his head; and on streamed the cavalry, wonderfully caught away to such a distance that the figures were all diminutive, and the regimental colours swam in smoke, and the enemy danced a plume here and there out of the sea, while his mother and a forgotten Viennese girl gazed at him with exactly the same unfamiliar countenance, and refused to hear that they were unintelligible in the roaring of guns and floods and hurrahs, and the thumping of the tremendous big drum behind his head--'somewhere in the middle of the earth': he tried to explain the locality of that terrible drumming noise to them, and Vittoria conceived him to be delirious; but he knew that he was sensible; he knew her and Angelo and the mountain-pass, and that he had a cigar-case in his pocket worked in embroidery of crimson, blue, and gold, by the hands of Countess Anna.  He said distinctly that he desired the cigar-case to be delivered to Countess Anna at the Castle of Sonnenberg, and rejoiced on being assured that his wish was comprehended and should be fulfilled; but the marvel was, that his mother should still refuse to give him wine, and suppose him to be a boy: and when he was so thirsty and dry-lipped that though Mina was bending over him, just fresh from Mariazell, he had not the heart to kiss her or lift an arm to her!-- His horse was off with him-whither?--He was going down with a company of infantry in the Gulf of Venice: cards were in his hands, visible, though he could not feel them, and as the vessel settled for the black plunge, the cards flushed all honours, and his mother shook her head at him: he sank, and heard Mina sighing all the length of the water to the bottom, which grated and gave him two horrid shocks of pain: and he cried for a doctor, and admitted that his horse had managed to throw him; but wine was the cure, brandy was the cure, or water, water!  Water was sprinkled on his forehead and put to his lips.  He thanked Vittoria by name, and imagined himself that General, serving under old Wurmser, of whom the tale is told that being shot and lying"]]]
