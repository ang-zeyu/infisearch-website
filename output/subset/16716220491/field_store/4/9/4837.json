Brigham Young was born at Whitingham, Windham County, Vermont, June 1, 1801. A short sketch of the family of this noted adventurer may not be uninteresting. The following extract is from his autobiography:--       \"My grandfather, John Young, was a physician and surgeon in      the French and Indian war.       \"My father, John Young, was born March 7, 1763, in Hopkinton,      Middlesex County, Massachusetts. He was very circumspect,      exemplary and religious, and was, from an early period of his      life, a member of the Methodist Church. At the age of sixteen      he enlisted in the American Revolutionary War, and served      under General Washington; he was in three campaigns in his own      native State, and in New Jersey. In the year 1785 he married      Nabby Howe, daughter of Phineas and Susannah, whose maiden      name was Goddard.       \"In January, 1801, he moved from Hopkinton to Whitingham,      Windham County, Vermont, where he remained for three years,      opening new farms.       \"He moved from Vermont to Sherburn, Chenango County, New York,      in 1804, where he followed farming, enduring many hardships      and privations, incidental to new settlements.       \"My father's family consisted of five sons and six daughters,      viz.:--       \"Nancy, born in Hopkinton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts,      August 6, 1786.       \"Fanny, born in the same place, November 8, 1787.       \"Rhoda, born in Platauva District, New York, September 10,      1789.       \"John, born in Hopkinton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, May      22, 1791.       \"Nabby, born in same place, April 23, 1793.       \"Susannah, born in same place, June 7, 1795.       \"Joseph, born in the same place, April 7, 1797.       \"Phineas Howe, born in same place, February 16, 1799.       \"Brigham, born in Whitingham, Windham County, Vermont, June 1,      1801.       \"Louisa, born in Sherburn, Chenango County, New York,      September 25, 1804.       \"Lorenzo Dow, born in same place, October 19, 1807.\"  It is worthy of remark, that all of Brigham's family became Mormons. His father, John Young, was constituted first patriarch of the church, and died at Quincy, Illinois, October 12, 1839. His brothers are all at Salt Lake, and are the devoted followers and satellites of the Prophet.  Through the plurality system, the Youngs have formed connections so numerous, that almost half the people at Salt Lake are in some way related to the ruling dynasty. This is striking evidence of Brigham's ingenuity in consolidating and perpetuating his power.  His early life was that of a farmer's son, but he afterwards acquired the trade of a painter and glazier, which he followed until his conversion to Mormonism. In 1832, being then thirty-one years of age, he heard and embraced this new religion. He was convinced by Samuel H. Smith, brother to the prophet Joseph, and was baptized by Eleazer Miller, now living at Salt Lake.  Brigham \"gathered\" with the saints, at Kirtland, Ohio, and soon became intimate with Joseph Smith. He was ordained an elder, and began preaching. His shrewdness, and almost intuitive knowledge of character, soon attracted the attention of his brethren, and gave him influence and position in this weak and despised church. They recognized in him a man born to rule and lead the masses. They were attracted by his strong, electrical will; and from that time his power in the church has been undisputed.  In 1835, on the 14th of February, at Kirtland, Brigham Young was ordained one of the newly-organized quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Armed with his new power, and fired with a zeal worthy of a better cause, he went forth, and preached and proselyted with marked success.  Thomas B. Marsh having apostatized, Brigham was chosen to succeed him, as President of the Twelve Apostles, in 1836.  Then came the dark days of Mormonism. Many of the prominent men of the church apostatized. The saints were driven from Kirtland. Smith fled to save his life; Brigham accompanied him, and after many hair-breadth escapes, many trials and hardships, they again planted a new colony, and settled in Far West, Missouri.  But the saints were destined again to endure persecution for their faith. In a few years they were driven from Missouri, seeking a home this time in Illinois. During all this time Brigham stood firm, counselling and directing his brethren, and, like the rock amid the storms, gathering fresh power of resistance as the waves of persecution increased in fury.  In 1839 he was appointed, with others, to \"open up the gospel\" to the inhabitants of the British Isles. They landed at Liverpool on the 6th of April, 1840, and immediately commenced preaching. Brigham superintended affairs, issued an edition of the \"Book of Mormon,\" and commenced the publication of the \"Millennial Star,\" a periodical still living. In 1841 he sailed for New York, having shipped seven hundred and sixty-nine of the faithful, and leaving many churches, with organizations completed.  Brigham was cordially received by Smith, and the saints generally, who appreciated and acknowledged his services, and it was evident that his influence and fame were rapidly increasing.  In 1844 the whole aspect of affairs was changed. Smith was shot, Nauvoo threatened by a mob, and the Twelve Apostles scattered. Sidney Rigdon assumed the Presidency, he being Smith's first counsellor. Divisions were numerous, and the church was in imminent danger of falling into hopeless ruin.  Brigham, with true Napoleonic foresight, saw his opportunity, and was not slow to improve it. He came hurriedly to Nauvoo, denounced Rigdon as an impostor and his revelations as emanations from the Devil, cut off both him and his adherents from the true church, cursed Rigdon, and \"handed him over to the buffetings of Satan for a thousand years,\" and was himself elected President by an overwhelming majority.  This exhibition of energy silenced all opposition. Those who did not love, feared him; and all suffered themselves to be led, because they dared not resist, a man so determined to rule.  Thus much accomplished, and visions of future power and aggrandizement, perchance of temporal sovereignty, floated through the brain of this modern Mohammed. He dreamed of the kingly robe and the jewelled crown in some far-off valley of the Rocky Mountains, where gentiles or their laws could not annoy the saints, or hinder the normal development of Mormonism. How and in what manner these dreams came so near fulfilment, will be seen as the reader peruses these pages.  But he did not lose sight of the present in these glowing visions of the future. He completed the Temple, the Mansion-House was in a forward state, Nauvoo was increasing rapidly, and with it his power and popularity.  Brigham, however, with his usual foresight, saw the storm arising. The saints were again to be driven. So he hurried the people through their endowments, bound them to him by oaths which made them shudder to recall, and still, by an art equal to that of Loyola, so inwound himself in their affections that they loved and reverenced him the more. He aroused their deepest hatred toward the \"gentiles;\" wrought upon their pride, ambition, and revenge, until they were ready to do and dare anything for their religion and their leader. When his power was thus fully established, he revealed to them \"the will of the Lord concerning them.\" They must leave their beautiful Nauvoo, their sacred temple, their altars and their homes, and follow him as the Moses of the new dispensation, and he would find for them a Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey, where the gentiles should never come. This was a trial of their faith. Should they yield to the temptation, and, hankering after the flesh-pots of Egypt, lose their birthright? They wept, they hesitated, but the strong will and iron nerve of Brigham conquered, and they obeyed.  In February, 1846, they crossed the Mississippi on the ice, and leaving home, property, and kindred, they took up their line of march for the land of the setting sun. As the long trains rolled by, Brigham comforted, counselled, and blessed the weeping emigrants. He told them of the land where they should"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44414"],["title","The Mormon Prophet and His Harem (#2)"],["body"," \"under their own vine and fig-tree, with none to molest or make them afraid.\" Alas for their fainting hearts! Little did they suspect that the cruel ambition of their God-man would lead them to a land as barren as the Desert of Sahara, and as devoid of vegetation as the Rock of Gibraltar.  They established themselves in winter-quarters at Kanesville, now Council Bluffs, Iowa. Here new difficulties arose. The church was poor, and means were needed to supply the current necessities, as well as to defray the expense of the journey to their new Zion. Various schemes were resorted to for the purpose of \"raising the wind.\" A band of Danites was sent out to steal cattle and horses, and convey them beyond the jurisdiction of the State authorities. Others were detailed to make and circulate counterfeit money. While these little speculations were progressing, Brigham was trying his hand at diplomacy. He is reported to have sent James C. Little to Washington, to request the privilege of raising a battalion of Mormons for the Mexican war.  This movement was prompted by several considerations. First, it was thought necessary for the safety of the church that they should make a show of patriotism; secondly, these soldiers would draw pay from the government, which Brigham could appropriate; and thirdly, they were to be discharged in Mexico, where, at that time, he designed to found his theocratic monarchy. It has been asserted by some persons that Brigham received $20,000 from the government, as a bonus, for raising the battalion; but I find no evidence to substantiate this assertion. The following affidavit will show in what manner he was benefited by this transaction:--       \"TERRITORY OF UTAH,    }        GREAT SALT LAKE CITY.}       \"Alexander McCord says that he was mustered into the U. S.      service in the Mormon Battalion, August 16th, 1846. That an      advance of $42.50 was issued by the government per man,      ostensibly for the purpose of clothing the command, making a      total to the battalion of $22,500. That this amount was      received by Parley P. Pratt, and forwarded by him to Brigham      Young, who proffered to apply the same for the benefit of the      families of the battalion, who were in a state of destitution.      That he, Brigham, informed them he would send to St Louis,      purchase goods, and deal them out for the benefit of said      families at wholesale prices. Also made a covenant with them,      calling upon God and angels to witness the same. That he would      transport their families to them in Mexico, now California,      even if he had to leave his own family behind; also would      provide houses for them. That in his public address to the      battalion, in relation to this subject, he strongly urged the      advantages that would accrue to his church by their compliance      with this requisition, making it entirely a matter of      self-interest, with the sole view of accomplishing certain      private ends; and not in anywise appealing to their loyalty,      or setting forth the necessity of rendering assistance to the      parent government.       \"That he did not fulfil the promises he had made. Some few      articles were served out to their families at enormous      rates,--his (McCord's) wife having to take sole-leather, for      which she had no use. That when their wives appealed to him,      expecting in good faith to receive according to promise, he      laughed, mimicked, and made fun of them on the public stand;      showing how they cried and whined. On the arrival of the money      at Council Bluffs, some of the women, being entirely      destitute, desired their husbands' share, and some cried for      the want of it. Young ridiculed them, and told them if they      insisted upon having the money, they must not look to him for      support or protection; thus compelling them to accept of his      terms.       \"Two agents, John D. Lee and Major Egan, followed the      battalion to Santa Fe, and there received a draft on      Leavenworth, for the first month and a half's pay, with the      understanding from the soldiers it was to be paid to their      families. The authorities of the church drew the amount, and      then took out the tithing for themselves, one tenth.       \"One of the inducements held out by the government, was to      discharge them, with their arms in Mexico, which was done.      When he (McCord) arrived in Utah, October, 1847, he found his      family not here, and was prevented by the church authorities      from going after them; and was not permitted to leave until      January following. When he reached his family at Winter      Quarters, Missouri, he found no preparations made for their      being forwarded to Utah, and there were none made afterwards.       (Signed,) ALEXANDER MCCORD.       \"_Territory of Utah, ss._       \"Alexander McCord, being duly sworn, says that the facts set      forth in the foregoing statement by him subscribed, of his own      knowledge, are true, and those set forth upon information and      belief he verily believes to be true.       (Signed,) ALEXANDER MCCORD.\"       \"Subscribed and sworn to before me, this 4th day of May, 1864.       \"THOMAS J. DRAKE,       \"_Associate Justice U. S. Sup. Court, Utah_.\"  By this operation, Brigham must have realized the neat little sum of $10,000. This enabled him to fit out an expedition to explore the country west of the Rocky Mountains. Accordingly, in the spring of 1847, with one hundred and forty-three of his tried adherents, he made the journey to Salt Lake, where they arrived July 24, 1847. A colony was at once established, and a part of the number left to commence farming operations. Brigham, with the remainder, returned to \"Winter Quarters.\" Here he found the people on the point of starvation, while fevers and the cholera were rapidly thinning their ranks. Brigham at once commenced alleviating their suffering, and in the excess of their gratitude, these poor deluded creatures did not see that he was the cause of all their misery.  Young was now ready to enact another scene in this Mormon drama. He was ruling the church in the capacity of President of the Twelve Apostles. He desired greater power; he wished to occupy the place of the Prophet of the Lord. This was the more difficult, as the people venerated the memory of Joseph Smith, sanctified as it was by the remembrance of his cruel and untimely death. Brigham knew well the extent of this feeling, and that it would be impossible to supplant Joseph in their affections, and extremely difficult to occupy his position. But his plans demanded that he should be in form what he was in fact,--the absolute head of the church. He resolved to execute a brilliant _coup d'état_, and risk the consequences.  On the morning of the 24th of December, 1847, he ascended the pulpit to preach; and with that power of mimicry and imitation for which he is so remarkable, aided, doubtless, by works of art to enable him to represent the features and _personnel_ of Smith, he so completely assumed the tone and manner, and presented the appearance of Joseph, that the congregation believed that their dead prophet stood before them. The effect was electrical. Women screamed and fainted; strong men wept; the delusion was complete. \"_The mantle of Joseph had fallen upon Brigham_;\" he was henceforth their Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, the rightful successor to the Presidency. One old brother told me that he really believed that Joseph was present in the flesh, so strong was the personal resemblance at the time. As soon as the tumult subsided, the people elected Brigham \"President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in all the world.\" He appointed Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards as his counsellors. These three constituted the \"First Presidency.\" This action was subsequently confirmed, at a conference held April 6, 1848, at the same place. Brigham was now the nominal as well as the real leader of this strange community.  A greater trial demanded his forethought. The whole church was to be removed over a thousand miles, through an almost unknown country, full of dangers and difficulties.  The following account of the manner in which this difficult undertaking was executed, is from the pen of John Hyde, Jr.:--       \"Some ability is required to efficiently remove bodies of      armed troops over such new and pioneering obstacles: well      supplied, equipped, and mounted, it takes a commander's skill;      but here were poor, unprovided, feeble men, women, and      children, shaking with ague, pale with suffering, hollow and      gaunt with recent hunger. Without strife, without discord,      almost without a murmur, this heterogeneous mass moved off.      Many groaned with anguish, but none with complaint. Brigham's      energy inspired them all; his genius controlled them all.      Marking their road with their gravestones, they arrived at      Salt Lake Valley, destitute and feeble, in 1848. The desert to      which they had come was as cheerless as their past history.      From cruel foes they had fled to as unfeeling a wilderness.      Renewed difficulties demanded a renewed effort from Brigham.      Everything depended on him. Starvation and nakedness stared in      the gloomy faces of the desponding people. Murmurs and      complaints were uttered. He quelled everything; scolded,      plead, threatened, prophesied, and subdued them. With a      restless but resistless energy he set them to work, and worked      himself as their example. He directed their labors,      controlled their domestic affairs, preached at them, to them,      for them. He told foolish anecdotes to make them laugh,      encouraged their dancing to make them merry, got up theatrical      performances to distract their minds, and made them work hard,      certain of rendering them contented by-and-by.
