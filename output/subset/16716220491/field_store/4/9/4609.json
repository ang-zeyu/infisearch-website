And, Pills, has your supply of bromide run out?\"  The combatants separated and began taking stock of the damage.  \"You logged a gale of wind last night, I hope, Sefton?\" asked the engineer-lieutenant in tones of mock anxiety.  \"Must account for this smash-up, you know----  Any luck?  Have they got it?\"  The acting-sub, now that conversation had reverted to the inevitable \"it\", was bound to admit that the preceding night’s labours had been fruitless.  The possibilities of the recovery of the much-desired \"it\" monopolized the attention of the occupants of the ward-room until the steward, outwardly stolidly indifferent to the unsympathetic treatment of his labours, provided another repast.  They were boyish and high-spirited officers on H.M.T.B.D. _Calder_. Their pranks were but an antidote to the ceaseless strain of days and nights of watch and ward.  \"To get back to things mundane,\" persisted the engineer-lieutenant as the trio sat down to their belated meal, \"will they find it?\"  \"It is my firm belief that they will,\" replied Sefton decisively.  \"Even if we have to mark time about here for another month.\"  \"Heaven forbid!\" ejaculated the surgeon piously, \"I pine for fresh water.  Your vile condenser-brewed fluid is simply appalling, my festive Box-spanner. And I yearn for newspapers less than a week old.\"  The engineer-lieutenant glared defiance at his medical confrère.  He knew perfectly well that the water on board was brackish and insipid, but it was condensed under his personal supervision.  Any disparaging remarks upon his _métier_--even if uttered in jest--touched him to the quick.  A resumption of the \"scrap\" seemed imminent, when a bluejacket, tapping at the ward-room door, announced: \"Captain’s compliments, sir; they’ve just hooked it.\"     CHAPTER II--The Recovered Cable   Instantly there was a wild scramble on the part of the three officers to gain the deck, all other topics of interest vanishing before the all-important information.  A cable’s length on the port beam the _Carse o’ Gowrie_ was backing gently astern in order to close with her consort.  The _Dimpled Lassie_ was pitching sluggishly.  Way had been taken off her, while over her squat counter the wire hawser attached to the Lucas grapnel was \"straight up and down\" under the steady strain of some heavy and still submerged object.  From the destroyer’s bridge a signalman was semaphoring rapidly by means of hand-flags.  The _Dimpled Lassie_ replied.  The man had just finished delivering the message to Lieutenant-Commander Crosthwaite when Sefton and the other officers gained the bridge.  \"There’s no doubt about it now,\" declared Crosthwaite breezily. \"They’ve just reported that the thing is two fathoms off the bottom. The _Carse o’ Gowrie_ is going to help take the strain.\"  \"Hope it won’t carry away, sir,\" remarked Sefton.  \"Never fear!  Where the patent grapnel grips, it holds.  What water have we?\"  A cast with the lead gave 19 fathoms, the tide having risen 7 feet.  The tidal current was setting south-east a half east, with a velocity of 1-½ knots.  \"Tide’ll be slacking in half an hour,\" said the skipper.  \"The less strain we get the better. Signalman!\"  \"Sir?\"  \"Ask the _Dimpled Lassie_ to report the state of the dynometer.\"  Promptly came the reply that already the strain on the grapnel hawser was 2-½ tons.  \"And the breaking strain is four, sir,\" Sefton reminded his chief.  \"We’ll get it all right,\" reiterated Crosthwaite. \"Never fear.\"  His optimism was justified when forty-five minutes later the grapnel sullenly bobbed above the surface, holding in its tightly-closed jaws the bight of a large submarine electric cable.  \"Let’s hope we’ve hooked the right one,\" muttered the engineer-lieutenant.  \"You atom of despondency!\" exclaimed Stirling.  \"I state a possibility, not a probability, Pills,\" rejoined Boxspanner. \"It’s a three-to-one chance, you know.\"  Already a number of artificers, who had been temporarily detailed for duty on board each of the trawlers, were hard at work in connection with the retrieved cable.  What they were doing in connection must remain a matter of conjecture, but the fact was patent that the success or otherwise of unremitting toil depended upon the next few minutes.  Impatiently the young lieutenant-commander of the _Calder_ awaited a further signal announcing the result of the investigations.  When it came it was highly satisfactory.  \"Thanks be for small mercies!\" ejaculated Crosthwaite fervently. \"Signal M’Kie and tell him to take due precautions in case a ground swell sets in from the east’ard.\"  The cable was one of three that in pre-war time connected the little Norfolk fishing-village of Bacton with the German island of Borkum.  Two more ran from Borkum to Lowestoft, the whole system being partly British and partly German controlled.  Immediately upon the declaration of war the telegraph cables had been severed, both in the neighbourhood of the British coast and in the vicinity of the German island fortress.  To all intents and purposes it seemed as if the cables were nothing more than useless cores of copper encased in gutta-percha, rotting in the ooze on the bed of the North Sea.  Yet in spite of the most stringent precautions on the part of the British Government to prevent a leakage of news, the disconcerting fact remained that, thanks to an efficient and extensive espionage system, information, especially relating to the movements of the Grand Fleet, did reach Germany.  Various illicit means of communication were suspected by the authorities, and drastic, though none the less highly necessary, regulations were put into force that had the effect of reducing the leakage to a minimum.  Simultaneously a campaign was opened against the use of wireless installations.  Undoubtedly wireless played its part in the spies’ work, but its efficacy was doubtful.  It could be \"tapped\"; its source of agency could be located.  However beneficial in times of peace, it was a two-edged weapon in war.  For a long time the British Government failed to unravel the secret, until it was suggested that the submarine cables had been repaired.  And this was precisely what had been done.  The Huns had promptly repaired their end of one of the Bacton-Borkum lines, while a German trawler, disguised as a Dutch fishing-boat, had grappled the severed end just beyond the British three-mile limit.  To the recovered end was fixed a light india-rubber-covered cable.  This would be sufficiently strong to outlast the duration of the war, the scarcity of gutta-percha and the enormous weight of the finished cable being prohibitive.  It was paid out from the trawler with considerable rapidity, the end being buoyed and dropped overboard some miles from the spot where the original cable used to land.  In the inky blackness of a dark winter’s night a boat manned by German agents disguised as British fishermen succeeded in recovering the light cable and taking it ashore. Here it was a brief and simple matter to carry the line to a cottage on the edge of the low cliff, burying the land portion in the sand.  For nearly eighteen months the secret wireless station had been in active operation.  News culled from all the naval bases by trustworthy German agents was surreptitiously communicated to the operators in the little unsuspected Norfolk cottage and thence telegraphed to Borkum.  For the task of recovering the cable the utmost skill, caution, and discretion were necessary.  The vessels detailed for the work were sent from a far-off Scottish port with orders to make no communication with the shore; while to protect them from possible interference the _Calder_ had been detached from the rest of the flotilla to stand by and direct operations.  The _Dimpled Lassie_ was indeed fortunate in finding the cable in a comparatively short space of time, and, what was more to the point, in locating the right one of the three known to be in close proximity. Contrast this performance with that of the cruiser _Huascar_ in the Chilean-Peruvian War. That vessel tried for two days in shallow water to sever the cable at Valparaiso.  The officer in charge had himself assisted to lay that particular cable, but picked up the one communicating with Iquique and severed that by mistake.  The only \"fly in the ointment\", as far as Lieutenant-Commander Crosthwaite was concerned, was the anticipated fact that the _Calder_ would have to dance attendance upon the trawlers for an indefinite period.  Once the mild excitement of grappling for the cable was over, the _Calder_ was in the position of those who \"serve who only stand and wait\". It was a necessary task to \"stand by\", but with vague rumours in the air of naval activity on the part of the Huns, the officers and crew of the destroyer would infinitely have preferred to be in the thick of it, rather than detained within a few miles of the Norfolk and Suffolk coast.  When at length interest in the proceeding had somewhat abated, Sub-lieutenant Sefton went below to make up long arrears of sleep.  He had not turned in many minutes when Doctor Stirling gave him a resounding whack on the back.  \"Wake up, you lazy bounder!\" exclaimed the surgeon.  \"Didn’t you hear ’Action Stations’? We’ve got the whole German fleet coming for us.\"     CHAPTER III--The Stranded Submarine   \"No such luck,\" protested Sefton, until, reading the serious look in the medical officer’s eyes, and now conscious of a commotion on deck as the ship’s company went to action stations, he started up, leapt from his bunk, and hurriedly scrambled into his clothes.  Upon gaining the deck Sefton found that Stirling had exaggerated the facts--he generally did, as a matter of fact.  Just looming through the light haze were half a dozen large grey forms emitting tell-tale columns of smoke; for, combined with the lack of Welsh steam coal and inferior stoking, the Huns generally managed to betray their whereabouts by "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39489"],["title","With Beatty off Jutland: A Romance of the Great Sea Fight (#2)"],["body","of black vapour from their funnels.  The ships were now steaming in double column, line ahead, and, having left Smith’s Knoll well on the starboard hand, were running on a southerly course to clear Winterton Ridge.  \"Off to Yarmouth, I’ll swear,\" declared Crosthwaite.  \"The bounders have got wind of the fact that our battle-cruisers are well up north.\"  The _Calder_ was now approaching the two trawlers.  Grasping a megaphone, the lieutenant-commander hailed the skipper of the _Carse o’ Gowrie_.  \"German battle-cruisers in sight,\" he shouted. \"You had better slip and clear out.\"  The tough old Scot shaded his eyes with a hairy, tanned hand and looked in the direction of the hostile craft.  \"I’ll bide here, if ye have nae objection, sir,\" he replied.  \"After all this fuss, fetchin’ the cable an’ all, I’m nae keen on dropping it agen. Maybe they’ll tak no notice of us, thinking we’re fisherfolk.\"  \"The probability is that they’ll sink you,\" said Crosthwaite, secretly gratified at the old man’s bravery, and yet unwilling to have to leave the trawlers to their fate.  \"If they do, they do,\" replied the skipper unmoved.  \"It wouldna be the first by many a one. But sin’ we hae the cable, here we bide.\"  Old Peter M’Kie was of a similar opinion.  Sink or swim, he meant to stand by.  The _Carse o’ Gowrie_ and the _Dimpled Lassie_ were to remain with the fished cable, since it was just possible that the Germans might take them for ordinary trawlers, as the boats showed no guns.  The lieutenant-commander of the destroyer saw that it was of no use to attempt to shake the resolution of the two skippers.  After all, they stood a chance.  By remaining quietly, and riding to the raised cable, they certainly had the appearance of fishing boats using their trawl, while any attempts at flight might result in unpleasant attentions from the number of torpedo-boats accompanying the German battle-cruisers.  Accordingly the _Calder_ slipped quietly away, keeping under the lee of the Haisborough Sands to avoid being spotted by the enemy vessels.  It was a genuine case of discretion being the better part of valour. Although not a man of her crew would have blenched had orders been given to steam full speed ahead towards the huge German battle-cruisers, Crosthwaite realized that such a step would be utterly useless.  Long before the destroyer could get within torpedo-range of the foe, she would be swept clean and sent to the bottom under the concentrated fire of fifty or more quick-firers.  Had it been night or thick weather the _Calder_ would no doubt have attempted to get home with her 21-inch torpedoes.  The risk would be worth running.  But, as matters now stood, it would be sheer suicidal madness on her part, without the faintest chance of accomplishing anything to justify the attempt.  Meanwhile the destroyer was sending out wireless messages reporting the presence of the raiders. Busy in exchanging wireless signals with their far-flung line of covering torpedo-boats, and with a couple of Zeppelins that flew high overhead, the German vessels made no attempt to \"jam\" the _Calder’s_ aerial warning.  Constantly ready for action at very brief notice, the British battle-squadrons were under weigh within a few minutes of the receipt of the _Calder’s_ message, and Beatty’s Cat Squadron was heading south-east with all possible speed before the first hostile gun thundered against Great Yarmouth.  \"They’ve opened the one-sided ball,\" remarked Sefton as a dull boom from the now invisible German ships--a single report that was quickly taken up by other heavy weapons--was borne to the ears of the _Calder’s_ crew. \"And, by Jove, Whit-Monday too.\"  \"Yes,\" assented the doctor.  \"And ten to one the beach is crowded with holiday-makers.  Before we left port, didn’t we see some idiotic report in the papers stating that the East Coast would be ready for holiday visitors ’as usual’?\"  \"Let’s hope the Huns will get cut off again,\" said the sub.  \"Another _Blücher_ or two will make them sit up.\"  \"They’re too wary,\" replied the somewhat pessimistic medico.  \"They’ve been warned that the coast is clear.  Before the submarines from Harwich can come up they’ll be off.  And with twelve hours of daylight in front of them they’ll be back long before our sixth destroyer flotilla can make a night attack.\"  For nearly twenty minutes the officers and men listened in silence to the furious bombardment. Several of the latter had homes in the town that now lay exposed to the enemy guns.  Realizing their helplessness, they could only hope that the damage done was no greater than that of the previous naval attack on the same place, and that this time the Cat Squadron would intercept the raiders and exact a just and terrible retribution.  At length the firing ceased almost as suddenly as it had begun.  In vain the destroyer’s crew waited long and anxiously for the renewal of the cannonade in the offing that would announce the gratifying news that Beatty had once more intercepted the returning Huns.  At 20 knots the _Calder_ returned towards the position in which she had left the two trawlers. With feelings of relief it was seen that both craft were still afloat and apparently all well.  Suddenly one of the look-outs raised the shout of: \"Submarine on the starboard bow, sir!\"  Without a moment’s hesitation Crosthwaite telegraphed for full speed, at the same time ordering the quartermaster to port helm.  A mile and a half away could be discerned the elongated conning-tower and partly housed twin periscopes of a large submarine, although why in broad daylight the unterseeboot--for such she undoubtedly was--exposed her conning-tower above the surface was at first sight perplexing.  With the for’ard 4-inch quick-firer loaded and trained upon the meagre target the _Calder_ leapt forward at a good 24 knots, ready at the first sign of the submerging of the submarine to send a projectile crashing into and pulverizing the thin steel plating of her conning-tower.  So intent was the lieutenant-commander upon his intended prey that he had failed to notice the proximity of a black-and-white can buoy now almost on the starboard bow.  It was not until Sefton reminded him of the fact that he realized that the destroyer was doing her level best to pile herself upon the Haisborough Sands--a feat that the German submarine had already accomplished to the rage and mortification of her officers and crew.  Listing violently outwards, the destroyer swung round clear of the treacherous shoal, and for the first time Crosthwaite was aware of the ignominious predicament of the unterseeboot.  \"The beggar may have a broadside torpedo-tube,\" he remarked to his subordinate as he ordered the _Calder_ to be swung round, bows on to the stranded craft, speed having been reduced to give the destroyer more steerage-way.  \"Give her a round with the for’ard gun.  Plank a shell a hundred yards astern.\"  The shot had the desired effect.  The conning-tower hatch was thrown open, and the head and shoulders of a petty officer appeared.  For a few moments he hesitated, looking thoroughly scared, then his hands were extended above his head.  In this position of surrender he remained, until, finding that the destroyer made no further attempt to shell the submarine, he emerged from the conning-tower.  Two officers followed, and then the rest of the crew--twenty-two all told.  The officers stood upon the steel grating surrounding the conning-tower, for the tide had now fallen sufficiently to allow the platform to show above water.  The rest of the crew, wading knee-deep, formed up in a sorry line upon the after part of the still submerged hull, and, with uplifted hands, awaited the pleasure of their captors.  \"Fetch ’em off, Mr. Sefton,\" ordered the lieutenant-commander.  \"Half of ’em at a time.\"  The sub hastened to order away the boat.  As he did so Dr. Stirling nudged him and whispered in his ear:  \"Shall I lend you a saw, old man?\"  \"A saw!\" repeated Sefton in astonishment. \"What on earth for?\"  \"Skipper said you were to bring half of them at a time,\" explained the irresponsible medico with a grin.  \"Better try the top half of each man first trip.\"  \"That’ll do, Pills,\" retorted the sub.  \"If it’s surgery you’re after, you had better do your own dirty work.\"  \"Give way, lads,\" ordered the sub as the boat drew clear of the steel wall-side of the destroyer.  \"We surrender make,\" declared the kapitan of the submarine as the boat ranged up alongside. \"We haf a leak sprung.\"  [Illustration: \"WE SURRENDER MAKE....  WE HAF A LEAK SPRUNG\"]]  \"Sorry to hear it,\" rejoined Sefton.  \"Is dat so?\" enquired the perplexed German, mystified at his foe’s solicitude.  \"Yes,\" soliloquized the sub.  \"We would much rather have collared the strafed submarine intact. We didn’t bargain for her keel plates being stove in.  \"Now then!\" he exclaimed.  \"I’ll take eleven of you men first trip.\"  The coxwain and bowman of the boat deftly engaged their boat-hooks in convenient projections of the submarine’s conning-tower, while the specified number of dejected and apprehensive Huns was received on board.  Having delivered the first batch of prisoners on the destroyer, Sefton returned, but, instead of immediately running alongside the prize, he ordered his men to lie on their oars.  With the boat drifting at a distance of twenty yards from the unterseeboot, the sub coolly awaited developments.  The Huns--officers and men alike--were far from cool.  Gesticulating wildly, they implored the sub to take them off.  Never before had Sefton seen a greater anxiety on the part of the Germans to abandon their ship, and in the course of eleven months’ service in the North Sea his knowledge of the ways of the wily Hun was fairly extensive.  At length two of the submarine’s crew, unable to restrain their panic, leapt overboard and struck out for the boat.  \"Stand by with a stretcher, there, Jenkins,\" ordered Sefton.  \"Show them what we mean to do."]]]
