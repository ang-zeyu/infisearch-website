Then, sneeringly: \"Your idea was——\"  \"To leave everything to my wife.\"  The War Lord slapped his knees hard, as he always does when excited.  \"So would Herr Müller and Herr Schulze,\" he cried, without attempting to conceal the insult. \"Her Ladyship—chief of the Krupp works—of what use would the Baroness Marguerite be to _my_ interests?\"  Mrs. Frederick Krupp was _née_ von Ende, and the War Lord, always eager to use titles of nobility, chose to call her by her maiden name and style.  Frederick Krupp, who, despite his irregularities, was genuinely fond of his wife, moved uneasily on his low chair.  \"Your Majesty is pleased——\"  \"To have his head screwed on tightly and in the right place,\" declared the War Lord, bringing his fist down on a table at his elbow and making the Chinese ivories jump.  \"Now then, without further palaver, I don’t choose to see the Baroness heiress of the Krupp works.  She shall not control my interests, do you hear? nor those of the Fatherland.\"  The War Lord talked as if addressing a parcel of raw recruits.  His withered left hand had pulled from the trouser-pocket, and was making spasmodic attempts to clutch the lapel of his coat. He has the curious taste to give this poor hand a liberal coating of rings, and his enormous emeralds seemed to gleam more poisonously than usual upon the cringing form of poor Frederick.  \"Willy,\" gasped the Ironmaster pleadingly.  The War Lord was not to be cajoled.  \"As I said, her Ladyship gets a pension. Leave her as big a share of your fortune as you please,\" he added on second thought.  \"Yes, the larger the better; it will avert suspicion—I mean forestall criticism, of course.\"  \"But,\" remonstrated Frederick, in a weak way, \"Marguerite and I have an understanding.\"  \"Understanding,\" scowled the War Lord, brutality written all over him as if he were rehearsing his pretty phrase: \"Those opposing me I smash.\"  He contemplated Frederick for a while as a big mastiff might a King Charles before mangling and killing it.  At last he remembered there are two ways in most things.  \"Of course,\" he began rather soothingly, \"understandings among subjects are null and void when opposed to the Imperial will.  Explain to Lady Marguerite with my compliments, if you please,\" the last phrase emphasised three times by hand cutting the air vertically.  Frederick Krupp, thoroughly cowed by this time, nodded assent.  This man, used to bull-dozing Governments the world over, a terror before his board of directors, and a demigod to his workmen, felt a mere atom with the eyes of the War Lord flashing wrath and contempt upon his yielding self.  \"I will; but what may be your Majesty’s precise commands?\" he stammered meekly.  The War Lord perceived that his victim had become like wax under the lash of his tongue.  He could afford, then, to be magnanimous.  \"You forget etiquette,\" he replied, with a half-smile; \"since when is it customary to question a majesty? Still, I am no Eulenburg\" (referring to the Grand Marshal of the palace), \"and will overlook your _faux-pas_ this time.  Listen, Frederick.\"  He softened his speech with a \"dear Frederick,\" and then issued his mandate: \"The Baroness eliminated——\"  Herr Krupp raised his eyes supplicatingly, but the War Lord paid no attention.  \"Eliminated,\" he repeated, accentuating each syllable. Then, in pitying style: \"Too bad you haven’t got a son. However, the Salic Law does not apply to commoners.\"  The Ironmaster made bold to show annoyance at the word.  \"Commoner by my own free will,\" he protested.  \"Haven’t I declined Earldoms and Dukedoms even?\"  \"More’s the pity that you remain plain Krupp, like a grocer or the ashman, when you might be Prince of Essen,\" cried the War Lord, jumping up.  The Ironmaster rose as well.  Courtly usage, of course, but also a measure of precaution.  He meant to be on hand in case his august guest suffered a fall, and there is always a possibility of that when the War Lord labours under excitement, for his whole left side, from ear to toe, is weak and liable to collapse if the full weight of the body is thrust suddenly upon it.  As a rule, the War Lord remembers, but when carried away by passion, or for other reasons loses control of himself, he is prone to forget or even fall in a heap with no warning.  Such a _contretemps_ happened once at Count Dohna’s, when Frederick was one of the house party, and long remained in his memory.  Visiting at Proeckelwitz in the summer of 1891, the War Lord had deigned to be pleased with a pair of blacks.  \"Buy two more of them for a four-in-hand, as befits the Sovereign,\" he said to his host.  The hint, dropped with charming German delicacy, was a command, of course, and a year later, in June, the War Lord started for the castle in right royal style; but he did not get far that way, since the four-in-hand shied and bolted when the villagers burst into patriotic song, to the waving of a thousand and one flags.  As an eye-witness put it: The leaders rose on their hind legs, the cross pieces came loose and began knocking against their pasterns, and off they were at a furious rate.  Count Dohna let the reins of the runaways slip, and hung the more heavily on to those of the shaft horses, who were trying to follow the others.  He let the blacks run for a while but without losing control, and as they were about to plunge into a bed of harrows he succeeded in checking them.  Then, for a mile or so, he gave them a run on freshly ploughed ground. After that they went steadily.  The War Lord had put his arm around his host’s shoulders when the horses started off, and, the danger past, pressed the Count’s hand, but did not say a word.  Then came the collapse.  He had to be helped down from his seat, and took no notice of the greetings of the ladies awaiting him. Leaning upon his chasseur and Adjutant Von Moltke (now Field Marshal), he crept to his room, his face pale as death and lips compressed.  Dinner was set back an hour, but the War Lord had not recovered his speech when, with difficulties, he put his feet under the mahogany. His body physician, Doctor Leuthold, was sitting opposite the august person, and upon a sign from the medical man the War Lord rose from table after vainly trying to swallow a spoonful of soup. Nor did he come down to breakfast, but attended luncheon, still looking pale and haggard.  Then, for the first time, he greeted the ladies of the house, and spoke a few words to his host; but when a forward young miss referred to the accident he bade her keep silent by an imperious gesture, while a tremor seemed to run through his body. He would not hear of hunting, and left next day without having fired a shot.  Frederick Krupp, remembering Proeckelwitz, moved as near to his Imperial guest as politeness permitted, ready to catch him in his arms if need be, but the War Lord no sooner perceived his intention than he became more infuriated than ever. \"For Heaven’s sake no heroics, Frederick!\" he roared, sitting down again.  \"Draw up a stool and listen.\"  \"One second,\" pleaded the Ironmaster, \"I will set the miniature orchestrella going.\"  He pressed a button, and almost simultaneously a music-box near the door, sheathed in tortoise-shell and gold bronze, began trilling out melodies, so as to confuse, if not obscure, conversation to possible listeners if it waxed overloud again.  The War Lord nodded.  \"Not half bad.  You may send me one of those things to put in Bülow’s office.  There are always some Italians lurking about—to report to Madame la Princesse, I fancy—and put the W.I.R. on the box.  \"Well, let’s get back to things,\" he added, quickly changing his tone to drill-ground clangour. \"Madame eliminated and there being no son——\"  \"Your Majesty desires me to leave the business jointly to Bertha and Barbara?\" asked Krupp.  \"Are there six crown princes or one?\" inquired the War Lord in his turn, with affected calmness.  \"I don’t follow,\" said Herr Krupp.  The War Lord could hardly master his impatience. Still more raising his voice, he demanded abruptly: \"Is Prussia to be divided into six petty Kingdoms when I die because I happen to have six sons, and a small principality besides for my daughter?\"  Herr Krupp opened his eyes wide: \"Your Majesty wants me to disinherit one of my children?\"  \"I want you to proclaim my godchild Bertha Crown Princess of the Kingdom of Cannon.\"  \"But my other daughter——\"  \"Bertha is _my_ goddaughter!\" (with the emphasis on the \"my\").  \"Can I ever forget the honour conferred upon my humble house?\"  \"I trust not,\" said the War Lord, who is careful not to let people forget any small favours he may bestow.  His brain works in fits and starts, in bounds and leaps, and when he wants a thing it jumps at once to the conclusion that his fancy is a _fait accompli_.  Persuading Frederick had been easy with its bits of browbeating and flashes of cajolery. Now, flushed with the triumph gained, he launched forth the details.  \"Bertha, Crown Princess, trust me to find the right consort for her.\"  \"She is only a child.\"  \"The very age when she ought to be taken in hand and moulded.\"  The War Lord illustrated the intended process by kneading the air with grasping fingers, his \"terrible right\" alternately pushing and squeezing, attacking, relaxing and coaxing, with the father looking on, terror-stricken.  Such, then, was to be the fate of his little girl: a vice round her white neck, spurs to her sides. The man before him came into the world accoutred to ride, and seventy millions of people his cattle!  The jewels on the War Lord’s ring-laden hand flashed and threatened. That twenty-carat ruby on his little finger meant blood, and the emerald, linked to it, might denote the poison-tongue eager to corrupt the childish mind into an instrument of high politics.  Diamonds stand for innocence. There were diamonds galore.  Oh,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44979"],["title","The Secret Memoirs of Bertha Krupp (#2)"],["body"," the farce of it! Opals, too, a rare collection, but the stone sacred to October tells at least an honest tale—tears.  The War Lord stripped off a gold hoop with a large turquoise.  \"Wear it in remembrance of this hour, dear Frederick,\" he said.  \"The turquoise signifies prosperity, you know.\"  He walked towards one of the windows and, standing within its deep embrasure, pointed to the towering chimneys.  \"_My_ brave guardsmen,\" he exulted, half to himself, \"outposts of my Imperial will, avant-guard of my seven millions of warriors; it will be great fun, old fellows, to make you dance as I whistle!\"  Then, with a broad smile to Frederick: \"That being settled, the Minister of Justice shall draw up your testament at once.  I brought him to Essen for that.  Now, don’t look frightened, boy.  ’Last will’ does not mean ’last legs.’  You will outlive us all, I bet.  Let’s think of a Prince Consort now.\"  \"But, as said, Bertha is much too young,\" faltered Frederick.  \"Herr,\" staccatoed the War Lord, \"I already had the honour to inform you that Bertha is my godchild—m-y g-o-d-c-h-i-l-d.  Do you hear?\" he yelled, while startled Frederick looked anxiously towards the door.  The War Lord took the hint and resumed conversational tone.  \"Come now,\" he ordered, \"roll call.  Some of our dear friends are still in the marriage mart.\"  (Reflectively): \"Too bad; Fritzie got married.\" Bertha’s father shuddered at the mentioning of a certain Count, who, though brother-in-law of a reigning Grand Duke, was prisoner Number 5429 at Siegen jail, in Rhineland, a few years later for crimes unspeakable. In 1902, however, the dashing Colonel of Horse had not yet been publicly disgraced, and the War Lord launched into a panegyric of his friend. \"Yes, indeed, Fritz would have made a first-class master here.  Not overburdened with brains, but knows enough to obey orders.  No humming and hawing for him when the War Lord has spoken. But the Suien girl caught him.  The kind of son-in-law you want, Frederick.\"  Krupp shook his head.  \"I respectfully beg to differ; none of these for my little girl.\"  \"_These?_\"  The War Lord again raised his voice, but dropped into a hoarse whisper when he heard the officer _de jour_ address the sentinels in the corridor.  \"One can’t say a word without being overheard,\" he grumbled; \"nearer, Frederick, still closer.\"  As he continued speaking he laid his massive right hand on Frederick’s knee and hissed between his teeth: \"These?  You forgot that you were referring to _my_ friends.\"  \"I did not, most assuredly I did not,\" returned the Ironmaster, disengaging himself by a swift movement and jumping up.  \"You dare!\" hissed the War Lord, again losing control of himself.  \"I dare anything for my child!\" cried Krupp, his face livid with rage; \"and I tell you to your face none of your free-living friends for my Bertha!\"  \"Insolence!\" roared the War Lord.  \"Take a care that I don’t send you to Spandau.\"  \"I would endure Schlusselburg rather than suffer my child to marry one of _these_,\" insisted the Ironmaster doggedly.  The War Lord gazed at the speaker for twenty or more seconds, then said in a tone of command: \"You can go.  Send in Moltke\" (referring to his adjutant, later chief of the general staff).  With the latter he remained closeted a quarter of an hour—quite a long space of time for a person of the War Lord’s character—and it is said that he tried to persuade the blond giant (Moltke was blond and blooming then) that Krupp was a madman, as crazy as the Mad Hatter.  Otherwise he would never have dared oppose his plebeian will against that of the supreme master.  Of course not!  Of Moltke’s counter-arguments we know naught, but the War Lord’s visit to Essen wound up with a grand banquet of sixty covers, and in the course of it host and Imperial guest toasted each other in honeyed words.                       *      *      *      *      *  Less than two months later Frederick Krupp died by his own hand, and Bertha Krupp—sixteen, homely and already prone to embonpoint—mounted the throne of the Cannon Kings, as the War Lord had willed.  And, as he had insisted, she became automatically a pawn in his hand, his _alter ego_ for destruction and misery.  Ever since his intimacy with Frederick, the War Lord had looked upon the Krupp plant as the power house for the realisation of his ambition—the conquest of the world; and to a very considerable extent Frederick had aided and abetted his plans by employing his genius for invention and business to commercialise war, and making it fit in with the general scheme of high finance.  \"Want a loan?\" the Cannon King used to ask governments.  \"May we fix it for you?  But first contract for so many quick-firing guns.\"  The loan being amply secured, and the quick-firers paid for, then the suggestion would come along: \"Have some more Bleichroder or Meyer funds on top of our latest devices in man-killers.\"  And so on, and so on; an endless chain.  Yet, while so eager to provide death with new-fangled tools wholesale, Frederick could not, or would not, divest himself from the shackles of business honesty—and his inheritance.  He wouldn’t play tricks on customers.  The steel and work he put into guns for, say, Russia or Chili were as flawless and expert as in the guns bought by his Prussian Majesty.  And that was the \"besetting sin of Frederick,\" the damning spot on the escutcheon of their friendship, as the War Lord viewed it.  It followed, of course, that when one hundred of the Tsar’s Krupp guns faced one hundred Krupp guns of the Government of Berlin, they would be an even match so far as material went—a thing and condition in strict contradiction to the Potsdam maxim: \"Always attack with superior force.\"  How often the War Lord had argued with Frederick: Soft lining for enemy howitzers; a well-concealed, patched-up flaw in the barrel of quick-firers.  \"I know no enemy, only customers,\" was Frederick’s invariable rejoinder, garbed in politest language.  Customers!  Decidedly the War Lord wanted customers—plenty of them, since, as we know, he had invested largely in Krupp stock; but to take customers’ money was one thing, and to provide them with means for spoiling the War Lord’s game was another.  When that pistol-shot startled Villa Huegel on November 22nd did it portend the death-knell of what the War Lord called \"Krupp molly-coddledom\"?  Even during Frederick Krupp’s lifetime—just as if his early demise had been a foregone conclusion—technical experts of the Berlin War Office had been instructed to make extensive experiments with steel on the lines ordered by Wilhelm the War Lord.  The test would be the Day!                                   *CHAPTER II*                   *WEAVING THE TOILS ROUND BERTHA KRUPP*       \"Your Play Days are Over\"—The Baroness Speaks Out—In the Grip of     the Kaiser—A Room Apart   \"The makings of the true German heifer,\" that astute Frenchman, Hippolyte Taine, would have said of the young girl who was busy in her garden behind Villa Huegel on the 24th of November, 1902.  For her blooming youth was full of the promise of maternity—broad shoulders, budding figure, generous hands and feet, plenty of room for brains in a good-sized head.  Pretty?  An Englishman or American would hardly have accorded her that pleasing descriptive title, but comely and wholesome she was, with her air of intelligence and kindly eyes.  An abominable German custom makes scarecrows out of children at a parent’s death.  So Bertha Krupp was garbed in severest black, awkwardly put together.  Her very petticoats, visible when she bent over her flowers, were of sable crepe; not a bit of white or lace, though it would have been a relief, seeing that the young woman’s complexion was not of the best.  \"Bertha—Uncle Majesty——\" cried a child’s voice from outside the house, \"wants you,\" it added, coming nearer.  \"To say good-bye?\" called Bertha in return. One might have discerned an accent of relief in the tone of her voice.  \"Not yet,\" replied her sister, running up, as she tugged at Bertha’s watering-can.  \"Adjutant von Moltke said something about a con-con——\"  \"Conference, I suppose,\" completed the older girl.  \"Will you never learn to speak, child?\"  \"Uncle Majesty uses such big words,\" pleaded little Barbara.  \"Hurry, sister, he is waiting, and you know how crazy he gets——\"  \"But what have _I_ got to do with him?  Let him speak to Mamma.  Tell them I am busy with my flowers.\"  \"Bertha!\" cried a high-pitched voice from the direction of the villa.  \"Mamma,\" whispered the younger girl; \"hurry up, now, or you will catch it.\"  At the same moment one of the library windows in Villa Huegel opened, disclosing the figure of the War Lord, accoutred as for battle—gold lace, silver scarf, many-coloured ribbons, metal buttons and numerals.  His well padded chest heaved under dozens of medals and decorations, his moustachios vied with sky-scrapers.  With his bejewelled right hand he beckoned imperiously.  \"My child, my goddaughter,\" he said with terrible emphasis when Bertha entered the room, breathing hard, \"once and for all you must understand that your play-days are over; at this moment you enter upon the service of the State.\"  He turned abruptly to Bertha’s mother, adding in tones of command: \"You will put her into long dresses at once, Baroness.  It isn’t fitting that the heiress of the Krupp works shows her legs like a peasant girl.\"  \"But I don’t want to wear long dresses, Uncle Majesty,\" pouted Bertha.  The War Lord took no notice of the childish protest, but looked inquiringly at Bertha’s mother.  \"Surely in matters of dress, at least, the child’s wishes should be consulted,\" said the Baroness half defiantly.  \"But I insist,\" fumed the War Lord.  \"And I respectfully submit that your Majesty must not meddle with matters of toilette in my house.\"  The War Lord pulled a high-backed, eagle-crowned chair of silver-gilt up to the late Cannon King’s desk and pushed Bertha into it.
