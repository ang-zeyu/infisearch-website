So after much consultation, it was arranged that when Mr. Nickerson returned, Lydia should go with him.  They started out in the last of February, and traveled by sleigh. The usual route to Canada, was down to Buffalo, across the Niagra river, then on up the lake shore. Mr. Nickerson's home was situated about the middle on the Canada side of the lake some distance from the shore, and he thought that by crossing the lake on the ice, he would save a hundred miles travel. They stopped at a hotel about twenty five miles above Buffalo on the Lake Erie shore, and although told that no one had ventured to ride over that winter, he was determined to go across. So one bright sunny morning they started. Fifteen of the twenty miles were traversed in speed and safety, when lo! they were stopped by a fissure in the ice about two feet wide, and stretching up and down as far as the eye could see. The ice was, of course, thin on the edges. But out, and over the chasm jumped the venturesome young man, and after stamping around and trying the temper of the frozen floor, he decided it would be all plain sailing when once across. This determined, he made a spring for the side where Lydia sat in the sleigh. One, two, three, over he goes,--but oh, horrible! the ice gives way and down he goes into the dark, silent waters beneath. Instinctively he threw one arm out, and resting it on the shelf of ice above him, succeeded in gradually drawing himself up on the ice. Nothing could turn him from his purpose, however, and accordingly he unhitched the horse, made him jump across, pushed the sleigh, with the trembling girl seated in it, after the horse, jumped over once more himself, and was soon under way again. Save that his clothes were frozen on him, neither Mr. Nickerson nor his companion felt any bad effects from their adventure. Reaching a hotel, they soon warmed and rested. From there to Mount Pleasant, which was his home, no incident occurred worthy of note.  Arriving at the house, Mrs. Nickerson met the travelers with a hearty welcome, and in the kind, thoughtful attention of this worthy couple, the sore heart of the patient girl was soothed and rested. The complete change of the mode of living, scenery and people had its effect upon her, and she grew more resigned day by day to her broken life.  The people who lived in the thriving little village were hospitable and kind. They were mostly Methodists. A man by the name of McIntyre, who was a class leader, induced Lydia to take a Sunday school class, and she was much interested in her labors in this direction.  The Spring and Summer came and passed away and Fall came. Few strangers visited the little village and life passed quietly on.  One day in October, 1833, a wagon load of people stopped at the door, and great was the surprise of all, when the party proved to be old Mr., and Mrs. Nickerson and the youngest son, Levi, who, of course, was Freeman's brother. They had with them two strange men. But we will let another chapter tell who and what they were.    CHAPTER III.  Although so remote from the States, rumors of a new prophet and a \"golden bible\" had reached Mount Pleasant, and had been wondered over and commented upon.  Freeman had been told that his parents had joined the new Church, and he was rather disgusted with the information.  It will be necessary to say here that the old gentleman was indeed full of the gospel he had embraced, and was so anxious for the eternal welfare of his sons in Canada, that he had hitched up his carriage, gone on a visit to Kirtland and prevailed upon the Prophet Joseph Smith and Elder Sidney Rigdon to accompany him on a visit to his sons, Moses and Freeman, in Mount Pleasant.  These two brethren were the strangers who were with the aged parents.  \"Well father,\" said Freeman when told who they were, \"I will welcome them for your sake, but I would just about as soon you had brought a nest of vipers and turned them loose upon us.\"  Moses and Freeman were wealthy merchants and men of influence in Mount Pleasant. On the evening of the arrival, after the bustle of welcome and a warm supper were over, everyone was too tired to talk, so all retired to rest. Next morning many were the curious glances that Lydia cast at this strange man who dared to call himself a prophet.  She saw a tall, well-built form, with the carriage of an Apollo, brown hair, handsome blue eyes, which seemed to dive down to the innermost thoughts with their sharp, penetrating gaze, a striking countenance, and with manners at once majestic yet gentle, dignified yet exceedingly pleasant.  Elder Rigdon was a middle-aged man of medium hight, stout and quite good-looking, but without the noble grandeur that was so distinguishing a mark of the prophet.  The day was spent by the travelers in examining a fine new store which had just been erected by the Nickerson brothers, and in looking around the premises as also in walking through the village itself.  The Elders were very wise. They said nothing about their views or doctrines, but waited patiently until some one should express an interest.  As evening drew near Mr. Nickerson became anxious to hear something of the newcomer's faith.  \"Oh,\" said he, \"just let him talk; I'll silence him if he undertakes to talk about the Bible. I guess I know as much about the scriptures as he does.\"  This was to his wife whom he directed to place the family Bible on the table in the parlor.  As soon as supper was over, he invited his visitors and family to go up stairs to the parlor, where he said they would have some talk. All, accordingly, repaired to the large well-furnished room, and then Mr. N. said to the Prophet:  \"Now, Mr. Smith, I wish you and Mr. Rigdon to speak freely. Say what you wish and tell us what you believe. We will listen.\"  Turning to his wife, he whispered, \"now you'll see how I shall shut him up.\"  The Prophet commenced by relating the scenes of his early life. He told how the angel visited him, of his finding the plates, the translation of them, and gave a short account of the matter contained in the Book of Mormon.  As the speaker continued his wonderful narrative, Lydia, who was listening and watching him intently, saw his face become white and a shining glow seemed to beam from every feature.  As his story progressed he would often allude to passages of scripture. Then Mr. N. would speak up and endeavor to confound him. But the attempt was soon acknowledged even by himself to be futile.  The Prophet bore a faithful testimony that the Priesthood was again restored to the earth, and that God and His Son had conferred upon him the keys of the Aaronic and Melchisedek Priesthoods. He stated that the last dispensation had come, and the words of Jesus were now in force--\"Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.\"  Elder Rigdon spoke after the Prophet ceased. He related some of his early experiences, and told those present that he had received a testimony for himself of the truth of what Joseph had said, and then exhorted all present to take the advice of the ancient Apostle James, and ask God, and the testimony would be given to each one; for God is the same now as He was anciently, and has communicated His only gospel to men. \"God,\" said Elder Rigdon, \"is no respecter of persons, but will give to all that ask of Him a knowledge of the things Joseph Smith has declared unto you whether they are true or false, of God or of man.\"  You may be sure that by this time Mr. N. was quite willing to sit and listen, saying but little to interrupt or confound.  After both men were through speaking, many questions were asked by all present for information. The listeners were honest-hearted people, and when truth is told to such, they are constrained to accept and believe.  \"And is this then,\" said Mr. N., \"the curious religion the newspapers tell so much about? Why if what you have just said is not good sound sense, then I don't know what sense is.\"  A feeling of agreeable disappointment was felt by Mr. N. and family that these strange men were so different to the various representations of them.  Seldom have any petitions been sent up to heaven more fervent and earnest than were those of the inhabitants of Mr. N.'s home that night.  Next day notice was sent out that there would be public preaching in the Nickerson Bros', new store-house. A large and attentive audience was present.  Elder Sidney Rigdon spoke to the people with great clearness on the first principles of the gospel, and closed with a strong testimony to the truth of so-called \"Mormonism.\"  The Prophet then arose and poured forth a golden stream of words, many of which were verily pearls without price. Setting forth the restoration of the gospel and the great work that had commenced on the earth. With power he exhorted every one who was present to seek for the truth of his and his companion's words from the source of all light, all truth, all religion, and a knowledge of the truth of the same should surely follow.  Great was the excitement among the peaceful dwellers in Mount Pleasant.  The next day Mr. N. and wife, his father and mother, accompanied by the two strangers, went a distance of ten miles to visit some particular friends and tell them of these wonderful things they had heard and by this time fully believed.  Returning the following day, religious services were again held in the Nikerson store-house.  A large and attentive audience listened to all that was said, and at the close of the meeting several persons came forward and requested baptism.  The day following a meeting was again held, and after it was over the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46602"],["title","Lydia Knight's History (#2)"],["body","baptized twelve persons, among whom was Lydia Bailey, Mr. N. and all of his household. She who was always so sober and full of reflection had received the glad message with trembling joy. She was filled with a bright, peaceful influence and was full of gratitude that God had spared her to hear and accept His glorious gospel. How often we wish and even pray for that which would be our greatest misfortune! The lonely girl had thought of death and its rest with a longing heart, but now, why here was life, life eternal! Life filled to the utmost with good works, joy, and happiness. No matter what should come now, she should know it was all for the best. That is one of the greatest charms of our holy religion. Whatever is, is always for the best if we are only true and pure.  So into the water goes Lydia with a light step and happy heart. She was so filled with the Holy Ghost while standing in the water after she was baptized that she was constrained to cry aloud,  \"Glory to God in the highest! Thanks be to His holy name that I have lived to see this day and be a partaker of this great blessing.\"  In the evening, the new members of the Church assembled in Mr. N.'s house for confirmation. God bestowed His Spirit very freely and the Prophet gave much valuable instruction.  Two more persons came to the Prophet and requested baptism at the meeting the next day. It was attended to and a branch of the Church was organized. Freeman Nickerson was ordained as the presiding Elder.  The evening of this day (which was the seventh day, the Prophet had been there, and came on Monday, October 24, 1833), the family were all seated around the wide, old-fashioned fire-place in the parlor listening to the Prophet's words and full of rejoicing.  \"I would be so glad if some one who has been baptized could receive the gift of tongues as the ancient Saints did and speak to us,\" said Moses Nickerson.  \"If one of you will rise up and open your mouth it shall be filled, and you shall speak in tongues,\" replied the Prophet.  Every one then turned as by a common instinct to Lydia, and said with one voice, \"Sister Lydia rise up.\"  And then the great glory of God was manifested to this weak but trusting girl. She was enveloped as with a flame, and, unable longer to retain her seat, she arose and her mouth was filled with the praises of God and His glory. The spirit of tongues was upon her, and she was clothed in a shining light, so bright that all present saw it with great distinctness above the light of the fire and the candles.  The visitors had desired to return on the next day, which was Tuesday. Accordingly, preparations were made for their departure. It was decided that the Prophet and Elder Rigdon should return by crossing Lake Erie, Freeman giving them the money to do so. They all started out together-- old Mr. and Mrs. Nickerson, and Joseph and Sydney. The journey was thus shortened by two or three hundred miles for the Prophet and his companion.  That morning, while the team was being hitched up, Joseph paced back and forth in the sitting room in deep study. Finally he spoke up and said:  \"I have been pondering on Sister Lydia's lonely condition, and wondering why it is that she has passed through so much sorrow and affliction and is thus separated from all her relatives. I now understand it. The Lord has suffered it even as He allowed Joseph of old to be afflicted, who was sold by his brethren as a slave into a far country, and through that became a savior to his father's house and country. Even so shall it be with her, the hand of the Lord will overrule it for good to her and her father's family.\"  Turning to the young girl he continued: \"Sister Lydia, great are your blessings. The Lord, your Savior, loves you, and will overrule all your past sorrows and afflictions for good unto you. Let your heart be comforted. You are of the blood of Israel descended through the loins of Ephraim. You shall yet be a savior to your father's house. Therefore be comforted, and let your heart rejoice, for the Lord has a great work for you to do. Be faithful and endure unto the end and all will be well.\"  Immediately after that the party set out, and left behind many warm and faithful friends.  The good work thus commenced continued with unabated vigor and numbers came forward and were baptized.    CHAPTER IV.  Lydia remained here until the Summer of '34, and then, on seeing a chance to return within about eighty miles of her home in western New York, she did so. At a town called St. Catherine she remained some two months, and then went by stage to her father's house.  So beautiful was this gospel in the eyes of the ardent girl, that she felt that all that was needful for her parents to share in her joy, was simply to tell them the story. But as is often the case, the father and mother, although so good and kind, could not comprehend the truth.  \"Lydia,\" said the mother, \"you don't mean to tell me you have united yourself with those disgraceful Mormons. To think that my daughter should dishonor herself by being cheated and deluded by those imposters!\"  \"Oh, mother,\" the tearful Lydia replied, \"don't call those great and good men imposters, whom I have had the honor to see and know. Indeed they are true gentlemen and earnest Christians. If you would only let me tell you of these great truths that have been revealed from heaven.\"  But arguments and tears were of no avail. Nothing could induce the indignant mother who was a strict Presbyterian, or the quiet father, who, although professing no religion, was conscientious and moral, to accept her views for one moment. On the other hand, the principles Lydia had embraced were too precious to be given up for father or mother, tenderly loved as they were.  \"It's no use,\" at last said the mother, \"you know Lydia never would leave the sheep-skin till the last lock was pulled.\"  The girl grew restless and unhappy under the constant railery and derision showered upon the despised religion by her parents, while, at the same time they gave much pity and sympathy to their poor deluded daughter.  At last she decided upon going out to Kirtland which was then the gathering place of the Saints. Seeing her so determined Mr. and Mrs. Goldthwait gave Lydia ample means to go to her destination, and be comfortable and respectable. In the Spring of '35, once more this lone woman started out on a journey.  On reaching Kirtland, the family with whom Lydia had traveled, set at once to make arrangements to settle down. Leaving his wife and Lydia at the hotel, Mr. Knight, for that was the gentleman's name, went out, soon returning with his brother Vincent, who was a resident of Kirtland. On being introduced to Lydia, Vincent Knight said: \"Sister, the Prophet is in bondage and has been brought into distress by the persecutions of the wicked, and if you have any means to give, it will be a benefit to him.\" \"Oh yes, sir,\" she replied, \"here is all I have. I only wish it was more,\" emptying her purse, containing, perhaps fifty dollars, in his hand as she spoke.  He looked at it and counted it and fervently exclaimed: \"Thank God, this will release and set the Prophet free!\"  The young girl was without means now, even to procure a meal or a night's lodging. Still the sweet spirit that rested upon her whispered \"all will be well.\"  As evening drew on, Vincent Knight returned and brought the welcome news that Joseph was at liberty, and Lydia's joy to think that she had been the humble means of helping the Prophet was unbounded.  After talking some time Vincent remarked to her: \"Now sister, if you think you can be comfortable and happy with my family, you are welcome to a home there. You shall be as a sister to my wife and myself.\"  Was not here the promise of the spirit beautifully verified?  For six or eight months Lydia lived a pleasant life beneath this good man's roof.  In the Fall of '35, the Prophet's brother Hyrum requested Lydia to come to his home and assist his wife. He promised her she should receive all the care and thought that could be given to her if she really were at home. She complied with the request, and while living there became acquainted with one of the brethren who boarded at the place while working on the Kirtland Temple. His name was Newel Knight, although not related in any way with the Knight family spoken of in the beginning of this chapter. The young man was tall, had light brown, hair, a keen blue eye and a very energetic and determined manner.  \"Brother Knight is a widower,\" remarked Sister Smith one day when she and Lydia were busily at work.  \"Oh indeed,\" laconically replied the girl.  \"Yes, poor fellow. He lost his wife last Fall. She was a delicate woman, and the many trials and persecutions she suffered were too much for her frail body, and she died when her baby was but two days old. The little one lived but a few hours. Poor Brother Knight! His heart was almost broken. He has a little boy three years old living with his aunt, Newel's sister. Poor fellow, he is very lonely.\"  Lydia went on with her work making no reply, although her heart ached with sympathy for the desolate young man; for was _she_ not well acquainted with sorrow? did not she know the anguish of being alone?  But well she knew that friendly interest was all she could give to this noble man who had so plainly shown his interest in her.  One day as they sat alone together in the family room. Newel said to her kindly, very gently:  \"My child, you seem very lonely as well as myself. Why can we not comfort each other?\"  \"Sir,\" she replied indignantly, \"I know my condition is lonely and not a desirable one, but I do not wish you to insult me. I have not the slightest knowledge where my husband is, or whether he is alive or dead. But I do not wish to take any step to make my condition worse or bring shame upon my family and deprive me of the salvation I am seeking to obtain.\"  With these words she immediately left the room giving him"]]]
