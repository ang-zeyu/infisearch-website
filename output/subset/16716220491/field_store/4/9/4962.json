Tell me, Hylas, is this real existence equally compatible to all degrees of heat, which we perceive; or is there any reason why we should attribute it to some, and deny it to others? And if there be, pray let me know that reason.  HYL.  Whatever degree of heat we perceive by sense, we may be sure the same exists in the object that occasions it.  PHIL.  What! the greatest as well as the least?  HYL.  _I_ tell you, the reason is plainly the same in respect of both. They are both perceived by sense; nay, the greater degree of heat is more sensibly perceived; and consequently, if there is any difference, we are more certain of its real existence than we can be of the reality of a lesser degree.  PHIL.  But is not the most vehement and intense degree of heat a very great pain?  HYL.  No one can deny it.  PHIL.  And is any unperceiving thing capable of pain or pleasure?  HYL.  No, certainly.  PHIL.  Is your material substance a senseless being, or a being endowed with sense and perception?  HYL.  It is senseless without doubt.  PHIL.  It cannot therefore be the subject of pain?  HYL.  By no means.  PHIL.  Nor consequently of the greatest heat perceived by sense, since you acknowledge this to be no small pain?  HYL.  I grant it.  PHIL.  What shall we say then of your external object; is it a material Substance, or no?  HYL.  It is a material substance with the sensible qualities inhering in it.  PHIL.  How then can a great heat exist in it, since you own it cannot in a material substance? I desire you would clear this point.  HYL.  Hold, Philonous, I fear I was out in yielding intense heat to be a pain. It should seem rather, that pain is something distinct from heat, and the consequence or effect of it.  PHIL.  Upon putting your hand near the fire, do you perceive one simple uniform sensation, or two distinct sensations?  HYL.  But one simple sensation.  PHIL.  Is not the heat immediately perceived?  HYL.  It is.  PHIL.  And the pain?  HYL.  True.  PHIL.  Seeing therefore they are both immediately perceived at the same time, and the fire affects you only with one simple or uncompounded idea, it follows that this same simple idea is both the intense heat immediately perceived, and the pain; and, consequently, that the intense heat immediately perceived is nothing distinct from a particular sort of pain.  HYL.  It seems so.  PHIL.  Again, try in your thoughts, Hylas, if you can conceive a vehement sensation to be without pain or pleasure.  HYL.  I cannot.  PHIL.  Or can you frame to yourself an idea of sensible pain or pleasure in general, abstracted from every particular idea of heat, cold, tastes, smells? &c.  HYL.  I do not find that I can.  PHIL.  Doth it not therefore follow, that sensible pain is nothing distinct from those sensations or ideas, in an intense degree?  HYL.  It is undeniable; and, to speak the truth, I begin to suspect a very great heat cannot exist but in a mind perceiving it.  PHIL.  What! are you then in that sceptical state of suspense, between affirming and denying?  HYL.  I think I may be positive in the point. A very violent and painful heat cannot exist without the mind.  PHIL.  It hath not therefore according to you, any REAL being?  HYL.  I own it.  PHIL.  Is it therefore certain, that there is no body in nature really hot?  HYL.  I have not denied there is any real heat in bodies. I only say, there is no such thing as an intense real heat.  PHIL.  But, did you not say before that all degrees of heat were equally real; or, if there was any difference, that the greater were more undoubtedly real than the lesser?  HYL.  True: but it was because I did not then consider the ground there is for distinguishing between them, which I now plainly see. And it is this: because intense heat is nothing else but a particular kind of painful sensation; and pain cannot exist but in a perceiving being; it follows that no intense heat can really exist in an unperceiving corporeal substance. But this is no reason why we should deny heat in an inferior degree to exist in such a substance.  PHIL.  But how shall we be able to discern those degrees of heat which exist only in the mind from those which exist without it?  HYL.  That is no difficult matter. You know the least pain cannot exist unperceived; whatever, therefore, degree of heat is a pain exists only in the mind. But, as for all other degrees of heat, nothing obliges us to think the same of them.  PHIL.  I think you granted before that no unperceiving being was capable of pleasure, any more than of pain.  HYL.  I did.  PHIL.  And is not warmth, or a more gentle degree of heat than what causes uneasiness, a pleasure?  HYL.  What then?  PHIL.  Consequently, it cannot exist without the mind in an unperceiving substance, or body.  HYL.  So it seems.  PHIL.  Since, therefore, as well those degrees of heat that are not painful, as those that are, can exist only in a thinking substance; may we not conclude that external bodies are absolutely incapable of any degree of heat whatsoever?  HYL.  On second thoughts, I do not think it so evident that warmth is a pleasure as that a great degree of heat is a pain.  PHIL.  _I_ do not pretend that warmth is as great a pleasure as heat is a pain. But, if you grant it to be even a small pleasure, it serves to make good my conclusion.  HYL.  I could rather call it an INDOLENCE. It seems to be nothing more than a privation of both pain and pleasure. And that such a quality or state as this may agree to an unthinking substance, I hope you will not deny.  PHIL.  If you are resolved to maintain that warmth, or a gentle degree of heat, is no pleasure, I know not how to convince you otherwise than by appealing to your own sense. But what think you of cold?  HYL.  The same that I do of heat. An intense degree of cold is a pain; for to feel a very great cold, is to perceive a great uneasiness: it cannot therefore exist without the mind; but a lesser degree of cold may, as well as a lesser degree of heat.  PHIL.  Those bodies, therefore, upon whose application to our own, we perceive a moderate degree of heat, must be concluded to have a moderate degree of heat or warmth in them; and those, upon whose application we feel a like degree of cold, must be thought to have cold in them.  HYL.  They must.  PHIL.  Can any doctrine be true that necessarily leads a man into an absurdity?  HYL.  Without doubt it cannot.  PHIL.  Is it not an absurdity to think that the same thing should be at the same time both cold and warm?  HYL.  It is.  PHIL.  Suppose now one of your hands hot, and the other cold, and that they are both at once put into the same vessel of water, in an intermediate state; will not the water seem cold to one hand, and warm to the other?  HYL.  It will.  PHIL.  Ought we not therefore, by your principles, to conclude it is really both cold and warm at the same time, that is, according to your own concession, to believe an absurdity?  HYL.  I confess it seems so.  PHIL.  Consequently, the principles themselves are false, since you have granted that no true principle leads to an absurdity.  HYL.  But, after all, can anything be more absurd than to say, THERE IS NO HEAT IN THE FIRE?  PHIL.  To make the point still clearer; tell me whether, in two cases exactly alike, we ought not to make the same judgment?  HYL.  We ought.  PHIL.  When a pin pricks your finger, doth it not rend and divide the fibres of your flesh?  HYL.  It doth.  PHIL.  And when a coal burns your finger, doth it any more?  HYL.  It doth not.  PHIL.  Since, therefore, you neither judge the sensation itself occasioned by the pin, nor anything like it to be in the pin; you should not, conformably to what you have now granted, judge the sensation occasioned by the fire, or anything like it, to be in the fire.  HYL.  Well, since it must be so, I am content to yield this point, and acknowledge that heat and cold are only sensations existing in our minds. But there still remain qualities enough to secure the reality of external things.  PHIL.  But what will you say, Hylas, if it shall appear that the case is the same with regard to all other sensible qualities, and that they can no more be supposed to exist without the mind, than heat and cold?  HYL.  Then indeed you will have done something to the purpose; but that is what I despair of seeing proved.  PHIL.  Let us examine them in order. What think you of TASTES, do they exist without the mind, or no?  HYL.  Can any man in his senses doubt whether sugar is sweet, or wormwood bitter?  PHIL.  Inform me, Hylas. Is a sweet taste a particular kind of pleasure or pleasant sensation, or is it not?  HYL.  It is.  PHIL.  And is not bitterness some kind of uneasiness or pain?  HYL.  I grant it.  PHIL.  If therefore sugar and wormwood are unthinking corporeal substances existing without the mind, how can sweetness and bitterness, that is, Pleasure and pain, agree to them?  HYL.  Hold, Philonous, I now see what it was delude time. You asked whether heat and cold, sweetness at were not particular sorts of pleasure and pain; to which simply, that they were. Whereas I should have thus distinguished: those qualities, as perceived by us, are pleasures or pair existing in the external objects. We must not therefore conclude absolutely, that there is no heat in the fire, or sweetness in the sugar, but only that heat or sweetness, as perceived by us, are not in the fire or sugar. What say you to this?  PHIL.  I say it is nothing to the purpose. Our discourse proceeded altogether concerning sensible things, which you defined to be, THE THINGS WE IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVE BY OUR SENSES. Whatever other qualities, therefore, you speak of as distinct from these, I know nothing of them, neither do they at all belong to the point in dispute. You may, indeed, pretend to have discovered certain qualities which you do not perceive, and assert those insensible qualities exist in fire and sugar. But what use can be made of this to your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4724"],["title","Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics and (#2)"],["body","purpose, I am at a loss to conceive. Tell me then once more, do you acknowledge that heat and cold, sweetness and bitterness (meaning those qualities which are perceived by the senses), do not exist without the mind?  HYL.  I see it is to no purpose to hold out, so I give up the cause as to those mentioned qualities. Though I profess it sounds oddly, to say that sugar is not sweet.  PHIL.  But, for your farther satisfaction, take this along with you: that which at other times seems sweet, shall, to a distempered palate, appear bitter. And, nothing can be plainer than that divers persons perceive different tastes in the same food; since that which one man delights in, another abhors. And how could this be, if the taste was something really inherent in the food?  HYL.  I acknowledge I know not how.  PHIL.  In the next place, ODOURS are to be considered. And, with regard to these, I would fain know whether what hath been said of tastes doth not exactly agree to them? Are they not so many pleasing or displeasing sensations?  HYL.  They are.  PHIL.  Can you then conceive it possible that they should exist in an unperceiving thing?  HYL.  I cannot.  PHIL.  Or, can you imagine that filth and ordure affect those brute animals that feed on them out of choice, with the same smells which we perceive in them?  HYL.  By no means.  PHIL.  May we not therefore conclude of smells, as of the other forementioned qualities, that they cannot exist in any but a perceiving substance or mind?  HYL.  I think so.  PHIL.  Then as to SOUNDS, what must we think of them: are they accidents really inherent in external bodies, or not?  HYL.  That they inhere not in the sonorous bodies is plain from hence: because a bell struck in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump sends forth no sound. The air, therefore, must be thought the subject of sound.  PHIL.  What reason is there for that, Hylas?  HYL.  Because, when any motion is raised in the air, we perceive a sound greater or lesser, according to the air's motion; but without some motion in the air, we never hear any sound at all.  PHIL.  And granting that we never hear a sound but when some motion is produced in the air, yet I do not see how you can infer from thence, that the sound itself is in the air.  HYL.  It is this very motion in the external air that produces in the mind the sensation of SOUND. For, striking on the drum of the ear, it causeth a vibration, which by the auditory nerves being communicated to the brain, the soul is thereupon affected with the sensation called SOUND.  PHIL.  What! is sound then a sensation?  HYL.  I tell you, as perceived by us, it is a particular sensation in the mind.  PHIL.  And can any sensation exist without the mind?  HYL.  No, certainly.  PHIL.  How then can sound, being a sensation, exist in the air, if by the AIR you mean a senseless substance existing without the mind?  HYL.  You must distinguish, Philonous, between sound as it is perceived by us, and as it is in itself; or (which is the same thing) between the sound we immediately perceive, and that which exists without us. The former, indeed, is a particular kind of sensation, but the latter is merely a vibrative or undulatory motion the air.  PHIL.  I thought I had already obviated that distinction, by answer I gave when you were applying it in a like case before. But, to say no more of that, are you sure then that sound is really nothing but motion?  HYL.  I am.  PHIL.  Whatever therefore agrees to real sound, may with truth be attributed to motion?  HYL.  It may.  PHIL.  It is then good sense to speak of MOTION as of a thing that is LOUD, SWEET, ACUTE, or GRAVE.  HYL.  _I_ see you are resolved not to understand me. Is it not evident those accidents or modes belong only to sensible sound, or SOUND in the common acceptation of the word, but not to sound in the real and philosophic sense; which, as I just now told you, is nothing but a certain motion of the air?  PHIL.  It seems then there are two sorts of sound--the one vulgar, or that which is heard, the other philosophical and real?  HYL.  Even so.  PHIL.  And the latter consists in motion?  HYL.  I told you so before.  PHIL.  Tell me, Hylas, to which of the senses, think you, the idea of motion belongs? to the hearing?  HYL.  No, certainly; but to the sight and touch.  PHIL.  It should follow then, that, according to you, real sounds may possibly be SEEN OR FELT, but never HEARD.  HYL.  Look you, Philonous, you may, if you please, make a jest of my opinion, but that will not alter the truth of things. I own, indeed, the inferences you draw me into sound something oddly; but common language, you know, is framed by, and for the use of the vulgar: we must not therefore wonder if expressions adapted to exact philosophic notions seem uncouth and out of the way.  PHIL.  Is it come to that? I assure you, I imagine myself to have gained no small point, since you make so light of departing from common phrases and opinions; it being a main part of our inquiry, to examine whose notions are widest of the common road, and most repugnant to the general sense of the world. But, can you think it no more than a philosophical paradox, to say that REAL SOUNDS ARE NEVER HEARD, and that the idea of them is obtained by some other sense? And is there nothing in this contrary to nature and the truth of things?  HYL.  To deal ingenuously, I do not like it. And, after the concessions already made, I had as well grant that sounds too have no real being without the mind.  PHIL.  And I hope you will make no difficulty to acknowledge the same of COLOURS.  HYL.  Pardon me: the case of colours is very different. Can anything be plainer than that we see them on the objects?  PHIL.  The objects you speak of are, I suppose, corporeal Substances existing without the mind?  HYL.  They are.  PHIL.  And have true and real colours inhering in them?  HYL.  Each visible object hath that colour which we see in it.  PHIL.  How! is there anything visible but what we perceive by sight?  HYL.  There is not.  PHIL.  And, do we perceive anything by sense which we do not perceive immediately?  HYL.  How often must I be obliged to repeat the same thing? I tell you, we do not.  PHIL.  Have patience, good Hylas; and tell me once more, whether there is anything immediately perceived by the senses, except sensible qualities. I know you asserted there was not; but I would now be informed, whether you still persist in the same opinion.  HYL.  I do.  PHIL.  Pray, is your corporeal substance either a sensible quality, or made up of sensible qualities?  HYL.  What a question that is! who ever thought it was?  PHIL.  My reason for asking was, because in saying, EACH VISIBLE OBJECT HATH THAT COLOUR WHICH WE SEE IN IT, you make visible objects to be corporeal substances; which implies either that corporeal substances are sensible qualities, or else that there is something besides sensible qualities perceived by sight: but, as this point was formerly agreed between us, and is still maintained by you, it is a clear consequence, that your CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE is nothing distinct from SENSIBLE QUALITIES.  HYL.  You may draw as many absurd consequences as you please, and endeavour to perplex the plainest things; but you shall never persuade me out of my senses. I clearly understand my own meaning.  PHIL.  I wish you would make me understand it too. But, since you are unwilling to have your notion of corporeal substance examined, I shall urge that point no farther. Only be pleased to let me know, whether the same colours which we see exist in external bodies, or some other.  HYL.  The very same.  PHIL.  What! are then the beautiful red and purple we see on yonder clouds really in them? Or do you imagine they have in themselves any other form than that of a dark mist or vapour?  HYL.  I must own, Philonous, those colours are not really in the clouds as they seem to be at this distance. They are only apparent colours.  PHIL.  APPARENT call you them? how shall we distinguish these apparent colours from real?  HYL.  Very easily. Those are to be thought apparent which, appearing only at a distance, vanish upon a nearer approach.  PHIL.  And those, I suppose, are to be thought real which are discovered by the most near and exact survey.  HYL.  Right.  PHIL.  Is the nearest and exactest survey made by the help of a microscope, or by the naked eye?  HYL.  By a microscope, doubtless.  PHIL.  But a microscope often discovers colours in an object different from those perceived by the unassisted sight. And, in case we had microscopes magnifying to any assigned degree, it is certain that no object whatsoever, viewed through them, would appear in the same colour which it exhibits to the naked eye.  HYL.  And what will you conclude from all this? You cannot argue that there are really and naturally no colours on objects: because by artificial managements they may be altered, or made to vanish.  PHIL.  I think it may evidently be concluded from your own concessions, that all the colours we see with our naked eyes are only apparent as those on the clouds, since they vanish upon a more close and accurate inspection which is afforded us by a microscope. Then' as to what you say by way of prevention: I ask you whether the real and natural state of an object is better discovered by a very sharp and piercing sight, or by one which is less sharp?  HYL.  By the former without doubt.  PHIL.  Is it not plain from DIOPTRICS that microscopes make the sight more penetrating, and represent objects as they would appear to the eye in case it were naturally endowed with a most exquisite sharpness?  HYL.  It is.  PHIL.  Consequently the microscopical representation is to be thought that which best sets forth the real nature of the thing, or what it is in itself. The colours, therefore, by it perceived are more genuine and real than those perceived otherwise.  HYL.  I confess there is something in what you say.  PHIL.  Besides, it is"]]]
