If the child was female and became a woman like his wife, then the effect of such strength would be awful indeed. He envisioned a militant reformer, an iron-bound Calvinist, remodelling the world single-handed. A Scotch Lilith, a matronly Gabriel, a she-Hercules. He shuddered.  A hundred times he denied his science. A hundred and one times it begged him to be served. Each decision to drop the idea was followed by an effort to discover means to inoculate her without her knowledge. To his wakeful ears came the reverberation of her snores. He rose and paced the floor. A scheme came to him. After that he was lost.  Mrs. Danner was surprised when her husband brought a bottle of blackberry cordial to her. It was his first gift to her in more than a year. She was fond of cordial. He was not. She took a glass after supper and then a second, which she drank \"for him.\" He smiled nervously and urged her to drink it. His hands clenched and unclenched. When she finished the second glass, he watched her constantly.  \"I feel sleepy,\" she said.  \"You're tired.\" He tried to dissemble the eagerness in his voice. \"Why don't you lie down?\"  \"Strange,\" she said a moment later. \"I'm not usually so--so--misty.\"  He nodded. The opiate in the cordial was working. She lay on the couch. She slept. The professor hastened to his laboratory. An hour later he emerged with a hypodermic syringe in his hand. His wife lay limply, one hand touching the floor. Her stern, dark face was relaxed. He sat beside her. His conscience raged. He hated the duplicity his task required. His eyes lingered on the swollen abdomen. It was cryptic, enigmatic, filled with portent. He jabbed the needle. She did not stir. After that he substituted a partly empty bottle of cordial for the drugged liquor. It was, perhaps, the most practical thing he had ever done in his life.  Mrs. Danner could not explain herself on the following morning. She belaboured him. \"Why didn't you wake me and make me go to bed? Sleeping in my clothes! I never did such a thing in my life.\"  \"I couldn't wake you. I tried.\"  \"Rubbish.\"  \"You were sleeping so hard--you refused to move.\"  \"Sometimes, old as you are, I'd like to thrash you.\"  Danner went to the college. There was nothing more to do, nothing more to require his concentration. He could wait--as he had waited before. He trembled occasionally with the hope that his child would be a boy--a sane, healthy boy. Then, in the end, his work might bear fruit. \"The _Euglena viridis_,\" he said in flat tones, \"will be the subject of to-morrow's study. I want you gentlemen to diagram the structure of the _Euglena viridis_ and write five hundred words on its vital principles and processes. It is particularly interesting because it shares properties that are animal with properties that are vegetable.\"  September, October, November. Chilly winds from the high mountains. The day-by-day freezing over of ponds and brooks. Smoke at the tops of chimneys. Snow. Thanksgiving. And always Mrs. Danner growing with the burden of her offspring. Mr. Danner sitting silent, watching, wondering, waiting. It would soon be time.  On Christmas morning there entered into Mrs. Danner's vitals a pain that was indefinable and at the same time certain. It thrust all thought from her mind. Then it diminished and she summoned her husband. \"Get the doctor. It's coming.\"  Danner tottered into the street and executed his errand. The doctor smiled cheerfully. \"Just beginning? I'll be over this afternoon.\"  \"But--good Lord--you can't leave her like--\"  \"Nonsense.\"  He came home and found his wife dusting. He shook his head. \"Get Mrs. Nolan,\" she said. Then she threw herself on the bed again.  Mrs. Nolan, the nearest neighbour, wife of Professor Nolan and mother of four children, was delighted. This particular Christmas was going to be a day of some excitement. She prepared hot water and bustled with unessential occupation. Danner sat prostrate in the parlour. He had done it. He had done more--and that would be known later. Perhaps it would fail. He hoped it would fail. He wrung his hands. The concept of another person in his house had not yet occurred to him. Birth was his wife's sickness--until it was over.  The doctor arrived after Danner had made his third trip. Mrs. Nolan prepared lunch. \"I love to cook in other people's kitchens,\" she said. He wanted to strike her. Curious, he thought. At three-thirty the industry of the doctor and Mrs. Nolan increased and the silence of the two, paradoxically, increased with it.  Then the early twilight fell. Mrs. Danner lay with her lank black hair plastered to her brow. She did not moan. Pain twisted and convulsed her. Downstairs Danner sat and sweated. A cry--his wife's. Another--unfamiliar. Scurrying feet on the bare parts of the floor. He looked up. Mrs. Nolan leaned over the stair well.  \"It's a boy, Mr. Danner. A beautiful boy. And husky. You never saw such a husky baby.\"  \"It ought to be,\" he said. They found him later in the back yard, prancing on the snow with weird, ungainly steps. A vacant smile lighted his features. They didn't blame him.     III   Calm and quiet held their negative sway over the Danner m√©nage for an hour, and then there was a disturbed fretting that developed into a lusty bawl. The professor passed a fatigued hand over his brow. He was unaccustomed to the dissonances of his offspring. Young Hugo--they had named him after a maternal uncle--had attained the age of one week without giving any indication of unnaturalness.  That is not quite true. He was as fleshy as most healthy infants, but the flesh was more than normally firm. He was inordinately active. His eyes had been gray but, already, they gave promise of the inkiness they afterwards exhibited. He was born with a quantity of black hair--hair so dark as to be nearly blue. Abednego Danner, on seeing it, exercised the liberty which all husbands take, and investigated rumours of his wife's forbears with his most secret thoughts. The principal rumour was that one of her lusty Covenanter grandsires had been intrigued by a squaw to the point of forgetting his Psalms and recalling only the Song of Solomon.  However that may have been, Hugo was an attractive and virile baby. Danner spent hours at the side of his crib speculating and watching for any sign of biological variation. But it was not until a week had passed that he was given evidence. By that time he was ready to concede the failure of his greatest experiment.  The baby bawled and presently stopped. And Mrs. Danner, who had put it to breast, suddenly called her husband. \"Abednego! Come here! Hurry!\"  The professor's heart skipped its regular timing and he scrambled to the floor above. \"What's the matter?\"  Mrs. Danner was sitting in a rocking-chair. Her face was as white as paper. Only in her eyes was there a spark of life. He thought she was going to faint. \"What's the matter?\" he said again.  He looked at Hugo and saw nothing terrifying in the ravishing hunger which the infant showed.  \"Matter! Matter! You know the matter!\"  Then he knew and he realized that his wife had discovered. \"I don't. You look frightened. Shall I bring some water?\"  Mrs. Danner spoke again. Her voice was icy, distant, terrible. \"I came in to feed him just a minute ago. He was lying in his crib. I tried to--to hug him and he put his arms out. As God lives, I could not pull that baby to me! He was too strong, Abednego! Too strong. Too strong. I couldn't unbend his little arms when he stiffened them. I couldn't straighten them when he bent them. And he pushed me--harder than you could push. Harder than I could push myself. I know what it means. You have done your horrible thing to my baby. He's just a baby, Abednego. And you've done your thing to him. How could you? Oh, how could you!\"  Mrs. Danner rose and laid the baby gently on the chair. She stood before her husband, towering over him, raised her hand, and struck with all her force. Mr. Danner fell to one knee, and a red welt lifted on his face. She struck him again and he fell against the chair. Little Hugo was dislodged. One hand caught a rung of the chair back and he hung suspended above the floor.  \"Look!\" Mrs. Danner screamed.  As they looked, the baby flexed its arm and lifted itself back into the chair. It was a feat that a gymnast would have accomplished with difficulty. Danner stared, ignoring the blows, the crimson on his cheek. For once in his lifetime, he suddenly defied his wife. He pointed to the child.  \"Yes, look!\" His voice rang clearly. \"I did it. I vaccinated you the night the cordial put you to sleep. And there's my son. He's strong. Stronger than a lion's cub. And he'll increase in strength as he grows until Samson and Hercules would be pygmies beside him. He'll be the first of a new and glorious race. A race that doesn't have to fear--because it cannot know harm. No man can hurt him, no man can vanquish him. He will be mightier than any circumstances. He, son of a weak man, will be stronger than the beasts, even than the ancient dinosaurs, stronger than the tides, stronger than fate--strong as God is strong. And you--you, Matilda--mother of him, will be proud of him. He will be great and famous. You can knock me down. You can knock me down a thousand times. I have given you a son whose little finger you cannot bend with a crow-bar. Oh, all these years I've listened to you and obeyed you and--yes, I've feared you a little--and God must hate me for it. Now take your son. And my son. You cannot change him. You cannot bend him to your will. He is all I might have been. All that mankind should be.\" Danner's voice broke and he sobbed. He relented. \"I know it's hard for you. It's against your religion--against your love, even. But try to like him. He's no different from you and me--only stronger. And strength is a glorious thing, a great thing. Then--afterwards--if you can--forgive me.\" He collapsed.  Blood pounded in her ears."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42919"],["title","Angel Unawares: A Story of Christmas Eve (#1)"],["body","picture of the Madonna Mademoiselle had--was very grave and sad. That was strange, in this beautiful garden full of flowers and sunshine; like a wrong note in music, if Angel mischievously struck a key while mother was playing something gay and sweet. Besides, the woman had on a dress that wasn't pretty at all, or like the dresses mother wore. It was brown, and plain, without any trimming, almost like a servant's dress. Angel wished she would go away, but she didn't; she stooped down and began to do two very queer things. Both were queer for a woman to do, and one was dreadful.  The first thing--the thing that was only queer--was to cover up a bed of very delicate flowers, whose name Angel had never heard, with gray stuff such as kitchen towels are made of, only much thicker and rougher. The woman had been carrying a large bundle of this in her arms, and in covering the bed she supported the gray stuff on sticks higher than the flowers.  The other queer thing she did, which was dreadful as well as queer, was to cry. It seemed awful to Angel that a grown-up woman should cry--cry in a beautiful garden, where she thought she was alone. And on Christmas Eve! Angel felt quite sick. Her throat filled as if she, too, were going to cry. It was all she could do not to give the kitten a nervous squeeze. She was seized with a wild wish to rush out and try to comfort the woman; but instinct even more than childish shyness held her back. Angel knew that, if she had stolen away to cry where she hoped not to be seen, she would hate to have a strange person jump out and surprise her. Probably she would hate it even more if she were a grown-up.  The child hidden under the palm-tree and the woman outside were so near to each other that the child could hear the woman give choking sobs which it seemed as if she tried to swallow. Perhaps she didn't try hard enough at first, for the sobs, instead of stopping, came faster and harder, and Angel's large, horrified eyes saw tears run down the woman's face and splash on to the flowers. Suddenly, however, the gasping ceased. The woman let fall an end of the bagging not yet draped over the sticks, and sprang to her feet with the quick grace of a frightened fawn. Not that Angel definitely thought of any such simile, but away in the back of her mind dimly materialized the picture of a deer she had once seen rise up among the tall grasses in a public park.  The young woman fumbled in the pocket of her shabby brown dress and found a handkerchief. She hurriedly dabbed her eyes, and rubbed her cheeks hard, as if to make them so red that the redness of her eyelids might not be noticed.  \"She must have heard some noise,\" thought Angel; and as the thought formed she, too, heard what the woman had heard--the pat-pat of footsteps coming lightly and quickly across grass. Then from under the green-and-gold mimosas a man appeared--a tall, youngish man, very thin and pale, carrying a thing which seemed a mysterious object for a man to carry in his arms; but then, everything about this fairy garden was mysterious and puzzling.  Heavily leaning against the man's shoulder and hanging down over his back was a pine-tree, small for a pine-tree, but large for a person to carry. He came on with his head bent, and at first did not see the woman, so--apparently--he was not in search of her. But he limped as he walked, and the woman cried out sharply:  \"Oh, Paul, you've hurt yourself! You've had a fall!\"  He looked up, surprised. \"Why, dear one, I didn't know you were here,\" he said. \"I did slip on a stone coming down the mountain. But it's nothing. I've wrenched my ankle a little, that's all.\"  \"And you had that long, hard walk afterward!\" the woman exclaimed. \"My poor Paul! You out of bed only three days ago. It's too cruel. Everything goes against us.\"  \"Everything?\" He caught her up and a look of alarm or anxiety chased away the smile he had put on to reassure her. \"Has bad news come, then? But yes--you needn't answer. I know it has. I wish I hadn't said you might open the avocat's letter! You've been crying, Suze.\"  The woman spoke English as if it were her own language, but the man had an accent which showed that he was not born to it. Even Angel--listening half against her will--noticed that, almost unconsciously. But she had been forced to think a great deal about \"accent\" in the last few months since she had come to live in Paris and talk with a French governess. She had picked up French quickly, as children do, but was always having the word \"accent, accent!\" drummed into her head.  \"I couldn't help crying a little,\" said Suze. \"I didn't mean to let you know. I thought you'd be longer away.\"  \"You mustn't try to hide your feelings from me, dear,\" the man said. \"Troubles will be lighter if you let me bear them with you.\"  \"But you--you're always trying to cheer me up, no matter what's happened,\" the woman reminded him, almost reproachfully. Angel realized that they must be husband and wife. They were about the right age for each other, she thought; and even a child could see by the look in their eyes that they loved one another dearly. \"You pretend now that you're not hurt, but you are; you're suffering-- your face shows it. Ah! the dear face, so white, so patient! I hoped I should have good news for you when you came back. I hoped that in spite of everything we might have a little peace, a little happiness, just enough to last us over Christmas, if no more. But what's the use of our hoping? Always comes another blow!\" Her sobs broke out again. Tears poured over her cheeks.  The man stooped and laid the little pine-tree on the grass, letting it down carefully, not to break the branches. Then he took his wife in his arms and pressed her head against his shoulder. They looked two pathetic figures in their plain, rather shabby clothes, clinging together in the garden where everything save themselves was singing with joy of life and beauty.  \"You mustn't give way like this, Suze,\" said the man, gently. \"Think of the children.\"  \"I know,\" she sobbed, \"I hate myself for breaking down. I ought to think of _you_ as well as the children, though you'd never tell me to do that. You never think of yourself, except of what you can do for me and them. This Christmas tree you've brought! Even if you'd been well, it would have been a big adventure, toiling up into the mountains, tired after a day's work in the garden; looking for the right tree, sure to grow in the worst place to get at; cutting it down with an ax that's no more than a toy, and then bringing the thing home on your back! Why, it would be hard labor for a strong man---\"  \"Love gives strength,\" he soothed her, stroking her ruffled dark hair; and Angel thought that she had never seen a man's hand so thin. \"I've done myself no harm, truly, dear one. I may not be very strong yet, but I'm getting on. Last week you said you were thankful, whatever happened, to have me out of bed---\"  \"You oughtn't to have been out!\" Suze broke in, rebelliously. \"If we weren't so poor---\"  \"Never mind. It did me no real harm. I've had no relapse. And we've got each other and the children. There are rich people who'd change with us. Let's forget the bad news and the other troubles till after Christmas---\"  \"How _can_ we forget being hungry?\"  \"By eating an orange!\" The man tried to laugh. \"We've got plenty of those.\"  \"Just now we have. But if we're turned out?\"  \"We must do as Adam and Eve did when they were turned out of Eden. They found work, I suppose. So shall we. Though God knows it almost kills me to think of what I've brought on you and the babies.\"  \"Don't say 'you'! You've never brought anything but happiness to us or anybody.\"  \"I'm afraid--I've thought, sometimes--I had no right to marry you.\"  \"Why, life wouldn't have been life for me without you, Paul!\"  \"Or for me without you, Suze.\"  \"And all we've gone through has only drawn us closer together. But this last blow is different. It's too cruel! . . . That Judas of a man, Siegel, making us believe he was our good friend and he doing you a great kindness selling you this garden and the business so cheap! Think, Paul, how he described it, only last August, just after I found you in Antwerp when you were getting well after your wound. Would one _believe_ a man could make up his mind to ruin another who'd nearly given his life for his country? Plan and plan to rob him of his savings, pretending all the time to open the gates of Paradise---\"  \"Well, in one way this _is_ Paradise,\" said Paul, lifting his eyes to the sky which showered sunset roses through silver branches of olives, gold branches of mimosas.  \"Paradise with the serpent of deceit in it!\" cried Suze. \"The Nice lawyer says in his letter--_I'm_ not sorry you let me open it--that Siegel drew up the deeds so cleverly it's almost impossible to convict him of swindling. Monsieur Vignal thinks no business man would lend money on the chance of what you might get back from your deposit with Siegel if you sued him for false pretenses. And yet, in the next sentence, Vignal advises you to stand up against Siegel trying to turn you out because you can't and won't and oughtn't to pay the rest. He says, 'hold on to the place if you possibly can, and make Siegel attack you in the courts, so you can have a chance of bringing out the real facts and perhaps proving that you're an injured man.' He thinks if you could stop here instead of submitting to be turned out, the courts would very likely decide that you'd paid Siegel already as much as the business is worth, and the place would be accounted ours. Isn't that a mockery, when Monsieur Vignal knows as well as we do we haven't a penny to live on--that the Riviera's empty these war days, that nobody buys our plants, and you can't fill orders from over the Swiss or Italian frontiers, even if you could get _half_ as many as Siegel's lying books showed?\"  \"Vignal means well,\" said the man. \"It's good of him to advise me"]]]
