I fancy I'd like the chance to put into actual practice a bit of what I learned. Quite! It would be a bit satisfying to take a knife away from some Nazi blighter and toss him over my shoulder, the way they taught us.\"  \"You can say that again!\" Dave chuckled. \"I received a lot of lumps learning that bit of self-defense. I sure would like to try it out on a Nazi tramp. And no rubber knife, either, like the instructor used. But, heck! I guess we're just hollering down the rain barrel, pal. Commando and Yank Ranger units are being formed in England, not here. That's where the finishing touches are put on. After all, we're a couple of pilots, not infantrymen. No, I guess Colonel Welsh figured it might be a good idea to round out our combat education a bit. So he suggested that we take the course.\"  \"Probably,\" Freddy agreed with an unhappy sigh. \"Just a bit of schooling to keep us out of trouble while he decided what job to set us at next. Oh well, I enjoyed the schooling--thoroughly!\"  \"It was fun, and how,\" Dave grunted. \"But I sure hate to have all these tough muscles I built up go to waste. Doggone you, Freddy! Seeing you shovel that extra slab of pie into your face has made me hungry again! I guess I'll join you, at that. But without the tea!\"  Dave turned to signal the waiter, and it was then that he saw the man in person heading his way. The waiter carried a white envelope in one hand, and he was taking the shortest route across the dining room. In his other hand he carried the dinner check. In true waiter style, he presented the check first. Dave glanced at the score and whistled under his breath. The hotel they had picked slip-out-of-the-hat style was not exactly favorable to a Captain's pay. However, he felt a little better when he realized that three fourths of the check was Freddy Farmer's obligation.  \"Pardon,\" murmured the waiter. \"Are you Captains Dawson and Farmer?\"  \"That's right,\" Dave told him. \"I'm Captain Dawson. So that makes him Captain Farmer.\"  \"A gentleman just gave this to the head waiter, sir,\" the man said, and held out the envelope. \"He said it was to be given to either Captain Dawson or Captain Farmer.\"  \"Thanks,\" Dave said, and took the envelope.  It was plain white and contained Freddy's name and rank, and his own, on the outside. There was nothing else written on the front side. He glanced at Freddy and then turned it over to pry up the gummed flap. He saw that two ink lines had been drawn across the sealed portion. In that way it was possible to tell if the letter had been opened. He peered at the two ink lines and knew that the letter had not been unsealed.  \"What do you suppose?\" Freddy murmured.  \"Could be from the management asking us to leave because you eat too much,\" Dave grunted, and wedged a finger under the corner of the flap. \"But my guess is that it's what we've been waiting for: word from Colonel Welsh. He has a habit of doing things this way, you know. But pardon me! It's addressed to us both. Do you want to open it, my little man?\"  \"Stop your silly chatter, and open the blasted thing!\" the English youth snapped. \"I'm on pins and needles.\"  \"Give me time!\" Dave growled, and struggled with the flap. \"The darn thing seems nailed down as well as gummed. Okay. Here goes for the news.\"  He got the flap torn open and pulled out what was inside. It was a single sheet of fool's cap paper, and the words on it were neatly typed. He read the two paragraphs that made up the letter, and his scowl deepened with each new word. Freddy, watching him, twisted and squirmed in his chair with suspense. Finally he couldn't stand it any longer.  \"Here!\" he snapped. \"Pass it over, if you don't know how to read!\"  \"Take a read,\" Dave said softly, as his scowl remained. \"Take a _good_ read, and then _you_ tell me, pal!\"     CHAPTER TWO  _Night Attack_   It was all Freddy Farmer could do not to snatch the letter from Dave's extended hand. He took it, settled back in his chair, and bent his eyes on the typed words. Stunned amazement spread all over his wind- and sun-bronzed face as he read the two paragraphs.       \"Upon receiving this you will leave your hotel and proceed to Six      Hundred and Ninety-Seven (697) River Street.       \"The route you will follow to this address is as follows. Walk from      your hotel south to Cort Street. Go west along Cort Street to Tenth      Avenue. Then south to River Street, and east to Number 697. There      ring the bell under the name, Brown. Be sure to follow these route      directions exactly.       \"X-Fifteen\"  Freddy read it through twice, and then raised his eyes to meet Dave's.  \"X-Fifteen?\" he murmured softly. \"That's one of the code identifications that Colonel Welsh uses! So he must be here in New York, and not in Washington.\"  \"Could be,\" Dave grunted, and started to push back his chair. \"The Colonel gets around a lot, you know. Well, I guess that's us, pal. Certainly screwy orders. That's quite a walk from here. But maybe after you've had Commando training you're a sissy if you take a cab. So--Well, what do you know?\"  \"Eh?\" Freddy Farmer ejaculated. \"What do I know?\"  Dave stood up and half nodded his head at the other side of the dining room.  \"Our rough tough-looking friends have vanished in thin air,\" he said. \"They aren't around any more. Must have got sick of giving us the eye, and pulled out.\"  \"Their perfect right!\" Freddy snorted, and got up also. \"You were probably imagining things, anyway. Right you are. Let's get on with it. We--Half a minute, my fair weather friend! You haven't left enough money for your share of the dinner.\"  \"One fourth of the bill, plus tip,\" Dave grunted scornfully. \"Read it and weep. Three fourths of that went inside you, sweetheart. I love you like a brother, but I refuse to foot your food bills. Nix! And double nix!\"  \"Phew, so I did!\" Freddy gasped as he ran his eye down the list of things served them. \"And the trouble is, I'm still hungry. Oh, very well. Share and share alike, with a tightwad like you. Even figured it out to the penny, too! Now, if you were with me in England--\"  \"I'd be pleading with the cops not to have you shot for stomach hoarding!\" Dave snapped. \"Pay up, and shut up. Or pay it off washing dishes. You'd look cute in an apron, Freddy. I could meet you later and let you know what Colonel Welsh has to say. I--\"  He stopped and grinned wickedly as Freddy threw him a rapier glare. The English youth paid his share and then joined him as Dave walked out of the dining room. They got their hats from the check girl, and went on out through the hotel lobby to the street. The dim-out had come to New York City, and it made both of them think of London, and other war-scarred cities they had seen.  For several blocks they were too contented with their own thoughts to speak. But when they were almost halfway to their destination, Freddy Farmer broke the silence.  \"You know, Dave,\" he said, \"this makes a chap feel rather silly. It's like a game you'd play in school, or something. I mean, why in the world have us follow this particular route? You'd think we had valuable information, and were taking this route to some secret headquarters to throw off possible pursuit. Blasted queer, I call it!\"  \"You tell me something about war that isn't screwy at first glance,\" Dave grunted as they turned the corner into Cort Street. \"But Colonel Welsh knows his business, and if he wants us to walk all over town to report to him, then we walk all over town. But he sure did pick the darker streets. This one right here makes me think of a coal mine. Watch your step, Freddy, or you may spill into an ash can or something. In this section of town they don't always put them right on the curb. And--\"  Dave stopped talking abruptly, and he also pulled up to a quick halt. Freddy went on a pace or two, then stopped and waited.  \"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"Think you were running into one of them? An ash can, I mean?\"  \"No,\" Dawson grunted, and moved forward again. \"Thought I saw something moving up ahead--somebody ducking into a doorway. Doggone it! I must be getting the jimjams. You'd think I were trying to steal across Berlin and give the Gestapo the go-by. Good gosh! This is New York, for cat's sake! And--_Freddy!_\"  Dave had only time to bark out his pal's name as two shadows came charging out of a night-darkened doorway. He sensed them, rather than saw or heard them. It was more that sixth sense, that science calls premonition, that put him on the alert and made him drop halfway to one knee and shoot his hands up and out in front of him.  One of the shadows came at him like a streak of black lightning. He wasn't sure, but in the split second he was allowed to set himself he thought he saw the dull gleam of a knife in an upraised hand. Maybe so; maybe not. He didn't bother to make sure. The silent attacker was coming upon him too fast. There was no time for thought. There was only time for action--furious, split second action for which he had been training these last five weeks.  And so action it was! He dropped like a flash, ducked his head, and then stiffened his legs and shot his body upward, half turning it at the same time. He felt the top of his head crash into a broad chest, and he felt his hands lock about the wrist of the hand that held the knife. A quick pivot on the balls of his feet, and a bend downward that brought the attacker's arm down across his shoulder. He heard the gasp of pain, heard the clatter of a knife hitting the pavement, and then he was arching his back and twisting viciously. The result was that his helpless attacker flew over him like a sack of wet wheat, and slammed down on the pavement on his side. Dave clung to the wrist, but the attacker's greater weight pulled it free, and the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42250"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Commandos (#2)"],["body","went rolling over and over toward the gutter.  In a flash, Dave dived after him, but the attacker seemed full of coiled steel springs. He was up on his feet in a flash and speeding down the badly lighted street. Impulsively Dave streaked his hand to where his holstered service gun should have been. Only it wasn't there. It was back in the bureau drawer in his hotel room! He took a couple of leaping steps after the fleeing shadow, but checked himself and swerved sharply as a second shadow virtually flew past him. He shot out his hands, got hold of jacketcloth, but all the good that did him was that he ripped off a piece of a jacket as the second shadow went by him and down the street.  \"Dave! You all right?\"  He turned to see Freddy Farmer at his elbow. The English youth was breathing hard, and fingering the right side of his jaw.  \"I'm okay, but boiling!\" Dave grated. \"I had my bird cold, so I thought. But he must be made of rubber. I couldn't stay with him. What's the matter with your jaw?\"  \"The blighter's head!\" Freddy Farmer muttered. \"We connected violently. Say, Dave! Those beggars had knives. There's one! And there's the other. Phew! Wicked-looking things, aren't they?\"  The English youth had stooped down and retrieved two knives out of the gutter. In the bad light Dave and Freddy saw that they were mates. Each was about seven inches long, razor sharp, and with a needle point. Dave squinted at them and whistled softly.  \"You see what I see, Freddy?\" he breathed. \"They had knives exactly like those at the Commando school! Looks like a couple of thugs stole a couple.\"  \"But as you said, Dave,\" Freddy cried, \"this is New York! I know your underworld characters use machine guns, and such. But do they also go about the streets knifing people to steal their purses?\"  Dave didn't reply at once. He stood scowling down at the pair of knives, as cold, clammy chills started rippling up and down his spine. He knew full well that anything can happen in New York City, and usually does in time. But to be knifed for the few dollars he carried, instead of being blackjacked, or held up at the point of a gun, was something that just didn't jell right in his brain. He also was hit by another equally disturbing thought. The light had been so bad, and the action so swift and short lived, he hadn't got so much as a flash glimpse at either of the attackers. But for general build--well, he couldn't help but think of the two hard-faced men back in the hotel dining room.  \"I'm nuts, completely nuts!\" he chided himself aloud. \"It just couldn't have been!\"  \"What couldn't have been?\" Freddy Farmer wanted to know.  \"Those two, just now,\" Dave replied. \"I had the flash thought that they might have been that hard-faced pair in the dining room. But they didn't come at us from behind. They were ahead of us. Besides, they left before we did. Well, which of these do you want for a souvenir?\"  \"Neither,\" Freddy replied. \"I suggest we turn them over to Colonel Welsh. Those are Commando knives, right enough. He might be interested to know that some of your American underworld chaps also carry them.\"  \"Or--\" Dave started to say, and then stopped himself with a snort of disgust. \"Doggone, but my imagination is going haywire tonight! Must be something I ate.\"  \"You don't think they were underworld beggars?\" the English youth demanded. \"Good grief! You're not thinking of Nazi agents, are you?\"  \"Well, I did give it a whirl for a second or two,\" Dawson confessed with a shrug. \"But that's plain silly. No Nazi agents should have any interest in us, right now.\"  \"I don't know about that,\" Freddy grunted as they started along the street again. \"The Gestapo beggars are quite keen about revenge killings, you know. And we've been lucky enough to send a few of them to where they belong in days gone by.\"  \"Okay, Nazi agents!\" Dave snorted. \"They read those route instructions before we did, and were waiting for us in the dark doorway! See? It doesn't make sense, Freddy. It's all cockeyed to drag Nazi agents into this thing.\"  \"You're right, of course,\" the English youth murmured. \"But all I can say is, praise the good Lord for our Commando training. I'm still shuddering, thinking of one of those things slicing into my hide. And my beggar almost got me, I'll frankly confess.\"  \"Well, mine didn't exactly send me a letter,\" Dave echoed. \"I'm sore we didn't stop them, though. After that scare it would have done me a world of good to go to work on his mug. Well, one thing, and that's final. From now on I'm not going to leave my gun parked in a bureau drawer. Let the public laugh and snicker. If I'd had it, I could have clipped that bird in the leg and brought him down. But, boy! What a pair of broken field runners they were!\"  \"Let's try and forget about them, if you don't mind,\" Freddy said with a little shudder. \"And let's put on a bit of speed. My nerves never were of the best, you know.\"  The remark brought a laugh from Dave.  \"Listen to him lie, will you!\" he cried. \"Pal, if your nerves aren't the best I ever came across, then I'm Uncle Bay-Window Goering. But I was just about to suggest, myself, that we get over on Tenth Avenue where there's more light and fewer darkened doorways. Not too fast, though. I've still got some jelly in my knee joints.\"  The rest of the trip, though, was made without incident or accident. And in due time they were standing in front of a five storied brick building that was Number 697 River Street. The street was dimmed out like all the rest, but it wasn't half so dark as had been Cort Street. Also, there were plenty of people passing by on the sidewalks. They stared up at the building front in silence for a moment. It showed only one lighted room, and that was on the third floor.  \"Well let's go up the steps and push Mr. Brown's bell button,\" Dave eventually grunted. \"There's an entryway light there, so we should be able to find it. Let's go.\"  They went up the stone steps to the small outer foyer that contained a double row of bell buttons. They found the one that had \"Brown\" printed on the plate card, and Dave stabbed it with his thumb. They didn't hear the ring inside, and for a couple of minutes they stood there just waiting.  \"Give it another go, Dave,\" Freddy suggested.  Dawson lifted his hand, but froze it in mid-air as the shadow of a figure appeared on the other side of the door. There was the sound of a locking bolt being shot, and a key being turned. Then the door was pulled inward to reveal the figure on the other side. Both Dave and Freddy gulped and stared. Standing in the lighted doorway was a Sergeant of infantry, complete with side-arms. The Sergeant flashed them both a searching look, then stepped back, opening the door wider.  \"Come in, sirs,\" he said. \"And follow me, please.\"     CHAPTER THREE  _Eastward To War_   For a long minute Dave and Freddy just stood there and stared at the infantry Sergeant as though he were something escaped from a museum. Then they snapped out of their collective trance and stepped in through the door. It was then that Freddy let the question pop off his lips before he could stop it.  \"Is Colonel Welsh here, Sergeant?\" he asked.  The non-commissioned officer looked at him with a faint puzzled frown.  \"Colonel Welsh, sir?\" he echoed. Then, shaking his head, \"No, sir. There's no Colonel Welsh here. My orders are to take you to Major Barber. Follow me, please.\"  The two flying aces exchanged looks, shrugged, and then followed the Sergeant up the stairs. On the landing of the third floor the Sergeant turned right along a hallway and finally came to a stop in front of the fifth door down on the right. He motioned politely for Dave and Freddy to wait, then knocked and went inside.  \"I don't think I like this, Dave!\" Freddy whispered when they were left alone. \"You heard him say that Colonel Welsh wasn't here. What the devil do you suppose is up?\"  \"Your guess is as good as mine,\" Dawson replied with a scowl. \"I'm beginning to suspect, though, that it's something very hush-hush. I still wish I hadn't left my service gun in the hotel. Here, Freddy. I'm probably acting silly, but you never can tell.\"  As Dave spoke the last he fished out one of the Commando knives and slipped it into Freddy Farmer's hand. The English youth took it without a word and let it slide into his pocket out of sight.  \"Think we're foolish to wait here, Dave?\" he breathed a moment later. \"After what's happened tonight, we may be simply asking for more trouble. It's certainly a mixed up mess.\"  \"Plenty screwy,\" Dave grunted with a nod. \"But I'm a curious cuss. And I'm just sore enough to follow this whole cockeyed business through to the end. But keep on guard, Freddy. Back to back, pal, and so forth.\"  \"Quite!\" Freddy grated, and hunched his shoulders as though to get himself set to spring at a split second's notice.  Another minute, and the door opened and the Sergeant reappeared. He pulled the door wide, stood to one side and motioned for the two air aces to enter. They stepped through into a plainly furnished outer office. The Sergeant closed the door, walked past them and opened a door on the right.  \"In there, sirs,\" he said. \"Major Barber is waiting.\"  \"And just who is Major Barber?\" Freddy Farmer demanded, and didn't move.  The Sergeant started to grin but cut it off instantly.  \"He'll tell you, sir,\" he said. \"Go in, please.\"  The two youths hesitated a fraction of a second longer; then by mutual accord they stepped through the second door and into a smaller office. It contained a desk, a few chairs, a filing cabinet or two, and a lone picture of President Roosevelt on the wall. Seated at the desk was an iron gray-haired Major in the uniform of infantry staff. He smiled and rose from his chair as they entered.  \"Evening, Captains Dawson and Farmer,\" he said, and extended his hand. \"Glad to see you here. Sit down, both of you.\"  The two youths shook hands with him, and then settled themselves in chairs."]]]
