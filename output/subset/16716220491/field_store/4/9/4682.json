Throughout the _Vita Nuova_ there is a strain like the first falling murmur which reaches the ear in some remote meadow, and prepares us to look upon the sea.  Boccaccio, in his Life of Dante, tells us that the great poet, in later life, was ashamed of this work of his youth. Such a statement hardly seems reconcilable with the allusions to it made or implied in the _Commedia_; but it is true that the _Vita Nuova_ is a book which only youth could have produced, and which must chiefly remain sacred to the young; to each of whom the figure of Beatrice, less lifelike than lovelike, will seem the friend of his own heart. Nor is this, perhaps, its least praise. To tax its author with effeminacy on account of the extreme sensitiveness evinced by this narrative of his love, would be manifestly unjust, when we find that, though love alone is the theme of the _Vita Nuova_, war already ranked among its author’s experiences at the period to which it relates. In the year 1289, the one preceding the death of Beatrice, Dante served with the foremost cavalry in the great battle of Campaldino, on the eleventh of June, when the Florentines defeated the people of Arezzo. In the autumn of the next year, 1290, when for him, by the death of Beatrice, the city as he says “sat solitary,” such refuge as he might find from his grief was sought in action and danger: for we learn from the _Commedia_ (Hell, C. xxi.) that he served in the war then waged by Florence upon Pisa, and was present at the surrender of Caprona. He says, using the reminiscence to give life to a description, in his great way:—      “I’ve seen the troops out of Caprona go       On terms, affrighted thus, when on the spot     They found themselves with foemen compass’d so.”                                           (CAYLEY’S _Translation_.)  A word should be said here of the title of Dante’s autobiography. The adjective _Nuovo_, _nuova_, or _Novello_, _novella_, literally _New_, is often used by Dante and other early writers in the sense of _young_. This has induced some editors of the _Vita Nuova_ to explain the title as meaning _Early Life_. I should be glad on some accounts to adopt this supposition, as everything is a gain which increases clearness to the modern reader; but on consideration I think the more mystical interpretation of the words, as _New Life_ (in reference to that revulsion of his being which Dante so minutely describes as having occurred simultaneously with his first sight of Beatrice), appears the primary one, and therefore the most necessary to be given in a translation. The probability may be that both were meant, but this I cannot convey.[3]    [3] I must hazard here (to relieve the first page of my translation        from a long note) a suggestion as to the meaning of the most        puzzling passage in the whole _Vita Nuova_,—that sentence        just at the outset which says, “La gloriosa donna della mia        mente, la quale fù chiamata da molti Beatrice, i quali non        sapeano che si chiamare.” On this passage all the commentators        seem helpless, turning it about and sometimes adopting        alterations not to be found in any ancient manuscript of the        work. The words mean literally, “The glorious lady of my        mind who was called Beatrice by many who knew not how she        was called.” This presents the obvious difficulty that the        lady’s name really _was_ Beatrice, and that Dante throughout        uses that name himself. In the text of my version I have        adopted, as a rendering, the one of the various compromises        which seemed to give the most beauty to the meaning. But        it occurs to me that a less irrational escape out of the        difficulty than any I have seen suggested may possibly be        found by linking this passage with the close of the sonnet        at page 104 of the _Vita Nuova_, beginning, “I felt a spirit        of love begin to stir,” in the last line of which sonnet        Love is made to assert that the name of Beatrice is _Love_.        Dante appears to have dwelt on this fancy with some pleasure,        from what is said in an earlier sonnet (page 39) about “Love        in his proper form” (by which Beatrice seems to be meant)        bending over a dead lady. And it is in connection with the        sonnet where the name of Beatrice is said to be Love, that        Dante, as if to show us that the Love he speaks of is only        his own emotion, enters into an argument as to Love being        merely an accident in substance,—in other words, “Amore e il        cor gentil son una cosa.” This conjecture may be pronounced        extravagant; but the _Vita Nuova_, when examined, proves so        full of intricate and fantastic analogies, even in the mere        arrangement of its parts, (much more than appears on any but        the closest scrutiny,) that it seems admissible to suggest        even a whimsical solution of a difficulty which remains        unconquered. Or to have recourse to the much more welcome        means of solution afforded by simple inherent beauty: may not        the meaning be merely that any person looking on so noble        and lovely a creation, without knowledge of her name, must        have spontaneously called her Beatrice,—_i.e._, the giver        of blessing? This would be analogous by antithesis to the        translation I have adopted in my text.     DANTE ALIGHIERI     THE NEW LIFE.  (LA VITA NUOVA.)   In that part of the book of my memory before the which is little that can be read, there is a rubric, saying, _Incipit Vita Nova_.[4] Under such rubric I find written many things; and among them the words which I purpose to copy into this little book; if not all of them, at the least their substance.    [4] “Here beginneth the new life.”  Nine times already since my birth had the heaven of light returned to the selfsame point almost, as concerns its own revolution, when first the glorious Lady of my mind was made manifest to mine eyes; even she who was called Beatrice by many who knew not wherefore.[5] She had already been in this life for so long as that, within her time, the starry heaven had moved towards the Eastern quarter one of the twelve parts of a degree; so that she appeared to me at the beginning of her ninth year almost, and I saw her almost at the end of my ninth year. Her dress, on that day, was of a most noble colour, a subdued and goodly crimson, girdled and adorned in such sort as best suited with her very tender age. At that moment, I say most truly that the spirit of life, which hath its dwelling in the secretest chamber of the heart, began to tremble so violently that the least pulses of my body shook therewith; and in trembling it said these words: _Ecce deus fortior me, qui veniens dominabitur mihi._[6] At that moment the animate spirit, which dwelleth in the lofty chamber whither all the senses carry their perceptions, was filled with wonder, and speaking more especially unto the spirits of the eyes, said these words: _Apparuit jam beatitudo vestra._[7] At that moment the natural spirit, which dwelleth there where our nourishment is administered, began to weep, and in weeping said these words: _Heu miser! quia frequenter impeditus ero deinceps._[8]    [5] In reference to the meaning of the name, “She who confers        blessing.” We learn from Boccaccio that this first meeting        took place at a May Feast, given in the year 1274 by Folco        Portinari, father of Beatrice, who ranked among the principal        citizens of Florence: to which feast Dante accompanied his        father, Alighiero Alighieri.    [6] “Here is a deity stronger than I; who, coming, shall rule over        me.”    [7] “Your beatitude hath now been made manifest unto you.”    [8] “Woe is me! for that often I shall be disturbed from this time        forth!”  I say that, from that time forward, Love quite governed my soul; which was immediately espoused to him, and with so safe and undisputed a lordship (by virtue of strong imagination) that I had nothing left for it but to do all his bidding continually. He oftentimes commanded me to seek if I might see this youngest of the Angels: wherefore I in my boyhood often went in search of her, and found her so noble and praiseworthy that certainly of her might have been said those words of the poet Homer, “She seemed not to be the daughter of a mortal man, but of God.”[9] And albeit her image, that was with me always, was an exultation of Love to subdue me, it was yet of so perfect a quality that it never allowed me to be overruled by Love without the faithful counsel of reason, whensoever such counsel was useful to be heard. But seeing that were I to dwell overmuch on the passions and doings of such early youth, my words might be counted something fabulous, I will therefore put them aside; and passing many things that may be conceived by the pattern of these, I will come to such as are writ in my memory with a better distinctness.    [9]                                 Οὐδὲ ἐῴκει         Ἀνδρός γε θνητοῦ παῖς ἔμμεναι, ἀλλὰ θεοῖο.                                             (_Iliad_, xxiv. 258.)  After the lapse of so many days that nine years exactly were completed since the above-written appearance of this most gracious being, on the last of those days it happened that the same wonderful lady appeared to me dressed all in pure white, between two gentle ladies elder than she. And passing through a street, she turned her eyes thither where I stood sorely abashed: and by her unspeakable courtesy, which is now guerdoned in the Great Cycle, she saluted me with so virtuous a bearing that I seemed then and there to behold the very limits of blessedness. The hour of her most sweet salutation was exactly the ninth of that day; and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41085"],["title","The New Life (La Vita Nuova) (#2)"],["body","it was the first time that any words from her reached mine ears, I came into such sweetness that I parted thence as one intoxicated. And betaking me to the loneliness of mine own room, I fell to thinking of this most courteous lady, thinking of whom I was overtaken by a pleasant slumber, wherein a marvellous vision was presented to me: for there appeared to be in my room a mist of the colour of fire, within the which I discerned the figure of a lord of terrible aspect to such as should gaze upon him, but who seemed therewithal to rejoice inwardly that it was a marvel to see. Speaking he said many things, among the which I could understand but few; and of these, this: _Ego dominus tuus._[10] In his arms it seemed to me that a person was sleeping, covered only with a blood-coloured cloth; upon whom looking very attentively, I knew that it was the lady of the salutation who had deigned the day before to salute me. And he who held her held also in his hand a thing that was burning in flames; and he said to me, _Vide cor tuum_.[11] But when he had remained with me a little while, I thought that he set himself to awaken her that slept; after the which he made her to eat that thing which flamed in his hand; and she ate as one fearing. Then, having waited again a space, all his joy was turned into most bitter weeping; and as he wept he gathered the lady into his arms, and it seemed to me that he went with her up towards heaven: whereby such a great anguish came upon me that my light slumber could not endure through it, but was suddenly broken. And immediately having considered, I knew that the hour wherein this vision had been made manifest to me was the fourth hour (which is to say, the first of the nine last hours) of the night.    [10] “I am thy master.”    [11] “Behold thy heart.”  Then, musing on what I had seen, I proposed to relate the same to many poets who were famous in that day: and for that I had myself in some sort the art of discoursing with rhyme, I resolved on making a sonnet, in the which, having saluted all such as are subject unto Love, and entreated them to expound my vision, I should write unto them those things which I had seen in my sleep. And the sonnet I made was this:—      To every heart which the sweet pain doth move,       And unto which these words may now be brought       For true interpretation and kind thought,     Be greeting in our Lord’s name, which is Love.     Of those long hours wherein the stars, above,       Wake and keep watch, the third was almost nought,       When Love was shown me with such terrors fraught     As may not carelessly be spoken of.     He seemed like one who is full of joy, and had       My heart within his hand, and on his arm         My lady, with a mantle round her, slept;     Whom (having wakened her) anon he made       To eat that heart; she ate, as fearing harm.         Then he went out; and as he went, he wept.  _This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first part I give greeting, and ask an answer; in the second, I signify what thing has to be answered to. The second part commences here: “Of those long hours.”_  To this sonnet I received many answers, conveying many different opinions; of the which one was sent by him whom I now call the first among my friends, and it began thus, “Unto my thinking thou beheld’st all worth.”[12] And indeed, it was when he learned that I was he who had sent those rhymes to him, that our friendship commenced. But the true meaning of that vision was not then perceived by any one, though it be now evident to the least skilful.    [12] The friend of whom Dante here speaks was Guido Cavalcanti.  From that night forth, the natural functions of my body began to be vexed and impeded, for I was given up wholly to thinking of this most gracious creature: whereby in short space I became so weak and so reduced that it was irksome to many of my friends to look upon me; while others, being moved by spite, went about to discover what it was my wish should be concealed. Wherefore I (perceiving the drift of their unkindly questions), by Love’s will, who directed me according to the counsels of reason, told them how it was Love himself who had thus dealt with me: and I said so, because the thing was so plainly to be discerned in my countenance that there was no longer any means of concealing it. But when they went on to ask, “And by whose help hath Love done this?” I looked in their faces smiling, and spake no word in return.  Now it fell on a day, that this most gracious creature was sitting where words were to be heard of the Queen of Glory;[13] and I was in a place whence mine eyes could behold their beatitude: and betwixt her and me, in a direct line, there sat another lady of a pleasant favour; who looked round at me many times, marvelling at my continued gaze which seemed to have _her_ for its object. And many perceived that she thus looked; so that departing thence, I heard it whispered after me, “Look you to what a pass _such a lady_ hath brought him;” and in saying this they named her who had been midway between the most gentle Beatrice and mine eyes. Therefore I was reassured, and knew that for that day my secret had not become manifest. Then immediately it came into my mind that I might make use of this lady as a screen to the truth: and so well did I play my part that the most of those who had hitherto watched and wondered at me, now imagined they had found me out. By her means I kept my secret concealed till some years were gone over; and for my better security, I even made divers rhymes in her honour; whereof I shall here write only as much as concerneth the most gentle Beatrice, which is but a very little. Moreover, about the same time while this lady was a screen for so much love on my part, I took the resolution to set down the name of this most gracious creature accompanied with many other women’s names, and especially with hers whom I spake of. And to this end I put together the names of sixty of the most beautiful ladies in that city where God had placed mine own lady; and these names I introduced in an epistle in the form of a _sirvent_, which it is not my intention to transcribe here. Neither should I have said anything of this matter, did I not wish to take note of a certain strange thing, to wit: that having written the list, I found my lady’s name would not stand otherwise than ninth in order among the names of these ladies.    [13] _i.e._, in a church.  Now it so chanced with her by whose means I had thus long time concealed my desire, that it behoved her to leave the city I speak of, and to journey afar: wherefore I, being sorely perplexed at the loss of so excellent a defence, had more trouble than even I could before have supposed. And thinking that if I spoke not somewhat mournfully of her departure, my former counterfeiting would be the more quickly perceived, I determined that I would make a grievous sonnet[14] thereof; the which I will write here, because it hath certain words in it whereof my lady was the immediate cause, as will be plain to him that understands.    [14] It will be observed that this poem is not what we now call a        sonnet. Its structure, however, is analogous to that of the        sonnet, being two sextetts followed by two quatrains, instead        of two quatrains followed by two triplets. Dante applies the        term sonnet to both these forms of composition, and to no        other.  And the sonnet was this:—      All ye that pass along Love’s trodden way,     Pause ye awhile and say       If there be any grief like unto mine:     I pray you that you hearken a short space     Patiently, if my case       Be not a piteous marvel and a sign.      Love (never, certes, for my worthless part,     But of his own great heart,)       Vouchsafed to me a life so calm and sweet     That oft I heard folk question as I went     What such great gladness meant:—       They spoke of it behind me in the street.      But now that fearless bearing is all gone       Which with Love’s hoarded wealth was given me;       Till I am grown to be     So poor that I have dread to think thereon.     And thus it is that I, being like as one       Who is ashamed and hides his poverty,       Without seem full of glee,     And let my heart within travail and moan.  _This poem has two principal parts; for, in the first, I mean to call the Faithful of Love in those words of Jeremias the Prophet_, “O vos omnes qui transitis per viam, attendite et videte si est dolor sicut dolor meus,” _and to pray them to stay and hear me. In the second I tell where Love had placed me, with a meaning other than that which the last part of the poem shows, and I say what I have lost. The second part begins here, “Love, (never, certes).”_  A certain while after the departure of that lady, it pleased the Master of the Angels to call into His glory a damsel, young and of a gentle presence, who had been very lovely in the city I speak of: and I saw her body lying without its soul among many ladies, who held a pitiful weeping. Whereupon, remembering that I had seen her in the company of excellent Beatrice, I could not hinder myself from a few tears; and weeping, I conceived to say somewhat of her death, in guerdon of having seen her somewhile with my lady; which thing I spake of in the latter end of the verses that I writ in this matter, as he will discern who understands. And I wrote two sonnets, which are these:—   I.      Weep, Lovers, sith Love’s very self doth weep,       And sith the cause for weeping is so great;       When now so many dames, of such estate     In worth, show with their eyes a grief so deep:     For Death the churl has laid his leaden sleep       Upon a damsel who was fair of late,       Defacing all our earth should celebrate,—     Yea all save virtue, which the soul doth keep.     Now hearken how much Love did honour her.       I myself saw him in his proper form         Bending above the motionless"]]]
