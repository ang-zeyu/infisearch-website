Many a \"white man\" had been slain near the spot but somehow the swan seemed a mystical being, and invulnerable.  It was a relic of the days of peace, and a sign of the survival of purity and grace amid the horrors and cruelties of war.  It spoke of the sacred things that yet remain--the beautiful things of the soul upon which war can lay no defiling finger. Now it had gone from the water and Ypres seems more charred than ever, and the war more terrible.  The death of the swan revealed against its white wings the peculiar inhumanity of the present war.  It is a war in which the enemy spares nothing and no one.  He is more blind and merciless than the Angel of Death which swept over Egypt, for the angel had regard to the blood which the Israelites had sprinkled over the lintels of their doors and he passed by in mercy.  To the German Eagle every living creature is legitimate prey.  No blood upon the lintel can save the inmate; not even the cross of blood on the hospital tent or ship.  Wounded or whole, combatant or non-combatant, its beak and talons tear the tender flesh of all and its lust is not sated.  In Belgium and Serbia it is believed that more women and children perished than men. Things too hideous for words were done publicly in the market-squares.  Neither age nor sex escaped fire and sword.  The innocent babe was left to suck the breast of its dead mother or was dandled on the point of the bayonet. What resistance can the Belgian swan make to the German eagle?  It needs must lie torn and bleeding beneath its talons.  The German Emperor has waded deeper in blood than Macbeth, and has slain the innocent in their sleep.  Even the sea is full of the women, children, and non-combatant men he has drowned.  His crown is cemented together with innocent blood and its jewels are the eyes of murdered men and women.  The wretched man has made rivers of blood to flow yet not a drop in them is from his own veins or the veins of his many sons.  Napoleon risked his life with his men in every battle but this man never once.  While sending millions to their death he yet consents to live, and protects his life with the anxious care a miser bestows on his gold.  Alone among large families in Germany his household is without a casualty. Though a nation be white and innocent as the Belgian swan it will not escape his sword, and he will swoop upon it the more readily because it is unarmed.  The swan cannot live where the eagle flies, and one or the other must die.  But the stricken swan of Ypres is not merely the symbol of Belgium and her fate.  There are other innocents who have perished or been sorely wounded.  The whole creation is groaning and travailing in pain.  The neutral nations are suffering with the belligerent, and the lower creatures are suffering with mankind.  Next to seeing wounded men on the roads at the front, I think the saddest sight is that of dying horses and mules.  Last winter they had to stand, with little cover, exposed to the bitter blasts.  It was impossible to keep them clean or dry, for the roads were churned into liquid mud and both mules and drivers were plastered with it from head to foot.  To make things worse there was a shortage of fodder; and horses waste away rapidly under ill-feeding. Before the fine weather had given them a chance to recover weight and strength, the Battle of Arras began, and every living beast of burden, as well as every motor-engine, was strained to its utmost.  The mule is magnificent for war, and our battles have been won as much by mules as men.  Haig could rely on one as much as on the other.  The mule will eat anything, endure anything, and, when understood and humored by its driver, will do anything.  It works until it falls dead by the roadside.  In the spring, hundreds died in harness.  In fact, few die except in harness.  They die facing the foe, dragging rations along shell-swept roads to the men in the trenches.  On two miles of road I have counted a dozen dead mules; and burial parties are sent out to put them out of sight.  One night, alone, I got three dying mules shot.  The road was crowded with traffic, yet it was difficult to find either an officer with a revolver or a transport-driver with a rifle.  I had to approach scores before I could find a man who had the means to put a mule out of its misery; and we were within two miles of our Front.  So rigid is our line of defense that those behind it do not trouble to take arms.  Even when I found a rifleman he hesitated to shoot a mule.  There is a rule that no horse or mule must be shot without proper authority, and when you consider the enormous cost of one the necessity for the rule is obvious. I had therefore to assure a rifleman that I would take full responsibility for his action. He then loaded up, put the nozzle against the mule’s forehead and pulled the trigger.  A tremor passed through the poor thing’s body and its troubles were over.  It had come all the way from South America to wear itself out carrying food to fighting men, and it died by the road when its last ounce of strength was spent.  The mule knows neither love nor offspring. Apart from a few gambols in the field, or while tethered to the horse-lines, it knows nothing but work.  It is the supreme type of the drudge.  It is one of the greatest factors in the war, and yet it receives scarcely any recognition and more of whipping than of praise.  Only too often I have seen their poor shell-mangled bodies lying by the roadside waiting till the battle allowed time for their burial.  Yet what could be more innocent of any responsibility for the war?  They are as innocent as the swan on the moat at Ypres.  Yet the greatest suffering among innocents is not found at the Front at all.  It is found at home.  At the Front there is suffering of body and mind, but at home there is the suffering of the heart.  Every soldier knows that his mother and wife suffer more than he does, and he pities them from his soul.  War is a cross on which Woman is crucified.  The soldier dies of his wounds in the morning of life, but his wife lingers on in pain through the long garish day until the evening shadows fall. There is no laughter at home such as you hear at the Front, or even in the hospitals.  One finds a gayety among the regiments in France such as is unknown among the people left at home.  It is the sunshine of the street as compared with the light in a shaded room.  There is a youth and buoyancy at the Front that one misses sadly in the homeland.  To a true woman with a son or husband at the Front, life becomes a nightmare.  To her distorted imagination the most important man in the country is not the Prime Minister but the postman.  She cannot get on with her breakfast for listening for his footsteps.  There is no need for him to knock at the door, she has heard him open the gate and walk up the gravel path.  Her heart is tossed like a bubble on the winds of hope and fear.  She finds herself behind the door without knowing how she got there, and her hand trembles as she picks up the letter to see if the address is in \"his\" handwriting or an official’s.  The words, \"On His Majesty’s Service,\" she dreads like a witch’s incantation.  They may be innocent enough, and cover nothing more than belated Commission Papers, but she trembles lest they should be but the fair face of a dark-hearted messenger, who is to blot out the light of her life forever.  If she goes out shopping and sees a telegraph-boy go in the direction of her home she forgets her purchases and hurries back to see if he is going to knock at her door.  The rosy-faced messenger has become a sinister figure, an imp from the nether world.  He may be bringing news of her loved one’s arrival \"on leave,\" but so many evil faces of fear and doubt peer through the windows of her heart that she cannot believe in the innocence and good-will of the whistling boy.  Her whole world is wrapped up in his little orange-colored envelope.  The boys at the Front know of the anxiety and suspense that darken their homes, and they do all they can to lighten them.  There were times on the Somme when the men were utterly exhausted with fighting and long vigils in the trenches.  Water was scarce, and a mild dysentery came into evidence.  No fire could be lighted to cook food or make hot tea. The ranks had been thinned, and only two officers were left to each company.  The weather was bad and the captured trench uncomfortable. Any moment word might come for another attack.  The campaign was near its close, and the work must be completed despite the prevalent exhaustion. The officers were too tired, depressed and preoccupied to censor hundreds of letters.  In front of him each could see a gaping grave. The sun was rapidly \"going west\" and leaving them to the cold and dark. Nothing seemed to matter in comparison with _that_. To hold services were impossible and I felt that the best I could do was to walk through the trench, chat with the officers and men, gather up the men’s letters and take them back and censor in my tent.  This gave the officers times to write their own, and an opportunity to post them.  But note, I pray you, the nobility of these gallant fellows.  All of them were exhausted and depressed.  The shadows of death were thick about them, yet when I opened their letters, I found myself--with two exceptions out of three or four hundred--in an entirely different atmosphere.  It was a sunny atmosphere in which birds were singing.  The men said nothing of their suffering, their depression, their fears for the future.  The black wings of death cast no shadow over their pages. They said they were \"all right,\" \"merry and bright\" and \"soon going back for a long rest.\"  They told their mothers what kind of cigarettes to send, and gave them details how to make up the next parcel.  They talked as if death were out of sight--a sinister fellow with whom they had nothing to do.  The officers, of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46323"],["title","The Soul of the Soldier: Sketches from the Western Battle-Front (#2)"],["body","course, censor their own letters, so I did not see how they wrote.  But I know.  They wrote as the men wrote, and probably with a still lighter touch.  Their homes were dark enough with anxiety, yet not by any word of theirs would the shadows be deepened.  They could not shield themselves from war’s horrors but they would do their best to shield their white swans at home.  They could not keep their women folk out of the war, but they would deliver them from its worst horrors.  Not till they had fallen would they let the shafts pass them to their mothers and wives; rather would they gather them in their own breasts. In the hour of the world’s supreme tragedy there was a woman standing by the cross, and the august Sufferer, with dying breath, bade His closest friend take her, when the last beam faded, to his own home and be in His place, a son to her.  I know no scene that better represents the feelings of our soldiers towards their loved ones at home.  Their women gave them inspiration and joy in the days of peace, and they still float before their vision amid the blackened ruins of war, as beautiful and stainless in their purity as the white swan on the moat of Ypres.                                       *II*                              *THE ROADMAKERS*   We had just marched from one part of the Front to another and by a round-about way.  Each morning the Quartermaster and \"the billeting party\" went on before, and each evening we slept in a village that was strange to us.  Each of the men carried on his back a pack and equipment weighing about eighty or ninety pounds. Through sleet and blizzard and, for the most part, through open, exposed country, we continued our march without a day of rest.  By the fifth evening we reached the village where we were to have three or four weeks of rest and training before entering the trenches for the spring offensive.  We had unpacked and were sitting at dinner when a telegram came announcing that all previous plans were canceled, and that at dawn we must take to the road again. Something unexpected had happened, good or ill, we knew not which, and we had to enter the line in front of Arras. For three days more we marched.  Daily the sound of the guns came nearer, and the men were tired and footsore.  They were also deeply disappointed of the long rest to which they had been looking forward after a winter in the trenches at Neuve Chapelle.  Yet they marched cheerily enough.  \"It’s the War!\" they said one to another and, true to their own philosophy, \"packed up their troubles in their old kit bags and smiled.\"  When any man faltered a bit, as if about to fall out by the way, the others cheered him on by singing \"Old Soldiers never die\" to the tune of the old Sunday school hymn, \"Kind words can never die.\"  Sometimes an officer would shoulder a man’s rifle to the end of the march, or until he felt better.  In eight unbroken days of marching we covered ninety-eight miles and finally arrived at a camp of huts within a day’s march of the trenches we are to occupy.  Here, where our huts stand like islands in a sea of mud, we are, unless suddenly needed, to take a few days’ rest.  On the ninety-eight miles of road over which we tramped, we passed company after company of British roadmakers.  In some parts they were widening the road, in other parts repairing it.  The roads of Northeastern France are handed over to our care as completely as if they were in England.  Our road-makers are everywhere, and as we pass they stand, pick or shovel in hand, to salute the colonel and shout some humorous remark to the laughing riflemen--only to get back as much as they give.  This morning I visited the neighboring village to arrange for a Sunday service.  The roads are hopeless for bicycles at this time of the year, so I fell back on Adam’s method of getting about.  The road to the village was torn and broken, and \"thaw precautions\" were being observed. Everywhere it was ankle-deep in mud and, in the holes, knee-deep. Innumerable motor-wagons had crushed it beneath their ponderous weight, and my feet had need of my eyes to guide them.  In skirting the holes and rough places, I added quite a mile to the journey.  It was annoying to get along so slowly, and I called the road \"rotten\" and blamed the War for its destructive work.  Then I saw that I had been unjust in judgment.  The War had constructed more than it had destroyed. The road had been a little muddy country lane, but the soldiers had made it wide as Fleet Street, and it was bearing a mightier traffic than that famous thoroughfare night and day.  The little road with its mean perfections and imperfections had gone, and the large road with big faults and big virtues had come.  This soldiers’ road has faults the farmers’ road knew not, but then it has burdens and duties unknown before, and it has had no time to prepare for them.  Like our boy-officers who are bearing grown men’s burdens of responsibility and bearing them well, the road has had no time to harden.  To strengthen itself for its duties, it eats up stones as a giant eats up food.  I had no right to look for the smoothness of Oxford Street or the Strand. Such avenues represent the work of centuries, this of days.  They have grown with their burdens, but this has had vast burdens thrown upon it suddenly, and while it was immature.  Oxford Street and Fleet Street are the roads of peace, and laden with wealth and luxury, law and literature--things that can wait.  But on this road of the soldiers’ making, nothing is allowed except it be concerned with matters of life and death.  It is the road of war, and there is a terrible urgency about it.  Over it pass ammunition to the guns, rations to the soldiers in the trenches, ambulances bearing back the wounded to the hospital.  Whatever its conditions the work must be done, and there is no room for a halting prudence or the pride of appearance.  Rough though it is and muddy, over it is passing, for all who have eyes to see, a new and better civilization and a wider liberty.  I had grumbled at the worn-out road when I ought to have praised it.  I was as an ingrate who finds fault with his father’s hands because they are rough and horny.  It was a group of soldier-roadmakers who brought me to my senses.  They were making a new road through the fields, and it branched off from the one I was on.  I saw its crude beginning and considered the burdens it would soon have to bear.  As I stood watching these English roadmakers my mind wandered down the avenues of time, and I saw the Roman soldiers building their immortal roads through England.  They were joining town to town and country to country.  They were introducing the people of the North to those of the South, and bringing the East into fellowship with the West.  I saw come along their roads the union of all England followed at, some distance, by that of England, Scotland and Wales; and I regretted that there was no foundation on which they could build a road to Ireland. I saw on those soldier-built roads, also, Christianity and Civilization marching, and in the villages and towns by the wayside they found a home whence they have sent out missionaries and teachers to the ends of the earth.  \"The captains and the kings depart.\"  The Roman Empire is no more, but the Roman roads remain.  They direct our modern life and business with an inevitability the Roman soldiers never exercised.  In two thousand years the Empire may have fallen apart and become a thing of the past; but the roads her sons have built in France, these two-and-a-half years, will abide forever and be a perpetual blessing; for, of things made by hands, there is, after the church and the home, nothing more sacred than the road.  The roadmaker does more for the brotherhood of man and the federation of the world than the most eloquent orator.  The roadmaker has his dreams and visions as well as the poet, and he expresses them in broken stones.  He uses stones as artists use colors, and orators words. He touches them--transient as they are--with immortality.  A little of his soul sticks to each stone he uses, and though the stone perishes the road remains.  His body may perish more quickly than the stones and be laid in some quiet churchyard by the wayside, but his soul will never utterly forsake the road he helped to make.  In man’s nature, and in all his works, there is a strange blending of the temporal and the eternal, and in nothing is it more marked than in the roads he builds.  The roadmaker is the pioneer among men and without him there would be neither artist nor orator.  He goes before civilization as John the Baptist went before Christ, and he is as rough and elemental.  Hard as his own stones, without him mankind would have remained savage and suspicious as beasts of prey; and art, science and literature would have had no beginning.  His road may begin in war, but it ends in peace.  The pioneers I saw roadmaking were, for the greater part, over military age, and such as I had often seen leaning heavily on the bar of some miserable beer-house.  In those days they seemed of the earth, earthy, and the stars that lure to high thoughts and noble endeavors seemed to shine on them in vain.  But one never knows what is passing in the heart of another.  Of all things human nature is the most mysterious and deceptive.  God seems to play at hide-and-seek with men.  He hides pearls in oysters lying in the ooze of the sea; and gold under the everlasting snows of the Arctic regions.  Diamonds he buries deep down in the dirt beneath the African veldt.  He places Christ in a carpenter’s shop, Joan of Arc in a peasant’s dwelling, Lincoln in a settler’s cabin, and Burns in a crude cottage built by his father’s own hands.  He hides generous impulses and heroic traits in types of men that in our mean imaginations we can only associate with the saw-dust sprinkled bar-room. Only when war or pestilence have kindled their fierce and lurid "]]]
