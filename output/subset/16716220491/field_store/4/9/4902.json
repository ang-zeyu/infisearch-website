This condition of apostasy is that pictured by Isaiah:      \"The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because     they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the     everlasting covenant.\" (Isaiah 24:5.)  And by Amos, in his fateful utterance:      \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a     famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,     but of hearing the words of the Lord: And they shall wander from     sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to     and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.\" (Amos     8:11, 12.)  The certainty of a general declension in spirituality among men, the rise of false Christs and false prophets, of mystic and deceiving voices from the desert and from secret chambers was foretold by the Christ Himself (Matt. 24:4-5, 10, 13, 25-26). So avowed also the Apostles Peter (2 Peter 2:1-3), and Paul (Acts 20:29-30, 1 Tim. 4:1-3, 2 Tim. 4:1-4, 2 Thess. 2:3-4), Jude (17, 18), and John (Rev. 13:4, 6-9).  The apostate condition of Christendom has been recognized and affirmed by high ecclesiastical authority Let a single citation suffice. The Church of England thus proclaims the fact of degeneracy, as set forth in her \"Homily against Peril of Idolatry,\" published about the middle of the sixteenth century and retained to this day as an official declaration:      \"So that laity and clergy, learned and unlearned, all ages, sects,     and degrees of men, women, and children of whole Christendom an     horrible and most dreadful thing to think have been at once drowned     in abominable idolatry; of all other vices most detested of God,     and most damnable to man; and that by the space of eight hundred     years and more.\"  No less definite than the prophecy of apostasy is the scriptural prediction of a restoration in the last days:      \"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the     everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and     to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a     loud voice, Fear God, and give, glory to him; for the hour of his     judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and     the sea, and the fountains of waters.\" (Rev. 14:6-7.)  \"Mormonism\" affirms that the \"everlasting Gospel\" has been restored to earth in the manner specified, that is by angelic ministration. The necessity of a restoration postulates the prior removal of the thing restored; and the restoration of the Gospel is proof of the precedent apostasy of mankind. But, it may be asked, had not we the Holy Bible, the scriptural repository of the Gospel record? The letter, yes. But surely the Gospel is more than a book. The Holy Bible prescribes administrative ordinances as essential to salvation baptism by water and the bestowal of the Holy Ghost by the authoritative imposition of hands, the rebirth of water and of the Spirit, without which, unless the Lord Christ spoke to Nicodemus falsely, no man can enter the kingdom of God. Who will venture to affirm that a possession of a copy of the Holy Bible, or even a letter-perfect memorization of the contents thereof, can give to men the right to administer in the ordinances therein prescribed?  The angel seen by the Revelator while on Patmos was to restore not the letter of requirement as to baptism and other essentials, for this the world had; but he was to bring again to earth the commission to officiate in those saving ordinances, that is, to restore the authority of the Holy Priesthood.  \"Mormonism\" affirms that on the 15th of May, 1829, a heavenly messenger descended in light and glory, and, laying his hands upon Joseph Smith and his companion in the ministry, Oliver Cowdery, bestowed upon them the Lesser or Aaronic Priesthood, saying:      \"Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer     the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering     of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by     immersion for the remission of sins.\"  The angelic personage announced himself as John, known of old as the Baptist, and declared that he acted under instructions from Peter, James, and John, who held the presidency of the Higher or Melchizedek Priesthood in the apostolic dispensation of old. At a later date Joseph Smith and his fellow laborer were visited by Peter, James, and John, who ordained the two to the Priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, which comprises all the authority operative in the Church of Jesus Christ.  Whatever criticism may be offered, exception taken, or denial asserted against these solemn declarations, the consistency of the claims themselves must be admitted. Authority to officiate in the ordinances of the Gospel was brought by angel messengers, and they the very ones in whom were vested the powers of the respective order of Priesthood in the earlier Gospel dispensation. This same strict consistency appears in subsequent manifestations. Thus Moses appeared in the Temple at Kirtland, Ohio, and conferred the keys of the gathering of the tribes of Israel after their long dispersion, which work is abundantly predicted in ancient scripture as a characteristic feature of the latter days the time immediately precedent to the glorious advent of the Son of Man. Elijah the prophet, in literal fulfilment of Malachi's prediction (Mai. 4:5-6) has brought and committed to the modern prophet the authority of vicarious labor in behalf of the dead, by which the hearts of the departed fathers are turned to their living posterity, and the hearts of the yet mortal children drawn to their progenitors in the spirit world. True to this particular commission, the restored Church rears temples to the name and service of the living God, and in those sacred structures carries forward vicarious service for the redemption of the uncounted dead who have passed away in ignorance as to the necessity of compliance with the laws and ordinances of the Gospel, without which compliance no man may see the kingdom of God.  Such facts as those cited attest the consistency of the distinctive claims of \"Mormonism\"; and consistency goes far to establish genuineness. \"Mormonism\" would long since have gone the way of all false creeds and systems had its precepts been inconsistent, incongruous, or unscriptural.  \"Mormon\" doctrines are characteristically advanced and progressive, and herein lies a further explanation of the virility of the system. While in no respect at variance with earlier scriptures, \"Mormonism\" carries principles forward, and many of the obscure passages of ancient writ are illumined by the rays of modern revelation. As stated, \"Mormonism\" leads the way to higher truths. Now, by way of a few examples as promised:  (A) The unscriptural and repellent dogma of inherent degeneracy and the contaminating effect of original sin, by which every child is born vile in the sight and judgment of God, long cast its dark shadow over the minds of men. From this conception sprang the practise of infant baptism and the perverted doctrine of assured damnation for all innocent babes who die unbaptized. Even the Catholic church has modified its teaching on this subject and today permits its members to believe that children who die without baptism pass to a state of partial happiness and content, though forever denied the supreme blessing of the beatific vision of God. It is conceded, of course, that no dictum, dogma, or doctrine of men can determine the fate of souls, infant or adult, in the hereafter; nevertheless, theological teachings have direct effect upon the thoughts and lives of mankind. It is cheering to know that practically all Christendom today repudiates the frightful heresy of the eternal condemnation of babes who die without baptism.  Hear now the word of \"Mormonism\" on the matter and note the time of its enunciation. In 1830 the Book of Mormon was given to the world. Therein we read, in an epistle of the ancient prophet Mormon to his son Moroni:      \"Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your     God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous, but     sinners to repentance: the whole need no physician, but they that     are sick; wherefore little children are whole, for they are not     capable of committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken     from them in me, that it hath no power over them; and the law of     circumcision is done away in me. And after this manner did the Holy     Ghost manifest the word of God unto me; wherefore my beloved son, I     know that it is solemn mockery before God, that ye should baptize     little children. Behold I say unto you, That this thing shall ye     teach, repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and     capable of committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent     and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little children,     and they shall all be saved with their little children. And their     little children need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold,     baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto     the remission of sins. But little children are alive in Christ,     even from the foundation of the world.\" (Moroni 8:8-12.)  In the revelations of the current dispensation we read that children are accounted innocent before God until they come to the age of understanding and accountability, and that baptism is required of all who have attained that condition. Thus we read:      \"All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be     baptized and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits,     and witness before the church that they have truly repented of all     their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46099"],["title","The Vitality of \"Mormonism\": An Address (#2)"],["body"," Jesus     Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly     manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of     Christ unto the remission of their sins, shall be received by     baptism into his church.\" (Doctrine and Covenants 20:37.)  (B) The one-time general conception of heaven and hell is regarded today as antiquated, unreasonable, unscriptural and untrue. I speak of the heaven and the hell once thought of as the only places or conditions prepared for the souls of men, to one or the other of which states every being that has or shall have tabernacled in the flesh is to be consigned, perhaps on a very narrow margin of merit or desert. True, the support of scriptural warrant was lacking for the churchly dogma; but many centuries were required for the world to discover the fact. Paul, writing to the Corinthians in the long ago, said:      \"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the     glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is     another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the     moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from     another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead.\" (I     Cor. 15:40-42.)  To this portentous scripture a very narrow exposition was accorded in the dogmatic exegesis of the earlier commentaries, and the dictum of a heaven and a hell was scarcely shaken thereby. Belief in graded conditions in the hereafter is widespread today, and in this rational substitution of ennobling truth for degrading error, \"Mormonism\" is again the world's teacher. Joseph Smith avowed that in February 1832 he received a Divine revelation, in which conditions in the hereafter were shown to be the direct result of the individual life in mortality, and by which the existence of distinct kingdoms of glory, each with its own numerous gradations, was made plain. These are called in descending order the Celestial, the Terrestrial and the Telestial. Far below the lowest of these is the state prepared for the hopelessly unregenerate, those who have sinned against light and knowledge, those who, having learned the laws of righteousness and having received the testimony of the Christ have ruthlessly trodden the priceless pearls into the mire, those few who are fit companions for the devil and his angels throughout eternity, those who are known by the awful name \"sons of perdition.\" Of them the revelation last referred to avers:      \"Thus saith the Lord, concerning all those who know my power, and     have been made partakers thereof, and suffered themselves, through     the power of the devil, to be overcome, and to deny the truth and     defy my power They are they who are the sons of perdition, of whom     I say that it had been better for them never to have been born,     For they are vessels of wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath of God,     with the devil and his angels in eternity; Concerning whom I have     said there is no forgiveness in this world nor in the world to     come, Having denied the Holy Spirit after having received it, and     having denied the Only Begotten Son of the Father having crucified     him unto themselves, and put him to an open shame. These are they     who shall go away into the lake of fire and brimstone, with the     devil and his angels, And the only ones on whom the second death     shall have any power; Yea, verily, the only ones who shall not be     redeemed in the due time of the Lord, after the sufferings of his     wrath.\" (Doctrine and Covenants 76:31-38.)  In immeasurable contrast is the state of those who attain not only salvation but exaltation in the Celestial kingdom. We read:      \"They are they who received the testimony of Jesus, and believed     on his name and were baptized after the manner of his burial,     being buried in the water in his name, and this according to the     commandment which he has given, That by keeping the commandments     they might be washed and cleansed from all their sins, and receive     the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands of him who is     ordained and sealed unto this power. And who overcome by faith, and     are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds     forth upon all those who are just and true. They are they who are     the church of the First Born. They are they into whose hands the     Father has given all things--They are they who are Priests and     Kings, who have received of his fullness, arid of his glory, And     are Priests of the Most High, after the order of Melchizedek, which     was after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the Only     Begotten Son; Wherefore, as it is written, they are Gods, even the     sons of God Wherefore all things are theirs, whether life or death,     or things present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are     Christ's and Christ is God's. And they shall overcome all things;     Wherefore let no man glory in man, but rather let him glory in God,     who shall subdue all enemies under his feet--These shall dwell in     the presence of God and his Christ for ever and ever. These are     they whom he shall bring with him, when he shall come in the clouds     of heaven, to reign on the earth over his people. These are they     who shall have part in the first resurrection. These are they who     shall come forth in the resurrection of the just.\" (Verses 51-65.)  Of those who attain the lesser glory of the Terrestrial it is written:      \"And again, we saw the terrestrial world, and behold and lo, these     are they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory differs from that     of the church of the First Born, who have received the fullness     of the Father, even as that of the moon differs from the sun in     the firmament. Behold, these are they who died without law, And     also they who are the spirits of men kept in prison, whom the     Son visited, and preached the gospel unto them, that they might     be judged according to men in the flesh, Who received not the     testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it. These     are they who are honorable men of the earth, who were blinded by     the craftiness of men. These are they who receive of his glory, but     not of his fullness. * * * These are they who are not valiant in     the testimony of Jesus; wherefore they obtain not the crown over     the kingdom of our God.\" (Verses 71-76, 79.)  And of the inhabitants of the Telestial:      \"And again, we saw the glory of the telestial, which glory is that     of the lesser, even as the glory of the stars differs from that of     the glory of the moon in the firmament. These are they who received     not the gospel of Christ, neither the testimony of Jesus. These are     they who deny not the Holy Spirit. These are they who are thrust     down to hell. These are they who shall not be redeemed from the     devil, until the last resurrection, until the Lord, even Christ     the Lamb shall have finished his work. * * * And the glory of the     telestial is one, even as the glory of the stars is one, for as one     star differs from another star in glory, even so differs one from     another in glory in the telestial world; For these are they who     are of Paul, and of Apollos, and of Cephas. These are they who say     they are some of one and some of another some of Christ and some     of John, and some of Moses, and some of Elias, and some of Esaias,     and some of Isaiah, and some of Enoch; But received not the gospel,     neither the testimony of Jesus, neither the prophets, neither the     everlasting covenant. Last of all, these all are they who will     not be gathered with the saints, to be caught up unto the church     of the First Born, and received into the cloud. These are they     who are liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and whoremongers,     and whosoever loves and makes a lie. * * * These are they who are     cast down to hell and suffer the wrath of Almighty God, until the     fullness of times when Christ shall have subdued all enemies under     his feet, and shall have perfected his work, * * * But behold, and     lo, we saw the glory and the inhabitants of the telestial world,     that they were as innumerable as the stars in the firmament of     heaven, or as the sand upon the sea shore, And heard the voice of     the Lord, saying these all shall bow the knee, and every tongue     shall confess to him who sits upon the throne for ever and ever;     For they shall be judged according to their works, and every man     shall receive according to his own works, his own dominion, in the     mansions which are prepared, And they shall be servants of the     Most High, but where God and Christ dwell they cannot come, worlds     without end.\" (Verses 81-85, 98-103, 106, 109-112.)  \"Mormonism\" proclaims the possibility of eternal advancement within the several kingdoms provided in the hereafter and teaches that even repentance is possible beyond the grave. It utters solemn warning, however, against procrastination and wilful neglect here, holding that this life is strictly a probationary period given unto men for repentance and valiant service, and that to neglect is to lose the ability to repent. It repudiates what it regards as a strained and irrelevant exposition of a certain isolated passage from the Preacher of old: \"If the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.\" (Eccles. 11:3.) This we do not believe was ever intended to mean that as the man is when he dies so shall he be eternally; nor do we admit that the tenor of Holy Writ supports any such inference. Neglect, wilful procrastination, evil life here shall surely be a handicap to eternal progress; but however far behind his more faithful fellows a sinner may fall, he shall yet advance if he will but repent and try. Is it empty assumption to say that such"]]]
