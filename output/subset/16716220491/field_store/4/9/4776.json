From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.  “If he be Mr. Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.”  And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court.  The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against the watcher’s inclination. But he made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.  Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed. “Mr. Hyde, I think?”  Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face, he answered coolly enough: “That is my name. What do you want?”  “I see you are going in,” returned the lawyer. “I am an old friend of Dr. Jekyll’s—Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street—you must have heard of my name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.”  “You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,” replied Mr. Hyde, blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up, “How did you know me?” he asked.  “On your side,” said Mr. Utterson “will you do me a favour?”  “With pleasure,” replied the other. “What shall it be?”  “Will you let me see your face?” asked the lawyer.  Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. “Now I shall know you again,” said Mr. Utterson. “It may be useful.”  “Yes,” returned Mr. Hyde, “It is as well we have met; and _à propos_, you should have my address.” And he gave a number of a street in Soho.  “Good God!” thought Mr. Utterson, “can he, too, have been thinking of the will?” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address.  “And now,” said the other, “how did you know me?”  “By description,” was the reply.  “Whose description?”  “We have common friends,” said Mr. Utterson.  “Common friends,” echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. “Who are they?”  “Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer.  “He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. “I did not think you would have lied.”  “Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.”  The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house.  The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a class that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. “There must be something else,” said the perplexed gentleman. “There _is_ something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be the old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan’s signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.”  Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient, handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men; map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for the fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door.  “Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?” asked the lawyer.  “I will see, Mr. Utterson,” said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. “Will you wait here by the fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?”  “Here, thank you,” said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy of his friend the doctor’s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of it as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.  “I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,” he said. “Is that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?”  “Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,” replied the servant. “Mr. Hyde has a key.”  “Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man, Poole,” resumed the other musingly.  “Yes, sir, he does indeed,” said Poole. “We have all orders to obey him.”  “I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?” asked Utterson.  “O, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here,” replied the butler. “Indeed we see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory.”  “Well, good-night, Poole.”  “Good-night, Mr. Utterson.”  And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. “Poor Harry Jekyll,” he thought, “my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the fault.” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided. And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of hope. “This Master Hyde, if he were studied,” thought he, “must have secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared to which poor Jekyll’s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot continue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to Harry’s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening! And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the will, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to the wheel—if Jekyll will but let me,” he added, “if Jekyll will only let me.” For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear as transparency, the strange clauses of the will.    DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE  A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in the man’s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire—a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4300"],["title","Ulysses (#1)"],["body","de. I don’t want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!  Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.  To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.  —Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except at night.  —Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m quite frank with you. What have you against me now?  They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.  —Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.  —Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.  He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.  Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:  —Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s death?  Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:  —What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas and sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?  —You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.  —Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.  —You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead._  A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’s cheek.  —Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?  He shook his constraint from him nervously.  —And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It’s a beastly thing and nothing else. It simply doesn’t matter. You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong way. To me it’s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it’s over. You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette’s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.  He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:  —I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.  —Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.  —Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.  Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.  —O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.  He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.  A voice within the tower called loudly:  —Are you up there, Mulligan?  —I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.  He turned towards Stephen and said:  —Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.  His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof:  —Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the moody brooding.  His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead:       And no more turn aside and brood      Upon love’s bitter mystery      For Fergus rules the brazen cars.  Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.  A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.  Where now?  Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:       I am the boy      That can enjoy      Invisibility.  Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.       And no more turn aside and brood.   Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts.  In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.  Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. _Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat._  Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!  No, mother! Let me be and let me live.  —Kinch ahoy!  Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.  —Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is apologising for waking us last night. It’s all right.  —I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.  —Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our sakes.  His head disappeared and reappeared.  —I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.  —I get paid this morning, Stephen said.  —The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.  —If you want it, Stephen said.  —Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns.  He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent:       O, won’t we have a merry time,      Drinking whisky, beer and wine!      On coronation,      Coronation day!      O, won’t we have a merry time      On coronation day!  Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?  He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.  In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.  —We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?  Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.  —Have you the key? a voice asked.  —Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!  He howled, without looking up from the fire:  —Kinch!  —It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.  The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the doorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.  —I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. Where’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.  Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.  —What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.  —We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in the locker.  —O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove milk.  Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:  —That woman is coming up with the milk.  —The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.  He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying:  —_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._  Haines sat down to pour out the tea.  —I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don’t you?  Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s wheedling"]]]
