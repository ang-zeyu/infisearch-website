To numerous other persons at leading museums throughout the United States for information on the cottonmouths in their collections, to all who helped with the field work in various ways, and to others at the University of Kansas for their help and suggestions I am grateful.     SYSTEMATIC RELATIONSHIPS AND DISTRIBUTION   Snakes of the genus _Agkistrodon_ are relatively primitive members of the Crotalidae, which is one of the most specialized families of snakes. A majority of the pit-vipers are found in the Americas, but close relatives are found from extreme southeastern Europe through temperate Asia to Japan (_A. halys_) and southeastern Asia including Indonesia (_Agkistrodon_ and _Trimeresurus_). Familial characters include: vertical pupil of the eye; facial pit present between the preoculars and loreal; scales usually keeled; short, rotatable maxilla bearing a large hollow fang; toothless premaxilla; chiefly hematoxic venom; and undivided anal plate.  The genus _Agkistrodon_ includes about nine species in the Old World and three in North and Central America. Some of the primitive characters of the genus are: head covered with nine enlarged shields or having the internasals and prefrontals broken up into small scales; subcaudals on proximal part of tail undivided; fangs relatively short; tail lacking rattles. In one species, _A. rhodostoma_, the scales are smooth; and the female is oviparous and guards her eggs until they hatch. Other species have keeled scales and are ovo-viviparous.  There is little paleontological evidence illustrating evolution of the cottonmouth or for that matter of crotalids in general. Brattstrom (1954) summarized the current knowledge of fossil pit-vipers in North America. The few fossils found of the cottonmouth are from Alacha, Brevard, Citrus, Levy, Pasco, and Pinellas counties, Florida (Brattstrom, _op. cit._:35; Auffenberg, 1963:202). All are of late Pleistocene Age and well within the present geographic range of the cottonmouth.  Of crotalid genera only _Agkistrodon_ occurs in both the Old World and the New World, suggesting that this genus is relatively old. Schmidt (1946: 149-150) mentioned several other closely related groups of animals found in both eastern Asia and eastern North America, including the reptilian genera: _Natrix_, _Opheodrys_, _Elaphe_, _Ophisaurus_, _Leiolopisma_ (= _Lygosoma_), _Eumeces_, _Clemmys_, _Emmys_, and _Alligator_. Of the groups of animals now confined to these two regions the most important are the cryptobranchid salamanders, the genus _Alligator_, and the spoon-bills (_Psephurus_ in China and _Polyodon_ in the Mississippi drainage). Fossil evidence for these groups indicates that existing forms common to eastern Asia and eastern North America are remnants of a late Cretaceous or early Tertiary Holarctic fauna which was forced southward as the climate became gradually cooler to the north. \"Other clues suggest that both _Agkistrodon_ and _Trimeresurus_ (_Bothrops_) moved from Asia to America, one of these presumably giving rise to the rattlesnakes.\" (Darlington, 1957:228).  The named, American kinds of _Agkistrodon_ currently are arranged as three species: the copperhead, the cantil and the cottonmouth. The copperhead (_A. contortrix_) is divided into four subspecies, all of which are terrestrial. This species occurs from southern New England to eastern Kansas and along the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plains, exclusive of peninsular Florida and the delta of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. It extends southwest from Kansas through the Edwards Plateau of west-central Texas. Isolated populations occur in the Chisos and Davis mountains of Trans-Pecos Texas. The cantil or Mexican moccasin (_A. bilineatus_), probably the nearest relative of the cottonmouth (_A. piscivorus_), is divisible into two subspecies and occupies a nearly complementary range from Mexico south to Nicaragua. The cottonmouth occurs throughout the coastal plains of the southeastern United States, usually at altitudes of 500 feet or less. Two subspecies are recognized, the eastern _A. p. piscivorus_ and the western _A. p. leucostoma_. A revision of the genus is underway by Professor Howard K. Gloyd.  The basic pattern and various behavioral traits are common to all three species. The young are more nearly alike in appearance than adults, the copperhead and the cottonmouth being easily confused. Adults differ in color, size, body proportions, habitat, and habits. In range and habitat preference the cottonmouth more closely resembles the southern subspecies of the copperhead, _A. c. contortrix_, which is usually found in lowlands, near swamps and streams, but seldom in water.  [Illustration: FIG. 1.]  FIG. 1. Geographic range of the cottonmouth, showing marginal and near-marginal records, based largely upon maps by Gloyd and Conant (1943:165) and Conant (1958:336) but including additional records. The more important of these records (from east to west) are discussed in the following paragraphs. Crosshatching indicates the area of intergradation between the eastern and western subspecies. Old records, indicated by dates, and their sources are as follows: 1850's and 1891--U. S. National Museum numbers 4263 and 32753 respectively; 1897--Hurter (1897); and 1895--Stejneger (1895:408).  The northernmost record for the eastern subspecies is in the Petersburg area, Prince George County, Virginia (Anon., 1953:24). A sight record (Hickman, 1922:39) near Bristol, West Virginia, probably was based on a water-snake (_Natrix_ sp.), since the stream in which the snake was seen flows north into the Ohio River rather than southeast through Virginia. In North Carolina the most inland record is from the Neuse River, six to eight miles east of Raleigh (Stejneger, 1895:408). Neill (1947:205) reported a population in the vicinity of Dry Fork Creek on the boundary line of Wilkes and Oglethorpe counties, Georgia. Distribution of cottonmouths in Florida is statewide, including the Keys and other offshore islands.  The ranges of the two subspecies, _piscivorus_ and _leucostoma_, meet near the eastern border of Mississippi. _A. p. piscivorus_ has been reported from Tishomingo County to the Gulf and east of the Loess Bluff area in central Mississippi, and _A. p. leucostoma_ has been reported from this area westward. A few specimens from along the Coast indicate intergradation (Cook, 1962:33) between the two subspecies.  Barbour (1956:33) reported one specimen from Cypress Creek, in the Green River drainage, Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, and stated that suitable habitat can be found in several areas east of Kentucky Lake. Hence, cottonmouths may have entered this area via the Ohio River. Stejneger (_loc. cit._) reported the species in the Wabash River at Mount Carmel, Wabash County, Illinois, and mentioned a former occurrence at Vincennes, Knox County, Indiana; but there are no recent records at these localities. Hurter (1897) reported having seen cottonmouths in Illinois, opposite St. Louis; Smith (1961:265) believes that this and a population in Monroe County, Illinois, are isolated relicts, since no specimens have been found within 50 miles to the south of Monroe County. The specimens reported by Anderson (1941:178; 1945:274) near Chillicothe (three miles southwest and seven miles northwest, respectively), Livingston County, Missouri, also are thought to represent a relict population. Hall and Smith (1947:453) reported one specimen from Jasper County, Missouri, in the Spring River which flows through extreme southeastern Kansas and into Oklahoma and another in the Neosho River at Chetopa, Kansas. Both of these specimens were taken after a flood, and no additional specimens have been taken in this region. Nevertheless, sufficient habitat is probably available along the Neosho and Verdigris rivers in the southeastern part of Kansas.  In Texas the cottonmouth has penetrated marginal habitat perhaps farther than anywhere else in its range. Formerly it was thought to be limited to the country east of the Balcones Escarpment (Smith and Buechner, 1947:8), but semiarid areas of the state have been invaded primarily via the Colorado and Brazos River systems up to altitudes of 2300 feet. Two additional specimens are said to have been collected along the Rio Grande. Dr. Howard K. Gloyd (_in litt._) stated that the specimen reported from Eagle Pass, Maverick County, is believed to have been taken in the 1850's; and the one said to have come from the mouth of the Devil's River is actually marked \"near Santa Rosa, Cameron County, September 30, 1891.\" No additional specimens have been taken in that area; and the range now probably extends no farther south than Corpus Christi, Texas. Brown's (1903:554) knowledge of the extension of the range of the cottonmouth west of longitude 98Â° is probably based upon the records along the Rio Grande reported in the nineteenth century.  Three extensions of the known range in Texas are reported herein. One specimen was captured by Mr. Harry Green (HWG 346) along the San Saba River, 8.1 miles west of Menard, Menard County. The other two specimens (KU 84375 and 84376) were taken by the late Paul Anderson one and one-half miles north of Pecan Crossing, South Concho River, Tom Green County, and one mile west of Mertzon, Irion County.  In the hypsithermal period following Pleistocene glaciation, cottonmouths gradually moved northward occupying areas beyond their present range. The distributional records since the 1850's and the apparent relict populations now in existence indicate that the range of this species has since receded.     DESCRIPTION  Color and Pattern   Color predominantly brown, ranging through pale reddish-brown or dark reddish-brown, brownish-green, to almost black; 10 to 17 irregular dark brown bands on paler brown ground color; young paler (some nearly salmon pink), retaining a vivid pattern throughout first year; pattern of most"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38308"],["title","Natural History of Cottonmouth Moccasin, Agkistrodon piscovorus (Reptilia) (#2)"],["body","nearly obliterated by third year; brilliance and dullness of predominant color correlated with molting cycle (skin especially bright and shiny immediately following shedding); tip of tail yellowish in juveniles; posterior part of venter and tail uniformly black in some adult individuals, especially females; secondary sexual differences in dorsal coloration, such as found in copperhead by Fitch (1960:102), not noted.  The eastern subspecies, _A. p. piscivorus_, has the more brilliant pattern in which the centers of the dark cross-bands are invaded by the ground color. The cross-bands are slightly constricted in the mid-line and may or may not be bilaterally symmetrical. One-half of the cross-band may be displaced anteriorly or posteriorly to a slight degree or may even be completely absent. From one to several dark spots may be present within the cross-bands.  The western subspecies, _A. p. leucostoma_, has a comparatively dull pattern in which the ground color does not invade the center of the cross-bands. In many instances the bands are outlined by white scales, as in the Mexican moccasin (this character is not so prominent in _A. p. piscivorus_ because of the paler ground color). A large, dark blotch usually occurs at the base of the cross-band and may completely cross the ventral scales. The characteristic variations found in _piscivorus_ are also present in _leucostoma_.  The number of bands is often difficult to count because of the dark color of some specimens. Gloyd and Conant (1943:168) reported averages of 12.5 (11 to 16) and 12.2 (10 to 16) in males and females, respectively, of _leucostoma_ and ranges of 10 to 17 for males and 10 to 16 for females with averages of 13 in both sexes of _piscivorus_. On 20 specimens of _leucostoma_ from Texas the average number of bands was 12.7 (11 to 15). If the number of bands differed on the two sides of an animal, the total number of the two sides was divided by two.   Scutellation  The scutellation of the cottonmouth closely resembles that of the other species of _Agkistrodon_. For example, the nine cephalic shields are characteristic of most species of _Agkistrodon_, as well as most other primitive crotalids and viperids, and most colubrids. Most individuals have an additional pair of large scales behind the parietals.  The numbers of postoculars, supralabials, and infralabials are variable. On either side the postoculars (three in most specimens) are reduced to two in some specimens. The supralabials (eight in most specimens) frequently vary (usually on one side only) from seven to nine. The number of infralabials is somewhat more variable than the number of supralabials, the usual number being 11, but 10 is also common; 8, 9, and 12 are more rare (Table 1). In 102 snakes in which these characters were examined, four different combinations of supralabials and seven combinations of infralabials were found. Both characters together yielded 16 combinations, considering only the actual number of scales and not taking into account the side of the head on which they occurred (Table 2). The combinations found in a brood of seven young from Houston, Texas, are shown in Table 3 to illustrate the variability of this character. Gloyd and Conant (1943:168) found a variation of 6 to 11 (8) and 7 to 9 (8) supralabials and 8 to 13 (11) and 8 to 12 (10.4) infralabials in samples of 301 _leucostoma_ and 119 _piscivorus_, respectively (numbers in parentheses represent average). Also of interest is the variability of the scales themselves. In one instance a scale was found that had not completely divided. In another specimen the last supralabial and last infralabial were one scale that completely lined the angle of the jaw. Instances of one scale almost crowding out another were common. In still other instances one or two supralabials were divided horizontally into two scales. Individual variation rather than geographical variation occurs in these characters.

Also they are slightly larger than the others. Two apical pits are present on each dorsal scale. The shape of the scales and number of scale rows vary depending upon the position on the body. Scales on the neck are considerably smaller than those elsewhere on the body and are arranged in two or three more rows than those at mid-body. The skin in the region of the throat, neck, and fore-body is especially elastic and allows the swallowing of large prey. Posteriorly from the mid-body the scales decrease in size and become more angular, those on the tail tending to be rhomboidal and wider than long. In the region of the anus the number of scale rows diminishes rapidly, leaving only 12 to 14 rows at the base of the tail and only three rows immediately ahead of the tail tip. The tail ends in a spine composed of two scales: one scale covers the bottom, lower parts of the sides, and tip of the spine; and a shorter dorsal scale covers the top and upper parts of the sides of the basal two-thirds of the spine. The spine of embryos and young cottonmouths is blunt, but is pointed in most adults.
