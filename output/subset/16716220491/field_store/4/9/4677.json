He helps Mr. MacReedy; he's a collector himself in a small way.\"  The General took Toby back with him to the hotel. He knew he should be burning up the wires to Washington with news of his horrendous discovery, but somehow he wanted to see it through himself--as far as he was able. Besides, there were certain puzzling facets that would scarcely look plausible in the dehydrated prose of an official report to Security.  It smacked almost of the supernatural. Eyeing his small guest, who was happily and rather messily devouring a piece of French pastry, accompanied by a bottle of ginger-ale--sent up by room service--the General suppressed a chill that rose from his coccyx to his cervical vertebrae.  Like most veteran men of action, the General did not decry the supernatural--such decrying was the property of armchair logicians. In the course of his long career he had seen too many things that defied logic or logical explanation. He said, \"Ready to take off, Toby?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the lad. He was properly impressed with the General's rank--revealed to him by the assistant manager in the lobby. Then, with a sudden shadow of anxiety, \"You aren't going to arrest Uncle Angus, are you, sir?\"  The General managed a chuckle. No sense in getting the lad scared. \"No, I just want to talk to him.\"  \"I'll go with you,\" the lad offered. \"Most grownups have a hard time talking to Uncle Angus. Even dad....\" Whatever was his father's problem with the prophetic model-maker remained unstated, as Toby managed to wrap lips and teeth around a large final piece of pastry. He then went to the bathroom to wash his hands before they went downstairs, to where the General's car was waiting.   2  The sight of the huge olive-drab Cadillac limousine with its two-starred flag and white trimmed and be-fourragered sergeant-chauffeur seemed to awe Toby, who lapsed into mere occasional monosyllables during the drive through the late afternoon to his Long Island home. It was as if, since the General was in mufti, the lad had not quite been able to believe in his reality--until official car and chauffeur offered proof.  This was quite all right with the General, who was desperately trying to rearrange the chaos of his thoughts into some sort of order. He knew he was being dangerously imaginative for a man in his position. But what if this MacReedy actually could foresee the future, at least in its military manifestations?  Granting this impossibility, how could the man be used? The General shuddered at the thought of \"selling\" anyone with such a gift to the Combined Chiefs of Staff--those quiet-eyed, low-voiced, strictly pragmatic men on whom, perhaps, the future of country and world depended. Even if they by some wild chance accepted the impossibility, he knew full well what would be the tenor of their thoughts--and therefore of their questions.  One of them would be sure to say, \"Very well, General, but if we put our planning in the hands of this man--seeking a short route to decisive superiority of armament--how do we know he won't make a mistake, or lead us up the garden path? How do we know he hasn't been planted for this very purpose?\"  How did he know? The General decided he didn't. Yet how could any man with such a private power be permitted to exercise his rights of free citizenship? He damned MacReedy, the enemy, the world and himself, and got resettled in his corner of the soft rear seat.  They had left the sun behind them, setting in a dust-pink mist behind the soft-edged towers of Manhattan. By the time they reached Flushing it had begun to snow--big soft flakes whose crystalline dissimilarities were almost visible to the naked eye as they settled against the car windows into wet evanescence. Up ahead the twin windshield-wipers ground them silently and methodically into wet-rimmed circle segments.  \"I hope it lasts,\" said Toby from his window. \"I got a sled for Christmas. I haven't been able to use it.\"  \"You'll get your chance,\" said the General. Damn it, he wondered, what kind of man was Angus MacReedy--if he was a man. Somehow the silent snow, the waning traffic, the oncoming twilight, combined into a sense of ominous portent. It was as if the car were standing still, while a perilous future rushed toward it.  \"We turn left at the next traffic light, sir,\" said Toby.  They turned. They skirted a thinly-settled swampy area on a narrow road, against a background of scrubby pines. The sprawling metropolis might have been on some other continent, some other planet. They met only one car--a long black sedan, that slithered past them on the skiddy road-surface, missing them by inches.  The house where they pulled to a halt at Toby's direction was not large. It had been put up early in the century, and its motif was that of the high-gabled Swiss chalet. Mercifully the snow gave it a touch of quaintness, almost of rightness, despite the absence of lowering alps. Toby pointed to a similar structure about a hundred yards further down the road. \"That's where I live,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  MacReedy answered the door. He was a tall, angular man with a long, angular face--from which small blue eyes peered alertly. He wore a grey glen-plaid reefer that was buttoned wrong, a dark blue-flannel shirt and covert slacks that needed a press. He said, \"Hello, Toby--you've brought company, I see.\"  \"This is General Wales,\" said the lad very politely. \"General--Uncle Angus.\"  The General had a ridiculous fugitive memory--\"Alice, mutton--mutton, Alice.\" He shook hands with the model-maker.  \"Honored, General,\" said MacReedy. He ushered them into a living room, whose desk and tables and mantel were literally covered with miniature American soldiery. He said, \"Sorry the place is such a mess\"--picking up the morning paper from the carpet beside a worn but comfortable-looking easy-chair--\"but I wasn't expecting callers. I just had to boot out some sort of a mad Russian.\"  \"_What!_\" The general didn't mean to bark but couldn't help it.  MacReedy grinned quietly and said, \"This fellow said he was assistant military attache, or something. Offered me all kinds of money to do some work for him.\"  \"What did he look like?\" the General asked.  MacReedy, filling a corn-cob pipe that appeared to be near the close of its short life, paused to say, \"Like nothing special--not nearly as distinguished as you, General. Blond, chunky fellow with a bit of accent. Not a lot, but enough.\"  The General exchanged glances with Toby. He knew, without asking, that the boy was thinking the same as himself; it was the man who had bought the XT-101 model in the shop earlier that afternoon.  MacReedy got his pipe going and said through a small blue cloud of smoke, \"How does the exhibit look, Toby? Have they got it right?\"  \"Pretty good, Uncle Angus,\" said the lad seriously. \"They got the Mexican and Black Hawk War units mixed up, but I guess we can't blame them for that.\"  \"I guess we can't,\" said MacReedy. He turned to the General, added, \"Now, sir, what can I do for you? Or need I ask?\"  \"I have a hunch you know pretty well what I'm after,\" said the General. \"My predecessor must have given you some idea.\"  \"I've been afraid of this,\" said MacReedy with a sigh. \"It's what I deserve for trying to show off to Toby.\"  \"I don't understand,\" said the General.  \"I was trying to show Toby how good I was,\" he said, ruffling the boy's curly hair. \"Then, when I got that seventy-five AA-gun doped out ahead of time--and it proved correct--I had to go one step further. I should never have let the model out of the house.\"  \"I'd like to see your workshop,\" said the General.  Angus MacReedy removed his pipe and said, \"Come along.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The basement ran the length and width of the house. Although furnace and fuel-storage were walled off in a separate room at one end it still provided a sizable workroom, enough for three long wooden tables. On one of them MacReedy carved his tiny figures and cannon and vehicle parts from solid chunks of lead. Another was used for painting, a third for drying.  On this third table were a half-dozen more of the XT-101's--along with a group of Confederate cannoneers and their field-pieces, some Indians, a small group of knights in armor, and what appeared to be Roman Legionaries.  The General pointed to these and said, \"I didn't know you went in for them. I thought you were strictly an American specialist.\"  MacReedy puffed at his pipe, then said, \"I'm doing these for Toby--in return for his services as delivery boy and all-around helper. I'm trying to teach him history in reverse.\"  \"Odd concept,\" said the General.  \"It works--doesn't it, Toby?\" MacReedy said to the lad.  \"Uncle Angus says it will help me when I take history in college,\" Toby said stoutly. \"This is King Henry the Fifth at Agincourt--just like Sir Lawrence Olivier in the movie. And this is Genghis Khan. And here is Tamerlaine, and Charles Martel, and Caesar....\"  \"I see,\" said the General. He was a little overwhelmed at so much evidence of one man's individual craftsmanship and industry. He eyed the XT-101's with malevolent interest, then studied a nearly-finished weapon on the carving table. It looked like....  It was! One of the just-conceived, self-reloading rocket-launchers on armored mobile carriage with amphibious tractor-treads. He said, his voice dry and tight, \"Where'd you get this, MacReedy?\"  MacReedy wandered over to stand beside him. He said, \"I didn't _get_ it anywhere; it just seems like the logical next step in ordnance, General. I've had pretty good luck in the past, figuring things out this way. I had the Sherman tank plotted back in nineteen-forty--just before I was drafted. I hadn't dared trust my hunches till I saw my first one two years later at Pine Camp.\"  \"You were in the Army?\"  \"Six years,\" said MacReedy. \"Two years here in camp and Officer's Candidate School,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41062"],["title","The Final Figure (#2)"],["body","two abroad--Sicily, Anzio and the Rhone Valley. I stopped a piece of shell near Lyon, and put in the rest of my time in hospital.\"  \"Rough,\" said the General though he had neither the time nor the interest for sympathy. \"Tell me how you 'figure' these things out. The Sherman tank, if you wish.\"  MacReedy wagged his head modestly. \"It wasn't too difficult, once I'd seen the General Grant. That one obviously wouldn't do; it was too high, needed a full-pivot turret. Yet the basic design was there--anyone who'd thought about it could have done the same. But it was a pleasant shock to learn I'd been right.\"  \"I see,\" said the General. \"And you did the others by the same process--and you're always right?\"  \"Not always,\" replied MacReedy. \"I fluffed badly on the atomic cannon. I expected a longer barrel for greater muzzle-velocity and range; here, I'll show you.\" He led the way to a dusty wall shelf where imperfect and broken models crowded together. There was the A-cannon--not as it had appeared, but as the General knew it was going to look in two years, when certain needed changes were made.  He said, \"An understandable error. Unfortunately, mobility had to be considered.\" He paused, looked MacReedy straight in the eye. \"I hope you didn't show any of this to your--previous visitor.\"  MacReedy laughed. \"Hardly,\" he replied. \"I'm American, never fear. I'm just one of the lucky few who has been able to make a good living out of my hobby; I have no axes to grind.\"  \"We may have an axe to grind with you,\" said the General with a hint of grimness. The rocket-launcher and the improved A-gun were like the one-two punch of a good heavyweight-hitter. He went back to the XT-101, said, \"About this twin-mount tank--how'd you figure we'd mount the automatic machinery outside the turret?\"  \"That wasn't too difficult--if I'm right; and I gather I am,\" said MacReedy. \"There's simply too much stuff to put inside a tank-turret; you've got to mount it outside. And that means plenty of protection, which means an extra armored sleeve. So....\"   3  The General said, \"MacReedy, why are you showing me this? I could be an imposter, a spy.\"  \"With that official limousine?\" the model-maker countered. \"I doubt it. Besides, Toby vouches for you.\"  \"Risky,\" said the General.  \"Besides,\" said MacReedy with the suggestion of a smile, \"I've seen your picture in _Life_ magazine.\" He paused, added, \"After all, in my humble way I'm a bit of an ordnance nut myself.\"  \"I don't believe you,\" said the General flatly--\"I mean about working these things out through logic and guesses. But however you do it, surely you can appreciate that you're much too dangerous to be walking around loose. Especially since _They_ know about you. I'm afraid I'm going to have to take you back with me.\"  \"Nothing doing,\" said MacReedy. \"I can take care of myself. Besides, this is my home. I like it here.\"  \"You're being close to treasonable,\" said the General.  \"Not I--_you_ are,\" came the incredible reply. \"You, not I, are attempting to deny a citizen his rights under the Constitution.\"  \"Damn it, man!\" the General backpedaled quickly. \"Can't you understand? Suppose _They_ got hold of you--_They'd_ have you dishing up our innermost secrets to them ahead of time. I don't need to tell you what that could mean in the present world situation.\"  \"You don't, General,\" said MacReedy. \"But I don't think _They'd_ get much out of me--much that was useful, I mean. I can't think clearly under drugs or torture; I'd be more of a menace than a help. I explained that to my visitor before you came. He seemed to believe me.\"  \"Maybe _he_ did,\" said the baffled General, \"but don't bet on his superiors. You've been an Army officer, MacReedy; I can have you called back into service.\"  \"With a permanent medical discharge?\" MacReedy countered.  The General sighed. He knew when he was beaten. He said, \"You'll have to stand for a guard then--twenty-four hours. We'll keep them out of sight as much as possible.\" He wished the whole business were rationally explicable to his own superiors. As it was he knew his hands were tied when it came to drastic action.  \"I suppose it's necessary,\" said MacReedy sadly, but not defiantly; \"I should never have tried to show off.\"  \"It's too late for that sort of thing,\" said the General. \"I'm going to have to take some of your models with me--it's too late to do much about the new tank, but I'll have to have the rocket-launcher and the A-gun. And I'll want your promise not to indulge in any more such experiments except as I request.\"  \"That I am glad to give you,\" said MacReedy and there was no doubting the sincerity of his words.  \"I'll pay you for them,\" offered the General.  \"Of course,\" replied the model-maker; \"my name isn't MacReedy for nothing.\"  As he handed over a couple of hundred dollars the General found himself almost liking the man. _Damn these screwballs_, he thought. He wondered when he was going to wake up and find it hadn't happened. It _couldn't_ be happening, any of it. But the perilously-perfect models, of weapons that were yet to be, felt terribly real to his touch.  He said, \"Toby, run upstairs and tell Sergeant Riley to come down here and take some stuff out to the car.\" And, when the boy was gone, \"MacReedy, will you do some work for us?\"  \"Of course,\" said the other. \"A man gets feeling a bit useless making toy soldiers in times like these.\"  \"The pay won't be much....\" the General began.  \"I can afford it,\" said MacReedy with the unexpected generosity of the true Scotsman. \"What do you want me to do?\"  \"_They_ have a new weapon building,\" said the General. \"All we've got are a few spy-photographs--not very good, I'm afraid.\"  \"What sort of weapon?\" the model-maker asked.  \"That's just it--we don't know,\" replied the General. \"I'm going to send you what we have on it tomorrow; I'm hoping you can give us a line on its purpose.\" He paused, added grimly, \"As it is we don't know how to meet it. We haven't an inkling. It's given the Chief a whole new patch of grey hairs.\"  \"I'll do what I can,\" said MacReedy. \"But don't expect the moon.\"  \"All I want is the nature and purpose of that weapon--if it _is_ a weapon,\" was the General's reply. Then Toby and Sergeant Riley came clumping down the stairs and the conference was at an end.  Before he left the General gave Toby five dollars. \"That's for bringing me here,\" he told the lad. \"You'll be seeing me again.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Toby. He didn't sound at all surprised.         *       *       *       *       *  When he got back In the car alone, the general counted the models on the seat beside him--one rocket-launcher, one A-gun. He said, \"Riley, how are we fixed for gas?\"  \"Pretty good, sir,\" came the reply. \"We can make the city okay, sir.\"  \"Fill up before you get there,\" the General told him. \"We're going right on through to Washington tonight.\"  \"But, sir, I haven't notified the motor pool at Governor's Island,\" the Sergeant protested.  \"Damn the motor pool!\" the General exploded. \"I'll take care of them. Now get going; we've got a long drive ahead.\"  The big car gathered speed through the thickening night snow.  The General slept most of the way, after he and the Sergeant stopped for dinner at a Howard Johnson restaurant on Route One, just north of New Brunswick. After a shower, a change into uniform and breakfast, he was in sound operating shape when he reached his office at the Pentagon the next morning.  He arranged for a round-the-clock guard of Angus MacReedy's house, ordered investigation of the model-maker's record, had a copy of the complete file on the possible enemy weapon forwarded to Long Island by special messenger. Then he summoned a special meeting of top-echelon Ordnance brass and produced the models of the XT-101, the self-reloading rocket launcher and the improved A-gun.  If such a Broadway-Hollywood term as _sensational_ could be used in any connection with a Pentagon conference, the General's meeting with his colleagues might have qualified for it. Experts were quick to understand the practicability of the models, quick to recast their plans accordingly.  Within the week, he was summoned before the Combined Chiefs and commended by that body for his clear-sightedness in cutting Gordian knots of the most baffling order. There was talk of a third star and appointment as Chief of Ordnance once the somewhat-doddering incumbent was retired, come June. He was a sort of brown-haired white-haired boy. He was interviewed by representatives of three national newsweeklies.  Though he wore his new honors gracefully, actually the General was thoroughly uncomfortable. He was far more concerned with the safety of the country than with his own advancement; and his ego was much too solidly-based to permit him enjoyment of honors that were not rightfully his.  The worst of it was that he couldn't explain. If he told his superiors that his \"inspirations\" came from the intuitive head of a toy-soldier maker on Long Island who even denied his intuition in the name of logic--not only would his own career be permanently damaged, but the value of MacReedy's models would be suspected. So much so that they might be disregarded entirely--thus retying the Gordian knots that were stymying the armament program.  MacReedy's file was laid on his desk one morning by a plump WAC secretary. It was exactly as the model-maker had stated: he was American-born, only child of a Scottish engineer and a German-American woman from Wisconsin. He held an engineering degree from a small polytechnical institute in upstate New York.  His war-record was exemplary. At the time of his wound in Central France, MacReedy had been a captain in the Combat Engineers, wearer of a silver star won at Anzio. There was a complete medical-report on the wound and treatment, whose technical jargon was too much for the General. All he could gather was that it was a head-wound and brain injury, which had rendered the model-maker unfit for"]]]
