In his record of the great deeds of the Canadian Corps on the Somme we shall find combined the two qualities which make letters last, the imagination which can convey to the future the agonies and heroisms of the past, and the chiselled style shaping the rough outlines of the records into a clean-cut and enduring narrative.

DESIRE TRENCH   APPENDIX     CANADA IN FLANDERS    CHAPTER I  THE FOURTH DIVISION  In the first and second volumes of this history Lord Beaverbrook has told the war-story of Canada from the mobilisation of the 1st Canadian Division at Valcartier in August, 1914, to the conclusion of our work in the Ypres salient in June, 1916.  He has dealt progressively with from one to three divisions, bringing the second and third in turn into his narrative, recording the organisation of each as it came into being, and then co-ordinating its military exploits with the exploits of its sister divisions.  During all that time the 4th Canadian Division was on its way.  It was struggling into existence.  Its battalions were forming, training, being reduced to skeletons by the necessities of the veteran units in France, and recovering strength by the absorption of raw material.  The 44th Battalion was mobilised in the winter of 1915, while the 1st Division was still on Salisbury Plain; yet it was not until the autumn of 1916 that it reached France as a unit of the 4th Canadian Division. Between the date of its mobilisation and that of its first contact with the enemy it supplied many drafts of officers and men to reserve and fighting battalions in England and France, and absorbed drafts of all ranks from junior units.  It was so with all the infantry battalions which, in time, went to the composition of the new Division, only to a lesser degree than in the case of the 44th.  Of the infantry brigades of this Division only the 10th is of purely Western origin, its battalions--the 44th, 46th, 47th, and 50th--having been recruited in Winnipeg, Southern Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Calgary respectively.  These battalions had comprised the 14th (Reserve) Canadian Infantry Brigade during their period of training in England previous to the formation of the 4th Division.  The brigade sailed for France on August 10th, 1916, and took a place in the front line for the first time twelve days later, when it relieved our 4th Brigade in a section of our tortured defences before Ypres.  During the first five months of its active service the 10th was commanded by Brigadier-General W. St. Pierre Hughes.  On January 18th, 1917, it was taken over by Brigadier-General Edward Hilliam, D.S.O., late C.O. of the 25th Battalion.  The story of this Brigade's offensive and defensive operations is to be found in subsequent chapters of this history incorporated in the general narrative of Canadian activities.  The 11th Canadian Infantry Brigade, organised in May, 1916, lost two of its original battalions in the following month, owing to the great and immediate need of reinforcements at the front in consequence of the bitter fighting of June in the Ypres salient.  These units were replaced by others; and when it commenced its actual war-service it consisted of the 54th from Kootenay, the 75th from Toronto, the 87th of Montreal, and the 102nd of Northern British Columbia.  This Brigade was originally commanded by Brigadier-General F. O. W. Loomis, D.S.O., who had previously commanded a battalion of the 1st Canadian Division; but after Major-General Mercer was killed in action in June, the 2nd Brigade contributed its G.O.C., Major-General Lipsett, to the 3rd Division, Loomis was recalled to France to take the 2nd Brigade, and Lieutenant-Colonel V. W. Odlum, D.S.O., of the 7th Battalion, was promoted to the command of the 11th Brigade and the rank of Brigadier-General.  The 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade was organised from the 16th (Reserve) Brigade in May, with Brigadier-General Lord Brooke in command.  It originally consisted of the 51st, 72nd, 73rd, and 87th Battalions, but in June twenty-four officers and more than seven hundred other ranks of the 51st were drafted to France, and their place in the Brigade was filled by the 78th.  The 87th was transferred to the 11th Brigade.  The final composition of the 12th Brigade was as follows:--38th Battalion of Ottawa (its _personnel_ representing such well-known Canadian Militia regiments as the Governor-General's Foot Guards, the Duke of Cornwall's Own Rifles, the Brockville Rifles, the Lanark and Renfrew Regiment and the Stormont and Glengarry Highlanders), the 72nd Battalion of Vancouver, the 73rd of Montreal, and the 78th of Winnipeg.  Shortly after its arrival in France the command of the 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade was transferred to Brigadier-General J. H. MacBrien, D.S.O.  From the date of its organisation the 4th Canadian Division has been commanded by Major-General David Watson, C.B.  This Division has been fortunate from the first in the matter of the _personnel_ of its higher commands and senior appointments. Major-General Watson commenced his military service in this war in August, 1914, as a Lieutenant-Colonel.  He did splendid work with his battalion--the 2nd (Central Ontario)--during the Second Battle of Ypres and until he was promoted to the command of the 5th Brigade in the autumn of 1915.  Brigadier-General Edward Hilliam, who took over the command of the 10th Brigade in January, 1917, has had a career of distinguished activity since the first day of Canada's military participation in the war.  As a Captain of the 5th Battalion he was wounded at Gravenstafel Ridge on April 25th, 1915, while engaged on a service of exceptional danger and importance.  The story is told in Vol. I. of this history.  After months more of hard service with the 5th, and a step in rank, he was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel and transferred to the 25th (Nova Scotia) Battalion.  His success continued unfalteringly with his new command, as the splendid work of the Nova Scotians at Courcelette on September 15th, 1916, has proved to the world.  Brigadier-General Loomis, who commanded the 11th Brigade for a time in England, is another survivor of the Second Battle of Ypres.  His original battalion was the 13th Royal Highlanders of Canada.  From the 11th Brigade he was recalled to France in June, 1916, to command the 2nd Brigade.  His Brigade-Major, Captain Gardner, a veteran of the 7th Battalion, returned to France at the same time and took over the 7th from Lieutenant-Colonel Odlum, who was appointed to the command of the 11th Brigade.  Brigadier-General V. W. Odlum, D.S.O., before his promotion to a brigade had commanded the 7th (British Columbia) Battalion at the front since the death of Lieutenant-Colonel Hart-McHarg in April, 1915.  To those who know, this statement sufficiently explains Odlum's fitness for any fighting command.  Brigadier-General J. H. MacBrien, commanding the 12th Brigade, was at one time D.A.A. and O.M.G. of the 1st Canadian Division, and in recognition of his services in this capacity he was mentioned in despatches and made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order.  He was afterwards promoted to the General Staff of the Canadian Corps.  Lieutenant-Colonel W. E. Ironsides, D.S.O., Major K. D. B. Murray, D.S.O., and Captain A. A. Aitken, General Staff officers, first, second, and third grade of the Division, all have served actively on one or more of Britain's fighting fronts since the first days of the war.  Captain R. M. Redmond was drawn from the Casualty Centre after he had seen service with the 60th Battalion of the 3rd Division.  All other officers of the Divisional Staff had seen previous service in France, and a number of them had been decorated for their good work. By hard work or hard fighting Lieutenant-Colonel E. B. Panet, Colonel H. A. Chisholm, and Captain F. R. Burnside had won the D.S.O., and Captain Meurling and Hon. Major the Reverend A. M. Gordon the Military Cross, long before the materialisation of the 4th Canadian Division.  The 3rd Canadian Divisional Artillery, which was organised and trained in England during the spring and summer of 1916, and went to France with the 4th Division, consists of the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th Canadian Artillery Brigades and the Divisional Artillery Ammunition Column.  The batteries and sections of which this force was formed came originally from almost every corner of Canada, north and south, east and west.  For a time the Brigades were composed as follows:--The 8th, of the 30th, 31st, 40th, and 41st Field Batteries; the 9th, of the 32nd, 33rd, 45th, and 46th Field Batteries; the 10th, of the 37th, 38th, 39th, and 44th Field Batteries; and the 11th (Howitzer) Brigade of the 29th, 35th, 36th, and 43rd Howitzer Batteries.  This organisation was not satisfactory.  The 29th (Howitzer) Battery was left with the 11th Brigade, and to it were added the 41st, 44th, and 46th Field Batteries. To replace these field batteries in the other Brigades the 35th (Howitzer) Battery went to the 8th, the 36th to the 9th, and the 43rd to the 10th.  Thus each Brigade was composed of three field batteries and one howitzer battery.  The 8th Brigade, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46116"],["title","Canada in Flanders, Volume III (#2)"],["body","Field Artillery, which was brought from Canada to England by Lieutenant-Colonel Gillies, passed into the hands of Lieutenant-Colonel D. T. V. Eaton, of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, on March 9th, 1916.  Eaton had commanded the R.C.H.A. with our 1st Division in France in 1915.  He is a professional as well as a practical artillery officer, with years of theoretical and scientific study behind his experience in the field.  The command of the 9th Brigade, C.F.A., went to Lieutenant-Colonel H. G. Carscallen, who had long ago been mentioned in despatches for his work at the Front with the 11th Battery; that of the 10th to Lieutenant-Colonel G. H. Ralston, who distinguished himself as far back as June, 1915, at the \"Duck's Bill,\" when two guns of his battery were established and fought in our front-line trench, seventy-five yards distant from the German trench, with disastrous results to the enemy's wire, parapets, and machine-gun emplacements (see Vol. I., p. 133). Lieutenant-Colonel A. G. MacNaughton, late of the 2nd Brigade, C.F.A., was appointed to the 11th Brigade.  These four Brigades and their ammunition column went to France under the command of Brigadier-General J. H. Mitchell, late of the 3rd Brigade, C.F.A.  This officer had been mentioned in despatches and awarded the Legion of Honour, Croix d'Officier, a year before.  The 4th Canadian Division went to France in August, 1916, the 10th Infantry Brigade arriving on the 11th, the 11th Brigade on the 14th, and the 12th Brigade on the 15th.  On the 17th they assembled, and within the week were moved into positions on the war-torn front of the Ypres salient.  There they remained until the first week in October, when they joined the Canadian Corps on the Somme.  During their occupation of the Ypres salient each of the three Brigades was withdrawn in turn for a course of tactical training.  So it was that the autumn of 1916 saw the Canadian Army in France flooding to and beyond the one hundred thousand mark.  Four Divisions, according to the old establishment, which gave twenty-two thousand men of all ranks and arms to a division, would account for eighty-eight thousand Canadians in France at that time, but the development of the machine-gun service and the creation of trench-mortar batteries long ago caused the outgrowth and consequent revision of that establishment. And still, without the addition of a further Division, the Canadian Army Corps continued to grow, waxing greater daily to meet every progressive need and condition of modern warfare.  By January, 1917, Canada's man-power in France reached the significant total of one hundred and twelve thousand.  This figure takes no account of the wastage of battle.  The seriously wounded and work-worn who are returned to England are, like the dead, immediately struck out of the tally.  This figure stands for fit Canadians actively employed at the moment in first-hand combat with the enemy.  In the past, great battles have been won and long wars brought to a swift and violent end, tyrants have been broken, races enslaved, and thrones overturned by armies far weaker in numbers and in spirit than these fighting legions of Canada.  To enforce the significance of this Canadian Field Army of 112,000, we may compare the numbers engaged in some of the decisive battles of the past.  The army of Napoleon, for instance, numbered but 70,000 men when he broke the power of Austria and Russia at Austerlitz.  Wellington won the crushing victory of Vittoria, in the Peninsular War.  with a force of 65,000; and at Waterloo he commanded rather less than 68,000.  The terrific battle of Gettysburg, in the American Civil War, was fought by 78,000 Federals against the slightly smaller forces of the Southern Confederacy.  Even at the great battle of Sedan, which decided the issue of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the army of France, on which all her hopes were staked--and lost--numbered but 150,000.  From such figures may be estimated the importance of Canada's contribution in the present gigantic struggle for liberty and right.  In the summer of 1914 Canada was a land of peace, of self-interest, of political warfare, and commercial and agricultural prosperity; and now her thousands lie dead on foreign battlefields; thousands of her sons have returned to her, maimed, broken, and blind; her forward army fights on, continually bleeding yet continually growing in strength, reinforced from her trained troops in England; and to her own home camps and garrisons her sons continue to gather from counting-house, school, and farm.     CHAPTER II  HOLDING THE LINE  The Battle of Sanctuary Wood was fought and endured throughout the first two days of June, 1916.  Canada's resistance to that terrific and overwhelming onslaught of metal and men will live as long and gloriously as any victory in the great story of our arms.  During those two fateful days Canadian trenches were obliterated--blown out of the ground; dug-outs were buried and strong points crushed; woods in our positions were mown and torn to earth; Major-General Mercer was killed and one of our Brigade commanders wounded and taken prisoner.  The Canadian front was crushed by that indescribable deluge of exploding metal--but it was not broken.  Between the heroic actions in the Ypres salient in June (1st to 15th) and the commencement of our strenuous thrusts on the Somme front in mid-September, no unit of the Canadian Corps was in any major offensive operation.  But the routine work of holding and strengthening our positions continued with the full measure of that activity for which the Canadians have become famous.  The vitality of our opposition to the confronting masses of men and machinery did not lessen for an instant.  Relieved from the recent terrific efforts of defence and counter-attack, we were stationary yet aggressive.  Hostile trenches and strongholds were raided and bombarded, wire was cut by hand and smashed by shell-fire, and mines were sprung.  All arms continued to carry on enthusiastically, and the mental peace and physical security of the occupants of opposing positions were shattered constantly by bayonet and grenade, trench-bomb, bullet, and shell.  The following instances will serve to illustrate the nature of our activities throughout this period of waiting, of preparation, and of so-called quiet.  Dominion Day (July 1st) was celebrated by the 26th (New Brunswick) Battalion in a manner little appreciated by the grey ranks across the way.  Supported by the fire of our artillery and trench-mortars, two officers and twenty-five other ranks operated against a convenient point in the German front-line trench.  The assaulting party were observed and subjected to a brisk but inaccurate fire of machine-guns and rifles before they had passed the enemy's inner wire.  They pressed forward without a pause and rushed the parapet.  The garrison of the trench immediately retired from this threatened point except for three men, who stuck to their loopholes and continued firing.  Lieutenant Fleming accounted for one of these by thrusting his revolver into a loophole and returning the fire.  The trench was then entered and its remaining defenders disposed of.  After our party had investigated about forty yards of the trench they were driven out by a heavy bombardment of rifle-grenades and mortar-bombs.  They then returned to our own lines with a few slight casualties, some useful information, and a quantity of German equipment.  An encounter in No Man's Land between a patrol of the 22nd (French Canadian) Battalion and a German patrol on the night of July 4th resulted in the dispersion of the enemy and our capture of two prisoners.  Ten nights later a reconnoitring patrol from the 25th (Nova Scotia) Battalion attacked an enemy listening-post at the moment of its being strongly reinforced.  After a brisk exchange of grenades the Germans ran for their trench, leaving the field and one of their wounded to us.  On the night of the 25th a large German mine was blown in our lines on the Bluff.  This was not the enemy's first attempt to possess himself of that advantageous position.  It will be remembered that he attained his object in January of the same year and was not driven out until a month later, and then only at a heavy cost of killed and wounded. Fortunately the second attempt to secure a foothold on that ground failed utterly, thanks to the alertness and prompt action of our troops immediately concerned.  Briefly, the story of the foiled effort is this:--  The 1st Canadian Division, which had taken over the Bluff sector on the 22nd of the month, received warning two days later from Major North, of the 1st Canadian Tunnelling Company, that the enemy might be depended upon to blow a mine very soon somewhere in the vicinity.  The localities which were considered with the liveliest suspicion were a point known as the Bean and Trench 33.  The Division immediately warned the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the menace; the G.O.C. the Brigade ordered reductions in the garrisons of the threatened positions, the covering of that section of front by machine-guns, and the detailing of parties for counter-attack and of other parties for the vital work of consolidation should a mine be blown.  The early hours of the night of the 25th were unusually quiet about the Bluff.  Artillery was silent.  Snipers and machine-gunners seemed half-hearted in their activities.  The 7th (British Columbia) Battalion was engaged in preparing for a relief which was to be completed by midnight.  At ten o'clock the quiet was shattered by a tremendous convulsion. Earth, fire, rock, and smoke belched to heaven.  Trenches vanished, engulfed.  Instantly the S.O.S. rocket went up.  Our machine-guns responded like crackling echoes of the explosion.  Within thirty seconds of the rocket-signal for help the guns of Dodd's Group commenced a crushing bombardment of the German positions which threatened the new crater."]]]
