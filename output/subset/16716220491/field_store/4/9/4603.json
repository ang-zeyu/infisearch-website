Here, too, in the very outset, we find that rare virtue of making the best of everything peeping out, which so strongly characterized him.       \"It is a sudden change of temperature, truly,--from near      freezing at starting, to 90° or 100° at arriving. It _sounds      hot_, but a tent at 84° is tolerably endurable, especially      if there is a breeze.\"  At Umbala, he attends a grand muster of troops, and sees the Irregulars for the first time.       \"The quiet-looking and English-dressed Hindoo troopers      strangely contrasted with the wild Irregulars in all the      fanciful _un_uniformity of their native costume: yet these      last are the men _I_ fancy for service.\"  This was on the 2d of December. On Christmas-day he writes:--       \"I have been in four general engagements of the most      formidable kind ever known in India. On the 10th, on our      usual quiet march we were surprised by being joined by an      additional regiment, and by an order for all non-soldiers to      return to Umbala.\"  Then comes the description of forced marches, and battles which one feels were won,--and that was all. The same story everywhere as to the Sepoys; at Moodkee,       \"Our Sepoys could not be got to face the tremendous fire of      the Sikh artillery, and as usual, the more they quailed the      more the English officers exposed themselves in vain efforts      to bring them on.... At Ferozeshah on the evening of the      21st, as we rushed towards the guns in the most dense dust      and smoke, and under an unprecedented fire of grape, our      Sepoys again gave way and broke. It was a fearful crisis,      but the bravery of the English regiments saved us. A ball      struck my leg below the knee, but happily spared the bone. I      was also knocked down twice,--once by a shell bursting so      close to me as to kill the men behind me, and once by the      explosion of a magazine. The wound in my leg is nothing, as      you may judge when I tell you that I was on foot or      horseback the whole of the two following days.... No efforts      could bring the Sepoys forward, or half the loss might have      been spared, had they rushed on with the bayonet.... Just as      we were going into action, I stumbled on poor Carey, whom      you may remember to have heard of at Price's at Rugby. On      going over the field on the 30th, I found the body actually      cut to pieces by the keen swords of the Sikhs, and but for      his clothes could not have recognized him. I had him carried      into camp for burial, poor fellow, extremely shocked at the      sudden termination of our renewed acquaintance.... I enjoyed      all, and entered into it with great zest, till we came to      actual blows, or rather, I am (_now_) half ashamed to say,      till the blows were over, and I saw the horrible scenes      which ensue on war. I have had quite enough of such sights      now, and hope it may not be my lot to be exposed to them      again.... We are resting comfortably in our tents, and had a      turkey for our Christmas dinner.\" (pp. 66, 67, 68, 69.)  In the next letter the fight at Sobraon is described:--       \"On we went as usual in the teeth of a dreadful fire of guns      and musketry, and after a desperate struggle we got within      their _triple_ and _quadruple_ intrenchments; and then their      day of reckoning came indeed. Driven from trench to trench,      and surrounded on all sides, they retired, fighting most      bravely, to the river, into which they were driven pellmell,      a tremendous fire of musketry pouring on them from our bank,      and the Horse Artillery finishing their destruction with      grape. I had the pleasure myself of spiking two guns which      were turned on us.\"  A rough baptism of war, this, for a young soldier! No wonder that when the excitement is over, for the moment he thinks he \"has had enough of such sights.\" But the poetry of battle has entered into him, witness this glorious sketch of a deed done by the 80th Queen's (Staffordshire).       \"I lay between them and my present regiment (1st E. B.      Fusiliers) on the night of the 21st of December, at      Ferozeshah, when Lord Hardinge called out '80th! that gun      must be silenced.' They jumped up, formed into line, and      advanced through the black darkness silently and firmly;      gradually we lost the sound of their tread, and anxiously      listened for the slightest intimation of their      progress;--all was still for five minutes, while they      gradually gained the front of the battery whose fire had      caused us so much loss. Suddenly we heard a dropping      fire,--a blaze of the Sikh cannon followed, then a thrilling      cheer from the 80th, accompanied by a rattling and murderous      volley as they sprang upon the battery and spiked the      monster gun. In a few more minutes they moved back quietly,      and lay down as before on the cold sand; but they had left      forty-five of their number and two captains to mark the      scene of their exploit by their graves.\"  And so in another month, when the war is over and the army on its return, he \"catches himself wishing and asking for more.\"       \"Is it not marvellous, as if one had not had a surfeit of      killing? But the truth is _that_ is not the motive, but a      sort of undefined ambition.... I remember bursting into      tears in sheer rage in the midst of the fight at Sobraon at      seeing our soldiers lying killed and wounded.\"  His first campaign is over, and he goes into cantonments. The chief impression left on his mind is extreme disappointment with the state of the Sepoy regiments, which he expresses to Mr. Thomason:--       \"In discipline and subordination they seem to be lamentably      deficient, especially towards the native commissioned and      non-commissioned officers. On the march, I have found these      last give me more trouble than the men even. My brother      officers say that I see an unfavorable specimen in the 2d,      as regards discipline, owing to their frequent service of      late, and the number of recruits; but I fear the evil is      very wide-spread. It may no doubt be traced mainly to the      want of European officers. This, however, is an evil not      likely to be removed on any large scale. Meantime, unless      some vigorous and radical improvements take place, I think      our position will be very uncertain and even alarming in the      event of extended hostilities. You must really forgive my      speaking so plainly, and writing my own opinions so freely.      You encouraged me to do so when I was at Agra, if you      remember, and I value the privilege too highly as connected      with the greater one of receiving advice and counsel from      you, not to exercise it, even at the risk of your thinking      me presumptuous and hasty in my opinions.\"  Acting upon these impressions, he applies for and obtains an exchange into the 1st Bengal Europeans, in which he is eighth second-lieutenant at the age of twenty-five, the junior in rank of boys of eighteen and nineteen. He feels that he has difficult cards to play, but resolves to make the best of everything, and regrets only \"that the men who are to support the name and power of England in Asia are sent out here at an age when, neither by education nor reflection can they have learnt all, or even a fraction of what those words mean. It would be a happy thing for India and for themselves, if all came out here at a more advanced age than now, but _one_ alone breaking through the custom in that respect made and provided, must not expect to escape the usual fate, or at least the usual annoyances, of innovators.\"  At this point an opening, of which he was just the man to make the most, occurs. Mr. Thomason writes to Colonel, afterwards Sir Henry, Lawrence, the new political agent at Lahore, introducing Hodson; and at once a friendship, founded on mutual appreciation, springs up between the two, to end only with their lives. The agent manages to have the young soldier constantly in his office, and to get all sorts of work out of him. As a reward, he takes him on an expedition into Cashmere, in the autumn of 1846, whither they accompany the forces of Gholab Singh, to whom the country had been ceded by treaty. The letters from Cashmere on this occasion, and again in 1850, when he accompanied Sir Henry on a second trip to Cashmere and Thibet, are like nothing in the world but an Arabian Night which we feel to be true. The chiefs, the priests, the monasteries, the troops, the glorious country so misused by man, the wretched people, an English lady, young and pretty, travelling all alone in the wildest part on pony-back, all pass before us in a series of living photographs. We have room, however, for one quotation only:--       \"The women are atrociously ugly, and screech like the      witches in _Macbeth_,--so much so, that when the agent asked      me to give them a rupee or two, I felt it my duty to refuse,      firmly but respectfully, on the ground that it would be      encouraging ugliness.       \"I am the luckiest dog unhung (he concludes) to have got      into Cashmere. I fancy I am the first officer of our army      who has been here save the few who have come officially.\"  Colonel Lawrence was not the man to let his young friend's powers of work rust, so on their return we find Hodson set to build the famous Hill Asylum for white children at Subathoo.  We may as well notice at once, in this early stage of his career, the man's honest training of himself in all ways, great and small, to take his place, and do his work in his world-battle; how he faces all tasks, however unwonted, ill-paid, or humble, which seem to be helpful; how he casts off all habits, however pleasant or harmless, which may prove hindrances. And this he does with no parade or fine sentiment,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39448"],["title","Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India (#2)"],["body"," simply, almost unconsciously, often with a sort of apology which is humorously pathetic. For example, when set to work on the Asylum, he writes:--       \"Colonel Lawrence seems determined I shall have nothing to      stop me, for his invariable reply to every question is, 'Act      on your own judgment,' 'Do what you think right,' 'I give      you _carte blanche_ to act in my name, and draw on my      funds,' and so forth.\"  Which confidence is worthily bestowed. Hodson sets to work, forgetting all professional etiquette, and giving up society for the time.       \"Cutting trees down, getting lime burnt, bricks made, planks      sawn up, the ground got ready, and then watching the work      foot by foot; showing this \"nigger\" how to lay his bricks,      another the proper proportions of a beam, another the      construction of a door, and to the several artisans the      mysteries of a screw, a nail, a hinge. You cannot say to a      man, 'Make me a wall or a door,' but you must, with your own      hands, measure out his work, teach him to saw away here, to      plane there, or drive such a nail, or insinuate such a      suspicion of glue. And when it comes to be considered that      this is altogether new work to me, and has to be excuded by      cogitation on the spot, so as to give an answer to every      inquirer, you may understand the amount of personal exertion      and attention required for the work.\"  Again, a few months later, November, 1847,--       \"I am in a high queer-looking native house among the ruins      of this old stronghold of the Pathans, with orders 'to make      a good road from Lahore to the Sutlej, distance forty      miles,' in as brief a space as possible. On the      willing-to-be-generally-useful principle, this is all very      well, and one gets used to turning one's hand to everything,      but certainly (but for circumstances over which I had no      control) I always labored under the impression that I knew      nothing at all about the matter. However, Colonel Lawrence      walked into my room promiscuously one morning, and said,      'Oh, Hodson, we have agreed that you must take in hand the      road to Ferozepore. You can start in a day or two;' and      _here I am_.\"  Again, in January, 1848, he has been sent out surveying.       \"My present _rôle_ is to survey a part of the country lying      along the left bank of the Ravee and below the hills, and I      am daily and all day at work with compasses and chain, pen      and pencil, following streams, diving into valleys,      burrowing into hills, to complete my work. I need hardly      remark, that, having never attempted anything of the kind      hitherto, it is bothering at first.\"  Again, in April, 1848, he has been set to hear all manner of cases, civil, criminal, and revenue, in the Lahore Court.       \"The duty is of vast importance, and I sometimes feel a half      sensation of modesty at being set down to administer justice      in such matters so early, and without previous training. A      little practice, patience, and reflection, settle most cases      to one's satisfaction however; and one must be content with      substantial justice as distinguished from technical law.\"  Again, in a letter to his brother,--       \"Did I tell you, by-the-bye, that I abjured tobacco when I      left England, and that I have never been tempted by even a      night's _al fresco_ to resume the delusive habit? Nor have I      told you (because I despaired of your believing it) that I      have declined from the paths of virtue in respect of beer      also, these two years past, seldom or never tasting that      once idolized stimulant!\"  We have no space to comment; and can only hope that any gallant young oarsman or cricketer bound for India who may read this, will have the courage to follow Hodson's example, if he finds himself the better for abstinence, notwithstanding the fascination of the drink itself, and the cherished associations which twine round the pewter. My dear boys, remember, as Hodson did, that if you are to get on well in India it will be owing, physically speaking, to your digestions.  These glimpses will enable the reader to picture to himself how Hodson, now Assistant to the Resident at Lahore, as well as second in command of the Guides, was spending his time between the first and the final Sikh war. Let him throw in this description of the duties of \"The Guides\":--       \"The grand object of the corps is to train a body of men in      peace to be efficient in war; to be not only acquainted with      localities, roads, rivers, hills, ferries, and passes, but      have a good idea of the produce and supplies available in      any part of the country; to give _accurate_ information, not      running open-mouthed to say that 10,000 horsemen and a      thousand guns are coming, (in true native style,) but to      stop to see whether it may not really be only a common cart      and a few wild horsemen who are kicking up all the dust; to      call twenty-five by its right name, and not say _fifty_ for      short, as most natives do. This of course wants a great deal      of careful instruction and attention. Beyond this, the      officers should give a tolerably correct sketch and report      of any country through which they may pass, be _au fait_ at      routes and means of feeding troops, and above all (and here      you come close upon political duties) keep an eye on the      doings of the neighbors, and the state of the country, so as      to be able to give such information as may lead to any      outbreak being nipped in the bud.\"  The reader will probably now be of opinion that the young lieutenant, willing to make himself generally useful, and given to locomotion, will be not unlikely to turn out a very tough nut for the Sikhs to crack when they have quite made up their minds to risk another fight; and that time is rapidly drawing near. All through the spring and early summer months there are tumults and risings, which tell of a wide conspiracy. Hodson, after a narrow escape of accompanying Agnew to Mooltan, is scouring the country backwards and forwards, catching rebels and picking up news. In September, the Sikhs openly join the rebel Moolraj. General Whish is obliged to raise the siege of Mooltan; the grand struggle between the cow-killers and cow-worshippers on the banks of the Chenab has begun.  We wish we had space to follow Hodson and his Guides through the series of daring exploits by which the Doab was cleared, and which so enraged the Sikhs that \"party after party were sent to polish me off, and at one time I couldn't stir about the country without having bullets sent at my head from every bush and wall.\" He was attached to Wheeler's brigade during the greater part of the struggle, but joined the army of the Punjaub in time for the battle of Gujerat, which finished the war, and at which he and Lumsden his commander, and Lake of the Engineers, are mentioned in Lord Gough's despatch as most active in conveying orders throughout the action. We cannot however resist one story. The old Brigadier, making all haste to join the grand army, where he expects to get a division, leaves two forts at Kulallwala and 4000 unbeaten rebels in his rear. He is ordered back to account for them, whereupon Brigadier turns sulky. Hodson urges him to move on like lightning and crush them, but \"he would not, and began to make short marches, so I was compelled to outmanoeuvre him by a bold stroke.\" Accordingly he starts with 100 of his Guides, when twenty-five miles from Kulallwala, and fairly frightens a doubtful sirdar, \"preparing munitions of war, mounting guns, and looking saucy,\" out of his fort. Whereupon the Sikhs abandon a neighboring fort, and the road to Kulallwala is open without a shot fired.       \"In the morning I marched with my little party towards the      enemy, sending back a messenger to the Brigadier to say that      I was close to the place, and that if he did not come on      sharp they would run away or overwhelm me. He was dreadfully      angry, but came on like a good boy! When within a mile or so      of the fort, I halted my party to allow his column to get up      nearer, and as soon as I could see it, moved on quietly. The      _ruse_ told to perfection: thinking they had only 100 men      and myself to deal with, the Sikhs advanced in strength,      thirty to one, to meet me, with colors flying and drums      beating. Just then a breeze sprung up, the dust blew aside,      and the long line of horsemen coming on rapidly behind my      party burst upon their senses. They turned instantly, and      made for the fort; so, leaving my men to advance quietly      after them, I galloped up to the Brigadier, pointed out the      flying Sikhs, explained their position, and begged him to      charge them. He melted from his wrath, and told two      regiments of Irregulars to follow my guidance. On we went      at the gallop, cut in amongst the fugitives, and punished      them fearfully.\"  \"The Brigadier has grown quite active, and _very fond of me_ since that day at Kulallwala, though he had the wit to see how brown I had done him by making him march two marches in one.\" It is certainly to the Brigadier's credit that he does seem to have appreciated his provoking \"Guide,\" for he mentions him in the highest terms in despatch after despatch, and at the close of the war comforts him thus: \"Had your name been Hay or Ramsay, no honors, no appointments, no distinctions would have been considered too great to mark the services you have rendered to Government.\"  The war ended, the Punjaub is annexed, and Hodson with it, who loses all his appointments and returns to \"the Guides.\"  He feels sore of course at the loss of his occupation and position, but sticks to his drill-sergeant's work now that there is nothing higher to do, and pities from his heart the dozens of regimental officers at Peshawur who"]]]
