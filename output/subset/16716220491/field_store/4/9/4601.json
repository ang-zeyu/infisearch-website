Such high temperatures rarely occurred early in the day, however, so that removal of the animals from traps between eight and ten a. m. almost eliminated mortality. Those individuals captured in the night were not yet harmed, but it was already hot enough to reduce the activity of the voles and prevent further captures until late afternoon. When it was necessary to run trap lines earlier, the traps were closed in the morning and reset in late afternoon.  Reactions of small mammals to live-traps and the effects of prebaiting were described by Chitty and Kempson (1949). In general, the results of my trapping program fit their conclusions. Each of my trapping periods, consisting of seven to ten consecutive days, showed a gradual increase in the number of captures per day for the first three days, with a tendency for the number of captures to level off during the remainder of the period. Leaving the traps baited and locked open for a day or two before a trapping period tended to increase the catch during the first few days of the period without any corresponding increase during the latter part of the period. Initial reluctance of the voles to enter the traps decreased as the traps became familiar parts of their environment.  At the beginning of the study the traps were set in a grid with intervals of 20 feet. The interval was increased to 30 feet after three months because a larger area could thus be covered and no loss in trapping efficiency was apparent. The traps were set within a three foot radius of the numbered stations, and were locked and left in position between trapping periods.  Each individual that was captured was weighed and sexed. The resulting data were recorded in a field notebook together with the location of the capture and other pertinent information. Newly captured voles were marked by toe-clipping as described by Fitch (1952:32). Information was transferred from the field notebook to a file which contained a separate card for each individual trapped.  In the course of the program of live-trapping, many marked voles were recaptured one or more times. Most frequently captured among the females were number 8 (33 captures in seven months) and number 73 (30 captures in eight months). Among the males, number 37 (21 captures in six months) and number 62 (21 captures in eight months) were most frequently taken. The mean number of captures per individual was 3.6. For females, the mean number of captures per individual was 3.8 and for males it was 3.4. Females seemingly acquired the habit of entering traps more readily than did males. No correlation between any seasonally variable factor and the number of captures per individual was apparent. To a large degree, the formation of trap habits by voles was an individual peculiarity.  In order to study the extent of utilization of various habitats by _Microtus_, a number of areas were sampled with Museum Special snap-traps. These traps were set in linear series approximately 25 feet apart. The number of traps used varied with the size of the area sampled and ranged from 20 to 75. The lines were maintained for three nights. The catch was assumed to indicate the relative abundance of _Microtus_ and certain other small mammals but no attempt to estimate actual population densities from snap-trapping data was made. In August, 1952, when the live-trapping program was concluded, the study areas were trapped out. The efficiency of the live-trapping procedure was emphasized by the absence of unmarked individuals among the 45 voles caught at that time.  Further details of the methods and procedures used are described in the appropriate sections which follow.     HABITAT   Although other species of the genus _Microtus_, especially _M. pennsylvanicus_, have been studied intensively in regard to habitat preference (Blair, 1940:149; 1948:404-405; Bole, 1939:69; Eadie, 1953; Gunderson, 1950:32-37; Hamilton, 1940:425-426; Hatt, 1930:521-526; Townsend, 1935:96-101) little has been reported concerning the habitat preferences of _M. ochrogaster_. Black (1937:200) reported that, in Kansas, _Microtus_ (mostly _M. ochrogaster_) preferred damp situations. _M. ochrogaster_ was studied in western Kansas by Brown (1946:453) and Wooster (1935:352; 1936:396) and found to be almost restricted to the little-bluestem association of the mixed prairie (Albertson, 1937:522). Brumwell (1951:213), in a survey of the Fort Leavenworth Military Reservation, found that _M. ochrogaster_ preferred sedge and bluegrass meadows but occurred also in a sedge-willow association. Dice (1922:46) concluded that the presence of green herbage, roots or tubers for use as a water source throughout the year was a necessity for _M. ochrogaster_. Goodpastor and Hoffmeister (1952:370) found _M. ochrogaster_ to be abundant in a damp meadow of a lake margin in Tennessee. In a study made on and near the campus of the University of Kansas, within a few miles of the area concerned in the present report, Jameson (1947:132) found that voles used grassy areas in spring and summer, but that in the autumn, when the grass began to dry, they moved to clumps of Japanese honeysuckle (_Lonicera japonica_) and stayed among the shrubbery throughout the winter. Johnson (1926:267, 270) found _M. ochrogaster_ only in uncultivated areas where long grass furnished adequate cover. He stated that the entire biotic association, rather than any single factor, was the key to the distribution of the voles. None of these reports described an intensive study of the habitat of voles, but the data presented indicate that voles are characteristic of grassland and that _M. ochrogaster_ can occupy drier areas than those used by _M. pennsylvanicus_. Otherwise, the preferred habitats of the two species seem to be much the same.  In the investigation described here I attempted to evaluate various types of habitats on the basis of their carrying capacity at different stages of the annual cycle and in different years. The habitats were studied and described in terms of yield, cover and species composition. The areas upon which live-trapping was done were studied most intensively.  These two areas, herein designated as House Field and Quarry Field, were both occupied by voles throughout the period of study. Population density varied considerably, however (Fig. 5). Both of these areas were dominated by _Bromus inermis_, and, in clipped samples taken in June, 1951, this grass constituted 67 per cent of the vegetation on House Field and 54 per cent of the vegetation on Quarry Field. Estimates made at other times in 1950, 1951 and 1952 always confirmed the dominance of smooth brome and approximated the above percentages. Parts of House Field had nearly pure stands of this grass. Those traps set in spots where there was little vegetation other than the dominant grass caught fewer voles than traps set in spots with a more varied cover. _Poa pratensis_ formed an understory over most of the area studied, especially on House Field, and attained local dominance in shaded spots on both fields. The higher basal cover provided by the _Poa_ understory seemed to support a vole population larger than those that occurred in areas lacking the bluegrass. Disturbed situations, such as roadsides, were characterized by the dominance of _Bromus japonicus_. This grass occurred also in low densities over much of the study area among _B. inermis_. Other grasses present included _Triodia flava_, common in House Field, but with only spotty distribution in Quarry Field; _Elymus canadensis_, distributed over both areas in spotty fashion and almost always showing evidence of use by voles and other small mammals; _Aristida oligantha_ and _Bouteloua curtipendula_, both more common on the higher and drier Quarry Field; _Panicum virgatum_, _Setaria_ spp., especially on disturbed areas; and three bluestems, _Andropogon gerardi_, _A. virginicus_ and _A. scoparius_. The bluestems increased noticeably during the study period (even though grasses in general were being replaced by woody plants) and they furnished a preferred habitat for voles because of their high yield of edible foliage and relatively heavy debris which provided shelter.  On House Field the most common forbs were _Vernonia baldwini_, _Verbena stricta_ and _Solanum carolinense_. On Quarry Field, _Solidago_ spp. and _Asclepias_ spp. were also abundant. All of them seemed to be used by the voles for food during the early stages of growth, when they were tender and succulent. The fruits of the horse nettle (_Solanum carolinense_) were also eaten. The forbs themselves did not provide cover dense enough to constitute good vole habitat. Mixed in a grass dominated association they nevertheless raised the carrying capacity above that of a pure stand of grass. Other forbs noted often enough to be considered common on both House Field and Quarry Field included _Carex gravida_, observed frequently in House Field and less often in Quarry Field; _Amorpha canescens_, more common in Quarry Field; _Tradescantia bracteata_, _Capsella bursapastoris_, _Oxalis violacea_, _Euphorbia marginata_, _Convolvulus arvensis_, _Lithospermum arvense_, _Teucrium canadense_, _Physalis longifolia_, _Phytolacca americana_, _Plantago major_, _Ambrosia trifida_, _A. artemisiifolia_, _Helianthus annuus_, _Cirsium altissimum_ and _Taraxacum erythrospermum_. Both areas were being invaded from one side by forest-edge vegetation; the woody plants noted included _Prunus americana_, _Rubus argutus_, _Rosa setigera_, _Cornus drummondi_, _Symphoricarpus orbiculatus_, _Populus deltoides_ and _Gleditsia triacanthos_.  In House Field the herbaceous vegetation was much more lush than in Quarry Field and woody plants and weeds were more abundant. A graveled and heavily used road along one edge of House Field, leading to the Reservation Headquarters, was a barrier which voles rarely crossed. A little-used dirt road crossing the trapping plot in Quarry Field"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39396"],["title","A Population Study of the Prairie Vole (Microtus ochrogaster) in Northeastern (#2)"],["body","a less effective barrier. The disturbed areas bordering the roads were likewise little used and tended to reinforce the effects of the roads as barriers. There were almost pure stands of _Bromus japonicus_ along both roads. No mammal of any kind was taken in traps set where this grass was dominant.  Because seasonal changes in vole density followed the curve for rate of growth of the complex of grasses on the Reservation, and because years in which there was a sparse growth of plants due to dry weather showed a decrease in the density of voles, the relationships between productivity of plants and vole population levels on the two study areas were investigated. In both fields the composition of the plant cover was similar, and the differences were chiefly quantitative. In June, 1951, ten square-meter quadrats were clipped on each of the areas to be studied. The clippings from each were dried in the sun and weighed. From Quarry Field the mean yield amounted to 1513 ± 302 lbs. per acre; while from House Field the yield was 2351 ± 190 lbs. per acre (Table 1). Using experience gained in making these samples, I periodically estimated the relative productivity of the two areas. House Field was from 1.5 to 3 times as productive as Quarry Field during the growing seasons of 1951 and 1952. Although House Field, being more productive, usually supported a larger population of voles than Quarry Field the reverse was true at the time of the clipping (Fig. 5).    TABLE 1.

In June, 1951, the population of voles and cotton rats on Quarry Field was increasing rapidly whereas in House Field that trend was reversed. The trends were reflected by the percentages of immature individuals in the two populations and by the ratios of the June, 1951, densities to the March, 1951, densities (Table 1). Perhaps the density curve was determined in part by factors inherent in the population and, to that extent, was fluctuating independently of the environment (Errington, 1946:153).  The flood in 1951 reduced the population of voles and obscured the normal seasonal trends. Although House Field produced a heavier crop of vegetation, Quarry Field produced a larger crop of rodents, chiefly _Microtus_ and _Sigmodon_. In House Field, however, the ratio of _Sigmodon_ to _Microtus_ was notably higher. Presumably the cotton rats competed with the voles and exerted a depressing effect on their numbers. The intensity of the effect seemed to depend on the abundance of both species. That this depressing effect involved more than direct competition for plant food was suggested by the fact that in House Field, with a heavy crop of vegetation and a seemingly high carrying capacity for both herbivorous rodents, the biomass of voles, and of all rodents combined, were lower than in Quarry Field which had less vegetation and fewer cotton rats. The relationships between voles and cotton rats are discussed further later in this report.  When the centers of activity (Hayne, 1949b) of individual voles were plotted it was seen that there was a shift in the places of high density of voles on the trapping areas. This shift seemed to be related to the advance of the forest edge with such woody plants as _Rhus_ and _Symphoricarpos_ and young trees invading the area. These shifts were clearly shown when the distribution of activity centers on both areas in June, 1951, was compared with the distribution in June, 1952 (Fig. 1). The shift was gradual and the more or less steady progress could be observed by comparing the monthly trapping records. It was perhaps significant that during the summers the centers of activity were less concentrated than during the winter. The shift of voles away from the woods was more nearly evident in winter when the voles were driven into areas of denser ground cover, which provided better shelter.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Progressive encroachment of woody vegetation onto study areas, and the accompanying shift of the centers of populations of voles. Activity centers of individuals were calculated as described by Hayne (1949b) and are indicated by dots. The cross-hatched areas show places where the vegetation was influenced by the shade of woody plants.]  From 1948 to 1950 and again in 1952 and 1953 I trapped in various habitat types in a mixed prairie near Hays, Kansas. Before the great drought of the thirties, _Microtus ochrogaster_ was the most common species of small mammal in that area. Since 1948, at least, it has been taken only rarely and from a few habitats. No voles have been taken from grazed sites. In a relict area, voles were trapped in a lowland association dominated by big bluestem. Since 1948 only one vole has been trapped in the more extensive hillside association characterized by a mixture of big bluestem, little bluestem and side-oats grama. None was taken in the upland parts of the relict area where buffalo grass and blue grama dominated the association.  In the pastured areas there are nine livestock exclosures established by the Department of Botany of Ft. Hays Kansas State College. These exclosures included many types of habitat found in the mixed prairie. All of these exclosures were trapped and voles were taken in only two of them. An exclosure situated near a pond, on low ground producing a luxuriant growth of big bluestem and western wheat grass, has supported voles in 1948, 1949, 1952 and 1953. An upland exclosure containing only short grasses also supported a few voles in 1953.  An examination of the nature of the various plant associations of the mixed prairie indicates that yield of grasses, amount of debris and basal cover may be critical factors in the distribution of voles. The association to which the voles seemed to belong was the lowland association. Hopkins _et al_ (1952:401; 409) reported the yield of grasses from the lowland to be approximately twice as great as from the hillside and upland in most years. Probably equally important to the voles was the fact that debris accumulation in the lowland was approximately five times as great as in the upland and approximately 2.5 times as great as on the hillside (Hopkins, unpublished data). The unexpected presence of voles in the short grass exclosure was probably due to two factors. In ungrazed short grass, basal cover may reach 90 per cent (Albertson, 1937:545), thus providing excellent cover for voles. Also, the ungrazed exclosure had greater yield and a thicker mat of debris than the grazed short grass surrounding it and was thus a relatively good habitat, although it did not compare favorably with the lowland type.  Samples of the populations of various areas, obtained by snap-trapping, gave further information regarding the types of vegetation preferred by voles. Voles were taken in all ungrazed and unmown grasslands trapped in eastern Kansas, although some of the areas were not used at all seasons of the year nor in years having a low population of _Microtus_. Reithro Field, similar to Quarry Field in its general aspect, had a heavy population of voles in the spring and summer of 1951, a time when voles were generally abundant. On the same area the population of small mammals was sampled in the summer of 1949 and, though occasional sign of voles was seen, not one vole was trapped. Later trapping, in the spring and summer of 1952, also failed to catch any voles and Fitch (1953, _in litt._) caught none in several trapping attempts in 1953. These later times were characterized by a general scarcity of voles. Reithro Field was drier, with less dense vegetation, than the two main study areas and had larger percentages of little bluestem (_Andropogon scoparius_) and side-oats grama (_Bouteloua curtipendula_) and smaller percentages of _Vernonia_, _Verbena_, _Solanum_ and _Solidago_.  Various species of foxtail (_Setaria_) dominated most roadsides in the vicinity of the Reservation. Voles almost always used these strips of grass but never were abundant in them. Voles were taken near the margin of a weedy field, fallow since 1948, but there was none in the middle of the field. Most individuals were confined to the grassy areas around the field and made only occasional forays away from the edge. The dam of a small pond on the Reservation and low ground near the water were used by _Microtus_ at all times. In the summer of 1949 no voles were taken anywhere on the Reservation but their runways were more abundant around the pond than in the other places examined. Of all the areas studied in the summer of 1949, only the pond area had been protected from grazing in previous years. _Polygonum coccineum_ was the most prominent plant in the pond edge association. A few voles were trapped in large openings in the woods, where a"]]]
