Underlying these requests there appears to be a feeling that first-hand accounts of enterprises in the Great War should be of some value towards preserving that spirit which rallied all classes of individuals in the British Empire, in the Allied Countries, and in the United States of America, to the common cause of upholding civilisation in the face of danger.  That opinion, indeed, has been openly stated to the author in Great Britain, by leading members of the educational profession and of the Church, by naval and military officers and others.  Opinions of a similar type also have been received from the United States, where, during a recent series of visits to many of the larger cities, the author personally experienced that solid friendship for Great Britain which is sometimes hidden beneath surface irritations of a political nature.  Misunderstandings must occasionally arise between communities and between the members of any single community; they readily take root and develop into serious argument where the existence of a _common cause_ is forgotten.  For that reason the author feels that the above-mentioned opinions are not without foundation.  Whilst attempting to show that co-operation between the several units of a fighting force {xvi} and confidence between superiors and subordinates are important factors towards success in war, he has made this humble endeavour to induce the belief that co-operation and confidence in other walks of life are no less necessary.  There is danger of this blocking enterprise being allotted a false position in the contemporary histories of the late war owing to the somewhat prevalent custom of describing war operations with little reference to the various considerations, factors, and events which gave them birth.  The man-in-the-street is sometimes carried away by enthusiasm or despondency, as the case may be, when unexpected events occur during hostilities; he is apt to give little thought to the \"why\" and \"wherefore\" of the occurrences.  That fact has been exemplified clearly enough with respect to this particular event, for, on all sides, one heard the public verdict, given in the colloquial vulgarism of the period, that the affair was a fine \"stunt.\" The word \"stunt,\" as unmusical to the ear as it was offensive to those concerned in the operations, has been defined as \"a voluntary act, spectacular, usually unnecessary, sometimes involving risk, and designed to attract attention.\" However, the man-in-the-street meant well, and, after all, could justifiably plead that his lack of education on naval matters was to blame.  The author has therefore addressed this book to the man-in-the-street, and has endeavoured to \"put him wise,\" as our cousins across the water are in the habit of remarking.  The official despatches dealing with the blocking operations on the Flanders coast were published early {xvii} in 1919, and, as far as despatches can go, gave a splendid account of the enterprise forming the subject of this book.  But despatches are strictly limited in length and necessarily deal more with cold-blooded statements of fact than with psychological aspects.  When one reads despatches of the great leaders of the past concerning the operations in their campaigns one cannot fail to notice the almost complete absence of any reference to the moral factor in war.  Yet Napoleon himself declared, \"The moral is to the physical as three is to one.\"  Material results can easily be gauged under peace conditions, whereas moral effect on human nature in war is only discoverable from one's own war experiences, which are necessarily limited, and from the experiences of others as set forth in the historical records of past wars.  It was partly for that reason, presumably, that Napoleon studied the campaigns of CÃ¦sar and Hannibal although their instruments of war were long since out of date.  The usual reasons for the omission of the moral factors from despatches are twofold.  Firstly, the leader from whom the despatch emanates may consider it inadvisable to publish his preconceived ideas as to the eventual effect of the operations on the morale of the enemy; this concealment is especially necessary if the despatch is published before the declaration of peace.  Secondly, the writer of the despatch is often unaware, at the time of writing, of the effect already obtained against the enemy's morale; such effects may not be discoverable for many months after the operations have been concluded.  Under certain circumstances it may also be temporarily {xviii} inadvisable to present to the enemy, through the medium of despatches, information concerning psychological effects on one's own personnel.  These omissions, therefore, must not be taken to infer that the moral factors were ignored.  It is clear, then, that post-war accounts of operations may be far from superfluous whether considered from the point of view of the man-in-the-street or that of the student of war.  Without some conception of the strategical situation arising from the German occupation of the Flanders coast it would be difficult to grasp the true nature of the enterprise described herein.  An examination of the strategical outlook alone, however, would be insufficient.  The geographical and hydrographical, and even the meteorological, situations largely influenced the choice of tactical methods to be pursued for the attainment of the object in view.  It is therefore important to consider the situation from these various standpoints in some detail.  The book has been divided into two parts.  Part I deals with the Situation, the Object, the General Plan for the attainment of the Object, the Preparatory Work involved, and the various occurrences up to the eve of the Attack.  Part II describes the events which occurred during the operation itself, and includes some consideration of both the material and moral results of the enterprise and the lessons to be drawn therefrom.  For the illustrations the author is much indebted to the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Imperial War Museum, and Press, to whom he makes this grateful acknowledgment.  {xix}  With regard to the personal side of the story, it may be as well to point out that many of the officers and men concerned were mentioned in the official despatch; that fact lessens one of the difficulties attached to the author's task.  A compromise between the purely impersonal attitude and the very natural desire to render full justice to each individual, regardless of the reader's patience, has been aimed at.  The author trusts that the reader will be tolerant of omission and repetition, and will forgive the rather obvious shortcomings of a literary nature which, alas, appear all too frequently in the book.

THE GERMAN BASES   IN FLANDERS.  THE CONCEPTION OF THE PLAN.  The main function of a navy in war is that of obtaining the command of the sea.  The purpose for which such \"command\" is desired is the utilisation of the sea-lines of communication and the denial of the same to the enemy.  Soon after the commencement of the war in 1914 the sea-lines of communication across the English Channel assumed considerable, if not paramount, importance for the transfer of personnel and material from Britain to the Allied forces in France.  It was equally incumbent on the navy to maintain the trans-Atlantic and other lines of communication along which the necessities of life and war were carried to the Allies in all theatres of war.  [Sidenote: The Strategical Situation]  The first step towards obtaining \"command of the sea\" is the removal of the obstacles which stand in one's way.  In this particular case the main obstacle (admittedly constructed for the purpose) was the German High Seas Fleet.  Thus the first duty of the British Grand Fleet was that of destroying the {4} so-called High Seas Fleet, or, if destruction was found to be impracticable, of reducing it to inactivity.  The German Fleet was fully alive to that fact, and, almost throughout the war, hid themselves away in their naval bases under the protection of their coast defences.  Thus, as events showed, the High Seas Fleet did not prove to be a very serious obstacle to our Command of the sea; but, and this fact is easily forgotten, we could not _foresee_ the continuance of their ineptitude and lack of spirit.  The German submarines, however, were a formidable obstacle, indeed.  It is unnecessary to reiterate what is already common knowledge on that point.  Submarines, by their nature, have certain limitations.  Except in the case of the submarine cruisers, which only materialised in the latter part of the war, such craft are considerably hampered in their movements by their comparatively small radius of action.  Owing to the geographical situation of Germany, her submarines were forced to expend an important percentage of their fuel during the outward and homeward voyages between their bases and the trade routes.  This expenditure cannot merely be judged by the distances which had to be traversed; the expenditure of fuel in the submarine bears some relation to the _whole circumstances_ of the voyage.  The endurance of the personnel is another important factor, and is similarly affected by the circumstances under which they are employed. For instance, in waters patrolled by enemy vessels, high speed must always be readily available and the strain on the personnel, consequent on the danger of sudden attack from surface craft, aircraft, or other submarines, {5} to say nothing of the presence of mine-fields, is increased.  Thus the longer the passage that the German submarines were forced to undertake in comparatively narrow and dangerous waters--such as the North Sea--the less work could they do on our more important trade routes.  That statement is closely connected with the subject of this book.  It did not require very much intelligence on the part of the German Admiralty to realise that the possession of bases on the Flanders coast would greatly facilitate their submarine campaign owing to the consequent reduction of the voyages to and from the trans-Atlantic, or Channel, trade routes.  Flanders was therefore used, as will be explained later in detail, to provide advanced bases for German submarines.  The coast of Flanders lent itself to other naval uses.  In addition to the _guerre-de-course_ tactics of the enemy--i.e., the direct attack on Allied merchant vessels--it was always open to Germany to take their whole main fleet to sea for the purpose of seeking advantageous conditions for bringing a portion of our Grand Fleet to action.  Movements of modern fleets under war conditions necessitate the use of various types of small craft to precede them--e.g., mine-sweepers for clearing channels for the fleet to pass through, destroyers for supporting the mine-sweepers and for driving back the enemy's small craft, light cruisers for scouting purposes, etc.  Mine-sweepers and torpedo craft, by virtue of their small size, are unable to keep the sea for long periods.  It will therefore be realised that, in the event of the High Seas Fleet putting to sea for operations in southern waters, the Flanders coast provided {6} Germany with an advanced base from which their light craft could operate.  The German torpedo craft based in Flanders, therefore, would be able to serve a double purpose, viz., that already mentioned and that of attacking our patrol craft, our coast and our merchant vessels when opportunity offered.  The mine-sweepers could also serve a double purpose in that they were required to sweep channels for the ingress and egress of submarines based in Flanders whilst being suitably placed for sweeping duties in advance of the main fleet.  That Flanders was also suitable for aircraft bases is as well known as it is obvious; but it may not be generally understood that such aircraft would also be of special value to the main fleet under the conditions stated above. Thus, to sum up, the occupation of the Flanders coast by the German sea forces would be of treble value--to provide, firstly, a base for the submarines employed on commerce destruction; secondly, a base for the advanced flotillas and aircraft operating in conjunction with the main fleet in the event of the latter coming south; and, thirdly, a base from which to attack our southern coasts or sea-patrols and from which to indulge in air raids against British and French territory.  The foregoing consideration of the possible uses of Flanders to the German Navy shows the inherent value of an advanced base in that locality; the intrinsic value obviously depended upon the existence of suitable harbours for use as bases.  Let us now examine the geographical situation.  [Illustration: CHART SHOWING THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF DOVER, ZEEBRUGGE, HELIGOLAND, AND THE EXITS FROM THE NORTH SEA.]  In the latter part of 1917 the Flanders coast, as far westward as Nieuport, was in the possession of the {7} Germans.  The northern extremity of the line separating the German and Allied armies was situated approximately on the Yser Canal, which emanates from Nieuport harbour.  The latter was dominated by the gun-fire of both armies; its use was, therefore, denied to both.  The only other harbours on the coast of Flanders were Ostende, Blankenberghe, and Zeebrugge.  These will be described in some detail presently.  [Sidenote: The Flanders Coast]  The Flanders coast consists mainly of flat country barely elevated above the level of the sea.  Sand-hills along the shore act as a barrier between the sea and the land.  Parallel to the shore the tidal current runs to and fro with considerable velocity.  The tendency for the tidal current to wash away the sand from the shore is partially countered by the use of groynes, such as are similarly used to maintain our own coastline in many parts of England.  Although the groynes on the Flanders coast are carried well out into the sea--they are often 100 yards in length--the movement of sand along the coast is very considerable, and, as will be explained later, has a strong influence on the harbour situation in that locality.  The approaches to the coast are beset with shoals reaching to a distance of eight miles from the land.  These shoals have always provided serious obstacles to navigation.  During times of peace the charts of this locality had been kept corrected by virtue of continual surveying.  The shoals were frequently moving and new shoals appeared from time to time.  The channels required almost constant dredging. For obvious reasons during the occupation of Flanders by the Germans it was not possible for the Allies to continue either the surveying or the dredging.  {8}  Before the war navigation off this coast required the use of many facilities such as buoys and lighthouses.  At the best of times buoys are not very dependable as navigational aids owing to their tendency to break away in heavy weather or to drag their anchors along the bottom. Their positions need to be \"fixed\" from time to time by means of angles to shore objects, or by methods of astronomical observation, and then compared with the positions shown on the charts.  Lighthouses, however, unless they are of the small type without lighthouse-keepers, are more efficient aids to the navigator.  During the war the lighthouses east of Nieuport were only used by the Germans during short periods when specially required for their own craft; the majority of the buoys were withdrawn and the remainder were moved to new positions which were frequently altered to prevent the Allies from making use of them. Thus, during the war, the charts available to the Allies were very"]]]
