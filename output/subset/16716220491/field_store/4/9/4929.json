We sat austerely in two rows, gazing solemnly at the blank wall opposite us, while Doctor Chirnside worked his will upon his flock.  Doctor Chirnside is a tall, silver-haired, and pugnacious old gentleman of about seventy.  He fears God, and exhibits considerable deference towards Tom Birnie; but he regards the rest of his congregation as dirt.  (At least, that is how we feel in his presence.) This morning he entered the pulpit precisely on the stroke of eleven, in deference to the Laird’s well-known prejudices on the subject of punctuality—besides, I happened to know that he was coming on to lunch at Baronrigg after service—and, having been securely locked in by James Dunshie, adjusted his spectacles and gazed fiercely at some late comers. Then he gave out the opening psalm.  In Craigfoot Parish Church we always sing the opening psalm unaccompanied.  It is true that we possess a small organ, but that instrument is still regarded with such deep suspicion by some of the older members of the congregation that we only employ it to accompany hymns—which, as is well known, have little effect one way or the other upon one’s ultimate salvation.  But we take no risks with the Psalms of David.  These are offered without meretricious trimmings of any kind, save that furnished by the tuning-fork of Andrew Kilninver, our esteemed auctioneer, estate agent, and precentor.  Accordingly, when Doctor Chirnside took up his psalter, the young lady at the organ leaned back nonchalantly; Andrew Kilninver stirred importantly in his seat, tuning-fork in hand; and the choir—highly scented shop-girls and farmers’ daughters, assisted by overheated young men in Sunday \"blacks\" and choker collars—braced themselves with the air of people upon whose shoulders the credit, and maybe redemption, of a whole parish rests.  There is something peculiarly majestic about the manner in which Doctor Chirnside opens his morning service.  I believe that, in his view, the unaccompanied psalm is the one relic of pure orthodoxy preserved by him against the modern passion for hymns, organs, printed prayers, anthems, and \"brighter worship\" generally. That graceless young ruffian, Roy Birnie, gives an imitation of his performance which is celebrated throughout the parish.  It runs something like this:  \"Ha-humm!  Brethren, we will commence the public worrship of God, this Lord’s Day, by singing to His praise part of the Seven Hundred and Forty-Ninth Psalm.  Psalm Seven Hundred and Forty-Nine.  Ha-humm!  The Church is full cold.  Will Mr. John Buncle, of Sandpits, kindly rise in his pew and adjust the open window west of him?  (_Imitation of Mr. John Buncle, petrified with confusion, adjusting the window._)  We will commence at verrse One Hundred and Seventy-Nine:      _I, like a bottle, have been_     _With Thy great maircy filled,_     _Oh, hold me up, hold Thou me up,_     _That I may not be spilled!_  And so on until the end of the Psalm.  Psalm Seven Hundred and Forty-Nine.  The Seven Hundred and Forty-Ninth Psalm.  _Ping_!  _Ping_! _Ping_!  (_The last is supposed to be Kilninver getting to work with his tuning-fork._)  Tune, Winchester, ’_I, like a bottle..._’\"  I am a devout person, but I am afraid it does sound something like that.  However, one feels less inclined to smile when the actual singing of the psalm commences. The Metrical Psalms, sung in unison, without accompaniment, and with strong, rugged voices predominating, are Scottish history.  They bring back the days when people did not sing them in churches, but on hillsides in remote fastnesses, at services conducted by a man with a price on his head, guarded by sentries lying prone upon the skyline, on the look-out for Claverhouse and his troopers.  That is why I, coming of the stock I do, like to hear the opening psalm at Craigfoot.  The start, as a rule, is not all what it might be, for the Scots are a slow-moving race; and naturally it takes a little time to catch up with Andrew Kilninver and his comparatively nimble crew. But about the middle of the second verse we draw together, and the unsophisticated rhymes, firmly welded now with the grand old melody, go rolling upwards and outwards through the open door and windows, over one of the fairest and richest farming districts in the world:      _They drop upon the pastures wide,_       _That do in deserts lie;_     _The little hills on every side_       _Rejoice right pleasantly._     _With flocks the pastures clothed be,_       _The vales with corn are clad;_     _And now they shout and sing to Thee,_       _For Thou hast made them glad._   I am a soldier, and have been a soldier all my life, so when I encounter an assemblage of my fellow countrymen, I naturally scrutinise them from a recruiting sergeant’s point of view.  (At least, Eve always said I did.)  And what a sight that congregation presented!  I have encountered many types in the course of my duty.  I know our own Highlanders; I know the French Zouave regiments; a year or two ago—in nineteen-eleven I think it was—I saw the Prussian Guard march past the Emperor during Grand Manoeuvres; I have ridden with the Canadian North-West Mounted Police; I have seen a Zulu impi on the move in South Africa.  All have their own particular incomparabilities—dash, endurance, resource, initiative—but for sheer physical solidity and fighting possibilities, commend me to the peaceful yeoman-farming stock of the Lowlands of Scotland.  My own regiment is mainly recruited from this district, so perhaps I am prejudiced.  Still, if ever the present era of international restlessness crystallises into something definite; if ever The Day, about which we hear so much and know so little, really arrives—well, I fancy that that heavily-built, round-shouldered throng down there, with their shy, self-conscious faces and their uncomfortable Sunday clothes, will give an account of themselves of which their sonsy, red-cheeked wives and daughters will have no cause to feel ashamed.                                     *III*   After the psalm we settle down to the Doctor’s first prayer.  There are two of these, separated by an entire chapter of the Old Testament—a fairly heavy sandwich, sometimes.  The first prayer lasts a quarter of an hour, the second, eight minutes.  The first prayer takes the form of an interview between Doctor Chirnside and his Maker—an interview so confidential in character and of a theological atmosphere so rarefied that few of us are able to attain to it.  So our attention occasionally drops to lower altitudes.  The second prayer is more adapted to humble intellects. The Doctor refers to it as the Prayer of Intercession. In it he prays for everything and everybody, beginning with the British Empire and ending with the Dorcas Society.  Under the cloak of Intercession, too, he is accustomed, very ingeniously, to introduce, and comment upon, topics of current interest.  Occasionally he springs upon us a genuine and delightful surprise.  The parish still remembers the Sunday morning in eighteen-ninety-four upon which the Doctor, in his customary intercession for the Royal Family, got in twenty-four hours ahead of Monday’s _Scotsman_ by concluding his orison: \"And we invoke Thy special blessing, O Lord, upon the infant son (and ultimate heir to the Throne of this country) born, _as Thou knowest, Lord_, to Her Majesty’s grandchildren, the Duke and Duchess of York, at an early hour this morning!\"  But the first prayer, as already indicated, holds no surprises.  I am therefore accustomed to devote this period to a detailed inspection of the congregation below—an occupation which has the special merit of being compatible with an attitude of profound devotion.  Perhaps I ought to explain how it is that I, a mere visitor, should take such a deep interest in Craigfoot and its associations.  The fact is, I am no visitor.  I was born here, not ten miles away, at The Heughs, a little manor among the foothills, where my brother Walter and his lusty family still flourish.  As a younger son I was destined from birth for the Army; but by the time I had passed into Sandhurst, and on to the lordly exile of our Army in India, I knew every acre of the district.  I had tumbled into burns and been kicked off ponies all over the county. I knew everybody who lived there, from our local overlord, the Earl of Eskerley, down to Bob Reid, the signal porter at the railway station—who, being well aware that I went fishing every Wednesday at Burling, two stations up the line, was accustomed on those occasions to refuse right of way to the morning train, palpitating for its connection with the junction ten miles distant, until my tardy bicycle swept round the curve of the road and deposited me panting on the platform.  Inevitably, the day came when I fell in love—with Eve.  That was no novelty for Eve; for she and her elder sister, Diana, had most of us on a string in those days.  Baronrigg was the lodestone of every young spark in the county, except during those dismal months in summer when our twin divinities were spirited away to London for the season.  Some were able to follow them there; but I was not.  Neither was Eric Bethune. Regimental duty forbade, though we did what we could with the generous leave available in the early nineties.  Ultimately, I was taken and Eric was left. Why Eve took me I have never known.  I was only an infantry subaltern, and a younger son into the bargain.  But she picked me out from the crowd, and waited for me, bless her! for seven years.  My theory was, and is, that a woman only marries a man for one of two reasons—either because he gives her \"a thrill,\" or because she thinks he requires taking care of.  There was no doubting Eve’s reason for marrying me.  She took care of me for one rapturous year; and then she left me, and took her baby with her.  To-day both lie in the private burial-ground of Baronrigg. That is why I always accept Tom’s annual invitation to stay there at Easter,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46549"],["title","The Willing Horse: A Novel (#2)"],["body","than go to my brother Walter’s cheery but distracting establishment at The Heughs.  That is enough about me.  Now let us get back to the congregation.  It was a representative throng, yet not entirely representative.  For one thing, our chief territorial and social luminary, Lord Eskerley, is a member of the Church of England; and when he goes to church at all—which is usually just after a heart-attack, or just before a General Election—he goes to Fiddrie.  For another, no Scottish assemblage can be counted truly representative which takes no account of the adherents of Holy Church—as a peep into Father Kirkpatrick’s tightly-packed conventicle on the other side of the glen would tell us.  But when all is said, the parish church is still the focus of Scottish rural life, and I was well content with the selection of friends who filled the pews below me.  There was old General Bothwell, of Springburn, a Mutiny and Crimean veteran—altogether quite a celebrity among a generation which knows nothing of actual warfare.  (After all, the South African affair touched our civil community very lightly.)  Beside the General sits his son Jack, home on leave from India.  He commands a company in a Pathan regiment.  The General is trying hard not to look proud of Jack.  Just behind the Bothwells sit the Graemes, of Burling—Sir Alistair, his Lady, and their three tall daughters, known and celebrated throughout the county as \"The Three Grenadiers.\"  Across the aisle sits old Couper, of Abbottrigg—the largest farmer in the district, and one of the best curlers in Scotland—with his wife.  The old couple are alone now, for all their sons and daughters are married.  However, a good many of them are present in other parts of the church, holding a fidgety third generation down in its seat.  Just in front of the Coupers I observe Mr. Gillespie, manager of our branch of the Bank of Scotland, a man of immense discretion and many secrets.  With him, Mrs. Gillespie.  Also the two Misses Gillespie, locally and affectionately renowned as \"Spot\" and \"Plain.\"  I notice that their son, Robert, who is studying for the Ministry in distant Edinburgh, is with them for the week-end.  Farther back, at the end of a long pew, just under the public gallery, sits Galbraith, our chemist and druggist, a small man with a heavy cavalry moustache and—the not uncommon accompaniment of a small man—a large wife and twelve children.  The children fall into two groups, separated by an interval of seven years. The first group—four in number, and somewhat wizened in appearance—were born and reared upon the slender profits of a retail business in tooth-brushes, patent medicines, and dog-soap. The other eight—fat and well-liking—began to appear serially after Mr. Galbraith had amassed a sudden and unexpected fortune out of a patent sheep-dip of his own invention, which has made the name of Galbraith celebrated as far away as Australia.  Over the way from Galbraith, in a side pew, sits Shanks, the joiner.  He is a poor creature, lacking in ability either to ply his trade or invent reasons for not doing so.  Eve used to say that Shanks never by any chance acceded to a professional summons, and that his excuses were three in number, and were employed in monotonous rotation—firstly, that he had swallowed some tacks; secondly, that he had had to bury \"a relation of the wife’s\"; thirdly, that one of his numerous offspring had been overtaken by a fit.  Behind Shanks sit the Misses Peabody.  They are the daughters of a retired merchant of Leith, who died many years ago.  They inhabit a villa on the outskirts of our little town, live on an annuity, and exist precariously in that narrow social borderland which divides town-folk from gentry.  Passing on, I note that Mr. Menzies, Lord Eskerley’s factor, has at last provided himself with a wife—a stranger to me.  Well, Menzies is well connected and has an excellent house; so, doubtless, the lady will be comfortable.  But I wish he had not gone so far afield.  There is nothing wrong with the girls in this district, Menzies!  _Experto crede_!  My eye wanders on over the bowed heads. Finally it reaches the third pew from the front, and I am aware of the handsome presence of my friend Eric Bethune, of Buckholm.  Beside him, bolt upright, with a critical eye fixed upon Doctor Chirnside, sits his eccentric lady mother.  Eric’s attitude is more devout, but I observe that his head is turned sideways, and that he is grinning sympathetically at Tommy Milroy over the way, whose little nose is being relentlessly pressed to the book-board by an iron maternal hand encased in a hot black kid glove.  Eric, although he is as old as myself, is still very much of a boy—or perhaps I ought, in strict candour, to say a child.  He was a child at school—in his exuberant vitality, his sudden friendships, his petulance. He was a child at Sandhurst; he was a child as a subaltern—at times, almost a baby.  But he has been my friend all my life, and I admire him more than any man I know; perhaps because he possesses all the qualities which I lack.  He is tall and debonair; I am—well, neither.  He is impulsive, frank, and popular; I am cautious, reticent and regarded as a little difficult.  (This is not true really, only there is no Eve now to tell me what to say to people.)  But, above all, Eric is a soldier.  In the South African War he was Adjutant of our Second Battalion.  They were sent out rather late, and only got to work after Paardeburg.  I was with the other battalion, and saw nothing of Eric, but his Colonel considered him the smartest Adjutant in the Division, and recommended him for the D.S.O.  He got it, but always declared that he had had no chance to earn it, except by instructing the men very thoroughly in what is vulgarly known as the art of \"Spit and Polish.\"  Certainly they were the best turned-out crowd I have ever seen, when they marched through the streets of Edinburgh on their return.  Directly after that we both went back to India. We were anxious to go. Eve had died just before I sailed for South Africa; Diana had broken off her engagement with Eric and married Tom Birnie three years earlier. But I did not stay in India very long.  I was restless for home again; and, having decided that the Regular Army could now get along without my services, I sent in my papers and settled in London.  When Roy was nine years old his mother followed her sister. She had survived Eve only six years, for the same lung trouble had marked them down long ago. After that Eric felt that he could come back to Buckholm.  So he came, and they gave him command of the Regimental Depot, with the rank of Major. The Depot is not far away from here, and he is able to join his mother at Buckholm for much of the time.  He is quite his old self now, and he has made the Third Battalion a marvel of smartness and efficiency.  But there is one house which he never visits—Baronrigg.  I do not blame him. His memories there are not like mine.  Moreover, besides hating Tom Birnie, he dislikes Roy.  I am surprised at this, because the boy is the image of his mother.  Still, I suppose a man may be forgiven for disliking a boy who should have been his own son, but is not. Anyhow, I know I shall not meet Eric during my stay at Baronrigg, so I have arranged to lunch at Buckholm after church to-day.  That covers the congregation, I think.  (Doctor Chirnside is working up to his peroration, and in a few minutes we shall be erect again.)  I look over them once more.  Altogether, a sturdy, satisfactory assemblage, from laird to ploughman. We have not changed much in the last two hundred years, nor will during the next two hundred, so far as I can see.  We are Conservatives of Conservatives, although we return a Liberal.  We shall go on tilling the fat soil, and raising fat cattle, and marrying young, and having big families, and sending a few of the boys into the Army, and a few to the Colonies, and keep the rest at home to marry strapping girls and have more big families, until the end of time.  We are a little disturbed, to be sure, at the present state of the world outside.  A street-bred Government, with both eyes on the industrial vote, has recently compelled us, even us, to disburse our hard-earned pennies upon stamps, to be stuck at frequent intervals upon an objectionable card.  We are informed that this wasteful and uncongenial exercise is designed to bestow upon us the benefits of insurance against sickness—upon us, who are never either sick or sorry; and if ever we are, are taken care of (under an unwritten compact of immemorial antiquity) by the employers who have known us and ours for generations back.  Other political upheavals are agitating the country, but they leave us cold in comparison with this superfluous imposition of benevolence.  But still, politicians are always with us, and must be endured; so what matter?  Our valleys stand so thick with corn that they laugh and sing, and even with Income Tax at one and twopence in the pound, things might be worse.  After all, we have our health, and perhaps it is our duty to contribute to the insurance of those sickly city folk.  A few stamps are not a very high price to pay for peace and prosperity and sleepy contentment in the heart of the British Empire.                                     *IV.*   ... I think I must have begun to nod a little. It was a warm morning, and the sunshine and the songs of the birds without, and the confidential rumblings of Doctor Chirnside within, had exercised a soporific effect.  But I opened my eyes with a jerk, and observed that the Netherby pew was occupied.  Netherby has stood empty so long that it is quite a shock to see its pew inhabited at all.  It is a conspicuous pew, in the corner of the church, to the left of the pulpit, and my unregenerate nephews and nieces call it \"The Loose Box.\"  It is built in the form of a hollow square, and is surrounded by dingy red rep curtains,"]]]
