You mean...? Oh, blast you, stop pulling my leg! I know perfectly well that General Eisenhower didn't say a word to you. You didn't even see him!\"  Dawson grinned, and opened his mouth. But he closed it when he saw the look on young Farmer's face. Instead, he shook his head gravely.  \"No, Freddy,\" he said. \"The general didn't say a thing to me. It's dollars to doughnuts that he doesn't even know I exist. But I put it that way so's you'd catch on.\"  \"Catch on to what?\" Freddy wanted to know.  Dawson threw up his hands in exasperation.  \"Sweet tripe, Freddy!\" he cried. \"It's past noon! Aren't you awake yet? It's obvious, pal, isn't it? Obvious that the invasion isn't going to pop right away. The High Command is marking time while the bomber boys give Germany a good going-over. So the experienced pilots that aren't needed in England have been sent back here to help with the training program. Don't worry, when the big show starts we'll be yanked back there, but fast. _That's_ why I'm not tearing out my hair because I've been stuck on this instructing job. Because I know that when it's time for the balloon to go up I'll be sent there. And so will you. And so will all the others that flew back from England with us. Now do I make sense to you?\"  Freddy Farmer nodded, but he didn't say anything for a moment.  \"Yes, you're quite right, I fancy,\" he murmured presently. \"I must be slipping way off the beam not to have figured that out for myself. But I wonder how long?\"  \"When the Allied High Command is darned good and ready, and not a minute before,\" Dawson replied. \"Meanwhile we stick here ... and like it!\"  \"Maybe you can like it, but I don't,\" young Farmer growled, and glared at the window glass. \"This blasted rain!\"  Dave snapped his book closed, and tossed it on a nearby table.  \"Check!\" he grunted. \"It seems to be letting up a little, though, so let's do something about it. A little of it may do us some good. Let's take a walk out by those orange groves. They looked pretty interesting from the air. How about it, huh?\"  \"Right-o,\" Freddy Farmer sighed, and got to his feet. \"Anything's better than just sitting here listening to it!\"     CHAPTER TWO  _Strange Business_   With an angry gesture Freddy Farmer changed his rain slicker to his other arm, and pushed his service cap to the back of his head.  \"Blast it, I'm going to rest!\" he cried, and instantly pulled up to a halt. \"You said a walk, Dave, not a cross-country hike to the Atlantic coast. You know how far we've come?\"  Dawson slowed down and turned around with a grin.  \"Who cares how far?\" he said. \"This is swell. The trouble with you is, you're falling apart from old age. But okay, if you have to rest. Some view, huh? Californians sure have a right to brag, don't they?\"  \"If they like,\" Freddy muttered, and sank down on a convenient tree stump by the side of the path. \"But it's not my old age, I'll have you know. It's these blasted new shoes. Only wore them once before. I certainly wouldn't have worn them if I'd thought you were coming this far. It's all of five miles, if it's an inch.\"  \"Just the right distance for a nice work-out,\" Dawson said with a heartless grin, as he sank down beside Freddy. \"But get those gunboats off and let's see if you've got any blisters. And speaking of blisters from new shoes, I once knew a guy who got a blister, and two days later, guess what?\"  \"What?\" Freddy Farmer grunted, and began unlacing his shoes. \"What about two days later?\"  \"He died, just like that,\" Dawson grinned, and snapped his fingers. \"He was a swell guy, too. And it was just a little tiny blister. Didn't seem like anything at all. Let's have a look, kid. Maybe you got a _big_ blister.\"  \"You'll have something big, too, and on the side of your head, if you don't shut up!\" Freddy growled, and held up one of his shoes by the toe. \"One thing I always admired about you, young fellow, you do cheer up a chap so!\"  \"Always aim to please,\" Dawson chuckled, and leaned back on his elbows. \"See that hill over there? How far, would you say?\"  \"I'm not saying, because I don't care a penny's worth!\" young Farmer snapped, and peeled off his socks.  \"About three miles, I guess,\" Dawson murmured. \"I think we can make it there and back to the base by dark. We'd get a swell view of the sunset from the top of that hill.\"  \"You would, if you're fool enough to go there!\" Freddy Farmer cried. \"But not me, because I'm heading back to the base just as soon as I've had me a little rest!\"  \"Aw, don't be a sissy!\" Dawson chided. \"Come on. It will do you good. Really break in those new shoes of yours. I was kidding about it being three miles. It can't be more than a mile. We'll get a swell view of Dago and Coronado, Freddy. Come on; be a good guy!\"  When there was no comment from his flying mate and dearest pal, Dawson turned his head and opened his mouth to speak again. But no words came from between his lips, and that was because of the scowling, puzzled look on Freddy's face. He was sitting up straight, holding a sock in each hand, and staring intently at the crown of a low hill a short distance in back of where they sat.  \"What are you looking at?\" Dawson demanded, and twisted all the way around.  \"That little cluster of shacks up there,\" Freddy replied. \"I just saw a couple of chaps sneaking along by them. They looked a bit strange to me. I think one of them was in uniform.\"  \"So what?\" Dave grunted as he eyed the group of weather-beaten shacks. \"That's where the pickers live, I guess. For the orange groves, I mean. They're migratory pickers. They don't stay in one place all year round. Only for the picking season. Then they move, families and all, to some other section where a fruit crop has come in. That must be some life, I don't think. I wouldn't ... I see them, now, pal. And one is in uniform. And--hey! They're looking around as though they wanted to make sure nobody was watching them. Crouch down, Freddy. They won't be able to see us for those bushes there. I wonder what their act is all about anyway?\"  \"Well, it certainly looks suspicious from here,\" Freddy Farmer grunted as he hugged the ground closer with Dawson. \"And ... I say, Dave, you see that?\"  \"See what?\" Dawson demanded.  \"The one in civilian clothes, if you could call them that!\" the English-born air ace said breathlessly. \"His right hand! He's got a gun in it. Watch, and you'll see the sun on it as he turns.\"  Dawson didn't make any reply. He hugged the ground and peered past a clump of bushes at the two figures standing on the crown of the low hill no more than a couple of hundred yards away. One was very definitely garbed in uniform, but because of the position of the sinking sun, and the rays of light it cast off, it was impossible to tell what kind of a uniform at the distance. Then the other, the one obviously garbed in civilian clothes, turned slightly and the sunlight danced off a gun he held in his right hand. Dave gasped audibly, but it was not caused by sight of the sun on the gun. Rather, it was because of the figure's movements with the gun.  \"Cat's sake, Freddy!\" he grunted. \"The guy is waving that soldier inside that shack with his gun. See? There they go in, both of them. What the heck do you suppose, pal?\"  \"Blessed if I know,\" Freddy breathed back. \"Certainly looks deucedly queer, though. Do you fancy that soldier chap is being held up, or is in trouble?\"  \"I wouldn't know,\" Dawson grunted with a frown. \"Maybe we should find out. But he didn't seem to act as though he were putting up any objections. I had the feeling there that he sort of smiled.\"  \"Me, too,\" Freddy replied with a nod. \"I was wondering if you had seen it, or if it was just my imagination. Oh, it probably means nothing at all. We're just the suspicious type, I guess.\"  Dawson stared at the crown of the hill for a moment, and then lowered his gaze to the ground right in front of him, deep in thought.  \"What are you thinking about. Dave?\" young Farmer presently asked.  \"The one thing that doesn't seem to make sense,\" Dawson murmured after another moment or two of silence. \"That gun ... and it certainly was a gun, wouldn't you say?\"  \"Definitely,\" Freddy assured him. \"Looked like a long-barreled automatic to me. But it was definitely a gun of some sort. Well, what about it?\"  \"What's a civilian doing with a gun?\" Dawson asked. \"Particularly in these parts. This is a military zone, Freddy.\"  \"Perhaps it's the soldier's, and he let him look at it,\" young Farmer offered.  Dawson just shrugged at that, and said nothing. He raised his eyes and stared at the shack into which the two figures had disappeared, and then presently he turned and looked questioningly at Freddy Farmer.  \"Well?\" he said.  \"Well, what?\" the English-born air ace replied innocently.  \"You know exactly what I mean!\" Dawson snapped. \"Do we take a look to make sure, or do we just skip the whole thing, and start back to the base?\"  \"What do you think?\" Freddy instantly countered with a question of his own. \"Shall we, or shan't we?\"  Dawson hesitated a moment, and then pointed at Freddy's shoes and socks.  \"Put them on,\" he said. \"Maybe it'll just be a horse-laugh on us, but maybe it isn't as it should be. It isn't picking season around here yet, and by rights I don't think there should be anybody living in those shacks. I ... Oh, heck! Call me a curious cuss if you want to, but things like this get my curiosity clicking. I have to find out one way or the other.\"  \"As though I hadn't known you long enough to realize that!\" Freddy Farmer grunted, and began putting on his socks and shoes. \"But for once I'm with you. It's aroused my curiosity, too. How do we operate? Walk right up there, or steal from bush to bush, your American Indian style?\"  \"Neither!\" Dawson snapped, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41753"],["title","Dave Dawson at Truk (#2)"],["body","to their right. \"We use our heads, instead! We go back that way and circle up the rise from that end. Then we walk along with the shacks covering us. That way, if _we're_ surprised we can say that we were just taking a look at the lay-out. Just remember, one of them has a gun. And he might be the kind of a guy who asks questions _afterward_.\"  \"And right you are, for a fact!\" Freddy Farmer breathed, and tied the last shoelace. \"Your way suits me quite all right. As you Yanks say, there's no need to have somebody pull our necks out.\"  \"You and Yank lingo!\" Dawson groaned. \"But skip it. Let's go, and ... But, hey! What about your feet, Freddy?\"  \"They'll last,\" young Farmer assured him, and stood up. \"It was only a pebble, anyway. Let's get going.\"  Only a pebble. Just a tiny fragment of stone. Yet the presence of that pebble in Freddy Farmer's shoe was to send them both into the Valley of Death, and perhaps even to change the entire course of the war in the Pacific!     CHAPTER THREE  _The Talking Shack_   \"It's the next shack beyond this one, Freddy,\" Dawson murmured softly as he laid a restraining hand on his friend's arm. \"Just hold it a second, and see if we can hear anything. Somehow I like this even less. The door shut, and every shade drawn, such as they are. Or am I just getting jumpy?\"  \"Well, anyway, shut up, if you want us both to listen!\" Freddy Farmer breathed back at him.  Dawson grinned, made a face, and then with Freddy standing motionless at his side, he listened intently for any sounds coming from inside the shack just beyond the one behind which they crouched. And he did hear sounds. So did Freddy Farmer. The muffled and completely indistinct sound of two people talking. A tremor of excitement rippled through Dawson, and he squeezed Freddy's arm. A moment later, though, he frowned silently and wondered if perhaps he and Freddy weren't just being a couple of fools. After all, this wasn't the war zone. They weren't behind the enemy lines, or even their own lines. This was California, and what if they did see a soldier and a civilian go into one of the crop pickers' shacks? So what? And maybe that gun wasn't a gun after all. Freddy and he would certainly look awfully foolish if the pair inside that shack should suddenly come out and see them crouched there gaping wide-eyed like a couple of kids playing cops and robbers.  Those and other disturbing thoughts floated through his brain as he frowned at the shack. He turned his head and looked at Freddy questioningly. And the look young Farmer gave him in return indicated clearly that the English-born air ace was entertaining pretty much the same thoughts.  \"Maybe it's stupid, huh?\" Dawson formed the words with his lips.  Freddy nodded slowly, but at the same time a sort of half puzzled and half stubborn look glowed in his eyes. And then in the very next instant what indecision either of them may have had was wiped away by a cry of anger coming from the shack beyond. At least it sounded like anger to them both, although the sound was still too muffled to permit them to pick out individual words.  \"Well, that tears it as far as I'm concerned!\" Dawson grunted. \"I'm going to get a better look, whether it seems screwy or not.\"  \"Me, too, and right with you,\" Freddy Farmer replied. \"There are some bushes there against the back of the place. No window to peek through, but we can certainly hear clearly through those loosely fitted boards. Good grief, what places for people to live in!\"  Dawson nodded, and said nothing. He simply left their place of hiding and eased over to the protection of a line of scrub bushes. Keeping behind them, he swiftly made his way to the rear of the other shack. There he crouched down low and pressed an ear to the rough boards. Freddy Farmer quickly followed his move, and together they heard the high-pitched voice that was speaking inside.  \"... must not fail!\" it said. \"What I have given you must reach its destination as quickly as possible. However, not at the risk of your being suspected for one single minute. Do you understand?\"  \"Of course I understand!\" a harsh voice replied. \"Do you think I am a fool? Do you think I am a baby playing at a man's game?\"  \"What I think is of no importance,\" the high-pitched voice replied. \"Both you and I are but cogs in a great wheel that will crush the world. There is a saying in my native tongue that describes it perfectly, but I will not bore you by repeating it, as you do not speak the Japanese language. And when translated into your native tongue, German, it has no meaning at all. So forget that I mentioned it. You have your work, and I have mine.\"  A moment of silence followed, and Dawson was filled with a terrible fear that the thunder of his pounding heart could be heard beyond the loose board wall of the shack. He didn't dare turn his head to look at Freddy for fear that even that slight movement would create a sound that might be heard inside the shack. A Jap and a Nazi inside there? It seemed incredible! Like a crazy Hollywood concoction he had seen at the base movie house only the night before. It was ...  But the one who was obviously a Nazi was speaking again.  \"I was told that all my orders would come from Berlin.\"  \"And so they have, in a way,\" the one of the high-pitched voice replied smoothly. \"To be transmitted to you through me. Your country, and mine, fight this war together. It does not matter who gives the orders, or who performs them, so long as the enemy is defeated. Now, tell me, when do you sail?\"  \"Tonight,\" the other replied. \"I must be back aboard the carrier within two hours.\"  \"And so you will be,\" the Jap assured him. \"There is no need for us to talk much longer. Here is the address of the one you will call on in Honolulu. Show him this, and he will know you come from me. He will probably give you additional information. Guard it well until you have placed it in the hands of Admiral Shimoda at Truk.\"  \"But that is foolish, stupid!\" the Nazi snarled. \"My carrier force may not go within a thousand miles of Truk! And ...\"  \"Do not worry about that!\" the other cut him off. \"The American dogs have met him with a few minor successes of late, and it has gone to their heads. They will act boldly now, and that is what Admiral Shimoda wishes. Yes, I am sure that your task force will steam to within easy flying distance of Truk. When your carrier reaches that point you will see to it that you take off without creating _any_ suspicion and fly at once to your destination. When you reach Truk you will be under the direct orders of Admiral Shimoda. It may be that he will desire that you return to your carrier for future use. If so, you can safely leave it to him to arrange matters so that your own force will pick you up as a pilot who unfortunately has been forced down into the water, and has floated about in his rubber life raft for a day or two.\"  \"I would rather be sent to China to work there!\" the Nazi growled. \"I am sick of these swine Americans, and pretending to be one of them.\"  \"I can sympathize with you there,\" the Jap purred. \"I am sick of living under their rule, too. But at least I have the chance to travel often across the border into Mexico. There is a country that we will make great, once we have conquered the world. The Mexicans are ... But I wander. Speak to Admiral Shimoda of your wish to go to China. Perhaps he will agree with you. However, there is other work for you to accomplish first, before carrying information to Truk.\"  \"Other work?\" the Nazi asked sharply.  \"Important work,\" was the instant reply. \"And very important work. When you go to that address in Honolulu you will be given a number of water flares, so small that you could carry them all in one pocket and the bulge they made would not be noticed. But they give off a powerful light that burns for four or five hours.\"  \"Water flares?\" gasped the Nazi. \"For what use?\"  \"An important use,\" the Jap replied. \"Right now there are three American carriers in the San Diego Basin. You know that yours will sail tonight. Perhaps the other two, with their forces, will sail also. It may be, though, that only your carrier will stop at Pearl Harbor. Later it may meet the other two carriers at sea. You do not know now, and neither do I. However, you can keep our Pacific patrol forces informed of your own position. The water flares. I will explain their use briefly, and the one in Honolulu will give you detailed instructions. It will be an easy matter for you to learn the position of your carrier, and its force. An equally easy matter for you to learn the strength of your force, and whether others have joined it. So! Each evening you will put all that information down on special paper that you will be given in Honolulu, and put it in a watertight pocket attached to the flare. Then, unseen, you will throw the flare into the water. It is so constructed that it will not break into light for three or four hours. That is so that your carrier will be far out of sight range by then. However, come darkness, all of our submarines will surface to re-charge their batteries. Perhaps one of them will see the flare. Or perhaps one of our long-range patrolling Kawanishi flying boats will sight the flare, and land beside it. Perhaps not the first night you are at sea, or the next, or the next. But one night a flare will be picked up, and we will know all we need to know to set our trap of destruction for a future date.\"  \"That sounds very interesting!\" the Nazi said eagerly. \"I shall enjoy doing that kind of work. Let us hope that a dozen of their swine carriers make up the force of which mine will be a part!\"  \"Let us hope so,\" the Jap replied, with a little laugh that chilled the blood in Dawson's veins, \"but let us not count on it. The American dogs are not fools, all the time. We have shown them what happens to fools. But if it be only your carrier, that will be enough. From the information you throw into the water"]]]
