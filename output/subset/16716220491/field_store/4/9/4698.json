He is answerable to, not answered to.  All the other basic functions will have essentially the same organization, and it is anticipated there will 90 to 110 of them. At the present time 93 have been worked out. The one thing of note is that there will not be more than FOUR offices between Armando Pinccio of the garbage truck crew and the head of the national sequence of waste disposal.  The thing of most interest to all interested is the method of purchase or what is referred to as the MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE. In the TECH THERE IS NO MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE, THERE IS ONLY A METHOD OF TECHNOLOGICAL ACCOUNTING.  The means whereby you will get a new razor blade or a malted milk is to be known as DISTRIBUTION CERTIFICATES or ENERGY CERTIFICATES. These certificates, issued to every person on this continent every 30 days, will be good only for one person and no other. Since they will be able to purchase as much or, I should say, since they will give the individual purchasing power of 20,000 dollars per year, each will have everything he needs. Stop right now and think what this means in the reduction of crime. These certificates cannot be stolen, and since every one will have all they can possibly use, there will be no need to steal.  With the technological development on this continent at present it is possible to turn out, at peak production, enough for every person to have a terrific abundance, and to do this, with a little mechanization done in the period of a month or so, it is only necessary for every able individual male, twixt ages 25 & 45, to work fours hours a day, 4 days a week, for 165 days a year--to keep this production turning over. If any one works more, someone else works less. So draw your own conclusions.  All things under the TECHNATE will be controlled, numbered by a modified DEWEY DECIMAL SYSTEM, as used in libraries now. The energy certificate will have on its face the sex, age, job, place of birth, address, where he works, and the worker's number, all recorded by this system. There are also places for purchases, four, to be exact. When one makes up his mind to buy something, he goes to the store (an example) and buys a pair of shoes. By means of a photoelectric machine (already developed) the salesclerk would punch out numbers and the certificate would come out bearing, neatly perforated: \"34.46...11.E.728.../..H76302../... Z.97321.../...205...21.05.\" All this means that the article was a pair of low shoes, made by the leather sequence, that they were men's shoes, width E, last number 7, and style 8. Second series of numerals are the serial numbers of the machine, third is the number of certificate, the last the date and time.  At the end of the day the total lever of the machine would be pressed, and all the numbers, styles, etc. would be separated into totals (like nickels and dimes in a coin changing machine). The totals would then be teletyped to the divisional H.Q. of the leather sequence where it would be registered. This affords a continuous inventory of the whole continent. The following day, as many shoes as had been sold in the continent would be manufactured.  Many things, such as housing, transportation, medical care, recreation, education, etc. are furnished by Technocracy. One can easily see what a secure life this affords every citizen, and what a boon it is to scientific research.  I said that I wouldn't mention many things that would solve questions in the reader's minds, but if all questions are sent to the editorial offices we will contrive to open a forum.  In closing remember these few things. Technocracy is NOT a political or revolutionary movement. It is 100% American. It cannot work anywhere but on the American continent, because only here have we the necessary technological developements, the necessary trained force of technicians, and the necessary resources to institute an economy of abundance in place of an economy of scarcity. Technocracy is the only salvation when the Price System fails. It is not a political theory, but the next state of civilization. It is the best form of democracy ever conceived. It furnishes security, education, protection, and all that goes, with it to the people of the American continent. It is not in its formative state. It could be installed on a seventy-two hour call. The only reason why we don't have it now is because YOU are still duped to believing there is another way out.  Take Technocracy, or take----chaos!     _DON'T GET TECHNATAL_  by ron reynolds   For several moments Stern had eyed his typewriter ominously, contemplating whether he should utter the unutterable. Finally:  \"Damn!\" he roared. \"I can't write any more! Look, look at that!\" He tore the sheet out of the rollers and crumpled it in his fist. \"If I'd known it would be this way,\" he said, \"I wouldn't have voted for it! Technocracy is ruining everything!\"  Bella Stern, preoccupied with her knitting, glanced up in horror. \"What a temper,\" she exclaimed. \"Can't you keep your voice down?\" She fussed with her work. \"There now,\" she cried, \"you made me drop a stitch!\"  \"I want to be a writer!\" Samuel Stern lamented, turning with grim eyes to his wife. \"And the Technate has spoiled my fun.\"  \"The way you talk, Samuel,\" said his wife, \"I actually believe you want to go back to that barbarism prevalent in the DARK THIRTIES!\"  \"It sounds like one damned good idea!\" he said. \"At least I'd have something decent, or indecent, to write about!\"  \"What _can_ you mean?\" she asked, tilting her head back and thinking. \"Why can't you write? There are just oodles of things I can think of that are readable.\"  Something like a tear rolled down Samuel's cheek. \"No more gangsters, no more bank robberies, no more holdups, no more good, old-fashioned burglaries, no more vice gangs!\" His voice grew lachrymose as he proceeded down an infinite line of 'no mores'. \"No more sadness,\" he almost sobbed. \"Everybody's happy, contented. No more strife and hard work. Oh, for the days when a gangland massacre was headline scoop for me!\"  \"Tush!\" sniffed Bella. \"Have you been drinking again, Samuel?\"  He hiccoughed gently.  \"I thought so,\" she said.  \"I had to do something,\" he declared. \"I'm going nuts for want of a plot.\"  Bella Stern laid her knitting aside and walked to the balcony, looked meditatively down into the yawning canyon of the New York street fifty stories below. She turned back to Sam with a reminiscent smile.  \"Why not write a love story?\"  \"_WHAT!_\" Stern shot out of his chair like a hooked eel.  \"Why, yes,\" she concluded. \"A nice love story would be very enjoyable.\"  \"LOVE!\" Stern's voice was thick with sarcasm. \"Why, we don't even have decent love these days. A man can't marry a woman for her money, and vice-versa. Everyone under Technocracy gets the same amount of credit. No more Reno, no more alimony, no more breach of promise, or law suits! Everything is cut and dried. The days of society weddings and coming out parties are gone--cause everyone is equal. I can't write political criticisms about graft in the government, about slums and terrible living conditions, about poor starving mothers and their babies. Everything is okay--okay--okay--\" his voice sobbed off into silence.  \"Which should make you very happy,\" countered his wife.  \"Which makes me very sick,\" growled Samuel Stern. \"Look, Bell, all my life I wanted to be a writer. Okay. I'm writing for the pulp magazines for a coupla years. Right? Okay. Then I'm writing sea stories, gangsters, political views, first class-bump-offs. I'm happy.... I'm in my element. Then--bingo!--in comes Technocracy, makes everyone happy--bump! out goes me! I just can't stand writing the stuff the people read today. Everything is science and education.\" He ruffled his thick black hair with his fingers and glared.  \"You should be joyful that the population is at work doing what they want to do,\" Bella beamed.  Sam continued muttering to himself. \"They took all the sex magazines off the market first thing, all of the gangster, murder and detective publications. They been educating the children and making model citizens out of them.\"  \"Which is as it should be,\" finished Bella.  \"Do you realize,\" he blazed, whipping his finger at her, \"that for two years there hasn't been more than a dozen murders in the city? Not one suicide or gang war--or--\"  \"Heavens!\" sighed Bella. \"Don't be prehistoric, Sam. There hasn't been anything really criminal for twenty years now. This is 1975 you know.\" She came over and patted him gently on the shoulder. \"Why don't you write something science-fictional?\"  \"I don't like science,\" he spat.  \"Then your only alternative is love,\" she declared firmly.  He formed the despicable word with his lips, then: \"No, I want something new and different.\" He got up and strode to the window. In the penthouse below he saw half a dozen robots moving about speedily, working. His face lit up suddenly, like that of a tiger spying his prey. \"Jumping Jigwheels!\" he cried. \"Why didn't I think of it before! Robots! I'll write a love story about two robots.\"  Bella squelched him. \"Be sensible,\" she said.  \"It might happen some day,\" he argued. \"Just think. Love oiled, welded, built of metal, wired for sound!\" He laughed triumphantly, but it was a low laugh, a strange little sound. Bella expected him to beat his chest next. \"Robots fall in love at first sight,\" he announced, \"and blow an audio tube!\"  Bella smiled tolerantly. \"You're such a child, Sam. I sometimes wonder why I married you.\"  Stern sank down, burning slowly, a crimson flush rising in his face. Only half a dozen murders in two years, he thought. No more politics, no more to write about. He had to have a story, just had to have one. He'd go crazy if something didn't happen soon.

He had to have a story. He turned and looked at his wife, Bella, who stood watching the air traffic go by the window, bending over the sill, looking down into the street fifty floors below....  ... and then he reached slowly and quietly for his atomic gun.         *       *       *       *       *  AN EXPLANATION: You may have wondered why I placed the Technocrat story and article in FuFa. Well, it's because I think Technocracy combines all of the hopes and dreams of science-fiction. We've been dreaming about it for years--now, in a short time it may become reality. It surely deserves support from any serious fictioneer. And you can't say this mag isn't balanced!--first I give you Yorke's article on Tech., then I give you a satire on the same thing, jabbing at it in a good-humoured way, and then--when you read Ackerman's article, you'll see almost the complete annihilation of EARTH. So, whether you are an optimist or a pessimist about the future of humanity, you'll find either side in FuFa. (But on the side, I'm all for the Technate, aegh!)  Ye Editor....         *       *       *       *       *       This being the first issue of FuFa I feel fortunate in being able      to offer a piece of scientifiction by the field's most famous fan.       THE RECORD was written first in 1929, scarcely more than a sketch,      on two pages. Ackerman was thirteen. ED EARL REPP, LA author of THE      RADIUM POOL, said of it: \"I found it delighting and exceptionally      interesting for the writing of a boy so young.\" Ackerman re-wrote      it into a three page story, later, the present product. It has not      been touched since. It is not being retouched now. Allow me to      present THE RECORD as a _record_ of how Forrie wrote, spelled and      punctuated six years ago at the age of sixteen. _ED._     THE RECORD  by FORREST J. ACKERMAN   For twenty years--for twenty long, horror filled, war laden years the Earth had not known peace.  Hovering over the metropolises of the world came long, lean battle projectiles, glinting silver in the sunlight or coming like gaunt mirages of grey out of the midnight sky to blast man's civilization from its cultural foundations. Man against man, ship against ship--a ceaseless and useless orgy of slaughter. Men, at their battle stations in the ships, pressed buttons, releasing radio bombs that blistered space and lifted whole cities up in shattered pieces and flung them down, grim ruins, reminders of man's ignorant hatreds and suspicions.  And gas--thick black clouds of it--billowing over the cities, seeking every possible egress, pushed forward by colossal Wind machines. But even when Victory came for the one side, often Nature, in one of her vengeful moments, would send the black gas flowing back to annihilate its senders.  Rays cut the air! Power bombs exploded incessantly! Evaporays robbed the Earth of its water--shot it up into the atmosphere and made of it a fog that condensed only after many months. And heat rays made deserts out of fertile terrain.  Rays that hypnotized caused even the strong minded to commit suicide or reveal military secrets. Rays that effected the optical nerves swept cities and left the population groping and blind, unable to find food.  It was a war that destroyed almost all of humanity. And why were they fighting? _For pleasure and amusement!_  In the middle of the twenty-second century, every nation had a standard defense. The weapons of war of each were equal--not in proportion to size, but actually, since man-power no longer counted high. Pacifism had done its best, but the World was armed to the hilt. And now--though illogically--it felt safe--for every nation meant the same as if all had nothing.  Another thing--there was no work to be done. Robots did it. And there seemed nothing left to discover, invent or enjoy. Art was at its perfection, poetry was mathematically correct and unutterably beautiful--worked out by the Esthetic machines. Sculptoring had been given the effect complete, artists hands guided by wonderful pieces of machinery. Huge museums were crammed with art put out synthetically.  And thus it was with the many Arts and their creators who grew stagnent in their perfection. And it was that way with the many sciences also....  Paleontologists had found, and articulated, and catalogued every fossil. The ancestor of the Eohippus, the little four-toed Dawn Horse, was discovered; the direct line between man and ape established in skeletal remains; the seat of _life_ itself definitely proved Holarctica. And great bio-chemists, skilled in the science of vital processes, had created synthetic tissues and muscles and flesh, built upon the frames that had been recovered bodies with skillful modeling ... even supplied them with blood and given them the spark of LIFE ... so that Paleobotonists recreated the flora of a prehistoric era. Again the ponderous amphibious brontosaur pushed through marshes. Fish emerged upon the land, and the first bird archaeopteryx tried his imperfect wings for flight. In the regulated climates of long dead ages, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals lived again for the edification of those interested in the very ancient--or who were amused with queer animals.  But that was only paleontologically speaking. There were the heavens to be considered. They had been: the stars and planets weighed and measured, their composition noted, courses plotted with super-accuracy. Every feature had been mapped--every climactic condition recorded. Life had been named and numbered ... then photographed. And these were but first considerations. Actually, what wasn't known about the Solar System had not occurred as yet. But that would probably be remedied by a machine to view the future.  There was physics, biology, anthropology, zoology, geology, bacteriology, botany--and 'ologies' and 'otonies' and 'onomies' such as ran into figures which only machines could calculate.  A book could indeed have been written of the accomplishments of super race. But this is of the WAR itself, and how it came about, and how it all ended.  Stated simply, in 2150 the point of DIMINISHING UTILITY had been reached. To the hungry man, the first course of dinner is wonderfully delicious, the second good, the third satisfying. Through the ages people have hungered after luxury and leisure--but when he finds his food, a lot of it, MAN finds suddenly that it no longer appeals to him. In fact, too much is bound to make him sick and often disagreeable. He looks around for something else. So did the people of the 22nd Century. They had all of the pleasurable amusements they wanted, but it was all so intellectual. Everything was culture. They had surfeited with it. And suddenly they wanted to forget it. All play and no work made MAN a discontented citizen. A reaction set in. Man was not completely civilized as yet----THE WAR!  Twenty-one years the war raged. And scarcely a million survived. Bit by bit this million was whittled down by the weapons of destruction to ragged handfuls of things that once had been cultured. Finally only one hundred humans remained alive--and they kept fighting blindly, none of them realizing how close to oblivion they were crowding themselves and the future of humanity--and they went on killing, killing, killing!  It is doubtless but what the entire human race would have vanished, leaving the world to the more competent, though half-ignorant, hands of the beasts, who fought and killed one another for self-preservation and for food--not because of madness ... and who did not have books and talk and have _culture_. The human race would have gone, had it not been for the record.  The fighters of WAR'S END, leaving their machines and countries to congregate for personal combat, were engaging in hand-to-hand attacks in the ruins of what once had been a tall and powerful city in the Twentieth Century, but now lay crumbling, its proud buildings falling to the ground, sticking out iron-rusted skeletons to the sky--and the city was LOS ANGELES!  HEDRIK HUNSON was fighting with phosphorized fists--hand inclosed in chemically treated gloves that burned as they struck the antagonist, insulated on the interior for the wearer--when suddenly the two of them were caught by a spreader. The other man died instantly, but Hedrik got it in the side and was whirled about sickeningly, and survived.  He was lying painfully on something when he came to, but felt too dizzy and sick to move. At last, when his head had cleared a bit, he rolled over into a sitting position and reached out his arms to grasp--a phonograph!  Big things came in small packages in the days of 2171, and a portable phonograph might well be taken for a weapon of some sort--which was exactly what Hedrik thought! And you can hardly blame him, because no one in that generation had ever seen one of the things.  There was a curious story connected with the dying of music, concerning the days of 2050 when there was a movement to stamp out all symphonies and songs and things even slightly sentimental.  --but back to Hedrik!  Hedrik found the crank that wound the portable, turned it, reasoning that perhaps it gave power--and then--holding it away from him--he waited for rays to spurt out or something to explode. Nothing happened! Hedrik was disappointed. After an agony of perspiration and puzzlement he finally accidentally placed the needled arm onto the disk. The disk, he noticed, was black and filled with little undulations. The disk was like a wheel--so Hedrik thought--it should revolve like one, shouldn't it? He pushed the starter thoughtfully and was more than surprised when the disk started spinning.  From the phonograph came music--music and singing! The lost Art had returned! The Art banished under compulsion had made a comeback.  Some man was singing on the record--in a queerly interesting and familiar tongue, the"]]]
