[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34781"],["title","An Australian Bird Book: A Pocket Book for Field Use (#2)"],["body","has dwelt sufficiently on the economic and scientific value of bird-study. Let me enter a plea for bird-study as a source of æsthetic pleasure. Before our Australian birds can be to us what the Thrush and the Blackbird and the Linnet and the Lark and the Nightingale are to the British boy, we must have a wealth of association around them from song and story. And this association must grow up with us from childhood if it is to make the strongest appeal to us. It can rarely be acquired in later life. British birds owe much to the poets for the charm that surrounds them. When I heard the Nightingale in England, although I had no association with it gathered from my boyhood's days, I heard more than the bird's song. I was listening to Keats and Wordsworth and Shakespeare as well. There is something very fine in the thought that such bird songs go on for ever, that these immortal birds are \"not made for death,\" that    \"The voice I hear this passing night was heard   In ancient days by emperor and clown:   Perhaps the self-same song that found a path   Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,   She stood in tears amid the alien corn.\"  The Nightingale's song, as a bird song, I thought disappointing. I remember having the same feeling with regard to the Thrush and Blackbird. The charm of their songs is largely in the associations they evoke. Our city children are now growing up in familiarity with these two birds, which are becoming as common in our gardens as in England. And wherever they go they carry so much that is fine in literature with them. But there has not yet been time for our native birds to endear themselves to us. And so we hear only their song. Wise Shakespeare says--    \"How many things by season seasoned are   To their right praise and true perfection.\"   *      *      *      *      *      *      *    \"The Nightingale, if she should sing by day,   When every goose is cackling, would be thought   No better a musician than the Wren.\"  He knows that to the song of the bird must be its appropriate setting, and that when Nature has done her part there is still much to be supplied by ourselves.  The outlook is, however, a hopeful one. Nature-study is bringing our boys and girls into kindlier relationships with our birds; suitable popular names will be forthcoming for them; our poets will sing of them; our nursery rhymes and our children's tales will tell of them; and the time will come when even the birds now trying so hard to sing their way into our hearts, while cursed with the names of \"Rufous-breasted Thickhead\" and \"Striated Field Wren or Stink Bird,\" will mean to an Australian what \"the Throstle with his note so true\" and \"the Wren with little quill\" do to an Englishman.  Mr. Leach's valuable little book is a powerful contribution to this much-to-be-desired result.    FRANK TATE.

This little volume is intended as a pocket book for field use, so that the many teachers, nature-students, nature-lovers, schoolboys, schoolgirls, and boy scouts, who like to \"_see_ what they _look at_,\" may be able to name the birds they meet.  The first step towards knowing the birds is a _desire_ to know them; this will grow if a person is interested; so our first business, as in all nature-study work, is to arouse _interest_. Interest follows at once, as we have often found, if a person realizes that what is about him or her is worthy of study.  To arouse this necessary interest, a lecture on Australian birds is given in such a form that it may be repeated, if desired.  The second requisite is a handy descriptive list of the birds that are likely to be seen. This has been written in simple language, so that the schoolboy and non-expert can use it.  Thus, our aims are two:--      1. To show that Australian birds are of interest.      2. To supply, in a convenient form, a list of the birds which     are likely to be seen, and the marks by means of which they     may be identified.  This little book contains illustrations and descriptions of--    100% of the birds found in Victoria.   92.5% .. .. .. .. .. .. .. South Australia.   87.3% .. .. .. .. .. .. .. Tasmania.   82.5% .. .. .. .. .. .. .. New South Wales.   78.16%.. .. .. .. .. .. .. W. Australia (S. and C.).   78.15%.. .. .. .. .. .. .. Queensland.  The balance of those found in each of the other States is made up mainly of birds closely related to those of which illustrations are given, or of very rare birds restricted to a small area.  The families of the birds of the world have been included, so that the observer can see where the bird he is observing is placed amongst the world's birds. He will also be enabled to place near its Australian relatives birds he reads about. The Australian birds only are grouped in orders.  Mr. H. Wilson, Nature-study Lecturer, Training College, superintended the painting of the birds, and saw the book through the press.  _A Hand-List of Birds_: Dr. Sharpe; and _A Hand-List of the Birds of Australasia_: Gregory M. Mathews, have been followed for classification and distribution.  But for the interest of the Minister of Education, the Hon. A. A. Billson, and the Director, Mr. F. Tate, M.A., I.S.O., this little book would not have been possible. Further, Mr. Billson suggested the colored illustrations, while Mr. Tate has written the introduction, read the proof-sheets and assisted at all stages.     PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.   In response to requests from beginners, a table has been added on page 190. This table shows the page on which a bird of a certain size may be found.  Pending the completion by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Union of its official _Check-list of the Birds of Australia_, the scientific names have been left as in the first edition.   NOTES.  Where one number is placed over another at the left side of the page, the lower number denotes the number of species of that genus found in the world; the upper denotes the number of species found in Australia and Tasmania.  The number at the right side of the page is the length of the bird in inches (from the tip of bill to the tip of tail).  The families of birds known are numbered consecutively, thus, F. 11, F. 12, and so on. The number after a family name denotes the number of species recorded from Australia and Tasmania. The distribution of the species of each family amongst the six zoogeographical regions is shown thus:      F. 17. COLUMBIDAE (2), WOOD PIGEONS, Passenger-Pigeon, Rock-Dove,     119 sp.--41(40)A., 25(17)O., 18(10)P., 19(17)E., 4(0)Nc., 24(20)Nl.  This should read: Family number 17 of the world's birds, COLUMBIDAE (two of which are found in Australia and Tasmania) contains the Wood Pigeons, including the Passenger-Pigeon (of North America) and the Rock-Dove (of Europe). It comprises 119 species, of which 41 are found in the Australian Region, 40 of them being confined to this region; 25 are found in the Oriental Region, 17 being confined to it; 18 are found in the Palaearctic Region, 10 of which are not found outside the region; 19 have been recorded from the Ethiopian Region, 17 being peculiar to that region; 4 have been recorded from the Nearctic Region, none of which is restricted to the region; 24 have been recorded from the Neotropical Region, 20 being peculiar to it.  The name in black type is the name accepted by the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science in 1898, and amended by the \"names\" sub-committee of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Union, 1911. This name should be used to denote the bird. Many local names are given, so that a person knowing a bird by one of these may discover its proper name.      A.--Australian Region (from Wallace's Line to Sandwich Islands     and New Zealand, see map p. 10).      O.--Oriental (Indian) Region (India to Wallace's Line).

DESCRIPTION OF NEOSHO RIVER   The Neosho River, a tributary of Arkansas River, rises in the Flint Hills of Morris and southwestern Wabaunsee counties and flows southeast for 281 miles in Kansas, leaving the state in the extreme southeast corner (Fig. 1). With its tributaries (including Cottonwood and Spring rivers) the Neosho drains 6,285 square miles in Kansas and enters the Arkansas River near Muskogee, Oklahoma (Schoewe, 1951:299). Upstream from its confluence with Cottonwood River, the Neosho River has an average gradient of 15 feet per mile. The gradient lessens rapidly below the mouth of the Cottonwood, averaging 1.35 feet per mile downstream to the State line (Anonymous, 1947:12). The banks of the meandering, well-defined channel vary from 15 to 50 feet in height and support a deciduous fringe-forest. The spelling of the name originally was \"Neozho,\" an Osage Indian word signifying \"clear water\" (Mead, 1903:216).    [Illustration: FIG. 1.  Neosho and Marais des Cygnes drainage   systems. Dots and circles indicate collecting-stations.]   _Neosho River, Upper Station._--Two miles north and two miles west of Council Grove, Morris County, Kansas (Sec. 32 and 33, T. 15 S., R. 8 E.) (Pl. 28, Fig. 2, and Pl. 29, Fig. 1). Width 20 to 40 feet, depth to six feet, length of study-area one-half mile (one large pool plus many small pools connected by riffles), bottom of mud, gravel, and rubble. Muddy banks 20 to 30 feet high.  According to H. E. Bosch (landowner) this section of the river dried completely in 1956, except for the large pool mentioned above. This section was intermittent in 1954 and 1955; it again became intermittent in the late summer of 1957 but not in 1958 or 1959.  A second section two miles downstream (on land owned by Herbert White) was studied in the summer of 1959 (Sec. 3 and 10, T. 16 S., R. 8 E.) (Pl. 29, Fig. 2 and Pl. 30, Figs. 1 and 2). This section is 20 to 60 feet in width, to five feet in depth, one-half mile in length (six small pools with intervening riffles bounded upstream by a low-head dam and downstream by a long pool), having a bottom of gravel, rubble, bedrock, and mud, and banks of mud and rock, five to 20 feet in height.   _Neosho River, Middle Station._--One mile east and one and one-half miles south of Neosho Falls, Woodson County, Kansas (Sec. 3 and 4, T. 24 S., R. 17 E.) (Pl. 26, Fig. 1). Width 60 to 70 feet, depth to eleven feet, length of study-area two miles (four large pools with connecting riffles), bottom of mud, gravel and rock. Mud and rock banks 30 to 40 feet high.  According to Floyd Meats (landowner) this section of the river was intermittent for part of the drought.   _Neosho River, Lower Station._--Two and one-half miles west, one-half mile north of Saint Paul, Neosho County, Kansas (Sec. 16, T. 29 S., R. 20 E.). Width 100 to 125 feet, depth to ten feet, length of study-area one mile (two large pools connected by a long rubble-gravel riffle), bottom of mud, gravel, and rock. Banks, of mud and rock, 30 to 40 feet high (Pl. 26, Fig. 2).  This station was established after one collection of fishes was made approximately ten miles upstream (Sec. 35, T. 28 S., R. 19 E.). The second site, suggested by Ernest Craig, Game Protector, provided greater accessibility and a more representative section of stream than the original locality.     DESCRIPTION OF MARAIS DES CYGNES RIVER   The Marais des Cygnes River, a tributary of Missouri River, rises in the Flint Hills of Wabaunsee County, Kansas, and flows generally eastward through the southern part of Osage County and the middle of Franklin County. The river then takes a southeasterly course through Miami County and the northeastern part of Linn County, leaving the state northeast of Pleasanton. With its tributaries (Dragoon, Salt, Pottawatomie, Bull and Big Sugar creeks) the river drains 4,360 square miles in Kansas (Anonymous, 1945:23), comprising the major part of the area between the watersheds of the Kansas and Neosho rivers. The gradient from the headwaters to Quenemo is more than five feet per mile, from Quenemo to Osawatomie 1.53 feet per mile, and from Osawatomie to the State line 1.10 feet per mile (Anonymous, 1945:24). The total length is approximately 475 miles (150 miles in Kansas). The river flows in a highly-meandering, well-defined channel that has been entrenched from 50 to 250 feet (Schoewe, 1951:294). \"Marais des Cygnes\" is of French origin, signifying \"the marsh of the swans.\"   _Marais des Cygnes River, Upper Station._--One mile south and one mile west of Pomona, Franklin County, Kansas (Sec. 12, T. 17 S., R. 17 E.) (Pl. 27, Fig. 1). Width 30 to 40 feet, depth to six feet, length of study-area one-half mile (three large pools with short connecting riffles), bottom of mud and bedrock. Mud banks 30 to 40 feet high.  According to P. Lindsey (landowner) this section of the river was intermittent for most of the drought. Flow was continuous in 1957, 1958 and 1959.  There are four low-head dams between the upper and middle Marais des Cygnes stations.   _Marais des Cygnes River, Middle Station._--One mile east of Ottawa, Franklin County, Kansas (Sec. 6, T. 17 S., R. 20 E.) (Pl. 27, Fig. 2). Width 50 to 60 feet, depth to eight feet, length of study-area one-half mile (one large pool plus a long riffle interrupted by several small pools), bottom of mud, gravel, and rock. Mud and sand banks 30 to 40 feet high.  This section of the river was intermittent for much of the drought. In the winter of 1957-'58 a bridge was constructed over this station as a part of Interstate Highway 35. Because of this construction many trees were removed from the stream-banks, the channel was straightened, a gravel-bottomed riffle was rerouted, and silt was deposited in a gravel-bottom pool.   _Marais des Cygnes River, Lower Station._--At eastern edge of Marais des Cygnes Wildlife Refuge, Linn County, Kansas (Sec. 9, T. 21 S., R. 25 E.). Width 80 to 100 feet, depth to eight feet, length of study-area one-half mile (one large pool plus a long riffle interrupted by several small pools), bottom of mud, gravel, and rock. Mud banks 40 to 50 feet high.  This section of the river ceased to flow only briefly in 1956.     METHODS   _Electrical Fishing Gear_  The principal collecting-device used was a portable (600-watt, 110-volt, A. C.) electric shocker carried in a 12-foot aluminum boat. Two 2 × 2-inch wooden booms, each ten feet long, were attached to the front of the boat in a \"V\" position so they normally were two feet above the surface of the water. A nylon rope attached to the tips of the booms held them ten feet apart. Electrodes, six feet long, were suspended from the tip and center of each boom, and two electrodes were suspended from the nylon rope. The electrodes extended approximately four feet into the water. Of various materials used for electrodes, the most satisfactory was a neoprene-core, shielded hydraulic hose in sections two feet long. These lengths could be screwed together, permitting adjustment of the length of the electrodes with minimum effort. At night, a sealed-beam automobile headlight was plugged into a six-volt D. C. outlet in the generating unit and a Coleman lantern was mounted on each gunwale to illuminate the area around the bow and along the sides of the boat (Pl. 3a). In late summer, 1959, a 230-volt, 1500-watt generating unit, composed of a 115-volt, 1500-watt Homelite generator was used. It was attached to a step-up transformer that converted the current to 230 volts. The same booms described above were used with the 230-volt unit, with single electrodes at the tip of each boom.  A 5.5-horsepower motor propelled the boat, and the stunned fish were collected by means of scap nets. Fishes seen and identified but not captured also were recorded. On several occasions fishes were collected by placing a 25-foot seine in the current and shocking toward the seine from upstream.  The shocker was used in daylight at all six stations in the three years, 1957-'59. Collections were made at night in 1958 and 1959 at the middle Neosho station and in 1959 at the lower Neosho station.   _Seines_  Seines of various lengths (4, 6, 12, 15, 25 and 60 feet), with mesh-sizes varying from bobbinet to one-half inch, were used.
