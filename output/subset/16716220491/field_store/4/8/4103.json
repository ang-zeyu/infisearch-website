CHAPTER II  COMMON SENSE IN THE WILDERNESS   [Sidenote: Overburdening]  THERE is more danger that a man take too much than too little into the wilderness. No matter how good his intentions may be, how conscientiously he may follow advice, or how carefully he may examine and re-examine his equipment, he will surely find that he is carrying a great many pounds more than his companions, the professionals at the business. At first this may affect him but little. He argues that he is constructed on a different pattern from these men, that his training and education are such as to have developed in him needs and habits such as they have never known. Preconceived notions, especially when one is fairly brought up in their influence, are most difficult to shake off. Since we have worn coats all our lives, we include a coat in our list of personal apparel just as unquestionably--even as unthinkingly--as we should include in our calculations air to breathe and water to drink. The coat is an institution so absolutely one of man's invariable garments that it never even occurs to him to examine into its use or uselessness. In like manner no city dweller brought up in proximity to laundries and on the firm belief that washing should be done all at once and at stated intervals can be convinced that he can keep clean and happy with but one shirt; or that more than one handkerchief is a superfluity.  [Sidenote: Elimination]  Yet in time, if he is a woodsman, and really thinks about such affairs instead of taking them for granted, he will inevitably gravitate toward the correct view of these things. Some day he will wake up to the fact that he never wears a coat when working or traveling; that about camp his sweater is more comfortable; and that in sober fact he uses that rather bulky garment as little as any article in his outfit. So he leaves it home, and is by so much disencumbered. In a similar manner he will realize that with the aid of cold-water soap the shirt he wears may be washed in one half hour and dried in the next. Meanwhile he dons his sweater, A handkerchief is laundered complete in a quarter of an hour. Why carry extras, then, merely from a recollection of full bureau drawers?  [Sidenote: Essentials]  In this matter it is exceedingly difficult to be honest with oneself. The best test is that of experience. What I have found to be of no use to me, may measure the difference between comfort and unhappiness to another man. Carry only essentials: but the definition of the word is not so easy. _An essential is that which, by each man's individual experience, he has found he cannot do without._  [Sidenote: How to Determine Essentials]  How to determine that? I have elsewhere indicated[1] a practical expedient, which will however, bear repetition here. When you have reached home after your trip, turn your duffle bag upside down on the floor. Separate the contents into three piles. Let pile No. 1 include those articles you have used every day--or nearly that often; let pile No. 2 comprise those you have used but once; and pile No. 3 those you have not used at all. Now, no matter how your heart may yearn over the Patent Dingbat in No. 3, shut your eyes and resolutely discard the two latter piles.  Naturally, if you are strong-minded, pile No. 1 will be a synonym for your equipment. As a matter of fact you will probably not be as strong-minded as that. You will argue to yourself somewhat in this fashion:  \"Yes, that is all very well; but it was only a matter of sheer chance that the Patent Dingbat is not in pile No. 1. To be sure, I did not use it on this particular trip; but in other conditions I might need it every day.\"  [Sidenote: The Philosophy of Duffle]  So you take it, and keep on taking it, and once in a great while you use it. Then some day you wake up to two more bits of camp philosophy which you formulate to yourself about as follows: _An article must pay in convenience or comfort for the trouble of its transportation_; and _Substitution, even imperfect, is better than the carrying of special conveniences_. Then he hurls said Patent Dingbat into the nearest pool.  [Sidenote: Patent Dingbats]  That hits directly at the weak point of the sporting catalogues. Every once in a while an enthusiast writes me of some new and handy kink he is ready to swear by. It is indeed handy; and if one could pluck it from the nearest bush when occasion for its use arose, it would be a joy and a delight. But carrying it four hundred miles to that occasion for its use is a very different matter. The sporting catalogues are full of very handy kinks. They are good to fool with and think about, and plan over in the off season; but when you pack your duffle bag you'd better put them on a shelf.  Occasionally, but mighty seldom, you will find that something you need very much has gone into pile No. 3. Make a note of it. But do not be too hasty to write it down as part of your permanent equipment.  [Sidenote: You Must Not Mind Getting Wet Sometimes]  The first summer I spent in the Sierras I discovered that small noon showers needed neither tent nor slicker. So next year I left them home, and was, off and on, plenty wet and cold. Immediately I jumped to the conclusion that I had made a mistake. It has not rained since. So I decided that sporadic heavy rains do not justify the transportation of two cumbersome articles. Now when it rains in daytime I don't mind getting a little wet--for it is soon over; and at night an adequate shelter can be built of the tarpaulin and a saddle blanket. In other words the waterproofs could not pay, in the course of say three-days' rain in a summer, for the trouble of their transportation during four months.  As I have said, the average man, with the best intentions, will not go too light, and so I have laid especial emphasis on the necessity of discarding the unessential. But there exists a smaller class who rush to the opposite extreme.  [Sidenote: Another Sort of Tenderfoot]  We all know the type. He professes an inordinate scorn for comfort of all sorts. If you are out with him you soon discover that he has a vast pride in being able to sleep on cobblestones--and does so at the edge of yellow pines with their long needles. He eats badly cooked food. He stands--or perhaps I should say poses--indifferent to a downpour when every one else has sought shelter. In a cold climate he brings a single thin blanket. His slogan seems to be: \"This is good enough for me!\" with the unspoken conclusion, \"if it isn't good enough for you fellows, you're pretty soft.\"  [Sidenote: The Tough Youth]  The queer part of it is he usually manages to bully sensible men into his point of view. They accept his bleak camps and voluntary hardships because they are ashamed to be less tough than he is. And in town they are abashed before him when with a superior, good-natured, and tolerant laugh he tells the company in glee of how you brought with you a little pillow-case to stuff with moss. \"Bootleg is good enough for me!\" he cries; and every one marvels at his woodsmanship.  As a plain matter of fact this man is the worse of two types of tenderfoot. The greenhorn does not know better; but this man should. He has mistaken utterly the problem of the wilderness. The wild life is not to test how much the human frame can endure--although that often enough happens--but to test how well the human wits, backed by an enduring body, can answer the question of comfort. Comfort means minimum equipment; comfort means bodily ease. The task is to balance, to reconcile these apparently opposing ideas.  [Sidenote: The Logic of Woodcraft]  A man is skillful at woodcraft just in proportion as he approaches this balance. Knowing the wilderness he can be comfortable when a less experienced man would endure hardships. Conversely, if a man endures hardships where a woodsman could be comfortable, it argues not his toughness, but his ignorance or foolishness, which is exactly the case with our blatant friend of the drawing-room reputation.  Probably no men endure more hardships than do those whose professions call them out of doors. But they are unavoidable hardships. The cowboy travels with a tin cup and a slicker; the cruiser with a twenty-pound pack; the prospector with a half blanket and a sack of pilot bread--when he has to. But on round-up, when the chuck wagon goes along, the cow-puncher has his \"roll\"; on drive with the wangan the cruiser sends his ample \"turkey\"; and the prospector with a burro train takes plenty to keep him comfortable. Surely even the Tough Youth could hardly accuse these men of being \"soft.\"  [Sidenote: Outfit Should Correspond to Means of Transportation]  You must in this matter consider what your means of transportation are to be. It would be as foolish to confine your outfit for pack horses to the equipment you would carry on your own back in the forests, as it would be to limit yourself to a pack horse outfit when traveling across country in a Pullman car. When you have horses it is good to carry a few--a very few--canned goods. The corners of the kyacks will accommodate them; and once in a blue moon a single item of luxury chirks you up wonderfully and gives you quite a new outlook on life. So you chuck them in, and are no more bothered by them until the psychological moment.  [Illustration: The author doing a little washing on his own account]  On a walking trip, however, the affair is different. You can take canned goods, if you want to. But their transportation would require another Indian; another Indian means more grub and more equipment; and so at the last you find yourself at the head of an unwieldy caravan. You find it much pleasanter to cut the canned goods, and to strike out with a single companion.

Both sides were soon at work with artillery. Companies G and H of the First Regiment had advanced through a gully, or dry ravine, leading into Bull Run, until they found themselves exposed to a murderous fire from three different directions. For at least half an hour they remained in this position unable to advance or retreat. The New York Twelfth on their flank fell back, and a general retrograde movement soon followed, with a stand taken at Centreville. The only valuable result of the reconnoissance was the bringing under fire for the first time of some thousands of raw troops. Thirteen men of the First Regiment were killed, and as many more wounded and taken prisoners. Rev. Warren H. Cudworth, chaplain of the regiment, published in 1866 a very full and lively history of its operations.         *       *       *       *       *                            THE BULL-RUN MUSKET.       A single dead soldier of the Union army was an object of      intense public interest up to the date of the battle of      Bull Run in July, 1861.       There were two lads of us who left Boston to visit our      brothers--both of whom were in the army and in the same      company. We expected to find the Army at Washington; and      we each carried a box of dainties to delight our brothers      with. On reaching Washington, we were sorely disappointed      to find that the army had started on its march to      Richmond; and that no civilians were allowed to      follow--not even to cross the Potomac into Virginia. So      there was nothing to do but see the sights in Washington      and return to our homes. But we had been there only two      days when the news came of a fight or skirmish on July      18th at Blackburn's Ford, where several were killed,      and one of the dead was the brother of my companion. It      was a terrible blow to my friend, and a great shock for      me.       We immediately telegraphed home, and at once came the      reply \"Get the body, if you can, and send it home.\" Well,      we two lads went to the War Department and I suppose our      sorrowful tale moved them with compassion, for they gave      each of us a pass to go to the front to get the body of      the dead soldier. I've got that pass stowed away now,      among my papers, as a War curiosity. It reads,       Allow the bearer, Mr. Andrew J. Clement, to pass the      lines and go to the Front for the body of a friend.                                         DRAKE DE KAY                                              _Aid de Camp._       Later in the war, the death of a soldier was of too      little importance to awaken such sympathy at      Headquarters. Indeed, two days later, there were      thousands killed within two miles of the spot where those      killed in this skirmish were buried. After much      difficulty, we hired a light wagon in which my friend      rode, while I got a seat in an army wagon that was taking      out supplies. It was just midnight on Saturday July      20th when we started from Willard's Hotel on      Pennsylvania Avenue. There was a full moon, and the night      was lovely. I was all excitement. I was going to join the      army. I should see my brother, and perhaps I should see      the big battle everybody was talking about as soon to be      fought.       Well, I saw all that I expected to see and a good deal      more. As the horses toiled painfully all that night over      the rough and hilly roads, I little thought that on the      very next night I should be more painfully trudging back      over that very route footsore and weary, a gun on my      shoulder--and ready to fight if the victorious enemy came      up with us. Yet such was the case, and the gun in the      hall is the one that I carried to Washington after the      battle of Bull Run, July 21st, 1861.       Of course the ride that beautiful night was too exciting      for sleep. It was just after daybreak, when we were      taking a hasty breakfast at a small tavern, that we heard      the first boom of a heavy gun. This was the gun that      opened the great battle of Bull Run. We were yet six      miles away from the army--and all were impatient to reach      our destination. The horses were kept at their best      working pace, and when we had gone three miles we met      troops marching towards us. These were certain regiments      that wouldn't fight because the ninety days of their term      of service had just expired. They looked thoroughly      ashamed of themselves, and marched in great disorder. The      officer with our wagon, and the soldier who drove it,      both scoffed at them and called them sneaks and cowards;      and, cowards as they were, they didn't resent the      insults. For myself, I felt as though they all deserved      shooting when they got to Washington.       An hour later we reached Centreville and looked down on      the battle-field. Hastily finding where my friend's dead      brother was buried, I left him to his mournful task of      recovering the corpse while I went to find my own brother      whom I yet hoped to meet alive. But it wasn't an easy      task. The line of battle was long; and, in spite of my      inquiries, I went wrong. I went to the right wing only to      find that the regiment I sought was probably away off on      the left wing. Nobody seemed able to give exact      information, and everybody wanted to know what a boy in      black clothes and a straw hat was doing on the      battle-field. Once I went up and sat down in the rear of      a battery of light artillery to watch the effect of the      firing, and the Capt. drove me off with terrible oaths.      But I went around a small farm house and crept back      again, and saw the grapeshot scatter the \"rebs.\" And so I      went on from point to point, staring and asking      questions, and being stared at and questioned in return.      At length I learned that the regiment I wanted was at the      extreme left. So off I started, already weary from loss      of sleep, excitement and tramping under the hot sun.       Arriving at the left, I again was attracted by a battery      in action, and it was while I stood entranced with      excitement that my brother discovered me. His regiment      was lying in the bush close by supporting this very      battery. Never was a man more surprised than was he at      that moment. He supposed I was at home in Boston. But,      before he would talk, he made me go into the woods and      lie down with the soldiers so as to be in less danger.      And there I crawled around and shook hands with nearly a      hundred men whom I had known all my life. Many were the      questions I answered, and scores of messages were given      me to take home to parents and friends. The boys seemed      very sad--for a member had been killed in this company      only three days before, and they expected to be actively      fighting again at any moment. At length my brother      insisted that I should go back to Centreville out of      danger, and I started with a heavy heart. But secretly I      resolved to try to go to Richmond with the army, for I      felt sure it would only take a few days. Up to that time      it seemed to be victory for us; and I didn't believe it      could possibly be otherwise. So I went back to      Centreville. I was very hungry as well as tired. It was      now past four o'clock in the afternoon.       I soon found a group of sick officers who were about to      dine off of boiled beef close by the army wagon in which      I had come from Washington. They asked me to join them. I      had just got fairly seated when the astounding news came      that our army was defeated and was retreating. I didn't      believe it; but I rushed to the hilltop to see for      myself. Down there on the plain, where I had been in the      morning, there was certainly much dust and confusion.      Just then fresh troops, the reserves, started to go down,      but even to my inexperienced eye it was plain that they      went in bad order and went too late. It was there that I      saw the general who wore two hats--one crushed over the      other--and who was reported in newspaper accounts of the      scene as being very drunk that day. He certainly appeared      decidedly drunk at that moment.       Wild with excitement, I rushed down hill too; but long      before I got where I had been a few hours before, I met      the rush of panic stricken men coming pell-mell from the      field. To resist this rush was impossible and worse than      useless. Wagons driven at full speed came with the men.      Shouted curses filled the air. Wagons broke down, and,      cutting the harnesses, men mounted the horses and rode      off toward Centreville. Muskets were thrown away and      filled the road for a long distance. It was there that I      picked up my gun, begged a pocket full of ammunition, and      resolved to do my share when the terrible Black Horse      Cavalry reached us--for it was reported that they were      coming at full speed. Ere long I reached Centreville      again, and left the rush to look for my wagon. It had      gone, long before, in the grand stampede for Washington.      That didn't worry me much then--I thought I would find my      brother again; and fight in company with the boys I grew      up with. So I waited and waited at Centreville till the      sun got low. I saw at length that it would be useless to      try to find anybody. There were several roads; and all      were full of disorganized troops.       But the first mad rush was over. _All_ the army did not      run. _I_ did not run a step. It was nearly sunset when I      left Centreville; and, as I was terribly hungry, I      stopped, after going about a mile, and joined two of N.      Y. 69th regiment who were having a regular feast out of a      broken down and"]]]
