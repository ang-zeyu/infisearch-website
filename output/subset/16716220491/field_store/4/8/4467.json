A signalman, holding the halyard in his hand, awaited a glance from the Captain.  It came at last.  Up fluttered a hoist of bunting--the formal asking for permission to proceed.  \"Permission, sir!\" reported the signalman, as an answering string of colour announced that the Commander-in-Chief of the port had graciously condescended to order the _Hammerer_ to do what had been previously ordered.  \"Stand clear!\"  To the accompaniment of the shrill trill of the bos'n's mates' pipes, the working parties surged hither and thither in apparently utter confusion; then almost imperceptibly, as the powerful tug in attendance began to pull the ship's bows clear of the jetty, the _Hammerer_ started on her voyage into the great unknown.  A bugle-call--and every officer and man stood to attention, the marines presenting arms as the battleship glided past the old _Victory_. Another call, and the men relaxed their attitude of rigidity.  The last compliment had been paid to the authorities of the home port--the _Hammerer_ was outward bound.  \"Any idea of the rendezvous?\" asked Jack Sefton, one of the midshipmen, as the lads forgathered in the gun-room to \"stand easy\", almost for the first time since commissioning.  \"Rather,\" announced another, Trevor Maynebrace, who, having an uncle an admiral, professed somewhat loftily to be \"in the know\". \"Rather--Rosyth: that's where we are bound, my dear Sefton; there to swing at moorings till the ship's bottom is smothered in barnacles. They'll keep us in reserve to fill up gaps caused by casualties, and, judging by recent events, we'll have to cool our heels a thundering long time.\"  \"You're quite sure, Maynebrace?\" asked the Sub.  \"Quite--well, nearly so,\" admitted the midshipman.  \"Then what do you make of that?\" continued Dick, pointing through the open scuttle.  Broad on the starboard beam rose the frowning cliffs of Dunnose.  The land was that of the Isle of Wight, so that the _Hammerer's_ course was approximately south-west.  She was not alone.  On either side, at ten cables' distance, were two long, lean destroyers of the River class, their mission being to safeguard the ship from the attack of a lurking German submarine.  \"H'm!\" muttered the discomfited middy.  \"P'r'aps there's been an alteration of plans.  Looks as if we're bound for Plymouth.\"  \"Or the Mediterranean, perhaps,\" remarked Jolly, the clerk, who looked anything but his name.  He was a weedy-limbed youth, narrow-chested and knock-kneed.  He was as short-sighted as a bat, and wore spectacles with lenses of terrific power.  To those not in the know, it seemed astonishing how he managed to pass the doctor; but Jolly's father was a post-captain, and that made all the difference.  Unable owing to physical disabilities to enter the executive branch and follow in his father's footsteps, the lad had taken the only alternative career open to him that the Admiralty provides for short-sighted youths, and had entered the service as an assistant clerk.  Maynebrace gave the representative of the accountant branch a look of scorn.  \"I don't think!\" he said with a sneer.  \"Our Mediterranean Fleet is quite large enough for all emergencies.  We'd be of no use for the Egyptian business.  Our draught of water is too much for the Canal; besides, the _Swiftsure_ and _Triumph_ will attend to that little affair.  No; I reckon it's Plymouth, and then the North Sea via Cape Wrath.\"  Just then the muffled sound of a tremendous roar of cheering, issuing from four hundred lusty throats, was faintly borne to the ears of the members of the gun-room.  Again and again it was repeated.  \"Scoot,\" ordered Crosthwaite, addressing Farnworth, one of the junior midshipmen.  \"Scoot as hard as you can, and see what the rumpus is about.\"  In two minutes the youngster, his face glowing with excitement, dashed into the gun-room.  \"Glorious news!\" he exclaimed.  \"The owner's opened the sealed orders. We're off to the Dardanelles.  We'll have the time of our lives.\"     CHAPTER II  Cleared for Action  With admirable and well-kept secrecy the Admiralty had made all preparations for a strong attack to be delivered at the supposedly impregnable Dardanelles.  In addition to the ships of the Mediterranean Fleet, battleships and cruisers were ordered to proceed to the Near East, until a fleet deemed sufficiently strong for the work in hand had collected in the Ægean Sea.  The _Hammerer_ was one of the first to leave England for that purpose, while it was hinted amongst the officers that there was a big surprise up the sleeve of the Admiralty when the final depositions of the attacking fleet were completed.  Sub-lieutenant Dick Crosthwaite hailed the news with as much enthusiasm as the rest of the gun-room, which is saying much; for the youngsters let off a cheer that, if it did not equal the volume of sound emitted by the men, had the dire effect of arousing the chaplain and naval instructor from their afternoon nap.  It was a chance of a lifetime.  Little Tommy Farnworth's announcement was a true one.  While the Grand Fleet waited and watched in tireless energy for the German High Seas Fleet, this powerful squadron, detached without risk of disturbing the superiority of power in home waters, was silently and rapidly concentrating to match its strength against the vaunted Ottoman batteries on both sides of the Dardanelles.  For this purpose the older type of war-ships with their 12-inch guns could be usefully and profitably employed, since speed--one of the greatest factors of modern naval warfare--was not so imperative when dealing with immobile batteries the position of which is already known.  When Ushant was astern and the _Hammerer_ well into the Bay, the battleship's escort of destroyers turned and parted company.  They had seen the ship through the waters within the radius of action of the German submarines.  They were now free to return and take another battleship clear of the Channel.  No doubt several huge grey-painted war-ships had been observed through the periscopes of these hostile under-water craft, but the presence of the swift, alert destroyers was sufficient to cause even the most reckless German lieutenant-commander to hesitate to attack.  But for the destroyers more than one of the Mediterranean-bound war-ships would have fallen an easy prey to the lurking peril of the deep.  From the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian Oceans came ships proudly displaying the white ensign.  Under cover of complete secrecy, battleships and battle-cruisers gained the rendezvous without an inkling of their presence to the outside world.  The _Canopus_, which had been expected to join Admiral Cradock's ill-starred squadron in the Pacific, and had last been heard of in the Falkland Islands fight, suddenly turned up in the Ægean.  The battle-cruisers that enabled Admiral Sturdee to avenge the _Monmouth_ and _Good Hope_ swiftly covered the 6500 miles between the Falkland Islands and the Piræus; the _Triumph_, after doing yeoman service at Kiao-Chau, and stopping in the Suez Canal to help put the fear of the British Empire into the Turkish invaders of Egypt, steamed into the Archipelago, ready to continue the good work she had so worthily begun.  Not only was the white ensign displayed at the southern gate of the Sea of Marmora; for a powerful French squadron, without weakening the force that held the Austrians under the guns at Pola and Trieste, had arrived to join hands with the former traditional enemy and now close ally of France; while in the Black Sea the Russians were making their presence felt upon the Turkish littoral of that inland sea.  The Ottoman Empire, tottering after the last disastrous Balkan War, was on the point of committing national suicide under the patronage of its bombastic German tutors.  On the ninth day after leaving Portsmouth the _Hammerer_ was in the vicinity of Cape Matapan.  She was bowling along at a modest sixteen knots, a rate that, considering the condition of her engines, reflected great credit upon the \"black squad\" and the engine-room staff.  It was two bells in the first dog watch.  Dick Crosthwaite, who was on duty on the fore-bridge, was talking with the officer of the watch when a sail was reported astern.  Bringing the glasses to bear upon the vessel, both officers found that only her masts and funnels showed above the horizon.  There was something unfamiliar about the appearance of the masts, for one was a tripod, the other one of the ordinary pre-Dreadnought type.  The only battleships that sported this combination were the _Lord Nelson_ and _Agamemnon_--and their position was known to an almost absolute certainty--and the newly-completed _Queen Elizabeth_.  \"Strange,\" remarked Bourne, the officer of the watch.  \"I'd almost bet my bottom dollar that's the _Queen Bess_ but for two reasons: first, she's not ready for sea; secondly, she's too powerful a ship to send out here while there's an impending job for her in the North Sea.\"  \"She's coming on at a tremendous rate,\" observed Dick.  For several minutes the identity of the overtaking craft remained unknown; for, acting upon definite instructions, owing to the \"tapping\" of important messages by the enemy, the use of wireless had been almost entirely dispensed with during the voyage.  \"Telephone to the fire-control platform, Mr. Crosthwaite,\" ordered Bourne.  \"Ask them what they make of yonder craft.  Stay!  Send one of the midshipmen--Maynebrace; he looks as if a little exercise would do him good.\"  Midshipman Maynebrace needed no spur.  In a very few moments he had made his way to the foremast and was climbing the dizzy height by means of the iron rungs that, riveted to the lofty steel cylinder, formed the only means of personal communication with the fire-control platform. The interior of the _Hammerer's_ hollow masts, which were originally fitted with lifts to convey the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37600"],["title","The Fight for Constantinople: A Story of the Gallipoli Peninsula (#2)"],["body","to the now discarded quick-firing guns in the fighting-tops, were now utilized for the numerous wires and voice-tubes communicating with the various parts of the ship.  Up through the lower top and upwards again the midshipman climbed with the dexterity acquired by long practice, never halting till he disappeared from view inside the elongated steel-plated box known as the fire-control platform.  Down again, seemingly at the imminent risk of breaking his neck, young Maynebrace made his way; then, cool and collected in spite of his exercise, he saluted the officer of the watch.  \"It's the _Lizzie_, sir,\" he reported, using the abbreviated name by which the British seamen already knew the wonder ship of the year--the super-Dreadnought, _Queen Elisabeth_.  \"By all the powers!\" ejaculated Bourne.  \"This takes the proverbial biscuit.  That's a nasty slight upon poor old Tirpitz: sending our last word in battleships to the Dardanelles.\"  \"I pity the Turks, sir, when the _Lizzie_ begins to tickle them up with her fifteen-inchers,\" said Maynebrace.  \"There'll be a few people surprised, not only out here but at home.\"  So well had the Admiralty plans been kept a secret that, until the _Hammerer's_ ship's company saw the super-Dreadnought almost within the limits of the Ægean Sea, the _Queen Elizabeth's_ presence was totally unexpected.  The mere fact of her being sent out to the Near East indicated the gigantic task before the Allies: the forcing at all costs the hitherto supposedly impregnable defences of the Dardanelles.  Majestic in her business-like garb of grey, and with her eight monster 15-inch guns showing conspicuously against the skyline, the _Queen Elizabeth_ overhauled and passed her older consort as easily as an express overtakes a suburban train.  For five minutes the \"bunting tossers\" on both ships were busily engaged; then, amid the outspoken and admiring criticism of the _Hammerer's_ crew, the super-Dreadnought slipped easily ahead and was soon hull down.  Twelve hours later the _Hammerer_ dropped anchor at the rendezvous off Tenedos.  She was but one among many, for the Anglo-French fleet numbered nearly a hundred of various sizes--from the _Queen Elizabeth_ of 27,500 tons down to the long, lean destroyers.  In addition there were numerous trawlers--vessels that a few weeks previously had been at work off the coasts of Great Britain.  Now, under conditions of absolute secrecy, these small but weatherly craft had risked the danger of a passage across the Bay in the early spring, had braved the \"levanters\" of the Mediterranean, and had assembled to do their important but frequently underrated work of clearing the mines to allow the advance of the battleships to within effective range of the hostile batteries.  Next morning, according to time-honoured custom, the _Hammerer's_ crew assembled on the quarter-deck for prayers.  It was a fitting prelude to the work in hand, for orders had been issued from the flagship for the fleet to go into action.  A bell tolled.  To the signal yard-arm rose the \"Church pennant\": red, white, and blue, with a St. George's Cross on the \"fly\" or outer half. As the crew trooped aft, each man decorously saluted the quarter-deck and fell in; seamen, stokers, and marines forming three sides of a square, with the officers in the centre, while the \"defaulters\", few in number, were mustered separately under the eagle eye of the ship's police.  In ten minutes the solemn function was over.  The Chaplain disappeared down the companion; the Captain gave the stereotyped order \"Carry on\"; the Commander, taking his cue, gave the word \"pipe down\", and the scene of devotion gave place to the grim preparation for \"Action\".  Stanchions, rails, ventilators, anchor-davits disappeared as if by magic.  Hatches and skylights were battened down and secured by steel coverings, and everything liable to interfere with the training of the guns was either ruthlessly thrown overboard or stowed out of sight. Hoses were coupled up, ready to combat the dreaded result of any shell that might \"get home\" and cause fire on board.  All superfluous gear aloft was sent below; shrouds were frapped to resist shell-fire, and the fore-top-mast was housed.  The main-topmast, since it supported the wireless aerials, had perforce to remain.  In less than an hour the crew, each man working with a set purpose, had transformed the _Hammerer_ into a gaunt [Transcriber's note: giant?] floating battery.  Dick Crosthwaite's action station was in the for'ard port 6-inch casemate, an armoured box containing one of the secondary battery guns, capable of being trained nearly right ahead, and through an arc of 135 degrees to a point well abaft the beam.  The major portion of the casemate was taken up by the gun and its mountings, while a little to the rear of the weapon, and protected by a canvas screen, was the ammunition hoist, by which projectiles weighing 100 pounds each were sent up from the fore magazine.  Around the walls were the voice tubes communicating with the conning-tower, the magazine, and other portions of the ship, while in addition was a bewildering array of switches and cased wires in connection with the lighting of the casemate and the firing mechanism of the gun.  Buckets of water, for use in case of a conflagration, stood on the floor in close company with a tub full of barley water, at which the parched men could slake their thirst.  What little space remained was fully occupied by the gun's crew, who, stripped to their singlets, were coolly speculating as to the chances of \"losing the number of their mess\".  Strangely enough, no one imagined that he was to be one of the unlucky ones; it is always his pal or some of his shipmates.  It is an optimism that is shared equally alike by the Tommies in the trenches and the Jack Tars at their battle-stations.  Craning his neck, the Sub looked through the gun-port.  It was an operation that required no small amount of manoeuvring, for the aperture was barely sufficient to allow the chase of the gun to protrude, while the armoured mounting left very little space between its face and the curved wall of the casemate.  The _Hammerer_ was third ship of the port column, for the older battleships were steering in double column, line ahead.  Preceding the squadron were the mine-sweepers, covered on either flank by strong patrols of destroyers.  Ten or twelve miles to the north could be discerned a mountainous and rocky coast terminating abruptly to the west'ard.  Part of the highland was in Europe, part in Asia, but where the line of demarcation existed the Sub was unable to determine.  Somewhere in that wall of rock lay the entrance to the Dardanelles, but distance rendered the position of the hostile straits invisible.  Away on the port hand lay the island of Imbros.  Under its lee could be seen the misty outlines of the _Queen Elisabeth_, _Agamemnon_, _Irresistible_, and the French battleship _Gaulois_, ready to open a long-range bombardment of the Turkish batteries.  \"Think the beggars will fight when they see this little lot?\" asked Midshipman Sefton.  \"Why not?\" asked the Sub.  \"I hope they will,\" continued the midshipman.  \"Especially after all this trouble.  The Turk is a funny chap.  See how he crumpled up against the rest of the Balkan States in 1912.\"  \"On the other hand, the Turkish infantryman in '78 was reckoned one of the best 'stickers' in Europe,\" said Dick.  \"Under European officers these fellows will fight pretty gamely, and from all accounts there's a good leavening of German officers and artillerymen in these forts. Anyhow, we've got to get through.  We've done it before, you know.\"  \"Yes,\" admitted Sefton; \"in the early nineteenth century, with a fleet of wooden walls.  Duckworth did a grand thing then.  In '78, when Hornby went through, the case was different.  The Turks didn't open fire.  Perhaps they funked it, and that's what makes me think they'll hesitate at the last moment.\"  Even as the midshipman spoke there came a peculiar screech that sounded almost above the armoured roof of the casemate.  The two young officers exchanged glances.  It was the first shell from the battery of Sedd-ul-Bahr.     CHAPTER III  The Demolition Party  A double crash announced that the leading battleship of the British squadron had opened fire with her foremost 12-inch guns.  In two minutes the action had become general, the whole of the British and French pre-Dreadnoughts engaging with their principal armament, for as yet the range was too great for the 6-inch guns and smaller weapons to be trained upon the distant defences.  Ahead, the mine-sweepers, \"straddled\" by the hail of projectiles from Sedd-ul-Bahr and Kum Kale, as well as from mobile batteries cunningly concealed in difficult ground, proceeded with slow and grim determination.  All across them the sea was churned by the ricochetting shells, while ever and anon a terrific waterspout accompanied by a dull roar showed that they were making good work in clearing away the hostile mines.  The Turks, in spite of the huge 12-inch projectiles that hailed incessantly upon the forts, stood to their guns with fanatical bravery. Tons of brickwork and masonry would be hurled high in the air, after taking with them the mangled remains of the Ottoman gunners and up-ending the Turkish weapon as easily as if it were a mere drain-pipe. Yet a few minutes later the defenders would bring up a field-piece and blaze away across the ruins at the nearest of the British mine-sweepers.  \"Port 6-inch battery to fire,\" came the order.  Almost simultaneously the six secondary armament guns added their quota of death and destruction to the slower crash of the heavier weapons in the barbettes.  The _Hammerer_ and her consorts were rapidly closing the shore, taking advantage of the already seriously damaged forts.  It was by no means a one-sided engagement.  Shells from the Turkish defences were ricochetting all around the British"]]]
