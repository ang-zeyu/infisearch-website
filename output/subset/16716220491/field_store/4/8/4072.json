Just inside the edge of the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and unrevealing.  He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples, but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him from behind.  A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker--asleep and unprotected behind the _Marco's_ open port....         *       *       *       *       *  He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him. For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and could not.  He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.  The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet, but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the danger of predicament. _Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first_, he thought. _That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle._  Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his belt and call Stryker....  He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and failed.  His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny surface ripples.  On shore he could see the _Marco Four_ resting between thorn forest and beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open, and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet returned with the scouter.  He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip--unfelt before--was pressing against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....  The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.  \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out--_Stryker_!\"  The audicom hummed gently, without answer.  He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before. Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be easily disturbed.  The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless suggestion of flapping wings.         *       *       *       *       *  He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"  The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but Gibson's.  \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"  Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that--get here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards--\"  He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought with shock-born lucidity: _I wanted a backstage look at this show, and now I'm one of the cast_.  The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.  Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the moment, Arthur--blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"  The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native. The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.  Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid Arzian native carefully above water between them.  \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've gone mad.\"  The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right, Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe in the _Marco_.\"  Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"  Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd had any brains. It was under water, of course.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In the _Marco Four_, Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear of being permanently disabled.  \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean bottom--a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"  Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for buildings?\"  \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago--by men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture--and was submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of their own.\"  \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink fishers--\"  \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be armed invasion.\"  \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why couldn't we share the planet?\"  \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\" Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last night.\"  \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the pink fishers for--\"  Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there deliberately, like worms on a hook--angling in reverse! No wonder I couldn't spot their motivation!\"  Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze. \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up to the acceleration, Arthur?\"  Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"  He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused, blasted the _Marco Four_ free of Arz."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32676"],["title","The Test Colony (#1)"],["body","at the resumption of quartering in the ship. Reluctantly, the women began rolling up the still-deflated air-mattresses that were scattered about the soft, deep grass. Sue complained, \"Sam, if these people don't get a little privacy pretty soon we'll turn into an ant colony. There'll be lovin' in the streets.\"  \"It's not my idea,\" I said. \"I'll be nailed to a table at the foot of the ramp all day making check marks. Phil is taking this entirely too big. The little people are really charming. He neglected to mention that they are beautifully formed and quite gentle in their--their actions.\"  \"Actions?\" she said. \"What happened, really?\"  I described the conditions under which we first saw the natives, and she laughed a little strainedly. \"I can just imagine the look on Phil Benson's face.\"  I knew what she meant. In trying to enforce the shipboard rule of segregation of the sexes, our leader had developed an oversensitive attitude toward certain aspects of modesty. In the unutterable boredom of space, the pledge we had all taken to complete continence for the voyage was a severe test to all forty couples.  Had propriety and space considerations been the only reasons for the infamous \"no-romance\" regulation, it would never have held up. But all concerned realized the problem of childbirth in space under the jam-packed living conditions, tight water and food rationing and the fetid, recirculated air.  Now the second honeymoons were over before they started. It was back to the ship and the night-life of monks and nuns.  That night, Sue and I joined the four ship's officers, their wives, Phillip Benson and Jane in the navigation cupola atop our doomed ship that had become a \"fortress\". The small control room was the only semi-private room in the ship, and even Benson was admitted by invitation only. The meeting was a council of war, so to speak, and the officers were pressed into service to organize and operate the security guard.  When the guard watch was worked out for a week in advance, I spoke up. \"I think we're getting off on the wrong foot, Phil. We can't stay penned up like animals at night and expect to function as humans.\"  Benson argued: \"We are a carefully balanced group, Sam. We can't afford casualties. Look at our medical corps, two doctors and four nurses. Suppose we were attacked and lost them?\"  Captain Spooner, whose authority had lapsed when we touched down, backed up Benson. \"I see no great hardship in the precautions. Inconvenience, yes, but nothing that the danger doesn't fully justify.\"  He was a cocky, virile, bald-headed little terrier of 35 years. His very young wife and the wives of the other three officers seemed only lightly perturbed at the prospects of continuing celibacy, which confirmed my suspicions.  I said, \"That's gritty of you, Captain, but remember, the rest of us haven't had the relative privacy of the bridge. If this restriction continues long I predict violations of the discipline, and probably some serious behaviour problems.\"  My position as colony psychologist had become somewhat obscured under the snowstorm of paperwork that my secondary job as official scribe had brought. Benson seemed now to recall that mental health _was_ my concern. He said, \"I thought you reported high morale upon arrival.\"  \"I did, but the tensions are there, and it's foolish to draw them too tightly. We have a well-picked, highly adaptable group of people. Let's keep them that way. The quicker we hit a more normal existence the less risk we run of emotional disturbances.\"  \"They'll take it,\" Benson said positively, and Spooner nodded in arrogant agreement.         *       *       *       *       *  My 20-hour wristwatch, geared to the shorter rotation of Sirius XXII, said nine o'clock, one hour before noon, when the women began undressing.  There had been an air of conspiracy among them all morning, a studied casualness as they wandered around near the ship, forming small conversational eddies, dispersing and reforming elsewhere. I had just finished checking in the 11-man fruit-gathering detail. I looked up from my roster in time to see the first motions of the \"great disrobing\". Zippers unzipped, snaps popped open, slacks, skirts, blouses and jumpers fell to the grass, and a dazzling spectacle of space-bleached feminine epidermis burst into view.  The ladies were very calm about it, but a chorus of yips sounded and swelled into a circus of cheers from the male working parties.  Before I could fathom it Benson came charging down the ramp followed by his fruit-stowing detail. He stopped at the foot of the ramp, mouth open and eyes pinched with annoyance.  [Illustration]  He spotted Jane and Sue. \"What is going on out here?\" he demanded loudly.  Our two wives waved at us and strolled over, doing a splendid job of acting unconcerned. \"Just a little sun-bathing,\" Jane said, shooing a small insect from a pale shoulder.  Susan refused to meet my eye. She was watching two birds soar overhead. \"It's fantastic,\" she said. \"If you don't look at things too closely, you'd never know we weren't at a summer camp up in Wisconsin--except for the fruits. They remind me more of Tahiti. It's marvelous! The mosquitoes don't even bite.\"  \"They will,\" I said, \"as soon as they get a good taste of human blood. And baby, you're sure making it easy for them.\"  Benson was distracted from the conversation by the converging male colonists, who were whooping and yelling like a horde of school boys. He backed up the ramp and ordered, \"Let's get on with the work. You've seen your wives in the altogether before.\"  The men quieted a little, but one yelled, \"Yeah, but not lately!\"  Another added, \"And not _all together_.\"  In spite of the fact that nude sun-bathing was a commonplace, twenty-second-century custom on Earth, by tacit consent clothes had been worn at all times aboard ship. The women had gone along with Benson for two years on such matters, so this was clearly a feminine protest against the spirit of the yellow alert.  Young doctors Sorenson and Bailey came trotting up, grinning appreciatively but wagging their fingers. Without consulting Benson, Bailey mounted the ramp and shouted, \"Blondes and redheads, ten minutes exposure. Brunettes, fifteen.\"  A great booing issued from the men, but Bailey held up his hand for silence. \"The medical staff will make no effort to enforce these exposure maximums, but be advised that the radiation here is about the same as Miami Beach in June, so don't let the air-conditioning fool you.\"  Benson was spared further decisions on the issue, because at that moment one of the sentries remembered to take a quick look at the vector of forest he was supposed to be guarding. Unable to make his voice heard over the hub-hub, the guard fired his pistol in the air.  We all jumped up and stared, and Benson muttered, \"Dear God!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Our people were scattered over an acre around the ramp, and encompassing them was a semi-circle of at least a hundred \"savages\", frozen like bronze statues at the sound of the gun-shot. They curved in an arc less than a hundred yards from the ship.  Their hands were empty of weapons, and their motionless attitudes were in no way threatening. To the contrary, they seemed small and quite inoffensive except for their numbers.  Acting in my capacity as psychologist, I ran up the ramp and called out as calmly as a shout would permit, \"Everybody take it easy! Don't make any quick moves. Above all, don't anyone fire off a weapon again unless there is an obvious attack.\"  Benson clutched my arm. \"Are you mad? We've got to get the women inside.\"  \"That's what I'm thinking,\" I said. \"But if we invite attack by running they won't all make it.\"  \"They aren't armed. The men can stand them off.\"  \"Then what are you worrying about?\" I demanded. \"Relax for a minute and see what happens.\"  Benson simmered and reluctantly accepted my logic. Meanwhile, the line of natives became mobile again. They closed in at a casual saunter, rolling off the balls of their long feet with a peculiar, slow, bouncing motion.  A ripple of subdued exclamations ran through our people, and in turn the little natives moved their lips, turned their heads to one another and seemed to be commenting among themselves.  Benson began hissing futile commands for the women to start boarding the ship. No one paid any attention. I could sense no great danger in the situation. In fact I felt more attracted than repelled by the little golden-haired creatures.  Bailey, who was still on the ramp, took a different view. He called out, \"They don't look dangerous, but keep away from them. Lord knows what kind of bugs they may have in them.\"  It was a sobering thought. Their most insignificant disease germ might easily wipe out our colony if it proved contagious.  Yet, how could we stop these natives without inflicting bloodshed? On they came in their shambling, loose-gaited walk. Benson was unsnapping his holster flap, and even the highly curious women were beginning to shrink back toward the gangplank, when a light breeze swept through us from behind. It rustled the grass softly and moved into the natives, only 20 yards away.  The wavering line stopped again. Segments began to retreat, first singly, then in pairs and groups. All but a handful of the most curious suddenly bounded for the forest and disappeared.  The others came forward again, but with increasing bewilderment. Repeatedly, they raised their noses and sniffed the air.  Bailey said from behind us, \"They catch our scent and don't know what to make of it. Thank heavens most of them took off. We can handle a dozen of them easily enough.\"  Our people opened ranks and let the little creatures infiltrate. Sue squeezed my arm. \"Why, they're beautiful little things! They make me feel self-conscious with my bleached-out skin. They certainly look intelligent, those eyes--no fear in them at all--look, they're even smiling!\"  Indeed,"]]]
