We have attempted to render his book, without comment, faithfully into English. Not only have we endeavored to give his thought without increase or diminution, but have also tried to preserve the main characteristics of his style. On the one hand, we have carefully shunned idioms peculiar to the French; on the other, when permitted by the laws of structure common to both languages, we have followed the general order of sentences, even the succession of words. It has been our aim to make this work wholly Cousin's in substance, and in form as nearly his as possible, with a total change of dress. That, however, we may have nowhere missed a shade of meaning, nowhere introduced a gallicism, is too much to be hoped for, too much to be demanded.  M. Cousin, in his Philosophical Discussions, defines the terms that he uses. In the translation of these we have maintained uniformity, so that in this regard no farther explanation is necessary.  This is, perhaps, in a philosophical point of view, the most important of all M. Cousin's works, for it contains a complete summary and lucid exposition of the various parts of his system. It is now the last word of European philosophy, and merits serious and thoughtful attention.  This and many more like it, are needed in these times, when noisy and pretentious demagogues are speaking of metaphysics with idiotic laughter, when utilitarian statesmen are sneering at philosophy, when undisciplined sectarians of every kind are decrying it; when, too, earnest men, in state and church, men on whose shoulders the social world really rests, are invoking philosophy, not only as the best instrument of the highest culture and the severest mental discipline, but also as the best human means of guiding politics towards the eternally true and the eternally just, of preserving theology from the aberrations of a zeal without knowledge, and from the perversion of the interested and the cunning; when many an artist, who feels the nobility of his calling, who would address the mind of man rather than his senses, is asking a generous philosophy to explain to him that ravishing and torturing Ideal which is ever eluding his grasp, which often discourages unless understood; when, above all, devout and tender souls are learning to prize philosophy, since, in harmony with Revelation, it strengthens their belief in God, freedom, immortality.  Grateful to an indulgent public, on both sides of the ocean, for a kindly and very favorable reception of our version of M. Cousin's \"Course of the History of Modern Philosophy,\" we add this translation of his \"Lectures on the True, the Beautiful, and the Good,\" hoping that his explanation of human nature will aid some in solving the grave problem of life,--for there are always those, and the most gifted, too, who feel the need of understanding themselves,--believing that his eloquence, his elevated sentiment, and elevated thought, will afford gratification to a refined taste, a chaste imagination, and a disciplined mind.

PART FIRST.--THE TRUE.  LECTURE I.--THE EXISTENCE OF UNIVERSAL AND NECESSARY PRINCIPLES       39      Two great wants, that of absolute truths, and that of absolute     truths that may not be chimeras. To satisfy these two wants is     the problem of the philosophy of our time.--Universal and     necessary principles.--Examples of different kinds of such     principles.--Distinction between universal and necessary     principles and general principles.--Experience alone is     incapable of explaining universal and necessary principles, and     also incapable of dispensing with them in order to arrive at the     knowledge of the sensible world.--Reason as being that faculty     of ours which discovers to us these principles.--The study of     universal and necessary principles introduces us to the highest     parts of philosophy.  LECTURE II.--ORIGIN OF UNIVERSAL AND NECESSARY PRINCIPLES             51      _Résumé_ of the preceding Lecture. A new question, that of the     origin of universal and necessary principles.--Danger of this     question, and its necessity.--Different forms under which truth     presents itself to us, and the successive order of these forms:     theory of spontaneity and reflection.--The primitive form of     principles; abstraction that disengages them from that form,     and gives them their actual form.--Examination and refutation of     the theory that attempts to explain the origin of principles by     an induction founded on particular notions.  LECTURE III.--ON THE VALUE OF UNIVERSAL AND NECESSARY PRINCIPLES      65      Examination and refutation of Kant's skepticism.--Recurrence to     the theory of spontaneity and reflection.  LECTURE IV.--GOD THE PRINCIPLE OF PRINCIPLES                          75      Object of the lecture: What is the ultimate basis of absolute     truth?--Four hypotheses: Absolute truth may reside either in us,     in particular beings and the world, in itself, or in God. 1. We     perceive absolute truth, we do not constitute it. 2. Particular     beings participate in absolute truth, but do not explain it;     refutation of Aristotle. 3. Truth does not exist in itself;     defence of Plato. 4. Truth resides in God.--Plato; St.     Augustine; Descartes; Malebranche; Fénelon; Bossuet;     Leibnitz.--Truth the mediator between God and man.--Essential     distinctions.  LECTURE V.--ON MYSTICISM                                             102      Distinction between the philosophy that we profess and     mysticism. Mysticism consists in pretending to know God without     an intermediary.--Two sorts of mysticism.--Mysticism of     sentiment. Theory of sensibility. Two sensibilities--the one     external, the other internal, and corresponding to the soul as     external sensibility corresponds to nature.--Legitimate part of     sentiment.--Its aberrations.--Philosophical mysticism. Plotinus:     God, or absolute unity, perceived without an intermediary by     pure thought.--Ecstasy.--Mixture of superstition and abstraction     in mysticism.--Conclusion of the first part of the course.   PART SECOND.--THE BEAUTIFUL.  LECTURE VI.--THE BEAUTIFUL IN THE MIND OF MAN                        123      The method that must govern researches on the beautiful and art     is, as in the investigation of the true, to commence by     psychology.--Faculties of the soul that unite in the perception     of the beautiful.--The senses give only the agreeable; reason     alone gives the idea of the beautiful.--Refutation of     empiricism, that confounds the agreeable and the     beautiful.--Pre-eminence of reason.--Sentiment of the beautiful;     different from sensation and desire.--Distinction between the     sentiment of the beautiful and that of the     sublime.--Imagination.--Influence of sentiment on     imagination.--Influence of imagination on sentiment.--Theory of     taste.  LECTURE VII.--THE BEAUTIFUL IN OBJECTS                               140      Refutation of different theories on the nature of the beautiful:     the beautiful cannot be reduced to what is useful.--Nor to     convenience.--Nor to proportion.--Essential characters of the     beautiful.--Different kinds of beauties. The beautiful and the     sublime. Physical beauty. Intellectual beauty. Moral     beauty.--Ideal beauty: it is especially moral beauty.--God, the     first principle of the beautiful.--Theory of Plato.  LECTURE VIII.--ON ART                                                154      Genius:--its attribute is creative power.--Refutation of the     opinion that art is the imitation of nature--M. Emeric David,     and M. Quatremère de Quincy.--Refutation of the theory of     illusion. That dramatic art has not solely for its end to excite     the passions of terror and pity.--Nor even directly the moral     and religious sentiment.--The proper and direct object of art is     to produce the idea and the sentiment of the beautiful; this     idea and this sentiment purify and elevate the soul by the     affinity between the beautiful and the good, and by the relation     of ideal beauty to its principle, which is God.--True mission of     art.  LECTURE IX.--THE DIFFERENT ARTS                                      165      Expression is the general law of art.--Division of     arts.--Distinction between liberal arts and trades.--Eloquence     itself, philosophy, and history do not make a part of the fine     arts.--That the arts gain nothing by encroaching upon each     other, and usurping each other's means and     processes.--Classification of the arts:--its true principle is     expression.--Comparison of arts with each other.--Poetry the     first of arts.  LECTURE X.--FRENCH ART IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY                    178      Expression not only serves to appreciate the different arts, but     the different schools of art. Example:--French art in the     seventeenth century. French poetry:--Corneille. Racine. Molière.     La Fontaine.

LECTURE XI.--PRIMARY NOTIONS OF COMMON SENSE                         215      Extent of the question of the good.--Position of the question     according to the psychological method: What is, in regard to the     good, the natural belief of mankind?--The natural beliefs of     humanity must not be sought in a pretended state of nature.--     Study of the sentiments and ideas of men in languages, in life,     in consciousness.--Disinterestedness and devotedness.--Liberty.--     Esteem and contempt.--Respect.--Admiration and indignation.--     Dignity.--Empire of opinion.--Ridicule.--Regret and repentance.--     Natural and necessary foundations of all justice.--Distinction     between fact and right.--Common sense, true and false philosophy.  LECTURE XII.--THE ETHICS OF INTEREST                                 229      Exposition of the doctrine of interest.--What there is of truth     in this doctrine.--Its defects. 1st. It confounds liberty and     desire, and thereby abolishes liberty. 2d. It cannot explain the     fundamental distinction between good and evil. 3d. It cannot     explain obligation and duty. 4th. Nor right. 5th. Nor the     principle of merit and demerit.--Consequences of the ethics of     interest: that they cannot admit a providence, and lead to     despotism.  LECTURE XIII.--OTHER DEFECTIVE PRINCIPLES                            255      The ethics of sentiment.--The ethics founded on the principle of     the interest of the greatest number.--The ethics founded on the     will of God alone.--The ethics founded on the punishments and     rewards of another life.  LECTURE XIV.--TRUE PRINCIPLES OF ETHICS                              274      Description of the different facts that compose the moral     phenomena.--Analysis of each of these facts:--1st, Judgment and     idea of the good. That this judgment is absolute. Relation     between the true and the good.--2d, Obligation. Refutation of     the doctrine of Kant that draws the idea of the good from     obligation instead of founding obligation on the idea of the     good.--3d, Liberty, and the moral notions attached to the notion     of liberty.--4th, Principle of merit and demerit. Punishments     and rewards.--5th, Moral sentiments.--Harmony of all these facts     in nature and science.

It is not towards the individual, but towards the moral     person that one is obligated. Principle of all individual     duties,--to respect and develop the moral person.--Social     ethics,--duties of justice and duties of charity.--Civil     society. Government. Law. The right to punish.  LECTURE XVI.--GOD THE PRINCIPLE OF THE IDEA OF THE GOOD              325      Principle on which true theodicea rests. God the last foundation     of moral truth, of the good, and of the moral person.--Liberty     of God.--The divine justice and charity.--God the sanction of     the moral law. Immortality of the soul; argument from merit and     demerit; argument from the simplicity of the soul; argument from     final causes.--Religious sentiment.--Adoration.--Worship.--Moral     beauty of Christianity.  LECTURE XVII.--RÉSUMÉ OF DOCTRINE                                    346      Review of the doctrine contained in these lectures, and the     three orders of facts on which this doctrine rests, with the     relation of each one of them to the modern school that has     recognized and developed it, but almost always exaggerated     it.--Experience and empiricism.--Reason and idealism.--Sentiment     and mysticism.--Theodicea. Defects of different known     systems.--The process that conducts to true theodicea, and the     character of certainty and reality that this process gives to     it.   APPENDIX                                                             371     LECTURES  ON  THE TRUE, THE BEAUTIFUL, AND THE GOOD.     DISCOURSE  PRONOUNCED AT THE OPENING OF THE COURSE,  DECEMBER 4, 1817.     PHILOSOPHY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.      Spirit and general principles of the Course.--Object of the     Lectures of this year:--application of the principles of which     an exposition is given, to the three Problems of the True, the     Beautiful, and the Good.   It seems natural that a century, in its beginning, should borrow its philosophy from the century that preceded it. But, as free and intelligent beings, we are not born merely to continue our predecessors, but to increase their work, and also to do our own. We cannot accept from them an inheritance except under the condition of improving it. Our first duty is, then, to render to ourselves an account of the philosophy of the eighteenth century; to recognize its character and its principles, the problems which it agitated, and the solutions which it gave of them; to discern, in fine, what it transmits to us of the true and the productive, and what it also leaves of the sterile and the false, in order that, with reflective choice, we may embrace the former and reject the latter.[3] Placed at the entrance of the new times, let us know, first of all, with what views we would occupy ourselves. Moreover,--why should I not say it?--after two years of instruction, in which the professor, in some sort, has been investigating himself, one has a right to demand of him what he is; what are his most general principles on all the essential parts of philosophic science; what flag, in fine, in the midst of parties which contend with each other so violently, he proposes for you, young men, who frequent this auditory, and who are called upon to participate in a destiny still so uncertain and so obscure in the nineteenth century, to follow.         *       *       *       *       *  It is not patriotism, it is a profound sentiment of truth and justice, which makes us place the whole philosophy now expanded in the world under the invocation of the name of Descartes. Yes, the whole of modern philosophy is the work of this great man, for it owes to him the spirit that animates it, and the method that constitutes its power.  After the downfall of scholasticism and the mournful disruptures of the sixteenth century, the first object which the bold good sense of Descartes proposed to itself was to make philosophy a human science, like astronomy, physiology, medicine, subject to the same uncertainties and to the same aberrations, but capable also of the same progress.  Descartes encountered the skepticism spread on every side in the train of so many revolutions, ambitious hypotheses, born out of the first use of an ill-regulated liberty, and the old formulas surviving the ruins of scholasticism. In his courageous passion for truth, he resolved to reject, provisorily at least, all the ideas that hitherto he had received without controlling them, firmly decided not to admit any but those which, after a serious examination, might appear to him evident. But he perceived that there was one thing which he could not reject, even provisorily, in his universal doubt,--that thing was the existence itself of his doubt, that is to say, of his thought; for although all the rest might be only an illusion, this fact, that he thought, could not be an illusion. Descartes, therefore, stopped at this fact, of an irresistible evidence, as at the first truth which he could accept without fear. Recognizing at the same time that thought is the necessary instrument of all the investigations which he might propose to himself, as well as the instrument of the human race in the acquisition of its natural knowledges,[4] he devoted himself to a regular study of it, to the analysis of thought as the condition of all legitimate philosophy, and upon this solid foundation he reared a doctrine of a character at once certain and living, capable of resisting skepticism, exempt from hypotheses, and affranchised from the formulas of the schools.  Thus the analysis of thought, and of the mind which is the subject of it, that is to say, psychology, has become the point of departure, the most general principle, the important method of modern philosophy.[5]  Nevertheless, it must indeed be owned, philosophy has not entirely lost, and sometimes still retains, since Descartes and in Descartes himself, its old habits. It rarely belongs to the same man to open and run a career, and usually the inventor succumbs under the weight of his own invention. So Descartes, after having so well placed the point of departure for all philosophical investigation, more than once forgets analysis, and returns, at least in form, to the ancient philosophy.[6] The true method, again, is more than once effaced in the hands of his first successors, under the always increasing influence of the mathematical method.  Two periods may be distinguished in the Cartesian era,--one in which the method, in its newness, is often misconceived; the other, in which one is forced, at least, to re-enter the salutary way opened by Descartes. To the first belong Malebranche, Spinoza, Leibnitz himself; to the second, the philosophers of the eighteenth century.  Without doubt Malebranche, upon some points, descended very far into interior investigation; but most of the time he gave himself up to wander in an imaginary world, and lost sight of the real world. It is not a method that is wanting to Spinoza, but a good method; his error consists in having applied to philosophy the geometrical method, which proceeds by axioms, definitions, theorems, corollaries; no one has made less use of the psychological"]]]
