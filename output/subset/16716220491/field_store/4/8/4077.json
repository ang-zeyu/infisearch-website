She moved a pace backward and straightened her clothing. \"I don't know what happened. I was looking for someone too.\"  He smiled again. \"And then you ran.\"  \"I don't know why. I guess--\"  \"What's your name.\"  \"Nora--Nora Spade.\"  \"You slept through it too?\"  \"Yes ... yes. I slept through it and came out and they were all gone.\"  \"Let's get out of this alley.\" He preceded her out, but he waited for her when there was room for them to walk side by side, and she did not try to run away. That phase was evidently over.  \"I got slipped a mickey in a tavern,\" Frank Brooks said. \"Then they slugged me and put me in a hole.\"  His eyes questioned. She felt their demand and said, \"I was--asleep in my hotel room.\"  \"They overlooked you?\"  \"I guess so.\"  \"Then you don't know anything about it?\"  \"Nothing. Something terrible must have happened.\"  \"Let's go down this way,\" Frank said, and they moved toward Madison Street. He had taken her arm and she did not pull away. Rather, she walked invitingly close to him.  She said, \"It's so spooky. So ... empty. I guess that's what scared me.\"  \"It would scare anybody. There must have been an evacuation of some kind.\"  \"Maybe the Russians are going to drop a bomb.\"  Frank shook his head. \"That wouldn't explain it. I mean, the Russians wouldn't let us know ahead of time. Besides, the army would be here. Everybody wouldn't be gone.\"  \"There's been a lot of talk about germ warfare. Do you suppose the water, maybe, has been poisoned?\"  He shook his head. \"The same thing holds true. Even if they moved the people out, the army would be here.\"  \"I don't know. It just doesn't make sense.\"  \"It happened, so it has to make sense. It was something that came up all of a sudden. They didn't have much more than twenty-four hours.\" He stopped suddenly and looked at her. \"We've got to get out of here!\"  Nora Spade smiled for the first time, but without humor. \"How? I haven't seen one car. The buses aren't running.\"  His mind was elsewhere. They had started walking again. \"Funny I didn't think of that before.\"  \"Think of what?\"  \"That anybody left in this town is a dead pigeon. The only reason they'd clear out a city would be to get away from certain death. That would mean death is here for anybody that stays. Funny. I was so busy looking for somebody to talk to that I never thought of that.\"  \"I did.\"  \"Is that what you were scared of?\"  \"Not particularly. I'm not afraid to die. It was something else that scared me. The aloneness, I guess.\"  \"We'd better start walking west--out of the city. Maybe we'll find a car or something.\"  \"I don't think we'll find any cars.\"  He drew her to a halt and looked into her face. \"You aren't afraid at all, are you?\"  She thought for a moment. \"No, I guess I'm not. Not of dying, that is. Dying is a normal thing. But I was afraid of the empty streets--nobody around. That was weird.\"  \"It isn't weird now?\"  \"Not--not as much.\"  \"I wonder how much time we've got?\"  Nora shrugged. \"I don't know, but I'm hungry.\"  \"We can fix that. I broke into a restaurant a few blocks back and got myself a sandwich. I think there's still food around. They couldn't take it all with them.\"  They were on Madison Street and they turned east on the south side of the street. Nora said, \"I wonder if there are any other people still here--like us?\"  \"I think there must be. Not very many, but a few. They would have had to clean four million people out overnight. It stands to reason they must have missed a few. Did you ever try to empty a sack of sugar? Really empty it? It's impossible. Some of the grains always stick to the sack.\"  A few minutes later the wisdom of this observation was proven when they came to a restaurant with the front window broken out and saw a man and a woman sitting at one of the tables.         *       *       *       *       *  He was a huge man with a shock of black hair and a mouth slightly open showing a set of incredibly white teeth. He waved an arm and shouted, \"Come on in! Come on in for crissake and sit down! We got beer and roast beef and the beer's still cold. Come on in and meet Minna.\"  This was different, Nora thought. Not eerie. Not weird, like seeing a man standing on a deserted street corner with no one else around. This seemed normal, natural, and even the smashed window didn't detract too much from the naturalness.  They went inside. There were chairs at the table and they sat down. The big man did not get up. He waved a hand toward his companion and said, \"This is Minna. Ain't she something? I found her sitting at an empty bar scared to death. We came to an understanding and I brought her along.\" He grinned at the woman and winked. \"We came to a real understanding, didn't we, Minna?\"  Minna was a completely colorless woman of perhaps thirty-five. Her skin was smooth and pale and she wore no makeup of any kind. Her hair was drawn straight back into a bun. The hair had no predominating color. It was somewhere between light brown and blond.  She smiled a little sadly, but the laugh did not cover her worn, tired look. It seemed more like a gesture of obedience than anything else. \"Yes. We came to an understanding.\"  \"I'm Jim Wilson,\" the big man boomed. \"I was in the Chicago Avenue jug for slugging a guy in a card game. They kind of overlooked me when they cleaned the joint out.\" He winked again. \"I kind of helped them overlook me. Then I found Minna.\" There was tremendous relish in his words.  Frank started introductions which Nora Spade cut in on. \"Maybe you know what happened?\" she asked.  Wilson shook his head. \"I was in the jug and they didn't tell us. They just started cleaning out the joint. There was talk in the bullpen--invasion or something. Nobody knew for sure. Have some beer and meat.\"  Nora turned to the quiet Minna. \"Did you hear anything?\"  \"Naw,\" Wilson said with a kind of affectionate contempt. \"She don't know anything about it. She lived in some attic dump and was down with a sore throat. She took some pills or something and when she woke up they were gone.\"  \"I went to work and--\" Minna began, but Wilson cut her off.  \"She swabs out some joints on Chicago Avenue for a living and that was how she happened to be sitting in that tavern. It's payday, and Minna was waiting for her dough!\" He exploded into laughter and slapped the table with a huge hand. \"Can you beat that? Waiting for her pay at a time like this.\"  Frank Brooks set down his beer bottle. The beer was cold and it tasted good. \"Have you met anybody else? There must be some other people around.\"  \"Uh-uh. Haven't met anybody but Minna.\" He turned his eyes on the woman again, then got to his feet. \"Come on, Minna. You and I got to have a little conference. We got things to talk about.\" Grinning, he walked toward the rear of the restaurant. Minna got up more slowly. She followed him behind the counter and into the rear of the place.  Alone with Nora, Frank said, \"You aren't eating. Want me to look for something else?\"  \"No--I'm not very hungry. I was just wondering--\"  \"Wondering about what?\"  \"When it will happen. When whatever is going to happen--you know what I mean.\"  \"I'd rather know _what's_ going to happen. I hate puzzles. It's hell to have to get killed and not know what killed you.\"  \"We aren't being very sensible, are we?\"  \"How do you mean?\"  \"We should at least act normal.\"  \"I don't get it.\"  Nora frowned in slight annoyance. \"Normal people would be trying to reach safety. They wouldn't be sitting in a restaurant drinking beer. We should be trying to get away. Even if it does mean walking. Normal people would be trying to get away.\"  Frank stared at his bottle for a moment. \"We should be scared stiff, shouldn't we?\"  It was Nora's turn to ponder. \"I'm not sure. Maybe not. I know I'm not fighting anything inside--fear, I mean. I just don't seem to care one way or another.\"  \"I care,\" Frank replied. \"I care. I don't want to die. But we're faced with a situation, and either way it's a gamble. We might be dead before I finish this bottle of beer. If that's true, why not sit here and be comfortable? Or we might have time to walk far enough to get out of range of whatever it is that chased everybody.\"  \"Which way do you think it is?\"  \"I don't think we have time to get out of town. They cleaned it out too fast. We'd need at least four or five hours to get away. If we had that much time the army, or whoever did it, would still be around.\"  \"Maybe they didn't know themselves when it's going to happen.\"  He made an impatient gesture. \"What difference does it make? We're in a situation we didn't ask to get in. Our luck put us here and I'm damned if I'm going to kick a hole in the ceiling and yell for help.\"  Nora was going to reply, but at that moment Jim Wilson came striding out front. He wore his big grin and he carried another half-dozen bottles of beer. \"Minna'll be out in a minute,\" he said. \"Women are always slower than hell.\"  He dropped into a chair and snapped the cap off a beer bottle with his thumb. He held the bottle up and squinted through it, sighing gustily. \"Man! I ain't never had it so good.\" He tilted the bottle in salute, and drank.         *       *       *       *       *  The sun was lowering in the west now, and when Minna reappeared it seemed that she materialized from the shadows, so quietly did she move. Jim Wilson opened another bottle and put it before her. \"Here--have a drink, baby.\"  Obediently, she tilted the bottle and drank.  \"What do you plan to do?\" Frank asked.  \"It'll be dark soon,\" Wilson said. \"We ought to go out and try to scrounge some flashlights. I bet the power plants are dead. Probably aren't any flashlights either.\"  \"Are you going to stay here?\" Nora asked. \"Here in the Loop?\"  He seemed surprised. \"Why not? A man'd be a fool to walk out on all this. All he wants to eat and drink. No goddam cops around. The life of Reilly and I should walk out?\" "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],["title","Triplanetary (#1)"],["body","races adherent to Civilization. No Eddorian ever had anything even remotely resembling a sense of humor.  While not essentially bloodthirsty--that is, not loving bloodshed for its own sweet sake--they were no more averse to blood-letting than they were in favor of it. Any amount of killing which would or which might advance an Eddorian toward his goal was commendable; useless slaughter was frowned upon, not because it was slaughter, but because it was useless--and hence inefficient.  And, instead of the multiplicity of goals sought by the various entities of any race of Civilization, each and every Eddorian had only one. The same one: power. _Power!_ P-O-W-E-R!!  Since Eddore was peopled originally by various races, perhaps as similar to each other as are the various human races of Earth, it is understandable that the early history of the planet--while it was still in its own space, that is--was one of continuous and ages-long war. And, since war always was and probably always will be linked solidly to technological advancement, the race now known simply as \"The Eddorians\" became technologists supreme. All other races disappeared. So did all other forms of life, however lowly, which interfered in any way with the Masters of the Planet.  Then, all racial opposition liquidated and overmastering lust as unquenched as ever, the surviving Eddorians fought among themselves: \"push-button\" wars employing engines of destruction against which the only possible defense was a fantastic thickness of planetary bedrock.  Finally, unable either to kill or to enslave each other, the comparatively few survivors made a peace of sorts. Since their own space was practically barren of planetary systems, they would move their planet from space to space until they found one which so teemed with planets that each living Eddorian could become the sole Master of an ever increasing number of worlds. This was a program very much worthwhile, promising as it did an outlet for even the recognizedly insatiable Eddorian craving for power. Therefore the Eddorians, for the first time in their prodigiously long history of fanatical non-cooperation, decided to pool their resources of mind and of material and to work as a group.  Union of a sort was accomplished eventually; neither peaceably nor without highly lethal friction. They knew that a democracy, by its very nature, was inefficient; hence a democratic form of government was not even considered. An efficient government must of necessity be dictatorial. Nor were they all exactly alike or of exactly equal ability; perfect identity of any two such complex structures was in fact impossible, and any difference, however slight, was ample justification for stratification in such a society as theirs.  Thus one of them, fractionally more powerful and more ruthless than the rest, became the All-Highest--His Ultimate Supremacy--and a group of about a dozen others, only infinitesimally weaker, became his Council; a cabinet which was later to become known as the Innermost Circle. The tally of this cabinet varied somewhat from age to age; increasing by one when a member divided, decreasing by one when a jealous fellow or an envious underling managed to perpetrate a successful assassination.  And thus, at long last, the Eddorians began really to work together. There resulted, among other things, the hyper-spatial tube and the fully inertialess drive--the drive which was, millions of years later, to be given to Civilization by an Arisian operating under the name of Bergenholm. Another result, which occured shortly after the galactic inter-passage had begun, was the eruption into normal space of the planet Eddore.  \"I must now decide whether to make this space our permanent headquarters or to search farther,\" the All-Highest radiated harshly to his Council. \"On the one hand, it will take some time for even those planets which have already formed to cool. Still more will be required for life to develop sufficiently to form a part of the empire which we have planned or to occupy our abilities to any great degree. On the other, we have already spent millions of years in surveying hundreds of millions of continua, without having found anywhere such a profusion of planets as will, in all probability, soon fill both of these galaxies. There may also be certain advantages inherent in the fact that these planets are not yet populated. As life develops, we can mold it as we please. Krongenes, what are your findings in regard to the planetary possibilities of other spaces?\"  The term \"Krongenes\" was not, in the accepted sense, a name. Or, rather, it was more than a name. It was a key-thought, in mental shorthand; a condensation and abbreviation of the life-pattern or ego of that particular Eddorian.  \"Not at all promising, Your Supremacy,\" Krongenes replied promptly. \"No space within reach of my instruments has more than a small fraction of the inhabitable worlds which will presently exist in this one.\"  \"Very well. Have any of you others any valid objections to the establishment of our empire here in this space? If so, give me your thought now.\"  No objecting thoughts appeared, since none of the monsters then knew anything of Arisia or of the Arisians. Indeed, even if they had known, it is highly improbable that any objection would have been raised. First, because no Eddorian, from the All-Highest down, could conceive or would under any circumstances admit that any race, anywhere, had ever approached or ever would approach the Eddorians in any quality whatever; and second, because, as is routine in all dictatorships, disagreement with the All-Highest did not operate to lengthen the span of life.  \"Very well. We will now confer as to ... but hold! That thought is not one of ours! Who are you, stranger, to dare to intrude thus upon a conference of the Innermost Circle?\"  \"I am Enphilistor, a younger student, of the planet Arisia.\" This name, too, was a symbol. Nor was the young Arisian yet a Watchman, as he and so many of his fellows were so soon to become, for before Eddore's arrival Arisia had had no need of Watchmen. \"I am not intruding, as you know. I have not touched any one of your minds; have not read any one of your thoughts. I have been waiting for you to notice my presence, so that we could become acquainted with each other. A surprising development, truly--we have thought for many cycles of time that we were the only highly advanced life in this universe....\"  \"Be silent, worm, in the presence of the Masters. Land your ship and surrender, and your planet will be allowed to serve us. Refuse, or even hesitate, and every individual of your race shall die.\"  \"Worm? Masters? Land my ship?\" The young Arisian's thought was pure curiosity, with no tinge of fear, dismay, or awe. \"Surrender? Serve you? I seem to be receiving your thought without ambiguity, but your meaning is entirely....\"  \"Address me as 'Your Supremacy',\" the All-Highest directed, coldly. \"Land now or die now--this is your last warning.\"  \"Your Supremacy? Certainly, if that is the customary form. But as to landing--and warning--and dying--surely you do not think that I am present in the flesh? And can it be possible that you are actually so aberrant as to believe that you can kill me--or even the youngest Arisian infant? What a peculiar--what an _extraordinary_--psychology!\"  \"Die, then, worm, if you must have it so!\" the All-Highest snarled, and launched a mental bolt whose energies were calculated to slay any living thing.  Enphilistor, however, parried the vicious attack without apparent effort. His manner did not change. He did not strike back.  The Eddorian then drove in with an analyzing probe, only to be surprised again--the Arisian's thought could not be traced! And Enphilistor, while warding off the raging Eddorian, directed a quiet thought as though he were addressing someone close by his side:  \"Come in, please, one or more of the Elders. There is a situation here which I am not qualified to handle.\"  \"We, the Elders of Arisia in fusion, are here.\" A grave, deeply resonant pseudo-voice filled the Eddorians' minds; each perceived in three-dimensional fidelity an aged, white-bearded human face. \"You of Eddore have been expected. The course of action which we must take has been determined long since. You will forget this incident completely. For cycles upon cycles of time to come no Eddorian shall know that we Arisians exist.\"  Even before the thought was issued the fused Elders had gone quietly and smoothly to work. The Eddorians forgot utterly the incident which had just happened. Not one of them retained in his conscious mind any inkling that Eddore did not possess the only intelligent life in space.         *       *       *       *       *  And upon distant Arisia a full meeting of minds was held.  \"But why didn't you simply kill them?\" Enphilistor asked. \"Such action would be distasteful in the extreme, of course--almost impossible--but even I can perceive....\" He paused, overcome by his thought.  \"That which you perceive, youth, is but a very small fraction of the whole. We did not attempt to slay them because we could not have done so. Not because of squeamishness, as you intimate, but from sheer inability. The Eddorian tenacity of life is a thing far beyond your present understanding; to have attempted to kill them would have rendered it impossible to make them forget us. We must have time ... cycles and cycles of time.\" The fusion broke off, pondered for minutes, then addressed the group as a whole:  \"We, the Elder Thinkers, have not shared fully with you our visualization of the Cosmic All, because until the Eddorians actually appeared there was always the possibility that our findings might have been in error. Now, however, there is no doubt. The Civilization which has been pictured as developing peacefully upon all the teeming planets of two galaxies will not now of itself come into being. We of Arisia should be able to"]]]
