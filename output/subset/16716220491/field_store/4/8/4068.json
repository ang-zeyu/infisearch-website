The kid had fallen for the girl as sure as I stood there.  \"Now, look,\" I said gently. \"You really want to get set with Uncle Sam, don't you?\"  \"Why, sure.\"  \"Then listen to me. I'm doing everything I can for you. And I've got a deal all lined up. I was just over at the Army recruiting station and I think everything is set. Not right away, but pretty soon.\"  \"Gosh, that's wonderful.\"  \"Now you know who your friend is.\" I came over beside him and put my hand on his shoulder. \"I got a little piece of advice for you that I want you to take to heart. Stay away from this kid, Alice. She's no good for you.\"  \"Now just a minute. You can't--\"  \"I'm sorry, kid,\" I said. I let my hand fall from his shoulder. \"Maybe I shouldn't tell you, but--\"  \"Tell me what?\"  \"It's only for your own good I'm doing this. That pretty little blonde is just going to play you for a sucker. She's already married.\"  Horatio gasped. He must have been pretty sold on the girl.  \"I don't believe it,\" he cried.  \"It's God's truth.\"  \"Who is the man?\" Horatio cried brokenly.  \"Mystiffio.\"  \"Mystiffio!\"  I nodded slowly. \"It's a tough break, kid, but the sooner you forget her the better.\" I had already decided I'd get rid of her. She wouldn't be hard to replace. Horatio was my gold mine and I didn't want anyone to do a scorched-earth job on him.  \"But she never told me,\" he muttered.  \"Naturally,\" I said. \"She'll probably even deny she's married to him now, but don't let that fool you.\"  \"No, sir,\" Horatio said. \"She won't make a sucker out of me.\" His anger must have subconsciously affected his visibility mechanism for he was visible and his lean jaw was hard, but there was a hurt look in his clear blue eyes.  \"That's the boy,\" I said. \"Just remember who your friends are and you won't go wrong.\"  \"I won't, Mr. Flannigan,\" he promised solemnly.         *       *       *       *       *  The next afternoon Morry arrived to see the act. He was dressed in a natty pin stripe suit and he wore a big yellow carnation in the buttonhole, but his sallow face was impassive.  I escorted him down the dark empty theatre to the front row.  \"Just hold your breath now,\" I told him. \"I'll have the act on stage in a jiffy.\"  He yawned and glanced at his watch.  \"I haven't got long,\" he said.  I went backstage and found Alice.  \"Hurry up,\" I said. \"Morry is waiting.\"  She looked at me as if I'd just crawled out from the wainscoating. \"I've just talked to the kid,\" she said. \"He thinks I'm poison. What kind of a yarn have you been feeding him?\"  \"Me? Why, honey, that hurts. Do you think your Uncle Patrick would breathe an unkind word about you?\"  \"Well, it's mighty strange,\" she said. \"He won't even tell me what's biting him.\"  \"I wouldn't pay any attention to him,\" I said. \"Perhaps it's all for the best.\"  \"Hmmm,\" she said, eyeing me shrewdly.  \"Come on now, be a good kid and get things rolling. A lot depends on this you know.\"  I went back and joined Morry.  Well the act was terrific. Mystiffio had Morry's eyes sticking out inside of thirty seconds. I hadn't told Morry about Horatio. I figured I'd let that angle ride for a while.  But Morry was really impressed.  \"The guy is good,\" he said. \"The things he does don't seem humanly possible.\"  Of course he didn't know that most of the effects were being created by the invisible Horatio but what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him. And he didn't miss Alice, either. When she came on stage in her cute, abbreviated little costume, he straightened up and opened his eyes.  \"The kid is nice,\" he murmured.  \"Are we in?\" I demanded.  \"Can't say yet. I gotta talk to the act but I'd say your chances were pretty good.\"  I almost swooned with happiness. The break I'd been waiting for all my life was here at last. The golden apples were about ready to drop into my lap.         *       *       *       *       *  When Mystiffio finished his routine I took Morry backstage. I found Alice.  \"Here she is, Morry,\" I said. \"And she's just as nice as she looks.\" I shoved Alice toward him. \"Be nice, baby,\" I hissed in her ear.  Morry took one of her little hands and his eyes were interested.  \"I kinda like the act,\" he said. \"If you could find time to be nice to me I might like it a whole lot.\"  Alice takes her hand back as if it had accidentally brushed something slimy.  \"I'm sorry but I don't go with the act,\" she snapped. \"There are some things worth more to me than three meals a day and a paycheck.\"  \"Okay, sister,\" Morry said without expression. He turned to me. \"Guess I made a mistake coming up here. The act is lousy.\"  \"Now wait a minute,\" I yelled. \"You said it was good. You can't walk out now.\" I wheeled to Alice. \"Baby, baby, don't do this to me. Tell him you're sorry.\"  Mystiffio came up behind us while we were talking.  \"What is the matter?\" he asked. I noticed he put an arm around Alice's shoulders. I was too distraught to think about it.  \"Nothing's wrong,\" I said desperately. \"Alice just took offense at something Morry said. Nobody meant any harm.\"  Mystiffio drew himself up straight and he grabbed Morry by the lapels. Morry struggled to free himself but he was pinioned helplessly.  \"You cad! You bounder!\" Mystiffio roared. \"Do you mean you've been making advances to my daughter?\"  Daughter! How do you like that! That just goes to show you never to trust people.  Morry pulled himself loose.  \"You're all crazy,\" he shouted. \"Lemme out of here.\"  He wheeled and started away, but before he had taken two strides he collided with a solid, unyielding, invisible substance.  He backed away a few steps, his mouth working in terror.  \"What is it?\" he screamed.  \"I'm sorry,\" Horatio's voice sounded in the air a few feet from Morry.  Morry's face went white; he stared wildly about for another instant and then charged madly out of the theatre, screaming in terror.         *       *       *       *       *  I chased after him, but it was a hopeless effort. When I got to the sidewalk he was gone. Moodily I slumped back into the theatre and went backstage. My big opportunity was gone, but I still had Horatio.  I found Alice in the office and she was alone. She smiled sweetly when she saw me.  \"You too, Brutus,\" I muttered. Then I thought about my meal ticket and looked worriedly around the room.  \"Where's Horatio?\" I snapped.  \"Horatio,\" she smiled, \"is gone. Too bad you missed him. He would have liked to say goodbye.\"  \"Goodbye!\" I shrieked. \"Where's he going?\"  \"Into the Army,\" Alice said sweetly. \"Isn't it wonderful?\"  \"You're crazy,\" I shouted. \"The Army won't take him.\"  \"I arranged a little something for him,\" Alice said. \"I'm sure he'll be very useful in the camouflage department.\"  _Camouflage!_  I groaned and sank into a chair.  \"Yes,\" Alice said pleasantly, \"when he learned that Mystiffio was my father--not my husband as you so cleverly told him--he was quite angry for a while. But of course he felt better when he thought it over. And he was very happy to take my suggestion to apply for a commission in the camouflage. I think Horatio and I are going to get along nicely.\"  I groaned again.  Mystiffio stuck his head in the door.  \"Goodbye,\" he said. \"Ready, dear?\"  \"Yes,\" Alice said, moving to the door. \"I'm ready.\"  \"Now wait a minute,\" I cried. \"Where are you two going? You're the last act I've got.\"  \"I am enlisting!\" Mystiffio said proudly.  \"As what?\"  \"Signal corps, in charge of messenger pigeons.\"  Mystiffio flapped his coat tail and a lone pigeon fluttered into the air. \"I've had a lot of experience with the little devils.\"  I groaned again and dropped my head in my hands.  What was left?  When I looked up, Mystiffio and Alice had gone.  For a moment I sat there staring about the quiet dusty office. Then I stood up and I knew what I was going to do.  I put my hat on and walked out of the building. I didn't stop walking until I reached the Marine recruiting office. A big poster said, \"The Marines Promise You Action!\"  I walked in. Nothing could be worse than what I'd just been through. I felt contented for the first time in sixteen years.         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32653"],["title","A Review of the Frogs of the Hyla bistincta Group (#1)"],["body"," robertsorum_ (Rabb and Mosimann, 1955) are known, larval characters are of limited use in intra-group systematics.

Adult male having a snout-vent length of 43.2 mm.; tibia length, 22.1 mm., 51.1 per cent of snout-vent length; foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to tip of longest toe), 20.8 mm.; greatest width of head, 15.4 mm., 35.6 per cent of snout-vent length; head length, 13.9 mm., 32.1 per cent of snout-vent length; diameter of eye, 5.1 mm.; diameter of tympanum, 2.4 mm., 47.1 per cent of diameter of eye. Snout in lateral profile bluntly rounded, in dorsal profile truncate; canthus pronounced, rounded, not angular; loreal region slightly concave; lips thick, round, not flaring; nostrils slightly protuberant; internarial distance, 3.4 mm.; interorbital distance, 4.5 mm., somewhat broader than width of eyelid, 3.5 mm. A heavy dermal fold from posterior corner of eye above tympanum and curved downward to insertion of forearm; tympanum round, its diameter slightly more than its distance from eye. Forearm not robust; row of small pustules on ventral surface of forearm; fold on wrist; prepollex moderately enlarged, covered with small, horny, nuptial spines continuous on edge of digit; row of spines on inner surface of second finger; subarticular tubercles large, round, none bifid; supernumerary tubercles rather large, round; palmar tubercles rather small, flat, elliptical; fingers long, moderately slender; length of fingers from shortest to longest, 1-2-4-3; discs moderately large, that on third finger slightly larger than tympanum; rudimentary web between first and second and between second and third fingers; web between third and fourth fingers extending about one-fourth length of fourth finger. Heels overlap by about one-third length of shank when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extends to anterior edge of eye; tarsal fold strong, extending to heel; inner metatarsal tubercle large, high, and elongate; outer metatarsal tubercle absent; subarticular tubercles moderately large, round; supernumerary tubercles small, in single rows on proximal segments of digits; toes moderately short; length of toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4, third and fifth toes about equal in length; toes about two-thirds webbed; web extending to middle of antepenultimate phalanx of fourth toe, to discs of first, second, and fifth toes, and to base of penultimate phalanx of third toe; discs rather small, about two-thirds size of those on fingers. Anal opening at level of lower edge of thighs; anal sheath elongate, deeply creased medially; transverse dermal fold above anus. Skin of dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs faintly areolate; skin of chin, belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs granular, that of ventral surfaces of limbs, except thighs, areolate; thoracic fold absent. Tongue nearly round, slightly longer than wide, shallowly notched behind and barely free posteriorly. Vomerine teeth 4-4, situated on rounded vomerine ridges between rather small ovoid inner nares; vocal slits present, situated along posterior edge of each ramus.  Color (in alcohol) pale brown on dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs; flanks and anterior surfaces of thighs creamy white with dark brown reticulations; posterior surfaces of thighs tan with creamy white spots; belly cream-color; anal stripe absent.  Color (in life) pale tan on dorsal surfaces; flanks and anterior surfaces of thighs pale creamy yellow with purplish brown reticulations; posterior surfaces of thighs tan with yellow spots; ventral surfaces yellow; iris pale copper-color.  _Variation._--There is little variation in structure. The total number of vomerine teeth varies from 6 to 14. In some individuals the supratympanic fold covers the upper part of the tympanum, but at least the lower part of the tympanum is always visible. The extent of the webbing between the toes varies from three-fourths to two-thirds complete. Usually the web extends to some point on the antepenultimate phalanx of the fourth toe, but in some specimens the web extends to the base of the penultimate phalanx.  In the large series of specimens from Uruapan, Michoacán, the coloration of the flanks and anterior surfaces of the thighs varies from nearly uniform creamy yellow with only fine dark reticulations to bold reticulations enclosing yellow spots. Some specimens from Oaxaca and Veracruz have slightly different markings on the flanks; in these the dark pigment is in the form of irregular spots or dashes, instead of reticulations.  There is considerable variation in color in the living frogs. The dorsum varies from greenish tan and pale yellowish tan to reddish brown, and some individuals are dark chocolate brown.  _Remarks._--Shannon (1951:470) named _Hyla bistincta labeculata_ on the basis of a single male from San Lucas Camotlán, Oaxaca; he diagnosed the subspecies as differing from _Hyla bistincta bistincta_ by having \"the gray reticulation of the sides entirely broken up into elongate black blotches; tarsal fold moderately elevated.\" The condition of the tarsal fold is characteristic of the species. The dispersion of dark pigment on the flanks is variable. The type of _Hyla bistincta labeculata_ (USNM 123689) is extreme in the development of dark dashes on the flanks, but this"]]]
