Of course by the time he came back the two thieves had driven the bull home and killed him for meat, so the man was obliged to go to his master and confess that he had been tricked again.  After this the Black Rogue and the Shifty Lad grew bolder and bolder, and stole great quantities of cattle and sold them and grew quite rich. One day they were returning from the market with a large sum of money in their pockets when they passed a gallows erected on the top of a hill.  ‘Let us stop and look at that gallows,’ exclaimed the Shifty Lad. ‘I have never seen one so close before. Yet some say that it is the end of all thieves.’  There was no one in sight, and they carefully examined every part of it.  ‘I wonder how it feels to be hanged,’ said the Shifty Lad. ‘I should like to know, in case they ever catch me. I’ll try first, and then you can do so.’  As he spoke he fastened the loose cord about his neck, and when it was quite secure he told the Black Rogue to take the other end of the rope and draw him up from the ground.  ‘When I am tired of it I will shake my legs, and then you must let me down,’ said he.  The Black Rogue drew up the rope, but in half a minute the Shifty Lad’s legs began to shake, and he quickly let it down again.  ‘You can’t imagine what a funny feeling hanging gives you,’ murmured the Shifty Lad, who looked rather purple in the face and spoke in an odd voice. ‘I don’t think you have every tried it, or you wouldn’t have let me go up first. Why, it is the pleasantest thing I have ever done. I was shaking my legs from sheer delight, and if you had been there you would have shaken your legs too.’  ‘Well, let me try, if it is so nice,’ answered the Black Rogue. ‘But be sure you tie the knot securely, for I don’t want to fall down and break my neck.’  ‘Oh, I will see to that!’ replied the Shifty Lad. ‘When you are tired, just whistle, and I’ll let you down.’  So the Black Rogue was drawn up, and as soon as he was as high as the rope would allow him to go the Shifty Lad called to him:  ‘Don’t forest to whistle when you want to come down; but if you are enjoying yourself as I did, shake your legs.’  And in a moment the Black Rogue’s legs began to shake and to kick, and the Shifty Lad stood below, watching him and laughing heartily.  ‘Oh, how funny you are! If you could only see yourself! Oh, you ARE funny! But when you have had enough, whistle and you shall be let down’; and he rocked again with laughter.  But no whistle came, and soon the legs ceased to shake and to kick, for the Black Gallows Bird was dead, as the Shifty Lad intended he should be.  Then he went home to the Black Rogue’s wife, and told her that her husband was dead, and that he was ready to marry her if she liked. But the woman had been fond of the Black Rogue, thief though he was, and she shrank from the Shifty Lad in horror, and set the people after him, and he had to fly to another part of the country where none knew of his doings.  Perhaps if the Shifty Lad’s mother knew anything of this, she may have thought that by this time her son might be tired of stealing, and ready to try some honest trade. But in reality he loved the tricks and danger, and life would have seemed very dull without them. So he went on just as before, and made friends whom he taught to be as wicked as himself, till they took to robbing the king’s storehouses, and by the advice of the Wise Man the king sent out soldiers to catch the band of thieves.  For a long while they tried in vain to lay hands on them. The Shifty Lad was too clever for them all, and if they laid traps he laid better ones. At last one night he stole upon some soldiers while they were asleep in a barn and killed them, and persuaded the villagers that if THEY did not kill the other soldiers before morning they would certainly be killed themselves. Thus it happened that when the sun rose not a single soldier was alive in the village.  Of course this news soon reached the king’s ears, and he was very angry, and summoned the Wise Man to take counsel with him. And this was the counsel of the Wise Man--that he should invite all the people in the countryside to a ball, and among them the bold and impudent thief would be sure to come, and would be sure to ask the king’s daughter to dance with him.  ‘Your counsel is good,’ said the king, who made his feast and prepared for his ball; and all the people of the countryside were present, and the Shifty Lad came with them.  When everyone had eaten and drunk as much as they wanted they went into the ballroom. There was a great throng, and while they were pressing through the doorway the Wise Man, who had a bottle of black ointment hidden in his robes, placed a tiny dot on the cheek of the Shifty Lad near his ear. The Shifty Lad felt nothing, but as he approached the king’s daughter to ask her to be his partner he caught sight of the black dot in a silver mirror. Instantly he guessed who had put it there and why, but he said nothing, and danced so beautifully that the princess was quite delighted with him. At the end of the dance he bowed low to his partner and left her, to mingle with the crowd that was filling the doorway. As he passed the Wise Man he contrived not only to steal the bottle but to place two black dots on his face, and one on the faces of twenty other men. Then he slipped the bottle back in the Wise Man’s robe.  By-and-by he went up to the king’s daughter again, and begged for the honour of another dance. She consented, and while he was stooping to tie the ribbons on his shoe she took out from her pocket another bottle, which the Wizard had given her, and put a black dot on his cheek. But she was not as skilful as the Wise Man, and the Shifty Lad felt the touch of her fingers; so as soon as the dance was over he contrived to place a second black dot on the faces of the twenty men and two more on the Wizard, after which he slipped the bottle into her pocket.  At length the ball came to an end, and then the king ordered all the doors to be shut, and search made for a man with two black dots on his cheek. The chamberlain went among the guests, and soon found such a man, but just as he was going to arrest him and bring him before the king his eye fell on another with the same mark, and another, and another, till he had counted twenty--besides the Wise Man--on whose face were found spots.  Not knowing what to do, the chamberlain hurried back with his tale to the king, who immediately sent for the Wise Man, and then for his daughter.  ‘The thief must have stolen your bottle,’ said the king to the Wizard.  ‘No, my lord, it is here,’ answered the Wise Man, holding it out.  ‘Then he must have got yours,’ he cried, turning to his daughter.  ‘Indeed, father, it is safe in my pocket,’ replied she, taking it out as she spoke; and they all three looked at each other and remained silent.  ‘Well,’ said the king at last, ‘the man who has done this is cleverer than most men, and if he will make himself known to me he shall marry the princess and govern half my kingdom while I am alive, and the whole of it when I am dead. Go and announce this in the ballroom,’ he added to an attendant, ‘and bring the fellow hither.’  So the attendant went into the ballroom and did as the king had bidden him, when, to his surprise, not one man, but twenty, stepped forward, all with black dots on their faces.  ‘I am the person you want,’ they all exclaimed at once, and the attendant, as much bewildered as the chamberlain had been, desired them to follow him into the king’s presence.  But the question was too difficult for the king to decide, so he called together his council. For hours they talked, but to no purpose, and in the end they hit upon a plan which they might just as well have thought of at the beginning.  And this was the plan. A child was to be brought to the palace, and next the king’s daughter would give her an apple. Then the child was to take the apple and be led into a room where the twenty men with the black dots were sitting in a ring. And to whomsoever the child gave the apple, that man should marry the king’s daughter.  ‘Of course,’ said the king, ‘it may not be the right man, after all, but then again it MAY be. Anyhow, it is the best we can do.’  The princess herself led the child into the room where the twenty men were now seated. She stood in the centre of the ring for a moment, looking at one man after another, and then held out the apple to the Shifty Lad, who was twisting a shaving of wood round his finger, and had the mouthpiece of a bagpipe hanging from his neck.  ‘You ought not to have anything which the others have not got,’ said the chamberlain, who had accompanied the princess; and he bade the child stand outside for a minute, while he took away the shaving and the mouthpiece, and made the Shifty Lad change his place. Then he called the child in, but the little girl knew him again, and went straight up to him with the apple.  ‘This is the man whom the child has twice chosen,’ said the chamberlain, signing to the Shifty Lad to kneel before the king. ‘It was all quite fair; we tried it twice over.’ In this way the Shifty Lad won the king’s daughter, and they were married the next day.  A few days later the bride and bridegroom were taking a walk together, and the path led down to the river, and over the river was a bridge.  ‘And what bridge may this be?’ asked the Shifty Lad; and the princess told him that this was the bridge of Dublin.  ‘Is it indeed?’ cried he. ‘Well, now, many is the time that my mother has said, when I played her a trick, that my end would be that I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34546"],["title","Additions to the List of the Birds of Louisiana (#1)"],["body"," and 17, 1930, and are now on deposit in the Chicago Academy of Sciences. Recently I borrowed these specimens for reëxamination with the following results. The three taken on November 17, 1930, are _mexicana_ and not _falcinellus_ as labeled and so reported by Oberholser. The single specimen taken on November 13 is, however, correctly identified as _falcinellus_. Alexander Wetmore kindly examined the material for me and confirmed my identifications. The occurrence of _falcinellus_ in Louisiana thus hinged on Holt's statement and one preserved specimen. However, on July 23, 1944, in the marshes on Grand Isle, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, I encountered a flock of 12 immature ibises that impressed me by their blackness in contrast to the color of glossy ibises with which I was familiar in Cameron Parish. Two specimens were collected and both proved to be _falcinellus_.  Holt's published observations cannot be positively refuted, for we cannot be sure that a colony of _falcinellus_ did not exist in Cameron Parish in 1932, nor that the portion of the rookery under his observation did not consist of a segregated population of that species. However, ten years of field observations by other ornithologists have failed to disclose the species which Holt considered a common nesting bird in an area where we now know that only the White-faced Glossy Ibis occurs. The fact that Holt specifically stated that he failed to find the white-faced bird at any time in his stay in Cameron Parish is difficult to explain, but this much is certain--the present known status of _falcinellus_ in Louisiana is that of only a rare and casual visitor.   #Branta canadensis hutchinsii# (Richardson), Hutchins Goose  Oberholser (_op. cit._, 89) cited only one Louisiana record for this goose. The bird in question was shot but apparently not preserved. Consequently, the status of the race on the Louisiana list was subject to question. Recently, however, two typical specimens of _hutchinsii_ were obtained in the state, one by Edouard Morgan, near Lake Catherine, on November 7, 1942, and the other by Herman Deutsch, four miles above the mouth of the Mermentau River, on November 2, 1944. The former is displayed in the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Exhibit in the Louisiana State Museum, and the latter is now in the Louisiana State University Museum of Zoölogy.   #Oxyura dominica# (Linnaeus), Masked Duck  A mounted specimen of this species was found by T. D. Burleigh and myself in a sporting goods store in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Through the kindness of Mr. Jack Gunn, owner, it was donated to the Louisiana State University Museum Collection. The bird was shot approximately 25 miles southeast of Lake Charles at Sweet Lake, Cameron Parish, on December 23, 1933, by R. T. Newton. This is the first recorded occurrence of the species in Louisiana, as well as one of the very few instances of its appearance anywhere in the United States.   #Buteo lineatus texanus# Bishop, Texas Red-shouldered Hawk  Although this race has been recorded previously only from Texas and northeastern Mexico, it appears to be of regular occurrence in southern Louisiana in the fall and winter. The six specimens in the Louisiana State University Collection, identified by Herbert Friedmann as _texanus_, are as follows: Westover, November 25, 1937; Baton Rouge, October 20, 1936, November 1, 1938, and September 3, 1940; University, November 14, 1942; Hoo-shoo-too, October 12, 1941 (Lowery, Tiebout, and Wallace). Another specimen, taken at Baton Rouge on September 17, 1940 (Ray), was acquired by Louis B. Bishop, who identified it as _texanus_.   #Numenius americanus americanus# Bechstein, Long-billed Curlew  #Numenius americanus parvus# Bishop, Northern Long-billed Curlew  Thirteen specimens of this species in the Louisiana State University Museum have been identified subspecifically (in part by J. Van Tyne) as follows: _N. a. americanus_--4 [Female], Cameron, November 21 and 22, 1940, and December 5, 1942. _N. a. parvus_--4 [Male], 1 [Female], Cameron, November 21 and 23, 1940, and April 11 and October 31, 1942; 1 [Female], East Timbalier Island, August 18, 1940. Three are intermediate in size and therefore not identifiable with certainty. Contrary to published accounts, the Long-billed Curlew is a fairly common migrant in certain parts of southern Louisiana. About seventy-five were counted on the beach near Cameron on November 1, 1941, and twenty-five were noted at the same place on December 6, 1942. Almost invariably a few are present there during every month of the year.   #Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus# (Cassin), Western Snowy Plover  #Charadrius alexandrinus tenuirostris# (Lawrence), Cuban Snowy Plover  Oberholser (_op. cit._, 216-217) listed the Cuban Snowy Plover as a rare transient in Louisiana, and cited only four definite records based on three specimens. Our recent studies, however, have yielded twelve additional specimens and a number of sight records, all of which indicate that the species is a regular and sometimes common migrant in spring and fall. Eleven specimens in the series are identifiable with certainty as examples of _nivosus_ and therefore constitute an addition to the state list. They were taken at East Timbalier Island on November 15 and 16, 1940 (Burleigh, Lowery, and Ray), at Grand Isle on March 27, 1943 (Burleigh), and near Cameron on November 20 and 21, 1941, April 3 and October 17, 1942, and September 3, 1944 (Burdick, Howell, and Lowery). On April 29, 1945, Tucker saw twenty on the beach near Cameron, but he did not obtain a specimen. A single adult male in our series, taken on East Timbalier Island, on November 15, 1940 (Ray), is referable to _tenuirostris_.   #Charadrius hiaticula semipalmatus# Bonaparte, Semipalmated Plover  Oberholser (_op. cit._, 218) made special mention of the absence of definite winter records for this species, but, in recent years, it has been noted on numerous occasions in Louisiana in that season. For example, ten were seen at Cameron on December 13, 1940, and the same number was noted there on January 22 and 23, 1941 (Lowery, _et al._). A specimen was shot at Cameron on December 5, 1942 (Lowery).   #Charadrius wilsonia wilsonia# Ord, Wilson Plover  Oberholser's single winter record for this species (_op. cit._, 220) has now been supplemented by two others--fifteen birds seen and three collected at Cameron on January 22, 1941 (Burleigh, Wallace, and Ray); one taken at the same place on December 5, 1942 (Burdick).   #Pluvialis dominica dominica# (Müller), American Golden Plover  The presence of the Golden Plover on the northern Gulf coast in winter already has been reported by Burleigh (\"Bird Life of the Gulf Coast Region of Mississippi,\" Occas. Papers Mus. Zoöl. La. State Univ., 20, 1944: 367), but since there are no published instances of its occurrence in Louisiana at that season, the following four specimens are noteworthy: two collected near Creole by Lowery and Ray on November 21, 1940; two others shot at the same place by Burdick and Tucker on December 6, 1942; and one seen, but not taken, near Cameron on November 22, 1941 (Lowery, _et al._).   #Erolia bairdii# (Coues), Baird Sandpiper  Since there is only one previous definite record of the occurrence of this species in the state, the following records are significant. A male was obtained by Burdick at University, 3 miles south, on October 25, 1942. I saw three at the same place on October 29 and shot a male there on November 9. The only spring record is that of a bird seen by me at University, 1 mile south, on May 16, 1945.   #Steganopus tricolor# Vieillot, Wilson Phalarope  Apparently the first definite record of this species in the state is that of an adult female, in breeding plumage, shot by E. A. McIlhenny at Avery Island, Louisiana, on May 10, 1939, and later sent to the Louisiana State University Museum of Zoölogy. A second specimen, a male in winter plumage, was taken by Burdick 5 miles south of the University on September 12, 1943.   #Limosa fedoa# (Linnaeus), Marbled Godwit  This species was listed by Oberholser (_op. cit._, 271) as a very rare winter resident along the Gulf coast region of southern Louisiana and he cited only two records of occurrence in the state. The following additional records should clarify its present-day status. In 1940 two were seen on East Timbalier Island on August 19, eight on November 15, and seventy-five on both November 16 and 17. Three were seen near Cameron on November 21, 1941. In 1942, two were seen near Cameron on April 4, five on April 5, three on April 11, two on April 22, and one on April 23. Another was noted near Cameron on October 7, 1943 (Lowery, _et al._). A small series of specimens was taken from the birds mentioned above. In connection with this species, it may be of interest to note that the Hudsonian Godwit (_Limosa haemastica_) has not been observed in Louisiana by me or my associates.   #Geococcyx californianus# (Lesson), Road-runner  The Road-runner inhabits the northwestern part of the state where it has been reported for many years by local residents. However, since confirmation of its occurrence was lacking, previous publications on the birds of the state have not listed, it. The first definite record is that of a bird killed near Shreveport, on May 1, 1938, by an unspecified collector. Another was shot four miles north of Keatchie, De Soto Parish, on July 9, 1943, by Delmer B. Johnson, at that time field biologist with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Both specimens are in the Louisiana State University Museum. Johnson states that he has seen the species on a number of occasions, specific records being in April and May, 1943, twelve miles east of Mansfield, and two miles east of Logansport. Various reports of nests have been received, but as yet no completely satisfactory breeding record for the state has been obtained.   #Columbigallina passerina pallescens# (Baird), Mexican"]]]
