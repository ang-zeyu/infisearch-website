Every earthman who killed an earthman was depriving him personally, of a victim. He wrung his hands.  \"There'll be a thousand or so left, Calvin,\" Forential promised. \"You must practice very diligently to be able to cope with them.\"  Calvin sniffed and shook his head. \"I can kill that many in a minute. You stop the war, Forential, _please_.\"  \"Think of it this way,\" Forential said. \"The less work there is to do, the sooner you can return to your own planet.\"  \"There's no earthmen to kill on Lyria,\" Calvin insisted stubbornly. \"_Please_ stop the war.\"  \"I'll see what I can do.\" The alien smiled kindly. \"You have the proper spirit. You are all very good children. You hurry, now, and practice all you can.\"  I can see Lyria's star now, Walt thought. We'll be home in another year, then. How welcome that will be....  He had not broadcast the thought. And suddenly, as if on another channel, another frequency, he felt Calvin in his mind and his mind in Calvin's--an odd, unexpected blending of thoughts that seemingly had occurred unconsciously.  _Forential describes it so it is so pretty, our planet_, Calvin was thinking: _Green wartle rivers whack throw the ball at him, easy now.... God, I hate those earthmen._  \"I'll practice,\" Walt made Calvin say. He made Calvin hold the ball stationary. Then the contact between their minds was broken.  \"Who did that?\" Calvin demanded. \"I'll hit him and break all his bones!\"  Forential smiled sadly at Calvin and withdrew.  \"It's nearly time,\" a mutant rejoiced. \"God, I hate them, every one of them.\"  The mutants instinctively began forming their minds for the death radiation.  \"They'll issue the rods shortly,\" Walt said.  Hatred blazed on Calvin's face. He had already forgotten about the contact a moment before. \"I will kill them even without a rod.\"  \"The radiation isn't lethal unless we have something to focus it with, remember that.\"  \"With my hands!\" Calvin cried happily. \"I will kill them with my hands!\"  Sweat beaded John's face. \"There will be enough of killing.\"  _It will be great pleasure to hunt them down._  _They will kill some of us_, Walt thought back. And, to himself: I wish I could be afraid.  _Not me!_ Calvin thought joyously. It was uncertain when Calvin could telepath. _Not me!_  _They have powerful weapons, too. Atom bombs, they are called. It will not be easy to kill them all._ This thought came as a reminder from one of the aliens.  Calvin moved his powerful hands. \"I can kill them all by myself.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The smaller compartment, itself, was huge. To the left lay the hydroponics tanks, and to the right, the mutants' cubicles. In the center of the compartment was the games space where the mutants boxed and wrestled and exercised with weights. The walls of each cubicle were so designed as to produce the illusion of great distances. The mutants would be required to face vast open spaces, and their cubicles partially conditioned them for the experience. Huge as their world was, it was miniscular compared to the one that would confront them.  Calvin, sitting beside Walt in Walt's cubicle, was trying to express an abstract concept.  \"... Forential is afraid of earthmen,\" he said. He puckered his face in a frown. \"I have just thought of that.\"  \"Forential is afraid of everything,\" Walt said respectfully.  \"I remember once when I shoved him he was very afraid. I shouldn't have,\" Calvin said, \"... it must be wonderful to be afraid.\"  \"He is more advanced than we are.\"  \"We can kill earthmen, though,\" Calvin said. \"He's too afraid to; so we get to kill them for him.\"  \"You got it wrong; you always get things wrong. We are killing earthmen for ourselves.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" Calvin nodded. \"I forget.\"  \"Forential is a friend,\" Walt said. \"He helps the Lyrians from the goodness of his heart.\"  \"Earthmen are very bad.\"  \"That's right.\"  \"They are a great evil,\" Calvin said excitedly.  \"They must be killed.\"  \"Yes, yes, yes!\" Calvin agreed. \"I will kill them with my hands.\" He fell silent, thinking.  \"... there is a Lyrian on Earth,\" Walt said slowly \"I have been hearing her thoughts.\"  \"I can think to you,\" Calvin said proudly. \"Listen.\" He concentrated. Muscles in his jaws quivered, \"... not today,\" he said sadly. \"My brain ... sometimes ... you know? ... sometimes....\"  \"I am hearing thoughts from a Lyrian on Earth,\" Walt said in dull amazement. \"Do you understand?\"  \"No; no.\"  \"It's a female.\"  \"All the females are on Lyria.... This is a man's work. We are ... are going to fight for females, isn't that right?\"  \"I tell you,\" Walt said, \"she's down there. The first time, _I_ thought I was mistaken.\"  Calvin shook his head and flipped the ball toward an unseen mutant. \"I can do that good,\" he said. The ball whistled back at him through the cubicle wall--leaving the wall unmarked as the atoms of one passed through the atomic spaces of the other. Happily, Calvin stopped it in mid flight.  \"She's down there,\" Walt said. \"I'll have to tell Forential about her.\"  Calvin tapped his head and smiled. \"I think funny thoughts some times, too. You go see Forential. He can't help, but you go see him, Walt.\"  \"I wasn't sure until just before you came in,\" Walt said.  \"You go see him,\" Calvin said.  Walt stood up. \"I was thinking with her just a little while ago. I don't understand it.\"  \"I can think to you ... some times.\"  \"I'll be back,\" Walt said.         *       *       *       *       *  At the steel ladder leading up toward the alien section, Walt stopped and pressed the emergency-audience button. He waited for permission to ascend the ladder. Under no circumstance would he have ascended without it. The permissive light blinked.  He began to climb. At the ceiling hatch, he grunted and pressed against it with his shoulders. The hatch lifted away. He continued upward. Gravity lessened. His feet made soft, rustling noises.  He paused to rest at the first landing. He was in familiar territory. Fierut let the mutants from the smaller compartment help clean the machinery there every month or so. The air smelled of crisp ozone and hot oil.  Then as he rested, he saw movement behind one of the huge, softly purring machines. Although he could not know this, it was a female from the larger compartment. Muscles knotting, he waited.  He saw her again--the merest glint of flesh. She had not seen him. He half crouched.  It is impossible, he told himself. Only my compartment-mates and Forential and others of his race are on the ship.  Walt did not even think of trying for telepathic contact. Blind hatred overcame him. She's an earthling! he thought instinctively.  She has been left here for a test; that's it, he thought. Forential is testing me....  He crept cautiously toward her. Still she was unaware of him.  I will break her neck, so....  No, he thought suddenly.  Forential has brought her here for questioning. He would be angry if I harmed her. He does not intend it for a test after all.  He crouched undecided, trying to think. I better leave her, he thought.  He was motionless, watching. If I killed her, he thought, Forential might be angry.  He slipped silently toward the ladder.  Perhaps, he thought, Forential will give her to me to dispose of when he finishes with her.  He remembered seeing Forential dispose of several captured earthlings. It was a very satisfying thing to watch. Forential promised us some, Walt thought, but he never gave us any. But I guess I was wrong in thinking he was too cowardly to risk another trip to Earth for them....  Just as he reached the ladder, he whirled. The female had seen him. She had started toward him. His eyes sparkled in anticipation.  _She's a Lyrian!_ he thought in amazement.  _Damned earthmen_, she thought.  _No, I...._  For a long moment they were motionless. Then Walt, keeping a suspicious eye on her until he was above the second ceiling continued to climb.         *       *       *       *       *  In the alien compartment, the gravity was so low that Walt almost floated. He propelled himself toward Forential's cubicle.  \"Come in,\" Forential said, sensing him. Forential looked up when he entered.  \"I saw a female Lyrian in the machinery room!\" Walt blurted.  There was a moment of silence. Forential's face grew a shade paler. \"... did she see you?\"  _Of course_, Walt thought.  It was an effort for Forential to telepath in English. He preferred vocalizing. Staring at Walt with his faceted, unblinking eyes, he thought in his own language, a language earthlings were incapable of learning: **Lycan, you idiot! You told me the machinery room was clear! One of my charges has seen one of yours!**  **I have great regret,** Lycan answered. **I, I overlooked her.**  **We cannot risk the compartments discovering each other.** Forential thought angrily.  \"This is not all,\" Walt said. _There is one on Earth!_  Forential's tentacles stiffened. _What?_ It was almost involuntary: unbelieving: terrified.  \"There _is_ one on Earth. A female.\"  **I have regretfully disposed of the one he saw,** Lycan telepathed. **Have you disposed of the one who saw her?**  **_Send out a call for the Council!_** Forential broadcast hysterically. **One more set of parents than we were aware of was exposed to our field! _There is an unindoctrinated mutant on Earth!_**  \"Are you sure?\" Forential demanded of Walt.  \"What about the one I saw a minute ago?\" Walt persisted.  \"... she came on the last ship from Lyria,\" Forential lied curtly.  \"Oh? I would like to talk to her. We all would. Can we, Forential?\"  The alien was outwardly impassive. \"We'll see. Never mind her right now. Tell me about this one on Earth.\"  \"I heard her thoughts.\"  Forential lay his tentacles on his desk. They scrabbled nervously. \"How long have you known?\" How did she manage to break through our telepathic shielding? he wondered. He made an inward snarl of surprise ... powerful mind!...

Burl was thoroughly familiar with the techniques of tracking down the ancient records of mankind. He got along well with natives and primitive people; he knew the arts of wilderness survival; he knew the delicate techniques of sifting sand and dirt to turn up those priceless bits of pottery and chipped stone that could supply pages of the forgotten epics of human history.  However, later in the day it seemed as if their particular camp had petered out. There were ruins there--a broken-down wall, a dry well and a bit of eroded bas-relief lying on its side. Burl's father looked at him thoughtfully. The tall, sandy-haired youth was sitting astraddle a pile of dust, methodically sifting it through a wide-mesh strainer. A large pile of sifted sand gave evidence of the length of his efforts, and one broken bit of clay was the only result he had obtained.  Two of the Indian guides sat patiently in the shade, watching them. One was digging slowly, turning up more dirt to be sifted.  \"I think we've had enough here,\" said the elder Denning. \"Burl, you can knock off. Tomorrow we'll pull up stakes and see what is in the next valley. We'll try to follow that old Inca road over the mountains. I don't believe anyone has ever penetrated there--and the airplane surveys indicated some evidence of human dwellings.\"  Burl nodded, and set the sifter down. He'd learned to curb his natural energies for the exacting tasks required of serious scientific research. \"Okay,\" he said, \"I was hoping you'd move on soon, Dad. This looked like a washout from the first. I'd say this place was sacked and ruined even before the Incas fell.\"  The older man nodded. \"I suppose so. Well, let's wash up and see what's for supper.\"  They went down to the icy mountain stream to wash the dirt from their hands. \"It's been a nice day,\" Burl commented. \"In spite of the Sun being out steadily, it wasn't hot at all. Cooler than yesterday.\"  Mark Denning looked up at the sky and the Sun lowering toward the horizon. \"There must have been some volcanic dust in the heavens,\" he said. \"The Sun's been a bit dimmed, have you noticed?\"  Burl squinted his eyes against the glare. \"Wasn't any eruption around here. Maybe in Ecuador?\"  His father shrugged. \"Could have been thousands of miles away,\" was his slow reply. \"Volcanic dust travels around the world, just as radioactive dust permeated the atmosphere from atomic testings. They say that the dust from the great Krakatoa explosion remained in the atmosphere for three years before the last of it settled.\"  When they had finished supper and the Sun was casting its last red rays over the rapidly purpling landscape, Burl got out the expedition radio, set up its antenna, plugged in its compact atomic battery, and tried to get the news from Lima. All he got was static.  He fiddled with the dials for a long time, twisting the antenna, ranging the wavelengths, but there was static everywhere. \"Strange,\" he said to his father, \"something's disturbed reception completely.\"  Pedro Gonzales, their official Peruvian guide, leaned over. \"Could be the battery she is broken, eh?\"  Burl shook his head. \"Not this battery,\" he said. \"It's a brand-new one, a real keen development. And I already checked the wiring. It's some sort of disturbance that's blocking reception. Maybe we're in a dead zone or something.\"  \"Wasn't dead yesterday,\" said his father. \"Maybe that eruption was radioactive.\"  Burl looked up sharply. \"I'll check the Geiger counters, Dad. Something's blocking reception, something strong and powerful to interfere with this set.\" But when he returned, he had to admit he had found nothing.  When the Sun went down, they retired, for the temperature drops swiftly in the high, thin air of the Andes.  In the rest of the world people watched their color-vision shows without interruption. Reception was good with the Moon base, the space platforms had no difficulty making reports, and the radio news beamed out as usual. In Lima, there was a little static, and direct transmission with Brazil seemed partially disrupted, but that was all.  In the following five days, the Denning expedition had managed the difficult climb over the next range of mountains and had come down in the high plateau valley between. In this same period, the world began to realize that the dimness of the sky was not a temporary phenomenon.         *       *       *       *       *  Weather stations noted that the past few days had all been several degrees under the average. Reports had come in that farmers were querying the unusual drop in the temperatures at night. And astronomers, measuring the surface heat of the Sun, came up with strange discrepancies from previous data.  One astronomer communicated with another, and a general exchange of advice began. In a short while, a communication was laid on the desk of the President of the United States, who scanned it and had it immediately transmitted to the Secretary General of the United Nations. The Secretary General circulated the report among the scientific bureaus of all member nations, and this led in turn to a meeting of the Security Council. This meeting was held in quiet, without benefit of newspaper reporters or audience.  There was no longer any doubt. The radiation of the Sun reaching the face of the Earth had decreased. The facts were indisputable. Where a day should have registered, in some places, at least 90° in the Sun, a reading of only 84° was noted. Measurements definitely showed that the face of the Sun visible to man on Earth had dimmed by just that margin.  This might not prove serious at first, but as the scientists called in by the Security Council pointed out, it promised terrible things as the year went on. A difference of five or ten degrees all over the Earth could mean the ruin of certain crops, it could mean an increase in snowfall and frost that could very rapidly destroy the economies and habitability of many places on the Earth's teeming surface.  \"But what,\" asked the Chairman of the Council, \"is causing this decrease in solar energy?\"  This the astronomers could not answer. But they pointed to one factor. The reports from the U.S. Moon Base did not agree with the observations from Earth. Moon instruments claimed no decrease whatsoever in the amount of sunlight reaching the arid, airless surface of the Earth's only satellite.  The cause was somewhere on Earth. And the Security Council requested the careful scanning of the Earth from space platforms and the Moon to determine the center of the trouble.         *       *       *       *       *  Burl Denning had not found the next valley of much interest, either. Evidence of an Inca road over the mountain had petered out. There were signs there had been human dwellings, but they were not Inca--just reminders of the onetime passage of an unknown band of primitives who had grazed their sheep, built temporary tents, and pulled up stakes perhaps a hundred years before.  So again at night, Burl, his father, and Gonzales took counsel. They were debating which way to proceed next; Mark Denning reasoning that they should go further inland, following tales natives had told; Gonzales urging that they retrack their path and proceed northward toward the regions where Inca ruins abounded.  For the past week Burl had not been able to get radio reception. The static had increased as they had gone eastward over the mountain, but not a word of news or any human voice came through. The Moon was rising on the horizon as Burl sat playing with the antenna. Finally he gave up and switched it off.  The discussion had died away and the three men were quiet. The Indian guides had retired to their own campfire, and one of them had taken out his pipes and was blowing a soft, plaintive tune.  Burl stared at the full Moon in silence, wondering if he would ever have a chance to walk its surface, or if his own future was to lie in probing mankind's past rather than surveying the grounds of his future. As he watched, he thought he saw a faint light among the brightening stars where none had been before.  He squinted, and, sure enough, he saw that one tiny white light was swinging more and more toward the center of the sky. He pointed it out to his father and Gonzales. \"Too fast to be a celestial object,\" he said. \"Is it one of the space platforms or a sputnik?\"  The two men gazed at it in curiosity. Suddenly it seemed to grow brighter and sharper and to twist toward them in its path.  \"Look!\" gasped Burl, but the others were already on their feet.  The light plunged down. There was a sudden outburst of yellow flame that caused the three to duck instinctively, and brought the Indians to their feet with yells. The glare brightened until they could see that something was just above them. The fire vanished as swiftly as it came, but a white spot of light remained.  \"It's a parachute!\" Burl shouted. \"It's a rocket or something, braking to a stop above us, and coming down by parachute!\"  In the pale light of the full Moon they saw that something metallic and glistening hung from the white mushroom of a parachute. There was a clanging sound as it hit the rocky earth with a soft, sighing whoosh. The cloth of the parachute settled.  They ran across the dry stone of the valley floor, but Burl's long, athletic legs outdistanced the others. He reached it first.  It was a cylinder of metal, about three feet long and a foot in diameter.  \"It's the nose of a message missile--dropped from a guided missile,\" Burl announced. \"And--look!\" He dramatically pointed the beam of his flashlight upon its side.  There, written in black, heat-resistant paint, were the words: _To the Denning Andes Expedition, from U.S. Air Force Base, California Region. By Guided Missile Post by Moon Base control, Ptolomaeus Crater. Official. Open Without Delay._     Chapter 2. _The Valley of Stolen Sunlight_   For a moment all three were silent "]]]
