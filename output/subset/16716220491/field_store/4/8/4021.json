But, good grief, I've certainly seen a lot of New York today!\"  \"Well, don't ever take a subway to Brooklyn!\" Dawson advised. \"You wouldn't be back for a week. What shall we do now? Where'll we go, I mean. Want to take a subway ride?\"  \"Deliver me!\" Freddy Farmer groaned. \"Definitely, no! Personally, I'm hungry. Let's go find a nice restaurant and fuel up, what?\"  \"Okay,\" Dawson sighed. \"I suppose you've got to have a nine-course snack to keep you from fainting until supper. Okay. But let's go to the dining room in the Biltmore Hotel next door. If your friend in gray follows you there, we'll know he's up to something. Ten to one, though, you've been having a pipe dream.\"  \"Perhaps,\" Freddy Farmer admitted as he dropped into step with Dawson. \"But that's definitely the same chap I've been seeing all day long. I wonder why the blighter _is_ following me around? No, no, my little man! Just keep your opinion to yourself. I--I say, wait a minute, Dave!\"  Freddy Farmer left Dawson's side and went over to two Yank soldiers who were obviously going no place, but just taking in the sights. They saluted him as he came up and stopped in front of them.  \"I say, you two on leave, what?\" he asked with a grin.  \"Yes, sir,\" they replied together, and gave him a funny look.  \"Will you be in town come next Wednesday?\" Freddy asked again.  \"Yes, sir,\" they replied in the same breath.  \"Good!\" Freddy beamed, and held out the hockey tickets. \"Use these, if you like. And half a minute! Here, buy yourselves some little thing, what? And good luck.\"  Freddy Farmer added two one-dollar bills to the hockey tickets and walked away. The two soldiers gaped down at the two tickets and the two dollars.  \"What's the matter with that guy; is he touched?\" one of them mumbled. \"And did you hear him, Fuzzy? He didn't even speak English!\"  \"Who cares?\" Fuzzy asked as he came out of his trance. \"Two four-buck-forty hockey tickets, and two bucks in cash! Who cares if the guy is touched? He's okay by me!\"  \"Well, well!\" Dawson chuckled when Freddy joined him. \"Darned if the kid didn't at that! And even let go of two bucks.\"  \"All I had on me,\" Freddy said with a smile. \"So that makes you the one to pay for our meal, see?\"  \"Oh, yeah?\" Dawson jeered. \"Well, don't look right now, but standing in your shoes is a guy who's heading for a lot of dish washing in the Biltmore kitchen!\"     CHAPTER TWO  _Just in Case_   \"Well?\" Freddy Farmer demanded as he leaned across the dining table toward Dawson. \"Did I have a pipe dream, or not? Did you see who just came in and sat down?\"  \"Yeah,\" Dawson grunted, and buttered a roll. \"Your pal in gray. I wonder what's the big idea?\"  \"So do I!\" Freddy echoed instantly. \"And I've half a mind to go over right now and ask him. The beggar is beginning to give me the creeps. He doesn't look foreign, though.\"  \"Hey, come out of your spin, pal!\" Dawson chuckled. \"What do you think this is, Gestapo stuff?\"  Freddy Farmer looked at Dawson and smiled slowly.  \"I wouldn't know, old thing,\" he said. \"You see, this isn't England, so I wouldn't know for sure _what_ kind of funny business was afoot.\"  \"Ouch!\" Dawson yipped softly, and flung up an arm in front of his face. \"Right in the eye, that time. You're improving each day with your snappy come-back, my young friend. Keep it up, and you'll be the life of the party some day. Well, I guess that's all the fodder I want right now. How's for a stroll around in the beautiful January snow, huh? But it's probably slush by now, and--Hey! I almost forgot! You think I'm paying for your meal, don't you? Well--\"  \"Of course not!\" Freddy Farmer cut in quickly. \"And just to show my heart's in the right place, I'll even pay for both of us.\"  \"I wonder if there's a doctor in the house?\" Dawson murmured, and stared hard at the English youth. \"Sure you feel all right, Freddy?\"  \"Never felt better,\" the other replied. \"Wait just a moment, will you, old thing? I'll be right back.\"  Before Dawson could ask questions, Freddy got up from his chair and walked quickly across the dining room and down the broad flight of carpeted steps to the lobby. Dawson blinked, then took a sip of water, and glanced over at the man in gray. The mysterious stranger was looking toward the lobby, and was in the act of pushing himself up out of his chair. He seemed to change his mind, however. He shot a quick look over Dawson's way, then settled back in his chair and went to work on a piece of pie the waiter had placed in front of him.  \"That bird sure is plenty interested in Freddy,\" Dawson muttered to himself, and frowned. \"I wonder what the heck's cooking around here, anyway?\"  He played with that thought for two or three minutes, but was unable to get any place. And then as he happened to glance toward the dining-room lobby entrance, he saw Freddy Farmer standing there and beckoning to him urgently. Dawson raised questioning eyebrows, took a look toward the man in gray, got up from his chair, and started to leave the table. He had taken but two steps when the waiter appeared at his elbow.  \"The check, Captain,\" the waiter said politely.  \"Oh, yeah,\" Dawson murmured absently, and glanced at the total. He pulled some money from his pocket and gave it to the waiter. \"There you are,\" he murmured again, and hurried over to the lobby entrance to the dining room where Freddy was waiting.  The English-born air ace greeted him with a grin like a Cheshire cat.  \"And let that be a lesson to you, my good fellow,\" Freddy said with an emphatic nod of his head.  \"Says which?\" Dawson grunted, and gave him a blank look.  Freddy Farmer patted his stomach and licked his lips.  \"A delicious meal, quite!\" he breathed. \"I hope you gave the waiter a decent tip. But, knowing you, I doubt it.\"  Dawson started violently, and his jaw dropped.  \"Well, you little I-don't-know-what!\" he eventually exploded. \"Stuck me for the meal, didn't you? I knew darn well you must have had something in mind when you gave your last two bucks to those soldiers. You play the big-hearted big shot to them, and _I_ get stuck for your two bucks' worth of food!\"  \"Oh, I wouldn't say that,\" Freddy Farmer chuckled. \"Just say it's your share in the lease-lend agreement between America and England. I'll pay you back some day, too.\"  \"Yeah!\" Dawson sneered. \"When I'm a hundred and six and have lost all my teeth. When I can eat only soup instead of a thick steak like I just bought for you. But you just wait, my little bowlegged pet! I'll--Oh-oh! The man in gray, eh?\" Dawson added the last because of the flinty look that had suddenly leaped into Farmer's eyes.  \"Quite!\" Freddy murmured. \"And I'm jolly well sick of this hide-and-seek business. I'm going to find out what the blighter's up to. I detest shadows, excepting my own.\"  With a grim nod Freddy Farmer stepped past Dawson and walked over toward the man in gray who was just leaving the dining room. Dawson impulsively swung around and followed him. The man in gray acted as though he did not see Freddy, but the English youth stopped in front of him, barring his way.  \"Have you been wishing to speak to me, sir?\" Freddy asked quietly. \"Is that why you've been following me all over town all day?\"  The man in gray looked blank for a moment. Then he shrugged and gave Freddy a friendly smile.  \"It _has_ been rather obvious, hasn't it, Captain Farmer?\" he said as both Freddy and Dawson stared at him, dumbfounded. \"But you went to a lot of places where I couldn't help but show myself. I guess you've had enough experience to guess when you're being trailed. The name is Carter, Captain.\"  As the man in gray introduced himself, he slipped something out of his pocket and held it cupped in his hand so both youths could see it. They took a good look at the gold F.B.I. badge and quickly raised their eyes to the man's face.  \"The F.B.I. no less!\" Dawson breathed. \"What's up? Is Farmer wanted by the F.B.I.--I hope?\"  The man chuckled and shook his head.  \"No,\" he said. \"Neither of you are, in fact. The two of us just had orders to keep an eye on you both.\"  \"'_Two_ of us'?\" Dave echoed sharply. \"You mean--\" He let the rest go as the F.B.I. agent nodded.  \"That's right, Captain Dawson,\" he said quietly, and made a faint gesture toward the other side of the lobby. \"My partner has been looking after you, while I tried to keep up with Captain Farmer here. If Captain Farmer hadn't returned to the dining room, I'd have taken on the job of sticking with you, and my partner would have tackled Captain Farmer. Frankly, I would have enjoyed the change. But now--\"  The F.B.I. agent grinned and shrugged.  \"But now that the cat's out of the bag,\" he said, \"suppose we stop playing cops and robbers and make it a foursome? My partner got tickets right behind your seats for the hockey game tonight. We're also staying at your hotel. Or would you rather be alone? Now don't be afraid that you'll hurt my feelings. I'll understand. After all, a couple of fellows on leave have their rights, you know.\"  \"Yeah, sure, of course,\" Dawson mumbled absently, not quite sure if he was in the middle of a dream or not. \"Sure, sure it's okay by Freddy and me. But--but look, sir. I mean, what's all the big idea? Why should the F.B.I. want to follow us around? I don't get it.\"  \"To be perfectly frank, neither do I,\" Agent Carter made the amazing reply. \"All I know is that two days ago we were given orders to come up from Washington, register at your hotel, and keep an eye on you two.\"  \"But for what?\" Freddy Farmer asked. \"You mean you were to guard us from harm, or some such silly rot?\"  \"I wouldn't exactly call it silly rot, Captain,\" the F.B.I. man said gravely. \"After all, you two are marked men, in a way. I mean by that, you've been thorns in the side of Axis Intelligence more than once since this Second World War started. Not that personal revenge by enemy agents in this country is to be expected."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32331"],["title","Dave Dawson at Casablanca (#2)"],["body","t, on the other hand, there's no sense in regarding it as impossible.\"  \"Well, I'll be darned!\" Dawson gulped. \"But that's just plain screwy. Why, I can name several dozen famous soldiers in this war that the Axis would love to get a million times more than they'd want to get us. Do you mean that everybody who's got in a few pokes at the Axis has an F.B.I. escort when he goes on leave?\"  \"Hardly,\" Agent Carter said with a smile. \"Let's say that you two happen to be special cases. Why, you can search me. Lots of times we're given orders, and we have no idea what's behind them. Let's go over and meet my partner. Or is my suggestion of a moment ago out?\"  \"No,\" Dawson replied. \"I told you it was okay by us. Besides, maybe your partner can tell us things.\"  \"If he can, he won't,\" Agent Carter said. \"You can count on that, I'm afraid. His name is Hickson, and it so happens that he's a rabid Ranger fan. He comes from this town. Let's go over.\"  Still not quite sure that he wasn't being made the goat of some crazy gag, Dawson walked with Agent Carter and Freddy Farmer across the lobby to where a thin, almost sickly-looking man of uncertain years was seated in a chair reading a newspaper. He put down his paper and smiled as the trio approached. It was then Dawson had a vague feeling he had seen that thin face somewhere quite recently. Then as Agent Carter made the introductions, it came to Dawson. Agent Hickson had been the man next in line behind him when he had bought tickets for the hockey game. As he shook hands and mumbled some pleasantry, Dave realized he had seen that thin face other places, too, during the day.  \"Did I give you as much trouble, Agent Hickson,\" he asked, \"as Farmer seems to have given Agent Carter?\"  \"No, Captain,\" the other replied with a twinkle in his eye. \"And don't ever go in for crime. You'd be a cinch.\"  \"With those big flat feet, it would be obvious!\" Freddy Farmer chuckled, as the red climbed into Dawson's face.  \"Okay, okay!\" Dave growled and grinned at the same time. \"I'm not like you, with things on your conscience! So naturally I wouldn't even give it a thought that anybody was following me. But look, Agent Hickson, can you add anything to what Agent Carter has told us? Which was absolutely nothing.\"  \"I'm afraid I can't, Captain.\" Hickson smiled, and shook his head. \"Carter and I are just a couple of slaves who do what we're told and ask no questions.\"  \"But you do know _something_, only you won't tell us, what?\" Freddy Farmer pressed the issue.  The F.B.I. man shook his head again and made a little cross mark over his heart.  \"I honestly don't know a thing,\" he said, \"except that I like this particular job. I'm from New York, you know. And I'm a hockey fan, in case Carter hasn't told you.\"  \"He has,\" Dawson grinned, and glanced at his wrist watch. \"And I sort of go for the game, myself. It's hours, though, before game time. Anybody have any suggestions what to do until then? Listen, Freddy! Eating is strictly out, at least for a couple of hours!\"  \"You don't have to shout, old thing; I hear you,\" the English youth replied. \"Yes, I have a suggestion. I've been meaning to see that United Nations display they have at Radio City. What say we go back to the hotel and clean up a bit? These blasted American shoes I bought yesterday are killing me.\"  Dawson started to shake his head, but instantly checked the movement. A gleam leaped into his eyes.  \"Fair enough,\" he said. \"I could do with a clean shirt myself. Come on. We'll take a cab.\"  During the cab ride across town to the hotel, they talked of this and that and nothing in particular. When the cab pulled up in front of the hotel, Dawson opened the door, let the two F.B.I. men get out ahead of him, and got out quickly himself, leaving Freddy Farmer the last to alight. Without so much as a look over his shoulder, Dawson linked arms with the two F.B.I. men and hurried them up the steps into the hotel.  \"Dave!\" he heard Freddy Farmer call out. \"Oh, I say, _Dave_!\"  The two F.B.I. men wanted to stop, but Dawson practically pushed them through the doors.  \"It's okay,\" he chuckled. \"Just his turn to be left holding the bag. He'll be right in. You'll see.\"  That was exactly the case. A moment later Freddy came hurrying inside, flush-faced, with a very hard-eyed taxicab driver right at his heels.  \"I say, Dave!\" the English youth panted. \"You know I haven't a bean on me. Let me have--\"  \"We're all broke!\" Dawson said coldly. \"You were last out, anyway. Go over to the desk, borrow the fare, and have it put on your bill. I'll see if there's any mail for us. Meet you upstairs in our room.\"  Freddy Farmer glared and pursed his lips as though he were striving to hold back the blistering words that rose in his throat.  The cab driver looked at him and scowled darkly. \"How's about it, General?\" he growled. \"I can't keep my hack out front all afternoon!\"  \"Oh yes, quite,\" Freddy said. \"Come along!\"  After giving a look that should have raised third-degree burns on the Yank pilot's face, Freddy went over to the lobby desk and spoke to the clerk. Bursting with inner laughter, Dawson watched Freddy's face grow redder and redder as the desk clerk gave him the fishy eye. Then the clerk went into the manager's office. He came right out, though, yanked open a desk drawer, and handed a bill to Freddy.  \"Now I have got to watch _my_ step, and how!\" Dawson chuckled, and walked over to the mail window.  There was something in the box. It was a telegram addressed to them both. Dave ripped it open and was reading the message just as Freddy Farmer came over. The wire read:       \"Take seven P.M. plane for Washington La Guardia Airport. Report my      office War Department on arrival.       COLONEL WELSH\"  \"And so what?\" Dave asked, looking at Freddy Farmer.  \"So leave it over, I fancy,\" the English youth murmured with a frown. \"I wonder what now?\"  \"You do the guessing; I'm stumped,\" Dawson said, glancing up quickly as Agents Carter and Hickson came over.  There was a telegram in Agent Carter's hand. Agent Hickson looked as though he had just lost his last friend.  \"So we all take an airplane ride instead, eh?\" Agent Carter said, and nodded at the wire in Dawson's hand.  \"You too?\" Dave questioned.  \"Right,\" Agent Carter replied. \"There are four reservations waiting for us at La Guardia.\"  \"Wouldn't you know!\" Agent Hickson groaned and shook his head sadly. \"Wouldn't you know I was nuts to think I could mix pleasure with business!\"     CHAPTER THREE  _Silent Lips_   \"Well, I guess this is the parting of the ways, Captain,\" Agent Carter of the F.B.I. said as the taxicab rolled to a stop on front of a War Department Building in Washington. \"Hickson and I will keep the cab for the ride over to the Bureau. Sorry we all missed an evening in New York together, but there'll come another day, I hope. Best of luck, you two. It's been nice knowing you.\"  \"Same thing, the other way around, sir,\" Dawson said as he shook hands and climbed out of the cab. \"And thanks for the protection--or whatever it was supposed to be.\"  Agent Carter laughed and raised a protesting hand.  \"Now let's not go into that again!\" he said. \"The answer is still that I don't know. Maybe Colonel Welsh will tell you. We can't, because we simply don't know. What's the matter, Captain Farmer?\"  Freddy was just straightening up after sticking his head back in through the cab door opening. He shrugged and grinned.  \"Just looking to see if you had your fingers crossed, sir, while you said that,\" he replied. \"But I see you didn't, and so that's that. Well, cheerio, and good hunting, and all that sort of thing. Sorry I didn't speak to you sooner.\"  \"That's the kind of tough break we get in our kind of job,\" Agent Carter said, and made a flip wave with his hand. \"So long, until we meet again.\"  \"And let's hope that'll be soon!\" Dawson called out as the cab rolled away.  The two air aces stood on the curb until the taxi turned the corner toward Pennsylvania Avenue and was lost to view. Then they impulsively turned and looked at each other.  \"Swell fellows, those two,\" Dawson said. \"Wish we could have had more time together. I've always wanted to ask a real honest-to-goodness F.B.I. man a few questions.\"  \"Then those two will never know how lucky they are,\" Freddy Farmer came right back. \"But speaking of questions--\"  \"Check, and double-check!\" Dawson echoed, and started across the sidewalk to the main entrance of the War Department Building. \"The sooner we ask them, the sooner we _may_ get an idea as to what the heck is going on.\"  The door guard stopped them and requested identification papers. They complied by producing their leave papers and the wire from Colonel Welsh. The guard referred to a book on his table desk, and nodded.  \"Third floor, Captain,\" he said, and gave them each a building pass that had to be turned in when they left. \"Room Three Twenty-Nine.\"  The two youths nodded, returned the guard's salute, and headed for the stairway. The door of Room 329 was just like all the other doors on that floor except that it had \"Colonel Welsh, Private\" painted on the glass. Dawson rapped his knuckles on the glass, and immediately received the summons to enter. Colonel Welsh, Chief of U. S. Armed Forces Intelligence, was seated behind a huge desk that seemed to take up most of the office. He was practically hidden behind a mass of papers, bound reports, and such, piled up all over the desk top.  He glanced up, smiled, pushed back his chair, and rose to come around the end of the desk.  \"Welcome to Washington again, you two,\" he said, and shook hands. \"A nice flight down?\"  \"Fine, sir,\" Dawson replied. \"We had a couple of swell air companions, too. You in charge of the F.B.I. now, Colonel?\"  \"F.B.I.? Me?\" Colonel Welsh echoed. \"Hardly! Not as long as J. Edgar Hoover continues to run it so perfectly. But what do you mean?\"  Dawson stared hard at the senior officer, and then gave a little sigh.  \"Oh, so it's"]]]
