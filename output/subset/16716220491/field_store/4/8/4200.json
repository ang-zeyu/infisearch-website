The defeat was caused solely by the lack of the intended element of surprise. Whether or not the enemy had possession of our plans, and if they had possession, how they obtained it, is something we shall never know.    [Illustration: _The Baccarat Sector, Showing St. Maurice and the     Grand Bois_]  A telegram was received by the Divisional Commander from General Headquarters to the effect that the entire action had been investigated and found creditable.  The casualties suffered from the raid, together with those resulting from the gas attack of June 24th, so depleted the Company as to make an immediate relief imperative and that same night Company L took over our sector.  A subsequent reorganization of the entire regiment distributed the men of the various companies so that all would have an equal strength. Our numbers were so few that we lost none of our men in this process but instead received increases not only from many of the other companies, but also from the 76th New England Division.  As tribute to those men whom we had lost, a Company B mass was held at the Catholic Church in Vacqueville at which Chaplain Father Walsh of our battalion officiated. The entire strength of the Company was present.  Another rest and another turn up front, after which the entire division was relieved by the 37th Ohio and Kentucky Division. Once again we crossed the Vosges, halting for three days at Seranville. Leaving there, we bivouaced for a night in the Forêt de Charmes and entrained at Charmes next morning, August 7th, at dawn.   From the Vesle to the Aisne--August 10th to September 15th    [Illustration: _The Advance from the Vesle to the Aisne_]  Two days later, August 10th, we took transport on an immense train of motor trucks--\"lorries\" we called them, after the English. They were driven by Indo-Chinese serving under the French. After nine cramped but interesting hours--we passed thru Chateau-Thierry--our trip ended at Fere en Tardenois. For three days we camped in a small wood and then we moved to a position supporting the attack on Fismes. We were stationed in the Bois de la Pissotti, adjoining the Forêt de Nesle. While there we were engaged in digging a series of reserve trenches near Mont-sur-Courville.  On August 28th the battalion moved around Chéry-Chartreuve to a position east of Le Prés Farm. September 1st we again shifted, this time crossing the Vesle and relieving the Third Battalion, just east of Bazoches. Here we repulsed a raiding party, inflicting heavy losses upon the enemy. We were then moved to a ravine, which gave us the opportunity of taking a two-day rest.  Our next move brought us to face with the enemy just south of Merval, where we took a position in an exposed field, our only protection being the individual \"funk holes\" which had been deserted by the retreating German troops.  After three days of little water and practically no food, at 5:30 on the afternoon of September 8th--still brilliant daylight--we crawled from our funk holes and, each squad in single file in formation known as \"squad columns\", we advanced against German artillery in an effort to straighten the line. As we reached the outskirts of Merval we were subjected to an intense barrage of H. E.'s, suffering the loss of four men killed and five injured.    [Illustration: _Our Path Thru the Argonne_]  No gain was made by this sortie and we drew back to our funk-hole position awaiting further developments.  Early on the morning of September 14th, supported by a barrage laid down by combined American, French, and Italian artillery, we attacked the enemy position that lay on the far side of the Ravine Merval.  The advance was made down the side of the valley in the face of a withering fire of enemy machine guns. Tho suffering heavy casualties, our progress was unchecked and we swarmed up the opposite slope with undiminished vigor. So rapid were our gains that we had to pause to allow our flanks to catch up. Our Third Platoon was so far ahead of the line of advance as to be mistaken by the commander of the cooperating French forces for a body of the enemy and it required considerable persuasion to correct his misconception. The day's end saw the German horde driven across the Aisne, and we were well beyond our original objective. But we had advanced true to form. Commenting on a previous attack made by another American unit, a French officer had remarked: \"The Americans,--they are fools. Tell them to take one trench,--and they take _three_!\"  We had been operating on the line of the Vesle with several divisions but the 77th was the only American division to drive its way to the Aisne.  Our gains were paid for with numerous casualties and when we received our relief it was thoroly welcome. It had been our longest consecutive stretch in the front line and we suffered not only from battle losses but we had also endured the utmost privation. Short rations, little water, exposed positions, and the constant necessity for watchfulness had undermined our strength to an unusual degree. We had been operating on the will to accomplish rather than on food and water.  An Italian unit relieved our Company and we withdrew to a reserve position in the Vesle Valley, east of Fismes. Here, on the night of September 16th, our division was relieved by an Italian division and we pulled out of the sector.  We looked forward to a period of rest, but it was not to be. Twenty kilometres of hiking brought us to the Arcis le Ponsart Forest, where we bivouaced for a day. Then into lorries for an all-night ride to Le Chatelier-sur-Marne, where our losses were replaced by a detachment from the 40th \"Sunshine\" Division. Two days of speculating as to our chances for a rest terminated when on the night of September 20th we were ordered to roll packs. We stepped off on a thirty-two kilometre hike at 1:00 A.M., _via_ St. Menehould and Florent, and seventeen hours later we dragged ourselves into the Forêt de Maisons Petites where we were quartered in barracks at the edge of the Argonne Forest.   The Argonne--September 26th to November 11th  The memorable and decisive drive known as the Argonne-Meuse Offensive started on September 26th. That day found us entrenched near the main road at Florent,--a position in reserve of the 1st Army Corps.  Actual operations were started that night, when the entire cannon of half a hundred divisions poured forth on the enemy its scorching fire. Next morning we moved to a position north of Florent, and three days later we moved thru the town of Le Four de Paris into those trenches north of La Harazee that had been deserted by the 122d German Regiment of the 2d Landwehr Division.   The \"Lost\" Battalion  October 2d we left the reserve and assumed a support position. On that day the forces in the line drove forward, but in the execution of the advance Companies E, H, I, K, L, and M of the 308th Infantry and Company K of the 307th Infantry found themselves trapped by the enemy on a hill north of the Bois de la Buironne. These units were the only ones to reach their objective but by thus advancing ahead of their flanks, they gave the enemy an opportunity to surround them. In this hazardous position they struggled as the \"Lost\" Battalion.    [Illustration: _U. S. Official Photo_     _Grim Business in the Argonne_     _A Unit of the 307th Infantry Waiting Orders to \"Mop Up\"_]  We went forward to their relief on October 4th, but were held back by the effective machine-gun fire of the enemy. Next day we again strove to extricate the besieged battalion, but again we failed. Certain enemy machine guns were so placed that their hail of death was impassable. They seemed an insurmountable obstacle in the path of the entire 307th Infantry. The men of Company B knew that the machine-gun positions of the enemy must be taken. There was nothing, at that moment, that counted more than the capture of these positions. So on October 6th we attacked, giving no thought to risk. We did what we thought would have been impossible before we knew that it had to be done. Persistently we attacked in the face of the enemy fire and as the German resistance gradually weakened, we took the heretofore impregnable positions. Seven of our men were that day cited for exceptional bravery.  On October 7th our division organized a concerted attack on the German lines. We realized the awful plight of the \"Lost\" Battalion and all day we fought against the enemy machine-gun nests. One by one they were silenced, and at 5:00 P.M. Company B, alone of all the division, succeeded in reaching and saving the \"Lost\" Battalion. The Germans were driven beyond the hill and once more the line was straightened out.   Grand-Pre  Another week and we had driven the Germans across the River Aire. We remained in a clump of woods until October 16th and then, not even waiting for our engineers to throw their bridges across the Aire, we waded the river and drove against Grand-Pre, which was the keystone of the enemy defense in the sector opposed by our division.    [Illustration: _U. S. Official Photo_     _The Ruined Prize--Grand-Pre, Captured October 16th, 1918_]  We were stubbornly opposed by the 253d German Infantry of the 76th Reserve Division. Again and again we assaulted the position and finally, after a running fight thru the streets, the town was ours and the American wedge was in a fair way to split the entire German defense.  We pulled out of the line on October 17th and withdrew 10 kilometres to a small forest near Apremont, being relieved by the 78th New Jersey Division. As usual, there was no rest, and on October 21st we moved to Fleville for a three-day stretch of trench digging. October 31st was spent in digging trenches in the Chattel Valley.  We resumed our activities at the front on November 2d, keeping in mind that half injunction, half promise, credited to General Pershing: \"Hell, Heaven, or Hoboken by Christmas!\" We gave little "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33934"],["title","She Knew He Was Coming (#1)"],["body","  *       *       *  In one of the rooms upstairs Mary sat before the dressing table with her back to the mirror, while June and Adele occupied the two overstuffed chairs. Night sounds drifted up from the yellow canal, and fresh flower scents whispered on the warm air. The diaphanous glass curtains rustled at the open window.  \"They're too expensive,\" Mary said. \"I'm sure Miss Bestris overcharges us for them.\"  \"Hush,\" said June, glancing around at the walls nervously. \"Hush, Mary.\" She smoothed at the delicate, plutolac lace fringe above her breasts. \"Imported material like this costs money. You can't get it for nothing, and we have to have the best.\"  \"I still think she charges too much.\"  Adele shrugged delicately and crossed shapely ankles. \"I think Miss Bestris must like you, or she wouldn't let you wear that dress again tonight. You ought to watch out that you don't get on the wrong side of her.\"  Mary laughed, her amethyst eyes sparkling. \"I won't care. Not after tonight.\"  \"You're not going to run away?\" June asked breathlessly. \"You wouldn't dare do that. You'd catch it, sure!\"  Mary shook her head. \"Not _run_ away.\"  Adele leaned forward and said huskily, \"You got enough money to redeem your contract?\"  Again Mary shook her head. \"No. It's nine hundred and ten _dordocs_. I have only ninety-three. But I'll have enough in the morning!\" She stood up and crossed to the window, looked out toward the spaceport.  \"How?\"  \"Tell us, Mary!\"  \"Tell you what?\" Anne asked, coming into the room. Languidly she drew the door closed behind her and rested against it. \"Tell you what?\" she insisted, narrowing milky eyes.  \"Mary says she can redeem her contract tomorrow.\"  Anne's wide mouth curled contemptuously. \"Nonsense!\"  \"It's not,\" said Mary without turning.  Anne glided sensuously across the room to the bed, her tight fitting plastic rippling with her tigerish muscles. She sat down.  \"He said he'd take me away, this trip,\" Mary continued. \"He'll sign off, and then we'll both get a ship and go to one of the frontier planets. Where it won't matter about--all this.\"  Anne laughed harshly. \"My God! You believe _that_?\"  \"We've both been saving our money,\" Mary said dreamily. \"He's in love with me. He said so.\"  \"Honey, that's what they all say.\"  Smiling, Mary turned from the window and leaned backward, stretching. \"You don't know him. He's different.\"  \"They're all the same,\" Anne said, her mouth twisting bitterly. \"They're just alike. Don't believe any of them.\"  And Mary said, \"With him, it's different. You'll see.\"  After a moment, Anne said, \"That Earthman? That what's-his-name?\" Mary nodded, and Anne brushed an imaginary something off her knee. \"An Earthman,\" Anne said. \"They're the worst of all.\"  \"You don't know him, or you wouldn't say that.\"  Adele looked away from Anne. \"You love him, don't you, Mary?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"You're a fool,\" Anne said. \"Listen to me. _Love_ a man? God! You'll see. After him, there'll be another and another, and--just like Rosy--you'll watch 'em leave you and laugh at you until finally you're hurt so bad you don't think you can stand being hurt any more, and then along comes another one, and it starts all over again, and then one night you take a razor blade and go to the sink and stick out your throat and....\"  \"No! No! You're wrong! He's not like the rest!\"  Anne leaned back carelessly, resting, propped on one hand. \"See. You know I'm right, already.\"  \"You're not!\"  Anne shrugged. \"Honey, tell me that tomorrow night.\"  \"I better go take my cake out,\" Mary said. She fled the room in a swirl of shimmering glastic.  Anne sneered, \"I don't see why Miss Bestris puts up with her the way she does.\"  \"You're jealous,\" June said quietly.  Anne did not answer.  \"Mary's decent,\" Adele said. \"Maybe that's why. She's from the sticks, and her parents still come to see her on visiting days, and there's something about her so--so innocent. Maybe that's why Miss Bestris likes her.\"  June said, \"I think she's better than the rest of us. I think Miss Bestris feels sorry for her in a way.\"  \"Don't make me laugh,\" Anne said, facing June. \"The only one that'll ever feel sorry for her is herself!\"  \"You shouldn't have talked like that to her!\" June snapped. \"Why don't you let her alone? She'll feel bad enough without you helping!\"  Anne rolled over on the bed and stared up at the ceiling. June took a helox lamp from her drawer and started to bake her hair darker. Those Earthmen were so funny about colors.  In the kitchen, Mary took the cake out of the oven. It was steamy and light and fluffy, and it smelled sweet and warm. She set it on the table and mixed a two-minute green frosting which she spread, carefully, over the cake. She patted here and there with the spatula and stood back, her eyes proud and serious.  She hummed a little tune under her breath as she scrubbed the pots and pans. Her hands moved in practiced rhythm, and the water splashed and gurgled. When the kitchen was again spotless, she looked once more at the cake, and then, turning out the light, she went back to her room.  Anne and Adele had left, but June was sitting quietly in the dusky moonlight. Her white dress seemed vaguely luminous.  Laughing, Mary flicked on the light.  \"It's a wonderful cake,\" she said. \"The best one I ever made. Just the way it should be.\"  \"I wouldn't feel too bad, Mary, if he doesn't come to eat it,\" June said. \"I don't want to sound like Anne, but there was a lot of sense in what she said.\"  \"It's just like a real wedding cake.\" She hummed the snatch of Martian tune. \"Like in the tele-papers.\" She laughed with her eyes. \"The bridegroom takes the silver knife and cuts two large pieces of the cake while the bride, dressed in filament coral, stands at his right hand. She carries a bouquet of--Anne just likes to be mean!\"  June frowned. Mary crossed to the dressing table. She studied her face in the mirror. It was heart shaped, elfin; her purple hair was a riot of curls, and her eyes were amethyst and gold. She smiled at herself. \"I want to look as pretty as I can tonight.\" She twisted around. \"You don't think he'll come either, do you?\"  \"I--no, Mary.\"  Mary looked back at the mirror. \"He likes our canal blossom perfume.\" She dabbed some of it on her ear lobes. \"I like it best, too.\"  June stood up, crossed to the musikon, found a slow five-toned waltz. She turned the music very low, and left the color mixer dim enough so that only the faintest ghosts projected hues moved on walls and ceiling.  Mary continued to stare into the mirror. \"But he will come. I know it.\"  June said nothing.  \"Don't you see. I just _know_ he'll come.\"  June crossed back to her seat.  Mary turned from the mirror. \"I'm sure he will. He's--I mean....\"  June smiled wanly.  \"Well, he will! You'll see!\"  June said, \"Even if it is an old dress, you look very nice in it.\"  \"I've been learning his language. I can say 'thank you' and 'yes' and 'no' and 'I love you' and all kinds of things in it. He gave me a book, and I've been studying. I want to be able really to talk with him. We've got a lot to talk about. I want to find out about his parents, and what he likes for supper and what kind of music he likes to hear, and--and all sorts of things. I want to find out all about his planet, and....\"  \"Yes,\" June said wearily, \"I know.\"  The music played on. The moving lights on the walls were like colored reflections from a sunlit river.  \"He may be a little late tonight; he has a lot to do, first. But he'll be here.\"  _Buzzzzz_....  It was the red button; it blinked on and off.  \"Visitors,\" June said.  \"Look--\" Mary said. \"Look, June. I'm not half ready yet. Look. Tell Miss Bestris I'll be down a little late. Tell her I have a special boy, and it'll be all right. He wants me to wait for him.\"  June was on her feet. \"... All right. You'd better not wait too long!\"  \"I won't.\"  After June was gone, Mary returned to the task of making her face pretty, but after a moment, she turned from the mirror, leaned back, and tried to relax. Underneath her dress, her heart was pounding.  The warm air carried sounds of the night creatures. One of the great canal insects, screeching, flapped by the window. The tiny third moon crept up over the horizon, and the buildings cast triple shadows.  _Buzzz. Buzzzz._  Still Mary waited.  _Buzzz. Buzzzz. Buzzzzzz...._  She was afraid to wait any longer. But by now she was sure that he would be down stairs.  There was a last-minute flurry of combing and primping, and then she rustled out of the room, her head erect, her eyes shining.         *       *       *       *       *  The large reception room was filling. Overhead, the color organ threw shimmering, prismatic beams on the ceiling. Beneath it, stiff, embarrassed spacemen, mostly officers dressed in parade uniforms, chatted in space-pidgin with the laughing, rainbow-haired girls.  Miss Bestris sat in one corner, her eyes roving the room: settling here for a second, there for a second, checking, approving, disapproving, silently. Occasionally she would smile or nod at one of the girls or one of the spacemen, and once she frowned ever so slightly and shook her head.  Anne was reclining on a couch, eating a golden Martian apple, listening to a second mate; she played with a lock of his hair and smiled her wide smile.  June, angelic, sat primly in a straight-backed chair, the captain at her feet, a boyish, space-pale Earthman, drew embarrassed circles on the carpet with his index finger.  In the next room, three couples were dancing to the slow music of an Earth orchestra.  An inner door opened, and a uniformed native sheriff stepped in, a crisp, military figure. \"Miss Bestris?\"  She stood up. \"Yes?\"  The Earthmen fell silent, waiting.  \"We think we have your runaway.\" He turned to the door. \"Bring her in.\"  Two more sheriffs entered, and between them, there was a young, slender girl. Her face was gaunt and tear-stained. Her body trembled. She looked at the Madame fearfully.  "]]]
