Bindle was wont to say that \"when yer goes into our parlour yer wants a map an' a guide, an' even then yer 'as to call for 'elp before yer can get out.\"  Mrs. Bindle had no visitors, and consequently her domestic holy of holies was never used.  She would dust and clean and arrange; arrange, clean, and dust with untiring zeal.  The windows, although never opened, were spotless; for she judged a woman's whole character by the appearance of her windows and curtains.  No religieuse ever devoted more time or thought to a chapel or an altar than Mrs. Bindle to her parlour.  She might have reconciled herself to leaving anything else in the world, but her parlour would have held her a helpless prisoner.  When everything was ready for the meal Mrs. Bindle poured from a saucepan a red-brown liquid with cubes of a darker brown, which splashed joyously into the dish.  Bindle recognised it as stewed steak and onions, the culinary joy of his heart.  With great appetite he fell to, almost thankful to Providence for sending him so excellent a cook.  As he ate he argued that if a man had an angel for a wife, in all likelihood she would not be able to cook, and perhaps after all he was not so badly off.  \"There ain't many as can beat yer at this 'ere game,\" remarked Bindle, indicating the dish with his fork; and a momentary flicker that might have been a smile still-born passed across Mrs. Bindle's face.  As the meal progressed Bindle began to see the folly of his cowardice. He had doomed himself to a night's walking the streets.  He cudgelled his brains how to avoid the consequences of his indiscretion.  He looked covertly at Mrs. Bindle.  There was nothing in the sharp hatchet-like face, with its sandy hair drawn tightly away from each side and screwed into a knot behind, that suggested compromise.  Nor was there any suggestion of a relenting nature in that hard grey line that served her as a mouth.  No, there was nothing for it but to \"carry the banner,\" unless he could raise sufficient money to pay for a night's lodging.  \"Saw Ginger to-day,\" he remarked conversationally, as he removed a shred of meat from a back tooth with his fork.  \"Don't talk to me of Ginger!\" snapped Mrs. Bindle.  Such retorts made conversation difficult.  It was Mrs. Bindle's question as to whether he did not think it about time he started that gave Bindle the inspiration he sought.  For more than a week the one clock of the household, a dainty little travelling affair that he had purchased of a fellow-workman, it having \"sort o' got lost\" in a move, had stopped and showed itself impervious to all persuasion Bindle decided to take it, ostensibly to a clock-repairer, but in reality to the pawn-shop, and thus raise the price of a night's lodging.  He would trust to luck to supply the funds to retrieve it.  With a word of explanation to Mrs. Bindle, he proceeded to wrap up the clock in a piece of newspaper, and prepared to go out.  To Bindle the moment of departure was always fraught with the greatest danger.  His goings-out became strategical withdrawals, he endeavouring to get off unnoticed, Mrs. Bindle striving to rake him with her verbal artillery as he retreated.  On this particular evening he felt comparatively safe.  He was, as far as Mrs. Bindle knew, going to \"a job,\" and, what was more, he was taking the clock to be repaired.  He sidled tactically along the wall towards the door, as if keenly interested in getting his pipe to draw. Mrs. Bindle opened fire.  \"How long's your job for?\"  She turned round in the act of wiping out a saucepan.  \"Only to-night,\" replied Bindle somewhat lamely.  He was afraid of where further romancing might lead him.  \"Call that a job?\" she enquired scornfully.  \"How long am I to go on keepin' you in idleness?\"  Mrs. Bindle cleaned the Alton Road Chapel, where she likewise worshipped, and to this she referred.  \"I'll get another job to-morrow; don't be down'earted,\" Bindle replied cheerfully.  \"Down'earted!  Y' ought to be ashamed o' yerself,\" exploded Mrs. Bindle, as she banged the saucepan upon its shelf and seized a broom. Bindle regarded her with expressionless face.  \"Y' ought to be ashamed o' yerself, yer great hulkin' brute.\"  At one time Bindle, who was well below medium height and average weight, had grinned appreciatively at this description; but it had a little lost its savour by repetition.  \"Call yerself a man!\" she continued, her sharp voice rising in volume and key.  \"Leavin' me to keep the sticks together--me, a woman too, a-keepin' you in idleness!  Why, I'd steal 'fore I'd do that, that I would.\"  She made vigorous use of the broom.  Her anger invariably manifested itself in dust, a momentary forgetfulness of her religious convictions, and a lapse into the Doric.  As a rule she was careful and mincing in her speech, but anger opened the flood-gates of her vocabulary, and words rushed forth bruised and decapitated.  With philosophic self-effacement Bindle covered the few feet between him and the door and vanished.  He was a philosopher and, like Socrates, he bowed to the whirlwind of his wife's wrath.  Conscious of having done everything humanly possible to obtain work, he faced the world with unruffled calm.  Mrs. Bindle's careless words, however, sank deeply into his mind. Steal!  Well, he had no very strongly-grounded objection, provided he were not caught at it.  Steal!  The word seemed to open up new possibilities for him.  The thing was, how should he begin?  He might seize a leg of mutton from a butcher's shop and run; but then Nature had not intended him for a runner.  He might smash a jeweller's window, pick a pocket, or snatch a handbag; but in all these adventures fleetness of foot seemed essential.  Crime seemed obviously for the sprinter.  To become a burger required experience and tools, and Bindle possessed neither.  Besides, burgling involved more risks than he cared to take.  Had he paused to think, Bindle would have seen that stealing was crime; but his incurable love of adventure blinded him to all else.  \"Funny thing,\" he mumbled as he walked down Fenton Street.  \"Funny thing, a daughter o' the Lord wantin' me to steal.  Wonder wot ole 'Earty 'ud say.\"     CHAPTER II  A NOCTURNAL ADVENTURE   I  Having exchanged the clock for seven shillings and badly beaten the pawnbroker's assistant in a verbal duel, Bindle strolled along towards Walham Green in the happiest frame of mind.  The night was young, it was barely nine o'clock, and his whole being yearned for some adventure.  He was still preoccupied with the subject of larceny.  His wits, Bindle argued, were of little or no use in the furniture-removing business, where mediocrity formed the standard of excellence.  There would never be a Napoleon of furniture-removers, but there had been several Napoleons of crime.  If a man were endowed with genius, he should also be supplied with a reasonable outlet for it.  Walking meditatively along the North End Road, he was awakened to realities by his foot suddenly striking against something that jingled. He stooped and picked up two keys attached to a ring, which he swiftly transferred to one of his pockets and passed on.  Someone might be watching him.  Two minutes later he drew forth his find for examination.  Attached to the ring was a metal tablet, upon which were engraved the words: \"These keys are the property of Professor Sylvanus Conti, 13 Audrey Mansions, Queen's Club, West Kensington, W.  Reward for their return, 2s. 6d.\"  The keys were obviously those of the outer door of a block of mansions and the door of a flat.  If they were returned the reward was two shillings and sixpence, which would bring up the day's takings to nine shillings and sixpence.  If, on the other hand, the keys were retained for the purpose of----  At that moment Bindle's eye caught sight of a ticket upon a stall littered with old locks and keys, above which blazed and spluttered a paraffin torch.  \"Keys cut while you wait,\" it announced.  Without a moment's hesitation he slipped the two keys from their ring and held them out to the proprietor of the stall.  \"'Ow much to make two like 'em, mate?\" he enquired.  The man took the keys, examined them for a moment, and replied:  \"One an' thruppence from you, capt'in.\"  \"Well, think o' me as a pretty girl an' say a bob, an' it's done,\" replied Bindle.  The man regarded him with elaborate gravity for a few moments.  \"If yer turn yer face away I'll try,\" he replied, and proceeded to fashion the duplicates.  Meanwhile Bindle deliberated.  If he retained the keys there would be suspicion at the flats, and perhaps locks would be changed; if, on the other hand, the keys were returned immediately, the owner would trouble himself no further.  At this juncture he was not very clear as to what he intended to do. He was still undecided when the four keys were handed to him in return for a shilling.  The mind of Joseph Bindle invariably responded best to the ministrations of beer, and when, half an hour later, he left the bar of the Purple Goat, his plans were formed, and his mind made up.  He vaguely saw the hand of Providence in this discovery of Professor Conti's keys, and he was determined that Providence should not be disappointed in him, Joseph Bindle.  First he bought a cheap electric torch, guaranteed for twelve or twenty-four hours--the shopkeeper was not quite certain which.  Then, proceeding to a chemist's shop, he purchased a roll of medical bandaging.  With this he retired up a side street and proceeded to swathe his head and the greater part of his face, leaving only his eyes, nose, and mouth visible.

The Greek form of the same verb was ESMI, which became ASMI,   and in Latin the first and last vowels have disappeared, the verb is SUM.  Similar relationships are traced in the numerals, and throughout all the languages of these nations.  The Romans, like the Etruscans who came before them, were neither poetical nor imaginative in temperament.  Their activity ran in practical directions.  They therefore invented few, if any stories, of the gods whom they worshipped with fixed rites.  Mr. Macaulay speaks of these gods as \"the sober abstractions of the Roman pantheon.\"  We owe most of the stories of the ancient mythology to the wit and fancy of the Greeks,   more playful and imaginative,   who seized from Egypt and from the East such legends as pleased them,   and adapted them in their own way.  It often happens that such stories, resembling each other in their foundation, are found in the Greek and Roman authors in several different forms.  To understand these stories, we will here first acquaint ourselves with the ideas of the structure of the universe, which the poets and others held, and which will form the scenery, so to speak, of the narratives.  The Greek poets believed the earth to be flat and circular, their own country occupying the middle of it, the central point being either Mount Olympus, the abode of the gods, or Delphi, so famous for its oracle.  The circular disk of the earth was crossed from west to east, and divided into two equal parts by the SEA, as they called the Mediterranean, and its continuation the Euxine.  Around the earth flowed the RIVER OCEAN, its course being from south to north on the western side of the earth, and in a contrary direction on the eastern side.  It flowed in a steady, equable current, unvexed by storm or tempest.  The sea, and all the rivers on earth, received their waters from it.  The northern portion of the earth was supposed to be inhabited by a happy race named the Hyperboreans [this word means \"who live beyond the north\" from the word \"hyper,\" beyond, and boreas, the north wind], dwelling in everlasting bliss and spring beyond the lofty mountains whose caverns were supposed to send forth the piercing blasts of the north wind, which chilled the people of Hellas (Greece).  Their country was inaccessible by land or sea. They lived exempt from disease or old age, from toils and warfare.  Moore has given us the \"Song of a Hyperborean,\" beginning    \"I come from a land in the sun-bright deep,   Where golden gardens glow,   Where the winds of the north, becalmed in sleep,   Their conch-shells never blow.\"  On the south side of the earth, close to the stream of Ocean, dwelt a people happy and virtuous as the Hyperboreans.  They were named the AEthiopians.  The gods favored them so highly that they were wont to leave at times their Olympian abodes, and go to share their sacrifices and banquets.  On the western margin of the earth, by the stream of Ocean, lay a happy place named the Elysian Plain, whither mortals favored by the gods were transported without tasting of death, to enjoy an immortality of bliss.  This happy region was also called the \"fortunate fields,\" and the \"Isles of the Blessed.\"  We thus see that the Greeks of the early ages knew little of any real people except those to the east and south of their own country, or near the coast of the Mediterranean.  Their imagination meantime peopled the western portion of this sea with giants, monsters, and enchantresses; while they placed around the disk of the earth, which they probably regarded as of no great width, nations enjoying the peculiar favor of the gods, and blessed with happiness and longevity.  The Dawn, the Sun, and the Moon were supposed to rise out of the Ocean, on the western side, and to drive through the air, giving light to gods and men.  The stars also, except those forming Charles' Wain or Bear, and others near them, rose out of and sank into the stream of Ocean.  There the sun-god embarked in a winged boat, which conveyed him round by the northern part of the earth, back to his place of rising in the east.  Milton alludes to this in his \"Commmus.\"    \"Now the gilded car of day   His golden axle doth allay   In the steep Atlantic stream,   And the slope sun his upward beam   Shoots against the dusky pole,   Pacing towards the other goal   Of his chamber in the east.\"  The abode of the gods was on the summit of Mount Olympus, in Thessaly.  A gate of clouds, kept by the goddesses named the Seasons, opened to permit the passage of the Celestials to earth, and to receive them on their return.  The gods had their separate dwellings; but all, when summoned, repaired to the palace of Jupiter [Or Zeus.  The relation of these names to each other will be explained on the next page], as did also those deities whose usual abode was the earth, the waters, or the underworld.  It was also in the great hall of the palace of the Olympian king that the gods feasted each day on ambrosia and nectar, their food and drink, the latter being handed round by the lovely goddess Hebe. Here they conversed of the affairs of heaven and earth; and as they quaffed their nectar, Apollo, the god of music, delighted them with the tones of his lyre, to which the muses sang in responsive strains.  When the sun was set, the gods retired to sleep in their respective dwellings.  The following lines from the Odyssey will show how Homer conceived of Olympus:--    \"So saying, Minerva, goddess azure-eyed,   Rose to Olympus, the reputed seat   Eternal of the gods, which never storms   Disturb, rains drench, or snow invades, but calm  The expanse and cloudless shines with purest day.   T here the inhabitants divine rejoice   Forever.:\" Cowper  Such were the abodes of the gods as the Greeks conceived them. The Romans, before they knew the Greek poetry, seem to have had no definite imagination of such an assembly of gods.  But the Roman and Etruscan races were by no means irreligious.  They venerated their departed ancestors,   and in each family the worship of these ancestors was an important duty.  The images of the ancestors were kept in a sacred place,   each family observed, at fixed times, memorial rites in their honor,   and for these and other religious observances the family hearth was consecrated.  The earliest rites of Roman worship are supposed to be connected with such family devotions.  As the Greeks and Romans became acquainted with other nations, they imported their habits of worship, even in early times.  It will be remembered that as late as St. Paul's time, he found an altar at Athens \"to an unknown god.\"  Greeks and Romans alike were willing to receive from other nations the legends regarding their gods, and to incorporate them as well as they could with their own.  It is thus that in the poetical mythology of those nations, which we are now to study, we frequently find a Latin and a Greek name for one imagined divinity.  Thus Zeus, of the Greeks, becomes in Latin   with the addition of the word pater (a father) [The reader will observe that father is one of the words derived from an Ayan root.  Let p and t become rough, as the grammarians say,   let p become ph, and t th, and you have phather or father], Jupiter   Kronos of the Greeks appears as \"Vulcanus\" of the Latins, \"Ares\" of the Greeks is \"Mars\" or Mavors of the Latins, \"Poseidon\" of the Greeks is \"Neptunus\" of the Latins, \"Aphrodite\" of the Greeks is \"Venus\" of the Latins. This variation is not to be confounded with a mere translation, as where \"Paulos\" of the Greek becomes \"Paulus\" in Latin, or \"Odysseus\" becomes \"Ulysses,\"   or as when \"Pierre\" of the French becomes \"Peter\" in English.  What really happened was, that as the Romans, more cultivated than their fathers, found in Greek literature a god of fire and smithery,   they transferred his name \"Hephaistos\" to their own old god \"Vulcanus,\"   who had the same duties,   and in their after literature the Latin name was used for the stories of Greek and Latin origin.  As the English literature came into being largely on French and Latin models, and as French is but a degraded Latin and retains Latin roots largely,   in our older English poets the Latin forms of these names are generally used.  In our own generation, with the precision now so much courted, a fashion has come in, of designating Mars by his Greek name of \"Ares,\" Venus by her name of \"Aphrodite,\" and so on.  But in this book, as our object is to make familiar the stores of general English literature which refer to such subjects, we shall retain, in general, the Latin names,   only calling the attention of the reader to the Greek names, as they appear in Greek authors,   and in many writers of the more recent English schools.  The real monarch of the heavens in the mythology of both Greece and Rome is Jupiter (Zeus-pater, father-Jove) [Jove appears to be a word derived from the same root as Zeus, and it appears in the root dev of the Sanscrit, where devas are gods of different forms.  Our English word devil probably comes from the French diable, Italian diavolo, Latin diabolus, one who makes division,- - literally one who separates balls, or throws balls about,-- instead of throwing them frankly and truly at the batsman.  It is not to be traced to the Sanscrit deva.]  In the mythological system we are tracing Zeus is himself the father of many of the gods, and he is often spoken of as father of gods and men.  He is the father of Vulcan [In Greek Hephaistos], of Venus [in Greek Aphrodite], of Minerva [in Greek Pallas Athene, or either name separately], of Apollo [of Phoebus], Diana [in Greek Artemis], and of Mercury [in Greek Hermes], who are ranked among the twelve superior gods, and of many inferior deities.  But Jupiter himself is not the original deity in these systems.  He is the son of"]]]
