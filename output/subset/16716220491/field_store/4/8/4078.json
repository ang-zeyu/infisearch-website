Were they to know of us now, it is practically certain that they would be able to develop powers and mechanisms by the use of which they would negate our every effort--they would hurl us out of this, our native space and time. We must have time ... given time, we shall succeed. There shall be Lenses ... and entities of Civilization worthy in every respect to wear them. But we of Arisia alone will never be able to conquer the Eddorians. Indeed, while this is not yet certain, the probability is exceedingly great that despite our utmost efforts at self-development our descendants will have to breed, from some people to evolve upon a planet not yet in existence, an entirely new race--a race tremendously more capable than ours--to succeed us as Guardians of Civilization.\"         *       *       *       *       *  _Centuries passed. Millenia. Cosmic and geologic ages. Planets cooled to solidity and stability. Life formed and grew and developed. And as life evolved it was subjected to, and strongly if subtly affected by, the diametrically opposed forces of Arisia and Eddore._     CHAPTER 2  THE FALL OF ATLANTIS  1. EDDORE   \"Members of the Innermost Circle, wherever you are and whatever you may be doing, tune in!\" the All-Highest broadcast. \"Analysis of the data furnished by the survey just completed shows that in general the Great Plan is progressing satisfactorily. There seem to be only four planets which our delegates have not been or may not be able to control properly: Sol III, Rigel IV, Velantia III, and Palain VII. All four, you will observe, are in the other galaxy. No trouble whatever has developed in our own.  \"Of these four, the first requires drastic and immediate personal attention. Its people, in the brief interval since our previous general survey, have developed nuclear energy and have fallen into a cultural pattern which does not conform in any respect to the basic principles laid down by us long since. Our deputies there, thinking erroneously that they could handle matters without reporting fully to or calling for help upon the next higher operating echelon, must be disciplined sharply. Failure, from whatever cause, can not be tolerated.  \"Gharlane, as Master Number Two, you will assume control of Sol III immediately. This Circle now authorizes and instructs you to take whatever steps may prove necessary to restore order upon that planet. Examine carefully this data concerning the other three worlds which may very shortly become troublesome. Is it your thought that one or more others of this Circle should be assigned to work with you, to be sure that these untoward developments are suppressed?\"  \"It is not, Your Supremacy,\" that worthy decided, after a time of study. \"Since the peoples in question are as yet of low intelligence; since one form of flesh at a time is all that will have to be energized; and since the techniques will be essentially similar; I can handle all four more efficiently alone than with the help or cooperation of others. If I read this data correctly, there will be need of only the most elementary precaution in the employment of mental force, since of the four races, only the Velantians have even a rudimentary knowledge of its uses. Right?\"  \"We so read the data.\" Surprisingly enough, the Innermost Circle agreed unanimously.  \"Go, then. When finished, report in full.\"  \"I go, All-Highest. I shall render a complete and conclusive report.\"   2. ARISIA  \"We, the Elder Thinkers in fusion, are spreading in public view, for study and full discussion, a visualization of the relationships existing and to exist between Civilization and its irreconcilable and implacable foe. Several of our younger members, particularly Eukonidor, who has just attained Watchmanship, have requested instruction in this matter. Being as yet immature, their visualizations do not show clearly why Nedanillor, Kriedigan, Drounli, and Brolenteen, either singly or in fusion, have in the past performed certain acts and have not performed certain others; or that the future actions of those Moulders of Civilization will be similarly constrained.  \"This visualization, while more complex, more complete, and more detailed than the one set up by our forefathers at the time of the Coalescence, agrees with it in every essential. The five basics remain unchanged. First: the Eddorians can be overcome only by mental force. Second: the magnitude of the required force is such that its only possible generator is such an organization as the Galactic Patrol toward which we have been and are working. Third: since no Arisian or any fusion of Arisians will ever be able to spear-head that force, it was and is necessary to develop a race of mentality sufficient to perform that task. Fourth: this new race, having been instrumental in removing the menace of Eddore, will as a matter of course displace the Arisians as Guardians of Civilization. Fifth: the Eddorians must not become informed of us until such a time as it will be physically, mathematically impossible for them to construct any effective counter-devices.\"  \"A cheerless outlook, truly,\" came a somber thought.  \"Not so, daughter. A little reflection will show you that your present thinking is loose and turbid. When that time comes, every Arisian will be ready for the change. We know the way. We do not know to what that way leads; but the Arisian purpose in this phase of existence--this space-time continuum--will have been fulfilled and we will go eagerly and joyfully on to the next. Are there any more questions?\"  There were none.  \"Study this material, then, each of you, with exceeding care. It may be that some one of you, even a child, will perceive some facet of the truth which we have missed or have not examined fully; some fact or implication which may be made to operate to shorten the time of conflict or to lessen the number of budding Civilizations whose destruction seems to us at present to be sheerly unavoidable.\"  Hours passed. Days. No criticisms or suggestions were offered.  \"We take it, then, that this visualization is the fullest and most accurate one possible for the massed intellect of Arisia to construct from the information available at the moment. The Moulders therefore, after describing briefly what they have already done, will inform us as to what they deem it necessary to do in the near future.\"  \"We have observed, and at times have guided, the evolution of intelligent life upon many planets,\" the fusion began. \"We have, to the best of our ability, directed the energies of these entities into the channels of Civilization; we have adhered consistently to the policy of steering as many different races as possible toward the intellectual level necessary for the effective use of the Lens, without which the proposed Galactic Patrol cannot come into being.  \"For many cycles of time we have been working as individuals with the four strongest races, from one of which will be developed the people who will one day replace us as Guardians of Civilization. Blood lines have been established. We have encouraged matings which concentrate traits of strength and dissipate those of weakness. While no very great departure from the norm, either physically or mentally, will take place until after the penultimates have been allowed to meet and to mate, a definite general improvement of each race has been unavoidable.  \"Thus the Eddorians have already interested themselves in our budding Civilization upon the planet Tellus, and it is inevitable that they will very shortly interfere with our work upon the other three. These four young Civilizations must be allowed to fall. It is to warn every Arisian against well-meant but inconsidered action that this conference was called. We ourselves will operate through forms of flesh of no higher intelligence than, and indistinguishable from, the natives of the planets affected. No traceable connection will exist between those forms and us. No other Arisians will operate within extreme range of any one of those four planets; they will from now on be given the same status as has been so long accorded Eddore itself. The Eddorians must not learn of us until after it is too late for them to act effectively upon that knowledge. Any chance bit of information obtained by any Eddorian must be obliterated at once. It is to guard against and to negate such accidental disclosures that our Watchmen have been trained.\"  \"But if all of our Civilizations go down....\" Eukonidor began to protest.  \"Study will show you, youth, that the general level of mind, and hence of strength, is rising,\" the fused Elders interrupted. \"The trend is ever upward; each peak and valley being higher than its predecessor. When the indicated level has been reached--the level at which the efficient use of the Lens will become possible--we will not only allow ourselves to become known to them; we will engage them at every point.\"  \"One factor remains obscure.\" A Thinker broke the ensuing silence. \"In this visualization I do not perceive anything to preclude the possibility that the Eddorians may at any time visualize us. Granted that the Elders of long ago did not merely visualize the Eddorians, but perceived them in time-space surveys; that they and subsequent Elders were able to maintain the status quo; and that the Eddorian way of thought is essentially mechanistic, rather than philosophic, in nature. There is still a possibility that the enemy may be able to deduce us by processes of logic alone. This thought is particularly disturbing to me at the present time because a rigid statistical analysis of the occurrences upon those four planets shows that they cannot possibly have been due to chance. With such an analysis as a starting point, a mind of even moderate ability could visualize us practically in toto. I assume, however, that this possibility "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32735"],["title","Forsyte's Retreat (#1)"],["body","below the street level. The kitchens, laundry, warehouse, baggage-room, switchboard room, ice-plant and personnel spaces sprawled through an acre of underground levels. They boiled with sweating men and dishevelled women engaged in the intricate business of housing, feeding, clothing, liquoring and catering to a small city under one roof. Then he remembered how small the quarters were upstairs.  How could they _house_ enough guests to justify all this?  Returning to his office he called the employment bureau. \"Mr. Crowson? Forsyte here! I'm at the hotel.\"  \"Oh dear, what's wrong now?\"  \"You didn't tell me to whom I should report. This, ah, is my first experience with employment agencies. Usually there is a board of directors.\"  \"Is that all?\" Crowson sighed audibly. \"You are in full charge, I assure you. Our little interview was quite satisfactory. I have certified you to your bookkeeping department, and you may draw upon your salary after a week. Anything else?\"  \"Where may I reach the owner or the chairman in an emergency?\"  \"The owner is a Dr. Bradford who is in Hanford, Washington. Top secret government work. He may not be contacted until he returns. Sorry, that's all I can tell you. Getting on all right, Mr. Forsyte?\" he asked with obvious reluctance.  Sextus cut off. Two lights on the intercom were blinking at him. One call was from the kitchen. The first chef had just heaved a cleaver at the steward, and the head salad girl was in hysterics.  Sextus said he'd be right down. The second call was from the chief house-detective. He had caught a bell-hop peddling marijuana to the waitresses. What was the manager's new policy? Sextus told him to hold the boy in the locker room for him. Then one of the room clerks rang to say that Gary Gable, the movie star, was raising hell in the lobby because he couldn't get the bridal suite and demanded to see the manager.  Sextus smiled. These things were the routine of running a large hotel. He stopped at the bar for a quick one and then started for the kitchen.         *       *       *       *       *  The day passed pleasantly enough, and he looked forward to retiring to his quiet rooms upstairs. He thought to get some intelligent answers from his assistant manager when he walked in promptly at five P. M., but he turned out to be a university student from Southern Cal, working days on his master's degree in business administration and nights at the hotel. No wonder he hadn't been promoted. Not that he wasn't bright--just not experienced.  Sextus formally offered his hand and introduced himself. The lad said, \"I'm Horace Smith the phone is ringing excuse me.\" He snatched the phone with a harried look.  Somehow the phone never stopped ringing. Sextus gave up and retired to dress for dinner. He finished his fifth of whiskey and descended to the hotel's swank Oceania Room, where he made himself known to the maitre d'hotel. That frenzied little moustachioed person sniffed Sextus' breath and seated him behind a potted palm.  Discreetly avoiding the wine list, Sextus dined well, noting several movie stars and other vip's in the crowded dining room. He couldn't escape the illusion that he was dining at the Ambassador or the Waldorf Astoria--instead of in a five-story rat-trap. Where did they all come from?  As he awaited the elevator, he was approached by the bell-captain. \"Mr. Forsyte?\" Sextus nodded stiffly. \"Here's an envelope Mr. Patterson left for you. He was the last G. M. Incidentally, sorry I was a little rough on the phone, but you can see our situation here. Understaffed and overcrowded. It gets thick, real thick, brother.\"  Sextus felt his belly muscles tighten. \"Confusion is never improved by discourtesy or insubordination,\" he said coldly.  At that moment a bellman rushed up to the rebuffed captain who was regarding Sextus with a restrained loathing. \"The guy in C332 keeps screaming for his beer, but the service elevator to 'C' vector keeps dumping me off in 'F'.\"  The captain said, \"Try riding to fourth on 'C' and then walk down a deck and come out through the linen room.\"  \"Can't I just ride up the guest elevator, Jack?\"  The captain stared at Sextus. \"Our Mr. Forsyte wouldn't approve. Now, move!\"  He turned to Sextus and said acidly, \"Just one of our little extra problems.\" He moved off with a disgusted shake of his carefully barbered head.  The nature of the bell-captain's special problem sounded interesting, but the details confused Sextus. _Ride to four on \"C\", walk down to three and out by the linen closet._ Sounded like three-dimensional chess.  His cage arrived and he returned to his suite. He removed his shoes, stripped to the waist and sank gratefully into the soft bed, nestling the last bottle of his suitcase reserve in the crook of his bare arm.  He considered the sealed envelope marked: TO MY SUCCESSOR. URGENT MATTERS.  First he opened a fresh bottle and then the envelope. He flipped through the papers. There were some tax reports ready for signature, two union contracts up for renegotiation and an estimate on re-doing 520 rooms in vectors \"B\" and \"F\". Vectors? Did they mean \"Wings\"?  The last paper was a personal letter, apparently addressed to him. Before he could begin it the phone at his bedside jangled. Operator said, \"Would you take this, please, Mr. Forsyte? I dispatched a house man, but the guest is hysterical.\"  Without awaiting his permission she cut in the woman. \"Hello, manager? There's a man in my bed!\"  \"What is your room number, madame?\" Sextus asked with drowsy detachment.  \"I'm in H-408,\" she said, and on the \"8\" her voice ran up the scale in a quivering crescendo that launched Sextus briskly from his bed. H-408 was his floor and his wing, luckily. He tore out of the suite and down the hall without shirt or shoes.  The door stood ajar, and he pushed it open. In the middle of the floor, still gabbling into the phone, stood a lumpy, pallid woman about his own age, naked except for a pillow which she hugged fiercely to her navel. Her bleached hair was a frayed bird's-nest.  In bed, decently clad in a pair of blue and white striped pajamas, was a rather distinguished, gray-haired gentleman of about fifty, leaning on one elbow and watching the woman with an expression of mild astonishment and interest. To Sextus' practiced eye, the man was guilty of nothing.  The house detective arrived at that moment, but Sextus dismissed him with a wave of his hand. He went in alone.  \"I'm the manager, madam,\" he assured her. He noted that despite her excited wails, her eyes drooped half shut. A bottle of sleeping pills on the table was uncapped.  \"Thizz man, thizz man, thizz man!\" she kept repeating and pointing her elbow at the bed. The man in question raised his eyebrows and shook his head.  \"Damndest sensation I ever felt,\" he said. \"I'm Johnathan P. Turner, attorney. Before I tell you my story, please check with the desk and verify that I was assigned this room.\"  Sextus took the phone from the woman's pudgy hand which darted to rescue the sagging pillow. The room-clerk reported that Mr. J. P. Turner was registered to room 408, but in \"J\" vector, not \"H\".  Sextus' eyes swept the room. It was an unexplainable mess. Two sets of luggage were jumbled on and around the baggage rack at the foot of the bed. Rinsed out nylons hung from the shower rod, but a man's shaving kit occupied the shelf over the lavatory. Despairing of ever arriving at a sensible explanation, Sextus went to work.  Although hampered somewhat without his shirt, coat and tie, Sextus managed to get Turner and his belongings transferred peaceably to another room and the woman quieted down in bed with another sleeping pill.  Then Turner was allowed to tell his story. \"I had turned in early and was lying there on my back reading the paper when suddenly I got the most messy feeling all through me. It was like--oh, hell, I can't say it. Anyhow, in just about a second, something went _thub!_--and there she was in bed with me--naked!\" he added with a shiver.  Sextus grasped at a straw. \"How many did you have to drink this evening, Mr. Turner?\"  The attorney squirmed uncomfortably. \"Well, quite a few, maybe, but not enough to--\"  Sextus shrugged one shoulder and turned to leave. \"Understand, we don't blame you a bit, sir. You know how these middle-aged women can carry on when they get out on the town. You must have dozed off before she slipped in.\"  \"But my door was locked! I think,\" he added uncertainly.  \"We won't breathe a word of it, Mr. Turner. Rest well!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sextus padded silently back to his room in his stocking feet and took a long pull at the whiskey. Funny thing, this. People often got into the wrong hotel beds, but rarely with such impalpable excuses. He sighed and picked up the letter from his predecessor again. It read:       Welcome to the Phony-Plaza. (That name again.) You will be the      fifth manager in 30 days. If you need the job as much as I      thought I did you will probably ignore my advice, but here      goes, anyway: RESIGN! BAIL OUT! SKIDOO! (The man was emphatic.)      I can't tell you where they've got the 2600 rooms in this      haunted ant-hill, but believe me, they are there, and you'll be      sorry if you hang around long enough to prove it.       _My_ predecessor left a garbled note about some _hyperspace_      system that the owner, Dr. Bradford, has figured out. Actually,      there are only 260 rooms, as you've probably surmised. But this      Bradford, who is a nuclear physicist, by the way, has installed      some sort of field generator in each elevator shaft that gives      entry to these rooms at _ten different locations in time_. Room      500, for instance, in Vector A is 10 years from Vector B. So      when you run to capacity with, say, two people to the room, you      have 5200 guests in 260 rooms! They all live by the same      calendar, but in their rooms they are actually centuries apart."]]]
