Ye fondle me now, but to strike me betimes.            (A treacherous lover, the sea!)           Once I saw as I lay, half-awash in the night           A hull in the gloom -- a quick hail -- and a light           And I lurched o'er to leeward and saved her for spite            From the doom that ye meted to me.            I was sister to 'Terrible', seventy-four,            (Yo ho! for the swing of the sea!)           And ye sank her in fathoms a thousand or more            (Alas! for the might of the sea!)           Ye taunt me and sing me her fate for a sign!           What harm can ye wreak more on me or on mine?           Ho braggart!  I care not for boasting of thine --            A fig for the wrath of the sea!            Some night to the lee of the land I shall steal,            (Heigh-ho to be home from the sea!)           No pilot but Death at the rudderless wheel,            (None knoweth the harbor as he!)           To lie where the slow tide creeps hither and fro           And the shifting sand laps me around, for I know           That my gallant old crew are in Port long ago --            For ever at peace with the sea!     Quebec            1608-1908             Of old, like Helen, guerdon of the strong --            Like Helen fair, like Helen light of word, --           \"The spoils unto the conquerors belong.            Who winneth me must win me by the sword.\"            Grown old, like Helen, once the jealous prize            That strong men battled for in savage hate,           Can she look forth with unregretful eyes,            Where sleep Montcalm and Wolfe beside her gate?     Then and Now              Beneath her window in the fragrant night            I half forget how truant years have flown           Since I looked up to see her chamber-light,            Or catch, perchance, her slender shadow thrown           Upon the casement; but the nodding leaves            Sweep lazily across the unlit pane,           And to and fro beneath the shadowy eaves,            Like restless birds, the breath of coming rain           Creeps, lilac-laden, up the village street            When all is still, as if the very trees           Were listening for the coming of her feet            That come no more; yet, lest I weep, the breeze           Sings some forgotten song of those old years           Until my heart grows far too glad for tears.     Unsolved              Amid my books I lived the hurrying years,            Disdaining kinship with my fellow man;           Alike to me were human smiles and tears,            I cared not whither Earth's great life-stream ran,           Till as I knelt before my mouldered shrine,            God made me look into a woman's eyes;           And I, who thought all earthly wisdom mine,            Knew in a moment that the eternal skies           Were measured but in inches, to the quest            That lay before me in that mystic gaze.           \"Surely I have been errant:  it is best            That I should tread, with men their human ways.\"           God took the teacher, ere the task was learned,           And to my lonely books again I turned.     The Hope of My Heart            \"Delicta juventutis et ignorantius ejus,                   quoesumus ne memineris, Domine.\"              I left, to earth, a little maiden fair,            With locks of gold, and eyes that shamed the light;           I prayed that God might have her in His care                       And sight.            Earth's love was false; her voice, a siren's song;            (Sweet mother-earth was but a lying name)           The path she showed was but the path of wrong                       And shame.            \"Cast her not out!\" I cry.  God's kind words come --            \"Her future is with Me, as was her past;           It shall be My good will to bring her home                       At last.\"     Penance             My lover died a century ago,           Her dear heart stricken by my sland'rous breath,           Wherefore the Gods forbade that I should know                       The peace of death.            Men pass my grave, and say, \"'Twere well to sleep,           Like such an one, amid the uncaring dead!\"           How should they know the vigils that I keep,                       The tears I shed?            Upon the grave, I count with lifeless breath,           Each night, each year, the flowers that bloom and die,           Deeming the leaves, that fall to dreamless death,                       More blest than I.            'Twas just last year -- I heard two lovers pass           So near, I caught the tender words he said:           To-night the rain-drenched breezes sway the grass                       Above his head.            That night full envious of his life was I,           That youth and love should stand at his behest;           To-night, I envy him, that he should lie                       At utter rest.     Slumber Songs               I            Sleep, little eyes           That brim with childish tears amid thy play,           Be comforted!  No grief of night can weigh           Against the joys that throng thy coming day.            Sleep, little heart!           There is no place in Slumberland for tears:           Life soon enough will bring its chilling fears           And sorrows that will dim the after years.           Sleep, little heart!               II            Ah, little eyes           Dead blossoms of a springtime long ago,           That life's storm crushed and left to lie below           The benediction of the falling snow!            Sleep, little heart           That ceased so long ago its frantic beat!           The years that come and go with silent feet           Have naught to tell save this -- that rest is sweet.           Dear little heart.     The Oldest Drama                 _\"It fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.                And he said unto his father, My head, my head.  And he said to a lad,                Carry him to his mother.  And . . . he sat on her knees till noon,                and then died.  And she went up, and laid him on the bed. . . .                And shut the door upon him and went out.\"_              Immortal story that no mother's heart            Ev'n yet can read, nor feel the biting pain           That rent her soul!  Immortal not by art            Which makes a long past sorrow sting again            Like grief of yesterday:  but since it said            In simplest word the truth which all may see,           Where any mother sobs above her dead            And plays anew the silent tragedy.     Recompense              I saw two sowers in Life's field at morn,            To whom came one in angel guise and said,           \"Is it for labour that a man is born?            Lo:  I am Ease.  Come ye and eat my bread!\"           Then gladly one forsook his task undone            And with the Tempter went his slothful way,           The other toiled until the setting sun            With stealing shadows blurred the dusty day.            Ere harvest time, upon earth's peaceful breast            Each laid him down among the unreaping dead.           \"Labour hath other recompense than rest,            Else were the toiler like the fool,\" I said;           \"God meteth him not less, but rather more           Because he sowed and others reaped his store.\"     Mine Host              There stands a hostel by a travelled way;            Life is the road and Death the worthy host;           Each guest he greets, nor ever lacks to say,            \"How have ye fared?\"  They answer him, the most,           \"This lodging place is other than we sought;            We had intended farther, but the gloom           Came on apace, and found us ere we thought:            Yet will we lodge.  Thou hast abundant room.\"            Within sit haggard men that speak no word,            No fire gleams their cheerful welcome shed;           No voice of fellowship or strife is heard            But silence of a multitude of dead.           \"Naught can I offer ye,\" quoth Death, \"but rest!\"           And to his chamber leads each tired guest.     Equality              I saw a King, who spent his life to weave            Into a nation all his great heart thought,           Unsatisfied until he should achieve            The grand ideal that his manhood sought;           Yet as he saw the end within his reach,            Death took the sceptre from his failing hand,           And all men said, \"He gave his life to teach            The task of honour to a sordid land!\"           Within his gates I saw, through all those years,            One at his humble toil with cheery face,           Whom (being dead) the children, half in tears,            Remembered oft, and missed him from his place.           If he be greater that his people blessed           Than he the children loved, God knoweth best.     Anarchy              I saw a city filled with lust and shame,            Where men, like wolves, slunk through the grim half-light;           And sudden, in the midst of it, there came            One who spoke boldly for the cause of Right.            And speaking, fell before that brutish race            Like some poor wren that shrieking eagles tear,           While brute Dishonour, with her bloodless face            Stood by and smote his lips that moved in prayer.            \"Speak not of God!  In centuries that word            Hath not been uttered!  Our own king are we.\"           And God stretched forth his finger as He heard            And o'er it cast a thousand leagues of sea.     Disarmament      "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/353"],["title","In Flanders Fields, and Other Poems (#2)"],["body","        One spake amid the nations, \"Let us cease            From darkening with strife the fair World's light,           We who are great in war be great in peace.            No longer let us plead the cause by might.\"            But from a million British graves took birth            A silent voice -- the million spake as one --           \"If ye have righted all the wrongs of earth            Lay by the sword!  Its work and ours is done.\"     The Dead Master              Amid earth's vagrant noises, he caught the note sublime:           To-day around him surges from the silences of Time           A flood of nobler music, like a river deep and broad,           Fit song for heroes gathered in the banquet-hall of God.     The Harvest of the Sea              The earth grows white with harvest; all day long            The sickles gleam, until the darkness weaves           Her web of silence o'er the thankful song            Of reapers bringing home the golden sheaves.            The wave tops whiten on the sea fields drear,            And men go forth at haggard dawn to reap;           But ever 'mid the gleaners' song we hear            The half-hushed sobbing of the hearts that weep.     The Dying of Pere Pierre                 \". . . with two other priests; the same night he died,                and was buried by the shores of the lake that bears his name.\"                                                                  Chronicle.             \"Nay, grieve not that ye can no honour give            To these poor bones that presently must be           But carrion; since I have sought to live            Upon God's earth, as He hath guided me,           I shall not lack!  Where would ye have me lie?            High heaven is higher than cathedral nave:           Do men paint chancels fairer than the sky?\"            Beside the darkened lake they made his grave,           Below the altar of the hills; and night            Swung incense clouds of mist in creeping lines           That twisted through the tree-trunks, where the light            Groped through the arches of the silent pines:           And he, beside the lonely path he trod,           Lay, tombed in splendour, in the House of God.     Eventide              The day is past and the toilers cease;           The land grows dim 'mid the shadows grey,           And hearts are glad, for the dark brings peace                       At the close of day.            Each weary toiler, with lingering pace,           As he homeward turns, with the long day done,           Looks out to the west, with the light on his face                       Of the setting sun.            Yet some see not (with their sin-dimmed eyes)           The promise of rest in the fading light;           But the clouds loom dark in the angry skies                       At the fall of night.            And some see only a golden sky           Where the elms their welcoming arms stretch wide           To the calling rooks, as they homeward fly                       At the eventide.            It speaks of peace that comes after strife,           Of the rest He sends to the hearts He tried,           Of the calm that follows the stormiest life --                       God's eventide.     Upon Watts' Picture \"Sic Transit\"                 _\"What I spent I had; what I saved, I lost; what I gave, I have.\"_             But yesterday the tourney, all the eager joy of life,            The waving of the banners, and the rattle of the spears,           The clash of sword and harness, and the madness of the strife;            To-night begin the silence and the peace of endless years.                      (One sings within.)            But yesterday the glory and the prize,            And best of all, to lay it at her feet,           To find my guerdon in her speaking eyes:            I grudge them not, -- they pass, albeit sweet.            The ring of spears, the winning of the fight,            The careless song, the cup, the love of friends,           The earth in spring -- to live, to feel the light --            'Twas good the while it lasted:  here it ends.            Remain the well-wrought deed in honour done,            The dole for Christ's dear sake, the words that fall           In kindliness upon some outcast one, --            They seemed so little:  now they are my All.     A Song of Comfort                 _\"Sleep, weary ones, while ye may --                    Sleep, oh, sleep!\"_                                         Eugene Field.             Thro' May time blossoms, with whisper low,           The soft wind sang to the dead below:            \"Think not with regret on the Springtime's song            And the task ye left while your hands were strong.            The song would have ceased when the Spring was past,            And the task that was joyous be weary at last.\"            To the winter sky when the nights were long           The tree-tops tossed with a ceaseless song:            \"Do ye think with regret on the sunny days            And the path ye left, with its untrod ways?            The sun might sink in a storm cloud's frown            And the path grow rough when the night came down.\"            In the grey twilight of the autumn eves,           It sighed as it sang through the dying leaves:            \"Ye think with regret that the world was bright,            That your path was short and your task was light;            The path, though short, was perhaps the best            And the toil was sweet, that it led to rest.\"     The Pilgrims              An uphill path, sun-gleams between the showers,            Where every beam that broke the leaden sky           Lit other hills with fairer ways than ours;            Some clustered graves where half our memories lie;           And one grim Shadow creeping ever nigh:                       And this was Life.            Wherein we did another's burden seek,            The tired feet we helped upon the road,           The hand we gave the weary and the weak,            The miles we lightened one another's load,           When, faint to falling, onward yet we strode:                       This too was Life.            Till, at the upland, as we turned to go            Amid fair meadows, dusky in the night,           The mists fell back upon the road below;            Broke on our tired eyes the western light;           The very graves were for a moment bright:                       And this was Death.     The Shadow of the Cross              At the drowsy dusk when the shadows creep           From the golden west, where the sunbeams sleep,            An angel mused:  \"Is there good or ill           In the mad world's heart, since on Calvary's hill            'Round the cross a mid-day twilight fell           That darkened earth and o'ershadowed hell?\"            Through the streets of a city the angel sped;           Like an open scroll men's hearts he read.            In a monarch's ear his courtiers lied           And humble faces hid hearts of pride.            Men's hate waxed hot, and their hearts grew cold,           As they haggled and fought for the lust of gold.            Despairing, he cried, \"After all these years           Is there naught but hatred and strife and tears?\"            He found two waifs in an attic bare;           -- A single crust was their meagre fare --            One strove to quiet the other's cries,           And the love-light dawned in her famished eyes            As she kissed the child with a motherly air:           \"I don't need mine, you can have my share.\"            Then the angel knew that the earthly cross           And the sorrow and shame were not wholly loss.            At dawn, when hushed was earth's busy hum           And men looked not for their Christ to come,            From the attic poor to the palace grand,           The King and the beggar went hand in hand.     The Night Cometh              Cometh the night.  The wind falls low,           The trees swing slowly to and fro:            Around the church the headstones grey            Cluster, like children strayed away           But found again, and folded so.            No chiding look doth she bestow:           If she is glad, they cannot know;            If ill or well they spend their day,                       Cometh the night.            Singing or sad, intent they go;           They do not see the shadows grow;            \"There yet is time,\" they lightly say,            \"Before our work aside we lay\";           Their task is but half-done, and lo!                       Cometh the night.     In Due Season              If night should come and find me at my toil,            When all Life's day I had, tho' faintly, wrought,           And shallow furrows, cleft in stony soil            Were all my labour:  Shall I count it naught            If only one poor gleaner, weak of hand,            Shall pick a scanty sheaf where I have sown?           \"Nay, for of thee the Master doth demand            Thy work:  the harvest rests with Him alone.\"      JOHN MCCRAE  An Essay in Character  by Sir Andrew Macphail     I. In Flanders Fields   \"In Flanders Fields\", the piece of verse from which this little book takes its title, first appeared in 'Punch' in the issue of December 8th, 1915. At the time I was living in Flanders at a convent in front of Locre, in shelter of Kemmel Hill, which lies seven miles south and slightly west of Ypres. The piece bore no signature, but it was unmistakably from the hand of John McCrae.  From this convent of women which was the headquarters of the 6th Canadian Field Ambulance, I wrote to John McCrae, who was then at Boulogne, accusing him of the authorship, and furnished him with evidence.
