I have dwelt at the above length upon the red bill of the female of both _minor_ and _palmerstoni_ because it is a character that I have seen but little mentioned, and because I feel morally certain that the American bird--_Fregata magnificans_ Mathews according to Rothschild, _F. minor rothschildi_ Mathews according to Mathews--does not show it. We have a very large series of Frigate birds from America, and among the females none show any trace of reddish or pinkish on the bills, nor do I find the bill of the female described as pink on any label, or for that matter in any text-book.  This being the case, it is a matter of much interest to know what forms have a pink bill in the female, and what do not.   FREGATA ARIEL ARIEL Gray.  Three specimens, from Tawi Tawi Island, two adult males and one adult female all taken 21 August, 1921.  Compared with _Fregata ariel iredalei_ Mathews of the western Indian Ocean these are large birds with heavy bills, and appear wholly referable to true _ariel_ of Australia etc.  MEASUREMENTS.

One immature example (sex not determined) was shot by Mrs. Robb White at Sagada, Bontoc, northern Luzon in July 1913 and given to Governor Forbes. This, I believe, is the first record for the species in the Philippines. The specimen, M. C. Z. 64,621, affords a wing length of 366 mm.   XANTHOLAEMA HAEMACEPHALA HAEMACEPHALA (Müller).  Two adult males, Mindoro, July. (Also two old skins in M. C. Z. labeled \"Manilla\").  Stuart Baker, (Ibis 1919, p. 219), has already pointed out the strong characters that distinguish the Philippine form of this little Barbet. I include it in these notes merely to emphasize the fact that it must be kept distinct from birds from India, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, etc. Its long bill, dark colors, and heavily striped under parts at once distinguish it.   XANTHOLAEMA ROSEA INTERMEDIA Shelly.  Four adults, both sexes, Negros, July.  This is another strongly marked representative form, peculiar to the Philippines. It differs from _X. rosea rosea_ (Dumont) of Java etc. in its very much larger bill (averaging 22 mm. as against 16 mm. in true _rosea_), slightly larger size, darker colors, and much more heavily striped under parts.   LALAGE NIGER MITIFICA, subsp. nov.  Twelve specimens, both sexes, Lubang near Luzon, Mindanao, Palawan, Camiguin, Camotes, Basilan, Panay, Mindoro, and Cagayan de Sulu, June, July, and August.  TYPE.--M. C. Z. 64,329 adult [Male], Lubang, near Luzon, 6 July, 1913. W. Cameron Forbes.  CHARACTERS.--Similar to _L. niger niger_ (Forster), (type-locality \"in India Orientali\" which I will farther restrict to Singapore, being as likely as anywhere else to have been whence the type actually came), but larger; in color the adult [Male] differing in the sheen of the head and back being darker and more purplish, less greenish; the rump slightly darker gray and the tibia grayer, less whitish. The adult [Female] decidedly grayer less brownish above--deep neutral gray (the upper parts in _L. nigra nigra_ are hair-brown to Chaetura drab).  REMARKS.--Birds from Java are small and appear to be quite like those from Singapore and the southern Malay peninsula. The Borneo bird is a little larger and the one female before me is gray above as in the Philippine form.

The series shows no individual variation, and no tendency to ever become dusky or black above.   ORTHOTOMUS RUFICEPS NUNTIUS, subsp. nov.  Three specimens from the Sulu Archipelago; an adult [Male] Sibutu, 23 August, an adult [Male] Cagayan de Sulu, 2 July, and an immature [Female] Jolo, 2 August.  TYPE.--M. C. Z. 57,529 adult [Male], Cagayan de Sulu, 2 July, 1911. W. Cameron Forbes.

M., three skins from Sibutu similar in all respects to ours.  Birds from Palawan and Clulion Islands are somewhat smaller than those from Sulu, but agree in color more nearly with them, than they do with true _ruficeps_ of Borneo.   ZOSTEROPS FORBESI, sp. nov.  Two adult males from Camiguin Island, 2 August, 1921.  TYPE.--M. C. Z. 86,369 adult [Male], Camiguin Island, 2 August, 1921. W. Cameron Forbes.

In the Philippines this group is represented by:  1. _Zosterops siquijorensis_ Bourns & Worcester. Negros, Siquijor.  2. _Zosterops boholensis_ McGregor. Bohol.  3. _Zosterops everettii_ Tweeddale. Cebu.  4. _Zosterops forbesi_ Bangs. Camiguin.  5. _Zosterops basilanica_ Steere. Basilan, Bongao, Dinagat, Leyte, Mindanao, Papahag, Samar, Jolo, Tawi Tawi.  I have given the new form, which is named in honour of Governor W. Cameron Forbes, specific rank because in an enormous genus, largely composed of island forms, like Zosterops, I do not know where to draw the line between species and subspecies and much prefer leaving the question to be decided by some future reviewer of the genus.  _Zosterops meyleri_ McGregor also of Camiguin Island, is a small species with _wholly_ yellow under parts, belonging in a different group of the genus.   ORIOLUS XANTHONOTUS PERSUASUS, subsp. nov.  Four adults, both sexes, Palawan, August.  TYPE.--M. C. Z. 64,180 adult [Male], Puerto Princesa, Palawan Island, 14 August, 1913. W. Cameron Forbes.  CHARACTERS.--Similar to _O. xanthonotus xanthonotus_ Horsfield of Java, but larger with longer tail. Adult [Male] differing in color in much more heavily striped under parts and in the black of chest extending farther backward to include the upper breast; and much less sharply defined posteriorly against the white under parts; back more greenish yellow; yellow spot on outer tail feather large.

The Palawan representative form is strongly marked and easily to be distinguished from _O. x. xanthonotus_ of Java.  The bird of Borneo may represent still another form, distinguished from true _xanthonotus_ by slightly smaller size, the under parts less purely white, that is, much more suffused with yellowish or yellowish ochraceous, sometimes even with grayish and with the yellow tail-spots larger. This form probably should be known as _Oriolus xanthonotus consobrinus_ Wardlaw-Ramsay (P. Z. S., 1879, p. 709, N. E. Borneo). Everett, however, (Birds of Borneo 1889, p. 119), in mentioning the type states that \"It is dissimilar from all known immature individuals of _O. xanthonotus_ and belongs rather to the _O. steerii_ group.\" If this is true and there is in north Borneo a form of the Philippine group of Orioles, with the sexes alike in plumage and with the throat and chest plain gray, then the form of the Black-headed Oriole of Borneo, if recognized, should be named.  In old females from Java the pileum and cheeks are dark mouse-gray, blackish on the forehead, the black streaks narrow, almost obsolete and noticeable on the crown and occiput only. Females from the mainland and Borneo and Sumatra also, when adult, have faint blackish streaks on the crown. In immature plumage the head is wholly unstreaked, which I doubt to be the case in the Palawan form.
