Menie thought he'd better laugh, too. He had just let go of his nose to begin when all of a sudden the little dogs stopped barking and stood very still!  Their hair stood up on their necks and they began to growl!  \"Hark, the dogs see something,\" said Menie.  Monnie and Koko stopped laughing and listened. They could not hear anything. They could not see anything. Still Nip and Tup growled. The twins and Koko were children of brave hunters, so, although they were scared, they crept very quietly to the side of the Big Rock and peeped over.  Just that minute there was a dreadful growl! \"Woof!\" It was very loud, and very near, and down on the beach a shadow was moving! It was the shadow of a great white BEAR!  He was looking for fish and was cross because everything was frozen, and he could not find any on the beach.  The moment they saw him, the twins and Koko turned and ran for home as fast as ever their short legs could go! They did not even stop to get the precious sled. They just ran and ran.  Nip and Tup ran, too, with their ears back and their little tails stuck straight out behind them!  If they had looked back, they would have seen the bear stand up on his hind legs and look after them, then get down on all fours and start toward the Big Rock on a run.  But neither the children nor the little dogs looked back! They just ran with all their might until they reached the twins' igloo. Then they all dived into the tunnel like frightened rabbits.   V.  When they came up in the one little room of the igloo at the other end of the tunnel Kesshoo and Koolee were just crawling out of the warm fur covers of their bed. Menie and Monnie and Koko and the little dogs all began to talk at once.  The moment the twins' father and mother heard the word--bear--they jumped off the sleeping-bench and began to put on their clothes.  They both wore fur trousers and long kamiks, with coats of fur, so they looked almost as much alike in their clothes as the twins did in theirs.  The mother always wore her hair in a topknot on top of her head, tied with a leather thong. But now she wanted to make the bear think she was a man, too, so she pulled it down and let it hang about her face, just as her husband did.  In two minutes they were ready. Then the father reached for his lance, the mother took her knife, and they all crawled out of the tunnel.  The father went first, then the mother, then the three children and the pups. At the opening of the tunnel the father stopped, and looked all around to see if the bear were near.  The dogs in the village knew by this time that some strange animal was about, and the moment Kesshoo came out into the moonlight and started for the Big Rock, all the dogs ran, too, howling like a pack of wolves.  Kesshoo shouted back to his wife, \"There really is a bear! I see him by the Big Rock; call the others.\"  So she sent Monnie into the igloo of the Angakok, and Menie and Koko into the next huts. She herself screamed, \"A bear! A bear!\" into the tunnel of Koko's hut.  The people in the houses had heard the dogs bark and were already awake. Soon they came pouring out of their tunnels armed with knives and lances. The women had all let down their hair, just as the twins' mother did. Each one carried her knife.  They all ran toward the Big Rock, too. Far ahead they could see the bear, and the dogs bounding along, and Kesshoo running with his lance in his hand.  Then they saw the dogs spring upon the bear. The bear stood up on his hind legs and tried to catch the dogs and crush them in his arms. But the dogs were too nimble. The bear could not catch them.  When Kesshoo came near, the bear gave a great roar, and started for him. The brave Kesshoo stood still with his lance in his hand, until the bear got quite near. Then he ran at the bear and plunged the lance into his side. The lance pierced the bear's heart. He groaned, fell to the ground, rolled over, and was still.  Then how everybody ran! Koko's mother had her baby in her hood, where Eskimo mothers always carry their babies. She could not run so fast as the others. The Angakok was fat, so he could not keep up, but he waddled along as fast as he could.  \"Hurry, hurry,\" he called to his wives. \"Bespeak one of his hind legs for me.\"  Menie and Monnie and Koko had such short legs they could not go very fast either, so they ran along with the Angakok, and Koko's mother, and Nip and Tup.  When they reached the bear they found all the other people crowded around it. Each one stuck his fingers in the bear's blood and then sucked his fingers. This was because they wanted all bears to know how they longed to kill them. As each one tasted the blood he called out the part of the bear he would like to have.  The wives of the Angakok cried, \"Give a hind leg to the Angakok.\"  \"The kidneys for Koko,\" cried Koko's mother when she stuck in her finger. \"That will make him a great bear-hunter when he is big.\"  \"And I will have the skin for the twins' bed,\" said their mother.  Kesshoo promised each one the part he asked for. An Eskimo never keeps the game he kills for himself alone. Every one in the village has a share.  The bear was very large. He was so large that though all the women pulled together they could not drag the body back to the village. The men laughed at them, but they did not help them.  So Koolee ran back for their sledge and harnesses for the dogs. Koko and Menie helped her catch the dogs and hitch them to the sledge.  It took some time to catch them for the dogs did not want to work. They all ran away, and Tooky, the leader of the team, pretended to be sick! Tooky was the mother of Nip and Tup, and she was a very clever dog. While Koolee and Koko and Menie were getting the sledge and dog-team ready, the rest of the women set to work with their queer crooked knives to take off the bear's skin. The moon set, and the sky was red with the colors of the dawn before this was done.  At last the meat was cut in pieces and Kesshoo and Koko's father held the dogs while the women heaped it on the sledge. The dogs wanted the meat. They jumped and howled and tried to get away.  When everything was ready, Koolee cracked the whip at the dogs. Tooky ran ahead to her place as leader, the other dogs began to pull, and the whole procession started back to the village, leaving a great red stain on the clean white snow where the bear had been killed.  Last of all came the twins and Koko. They had loaded the bear's skin on Menie's sled.  \"It's a woman's work to pull the meat home. We men just do the hunting and fishing,\" Menie said to Koko. They had heard the men say that.  \"Yes, we found the bear,\" Koko answered. \"Monnie can pull the skin home.\"  And though Monnie had found the bear just as much as they had, she didn't say a word. She just pulled away on the sled, and they all reached the igloo together just as the round red sun came up out of the sea, and threw long blue shadows far across the fields of snow.     II.  KOOLEE DIVIDES THE MEAT  KOOLEE DIVIDES THE MEAT  I.   The first thing that was done after they got the sledge back to the village was to feed the dogs. The dogs were very hungry; they had smelled the fresh meat for a long time without so much as a bite of it, and they had had nothing to eat for two whole days. They jumped about and howled again and got their harnesses dreadfully tangled.  Kesshoo unharnessed them and gave them some bones, and while they were crunching them and quarreling among themselves, Koolee crawled into the igloo and brought out a bowl. The bowl was made of a hollowed-out stone, and it had water in it.  \"This is for a charm,\" said Koolee. \"If you each take a sip of water from this bowl my son will always have good luck in spying bears!\"  She passed the bowl around, and each person took a sip of the water. When Menie's turn came he took a big, big mouthful, because he wanted to be very brave, indeed, and find a bear every week. But he was in too much of a hurry. The water went down his \"Sunday-throat\" and choked him! He coughed and strangled and his face grew red. Koolee thumped him on the back.  \"That's a poor beginning for a great bear-hunter,\" she said.  Everybody laughed at Menie. Menie hated to be laughed at. He went away and found Nip and Tup. They wouldn't laugh at him, he knew. He thought he liked dogs better than people anyway.  Nip and Tup were trying to get their noses into the circle with the other dogs, but the big dogs snapped at them and drove them away, so Menie got some scraps and fed them.  Meanwhile Koolee stood by the sledge and divided the meat among her neighbors. First she gave one of the hind legs to the wives of the Angakok, because he always had to have the best of everything. She gave the kidneys to Koko's mother. To each one she gave just the part she had asked for. When each woman had been given her share, Kesshoo took what was left and put it on the storehouse.  The storehouse wasn't really a house at all. It was just a great stone platform standing up on legs, like a giant's table. The meat was placed on the top of it, so the dogs could not reach it, no matter how high they jumped.   II.  When the rest of the meat was taken care of, Koolee took the bear's head and carried it into the igloo.  All the people followed her. Then Koolee did a queer thing. She placed the head on a bench, with the nose pointing toward the Big Rock, because the bear had come from that direction. Then she stopped up the nostrils with moss and grease. She greased the bear's mouth, too.  \"Bears like grease,\" she said. \"And if I stop up his nose like that bears will never be able to smell anything. Then the hunters can get near and kill them before they know it.\" You see Koolee was a great believer in signs and in magic. All the other people were too.  She called to the twins, \"C"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3774"],["title","The Eskimo Twins (#2)"],["body","here, Menie and Monnie.\"  The twins had come in with the others, but they were so short they were out of sight in the crowd. They crawled under the elbows of the grown people and stood beside Koolee.  \"Look, children,\" she said to them, \"your grandfather, who is dead, sent you this bear. He wants you to send him something. In five days the bear's spirit will go to the land where your grandfather's spirit lives. What would you like to have the bear's spirit take to your grandfather for a gift?\"  \"I'll send him the little fish that father carved for me out of bone,\" said Menie. He squirmed through the crowd and got it from a corner of his bed and brought it to his mother. She put it on the bear's head.  Monnie gave her a leather string with a lucky stone tied to it. Koolee put that on the bear's head too.  Then she said, \"There! In five days' time the bear's spirit will give the shadows of these things to your grandfather. Then we can eat the head, but not until we are sure the bear's spirit has reached the home of the Dead.\"  \"That is well,\" the Angakok said to the twins, when Koolee had finished. \"Your grandfather will be pleased with your presents, I know. Your grandfather was a just man. I knew him well. He always paid great respect to me. Whenever he brought a bear home he gave me not only a hind leg, but the liver as well! I should not be surprised if he sent the bear this way, knowing how fond I am of bear's liver.\"  The Angakok placed his hand on his stomach and rolled up his eyes. \"But times are not what they once were,\" he went on. \"People care now only for their own stomachs! They would rather have the liver themselves than give it to the Angakok! They will be sorry when it is too late.\"  He shook his head and heaved a great sigh. Koolee looked at Kesshoo. She was very anxious. Kesshoo went out at once to the storehouse. He climbed to the top and got the liver.  By this time all the people had crawled out of the igloo again, and were ready to carry home their meat. Kesshoo ran to the Angakok and gave him the bear's liver. The Angakok handed it to one of his wives to carry. The other one already had the bear's leg. He said to Kesshoo, \"You are a just man, like your father. I know the secrets of the sun, moon, and stars. You know your duty! You shall have your reward.\" He looked very solemn and waddled away toward his igloo with the two wives behind him carrying the meat. All the rest of the people followed after him and went into their own igloos.     III.  THE TWINS GO FISHING  THE TWINS GO FISHING  I.   When the people had all gone away, Menie and Monnie sat down on the side of the sledge. Nip and Tup were busy burying bones in the snow. The other dogs had eaten all they wanted to and were now lying down asleep in the sun, with their noses on their paws.  Everything was still and cold. It was so still you could almost hear the silence, and so bright that the twins had to squint their eyes. In the air there was a faint smell of cooking meat.  Menie sniffed. \"I'm so hungry I could eat my boots,\" he said.  \"There are better things to eat than boots,\" Monnie answered. \"What would you like best of everything in the world if you could have it?\"  \"A nice piece of blubber from a walrus or some reindeer tallow,\" said Menie.  \"Oh, no,\" Monnie cried. \"That isn't half as good as reindeer's stomach, or fishes' eyes! Um-m how I love fishes' eyes! I tell you, Menie, let's get something to eat and then go fishing, before the sun goes down!\"  \"All right,\" said Menie. \"Let's see if Mother won't give us a piece of bear's fat! That is almost as good as blubber or fishes' eyes.\"   II.  They dived into the igloo. Their mother was standing beside the oil lamp, putting strands of dried moss into the oil. This lamp was their only stove and their only light. It didn't look much like our stoves. It was just a piece of soapstone, shaped something like a clamshell. It was hollowed out so it would hold the oil. All along the shallow side of the pan there were little tendrils of dried moss, like threads. These were the wicks.  Over the fire pan there was a rack, and from the rack a stone pan hung down over the lamp flame. It was tied by leather thongs to the rack. In the pan a piece of bear's meat was simmering. The fire was not big enough to cook it very well, but there was a little steam rising from it, and it made a very good smell for hungry noses.  \"We're hungry enough to eat our boots,\" Menie said to his mother.  \"You must never eat your boots; you have but one pair!\" his mother answered. She pinched Menie's cheek and laughed at him.  Then she cut two chunks of fat from a piece of bear's meat which lay on the bench. She gave one to each of the twins. \"Eat this, and soon you can have some cooked meat,\" she said. \"It isn't quite done yet.\"  \"We don't want to wait for the cooked meat,\" cried Monnie. \"We want to go fishing before the sun is gone. Give us more fat and we'll eat it outside.\"  \"You may go fishing if your father will go with you and cut holes for you in the ice,\" said her mother.  Koolee cut off two more pieces of fat. The twins took a piece in each hand. Then their mother reached down their own little fishing rods, which were stuck in the walls of the igloo. The twins had bear's meat in both hands. They didn't see how they could manage the fishing rods too.  But Menie thought of a way. \"I'll show you how,\" he said to Monnie. He held one chunk of meat in his teeth! In his left hand he held the fishing rod, in his right he carried the other piece of meat!  Monnie did exactly what Menie did, and then they crawled down into the tunnel.   III.  The twins had some trouble getting out of the tunnel because both their hands were full. And besides the fishing rods kept getting between their legs. When they got outside they both took great bites of the bear's fat.  Kesshoo was hanging the dogs' harnesses up on a tall pole, where the dogs could not get them. The pole was eight feet long, and it was made of the tusk of a narwhal. The harnesses were made of walrus thongs and the dogs would eat them if they had a chance. That was the reason Kesshoo hung them out of reach. The twins ran to their father at once. They began to tell him that they wanted to go fishing right away before the sun went down but their mouths were so full they couldn't get the words out!  \"Mm-m-m-m,\" Menie began, chewing with all his might!  Then Monnie did a shocking thing! She swallowed her meat whole, she was in such hurry! It made a great lump going down her throat! It almost choked her. But she shut her eyes, jerked her head forward, and got it down!  \"Will you make two holes in the ice for us to fish through?\" she said. She got the words out first! Then she took another bite of meat.  \"Have you got your lines ready, and anything for bait?\" asked their father.  By this time Menie had swallowed his mouthful too. He said, \"We can take a piece of bear's meat for bait. The lines and hooks are ready.\"  Kesshoo looked at the lines. The rods were very short. They were made of driftwood with a piece of bone bound to the end by tough thongs.  There was a hole in the end of the bone, and through this hole the line was threaded. The line was made of braided reindeer thongs. On the end of the line was a hook carved out of bone.  \"Your lines are all right,\" said Kesshoo. \"Come along.\"  He led the way down to the beach. The twins came tumbling after him, and I am sorry to tell you they gobbled their meat all the way! After the twins came Nip and Tup. The ice was very thick. Kesshoo and the twins and the pups walked out on it quite a distance from the shore.  Kesshoo cut two round holes in the ice. One was for Menie and one for Monnie. The holes were not big enough for them to fall into.  By this time the twins had eaten all their meat except some small pieces which they saved for bait. They each put a piece of meat on the hook. Then they squatted down on their heels and dropped the hooks into the holes.  Kesshoo went back to the village, and left them there. \"Don't stay out too long,\" he called back to them.   IV.  The twins sat perfectly still for a long time. Nip sat beside Menie, and Tup sat beside Monnie. It grew colder and colder. The sun began to drop down toward the sea again. At last it rested like a great round red wheel right on the Edge of the World!  Slowly, slowly it sank until only a little bit of the red rim showed; then that too was gone. Great splashes of red color came up in the sky over the place where it had been.  Still the twins sat patiently by their holes. It grew darker and darker. The colors faded. The stars began to twinkle, but the twins did not move. Nip and Tup ran races on the ice, and rolled over each other and barked.  At last--all of a sudden--there was a fearful jerk on Monnie's line! It took her by surprise. The little rod flew right out of her hands! Monnie flung herself on her stomach on the ice and caught the rod just as it was going down the hole! She held on hard and pulled like everything.  \"I believe I've caught a whale,\" she panted.  But she never let go! She got herself right side up on the ice, somehow, and pulled and pulled on her line.  \"Let me pull him in!\" cried Menie. He tried to take her rod.  \"Get away,\" screamed Monnie. \"I'll pull in my own fish.\"  Menie danced up and down with excitement, still holding his own rod. The pups danced and barked too. Monnie never looked at any of them. She kept her eyes fixed on the hole and pulled.  At last she shrieked, \"I've got him, I've got him!\" And up through the hole came a great big codfish!  My! how he did flop around on the ice! Nip and Tup were scared. They ran for home at the first flop.  \"Let's go home now,\" said Monnie. \"I want to show my fine big fish to Mother.\"  But Menie said, \"Wait a little longer till I catch one! I'll give you one eye out of my fish if you will.\"  Monnie waited. She put another piece of meat on her hook and dropped it again into the hole."]]]
