In days of unclouded prosperity other gods called forth our devotion and enthusiasm, but the God of our Fathers who made us a great nation and sent us to sow the seeds of righteousness beside all waters, bestowing upon us empire and might, was well-nigh forgotten.  For the new man \"words like Empire, Patriotism, Duty, Honour, Glory and God\" had little or no meaning.  Causes for which the fathers died could not evoke an added heart-beat from their sons.  They cared so little for the mighty empire which they inherited that they contemplated the bloodshed of civil war--so hot was their zeal for party and so cold their love for the state.  It was necessary that discipline should come.  And that discipline came, shaking the very foundations of our national life.  Its first fruit is that the smouldering fires of patriotism have broken forth once more into bright flame; and that everywhere the hearts of the people have been stirred by the call to arise and endure hardness that the goodly heritage of empire perish not.  And preachers in a thousand pulpits have sounded the trumpet-note of duty and of patriotism.  ***  It has been said that preachers should aim at making the churches sanctuaries of peace, within whose walls the echoes of the guns and the cries of the perishing should not penetrate.  Some have even said that Christianity, so far from fostering the spirit of patriotism, is in reality hostile to it.  \"Patriotism itself as a duty,\" says Lecky, \"has never found any place in Christian ethics, and strong theological feeling has usually been directly hostile to its growth.\"  No doubt there is something to be said for that view.  The attitude of the early Christians towards the Roman Empire was not that of patriotism.  The clear shining of the heavenly Jerusalem so dazzled their eyes that this world, and the temporal empire occupying its stage, seemed but as a shadow.  Their devotion to the Unseen King left little room for loyalty to the earthly ruler.  In the glorious consciousness of his citizenship in heaven, it was a small thing in the estimation of St. Paul that he was also a Roman citizen--but he did not forget it.  But when the earthly ruler persecuted, and burnt, and threw the Christians to the lions, or slaughtered them to make a Roman holiday, then the poor victims cannot be blamed for not being patriots.  And the Church in the mediæval period, organised in the mighty hierarchy of Rome, did not tend to foster a national spirit of patriotism.  In those days when the Emperor Theodosius made penance in the Cathedral of Milan and Ambrose declared that \"the Church is not in the empire, but the Emperor in the Church\"; or in those later days when Hildebrand promulgated the doctrine that the temporal power was subject to the spiritual power, and kings and emperors were only vassals of the Church, and Henry V. was left three days standing barefooted in the snow waiting humbly to see the Pope at Canossa--in those days certainly Christianity sought to foster not the sense of national loyalty, but that of devotion towards that holy Catholic and universal Church whose visible head was the Pope.  Christianity placed the Pope on the throne of the Cæsars, and sought to evoke towards him a patriotism which transcended nationality.  But the Reformation gave its death blow to Hildebrandism, and the Pope no longer usurped the temporal Thrones of Europe.  And there came the throb of the awakening spirit of nationality.  The spirit of patriotism stirred once more the slumbering races.  ***  The question whether patriotism is a fruit of Christianity must be answered not by reference to what men did in the name of their religion--for men are fallible--but by the precept and example of the Founder of Christianity.  He was a Jew, and of all races the Jew was the most patriotic.  An exile by the rivers of Babylon, the Israelite refused to forget Zion.  \"If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its cunning\"--that was the cry wherewith his unconquerable soul faced an overwhelming destiny.  And in this respect Jesus Christ was true to His race.  He was a patriot.  He worshipped in the synagogues, and went on pilgrimages to Jerusalem, because He loved the national institutions of His country.  One note of true patriotism is anguish.  It is when love is great that the folly and sin of the person beloved pierce the heart.  The patriotism of the Founder of Christianity expressed itself in a cry of agony which has reverberated through the centuries--\"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.\"  That cry is the measure of His patriotism.  Judged, then, by the example of its Founder, Christianity must produce the spirit of love and loyalty towards one's own country.  There was a patriotism before Christianity, but it was that of arrogance, aggression, and self-glorification.  It was a patriotism which meted out only contempt to other races.  To the Jew the Greek was only a Gentile dog; to the Greek the Jew was only a contemptible Barbarian.  But the patriotism which is animated by the Christian spirit is far other.  It is not the vaunting of pride nor the shouting of vulgar ditties.  It seeks the glory of its own country, but the glory it seeks is the glory of the greater service rendered to humanity.  Conscious of its own defects, it does not condemn others.  With eyes cleansed from prejudice, it beholds the good in other races.  It seeks the first place for its own nation because it acts the noblest, loves the best. All the elements which make up the strong power of patriotism--love of family, love of neighbours, love of race, love of country--Christianity has purified them all.  True patriotism is, then, a fruit of the Christian religion, a virtue which falls to be inculcated by the Church.  If Christianity be the projection of the Christ-life into the midst of every generation, then the life that reflects the beauty of Christ must be a life animated by the deepest love of one's country.  ***  It was Dean Stanley who rendered God thanks in Paisley Abbey for that Scotsmen were \"citizens of an Empire so great, members of a Church so free.\"  In the building up of the Empire Scotsmen have borne a great share of toil and peril.  In other days the fires of patriotism burned brightly.  The cry of our fathers was \"my country right or wrong.\"  But we feel not quite so sure of our country being always in the right. The passion of Christianity is an ethical passion.  Christian patriotism demands national righteousness.  To keep patriotism as an ardent fire we must be convinced that our country stands for righteousness.  And in this day of our ordeal we have this certainty to uphold us, that we are fighting for the right.  It was not in defiance of Christianity, but in its defence, that we drew the sword.  For this war sprang from an unbridled lust of conquest to which a whole nation surrendered itself.  But before surrendering to the passions of war the ideals of Christ were first forsaken by our enemy.  A new law was promulgated: \"Become hard, O my brethren, for we are emancipated and the world belongs to us.\"  New beatitudes were declared: \"Ye have heard how ... it was said, Blessed are the meek ... but I say unto you, Blessed are the valiant, for they shall make the earth their throne ... Ye have read, Blessed are the peacemakers, but I say unto you, Blessed are the war-makers, for they shall be called, if not the children of Jehovah, the children of Odin, who is greater than Jehovah.\"  Out of this new gospel, the gospel of Odin, has sprung a war of extermination--exiled nations, devastated kingdoms, desolated colleges, ruined cathedrals, and multitudes of women and children \"left nothing but their eyes to weep with.\"  The name of God has been invoked over unspeakable barbarities--but the God thus invoked is not the Christian God.  It is Odin in whose name these things are done.  What we are fighting for is for the Christian ideal against Odin--for the law of truth and mercy against the reign of falsehood of word and bond, and of merciless barbarity.  We have bared the breast to death that there may sit on the throne of the world's soul, not a ruthless tribal god, but the God of Fatherhood and Love whom Jesus Christ revealed.  And in waging that war we have ground to hope that the God of righteousness is on our side.  If we have not had the name of God constantly on our lips it is not because we do not feel that we are fighting His battle, but because He is so great, the Lord of Heaven and Earth before whom we are but as dust, that we shrink from coupling His great name with ours.  \"Are you sure that God is on your side?\" Abraham Lincoln was asked in the dark days of the American Civil War.  \"I have not thought about that,\" he replied; \"but I am very anxious to know whether we are on God's side.\" And when the causes of this war are examined the assurance grows stronger and stronger that we are on God's side.  That is why the whole nation has been welded into the unity and consistency of polished steel; why the fire of patriotism burns in our midst with an intenser heat than ever before.  ***  It is not merely from the righteousness of our cause in this war that our patriotism draws inspiration, but also from the ideals for which our Empire stands over all the world.  As we look out to-day on the Empire which our fathers bequeathed us, taking it all in all, it stands for righteousness as no other on earth.  It stands for the freedom of the soul and the freedom of the body all over the world.  Think of India, whose three hundred millions have been rescued from tyranny and ceaseless bloodshed, whose widows have been saved from the flames, whose starving have been "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33642"],["title","Earth Alert!

Morosely Julia finished peeling her apple.         *       *       *       *       *  It was cold in the Hollywood bus depot; chill rain drizzled down from a leaden sky.  She stood in the protection of the building, bag in hand, shivering miserably. Twice she waved futilely for a cab. On the third attempt, she got one.  The driver opened the door for her, and she bolted through the rain to its inviting back seat.  \"Take me to some nice hotel,\" she said.  The driver flipped up the flag and gunned the motor.  Five minutes later she was paying him ninety cents; leaving the extra dime out of the dollar for a tip, she ran for the hotel steps.  After she registered, she asked the fatherly old gentleman at the desk, \"Where does a person go to meet people?\" Water trickled down from her hair and across her face.  He bent forward and narrowed his eyes. \"Meet people?\" he asked; his tone had grown cold and suspicious.  She bit her lip in embarrassment. Did I say something wrong? she thought. \"Never mind,\" she said, wanting to cry. \"I'm not going to stay in this horrible town a minute more than I have to!\"  \"She,\" the bellboy said when he came down stairs, \"is crazy.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"You should have seen her walk through the door.\" He pronounced the last word emphatically.  \"You mean door_way_.\"  \"I mean door,\" the bell boy said. \"It was closed when she done it.\"  \"I'm going to have to keep an eye on her,\" the clerk said, clucking his tongue in dry disapproval.         *       *       *       *       *  Now how did I do that? Julia asked herself. She walked to the door and put her hand through it. She wiggled her fingers. She half-opened the door and put her hand through it again. It came out on the other side. She moved her arm back and forth. It felt prickly.  She crossed to the bed and sat down. This isn't so good, she thought. I've got to figure out how I did that.  She closed her eyes tightly. Other people can't put their hands through doors, she thought. Other people can't heal cuts by looking at them, either.... I never could before; I don't feel any different from other people.  And then a little chill of fear ran up and down her spine. Suppose the bed, the floor, the earth below were suddenly to become as unsubstantial as the door. I might drop clear through to China, to, to....  Her fingernails were making red creases in her palms.  She stood up and stamped on the floor. Her knees trembled. The floor was solid.  She went to the door. It is solid, she thought. She let her fingers explore the surface. She sighed, feeling the rough texture of the wood.  Now, she thought. I can reach through it.  Her hand passed through it easily.  She went back to the bed and sat down.  I did it with my mind, she thought. I wanted to put my hand through the door, and I did. In front of the bell hop, I suddenly felt so sure that I could walk through the door that ... I did.  I'm going to figure out how I did that, she thought, her mouth tightening into a thin little line of resolution. Because if _I_ learned to do it, anyone else could learn....  _Hello._  Her hands clenched into annoyed little fists. She went to the window and looked out. She opened the door and looked up and down the corridor. No William.  _Hello._  \"He ... hello.\"  _Good, you can hear me. What planet are you on?_  \"The same planet everyone else is.\"  _... the third one from the sun?_  She tried to remember her high school science survey course; and she found that she could remember it very clearly. _Of course, it is._  _That's funny._         *       *       *       *       *  She realized that she had thought her last statement, and that he (she was sure that the voice belonged to a he) had answered it nevertheless. She was exchanging thoughts with someone!  _Hello_, she thought weakly. She gulped. _What do you look like? How many arms and legs do you have?_  _Two of each._  Her mind was very alert and active. She could think with great clarity. _Describe yourself._ She received a mental impression of him.  She let out her breath. He was human, after all; as human as anybody. And handsome.  She laughed softly with relief: since he has never been able to find anyone like himself, he thought _I_ was from another planet!  _Eh?_  _Describe yourself again._  He complied.  Suddenly she knew with absolute certainty that this was the one she was looking for. Out of all the people on earth, here was a man made for her.  _Could you put your hand through a wooden door?_  _Of course._  She smiled happily. She meant to have him.  _Hello._  _Hello._  There was silence.  She wrinkled her forehead and tapped her knee. He had ceased transmitting.  He'll be back, she thought with satisfaction. I wonder what size suit he wears? I think I'll buy him a nice wool one. I want my husband to look presentable.  Smiling, she went to the phone. She called her bank and ordered her account transferred to the all-night branch in Los Angeles. She wanted to have her money available so she could leave town to go to him the moment she found out where he lived: or (assuming he came to her) to have it handy so she could leave town with him the moment he proposed to her--even if it were in the middle of the night.  After that, she went to the door and put her hand through it.  I'm going to have to figure this out, she thought. If I figure out how I did it, I'm sure I can teach other people. I'm no different than they are; and I don't intend to be.  She went back to the bed and sat down and began to think.  And she discovered that she could remember the greater part of everything she'd ever read.     CHAPTER IV   Calvin practiced teleportation for endless hours. He kept the metal ball Forential had given him in almost constant motion.  He would exclaim delightedly and hurl it toward one of the twenty-seven other mutants in his compartment. Until the time he hit John in the back of the head with it, his intended victims had always parried it. John lay in a pool of blood, and Calvin began to cry--loud, shrill wails of despair and contrition. When Forential came, he knew instinctively what had happened.  Calvin represented the only failure the aliens had experienced in their mutation program; ten years ago his mind had ceased to develop. But for Forential's intercession, the council would have had him destroyed long ago; Forential, like a proud parent, kept hoping to overcome Calvin's heredity.  Forential waved his tentacles in exasperation. \"You, here, Walt,\" he said. \"We'll have to hurry. I'll show you how, and you can do it.\"  Walt, the most adept mutant in the compartment, listened attentively and then began to heal John. His face wrinkled in deep concentration. Flesh came together; blood ceased to flow; bone knitted. Forential grunted approval.  \"Watch Walt, now,\" the alien instructed. \"He's doing it nicely.\"  The others, breath held, watched.  At length John's head was healed. John stirred. He opened his eyes and looked about angrily. He stood up and hit Calvin in the face with his fist. Calvin, tears streaming down his cheeks, fingered his nose and sobbed brokenly. He put out a hand to touch Walt reassuringly.  Walt was his friend.  Walt--he had no other name--was six feet two inches tall, and, as Julia observed, handsome. His parents--he did not know this--were Americans; he had never seen them. He had been stolen from the hospital by Forential shortly after he was born. The alien, invisible, had come for him, clucked softly, wrapped him in a warm, invisible mantle, and taken him away; and the council of aliens had drawn a line through the names of another set of parents who had been exposed to the powerful, mutation-inducing field. Walt thought of Forential--in charge of their compartment--as a friend, as a parent, as a playmate, and as a counselor.         *       *       *       *       *  Shortly after Walt had healed John, the mutants of the smaller compartment gathered at the observation screen in the floor--or what was to them the floor: it was actually the broad rim of the wheel. They could look down at the screen and see a somewhat flickering image of Earth lying below their feet.  \"Forential told us we'd get many strange powers....\" one said.  _Just before we went down to the planet_, another completed the thought.  _It's growing time, then._  They laughed together with excitement, and Calvin cracked his knuckles nervously.  \"Let's play a trick on Forential,\" Calvin said. \"Let's see if we can go through the bulkhead.\" His face was bright and hopeful. \"Let's huh?\"  Calvin raced to the far end of the compartment. \"Come on!\"  Like guilty children, they looked at one another. Then a few of them joined Calvin. _All right, let's._  \"Don't,\" Walt cautioned. \"It's just machinery on the other side.\"  _Why can't our thoughts penetrate it, then?_  _We aren't developed enough_, Walt thought.  \"Huh?\" Calvin asked. He began pounding the bulkhead with his fist.  \"No,\" one of the other mutants said. \"Like this.\" He concentrated and tried to put a hand through the bulkhead.  _We aren't developed enough._  Still the mutants continued. Since the aliens had stepped up the power in the two transmitters (power that closed the final connection in the mutants' brains and held it closed) the mutants were able to assault any problem with the full potentialities of the human brain. But even that was not enough. The aliens had planned carefully in order to keep the two mutant groups from discovering each other.         *       *       *       *       *  Forential came to make a special announcement. He spoke English with an accent that the mutants (who had learned the language from him) could not even imitate. As he surveyed them, his eyes shone with pride: they were a good, sturdy, healthy lot. \"Children,\" he said. \"Earth is now in the middle of a war. There will be little work left for us within another two months.\"  Calvin cried "]]]
