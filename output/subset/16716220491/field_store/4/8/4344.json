Elder Marks was in sympathy with Sidney Rigdon, but for some reason he refused to make the appointment for Tuesday, but made it for Thursday, the 8th of August. This was a most fortunate circumstance, since a sufficient number of the Twelve to make a majority of that quorum arrived on the evening of the 6th, and, of course, they were in time to be present at the meeting to be held on the 8th. The day previous to that meeting, however, the Twelve called a meeting of the high council and high priests, before which they called on Sidney Rigdon to make a statement of his purposes and relate the revelation he claimed to have received at Pittsburg, which prompted his journey to Nauvoo. In substance he replied that the object of his visit was to offer himself to the saints as a \"Guardian;\" that it had been shown to him in vision at Pittsburg, that the church must be built up to Joseph the martyr; that all the blessings the saints could receive would come through their late prophet; that no man could be a successor to Joseph; that the church was not disorganized, though the head was gone; that he had been commanded to come to Nauvoo and see that the church was governed properly, and propose himself to be a \"Guardian\" to the people.[A]  [Footnote A: Hist. Joseph Smith, _Mill. Star_, Vol. XXV, 215.]  To this Elder Brigham Young replied:      I do not care who leads this Church, even though it were Ann Lee;     but one thing I must know, and that is what God says about it. I     have the keys and the means of obtaining the mind of God on the     subject. . . . Joseph conferred upon our heads all the keys and     powers belonging to the apostleship which he himself held before     he was taken away, and no man nor set of men can get between     Joseph and the Twelve in this world or in the world to come. How     often has Joseph said to the Twelve, I have laid the foundation     and you must build thereon, for upon your shoulders the kingdom     rests.[A]  [Footnote A: History of Joseph Smith, _Mill. Star_, Vol. XXV., 215.]  The next day was the one appointed by Sidney Rigdon for the church to assemble and choose a \"Guardian.\" The attendance was large, as intense interest had been awakened upon the subject to be considered. Sidney Rigdon addressed the assembly, setting forth his claim to the \"Guardianship\" of the church. He had full opportunity to present his case, and for an hour and a half spoke without interruption; but despite his reputation as an orator, he failed to convince the saints that he was sent of God.  As soon as Sidney Rigdon closed his speech, Elder Brigham Young arose and made a few remarks. It was on that occasion that he was transfigured before the people, so that through him the saints heard the voice and felt the presence of their departed leader. George Q. Cannon, who was present on that occasion, says:      If Joseph had risen from the dead and again spoken in their     hearing, the effect could not have been more startling than it was     to many present at that meeting; it was the voice of Joseph     himself; and not only was it the voice of Joseph which was heard,     but it seemed in the eyes of the people as if it were the very     person of Joseph which stood before them. A more wonderful and     miraculous event than was wrought that day in the presence of that     congregation we never heard of.[A]  [Footnote A: Life of Brigham Young (Tullidge) p. 115. Continuing the subject President Cannon says: \"The Lord gave his people a testimony that left no room for doubt as to who was the man chosen to lead them. They both saw and heard with their natural eyes and ears, and then the words which were uttered came, accompanied by the convincing power of God, to their hearts, and they were filled with the Spirit and with great joy. There had been gloom, and in some hearts probably, doubt and uncertainty; but now it was plain to all that here was the man upon whom the Lord had bestowed the necessary authority to act in their midst in Joseph's stead. On that occasion Brigham Young seemed to be transformed, and a change such as that we read of in the Scriptures as happening to the Prophet Elisha, when Elijah was translated in his presence, seemed to have taken place with him. The mantle of the Prophet Joseph had been left for Brigham Young. . . . . The people said one to another: 'The Spirit of Joseph rests on Brigham;' they knew that he was the man chosen to lead them, and they honored him accordingly. . . . . As far as our observation went (we were only a boy at the time), the people were divided into three classes from the time of the death of Joseph up to this meeting of which we speak. One class felt clearly and understandingly that President Brigham Young was the man whose right it was to preside, he being the President of the Twelve Apostles, and that body being, through the death of Joseph and Hyrum, the presiding quorum of the Church. Another class were not quite clear as to who would be called to preside; but they felt very certain that Sidney Rigdon was not the man. They did not believe that God would choose a coward and traitor to lead his people, to both of which characters they believed Rigdon had a claim. The third class, and we think its members were few, was composed of those who had no clear views one way or the other. They were undecided in their feelings. . . . . With very few exceptions, then, the people returned to their homes from that meeting filled with great rejoicing. All uncertainty and anxiety were removed. They had heard the voice of the Shepherd and they knew it.\"]  In the journal of Elder Wm. C. Staines, of that date, the following statement is recorded:      Brigham Young said--\"I will tell you who your leaders or guardians     will be. The Twelve--I at their head!' This was with a voice like     the voice of the prophet Joseph. I thought it was he, and so did     thousands who heard it. This was very satisfactory to the people,     and a vote was taken to sustain the Twelve in their office, which,     with a few dissenting voices, was passed.\"  President Wilford Woodruff, describing the event, says:      When Brigham Young arose and commenced speaking, as has been     said,[A] if I had not seen him with my own eyes, there is no one     that could have convinced me that it was not Joseph Smith; and     anyone can testify to this who was acquainted with these two men.  [Footnote A: The above remark of President Woodruff's is taken from a testimony of his following a discourse on the subject of Priesthood and the Right of Succession, delivered by the writer of this pamphlet.--See _Deseret Evening News_, March 12th, 1892.]  The remarks of Elder Young, during which he was transfigured before the people, closed the forenoon meeting. When in the afternoon the church again assembled and Elder Young addressed them at some length on the subject of appointing a leader for the church, representing the claims of the Twelve as the quorum having the right to act in the absence of the late prophet-president. Following are some quotations from a summary of his speech taken down at the time:      For the first time in my life, for the first time in your lives,     for the first time in the kingdom of God, in the nineteenth     century, without a prophet at our head, do I step forth to act in     my calling in connection with the quorum of the Twelve, as     Apostles of Jesus Christ unto this generation--Apostles whom God     has called by revelation through the prophet Joseph, who are     ordained and anointed to bear off the keys of the kingdom of God     in all the world.      . . . . If any man thinks he has influence among this people, to     lead away a party, let him try it, and he will find out that there     is power with the Apostles, which will carry them off victorious     through all the world, and build up and defend the church and     kingdom of God.      . . . If the people want President Rigdon to lead them, they may     have him; but I say unto you that the quorum of the Twelve have     the keys of the kingdom of God in all the world. The Twelve are     appointed by the finger of God. Here is Brigham, have his knees     ever faltered? have his lips ever quivered? Here is Heber,[A] and     the rest of the Twelve, an independent body, who have the keys of     the priesthood--the keys of the kingdom of God--to deliver to all     the world; this is true, so help me God. They stand next to     Joseph, and are as the First Presidency of the Church.  [Footnote A: Heber C. Kimball.]      . . . . You must not appoint any man at our head; if you should,     the Twelve must ordain him. You cannot appoint a man at our head;     but if you do want any other man or men to lead you, take them,     and we will go our way to build up the kingdom in all the world,      . . . . Brother Joseph, the prophet, has laid the foundation for a     grand work, and we will build upon it; you have never seen the     quorums built one upon another. There is an almighty foundation     laid, and we can build a kingdom such as there never was in the     world: we can build a kingdom faster than Satan can kill the     saints off.      . . . . Now, if you want Sidney Rigdon or Wm. Law[A] to lead you,     or anybody else, you are welcome to them; but I tell you, in the     name of the Lord, that no man can put another between the Twelve     and the prophet Joseph. Why? Because Joseph was their file leader,     and he has committed into their hands the keys of the kingdom in     this last dispensation, for all the world; don't put a thread     between the priesthood and God.[B]  [Footnote A: Wm. Law had been a counselor to the Prophet Joseph, but was found in transgression and apostasy, had been excommunicated, and was among those who brought about the martyrdom at Carthage.]  [Footnote B: _Mill. Star_, Vol. XXV., pp. 216, 231-2, 3.]  Elder Amasa Lyman spoke in support of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35556"],["title","Succession in the Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (#2)"],["body","e; and then Sidney Rigdon was granted the privilege of speaking; he declined personally, but called on Elder W. W. Phelps to speak in his behalf. Elder Phelps while evidently sympathizing with Elder Rigdon, supported the claims of the Twelve. After further discussion Elder Young arose to put the question as to whether the church would sustain the Twelve or Sidney Rigdon:      I do not ask you to take my counsel or advice alone, but every one     of you act for yourselves; but if Brother Rigdon is the person you     want to lead you, vote for him, but not unless you intend to     follow him and support him as you did Joseph. . . . . And I would     say the same for the Twelve, don't make a covenant to support them     unless you intend to abide by their counsel. . . . . . I want     every man, before he enters into a covenant, to know what he is     going to do; but we want to know if this people will support the     priesthood in the name of Israel's God. If you say you will, do     so.[A]  [Footnote A: _Mill. Star_, Vol. XXV,. p. 264.]  Elder Young was then about to put the question to the assembled quorums as to whether they wanted Elder Rigdon for a leader, when, at the request of the latter, the question on supporting the Twelve as the presiding quorum in the church was first put in the following manner:      \"Do the Church want and is it their only desire to sustain the     Twelve as the First Presidency of this people? . . . . . If the     Church want the Twelve to stand as the head, the First Presidency     of the Church, and at the head of this kingdom in all the world,     stand next to Joseph, walk up into their calling, and hold the     keys of this kingdom--every man, every woman, every quorum is now     put in order, and you are now the sole controllers of it--all that     are in favor of this in all the congregation of the Saints,     manifest it by holding up the right hand. (There was a universal     vote.) If there are any of the contrary mind--every man and every     woman who does not want the Twelve to preside, lift up your hands     in like manner. (No hands up.) This supersedes the other     question,[A] and trying it by quorums.\"[B]  [Footnote A: That is, whether the church wanted to have Sidney Rigdon for a \"guardian\" or leader.]  [Footnote B: The quorums had been arranged to vote separately and in their order, but when Elder Young put the question on accepting the Twelve to preside over the church, the question was put to all the quorums and the whole congregation at once. And since the vote to sustain the Twelve was unanimous, there was no need of putting the question on the acceptance of Sidney Rigdon either to the quorums or the people.--The facts in the text are quoted from the history of the prophet Joseph, _Mill. Star_, Vol. XXV., p. 264.]  This disposed of Sidney Rigdon. He had full opportunity to present his case before the church. The saints had full opportunity and liberty to vote for him had they wanted him for their leader; but they rejected him and sustained the Twelve.  I have been careful to deal with this case of Sidney Rigdon's in so great detail, for the reason that it exhibits in operation a very important principle, viz., that of \"common consent\" or the \"voice of the people\" in electing their leaders. I use the word \"elect\" advisedly, for though the manner of electing the officers of the church is by indirect means--by popular acceptance--the elective principle is nevertheless operative, since men proposed for office cannot act unless the people vote to sustain them.[A] The law of the church in this matter is:  [Footnote A: The elective principle is not only carried out by direct means, it may be carried on by indirect means--it is just as much a fact under the form of popular acceptance as of popular choice.--_Cuizot_.]      No person is to be ordained to any office in this Church, where     there is a regularly organized branch of the same, without the     vote of that Church.[A]  [Footnote A: Doc. and Cov., sec. xx, 65.]  This law applies to the First Presidency as well as to the humblest officer in the church:      Of the Melchisedek Priesthood, three presiding High Priests,     chosen by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and     upheld by the confidence, faith and prayer of the Church, from a     quorum of the Presidency of the Church.[A]  [Footnote A: Doc. and Cov. sec. cvii, 22.]  It is not enough that the men constituting the First Presidency of the church be \"appointed and ordained to that office;\" they must also be \"chosen by the body\" and \"upheld by the confidence, faith and prayer of the church.\" President Brigham Young on this subject says:      Joseph presided over the Church by the voice of the people. . . .     Does a man's being a Prophet in this Church prove that he shall be     the President of it? I answer, no. A man may be a prophet, seer     and revelator, and it may have nothing to do with his being     President of the Church. Suffice it to say that Joseph was the     President of the Church, so long as he lived. The people chose to     have it so. He always filled that responsible station by the voice     of the people. . . . . The keys of the priesthood were committed     to Joseph to build up the kingdom of God on the earth, and were     not to be taken from him in time or in eternity; but when he was     called to preside over the Church, it was by the voice of the     people, though he held the keys of the priesthood independent of     their voice.[A]  [Footnote A: Journal of Discourses, Vol. I, p. 133.]  But, mark you, he did not hold the power to preside over them contrary to their voices, that is, contrary to their consent. President Taylor says:      It is by the voice of God and the voice of the people that our     present President [Brigham Young] obtained his authority. He     obtained his authority first from God, and secondly from the     people; and if a man possesses five grains of common sense, when     he has the privilege of voting for or against a man, he will not     vote for a man who will oppress the people; he will vote according     to the dictates of his conscience; for this is the right and duty     of this people in the choice of their President and other leading     officers of the kingdom of God.[A]  [Footnote A: Journal of Discourses, Vol. I, p. 229.]  Thus in ecclesiastical as in civil government it is true that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. We shall have occasion in the course of our argument, to recur to this principle and its importance in respect to the subject treated in this writing.  It may be interesting to the reader to know that Sidney Rigdon himself outwardly seemed to acquiesce in the decision of the church with regard to himself. The Sunday following the meeting above described he addressed the saints for a long time, blessed them in the name of the Lord; telling them emphatically that he was with the Twelve. He wished to know the mind of the church in relation to his returning to Pittsburg, they said, \"go in peace.\"[A] Yet all the while he was thus seemingly accepting the decision of the church and seeking its counsel, secretly he was holding meetings with men of questionable integrity in the church, telling them that it was revealed to him before leaving Pittsburg that the church would reject him; but, nevertheless, he was the proper person to lead the church--to be its Guardian; for to that position he had been called of God, and held keys of authority higher than any ever conferred upon the Prophet Joseph--the keys of David which, according to his representations, gave him the power to open and no man could shut; to shut and no man could open; and the power to organize armies for the destruction of the Gentiles. In fact his fervid imagination pictured himself a great military chieftain, by whose prowess all the enemies of God were to be subdued. He secretly ordained men to be prophets, priests and kings to the Gentiles. He also chose and appointed military officers to take command of the armies that were to be raised ere long to fight the battles of the great God. Meantime, while he in public had spoken of the virtues and honor of the martyred prophets, Joseph and Hyrum, in the highest terms, in his secret meetings he began to cast reflections upon their conduct, and hint at the existence of grave iniquity among the Twelve and in the church.  [Footnote A: Pamphlet on Sidney Rigdon, by Elder J. M. Grant, p. 18.]  As soon as the Twelve learned of these proceedings on the part of Elder Rigdon, they called upon him to explain by what authority he held secret meetings and ordained men to the aforesaid offices. He sought to evade the question, but finding that he was dealing with men not to be trifled with he at last confessed to both holding the meetings and ordaining the officers. His brethren sought to convince him of his error, but at this point he refused to be corrected. The quorum of the Twelve, with the presiding bishop of the church, held a council meeting to consider his conduct, and concluded to demand Elder Rigdon's license. He refused to surrender it, saying that he had not received it from the Twelve and he would not give it up to them. He was then cited before the council of the church which has a right to try a president of the high priesthood, viz., the presiding bishop of the church assisted by twelve high priests.[A]  [Footnote A: And inasmuch as a president of the high priesthood shall transgress, he shall be had in remembrance before the common council of the church, who shall be assisted by twelve counselors of the high priesthood; and their decision upon his head shall be an end of controversy concerning him.--Doc. and Cov., sec. cvii, 82, 83.]  He refused to appear before this council, and therefore, after giving him due notice and an opportunity to appear and defend himself, the council convened in the presence of a"]]]
