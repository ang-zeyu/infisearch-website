[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32346"],["title","Keep Your Shape (#1)"],["body",". A better way.  Over the centuries, the Grom scientists had developed the Displacer. A triumph of Identity Engineering, the Displacer allowed mass to be moved instantaneously between any two linked points.  One end was set up at Grom's sole atomic energy plant. The other end had to be placed in proximity to another atomic power source, and activated. Diverted power then flowed through both ends, was modified, and modified again.  Then, through the miracle of Identity Engineering, the Grom could _step_ through from planet to planet; or pour through in a great, overwhelming wave.  It was quite simple.  But twenty expeditions had failed to set up the Earth-end Displacer.  What had happened to them was not known.  For no Grom ship had ever returned to tell.         *       *       *       *       *  Before dawn they crept through the woods, taking on the coloration of the plants around them. Their Displacers pulsed feebly, sensing the nearness of atomic energy.  A tiny, four-legged creature darted in front of them. Instantly, Ger grew four legs and a long, streamlined body and gave chase.  \"Ger! Come back here!\" Pid howled at the Detector, throwing caution to the winds.  Ger overtook the animal and knocked it down. He tried to bite it, but he had neglected to grow teeth. The animal jumped free, and vanished into the underbrush. Ger thrust out a set of teeth and bunched his muscles for another leap.  \"_Ger!_\"  Reluctantly, the Detector turned away. He loped silently back to Pid.  \"I was hungry,\" he said.  \"You were not,\" Pid said sternly.  \"Was,\" Ger mumbled, writhing with embarrassment.  Pid remembered what the Chief had told him. Ger certainly did have Hunter tendencies. He would have to watch him more closely.  \"We'll have no more of that,\" Pid said. \"Remember--the lure of Exotic Shapes is not sanctioned. Be content with the shape you were born to.\"  Ger nodded, and melted back into the underbrush. They moved on.  At the extreme edge of the woods they could observe the atomic energy installation. Pid disguised himself as a clump of shrubbery, and Ger formed himself into an old log. Ilg, after a moment's thought, became a young oak.  The installation was in the form of a long, low building, surrounded by a metal fence. There was a gate, and guards in front of it.  The first job, Pid thought, was to get past that gate. He began to consider ways and means.  From the fragmentary reports of the survey parties, Pid knew that, in some ways, this race of Men were like the Grom. They had pets, as the Grom did, and homes and children, and a culture. The inhabitants were skilled mechanically, as were the Grom.  But there were terrific differences, also. The Men were of fixed and immutable form, like stones or trees. And to compensate, their planet boasted a fantastic array of species, types and kinds. This was completely unlike Grom, which had only eight distinct forms of animal life.  And evidently, the Men were skilled at detecting invaders, Pid thought. He wished he knew how the other expeditions had failed. It would make his job much easier.         *       *       *       *       *  A Man lurched past them on two incredibly stiff legs. Rigidity was evident in his every move. Without looking, he hurried past.  \"I know,\" Ger said, after the creature had moved away. \"I'll disguise myself as a Man, walk through the gate to the reactor room, and activate my Displacer.\"  \"You can't speak their language,\" Pid pointed out.  \"I won't speak at all. I'll ignore them. Look.\" Quickly Ger shaped himself into a Man.  \"That's not bad,\" Pid said.  Ger tried a few practice steps, copying the bumpy walk of the Man.  \"But I'm afraid it won't work,\" Pid said.  \"It's perfectly logical,\" Ger pointed out.  \"I know. Therefore the other expeditions must have tried it. And none of them came back.\"  There was no arguing that. Ger flowed back into the shape of a log. \"What, then?\" he asked.  \"Let me think,\" Pid said.  Another creature lurched past, on four legs instead of two. Pid recognized it as a Dog, a pet of Man. He watched it carefully.  The Dog ambled to the gate, head down, in no particular hurry. It walked through, unchallenged, and lay down in the grass.  \"H'm,\" Pid said.  They watched. One of the Men walked past, and touched the Dog on the head. The Dog stuck out its tongue and rolled over on its side.  \"I can do that,\" Ger said excitedly. He started to flow into the shape of a Dog.  \"No, wait,\" Pid said. \"We'll spend the rest of the day thinking it over. This is too important to rush into.\"  Ger subsided sulkily.  \"Come on, let's move back,\" Pid said. He and Ger started into the woods. Then he remembered Ilg.  \"Ilg?\" he called softly.  There was no answer.  \"Ilg!\"  \"What? Oh, yes,\" an oak tree said, and melted into a bush. \"Sorry. What were you saying?\"  \"We're moving back,\" Pid said. \"Were you, by any chance, Thinking?\"  \"Oh, no,\" Ilg assured him. \"Just resting.\"  Pid let it go at that. There was too much else to worry about.         *       *       *       *       *  They discussed it for the rest of the day, hidden in the deepest part of the woods. The only alternatives seemed to be Man or Dog. A Tree couldn't walk past the gates, since that was not in the nature of trees. Nor could anything else, and escape notice.  Going as a Man seemed too risky. They decided that Ger would sally out in the morning as a Dog.  \"Now get some sleep,\" Pid said.  Obediently his two crewmen flattened out, going immediately Shapeless. But Pid had a more difficult time.  Everything looked too easy. Why wasn't the atomic installation better guarded? Certainly the Men must have learned something from the expeditions they had captured in the past. Or had they killed them without asking any questions?  You couldn't tell what an alien would do.  Was that open gate a trap?  Wearily he flowed into a comfortable position on the lumpy ground. Then he pulled himself together hastily.  He had gone Shapeless!  Comfort was not in the line of duty, he reminded himself, and firmly took a Pilot's Shape.  But a Pilot's Shape wasn't constructed for sleeping on damp, bumpy ground. Pid spent a restless night, thinking of ships, and wishing he were flying one.  He awoke in the morning tired and ill-tempered. He nudged Ger.  \"Let's get this over with,\" he said.  Ger flowed gaily to his feet.  \"Come on, Ilg,\" Pid said angrily, looking around. \"Wake up.\"  There was no reply.  \"Ilg!\" he called.  Still there was no reply.  \"Help me look for him,\" Pid said to Ger. \"He must be around here somewhere.\"  Together they tested every bush, tree, log and shrub in the vicinity. But none of them was Ilg.  Pid began to feel a cold panic run through him. What could have happened to the Radioman?  \"Perhaps he decided to go through the gate on his own,\" Ger suggested. [original: Ilg suggested (n. of transcriber)]  Pid considered the possibility. It seemed unlikely. Ilg had never shown much initiative. He had always been content to follow orders.  They waited. But midday came, and there was still no sign of Ilg.  \"We can't wait any longer,\" Pid said, and they started through the woods. Pid wondered if Ilg _had_ tried to get through the gates on his own. Those quiet types often concealed a foolhardy streak.  But there was nothing to show that Ilg had been successful. He would have to assume that the Radioman was dead, or captured by the Men.  That left two of them to activate a Displacer.  And he still didn't know what had happened to the other expeditions.         *       *       *       *       *  At the edge of the woods, Ger turned himself into a facsimile of a Dog. Pid inspected him carefully.  \"A little less tail,\" he said.  Ger shortened his tail.  \"More ears.\"  Ger lengthened his ears,  \"Now even them up.\"  They became even.  Pid inspected the finished product. As far as he could tell, Ger was perfect, from the tip of his tail to his wet, black nose.  \"Good luck,\" Pid said.  \"Thanks.\" Cautiously Ger moved out of the woods, walking in the lurching style of Dogs and Men. At the gate the guard called to him. Pid held his breath.  Ger walked past the Man, ignoring him. The Man started to walk over. Ger broke into a run.  Pid shaped a pair of strong legs for himself, ready to dash if Ger was caught.  But the guard turned back to his gate. Ger stopped running immediately, and strolled quietly toward the main door of the building.  Pid dissolved his legs with a sigh of relief ... and then tensed again.  The main door was closed!  Pid hoped the Radioman wouldn't try to open it. That was _not_ in the nature of Dogs.  As he watched, another Dog came running toward Ger. Ger backed away from him. The Dog approached and sniffed. Ger sniffed back.  Then both of them ran around the building.  That was clever, Pid thought. There was bound to be a door in the rear.  He glanced up at the afternoon sun. As soon as the Displacer was activated, the Grom armies would begin to pour through. By the time the Men recovered from the shock, a million or more Grom troops would be here, weapons and all. With more following.  The day passed slowly, and nothing happened.  Nervously Pid watched the front of the plant. It shouldn't be taking so long, if Ger were successful.  Late into the night he waited. Men walked in and out of the installation, and Dogs barked around the gates. But Ger did not appear.  Ger had failed. Ilg was gone. Only he was left.  And _still_ he didn't know what had happened.         *       *       *       *       *  By morning, Pid was in complete despair. He knew that the twenty-first Grom expedition to this planet was near the point of complete failure. Now it was all up to him.  He saw that workers were arriving in great number, rushing through the gates. He decided to take advantage of the apparent confusion, and started to shape himself into a Man.  A Dog walked past the woods where he was hiding.  \"Hello,\" the Dog said.  It was Ger!  \"What happened?\" Pid asked, with a sigh of relief. \"Why"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32346"],["title","Keep Your Shape (#2)"],["body"," were you so long? Couldn't you get in?\"  \"I don't know,\" Ger said, wagging his tail. \"I didn't try.\"  Pid was speechless.  \"I went hunting,\" Ger said complacently. \"This form is ideal for Hunting, you know. I went out the rear gate with another Dog.\"  \"But the expedition--your duty--\"  \"I changed my mind,\" Ger told him. \"You know, Pilot, I never wanted to be a Detector.\"  \"But you were _born_ a Detector!\"  \"That's true,\" Ger said. \"But it doesn't help. I always wanted to be a Hunter.\"  Pid shook his entire body in annoyance. \"You can't,\" he said, very slowly, as one would explain to a Gromling. \"The Hunter shape is forbidden to you.\"  \"Not here it isn't,\" Ger said, still wagging his tail.  \"Let's have no more of this,\" Pid said angrily. \"Get into that installation and set up your Displacer. I'll try to overlook this heresy.\"  \"No,\" Ger said. \"I don't want the Grom here. They'd ruin it for the rest of us.\"  \"He's right,\" a nearby oak tree said.  \"Ilg!\" Pid gasped. \"Where are you?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Branches stirred. \"I'm right here,\" Ilg said. \"I've been Thinking.\"  \"But--your caste--\"  \"Pilot,\" Ger said sadly, \"why don't you wake up? Most of the people on Grom are miserable. Only custom makes us take the caste-shape of our ancestors.\"  \"Pilot,\" Ilg said, \"all Grom are born Shapeless!\"  \"And being born Shapeless, all Grom should have Freedom of Shape,\" Ger said.  \"Exactly,\" Ilg said. \"But he'll never understand. Now excuse me. I want to Think.\" And the oak tree was silent.  Pid laughed humorlessly. \"The Men will kill you off,\" he said. \"Just as they killed off all the other expeditions.\"  \"No one from Grom has been killed,\" Ger told him. \"The other expeditions are right here.\"  \"Alive?\"  \"Certainly. The Men don't even know we exist. That Dog I was Hunting with is a Grom from the twelfth expedition. There are hundreds of us here, Pilot. We like it.\"  Pid tried to absorb it all. He had always known that the lower castes were lax in caste-consciousness. But this was preposterous!  This planet's secret menace was--freedom!  \"Join us, Pilot,\" Ger said. \"We've got a paradise here. Do you know how many species there are on this planet? An uncountable number! There's a shape to suit every need!\"  Pid ignored them. Traitors!  He'd do the job all by himself.  So Men were unaware of the presence of the Grom. Getting near the reactor might not be so difficult after all. The others had failed in their duty because they were of the lower castes, weak and irresponsible. Even the Pilots among them must have been secretly sympathetic to the Cult of Shapelessness the Chief had mentioned, or the alien planet could never have swayed them.  What shape to assume for his attempt?  Pid considered.  A Dog might be best. Evidently Dogs could wander pretty much where they wished. If something went wrong, Pid could change his shape to meet the occasion.  \"The Supreme Council will take care of all of you,\" he snarled, and shaped himself into a small brown Dog. \"I'm going to set up the Displacer myself.\"  He studied himself for a moment, bared his teeth at Ger, and loped toward the gate.         *       *       *       *       *  He loped for about ten feet and stopped in utter horror.  The smells rushed at him from all directions. Smells in a profusion and variety he had never dreamed existed. Smells that were harsh, sweet, sharp, heavy, mysterious, overpowering. Smells that terrified. Alien and repulsive and inescapable, the odors of Earth struck him like a blow.  He curled his lips and held his breath. He ran on for a few steps, and had to breathe again. He almost choked.  He tried to remold his Dog-nostrils to be less sensitive. It didn't work. It wouldn't, so long as he kept the Dog-shape. An attempt to modify his metabolism didn't work either.  All this in the space of two or three seconds. He was rooted in his tracks, fighting the smells, wondering what to do.  Then the noises hit him.  They were a constant and staggering roar, through which every tiniest whisper of sound stood out clearly and distinct. Sounds upon sounds--more noise than he had ever heard before at one time in his life. The woods behind him had suddenly become a mad-house.  Utterly confused, he lost control and became Shapeless.  He half-ran, half-flowed into a nearby bush. There he re-Shaped, obliterating the offending Dog ears and nostrils with vicious strokes of his thoughts.  The Dog-shape was out. Absolutely. Such appalling sharpness of senses might be fine for a Hunter such as Ger--he probably gloried in them. But another moment of such impressions would have driven Pid the Pilot mad.  What now? He lay in the bush and thought about it, while gradually his mind threw off the last effects of the dizzying sensory assault.  He looked at the gate. The Men standing there evidently hadn't noticed his fiasco. They were looking in another direction.  ... a Man?  Well, it was worth a try.         *       *       *       *       *  Studying the Men at the gate, Pid carefully shaped himself into a facsimile--a synthesis, actually, embodying one characteristic of that, another of this.  He emerged from the side of the bush opposite the gate, on his hands and knees. He sniffed the air, noting that the smells the Man-nostrils picked up weren't unpleasant at all. In fact, some of them were decidedly otherwise. It had just been the acuity of the Dog-nostrils, the number of smells they had detected and the near-brilliance with which they had done so, that had shocked him.  Also, the sounds weren't half so devastating. Only relatively close sounds stood out. All else was an undetailed whispering.  Evidently, Pid thought, it had been a long time since Men had been Hunters.  He tested his legs, standing up and taking a few clumsy steps. _Thud_ of foot on ground. Drag the other leg forward in a heavy arc. _Thud._ Rocking from side to side, he marched back and forth behind the bush. His arms flapped as he sought balance. His head wobbled on its neck, until he remembered to hold it up. Head up, eyes down, he missed seeing a small rock. His heel turned on it. He sat down, hard.  The ankle hurt. Pid curled his Man-lips and crawled back into the bush.  The Man-shape was too unspeakably clumsy. It was offensive to plod one step at a time. Body held rigidly upright. Arms wobbling. There had been a deluge of sense-impressions in the Dog-shape; there was dull, stiff, half-alive inadequacy to the Man-shape.  Besides, it was dangerous, now that Pid thought it over, as well as distasteful. He couldn't control it properly. It wouldn't look right. Someone might question him. There was too much about Men he didn't--couldn't--know. The planting of the Displacer was too important a thing for him to fumble again. Only luck had kept him from being seen during the sensory onslaught.  The Displacer in his body pouch pulsed and tugged, urging him to be on his way toward the distant reactor room.  Grimly, Pid let out the last breath he had taken with his Man-lungs, and dissolved the lungs.  What shape to take?  Again he studied the gate, the Men standing beside it, the building beyond in which was the all-important reactor.  A small shape was needed. A fast one. An unobtrusive one.  He lay and thought.  The bush rustled above him. A small brown shape had fluttered down to light on a twig. It hopped to another twig, twittering. Then it fluttered off in a flash, and was gone.  That, Pid thought, was it.         *       *       *       *       *  A Sparrow that was not a Sparrow rose from the bush a few moments later. An observer would have seen it circle the bush, diving, hedgehopping, even looping, as if practicing all maneuvers possible to Sparrows.  Pid tensed his shoulder muscles, inclined his wings. He slipped off to the right, approached the bush at what seemed breakneck speed, though he knew this was only because of his small size. At the last second he lifted his tail. Not quite quickly enough. He swooped up and over the top of the bush, but his legs brushed the top leaves, his beak went down, and he stumbled in air for a few feet back-forward.  He blinked beady eyes as if at a challenge. Back toward the bush at a fine clip, again up and over. This time cleanly.  He chose a tree. Zoomed into its network of branches, wove a web of flight, working his way around and around the trunk, over and under branches that flashed before him, through crotches with no more than a feather's-breath to spare.  At last he rested on a low branch, and found himself chirping in delight.  The tree extruded a feeler from the branch he sat on, and touched his wings and tail.  \"Interesting,\" said the tree. \"I'll have to try that shape some time.\"  Ilg.  \"Traitor,\" hissed Pid, growing a mouth in his chest to hiss it, and then he did something that caused Ilg to exclaim in outrage.  Pid flew out of the woods. Over the underbrush and across the open space toward the gate.  This body would do the trick!  This body would do anything!  He rose, in a matter of a few Sparrow heartbeats, to an altitude of a hundred feet. From here the gate, the Men, the building were small, sharp shapes against a green-brown mat. Pid found that he could see not only with unaccustomed clarity, but with a range of vision that astonished him. To right and to left he could see far into the hazy blue of the sky, and the higher he rose the farther he could see.  He rose higher.  The Displacer pulsed, reminding him of the job he had to do.         *       *       *       *       *  He stiffened his wings and glided, regretfully putting aside his desires to experiment with this wonderful shape, at least for the present. After he planted the Displacer, he would go off by himself for a while and do it just a little more--somewhere where Ilg and Ger would not see him--before the Grom Army arrived and the invasion began.  He felt a tiny twinge of guilt, as he circled. It was Evil to want to keep this alien flying shape any longer"]]]
