And not only because they have called him Lord by the Spirit, but because they have, by the guidance and direction of the same Spirit, been baptized, ver. 13, “For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body,” &c.  I need not go about to confute that notion that some of late have had of this text., viz., that the baptism here spoken of is the baptism of the Spirit, because you have not owned and declared that notion as your judgment, but on the contrary, all of you that I have ever conversed with, have declared it to be understood of baptism with water, by the direction of the Spirit: If so, then it follows, that men and women are declared members of Christ’s body by baptism, and cannot be by scripture reputed and esteemed so without it; which farther appears from Rom. vi. 5, where men by baptism are said to be “planted” into the likeness of his death and Col. ii. 12, we are said to be “buried with him” by baptism.  All which, together with the consent of all Christians (some few in these later times excepted), do prove that baptism is necessary to the initiating persons into the Church of Christ.  (3.)  Holiness of life is essential to church-communion, because it seems to be the reason why Christ founded a church in the world, viz., that men might thereby be watched over, and kept from falling; and that if any be overtaken with a fault, he that is spiritual might restore him, that by this means men and women might be preserved without blame to the coming of Christ; and the grace of God teacheth us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly and uprightly in this present evil world; Tit. ii. 11, 12.  “And let every one that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity;” 2 Tim. ii. 19.  And James tells us (speaking of the Christian religion), that “pure religion, and undefiled before God, is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep ourselves unspotted from the world;” James i. 27. From all which (together with many more texts that might be produced) it appears, that an unholy and profane life is inconsistent with Christian religion and society; and that holiness is essential to salvation and church-communion.  So that these three things, faith, baptism, and a holy life, as I said before, all churches must agree and unite in, as those things which, when wanting, will destroy their being.  And let not any think, that when I say, believing the Son of God died for the sins of men is essential to salvation and church-communion, that I hereby would exclude all other articles of the Christian creed as not necessary; as the belief of the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment, &c., which, for want of time, I omit to speak particularly to, and the rather, because I understand this great article of believing the Son of God died for the sins of men is comprehensive of all others, and is that from whence all other articles may easily be inferred.  And here I would not be mistaken, as though I held there was nothing else for Christians to practise, when I say this is all that is requisite to church-communion; for I very well know, that Christ requires many other things of us, after we are members of his body, which, if we knowingly or maliciously refuse, may be the cause, not only of excommunication, but damnation.  But yet these are such things as relate to the well-being and not to the being of churches; as laying on of hands in the primitive times upon believers, by which they did receive the gifts of the Spirit: This, I say, was for the increase and edifying of the body, and not that thereby they might become of the body of Christ, for that they were before.  And do not think that I believe laying on of hands was no apostolical institution, because I say men are not thereby made members of Christ’s body, or because I say that it is not essential to church-communion.  Why should I be thought to be against a fire in the chimney, because I say it must not be in the thatch of the house? Consider, then, how pernicious a thing it is to make every doctrine (though true) the bond of communion; this is that which destroys unity, and by this rule all men must be perfect before they can be in peace: for do we not see daily, that as soon as men come to a clearer understanding of the mind of God (to say the best of what they hold), that presently all men are excommunicable, if not damnable, that do not agree with them. Do not some believe and see that to be pride and covetousness, which others do not, because (it may be) they have more narrowly and diligently searched into their duty of these things than others have?  What then? Must all men that have not so large acquaintance of their duty herein be excommunicated?  Indeed it were to be wished that more moderation in apparel and secular concernments were found among churches: but God forbid, that if they should come short herein, that we should say, as one lately said, that he could not communicate with such a people, because they were proud and superfluous in their apparel.  Let me appeal to such, and demand of them, if there was not a time, since they believed and were baptized, wherein they did not believe laying on of hands a duty? and did they not then believe, and do they not still believe, they were members of the body of Christ?  And was not there a time when you did not so well understand the nature and extent of pride and covetousness as now you do?  And did you not then believe, and do you not still believe, that you were true members of Christ, though less perfect?  Why then should you not judge of those that differ from you herein, as you judged of yourselves when you were as they now are?  How needful then is it for Christians to distinguish (if ever they would be at peace and unity) between those truths which are essential to church-communion, and those that are not?  3.  Unity and peace consists in all as with one shoulder practising and putting in execution the things we do know; Phil. iii. 16. “Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, and mind the same thing.”  How sad is it to see our zeal consume us and our precious time in things doubtful and disputable, while we are not concerned nor affected with the practice of those indisputable things we all agree in!  We all know charity to be the great command, and yet how few agree to practise it?  We all know they that labour in the word and doctrine are worthy of double honour; and that God hath ordained, that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.  These duties, however others have cavilled at them, I know you agree in them, and are persuaded of your duty therein: but where is your zeal to practise?  O how well would it be with churches, if they were but half as zealous for the great, and plain, and indisputable things, and the more chargeable and costly things of religion, as they are for things doubtful or less necessary, or for things that are no charge to them, and cost them nothing but the breath of contention, though that may be too great a price for the small things they purchase with it!  But further, Do we not all agree, that men that preach the gospel should do it like workmen that need not be ashamed? and yet how little is this considered by many preachers, who never consider before they speak of what they say, or whereof they affirm!  How few give themselves to study that they may be approved!  How few meditate and give themselves to these things, that their profiting may appear to all!  For the Lord’s sake let us unite to practise those things we know; and if we would have more talents, let us all agree to improve those we have.  See the spirit that was among the primitive professors, that knowing and believing how much it concerned them in the propagating of Christianity, to shew forth love to one another (that so all might know them to be Christ’s disciples), rather than there should be any complainings among them, they sold all they had.  O how zealous were these to practise, and as with one shoulder to do that that was upon their hearts for God!  I might further add, how often have we agreed in our judgment? and hath it not been upon our hearts, that this and the other thing is good to be done, to enlighten the dark world, and to repair the breaches of churches, and to raise up those churches that now lie gasping, and among whom the soul of religion is expiring?  But what do we more than talk of them?  Do not most decline these things, when they either call for their purses or their persons to help in this and such like works as these? Let us then, in what we know, unite, that we may put it in practice, remembering, that if we know these things, we shall be happy if we do them.  4.  This unity and peace consists in our joining and agreeing to pray for, and to press after, those truths we do not know.  The disciples in the primitive times were conscious of their imperfections, and therefore they with one accord continued in prayer and supplications.  If we were more in the sense of our ignorance and imperfections, we should carry it better towards those that differ from us: then we should abound more in the spirit of meekness and forbearance, that thereby we might bring others (or be brought by others) to the knowledge of the truth: this would make us go to God, and say with Elihu, Job xxxiv. 32, “That which we know not, teach thou us.”  Brethren, did we but all agree that we were erring in many things, we should soon agree to go to God, and pray for more wisdom and revelation of his mind and will concerning us.  But here is our misery, that we no sooner receive any thing for truth, but we presently ascend the chair of infallibility with it, as "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3614"],["title","An Exhortation to Peace and Unity (#2)"],["body","in this we could not err: hence it is we are impatient of contradiction, and become uncharitable to those that are not of the same mind; but now a consciousness that we may mistake, or that if my brother err in one thing, I may err in another; this will unite us in affection, and engage us to press after perfection, according to that of the apostle; Phil. iii. 13–15, “Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: But this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.  And if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.”  O then that we could but unite and agree to go to God for one another, in confidence that he will teach us; and that if any one of us want wisdom (as who of us does not), we might agree to ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth no man!  Let us, like those people spoken of in the 2d of Isaiah, say to one another, “Come, let us go to the Lord, for he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.”  5.  This unity and peace mainly consists in unity of love and affection: this is the great and indispensable duty of all Christians; by this they are declared Christ’s disciples; And hence it is that love is called “the great commandment,” “the old commandment,” and “the new commandment;” that which was commanded in the beginning, and will remain to the end, yea, and after the end. 1 Cor. xiii. 8, “Charity never faileth; but whether there be tongues, they shall cease; or whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.”  And ver. 13, “And now abideth faith, hope, charity; but the greatest of these is charity.”  And Col. iii. 14, “Above all these things, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness;” because charity is the end of the commandment, 1 Tim. i. 5. Charity is therefore called “the royal law;” as though it had a superintendency over other laws, and doubtless is a law to which other laws must give place, when they come in competition with it; “above all things, therefore, have fervent charity among yourselves; for charity shall cover the multitude of sins;” 1 Pet. iv. 8.  Let us therefore live in unity and peace, and the God of love and peace will be with us.  That you may so do, let me remind you (in the words of a learned man), that the unity of the church is a unity of love and affection, and not a bare uniformity of practice and opinion.  III.  Having shewn you wherein this unity consists, I now come to the third general thing propounded: and that is, to shew you the fruits and benefits of unity and peace, together with the mischiefs and inconveniences that attend those churches where unity and peace are wanting.  1.  Unity and peace is a duty well-pleasing to God, who is styled the author of peace and not of confusion.  In all the churches God’s Spirit rejoiceth in the unity of our spirits; but on the other hand, where strife and divisions are, there the Spirit of God is grieved.  Hence it is that the apostle no sooner calls upon the Ephesians not to grieve the Spirit of God, but he presently subjoins us a remedy against that evil, that they put away bitterness and evil-speaking, and be kind one to another, and tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven them; Eph. iv. 30, 32.  2.  As unity and peace is pleasing to God, and rejoiceth his Spirit, so it rejoiceth the hearts and spirits of God’s people.  Unity and peace brings heaven down upon earth among us: hence it is that the apostle tells us, Rom. iv. 17, that “the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.”  Where unity and peace is, there is heaven upon earth; by this we taste the first fruits of that blessed estate we shall one day live in the fruition of; when we shall come “to the general assembly and church of the first-born, whose names are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect;” Heb. xii. 23.  This outward peace of the church (as a learned man observes) distils into peace of conscience, and turns writings and readings of controversy into treatises of mortification and devotion.  And the Psalmist tells us, that it is not only good, but pleasant for brethren to dwell together in unity, Psalm cxxxiii.  But where unity and peace is wanting, there are storms and troubles; “where envy and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work;” James iii. 16.  It is the outward peace of the church that increaseth our inward joy; and the peace of God’s house gives us occasion to eat our meat with gladness in our own houses, Acts ii. 46.  3.  The unity and peace of the church makes communion of saints desirable.  What is it that embitters church-communion, and makes it burdensome, but divisions?  Have you not heard many complain, that they are weary of church-communion, because of church-contention? but now where unity and peace is, there Christians long for communion.  David saith, that he was glad when they said unto him, “Let us go to the house of God;” Psalm cxxii. 1.  Why was this, but because (as the third verse tells us) Jerusalem was a city compact together, where the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, to give thanks to his name?  And David, speaking of the man that was once his friend, doth thereby let us know the benefit of peace and unity; Psalm lv. 14.  “We,” saith he, “took sweet counsel together, and walked to the house of God in company.” Where unity is strongest, communion is sweetest and most desirable.  You see then that peace and union fills the people of God with desires after communion: but, on the other hand, hear how David complains, Psalm cxx., “Wo is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, and that I dwell in the tents of Kedar.”  The Psalmist here is thought to allude to a sort of men that dwelt in the deserts of Arabia, that got their livings by contention; and therefore he adds, ver. 6, that his soul had long dwelt with them that hated peace.  This was that which made him long for the courts of God, and esteem one day in his house better than a thousand.  This made his soul even faint for the house of God, because of the peace of it; “Blessed are they,” saith he, “that dwell in thy house, they will be still praising thee.”  There is a certain note of concord, as appears, Acts ii., where we read of primitive Christians, meeting with one accord, praising God.  4.  Where unity and peace is, there many mischiefs and inconveniences are prevented, which attend those people where peace and unity are wanting: and of those many that might be mentioned, I shall briefly insist upon these nine.  1.  Where unity and peace is wanting, there is much precious time spent to no purpose.  How many days are spent, and how many fruitless journeys made to no profit, where the people are not in peace? how often have many redeemed time (even in seed-time and harvest) when they could scarce afford it, to go to church, and, by reason of their divisions, come home worse than they went, repenting they have spent so much precious time to so little benefit?  How sad is it to see men spend their precious time, in which they should work out their salvation, in labouring, as in the fire, to prove an uncertain and doubtful proposition, and to trifle away their time, in which they should make their calling and election sure, to make sure of an opinion, which, when they have done all, they are not infallibly sure whether it be true or no, because all things necessary to salvation and church-communion are plainly laid down in scripture, in which we may be infallibly sure of the truth of them; but for other things that we have no plain texts for, but the truth of them depends upon our interpretations, here we must be cautioned, that we do not spend much time in imposing those upon others, or venting those among others, unless we can assume infallibility, otherwise we spend time upon uncertainty.  And whoever casts their eyes abroad, and do open their ears to intelligence, shall both see, and to their sorrow hear, that many churches spend most of their time in jangling and contending about those things which are neither essential to salvation nor church-communion; and that which is worse, about such doubtful questions which they are never able to give an infallible solution of.  But now where unity and peace is, there our time is spent in praising God; and in those great questions, What we should do to be saved? and, How we may be more holy and more humble towards God, and more charitable and more serviceable to one another?  2.  Where unity and peace is wanting, there is evil surmising and evil speaking, to the damage and disgrace, if not to the ruining, of one another; Gal. v. 14, 15.  The whole law is fulfilled in one word, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  But if you bite and devour one another, take heed you be not consumed one of another.”  No sooner the bond of charity is broken, which is as a wall about Christians, but soon they begin to make havock and spoil of one another; then there is raising evil reports, and taking up evil reports, against each other.  Hence it is that whispering and backbiting proceeds, and going from house to house to blazon the faults and infirmities of others: hence it is that we watch for the haltings of one another, and do inwardly rejoice at the miscarriages of others, saying in our hearts, “ha! ha! so we would have it:” but now where unity and peace is, there is charity; and where charity is, there we are willing to hide the faults, and cover the nakedness, of our brethren.  “Charity thinketh no evil;” 1 Cor. xiii. 5; and therefore it cannot surmise, neither will it speak evil.  3.  Where unity and peace is wanting, there can be no great matters enterprised—we cannot do much for God, nor much for one another; when the devil would hinder the"]]]
