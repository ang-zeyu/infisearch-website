The shut eyes saw the red battlefields, with the lines swaying to and fro, while the shrapnel burst and the aeroplanes whirred in the smoke of the cannon.  The cries of men suddenly smitten smote on the inner ear.  It was then that the great thing happened.  All of a sudden the voice broke, recovered, and broke again, and the minister was swept away from the well-ordered, beautiful words he had prepared.  He began to speak of the stricken hearts at home, of fathers and mothers to whom their sons would never return, of women in empty houses with their husbands laid in nameless graves, of little children who would never learn to say \"Father\" ... It was then that my friend stifled a sob.  There was Something after all, Someone greater than cosmic forces, greater than law--with an eye to pity and an arm to save.  There was God.  And my friend's son was with the famous regiment that was swaying to and fro, grappling with destiny.  He was helpless--and there was only God to appeal to.  There comes an hour in life when the heart realises that instinct is mightier far than that logic which is, after all is said, only the last refuge of the feeble-minded.  There came like the sudden lifting of a curtain the vision of a whole nation--nay, of races girdling the whole earth--to whom the same high experience has come. Everywhere the sanctuaries filled, the eyes turned upward, for instinct is mightier than reason.  The smoke of battle has revealed the face of God.  ***  With us in the parish churches of Scotland the great thing is the sermon.  But to-day it is different; the great thing now is prayer. And the minister preached about prayer.  He set forth in clear and ordered language, with a felicitous phrase now and then lighting up his sentences, that prayer was not a mere relic of fanatical superstition but a mighty power.  He discussed with a wealth of learning whether God had shut Himself in behind a prison-house of cosmic laws that made it impossible for Him to answer prayer.  He reasoned the worshippers cold. But there in that hour reason was bound to give way before intuition.  \"If I am free,\" cried the preacher, \"to rush to the help of my child when he crieth in terror; and if, when the creatures of His hand cry to God He is bound and cannot help or soothe, then He is poorer than I, so great a thing is freedom.\"  Prayer was not mere spiritual gymnastics. A God immured in cold laws, barred for ever from the play of love or tenderness, would be the one being in the universe most to be pitied. The Creator did not sit deaf and dumb on the Throne of indifference answering nothing, doing nothing.  History was the proof that Righteousness was throned at the core of the universe, for at the last right ever prevailed.  Then the measured tones went on to speak of the difficulty of believing in the efficacy of prayer when Christians faced Christians in mortal conflict, and they both cried for victory--both the children of the One Father crying for victory over each other.  But the difficulty was of appearance only.  For the only prevailing prayer was prayer in the name of Christ.  \"Whatsoever ye shall ask _in My name_ that will I do.\"  To ask in His name was to ask in His spirit--the spirit of humility, self-sacrifice, and love--the spirit of self-surrender to the _will_ supreme.  The question was which of the prayers for victory was prayer in the name of Christ....  This was clear, convincing, but cold.  Only at rare intervals does the minister of our parish give way to passion.  Suddenly there came a wave of emotion.  He flung his head back, and his eyes glowed.  His voice vibrated through the church.  \"When I think,\" he exclaimed, \"of the things that have been done with the name of God on men's lips; of atrocities such as the unspeakable Turk never perpetrated; of war waged not upon to-day but upon the centuries of faith that reared great cathedrals now in flames; of women and children laid upon the reeking altars of human passion; and all this in the name of culture, the culture of the superman who deems himself superior to the Ten Commandments--then, I say, may God grant that the culture which beareth such fruit may perish from off the face of the earth.  Prayer for the triumph of such a cause cannot be in Christ's name....\"  But the preacher never got any further.  This was what happened, and I am afraid some will not believe me, for a Scotsman in church is a stoic, motionless and dumb, as he listens to the Word.  But all the traditions of the parish were snapped in a second.  In the side gallery sat the General, sitting as he always does with his back to the minister.  This he does that he may mark who are in church of his servants and tenants, and who absent.  When I read of the nobles in France who went to the scaffold with a jest in the days of the Terror, I always think of the General.  He is that sort of man.  To-day, little by little, as the sermon went on, he turned round.  At last he was facing the pulpit.  His gleaming eyes were fixed on the preacher.  His son was dead.  And when the words rang through the church, may God grant that such culture may perish ... the General sprang to his feet.  \"Amen\" rang his voice through the church.  There was a sudden movement; as one man they all rose to their feet. Hands were lifted up to heaven.  \"Amen,\" \"Amen,\" they cried--and then there rose a cheer--muffled, but still a cheer.  In the pulpit the words died on the preacher's lips.  He seemed as one suddenly stricken. He gazed bewildered over the sea of faces.  They sank back into the pews as though suddenly ashamed.  The last man to sit was my friend, who stood to the last with uplifted hand.  I think it was he who cried \"Hear, hear\"--the only sign he gave of his long absence from church.  The sermon was never finished.  The preacher in a low voice said, \"Let us pray.\"  And he humbled himself as one who enters the valley of humiliation.  And then he gave out this psalm:--    Now Israel     May say, and that truly,   If that the Lord     Had not our cause maintained;     *    *    *    *    *   Then certainly     They had devoured us all.     *    *    *    *    *   But blessed be God,     Who doth us safely keep,   And hath not giv'n     Us for a living prey   Unto their teeth,     And bloody cruelty.     *    *    *    *    *  This psalm as we sang it that day was a p√¶an of triumph.  The clouds suddenly broke.  We heard our fathers singing it in their dark days. The melody wedded to the words soared in exultant triumph, wailed like the cry of the shingle swept by the surf; the sighing of the wind over the heather was in it, and the hissing of the storm through the spray. It was fierce as devouring death; it was gentle as a mother crooning over her child.  It put iron into the blood of our fathers as they sang it.  It was nerved by such a hymn that the sailors of Queen Elizabeth swept the main, that the Puritans wrestled with principalities and powers, that a handful of moors-men levelled despotism and tyranny to the ground.  It swept through our blood like flame as we in our day of stress now sang it.  We, too, would pull down strongholds and turn to flight the armies of the alien.  In all ages the cause of freedom triumphed, and that cause was ours.  We had entered on conflict with clean hands and, God helping us, we would wage it with clean hands. The clouds suddenly broke and the light of victory irradiated our faces.  There came overwhelmingly the realisation that there was a power behind us mightier far than sword or shell--even the Lord God Omnipotent.  And that was how we made the greatest of all discoveries--we found God.  ***  Yesterday morning I went early to the station, and there in the booking office I found my friend talking to the ticket-collector.  The ticket-collector is a philosopher, and he comes to church, because he loves the old psalm tunes.  But when one of our parishioners who goes now and then to Keswick comes to the booking office, the ticket-collector calls him in and reasons with him gently.  \"Mahn, there's naething in it,\" he says; \"I can tell you for a fact there's naething in it--all a whack of fables.\"  \"Some day you'll find out to your cost that there's something in it,\" flashes the man from Keswick.  \"If ye wad only reid philosophee,\" says the ticket-collector, \"ye would ken better.\"  But to-day my friend and the ticket-collector had their heads close together, and I only heard the conclusion of their argument.  \"Mahn,\" said the ticket-collector, \"I am beginning to think there may be something in it.\"  And in the evening near the top of the brae I saw the General standing erect with his little cane in his hand.  He was talking to the shoemaker, the greatest Radical in the parish--one of a party with which the General has no dealings.  But they talked like brothers.  For the shoemaker has a son fighting at the front, and his heart is sore troubled within him.  And the General's son is dead.  And as I came up the brae I saw the General putting his hand on the shoemaker's shoulder and turn away, walking slowly up the brae.  The old shoemaker saluted and came down the brae.  There was a tender look in the old man's eye as he greeted me.  In our parish we have truly made the greatest of all discoveries.  We have found God, and, finding Him, we have found each other.  The man who in his madness kindled the lurid flames of war little dreamed of this fire which he kindled.
