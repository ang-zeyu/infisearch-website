I took Leave of my Family and my dearest Acquaintance, who were sorry to part with me, and set out for _Paris_. The Grandeur, Magnificence, and Variety, together with the vast Concourse of People of all Ranks, which I saw on my Arrival at this fine Place, did at the first Dash astonish me; every thing that occur'd to my View, seem'd perfectly new to me; I thought my self in another World; and M. _Rousseau_, the Surgeon, to whose Tuition I had been recommended, had enough to do for near a fortnight to answer the Questions I was continually putting to him, to gratify my Curiosity. He likewise did me the Favour to carry me to _Marli_, _Fontainbleu_, _St. Dennis_, _St. Germain_, the _Louvre_, the _Tuilleries_, and many other Places, which are the Admiration of foreigners. But as the Value of Things is enhanc'd by their Rarity, and diminish'd by their Frequency, I accustom'd my self at last to look upon all these Fineries with a sort of Indifference, which by degrees turn'd to an Aversion; so that I abandoned all those Curiosities to the Speculation of the Idle and the Indolent, and began to apply my self carefully to the Art I had purpos'd to study. M. _Rousseau_ had very good Business, and great Experience, and the many Cures he perform'd, open'd new Discoveries to me every Day.  Yet for all this, scarce a Day pass'd but I exercis'd my self several Hours in those Languages and Sciences, in which I had before spent all my Time. I was the more encourag'd to do so, because Philosophy and the Mathematics seem'd to be much in vogue, by the Application of all Gentlemen to them, of what Age and Rank soever. At the same time there came out a Treatise of Conic Sections, said to be written by the Son of M. _Pascal_, the Intendant of Justice at _Roan_, at which, many Persons of Learning were really surpris'd. I had the Curiosity to run it over, but I found things in it which I thought above the Reach of a Lad of Sixteen Years of Age, for in several Places it surpass'd _Apollonius_. Many People were of my Opinion, especially when they consider'd, that the Father of this pretended young Author was a thorough Proficient in this Science, from whence the Generality imagin'd, that he had a mind to give the Son the Credit of it, to usher him into the World with the better Grace. Be this as it will, 'tis certain that the Junior _Pascal_ was a Man of a lively Imagination, and a great deal of Penetration and Judgment, as it afterwards fully appear'd. M. _Morin_, whom I took the Liberty to apply to, and who receiv'd me with extraordinary Civility, procur'd me also the Acquaintance of M. _Des Argues_, M. _Midorge_, and several other Mathematicians, who sav'd me a great deal of Labour by the curious MSS. they put into my Hands, and the clear and concise Methods they were pleas'd to make me acquainted with. By means of these learned Personages, I had Access likewise to the Reverend Father _Mercenne_. This ingenious Gentleman was a great Help to me for the understanding of several Questions in Natural Philosophy, and the Metaphysics. As he was intimate with M. _Descartes_, who was then in _Holland_, I propos'd nothing of Difficulty to him, but he explain'd to me at one time or other; and he was the first Man that ever put into my Hand the Six Meditations of that celebrated Philosopher. I was so desirous of learning how to demonstrate the Exigence of a God, the Immateriality of the Soul, and its real Distinction from the Body, that I read them with all the Attention I was capable of; but I frankly own that I was not satisfy'd with them. His Method for the due conducting of Reason, and finding out the Truth in the Sciences, his Dioptricks, his Meteors, his Theory of the World, and every thing in general that I had seen of his, charm'd me; but for his Metaphysics, as I said before, I lik'd no Part of 'em, but the Subtilty of his Arguments. This made me conclude, that we ought never to wade above the Depth of our shallow Understandings, and that we should confine our selves to Bodies, to explain their Nature, Form, Number, Properties, the Alterations occasion'd by Motion, and what may be most remarkable in them for our own Use, for the Good of Society, and for the Understanding and Advancement of Humane Knowledge, without pretending to make manifest and visible, as it were, to the naked Eye, such things as are in their own Nature _Arcana's_, and are, in all Probability, design'd to be for ever the Objects of our Faith and Admiration. It appear'd in a very little while, that I was not the only Person of that Opinion for an anonymous Book was publish'd at the _Hague_, by an unknown Author, with a View to explode the Philosophy of _Descartes_: At the same time Father _Bourdin_ attack'd it in his public _Theses_; and then came out the Objections of Messieurs _Hobbes_, _Gassendi_, _Arnaud_, and others, to his Metaphysics. I was so taken with that Author, that I was curious to see all his Disputes, which cost me so much Time, that my Master often reproach'd me for it, and said that I neglected the main Point, for the sake of applying to things which cou'd be of no great Use to me, and which, as to several of them, were not universally approv'd of. He even went so far as to tell me one Day, that I was in the high Road to Atheism, for that I had already embrac'd an Opinion which had been lately condemn'd by the Tribunal of the _Inquisition_, in the Person of _Galileo_, whom they had confin'd in the Prisons of the _Holy Office_, after having caus'd his Treatise of the _Circular Motion of the Earth_, according to the Principles of _Copernicus_, to be burnt by the common Hangman. But left these Reproaches might entirely discourage me, he took care to season them with Commendations of my considerable Talents for Surgery, and the Knowledge I had acquir'd in it, notwithstanding the Time I devoted to other Occupations.  At length, when he found that all he could say did not put me out of conceit with those fine Sciences, he resolv'd to enter me into the State of Matrimony. He talk'd to me incessantly of a very pretty Niece of his, who, after her Mother's Death, would have a considerable Estate. He often gave me to understand, that he shou'd not be sorry if I was marry'd to her; and that as he was advanc'd in Years, it would be in his Power to put me into the intire Possession of his Shop, which was well accustom'd: But this was not the Mark I aim'd at. When he perceiv'd my Indifference, he became more cold to me than before, insomuch that he began to neglect me, and to conceal several things from me, which I could not well learn without him; so that after having serv'd two Years Apprenticeship, I went to _Diep_, where I stay'd one Year more with M. _La Croix_, who was without Dispute a very able Master.  I will not stop here to relate the minute Adventures which I had in both those Towns, because I think them too inconsiderable; but I cannot pass over in Silence, that while I was at this Port, a Man arriv'd there whom the Vulgar call'd, _The Wandering Jew_. My Master, who was a curious Man, and very courteous, after having talk'd with him several times occasionally, invited him to Dinner one Day, that he might have the Opportunity of hearing him discourse. The first Thing he told us was, That he was Cotemporary with Jesus Christ, and that he saw him crucify'd. My Name, said he, is _Michob_, and I was one of _Pontius Pilate's_ Domestics. When that _Roman_ Judge pronounc'd Sentence against Jesus, I stept up to this pretended Criminal (continued he) and said to him, _What makes you stay here so long? Han't you heard your Condemnation? Get off! Why do you delay?_ To which the Holy Man reply'd to me, _I'll be gone, but you shall stay till I return._ 'This is now above 1600 Years ago (said he) which I hope is the greatest Part of the Time that I am to wander upon the Earth. Most People are fond of Life, and few there are but wou'd be glad to add an Age to the Years they have liv'd already, if it were in their Power, but for my own part, I wish with all my Heart I had dy'd a thousand Years ago.' As the Droll talk'd all manner of Languages, had by consequence a happy Memory, and had been a Traveller all his Life-time, it was a Pleasure to hear him relate a thousand Stories, as clear and evident Truths, which past Ages have transmitted to us in a very confused Light, and after a very uncertain manner. There is no Corner of the World but he affirm'd he had visited. He nam'd several Kingdoms and Republics to us, that lie about the two Poles, which we had never heard the mention of. All the Courts in the World were known to him. He was not ignorant of the minutest Circumstance of the most remarkable Revolutions of Empires, since he came into the World. In short, the remotest Incidents seem'd to him as recent as if they had just happen'd. But the Passage at which we all prick'd up our Ears, was where he began to entertain us with an Account of the Saints that rose again at the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ. All _Jerusalem_, said he, was alarm'd when it was reported that the People at the Burial-Places had seen the Earth move in several Parts, the Graves open of themselves, and naked Bodies appear, and make a thousand different Motions. The Spectators, continued he, were so astonish'd at this unexpected Sight, that they all trembled, and several dy'd with Fear. The most daring of them were willing, however, to see the Issue of it, and they were wonderfully surpris'd when, by and by, they saw Humane Creatures start all at once out of their Graves, and press in a Hurry thro' the Multitude, who made way for them by tumbling to the Ground, as if they were all going to take Possession of their Sepulchres. No one cou'd discern, added _Michob_, was he ever so attentive, of what Sex the risen Bodies were, for they seem'd to be all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37400"],["title","The Travels and Adventures of James Massey (#2)"],["body"," the same Bigness, the same Age, and Complexion, and had no visible Mark by which they cou'd be distinguish'd from one another. They had not a Hair upon all their Bodies; their Bellies were flat, and seem'd as if they stuck to their Ribs; several held their Mouths open, but there were no Teeth to be seen; and their round and smooth Fingers seem'd to be intirely bare of Nails. This made him conclude, that all the Excremental Parts, and those which serve to grind, to swallow and digest Food while we are in a State of Mortality, will not accompany us to the other World, where, in short, they would be useless. In fine, according to his Discourse, it was never positively known what became of those Persons; but it was reported some Days after, that they were gone to _Galilee_, where they were to confer with Jesus Christ, and from thence to be carry'd to the Mansion of the Blessed. It may well be suppos'd that this curious Subject did not fail to occasion a tedious Conversation: 'Twas Midnight when our Guest left us, tho' my Master, notwithstanding the Conversation he had had with him elsewhere, wou'd fain have kept him till next Day. As the Magistrates look'd upon him to be a Visionary, they did not much mind what he said, consequently he was not a dangerous Person, and ask'd no favour of any Body; for the common People, and abundance of credulous and superstitious Gossips, who thought him a Prodigy, gave him what Necessaries he wanted; besides that he stay'd but a little while in a Place, and was no more than a Wanderer up and down in the World.  His Departure, added to all the fine Things I had heard him say of Foreign Countries, very much whetted my natural Desire to travel. I imparted my Design to M. _La Croix_, and as he had already been so good as to watch all Opportunities of publishing the Progress I had made in my Profession, it was not at all difficult for me to enter my self as a Surgeon on Board the Ship of Captain _Le Sage_, then preparing for a Voyage to _Martinico_. We sail'd therefore from _Diep_ the 21st of _May_, 1643. Our Ship carry'd but four Guns, and the Crew consisted but of Fifty-two Persons. Tho' the Captain was a _Huguenot_, yet he was a perfect honest Man, strictly just, and extremely devout. He wou'd not suffer a Day to pass over his Head without Publick Prayers on Board, every Morning and Evening, which were perform'd with great Zeal and Edification by _Peter du Quesne_, a young Student in Divinity, with whom, I can truly say, for my own part, I was so affected, that I immediately conceiv'd an Esteem for him, and that I had not been in his Company a Fortnight, but the Veneration, which the Monks had impress'd me with for the holy Men and Women in Paradise, was very much abated; but as ill Luck would have it, the Benefit I receiv'd from the wholsom Lectures of this agreeable Companion, was of no long Duration.  Twenty-seven Days after our Departure, when we were off of _Cape Finisterre_, we perceiv'd that our Ship took in much more Water than ordinary. The Carpenters, who were never idle, were as diligent as possible to find out the Cause of this Disaster; but notwithstanding all their Care, and the plying of the Pumps Day and Night, they were never the nearer, and at the end of Thirty-six Hours the Water was risen to such a Height, that it run out at the Port-Holes. The Captain seeing there was no Remedy, order'd us to put to Sea in the two Long-Boats, without taking any thing with us but our Money, of which we had not much. M. _Le Sage_ was still on Board, with the Master, the Pilots, and four other young Gentlemen, who were only making a Voyage of Pleasure, when the Ship sunk to the bottom like a Stone. Tho' they were prepar'd for the Event, yet they were intangled in one another; but as we were at hand, we gave them all the Assistance in our Power, and had only the Misfortune to lose one of those four Lads, _Colombier_, a young Gentleman of _Picardy_, who was scarce Fifteen Years of Age.  We were oblig'd to be as easy as possible under our Loss, and to consider what Course to steer next; for tho' we had try'd to make to Land for above two Days, yet the Wind, which was at S.E. hinder'd us. The most mortifying Circumstance of all was, that thro' a Misconstruction of the Captain's Meaning, and for want of Time to supply our selves, we had very little Provision, and no Compass to guide us. The Sky was serene, the Sea calm, and the Weather agreeable; but every one dreaded a Change. Mean time, with the Light of the Sun by Day, and of the Stars by Night, we us'd the utmost Diligence to get ashore, but cou'd not observe that we made any considerable Advance; so that we began to despair of our Lives, especially upon the third Day, when there fell so thick a Fog, that it was impossible to see the Distance of two Foot. At this very time, the little Long-Boat separated from ours, which the Captain perceiving by the Cries we made to one another, press'd the feeble Rowers to strain hard to rejoin us, which they did indeed, with a Vengeance; for falling foul upon our little Vessel, those on Board us were so alarm'd, that they all rose up at once, and gave such a Shock to theirs, that it turn'd Keel upwards. We had a great deal of Difficulty to save them, and much more to make room for them; for we all lay one upon another, and had not eat any thing for above Forty Eight Hours.  In short, it pleased God that about Noon, when the Sun had dispers'd the Fog, we discover'd several Sail coming towards us, which agreeable Sight gave us Joy inexpressible. We tack'd about immediately to meet them, and in three or four Hours time they came up with us, when Captain _Davidson_ was so kind as to take us on Board his Ship. He was bound from _Portsmouth_, as Convoy to Seventeen _English_ Merchant Ships, that were going to _Lisbon_. As our Bowels had been so much relax'd, and it being the Opinion of the Physicians (whom, however, we did not go to consult on purpose) that there was no danger in Eating and Drinking heartily, no sooner were the Provisions brought, but we were all glad to see our Beards wag. Every thing that was serv'd up to us was absorb'd as quick as if it had been thrown into a Well; but tho' our Bellies were full, we were not satisfy'd. We had no sooner granted a Respite to our Jaws, but we fell into a profound Sleep, and I question if there was one of us that did not sleep at least Twenty Hours before he was thoroughly awake. The Second Meal set us intirely to rights again. A Lieutenant of the Ship who spoke _French_, would needs have me give him the Particulars of our Misfortunes, some of which rais'd his Pity, and others his Laughter. At last we arriv'd at a good Harbour, and landed at _Lisbon_ the first of _July_, without the Loss of one Man besides _Colombier_.     CHAP. II.  _The Author's Stay at_ Lisbon, _&c._   _Lisbon_ stands near the Mouth of the _Tagus_, in a Situation extremely diverting; and certainly 'tis one of the finest Cities in _Europe_. It has a considerable Trade, which renders it very populous and wealthy. According, to the Calculation I made of it in the Bulk, there cannot be less than 20000 Houses. There are Thirty-five or Forty Gates for the Conveniency of the Inhabitants; and I am very much mistaken if it be not two long Leagues in Compass.  The Person to whom I made my Application, was one M. _Du Pre_, a Surgeon by Profession, a Man who had a great deal of Practice, and was capable of finding me Employment. In short, the good Man receiv'd me with open Arms. I had been with him but a very little while ere I discover'd that he was one of the Reformed, for he went very seldom to Mass, often read Sermons to his Children, and not a _Sunday_ went over his Head but he catechis'd them privately: And he, for his part, quickly perceiv'd also that I was very far from a Bigot; so that he confess'd to me he kept the Bible at home for the Instruction of his Family, which he carry'd me to see.  To speak the Truth, the first time that I gave it a Reading, which was dispatch'd in a very little time, I took it for an ill-concerted Romance, to which however I gave the Name of Sacred Stories. The Book of _Genesis_ seem'd to me to be meer Fiction; the _Jewish Law_ and _Ceremonies_ a Medley of Trifles and Childish Vanities; the _Prophesies_ an Abyss of Obscurities, and the most ridiculous Nonsense; and the _Gospel_ a pious Fraud, invented to cajole silly Women, and captivate the Vulgar. What shock'd me first of all was to find, that in the Work of the Creation there was Light, before the Luminaries which produce it, and without which all wou'd be Darkness and Obscurity. Then I boggled at the Fatal Necessity Man was laid under to labour and die, as a pretended Consequence of his Crime. Afterwards I reflected on the Sentence pass'd upon the Woman, to bring forth Children in Sorrow, and that on the Serpent, to creep on its Belly, as if before it had Legs. The Rainbow, which was plac'd in the Clouds after the Deluge, to dispossess Mankind of the Fear of perishing by a second Flood: The Favour granted by Heaven to _Lot_, to depart out of _Sodom_, that he might be at liberty to go immediately and commit a double Incest with his Daughters: The Amours of _Pharaoh_ and of _Sarah_ the Wife of _Abraham_; and the Rape committed on her, when she was a decrepid old Woman, by _Abimelech_ King of _Gerar_: The frequent Dialogues between the Creature and his Creator: The Passage over the _Red Sea_, and the many other Miracles wrought for the _Jews_: The Ass, whose Mouth was open'd to say so little to the Purpose; and a thousand other Difficulties of the same Nature, puzzled my Reason to a prodigious Degree. I cou'd not comprehend how Effects cou'd precede their Causes. I had been so often taught the contrary in the Schools, and daily Experience had so many times confirm'd this Truth to me in the Works of Nature, that I did not care so much as once to think of it. I thought it altogether as absurd to suppose"]]]
