In this investigation _Rubus_ seeds (blackberries or raspberries) are always reckoned as cultivated fruit, though probably most often wild. Besides fruit, a few seeds and rose haws were found, which with a little rubbish complete the vegetable food (40.41 per cent).  Following is a list of fruits, seeds, etc., identified and the number of stomachs in which found:     Yew berries (_Taxus minor_)                   1   False Solomon's seal (_Smilacina racemosa_)   1   Bayberries (_Myrica carolinensis_)            1   Mulberries (_Morus_ sp.)                     10   Spiceberries (_Benzoin æstivale_)             5   Currants (_Ribes_ sp.)                        1   Mountain ash (_Pyrus americanus_)             2   Service berries (_Amelanchier canadensis_)    2   Blackberries or raspberries (_Rubus_ sp.)    17   Rose haws (_Rosa_ sp.)                        1   Wild black cherries (_Prunus serotina_)       1   Chokecherries (_Prunus virginiana_)           7   Domestic cherries (_Prunus cerasus_)          4   Croton (_Croton_ sp.)                         1   American holly (_Ilex opaca_)                 2   Woodbine berries (_Psedera quinquefolia_)     1   Frost grapes (_Vitis cordifolia_)             4   Wild sarsaparilla (_Aralia nudicaulis_)       1   Flowering dogwood (_Cornus florida_)          3   Rough-leaved cornel (_Cornus asperifolia_)    4   Dogwood (_Cornus_ sp.)                        1   Black gum (_Nyssa sylvatica_)                 1   Huckleberries (_Gaylussacia_ sp.)             1   Blueberries (_Vaccinium_ sp.)                 6   French mulberry (_Callicarpa americana_)      1   Black elderberries (_Sambucus canadensis_)    1   Other elderberries (_Sambucus_ sp.)           3   Fruit pulp not further identified            12   Of the two stomachs not included in the foregoing discussion, the one taken in Florida in January contained 93 per cent of wild fruit and 7 per cent of weevils, wasps, and spiders; the one collected in Alabama in February was entirely filled with animal food, of which 88 per cent was caterpillars, 5 per cent May beetles, 6 per cent bugs, and 1 per cent spiders.  _Summary._--The animal food of the wood thrush includes remarkably few useful insects and contains some very harmful ones, as the Colorado potato beetle and many of the Scarabæidæ, the larval forms of which are the well-known white grubs which are a pest to agriculture in preying upon roots of plants. The vegetable portion of the food contains a small quantity of cultivated fruit, but observation shows that the thrush is in the habit of picking up fallen fruit instead of taking it fresh from the tree. The eating of wild fruit has no economic interest except that it serves to distribute the seeds of many shrubs and trees. There is no occasion to discriminate against this bird in any way. It should be rigidly protected.     VEERY AND WILLOW THRUSH.  (_Hylocichla fuscescens fuscescens_ and _Hylocichla fuscescens salicicola_.)   The veery is distributed over the eastern portion of the United States during migration and breeds in the Northern States as far south as Pennsylvania, and in New England and Canada. In winter it disappears almost entirely from the country, only a few remaining in Florida and perhaps in other Southern States. Its western representative is the willow thrush. Like other thrushes, birds of this species are shy and retiring in disposition, keeping for the most part in the shade of woods or bushy swamps, or building nests in a damp ravine with a brook gurgling past. They have been known, however, to visit orchards and sometimes gardens which are not kept too trim. It is thus evident that the food has little direct economic interest, as this bird does not come in contact with the farmer's crops.  For investigating the food of the species 176 stomachs were available. They were collected during the seven months from April to October, and represent 18 States, the District of Columbia, and Canada. The food separates into 57.27 per cent of animal matter and 42.73 per cent of vegetable. The former consists mostly of remains of insects, and the latter of fruit.  _Animal food._--Predacious ground beetles (Carabidæ) amount to 0.82 per cent. They are evidently not a preferred food. Beetles in general comprise 14.67 per cent of the food, but no family or other group appears to be distinguished except the Carabidæ, which are conspicuous by their absence. Weevils, or snout beetles, amount to 2.49 per cent, and one stomach contained a specimen of the notorious plum curculio (_Conotrachelus nenuphar_). A number of other harmful beetles were noted, but none are so well known as the plum destroyer. Ants make up 10.35 per cent and are eaten with great regularity. Hymenoptera other than ants amount to only 3.26 per cent, but are eaten regularly throughout the season. Hemiptera (bugs) were eaten to a small extent (1.30 per cent) in the first four months, but they are not seen after July. Exactly the same may be said of Diptera, which total only 0.85 per cent.  Lepidoptera (caterpillars) are, next to Hymenoptera, the favorite insect food. They were eaten in goodly quantities in every month except October. The average for the season is 11.91 per cent. Grasshoppers appear to some extent in every month except April, the greatest consumption taking place in October (24 per cent), but as only small numbers are eaten in the earlier months the aggregate for the year is only 4.91 per cent. A few other insects of various orders amount to 0.98 per cent. Spiders (6.34 per cent) are eaten regularly and constantly through the season, except that none were taken in October. A few sowbugs, snails, etc. (2.70 per cent), complete the quota of animal food. Following is a list of insects identified and the number of stomachs in which found:     HYMENOPTERA.    _Tiphia inornata_                 1    COLEOPTERA    _Elaphrus ruscarius_              1   _Anisodactylus harrisi_           1   _Anisodactylus_ sp                1   _Pterostichus lucublandus_        1   _Hydrobius fuscipes_              1   _Ips fasciata_                    1   _Byrrhus murinus_                 1   _Dolopius lateralis_              2   _Limonius æger_                   1   _Corymbites cylindriformis_       1   _Corymbites spinosus_             1   _Corymbites tarsalis_             1   _Corymbites hieroglyphicus_       1   _Podabrus flavicollis_            1   _Telephorus bilineatus_           2   _Telephorus_ sp                   1   _Onthophagus_ sp                  2   _Atænius cognatus_                1   _Aphodius_ sp                     3   _Dichelonycha_ sp                 2   _Serica sericea_                  1   _Lachnosterna hirticula_          1   _Lachnosterna_ sp                13   _Chrysomela pulchra_              3   _Chlamys plicata_                 1   _Typophorus canellus_             1   _Graphops simplex_                1   _Graphops_ sp                     1   _Calligrapha philadelphica_       1   _Œdionychis quercata_             1   _Microrhopala vittata_            1   _Hormorus undulatus_              1   _Phyxelis rigidus_                1   _Otiorhynchus ovatus_             1   _Neoptochus adspersus_            1   _Cercopeus chrysorrhœus_          2   _Barypithes pellucidus_           2   _Sitones_ sp                      2   _Phytonomus nigrirostris_         2   _Conotrachelus nenuphar_          1   _Conotrachelus posticatus_        1   _Tyloderma_ sp                    1   _Monarthrum mali_                 1   _Xyloteres politus_               1    DIPTERA.    _Bibio_ sp                        1   _Vegetable food._--The vegetable portion of the food of the species is made up of fruit, with a few seeds and a little miscellaneous matter more or less accidental. Fruit collectively amounts to 35.30 per cent, of which 12.14 per cent was thought to be of cultivated varieties and so recorded, while the remainder, 23.16 per cent, was quite certainly of wild species. This percentage of cultivated fruit is more than three times the record of the wood thrush, while the wild fruit eaten is correspondingly less, as the sum total of the fruit consumed is very nearly the same with both birds. From this percentage of domestic fruit one might infer that the veery was, or might be, a serious menace to fruit growing, but no such complaints have been heard, and it is probable that the species is not numerous enough to damage cultivated crops. A close inspection, however, of the fruit eating of the veery removes all doubts. The cultivated fruit, so called, was in every case either strawberries or _Rubus_ fruits, i. e., blackberries or raspberries, and as both of these grow wild and in abundance wherever the veery spends its summer, it is probable that all of the fruit eaten was taken from wild plants, though 12.14 per cent has been conventionally recorded as cultivated.  Besides fruit, the veery eats a few seeds of grasses and weeds and a few of sumac, but none of the poisonous species were found in the stomachs. These seeds (7.25 per cent of the food) were eaten so irregularly as to suggest that they are merely a makeshift taken for want of something better. Rubbish (0.18 per cent), consisting of decayed wood, bits of leaves, plant stems, etc., completes the vegetable food.  Following is a list of the items of vegetable food and the number of stomachs in which found:     Yew berries (_Taxus minor_)                        1   Pigeon grass seed (_Chætochloa_ sp.)               1   Rush grass seed (_Sporobolus minor_)               1   False Solomon's seal (_Smilacina_ sp.)             1   Greenbrier berries (_Smilax_ sp.)                  2   Hackberries (_Celtis occidentalis_)                1   Poke berries (_Phytolacca decandra_)               3   Spice berries (_Benzoin æstivale_)                 2   Service berries (_Amelanchier canadensis_)         3   June berries (_Amelanchier_ sp.)

It should not face a window, nor be in too strong a light, if that can be avoided, for a strong light will render the non-luminous flames, which are used in glass-blowing, almost invisible, and seriously inconvenience the operator, who cannot apply the various parts of the flames to his glass with the degree of certainty that is necessary; neither can he perceive the condition of the glass so correctly in a strong light, for though in many operations the glass-worker is guided by feeling rather than by seeing, yet sight plays a very important part in his proceedings.  My own blow-pipe is placed near a window glazed with opaque glass, which looks southwards, but is faced by buildings at a short distance. In dull weather the light obtained is good; but on most days I find it advantageous to shade the lower half of the window with a green baize screen. Some glass-blowers prefer gaslight to daylight.  The form of the table used is unimportant, provided that it is of a convenient height, and allows free play to the foot which works the blower underneath it. The blower should be _fixed_ in a convenient position, or it will get out of control at critical moments. The table, or that part of it which surrounds the blow-pipe, should be covered with sheet-iron to protect it from the action of the fragments of hot glass that will fall upon it. The tubes that supply air and gas to the blow-pipe should come from beneath the table, and may pass through holes cut for the purpose.  Many glass-blowers prefer to work at a rather high table, and sit on a rather high stool, so that they are well above their work. No doubt this gives extra command over the work in hand, which is often valuable. On the other hand, it is somewhat fatiguing. For a long spell of labour at work which is not of a novel character nor specially difficult, I am disposed to recommend sitting on a chair or low stool, at a table of such height as will enable the elbows to rest easily upon it whilst the glass is held in the flame. The precise heights that are desirable for the table and stool, and the exact position of the blow-pipe, will depend upon the height and length of arm of the individual workman, and it must therefore be left to each person to select that which suits him best. A moveable rest made of wood, for supporting the remote end of a long piece of glass tube a few inches above the table, whilst the other end is being heated in the flame, will be found convenient.   =The Blow-pipe.=--Formerly a lamp, in which sweet oil or tallow was burnt, was employed for glass-working, and such lamps are still occasionally used. Thus, lamps burning oil or tallow were used on board the _Challenger_ for hermetically sealing up flasks of water collected at various depths to preserve them for subsequent examination. I shall not, however, give an account of such a lamp, for the gas apparatus is so much more convenient for most purposes that it has now practically superseded the oil lamps. Fig. 1 shows a gas blow-pipe of exceedingly simple construction, which can be easily made, and with which good work can be done.  [Illustration: FIG. 1.]  The tube _A_ is of brass, and has a side tube _B_ brazed to it, ten to twelve centimetres from the end _E_, according to the dimensions of the tube. A tube of glass, _EC_, is fitted into _A_ by a cork at _D_. _B_ is connected to a supply of gas by a flexible tube, _C_ is similarly connected to the blower. By means of _CE_ a stream of air can be forced into gas burning at the mouth of the blow-pipe _G_, and various flames, with the characters described in a later section, can be produced with this instrument. For producing the pointed flame (Fig. 3, p. 9) the opening _E_ of the air-tube should be contracted to the size of a large knitting needle. For producing a flame of large size, rich in air (Fig. 4, p. 9), the internal diameter of _E_ may be nearly half as great as that of _A_ without disadvantage.  This blow-pipe may be fixed in position by the spike _F_, which will fit into holes in a block of wood or a large cork. Several of these holes in various positions should be made in the block, so that the position of the blow-pipe may be varied easily. Two taps must be provided in convenient positions near the edge of the table to enable the workman to regulate the supplies of air and gas. These taps should be fixed to the table and be connected with the gas and air supplies respectively on one side, and with the blow-pipe on the other, by flexible tubes. If blow-pipes of this kind be used, at least two of them should be provided; one of small dimensions for working on small tubes and joints, the other of larger size for operations on larger tubes. It will be convenient to have both of them ready for use at all times, as it is sometimes necessary to employ large and small flames on the same piece of work in rapid succession. By having several air-tubes of different sizes fitted to each blow-pipe, a greater variety of work may be done.  For the larger blow-pipe, the internal diameter of _A_ may be fifteen to seventeen millimetres.  For the smaller instrument, eleven millimetres for the diameter of _A_ would be a useful size.  When a slightly greater outlay can be afforded it will be most convenient to purchase the blow-pipe. They can be obtained of compact form, supported on stands with universal joints giving great freedom of movement, and with taps for regulating the supplies of gas and air, at comparatively small cost.  As figures of various blow-pipes can be seen in the price-lists of most dealers in apparatus, they are not given here. Their introduction would be of but little service, for the construction of that which is adopted can be readily ascertained by taking it to pieces. The simplest blow-pipe usually used for glass-working is that of Herapath. This has two taps to regulate the air and gas supplies respectively, and will give a considerable variety of flames, which will be discussed subsequently.  An excellent blow-pipe, made on the same principle as that shown in Fig. 1, but more substantially and with interchangeable jets, can be obtained from Messrs. Muller of Holborn for a moderate outlay.  Another very good blow-pipe is the Automaton blow-pipe of Mr. Fletcher of Warrington. In this, one tap regulates the supply both of air and gas, which is a great gain when difficult work is in hand. Automaton blow-pipes are made of two sizes. I have found that the larger size, with a powerful bellows, heats large pieces of lead glass very satisfactorily. On the other hand, the fine-pointed oxidising flame of the Herapath blow-pipe is, perhaps, the most suitable for working joints of lead glass. Therefore a good equipment would be a small Herapath blow-pipe and a large-sized Automaton. If only one blow-pipe is purchased it should be either a medium-sized Herapath, or the smaller Automaton, as those are most useful for general work.  Mr. Fletcher also makes an ingenious combination of two blow-pipes in which the gas and air supplies are regulated by a single lever-handle. This is very convenient, and gives flames that answer well with tubes made of soft soda glass, and it is very useful for general work. For use with lead glass the supply of air is rather too small, and does not enable one to get such good results. This can be easily amended, however. By slightly increasing the size of the air-tube of the smaller blow-pipe, and having increased the supply of air to the larger blow-pipe also, by reducing the external diameter of the end of the innermost tube, I now get medium-sized brush flames and pointed flames with this blow-pipe, that are equal to any I have used for heating lead glass.  For small laboratories the inexpensive No. 5 Bunsen burner of Mr. Fletcher, which is convertible into a blow-pipe, will be very useful.  Jets of several sizes to fit the air-tubes of blow-pipes may be obtained with them, and will serve for regulating the supply of air to the flame.   =The Bellows.=--The usual blowing apparatus is some form of foot-blower. These may be obtained fitted to small tables with sheet-iron tops. But a much less expensive apparatus is the large foot-blower made by Mr. Fletcher of Warrington, which can be used at an ordinary table or laboratory bench. Good foot-blowers can also be obtained from makers of furnace bellows.  No part of the glass-blower's equipment exceeds the bellows in importance. The best blower procurable should therefore be adopted. A bellows which, when used with a large blow-pipe, will not enable you to heat large pieces of lead glass tube to redness without blackening the glass when the directions for heating lead glass on pages 17-21 are followed, should on no account be received. I am told that at some places, where the water-supply is at very high pressure, it is utilised for working blow-pipes by means of the apparatus described below, and that some glass-workers find it advantageous to use such automatic blowers. But after a little practice, the effort of working the blower with the foot whilst manipulating the glass is not a source of serious inconvenience. Indeed, as it gives a certain degree of control over the flame without the use of the hands, the foot-blower is preferable. It is worth while to describe an automatic blower, however.   =Automatic Blower= (Fig. 2).--A strong glass tube _A_ is welded into a somewhat larger tube _B_ so that its end is about 2 mm. from the contraction at _G_. _B_ has a side tube _C_ joined to it. The narrow end of _B_ is fixed by an india-rubber cork to a strong bottle _D_ of two or three litres capacity. The india-rubber cork also carries an exit tube _E_, and _D_ is pierced near its bottom by a small hole at _F_.  [Illustration: FIG. 2]  In using the apparatus _A_ is connected with the water-supply, and water passing through _G_, carries air with it into _D_.
