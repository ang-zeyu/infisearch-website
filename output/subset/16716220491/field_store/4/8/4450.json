Squirrel came with his trunk, and Mr. Robin with his satchel and a hand bag, and Mr. Turtle with his things in a big sack. Mr. 'Coon ran down and let them all in and locked the door. Then he ran back to the window where Mr. Dog was.  \"If we'll let you down will you go home and not come around this hotel interfering with our business?\" says Mr. 'Possum.  \"Yes; will you promise not to try to get any of our guests away from us?\" says Mr. 'Coon.  [Illustration: HE CAUGHT IT AS HE WENT BY]  Mr. Dog couldn't talk much in the fix he was in, but he did the best he could, and promised yes to everything, so pretty soon they let the trunk down till his feet touched the ground and he could get his teeth out of the strap. Then he put out for home just about as fast as he could go, without so much as thanking them for letting him down, and up went Mr. Rabbit's trunk pretty quick, now that there were plenty to help.  Then the guests all hurried to their rooms to unpack, and Mr. Crow bustled around to get supper with what he had in the house, for Mr. 'Possum and Mr. 'Coon hadn't time yet to bring in anything. It was a pretty good supper, though, and all the guests said so, and said they knew what a good cook Mr. Crow was if he had things to work with, and the Crow said he guessed he could do his part if the 'Coon and 'Possum would do theirs.  Well, it makes a good deal of difference whether you're company at a house or a boarder. They all felt a good deal like company at first, but by the next evening at supper time they felt different. Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum had been out all day bringing in things, too, and Mr. Crow had been cooking harder than ever. Mr. Robin was first to make remarks. He said the cherries were canned, and not very good at that.  [Illustration: THE ARRIVAL OF THE OTHER GUESTS]  \"That's what I said,\" put in Mr. 'Coon, \"but Mr. 'Possum said you wouldn't know the difference.\"  \"Oh, he did, did he?\" says Mr. Robin. \"Well, I've got better cherries than these at home,\" and he got up from the table with a disgusted air.  Then Mr. Squirrel picked up some roasted nuts that the Crow had just brought in.  \"Where'd you get these nuts?\" he says, after he'd cracked one or two of them.  \"Down on the slope of Green Bushes,\" says Mr. 'Coon. \"Why, aren't they good ones?\"  \"I suppose they were once,\" says Mr. Squirrel--\"two or three years ago. Nuts have to be fresh to be good.\"  \"That's what I told him,\" says Mr. 'Possum, \"but he said you wouldn't know the difference.\"  \"Oh, he did, did he?\" says Mr. Squirrel. \"Well, I've got better nuts than these at home,\" and Mr. Squirrel _he_ got up and left the table.  Then Jack Rabbit began.  \"Where'd you get this salad?\" he says, turning up his nose.  \"Out by Mr. Man's back gate,\" says Mr. 'Possum. \"Why, isn't it good?\"  \"Might have been once,\" says Mr. Rabbit. \"I s'pose it's some Mr. Man threw out because it was wilted.\"  \"That's what I told him,\" says Mr. 'Coon, \"but he said you wouldn't know the difference.\"  \"Oh, he did, did he? Well, I've got better salad than this at home,\" and Jack Rabbit _he_ got up and he left the table.  And then, pretty soon, Mr. Turtle made a face over the fish because they were salt mackerel and not nice fresh fish, such as he was used to at home. So he got up and left the table, too, and there sat the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old Black Crow all by themselves and looking cheap enough to fall through the floor. Mr. Crow said it wasn't his fault, and then Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum commenced to blame it on each other, and nearly got into a fight. They were just about to fight when Mr. Crow happened to think of something. Mr. Crow always did think of things.  \"I'll tell you!\" he says. \"We'll just rent rooms.\"  \"Do what?\" says Mr. 'Possum and Mr. 'Coon together.  \"Why, just rent each of our guests his room and let him take his meals out. Then we won't have any work.\"  \"Whoop-ee!\" says Mr. 'Possum and Mr. 'Coon both together, as loud as ever they could. That made all the guests come running back, and when they heard the new plan they all said it was just the thing.  So then Mr. 'Possum went down and got the sign and brought it up and changed it to read:--          THE HOLLOW TREE INN.         FURNISHED ROOMS ONLY.  And that was how business began at last in the Hollow Tree.     A DEEP WOODS FISHING PARTY  AN ADVENTURE WITH MR. DOG AND A VERY LARGE FISH   ONE warm, still June morning (this, of course, was before the Hollow Tree Inn started) Mr. Jack Rabbit looked out of the window while he was dressing and thought to himself that it would be just the very morning for fish to bite.  Jack Rabbit liked to fish better than anything, almost, so right after breakfast he took an empty tomato can and went out in the back yard and turned over boards till he had the can about half full of bait, with a little dirt thrown on top. Then he reached up under the eaves of the smoke-house and pulled out a long cane pole with a line and hook and floater on it, all rigged up ready, and flung it over his shoulder and started.  Mr. Rabbit walked pretty fast--even lazy folks do that when they go fishing, and Mr. Jack Rabbit wasn't lazy, by a good deal. So pretty soon he came to the Hollow Tree, and there, looking out of an up-stairs window, he saw the 'Coon, the 'Possum, and the Old Black Crow.  \"Hello, up there!\" he said. \"Don't you fellows want to go fishing?\"  Mr. 'Possum said he thought fish would bite well on such a morning, and that he'd like to go first rate. Mr. 'Coon said he knew a place where you could pull them out as fast as you could throw in your hook, and he went on and told how he caught a fish there last year that would weigh more than four pounds, and lost him just as he got him to the top of the water. Mr. Crow said he'd always noticed that Mr. 'Coon's four-pound fish never got any nearer to him than the top of the water, and that for his part he didn't care much about fishing. He said, though, that if the 'Coon and the 'Possum wanted to go he'd stay at home and get dinner while they were gone, so's to have it ready when they all came home hungry. He told them that he had some nice canned salmon in the cupboard that he could catch 'most any time, and that if they really wanted fish for dinner he s'posed he might as well open it. Then they all laughed, and in about a minute down came Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum with their fishing things. Jack Rabbit said he had plenty of bait, so away they went. Mr. Crow sat up in the window and watched them off, and Mr. Robin, who happened along just then, laughed and called after them that he'd take a few pounds of nice bass when they got home. The Robin just said that to plague them, of course, and Mr. 'Coon called back that they'd fool him this time, and then he went on to remark that he'd never in his life seen a finer day for fishing.  Jack Rabbit said yes, that it was fine, and that it was a fine day for Mr. Dog to be out gallivanting over the country, too, and that they'd better hurry up and get to the lake and out in his boat before anything happened. That made Mr. 'Possum take a good deal livelier step, though he commenced to whistle and said he wasn't afraid of Mr. Dog, anyway. Mr. 'Coon said he'd always noticed that a fellow mostly whistled when he wasn't afraid, but for his part he couldn't get to that boat any too soon. And pretty soon they did get to it, and Mr. 'Possum was the first one to pile in, though Mr. Dog wasn't anywhere in sight.  [Illustration: WHEN THEY GOT OUT TO WHERE MR. 'COON SAID THE GOOD PLACE WAS, THEY ALL WENT TO FISHING]  Well, they pushed off, and Jack Rabbit took one oar and Mr. 'Coon the other, while the 'Possum sat on the back seat and baited his hook so's to catch the first fish. Then, when they got out to where Mr. 'Coon said the good place was, they all went to fishing, and Mr. 'Possum did get the first bite, but he didn't get anything else when he pulled. Mr. 'Coon told him he pulled too quick, and Jack Rabbit told him he didn't pull quick enough, and asked him if he expected the fish to climb out on his pole. Then Mr. Rabbit had a bite himself, and pulled and didn't get anything, either. Of course, that made Mr. 'Possum laugh, and then, all at once, the 'Coon had a great big bite that took his float away down out of sight the first grab.  Mr. 'Coon let him go for a minute and then gave a hard pull and commenced to call out that he had him this time and that he'd show Mr. Crow now about only getting fish to the top of the water and having canned salmon for dinner. Then he stood up in the boat and pulled as hard as ever he could till all of a sudden his line broke, and down he went backward, right on top of Mr. 'Possum, while the Rabbit swung his hook over where the 'Coon's hook had been and the big fish grabbed it before you could say Jack Robinson.  That was too bad for the 'Coon and the 'Possum, of course, and it wasn't as much fun for Jack Rabbit as you might suppose, for he couldn't get the big fish out to save his life, and he had to hold on to the boat to keep from being pulled into the lake. Then he called to the others to help him, and they both got up and took hold of the pole and hauled it in hand over hand till they got to the line, and that was as far as they could get. So Mr. Rabbit gave the line a twist or two around the iron ring in the front of his boat, and the big fish started straight for shore, dragging the boat and everybody in it behind him, just as hard as ever he could go. Then Mr. 'Coon and Jack Rabbit commenced to quarrel about whose fish it was, and Mr. 'Possum said he didn't care whose it was, he was getting a free ride, and he laid back and laughed and looked at the shore, when all of a sudden he happened to spy there, sitting on the end of a log, fishing and waiting for them, nobody but Mr. Dog himself.  That wasn't very much, of course, but it was plenty for Mr. 'Possum. He quit laughing and tumbled down in the bottom of the boat and laid there calling"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37363"],["title","Making Up with Mr. Dog (#2)"],["body","Jack Rabbit to cut that fish line or they'd all be chops and steaks and carried home in a basket in less than five minutes. Jack Rabbit did try to cut the line, too, but he was so excited he dropped his knife overboard, and Mr. 'Coon couldn't find his, and Mr. 'Possum didn't have any. So there they were, and there was Mr. Dog! Then Mr. Rabbit tried to bite the line off with his teeth, but he couldn't do that, either, for it was a big, strong line that he'd made himself, specially for large fish.  And all the time they were getting closer and closer to the shore, and Mr. Dog had lifted his line out of the water so it wouldn't be in his way, and was sitting there waiting, and smiling to see them come.  Then Jack Rabbit knew that something had to be done, and there was no time to lose. He was just about as scared as he could be, but he knew it wouldn't do any good to let on, so he sat up straight and smiled some, too, and looked at Mr. Dog and called out, big and friendly like:--  \"Hello, Mr. Dog! Here we come! Here we come with a nice dinner, Mr. Dog!\"  Then Mr. Dog laughed and called back:--  \"That's right, Mr. Rabbit. There's a sure enough nice dinner coming this time! Fish for the first course, Mr. Rabbit!\"  When Mr. 'Possum heard that he began to groan, and Jack Rabbit and Mr. 'Coon began to shiver, for each thought he knew pretty well what the next courses of Mr. Dog's dinner would be. But Mr. Rabbit didn't stop smiling or let on that he knew, and he called out again to Mr. Dog, quick:--  \"You'll have to help us if we have fish, Mr. Dog! He's a big one and you'll have to help us catch him!\"  And Mr. Dog called back again:--  \"Don't worry, Mr. Rabbit! I won't leave! I'll be on hand when you get here, Mr. Rabbit!\"  Then he rolled up his trousers a little and waded out into the shallow water, thinking he would nab Mr. Fish first and drag him out on shore, and then pull the boat right in after him.  Of course, that was a pretty good plan for Mr. Dog, only like some other good plans, it didn't work just as he expected it to. You see, he didn't quite know how big the fish was, nor how hard a big fish is to handle in shallow water. He made a quick grab at it when it got to him and then, right away, he had his hands full of business. That fish gave a flop with his tail that laid Mr. Dog over on his back and then another flop that set him on his feet again, and a side flop that smacked him against the water first one way and then the other, and made him breathe hard and choke and try to let go.  But Mr. Dog couldn't let go, for he'd got the fish line some way tangled in his teeth. So he began to snap and paw and swallow water, and fall down and get up again, and sprawl about in the swamp grass, trying to get back to shore.  [Illustration: THE FIGHT BETWEEN MR. DOG AND THE BIG FISH]  And while all this was going on Jack Rabbit and his friends had jumped out into the shallow water and took a little roundin's to shore, keeping out of Mr. Dog's way, and made tracks for the top of a hill, where they would be out of danger and see the fun at the same time. Then they all stood up there and watched the fight between Mr. Dog and the big fish, and Jack Rabbit sang out, as loud as ever he could:--  \"Don't leave, Mr. Dog! Stay with him, Mr. Dog! Hold him to it, Mr. Dog; you've got him! First course, Mr. Dog!\"  And Mr. Dog heard Jack Rabbit and got madder and madder every minute, till all of a sudden he got a lick on the side of the head from Mr. Fish's tail that made him see stars and broke the line. And away went the big fish out into deep water, while Mr. Dog crawled back to shore, wet and bruised from head to foot, and 'most dead.  Then Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum and Jack Rabbit, standing on top of the hill, gave a great big laugh, all together, and Mr. Rabbit called out:--  \"How did you like the first course, Mr. Dog?\"  That made them all laugh again, and then Mr. 'Coon called out:--  \"Are you ready for the second course, Mr. Dog?\"  And pretty soon Mr. 'Possum he called out:--  \"Are you ready for a nice roast now, Mr. Dog?\"  And that, of course, made them all laugh very loud, for Mr. 'Possum used slang now and then and meant by a \"roast\" that people would all make fun of Mr. Dog wherever he went; which they did, for a long time.  Even Mr. Robin, who was good friends with Mr. Dog, couldn't help calling out to him, now and then, as he went by:--  \"Are you ready for the next course, Mr. Dog?\"  And Mr. Dog would pretend not to hear and go hurrying by very fast, as if he were out on special and important business for Mr. Man.  [Illustration: LEANING OVER TO LIGHT HIS PIPE FROM MR. 'POSSUM'S]     MR. RABBIT EXPLAINS  AN EASTER STORY   \"WHY do we always have rabbits at Easter?\" asked the Little Lady. \"Is that a story, too?\"  The Story Teller lit his pipe, thinking all the time, and pretty soon he said: \"Why, yes, there is a story about that, and it goes this way\":--  One afternoon in the early spring Mr. Jack Rabbit and his friends were out for an airing. The Hollow Tree people were along, and Mr. Turtle, as usual. By and by they came to a log under a big tree and sat down for a smoke and talk. They talked about the weather at first and other things, till somebody mentioned Easter. Then they all had something to say about that.  \"What I object to,\" says Mr. Rabbit, when it came his time to talk, \"is this thing of people always saying that the Easter eggs belong to me.\"  \"Oh, but that's just a joke,\" says Mr. 'Coon, laughing.  \"I know it's just a joke, of course, but it's a pretty old joke, and I'm tired of it,\" says Jack Rabbit.  \"How did it get started anyway?\" asked Mr. 'Possum.  Then Mr. Rabbit took his pipe out of his mouth and leaned forward a little, so he could talk better.  \"I tell you how it got started,\" he says, \"and after that I don't want to hear any more of it. This is how it happened:--  [Illustration: THEY CAME TO A LOG UNDER A BIG TREE AND SAT DOWN FOR A SMOKE AND TALK]  \"Once upon a time, as much as twenty grandmothers back, I should think, there was a very nice family of Rabbits that lived in a grassy place on a hillside back of a big farmyard. There was quite a hole in the ground there, and they had a cozy home in it, and a soft bed for their little folk.  \"Now, every bright morning, Father and Mother Rabbit used to take the children out for a walk, and for a few lessons in running and hiding from Mr. Dog, who bothered about a good deal, and one day as they were coming home they heard a great cackling, and when they got to their house there was a nice fresh egg lying right in the children's bed. Some old hen from the farmyard had slipped in and laid it while they were gone. A good many hens, especially old hens, like to hide their nests that way, and this was one of that kind.  \"Well, of course all the young Rabbits claimed it, and Mother Rabbit at last gave it to the smallest and weakest one of the children, a little girl, who was always painting things with the juice of flower petals. And the very first thing that little girl did was to stain that egg all over with violet juice, not thinking what trouble it was going to cause our family forever after.  [Illustration: THEY HAD A COZY HOME AND A SOFT BED FOR THEIR LITTLE FOLK]  \"It was a nice blue egg when she got through with it, and the next day, when they all came back from their walk again there was another white egg right by it. The old hen had been there again and laid another while they were gone. The second little girl claimed that egg, of course, and she painted it a bright yellow with buttercup juice. Then the next day there was another egg, and the next day there was another egg, and the next day there was another egg, until there was one apiece for every one of the children, and some over.  \"And they all painted them. Some painted theirs pink or red with rose leaves or japonica, some painted them yellow with buttercups, and some blue or purple with violets, as the first little girl had done. They had so many at last that it crowded them out of their bed and they had to sleep on the floor.  [Illustration: A FEW LESSONS IN RUNNING AND HIDING]  \"And then, one Sunday, and it must have been Easter Sunday, they all went out walking again, and when they came back every one of those beautiful colored eggs was gone. The children cried and made a great fuss, but it was no use. Some of Mr. Man's boys out hunting hens' nests had found them and taken them all home with them.  \"And of course all those colored eggs set Mr. Man to wondering, and he came with his boys to the place where they had found them; and when they looked in out jumped the whole Rabbit family, helter skelter in every direction.  \"And right then,\" said Mr. Rabbit, leaning over to light his pipe from Mr. 'Possum's, \"right then Mr. Man declared those colored eggs were rabbit eggs, and he's kept on saying so ever since, though he knows better, and he knows I don't like it. He takes eggs and colors them himself now, and makes believe they're mine, and he puts my picture all over things about Easter time. I suppose he thinks I don't care, but I do, and I wish that little Miss Rabbit twenty grandmothers back had left that old hen's egg white as she found it.\"  [Illustration: IT WAS A NICE BLUE EGG WHEN SHE GOT THROUGH WITH IT]  \"It's too bad,\" says Mr. Crow. \"It's like that story they tell about the fox making me drop the cheese.\"  \"Or like Mr. Man making believe that the combs he uses are really made out of my shell,\" says Mr. Turtle.  Mr. 'Coon and Mr. 'Possum shook their heads. They had their troubles, too.     THE HOLLOW TREE POETRY CLUB  HOW MR. DOG CAME TO A POETRY CLUB, AND WHAT HAPPENED   ONCE upon a time, when it was getting along toward fall in the Hollow Tree, when Jack Rabbit and Mr. Robin and the others had come to live with the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old Black Crow, there began to be long evenings, and the Hollow Tree people used to think of new ways to pass the time.
