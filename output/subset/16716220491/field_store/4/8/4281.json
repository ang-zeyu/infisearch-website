The two hauls to be counted were chosen prior to each collection from a table of random numbers. Additional selective seining was done to ascertain the habitats occupied by different species.  _Trap, Hoop, and Fyke Nets._--Limited use was made of unbaited trapping devices: wire traps 2.5 feet in diameter, six feet long, covered with one-inch-mesh chicken wire; hoop nets 1.5 feet to three feet in diameter at the first hoop with a pot-mesh of one inch; and a fyke net three feet in diameter at the first hoop, pot-mesh of one inch with wings three feet in length. All of these were set parallel to the current with the mouths downstream. The use of trapping devices was abated because data obtained were not sufficient to justify the effort expended.   _Gill Nets_  Gill-netting was done mostly in 1959 at the lower Neosho station. Use of gill nets was limited because frequent slight rises in the river caused nets to collect excessive debris, with damage to the nets.  Gill nets used were 125 feet long, six feet deep, with mesh sizes of 3/4 inch to 2-1/2 inches. Nets, weighted to sink, were placed at right angles to the current and attached at the banks with rope.   _Sodium Cyanide_  Pellets of sodium cyanide were used infrequently to collect fish from a moderately fast riffle over gravel bottom that was overgrown with willows, making seining impossible. The pellets were dissolved in a small amount of water, a seine was held in place, and the cyanide solution was introduced into the water a short distance upstream from the seine, causing incapacitated fish to drift into the seine. Most of these fish that were placed in uncontaminated water revived.   _Rotenone_  Rotenone was used in a few small pools in efforts to capture complete populations. This method was used to check the validity of other methods, and to reduce the possibility that rare species would go undetected. Rotenone was applied by hand, and applications were occasionally supplemented by placing rotenone in a container that was punctured with a small hole and suspended over the water at the head of a riffle draining into the area being poisoned. This maintained a toxic concentration in the pool for sufficient time to obtain the desired kill. Rotenone acts more slowly than cyanide, allowing more of the distressed fish to rise to the surface.   _Dyes_  Bismark Brown Y was used primarily at the upper Neosho station to stain large numbers of small fish. The dye was used at a dilution of 1:20,000. Fishes were placed in the dye-solution for three hours, then transferred to a live-box in midstream for variable periods (ten minutes to twelve hours) before release.   _Determination of Abundance_  In the accounts of species that follow, the relative terms \"abundant,\" \"common,\" and \"rare\" are used. Assignment of one of these terms to each species was based on analysis of data that are presented in Tables 9-16, (pages 402, 403, 404, 405, 408, 410, 411, 414-415, and 416). The number of fish caught per unit of effort with the shocker (Table 10) and with seines (Table 11) constitute the main basis for statements about the abundance of each species at all stations except the upper Neosho station. Species listed in each Table (10 and 11) are those that were taken consistently by the method specified in the caption of the table; erratically, but in large numbers at least once, by that method; and those taken by the method specified but not the other method.  For the species listed in Table 10, the following usually applies: abundant=more than three fish caught per hour; common=one to three fish caught per hour; rare=less than one fish caught per hour.  Tables 12-16 list all fish obtained at the upper Neosho station by means of the shocker, seines, and rotenone.   _Names of Fishes_  Technical names of fishes are those that seem to qualify under the International Rules of Zoological Nomenclature. Vernacular names are those in Special Publication No. 2 (1960) of the American Fisheries Society, with grammatical modifications required for use in the University of Kansas Publications, Museum of Natural History.     ANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES   #Lepisosteus osseus# (Linnaeus)  Long-nosed Gar  The long-nosed gar was abundant at the lower and middle Neosho stations and the lower Marais des Cygnes station. Numbers increased slightly in the period of study, probably because of increased, continuous flow. The long-nosed gar was not taken at the upper Neosho station. At lower stations the fish occurred in many habitats, but most commonly in pools where gar often were seen with their snouts protruding above the water in midstream. Gar commonly lie quietly near the surface, both by day and by night, and are therefore readily collected by means of the shocker. Twice, at night, gar jumped into the boat after being shocked.  Young-of-the-year were taken at the middle and lower stations on both the Neosho and Marais des Cygnes rivers, and all were near shore in quiet water. Many young-of-the-year were seined at the lower Neosho station on 18 June 1959, near the lower end of a gravel-bar in a small backwater-area having a depth of one to three inches, a muddy bottom, and a higher temperature than the mainstream. Forty-three of these young gar averaged 2.1 inches in total length (T.L.).  Comparison of sizes of long-nosed gar taken by means of the shocker and gill nets at the lower and middle Neosho stations revealed that: the average size at each station remained constant from 1957 to 1959; the average size was greater at the lower than at the middle station; and, with the exception of young-of-the-year, no individual shorter than 13 inches was found at the middle station and only one shorter than 16 inches was taken at the lower station (Table 5).  Because collecting was intensive and several methods were used, I think that the population of gars was sampled adequately. Wallen (_Fishes of the Verdigris River in Oklahoma_, 1958:29 [mimeographed copy of dissertation, Oklahoma State University]) took large individuals in the mainstream of the Verdigris River in Oklahoma and small specimens from the headwaters of some tributaries. Because I took young-of-the-year at the lower Neosho station, it is possible that long-nosed gar move upstream when small and then slowly downstream to the larger parts of rivers as the fish increase in size. This pattern of size-segregation, according to size of river, merits further investigation.  Ripe, spent, and immature long-nosed gar (38 males and 10 females) were taken in three gill nets, set across the channel, 150 to 500 yards below a riffle, at the lower Neosho station on June 16, 17, and 18, 1959. On 23 June, 1959, 12 males and two females were taken in gill nets set 50, 150, and 400 yards above the same riffle. Operations with the shocker between 24 June and 10 July, 1959, yielded 29 males and three females. The fish were taken from many kinds of habitat in a three-mile section of the river.  Direction of movement as recorded from gill nets shows that of 67 gar taken, 45 had moved downstream and 22 upstream into the nets. Only ten of the above gar were taken from the nets set above the riffle; six of the ten were captured as they moved downstream into the nets.  On one occasion I watched minnows swimming frantically about, jumping out of the water, and crowding against the shore, presumably to avoid a long-nosed gar that swam slowly in and out of view. I have observed similar activity when gar fed in aquaria. Stomachs of a few gar from the Neosho River were examined and found to contain minnows and some channel catfish.  Long-nosed gar have a relatively long life span (Breder, 1936). This longevity and their ability to gulp air probably insure excellent survival through periods of adverse conditions. The population of long-nosed gar probably would not be drastically affected even in the event of a nearly complete failure of one or two successive hatches. Maturity is attained at approximately 20 inches, total length.  Collections at the middle Neosho station in 1958 indicate that the long-nosed gar is more susceptible to capture at night than in daytime (Table 9, p. 402).    TABLE 5.

In 1958 this species was taken at the lower station on the Marais des Cygnes and in 1958 and 1959 at the lower and middle stations on the Neosho. More common in the Neosho than the Marais des Cygnes, _L. platostomus_ occurs mainly in large streams and never was taken in the upper portions of either river. Although short-nosed gar were about equally abundant at the middle and lower stations on the Neosho, the average size was greater at the lower station (Table 6). This kind of segregation by size is shared with long-nosed gar, and was considered in the discussion of that species. Short-nosed gar were taken only in quiet water. Both species were collected most efficiently by means of gill nets and shocker. While shocking, I saw many gar only momentarily, as they appeared at the surface, and specific identification was impossible.

It was a Phocean vale; a gigantic cup filled with tranquillity. A spirit brooded over it, serene, majestic, immutable--like the untroubled calm which rests, the Burmese believe, over every place which has guarded the Buddha, sleeping.  At its eastern end towered the colossal scarp of the unnamed peak through one of whose gorges we had crept. On his head was a cap of silver set with pale emeralds--the snow fields and glaciers that crowned him. Far to the west another gray and ochreous giant reared its bulk, closing the vale. North and south, the horizon was a chaotic sky land of pinnacles, spired and minareted, steepled and turreted and domed, each diademed with its green and argent of eternal ice and snow.  And all the valley was carpeted with the blue poppies in wide, unbroken fields, luminous as the morning skies of mid-June; they rippled mile after mile over the path we had followed, over the still untrodden path which we must take. They nodded, they leaned toward each other, they seemed to whisper--then to lift their heads and look up like crowding swarms of little azure fays, half impudently, wholly trustfully, into the faces of the jeweled giants standing guard over them. And when the little breeze walked upon them it was as though they bent beneath the soft tread and were brushed by the sweeping skirts of unseen, hastening Presences.  Like a vast prayer-rug, sapphire and silken, the poppies stretched to the gray feet of the mountain. Between their southern edge and the clustering summits a row of faded brown, low hills knelt--like brown-robed, withered and weary old men, backs bent, faces hidden between outstretched arms, palms to the earth and brows touching earth within them--in the East's immemorial attitude of worship.  I half expected them to rise--and as I watched a man appeared on one of the bowed, rocky shoulders, abruptly, with the ever-startling suddenness which in the strange light of these latitudes objects spring into vision. As he stood scanning my camp there arose beside him a laden pony, and at its head a Tibetan peasant. The first figure waved its hand; came striding down the hill.  As he approached I took stock of him. A young giant, three good inches over six feet, a vigorous head with unruly clustering black hair; a clean-cut, clean-shaven American face.  “I'm Dick Drake,” he said, holding out his hand. “Richard Keen Drake, recently with Uncle's engineers in France.”  “My name is Goodwin.” I took his hand, shook it warmly. “Dr. Walter T. Goodwin.”  “Goodwin the botanist--? Then I know you!” he exclaimed. “Know all about you, that is. My father admired your work greatly. You knew him--Professor Alvin Drake.”  I nodded. So he was Alvin Drake's son. Alvin, I knew, had died about a year before I had started on this journey. But what was his son doing in this wilderness?  “Wondering where I came from?” he answered my unspoken question. “Short story. War ended. Felt an irresistible desire for something different. Couldn't think of anything more different from Tibet--always wanted to go there anyway. Went. Decided to strike over toward Turkestan. And here I am.”  I felt at once a strong liking for this young giant. No doubt, subconsciously, I had been feeling the need of companionship with my own kind. I even wondered, as I led the way into my little camp, whether he would care to join fortunes with me in my journeyings.  His father's work I knew well, and although this stalwart lad was unlike what one would have expected Alvin Drake--a trifle dried, precise, wholly abstracted with his experiments--to beget, still, I reflected, heredity like the Lord sometimes works in mysterious ways its wonders to perform.  It was almost with awe that he listened to me instruct Chiu-Ming as to just how I wanted supper prepared, and his gaze dwelt fondly upon the Chinese busy among his pots and pans.  We talked a little, desultorily, as the meal was prepared--fragments of traveler's news and gossip, as is the habit of journeyers who come upon each other in the silent places. Ever the speculation grew in his face as he made away with Chiu-Ming's artful concoctions.  Drake sighed, drawing out his pipe.  “A cook, a marvel of a cook. Where did you get him?”  Briefly I told him.  Then a silence fell upon us. Suddenly the sun dipped down behind the flank of the stone giant guarding the valley's western gate; the whole vale swiftly darkened--a flood of crystal-clear shadows poured within it. It was the prelude to that miracle of unearthly beauty seen nowhere else on this earth--the sunset of Tibet.  We turned expectant eyes to the west. A little, cool breeze raced down from the watching steeps like a messenger, whispered to the nodding poppies, sighed and was gone. The poppies were still. High overhead a homing kite whistled, mellowly.  As if it were a signal there sprang out in the pale azure of the western sky row upon row of cirrus cloudlets, rank upon rank of them, thrusting their heads into the path of the setting sun. They changed from mottled silver into faint rose, deepened to crimson.  “The dragons of the sky drink the blood of the sunset,” said Chiu-Ming.  As though a gigantic globe of crystal had dropped upon the heavens, their blue turned swiftly to a clear and glowing amber--then as abruptly shifted to a luminous violet A soft green light pulsed through the valley.  Under it, like hills ensorcelled, the rocky walls about it seemed to flatten. They glowed and all at once pressed forward like gigantic slices of palest emerald jade, translucent, illumined, as though by a circlet of little suns shining behind them.  The light faded, robes of deepest amethyst dropped around the mountain's mighty shoulders. And then from every snow and glacier-crowned peak, from minaret and pinnacle and towering turret, leaped forth a confusion of soft peacock flames, a host of irised prismatic gleamings, an ordered chaos of rainbows.  Great and small, interlacing and shifting, they ringed the valley with an incredible glory--as if some god of light itself had touched the eternal rocks and bidden radiant souls stand forth.  Through the darkening sky swept a rosy pencil of living light; that utterly strange, pure beam whose coming never fails to clutch the throat of the beholder with the hand of ecstasy, the ray which the Tibetans name the Ting-Pa. For a moment this rosy finger pointed to the east, then arched itself, divided slowly into six shining, rosy bands; began to creep downward toward the eastern horizon where a nebulous, pulsing splendor arose to meet it.  And as we watched I heard a gasp from Drake. And it was echoed by my own.  For the six beams were swaying, moving with ever swifter motion from side to side in ever-widening sweep, as though the hidden orb from which they sprang were swaying like a pendulum.  Faster and faster the six high-flung beams swayed--and then broke--broke as though a gigantic, unseen hand had reached up and snapped them!  An instant the severed ends ribboned aimlessly, then bent, turned down and darted earthward into the welter of clustered summits at the north and swiftly were gone, while down upon the valley fell night.  “Good God!” whispered Drake. “It was as though something reached up, broke those rays and drew them down--like threads.”  “I saw it.” I struggled with bewilderment. “I saw it. But I never saw anything like it before,” I ended, most inadequately.  “It was PURPOSEFUL,” he whispered. “It was DELIBERATE. As though something reached up, juggled with the rays, broke them, and drew them down like willow withes.”  “The devils that dwell here!” quavered Chiu-Ming.  “Some magnetic phenomenon.” I was half angry at myself for my own touch of panic. “Light can be deflected by passage through a magnetic field. Of course that's it. Certainly.”  “I don't know.” Drake's tone was doubtful indeed. “It would take a whale of a magnetic field to have done THAT--it's inconceivable.” He harked back to his first idea. “It was so--so DAMNED deliberate,” he repeated.  “Devils--” muttered the frightened Chinese.  “What's that?” Drake gripped my arm and pointed to the north. A deeper blackness had grown there while we had been talking, a pool of darkness against which the mountain summits stood out, blade-sharp edges faintly luminous.  A gigantic lance of misty green fire darted from the blackness and thrust its point into the heart of the zenith; following it, leaped into the sky a host of the sparkling spears of light, and now the blackness was like an ebon hand, brandishing a thousand javelins of tinseled flame.  “The aurora,” I said.  “It ought to be a good one,” mused Drake, gaze intent upon it. “Did you notice the big sun spot?”  I shook my head.  “The biggest I ever saw. Noticed it first at dawn this morning. Some little aurora lighter--that spot. I told you--look at that!” he cried.  The green lances had fallen back. The blackness gathered itself together--then from it began to pulse billows of radiance, spangled with infinite darting swarms of flashing corpuscles like uncounted hosts of dancing fireflies.  Higher the waves rolled--phosphorescent green and iridescent violet, weird copperous yellows and metallic saffrons and a shimmer of glittering ash of rose--then wavered, split and formed into gigantic, sparkling, marching curtains of splendor.  A vast circle of light sprang out upon the folds of the flickering, rushing curtains. Misty at first, its edges sharpened until they rested upon the blazing glory of the northern sky like a pale ring of cold flame. And about it the aurora began to churn, to heap itself, to revolve.  Toward the ring from every side raced the majestic folds, drew themselves together, circled, seethed around it like foam of fire about the lip of a cauldron, and poured through the shining circle"]]]
