A common smith, who,       though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to make nails,       if, upon some particular occasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will       scarce, I am assured, be able to make above two or three hundred nails in       a day, and those, too, very bad ones. A smith who has been accustomed to       make nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a       nailer, can seldom, with his utmost diligence, make more than eight       hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several boys, under       twenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but that of       making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each of       them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of       a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same       person blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion,       heats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head,       too, he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into       which the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of       them much more simple, and the dexterity of the person, of whose life it       has been the sole business to perform them, is usually much greater. The       rapidity with which some of the operations of those manufactures are       performed, exceeds what the human hand could, by those who had never seen       them, be supposed capable of acquiring.            Secondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost       in passing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we       should at first view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very       quickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a       different place, and with quite different tools. A country weaver, who       cultivates a small farm, must lose a good deal of time in passing from       his loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades       can be carried on in the same workhouse, the loss of time is, no doubt,       much less. It is, even in this case, however, very considerable. A man       commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment       to another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom very keen and       hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some time he       rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering, and       of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather       necessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change       his work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty       different ways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always       slothful and lazy, and incapable of any vigorous application, even on the       most pressing occasions. Independent, therefore, of his deficiency in       point of dexterity, this cause alone must always reduce considerably the       quantity of work which he is capable of performing.            Thirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labour is       facilitated and abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is       unnecessary to give any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the       invention of all those machines by which labour is so much facilitated and       abridged, seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour.       Men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of       attaining any object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed       towards that single object, than when it is dissipated among a great       variety of things. But, in consequence of the division of labour, the       whole of every manâ€™s attention comes naturally to be directed towards some       one very simple object. It is naturally to be expected, therefore, that       some one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of       labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their       own particular work, whenever the nature of it admits of such improvement.       A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in which       labour is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common       workmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation,       naturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier       methods of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such       manufactures, must frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which       were the inventions of such workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken       their own particular part of the work. In the first fire engines {this was       the current designation for steam engines}, a boy was constantly employed       to open and shut alternately the communication between the boiler and the       cylinder, according as the piston either ascended or descended. One of       those boys, who loved to play with his companions, observed that, by tying       a string from the handle of the valve which opened this communication to       another part of the machine, the valve would open and shut without his       assistance, and leave him at liberty to divert himself with his       play-fellows. One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon       this machine, since it was first invented, was in this manner the       discovery of a boy who wanted to save his own labour.            All the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the       inventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. Many       improvements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the       machines, when to make them became the business of a peculiar trade; and       some by that of those who are called philosophers, or men of speculation,       whose trade it is not to do any thing, but to observe every thing, and       who, upon that account, are often capable of combining together the powers       of the most distant and dissimilar objects in the progress of society,       philosophy or speculation becomes, like every other employment, the       principal or sole trade and occupation of a particular class of citizens.       Like every other employment, too, it is subdivided into a great number of       different branches, each of which affords occupation to a peculiar tribe       or class of philosophers; and this subdivision of employment in       philosophy, as well as in every other business, improves dexterity, and       saves time. Each individual becomes more expert in his own peculiar       branch, more work is done upon the whole, and the quantity of science is       considerably increased by it.            It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different       arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a       well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the       lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own       work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every       other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to       exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or, what       comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He       supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they       accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general       plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of the society.            Observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or daylabourer in a       civilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of       people, of whose industry a part, though but a small part, has been       employed in procuring him this accommodation, exceeds all computation. The       woollen coat, for example, which covers the day-labourer, as coarse and       rough as it may appear, is the produce of the joint labour of a great       multitude of workmen. The shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the       wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the scribbler, the spinner, the weaver,       the fuller, the dresser, with many others, must all join their different       arts in order to complete even this homely production. How many merchants       and carriers, besides, must have been employed in transporting the       materials from some of those workmen to others who often live in a very       distant part of the country? How much commerce and navigation in       particular, how many ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers,       must have been employed in order to bring together the different drugs       made use of by the dyer, which often come from the remotest corners of the       world? What a variety of labour, too, is necessary in order to produce the       tools of the meanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated       machines as the ship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the       loom of the weaver, let us consider only what a variety of labour is       requisite in order to form that very simple machine, the shears with which       the shepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder of the furnace for       smelting the ore, the feller of the timber, the burner of the charcoal to       be made use of in the smelting-house, the brickmaker, the bricklayer, the       workmen who attend the furnace, the millwright, the forger, the smith,       must all of them join their different arts in order to produce them. Were       we to examine, in the same manner, all the different parts of his dress       and household furniture, the coarse linen shirt which he wears next his       skin, the shoes which "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],["title","Ducks and Geese (#1)"],["body","      Ducklings--Distinguishing the Sexes--Marketing the         Ducks--Diseases and Insect Pests.

According to the 1920 census there were 2,817,624 ducks in the United States with a valuation of $3,373,966. As compared with this the census for 1910 shows a slightly greater number of ducks, 2,906,525, but their value was considerably less being only $1,567,164. In the ten years between the census of 1900 and that of 1910 there was a decrease in the number of ducks of nearly 40%.  According to the 1920 census the more important duck raising states arranged in their order of importance were Iowa, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Missouri, Minnesota, Tennessee, Ohio, South Dakota, Indiana, Nebraska and Kentucky. The number reported for Iowa was 235,249 and for Kentucky 99,577. New England, the North Atlantic, the East North Central, the West North Central, the Mountain and the Pacific states showed an increase, while the South Atlantic, East South Central and West South Central states showed a decrease. In spite of the existence of quite a number of large commercial duck farms, the great bulk of ducks produced are those which come from the general farms where only small flocks are kept. Yet only a small proportion of farms have ducks on them. The comparatively small number of ducks is distributed over practically the entire United States, being more common in some sections than others, particularly along the Atlantic Coast and along the Pacific Coast, with fairly numerous flocks on the farms of the Middle West.  _Different Types of Duck Raising._ The conditions under which ducks are kept and the purpose for which they are kept fall under four heads: First, commercial duck raising for the production of duck meat; second, duck raising as a by-product of the general farm; third, duck raising for egg production; fourth, duck breeding for pleasure, exhibition or the sale of breeding stock.  _Opportunities for Duck Raising._ Undoubtedly the greatest opportunity for profitable duck growing lies under the first of these heads, namely, commercial duck raising. Where the conditions of climate, soil and land are favorable and where the location is good with respect to market there exists an excellent opportunity for one skilled in duck growing to engage in that business in an intensive manner for the purpose of putting on the market spring or green ducklings. Where these are in demand they bring a good price and since the output per farm is large they pay a good return even with a small margin of profit per pound.  The second greatest opportunity undoubtedly consists of duck raising as a by-product of the general farm. Where conditions are suitable, that is to say, where there is a considerable amount of pasture land easily accessible, and particularly where there is a stream or pond to which the ducks can have access, a small flock of ducks, say 10 or 12 females, can be kept to excellent advantage on the farm. The cost of maintaining them will not be great and they will not only provide a most acceptable variety in the form of duck meat and duck eggs for the farmers' table but they will also produce"]]]
