In large size of tympanic bullae and wider basisphenoid the specimen agrees with _acutus_, but otherwise is nearly as small as _jaliscensis_ to which it is here referred. Actually the specimen could, with almost equal propriety, be referred to either subspecies.      _Measurements._--The measurements of two males, Nos. 100184,     100182, and average and extreme measurements of five females,     are, respectively, as follows: Total length, 257, 267, 244     (230-251); length of tail, 130, 128, 122 (105-129); length of     hind foot, 32, 31, 31 (30-33); length of ear from notch, 16, 17,     15.3 (13.0-19); weight in grams, 71.5, 65.1, 50.8 (44.8-61.8);     greatest length of skull, 35.2, 34.9, 33.6 (32.7-34.2);     zygomatic breadth, 17.7, 17.5, 16.5 (16.1-17.1); interorbital     breadth, 8.4, 8.1, 7.8 (7.5-8.0); length of nasals, 15.1, 14.9,     14.0 (13.3-14.5); width of braincase, 15.9, 15.1, 15.0     (14.7-15.1); alveolar length of upper molariform tooth-row, 6.0,     6.0, 5.6 (5.5-5.9). The measurements were taken according to the     method of Goldman (N. Amer. Fauna, 34:10, 1911). Each of the     specimens of which measurements are given above is adult; the     transverse enamel fold has been obliterated in M1, is     represented by only an isolated lake in M2 (except in one female     where all trace of the fold has worn away) and is present in M3.      _Specimens examined._--Total, 16, all from Michoacán, Mexico,     and unless otherwise indicated in the University of California     Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy, as follows: 3 mi. NW Pátzcuaro,     6700 ft., 1; 2 mi. W Pátzcuaro, 7700 ft., 5; 2 mi. W Pátzcuaro,     6700 ft., 2; Pátzcuaro, 1 (U. S. Nat. Mus.); 5 mi.
