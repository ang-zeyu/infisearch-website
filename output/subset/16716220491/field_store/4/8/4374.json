On the morrow, being tired of killing, the people began to destroy, and this phase lasted a long time, it being less fatiguing to throw stones about than corpses.  All the convents, all the monasteries, all the houses of the priests and canons were attacked in turn; nothing was spared except the cathedral, before which axes and crowbars seemed to lose their power, and the church of Ste. Eugenie, which was turned into a powder-magazine.  The day of the great butchery was called \"La Michelade,\" because it took place the day after Michaelmas, and as all this happened in the year 1567 the Massacre of St.  Bartholomew must be regarded as a plagiarism.  But from this period, each flux and reflux bears more and more the peculiar character of the party which for the moment is triumphant; when the Protestants get the upper hand, their vengeance is marked by brutality and rage; when the Catholics are victorious, the retaliation is full of hypocrisy and greed.  The Protestants pull down churches and monasteries, expel the monks, burn the crucifixes, take the body of some criminal from the gallows, nail it on a cross, pierce its side, put a crown of thorns round its temples and set it up in the market-place--an effigy of Jesus on Calvary.  The Catholics levy contributions, take back what they had been deprived of, exact indemnities, and although ruined by each reverse, are richer than ever after each victory.      Mary Stuart marys10.txt or marys10.zip [Etext #2744]  Mary was a harmony in which the most ardent enthusiast for sculptured form could have found nothing to reproach.  This was indeed Mary's great and real crime: one single imperfection in face or figure, and she would not have died upon the scaffold.  Besides, to Elizabeth, who had never seen her, and who consequently could only judge by hearsay, this beauty was a great cause of uneasiness and of jealousy, which she could not even disguise, and which showed itself unceasingly in eager questions.  Unfortunately for her honour, Mary, always more the woman than the queen, while, on the contrary, Elizabeth was always more the queen than the woman, had no sooner regained her power than her first royal act was to exhume Rizzio, who had been quietly buried on the threshold of the chapel nearest Holyrood Palace, and to have him removed to the burial-place of the Scottish kings, compromising herself still more by the honours she paid him dead, than by the favour she had granted him living.       NISIDA nisid10.txt or nisid10.zip [Etext #2747]  The priests had already begun to sing the death hymn; the executioner was ready, the procession had set out, when Solomon the fisherman appeared suddenly on the threshold of the prison, his eyes aflame and his brow radiant with the halo of the patriarchs.  The old man drew himself up to his full height, and raising in one hand the reddened knife, said in a sublime voice, \"The sacrifice is fulfilled.  God did not send His angel to stay the hand of Abraham.\"  The crowd carried him in triumph!  [The details of this case are recorded in the archives of the Criminal Court at Naples.  We have changed nothing in the age or position of the persons who appear in this narrative.  One of the most celebrated advocates at the Neapolitan bar secured the acquittal of the old man.]       KARL LUDWIG SAND ksand10.txt or ksand10.zip [Etext #2745]  Fundamentally nothing is great, you see, and nothing small, when things are looked at apart from one another.      URBAIN GRANDIER ugran10.txt or ugran10.zip [Etext #2746]  Danger of driving the vanquished to despair.  Let fall from the height of his superiority a few of those disdainful words which brand as deeply as a red-hot iron.  The more absurd the reports, the more credence did they gain.  ....crowd of prejudices, which are sacred to the vulgar.  Fourneau having saluted Grandier, proceeded to carry out his orders, whereupon a judge said it was not sufficient to shave the body of the prisoner, but that his nails must also be torn out, lest the devil should hide beneath them.  Grandier looked at the speaker with an expression of unutterable pity, and held out his hands to Fourneau; but Forneau put them gently aside, and said he would do nothing of the kind, even were the order given by the cardinal-duke himself.      LA CONSTANTIN const10.txt or const10.zip [Etext #2749]  Madly in love, which is the same as saying that he was hopelessly blind, silly, and dense to everything around him.  It is singular how very clear-sighted we can be about things that don't touch us.  There in semi-isolation and despoiled of her greatness lived Angelique-Louise de Guerchi, formerly companion to Mademoiselle de Pons and then maid of honour to Anne of Austria.  Her love intrigues and the scandals they gave rise to had led to her dismissal from court.  Not that she was a greater sinner than many who remained behind, only she was unlucky enough or stupid enough to be found out.  Her admirers were so indiscreet that they had not left her a shred of reputation, and in a court where a cardinal is the lover of a queen, a hypocritical appearance of decorum is indispensable to success.  So Angelique had to suffer for the faults she was not clever enough to hide.      DERUES derue10.txt or derue10.zip [Etext #2748]  \"All passions,\" says La Bruyere,--\"all passions are deceitful; they disguise themselves as much as possible from the public eye; they hide from themselves.  There is no vice which has not a counterfeit resemblance to some virtue, and which does not profit by it.\"  The whole life of Derues bears testimony to the truth of this observation.  An avaricious poisoner, he attracted his victims by the pretence of fervent and devoted piety, and drew them into the snare where he silently destroyed them.  As soon as his head was covered, the executioner gave the signal.  One would have thought a very few blows would have finished so frail a being, but he seemed as hard to kill as the venomous reptiles which must be crushed and cut to pieces before life is extinct, and the 'coup de grace' was found necessary.  The executioner uncovered his head and showed the confessor that the eyes were closed and that the heart had ceased to beat.  The body was then removed from the cross, the hands and feet fastened together, and it was thrown on the funeral pile. While the execution was proceeding the people applauded.  On the morrow they bought up the fragments of bone, and hastened to buy lottery tickets, in the firm conviction that these precious relics would bring luck to the fortunate possessors!      THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK ironm10.txt or ironm.zip [Etext #2751]  Voltaire added a few further details which had been given him by M.  de Bernaville, the successor of M. de Saint-Mars, and by an old physician of the Bastille who had attended the prisoner whenever his health required a doctor, but who had never seen his face, although he had \"often seen his tongue and his body.\"  He also asserted that M. de Chamillart was the last minister who was in the secret, and that when his son-in-law, Marshal de la Feuillade, besought him on his knees, de Chamillart being on his deathbed, to tell him the name of the Man in the Iron Mask, the minister replied that he was under a solemn oath never to reveal the secret, it being an affair of state.  To all these details, which the marshal acknowledges to be correct, Voltaire adds a remarkable note: \"What increases our wonder is, that when the unknown captive was sent to the Iles Sainte-Marguerite no personage of note disappeared from the European stage.\"       JOAN OF NAPLES jonap10.txt or jonap10.zip [Etext #2750]  The next morning the people were beforehand with the executioner, loudly demanding their prey.  All the national troops and mercenaries that the judicial authorities could command were echelonned in the streets, opposing a sort of dam to the torrent of the raging crowd.  The sudden insatiable cruelty that too often degrades human nature had awaked in the populace: all heads were turned with hatred and frenzy; all imaginations inflamed with the passion for revenge; groups of men and women, roaring like wild beasts, threatened to knock down the walls of the prison, if the condemned were not handed over to them to take to the place of punishment: a great murmur arose, continuous, ever the same, like the growling of thunder: the queen's heart was petrified with terror.  That same evening the sentence, to the great joy of all, was proclaimed, that Joan was innocent and acquitted of all concern in the assassination of her husband.  But as her conduct after the event and the indifference she had shown about pursuing the authors of the crime admitted of no valid excuse, the pope declared that there were plain traces of magic, and that the wrong-doing attributed to Joan was the result of some baneful charm cast upon her, which she could by no possible means resist.      MARTIN GUERRE mguer10.txt or mguer10.zip [Etext #2752]  On the 10th of, August 1557, an inauspicious day in the history of France, the roar of cannon was still heard at six in the evening in the plains of St. Quentin; where the French army had just been destroyed by the united troops of England and Spain, commanded by the famous Captain Emanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy.  An utterly beaten infantry, the Constable Montmorency and several generals taken prisoner, the Duke d'Enghien mortally wounded, the flower of the nobility cut down like grass,--such were the terrible results of a battle which plunged France into mourning, and which would have been a blot on the reign of Henry II, had not the Duke of Guise obtained a brilliant revenge the following year.  This sentence substituted the gallows for the decapitation decreed by the first judge, inasmuch as the latter punishment was reserved for criminals of noble birth, while hanging was inflicted on meaner"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3617"],["title","Widger's Quotations from the Project Gutenberg Editions of Dumas' Celebrated (#2)"],["body",".       ALI PACHA alpac10.txt or alpac10.zip [Etext #2753]  Albania was one of the most difficult provinces to manage.  Its inhabitants were poor, brave, and, the nature of the country was mountainous and inaccessible.  The pashas had great difficulty in collecting tribute, because the people were given to fighting for their bread.  Whether Mahomedans or Christians, the Albanians were above all soldiers.  Descended on the one side from the unconquerable Scythians, on the other from the ancient Macedonians, not long since masters of the world; crossed with Norman adventurers brought eastwards by the great movement of the Crusades; they felt the blood of warriors flow in their veins, and that war was their element.  Sometimes at feud with one another, canton against canton, village against village, often even house against house; sometimes rebelling against the government their sanjaks; sometimes in league with these against the sultan; they never rested from combat except in an armed peace.  Each tribe had its military organisation, each family its fortified stronghold, each man his gun on his shoulder.  When they had nothing better to do, they tilled their fields, or mowed their neighbours', carrying off, it should be noted, the crop; or pastured their, flocks, watching the opportunity to trespass over pasture limits.  This was the normal and regular life of the population of Epirus, Thesprotia, Thessaly, and Upper Albania.      MURAT murat10.txt or murat10.zip [Etext #2755]  On the 18th June, 1815, at the very moment when the destiny of Europe was being decided at Waterloo, a man dressed like a beggar was silently following the road from Toulon to Marseilles.  Arrived at the entrance of the Gorge of Ollioulles, he halted on a little eminence from which he could see all the surrounding country; then either because he had reached the end of his journey, or because, before attempting that forbidding, sombre pass which is called the Thermopylae of Provence, he wished to enjoy the magnificent view which spread to the southern horizon a little longer, he went and sat down on the edge of the ditch which bordered the road, turning his back on the mountains which rise like an amphitheatre to the north of the town, and having at his feet a rich plain covered with tropical vegetation, exotics of a conservatory, trees and flowers quite unknown in any other part of France.      THE COUNTESS OF SAINT GERAN geran10.txt or geran10.zip [Etext #2754]  \"Could not, for instance,\" said the marquis, \"a confinement be effected without pain?\"  \"I don't know about that, but this I do\" know, that I shall take very good care not to practise any method contrary to the laws of nature.\"  \"You are deceiving me: you are acquainted with this method, you have already practised it upon a certain person whom I could name to you.\"  \"Who has dared to calumniate me thus?  I operate only after the decision of the Faculty.  God forbid that I should be stoned by all the physicians, and perhaps expelled from France!\"      MARQUISE DE BRINVILLIERS brinv10.txt or brinv10.zip [Etext #2756]  When the prayer was done and the doctor raised his head, he saw before him the executioner wiping his face.  \"Well, sir,\" said he, \"was not that a good stroke?  I always put up a prayer on these occasions, and God has always assisted me; but I have been anxious for several days about this lady.  I had six masses said, and I felt strengthened in hand and heart.\" He then pulled out a bottle from under his cloak, and drank a dram; and taking the body under one arm, all dressed as it was, and the head in his other hand, the eyes still bandaged, he threw both upon the faggots, which his assistant lighted.  \"The next day,\" says Madame de Sevigne, \"people were looking for the charred bones of Madame de Brinvilliers, because they said she was a saint.\"      MARQUISE DE GANGES gange10.txt or gange10.zip [Etext #2758]  The beginnings of this union were perfectly happy; the marquis was in love for the first time, and the marquise did not remember ever to have been in love.  A son and a daughter came to complete their happiness. The marquise had entirely forgotten the fatal prediction, or, if she occasionally thought of it now, it was to wonder that she could ever have believed in it.  Such happiness is not of this world, and when by chance it lingers here a while, it seems sent rather by the anger than by the goodness of God.  Better, indeed, would it be for him who possesses and who loses it, never to have known it.       VANINKA vanin10.txt or vanin10.zip [Etext #2757]  About the end of the reign of the Emperor Paul I--that is to say, towards the middle of the first year of the nineteenth century--just as four o'clock in the afternoon was sounding from the church of St.  Peter and St. Paul, whose gilded vane overlooks the ramparts of the fortress, a crowd, composed of all sorts and conditions of people, began to gather in front of a house which belonged to General Count Tchermayloff, formerly military governor of a fair-sized town in the government of Pultava.  The first spectators had been attracted by the preparations which they saw had been made in the middle of the courtyard for administering torture with the knout.  One of the general's serfs, he who acted as barber, was to be the victim.  Although this kind of punishment was a common enough sight in St. Petersburg, it nevertheless attracted all passers-by when it was publicly administered.  This was the occurrence which had caused a crowd, as just mentioned, before General Tchermayloff's house.
