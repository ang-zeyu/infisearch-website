Fresh supplies of air enter _B_ by _C_.   =Blow-pipe Flames=--_The Pointed Flame._--If the gas tap of a Herapath blow-pipe be adjusted so that comparatively little gas can pass, and if the foot-blower be then worked cautiously, a long tongue of flame ending in a fine point will be produced (Fig. 3). This flame will subsequently be described as the _pointed flame_. It should be quite free from luminosity, and as the amount of air necessary for securing a pointed flame is large, in proportion to the gas, there is excess of oxygen towards the end _C_. By adjusting the proportions of air and gas, pointed flames of various dimensions can be obtained with the same blow-pipe. The part of a pointed flame to be used in glass-working is the tip, or in some cases the space slightly beyond the tip.  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]  _The Brush Flame._--If a large supply of gas be turned on and a considerable blast of air sent into the flame, a non-luminous flame of great size will be obtained (Fig. 4). In form it somewhat resembles a large camel's hair pencil, and may conveniently be described as a _brush flame_. The chief advantage of a large-sized blow-pipe is, that with it a large brush flame may be produced, which is often invaluable. By gradually diminishing the supply of gas and air smaller brush flames may be produced.  The jet used to supply air to the Herapath blow-pipe is usually too fine, and consequently does not permit the passage of sufficient air to produce a brush flame that contains excess of oxygen, even with the aid of a very powerful blower. My own Herapath blow-pipe only gives a satisfactory oxidising brush flame when the jet is removed altogether from the end of the air-tube. For producing pointed flames the finer jet of the air-tube must be used, but when a highly oxidising flame of large size is required it must be removed. The internal diameter of the central air-tube should be nearly half as great as that of the outer or gas-supply tube. Fletcher's Automaton with the large air jet gives a very liberal supply of air, and produces an excellent oxidising brush flame. In the case of the larger-sized Automaton a consequence of this is, however, that when fitted with the large jet it will not give so good a pointed flame as the Herapath, which, in its turn, gives an inferior oxidising brush. By fitting finer jets to the air-tube of Fletcher's apparatus pointed flames can be secured when necessary.  _The Smoky Flame._--By turning on a very free supply of gas, and only enough air to give an outward direction to the burning gas, a smoky flame, chiefly useful for annealing and for some simple operations on lead glass, is produced.  The Gimmingham blow-pipe and Fletcher's combination blow-pipe, in addition to the above flames, are also adapted to produce a non-luminous flame, resembling that of the Bunsen gas-burner, which is very convenient for the preliminary heating of the glass, and also for gradually cooling finished apparatus. It is not necessary to describe the method of using these last-mentioned blow-pipes. With the more complicated of them directions for its use are supplied.  Mr. Madan has suggested the use of oxygen in place of air for producing the oxidising flame required for working lead glass, and to produce a flame of high temperature for softening tubes of hard, or combustion, glass. For the latter purpose the employment of oxygen may be adopted with great advantage. For working lead glass, however, it is quite unnecessary if the directions already given are followed.  The student's subsequent success will so largely depend upon his acquaintance with the resources of his blow-pipe, and on the facility with which he can take advantage of them, that no pains should be spared in the effort to become expert in its management as soon as possible. A few experiments should now be made, therefore, upon the adjustment of the flame, until the student is able to produce and modify any form of flame with promptness and certainty.  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]  The remaining apparatus used in glass-working consists of triangular and other files, charcoal pastils for cutting glass, pieces of sound charcoal of various diameters with conical ends; it is convenient to have one end somewhat less pointed than the other (Fig. 5). Corks of various sizes; the smallest, which are most frequently needed, should be carefully cut with sharpened cork borers from larger corks. Besides these there should be provided some freshly distilled turpentine in which camphor has been dissolved,[1] fine and coarse emery powder, and some sheets of cotton-wadding, an india-rubber blowing-bottle, glass tubes, a little white enamel, and a pair of iron tongs.  [1] Half an ounce of camphor to about six ounces of turpentine will do very well.     CHAPTER II.  _VARIETIES OF GLASS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT._   All the varieties of glass that are ordinarily met with contain silica (SiO_{2}) associated with metallic oxides. In a true glass there are at least two metallic oxides. The unmixed silicates are not suitable for the purposes of glass. They are not so capable of developing the viscous condition when heated as mixtures--some of them are easily attacked by water, and many of those which are insoluble are comparatively infusible. There is generally excess of silica in glass, that is, more than is necessary to form normal silicates of the metals present. The best proportions of the various constituents have been ascertained by glass-makers, after long experience; but the relation of these proportions to each other, from a chemical point of view, is not easy to make out.  The varieties of glass from which tubes for chemical glass-blowing are made may be placed under three heads, and are known as[2]--    Soft soda glass.   Also known as French glass.   Lead glass.        Also known as English glass.   Hard glass.  [2] For details of the composition of the various glasses, some work on glass-making may be consulted.  In purchasing glass tubes, it is well to lay in a considerable stock of tubes made of each of the two first varieties, and, if possible, to obtain them from the manufacturer, for it frequently happens that pieces of glass from the same batch may be much more readily welded together than pieces of slightly different composition. Yet it is not well to lay in too large a stock, as sometimes it is found that glass deteriorates by prolonged keeping.  As it is frequently necessary to make additions, alterations, or repairs to purchased apparatus, it is best to provide supplies both of soft soda glass and lead glass, for though purchased glass apparatus is frequently made of lead glass, yet sometimes it is formed from the soda glass, and as it is a matter of some difficulty to effect a permanent union between soda glass and lead glass, it is desirable to be provided with tubes of both kinds.  Many amateurs find that soda glass is in some respects easier to work with than lead glass. But, on the other hand, it is somewhat more apt to crack during cooling, which causes much loss of time and disappointment. Also, perhaps in consequence of its lower conductivity for heat, it very often breaks under sudden changes of temperature during work. If, however, a supply of good soda glass is obtained, and the directions given in this book in regard to annealing it are thoroughly carried out, these objections to the use of soda glass will, to a great extent, be removed. I find, however, that when every precaution has been taken, apparatus made of soda glass will bear variations of temperature less well than that made of lead glass. Therefore, although the comparatively inexpensive soda glass may be employed for most purposes without distrust, yet I should advise those who propose to confine themselves to one kind of glass, to take the small extra trouble required in learning to work lead glass.  In order to secure glass of good quality, a few pieces should be obtained as a sample, and examined by the directions given below. When the larger supply arrives, a number of pieces, taken at random, should be examined before the blow-pipe, to compare their behaviour with that of the sample pieces, and each piece should be separately examined in all other respects as described subsequently.  Hard glass is used for apparatus that is required to withstand great heat. It is difficult to soften, especially in large pieces. It should only be employed, therefore, when the low melting points of soda or lead glass would render them unsuitable for the purpose to which the finished apparatus is to be put. What is sold as Jena combustion tube should be preferred when this is the case.   =Characters of good Glass.=--Glass tubes for glass-blowing should be as free as possible from knots, air-bubbles, and stripes. They should be in straight pieces of uniform thickness, and cylindrical bore. It is not possible to obtain glass tubes of absolutely the same diameter from one end to the other in large quantities, but the variations should not be considerable.  When a sharp transverse scratch is made with a good file on a piece of tube, and the scratch is touched with a rather fine point of red-hot glass (this should be lead glass for a lead glass tube, and soda glass for a tube of soda glass), the crack which is started should pass round the glass, so that it may be broken into two pieces with regular ends. If the crack proceeds very irregularly, and especially if it tends to extend along the tube, the glass has been badly annealed, and should not be employed for glass-blowing purposes. It is important that the point of hot glass used shall be very small, however. Even good glass will frequently give an irregular fracture if touched with a large mass of molten glass.  Finally, glass tube which is thin and of small diameter should not crack when suddenly brought into a flame.

The species occurs in Nevada only near that state's western and northern boundaries. The range is therefore much different than it has been depicted heretofore, with the populations living east of the Continental Divide widely separated from those to the west for the entire length of the Rocky Mountains south of the Yellowstone National Park region. The populations of northern Utah, southern Idaho, and Nevada, which have been considered _parietalis_ are thus far removed from the main population of that subspecies to the east and are isolated from them by the barrier of the Continental Divide and arid regions farther west.  Although some of the records published for _Thamnophis sirtalis_ are erroneous, being based on misidentifications of other species, various outlying records, including those in western Kansas, the Panhandle of Texas, and southeastern New Mexico probably represent localized relict populations that have survived from a time when the species was more generally distributed in this region. The population of _T. sirtalis_ in the Río Grande drainage of New Mexico is geographically isolated and remote from other populations of the species. Except for a few isolated and highly localized populations the species is absent from the Republican, Smoky Hill, Arkansas, Cimarron, Canadian, Red, Brazos, Colorado and Pecos rivers and their tributaries west of the one hundredth meridian in the arid High Plains.  Streams in this region of High Plains are in most instances unsuitable habitats because they are in eroded channels, have a variable and uncertain water supply, and have poorly developed riparian communities. The marsh and wet meadow habitat preferred by _sirtalis_ in most parts of its range is almost absent. _T. radix_ and _T. marcianus_, well adapted to conditions in this region, perhaps provide competition that is limiting to _T. sirtalis_. However, several well-isolated populations of _sirtalis_ have survived as relicts in the southern Great Plains, presumably from a time several thousand years ago when mesic conditions were more prevalent, perhaps in an early postglacial stage.         *       *       *       *       *  Illustration: FIG. 1.

Records from Idaho and Wyoming are based on specimens in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History collection. Other records are based on Woodbury (1931) for Utah, Hudson (1942) for Nebraska, Maslin (1959) for Colorado, Smith (1956) for Kansas, R. G. Webb (MS) for Oklahoma, Brown (1950) and Fouquette and Lindsay (1955) for Texas, Cope (1900), Van Denburgh (1924), Little and Keller (1937) for New Mexico, and Smith and Taylor (1945) for Mexico.         *       *       *       *       *  Smith (1956:292) recorded _parietalis_ from three outlying stations in the western quarter of Kansas, from Wallace, Hamilton and Meade counties in the drainages of the Smoky Hill River, Arkansas River, and Cimarron River, respectively. Permanent springs in Meade County State Park perhaps account for the survival of an isolated colony there. Several specimens from that locality seen by Fitch in August, 1960, when recently collected by a University of Michigan field party, seemed to be of the Texas subspecies _annectens_, as their dorsal stripes were reddish orange, and markings on the dorsolateral area were pale yellow rather than red. Specimens from the Texas Panhandle, from Hemphill County (Brown, 1950:207) and nine miles east of Stinnet, Hutchison County (Fouquette and Lindsay, 1955:417) likewise are most nearly like _annectens_ judging from the authors' descriptions. The specimens from nine miles east of Stinnet averaged large; the two largest would have attained or slightly exceeded four feet in length if they had had complete tails. No _sirtalis_ so long as four feet has been recorded elsewhere.  Records are lacking from the drainages of the Republican, North Canadian, Brazos and Colorado River drainages in the High Plains, but possibly isolated populations occur in some of these also. The only record from the Pecos River drainage is that of Bundy (1951:314) from Wade's Swamp near Artesia, Eddy County, New Mexico. This locality is separated by some 140 miles from any other known station of occurrence.  From extreme southern Colorado south across New Mexico to the Mexican border _T. sirtalis_ occurs in continuous or nearly continuous populations in the Río Grande Valley, and has been recorded from many localities. It has been recorded from relatively few localities of tributary streams (Los Pinos, Abiqui, Santa Fe) all near the main valley. There is one record from the Ocate River, a headwaters tributary of the Canadian River, in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains near other localities in the Río Grande drainage. The southwestern-most known locality of occurrence is Casas Grandes in the Mexican state of Chihuahua some 130 miles southwest of El Paso, Texas, and near the Continental Divide. The Río Casas Grandes must have once been a tributary of the Río Grande, but now its desert drainage basin is isolated.   RE-DESCRIPTION OF A SUBSPECIES FROM NEW MEXICO  Most specimens of a population of _sirtalis_ occurring in New Mexico are recognizably different from most specimens of other populations. This New Mexican population is therefore here recognized as a distinct subspecies:  THAMNOPHIS SIRTALIS ORNATA Baird    _Eutaenia ornata_ Baird, 1859:16.   _Eutaenia sirtalis dorsalis_ Cope, 1900:1076.   _Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis_ (part) Van Denburgh, 1924:222.      _Type._--U. S. Nat. Mus. No. 960, obtained at El Paso, Texas,     at some time in the eighteen fifties by Col. J. D. Graham.      _Range._--Río Grande and vicinity, from Conejos and Costilla     counties in extreme south-central Colorado south across New     Mexico to Mexican border. Records from neighboring drainage     systems, Casas Grandes in Chihuahua and Artesia and Ocate     River in New Mexico, probably also pertain to _ornata_.      _Description._--A specimen in the University of New Mexico     Natural History Museum (E. D. Flaherty No. 560, obtained     one mile west and one-half mile south of Isleta, Bernalillo     County, New Mexico, on May 31, 1959) was described as     follows while its colors were still but little altered by     preservatives: Top of head olive, supralabials pale gray,     edged with black posteriorly; chin milky white, with dark     edges posteriorly on fifth, sixth and seventh infralabials;     dorsal stripe yellow; including middorsal row of scales and     little more than adjacent half of row on either side of it;     dorsolateral area olive-brown with row of black spots on its     lower half, these spots elliptical, averaging about size     of one scale on anterior part of body, smaller posteriorly;     adjacent spots separated by interspaces of approximately     their own length, irregular black markings on upper half     of dorsolateral area not forming definite spots but fused     longitudinally to form continuous black border to dorsal     stripe; crescent-shaped red markings in areas between scale     rows three to nine, these markings invading edges of scales,     and themselves having ill-defined edges blending into the     darker ground color; lateral stripe pale, yellowish gray,     limited to scale rows two and three for most of its length,     but including rows four and five in neck region; row of     irregular black marks low on each side, with each mark     centering on anterior part of lower half of scale of first     row but overlapping onto corners of adjacent ventrals;     approximately every other scale of first row so marked;     ventral surface pale, suffused with bluish tint; most of     ventrals marked on anterior edges with pair of semicircular     black spots, each situated about two-thirds of distance from     mid-line to lateral edge of ventral; these marks diminishing     in size and finally disappearing on posterior part of body;     ventral surface otherwise immaculate.      Lepidosis normal for genus and species, with preoculars single     on each side, supralabials 7-7, infralabials 8-8, ventrals     159, anal entire, subcaudals 77 (including terminal spine),     paired except for second, third and fourth; scale rows 19     from neck slightly beyond mid-body, fifth on left side ending     opposite 86th ventral; length from snout to vent 670 mm., tail     202 mm.      _Comparisons._--From _T. s. parietalis_, _T. s. ornata_     differs in its consistently pale ground color, olive instead     of dark brown or black. In respect to color-pattern _ornata_     stands in approximately the same relation to _parietalis_ as,     farther west, _T. s. infernalis_, a pale subspecies of the     California coast, stands in relation to _T. s. fitchi_.     Nevertheless, _fitchi_ consistently has a dark ground color,     whereas _parietalis_ is highly variable, and the color of an     occasional specimen (for example KU 17032 from Douglas County,     Kansas) matches _ornata_ in olive coloration. These unusually     pale specimens of _parietalis_ differ from _ornata_ in not     having a continuous black edge along each side of dorsal     stripe; black pigment of this area is concentrated into rows     of spots alternating with those of lower series. From _T. s.     infernalis_, _ornata_ differs in having paired black spots     on the ventrals and in having more than three"]]]
