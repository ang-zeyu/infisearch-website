It's all quite neat and economical, what with the cost per      front foot of this beach area zoned for business, and you'll      find a dandy profit on the books, but start worrying, fellow!      Things are beginning to happen. The maintenance engineer, who,      incidentally, is quitting, too, says that the equipment in the      shafts is wearing out, and the fields are pulsating or decaying      or some damned thing. And we can't contact Dr. Bradford, who      took the service manual with him.       Maybe you are more experienced in this hotel business than I      am, but I couldn't stand the gaff. One more mess like I barely      managed to clean up this week and someone's going to the pokey.      It won't be me.       Good luck, if you insist on staying, but I warned you.       (signed) Thornton K. Patterson       P.S. The fire-marshall is on our necks because the windows are      all sealed, but for God's sake, DON'T UNSEAL THEM!         *       *       *       *       *  Sextus tossed the fantastic communication aside in disgust, but his mind began to unreel a picture of the confusion he had witnessed down in the service quarters: Bellboys and room-service waiters fighting for service elevators; chambermaids trundling their little carts on the dead run; the overworked laundry staff, laboring in a veritable sweatshop of steamy chaos, swamped in a billowing backlog of sheets and towels. It all pointed to a large hotel operation.  If so, where were the rooms? Refusing to argue further with himself, he got undressed. Hyperspace or not, the people apparently were there, and it was his job to serve them. He got a bucket of ice from room-service, mixed an ice and whiskey highball and retreated into his private little world between crisp sheets and the pages of a twenty-five-cent mystery novel.  Arising early, he was girded for the summons from Miss Genevieve Hafner in room H-408. He went to her room. Fully dressed and in the daylight she was still a hollow-eyed mess. The only visible improvement was in the bleached bird's-nest, now a prim, rolled circle on her unlovely pate.  \"What amends,\" she demanded, \"do you intend to make for my terrible experience last night? Is that horrid creature in jail?\"  \"Experience? Jail?\" Sextus asked innocent-eyed. He asked that she tell him about it. Exasperated, she went over the details. When she finished he patted her hand and pointed to the sleeping pills. \"You should see your doctor.\"  \"But my doctor _prescribed_ those pills,\" she whimpered, looking down shyly at the hand which Sextus held gingerly. \"They never made me dream--before.\"  He bent and kissed the revolting hand. \"You are much too lovely a lady to have escaped from such a predicament as you describe without suffering--shall we say, a more romantic--fate?\"  Miss Hafner blushed at the thought and wavered between outrage and ecstasy for a dangerous moment. With time-tested genius, Sextus withdrew quietly and left her to her thoughts.  He _must_ get in touch with Dr. Bradford, atom business or not. This place could blow sky-high any minute.  He slipped the key into his own door and entered his suite. He took two brisk strides into his bedroom, tripped over a lady's overnight case and sprawled into his unmade bed. Even as he landed he realized it had an occupant, a gorgeous, strangely familiar blonde creature, touselled and asleep hugging her pillow with a creamy arm. A crash from the bathroom brought his head bouncing off the silken coverlet even as the girl awakened with a scream and tangled them both with the bed clothes.  Gary Gable charged from the bathroom, face dripping and a tuft of lather under each ear. \"What in the Goddam hell--\" He leaped for Sextus with his internationally famous shoulders knotted into bunches of muscular menace.  \"I'm the hotel manager,\" Sextus blurted loudly. For once his self-assurance wavered under fire. Even to himself his words explained nothing.  Meanwhile, Gable tripped over one of Sextus' heavy suitcases and joined the pair in bed. Another male voice issued from the bathroom, and as they all thrashed about, Sextus became aware that a second female had somehow appeared between Gable and his brand new bride. They came up together, face to face, the beautiful, sleepy blonde and the very wide-awake, queenly brunette. Now a pot-bellied little man in shorts and undershirt emerged from the bathroom, his mouth a gaping hole in a fully lathered face.  Sextus wriggled free, made for the door and off down the hall. To his horror, the automatic signal light on the vector \"H\" elevator was flickering and fading. The whole H-vector must be collapsing. He dashed for the stairwell and then reconsidered. He moved to the end of the hall which overlooked the low roof of the adjacent building. He tried the window and remembered that it was sealed. Back in the alcove he seized one of the sand jars and headed back for the window. A growing tide of commotion swelled from behind almost every door now. Grunts, screams and wrestling sounds came over the transoms.  He dashed the sand jar through the window, chipped off the jagged edges with his heel and climbed out. It was a twenty-foot drop to security, and he made it without hesitation. What could a man hope to do with a mess like--  Spang! His feet struck, not with a crunch on gravelled tar, but into a springy fabric that sagged under his 180 pounds, tossed him six feet in the air, caught him on the rebound and then juggled him down with diminishing bounces.         *       *       *       *       *  They were waiting for him, as he regained his feet on the quivering surface of a spring-loaded, canvas trampoline. The bright, mid-morning sun blinded him for an instant, but their voices assailed his ears in a mighty roar of approval as he squinted under his hand and peered around him.  \"Attaboy, Sexy,\" a shrill female voice piped. The roof-top was jammed with a pressing throng of--nearly naked people. In the cleared semi-circle about him a cordon of male bodies-beautiful restrained the mob behind a rope from which a long streamer hung with letters reading:       \"WELCOME, SEXTUS, TO 2153 A. D.\"  Reaching over the edge of the canvas platform with outstretched hand was a single, willowy, sun-baked oldster in a purple loin-cloth. His hair and beard were a dazzling white, and his face was wreathed in a silly smile, the kind officials always wear when presenting the keys to the city.  He shuffled his white kid sandals and spoke with an accent: \"Welcome to 2153, Sextus Rollo Forsyte! California salutes you!\"  Somewhere down on the street a raucous brass band broke into the _Stars and Stripes Forever_ that quickly medlied into _California, Here We Come_!  Sextus shrank back against the wall and felt ancient bricks crumble into dust against his hands. The magnitude of his disaster crushed in upon shrinking soul, and as his nimble imagination grasped the stunning significance every molecule of his being vibrated with horror. _He had been warned not to open a window._  \"You have fulfilled the legend,\" the old man sang joyously. \"You are a famous man.\" How famous, Sextus was forced to acknowledge as a television boom snaked over the heads of the crowd trailing a wisp of cable and cast its baleful, glassy eye full into his face.  \"Two hundred years to the day, as my great-great-grandfather predicted. I am Clark Bradford, direct descendent of--\"  Sextus stared wildly up at the open window. He bounced once experimentally. It was a fine trampoline, and he flipped a foot off the surface. Next bounce he flexed his knees a little and gained another foot. Now he doubled up purposefully.  The one-man-delegate in purple frowned. \"Stop that. We are here to welcome you and start the celebration at the Hollywood Bowl and--Stop that, I say!\" Now he sensed Sextus' incredible intent. \"Officer, help out here, please!\"  A bulgy, bronzed fellow clad mainly in an immaculately white brassard left the rope barrier and joined Bradford.  The Elder screamed, \"You can't go back, Forsyte! Don't you understand? You disappeared two centuries ago when the vector field collapsed. You can't go back! You can't! This is your destiny!\"  Sextus' heels soared five feet above the canvas and gained precious altitude with each spring, but it was a precarious business the higher he went. One slip and he'd glance off at a tangent and be captured by those reaching, grasping obscene hands in the crowd. The thought almost unseated his reason.  The police officer asked Bradford, \"What would happen if he did go back?\" Then he added, \"Ain't he got a right to?\"  Bradford shuffled nervously. \"I don't quite know. We never considered such a--my God! Stop, man, stop. You'll change the whole course of history! Stop him!\"  The barelegged minion tried, but as he climbed up on the edge of the trampoline Sextus bounced and kicked out with accuracy and determination. The policeman sprawled back clutching air, and the crowd roared.  One more bounce and a half twist, now. Sextus soared up, up, and his hands touched the sill.  With the agility of desperation he clawed up and through the paneless window.  \"You don't know what you are doing,\" the old man screeched. \"Stay here and you'll be famous. If you go back it is to oblivion. Oblivion! Very, well, _go_ back! _Go_ back, you--you nonentity!\"  \"You bet,\" Sextus panted to himself and tumbled onto the carpeted fourth floor hallway of the Mahoney-Plaza hotel.  [Illustration]  Instantly, another voice, but without accent, accosted him shrilly from down the hall. \"You, there. You mister manager.\" Sextus sighed mightily with relief. It was only Miss Genevieve Hafner holding a pimply-faced, red-haired youth by the ear.  True, Gary Gable and two hair-pulling, female starlets bore down right behind her, and rooms along both sides of the corridor were disgorging eddies of indignant displaced persons.

But though contempt helped him endure that journey through the tall mosses and taller trees, it couldn't ward off exhaustion. When the party stopped at the foot of a sheer rock spire that rose four or five hundred feet above the tallest growth, he collapsed and slept.         *       *       *       *       *  They woke him in the pre-dawn twilight and another group of Agvars took over. These--there were only three--looked older than the familiar villagers. And they'd smeared their faces with bands of red and yellow mud. He wondered....  He stopped wondering when they passed a pile of bones at the base of the spire. Among the grisly relics were skulls--brow-ridged, pointed, unmistakably Agvar. Sacrifices!  He was to be killed, then, to propitiate his own rescuers. His three guides--or guards--must be witch-doctors! He let them drag him along while he thought about it.  They'd give him no breakfast, not even water. If they'd eaten themselves, it was while he still slept. The scraps, if any, hadn't been flung in his face, and there'd been no smooth post to lick the dew from.  Hunger and thirst were nothing new, but neither was the resulting lethargy. Realizing his danger, Chet could only hang back.  Today though that was an old stall; the witch-doctors seemed to expect it. They broke branches from the trees and beat him till he bled. And when the climb up the rocks began, they put one of their number behind him to push, set the other two in front to pull, and tried by main strength to haul him up the five hundred foot rock-face.  Hazily, not hastily, Chet tried to think of a way out. His starved brain could come up with nothing. That, he finally decided, was only natural; it was not thinking that was needed, but action.  Still, he wasn't precipitate. Caution reinforced his habitual lassitude while trying to dispell it. Half a dozen times he tensed for combat, only to relax hopelessly. But finally he found a place--and the will--to make a stand.  He passed up a wide shelf, and let them tug him along a narrow ledge without much objection. He chose a near-vertical pitch about a hundred feet from the bottom--a mere crack that slanted upward to the right, offering the shallowest of hand- and foot-holds.  He could only hope that he wasn't in sight from the trail--or else that the villagers had left. He couldn't see through the treetops to make sure. But he hadn't the strength to worry.  He froze to the rock, pulling as if in fright. The two witch-doctors in single file above him jerked on the chains they held. But they needed a hand apiece to hold on with, and couldn't lift him.  The one below, standing on a six-inch ledge, tried to push. When that didn't work, he broke off a chunk of rock and beat Chet's left foot with it.  Spurred by the sudden pain, Chet kicked the witch-doctor in the face. The Agvar fell, screaming--until he crashed through the treetops and was still.         *       *       *       *       *  To Chet, forgetful of his hearing superiority, it seemed as if that outcry would be heard on Earth itself. Certainly he expected it to alarm the countryside. Still, unless the swift foot-thrust had been seen, no one would be sure the witch-doctor's fall was not an accident....  Chet had tasted victory for the first time in three years! He'd had a little revenge, and he wanted more. He could take the other two witch-doctors with him to death!  He put all his weight on the chains they held. But they chose not to die--let go, instead, to save themselves. The chain-ends rattled past, dislodging a small avalanche of dust and gravel and bruising stones--dislodging _him_ when the full weights jerked at neck and waist.  Prepared, he didn't let himself be pulled away from the cliff's face. He slid down it to the ledge from which the Agvar below him had fallen. There he teetered a moment, balancing precariously on toes scraped raw in his slide. Clawing fingers found a crack to the right, a knob to the left--safety! He clung there breathless.  No time for resting! Rattling stones warned of pursuit. He looked quickly around, found a route, and after a short traverse let himself slide to a long talus-slope. Down it he ran barefoot through sharp debris into concealing mosses.  The silence alarmed him. But it freed him from the need for craft; he didn't know what to avoid nor where it might be lurking, so he set out for the spaceship by what he hoped was the shortest way.  In the village, he'd located the landing-place by sound, fixed it by sun. The sun would guide him now. Not accurately, but well enough.  The ship would have landed in a clearing. Standing on its tail, it should loom high over the woods. And its men would scatter--he ought to run into one.  Run he did, trotting under thirty pounds of hardwood chain on reserves of strength dredged from a deep pit of desperation, through a forest overgrown with menace, full of life he could always sense but seldom see--of noises whose origin he couldn't guess.  The Agvars, for all their inferior hearing, could at least interpret what they heard. Chet couldn't. Every whispered cry, wild grunt and muttered growl was completely unfamiliar. He didn't know which sound signalled danger. He feared them all.  But more than sounds he feared the silence that chinked the logs of time between each nerve-wracking noise. Often he had to stop and rest, and silence threatened him then like the ominous quiet of bated breath. When he'd force himself to go on, each tree seemed like a porchful of malicious old women, pretending to disregard him as he passed, certain to make trouble when he'd gone. The buzz of small life-forms was a deprecatory murmur, ready at any second to burst into condemnation and terror....  What was that sound? And that? Noises that seemed out of place in their familiarity pinned him to the forest floor.  It was only the village. Satisfied, he worked up courage to skirt the place and walk on toward the ship.  But he was near collapse. When he heard human voices he could only yell incoherently once or twice, sob, and pass out.         *       *       *       *       *  Dimly through succeeding days Chet was aware of the ship's sickbay, of the enlisted attendants, the hovering doctor, the silent commander. Later he realized he'd been kept under opiates so his body could recover while his mind rested. At the time, he felt only the dimness.  It wore off abruptly. He was in a civilized cot, stretching luxuriously, aware of warmth and comfort and a cheerful voice that seemed familiar.  He opened his eyes. A fat young corpsman had been watching.  \"How do you feel, sir?\" the boy said. \"Ready for coffee?\"  \"Sure,\" Chet answered. And grinned lazily as he sat up to sip the proffered cup. \"You've taken good care of me.\"  \"Used to be a barber in civilian life,\" the boy said smugly. And Chet found with an exploratory hand that he'd been shaven and shorn, bathed, bandaged where necessary--even, he saw, clad in a pair of fancy red broadcloth pajamas.  \"You've got me cleaned up, all right,\" he said. \"Whose p.j.'s have I got on?\"  \"Dr. Pine's, sir. You'll see him in a couple of minutes--he and the Old Man been waiting to question you. There's a robe and slippers, if you want me to help you get up....\"  \"I'm not helpless,\" Chet said, boasting in his turn. He proved it by climbing--gingerly--out of the cot. The boy helped him into the robe, found the slippers, pushed the small room's one chair an inch closer to the open porthole, and left, closing the door behind him.         *       *       *       *       *  Vaguely Chet found he knew the two men who soon entered the room--they'd been there before. But this was his first fully conscious look at them. Commander Seymour, the C.O., looked surprisingly young for his job. He _was_ young, Chet decided--not over thirty-five--and his short slight figure made him seem younger still.  He had few words. \"You're looking fine, Barfield,\" he said, and sat on the edge of the cot, thin face impassive, gray eyes alert.  Dr. Pine--tall, balding, affable--was associated in Chet's mind with hypodermic needles, bitter medicines, restrictions. Today, the doctor gave him a firm and friendly handshake, but yesterday, Chet felt, that same hand had inflicted pain.  \"Glad to see you looking so well,\" the doctor said, taking a stance against the wall by the porthole. He sounded sincere enough, but Chet, resuming his chair, wondered how much of the gladness was based on the doctor's pride in professional handiwork.  There was an awkward pause. Chet remembered to murmur polite replies to the men who were so obviously sizing him up. Then he asked, \"When do you think I'll be ready for duty?\"  His visitors exchanged a glance. \"Later,\" Commander Seymour said. \"Take it easy while you can, Barfield.\" He smiled unconvincingly at what must have been meant as a joke.  [Illustration]  Talk again lapsed, and Chet became uncomfortable. \"The corpsman said you wanted to ask me some things,\" he said. And added, \"You've already questioned me, haven't you?\"  \"Only a little,\" Dr. Pine said, flexing his long fingers and looking down at them. \"We--ah--we had to find out about your shipmates. Commander Seymour wanted to look for them, naturally....\"  Naturally.... \"Are we going to leave here now, sir?\" Chet asked the commander.  \"Not yet,\" he said. \"Dr. Pine has a job to do.\"  \"What's that, Doctor?\"  \"I'm going to study your Agvar friends, Mr. Barfield. Want to help?\"  \"Sure,\" Chet said. \"There's nothing I'd rather do than bring you a few corpses to dissect.\"  \"That--ah--that isn't the idea,\" Dr. Pine said, bending his fingers and rocking from toes to heels. \"I--ah--I want to do a little anthropology--study them in the life....\"  \"Why?\" Chet demanded. \"I can tell you all about them. I can tell you what they did to me, too! They don't deserve to live! And this planet won't be safe for spacemen till they're dead. Why waste"]]]
