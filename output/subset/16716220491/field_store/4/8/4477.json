None too often, more's the pity.  Some one has said that, in order to make a gentleman, one must begin with the grandfather. It is equally true that a good and proper breakfast begins the night before--or, better yet, the morning before.  Careful, systematic planning in advance lightens immeasurably the burden of housekeeping, and, many a time, makes the actual work nothing but fun. Those who have tried the experiment of planning meals for the entire week are enthusiastic in praise of the system. It secures variety, simplifies marketing, arranges for left-overs, and gives many an hour of peace and comfort which could not be had otherwise.  Even if a woman be her own maid, as, according to statistics, eighty-five per cent. of us are, a dainty, hygienic, satisfying breakfast is hers and her lord's for little more than the asking. By careful preparation in advance, the morning labor is reduced to a minimum; by the intelligent use of lists and memoranda, the weary and reluctant body is saved many an unnecessary step.  An alarm clock of the \"intermittent\" sort insures early rising, a dash of cold water on the face is a physical and mental tonic of the most agreeable kind, and one hour in the morning is worth two at night, as the grandmothers of all of us have often said.  Fruit, usually, may be prepared for serving the night before, and will be improved by a few hours in the refrigerator. Cereals should be soaked over night in the water in which they are to be cooked, and a few hours' cooking in the afternoon will injure very few cereals destined for the breakfast table the next morning. Codfish balls and many other things will be none the worse for a night's waiting; the table can be set, and everything made ready for a perfect breakfast, which half an hour of intelligent effort in the morning will readily evolve.  A plea is made for the use of the chafing-dish, which is fully as attractive at the breakfast table as in the \"wee sma' hours\" in which it usually shines; for a white apron instead of a gingham one when \"my lady\" is also the cook; for a crisp, clean shirt-waist instead of an abominable dressing-sack; for smooth, tidy hair, instead of unkempt locks; for a collar and a belt, and a persistent, if determined, cheerfulness.  In the long run, these things pay, and with compound interest at that. They involve a certain amount of labor, a great deal of careful planning, eternal getting-up when it is far more pleasant to abide in dreamland, quite often a despairing weariness, if not a headache, and no small draft upon one's power of self-denial and self-sacrifice.  But he who goes in the morning from a quiet, comfortable, well-ordered house, with a pleasant memory of the presiding genius of his hearthstone, is twice the man that his fellow may be, whose wife breakfasts at ten in her bed, or, frowsy and unkempt, whines at him from across a miserable breakfast--twice as well fitted for the ceaseless grind of an exhausting day in the business arena, whence he returns at night, footsore, weary, and depressed, to the four walls wherein he abides.      \"How far that little candle throws its beams!     So shines a good deed in a naughty world.\"  To some, this may seem an undue stress laid upon the material side of existence, but the human animal needs animal comforts even more than his brother of forest and field, and from such humble beginnings great things may come, not the least of which is the fine, spiritual essence of a happy home.     HOW TO SET THE TABLE   Having said so much, we proceed, not to our mutton, as the French have it, but to our breakfast, in which the table plays no small nor unimportant part.  There are rumors that the pretty and sensible fashion of doilies on the bare table is on the wane, but let us hope these are untrue, or, if not, that some of us may have the courage of our convictions and continue to adhere to a custom which has everything in its favor and nothing against it.  In the absence of handsome top of oak or mahogany, the breakfast cloths, fringed or not, as one likes, which are about a yard and a quarter square, are the next best thing. Asbestos mats, under the cloth, protect the table from the hot dishes. Failing these, fairly satisfactory substitutes are made from thin white oil-cloth, between two layers of canton flannel, \"fur side outside,\" and quilted on the machine. Grass table-mats are also used, but always under cloth or doily. Canton flannel, quilted, three layers to a mat, is easily washed, and furnishes a great deal of protection.  Breakfast, most assuredly, is not dinner, and there should be a distinct difference in the laying of the table. The small doilies are easily washed, and fresh ones are possible every morning--an assured gain in the way of daintiness.  Let us suppose that we have a handsome table-top, and an unlimited supply of doilies, tray-cloths and centrepieces. First the centrepiece goes on, exactly in the centre, by the way, and not with a prejudiced leaning to one side or the other. On this belongs the pot of growing fern, the low jar containing a few simple flowers, or a bowl of fruit, decorated with green leaves, if green leaves are to be had.  At each place the breakfast doily, nine or twelve inches square, a small doily for the coffee cup, and another for the glass of water. At the right of the plate, the small silver knife, sharp edge toward the plate, the spoons for fruit and cereal; at the left, one fork, or two, as needed, and the coffee spoon.  In front of the master of the house the small platter containing the _pièce de résistance_ will eventually be placed; in front of the mistress of the mansion, the silver tray bearing the coffee service--coffee-pot, hot-water pitcher, cream jug, milk pitcher, and sugar bowl.  Breakfast napkins are smaller than dinner napkins, and the small fringed napkins are not out of place. \"Costly thy habit as thy purse will buy\" might well refer to linen, for it is the one thing in which price is a direct guarantee of quality.  Satisfactory breakfast cloths and napkins are made of linen sheeting, fringed, hemstitched, or carefully hemmed by hand, and in this way a pretty cloth can be had for less money than in any other. The linen wears well, washes beautifully, and acquires a finer sheen with every tubbing. Insertions and borders of torchon or other heavy lace make a breakfast cloth suitable for the most elaborate occasion, and separate doilies may easily be made to match. The heavy white embroidery which has recently come into favor is unusually attractive here.  Finger-bowls wait on the sideboard, to be placed after the fruit course, or after breakfast. The rose-water, slice of lemon, geranium leaves, and other finger-bowl refinements in favor for dinners are out of place at breakfast. Clear, cool water is in better taste.  The china used at the breakfast table should be different from that used at dinner. Heavier ware is permissible, and more latitude in the way of decoration is given. Much of the breakfast china one sees in the shops is distinctly cheerful in tone, and one must take care to select the more quiet patterns. It is not pleasant to go to breakfast with a fickle appetite, and be greeted by a trumpet-toned \"Good Morning\" from the china.  Endless difference is allowed, however, and all the quaint, pretty jugs, pitchers, and plates may properly be used at breakfast. One is wise, however, to have a particular color scheme in mind and to buy all china to blend with it. Blue and white is a good combination, and is, perhaps, more suitable for the morning meal than anything else. As a certain philosopher says: \"The blue and white look so pretty with the eggs!\"  The carafe, muffin plate, platter, and all other bowls, platters, plates, and pitchers not on the individual cover have each a separate doily, with the protecting mat always under hot dishes. A well-set table is governed by a simple law--that of precision. Dishes arranged in an order little less than military, all angles either right or acute, will, for some occult reason, always look well. Informality may be given by the arrangement of the flowers, or by a flower or two laid carelessly on the table. But one must be careful not to trifle too much with this law of precision. Knives, forks, and spoons must all be laid straight, but not near enough together to touch, and napkins and dishes must be precisely placed, else confusion and riot will result.  The breakfast selected as a type consists of fruit, a cereal, salt fish, or salt meat, or eggs, or omelets, hot bread of some kind, and pancakes or waffles, or coffee cake, one dish from each group, and coffee. Six dishes in all, which may be less if desired, but never more. All six form a breakfast sufficiently hearty for a stone mason or a piano mover; one or two give a breakfast light enough to tempt those who eat no breakfast at all. For serving it are required small and medium-sized plates, knives, forks, spoons, egg cups, platters, service plates, cups and saucers, glasses, coffee-pot, pitchers, sugar bowl, and cream jug, syrup pitcher, and fruit bowl.  Fruit is said to be \"gold in the morning,\" and it is a poor breakfast, indeed, from which it is omitted. Even in winter it is not hard to secure variety, if time and thought be taken, for the dried fruits are always in the market and by careful cooking may be made acceptable to the most uncertain appetite.  Medical authorities recommend a glass of water taken the first thing upon rising, either hot or cold as suits one best. A little lemon-juice takes the \"flat\" taste from plain hot water, and clear, cool water, not iced, needs nothing at all. This simple observance of a very obvious hygienic rule will temper the tempestuous morning for any one. One washes his face, his hands, his body--then why not his stomach, which has worked hard a large part of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37680"],["title","The Myrtle Reed Cook Book (#2)"],["body"," night, and is earnestly desirous of the soothing refreshment of a bath?  To those carping critics who cavil at the appearance of the stomach in a chapter entitled \"How to Set the Table,\" we need only say that the table is set for the stomach, and the stomach should be set for the table, and anyway, it comes very near being a table of contents, _n'est-ce pas_?     THE KITCHEN RUBAIYAT       Wake, for the Alarm Clock scatters into Flight     The variegated Nightmares of the Night;       Allures the Gas into the Kitchen Range     And pleads for Rolls and Muffins that are Light.      Before the Splendor of the last Dream died     Methought a Voice from out my Doorway cried:       \"When all the Breakfast is Prepared for him     Why doth my lord within his Crib abide?\"      And, as the cat Purred, she who was Before     Within the Kitchen shouted: \"Guard the Door!       Else this new Bridget will have Flown the Coop     And, once Departed, will Return no More!\"      All maids in sight the Wise One gladly Hires     And one of them she Presently acquires,       Yet toward the Bureau does not fail to Look     Because all Maids, as well as Men, are liars.      For Mary Ann has gone, with all her Woes,     And Dinah, too, has fled--where, no one knows,       But still a Bridget from the Bureau comes     And many a Tekla of her Reference blows.      Come, fill the Cup, and let the Kettle Sing!     The Cream and Sugar and Hot Water bring!       Methinks this fragrant liquid amber here     Within the Pot, is pretty much the Thing.      Each Morn a thousand Cereals brings, you say?     Yes, but where leaves the Food of Yesterday?       And this same Grocer man that sells us Nerve     Shall take Pa's Wheat and Mother's Oats away.      For lo, my small Back Yard is thickly Strown     With Ki-Tee-Munch, Chew-Chew, and Postman's Own       Where Apple-Nuts and Strength have been Forgot--     Ah, how these Papers by the Winds are Blown!      The tender Waffle hearts are Set upon     Is either Crisp or Soggy, and Anon       Like Maple Syrup made of corn and Cobs     Lasts but a scant Five Minutes, and is Gone.      I often think that never gets so Red     My flower-like Nose as when I've just been Fed       And after Breakfast, in the Glass I look,     And never Fail to Wish that I were dead.      And this faint Sallow Place upon my Mien--     How came it There? From that fair Coffee Bean?       Ah, take the Glass away! Make Haste unless     You want to see my Whole Complexion green.      When I was Younger, I did oft Frequent     The Married Bunch, and heard Great Argument       About the Fearful Price of Eggs, and How     To get a Dollar's Work out of a Cent.      And when I asked them of their Recompense,     What did they Get for Keeping Down Expense--       Oh, many a cup of Coffee, Steaming Hot,     Must drown the Memory of their Insolence!      If I were Married 't would be my Desire     To get up Every Morn and Build the Fire       For fear my Husband should use Kerosene,     And, without warning, be transported Higher.      Ah, with the Coffee all my Years provide!     Its chemicals may turn me green Inside,       But all my Fears are Scattered to the Winds     When o'er the fragrant Pot I can Preside.      I blame our Mother Eve, who did mistake     Her Job, and flirted Somewhat with the Snake,       For all the Errors of the Flaky Roll,     For all the Terrors of the Buckwheat Cake.      A glass of Creamy Milk just from the Cow,     Or Buttermilk, drawn from the Goat, I trow,       And thou across the Festal Board from Me,     A Six-Room Flat were Paradise enow!      Some for a Patent Bread that will not Crumb,     And nary Bite of Cereal for Some--       Ah, take the Coffee! Let all else go by     Nor heed the Thick White Fur upon the Tongue.      Look to the Human Wrecks about us: lo,     About their Indigestion how they Blow,       And lay the Blame on Coffee, crystal Clear,     Or say the Crisp Hot Muffin is their Foe!      And those who chew and chew upon the Grain,     Have got so used to Chewing, they are Fain       To Dwell upon their Health Food in their Talk     And presently their Neighbors go Insane.   FOOT-NOTES  1. The author began with the intention of adapting the entire Rubaiyat to kitchen purposes, but thought better of it just in time to head off the Lyric Muse, who was coming at full gallop, with her trunk.  2. Those who do not like The Kitchen Rubaiyat will doubtless be glad there is no more of it.  3. Those who do like it can begin at the beginning and read it again. The rest of it would be about like this installment, anyway.  P. S. If the demand is great enough, the rest of it may appear in another book.  P. S. 2. The publisher of this book has an unalterable prejudice against printing poetry, but he allowed The Kitchen Rubaiyat to slip by without question.  P. S. 3. ?

Strawberries                       May and June.     Tangerines                         November to February.  The above table, of course, is only a rough outline, as seasons and localities vary so much. The tendency, too, is to extend the season of every fruit indefinitely, as transporting and refrigerating methods improve. Fruit out of season is always expensive, and often unripe and unsatisfactory. Fortunately, when it is at its best it is always abundant and at the lowest price.  Among the dried fruits may be mentioned Prunelles, Apricots, Apples, Blackberries, Cherries, Nectarines, Peaches, peeled and unpeeled, Pears, Plums, Raspberries, Prunes, Figs, and Dates. Canned fruits which may be used for breakfast, with proper preparation, are Pears, Peaches, Apricots, Cherries, Plums, and Pineapples.  Dried fruits may be soaked over night in the water in which they are to be cooked, and simmered slowly, until they are tender, with little sugar or none at all. They may also be steamed, either with or without sugar, omitting the soaking, until tender enough for a straw to pierce. Combinations of dried fruits are often agreeable, and a few raisins will sometimes add a pleasant flavor.  Canned fruits intended for breakfast should be drained and very thoroughly rinsed in cold water, then allowed to stand for some hours in a cool place.  Many of the fruits, both dried and fresh, combine well with cereals. Care must be taken, however, to follow such acid fruits as Currants, Cherries, Oranges, and Grapefruit, with meat or egg dishes, omitting the cereal, as the starch and acid are very likely to fight with each other when once inside, to the inconvenience of the non-combatant. A fruit which for any reason tastes \"flat\" can be instantly improved in flavor and tonic quality by a sprinkle of lemon-juice.  Below are given different ways of preparing fruit for the breakfast table.   APPLES  I. When served whole, apples should be carefully washed and rubbed to a high polish with a crash towel. Only perfect fruit should be served in this way, and green leaves in the fruit bowl are especially desirable. Fruit-knives are essential.  II. Pare, quarter, and core good eating apples, removing all imperfections. Serve a few quarters on each plate, with or without sugar. A sprinkle of cinnamon or lemon-juice will improve fruit which has little flavor. A grating of nutmeg may also be used.  III. _À la Condé._--Pare, quarter, and core good cooking apples. Arrange in rows in an earthen baking-dish, sprinkle with powdered sugar and lemon-juice, pour a little water into the baking-dish, and add a heaping tablespoonful of butter. Bake slowly, basting frequently with the apple-juice and melted butter. When tender, take out, drain, and cool, saving the juice. Serve with boiled rice or other cereal, using the juice instead of milk.  IV. _À la Cherbourg._--Pare and core good cooking apples; halve or quarter if desired. Cook slowly in a thin syrup flavored with lemon-peel and a bit of ginger-root. Serve separately or with cereal.  V. _À la Fermière._--Pare and core the apples and arrange in a well-buttered baking-dish. Sprinkle slightly with sugar and cinnamon; baste often with melted butter, and serve with boiled rice or other cereal, using the juice instead of milk.  VI. _À la Française._--Core and then peel tart apples. Put into cold water from half an inch to an inch in depth, sprinkle with sugar, cover tightly, and cook very slowly on the back part of the range till tender. Flavorings already noted may be added at pleasure. Skim out the apples, reduce the remaining syrup one-half by rapid boiling, pour over the apples, and cool. Serve cold, with or without"]]]
