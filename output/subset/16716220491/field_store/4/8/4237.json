It is even so with the principles to be discussed in the following papers. They were stated seventy years ago, yet it is only recently that the Latter-day Saints have begun to realize that they are identical with recently developed scientific truths; and the world of science is not yet aware of it. However, whenever such harmony is observed, it testifies of the divine inspiration of the humble, unlearned boy prophet of the nineteenth century.  [Footnote A: Doctrine and Covenants 9:7, 8.]  [Sidenote: The absence of the language, details and methods of science in the Prophet's writings proves him unfamiliar with the written science of his day.]  The Prophet Joseph does not use the language of science; which is additional proof that he did not know the science of his day. This may be urged as an objection to the assertion that he understood fundamental scientific truths, but the error of this view is easily comprehended when it is recalled that the language of science is made by men, and varies very often from age to age, and from country to country. Besides, the God who spoke to Joseph Smith, says, \"These commandments were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner of their language, that they might come to understanding.\"[A] If God had spoken the special language of science, the unlearned Joseph Smith would not, perhaps, have understood. Every wise man explains that which he knows in the language of those to whom he is speaking, and the facts and theories of science can be quite easily expressed in the language of the common man. It is needless to expect scientific phraselogy in the writings of Joseph Smith.  [Footnote A: Doctrine and Covenants 1:24.]  Scientific details are almost wholly wanting in the writings of Joseph Smith. Had the Prophet known the science of his day, his detailed knowledge would have been incorporated somehow in his writings. The almost complete absence of such scientific detail as would in all probability have been used, had the Prophet known of it, is additional testimony that he did not get his information from books.  Finally, another important fact must be mentioned. Men in all ages have speculated about the things of the universe, and have invented all kinds of theories to explain natural phenomena. In all cases, however, these theories have been supported by experimental evidence, or else they have been proposed simply as personal opinions. Joseph Smith, on the contrary, laid no claim to experimental data to support the theories which he proposed, nor did he say that they were simply personal opinions, but he repeatedly asserted that God had revealed the truths to him, and that they could not, therefore, be false. If doctrines resting upon such a claim can be shown to be true, it is additional testimony of the truth of the Prophet's work.  [Sidenote: Purpose of the following chapters.]  In the following chapters it will be shown, by a series of comparisons, that, in 1833, or soon thereafter, the teachings of Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, were in full harmony with the most advanced scientific thought of today, and that he anticipated the world of science in the statement of fundamental facts and theories of physics, chemistry, astronomy and biology.     THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF THE UNIVERSE.  Chapter II.  THE INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF MATTER.   [Sidenote: Until recent days many believed that matter could be created or destroyed.]  It was believed by the philosophers of ancient and mediaeval times, especially by those devoted to the study of alchemy, that it was possible through mystical powers, often of a supernatural order, to annihilate matter or to create it from nothing. Men with such powers transcended all known laws of nature, and became objects of fear, often of worship to the masses of mankind. Naturally enough, the systems of religion became colored with the philosophical doctrines of the times; and it was held to be a fundamental religious truth that God created the world from nothing. Certainly, God could do what his creatures, the magicians, were able to do--that part of the reasoning was sound.  In support of this doctrine, attention was called to some of the experiences of daily life. A piece of coal placed in a stove, in a short time disappear--it is annihilated. From the clear air of a summer's day raindrops start--created out of nothing. A fragment of gold placed in contact with sufficiently strong acids, disappears--it is destroyed.  [Sidenote: Matter is eternal, its form only can be changed.]  Towards the end of the eighteenth century, facts and laws of chemistry were discovered, which enabled scientists to follow in great detail the changes, visible or invisible, to which matter in its various forms is subject. Then it was shown that the coal placed in a stove unites with a portion of the air entering through the drafts, and becomes an invisible gas, but that, were this gas collected as it issues from the chimney, it would be found to contain a weight of the elements of the coal just equal to the weight of the coal used. In a similar manner it was shown that the raindrops are formed from the water found in the air, as an invisible vapor. The gold dissolved in the acid, may be wholly recovered so that every particle is accounted for. Numerous investigations on this subject were made by the most skillful experimenters of the age, all of which showed that it is absolutely impossible to create or destroy the smallest particle of matter; that the most man can do is to change the form in which matter exists.  After this truth had been demonstrated, it was a necessary conclusion that matter is eternal, and that the quantity of matter in the universe cannot be diminished nor increased. This great generalization, known as the law of the Persistence of Matter or Mass, is the foundation stone of modern science. It began to find general acceptance among men about the time of Joseph Smith's birth, though many religious sects still hold that God, as the Supreme Ruler, is able at will to create matter from nothing. The establishment of this law marked also the final downfall of alchemy and other kindred occult absurdities.  [Sidenote: Mormonism teaches that all things are material.]  No doctrine taught by Joseph Smith is better understood by his followers than that matter in its elementary condition is eternal, and that it can neither be increased nor diminished. As early as May, 1833, the Prophet declared that \"the elements are eternal,\"[A] and in a sermon delivered in April, 1844, he said \"Element had an existence from the time God had. The pure principles of element are principles which can never be destroyed; they may be organized and reorganized, but not destroyed. They had no beginning, and can have no end.\"[B]  [Footnote A: Doctrine and Covenants, 93:33.]  [Footnote B: The Contributor, Vol. 4, p. 257.]  It is thus evident that from the beginning of his work, Joseph Smith was in perfect harmony with the fundamental doctrine of science; and far in advance of the religious sects of the world, which are, even at this time, slowly accepting the doctrine of the persistence of matter in a spiritual as well as in a material sense.  Mormonism has frequently been charged with accepting the doctrine of materialism. In one sense, the followers of Joseph Smith plead yes to this charge. In Mormon theology there is no place for immateralism; i.e. for a God, spirits and angels that are not material. Spirit is only a refined form of matter. It is beyond the mind of man to conceive of an immaterial thing. On the other hand, Joseph Smith did not teach that the kind of tangible matter, which impresses our mortal senses, is the kind of matter which is associated with heavenly beings. The distinction between the matter known to man and the spirit matter is very great; but no greater than is the difference between the matter of the known elements and that of the universal ether which forms one of the accepted dogmas of science.  Science knows phenomena only as they are associated with matter; Mormonism does the same.     Chapter III.  THE INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF ENERGY.   [Sidenote: All forms of energy may be converted into each other. Energy can not be destroyed.]  It is only when matter is in motion, or in the possession of energy, that it is able to impress our senses. The law of the indestructibility and convertibility of energy, is of equal fundamental value with that of the indestructibility of matter. A great variety of forces exist in nature, as, for instance, gravitation, electricity, chemical affinity, heat and light. These forces may all be made to do work. Energy, in fact, may be defined as the power of doing work. In early days these forces were supposed to be distinct and not convertible, one into the other, just as gold and silver, with our present knowledge, are distinct and not convertible into other elements.  In the early part of the nineteenth century students of light and heat began to demonstrate that these two natural forces were different manifestations of one universal medium. This in turn led to the thought that possibly these forces, instead of being absolutely distinct, could be converted one into the other. This idea was confirmed in various experimental ways. Sir Humphrey Davy, about the end of the eighteenth century, rubbed together two pieces of ice until they were nearly melted. Precautions had been taken that no heat could be abstracted from the outside by the ice. The only tenable conclusion was that the energy expended in rubbing, had been converted into heat, which had melted the ice. About the same time, Count Rumford, a distinguished American, was superintending the boring of a cannon at the arsenal at Munich, and was forcibly struck with the heating of the iron due to this process. He, like Davy, believed that the energy of the boring instruments had been converted into the heat.[A]  [Footnote A: The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34362"],["title","Joseph Smith as Scientist: A Contribution to Mormon Philosophy (#2)"],["body","of Heat--Stewart, pp. 38, 39.]  From 1843 to 1849, Dr. Joule of Manchester, England, published the results of experiments on the relation between mechanical energy and heat. Dr. Joule attached a fixed weight to a string which was passed over a pulley, while the other end was connected with paddles moving in water. As the weight descended, the paddles were caused to revolve; and it was observed that, as the weight fell and the paddles revolved, the water became warmer and warmer. Dr. Joule found further that for each foot of fall, the same amount of heat energy was given to the water. In fact, he determined that when a pound weight falls seven hundred and seventy two feet it gives out energy enough to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit.[A] This experiment, frequently repeated, gave the same result and established largely the law of the convertibility of energy.  [Footnote A: The Conservation of Energy--Stewart, pp. 44, 45. Recent Advances in Physical Science--Tait, pp. 63, 65.]  About the same time, it was shown that light can be converted into heat; and later it was proved that electricity may be changed into heat or light. In all these cases it was found that the amount of energy changed was exactly equal to the amount of energy produced.  Thus, by countless experiments, it was finally determined that energy is indestructible; that, when any form of energy disappears, it reappears immediately in another form. This is the law of the persistence of force or energy. In more recent days, it has been suggested that all known forces are variations of a great universal force, which may or may not be known. The very nature of force or energy is not understood. In the language of Spencer, \"By the persistence of force, we really mean the persistence of some cause which transcends our knowledge and conception.\"[A]  [Footnote A: First Principles, Spencer, 4th ed., p. 200.]  It need hardly be explained that energy cannot exist independently of matter; and that the law of the persistence of matter is necessary for the existence of the law of persistence of force.  [Sidenote: Universal intelligence, comparable to universal energy is indestructible, according to Joseph Smith.]  Joseph Smith was not a scientist; and he made no pretense of solving the scientific questions of this day. The discussion relative to the convertibility of various forms of energy was in all probability not known to him. Still, in his writings is found a doctrine which in all respects resembles that of the conservation of energy.  Joseph Smith taught, and the Church now teaches, that all space is filled with a subtle, though material substance of wonderful properties, by which all natural phenomena are controlled. This substance is known as the Holy Spirit. Its most important characteristic is intelligence. \"Its inherent properties embrace all the attributes of intelligence.\"[A] The property of intelligence is to the Holy Spirit what energy is to the gross material of our senses.  [Footnote A: Key to Theology, P. P. Pratt, 5th ed., p. 40.]  In one of the generally accepted works of the Church, the energy of nature is actually said to be the workings of the Holy Spirit. The passage reads as follows: \"Man observes a universal energy in nature--organization and disorganization succeed each other--the thunders roll through the heavens; the earth trembles and becomes broken by earthquakes; fires consume cities and forests; the waters accumulate, flow over their usual bounds, and cause destruction of life and property; the worlds perform their revolutions in space with a velocity and power incomprehensible to man, and he, covered with a veil of darkness, calls this universal energy, God, when it is the workings of his Spirit, the obedient agent of his power, the wonder-working and life-giving principle in all nature.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Compendium, Richards and Little, 3rd ed., p. 150.]  In short, the writings of the Church clearly indicate that the various forces of nature, the energy of nature, are only manifestations of the great, pervading force of intelligence. We do not understand the real nature of intelligence any better than we understand the true nature of energy. We only know that by energy or intelligence gross matter is brought within reach of our senses.  Intelligence or energy was declared by Joseph Smith in May, 1833, to be eternal: \"Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.\"[A] In the sermon already referred to the Prophet said, \"The intelligence of spirits had no beginning, neither will it have an end.\"  [Footnote A: Doctrine and Covenants, 93:29.]  These quotations, and many others to which attention might be called, show clearly that Joseph Smith taught the doctrine that the energy of the universe can in nowise be increased or diminished, though, it may manifest itself in various forms.  The great Latter-day prophet is thus shown to be in harmony with the second fundamental law of science. It is not a valid objection to this conclusion to say that Joseph Smith did not use the accepted terms of science. Words stand only for ideas; the ideas are essential. The nomenclature of a science is often different in different lands, and is often changed as knowledge grows.  It is hardly correct to say that he was in harmony with the law; the law as stated by the world of science was rather in harmony with him. Let it be observed that Joseph Smith enunciated the principle of the conservation of the energy, or intelligence as he called it, of the universe, in May, 1833, ten years before Dr. Joule published his famous papers on energy relations, and fifteen or twenty years before the doctrine was clearly understood and generally accepted by the learned of the world. Let it be also remembered that the unlearned boy from the backwoods of New York state, taught with the conviction of absolute certainty that the doctrine was true, for God had revealed it to him.  If God did not reveal it to him, where did he learn it, and whence came the courage to teach it as an eternal truth?     Chapter IV.  THE UNIVERSAL ETHER.   [Sidenote: The modern theory of light was established only about the year 1830.]  The nature of light has been in every age a fascinating subject for study and reflection. Descartes, the French mathematician and philosopher, advanced the hypothesis that light consists of small particles emitted by luminous bodies, and that the sensation of light is produced by the impact of these particles upon the retina of the eye. Soon after this emission or corpuscular theory had been proposed, Hooke, an English investigator of great note, stated publicly that the phenomena of light, as he had observed them, led him to the belief that the nature of light could best be explained on the assumption that light was a kind of undulation or wave in some unknown medium, and that the sensation of light was. produced when these waves struck upon the retina of the eye. This new hypothesis, known as the theory of undulations, after the great Isaac Newton had declared himself in favor of the corpuscular theory, was finally adjudged by the majority of students to be erroneous.  About the year 1800, more than a century after the days of Descartes, Hooke and Newton, an English physician, Dr. Thomas Young, who had long experimented on the nature of light, asserted that the emission theory could not explain many of the best known phenomena of light. Dr. Young further claimed that correct explanations could be made only by the theory of waves of undulation of an etherial medium diffused through space, and presented numerous experimental evidences in favor of this view. This revival of the old theory of undulation met at first with violent opposition from many of the greatest scientific minds of the day. Sometime after Dr. Young's publication, a French army officer, Augustine Fresnel, undertook the study of the nature of light, and arrived, almost independently, at the conclusion stated by Dr. Young. Later, other investigators discovered light phenomena which could be explained only on the undulatory hypothesis, and so, little by little, the new theory gained ground and adherents.  Still, even as late as 1827, the astronomer Herschel published a treatise on light, in which he appeared to hold the real merit of the theory of undulations in grave doubt.[A] Likewise, the Imperial Academy at St. Petersburg, in 1826, proposed a prize for the best attempt to relieve the undulatory theory of light of some of the main objections against it.[B] It was several years later before the great majority of the scientific world accepted the theory of undulations as the correct explanation of the phenomena of light.  [Footnote A: History of the Inductive Sciences, Whewell, 3rd edition, Vol. II, p. 114.]  [Footnote B: Loc. cit., 117.]  [Sidenote: A subtle substance, the ether, fills all space.]  In brief, this theory assumes that a very attenuated, but very elastic, substance, called the ether, fills all space, and is found surrounding the ultimate particles of matter. Thus, the pores of wood, soil, lead, gold and the human body, are filled with the ether. It is quite impossible by any known process to obtain a portion of space free from it. A luminous body is one in which the ultimate particles of matter, the atoms or molecules, are moving very rapidly, and thus causing disturbances in the ether, similar to the disturbances in quiet water when a rock is thrown into it; and, like the water wave, proceeding from the point of disturbance, so the ether waves radiate from the luminous body into space. When a wave strikes the retina of the eye, the sensation of light is produced. This new-found ether was soon used for the explanation of other natural phenomena.
