I thank Norman E. Hartweg and T. H. Hubbell for making available to me the facilities of the museum and for their numerous courtesies that aided me so much.  My field work in Michoacán was supported by the Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan (1951), by the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies of the University of Michigan (1955), by the Penrose Fund of the American Philosophical Society (1956), by the Bache Fund of the National Academy of Sciences (1958), and by the University of Kansas Endowment Association (1960).  Permits for collecting specimens in México were provided by the Dirección General de Caza through the courtesy of Ing. Juan Lozano Franco and Luis Macías Arellano.   Historical Account  Unlike many parts of southern México and northern Central America, Michoacán received no attention from the collecting expeditions of the European museums in the last century. The earliest known herpetological specimens from Michoacán were obtained by Louis John Xantus, who was appointed U. S. Consul to Colima in 1859. In April, 1863, Xantus collected at Volcán Jorullo in Michoacán; in April and May of the same year he collected along the coast of Michoacán between the Río Cachán and the Río Nexpa. His small collection of 19 extant specimens is in the United States National Museum. Alfredo Dugès, a resident of Guanajuato, México, made early contributions to the knowledge of the herpetofauna of Michoacán. In 1885 he described _Sonora michoacanensis_, and in 1891 he described _Eumeces altamirani_; from what is known of the distribution of these species, he probably had collected in the Tepalcatepec Valley. During their biological survey of México, Edward W. Nelson and Edward A. Goldman spent a limited amount of time in Michoacán in 1892 and again in 1903 and 1904. Most of their collecting was done on the plateau in the north-central part of the state; their collections are in the United States National Museum. While collecting fishes in southern México, Seth E. Meek obtained some amphibians and reptiles from Lago de Pátzcuaro in 1904; these are in the collections of the Chicago Natural History Museum. In 1908 Hans Gadow ventured into the then unexplored \"tierra caliente\" of the Balsas Valley and collected at Volcán Jorullo and other localities in the valley. Later in the same year he collected at Guayabo, San Salvador, and Arteaga in the Sierra de Coalcomán and at Buena Vista and Cofradía in the Tepalcatepec Valley. His collections were deposited in the British Museum (Natural History) and the Naturhistorisches Museum Wien.  The first thirty years of the present century saw little more field work in Michoacán. In the 1930's Edward H. Taylor and Hobart M. Smith collected throughout much of México. At various times they worked in Michoacán, principally along the road from México City to Guadalajara. In 1935 Hobart M. Smith spent a week at Hacienda El Sabino south of Uruapan; he revisited the locality again in 1936 and made a large and important collection of amphibians and reptiles from the upper limits of the arid tropical scrub forest in the Tepalcatepec Valley. Specimens collected by Smith and Taylor were incorporated into the Edward H. Taylor-Hobart M. Smith collection, which subsequently was deposited in part in the Museum of Natural History at the University of Illinois and in part in the Chicago Natural History Museum. In 1939 Hobart M. Smith collected at Pátzcuaro and between Uruapan and Apatzingán; these collections, made while he was a Walter Rathbone Bacon Scholar of the Smithsonian Institution, are deposited in the United States National Museum. In 1940 and 1941 Frederick A. Shannon, who was a member of the Hoogstraal Expeditions under the auspices of the Chicago Natural History Museum, collected on Cerro de Tancítaro and at Apatzingán; an account of the specimens collected there was published by Schmidt and Shannon (1947).  The eruption of Volcán Parícutin in February, 1943, attracted the attention of many biologists, a group of which from the Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan collected in the Cordillera Volcánica in 1945 and 1947. The amphibians and reptiles were collected and studied by Norman E. Hartweg. In 1950 James A. Peters accompanied Donald D. Brand on a preliminary exploration of the western part of the Sierra de Coalcomán and adjacent Pacific coast of Michoacán; in the same year Peters collected also on the Mexican Plateau and at Volcán Jorullo. His specimens are in the Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan. Since 1950 many biologists have collected in Michoacán in the course of work on certain groups of animals or in general surveys. In this way Raymond Alcorn, Robert W. Dickerman, James R. Dixon, Floyd L. Downs, Emmet T. Hooper, and Robert R. Miller have contributed to our knowledge of the herpetofauna.  As stated previously, my own field work in Michoacán began in 1951, when I accompanied Donald D. Brand on an exploring expedition to the southern part of the state. In that year a short time was spent on the Mexican Plateau, principally in the area around Lago de Cuitzeo, and at Volcán Jorullo. In July and August we made our headquarters at Coalcomán. From that town the field party travelled southward to Maruata on the Pacific coast and thence back over the mountains to Coalcomán. Later in that summer we travelled by mule from Coalcomán southeastward to the mouth of the Río Nexpa. In 1955, accompanied by Lee D. Beatty, Carter R. Gilbert, and Fred G. Thompson, I collected in the Tepalcatepec Valley and at Coalcomán. We made a mule trip from Coalcomán to Cerro de Barolosa, where we made the first collections from the pine-fir forests in the Sierra de Coalcomán. Later in the same summer Carter R. Gilbert and I spent a week at Playa Azul on the Pacific coast. In March, April, and May, 1956, my wife and I collected for a short time in the Cordillera Volcánica and on the Mexican Plateau. In early April we moved into the Tepalcatepec Valley, where we collected intensively between Churumuco and Tepalcatepec. In May we collected on the Pacific coast between Boca de Apiza and La Placita. In July and August, 1956, accompanied by Richard E. Etheridge, we returned to Michoacán and again collected on the Mexican Plateau and in the Cordillera Volcánica, before moving into the Tepalcatepec Valley. In an attempt to fill in gaps in the known distributions of many species and to sample the fauna in some previously uncollected areas, I returned to Michoacán in June, 1958. Accompanied by Jerome B. Tulecke and John Wellman, I collected on the Mexican Plateau in the northwestern part of the state, on the southern slopes of the Cordillera Volcánica, and in the Tepalcatepec Valley. Most of our time was spent in the Sierra de Coalcomán, where we collected at Aguililla, Artega, and Dos Aguas. In 1960 two days were spent in Michoacán; a small collection was made in the eastern part of the Cordillera Volcánica. With the exception of the specimens collected in 1960, which are at the Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas, the specimens that I have collected in Michoacán are in the Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan.     NATURAL LANDSCAPE   A proper understanding of the geographical distribution of animals in a given region is possible only after a thorough acquaintance with the geography of the region. Likewise, in order to gain a knowledge of the ecological distribution and relationships of the components of the fauna, it is necessary to study the animals in their natural environments. In order to give the reader a picture of the physical features and the major animal habitats within the state of Michoacán, the following brief description is offered. Each of these facets mentioned below will be elaborated in detail in my final report on the herpetofauna of Michoacán.   Physiography  The state of Michoacán comprises an area of 60,093 square kilometers (Vivó, 1953). Within this area the rugged terrain has a total relief of nearly 4000 meters. There have been several attempts to classify the physiographic provinces of México; the classification used here is a slight modification of the scheme proposed by Tamayo (1949). I have tried to keep the system as simple as possible, but still useful in discussing the distribution of animals living in the region. For general purposes the state of Michoacán can be divided into lowlands and highlands as follows:      LOWLANDS       Pacific Coastal Plain       Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin      HIGHLANDS       Mexican Plateau       Cordillera Volcánica       Sierra de Coalcomán  Although the lowlands in the state are continuous, they are only narrowly connected and thus form two distinct physiographic and biotic areas. The Pacific Coastal Plain in Michoacán extends for a distance of about 200 kilometers (airline) from the Río Coahuayana to the Río Balsas. The coastal plain is broad between the Río Coahuayana and San Juan de Lima, and between Las Peñas and the Río Balsas, where the hills rise some 12 kilometers inland from the sea. Between San Juan de Lima and Las Peñas the mountains extend to the sea; in this region rocky promontories form precipitous cliffs dropping into the sea. Between the promontories are small sandy or rocky beaches.  Lying to the north of the Sierra de Coalcomán and the Sierra del Sur, but south of the Cordillera Volcánica, is a broad structural depression, the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin. The western part of this basin, which separates the Sierra de Coalcomán from the Cordillera Volcánica, is the valley of the Río Tepalcatepec, a major tributary of the Río Balsas. The eastern part of the basin is the valley of the Río Balsas. From the point of junction of the two rivers, the Río Balsas flows southward through a narrow gorge, which separates the Sierra de Coalcomán from the Sierra del Sur, to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33543"],["title","The Amphibians and Reptiles of Michoacán, México (#2)"],["body","Ocean. In Michoacán the floor of the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin varies from 200 to 700 meters above sea level.  The central part of México is a vast table-land, the Mexican Plateau, the southern part of which extends into northern Michoacán. In this region the terrain is rolling and varies from 1500 to 1900 meters above sea level. Many small mountain ranges rise from the plateau and break the continuity of the rolling table-land. Located on the southern part of the Mexican Plateau in Michoacán are several lakes, the largest of which are Lago de Chapala, Lago de Cuitzeo, and Lago de Pátzcuaro.  Bordering the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau is a nearly unbroken chain of volcanos, the Cordillera Volcánica. The highest peaks in Michoacán, Cerro San Andrés (3930 meters) and Cerro de Tancítaro (3870 meters), are in this range. Parts of the Cordillera Volcánica in Michoacán are known by separate names; these are, from west to east: Sierra de los Tarascos, Sierra de Ozumatlán, and Serranía de Ucareo.  Lying between the Tepalcatepec Valley and the Pacific Ocean, and east of the Río Coahuayana and west of the Río Balsas, is an isolated highland mass, the Sierra de Coalcomán. This mountain range rises to elevations of slightly more than 3000 meters. It has a length of about 200 kilometers and a width of about 80 kilometers. Except for a relatively low connection with the Cordillera Volcánica, the Sierra de Coalcomán is isolated from other mountain ranges in southwestern México.   CLIMATE  The climates in Michoacán vary from tropical in the lowlands to cool temperate at high elevations in the Sierra de Coalcomán and Cordillera Volcánica. The highest temperatures are known in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin, where at Churumuco the mean annual temperature is 29.3° C. and the range of monthly means is 3.5° C. (Contreras, 1942). Frosts occur sporadically on the Mexican Plateau, and in the winter snow falls on the highest mountains.  Precipitation varies geographically and seasonally. Most of the rain falls between June and October. In the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin rainfall in the rest of the year is negligible. The annual average rainfall at Coahuayana on the Pacific Coastal Plain is 871 mm. (Guzmán-Rivas, 1957:52). In the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin rainfall seldom exceeds 800 mm. per year. In the mountains precipitation is heavier and somewhat more evenly distributed throughout the year, but still definitely cyclic. For example, Uruapan (elevation, 1500 meters) receives an average annual rainfall of 1674 mm. (Contreras, 1942). The prevailing winds are from the Pacific Ocean. The southern (windward) slopes of the Sierra de Coalcomán probably receive more rain than any other part of the state. The Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin lies in a rain shadow of the Sierra de Coalcomán, and the Mexican Plateau lies in a somewhat less drastic rain shadow of the Cordillera Volcánica; these are the driest regions in the state.   VEGETATION AND ANIMAL HABITATS  For the purposes of this report I have adopted the classification of types of vegetation that seem to me most significant in terms of ecological distribution of reptiles and amphibians in Michoacán. These types are as follows:      TEMPERATE (1000-4000 meters)       Fir Forest (2400-4000 meters)       Pine-oak Forest (1000-4000 meters)       Mesquite-grassland (1500-2100 meters)      TROPICAL (0-1000 meters)       Arid Tropical Scrub Forest (0-1000 meters)       Tropical Semi-deciduous Forest (150-600 meters)  The vegetation of the Pacific Coastal Plain and the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin consists of arid tropical scrub forest, composed of deciduous trees, which in many places are stunted and widely spaced. In the dry season there is little cover provided by this forest. In the rainy season there is a sparse growth of grasses and some shade provided by the small leaves of the thorny trees.  In Michoacán the rainfall is heaviest on the southern slopes of the Sierra de Coalcomán and somewhat less so on the southwestern slopes of the Cordillera Volcánica. At these relatively low elevations (150 to 600 meters) there is tropical semi-deciduous forest, characterized by relatively dense shade throughout the year and by a leaf mulch on the ground. This type of forest forms the gallery forest along the larger streams in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin and on the Pacific Coastal Plain.  Rainfall also is heavy on the high mountain ridges, where temperatures are low. On these ridges, fir forest, often mixed with pine and oaks, is found. This habitat is characterized by a cool, moist climate, many rotting logs, and a moist ground cover of leaves and needles.  Most of the mountains are covered with pine-oak forest, which in most places is decidedly subhumid, but where this forest occurs on the windward sides of high ridges, it sometimes is noticeably humid. In this forest the important animal habitats include the needle- and leaf-litter, and in some areas, bromeliads.  The rolling terrain of the Mexican Plateau supports cacti, small leguminous trees, and grasses. Like the arid tropical scrub forest, this type of vegetation, the Mesquite-grassland association, is deciduous and thus provides little shelter in the dry season. Unlike the areas in which arid tropical scrub forest is developed, the Mesquite-grassland is found in areas having warm days and cool nights.     GEOGRAPHY OF THE HERPETOFAUNA   Although the main part of my final report on the herpetofauna of Michoacán will deal with the geographical and ecological patterns of distribution of the herpetofauna, a brief summary of the faunal assemblages is presented here.  In Michoacán there are two major faunal assemblages, one in the lowlands, and one in the highlands. A large number of the species inhabiting the lowlands are wide-ranging species, such as _Bufo marinus_, _Iguana iguana_, and _Boa constrictor_. Sixty-three species are known to occur on the Pacific Coastal Plain; 41 of these, together with 36 others occur in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin, a physiographic region to which several species of reptiles are endemic; for example, _Enyaliosaurus clarki_, _Urosaurus gadowi_, _Cnemidophorus calidipes_, and _Eumeces altamirani_.  Generally speaking, the members of the highland faunal assemblage have more restricted geographic ranges. The major exceptions are those species that are widely distributed on the Mexican Plateau, such as: _Bufo compactilis_, _Sceloporus torquatus_, and _Salvadora bairdi_. In the montane habitats of the Cordillera Volcánica, 45 species of amphibians and reptiles are known; 34 species have been found in the Sierra de Coalcomán. Fourteen species are known to occur in both ranges. Several species are known only from the Cordillera Volcánica and adjacent highlands, and three species are endemic to the Sierra de Coalcomán.     ANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES   In the following pages the 176 species and subspecies of amphibians and reptiles known to occur in the state of Michoacán are discussed in relation to their variation, life histories, ecology, and distribution in the state. Data have been gathered from 9676 specimens. I have not prolonged the accounts of species with information that has been presented elsewhere. Consequently, the length and completeness of the accounts are variable. I have given only the information that I consider a worthwhile contribution to our knowledge of the particular species.  The synonymies given at the beginning of each account include the first use of the trivial name by the original author, the first usage of the combination that I am using, and, if the circumstances make it necessary, additional names or combinations that have been proposed since the publication of the checklists of Mexican amphibians and reptiles by Smith and Taylor (1945, 1948, and 1950b). References cited only in the synonymies are not listed in the Literature Cited. Preceding the discussion of each species is an alphabetical list of the localities in Michoacán from which specimens have been examined. The listing of a locality means that one or more specimens, as indicated, has been examined from that locality. Only for those specimens especially mentioned in the text are catalogue numbers given.
