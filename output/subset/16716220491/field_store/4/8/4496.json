Harris, and published by him in his _The American Angler_ when I became his managing editor.  \"Trout Flies, Artificial and Natural\" and \"The Brook Trout Incognito\" are elaborations of studies I composed for _Forest and Stream_.  And many of the items in \"Little Casts,\" etc., are from a collection of paragraphs I have contributed to the New York _Herald_, the New York _Press_, and various sporting periodicals in past years.  The extracts from the article by Willis Boyd Allen are reprinted by permission of _Scribner's Magazine_.  For the little pen-and-ink sketches I am indebted to our jovial artist, Leppert.  The picture, \"Taking the Fly,\" is a reproduction from an etching in my possession, presented to me by Mr. William M. Carey, whose etchings and paintings in oil are well known to American sportsmen.  \"The Fly Rod's Victim\" is reproduced from a photograph framed in birch bark and presented to me by the poet, Isaac McLellan.  \"The Brook Trout\" illustration is from a photograph of a captive specimen in an aquarium, the engraving being loaned me by the late John P. Burkhard.

But it     seems that He must have been busy in their behalf while he was     waiting; for there was a bright fire of coals on the shore, and a     goodly fish broiling thereon, and bread to eat with it. And when     the Master had asked them about their fishing he said: 'Come, now,     and get your breakfast.' So they sat down around the fire, and     with His own hands he served them with the bread and the     fish.\"--HENRY VAN DYKE.      \"The first men that our Saviour dear     Did choose to wait upon Him here.     Blest fishers were....\"                                   W. BASSE.      \"I would ... fish in the sky whose bottom is pebbly with     stars.\"--THOREAU.   The principal fishes of the Sea of Galilee to-day are the same as they were two thousand years ago--bream and chub. These were taken in olden times by both net and hook and line.  The fishermen whom Christ chose as His disciples--Peter. Andrew, James, and John--were professional net fishermen, but hook and line fishing was a favorite pastime of the well-to-do Egyptians as well as the poor people who could not afford a net.  Weirs not unlike the modern article were used in the Holy Land in Bible time, excepting on Lake Gennesaret, where the law of the land forbade them.  The bream and the chub were eaten alike by rich and poor people. Wayfarers roasted them over chip fires in the groves and on the lake shores, housewives boiled and broiled them, and the wealthy man served them at his banquets. \"Moses, the friend of God,\" writes Izaak Walton, in his immortal _Compleat Angler_, quoting from Lev. xi., 9, Deut., xiv., 9, \"appointed fish to be the chief diet for the best commonwealth that ever yet was. The mightiest feasts have been of fish.\"  Our Saviour \"fed the people on fish when they were hungry.\" The species is not alluded to in the Biblical paragraph, but no doubt the fish feasts of the Lord were mostly of chub and bream. Jesus loved fishermen and was in their society most of His time. No other class of men were so well favored by Him. He inspired St. Peter, St. John, St. Andrew, and St. James, poor fishermen, who drew their nets for the people, and these four fishermen, declares Father Izaak, \"He never reproved for their employment or calling, as he did scribes and money changers.\"  The Lord's favorite places of labor and repose--the places He most frequented--were near the fishes and fisherman. \"He began to teach by the seaside. His pulpit was a fishing boat or the shore of a lake. He was in the stern of the boat, asleep. He was always near the water to cheer and comfort those who followed it.\" And Walton tells us that \"when God intended to reveal high notions to His prophets He carried them to the shore, that He might settle their mind in a quiet repose.\"  Bream and chub are not monster fishes--they do not average the great weights of the tarpon and the tuna; they are of the small and medium-size species; so, if the apostles were pleased with \"ye gods and little fishes,\" we mortals of to-day should be satisfied with our catch, be it ever so small.

Weighs up to ten pounds in large waters. There is a record of one weighing eleven pounds. This specimen was taken in northwestern Maine. Averages three quarters of a pound to one pound and a half in the streams, and one pound to three pounds in the lakes and ponds. Occurs between latitude 32-1/2° and 55°, in the lakes and streams of the Atlantic watershed, near the sources of a few rivers flowing into the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico, and some of the southern affluents of Hudson Bay, its range being limited by the western foothills of the Alleghanies, extending about three hundred miles from the coast, except about the Great Lakes, in the northern tributaries of which it abounds. It also inhabits the headwaters of the Chattahoochee, in the southern spurs of the Georgia Alleghanies and tributaries of the Catawba in North Carolina, and clear waters of the great islands of the Gulf of St. Lawrence--Anticosti, Cape Breton.
