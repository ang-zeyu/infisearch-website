What can they want of us?\"  His father frowned. \"Only way to find out is to open it and see.\" He squatted down to study the cylinder closer. Burl pointed a finger at the nose.  \"Looks like a crack there. Maybe it unscrews. Let's lift it.\"  It was not as heavy as it had appeared, for, like all rocket missiles, it was made of the light but tough alloys that were necessary to conserve weight-lift costs and fuel reserves. They stood it upright and tried to turn the top. After a little resistance, it unscrewed slowly. Inside, they found a rolled document bearing the seal of the United States Air Force.  Burl took it out, and unfolded it with unsteady hands. His father read over his shoulder.  Gonzales poked at the empty cylinder, impatiently. Finally, he burst out, \"What does it say? What do they want?\"  Burl turned to him. \"It's unbelievable! It's--it's just so darned surprising! The dimness of the days, the drop in temperature--it wasn't just around here! It was all over the world!\"  Quickly, he went on to tell the Peruvian what they had just learned. The communication was from the U.S. Space Commission and it had been directed on its flight from California by the Moon Base, because only from the satellite could the exact location of the Dennings be spotted. It seemed that the Dennings were the only scientifically trained personnel close to the point on Earth where the disturbance originated. This also accounted for the blanketing of radio waves in their vicinity. Several airplanes had tried to locate them, but strange disturbances in the ether and atmosphere had made it impossible to establish contact. Also, the back reaches of the Andes were poorly mapped and treacherous in air currents, even in normal times.  \"During the last week, a certain fraction of the Sun's light and energy reaching the Earth has been diverted. It has been bent or focused in much the same way that a lens bends light rays--and the point to which it has been directed is a spot only seven miles from here! Over that last mountain range,\" said Burl, pointing.  Gonzales followed his finger. \"Just over the mountains lies the source of the trouble,\" said Burl excitedly. \"And we're the nearest to it. They want us to go over there, see what it is, stop it, or report back. It took the telescopes in Moon Base to locate us and to track the center of the trouble!\"  Mark Denning pursed his lips. \"We'll have to start tomorrow, and we'll have to go fast. A loss of light and heat, however slight, could have very serious effects on life if continued too long. We can make it by tomorrow night, if we start early and leave the Indians and pack animals behind.\"  The other two nodded. Mark looked at them in the half-light of the Moon. \"You'll have to stay with the equipment, Pedro, otherwise the Indians might abandon it. Burl and I will start out at dawn.\"  Gonzales agreed and the three made their way back to the camp. At the first sign of light breaking in the morning horizon, Burl and his father started off. They carried only enough equipment for survival, plus the additional items that might be needed for the emergency ahead.  The trek over the mountains was a hard one, the path narrow, steep, sometimes nonexistent. There were few signs of Indians or animals, and it was plain that few ever traveled over this range. The air was cold and thin, vegetation sparse and hardy. All around them was the cold blue of the sky--a shade darker than usual--and the gaunt peaks of ancient mountains. The Inca kings may have claimed the land here, but even their hardy legions had never conquered these lonely and hostile sky domains.  Panting and weary with hours of climbing, Burl and his father made a quick lunch in a sheltered jumble of rock near the top. Then, shouldering their packs again, they trudged on. At last they reached a point where the view of the other side spread out before them--a breathtakingly clear vision of the little valley below.  As they looked down, the air seemed to shimmer and vibrate. Burl rubbed his eyes. \"It hurts,\" he said.  His father squinted. \"There's a powerful vibrational effect. It may be a very dangerous concentration of the invisible rays of the Sun as well as of light.\"  Once Burl had gotten used to the odd visual effect, which was like gazing into the twisting heat rays rising from an overheated oven, he saw that there was a small flat region between the mountains. And in the center of this valley was a large black structure of some sort. The twisting effect of the light around it made it impossible to tell more.  \"That's it,\" said Burl. His father nodded, shifted the pack to ease his shoulders, unstrapped the hunting rifle slung over his back, and carefully checked its loads.  Burl saw what his father was doing and suddenly understood the danger. What could be doing a thing like this? What but something not of this Earth? Something of distant space, of a science beyond that of man--and _unfriendly_ besides. Now, for the first time, Burl realized what he had not had time to before--this was an enemy he and his father were facing--an enemy of all mankind--and utterly unknown.  He gulped, gripped his rifle, and followed his father down the sliding rocky trail.  As they drew nearer the base of the mountain, the effects of the strange vibrations grew more pronounced. Burl avoided looking directly ahead, keeping his eyes on the ground before his feet, yet even so, he could not help noticing how the stones around them seemed to shimmer in the invisible waves. From the base of the valley the sky now seemed streaked with black and gray rings, as if they were reaching the center of some atmospheric whirlpool. Out of the mountains, after hours of arduous scrambling, they started across the barren rocky plain.  Before them rose a vast circular structure several stories high, ominously black and without any sign of windows or doors. Above the building protruded two great projections ending in huge, shining discs. One of the monstrous cuplike discs was facing the Sun, the other pointed in the opposite direction.  As the two men came nearer and nearer, the strangeness in the air increased. They felt they were being penetrated through and through with invisible lances, with tiny prickles of heat. \"Radiation?\" queried Burl softly, afraid of the answer. His father trudged grimly on for a moment, and then put down his pack. He took out a Geiger counter and activated it.  He shook his head. \"No radioactivity,\" he said. \"Whatever this is, it isn't that.\"  They reached the wall of the building. Oddly, here they seemed sheltered from the unusual vibrations. Burl realized that the source was above them, probably the two mighty discs raised high in the sky.  The Dennings surveyed the building, but found no entrance. It must have been a quarter of a mile around its walls, but there was no sign of a door or entry. The wall was of a rocklike substance, but it was not like any rock or plastic Burl had ever seen.  \"We've got to get in,\" said Burl as they returned to the starting point, \"but how?\"  His father smiled. \"This way.\" He opened his pack and took two cans of blasting powder from it. \"I thought these would come in handy. Lucky we had some left over from the blasting we did last week.\"  He set both cans at the base of the high wall, wired them together, and ran the wire as far as it reached. When the two men were a safe distance away, Mark sparked off the explosive.  There was a thunderous roar: rocks and dirt showered around them, and bits of black powdery stuff. When the smoke cleared, Burl and his father leaped to their feet, rifles in hand.  There was a crack in the side of the wall where the explosive had gone off. And the rip was large enough to get through!  Without a word, they charged across the ground, still smoking from the concussion, and squeezed through the mysterious walls of the enigmatic building.  The walls were thin, thin but hard, as befit masters of atomic engineering. Inside, they found a roomless building--one single chamber within the frame of the outer walls.  A dim, bluish light emanated from the curving ceiling. On the uncleared rocky ground which was the floor of the building were a number of huge machines.  They were spherical glassy inventions, many times the height of a man, connected by strings of thick metal bars and rows of smaller globes, none of which was familiar. There was a steady humming noise, and above, the two giant, metal masts penetrating the ceiling rotated slowly. Doubtless, the great Sun-trapping discs were affixed to the top of these masts.  There was no living thing in sight.  Burl and his father stood silently, half crouched, with rifles at the ready, but nothing moved to challenge them. There was only the humming of the Sun transmitters.  Burl called out, but there was no answer. They advanced cautiously, fearing a trap. The place did not have the look of living things about it. \"An automatic station,\" said Mark under his breath. \"I think it's strictly automatic.\"  It gradually became evident that Mark was right. Everything was automatic. Whoever had built this structure to divert the rays of the Sun had simply set it down, put it in motion, and left. There was no evidence of any provisions for a garrison or a director.  They studied the machines but could make nothing of them. They found what looked like controls, but although they pushed and pulled the levers and knobs, the humming did not cease. It seemed as if the controls were either dummies or had to be specially motivated.  \"What do we do now?\" asked Burl, after they had tried pulling all the levers on one particular switchboard without any results. \"Do you have enough powder left to blow up the machinery?\"  His father shook his head. \"I had only those two cans with me. We could try shooting into the machinery.\" Leveling his rifle, he fired at a glassy globe"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33648"],["title","The Mammals of Warren Woods, Berrien County, Michigan (#1)"],["body"," covered with a mixed forest in which the linden, _Tilia americana_, white elm, _Ulmus americana_, and sycamore, _Platanus occidentalis_, are conspicuous species. Under this forest there are a few small trees, but there is very little underbrush. The herbage also is sparse and, though in a few places there is a considerable growth of ferns, grasses, and sedges, and of other herbs, there are also many bare areas.  One of the significant features of the flood-plains, so far as the mammals are concerned, is the flooding to which these areas are subjected during the spring high-water. At that time the flood-plain for a number of days or weeks may be covered with several feet of water.  During the period between July 29 and August 28 a total of one hundred and seventy mouse traps set in the flood-plain forests along the Galien River took for the first nights' trapping, twenty-two northern white-footed mice and one house mouse. Short-tailed shrews, more white-footed mice, pine voles, and a jumping mouse were secured on nights after the first. Larger traps took during the whole period one raccoon, one New York weasel, and two woodchucks. Several other woodchucks and a number of red squirrels were seen. Ridges of moles were numerous, but no specimens were secured. Tooth marks on an old, partly fallen linden were probably made, perhaps a number of years ago, by a porcupine.  Throughout the woods there are a number of small ravines. These ravines are forested with trees mostly of the flood-plain type, and there is evidence in many of the ravines, at least in their lower parts, that flooding occurs in the ravine bottom during the spring.  Fifty mouse traps set August 26 in a large ravine north of the county road took on the first day five northern white-footed mice and one house mouse. Short-tailed shrews, more white-footed mice, and pine voles were trapped on following days. Here also red squirrels and a cottontail were seen, and tracks of raccoon noted. Evidently the fauna is the same as that of the flood-plain, with which it is here included.   _Beech-maple forest habitat_:       _Blarina brevicauda talpoides._ Short-tailed shrew. 7.       _Procyon lotor lotor._ Raccoon. Tracks.       _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed      mouse. 86.       _Microtus pinetorum scalopsoides._ Northern pine vole. 5.       _Zapus hudsonius hudsonius._ Hudson Bay jumping mouse. 1.       _Marmota monax monax._ Southern woodchuck. Burrows.       _Tamias striatus lysteri._ Northeastern chipmunk. 1.       _Sciurus hudsonicus loquax._ Southern red squirrel. 10.       _Sciurus niger rufiventer._ Fox squirrel. 7.       _Sylvilagus floridanus mearnsii._ Mearns cottontail. 1.  The climax forest of the region is dominated by the beech, _Fagus grandiflora_, and the sugar maple, _Acer saccharum_. The trees in this forest are very large, so that the forest crown is high and the shade dense. Only a few small trees occur and these are mostly young beeches and young sugar maples. The underbrush varies much in height and denseness; mostly it is quite open, so that one can easily walk through the forest, but in a few places the growth is more dense. Common members of the underbrush on the higher ground are the small beeches, sugar maples, and the spice-bush, _Benzoin aestivale_; while on the lower benches along the river seedlings of the paw-paw dominate the undergrowth. The ground is heavily covered by decaying leaves and a little dead brush and fallen branches, but nearly all the logs have been removed. Early in the spring a thick growth of herbs covers the ground, but by July the herbs are mostly gone, only a few remaining, and there are many small bare areas covered only by leaves. The soil under this forest seems to be mainly clay; in spring or after heavy rains pools of water are formed, and these remain for a long time.  Between July 21 and August 27 a total of two hundred and eighty-five mouse traps set in the upland forest took on the first nights one short-tailed shrew and thirty northern white-footed mice. In addition to these species pine voles and a jumping mouse were trapped on days after the first. One shrew was caught alive August 30, as he was running about on the forest floor at 7:30 A.M. A few tracks of raccoon were seen from time to time on the road leading through the woods. A few fresh burrows of woodchucks were noted at the edges of benches and of ravines. A few red squirrels were seen at different times and two collected. Fox squirrels were rare, being noted only a few times; Mr. Norman A. Wood also saw these squirrels on two occasions in May. One cottontail was shot, in the climax forest. Mr. Wood collected a chipmunk in the climax forest on May 15, 1918, and saw another in the same habitat in May, 1919.   _Aerial habitat_:  Bats were seen on a few evenings, flying about over the climax forest, and over the adjacent region, but they were extremely rare, and efforts to shoot a specimen failed.     MODIFIED AND ARTIFICIAL HABITATS   _Second-growth forest and scrub habitat_:       _Mustela noveboracensis noveboracensis._ New York weasel. 1.       _Mephitis nigra._ Eastern skunk. 1.       _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed      mouse. 5.       _Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus._ Pennsylvania vole. 4.       _Mus musculus musculus._ House mouse. 1.       _Marmota monax monax._ Southern woodchuck. 1.       _Sciurus hudsonicus loquax._ Southern red squirrel. 1.       _Sylvilagus floridanus mearnsii._ Mearns cottontail. 5.  Small trees and brush have grown up along the edges of many of the ravines in the cleared fields in and surrounding the preserve. Many of the trees are oaks, but beech and hard maple also occur, a few of them being relics from the original forest. Considerable brush is present, formed by a large variety of species. A few other small patches, especially in ravine bottoms and on flood-plains have been allowed to grow up to brush and small trees. In nearly every case these areas are heavily pastured.  The conditions here included in the second-growth forest and scrub habitat are not homogeneous, but differ in each different location where the habitat is found, tree and shrub species abundant in one situation not being present in another. The habitat is usually narrow in extent, being often confined to the width of the steep ravine wall.  Owing to its poor development and uncertain characteristics no intensive trapping was done in this type of habitat. A weasel was trapped in open beech-maple-oak forest at the edge of a cleared ravine, and a woodchuck was shot in the same type of habitat. Another woodchuck and a skunk were trapped at different times in low willow brush on the banks of the river just north of the woods. Northern white-footed mice, Pennsylvania voles, and a house mouse were trapped in thick oak brush and trees alongside a road north of the woods. A red squirrel was shot in second-growth oak and aspen woods in the north part of the preserve, and they were seen in open woods along ravines. Cottontails were noted a few times in blackberry thickets, in brush in ravines, in clearings along the river, and in beech-maple-oak forest along ravines.   _Cleared-ravine sedge habitat_:       _Blarina brevicauda talpoides._ Short-tailed shrew. 1.       _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed      mouse. 3.       _Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus._ Pennsylvania vole. 5.  A large ravine south of the river had been cleared of trees evidently several years previously, and it has now grown up mostly to sedges, grass, and iris in its more moist parts. Along the little brook which flows through the ravine there is a fringe of willows, and among the sedges a number of shrubs and small trees occur, mostly thorns and a few young sycamores and black walnuts.  Fifty mouse traps set in this habitat took on the first day, August 16, three northern white-footed mice and three Pennsylvania voles. More voles and a short-tailed shrew were taken on later days.   _Cleared-upland rush habitat_:       _Mephitis nigra._ Eastern skunk. Den.       _Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii._ Prairie white-footed mouse. 1.       _Synaptomys cooperi._ Cooper lemming-vole. 1.       _Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus._ Pennsylvania vole. 7.       _Microtus ochrogaster._ Prairie vole. 1.       _Citellus tridecemlineatus tridecemlineatus._ Thirteen-striped      ground squirrel. 2.  In the shallow, poorly drained depressions of the cleared upland the vegetation is dominated by rushes, which grow in clumps and form a thick growth, reaching a height of about one meter as a maximum. At the edges of the habitat and in places not thickly covered by the rushes a growth of sedges, grasses, and moss covers the ground; but under the thickest growth of rushes the ground is bare and is evidently covered by water during a part of the year. On this upland one small pond surrounded by rushes did not dry up until late in August. In a few places small blackberry thickets occur in the areas of rushes and dominate all other plants.  Fifty traps set in this habitat, on August 8, took on the first night one prairie white-footed mouse and one Pennsylvania vole; the prairie white-footed mouse was taken just at the edge of the growth of rushes. Other Pennsylvania voles as well as a lemming-vole, a prairie vole, and several young ground squirrels were secured on later nights by the same trap-line. A skunk den was situated in a blackberry thicket in the midst of the largest patch of rushes.   _Cleared-upland sedge habitat_:       _Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii._ Prairie white-footed mouse. 3.       _Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus._ Pennsylvania vole. 1.       _Microtus ochrogaster._ Prairie vole. 9.       _Mus musculus musculus._ House mouse. 1.       _Citellus tridecemlineatus tridecemlineatus._ Thirteen-striped      ground squirrel.
