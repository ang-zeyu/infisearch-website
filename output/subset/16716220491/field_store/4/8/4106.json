Whereupon the mother of my flesh, being much troubled (since, with a heart pure in Thy faith, she even more lovingly travailed in birth of my salvation), would in eager haste have provided for my consecration and cleansing by the health-giving sacraments, confessing Thee, Lord Jesus, for the remission of sins, unless I had suddenly recovered. And so, as if I must needs be again polluted should I live, my cleansing was deferred, because the defilements of sin would, after that washing, bring greater and more perilous guilt. I then already believed: and my mother, and the whole household, except my father: yet did not he prevail over the power of my mother's piety in me, that as he did not yet believe, so neither should I. For it was her earnest care that Thou my God, rather than he, shouldest be my father; and in this Thou didst aid her to prevail over her husband, whom she, the better, obeyed, therein also obeying Thee, who hast so commanded.    I beseech Thee, my God, I would fain know, if so Thou willest, for what purpose my baptism was then deferred? was it for my good that the rein was laid loose, as it were, upon me, for me to sin? or was it not laid loose? If not, why does it still echo in our ears on all sides, \"Let him alone, let him do as he will, for he is not yet baptised?\" but as to bodily health, no one says, \"Let him be worse wounded, for he is not yet healed.\" How much better then, had I been at once healed; and then, by my friends' and my own, my soul's recovered health had been kept safe in Thy keeping who gavest it. Better truly. But how many and great waves of temptation seemed to hang over me after my boyhood! These my mother foresaw; and preferred to expose to them the clay whence I might afterwards be moulded, than the very cast, when made.    In boyhood itself, however (so much less dreaded for me than youth), I loved not study, and hated to be forced to it. Yet I was forced; and this was well done towards me, but I did not well; for, unless forced, I had not learnt. But no one doth well against his will, even though what he doth, be well. Yet neither did they well who forced me, but what was well came to me from Thee, my God. For they were regardless how I should employ what they forced me to learn, except to satiate the insatiate desires of a wealthy beggary, and a shameful glory. But Thou, by whom the very hairs of our head are numbered, didst use for my good the error of all who urged me to learn; and my own, who would not learn, Thou didst use for my punishment--a fit penalty for one, so small a boy and so great a sinner. So by those who did not well, Thou didst well for me; and by my own sin Thou didst justly punish me. For Thou hast commanded, and so it is, that every inordinate affection should be its own punishment.  But why did I so much hate the Greek, which I studied as a boy? I do not yet fully know. For the Latin I loved; not what my first masters, but what the so-called grammarians taught me. For those first lessons, reading, writing and arithmetic, I thought as great a burden and penalty as any Greek. And yet whence was this too, but from the sin and vanity of this life, because I was flesh, and a breath that passeth away and cometh not again? For those first lessons were better certainly, because more certain; by them I obtained, and still retain, the power of reading what I find written, and myself writing what I will; whereas in the others, I was forced to learn the wanderings of one Aeneas, forgetful of my own, and to weep for dead Dido, because she killed herself for love; the while, with dry eyes, I endured my miserable self dying among these things, far from Thee, O God my life.  For what more miserable than a miserable being who commiserates not himself; weeping the death of Dido for love to Aeneas, but weeping not his own death for want of love to Thee, O God. Thou light of my heart, Thou bread of my inmost soul, Thou Power who givest vigour to my mind, who quickenest my thoughts, I loved Thee not. I committed fornication against Thee, and all around me thus fornicating there echoed \"Well done! well done!\" for the friendship of this world is fornication against Thee; and \"Well done! well done!\" echoes on till one is ashamed not to be thus a man. And for all this I wept not, I who wept for Dido slain, and \"seeking by the sword a stroke and wound extreme,\" myself seeking the while a worse extreme, the extremest and lowest of Thy creatures, having forsaken Thee, earth passing into the earth. And if forbid to read all this, I was grieved that I might not read what grieved me. Madness like this is thought a higher and a richer learning, than that by which I learned to read and write.  But now, my God, cry Thou aloud in my soul; and let Thy truth tell me, \"Not so, not so. Far better was that first study.\" For, lo, I would readily forget the wanderings of Aeneas and all the rest, rather than how to read and write. But over the entrance of the Grammar School is a vail drawn! true; yet is this not so much an emblem of aught recondite, as a cloak of error. Let not those, whom I no longer fear, cry out against me, while I confess to Thee, my God, whatever my soul will, and acquiesce in the condemnation of my evil ways, that I may love Thy good ways. Let not either buyers or sellers of grammar-learning cry out against me. For if I question them whether it be true that Aeneas came on a time to Carthage, as the poet tells, the less learned will reply that they know not, the more learned that he never did. But should I ask with what letters the name \"Aeneas\" is written, every one who has learnt this will answer me aright, as to the signs which men have conventionally settled. If, again, I should ask which might be forgotten with least detriment to the concerns of life, reading and writing or these poetic fictions? who does not foresee what all must answer who have not wholly forgotten themselves? I sinned, then, when as a boy I preferred those empty to those more profitable studies, or rather loved the one and hated the other. \"One and one, two\"; \"two and two, four\"; this was to me a hateful singsong: \"the wooden horse lined with armed men,\" and \"the burning of Troy,\" and \"Creusa's shade and sad similitude,\" were the choice spectacle of my vanity.  Why then did I hate the Greek classics, which have the like tales? For Homer also curiously wove the like fictions, and is most sweetly vain, yet was he bitter to my boyish taste. And so I suppose would Virgil be to Grecian children, when forced to learn him as I was Homer. Difficulty, in truth, the difficulty of a foreign tongue, dashed, as it were, with gall all the sweetness of Grecian fable. For not one word of it did I understand, and to make me understand I was urged vehemently with cruel threats and punishments. Time was also (as an infant) I knew no Latin; but this I learned without fear or suffering, by mere observation, amid the caresses of my nursery and jests of friends, smiling and sportively encouraging me. This I learned without any pressure of punishment to urge me on, for my heart urged me to give birth to its conceptions, which I could only do by learning words not of those who taught, but of those who talked with me; in whose ears also I gave birth to the thoughts, whatever I conceived. No doubt, then, that a free curiosity has more force in our learning these things, than a frightful enforcement. Only this enforcement restrains the rovings of that freedom, through Thy laws, O my God, Thy laws, from the master's cane to the martyr's trials, being able to temper for us a wholesome bitter, recalling us to Thyself from that deadly pleasure which lures us from Thee.  Hear, Lord, my prayer; let not my soul faint under Thy discipline, nor let me faint in confessing unto Thee all Thy mercies, whereby Thou hast drawn me out of all my most evil ways, that Thou mightest become a delight to me above all the allurements which I once pursued; that I may most entirely love Thee, and clasp Thy hand with all my affections, and Thou mayest yet rescue me from every temptation, even unto the end. For lo, O Lord, my King and my God, for Thy service be whatever useful thing my childhood learned; for Thy service, that I speak, write, read, reckon. For Thou didst grant me Thy discipline, while I was learning vanities; and my sin of delighting in those vanities Thou hast forgiven. In them, indeed, I learnt many a useful word, but these may as well be learned in things not vain; and that is the safe path for the steps of youth.  But woe is thee, thou torrent of human custom! Who shall stand against thee? how long shalt thou not be dried up? how long roll the sons of Eve into that huge and hideous ocean, which even they scarcely overpass who climb the cross? Did not I read in thee of Jove the thunderer and the adulterer? both, doubtless, he could not be; but so the feigned thunder might countenance and pander to real adultery. And now which of our gowned masters lends a sober ear to one who from their own school cries out, \"These were Homer's fictions, transferring things human to the gods; would he had brought down things divine to us!\" Yet more truly had he said, \"These are indeed his fictions; but attributing a divine nature to wicked men, that crimes might be no longer crimes, and whoso commits them might seem to imitate not abandoned men, but the celestial gods.\"  And yet, thou hellish torrent, into thee are cast the sons of men with rich rewards, for compassing such learning; and a great solemnity is made of it, when this is going on in the forum, within sight of laws appointing a salary beside the scholar's payments; and thou lashest thy rocks and roarest, \"Hence words are learnt; hence eloquence; most necessary to gain your ends, or maintain opinions.\" As if we should have never known such words as \"golden shower,\" \"lap,\" \"beguile,\" \"temp"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32974"],["title","The Elements of Blowpipe Analysis (#1)"],["body",". It should be well burnt, and should not scintillate or smoke.  The platinum supports are generally in the form of wire and foil. Platinum-tipped forceps are frequently employed in blowpipe analysis.  Glass is used in the form of tubing.  Hard glass tubing, 3 mm. bore, is drawn off into ignition tubes 7-8 cm. in length. Several dozen of these tubes should be made before commencing the tests of the next chapter.   ~Apparatus.~--A small agate mortar, 4-5 cm. in diameter, should be provided in which to grind the samples to be examined.  The pestle, which should also be of agate, must be adapted to the mortar in shape and size.  Two pairs of forceps will also be needed.  One pair should be of steel, and the other pair of brass, with fine points.  Of other apparatus, the most necessary is:--      A small hammer and anvil.      Two three-cornered files.      Small piece of cobalt glass, about 5 × 10 cm.      Pocket magnifying lens.      Several small watch glasses--for metallic beads, etc.   ~Chemicals.~--A list of the principal chemicals is here given:--      Sodium carbonate, Na_{2}CO_{3}.      Borax, Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7} + 10 H_{2}O.      Microcosmic salt, (HNaNH_{4}), PO_{4} + 8 H_{2}O.      Cobalt nitrate, Co(NO_{3})_{2} + 5 H_{2}O.      Potassium cyanide, KCN.      Hydrochloric acid, (dilute), HCl + nH_{2}O.      Litmus paper, red and blue.      Brazil-wood paper.  Any other special reagents which may be needed will be mentioned as required.     CHAPTER II  GENERAL OUTLINE OF BLOWPIPE ANALYSIS        [ABBREVIATIONS: O. F. for oxidizing flame, R. F. for      reducing flame, Ch. for charcoal, Ct. for coating, Bp. for      blowpipe.]  In order to examine a substance before the blowpipe to determine the presence or absence of certain elements, it becomes necessary to arrange a systematic method. As with all branches of chemical work, one's success is largely dependent upon neatness of manipulation and carefulness of observation.  The following order of observation is essentially that given by Berzelius:--       1. Examination on charcoal by itself.       2. Examination on charcoal with Na_{2}CO_{3}.       3. Examination in ignition tube with Na_{2}CO_{3} and      charcoal.       4. Examination on platinum wire.       5. Examination in borax bead.       6. Examination with Co(NO_{3})_{2}.  After having examined a body in these six different ways, we shall be able to say what are its principal constituents.  Before describing the method of carrying out these six different operations, it will be necessary to give a few definitions of terms which we shall have frequent occasion to employ.   ~Definitions.~--_Ignition_ is the heating of a substance to a high temperature.  _Fusion_ is the heating of a substance to the melting-point.  _Intumescence_ is the swelling of the substance upon heating.  _Decrepitation_ is the crackling of a substance due to the sudden expansion of combined water upon heating.  _Deflagration_ is the burning of a substance with explosive violence, generally due to excess of oxygen.  _Incandescence_ is the white light emitted by a substance that is infusible when subjected to a high temperature.   ~Examination on Charcoal alone.~--The size of the assay should be about that of a mustard seed. This is sufficiently large to show all of the reactions clearly, and though a larger piece would exhibit the characteristic phenomena, yet much more effort is required. A very small, shallow hole should be cut in the Ch. to receive the assay. The Bp. flame should be directed at an angle of about 30° with the surface of the Ch. Considerable care must be taken lest the hole in the Ch. is burned too deep and the assay lost in the coal.  The force of the air from the jet must also be borne in mind for a strong blast, or sudden puffs may blow the substance away.  The following changes are to be looked for:--  _a._ Whether the substance is volatile or non-volatile.  _Illustrations._ Examine before the Bp. on Ch. some arsenious oxide, As_{2}O_{3}, also some alumina, Al_{2}O_{3}.  _b._ Whether the substance is fusible or infusible.  _Illustrations._ Examine before the Bp. on Ch. some silver oxide, AgO, also some zinc oxide, ZnO.  _c._ Whether the substance is alkaline or non-alkaline when placed upon moistened red litmus.  _Illustrations._ Ignite some calcium carbonate, CaCO_{3}, before the Bp. on Ch., and place residue on moistened red litmus. In like manner, examine some magnesium carbonate, MgCO_{3}.  _d._ Color of coating on Ch. caused by combination of metal and oxygen due to heat of Bp. flame.  _Illustrations._ Examine some oxide of lead, PbO, before the Bp. on Ch., also some oxide of cadmium, CdO.  _e._ Decrepitation.  _Illustration._ Examine some sodium chloride, NaCl, before the Bp. on Ch.  _f._ Deflagration.  _Illustrations._ Examine some potassium nitrate, KNO_{3}, before the Bp. on Ch., also some ammonium nitrate, NH_{4}NO_{3}.  _g._ Intumescence.  _Illustration._ Examine some alum,      K_{2}Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{4},  before the Bp. on Ch.  _h._ Incandescence.  _Illustration._ Examine some oxide of barium, BaO, before the Bp. on Ch.  _i._ Formation of a metallic bead--color and malleability.  _Illustration._ Examine some silver oxide, AgO, before the Bp. on Ch.   ~Examination on Charcoal with Na_{2}CO_{3}.~--Metallic compounds are often difficult to reduce with the blowpipe flame alone, and hence no bead is obtained. In order to facilitate reduction and the obtaining of a metallic bead, the substance in a finely powdered condition is mixed with four parts of sodium carbonate, Na_{2}CO_{3}, and ignited before the Bp. on Ch. The metallic compound is decomposed, the metal being transformed into the carbonate, which in turn, through the agency of the Ch. and the heat of the flame, is reduced to the free metal. Sometimes the reduction is made easier by adding to the substance about its own bulk of potassium cyanide, KCN, which takes up oxygen from the compound and is converted into potassium cyanate, KCNO.  The reactions in reducing copper sulphate, CuSO_{4}, with Na_{2}CO_{3} and with KCN before the blowpipe, are here given:--      CuSO_{4} + Na_{2}CO_{3} = CuCO_{3} + Na_{2}SO_{4} }  (1)               2CuCO_{3} + C = 3CO_{2} + 2Cu           }      CuSO_{4} + Na_{2}CO_{3} = CuCO_{3} + Na_{2}SO_{4} }                    CuCO_{3} = CuO + CO_{2}            }  (2)                   CuO + KCN = Cu + KCNO               }  After obtaining beads, it is well to obtain their coatings, for oftentimes it is only in this way that we can distinguish between the metals.   ~Examination in Tube with Na_{2}CO_{3} and Charcoal.~--If the substance in a finely pulverized condition be mixed with twelve parts, Na_{2}CO_{3}, and six parts of charcoal powder and the mixture be placed in an ignition tube and subjected to heat, the acid of the substance combines with the soda and the metal is set free.  If this metal is volatile, a sublimate is formed in the upper end of the tube.  Mercury deposits in minute globules, which may be seen with the magnifying glass. Arsenic forms a ring, which, when examined with the magnifying glass, is seen to be made up of minute crystals. Ammonia is recognized by its characteristic odor, and also by its turning a slip of moistened red litmus (held over the mouth of the tube) blue.   ~Examination on Platinum Wire.~--Many substances possess the property of imparting to the colorless flame of the Bunsen burner characteristic colors.  The chlorides of these substances exhibit these flame reactions best, and hence before applying the flame tests we dip the wire which serves as a support into hydrochloric acid and then into the substance. When the substance has been taken up on the wire, it is placed in the edge of the long colorless flame of the Bunsen burner near the apex, when instantly the flame becomes tinged with the characteristic color of the substance.  _Illustrations._ Sodium compounds color the flame yellow, and a crystal of potassium dichromate appears colorless in the sodium light.  This sodium reaction is extremely delicate, it being possible to detect with ease a quantity of a sodium salt less than 1/3000000 of a milligram in weight.  Potassium colors the flame purplish-violet.  Barium colors the flame apple-green.  Strontium colors the flame crimson.  Calcium colors the flame orange-red, distinguished from strontium, by appearing gray when seen through blue glass.  Boracic acid colors the flame green when the substance has been moistened with glycerine.   ~Examination in Borax Bead.~--Borax, Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7}, and microcosmic salt,      NaNH_{4}H . PO_{4},  possess the property of dissolving many of the metallic oxides at the temperature of the Bunsen flame.  For example, with oxide of cobalt, the following reactions take place with the two fluxes:--      CoO + Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7} = Co(BO_{2})_{2} + 2 NaBO_{2}.  On heating, NaNH_{4}H. PO_{4}, it is decomposed into the metaphosphate of sodium, NaPO_{3},      CoO + NaPO_{3} = CoNaPO_{4}.  Now in such cases of solution the metallic oxides impart a characteristic color to the flux.  The platinum wire is the best support,--it is heated to incandescence in the Bunsen flame, and then is quickly dipped into the borax, when a small globule will adhere,--this is removed to the flame again when the borax melts to a clear glassy bead. While the bead is still melted, touch it to the finely pulverized substance and replace in the flame. In a few seconds the small particles of the substance will have dissolved, and the bead will be seen to have assumed the color characteristic of the substance. Note the color when hot and then when cold; often there is a wide difference. Then, too, the test should be made in both O. F. and R. F.  Some analysts prefer to make a small loop in the end of the wire before taking up the borax to make the bead. Care should be taken to see that the bead is colorless before bringing it in contact with the substance.  As the depth of color"]]]
