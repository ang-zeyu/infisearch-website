Certain answers to questions may not be given in the presence of an Earthwoman.\"  Fred whistled. \"The Ollies have mastered more than our language ... I thought you said they were noted mainly for their linguistic talents, Cliff.\"  I was surprised, too. In the space of a few hectic months our alien visitors had probed deeply into our culture, mores and taboos--and then had had the genius to instill their compounded discretions into their Soths.  I said, \"Satisfied, Vicki?\"  She was still arranging herself. Her lips curled up at the corners impishly. \"I'm almost disappointed,\" she said. \"I do an all-out striptease, and no one looks but my husband. Of course,\" she added thoughtfully, \"I suppose that's something....\"         *       *       *       *       *  Fred stayed with us until Sunday evening. I went down to the pier to smoke a good-night pipe with him, and get his private opinion.  \"I'm buying a hundred shares of Worldwide stock tomorrow,\" he declared. \"That critter is worth his weight in diamonds to every well-heeled housewife in the country. In fact, put me down for one of your first models. I wouldn't mind having a laundry sorter and morning coffee-pourer, myself.\"  \"Think he's safe, do you?\"  \"No more emotions than that stump over there. And it baffles me. He has self-awareness, pain-sensitivity and a fantastic vocabulary, yet I needled him all afternoon with every semantic hypo I could think of without getting a flicker of emotion out of him.\" He paused. \"Incidentally, I made him strip for me in my room. You'll be as confused as I was to learn that he's every inch a man in his format.\"  \"What?\" I exclaimed.  \"Made me wonder what his duties included back on his home planet ... but as I said, no emotions. With the set of built-in inhibitions he has, he'd beat a eunuch out of his job any day of the week.\"  A few seconds later, Fred dropped into his little two-seater and skimmed off for home, leaving me with a rather disturbing question in my mind.  I went back to the house and cornered Soth out in the kitchen alone. Vicki had him polishing all the antique silverware.  \"Are there female Soths?\" I asked point-blank.  He looked down at me with that relaxed, pink look and said, \"No, Mr. Collins,\" and went back to his polishing.  The damned liar. He knew what I meant. He justified himself on a technicality.         *       *       *       *       *  I left Vicki Monday morning with more confidence than I'd had in ages. She had slept especially well, and the only thing on her mind was Clumsy's disappearance. He hadn't shown up since Soth scared the fleas off him with that hiss.  At the office, I had my girl transcribe my notes and work up a memorandum to the board of directors. We sent it around before noon, and shortly after lunch I had calls from all ten of them, including the chairman. It was not that they considered it such a big thing--they were just plainly curious. We scheduled a meeting for Tuesday morning, to talk the thing over.  That night when I got home, all was serene. Soth served us cocktails, dinner and a late snack, and had the place tidied up by bedtime. He did all this and managed to remain virtually invisible. He moved so quietly and with such uncanny anticipation of our demands, it was if he were an old family retainer, long versed in our habits and customs.  Vicki bragged as she undressed that she had the giant hog-tied and jumping through hoops.  \"We even got half the excavation done for the rock wall,\" she said proudly.  On impulse, I went out into the hall and down to Soth's room, where I found him stretched out slaunchwise across the double bed.  He opened his eyes as I came in, but didn't stir.  \"Are you happy here?\" I asked bluntly.  He sat up and did something new. He answered my question with a question. \"Are you happy with my services?\"  I said, \"Yes, of course.\"  \"Then all is well,\" he replied simply, and lay down again.  It seemed like a satisfactory answer. He radiated a feeling of peace, and the expression of repose on his heavy features was assuring.         *       *       *       *       *  It rained hard and cold during the night. I hadn't shown Soth how to start the automatic heating unit. When I left the house next morning, he was bringing Vicki her breakfast in bed, a tray on one arm and a handful of kindling under the other. Only once had he watched me build a fire in the fireplace, but he proceeded with confidence.  We flew blind through filthy weather all the way to Detroit. I dismissed Jack with orders to return at eleven with Soth.  \"Don't be late,\" I warned him.  Jack looked a little uneasy, but he showed up on schedule and delivered Soth to us with rain droplets on his massive bald pate, just ten minutes after the conference convened.  I had Ollie Johnson there, too, to put Soth through his paces. The Ollie, in a bedraggled, soggy suit, was so excited that he remained an almost purplish black for the whole hour.  The directors were charmed, impressed and enthusiastic.  When I finished my personal report on the Soth's tremendous success in my own household, old Gulbrandson, Chairman of the Board, shined his rosy cheeks with his handkerchief and said, \"I'll take the first three you produce, Johnson. Our staff of domestics costs me more than a brace of attorneys, and it turns over about three times a year. Cook can't even set the timer on the egg-cooker right.\" He turned to me. \"Sure he can make good coffee, Collins?\"  I nodded emphatically.  \"Then put me down for three for sure,\" he said with executive finality.  Gulbrandson paid dearly for his piggishness later, but at the time it seemed only natural that if one Soth could run a household efficiently, then the Chairman of the Board should have at least two spares in case one blew a fuse or a vesicle or whatever it was they might blow.         *       *       *       *       *  A small, dignified riot almost broke up the meeting right there, and when they quieted down again I had orders for twenty-six Soths from the board members and one from my own secretary.  \"How soon,\" I asked Ollie Johnson, \"can you begin deliveries?\"  He dry-washed his hands and admitted it would be five months, and a sigh of disappointment ran around the table. Then someone asked him how many units a month they could turn out.  He stared at the carpet and held out his hands like a pawn-broker disparaging a diamond ring: \"Our techniques are so slow. The first month, maybe a hundred. Of course, once our cultures are all producing in harmony, almost any number. One thousand? Ten thousand? Whatever your needs suggest.\"  One of the officers asked, \"Is your process entirely biological? You mentioned cultures.\"  For a moment, I thought Ollie Johnson was going to break out in tears. His face twisted.  \"Abysmally so,\" he grieved. \"Our synthetic models have never proved durable. Upkeep and parts replacements are prohibitive. Our brain units are much similar to your own latest developments in positronics, but we have had to resort to organic cellular structure in order to achieve the mobility which Mr. Collins admired last Friday.\"  The upshot of the meeting was a hearty endorsement over my signature on the Ollies' contract, plus an offer of any help they might need to get production rolling.  As the meeting broke up, they pumped my hand and stared enviously at my Soth. Several offered me large sums for him, up to fifteen thousand dollars, and for the moment I sweated out the rack of owning something my bosses did not. Their understandable resentment, however, was tempered by their recognition of my genius in getting a signed contract before the Ollies went shopping to our competitors.  What none of us understood right then was that the Ollies were hiring us, not the other way around.  When I told Vicki about my hour of triumph and how the officers bid up our Soth, she glowed with the very feminine delight of exclusive possession. She hugged me and gloated, \"Old biddy Gulbrandson--won't she writhe? And don't you dare take _any_ offer for our Soth. He's one of the family now, eh, Soth, old boy?\"  He was serving soup to her as she slapped him on the hip. Somehow he managed to retreat so fast she almost missed him, yet he didn't spill a drop of bouillon from the poised tureen.  \"Yes, Mrs. Collins,\" he said, not a trace more nor less aloof than usual.  \"Oops, sorry!\" Vicki apologized. \"I forgot. The code.\"  I had the feeling that warm-hearted Vicki would have had the Soth down on the bearskin rug in front of the big fireplace, scuffling him like she did Clumsy, if it hadn't been for the Soth's untouchable code--and I was thankful that it existed. Vicki had a way of putting her hand on you when she spoke, or hugging anyone in sight when she was especially delighted.  And I knew something about Soth that she didn't. Something that apparently hadn't bothered her mind since the day of her striptease.         *       *       *       *       *  Summer was gone and it was mid-fall before Ollie paid me another visit. When he showed up again, it was with an invoice for 86 Soths, listed by serial numbers and ready to ship. He had heard about sight drafts and wanted me to help him prepare one.  \"To hell with that noise,\" I told him. I wrote a note to purchasing and countersigned the Ollie's invoice for some $103,000.

Suppose everyone wanted to sit in the sun all day? What would happen? No one would check ships coming from outer space. Bacteria and toxic crystals would enter the system and cause mass death and suffering. Isn't that right?\"  \"If everyone felt the way I do they wouldn't be going into outer space.\"  \"But they have to. They have to trade, they have to get minerals and products and new plants.\"  \"Why?\"  \"To keep society going.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Well--\" Harris gestured. \"People couldn't live without society.\"  Westerburg said nothing to that. Harris watched him, but the youth did not answer.  \"Isn't that right?\" Harris said.  \"Perhaps. It's a peculiar business, Doctor. You know, I struggled for years to get through Training. I had to work and pay my own way. Washed dishes, worked in kitchens. Studied at night, learned, crammed, worked on and on. And you know what I think, now?\"  \"What?\"  \"I wish I'd become a plant earlier.\"  Doctor Harris stood up. \"Westerburg, when you come inside, will you stop off at my office? I want to give you a few tests, if you don't mind.\"  \"The shock box?\" Westerburg smiled. \"I knew that would be coming around. Sure, I don't mind.\"  Nettled, Harris left the rock, walking back up the bank a short distance. \"About three, Corporal?\"  The Corporal nodded.  Harris made his way up the hill, to the path, toward the hospital building. The whole thing was beginning to become more clear to him. A boy who had struggled all his life. Financial insecurity. Idealized goal, getting a Patrol assignment. Finally reached it, found the load too great. And on Asteroid Y-3 there was too much vegetation to look at all day. Primitive identification and projection on the flora of the asteroid. Concept of security involved in immobility and permanence. Unchanging forest.  He entered the building. A robot orderly stopped him almost at once. \"Sir, Commander Cox wants you urgently, on the vidphone.\"  \"Thanks.\" Harris strode to his office. He dialed Cox's letter and the Commander's face came presently into focus. \"Cox? This is Harris. I've been out talking to the boy. I'm beginning to get this lined up, now. I can see the pattern, too much load too long. Finally gets what he wants and the idealization shatters under the--\"  \"Harris!\" Cox barked. \"Shut up and listen. I just got a report from Y-3. They're sending an express rocket here. It's on the way.\"  \"An express rocket?\"  \"Five more cases like Westerburg. All say they're plants! The Garrison Chief is worried as hell. Says we _must_ find out what it is or the Garrison will fall apart, right away. Do you get me, Harris? Find out what it is!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Harris murmured. \"Yes, sir.\"         *       *       *       *       *  By the end of the week there were twenty cases, and all, of course, were from Asteroid Y-3.  Commander Cox and Harris stood together at the top of the hill, looking gloomily down at the stream below. Sixteen men and four women sat in the sun along the bank, none of them moving, none speaking. An hour had gone by since Cox and Harris appeared, and in all that time the twenty people below had not stirred.  \"I don't get it,\" Cox said, shaking his head. \"I just absolutely don't get it. Harris, is this the beginning of the end? Is everything going to start cracking around us? It gives me a hell of a strange feeling to see those people down there, basking away in the sun, just sitting and basking.\"  \"Who's that man there with the red hair?\"  \"That's Ulrich Deutsch. He was Second in Command at the Garrison. Now look at him! Sits and dozes with his mouth open and his eyes shut. A week ago that man was climbing, going right up to the top. When the Garrison Chief retires he was supposed to take over. Maybe another year, at the most. All his life he's been climbing to get up there.\"  \"And now he sits in the sun,\" Harris finished.  \"That woman. The brunette, with the short hair. Career woman. Head of the entire office staff of the Garrison. And the man beside her. Janitor. And that cute little gal there, with the bosom. Secretary, just out of school. All kinds. And I got a note this morning, three more coming in sometime today.\"  Harris nodded. \"The strange thing is--they really _want_ to sit down there. They're completely rational; they could do something else, but they just don't care to.\"  \"Well?\" Cox said. \"What are you going to do? Have you found anything? We're counting on you. Let's hear it.\"  \"I couldn't get anything out of them directly,\" Harris said, \"but I've had some interesting results with the shock box. Let's go inside and I'll show you.\"  \"Fine,\" Cox turned and started toward the hospital. \"Show me anything you've got. This is serious. Now I know how Tiberius felt when Christianity showed up in high places.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Harris snapped off the light. The room was pitch black. \"I'll run this first reel for you. The subject is one of the best biologists stationed at the Garrison. Robert Bradshaw. He came in yesterday. I got a good run from the shock box because Bradshaw's mind is so highly differentiated. There's a lot of repressed material of a non-rational nature, more than usual.\"  He pressed a switch. The projector whirred, and on the far wall a three-dimensional image appeared in color, so real that it might have been the man himself. Robert Bradshaw was a man of fifty, heavy-set, with iron grey hair and a square jaw. He sat in the chair calmly, his hands resting on the arms, oblivious to the electrodes attached to his neck and wrist. \"There I go,\" Harris said. \"Watch.\"  His film-image appeared, approaching Bradshaw. \"Now, Mr. Bradshaw,\" his image said, \"this won't hurt you at all, and it'll help us a lot.\" The image rotated the controls on the shock box. Bradshaw stiffened, and his jaw set, but otherwise he gave no sign. The image of Harris regarded him for a time and then stepped away from the controls.  \"Can you hear me, Mr. Bradshaw?\" the image asked.  \"Yes.\"  \"What is your name?\"  \"Robert C. Bradshaw.\"  \"What is your position?\"  \"Chief Biologist at the check-station on Y-3.\"  \"Are you there now?\"  \"No, I'm back on Terra. In a hospital.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because I admitted to the Garrison Chief that I had become a plant.\"  \"Is that true? That you are a plant.\"  \"Yes, in a non-biological sense. I retain the physiology of a human being, of course.\"  \"What do you mean, then, that you're a plant?\"  \"The reference is to attitudinal response, to Weltanschauung.\"  \"Go on.\"  \"It is possible for a warm-blooded animal, an upper primate, to adopt the psychology of a plant, to some extent.\"  \"Yes?\"  \"I refer to this.\"  \"And the others? They refer to this also?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How did this occur, your adopting this attitude?\"  Bradshaw's image hesitated, the lips twisting. \"See?\" Harris said to Cox. \"Strong conflict. He wouldn't have gone on, if he had been fully conscious.\"  \"I--\"  \"Yes?\"  \"I was taught to become a plant.\"  The image of Harris showed surprise and interest. \"What do you mean, you were _taught_ to become a plant?\"  \"They realized my problems and taught me to become a plant. Now I'm free from them, the problems.\"  \"Who? Who taught you?\"  \"The Pipers.\"  \"Who? The Pipers? Who are the Pipers?\"  There was no answer.  \"Mr. Bradshaw, who are the Pipers?\"  After a long, agonized pause, the heavy lips parted. \"They live in the woods....\"  Harris snapped off the projector, and the lights came on. He and Cox blinked. \"That was all I could get,\" Harris said. \"But I was lucky to get that. He wasn't supposed to tell, not at all. That was the thing they all promised not to do, tell who taught them to become plants. The Pipers who live in the woods, on Asteroid Y-3.\"  \"You got this story from all twenty?\"  \"No.\" Harris grimaced. \"Most of them put up too much fight. I couldn't even get _this_ much from them.\"  Cox reflected. \"The Pipers. Well? What do you propose to do? Just wait around until you can get the full story? Is that your program?\"  \"No,\" Harris said. \"Not at all. I'm going to Y-3 and find out who the Pipers are, myself.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The small patrol ship made its landing with care and precision, its jets choking into final silence. The hatch slid back and Doctor Henry Harris found himself staring out at a field, a brown, sun-baked landing field. At the end of the field was a tall signal tower. Around the field on all sides were long grey buildings, the Garrison check-station itself. Not far off a huge Venusian cruiser was parked, a vast green hulk, like an enormous lime. The technicians from the station were swarming all over it, checking and examining each inch of it for lethal life-forms and poisons that might have attached themselves to the hull.  \"All out, sir,\" the pilot said.  Harris nodded. He took hold of his two suitcases and stepped carefully down. The ground was hot underfoot, and he blinked in the bright sunlight. Jupiter was in the sky, and the vast planet reflected considerable sunlight down onto the asteroid.  Harris started across the field, carrying his suitcases. A field attendant was already busy opening the storage compartment of the patrol ship, extracting his trunk. The attendant lowered the trunk into a waiting dolly and came after him, manipulating the little truck with bored skill.  As Harris came to the entrance of the signal tower the gate slid back and a man came forward, an older man, large and robust, with white hair and a steady walk.  \"How are you, Doctor?\" he said, holding his hand out. \"I'm Lawrence Watts, the Garrison Chief.\"  They shook hands. Watts smiled down at Harris. He was a huge old man, still regal and straight in his dark blue uniform, with his gold epaulets sparkling on his shoulders.  \"Have a good trip?\" Watts asked. \"Come on inside and I'll have a drink fixed for you. It gets hot around here, with the Big Mirror up there.\"  \"Jupiter?\" Harris followed him inside the building. The"]]]
