Wilson, likewise, bent forward eagerly. Beasley glanced at the door--then began to whisper.  “Old Auchincloss is on his last legs. He's goin' to croak. He's sent back to Missouri for a niece--a young girl--an' he means to leave his ranches an' sheep--all his stock to her. Seems he has no one else.... Them ranches--an' all them sheep an' hosses! You know me an' Al were pardners in sheep-raisin' for years. He swore I cheated him an' he threw me out. An' all these years I've been swearin' he did me dirt--owed me sheep an' money. I've got as many friends in Pine--an' all the way down the trail--as Auchincloss has.... An' Snake, see here--”  He paused to draw a deep breath and his big hands trembled over the blaze. Anson leaned forward, like a serpent ready to strike, and Jim Wilson was as tense with his divination of the plot at hand.  “See here,” panted Beasley. “The girl's due to arrive at Magdalena on the sixteenth. That's a week from to-morrow. She'll take the stage to Snowdrop, where some of Auchincloss's men will meet her with a team.”  “A-huh!” grunted Anson as Beasley halted again. “An' what of all thet?”  “She mustn't never get as far as Snowdrop!”  “You want me to hold up the stage--an' get the girl?”  “Exactly.”  “Wal--an' what then?”  “Make off with her.... She disappears. That's your affair. ... I'll press my claims on Auchincloss--hound him--an' be ready when he croaks to take over his property. Then the girl can come back, for all I care.... You an' Wilson fix up the deal between you. If you have to let the gang in on it don't give them any hunch as to who an' what. This 'll make you a rich stake. An' providin', when it's paid, you strike for new territory.”  “Thet might be wise,” muttered Snake Anson. “Beasley, the weak point in your game is the uncertainty of life. Old Al is tough. He may fool you.”  “Auchincloss is a dyin' man,” declared Beasley, with such positiveness that it could not be doubted.  “Wal, he sure wasn't plumb hearty when I last seen him.... Beasley, in case I play your game--how'm I to know that girl?”  “Her name's Helen Rayner,” replied Beasley, eagerly. “She's twenty years old. All of them Auchinclosses was handsome an' they say she's the handsomest.”  “A-huh!... Beasley, this 's sure a bigger deal--an' one I ain't fancyin'.... But I never doubted your word.... Come on--an' talk out. What's in it for me?”  “Don't let any one in on this. You two can hold up the stage. Why, it was never held up.... But you want to mask.... How about ten thousand sheep--or what they bring at Phenix in gold?”  Jim Wilson whistled low.  “An' leave for new territory?” repeated Snake Anson, under his breath.  “You've said it.”  “Wal, I ain't fancyin' the girl end of this deal, but you can count on me.... September sixteenth at Magdalena--an' her name's Helen--an' she's handsome?”  “Yes. My herders will begin drivin' south in about two weeks. Later, if the weather holds good, send me word by one of them an' I'll meet you.”  Beasley spread his hands once more over the blaze, pulled on his gloves and pulled down his sombrero, and with an abrupt word of parting strode out into the night.  “Jim, what do you make of him?” queried Snake Anson.  “Pard, he's got us beat two ways for Sunday,” replied Wilson.  “A-huh!... Wal, let's get back to camp.” And he led the way out.  Low voices drifted into the cabin, then came snorts of horses and striking hoofs, and after that a steady trot, gradually ceasing. Once more the moan of wind and soft patter of rain filled the forest stillness.    CHAPTER II  Milt Dale quietly sat up to gaze, with thoughtful eyes, into the gloom.  He was thirty years old. As a boy of fourteen he had run off from his school and home in Iowa and, joining a wagon-train of pioneers, he was one of the first to see log cabins built on the slopes of the White Mountains. But he had not taken kindly to farming or sheep-raising or monotonous home toil, and for twelve years he had lived in the forest, with only infrequent visits to Pine and Show Down and Snowdrop. This wandering forest life of his did not indicate that he did not care for the villagers, for he did care, and he was welcome everywhere, but that he loved wild life and solitude and beauty with the primitive instinctive force of a savage.  And on this night he had stumbled upon a dark plot against the only one of all the honest white people in that region whom he could not call a friend.  “That man Beasley!” he soliloquized. “Beasley--in cahoots with Snake Anson!... Well, he was right. Al Auchincloss is on his last legs. Poor old man! When I tell him he'll never believe ME, that's sure!”  Discovery of the plot meant to Dale that he must hurry down to Pine.  “A girl--Helen Rayner--twenty years old,” he mused. “Beasley wants her made off with.... That means--worse than killed!”  Dale accepted facts of life with that equanimity and fatality acquired by one long versed in the cruel annals of forest lore. Bad men worked their evil just as savage wolves relayed a deer. He had shot wolves for that trick. With men, good or bad, he had not clashed. Old women and children appealed to him, but he had never had any interest in girls. The image, then, of this Helen Rayner came strangely to Dale; and he suddenly realized that he had meant somehow to circumvent Beasley, not to befriend old Al Auchincloss, but for the sake of the girl. Probably she was already on her way West, alone, eager, hopeful of a future home. How little people guessed what awaited them at a journey's end! Many trails ended abruptly in the forest--and only trained woodsmen could read the tragedy.  “Strange how I cut across country to-day from Spruce Swamp,” reflected Dale. Circumstances, movements, usually were not strange to him. His methods and habits were seldom changed by chance. The matter, then, of his turning off a course out of his way for no apparent reason, and of his having overheard a plot singularly involving a young girl, was indeed an adventure to provoke thought. It provoked more, for Dale grew conscious of an unfamiliar smoldering heat along his veins. He who had little to do with the strife of men, and nothing to do with anger, felt his blood grow hot at the cowardly trap laid for an innocent girl.  “Old Al won't listen to me,” pondered Dale. “An' even if he did, he wouldn't believe me. Maybe nobody will.... All the same, Snake Anson won't get that girl.”  With these last words Dale satisfied himself of his own position, and his pondering ceased. Taking his rifle, he descended from the loft and peered out of the door. The night had grown darker, windier, cooler; broken clouds were scudding across the sky; only a few stars showed; fine rain was blowing from the northwest; and the forest seemed full of a low, dull roar.  “Reckon I'd better hang up here,” he said, and turned to the fire. The coals were red now. From the depths of his hunting-coat he procured a little bag of salt and some strips of dried meat. These strips he laid for a moment on the hot embers, until they began to sizzle and curl; then with a sharpened stick he removed them and ate like a hungry hunter grateful for little.  He sat on a block of wood with his palms spread to the dying warmth of the fire and his eyes fixed upon the changing, glowing, golden embers. Outside, the wind continued to rise and the moan of the forest increased to a roar. Dale felt the comfortable warmth stealing over him, drowsily lulling; and he heard the storm-wind in the trees, now like a waterfall, and anon like a retreating army, and again low and sad; and he saw pictures in the glowing embers, strange as dreams.  Presently he rose and, climbing to the loft, he stretched himself out, and soon fell asleep.   When the gray dawn broke he was on his way, 'cross-country, to the village of Pine.  During the night the wind had shifted and the rain had ceased. A suspicion of frost shone on the grass in open places. All was gray--the parks, the glades--and deeper, darker gray marked the aisles of the forest. Shadows lurked under the trees and the silence seemed consistent with spectral forms. Then the east kindled, the gray lightened, the dreaming woodland awoke to the far-reaching rays of a bursting red sun.  This was always the happiest moment of Dale's lonely days, as sunset was his saddest. He responded, and there was something in his blood that answered the whistle of a stag from a near-by ridge. His strides were long, noiseless, and they left dark trace where his feet brushed the dew-laden grass.  Dale pursued a zigzag course over the ridges to escape the hardest climbing, but the “senacas”--those parklike meadows so named by Mexican sheep-herders--were as round and level as if they had been made by man in beautiful contrast to the dark-green, rough, and rugged ridges. Both open senaca and dense wooded ridge showed to his quick eye an abundance of game. The cracking of twigs and disappearing flash of gray among the spruces, a round black lumbering object, a twittering in the brush, and stealthy steps, were all easy signs for Dale to read. Once, as he noiselessly emerged into a little glade, he espied a red fox stalking some quarry, which, as he advanced, proved to be a flock of partridges. They whirred up, brushing the branches, and the fox trotted away. In every senaca Dale encountered wild turkeys feeding on the seeds of the high grass.  It had always been his custom, on his visits to Pine, to kill and pack fresh meat down to several old friends, who were glad to give him lodging. And, hurried though he was now, he did not intend to make an exception of this trip.  At length he got down into the pine belt, where the great, gnarled, yellow trees soared aloft, stately, and aloof from one another, and the ground was a brown, odorous, springy mat of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3457"],["title","The Man of the Forest (#2)"],["body","e-needles, level as a floor. Squirrels watched him from all around, scurrying away at his near approach--tiny, brown, light-striped squirrels, and larger ones, russet-colored, and the splendid dark-grays with their white bushy tails and plumed ears.  This belt of pine ended abruptly upon wide, gray, rolling, open land, almost like a prairie, with foot-hills lifting near and far, and the red-gold blaze of aspen thickets catching the morning sun. Here Dale flushed a flock of wild turkeys, upward of forty in number, and their subdued color of gray flecked with white, and graceful, sleek build, showed them to be hens. There was not a gobbler in the flock. They began to run pell-mell out into the grass, until only their heads appeared bobbing along, and finally disappeared. Dale caught a glimpse of skulking coyotes that evidently had been stalking the turkeys, and as they saw him and darted into the timber he took a quick shot at the hindmost. His bullet struck low, as he had meant it to, but too low, and the coyote got only a dusting of earth and pine-needles thrown up into his face. This frightened him so that he leaped aside blindly to butt into a tree, rolled over, gained his feet, and then the cover of the forest. Dale was amused at this. His hand was against all the predatory beasts of the forest, though he had learned that lion and bear and wolf and fox were all as necessary to the great scheme of nature as were the gentle, beautiful wild creatures upon which they preyed. But some he loved better than others, and so he deplored the inexplicable cruelty.  He crossed the wide, grassy plain and struck another gradual descent where aspens and pines crowded a shallow ravine and warm, sun-lighted glades bordered along a sparkling brook. Here he heard a turkey gobble, and that was a signal for him to change his course and make a crouching, silent detour around a clump of aspens. In a sunny patch of grass a dozen or more big gobblers stood, all suspiciously facing in his direction, heads erect, with that wild aspect peculiar to their species. Old wild turkey gobblers were the most difficult game to stalk. Dale shot two of them. The others began to run like ostriches, thudding over the ground, spreading their wings, and with that running start launched their heavy bodies into whirring flight. They flew low, at about the height of a man from the grass, and vanished in the woods.  Dale threw the two turkeys over his shoulder and went on his way. Soon he came to a break in the forest level, from which he gazed down a league-long slope of pine and cedar, out upon the bare, glistening desert, stretching away, endlessly rolling out to the dim, dark horizon line.  The little hamlet of Pine lay on the last level of sparsely timbered forest. A road, running parallel with a dark-watered, swift-flowing stream, divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue smoke drifted lazily aloft. Fields of corn and fields of oats, yellow in the sunlight, surrounded the village; and green pastures, dotted with horses and cattle, reached away to the denser woodland. This site appeared to be a natural clearing, for there was no evidence of cut timber. The scene was rather too wild to be pastoral, but it was serene, tranquil, giving the impression of a remote community, prosperous and happy, drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives.  Dale halted before a neat little log cabin and a little patch of garden bordered with sunflowers. His call was answered by an old woman, gray and bent, but remarkably spry, who appeared at the door.  “Why, land's sakes, if it ain't Milt Dale!” she exclaimed, in welcome.  “Reckon it's me, Mrs. Cass,” he replied. “An' I've brought you a turkey.”  “Milt, you're that good boy who never forgits old Widow Cass.... What a gobbler! First one I've seen this fall. My man Tom used to fetch home gobblers like that.... An' mebbe he'll come home again sometime.”  Her husband, Tom Cass, had gone into the forest years before and had never returned. But the old woman always looked for him and never gave up hope.  “Men have been lost in the forest an' yet come back,” replied Dale, as he had said to her many a time.  “Come right in. You air hungry, I know. Now, son, when last did you eat a fresh egg or a flapjack?”  “You should remember,” he answered, laughing, as he followed her into a small, clean kitchen.  “Laws-a'-me! An' thet's months ago,” she replied, shaking her gray head. “Milt, you should give up that wild life--an' marry--an' have a home.”  “You always tell me that.”  “Yes, an' I'll see you do it yet.... Now you set there, an' pretty soon I'll give you thet to eat which 'll make your mouth water.”  “What's the news, Auntie?” he asked.  “Nary news in this dead place. Why, nobody's been to Snowdrop in two weeks!... Sary Jones died, poor old soul--she's better off--an' one of my cows run away. Milt, she's wild when she gits loose in the woods. An' you'll have to track her, 'cause nobody else can. An' John Dakker's heifer was killed by a lion, an' Lem Harden's fast hoss--you know his favorite--was stole by hoss-thieves. Lem is jest crazy. An' that reminds me, Milt, where's your big ranger, thet you'd never sell or lend?”  “My horses are up in the woods, Auntie; safe, I reckon, from horse-thieves.”  “Well, that's a blessin'. We've had some stock stole this summer, Milt, an' no mistake.”  Thus, while preparing a meal for Dale, the old woman went on recounting all that had happened in the little village since his last visit. Dale enjoyed her gossip and quaint philosophy, and it was exceedingly good to sit at her table. In his opinion, nowhere else could there have been such butter and cream, such ham and eggs. Besides, she always had apple pie, it seemed, at any time he happened in; and apple pie was one of Dale's few regrets while up in the lonely forest.  “How's old Al Auchincloss?” presently inquired Dale.  “Poorly--poorly,” sighed Mrs. Cass. “But he tramps an' rides around same as ever. Al's not long for this world.... An', Milt, that reminds me--there's the biggest news you ever heard.”  “You don't say so!” exclaimed Dale, to encourage the excited old woman.  “Al has sent back to Saint Joe for his niece, Helen Rayner. She's to inherit all his property. We've heard much of her--a purty lass, they say.... Now, Milt Dale, here's your chance. Stay out of the woods an' go to work.... You can marry that girl!”  “No chance for me, Auntie,” replied Dale, smiling.  The old woman snorted. “Much you know! Any girl would have you, Milt Dale, if you'd only throw a kerchief.”  “Me!... An' why, Auntie?” he queried, half amused, half thoughtful. When he got back to civilization he always had to adjust his thoughts to the ideas of people.  “Why? I declare, Milt, you live so in the woods you're like a boy of ten--an' then sometimes as old as the hills.... There's no young man to compare with you, hereabouts. An' this girl--she'll have all the spunk of the Auchinclosses.”  “Then maybe she'd not be such a catch, after all,” replied Dale.  “Wal, you've no cause to love them, that's sure. But, Milt, the Auchincloss women are always good wives.”  “Dear Auntie, you're dreamin',” said Dale, soberly. “I want no wife. I'm happy in the woods.”  “Air you goin' to live like an Injun all your days, Milt Dale?” she queried, sharply.  “I hope so.”  “You ought to be ashamed. But some lass will change you, boy, an' mebbe it'll be this Helen Rayner. I hope an' pray so to thet.”  “Auntie, supposin' she did change me. She'd never change old Al. He hates me, you know.”  “Wal, I ain't so sure, Milt. I met Al the other day. He inquired for you, an' said you was wild, but he reckoned men like you was good for pioneer settlements. Lord knows the good turns you've done this village! Milt, old Al doesn't approve of your wild life, but he never had no hard feelin's till thet tame lion of yours killed so many of his sheep.”  “Auntie, I don't believe Tom ever killed Al's sheep,” declared Dale, positively.  “Wal, Al thinks so, an' many other people,” replied Mrs. Cass, shaking her gray head doubtfully. “You never swore he didn't. An' there was them two sheep-herders who did swear they seen him.”  “They only saw a cougar. An' they were so scared they ran.”  “Who wouldn't? Thet big beast is enough to scare any one. For land's sakes, don't ever fetch him down here again! I'll never forgit the time you did. All the folks an' children an' hosses in Pine broke an' run thet day.”  “Yes; but Tom wasn't to blame. Auntie, he's the tamest of my pets. Didn't he try to put his head on your lap an' lick your hand?”  “Wal, Milt, I ain't gainsayin' your cougar pet didn't act better 'n a lot of people I know. Fer he did. But the looks of him an' what's been said was enough for me.”  “An' what's all that, Auntie?”  “They say he's wild when out of your sight. An' thet he'd trail an' kill anythin' you put him after.”  “I trained him to be just that way.”  “Wal, leave Tom to home up in the woods--when you visit us.”  Dale finished his hearty meal, and listened awhile longer to the old woman's talk; then, taking his rifle and the other turkey, he bade her good-by. She followed him out.  “Now, Milt, you'll come soon again, won't you--jest to see Al's niece--who'll be here in a week?”  “I reckon I'll drop in some day.... Auntie, have you seen my friends, the Mormon boys?”  “No, I 'ain't seen them an' don't want to,” she retorted. “Milt Dale, if any one ever corrals you it'll be Mormons.”  “Don't worry, Auntie. I like those boys. They often see me up in the woods an' ask me to help them track a hoss or help kill some fresh meat.”  “They're workin' for Beasley now.”  “Is that so?” rejoined Dale, with a sudden start. “An' what doin'?”  “Beasley is gettin' so rich he's buildin' a fence, an' didn't have enough help, so I hear.”  “Beasley gettin' rich!” repeated Dale, thoughtfully. “More sheep an' horses an' cattle than ever, I reckon?”  “Laws-a'-me! Why, Milt, Beasley 'ain"]]]
