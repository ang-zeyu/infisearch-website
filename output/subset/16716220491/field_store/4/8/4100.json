For being held down, being made neurotic by frustration and the impossibility of being the \"equal\" of men, because they were fundamentally psychologically and physiologically different, women had taken to space with an age-old vengeance. Personal ego salvation.  But they hadn't stopped there. What had they done? What about the men? A man for every woman, yet no men from Earth. That much Bowren knew. Native Martians? What?  He had been transported somewhere in a car of some kind. He didn't bother to be interested. He couldn't get away. He was held fast. He refused to open his eyes because he didn't want to see the men who held him, the men who had replaced him and every other man on Earth. The men who were destroying the civilization of Earth.  The gimmicks whereby the women had rejected Earth and left it to wither and die in neglect and bitter, bitter wonderment.  He was tired, very tired. The movement of the car lulled him, and he drifted into sleep.  He opened his eyes and slowly looked around. Pretty pastel ceiling. A big room, beautiful and softly furnished, with a marked absence of metal, of shiny chrome, of harshness or brittle angles. It was something of an office, too, with a desk that was not at all business-like, but still a desk. A warm glow suffused the room, and the air was pleasantly scented with natural smelling perfumes.  A woman stood in the middle of the room studying him with detached interest. She was beautiful, but in a hard, mature, withdrawn way. She was dark, her eyes large, liquid black and dominating her rather small sharply-sculptured face. Her mouth was large, deeply red. She had a strong mouth.  He looked at her a while. He felt only a deep, bitter resentment. He felt good though, physically. He had probably been given something, an injection. He sat up. Then he got to his feet.  She kept on studying him. \"A change of clothes, dry detergent, and hair remover for your face are in there, through that door,\" she said.  He said: \"Right now I'd rather talk.\"  \"But don't you want to take off that awful--beard?\"  \"The devil with it! Is that so important? It's natural isn't it for a man to have hair on his face? I like hair on my face.\"  She opened her mouth a little and stepped back a few steps.  \"And anyway, what could be less important right now than the way I look?\"  \"I'm--I'm Gloria Munsel,\" she said hesitantly. \"I'm President of the City here. And what is your name, please?\"  \"Eddie Bowren. What are you going to do with me?\"  She shrugged. \"You act like a mad man. I'd almost forgotten what you men of Earth were like. I was pretty young then. Well, frankly, I don't know what we're going to do with you. No precedent for the situation. No laws concerning it. It'll be up to the Council.\"  \"It won't be pleasant for me,\" he said, \"I can be safe in assuming that.\"  She shrugged again and crossed her arms. He managed to control his emotions somehow as he looked at the smooth lines of her body under the long clinging gown. She was so damn beautiful! A high proud body in a smooth pink gown, dark hair streaming back and shiny and soft.         *       *       *       *       *  It was torture. It had been for a long time, for him, for all the others. \"Let me out of here!\" he yelled harshly. \"Put me in a room by myself!\"  She moved closer to him and looked into his face. The fragrance of her hair, the warmth of her reached out to him. Somehow, he never knew how, he managed to grin. He felt the sweat running down his dirty, bearded, battered face. His suit was torn and dirty. He could smell himself, the stale sweat, the filth. He could feel his hair, shaggy and long, down his neck, over his ears.  Her lips were slightly parted, and wet, and she had a funny dark look in her eyes, he thought. She turned quickly as the door opened, and a man came in. He was only slightly taller than Gloria and he nodded, smiled brightly, bowed a little, moved forward. He carried a big bouquet of flowers and presented them to her.  She took the flowers, smiled, thanked him, and put them on the table. The man said. \"So sorry, darling, to intrude. But I felt I had to see you for a few minutes. I left the children with John, and dashed right up here. I thought we might have lunch together.\"  \"You're so thoughtful, dear,\" she said.  The man turned a distasteful look upon Bowren. He said. \"My dear, what is _this_?\"  \"A man,\" she said, and then added. \"From Earth.\"  \"What? Good grief, you mean they've found a way--?\"  \"I don't know. You'd better go back home and tend the yard today, Dale. I'll tell you all about it when I come home this evening. All right?\"  \"Well I--oh, oh yes, of course, if you say so, darling.\"  \"Thank you, dear.\" She kissed him and he bowed out.  She turned and walked back toward Bowren. \"Tell me,\" she said. \"How did you get here alive?\"  Why not tell her? He was helpless here. They'd find out anyway, as soon as they got back to Earth on the cargo run. And even if they didn't find out, that wouldn't matter either. They would be on guard from now on. No man would do again what Bowren had done. The only chance would be to build secret spaceships of their own and every time one blasted, have every member of the crew go through what Bowren had. It couldn't last. Too much injury and shock.  As he talked he studied the office, and he thought of other things. An office that was like a big beautiful living room. A thoroughly feminine office. Nor was it the type of office a woman would fix for a man. It was a woman's office. Everything, the whole culture here, was feminine. When he had finished she said, \"Interesting. It must have been a very unpleasant experience for you.\"  He grinned. \"I suffered. But even though I've failed, it's worth all the suffering, if you'll tell me--where did all the ah--men come from?\"  She told him. It was, to say the least, startling, and then upon reflection, he realized how simple it all was. No aliens. No native Martians. A very simple and thoroughly logical solution, and in a way, typically feminine.  Hormone treatment and genetic manipulation, plus a thorough reconditioning while the treatment was taking place.  _And the women had simply turned approximately half of their number into men!_  She paused, then went on. \"It was the only way we could see it, Mr. Bowren. Earth was a man's world, and we could never have belonged in it, not the way we wanted to. Men wouldn't stand it anyway, down there, having us going into space, usurping their masculine role. And anyway--you men of Earth had become so utterly unsatisfactory as companions, lovers, and husbands, that it was obvious nothing could ever be done about it. Not unless we set up our own culture, our own civilization, our way.\"  \"But meanwhile we die down there,\" Bowren said. \"Logic is nice. But mass murder, and the death of a whole world civilization seems pretty cold from where I'm standing. It's pathological, but it's too late to think about that. It's done now.\"  \"But we're happy here,\" she said. \"For the first time in a long, long time, we women feel like ourselves. We feel truly independent. The men around us are the kind of men we want, instead of us being what they want us to be, or even worse, the men being what we want them to be but resenting it and making life unbearable for both. All through the process of being changed into men, our women undergo such a thorough conditioning that they can never be anything else but model men in every sense. Their attitude as women with which they started treatment helped. They knew what they wanted in men, and they became what we wanted them to be, as men.\"  \"Very logical,\" Bowren said. \"It smells to heaven it's so logical.\" It was purely impulse, what he did then. He couldn't help it. It wasn't logical either. It was emotional and he did it because he had to do it and because he didn't see any reason why he shouldn't.  He put his arm out suddenly, hooked her slim waist, and pulled her to him. Her face flushed and his eyes were very wide and dark as she looked up at him.  \"Listen,\" he said. \"The whole thing's insane. The lot of you are mad, and though I can't help it, I hate to see it happen this way. What kind of men are these? These smiling robots, these goons who are nothing else but reflections in a woman's mirror? Who'd want to be a man like that. Who would really want a man like that? And who would want a woman who was just what a man wanted her to be? Where's the fire? Where's the individuality? Where's the conflict, the fighting and snarling and raging that makes living. All this is apathy, this is death! You don't grow by being agreeable, but by conflict.\"  \"What are you trying to sell now?\" she whispered.  He laughed. It was wild sounding to him, not very humorous really, but still it was laughter. \"Selling nothing, buying nothing.\" He pulled her closer and kissed her. Her lips parted slightly and he could feel the warmth of her and the quick drawing of breath. Then she pushed him away. She raised her hand and brushed it over his face.  She shook her head slowly. \"It feels rather interesting,\" she said, \"your face. I've never felt a man's face before, that wasn't smooth, the way it should be.\"  He laughed again, more softly this time. \"Why reform your men? You women always wanted to do that.\"  \"We don't reform men here,\" she said. \"We start them out right--from the beginning.\"  She backed away from him. She raised her hand to her face and her fingers touched her lips. Wrinkles appeared between her eyes and she shook her head again. Not at him, but at something, a thought perhaps, he couldn't tell.  Finally she said. \"That was an inexcusable, boorish thing to do. A typical thoughtless egomanical Earth-male action if there ever was one. Our men are all perfect here, and in comparison to them, you're a pretty miserable specimen. I'm glad you showed up here.

Though the idea that courts were entitled to pronounce on the constitutionality of legislative acts had received countenance in a few dicta in some of the States and perhaps in one or two decisions, this idea was still at best in 1787 but the germ of a possible institution. It is not surprising, therefore, that no such doctrine found place in the resolutions of the Virginia plan which came before the Convention. By the sixth resolution of this plan the national legislature was to have the power of negativing all state laws which, in its opinion, contravened \"the Articles of Union, or any treaty subsisting under the authority of the Union,\" and by the eighth resolution \"a convenient number of the national judiciary\" were to be associated with the Executive, \"with authority to examine every act of the national legislature before it shall operate, and every act of a particular legislature before a negative thereon shall be final\" and to impose a qualified veto in either case.  But, as discussion in the Convention proceeded, three principles obtained clearer and clearer recognition, if not from all its members, certainly from the great majority of them: first, that the Constitution is law, in the sense of being enforcible by courts; secondly, that it is supreme law, with which ordinary legislation must be in harmony to be valid; and thirdly--a principle deducible from the doctrine of the separation of powers--that, while the function of making new law belongs to the legislative branch of the Government, that of expounding the standing law, of which the Constitution would be part and parcel, belongs to the Judiciary. The final disposition of the question of insuring the conformity of ordinary legislation to the Constitution turned to no small extent on the recognition of these three great principles.  The proposal to endow Congress with the power to negative state legislation having been rejected by the Convention, Luther Martin of Maryland moved that \"the legislative acts of the United States made in virtue and in pursuance of the Articles of Union, and all treaties made or ratified under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the respective States, and the judiciaries of the several States shall be bound thereby in their decisions, anything in the respective laws of the individual States to the contrary notwithstanding.\" The motion was agreed to without a dissenting voice and, with some slight changes, became Article VIII of the report of the Committee of Detail of the 7th of August, which in turn became \"the linch-pin of the Constitution.\" ¹ Then, on the 27th of August, it was agreed that \"the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court\" should \"extend to all cases arising under the laws passed by the Legislature of the United States,\" whether, that is, such laws should be in pursuance of the Constitution or not. The foundation was thus laid for the Supreme Court to claim the right to review any state decision challenging on constitutional grounds the validity of any act of Congress. Presently this foundation was broadened by the substitution of the phrase \"judicial power of the United States\" for the phrase \"jurisdiction of the Supreme Court,\" and also by the insertion of the words \"this Constitution\" and \"the\" before the word \"laws\" in what ultimately became Article III of the Constitution. The implications of the phraseology of this part of the Constitution are therefore significant:  ¹ Article VI, paragraph 2.  Section I. The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the Supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.  Section II. 1. The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more States, between a State and citizens of another State, between citizens of different States, between citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants of different States, and between a State, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects.  Such, then, is the verbal basis of the power of the courts, and particularly of the Supreme Court, to review the legislation of any State, with reference to the Constitution, to acts of Congress, or to treaties of the United States. Nor can there be much doubt that the members of the Convention were also substantially agreed that the Supreme Court was endowed with the further right to pass upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress. The available evidence strictly contemporaneous with the framing and ratification of the Constitution shows us seventeen of the fifty-five members of the Convention asserting the existence of this prerogative in unmistakable terms and only three using language that can be construed to the contrary. More striking than that, however, is the fact that these seventeen names include fully three-fourths of the leaders of the Convention, four of the five members of the Committee of Detail which drafted the Constitution, and four of the five members of the Committee of Style which gave the Constitution its final form. And these were precisely the members who expressed themselves on all the interesting and vital subjects before the Convention, because they were its statesmen and articulate members. ¹  ¹ The entries under the names of these members in the Index to Max Farrand's Records of the Federal Convention occupy fully thirty columns, as compared with fewer than half as many columns under the names of all remaining members.  No part of the Constitution has realized the hopes of its framers more brilliantly than has Article III, where the judicial power of the United States is defined and organized, and no part has shown itself to be more adaptable to the developing needs of a growing nation. Nor is the reason obscure: no part came from the hands of the framers in more fragmentary shape or left more to the discretion of Congress and the Court.  Congress is thus placed under constitutional obligation to establish one Supreme Court, but the size of that Court is for Congress itself to determine, as well as whether there shall be any inferior Federal Courts at all. What, it may be asked, is the significance of the word \"shall\" in Section II? Is it merely permissive or is it mandatory? And, in either event, when does a case arise under the Constitution or the laws of the United States? Here, too, are questions which are left for Congress in the first instance and for the Supreme Court in the last. Further, the Supreme Court is given \"original jurisdiction\" in certain specified cases and \"appellate jurisdiction\" in all others--subject, however, to \"such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.\" Finally, the whole question of the relation of the national courts to the state judiciaries, though it is elaborately discussed by Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist, is left by the Constitution itself to the practically undirected wisdom of Congress, in the exercise of its power to pass \"all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" ¹ its own powers and those of the other departments of the Government.  ¹ Article I, section VIII, 18.  Almost the first official act of the Senate of the United States, after it had perfected its own organization, was the appointment of a committee \"to bring in a bill for organizing the judiciary of the United States.\" This committee consisted of eight members, five of whom, including Oliver Ellsworth, its chairman, had been members of the Federal Convention. To Ellsworth is to be credited largely the authorship of the great Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, the essential features of which still remain after 130 years in full force and effect.  This famous measure created a chief justiceship and five associate justiceships for the Supreme Court; fifteen District Courts, one for each State of the Union and for each of the two Territories, Kentucky and Ohio; and, to stand between these, three Circuit Courts consisting of two Supreme Court justices and the local district judge. The \"cases\" and \"controversies\" comprehended by the Act fall into three groups: first, those brought to enforce the national laws and treaties, original jurisdiction of which was assigned to the District Courts; secondly, controversies between citizens of different States ¹; lastly, cases brought originally under a state law and in a State Court but finally coming to involve some claim of right based on the National Constitution, laws, or treaties. For these the twenty-fifth section of the Act provided that, where the decision of the highest State Court competent under the state law to pass upon the case was adverse to the claim thus set up, an appeal on the issue should lie to the Supreme Court. This twenty-fifth section received the hearty approval of the champions of State Rights, though later on it came to be to them an object of fiercest resentment. In the Senate, as in the Convention, the artillery of these gentlemen was trained upon the proposed inferior Federal Judiciary, which they pictured as a sort of Gargantua ready at any moment \"to swallow up the state courts.\"  ¹ Where the national jurisdiction was extended to these in the interest of providing an impartial tribunal, it was given to the Circuit Courts.  The first nominations for the Supreme Court were sent in by Washington two days"]]]
