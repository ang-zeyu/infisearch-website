As finally constituted, the original bench consisted of John Jay of New York as Chief Justice, and of John Rutledge of South Carolina, William Cushing of Massachusetts, John Blair of Virginia, James Wilson of Pennsylvania, and James Iredell of North Carolina as Associate Justices. All were known to be champions of the Constitution, three had been members of the Federal Convention, four had held high judicial offices in their home States, and all but Jay were on record as advocates of the principle of judicial review. Jay was one of the authors of the Federalist, had achieved a great diplomatic reputation in the negotiations of 1782, and possessed the political backing of the powerful Livingston family of New York.  The Judiciary Act provided for two terms of court annually, one commencing the first Monday of February, and the other on the first Monday of August. On February 2, 1790, the Court opened its doors for the first time in an upper room of the Exchange in New York City. Up to the February term of 1793 it had heard but five cases, and until the accession of Marshall it had decided but fifty-five. The justices were largely occupied in what one of them described as their \"post-boy duties,\" that is, in riding their circuits. At first the justices rode in pairs and were assigned to particular circuits. As a result of this practice, the Southern justices were forced each year to make two trips of nearly two thousand miles each and, in order to hold court for two weeks, often passed two months on the road. In 1792, however, Congress changed the law to permit the different circuits to be taken in turn and by single justices, and in the meantime the Court had, in 1791, followed the rest of the Government to Philadelphia, a rather more central seat. Then, in 1802, the abolition of the August term eased the burdens of the justices still more. But of course they still had to put up with bad roads, bad inns, and bad judicial quarters or sometimes none at all.  Yet that the life of a Supreme Court justice was not altogether one of discomfort is shown by the following alluring account of the travels of Justice Cushing on circuit: \"He traveled over the whole of the Union, holding courts in Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. His traveling equipage was a four-wheeled phaeton, drawn by a pair of horses, which he drove. It was remarkable for its many ingenious arrangements (all of his contrivance) for carrying books, choice groceries, and other comforts. Mrs. Cushing always accompanied him, and generally read aloud while riding. His faithful servant Prince, a jet-black negro, whose parents had been slaves in the family and who loved his master with unbounded affection, followed.\" ¹ Compared with that of a modern judge always confronted with a docket of eight or nine hundred cases in arrears, Justice Cushing's lot was perhaps not so unenviable.  ¹ Flanders, The Lives and Times of the Chief-Justices of the Supreme Court, vol. II, p. 38.  The pioneer work of the Supreme Court in constitutional interpretation has, for all but special students, fallen into something like obscurity owing to the luster of Marshall's achievements and to his habit of deciding cases without much reference to precedent. But these early labors are by no means insignificant, especially since they pointed the way to some of Marshall's most striking decisions. In Chisholm vs. Georgia, ¹ which was decided in 1793, the Court ruled, in the face of an assurance in the Federalist to the contrary, that an individual might sue a State; and though this decision was speedily disallowed by resentful debtor States by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, its underlying premise that, \"as to the purposes of the Union, the States are not sovereign\" remained untouched; and three years later the Court affirmed the supremacy of national treaties over conflicting state laws and so established a precedent which has never been disturbed. ² Meantime the Supreme Court was advancing, though with notable caution, toward an assertion of the right to pass upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress. Thus in 1792, Congress ordered the judges while on circuit to pass upon pension claims, their determinations to be reviewable by the Secretary of the Treasury. In protests which they filed with the President, the judges stated the dilemma which confronted them: either the new duty was a judicial one or it was not; if the latter, they could not perform it, at least not in their capacity as judges; if the former, then their decisions were not properly reviewable by an executive officer. Washington promptly sent the protests to Congress, whereupon some extremists raised the cry of impeachment; but the majority hastened to amend the Act so as to meet the views of the judges. ³ Four years later, in the Carriage Tax case, 4 the only question argued before the Court was that of the validity of a congressional excise. Yet as late as 1800 we find Justice Samuel Chase of Maryland, who had succeeded Blair in 1795, expressing skepticism as to the right of the Court to disallow acts of Congress on the ground of their unconstitutionality, though at the same time admitting that the prevailing opinion among bench and bar supported the claim.  ¹ 2 Dallas, 419. ² Ware vs. Hylton, 3 ib., 199. ³ See 2 Dallas, 409. 4 Hylton vs. United States, 3 Dallas, 171.  The great lack of the Federal Judiciary during these early years, and it eventually proved well-nigh fatal, was one of leadership. Jay was a satisfactory magistrate, but he was not a great force on the Supreme Bench, partly on account of his peculiarities of temperament and his ill health, and partly because, even before he resigned in 1795 to run for Governor in New York, his judicial career had been cut short by an important diplomatic assignment to England. His successor, Oliver Ellsworth, also suffered from ill health, and he too was finally sacrificed on the diplomatic altar by being sent to France in 1799. During the same interval there were also several resignations among the associate justices. So, what with its shifting personnel, the lack of business, and the brief semiannual terms, the Court secured only a feeble hold on the imagination of the country. It may be thought, no doubt, that judges anxious to steer clear of politics did not require leadership in the political sense. But the truth of the matter is that willy-nilly the Federal Judiciary at this period was bound to enter politics, and the only question was with what degree of tact and prudence this should be done. It was to be to the glory of Marshall that he recognized this fact perfectly and with mingled boldness and caution grasped the leadership which the circumstances demanded.  The situation at the beginning was precarious enough. While the Constitution was yet far from having commended itself to the back country democracy, that is, to the bulk of the American people, the normal duties of the lower Federal Courts brought the judges into daily contact with prevalent prejudices and misconceptions in their most aggravated forms. Between 1790 and 1800 there were two serious uprisings against the new Government: the Whisky Rebellion of 1794 and Fries's Rebellion five years later. During the same period the popular ferment caused by the French Revolution was at its height. Entrusted with the execution of the laws, the young Judiciary \"was necessarily thrust forward to bear the brunt in the first instance of all the opposition levied against the federal head,\" its revenue measures, its commercial restrictions, its efforts to enforce neutrality and to quell uprisings. In short, it was the point of attrition between the new system and a suspicious, excited populace.  Then, to make bad matters worse, Congress in 1798 passed the Sedition Act. Had political discretion instead of party venom governed the judges, it is not unlikely that they would have seized the opportunity presented by this measure to declare it void and by doing so would have made good their censorship of acts of Congress with the approval of even the Jeffersonian opposition. Instead, they enforced the Sedition Act, often with gratuitous rigor, while some of them even entertained prosecutions under a supposed Common Law of the United States. The immediate sequel to their action was the claim put forth in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions that the final authority in interpreting the National Constitution lay with the local legislatures. Before the principle of judicial review was supported by a single authoritative decision, it had thus become a partisan issue! ¹  ¹ See Herman V. Ames, State Documents on Federal Relations, Nos. 7-15.  A few months later Jefferson was elected President, and the Federalists, seeing themselves about to lose control of the Executive and Congress, proceeded to take steps to convert the Judiciary into an avowedly partisan stronghold. By the Act of February 13, 1801, the number of associate justiceships was reduced to four, in the hope that the new Administration might in this way be excluded from the opportunity of making any appointments to the Supreme Bench, the number of district judgeships was enlarged by five, and six Circuit Courts were created which furnished places for sixteen more new judges. When John Adams, the retiring President, proceeded with the aid of the Federalist majority in the Senate and of his Secretary of State, John Marshall, to fill up the new posts with the so-called \"midnight judges,\" ¹ the rage and consternation of the Republican leaders broke all bounds. The Federal Judiciary, declared John Randolph, had become \"an hospital of decayed politicians.\" Others pictured the country as reduced, under the weight of \"supernumerary judges\" and hosts of attendant lawyers, to the condition of Egypt under the Mamelukes. Jefferson's concern went deeper. \"They have retired into the judiciary as a stronghold,\" he wrote Dickinson. \"The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32934"],["title","The Young Colonists: A Story of the Zulu and Boer Wars (#1)"],["body","force of the wind, was covered with a white mantle.  On arriving at the bottom of a steep hill, they stopped again.  \"Do you know where we are, Tom?\"  \"Not in the least,\" Tom answered.  \"This ought to be the last valley,\" Dick said, \"and after one more climb we ought to go straight down into Castleton.  Don't you remember in that valley there were a lot of sheep in a fold, with a wall round it?  If we can find that, we shall know that we are right.  It is near the bottom, so we shall not miss it.  Which way shall we turn, left or right?\"  \"Let us try the left first,\" Tom said.  They walked for half a mile, gradually ascending.  \"It is not this way,\" Tom said at last.  \"We are getting to the head of the valley.  What are you doing, James?\" as the young boy, who had been sobbing for some time, threw himself on the snow.  \"I cannot go any farther,\" he murmured.  \"I am so cold, and so tired, and so sleepy.\"  \"Oh, nonsense!\"  Dick said.  \"Here, take hold of his arm, Tom, and lift him up; give him a good shake; he must go on; he would die if he stopped here.\"  The two lads raised the younger boy, and half-supporting half-dragging him turned and retraced their footsteps.  It was pitch dark now, and they could not see a yard before them.  For some time they continued their way.  \"There is no shepherd's hut.  Certainly, this is not the valley.  What on earth are we to do?\"  \"I don't know,\" Tom said, beginning to cry.  \"Shut up, Tom Jackson.  What are you thinking about?  This is no time for howling like a baby; you have got to think of what is best to do. It is no use climbing the next hill, for we might be going away from home, instead of getting nearer.  Besides, we should have to haul Jimmy up, for he can scarcely stand now; and, although it is bitterly cold here, it would be worse on the top of the hill.  No, we have got to step here all night, that is clear.\"  \"We shall be dead before morning!\"  Tom roared.  \"I will hit you in the eye, Tom Jackson, if you don't shut up; you are as bad as a girl; I am ashamed of you.  Now, what we have got to do, is to find some sort of shelter, either a wall or bush, and we must keep on until we come to something.  Keep awake, Jimmy; we shan't have much farther to go, and then you can lie down quietly.\"  They went on for a bit.  \"It is no use,\" Dick said.  \"They don't put walls across bottoms; more likely to find one either to the right or left.  Now, Tom, you stop here for a minute or two, and I will look about; you keep shouting every minute, so that I can find my way back to you.\"  Turning off, he began to ascend the next hill, and in two or three minutes shouted the glad news to Tom that he had found the wall; then he returned.  Jimmy, cheered at the prospect of lying down, made an effort, and they soon reached the wall.  Like most of the walls in Derbyshire, it was formed of flat stones laid without mortar, some four feet high.  \"Now, Tom, set to work; get some stones off the wall on both sides, and build up two other walls against this; three feet wide inside will do, and just long enough to lie in.  Here, Jimmy, you help; it will keep you awake, and, you see, the higher we make the walls the snugger it will be; we will have quite a nice house.\"  The boys all set to work, and in half an hour three walls were built. At the point where the two side walls touched the other, they were three feet high, and sloped down to two at the lower end.  \"Now, Jimmy, you chuck the snow out.  Tom and I will go, one each way, along the wall; likely enough we may come upon some bushes--they often grow in shelter of the walls: if we can find a few sticks we will cover the house over.  Lots of these stones are a couple of feet long, and we will manage a sort of roof.  The snow will soon cover it, and we shall be as warm as possible.\"  A quarter of an hour later the two boys returned; both had been successful and brought a bundle of sticks; these were laid across the top, interspersed with smaller twigs, the ends being kept down with stones to prevent their being blown away.  The last were placed in position after the boys had crept inside.  They did not attempt to roof it with stones, for the supply of sticks and brushwood was large enough to catch the snow-flakes as they fell, and these would soon form a covering, while it would have been difficult to balance the stones.  Jimmy was by this time in a state almost of lethargy; but the others were fairly warm from their exertions.  They now lay down close beside the younger boy, one on each side.  At first they felt the cold extremely.  \"Let us keep awake as long as we can,\" Dick said.  \"I don't feel inclined to sleep at all,\" Tom answered; \"my hands and feet feel frozen, but I am warm enough everywhere else, and the ground is precious hard and bumpy.\"  \"I am only afraid about Jimmy,\" Dick said; \"he is sound asleep, and he was so awfully cold; lie as close as you can to him, Tom, and put your arm over him and keep your legs huddled up against his.\"  \"It feels warmer than it did,\" he went on, after a pause of half an hour; \"don't you think so, Tom?\"  \"A lot warmer,\" Tom said.  \"I expect the snow has made a good thick roof.\"  \"Yes, and the wind does not blow through the stones as it did.  I expect the snow is drifting up all round; it was getting very deep against the wall when we got in, and if it goes on all night, Tom, I should not wonder if we are covered deep before morning.  The wind always sweeps it off the hills, and makes deep drifts in the bottoms.\"  \"What shall we do, then?\"  \"I don't know,\" Dick answered; \"but there will be plenty of time to think of that in the morning.  I think Jimmy is all right, Tom; I have just put my hand inside his waistcoat and he feels quite warm now.  Say your prayers, and then let us try to get off to sleep.\"  This they were not very long in doing, for the air in the little hut was soon heated by the action of their bodies.  Outside the storm was still raging, and the wind, laden with swirling snow from the uplands, was piling it high in the valleys.  Already the hut was covered and the wall behind it.  All night and all next day the snow continued to fall; the next day, and the next, it kept on.  Old folks down in Castleton said they never remembered such a storm.  It lay three feet deep in the fields, and there was no saying how deep the drifts might be in the hollows.  For the first two days the wind had tried its best to keep the hills clear, but it had tired of the work, and for the last two had ceased to blow, and the great feathered flakes formed steadily and silently.  Tom was the first to wake.  \"Holloa!\" he exclaimed, \"where are we?  Oh!  I remember.  Dick, are you awake?\"  \"Yes, I am awake now,\" Dick said.  \"What is it?  It is not morning yet. I seem to have been asleep a long time, and don't my bones just ache? Jimmy, old boy, are you all right?\"  \"Yes,\" Jimmy grunted.  \"It is quite warm,\" Dick said.  \"It feels very close, and how still it is!  The wind has quite gone down.  Do you know, Tom, I think it must be morning.  There seems a faint sort of light.  I can see the stones in the wall behind you.\"  \"So it must,\" Tom assented.  \"Oh! how stifling it is!\" and he raised himself into a sitting position.  \"I am afraid we are buried deep in the snow-drift.  Put your hand up, Tom; don't you feel some of these sticks are bent in the middle?\"  \"Ever so much; there must be a great weight on them.  What are we to do, Dick; shall we try and dig a way out?\"  \"That will be no good,\" Dick answered; \"not if it is deep; and if it has been snowing all night, there is no saying how deep it may be this morning down in this bottom.  This drift-snow is like dust.  I remember last winter that Bill Jones and Harry Austin and I tried to make a tunnel in a deep drift, but the snow fell in as fast as we scraped it away.  It was just like dry sand.\"  \"We are all right for warmth,\" Tom said; \"but it feels quite stifling.\"  \"Yes, we must try and get some air,\" Dick said.  \"The roof-sticks are close together down at our feet.  There were three or four left over when we had finished, so we can take them away without weakening the roof.  We might shove one of them up through the snow.\"  The sticks were removed carefully, but a quantity of fine snow fell in on their feet.  One was then shoved up through the top, but the only effect, when it was removed, was that it was followed by some snow powdering down on their faces.  \"Let us tie four of them together,\" Dick said.  \"I have plenty of string in my pocket.\"  This was done, fresh sticks being tied to the bottom as the first were shoved up through the snow.  \"Now, Tom, help me to work it about a bit, so as to press the snow all round, and make a sort of tube.\"  For some time a shower of little particles fell as they worked, but gradually these ceased.  Then the stick was cautiously lowered, being untied joint by joint, and looking up the boys gave a shout of pleasure. At the top of the hole, which was some six inches wide at the bottom, was a tiny patch of light.  \"We have only just reached the top,\" Dick said; \"the snow must be near fifteen feet deep.\"  Small though the aperture was, it effected a sensible relief.  The feeling of oppression ceased; half an hour later the hole was closed up, and they knew that the snow was still falling.  Another length of stick was added, and the daylight again appeared.  The boys slept a good deal; they had no sensation of cold whatever, the heat of their bodies keeping the air at a comfortable temperature.  They did not feel so hungry as they expected, but they were very thirsty.  \"I shall eat some snow,\" Tom said.  \"I have heard that that makes you more thirsty,\" Dick remarked; \"hold some in your hands till it melts, and then sip the water.\"  Four days passed; then they found that the snow no longer continued to cover up the hole, and knew that the snow-storm had ceased.  The number of sticks required to reach the top was six, and as"]]]
