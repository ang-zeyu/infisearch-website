Very often the boys talked of home, and wondered what their friends were doing.  The first night, when they did not return, it would be hoped that they had stayed at the farm; but somebody would be sure to go over in the morning to see, and when the news arrived that they were missing, there would be a general turn out to find them.  \"They must have given up all hope by this time,\" Dick said, on the fifth morning, \"and must be pretty sure that we are buried in the drift somewhere; but, as all the bottoms will be like this, they will have given up all hopes of finding our bodies till the thaw comes.\"  \"That may be weeks,\" Tom said; \"we might as well have died at once.\"  \"We can live a long time here,\" Dick replied confidently.  \"I remember reading once of a woman who had been buried in the snow being got out alive a tremendous time afterwards.  I think it was five weeks, but it might have been more.  Hurrah!  I have got an idea, Tom.\"  \"What is that?\"  Tom asked.  \"Look here; we will tie three more sticks--\"  \"We can't spare any more sticks,\" Tom said; \"the snow is up to our knees already.\"  \"Ah! but thin sticks will do for this,\" Dick said; \"we can get some thin sticks out here.  We will tie them over the others, and on the top of all we will fasten my red pocket-handkerchief, like a flag; if any one comes down into this bottom they are sure to see it.\"  CHAPTER TWO.  THE RED FLAG.  Dick's plan was soon carried into effect, and the little red flag flew as an appeal for help ten feet above the snow in the lonely valley.  Down in Castleton events had turned out just as the boys had anticipated.  The night of the snow-storm there was no sleep for their parents, and at daybreak, next morning, Mr Humphreys and Mr Jackson set out on foot through the storm for the distant farm.  They kept to the road, but it took them four hours to reach the farm, for the drifts were many feet deep in the hollows, and they had the greatest difficulty in making their way through.  When, upon their arrival, they found the boys had left before the gale began, their consternation and grief were extreme, and they started at once on their return to Castleton.  Search-parties were immediately organised, and these, in spite of the fury of the storm, searched the hills in all directions.  After the first day, when it was found that they were not at any of the shepherds' huts scattered among the hills, all hopes of finding them alive ceased.  So hopeless was it considered, that few parties went out on the three following days; but on the fifth, when the snow-storm ceased and the sun shone out, numbers of men again tramped the hills in the vague hope of finding some sign of the missing boys; they returned disheartened.  The snow was two feet deep everywhere, twenty in many of the hollows.  The next day but few went out, for the general feeling was, that the bodies could not be discovered until the thaw came, and at present it was freezing sharply.  Among those who still kept up the search were several of the boys' school-fellows.  They had not been permitted to join while the snow-storm continued, and were therefore fresh at the work.  A party of four kept together, struggling through the deep snow-drifts, climbing up the hills, and enjoying the fun, in spite of the saddening nature of their errand.  On arriving at the brow of a deep valley five miles from home, they agreed that they would go no farther, as it was not likely that the missing boys could have wandered so far from their track.  That they had in fact done so was due to a sudden change in the direction of the wind; it had been driving in their faces when they started, and with bent down heads they had struggled against it, unconscious that it was sharply changing its direction.  \"Just let us have a look down into the bottom,\" one of the boys said; \"there may be a shepherd's hut here.\"  Nothing, however, was seen, save a smooth, white surface of snow.  \"What is that?\" one exclaimed suddenly.  \"Look, there is a little red flag flying down there--come along.\"  The boys rushed down the hill at full speed.  \"Don't all go near the flag,\" one said; \"you may be treading on their bodies.\"  They arrived within ten yards of the flag, in which they soon recognised a red pocket-handkerchief.  They were silent now, awestruck at the thought that their companions were lying dead beneath.  \"Perhaps it is not theirs,\" the eldest of the party said presently. \"Anyhow I had better take it off and carry it home.\"  Treading cautiously and with a white face, for he feared to feel beneath his feet one of the bodies of his friends, he stepped, knee-deep in the snow-drift, to the flag.  He took the little stick in his hand to pluck it up; he raised it a foot, and then gave a cry of astonishment and started back.  \"What is the matter?\" the others asked.  \"It was pulled down again,\" he said in awestruck tones.  \"I will swear it was pulled down again.\"  \"Oh, nonsense!\" one of the others said; \"you are dreaming.\"  \"I am not,\" the first replied positively; \"it was regularly jerked in my hand.\"  \"Can they be alive down there?\" one suggested.  \"Alive!  How can they be alive after five days, twenty feet deep in the snow?  Look at the flag!\"  There was no mistake this time; the flag was raised and lowered five or six times.  The boys took to their heels and ran and gathered in a cluster fifty yards away on the hill-side.  \"What can it be?\" they asked, looking in each others' pale faces.  The behaviour of the flag seemed to them something supernatural.  \"We had better go back and tell them at home,\" one of them said.  \"We can't do that; no one would believe us.  Look here, you fellows,\" and he glanced round at the bright sky, \"this is nonsense; the flag could not wave of itself; there must be somebody alive below; perhaps there is a shepherd's hut quite covered with the drift, and they have pushed the flag up through the chimney.\"  The supposition seemed a reasonable one, and a little ashamed of their panic the group returned towards the flag.  The eldest boy again approached it.  \"Go carefully, Tomkins, or you may fall right down a chimney.\"  The flag was still continuing its up and down movement; the boy approached and lay down on the snow close to it; then he took hold of the stick; he felt a pull, but held fast; then he put his mouth close to the hole, two or three inches in diameter, through which it passed.  \"Halloa!\" he shouted; \"is any one below?\"  A cry of \"Yes, yes,\" came back in reply.  \"The two Jacksons and Humphreys.\"  \"Hurrah!\" he shouted at the top of his voice, and his companions, although they had not heard the answer, joined in the cheer.  \"Are you all right?\" he shouted down again.  \"Yes, but please get help and dig us out.\"  \"All right; I will run all the way back; they will have men here in no time; good-bye; keep up your spirits.\"  \"They are all there below!\" he shouted to his friends.  \"Come on, you fellows, there is not a moment to lose.\"  Wild with excitement the boys made their way home; they rushed down the hill-sides, scrambled through the drifts in the bottoms, in which they sometimes disappeared altogether, and had to haul each other out, struggled up the hills, and, panting and breathless, rushed in a body into Mr Humphreys' farmhouse, that standing nearest to them, on their way to Castleton.  \"We have found them; we have found them,\" they panted out.  \"They are all alive.\"  Mrs Humphreys had risen from her seat in a chair by the fire as the boys entered, and uttering a faint cry fell back insensible.  At this moment the farmer, who had but five minutes before returned, having been out since daybreak on the hills, hurried into the room; he was taking off his heavy boots when he heard the rush of feet into the house.  \"We have found them, sir; they are all alive!\"  \"Thank God! thank God!\" the farmer exclaimed reverently, and then seeing his wife insensible hurried towards her, uttering a shout for the servants.  Two women ran in.  \"Look to your mistress,\" he said; \"she has fainted; the good news has been too much for her--the boys are found alive.\"  With mingled exclamations of gladness and dismay the servants raised their mistress.  \"Now, boys, where are they?\"  Mr Humphreys asked.  The lads gave a rapid narrative of what had happened.  \"Under the snow all this time!\" the farmer exclaimed; \"they must be, as you say, in a hut.  Now, will one of you stay and show me the way back, and the others go on to Mr Jackson's and other places, and bring a strong party of men with shovels on after us?\"  The lad who had spoken with the prisoners remained to act as guide, the others hurried off.  \"Come with me, my boy, into the larder.  There, help yourself; you must be hungry and tired, and you have got to do it over again.\"  Mr Humphreys then ran into the yard, and bade the four labourers provide themselves with shovels and prepare to accompany him at once.  He then went back into the parlour.  His wife was just opening her eyes; for a time she looked confused and bewildered, then suddenly she sat up and gazed beseechingly at her husband--memory had come back to her.  \"Yes, wife, thanks be to God, it is true--the boys are alive; I am just going with these men to dig them out.  They are snowed up in a hut. Now, Jane, get a large basket, and put in it lots of bread, and bacon-- the men who are working will want something; fill the largest stone jar with beer; put in a bottle of brandy and a bottle of milk, and set to and get some soup ready; bring three small mattresses downstairs and a lot of blankets.\"  Five minutes later the search-party started, Mr Humphreys and the guide leading the way; the men followed, one carrying five shovels; another, the basket and jar; the other two, three hurdles on which were placed the mattresses and blankets.

[Sidenote: What Should Have Been Done]  To a woodsman the answer would have stood out as plain as print. He would have retraced his way, explored farther, found the right river, and continued. But poor Hubbard was in a hurry, and moreover possessed that optimistic temperament that so endeared him to all who knew him. \"They must have made a mistake in the distance. I guess this is all right,\" said he, and pushed on against difficulties that eventually killed him.  To a man accustomed to exploration such a mistake is inconceivable. Labrador is not more dangerous than other wooded northern countries; not so dangerous as the big mountains; much safer than the desert. A wrong turn in any of these wildernesses may mean death. Forty men succumbed to the desert last summer. Do not make that wrong turn. Be sure. Take _nothing_ for granted--either that \"they made a mistake in the distance,\" or that \"it's probably all right.\" One of the greatest of American wilderness travelers knew this--as all wilderness travelers must--and phrased it in an epigram that has become classic. \"Be sure you are right, and then go ahead,\" advised Daniel Boone.  [Sidenote: Alertness]  So you do not get lost--barring accidents--you are safe enough. But to travel well you must add to your minor affairs the same quality, slightly diluted, perhaps, that I have endeavored to describe above. In this application it becomes thoroughness and smartness. A great many people object while camping to keeping things in trim, to getting up in the morning, to moving with expedition and precision. \"Oh, what's the use in being so particular!\" they grumble, \"this is supposed to be a pleasure trip.\"  [Sidenote: Discipline]  Outside the fact that a certain amount of discipline brings efficiency, there is no doubt that a slack camp means trouble sooner or later. Where things are not picked up, something important will sooner or later be lost or left behind. Where the beginning of the day's journey hangs fire, sooner or later night will catch you in a very bad place indeed. Where men get in the habit of slouching, physically and mentally, they become in emergencies unable to summon presence of mind, and incapable of swift, effective movements. The _morale_ is low; and exclusive of the fact that such things are an annoyance to the spirit, they may in some exceptional occasion give rise to serious trouble. Algernon is ten minutes slow in packing his horse; and Algernon gets well cursed. He is hurt as to the soul, and demands of himself aggrievedly how ten minutes can be valued so high. It is not the ten minutes as a space of time, but as a measure of incompetence. This pack train is ten minutes short of what a pack train should be; and if the leader's mind is properly constructed, he is proportionately annoyed.  Although not strictly germane to a discussion of equipments, I am tempted to hold up a horrible example.  [Sidenote: A Horrible Example]  One evening we were all sitting around a big after-dinner fire at the Forest Supervisor's summer camp in the mountains, when an outfit drifted in and made camp a few hundred yards down stream. After an interval the leader of the party came over and introduced himself.  [Sidenote: A Horrible Example]  He proved to be a youngish man, with curly hair, regular features, a good physique, and eyes handsome, but set too close together. A blue flannel shirt whose top button was unfastened, rolled back to show his neck; a handkerchief was knotted below that; in all his external appearance he leaned toward the foppish-picturesque. This was in itself harmless enough. Shortly he began to tell us things. He confided that his chief ambition was to rope a bear; he related adventures in the more southern mountains; he stated that he intended to travel up through the Minarets and over Agnew's Pass, and by way of Tuolumne. This was to consume two weeks! Finally he became more personal. He told us how President Roosevelt when on his Pacific Coast tour had spoken to him personally.  \"When the train started,\" said he, \"I ran after it as hard as I could with a lot of others, but I ran a lot faster and got ahead, so the President spoke directly to me--not to the crowd, but to _me_!\"  He left us suitably impressed. Next morning his camp was astir at five o'clock--as was proper considering the strenuous programme he had outlined. About seven our friend came over to get his animals, which he had turned out in the Supervisor's pasture over night--ten animals in another man's mountain pasture! We had a shooting match, and talked Reserve matters for just one hour and twenty minutes. Then somebody waked up.  \"I wonder what's become of Jones; let's go see.\"  We went. Jones was standing dusty in the middle of the corral. In his hand he held a short loop not over three feet across. This he whirled forward and _overhand_. Occasionally he would cast it at a horse. Of course the outraged and astounded animal was stricken about the knees, whereupon he circulated the confines of the corral at speed.  [Sidenote: Jones and the Mule]  And the animals! At the moment of our arrival Jones was bestowing attention on a dignified and gaunt mule some seventeen hands high. I never saw such a giraffe. Two about the size of jackasses hovered near. One horse's lower lip wabbled abjectly below a Roman nose.  We watched a few moments; then offered mildly to \"help.\" Jones, somewhat heated and cross, accepted. The first horse I roped I noticed was barefoot. So were the others. And the route was over a rough granite and snow country. Thus we formed a procession, each leading some sort of equine freak. It was by now nearly nine o'clock.  Camp we found about half picked up. The other members of the party were nice, well-meaning people, but absolutely inexperienced in the ways of the wilderness. They had innocently intrusted themselves to Jones on the strength of his self-made reputation; and now undoubtedly were taking all this fuss and discomfit quite as part of \"roughing it.\"  [Sidenote: Helping the Tenderfeet]  When we saw them we were stricken with pity and a kindly feeling which Jones had failed to arouse, so we turned in to help them saddle up.  Jones was occupied with a small mule which he claimed was \"bad.\" He hitched said mule to a tree, then proceeded to elevate one hind leg by means of a rope thrown over a limb. Why he did not simply blindfold the animal no one could tell. We looked forward with some joy to the throwing of the pack-hitches.  [Illustration: On the Trail]  [Sidenote: A Forest Fire]  But at this moment a Ranger dashed up with news of a forest fire over in the Rock Creek country. The Rangers present immediately scattered for their saddle horses, while I took a pack and went in search of supplies.  Shortly after one o'clock I was organized, and departed on the trail of the Rangers. They had struck over the ridge, and down the other side of the mountains. Their tracks were easy to follow, and once atop the divide I could see the flames and smoke of the fire over the next mountain system. Desiring to arrive before dark, I pushed ahead as rapidly as possible. About half way down the mountain I made out dust ahead.  \"A messenger coming back for something,\" thought I.  In ten minutes I was stricken dumb to overtake the Jones party plodding trustingly along in the tracks made by the Rangers.  \"Well,\" I greeted them, \"what are you doing over here? A little off your beat, aren't you?\"  The members of the party glanced at each other, while Jones turned a dull red.  \"Wrong trail, eh?\" said he easily; \"where does this one go to?\"  [Sidenote: Jones and the Trail]  \"Why, this isn't a trail!\" I cried. \"Can't you see it's just fresh tracks made since morning? This will take you to the fire, and that's about all. Your trail is miles to the north of here.\"  For the moment he was crushed. It was now too late to think of going back; a short cut was impossible on account of the nature of the country. Finally I gave him a direction which would cut another trail--not where he had intended to go, but at least leading to horse feed. Then I bade him farewell, and rode on to the fire.  [Sidenote: We Put Them Right]  Long after dark, when hunting for the place the boys had camped, I met that deluded outfit moving supperless, homeless, lost, like ghosts in the glow of the fire line. Jones was cross and snapped at me when I asked him if he wasn't seeing a good deal of country. But I looked at the tired faces of the other members of the party, and my heart relented, and I headed them for a meadow.  \"How far beyond is Squaw Dome?\" asked Jones as he started.  \"Sixteen miles--about,\" said I.  \"About eight hours the way you and I travel, then,\" said he.  \"About eight weeks the way you travel,\" amended a Ranger standing near.  Two days later a shakemaker came to help us fight fire.  \"Oh, yes, they passed my place,\" said he. \"I went out and tried to tell him he was off'n the trail, but he waved me aside. 'We have our maps,' says he, very lofty.\"  Twelve days subsequently I rode a day and a half to Jackass Meadow. They told us the Jones party just passed! I wonder what became of them, and how soon their barefooted horses got tender.  Now the tenderfoot one helps out, nor makes fun of, for he is merely inexperienced and will learn. But this man is in the mountains every summer. He likewise wishes to rope bears.  [Sidenote: An Object Lesson]  No better example could be instanced as to the value of camp alertness, efficiency, the use of one's head, and the willingness to take advice. I had with me at the time a younger brother whom I was putting through his first paces; and Jones was to me invaluable as an object lesson.  The purpose of this chapter is not to tell you how to do things, but how to go at them. If you can keep from getting lost, and if you can _keep awake_, you will at least reach home safe.
