When, for example, it becomes necessary to introduce the new language spoken by the inhabitants of the interior world, we are brought in half a dozen paragraphs to an understanding of its characteristic features, and proceed to the use of it without more ado. A more timid writer would have misspent labor and ingenuity in dwelling upon a matter which Mr. Bradshaw rightly perceived to be of no essential importance; and we should have been wearied and delayed in arriving at the really interesting scenes.  The philosophy of the book is worthy of more serious notice. The religion of the new race is based upon the worship of the human soul, whose powers have been developed to a height unthought of by our section of mankind, although on lines the commencement of which are already within our view. The magical achievements of theosophy and occultism, as well as the ultimate achievements of orthodox science, are revealed in their most amazing manifestations, and with a sobriety and minuteness of treatment that fully satisfies what may be called the transcendental reader. The whole philosophic and religious situation is made to appear admirably plausible: but we are gradually brought to perceive that there is a futility and a rottenness inherent in it all, and that for the Goddess of Atvatabar, lofty, wise, and immaculate though she be, there is, nevertheless, a loftier and sublimer experience in store. The finest art of the book is shown here: a deep is revealed underneath the deep, and the final outcome is in accord with the simplest as well as the profoundest religious perception.  But it would be useless to attempt longer to withhold the reader from the marvellous journey that awaits him. A word of congratulation, however, is due in regard to the illustrations. They reach a level of excellence rare even at this day; the artists have evidently been in thorough sympathy with the author, and have given to the eye what the latter has presented to the understanding. A more lovable divinity than that which confronts us on the golden throne it has seldom been our fortune to behold; and the designs of animal-plants are as remarkable as anything in modern illustrative art: they are entirely unique, and possess a value quite apart from their artistic grace.  The chief complaint I find to urge against the book is that it stops long before my curiosity regarding the contents of the interior world is satisfied. There are several continents and islands yet to be heard from. But I am reassured by the termination of the story that there is nothing to prevent the hero from continuing his explorations; and I shall welcome the volume which contains the further points of his extraordinary and commendable enterprise.                                                      JULIAN HAWTHORNE.     THE GODDESS OF ATVATABAR.   CHAPTER I.  A POLAR CATASTROPHE.   I had been asleep when a terrific noise awoke me. I rose up on my couch in the cabin and gazed wildly around, dazed with the feeling that something extraordinary had happened. By degrees becoming conscious of my surroundings, I saw Captain Wallace, Dr. Merryferry, Astronomer Starbottle, and Master-at-Arms Flathootly beside me.  \"Commander White,\" said the captain, \"did you hear that roar?\"  \"What roar?\" I replied. \"Where are we?\"  \"Why, you must have been asleep,\" said he, \"and yet the roar was enough to raise the dead. It seemed as if both earth and heaven were split open.\"  \"What is that hissing sound I hear?\" I inquired.  \"That, sir,\" said the doctor, \"is the sound of millions of flying sea-fowl frightened by the awful noise. The midnight sun is darkened with the flight of so many birds. Surely, sir, you must have heard that dreadful shriek. It froze the blood in our veins with horror.\"  I began to understand that the _Polar King_ was safe, and that we were all still alive and well. But what could my officers mean by the terrible noise they talked about?  I jumped out of bed saying, \"Gentlemen, I must investigate this whole business. You say the _Polar King_ is safe?\"  \"Shure, sorr,\" said Flathootly, the master-at-arms, \"the ship lies still anchored to the ice-fut where we put her this afthernoon. She's all right.\"  I at once went on deck. Sure enough the ship was as safe as if in harbor. Birds flew about in myriads, at times obscuring the sun, and now and then we heard growling reverberations from distant icebergs, answering back the fearful roar that had roused them from their polar sleep.  The sea, that is to say the enormous ice-pack in which we lay, heaved and fell like an earthquake. It was evident that a catastrophe of no common character had happened.  What was the cause that startled the polar midnight with such unwonted commotion?  Sailors are very superstitious; with them every unknown sound is a cry of disaster. It was necessary to discover what had happened, lest the courage of my men should give way and involve the whole expedition in ruin.  The captain, although alarmed, was as brave as a lion, and as for Flathootly, he would follow me through fire and water like the brave Irishman that he was. The scientific staff were gentlemen of education, and could be relied upon to show an example of bravery that would keep the crew in good spirits.  \"Do you remember the creek in the ice-foot we passed this morning,\" said the captain, \"the place where we shot the polar bear?\"  \"Quite well,\" I said.  \"Well, the roar that frightened us came from that locality. You remember all day we heard strange squealing sounds issuing from the ice, as though it was being rent or split open by some subterranean force.\"  The entire events of the day came to my mind in all their clearness. I did remember the strange sounds the captain referred to. I thought then that perhaps they had been caused by Professor Rackiron's shell of terrorite which he had fired at the southern face of the vast range of ice mountains that formed an impenetrable barrier to the pole. The men were in need of a change of diet, and we thought the surest way of getting the sea-fowl was to explode a shell among them. The face of the ice cliffs was the home of innumerable birds peculiar to the Arctic zone. There myriads of gulls, kittiwakes, murres, guillemots, and such like creatures, made the ice alive with feathered forms.  The terrorite gun was fired with ordinary powder, and although we could approach no nearer the cliffs than five miles, on account of the solid ice-foot, yet our chief gun was good for that distance.  The shell was fired and exploded high up on the face of the crags. The effect was startling. The explosion brought down tons of the frosty marble. The d√©bris fell like blocks of iron that rang with a piercing cry on the ice-bound breast of the ocean. Millions of sea-fowl of every conceivable variety darkened the air. Their rushing wings sounded like the hissing of a tornado. Thousands were killed by the shock. A detachment of sailors under First Officer Renwick brought in heavy loads of dead fowl for a change of diet. The food, however, proved indigestible, and made the men ill.  We resolved, as soon as the sun had mounted the heavens from his midnight declension, to retrace our course somewhat and discover the cause of the terrible outcry of the night. We had been sailing for weeks along the southern ice-foot that belonged to the interminable ice hills which formed an effectual barrier to the pole. Day after day the _Polar King_ had forced its way through a gigantic floe of piled-up ice blocks, floating cakes of ice, and along ridges of frozen enormity, cracked, broken, and piled together in endless confusion. We were in quest of a northward passage out of the terrible ice prison that surrounded us, but failed to discover the slightest opening. It had become a question of abandoning our enterprise of discovering the North Pole and returning home again or abandoning the ship, and, taking our dogs and sledges, brave the nameless terrors of the icy hills. Of course in such case the ship would be our base of supplies and of action in whatever expedition might be set on foot for polar discovery.  About six o'clock in the morning of the 20th of July we began to work the ship around, to partially retrace our voyage. All hands were on the lookout for any sign of such a catastrophe as might have caused the midnight commotion. After travelling about ten miles we reached the creek where the bear had been killed the day before. The man on the lookout on the top-mast sung out:  \"Creek bigger than yesterday!\"  Before we had time to examine the creek with our glasses he sung out:  \"Mountains split in two!\"  Sure enough, a dark blue gash ran up the hills to their very summit, and as soon as the ship came abreast of the creek we saw that the range of frozen precipices had been riven apart, and a streak of dark blue water lay between, on which the ship might possibly reach the polar sea beyond.  Dare we venture into that inviting gulf?  The officers crowded around me. \"Well, gentlemen,\" said I, \"what do you say, shall we try the passage?\"  \"We only measure fifty feet on the beam, while the fissure is at least one hundred feet wide; so we have plenty of room to work the ship,\" said the captain.  \"But, captain,\" said I, \"if we find the width only fifty feet a few miles from here, what then?\"  \"Then we must come back,\" said he, \"that's all.\"  \"Suppose we cannot come back--suppose the walls of ice should begin to close up again?\" I said.  \"I don't believe they will,\" said Professor Goldrock, who was our naturalist and was well informed in geology.  \"Why not?\" I inquired.  \"Well,\" said he, \"to our certain knowledge this range of ice hills extends five hundred miles east and west of us. The sea is here over one hundred and fifty fathoms deep. This barrier is simply a congregation of icebergs, frozen into a continuous solid mass. It is quite certain that the mass is anchored to the bottom, so that it is not free to come asunder"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32827"],["title","Think Yourself to Death (#1)"],["body","ing, he went to find Kovandaswamy.  \"Is this supposed to be a joke?\" Mayhem demanded.  \"You never asked what the--\" Kovandaswamy began.  \"How am I supposed to find out anything--like this?\"  \"It's a young body, a healthy body. It is also the one we were given when the Galactic League first came here. It is the only one we were given.\"  \"Take it or leave it, eh?\"  \"I'm afraid so, Mayhem.\"  \"All right. All right, I guess I shouldn't complain. It could probably outrun and outfight and outthink the dyspeptic old Sirian gentleman, and things turned out well enough on Sirius III. But it'll probably take most of my time just getting used to it, Kovandaswamy. I'm supposed to be conducting an investigation.\"  \"At least as an Ophiuchan you won't arouse suspicion.\"  Mayhem nodded slowly, with reluctance. There was nothing else to say. He shook hands with Kovandaswamy and, wearing the loin cloth and the shawl, left the Galactic League building.  With, of course, a completely new identity.  Mayhem walked a mile and a half through hot, arid country. The League building was isolated, as if its inmates might contaminate the native Ophiuchans. Along the dusty road Mayhem passed a _guru_, the name for a wise man or a holy man first in India and now here on Ophiuchus IX. The guru sat in contemplation of the tip of his nose, legs crossed, soles of feet up, eyes half-closed. The guru remained that way, without moving, until Mayhem was out of sight. Then the guru behaved in a very un-guru-like manner.  The guru got up quite nimbly, joints creaking, skin dry and cracked. Three strides brought him to a tree with a partly hollow trunk. He lifted a radio transmitter and began to talk.         *       *       *       *       *  In twenty generations, the initially small population of Ophiuchus IX, all colonists from India on Earth, had increased geometrically. The colonized planet, now, was as over-populated as the teeming sub-continent which long ago had sent the colonists seeking a new home. As a result, unemployment was chronic, discontent widespread, and whatever inner serenity mysticism might bring was widely sought after. This did not stop the non-mystics, however, of whom there were many, from seeking jobs that could pay money that could fill empty bellies....  [Illustration: The crazed mob was bent upon rapine and murder.]  A long line gathered outside the employment office of Denebian Exports the morning after Mayhem had left the League building in his new body. Denebian Exports was the largest outworld company currently on Ophiuchus, a company which had solved the outworlder-suicide problem quite simply by hiring no one but natives. Still, hoots and catcalls surrounded those on the employment line. Other jobless Ophiuchans, apparently preferring near-starvation to working for the outworlders, threatened to make the situation dangerous.  Pandit Gandhi Menon, a lean, handsome Ophiuchan of perhaps thirty years, wished there was some way he could shut his ears to the abuse. He needed work. His father and mother were ill, his child was starving, his wife already dead. The gurus offered their own unique solution, of course. The body is nothing, they said. The mind is everything. But thus had the gurus spoken for four thousand years, on Earth and on Ophiuchus. The great majority of Ophiuchans, Pandit Gandhi Menon included, preferred food for the body to food for mystic thought. Still, the crowds were ugly, threatening to break up the line of job-seekers if Denebian Exports didn't open its doors soon....  An unkempt little man, not old but with a matted growth of beard, an unwashed body which gave the impression of wiry strength, and wild eyes, abruptly flung himself at the young woman in line in front of Pandit.  Shouting, \"Not our women, too!\" the little man attacked the girl, trying to drag her from the line. \"It is bad enough our men, but not our women!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Pandit caught the fanatic's wiry arm and brought it behind his scrawny back in a hammerlock. \"Leave her alone,\" he said. \"If you try that again, I'll break your arm.\"  The fanatic looked at Pandit with hate in his eyes, but stepped back and stood to one side mouthing invective.  The girl, who was about twenty-five years old, had a livid mark on her arm. She wore loin cloth and shawl, the usual garb. She was, Pandit observed for the first time, quite pretty.  \"Thank you,\" she said. \"I--I'm not sure I like working for the outworlders. But I need the money.\"  \"Don't we all,\" Pandit told her. \"But we're not hired yet. I am Pandit Gandhi Menon.\"  \"Sria Krishna,\" the girl said, smiling at him. \"What sort of work is it?\"  \"Don't you know, Sria Krishna?\"  The girl shook her head and Pandit said: \"Actually, I guess I don't know, either. But there are rumors the outworlders want jet-pilots. Not for rocketry. For jets. To fly to the Empty Places.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"The Empty Places? Why?\"  Pandit shrugged. \"Because they are empty, perhaps. Because they are too dry and too arid to support life. Because Denebian Export can claim whatever it found there, for free export. So go the rumors. But surely you can't pilot a jet.\"  \"Can you?\"  \"Yes,\" Pandit said promptly with a faint show of pride.  \"My father taught me. I want to thank you for what--\"  \"Nothing. Anyone in my position would have done it. This rabble--\"  The rabble was still noisy. Occasionally they hurled offal at the stragglers joining the rear of the long line. But Pandit and Sria Krishna stood in the forefront, and presently the door opened. In a few minutes Pandit watched the girl disappear inside. He waited nervously, licking dry lips with a parched tongue. It was early morning, but already very hot. He needed the work. Any work. He needed the money which outworlders could pay so abundantly for honest work. He wondered if the fanatic gurus ever thought of that. Then the door in front of him opened again and a fat, unctuous-looking Ophiuchan came out. He seemed to be an official of sorts.  \"One more!\" he said. \"Only one! The rest of you begone.\"  Behind Pandit there was a general press of bodies, but he was first in line and did not surrender his position. The unctuous-looking man admitted him, half-expecting a bribe. Pandit passed him by; he didn't have a single copper.  He approached a desk. The crowd noise outside was loud, those who had not joined the line crowing because most of those on it had been turned away. Behind the desk sat a small Denebian man of middle years. He looked nervous.  \"Can you fly?\" he asked in a voice almost desperately thin.  \"Yes,\" Pandit said. Then the rumors were right.  \"How much experience?\"  \"Five years on and off.\"  \"You have a license?\"  \"There are no licenses on Ophiuchus IX,\" Pandit pointed out.  \"Yes, of course. I'm sorry. Habit. You people don't lie.\"  \"We try not to.\"  \"Your name?\"  Pandit told him. The Denebian wrote it down on a form and said: \"You'll do. Pay is twenty credits a mission.\" It wasn't much, but it was more than Pandit had expected.  \"What do we fly?\" he asked. Questions didn't seem welcome, but no harm trying.         *       *       *       *       *  The Denebian looked at him and laughed. \"You want the job?\"  \"Yes, I want the job.\"  \"Then don't ask questions.\"  Pandit nodded.  \"Out through that door, then. The other new pilots are assembling.\"  And Pandit left the small office.  A moment later a buzzer sounded on the Denebian's desk. He spoke into a grid: \"Orkap here. Go ahead.\"  \"The guru near the League building reports that a native Ophiuchan left the building heading for the city.\"  \"When was this?\"  \"Yesterday morning.\"  \"And?\"  \"Draw your own conclusions. Natives don't go near the League headquarters as a rule, do they?\"  \"No.\"  \"And the League, of course, will want to know about the suicides?\"  \"Yes, but--\"  \"But nothing,\" said the radio voice, which belonged to the only other Denebian currently on Ophiuchus IX. \"We can assume this native is a spy. For the League, Orkap.\"  \"All right. I don't see any need to worry, though.\"  \"Don't you? The gurus, like the other natives, can sham, but they can't lie. Sooner or later a guru will be brought out of trance by the League, questioned, and--\"  \"Tell them about us?\" Orkap asked in a shocked voice.  \"It could happen. Maybe it's happened already. There won't be any proof, of course, but the League would send a spy. Suppose I describe this native to you.\"  Orkap said, \"Go ahead,\" and the radio voice did so.  In a shocked voice Orkap admitted: \"I've given that Ophiuchan a pilot's job this morning. There can't be any doubt about it.\"  \"Ah, then you see? You see?\"  \"I can fix that. I can--\"  \"Orkap, Orkap. You'll do nothing now. Let the spy alone for now. Then, in the Empty Places, you will merely announce to the pilots that there is a spy among them. Don't reveal who it is.\" He could not believe his ears.  \"But--\"  \"They want work. They need work. They'll all be afraid the finger of guilt may point at them. They'll work like dogs for you, and I wouldn't be surprised if they uncovered the spy themselves.\"  \"Yes,\" Orkap said. \"Yes, I understand.\"  \"All but one thing, Orkap. There is one thing you don't understand. The spy's identity--\"  \"You already told me who the spy was.\"  \"Yes. But there is another spy. Working for us, in the League building.\"  \"I never knew,\" said Orkap.  \"The spy among your pilots is more than appearance indicates. Did you ever hear of Johnny Mayhem?\"  Orkap's heart jumped into his throat. Who in the galaxy hadn't heard of Mayhem? \"But,\" he gasped, \"a--\"  \"Nevertheless. It is Mayhem.\"  Orkap was suddenly afraid, more afraid than he had ever been in his life. The ubiquitous Mayhem.         *       *       *       *       *  The fierce white sun of Ophiuchus IX broiled down on the Empty Places, a featureless desert two-thousand miles across and as lividly white as bleached bone.
