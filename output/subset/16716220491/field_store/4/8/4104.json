I remember that      I ate a whole can of roast chicken and many sweet      biscuits, and washed the whole down with some sherry wine      drank from the bottle--my first experience in wine      drinking.       Much refreshed, I took up my musket and started for      Washington with an oddly mixed crowd of gay militia      uniforms representing parts of many regiments. Yet there      were still behind us good, orderly, full regiments, that      stayed in Centreville till after midnight and came into      Washington late the next day in fine marching order.      _They_ did not run, and my brother's regiment was one of      them. It was 10 P. M. when I reached Fairfax Court House.      There I rested, sitting on a rail fence, as a motley      crowd poured by, each squad saying that the Black Horse      Cavalry was coming. So I clung to my musket, though my      shoulders began to get a little sore. It was after      midnight when I started again. The night was very dark,      for heavy clouds obscured the moon. The road, very rough      in itself, was now full of materials thrown out of      wagons. There were shovels, pickaxes, boxes, barrels,      iron mess-kettles, muskets, knapsacks, and all sorts of      litter that soldiers could throw away, and over these and      the loose stones of the rough road we stumbled in the      dark, amid choking dust, and up and down the long rolling      hills that the army marched over so often afterwards      during that terrible war. Still, I well remember that it      seemed to me a sort of wild picnic; and I would clutch my      gun and feel of my cartridges in a very determined mood      to defend Washington to the death.       Wearily the night wore on; and steadily I tramped,      talking in the dark, from time to time, with      strangers--men from all parts of the Union whom I didn't      see then and probably never saw afterwards. Bad as it was      to march in the dust, it was still worse when it began to      rain just before daybreak. Gently it came at first; and      slowly the dust became a thick paste of slippery mud.      Steadily the storm increased till it became a downpour. I      had on a thin black summer suit, a straw hat, and a pair      of low-cut thin shoes and white stockings. When day broke      we were a bedraggled, thoroughly soaked, mud-stained      party. Of all that vast crowd probably I presented the      worst appearance, for I was the only citizen in that      section of the crowd. I bantered jokes with such as were      in joking mood, but most of the crowd were now silent and      weary. All along the road lay men asleep in the pouring      rain. There were blood blisters on my feet, but never      once did I stop except to get a drink of water at a brook      just after daylight. The rain now fell in torrents; we      were literally wading in mud and water.       The thirty miles from Centreville to Washington seemed      three times that distance. My gun grew more and more      heavy, and I shifted it constantly. It was about ten      o'clock Monday forenoon when I reached the Virginia end      of Long Bridge. A strong guard was posted there to stop      the troops; for Washington was already full of fugitive      soldiers. Forcing my way through a vast mob of shouting,      cursing soldiers, I reached the officer in charge, and      got a rough reception. First he doubted my pass; next he      wanted to take away my musket, but I protested that I had      saved it from the enemy; and at length he allowed me to      pass carrying the gun I had so honestly won. I went down      Pennsylvania Avenue much stared at as I limped along.      Reaching my hotel, I took a bath and turned into a good      bed, thinking of my brother and the thousands of other      soldiers who were out in the rain and many of whom would      perhaps have no bed to turn into for three years; for      there were a few three years regiments even then.       The next day, to my great joy, my brother's regiment      marched in and over to Georgetown heights; and, after      visiting them there, I sent my gun home by Adams Ex. and      took the train for Boston. Said my father, when I got      home, \"Well, I think you have got enough of war now.\"      \"No, sir,\" I said, and in less than thirty days I had      enlisted; and three years from the date of the first      battle of Bull Run I was skirmishing about six miles from      Richmond--three years--and yet I hadn't quite got to      Richmond.       That Bull-Run musket is the only war weapon left in the      family, and I hope you will keep it in memory of the good      work I was willing to do with it, even before I was a      soldier.   Dr. SAMUEL A. GREEN then said:  I have listened with intense interest to Mr. Clement's paper, as I was not only present at the skirmish therein described, but as Assistant Surgeon of the First Massachusetts Volunteers it was my professional duty to look after the wounded on that occasion. I remember vividly the events of that day, July 18, 1861, not only because it was the first time that I ever was under fire, but because it was the greatest fight that up to that time the Union army had fought. I remember, too, the proud record made by the First Massachusetts in that preliminary skirmish. In each of two companies,--G and H,--the regiment lost six men; and Company H--to which Mr. Clement's paper relates--had more men wounded than killed. Nor were these the only losses met by the Old First in that memorable action. The wounded men came under my professional charge, and they received such care as could be given them on the field of battle, scanty though it was. The men who fell in that skirmish--some of them my friends and all my acquaintances--left impressions on my mind so deep that I have since accepted without hesitation the fact that \"war is hell.\" This action of July 18 was only a skirmish that preceded the first battle of Bull Run, which was fought three days later on July 21. The armies contending on that day were commanded, respectively, by General McDowell and General Beauregard; and the result is now a matter of history.  As an instance of the changes which the whirligig of time brings round, I will relate a fact which is purely personal. In December, 1878, I was appointed a member of the Commission authorized by Congress to investigate the Yellow Fever Epidemic of that year, and sessions were held in several southern cities, including New Orleans. While the Commission was in session in that city, General Beauregard was a regular attendant at the meetings, and for some days I was thrown much with him, and we talked over together the campaign of 1861. In answer to one of my questions, why the southern army did not follow up their victory and capture the city of Washington, he replied that President Davis was strongly of the opinion that such an event would produce a revulsion of feeling on the part of northern sympathizers with the south and thus would defeat their own purpose.  A few years later, in the summer of 1883, I was a member of the Board of Visitors appointed by the President to make the annual examination at Annapolis, Maryland, where I was thrown into intimate relations with General McDowell. I slept under the same roof with him and ate at the same table, and often we discussed military matters. These two episodes in my life are now pleasant events to remember.  I was deeply impressed with General McDowell's strict abstinence from the use of champagne and other alcoholic liquors. Receiving his early education in France, one would suppose that, like the French boys who were his companions, he would drink Bordeaux wine as freely as milk; but he told me that never in Europe or here was he in the habit of taking anything stronger than water. In my intercourse with him for a week I saw nothing in his life to disprove this statement.  Mr. JAMES FORD RHODES said:  The reports in circulation after the Battle of Bull Run, regarding McDowell, are an instance of the hasty and uncharitable judgment of newspapers and their readers. It was at once said that the Union defeat was due to McDowell's intoxication. As a matter of fact McDowell never in his life drank a drop of beer, wine, or any alcoholic beverage, and curiously enough too did not use tobacco in any form. The proof of this is undoubted, but as part of it I may mention the positive assurances of Dr. William H. Russell, the American correspondent of the London Times, sometimes spoken of as \"Bull-Run Russell,\" who knew McDowell well and saw him on the day of the battle, and of Colonel Franklin Haven, who served on his staff during the war. Dr. Russell told me that on the morning of the battle McDowell ate watermelon for breakfast, and the free indulgence in this succulent fruit made him ill, which was the sole foundation for the cruel report.[5]  [5] Since my statement our associate Barrett Wendell has communicated to me this information: \"Edmund Clarence Stedman, who was present at Bull Run as a reporter, told me that on the night before the battle McDowell, hungry after his preparation, was served at his supper with canned fruit,--I think peaches,--and ate heartily of them. The fruit was probably tainted and brought on an attack of cholera morbus, from which Stedman saw him acutely suffering while the battle was in progress.\" I have no doubt that this is a more accurate version than Russell's.

Bontarc turned suddenly upon the dour Retoc. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"is there any truth to the legend that the clock in the tower will toll the end of one hundred years?\"  \"None whatever,\" the sadistic Abarian snapped. \"A rumor passed from the lips of one old woman to another.\"  Bontarc smiled. \"Then why are you here? The hundred years are up today.\"  Retoc's hand moved toward his whip-sword. \"Are you calling me a liar?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Bontarc watched alertly as the blade came partly from its scabbard. \"If we fight we may miss the tolling of the clock,\" he said evenly.  With an oath, Retoc pushed the sword back into its scabbard and put sharp heels to his stad's flanks. The animal screamed indignantly and rocketed ahead. Bontarc smiled and turned his car back toward his own group.  And now they were assembled and waiting, the curious of the planet Tarth. Would the clock toll as it was rumored Portox had said? Would an avenger come forth to challenge Retoc and his Abarian hordes?  There was not much time left. Swiftly the clock ticked off the remaining moments and the end of one hundred years was at hand. Silence settled over the assembled Tarthans.  Then a great sound boomed over the plains; a single ringing peal that rose majestically into the air, reverberated across the empty land that once had been the site of a thriving, prosperous nation. The first part of the legend had been fulfilled.  Then, suddenly, chaos reigned. With a great thundering that shook the ground upon which they stood, the gray tower exploded in crimson glory; a great mushrooming blossom of red fire erupted skyward hurling the assembled Tarthans to the ground where they lay in numbed stupor.  The thunderous report echoed across the plain ten thousand times louder than the tolling of the clock. But aside from the initial dulling shock, no Tarthan was injured because the crushing power rose upward.  There was an expression of mute wonder on Bontarc's face. And he thought: We have not seen the end of this. It is only the beginning. But the beginning of what? Only Portox could have known. And Portox was--where?  Bontarc started his car and moved across the plain sensing cosmic events but not knowing....  Not knowing that the sound of the tolling clock had gone with more than the speed of light across the void, had been flung arrow-straight to a brooding mansion in the heart of a thick forest upon another planet; to the door of a cavern deep in the rock beneath the mansion.  That even now the lock of this door had responded to the electronic impulse and the huge panel was swinging slowly open.     CHAPTER III  _The Man in the Cavern_   As the sound of the tolling clock died out across the Plains of Ofrid, a man opened his eyes on the planet far away and saw for the first time the place in which he had spent one hundred years.  He awoke with neither fright nor surprise but rather with a sense of wonder. He arose slowly from the great bed upon which he had lain and allowed his attention to roam about the strange place in which he found himself.  In the wall opposite the bed there was set a full length mirror and as the man turned he saw himself for the first time; a tall, broadly-muscled figure of heroic proportions. Completely naked, his body was reflected as masculine perfection in every detail.  For a few moments, the man stared at the body as though it belonged to someone else. Then he spoke musingly. \"You did your work well, Portox, my friend.\"  The sound of his own voice startled him but not so much so as the content of the words. A baffled expression touched his handsome face. Who was Portox? And what work had he done? What place was this--and for that matter, who was he himself, this naked figure which looked back at him from the glittering mirror?  The questions were annoying because he felt that he knew the answers. Yet they would not come within reach of his conscious mind.  He had little time to ponder this enigma however because at that moment he became aware of a second presence in the room. He turned. A man stood just inside the open door.  The naked one stared at the other with an interest that left no room for self-consciousness nor shame. \"Who are you?\" he asked.  \"My name is John Pride,\" the man answered. He was a man of erect bearing and though there was wonder and surprise in his voice he bore himself with a quiet dignity. \"And now,\" he added, \"may I ask you the same question?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The naked man looked down at his own body and for the first time seemed conscious of its nudity. He glanced around the room and saw a robe of royal purple lying across a chair by the bed. He stepped over and lifted the robe and put it on. As he was tying the rich purple cord around his waist he looked frankly back at John Pride and said, \"I do not know. I honestly do not know.\"  John Pride said, \"I have wondered what I would find in this cavern--wondered through the years. Only in my wildest fancies did I tell myself that a fellow human--or even a living creature--awaited me here. But now I find this is true.\"  The younger man regarded his visitor with a calmness that belied any wariness between them. John Pride noted this with admiration and respect. The young man said, \"Won't you be seated?\" and when his guest was comfortable, regarded him with a smile. \"Perhaps there are some things we should talk over.\"  \"Perhaps there are. You say you do not know your own name?\"  \"That only begins to sum up my ignorance. I am not only unaware of my identity but I haven't the faintest notion of what this place is--where it is--or how I came here.\"  It was John Pride's turn to stare. While doing so, he analyzed the younger man keenly. He saw honesty and an inner warmth that attracted him. There was something almost godlike in the clean lines of the body he had seen and in the face. These things coupled with what he already knew, intrigued him mightily and he resolved to approach this strange affair with an open mind and not play the role of the unbelieving cynic. It was time to go ahead.         *       *       *       *       *  John Pride said, \"First, are you aware that there is another in this mansion--or was?\"  \"I did not even know this was a mansion. It seems only one room.\"  \"It is an enormous structure set deep in the forest.\"  \"This other one--?\"  \"A very old man. He died as I arrived here tonight.\"  \"You do not know his name or how came he here?\"  \"I have a vague idea.\"  The young man's dazzling blue eyes narrowed in thought. \"A while ago you said you have wondered through the years as to what you would find in this room. That indicates you were aware of its existence.\"  \"True. Perhaps at this point I had better tell you the complete story--as much of it as I know.\"  \"I would be in your debt.\"  \"No, I will merely be discharging the last of a very old obligation.\"  With that, John Pride took from his pocket a small leather covered book. He handled it gently, almost with affection, and said, \"This was my father's notebook. In it, is an account of this remarkable affair, put down by my great grandfather and handed down through the line. When my father died he placed it in my hand saying it entailed an obligation both business and personal and it was my obligation as well as his.  \"I have read the account of what transpired many times and with your permission I will put it into my own words. Then, when I am done, I will give you the book and the affair will be over so far as I and my family are concerned.\"  John Pride had settled back in his chair and was just ready to begin when the young man held up a sudden hand. \"Just one moment--please,\" he said, and a look of concentration came upon his face. Then he went on and his words took the form of a rhyme:      \"An ape, a boar, a stallion,      A land beyond the stars.      A virgin's feast, a raging beast,      A prison without bars.\"  He flushed and added: \"I don't know why I was possessed to recite that doggerel at just this moment but there is something strange about it. Strange in that I have a feeling it was taught to me at some long distant time in the past. I sense that it is very important to whatever destiny awaits me. Yet I know not who taught me the verse nor what it means.\"  \"That verse is inscribed in this book and I believe I know how it entered your mind and memory. I believe too, that I understand how you are able to converse with me though you know nothing of this land or even this room,\" John Pride said quietly.  \"Then please tell me!\"  \"I think it better that I start at the beginning rather than give you the story piece-meal. That way, your mind will be better able to assimilate and to judge.\"  \"I await your pleasure,\" the young man said with impatience he strove to conceal.  \"Very well,\" John Pride said, his eyes growing vague with a far-away look.     CHAPTER IV  _John Pride's Story_   \"I am a member,\" John Pride began, \"of a firm called Pride, Conroy, and Wilson. We are a very old firm of private bankers with offices in Wall Street. Both Conroy and Wilson died before I was born, leaving no issue, so the company has been controlled by a Pride for many years.  \"This affair in which we are interested had its inception one hundred years ago. At that time, a man came to see my great grandfather in his office. He was a most remarkable man and gained my grandfather's respect and confidence from the very first. He never stated from whence he came, being more interested in the future than in the past. He put up at a New York City hotel and my great grandfather knew there were three in his party; the man himself, another man and a woman both somewhat older than he.  \"At one time when my great grandfather visited them in their hotel suite, he saw the woman fleetingly as she was leaving the room. She was carrying something that he thought"]]]
