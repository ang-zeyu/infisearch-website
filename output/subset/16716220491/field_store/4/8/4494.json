The reconnaissance party having returned on the 5th, the regiment, numbering 8 officers and 127 men, with 155 horses, started, on January 8, to march with General Sir Herbert Stewart's column across the desert to Gubat. This march, 336 miles, occupied from January 8 to February 20, 4 miles only being covered in the hour they were moving on the last date. They halted on the 13th at Gakdul; whereby the average day's journey works out at nearly 26 miles per day, or, if we ignore the march (4 miles in one hour) of January 20, at nearly 28 miles per day. The hardest day was the 16th, when the regiment travelled 40 miles in 11-1/2 hours, from 4.30 a.m. to 4 p.m., the horses receiving each half-a-gallon of water and 4 lbs. of food grain. Their ability to work on scanty diet was put to the test on this fortnight's march. The average daily ration for the first ten days was from 5 to 6 lbs. of grain and 2 gallons of water; the horses covering an average of 31 miles per day exclusive of the halt at Gakdul on the 13th.  When the final advance to the Nile was made, the horses went fifty-five hours with no water at all, and only 1 lb. of grain; some 15 or 20 horses were upwards of seventy hours without water. During their halt at Gubat from January 20 to February 14, they had received but one ration of grain, 6 lbs. given them two days before they had to start for the Nile. During this period they performed out-post and patrol duty averaging about 8 miles daily.  On the return march, the journey between Dongola and Wady Halfa, 250 miles, was performed on an average rate of 16 miles per day, with one two-days' halt. On this march the regiment usually travelled at night for the sake of coolness, but the scanty shade available generally compelled exposure to the hot sun all day.  Colonel Barrow remarks, \"I think it may be considered a most remarkable circumstance that out of 350 horses, during nine months on a hard campaign, only twelve died from disease.\" Colonel Biddulph sums up the work of the horses in a few words: \"The performance of the small Arab horses, both with the river and desert columns, carrying a heavy weight, on scanty fare and less water, is a marvel of endurance.\" The former officer attributes the small percentage of loss from disease to the facts (1) that the climate of the Soudan is most suitable for horses, (2) that the Syrian horse has a wonderful constitution, and is admirably suited for warfare in an Eastern climate. Colonel Barrow's opinion on the suitability of the Eastern climate for horses must not be read as meaning for horses of all breeds. On the contrary, Colonel Biddulph, in words quoted on a previous page, states that experience had shown that English horses could not withstand the conditions of campaigning in the Soudan.  Sir Richard Green Price, writing over the familiar pen-name of \"Borderer,\" in _Baily's Magazine_, has urged the formation of a regiment of Lilliputian horse, to consist of men under five feet, or five feet six inches, weighing not over eleven stone, of good chest measurement: these he would mount on ponies not over 14.2 and equip with light arms and accoutrements. As he points out, increase in our cavalry is an admitted necessity, and this branch of it in particular appeals to the common sense of the people as a quick and handy service:       \"After many years of practical experience of what ponies can      and do accomplish, especially well-bred ones hardily reared, I      do not hesitate to say that they will beat moderate horses of      double their size, and that very few of our present cavalry      horses could live with them in a campaign--they are more easily      taught, handled and mounted than bigger horses, and with twice      their constitution and thrice their sense--with riders to suit      them, where are the drawbacks to their employment?\"  Sir Richard, in brief, urges the creation of a regiment of scouts or mounted infantry whose horses shall be of much the same type of those described by Colonel Barrow.  The special correspondent of the _Times_ with the Modder River force, in course of an article on this arm, which appears likely to play a large part in the wars of the future, writes thus of the animals used by the Colonists and Boers:--       \"Here in South Africa the country-bred pony, tractable, used to      fire, and taught to remain where he is left if the reins be      dropped from the bit, is already a half-trained animal for      these purposes, and the work of training has been slight in      consequence; but in Afghanistan, and other places where the      mounted infantry man has been tried in a lesser degree, the      chief cause of trouble has been found in his mount.\"  The South African ponies ridden by the Colonial scouts and mounted infantry have acquired their education as shooting ponies on the veldt under conditions very similar to those prevailing in warfare. There is radical difference between animals so trained and ill-broken Indian country-breds whose tempers have been far too frequently spoiled by rough usage in native hands. The mounted infantry in Afghanistan might well find trouble with such ponies.    [Illustration: ONE OF REMINGTON'S HORSE.   _Showing type of horse used by mounted infantry and scouts in the South   African War._   (By permission of the Proprietors of the \"Daily Graphic.\")]     BURNABY'S RIDE TO KHIVA.   Captain Burnaby, in his well-known book, _A Ride to Khiva_, describes the animals brought up for his inspection at Kasala, in Turkestan, when his wish to buy a horse was made known:--       \"The horses were for the most part of the worst description,      that is to say, as far as appearance was concerned.... Except      for their excessive leanness, they looked more like huge      Newfoundland dogs than as connected with the equine race, and      had been turned out in the depth of winter with no other      covering save the thick coats which nature had given them....      At last, after rejecting a number of jades which looked more      fit to carry my boots than their wearer, I selected a little      black horse. He was about 14 hands in height, and I eventually      became his owner, saddle and bridle into the bargain, for the      sum of Â£5, this being considered a very high price at Kasala.\"  The reader may be reminded that the winter of 1876-7, during which Captain Burnaby accomplished his adventurous journey, was an exceptionally severe one even for that part of the world, where long and severe winters are the rule. On the day of his departure from Kasala the thermometer stood at eight degrees below zero. The traveller was by no means favourably impressed with the powers of the horse he had selected as the least bad of a very poor lot, and the native guides started apparently satisfied that it would break down under its heavy rider clad to resist the penetrating cold.  After his second march, Captain Burnaby began to acquire a certain measure of respect for this pony:--       \"What had surprised me most during our morning's march was the      extreme endurance of our horses. The guide frequently had been      obliged to dismount and to clean out their nostrils, which were      entirely stuffed with icicles; but the little animals had      ploughed their way steadily through the snow.... The one I      rode, which in England would not have been considered able to      carry my boots, was as fresh as possible after his march of      seventeen miles. In spite of the weight on his back--quite      twenty stone--he had never shown the least sign of fatigue.\"  Again, a few days later, the conditions of the journey having been no less trying:--       \"From Jana Darya we rode forty miles without a halt. I must say      that I was astonished to see how well the Kirghiz horses stood      the long journeys. We had now gone 300 miles; and my little      animal, in spite of his skeleton-like appearance, carried me      quite as well as the day he left Kasala, this probably being      owing to the change in his food from grass to barley. We are      apt to think very highly of English horses, and deservedly as      far as pace is concerned; but if it came to a question of      endurance, I much doubt whether our large and well fed horses      could compete with the little half-starved Kirghiz animals.      This is a subject which must be borne in mind in the event of      future complications in the East.\"  It is clear that Captain Burnaby was somewhat puzzled by the qualities displayed by a steed which looked so unpromising; he seeks to explain its performance by the better food it had enjoyed while on the march, and begins to compare the staying power of English horses with those of the Kirghiz pony with doubts as to the superiority of the former. At a later date he records without surprise that his party travelled forty miles in six hours, the horses having gone all the time at a slow steady trot. On his return journey, while staying at Petro-Alexandrovsk, he was given a mount on a little bay, hardly 14 hands high, for a day's hunting; and records that it \"danced about beneath me as if he had been carrying a feather-weight jockey for the Cambridgeshire.\" The Kirghiz and Bokharans who accompanied him evidently thought his weight would prove too much for the pony, and when there was a ditch to be jumped looked round to see how the bay would manage it. \"Never a stumble ... the hardy little beast could have carried Daniel Lambert if that worthy but obese gentleman had been resuscitated for the occasion.\"  Finally, Captain Burnaby sums up the performance of this fourteen-hand pony:--       \"We had ridden 371 miles in exactly nine days and two hours,      thus averaging more than 40 miles a day! At the same time it      must be remembered that, with an interval of in all not more      than nine days' rest, my horse had previously carried me 500      miles. In London, judging "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37842"],["title","Small Horses in Warfare (#2)"],["body","his size, he would have been put      down as a polo pony. In spite of the twenty stone he carried,      he had never been either sick or lame during the journey, and      had galloped the last 17 miles through the snow to Kasala in      one hour and twenty-five minutes.\"  The same author describes a remarkable forced march made in the summer of 1870 by Count Borkh in Russian Tartary. The Count's mission was to test the possibility of taking artillery over the steep and difficult passes in a certain district, and his force consisted of 150 cossacks, and 60 mounted riflemen and a gun. The troops accomplished their journey out and back, 266 miles, in six days; the heat was excessive, the thermometer marking sometimes as much as 117Â° Fahr. during the day; yet the ponies were none the worse of their exertions, the \"sick list\" at the end comprising only twelve, all of which suffered from sore backs caused by careless saddling. Other expeditions under similar conditions are mentioned; these go to prove that the endurance of the Tartar pony is affected as little by heat as by cold.     POST HORSES IN SIBERIA.   Mr. H. de Windt, in his book _From Pekin to Calais_, bears witness to the wonderful endurance of the small post-horses supplied to travellers in Siberia. He describes them as very little beasts ranging from 14.2 to 15 hands. \"Though rough and ungroomed, they are well fed, as they need to be, for a rest of only six hours is allowed between stages.\" The speed maintained depends upon the condition of the roads; and the number of horses furnished for each tarantass is regulated by the same factor; three horses sufficing in good weather and as many as seven being required when the roads are heavy from rain or snow.     PONIES IN INDIA.   Captain L. E. Nolan, in _Cavalry History and Tactics_ (1860), gives an account of an experimental march made by 200 of the 15th Hussars from Bangalore to Hyderabad and back, 800 miles. The objects of the march were to test the capabilities of the troop horses and to ascertain if there were anything to choose between stallions and geldings in respect of endurance. To arrive at a solution of the latter question, one hundred of the men were mounted on entires and the other hundred on horses which had been castrated only six months previously, regardless of age, for the purpose of making the experiment.  The squadrons marched to their destination, took part in field-days and pageants, and started to reach Bangalore by forced marches; they accomplished the last 180 miles at a rate of thirty miles per day, bringing in only one led horse, the remainder being perfectly sound and fit for further work. One horse, a 14.3 Persian, carried a corporal who, with his accoutrements, rode 22 stone 7 lbs. It may be added that there was nothing to choose between the performances of the stallions and geldings; though the fact that the latter had so recently been castrated was held to make their achievement the more creditable.  A forced march such as this has far more value as testimony to staying power than a more trying feat performed by a single animal; but mention must be made of Captain Horne's ride. This officer, who belonged to the Madras Horse Artillery, undertook in 1841 to ride his grey Arab, \"Jumping Jimmy,\" 400 miles in five days on the Bangalore race-course; and accomplished his task with three hours and five minutes to spare, the horse doing the last 79 miles 5 furlongs in 19 hours 55 minutes, and being quite ready for his corn when pulled up. General Tweedie, in his work on _The Arabian Horse_ (1894), quotes the above particulars from the _Bengal Sporting Magazine_, in whose pages full details are given.  Captain Nolan, in the work from which quotation has been made above, sums up the shortcomings of the cavalry trooper of his day in the following pithy sentences:--       \"Our cavalry horses are feeble; they measure high, but they do      so from length of limb, which is weakness, not power. The blood      they require is not that of our weedy race-horse (an animal      more akin to the greyhound and bred for speed alone), but it is      the blood of the Arab and Persian, to give them that compact      form and wiry limb in which they are wanting.\"  The great value of the pony in India was insisted on by Mr. J. H. B. Hallen, formerly the General Superintendent of the Horse Breeding Department, in a memorandum published at Meerut in 1899. Pointing out the many spheres of utility open to the pony, he urged the local authorities and agricultural societies to foster and develop pony breeding by providing suitable stallions for public use. As proving the value of the pony, Mr. Hallen points out that in the two-wheeled cart called an _ekka_, used by the natives of Northern India, a pony will draw a load of from 4-1/2 to 6 cwt. over long distances at a rate of 5 or 6 miles an hour.  Ponies all over India are equally in request for riding and driving, and in the northern parts for pack purposes. Indeed, adds Mr. Hallen, \"the pony may be said to be all round the most useful animal.\" The supply is not equal to the demand.  Captain H. L. Powell, R.H.A., writing in _Baily's Magazine_ of March, 1900, says:--       \"I am a great believer in the Arab for officers' chargers,      light cavalry and mounted infantry in this campaign. The Arab      is a hardy little beast, and will thrive and do well on what      would be starvation rations for an ordinary troop-horse. As a      rule the Arab is rather light of bone, but his bone is twice as      strong as that of an underbred horse. I have an Arab pony about      14.2 which I am looking after for his owner who went out to the      war, and who is now, I am sorry to say, enjoying Mr. Kruger's      hospitality in Pretoria. The pony carries my 15 stone as if it      was a feather, and never seems to tire.\"  The superiority of the Arab over the Indian country-bred is reflected in their respective cost. Mr. Hallen, in the memorandum before referred to, says stallions of the country-bred class can be obtained at from about Â£6 10s. to Â£13, while suitable Arab pony stallions cost from Â£16 10s. to Â£33.     PONIES IN NORTHERN AFRICA.[2]   The best authority on the breeds used by the Arabs of Northern Africa is probably General E. Daumas, who held high commands in Algeria and was for a time the French Consul at Mascara. The Chasseurs d'Afrique are mounted on Barbs, and thus the capabilities of these horses were of practical importance to this officer; moreover, he took a very keen personal interest in all matters relating to the horse, and spared no endeavour to inform himself concerning the breed of the country in which he resided. Hence the description in General Daumas' book, _The Horses of the Sahara: with Commentaries by the Emir Abd El Kadr_ (1863) is accepted as the standard on the Barb.  [2] The Barb, there is no possible doubt, is of pure Arab origin: in the seventh century, when the Fatimite sect of Mohammedans held sway in Egypt, numerous Arab tribes migrated to Africa and gradually spread over the whole of the northern portion of the continent; the horses they brought with them spread in like manner.  The letters of the famous Emir to General Daumas, containing categorical replies to questions put by the latter, show that the Barbs possess endurance in a very remarkable degree. Their average height is nowhere mentioned in this work, but they are, as we believe, somewhat smaller than the Arab in his native country and in India. There is a suggestive hint of their small size in a remark by General Daumas: he says that inexperienced horsemen with their spurs \"sometimes prick the animal on the knee-pan and so lame him if the wound be deep.\" Assuming that the average height of the horseman be 5 feet 6 inches, and making due allowance for the \"straight-legged\" seat of the cavalry man, the General's remark points to a horse certainly not over 14 hands.  In answer to General Daumas' enquiry as to the amount of work a Barb can do, the Emir replies:--       \"A horse sound in every limb and eating as much barley as his      stomach can contain can do whatever his rider can ask of him.      For this reason the Arabs say, 'give barley and over-work him,'      but without tasking him over much a horse can be made to do      about sixteen _parasangs_ (equal to about fifty English miles)      a day, day after day. It is the distance from Mascara to      Koudiat Aghelizan on the Oued-Mina: it has been measured in      cubits. A horse performing this journey every day, and having      as much barley as it likes to eat, can go on without fatigue      for three or four months without lying by a single day.\"  The Arabs on their _razzias_, or cattle-stealing expeditions, of necessity travel with as little encumbrance as possible: on such expeditions, which may require twenty or twenty-five days' rapid travel, each horseman carries only enough barley to give his mount eight feeds. In some parts of the Sahara green food is never given; frequent watering is recommended by all Arab horsemen.  An Arab of the ArbÃ¢a tribe gave General Daumas full particulars of a ride he once undertook to save a highly prized mare from the hands of the Turks. In twenty-four hours he rode her eighty leagues, and during the journey she obtained nothing to eat but leaves of the dwarf palm, and was watered once.  More directly bearing on our present enquiry are the particulars furnished by Colonel Duringer of the weights carried in most of the expeditions by the horses of the Chasseurs d'Afrique. These details were ascertained by the Colonel at the moment of departure of a column:--Horseman, 180 lbs.; equipment, 53 lbs.; pressed hay for five days, 55 lbs.; barley for same period, 44 lbs. The man's own provisions brought up the total burden to about 350 lbs. English = 25 stone! Daily consumption of hay and grain would reduce this colossal burden gradually; but the horse would never carry less than"]]]
