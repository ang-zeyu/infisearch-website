Yonder is a hornet, just alighted at the foot of the old oak-tree where I am writing, so uncomfortably near my nose, indeed, that I can't help wishing he had kept to his nest for another month; but the same April sunshine that lured me out of doors lured the hornet, and there it stands, all a-quiver with delight, on a budding acorn, looking every moment as if it would part amidships.  \"Do you think, Mrs Hornet, O thou tigress of bees, if your lovely body, with its bars of gold, had been of any other colour, that, under the peculiar conditions in which your ancestors lived, you would, ages ago, have ceased to exist; that ants, or other `crawling ferlies,' who detest the colour of turmeric, would, in spite of your ugly sting, have devoured you and yours?\"  Yonder, again, is a beautiful chaffinch; he was very glad to come to my lawn-window every day, during all the weary winter, to beg a crumb of bread.  He forgets that now, or thinks perhaps that I do not know him in his spring suit of clothes, and golden-braided coat and vest.  But I do, and I still believe--simple though the belief may be--that the same Being, who gave life and motion to that little beetle which is now making its way to the highest pinnacle of my note-book, as proud as a boy with a new kite, to try its wings for the first time, tipped that ungrateful finch's feathers with crimson, white, and gold, in order to make him more attractive to his little dowdy thing of a wife, who has been so busy all the morning building her nest on the silver birch, and trying to find lichens to match the colour of the tree.  For Mrs Finch is a nervous, timid little body, and had no thoughts of marrying at all, and indeed would have preferred to remain single, and would have so remained, had she not been a female; but being a female, how could she resist that splendid uniform?  I go into the garden and bend me over the crocus beds--white crocuses, orange crocuses, and blue, all smiling in the sunshine of spring.  Each is a little family in itself, and they would like to know each other too so very much, for they have ever so many love tales to breathe into each other's ears.  But they are all fast by one end and cannot move. Whatever shall they do, and what will become of the next generation of crocuses?  I can hear them whispering their tales of love to the passing wind, and so can you if you are a lover of Nature; but the wind is too busy, or too light, or too something or another, and cannot pause to listen.  So the little things are all in despair, when past comes a bee. Now bees, and butterflies too, for all they have got so many eyes, are rather short-sighted, but even a bee cannot help seeing that gorgeous display of orange, white, and blue, so he pops at once into the bosom of a blue crocus, and is made as welcome as the flowers in May.  \"Oh! you dear old bee,\" says the crocus, \"you're just come in time; have something to eat first.  I have a nice little store of honey for you; and then you shall bear a message to my lady-love--the pretty blue belle crocus mind, not the white.  I wouldn't have a race of variegated children for the world.\"  \"All right,\" says the bee, and away he flies with the message of love to the blue belle crocus, and thus the loves of the crocuses are cemented. They tell the old, old story by proxy, because they can't do it as you or I do, reader, eye to eye and lip to lip.  For colour has its uses, and nothing that exists was made in vain, although some are selfish enough to believe that all the colour and beauty they see around them, during a ramble in the country, was made but to please the eye of man.  Colour I believe to be connected in some way with the mystery of heat and life.  We all know that certain colours will dispel or retain heat; black is more warm, for instance, than white.  There may be, then, a _scale_ of colours as it were, each colour differing in the amount of heat-retaining power; and, it may be that, having reference to this scale, the colours on an animal's coat, are apportioned to it in the way which shall best conduce to its health, comfort, and happiness.  The colour of any animal is an important consideration in determining its breed, and this is especially the case among cats, where indeed it forms the basis of our classification.  Colour is often the key to the character of the cat--to its temper, whether savage or good-natured; to its qualities as a good hunter or the reverse; and to its power of endurance, its eyesight, and its hearing.  _Size_.--Cats of different breeds--I use the word for want of a better-- are generally of different sizes, and the skeleton is, as a rule, larger in some breeds than in others.  The male ought to be larger than the female.  _Form_.--The difference in form is principally observable in the shape and rotundity of skull, the length and shape of the nasal bones and jaw, and the length of the tail and its form at the point.  The ears also vary a good deal in length in the different breeds, and also in breadth, and in \"sit\" or position.  _Pelage, or Coat_.--The coat is of two different kinds, the long and the short.  In the former, the longer and softer and silkier the better, and in the latter the length of the hairs, their closeness and glossiness, are to be taken into consideration.  You can generally tell by one glance at the animal's coat how she is fed, how she is treated and housed, and the condition of her health.  Having got so far, we will next bring pussy herself on the stage, and see how far these remarks apply to her, according to her breed and species.  CHAPTER TWO.  BREEDS AND CLASSES.  In future chapters I will give the habits and characteristics of the domestic cat in general, with some specialities of a few of the different kinds in particular.  The \"tricks and manners\" of one cat, however, will be found to correspond pretty closely with those of any other.  But before going farther on with this chapter, I wish to make a plea in pussy's favour.  I myself have studied cat life, off and on, for twenty years, so I suppose it will be admitted I am no mean authority on the subject.  During that time I have come to certain conclusions, which in some cases run contrary to the opinions generally conceived of those animals--contrary, at any rate, to the belief current some years ago, before pussy was thought worthy to hold a show of her own.  Towards this ocean of contrary opinions I have been wafted, not by the wind of my own sails alone, but aided and supported by many hundreds of anecdotes of domestic pussy's daily life, habits, likes and dislikes.  These anecdotes have been supplied to me from trustworthy people, in every position of life--from the poverty-stricken old maid with her one feline favourite; from the honest working-man with his fireside pet and children's playmate; from farmers, solicitors, doctors, and parsons; from baronets' ladies; and, in more than one instance, from the daughters of peers of the realm, allied to royalty itself.  These anecdotes have, in almost every case, been substantially authenticated, and _always_ discarded wherever, in any case, they were open to doubt.  From these anecdotes and essays, and from my own experience as well, I have arrived at the following conclusions--and be it remembered I speak of cats that are properly fed and housed, and have been taught habits of cleanliness when kittens:--  1.  That cats are extremely sagacious.  2 That cats are cleanly and regular in their habits.  3.  That cats are fond of children.  4.  That cats are excellent mothers, and will nurse the young of any small animal on the loss of their own.  5.  That cats are fond of roaming abroad.  6.  That cats are brave to a fault.  7.  That cats are fond of other animals as playmates.  8.  That cats are easily taught tricks.  9.  That cats are excellent hunters.  10.  That cats are good fishers, and can swim on occasion.  11.  That cats are very tenacious of life.  12.  That cats are fond of home.  13.  That cats are _fonder far of master or mistress_.  14.  That cats are _not_, as a rule, _thieves, but the reverse_.  15.  That long-headed, sharp-nosed cats are the best mousers.  These are not texts, but deductions.  All that is known for certain of the origin of the domestic cat may be expressed in three letters, _n i l_--nil.  And, after all, I cannot see that it matters very much, for if the theory of Darwin be correct, that everything living sprang originally from the primordial cell, then cats or dogs, or human beings, we all had the same origin.  But, again, according to Darwin, the cat is an older animal than man in the world's history; and if this be so, how silly of us to bother our heads in trying to find out who first domesticated the cat, when in all probability _it was the cat who first domesticated man_.  But, avaunt! all learned discourse on the subject; perish all discursive lore.  I have studied the matter over and over again, and read about it in languages dead and living, till my head ached, and my heart was sick; and still, for the life of me, I cannot make out that there are any more than two distinct _species_ of domestic cats in existence.  There are, first, the European or Western cat, a short-haired animal; and secondly, the Asiatic or Eastern cat--called also Persian or Angora, according to the difference in the texture of the coat, it being exceedingly fine, soft, and satiny in the Angora, and not so much so in the Persian--a long-haired cat.  All the others, such as Assyrian, Abyssinian, the Maltese, Russian, Chinese, Italian, French, Turkish, etc, are either inter-breeds between the two, or lineal descendants of the one or the other, altered and modified by climate and mode of life.  Taking everything into consideration, I am inclined to favour the belief held by some, that our own fireside cat was first domesticated from our mountain wild cat.  I mentioned, this to a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],["title","The Domestic Cat (#2)"],["body"," of some repute, with whom I was dining only a few days ago.  \"_What_?\" he roared, trying to get across the table, in order to jump down my throat.  \"_You_ ought to know, sir, that all animals increase, instead of degenerating in size, by being transplanted to domestic life.\"  I didn't contradict the man in his own house; but indeed, reader, the rule, if rule it be, admits of numerous exceptions.  It holds good among horses, and I suppose cattle of all kinds; it even holds good if we go down the scale of organic life, and apply it to fruit and flowers; but how about the wilder animals, and our forest trees?  Take the latter first--will the acorns of a garden-grown oak-tree, or the cone of a transplanted Scotch pine, produce such noble specimens as those that toss their giant arms in the forest or on mountain-side?  Or will a menagerie-bred lion, or tiger--feed them ever so well--ever reach the noble proportions of those animals who in freedom tread the African desert, or roam uncaged and untrammelled through the jungles of Eastern India?  What prison-born elephant ever reached in height to the shoulders even, of the gigantic bulls that my poor friend, Gordon Cumming, used to slay?  Do eagles, owls, the wilder hawks, alligators, or anacondas do anything else but degenerate in captivity?  But even admitting, hypothetically, that the rule would hold good as regards cats, there isn't such a very great difference in the size of the tame and wild cats after all.  I do not think that all the wild cats ever I saw in Scotland or elsewhere, would average over ten to twelve pounds; and twelve pounds is no unusual weight for our domestic cheety.  Another thing that has often struck me is this: the farther north you go in Scotland, and the nearer to the abode of the wild cat, the greater is the resemblance in head and tail, and often in colour, of the tame cat to the wild.  And, mark you, the domestic is often known to inter-breed with the wild cat, and the offspring can be tamed and reared.  This is considered nothing unusual in the Highlands.  CHAPTER THREE.  BREEDS AND CLASSES.  THE TORTOISESHELL.  The classification I propose of the domestic cat is an exceedingly simple one, as I think all classifications ought to be; it will, I trust, however, be found quite sufficient, and a useful one.  We have first, then, the two and only two distinct breeds mentioned above, viz:--One.  The European Cat.  Two.  The Asiatic.  From these two alone, if you get them of different colours, you can very easily manufacture all the varieties and various-coloured pussies you are ever likely to meet with, either on the show-benches or in domestic life.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  ONE.  The European, short-haired, or Western Cats.  These I divide into five primary classes, namely--1, _Tortoiseshell_; 2, _Black_; 3, _White_; 4, _Blue_ or _Slate-colour_; and 5, the _Tabbies_.  The _Tortoiseshell_ I subdivide into secondary classes: 1, the pure Tortoiseshell; and 2, the Tortoiseshell-and-white.  The _Black_ is subdivided likewise into two: 1, pure Black; and 2, Black-and-white.  The _White_ has no subdivision, but is bred in with any or all the other classes.  The _Blue_ or _Slate-coloured Cat_.  These are subdivided into two: 1, the pure Blue; and 2, the Blue-and-white.  _Tabbies_ are easily subdivided into four classes, viz:--1, the Red Tabby; 2, the Brown Tabby; 3, the Blue or Silver Tabby; and 4, the Spotted Tabby.  There are other odd cats, such as the Manx or tailless cat, the hybrid, the six-clawed cat, and some curiously-coloured animals, which I shall mention in another place, for these have no right to have classes of their own, any more than black-and-tan Newfoundlands, or kittens with eight legs.  I shall take these in their order of rotation.  1.  _The Tortoiseshell Cat_.--This might also be called the black-and-tan cat.  If you want to get a good idea of the colour this cat is, or ought to be, take a keek through a lady's tortoiseshell back-hair comb.  That is about it; but you never see such perfection in pussy's coat.  For many a long year it was almost universally believed that there never was any such thing as a tortoiseshell male or Tom cat, or ever could be; and many an anxious search has many an old maid had over her newly-born litter of kits, to see if she would be fortunate enough to find the much-to-be-desired anomaly.  For, bear in mind, a belief used to be pretty current that 300 pounds--or was it 500 pounds?--would be paid over some counter, by some fool or fools unknown, to anyone who should be able to put the possibility of the existence of a tortoiseshell Tom beyond dispute--by producing one.  I saw an advertisement the other day in _The Live Stock Journal_, offering for sale a tortoiseshell Tom, at the low price of 100 pounds!  I hope, if only for poor Tom's sake, that somebody with more money than brains bought it--for the cat anyone paid 100 pounds for would, I should think, be certain of good milk and generous treatment.  I knew a poor old woman in Skye, and this old woman's pussy was as pussies love to be.  And lo! one night the old woman, in the silence of night, dreamed a dream.  She thought that the cat came to her bedside, and said to her, \"Arise, mistress, come and see.\"  That she followed pussy at once.  That pussy led her to the barn.  That there she found, cuddled together in a heap upon an old sack, no less than five tortoiseshell Toms.  She dreamt besides that she sold the lot for 1,000 pounds each, and bought a carriage and four, right off the reel, and set up for a lady of fashion on the spot.  Anxiously did the old woman watch for her cattie's accouchement, but much to her disappointment they all had white about them.  Next time that pussy was in the same way, her mistress had an old tortoiseshell comb nailed up above its bed.  Even this didn't do, so--for by this time the ancient dame had tortoiseshell Tom on the brain--she set out for Portree, a distance of fully sixteen miles, where she managed to procure a live tortoise as a playmate for her pet.  Pussy never took much to the tortoise; all she did was to sit and watch it, and whenever it protruded its scaly head, the cat smacked it in again.  This might have been the reason why her kittens had all white about them the third time.  The old woman didn't despair, however; she took to praying, and prayed in English, and prayed in Gaelic, and she told me seriously that she never doubted but that her prayers would one day be answered--_if_, she added, _it was for her good_.  I didn't doubt it either, but Tom never came ashore as long as I was in the island, neither was the old creature's snuff-box ever empty.  I have but little fancy for this breed myself.  They are usually sour-tempered, unfriendly little things to all save those who own and love them.  They are, moreover, not very prepossessing.  I speak of the cat as _I_ have found it, and I doubt not there are many exceptions.  _Merits_.--They are excellent and patient mousers, and the _best_ of hunters.  They are likewise good mothers.  They are as game as a bull and terrier--in fact they seem to fear nothing on four legs; and when they do take off the gloves to fight, I pity the animal they tackle, for what the tortoiseshell lacks in weight, she makes up for amply in courage.  They are very wise and sagacious, and faithful to the death to those who own them.  _Points_.--1.  _Size_: You don't look for a very large cat of the pure tortoiseshell breed, nor a very pretty one.  The larger the better to a certain extent.  I have known a small-sized tortoiseshell cat follow the rats even into their own burrows, again and again, until she had exterminated them. 2.  _Head_: The head is small and rather bullety, the ears moderately large and nicely cocked, and the eyes small, and the darker the better. 3.  _Colour and markings_: The colour is as near tortoiseshell as possible, and the markings must not only be deep and pretty, but very distinct in the centre, although blending insensibly where they meet, and artistically arranged.  You mustn't expect to find the colour or markings very nicely arranged on the male tortoiseshell. No white is allowed on this breed of cat.  Tortoiseshell Tom _is_ tortoiseshell Tom, and prefers to be judged alone and on his own merits; for, as a rule, his right there is none to dispute. 4.  _Pelage_ or _Coat_: Hair moderately short, but _very_ fine, glossy, and silken. N.B.--Knock off from five to eight points for _cinder-holes_.  I now give the points in a tabular form, with their full value.  Not, remember, that as a rule I go in for judging by points; still, a table of this sort has its value, as one can see just at a glance what is looked for in each breed, and what isn't:--  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Points of the Tortoiseshell Cat.  1.  Size, 5.  2.  Head, 10.  3.  Colour and markings, 25.  4.  Pelage, 10.  Total, 50.  The next pussy which demands a few passing remarks is _The Tortoiseshell-and-white_.  This is often a very beautiful cat, more especially when young, as, when old, they sometimes degenerate into very lazy habits, especially if they have a large amount of white about them. They are pretty, and they seem to know it, taking great delight in keeping the white portions of their fur as pure as snow.  I knew a cat something of this breed, who was nearly all white, excepting a beautiful tortoiseshell patch on the upper part of one thigh.  She was unexceptionably cleanly, and the frantic efforts she used to make to wash off that spot of black-and-amber were ridiculous to behold.  She would sit for hours admiring herself in the glass, and occasionally dipping her paw in her saucer of milk, until she spied that unhappy spot; to that she would at once devote a good half-hour, but finding no appreciable difference in it, she would start away in high dudgeon, swishing her"]]]
