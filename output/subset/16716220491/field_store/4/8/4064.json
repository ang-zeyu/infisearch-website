Passage to the north and northeast by _jucundus_ is at least partly blocked by inhospitable mountainous country; the resulting semi-isolation may be one reason for the distinctive characteristics of _jucundus_ compared with those of _bullatus_ and _ustulatus_. Two specimens from Monclova, assigned to _tamaulipensis_ by Nelson and Goldman (op. cit.:142), are here referred to _jucundus_ on the basis of cranial characters and size.  Specimens were trapped in fallow irrigated fields in the vicinity of Monclova. Others were taken in deep soils in desert flats.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 19, from: Hermanas, 1205 ft., 9; _1 mi. S Hermanas_, 2; 1 mi. N and 13 mi. E Cuatro Ciénegas, 2; 5 mi. N and 2 mi. W Monclova, 1; _2 mi. N and 1 mi. E Monclova_, 1; Monclova, 2 (BSC); Hisachalo [= Huisachalo], 2.    +Cratogeomys castanops sordidulus+ new subspecies   _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 56614, Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; 1.5 mi. NW Ocampo, 3300 ft., Coahuila; 16 December 1953; obtained by Robert W. Dickerman, original number 2164.  _Distribution._--Desert plains of north-central Coahuila, surrounded for the most part by higher mountainous country (see fig. 1).  _Diagnosis._--Body large for species (see tables 1 and 2); tail short; hind foot large; upper parts Ochraceous-Buff (in summer pelage) and Orange-Buff (in fresh winter pelage); underparts Pale Ochraceous-Salmon; skull medium in size and narrow; zygomata narrow; rostrum narrow; palate short; nasals medium in length; basioccipital small and narrow; mastoid bullae not greatly inflated; tympanic bullae inflated; incisors small; maxillary teeth small.  _Comparisons._--From _Cratogeomys castanops jucundus_, found beyond the mountains to the southeast, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body smaller; tail shorter; hind foot slightly smaller; upper parts darker, more ochraceous and less yellowish, with plumbeous bases of hairs more conspicuous; underparts darker, more buffy and less whitish; skull slightly shorter, more nearly flat, and narrower; zygomata less widely flaring; rostrum narrower; mastoid bullae less inflated; incisors and maxillary teeth slightly smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops excelsus_, found to the south and southwest, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body slightly smaller; tail shorter; hind foot slightly larger; upper parts darker, more ochraceous and less pinkish-buff; underparts darker, more buffy and less whitish; skull smaller and narrower; zygomata less widely flaring; sides more nearly parallel and not expanded anteriorly; palate shorter; rostrum narrower and, in relation to greatest length of skull, longer; tympanic bullae slightly more inflated; incisors and maxillary teeth smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops consitus_, found to the north and west, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body larger; hind foot larger; upper parts paler, more ochraceous and less rufous; skull decidedly larger and wider; zygomata more widely flaring; palate and nasals longer; rostrum broader; mastoid bullae and tympanic bullae larger; maxillary teeth smaller. From topotypes of _Cratogeomys castanops clarkii_ (Baird), found to the northwest, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body larger; tail shorter; upper parts, in winter pelage, paler, more ochraceous and less dark-rufous; skull slightly smaller and narrower; rostrum narrower; nasals slightly shorter; sides of basioccipital more nearly parallel instead of wedge-shaped; mastoid bullae less inflated; incisor and maxillary teeth smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops convexus_, found to the northeast, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body larger; tail shorter; upper parts slightly darker, more ochraceous and less buffy; skull narrower; zygomata more nearly parallel and less expanded anteriorly; rostrum narrower and longer; nasals longer; squamosal breadth greater; mastoid bullae less inflated; maxillary teeth smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops bullatus_, found to the east, _sordidulus_ differs in: Body larger; hind foot larger; upper parts darker, more ochraceous and less buffy; skull larger in all respects; zygomata more widely flaring; tympanic bullae less inflated; maxillary teeth larger.  _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys castanops sordidulus_ is limited to the Llano de Ocampo, an elevated, desert plain surrounded on three sides, west, south and east, by higher mountainous country which seems to bar the passage of this rodent. On the eastern side this barrier extends north to the very banks of the Río Grande in the Cañon de Boquillas. This subspecies, therefore, is in contact with other populations of _Cratogeomys_ only to the north and northwest. This subspecies is well characterized by size, color and cranial characteristics.  _Cratogeomys castanops sordidulus_ is not abundant; groups of mounds constructed by one or a few individuals were found in widely separated places. Mounds were often small, appeared old and, in other ways, were inconspicuous on arid flats. The animals were taken at elevations as low as 3250 feet and as high as 4150 feet.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 13, from: 50 mi. N and 20 mi. W Ocampo, 4150 ft., 1; 18 mi. S and 14 mi. E Tanque Alvarez, 4000 ft., 4; 1-1/2 mi. NW Ocampo, 3300 ft., 6; _Ocampo_, 1; 5 mi. N and 19 mi.

Washington, 47:140, June 13, type from Gallego, 5500 ft., Chihuahua.  _Distribution._--Arid high plains from central Chihuahua, east and southeast at least into northwestern Coahuila (see fig. 1).  _Comparisons._--From _Cratogeomys castanops lacrimalis_ Nelson and Goldman, specimens from Boquillas and Marathon north of the Río Grande in Texas, _consitus_ differs in: Body smaller; tail and hind foot shorter; upper parts paler, more light buffy and less rufous; underparts paler, light buffy instead of dark buffy; skull decidedly smaller; zygomata slightly less widely flaring; palate especially shorter; rostrum narrower; squamosal breadth less; incisors smaller. From topotypes of _Cratogeomys castanops clarkii_, found to the north along the Río Grande, _consitus_ differs in: Body smaller; tail and hind foot shorter; upper parts paler, more buffy and less rufous; skull markedly smaller, especially in palate and nasals; zygomata less widely flaring; tympanic bullae more inflated; mastoid bullae less inflated; basioccipital parallel-sided as opposed to wedge-shaped. From _Cratogeomys castanops convexus_, found to the east, _consitus_ differs in: Body smaller; tail and hind foot shorter; upper parts paler, more buffy and less ochraceous; underparts paler, white or light buffy instead of pale ochraceous; skull smaller; zygomata less widely flaring; palate shorter; rostrum decidedly narrower and, relative to length of skull, longer; squamosal breadth less; incisors smaller. From _Cratogeomys castanops excelsus_, found to the south, _consitus_ differs in: Size smaller; tail and hind foot shorter; upper parts darker, more rufous and less pinkish-buff; skull conspicuously smaller, especially in palate, rostrum, and nasals; zygomata less widely flaring; mastoid bullae and tympanic bullae more inflated; incisors smaller; maxillary teeth relatively larger. For comparison of _consitus_ with _Cratogeomys castanops sordidulus_, see previous account.   _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys castanops consitus_ is a small pocket gopher (see tables 1 and 2); the largest adult available to us is much smaller than the smallest adult of any adjacent subspecies. Specimens from Coahuila assigned to _consitus_ compare favorably with topotypes although those from the vicinity of Jaco are smaller, paler and have a narrower rostrum and smaller maxillary teeth. An immature male trapped three miles northeast of Sierra Mojada is tentatively assigned to _consitus_. This subspecies seems to be rare in northwestern Coahuila and small colonies are widely scattered.  _Cratogeomys castanops clarkii_ (Baird) may occur along the Río Grande in extreme northwestern Coahuila. No specimens are known from Coahuila, and none was found in the vicinity of Boquillas, Coahuila, in 1952.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 8, from: 3 mi. N and 9 mi. E El Pino, 1; 6 mi. E Jaco, Chihuahua, _in_ Coahuila, 6; 3 mi. NE Sierra Mojada, 1.    +Cratogeomys castanops excelsus+ Nelson and Goldman   1934. _Cratogeomys castanops excelsus_ Nelson and Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 47:143, June 13, type from San Pedro, 10 mi. W Laguna de Mayrán, Coahuila.  _Distribution._--Desert plains of southwestern Coahuila and northeastern Durango (see fig. 1).  _Comparisons._--_Cratogeomys castanops excelsus_ is characterized by large size and pale color; it is the palest subspecies of _C. castanops_. Of adjacent subspecies, excelsus most closely resembles _C. c. subsimus_ which occurs to the east and resembles least _C. c. consitus_, which occurs to the northwest.  From _Cratogeomys castanops subsimus_, found to the east, _excelsus_ differs in: Body averaging slightly larger; tail and hind foot shorter; upper parts paler, more light buffy and less yellowish; skull smaller; palate especially shorter; rostrum narrower; nasals shorter; incisors slightly smaller; maxillary tooth-row shorter. Compared with topotypes of _C. c. goldmani_, found to the south, _excelsus_ differs in: Body larger; hind foot smaller; upper parts in winter pelage paler, more buffy and less rufous; skull larger; zygomata more widely flaring; rostrum broader; nasals shorter; tympanic bullae larger and more inflated; maxillary teeth larger.  Specimens of _excelsus_ from the vicinity of Torreón, in southwestern Coahuila, are slightly smaller in cranial dimensions than more typical examples of the subspecies. In small size, at least, these specimens show some resemblance to _goldmani_ to the south. The range of _excelsus_ approaches that of _C. c. consitus_ in west-central Coahuila (see"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32637"],["title","The Envoy, Her (#1)"],["body","aside when he rose. With some difficulty, Vyrtl kept his eyes front as he strode from the hall with Wilkins and his personal guards at his heels. He hastened to his own chambers for a bath and change of clothes.  He allowed himself to be bathed, scented, and dressed in the most imperial costume he had brought from Hebryxid. Blonde Xota, his official favorite who had taken no chance of losing her place by absence from his side, admired his dazzling jewels and scarlet silks extravagantly. Vyrtl permitted her to serve him a light lunch, paying little attention to her chatter.  Once, when he had taken her from the Co-ordinator of his sixth planet, he had fancied himself in love with her; now he merely amused himself guessing from day to day to whom she sold her supposed influence. He sometimes wondered if any wife he owned were innocent of spying.  He rose, summoned Wilkins, and led a small procession to the council chamber. They found the necessary quota of high officers waiting. Daphne Foster was summoned.  Vyrtl took his place on a dais at the head of the table, and his aide arranged the gold-stiffened ceremonial robe. The generals made little professional jokes, each striving to act as if the victory had been mostly his own doing. Even the lean Chief of Staff, Tzyfol, looked satiated.  The Jursan envoy was announced.         *       *       *       *       *  Once again, Vyrtl was so fascinated by the girl that he paid scant heed to the ceremonious greetings. He decided she was younger than he had thought earlier.  Finally, the conference got down to business.  \"My people,\" said Daphne Foster, \"ask but a few minor concessions, which we believe will benefit the remainder of the Empire as much as Jursa.\"  \"We are disposed to believe your good intentions,\" said Vyrtl encouragingly.  He caught himself smiling, and immediately resumed the mask of dignity.  The Jursans, it developed, would give up demands for autonomy and resume allegiance to the Empire. They pleaded, however, for freedom of scientific research, promising that their discoveries would be placed promptly at Vyrtl's disposal.  In the matter of indemnities, they were willing, Daphne Foster said with an intimate glance for Vyrtl alone, to rely upon his generosity. They asked only that they be allowed a reasonable time to restore the damage suffered in the fighting and that they be permitted to make part of the payments in the technical equipment they were so skilled at manufacturing.  Some of the officers raised objections that Vyrtl thought well-put, but he overruled them. The main point, he pronounced, was to restore a valuable possession to productivity. There would be no looting and destruction.  He felt less sure of himself when old Tzyfol protested that free research was one of the roots of the trouble. Consequently, perhaps, the imperial glare that silenced the Marshal was the more withering.  After that, Vyrtl sat back and allowed his cohorts to promulgate a number of minor, harassing conditions. These would satisfy their egos to some degree, keep the Jursans aware of the folly of questioning his authority again, and show their envoy how things might have gone had Vyrtl not been merciful.  In the end, he added one condition of his own.  \"It will be necessary,\" he said, \"to hold frequent conferences on these affairs. If the Jursan Council should appoint their envoy as permanent ambassador to our court, we should be inclined to approve.\"  It was tantamount to a command, but the girl showed no resentment. Not that Vyrtl expected anything so rash as outward reluctance--but a lifetime of piercing the flattery of courtiers had made him a shrewd reader of facial expressions.  He granted permission for an immediate broadcasting of the treaty, overriding Tzyfol's desire for deeper consideration in favor of Daphne Foster's plea that delay would cost lives.  After having copies of the rather simple document drawn up for the facsimile broadcasters, Vyrtl gave her leave to depart. Without seeming to watch, he admired her gait as she walked from the conference chamber.         *       *       *       *       *  Afterwards, he left the generals to their post-mortem and retired with Wilkins to a private balcony for a bottle of wine.  \"How did it go?\" he asked, leaning back more comfortably when his aide had removed the heavy robe.  \"You were most generous, Sire, or so I thought.\"  \"It is a virtue that requires a public display now and then, to strengthen the roots of the myth that grows from it. Too bad old Tzyfol failed to see that. Why do you suppose he tried to be obstinate?\"  \"I expect, Sire, he disliked having an old woman seem to get the better of him after he had won the military victory.\"  Vyrtl laughed indulgently and sipped his wine.  \"Even Tzyfol,\" added Wilkins, \"might have been generous had she been young and pretty. Unfortunately, I suppose, it takes an old head to be an envoy.\"  The Emperor set his glass down very carefully.  \"What did you say?\" he demanded evenly.  Wilkins stared, with the expression of a man who fears he may suddenly recall having used an obscene word in polite company, or having bragged falsely and unwittingly of tax-evasion to an imperial collector.  Vyrtl repeated his question in a tone a note higher.  \"I-I-I said that if she were young and p-pretty--\"  \"How old do you think she was?\" rasped Vyrtl.  \"About s-s-seventy. Maybe seventy-five.\"  \"_What?_\"  He surged to his feet, overturning the table. Immediately the glass doors opening on the balcony were flung back with a splintering crash.  Four gleaming guardsmen charged out with drawn weapons, each obviously aching to become a hero. Wilkins prudently stood rooted, peering at them from the corner of his eye.  Vyrtl recovered his poise with an effort.  \"As you were!\" he ordered. \"Help General Wilkins pick up the table I knocked over. Clumsy thing!\"  It was done, and the guard captain apologized for the doors.  \"Relax, Wilkins,\" said Vyrtl when they were again alone. \"It just occurred to me that I ought to have another word with that woman. Have someone get hold of her at once!\"  He left the disordered balcony and waited in a nearby library. The books lining the walls were real, he noticed idly--another painstaking point by the designer of the palace.  There Wilkins found him presently, to report that the Jursan envoy was already on her way back to that planet.  \"I called the landing field guard,\" he explained, \"but she had already taken off. His spotters swept space for them and got a curve on the ship.\"  \"Of course,\" mused Vyrtl. \"The treaty has been broadcast.\"  \"Shall I have the patrols close in on her rocket?\"  \"No.\" The Emperor pondered a moment. \"Have a telescreen set up in here so we can speak directly.\"  A frenzied bustle ensued as Wilkins directed a platoon of awed techs through the process of bringing the mountain to Mohammed. In the end, the Jursan ship was in communication. The aide called for Daphne Foster, then stood aside.  Vyrtl was glad, when she appeared, that Wilkins had placed a deep armchair before the screen for him.  Was _this_ the woman with whom he had--?         *       *       *       *       *  She was still tall, but her white hair gave her the look of the seventy years with which Wilkins had credited her. Deep laugh-wrinkles bracketed the mouth, with more at the corners of the still bright eyes. The delicate bones of her face were more prominent.  There was nevertheless a clear resemblance to the Daphne Foster he had received earlier.  _She looks ... she looked_, thought Vyrtl, _as this woman might have looked when she was young ... or might have wanted to look._  No, that was not quite it.  _As she knew a man would have liked her to look!_  The woman on the screen spoke, her eyes smiling into his in a manner that was painfully familiar.  \"Your Illustrious Sublimity has become the first to share my little secret.\"  Vyrtl, with a concentration of will, prevented his eyes from peeping sidelong at Wilkins' expression.  \"We are somewhat surprised,\" he said, knowing it for an asinine remark but afraid to risk his dignity by being plainer.  \"Of course,\" she said, \"I hardly expect it to make any difference in the imperial announcement of peace, but if any clarification is desired of me, I shall be happy to oblige.\"  Vyrtl thought furiously. Had he actually _said_ anything to Wilkins or anyone else? He tried to remember every word spoken at the conference. It seemed to him there had been one or two slips, but they had been taken for imperial witticisms.  No, he was safe enough. The Jursan Council and their technicians naturally must know the \"clarification\" offered him, but they would know better than to publicize it. He could afford to show no mercy if they did. As things stood, it might be best to stand by his published word.  \"We desire,\" he said slowly, \"that you, as ambassador, return immediately. You will have every facility to communicate with your government, to repay the inconvenience.\"  The old woman stared him in the eye, then bowed silently.  Vyrtl saw that she realized what it might mean. He hoped she would not arrange an \"accident\" before her ship returned.  He had Wilkins take over and check with the captain of the rocket. It was determined that the best effort would bring the ship back to the dome on Klo about \"mid-morning.\" Vyrtl left orders that the woman was to be brought before him the moment she arrived, and retired for the night.  He found Xota sprawled confidently upon his bed, and kicked her off in a temper. His groping had found no loose object to fling after her as she slunk out the door, and that made his temper worse. He was a long time getting to sleep....         *       *       *       *       *  The next morning, he pecked at his breakfast and sneered at the artificial dawn that had been delayed for his benefit.  \"Get me a lozard and a squad of guards!\" he snarled to Wilkins. \"I'll have a run through the woods while"]]]
