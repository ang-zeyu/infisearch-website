As he lay in the tepee his adopted mother’s little friends brought many precious things and covered his body. At the feast were given away robes and kettles and blankets and knives and great wealth in honor of the little rabbit. Him they wrapped in a robe with his little moccasins on and buried him in a high place upon a scaffold.       THE PET DONKEY  There was a chief’s daughter once who had a great many relations so that everybody knew she belonged to a great family.  When she grew up she married and there were born to her twin sons. This caused great rejoicing in her father’s camp, and all the village women came to see the babes. She was very happy.  As the babes grew older, their grandmother made for them two saddle bags and brought out a donkey.  “My two grandchildren,” said the old lady, “shall ride as is becoming to children having so many relations. Here is this donkey. He is patient and surefooted. He shall carry the babes in the saddle bags, one on either side of his back.”  It happened one day that the chief’s daughter and her husband were making ready to go on a camping journey. The father, who was quite proud of his children, brought out his finest pony, and put the saddle bags on the pony’s back.  “There,” he said, “my sons shall ride on the pony, not on a donkey; let the donkey carry the pots and kettles.”  So his wife loaded the donkey with the household things. She tied the tepee poles into two great bundles, one on either side of the donkey’s back; across them she put the travois net and threw into it the pots and kettles and laid the skin tent across the donkey’s back.  But no sooner done than the donkey began to rear and bray and kick. He broke the tent poles and kicked the pots and kettles into bits and tore the skin tent. The more he was beaten the more he kicked.  At last they told the grandmother. She laughed. “Did I not tell you the donkey was for the children,” she cried. “He knows the babies are the chief’s children. Think you he will be dishonored with pots and kettles?” and she fetched the children and slung them over the donkey’s back, when he became at once quiet again.  The camping party left the village and went on their journey. But the next day as they passed by a place overgrown with bushes, a band of enemies rushed out, lashing their ponies and sounding their war whoop. All was excitement. The men bent their bows and seized their lances. After a long battle the enemy fled. But when the camping party came together again--where were the donkey and the two babes? No one knew. For a long time they searched, but in vain. At last they turned to go back to the village, the father mournful, the mother wailing. When they came to the grandmother’s tepee, there stood the good donkey with the two babes in the saddle bags.       THE RABBIT AND THE ELK  The little rabbit lived with his old grandmother, who needed a new dress. “I will go out and trap a deer or an elk for you,” he said. “Then you shall have a new dress.”  When he went out hunting he laid down his bow in the path while he looked at his snares. An elk coming by saw the bow.  “I will play a joke on the rabbit,” said the elk to himself. “I will make him think I have been caught in his bow string.” He then put one foot on the string and lay down as if dead.  By and by the rabbit returned. When he saw the elk he was filled with joy and ran home crying: “Grandmother, I have trapped a fine elk. You shall have a new dress from his skin. Throw the old one in the fire!”  This the old grandmother did.  The elk now sprang to his feet laughing. “Ho, friend rabbit,” he called, “You thought to trap me; now I have mocked you.” And he ran away into the thicket.  The rabbit who had come back to skin the elk now ran home again. “Grandmother, don’t throw your dress in the fire,” he cried. But it was too late. The old dress was burned.      THE RABBIT AND THE GROUSE GIRLS  The rabbit once went out on the prairie in winter time. On the side of a hill away from the wind he found a great company of girls all with grey and speckled blankets over their backs. They were the grouse girls and they were coasting down hill on a board. When the rabbit saw them, he called out:  “Oh, maidens, that is not a good way to coast down hill. Let me get you a fine skin with bangles on it that tinkle as you slide.” And away he ran to the tepee and brought a skin bag. It had red stripes on it and bangles that tinkled. “Come and get inside,” he said to the grouse girls. “Oh, no, we are afraid,” they answered. “Don’t be afraid, I can’t hurt you. Come, one of you,” said the rabbit. Then as each hung back he added coaxingly: “If each is afraid alone, come all together. I can’t hurt you _all_.” And so he coaxed the whole flock into the bag. This done, the rabbit closed the mouth of the bag, slung it over his back and came home. “Grandmother,” said he, as he came to the tepee, “here is a bag full of game. Watch it while I go for willow sticks to make spits.”  But as soon as the rabbit had gone out of the tent, the grouse girls began to cry out:  “Grandmother, let us out.”  “Who are you?” asked the old woman.  “Your dear grandchildren,” they answered.  “But how came you in the bag?” asked the old woman.  “Oh, our cousin was jesting with us. He coaxed us in the bag for a joke. Please let us out.”  “Certainly, dear grandchildren, I will let you out,” said the old woman as she untied the bag: and lo, the grouse flock with achuck-a-chuck-achuck flew up, knocking over the old grandmother and flew out of the square smoke opening of the winter lodge. The old woman caught only one grouse as it flew up and held it, grasping a leg with each hand.  When the rabbit came home with the spits she called out to him:  “Grandson, come quick. They got out but I have caught two.”  When he saw what had happened he was quite angry, yet could not keep from laughing.  “Grandmother, you have but one grouse,” he cried, “and it is a very skinny one at that.”       THE FAITHFUL LOVERS  There once lived a chief’s daughter who had many relations. All the young men in the village wanted to have her for wife, and were all eager to fill her skin bucket when she went to the brook for water.  There was a young man in the village who was industrious and a good hunter; but he was poor and of a mean family. He loved the maiden and when she went for water, he threw his robe over her head while he whispered in her ear:  “Be my wife. I have little but I am young and strong. I will treat you well, for I love you.”  For a long time the maiden did not answer, but one day she whispered back.  “Yes, you may ask my father’s leave to marry me. But first you must do something noble. I belong to a great family and have many relations. You must go on a war party and bring back the scalp of an enemy.”  The young man answered modestly, “I will try to do as you bid me. I am only a hunter, not a warrior. Whether I shall be brave or not I do not know. But I will try to take a scalp for your sake.”  So he made a war party of seven, himself and six other young men. They wandered through the enemy’s country, hoping to get a chance to strike a blow. But none came, for they found no one of the enemy.  “Our medicine is unfavorable,” said their leader at last. “We shall have to return home.”  Before they started they sat down to smoke and rest beside a beautiful lake at the foot of a green knoll that rose from its shore. The knoll was covered with green grass and somehow as they looked at it they had a feeling that there was something about it that was mysterious or uncanny.  But there was a young man in the party named the jester, for he was venturesome and full of fun. Gazing at the knoll he said: “Let’s run and jump on its top.”  “No,” said the young lover, “it looks mysterious. Sit still and finish your smoke.”  “Oh, come on, who’s afraid,” said the jester, laughing. “Come on you--come on!” and springing to his feet he ran up the side of the knoll.  Four of the young men followed. Having reached the top of the knoll all five began to jump and stamp about in sport, calling, “Come on, come on,” to the others. Suddenly they stopped--the knoll had begun to move toward the water. It was a gigantic turtle. The five men cried out in alarm and tried to run--too late! Their feet by some power were held fast to the monster’s back.  “Help us--drag us away,” they cried; but the others could do nothing. In a few moments the waves had closed over them.  The other two men, the lover and his friend, went on, but with heavy hearts, for they had forebodings of evil. After some days, they came to a river. Worn with fatigue the lover threw himself down on the bank.  “I will sleep awhile,” he said, “for I am wearied and worn out.”  “And I will go down to the water and see if I can chance upon a dead fish. At this time of the year the high water may have left one stranded on the seashore,” said his friend.  And as he had said, he found a fish which he cleaned, and then called to the lover.  “Come and eat the fish with me. I have cleaned it and made a fire and it is now cooking.”  “No, you eat it; let me rest,” said the lover.  “Oh, come on.”  “No, let me rest.”  “But you are my friend. I will not eat unless you share it with me.”  “Very well,” said the lover, “I will eat the fish with you, but you must first make me a promise. If I eat the fish, you must promise, pledge yourself, to fetch me all the water that I can drink.”  “I promise,” said the other, and the two ate the fish out of their war-kettle. For there had been but one kettle for the party.  When they had eaten, the kettle was rinsed out and the lover’s friend brought it back full of water. This the lover drank at a draught.  “Bring me more,” he said.  Again his friend filled the kettle at the river and again the lover drank it dry.  “More!” he cried.  “Oh, I am tired."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],["title","Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#2)"],["body"," you go to the river and drink your fill from the stream?” asked his friend.  “Remember your promise.”  “Yes, but I am weary. Go now and drink.”  “Ek-hey, I feared it would be so. Now trouble is coming upon us,” said the lover sadly. He walked to the river, sprang in, and lying down in the water with his head toward land, drank greedily. By and by he called to his friend.  “Come hither, you who have been my sworn friend. See what comes of your broken promise.”  The friend came and was amazed to see that the lover was now a fish from his feet to his middle.  Sick at heart he ran off a little way and threw himself upon the ground in grief. By and by he returned. The lover was now a fish to his neck.  “Cannot I cut off the part and restore you by a sweat bath?” the friend asked.  “No, it is too late. But tell the chief’s daughter that I loved her to the last and that I die for her sake. Take this belt and give it to her. She gave it to me as a pledge of her love for me,” and he being then turned to a great fish, swam to the middle of the river and there remained, only his great fin remaining above the water.  The friend went home and told his story. There was great mourning over the death of the five young men, and for the lost lover. In the river the great fish remained, its fin just above the surface, and was called by the Indians “Fish that Bars,” because it bar’d navigation. Canoes had to be portaged at great labor around the obstruction.  The chief’s daughter mourned for her lover as for a husband, nor would she be comforted. “He was lost for love of me, and I shall remain as his widow,” she wailed.  In her mother’s tepee she sat, with her head covered with her robe, silent, working, working. “What is my daughter doing,” her mother asked. But the maiden did not reply.  The days lengthened into moons until a year had passed. And then the maiden arose. In her hands were beautiful articles of clothing, enough for three men. There were three pairs of moccasins, three pairs of leggings, three belts, three shirts, three head dresses with beautiful feathers, and sweet smelling tobacco.  “Make a new canoe of bark,” she said, which was made for her.  Into the canoe she stepped and floated slowly down the river toward the great fish.  “Come back my daughter,” her mother cried in agony. “Come back. The great fish will eat you.”  She answered nothing. Her canoe came to the place where the great fin arose and stopped, its prow grating on the monster’s back. The maiden stepped out boldly. One by one she laid her presents on the fish’s back, scattering the feathers and tobacco over his broad spine.  “Oh, fish,” she cried, “Oh, fish, you who were my lover, I shall not forget you. Because you were lost for love of me, I shall never marry. All my life I shall remain a widow. Take these presents. And now leave the river, and let the waters run free, so my people may once more descend in their canoes.”  She stepped into her canoe and waited. Slowly the great fish sank, his broad fin disappeared, and the waters of the St. Croix (Stillwater) were free.       THE ARTICHOKE AND THE MUSKRAT  On the shore of a lake stood an artichoke with its green leaves waving in the sun. Very proud of itself it was, and well satisfied with the world. In the lake below lived a muskrat in his tepee, and in the evening as the sun set he would come out upon the shore and wander over the bank. One evening he came near the place where the artichoke stood.  “Ho, friend,” he said, “you seem rather proud of yourself. Who are you?”  “I am the artichoke,” answered the other, “and I have many handsome cousins. But who are you?”  “I am the muskrat, and I, too, belong to a large family. I live in the water. I don’t stand all day in one place like a stone.”  “If I stand in one place all day,” retorted the artichoke, “at least I don’t swim around in stagnant water, and build my lodge in the mud.”  “You are jealous of my fine fur,” sneered the muskrat. “I may build my lodge in the mud, but I always have a clean coat. But you are half buried in the ground, and when men dig you up, you are never clean.”  “And your fine coat always smells of musk,” jeered the artichoke.  “That is true,” said the muskrat. “But men think well of me, nevertheless. They trap me for the fine sinew in my tail; and handsome young women bite off my tail with their white teeth and make it into thread.”  “That’s nothing,” laughed the artichoke. “Handsome young warriors, painted and splendid with feathers, dig me up, brush me off with their shapely hands and eat me without even taking the trouble to wash me off.”      THE RABBIT AND THE BEAR WITH THE FLINT BODY  The Rabbit and his grandmother were in dire straits, because the rabbit was out of arrows. The fall hunt would soon be on and his quiver was all but empty. Arrow sticks he could cut in plenty, but he had nothing with which to make arrowheads.  “You must make some flint arrowheads,” said his grandmother. “Then you will be able to kill game.”  “Where shall I get the flint?” asked the rabbit.  “From the old bear chief,” said his old grandmother. For at that time all the flint in the world was in the bear’s body.  So the rabbit set out for the village of the Bears. It was winter time and the lodges of the bears were set under the shelter of a hill where the cold wind would not blow on them and where they had shelter among the trees and bushes.  He came at one end of the village to a hut where lived an old woman. He pushed open the door and entered. Everybody who came for flint always stopped there because it was the first lodge on the edge of the village. Strangers were therefore not unusual in the old woman’s hut, and she welcomed the rabbit. She gave him a seat and at night he lay with his feet to the fire.  The next morning the rabbit went to the lodge of the bear chief. They sat together awhile and smoked. At last the bear chief spoke.  “What do you want, my grandson?”  “I have come for some flint to make arrows,” answered the rabbit.  The bear chief grunted, and laid aside his pipe. Leaning back he pulled off his robe and, sure enough, one half of his body was flesh and the other half hard flint.  “Bring a stone hammer and give it to our guest,” he bade his wife. Then as the rabbit took the hammer he said: “Do not strike too hard.”  “Grandfather, I shall be careful,” said the rabbit. With a stroke he struck off a little flake of flint from the bear’s body.  “Ni-sko-ke-cha? So big?” he asked.  “Harder, grandson; strike off bigger pieces,” said the bear.  The rabbit struck a little harder.  “Ni-sko-ke-cha? So big?” he asked.  The bear grew impatient. “No, no, strike off bigger pieces. I can’t be here all day. Tanka kaksa wo! Break off a big piece.”  The rabbit struck again--hard! “Ni-sko-ke-cha?” he cried, as the hammer fell. But even as he spoke the bear’s body broke in two, the flesh part fell away and only the flint part remained. Like a flash the rabbit darted out of the hut.  There was a great outcry in the village. Openmouthed, all the bears gave chase. But as he ran the rabbit cried: “Wa-hin-han-yo (snow, snow) Ota-po, Ota-po--lots more, lots more,” and a great storm of snow swept down from the sky.  The rabbit, light of foot, bounded over the top of the snow. The bears sunk in and floundered about helpless. Seeing this, the rabbit turned back and killed them one by one with his club. That is why we now have so few bears.       STORY OF THE LOST WIFE  A Dakota girl married a man who promised to treat her kindly, but he did not keep his word. He was unreasonable, fault-finding, and often beat her. Frantic with his cruelty, she ran away. The whole village turned out to search for her, but no trace of the missing wife was to be found.  Meanwhile, the fleeing woman had wandered about all that day and the next night. The next day she met a man, who asked her who she was. She did not know it, but he was not really a man, but the chief of the wolves.  “Come with me,” he said, and he led her to a large village. She was amazed to see here many wolves--gray and black, timber wolves and coyotes. It seemed as if all the wolves in the world were there.  The wolf chief led the young woman to a great tepee and invited her in. He asked her what she ate for food.  “Buffalo meat,” she answered.  He called two coyotes and bade them bring what the young woman wanted. They bounded away and soon returned with the shoulder of a fresh-killed buffalo calf.  “How do you prepare it for eating?” asked the wolf chief.  “By boiling,” answered the young woman.  Again he called the two coyotes. Away they bounded and soon brought into the tent a small bundle. In it were punk, flint and steel--stolen, it may be, from some camp of men.  “How do you make the meat ready?” asked the wolf chief.  “I cut it into slices,” answered the young woman.  The coyotes were called and in a short time fetched in a knife in its sheath. The young woman cut up the calf’s shoulder into slices and ate it.  Thus she lived for a year, all the wolves being very kind to her. At the end of that time the wolf chief said to her:  “Your people are going off on a buffalo hunt. Tomorrow at noon they will be here. You must then go out and meet them or they will fall on us and kill us.”  The next day at about noon the young woman went to the top of a neighboring knoll. Coming toward her were some young men riding on their ponies. She stood up and held her hands so that they could see her. They wondered who she was, and when they were close by gazed at her closely.  “A year ago we lost a young woman; if you are she, where have you been,”  they asked.  “I have been in the wolves’ village. Do not harm them,” she answered.  “We will ride back and tell the people,” they said. “Tomorrow again at noon, we shall meet you.”  The young woman went back to the wolf village, and the next day went again to a neighboring knoll, though to a different one. Soon she saw the camp coming in a long line over the"]]]
