The animals described are grouped not by scientific relationships but by similarities in appearance in the field. Photographs of the animals in their natural environment are the main aids to identification.  A dichotomized key is provided to aid in identification of stranded cetaceans and appendices describe how and to whom to report data on live and dead cetaceans.   INTRODUCTION  All whales, dolphins, and porpoises belong to an order or major scientific group called the Cetacea by scientists. They are all mammals (air-breathing animals which have hair in at least some stage of their development, maintain a constant body temperature, bear their young alive, and nurse them for a while) which have undergone extensive changes in body form (anatomy) and function (physiology) to cope with a life spent entirely in the water. The breathing aperture(s), called a blowhole or blowholes, has (have) migrated to the top of the head to facilitate breathing while swimming; the forward appendages have become flippers; the hind appendages have nearly disappeared, they remain only as small traces of bone deeply imbedded in the muscles. Propulsion is provided by fibrous, horizontally flattened tail flukes.  Scientists recognize two suborders of living cetaceans: the whalebone whales, suborder Mysticeti, and the toothed whales, suborder Odontoceti. The two groups are separated in the following ways:  BALEEN OR WHALEBONE WHALES. These animals are called whalebone whales because when fully formed instead of teeth they have up to 800 or more plates of baleen or whalebone depending from the roof of the mouth. They use these plates to strain their food, which consists of \"krill\" (primarily small crustaceans) and/or small schooling fish, by taking water into the mouth and forcing it out through the overlapping fringes of the baleen plates. Baleen whales are externally distinguishable from toothed whales by having paired blowholes. There are eight species of baleen whales in the western North Atlantic, ranging in size from the minke whale (just over 30 feet [about 9.1 m])[5] to the blue whale (85 feet [25.9 m]).  [Footnote 5: Throughout this guide, measurements are given first in feet or inches, followed in parentheses by their equivalents in meters or centimeters. It is recognized that field estimates cannot be as precise as most of the conversions used.]  TOOTHED WHALES. Unlike the baleen whales, the toothed whales do have teeth after birth. The teeth vary in number from 2 to over 250, though they may sometimes be concealed beneath the gum. In addition, toothed whales have only a single blowhole. This group includes the animals commonly called dolphin or porpoise as well as some commonly called whales (for example, the sperm whale). There are currently about 30 species of toothed whales known from the western North Atlantic, ranging in maximum adult size from the common or harbor porpoise, which is approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) long, up to the sperm whale which reaches a length of 68 feet (20.7 m). Several other species which are expected to be found in this region, though they have not yet been reported, are also included in this guide.   CLASSIFICATION OF CETACEANS  In addition to the two suborders (Mysticeti and Odontoceti), the cetacean order contains numerous families, genera, and species. Each of these groupings represents a progressively more specialized division of the animals into categories on the basis of similarities in their skulls, postcranial skeletons, and external characteristics. The discipline which concerns itself with naming an animal and assigning it to its appropriate scientific category is known as taxonomy. An example of the classification of a cetacean species is shown in the following:  SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE ATLANTIC BOTTLENOSED DOLPHIN    Kingdom:      Animalia      all animals    Phylum:       Chordata      having at some stage a notochord,                               the precursor of the backbone    Subphylum:    Vertebrata    animals with backbones--fishes,                               amphibians, reptiles, birds,                               and mammals    Class:        Mammalia      animals that suckle their young    Order:        Cetacea       carnivorous, wholly aquatic                               mammals: whales, including                               dolphins and porpoises    Suborder:     Odontoceti    toothed whales as distinguished                               from Mysticeti, the baleen whales    Family:       Delphinidae   dolphins    Genus:        Tursiops      bottlenosed dolphins    Species:      truncatus     Atlantic bottlenosed dolphin  Modern taxonomy had its origin with the Swedish naturalist Linnaeus, whose tenth edition of the _Systema Naturae_ in 1758 forms the official starting point. Following Linnaeus, modern scientific names consist of two words, a generic name, which has an initial capital, and a species name, which rarely does, occasionally in botany (some species names deriving from a person's name are capitalized). Both names are usually of Latin origin (sometimes Greek) and are italicized or underlined. These scientific names are of particular importance because, although common names of species often are different in different countries or even in different regions of the same country, the scientific name remains the same. For example, the right whale is universally known as _Eubalaena glacialis_ though its common names include black right whale, nordcaper, sletbag, Biscay whale, and Biscayan right whale.  Although classification of many species is still in a state of flux, the classification of western North Atlantic cetaceans followed in this guide is as follows:                                                                           Page of                                                                 synoptic account                                                                   of the species    Order Cetacea    Suborder Mysticeti--Baleen whales      Family Balaenopteridae--Rorquals        _Balaenoptera acutorostrata_ Lacepede 1804     Minke whale              63        _Balaenoptera physalus_      (Linnaeus 1758)   Fin whale                26        _Balaenoptera musculus_      (Linnaeus 1758)   Blue whale               19        _Balaenoptera borealis_      Lesson 1828       Sei whale                32        _Balaenoptera edeni_         Anderson 1879     Bryde's whale            37        _Megaptera novaeangliae_     (Borowski 1781)   Humpback whale           40      Family Balaenidae--Right whales        _Balaena mysticetus_         Linnaeus 1758     Bowhead whale            49        _Eubalaena glacialis_        (Borowski 1781)   Right whale              52    Suborder Odontoceti--Toothed whales      Family Ziphiidae        _Mesoplodon bidens_          (Sowerby 1804)    North Sea                                                      beaked whale             82        _Mesoplodon densirostris_    (Blainville in    Dense-beaked                                    Desmarest 1817)     whale                  80        _Mesoplodon europaeus_       (Gervais 1855)    Antillean beaked whale   78        _Mesoplodon mirus_           True 1913         True's beaked whale      77        _Ziphius cavirostris_        G.

Schevill and E.M. Mitchell currently under review. The scientific names are followed by the name of the individual who named the species and the year of naming, and then by the common name most often used in the western North Atlantic.[6] It may be noted that some of the authors are in parentheses. This indicates that though the species name has remained the same since the date of naming the species has since been assigned to another genus. Because the species are not arranged in taxonomic order in this field guide, the page of the synoptic account of each is provided in the column to the right.  [Footnote 6: Most common names are based on some characteristic of the species (e.g., spotted dolphin, striped dolphin, rough-toothed dolphin); others are the names of authors of the species (e.g., True's beaked whale) or of habitats or macrohabitats which they inhabit (e.g., North Sea beaked whale and harbor porpoise); the origins of some common names, however, are less obvious (e.g., dense-beaked whale), and of less use in field references.]  [Illustration: Figure 1.--The western North Atlantic, from lat. 35°N-65°N.]  [Illustration: Figure 2.--The western North Atlantic, from lat. 37°N south to eastern Venezuela.]  [Illustration: Figure 3.--A baleen whale (humpback) showing the main body parts referred to in the text.]  [Illustration: Figure 4.--A fin whale in the North Atlantic with the paired blowholes open during respiration. The paired blowholes distinguish this animal as a baleen whale. (_Photo by W. A. Watkins._)]   DOLPHIN OR PORPOISE  There is still considerable controversy over the correct usage of the terms dolphin and porpoise. As mentioned in the preceding section, common names of any species may vary from locale to locale and even from individual to individual. Some persons argue for the use of the term porpoise for all small cetaceans. Others insist on the term dolphin. Still others either randomly use the terms or call members of the family Delphinidae dolphins and members of the family Phocoenidae porpoises. The evidence supporting any one of these positions is confusing at best and no usage of terms appears to be without problems. We see no wholly satisfactory resolution to the problem at this time. For all these reasons, we have little desire to defend our decision to follow the last of these practices in this guide, referring to all members of the family Delphinidae for which the term dolphin or porpoise appears in the common name as dolphins, and to the one member of the family Phocoenidae represented in the western North Atlantic, _Phocoena phocoena_, as the harbor porpoise. Although all cetaceans may be regarded as whales, the term \"whale\" most commonly applies to the larger animals. For all species treated, other common names by which they may be known are also listed.  Detailed treatment of the relative merits of the various terminologies is inappropriate here. Furthermore, it is our opinion that the usage of the terms dolphin, porpoise, and whale as part of the common names of cetaceans is largely a matter of personal preference.   ORGANIZATION OF THE GUIDE  The differences between baleen and toothed whales are easy enough to see in animals washed up on the beach or maintained in a tank at a zoo or aquarium. But since an animal at sea can seldom be examined that closely, its most obvious characteristics may be its overall size, the presence or absence of a dorsal fin, its prominent coloration or markings, its general behavior, or its swimming, blowing, and diving characteristics. For that reason, regardless of their scientific relationships, all the whales, dolphins, and the one porpoise covered in the main text of this guide are divided into three groups. Those over 40 feet (12.2 m) long are discussed in the section on Large Whales, those from 13 to 40 feet (4.0 to 12.2 m) in the Medium-Sized Whale, and those less than 13 feet (4.0 m) in the Small Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoise (with a dorsal fin). There are no small whales, dolphins, or porpoises in this region without a dorsal fin. Each section is further divided into those animals with a dorsal fin and those without. From that point, animals likely to be confused in the field are grouped together and the important differences between them are discussed.  The synoptic accounts of the species are followed by five appendices: Appendix A discusses and illustrates man-made and applied tags and natural markings on cetaceans and their importance in studies of natural history. Appendix B discusses the data which are most important to record in observations of cetaceans at sea, gives examples, and provides blank sighting forms. Appendix C discusses possible causes of cetacean strandings and the manner in which stranded animals should be handled and adds a key and tables to aid in identifying stranded cetaceans. Appendix D provides guidelines for collecting data on stranded cetaceans and provides forms and specific instructions for taking standard measurements. Appendix E lists institutions to be contacted in the event of a cetacean stranding or for information.  A bibliography of useful references on cetaceans in general and cetaceans of this region in particular and a directory to species accounts are included.

All toothed whales have teeth, which are used primarily for grasping rather than for chewing. The number varies from 2 to over 250, though they are buried beneath the gums in females and immature animals of several species, take peculiar form in one (narwhal), and are extensively worn in others.

Caldwell._)]   HOW TO USE THE GUIDE   To Identify Animals at Sea  The three major sections of the guide (i.e., large, medium, and small whales) are preceded by a directory to species accounts, which is a summary of the most obvious characteristics of each species and in which summary statements about each characteristic are arranged in parallel order. To use the guide to identify living animals observed at sea, a person or persons should:   1. First estimate the animal's size and determine whether or not it has a dorsal fin.  2. Note also any distinctive features of body shape and coloration and observe its general behavior, including swimming, blowing, and diving characteristics. It should be noted that coloration may vary somewhat at sea, depending on light conditions and water clarity. For example, animals which appear dark gray or black at the surface or when dead may appear brown in good light or when submerged. Making a brief sketch at this point may aid in identifying the animal or in later recalling its distinctive features.  3. Using the directory, locate the section to which the animal probably belongs.  4. Then, for more detailed information, consult the section indicated. There you will find a more complete discussion of the animal's range, size, and distinctive characteristics. In addition, you will find a brief discussion distinguishing it from animals with which it is likely to be confused in the field.         *       *       *       *       *  This guide will probably work best if, in advance of attempting to use the key in the field, the reader will familiarize himself with the general outline, with characters or behaviors to note, and with the locations of the various species accounts. It will also help if he schools himself to ask a series of questions about the animal(s) he sees at the time of the encounter rather than depending "]]]
