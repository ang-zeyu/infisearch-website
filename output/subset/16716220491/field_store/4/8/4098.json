The telephone rang again in another half minute. It was Stoddard again.  \"Mr. Kermit, pleeeease listen to me! I beg of you, come out here at once. It's terribly important!\"  I didn't say a word this time. I just hung right up.  In another half minute the telephone was jangling again. I was purple when I picked it up this time.  \"Listen,\" I bellowed. \"I don't care what noises you're hearing now--\"  Stoddard cut in desperately, shouting at the top of his lungs to do so.  \"I'm not only hearing the noises, Kermit,\" he yelled, \"I'm _seeing_ the people who cause them!\"         *       *       *       *       *  This caught me off balance.  \"Huh?\" I gulped.  \"The belfry,\" he yelled, \"I went up in the belfry, and you can see the people who's voices we heard!\" There was a pause, while he found breath, then he shouted, \"You have to come over. You're the only one I can think of to show this to!\"  Stoddard was an eccentric, but only so far as his tastes in architecture were concerned. I realized this, as I sat there gaping foolishly at the still vibrating telephone in my hand.  \"Okay,\" I said, for no earthly reason that I could think of, \"okay, hang on. I'll be there in twenty minutes.\"  Mrs. Stoddard met me at the door this time. She was worried, almost frightened, and very bewildered.  \"George is upstairs, Mr. Kermit. He won't let me come up there. He told me to send you up the minute you arrived. He's up in the attic.\"  \"What on earth,\" I began.  \"I don't know,\" his wife said. \"I was down in the basement drying some clothes, when I heard this terrible yelling from George. Then he was calling you on the telephone. I don't know what it's all about.\"  I raced up to the attic in nothing flat, almost knocking my teeth out on the bottom step of the attic stairs.  Then I stumbled into the darkness of the attic, and saw Stoddard's flashlight bobbing around in a corner.  \"Kermit?\"  It was Stoddard's voice.  \"Yes,\" I answered. \"What in the hell is up? It had better be goo--.\"  \"Hurry,\" Stoddard said. \"Over here, quickly!\"  I stumbled across the board spacings until I was standing beside Stoddard and peering up at what the beam of his flashlight revealed on the ceiling--a ragged, open hole, which he'd made by tearing several coatings of insulation from the spot.  For a minute, I couldn't make out anything in that flash beam glare. Stoddard had hold of my arm, and was saying one word over and over, urgently.  \"Look. Look. Look!\"  Then my eyes got adjusted to the light change, and I was aware that I was gazing up into the interior of the crazy belfry atop the monstrous house. Gazing up into the interior, while voices, quite loud and clearly distinguishable, were talking in a language which I didn't recognize immediately. As far as my vision was concerned, I might as well have been looking at a sort of grayish vaporish screen of some sort, that was all I saw.  \"Shhhh!\" Stoddard hissed now. \"Don't say a word. Just listen to them!\"  I held my breath, although it wasn't necessary. As I said, the voices coming down from that belfry were audible enough to have been a scant ten or twelve feet away. But I held my breath anyway, meanwhile straining my eyes to pierce that gray screen of vapor on which the light was focused.  And then I got it. The voices were talking in German, two of them, both harsh, masculine.  \"What in the hell,\" I began. \"Is there a short wave set up there or--\"  Stoddard cut me off. \"Can't you see it yet?\" he hissed.         *       *       *       *       *  The voices went on talking, while I strained my eyes even more in an effort to pierce that gray fog covering the rent in the ceiling. And then I saw. Saw at first, as if through a thin gray screen of gauze.  I was looking up into a room of some sort. A big room. An incredibly big room. A room so big that two dozen belfry rooms would have fit into it!  And then it got even clearer. There was a desk at the end of the room. A tremendously ornate desk. A desk behind which was sitting a small, gray uniformed, moustached man.  There was another uniformed person of porcine girth standing beside that desk and pointing to a map on the wall in front of him. He was jabbering excitedly to the little man at the desk, and he wore a uniform that was so plushily gaudy it was almost ridiculous.  The two kept chattering back and forth to each other in German, obviously talking about the map at which the fat, plush-clad one was pointing.  I turned incredulously to Stoddard.  \"Wh-wh-what in the hell goes?\" I demanded.  Stoddard seemed suddenly vastly relieved. \"So you see it and hear it, too!\" he exclaimed. \"Thank God for that! I thought I'd lost my mind!\"  I grabbed hard on his arm. \"But listen,\" I began.  \"Listen, nothing,\" he hissed. \"We _both_ can't be crazy. Those are the voices we kept hearing before. And those two people are the talkers. Those two German (five words censored) louses. Hitler and Goering!\"  There, he'd said it. I hadn't dared to. It sounded too mad, too wildly, babblingly insane to utter. But now I looked back through that thin gray cheesecloth of fog, back into the room.  The two occupants couldn't be anyone other than Hitler and Goering. And I was suddenly aware that the map Goering pointed to so frequently was a map of Austria.  \"But what,\" I started again.  Stoddard looked me in the eye. \"I can understand a little German,\" he said. \"They're talking about an invasion of Austria, and if you will look hard at the corner of that map, you'll see a date marked--1938!\"  I did look hard, and of course I saw that date. I turned back to Stoddard.  \"We're both crazy,\" I said a little wildly, \"we're both stark, raving nuts. Let's get out of here.\"  \"We are looking back almost five years into the past,\" Stoddard hissed. \"We are looking back five years into Germany, into a room in which Hitler and Goering are talking over an approaching invasion of a country called Austria. I might have believed I was crazy when I first found this alone, but not now!\"  Maybe we were both crazy. Maybe he was wrong. But then and there I believed him, and I knew that somehow, in some wild, impossible fashion, that belfry on Stoddard's asinine house had become a door leading through space and time, back five years into Germany, into the same room where Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering planned the conquest of Austria!  Stoddard was taking something out of his pocket.  \"Now that you're here I can try it,\" he said. \"I didn't dare do so before, since I felt I couldn't trust my own mind alone in the thing.\"  I looked at what he held in his hands. A stone, tied to a long piece of string.  \"What's that for?\" I demanded.  \"I want to see if that veil, that gray fog door, can be penetrated,\" he hissed.         *       *       *       *       *  Stoddard was swinging the stone on a string in a sharp arc now. And suddenly he released it, sending it sailing through the grayish aperture in the ceiling, straight into the belfry, or rather, the big room.  I saw and heard the stone on the string hit the marble floor of that room. Then, just as sharply, Stoddard jerked it back, yanking it into the attic again.  The result in the room beyond the fog sheet was instantaneous. Goering wheeled from the map on the wall, glaring wildly around the room. A pistol was in his hand.  Hitler had half risen behind that ornate desk, and was searching the vast, otherwise unoccupied room wildly with his eyes.  Of course neither saw anything. Stoddard, breathing excitedly at my side, had pulled the stone back into our section of time and space. But his eyes were gleaming.  \"It can be done,\" he whispered fiercely. \"It can be crossed!\"  \"But what on--\" I started. He cut me off with a wave of his hand, pointing back to the gray screen covering the hole in the ceiling.  Goering had put the pistol back in the holster at his side, and was grinning sheepishly at der Fuehrer, who was resuming his seat behind the desk in confused and angry embarrassment.  The voices picked up again.  \"They're saying how silly, to be startled by a sound,\" Stoddard hissed in my ear.  Then he grabbed my arm. \"But come, we can't wait any longer. Something has to be done immediately.\"  He was pulling me away from the rent in the ceiling, away from the door that had joined our time and space to the time and space of a world and scene five years ago.  As we emerged from the attic and started blinkingly down the steps, Stoddard almost ran ahead of me.  \"We must hurry,\" he said again and again.  \"To where?\" I demanded bewilderedly. \"Hadn't we better do something about th--\"  \"Exactly,\" Stoddard panted. \"We're really going to do something about that phenomenon in the belfry. We're going to the first place in two where we can buy two rifles, quick!\"  \"Rifles?\" I gasped, still not getting it.  \"For that little moustached swine up there,\" Stoddard said, pointing toward the attic. \"If a stone can cross that gray barrier, so can bullets. We are both going to draw bead on Adolf Hitler in the year of 1938, and thus avert this hell he's spread since then. With two of us firing, we can't miss.\"  And then, of course, I got it. It was incredible, impossible. But that gray screen covering the rent in the attic ceiling upstairs wasn't impossible. I'd seen it. Neither was the room behind it, the room where the belfry was supposed to be, but where Adolf Hitler's inner sanctum was instead. I'd seen that, too. So was it impossible that we'd be able to eliminate the chief cause of the world's trouble by shooting accurately back across time and space?  At that moment I didn't think so!  Our mad clattering dash down the attic steps, and then down to the first floor brought Mrs. Stoddard up from the basement. She looked frightenedly from her husband to me, then back to him again.  \"What's wrong?\" she quavered.  \"Nothing,\" Stoddard said,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32903"],["title","The Victor (#1)"],["body","ing,\" 4901 shivered. His eyes rolled crazily, then he turned over and buried his face in his arms.  The situation had twisted all the old accepted values squarely around. Preferring death over life. But not because of any anti-life attitude, or pessimism, or defeatism. None of those negative attitudes that would have made the will-to-die abnormal under conditions in which there would have been hope and some faint chance of a bearable future. Here to keep on living was a final form of de-humanized indignity, of humiliation, of ignominy, of the worst thing of all--loss of one's-self--of one's individuality. To die as a human being was much more preferable over continuing to live as something else--something neither human or machine, but something of both, with none of the dignity of either.         *       *       *       *       *  The screening process hadn't detected the capsule of poison in Marquis' tooth. The capsule contained ten grains of poison, only one of which was enough to bring a painless death within sixteen hours or so. That was his ace in the hole, and he waited only for the best time to use it.  Bells rang. The prisoners jumped from their beds and went through a few minutes of calisthenics. Other bells rang and a tray of small tins of food-concentrates appeared out of a slit in the wall by each bed. More bells rang, different kinds of bells, some deep and brazen, others high and shrill. And the prisoners marched off to specialized jobs co-operating with various machines.  You slept eight hours. Calisthenics five minutes. Eating ten minutes. Relaxation to the tune of musical bells, ten minutes. Work period eight hours. Repeat. That was all of life, and after a while Marquis knew, a man would not be aware of time, nor of his name, nor that he had once been human.  Marquis felt deep lancing pain as he tried to resist the bells. Each time the bells rang and a prisoner didn't respond properly, invisible rays of needle pain punched and kept punching until he reacted properly.  And finally he did as the bells told him to do. Finally he forgot that things had ever been any other way.  Marquis sat on his bed, eating, while the bells of eating rang across the bowed heads in the gray uniforms. He stared at the girl, then at the man, 4901. There were many opportunities to take one's own life here. That had perplexed him from the start--_why hasn't the girl, and this man, succeeded in dying?_  And all the others? They were comparatively new here, all these in this indoctrination ward. Why weren't they trying to leave in the only dignified way of escape left?  No. 4901 tried to talk, he tried hard to remember things. Sometimes memory would break through and bring him pictures of other times, of happenings on Earth, of a girl he had known, of times when he was a child. But only the mildest and softest kind of recollections....  Marquis said, \"I don't think there's a prisoner here who doesn't want to escape, and death is the only way out for us. We know that.\"  For an instant, No. 4901 stopped eating. A spoonful of food concentrate hung suspended between his mouth and the shelf. Then the food moved again to the urging of the bells. Invisible pain needles gouged Marquis' neck, and he ate again too, automatically, talking between tasteless bites. \"A man's life at least is his own,\" Marquis said. \"They can take everything else. But a man certainly has a right and a duty to take that life if by so doing he can retain his integrity as a human being. Suicide--\"  No. 4901 bent forward. He groaned, mumbled \"Don't--don't--\" several times, then curled forward and lay on the floor knotted up into a twitching ball.  The eating period was over. The lights went off. Bells sounded for relaxation. Then the sleep bells began ringing, filling up the absolute darkness.  Marquis lay there in the dark and he was afraid. He had the poison. He had the will. But he couldn't be unique in that respect. What was the matter with the others? All right, the devil with them. Maybe they'd been broken too soon to act. He could act. Tomorrow, during the work period, he would take a grain of the poison. Put the capsule back in the tooth. The poison would work slowly, painlessly, paralyzing the nervous system, finally the heart. Sometime during the beginning of the next sleep period he would be dead. That would leave six or seven hours of darkness and isolation for him to remain dead, so they couldn't get to him in time to bring him back.  He mentioned suicide to the girl during the next work period. She moaned a little and curled up like a fetus on the floor. After an hour, she got up and began inserting punch cards into the big machine again. She avoided Marquis.  Marquis looked around, went into a corner with his back to the room, slipped the capsule out and let one of the tiny, almost invisible grains, melt on his tongue. He replaced the capsule and returned to the machine. A quiet but exciting triumph made the remainder of the work period more bearable.  Back on his bed, he drifted into sleep, into what he knew was the final sleep. He was more fortunate than the others. Within an hour he would be dead.         *       *       *       *       *  Somewhere, someone was screaming.  The sounds rose higher and higher. A human body, somewhere ... pain unimaginable twisting up through clouds of belching steam ... muscles quivering, nerves twitching ... and somewhere a body floating and bobbing and crying ... sheets of agony sweeping and returning in waves and the horror of unescapable pain expanding like a volcano of madness....  Somewhere was someone alive who should be dead.  And then in the dark, in absolute silence, Marquis moved a little. He realized, vaguely, that the screaming voice was his own.  He stared into the steamy darkness and slowly, carefully, wet his lips. He moved. He felt his lips moving and the whisper sounding loud in the dark.  _I'm alive!_  He managed to struggle up out of the bed. He could scarcely remain erect. Every muscle in his body seemed to quiver. He longed to slip down into the darkness and escape into endless sleep. But he'd tried that. And he was still alive. He didn't know how much time had passed. He was sure of the poison's effects, but he wasn't dead. They had gotten to him in time.  Sweat exploded from his body. He tried to remember more. Pain. He lay down again. He writhed and perspired on the bed as his tortured mind built grotesque fantasies out of fragments of broken memory.  The routine of the unceasing bells went on. Bells, leap up. Bells, calisthenics. Bells, eat. Bells, march. Bells, work. He tried to shut out the bells. He tried to talk to 4901. 4901 covered up his ears and wouldn't listen. The girl wouldn't listen to him.  There were other ways. And he kept the poison hidden in the capsule in his hollow tooth. He had been counting the steps covering the length of the hall, then the twenty steps to the left, then to the right to where the narrow corridor led again to the left where he had seen the air-lock.  After the bells stopped ringing and the darkness was all around him, he got up. He counted off the steps. No guards, no alarms, nothing to stop him. They depended on the conditioners to take care of everything. This time he would do it. This time they wouldn't bring him back.  No one else could even talk with him about it, even though he knew they all wanted to escape. Some part of them still wanted to, but they couldn't. So it was up to him. He stopped against the smooth, opaque, up-curving glasite dome. It had a brittle bright shine that reflected from the Moon's surface. It was night out there, with an odd metallic reflection of Earthlight against the naked crags.  He hesitated. He could feel the intense and terrible cold, the airlessness out there fingering hungrily, reaching and whispering and waiting.  He turned the wheel. The door opened. He entered the air-lock and shut the first door when the air-pressure was right. He turned the other wheel and the outer lock door swung outward. The out-rushing air spun him outward like a balloon into the awful airless cold and naked silence.  His body sank down into the thick pumice dust that drifted up around him in a fine powdery blanket of concealment. He felt no pain. The cold airlessness dissolved around him in deepening darkening pleasantness. This time he was dead, thoroughly and finally and gloriously dead, even buried, and they couldn't find him. And even if they did finally find him, what good would it do them?  Some transcendental part of him seemed to remain to observe and triumph over his victory. This time he was dead to stay.         *       *       *       *       *  This time he knew at once that the twisting body in the steaming pain, the distorted face, the screams rising and rising were all Charles Marquis.  Maybe a dream though, he thought. So much pain, so much screaming pain, is not real. In some fraction of a fraction of that interim between life and death, one could dream of so much because dreams are timeless.  Yet he found himself anticipating, even through the shredded, dissociated, nameless kind of pain, a repetition of that other time.  The awful bitterness of defeat.         *       *       *       *       *  He opened his eyes slowly. It was dark, the same darkness. He was on the same bed. And the old familiar dark around and the familiar soundlessness that was now heavier than the most thunderous sound.  Everything around him then seemed to whirl up and go down in a crash. He rolled over to the floor and lay there, his hot face cooled by the cold metal.  As before, some undeterminable interim of time had passed. And he knew he was alive. His body was stiff. He ached. There was a drumming in his head, and then a ringing in his ears as he tried to get up, managed to drag himself to an unsteady stance against the wall. He felt now an icy surety of horror that carried him out to a pin-point in space.  A terrible fatigue"]]]
