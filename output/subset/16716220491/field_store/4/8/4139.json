The very earth was odorous and the air was like balm, but Beatrice, usually susceptible to the beauties of Nature, was in too abstracted a mood to be conscious of the loveliness about her.  \"But of course he would know me,\" she told herself at length, reassuringly. \"Why, I should know him, and I was only five years old when he went away.\"  And with this she laughed aloud that she should have been so foolish as to consider for even a moment the absurd possibility of her father's not knowing her, and with her customary brightness of spirit restored she quickened her steps, and soon reached her uncle's place.  There were many acres in the estate. Henry Raymond was a well to do lawyer, and the walk to the dwelling lay through a large orchard. As Bee came in sight of the house the door opened, and a girl, about her own age, came out on the piazza, and ran down the steps to meet her. She was an extremely pretty girl. A slim graceful figure was hers, with a proud little head and sunny, shining hair that hung about her face with its beautiful blue eyes like a halo. She seemed rather the personification of loveliness than a flesh and blood maiden.  \"What made you so late, Bee?\" she cried. \"I have been watching for you fully an hour.\"  \"I staid to help Professor Lawrence for one thing; then the girls stopped me to talk with them. They want us to go to Edna's tomorrow afternoon. Will you be well enough to go, Adele?\"  \"Oh, I'm all right now, Bee. Papa came home early with a box of chocolates, and that seemed to be just what I needed.\"  Bee laughed.  \"You butterfly,\" she said. \"Always feeding on sweets. Did you leave me any?\"  \"Well--\" Adele Raymond hesitated. \"Not many, and that's a fact, Bee. You shouldn't have kept me waiting so long. And you haven't even noticed that I have on a new hat.\"  \"But I thought that yours had violets on it,\" remarked Bee as she glanced at the hat. \"That has red roses.\"  \"Well, this one is yours, goosey. You're a funny girl, Bee, not to know your own hat. I have been trying mine on, then I thought I'd wear yours to meet you. And oh, Bee! the pictures have come too.\"  \"What? Our photographs?\" exclaimed Bee eagerly.  \"Why Aunt Annie thought that we wouldn't have them for a week yet. Where are they, Adele?\"  \"In the library. I never knew you to be so concerned about your picture before, Bee.\"  \"I am going to send one to father,\" observed Bee as she hurried into the house. \"It's come just in time to go out with the letter.\"  \"But do come up stairs first, Bee, and see my new hat. Wouldn't you like to see it?\"  \"I'd rather see the pictures,\" answered Bee making a dash for the library, flinging her hat in one direction and her books in another as she did so.  \"Mamma won't like it if she sees your things lying about,\" observed her cousin following her into the library.  \"I'll pick them up just as soon as I see the photographs,\" said Bee impatiently as she took up the pictures.  \"Oh, Adele! how pretty you do look in yours; but mine--Oh, dear! it certainly leaves much to be desired.\"  \"Mamma said that your good looks lay in your expression,\" remarked her cousin. \"That is what makes it so hard to get a good picture of you, Bee. You are not going to send it to Uncle William, are you?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Bee with determination. \"I never would send one before because I always hoped to get a good one, but tonight Sue Ford asked me if I thought he would know me if he were to meet me unexpectedly, and I am going to make sure of it. Now, if you don't mind, Adele, I'll begin my letter at once.\"  \"Oh, Bee. I have been so lonely and dull,\" pleaded Adele. \"Must you write it this very minute?\"  \"If I don't he won't hear from me at all this month, and father insists on hearing once a month. It is such a little thing to do for him, and I love to please him. It won't take me long.\"  \"Of course then I must go away, and leave you alone,\" said her cousin petulantly. \"Mamma doesn't want me to bother you when you are writing to him; but please don't be long, Bee.\"  \"I won't,\" promised Bee, and at last she was left in peace.  An hour later Adele opened the door the merest trifle to peep in: \"Mamma wants you to come to her just as soon as you have finished Bee,\" she said. \"Are you through?\"  \"I have written the letter, but I haven't fixed the envelope for the picture yet,\" answered Beatrice jumping up from the desk. \"If you don't mind doing it for me, Adele, I'll see what Aunt Annie wants.\"  \"I don't mind a bit, Bee.\" Adele came into the room quickly. \"Where is the address?\"  \"Here!\" Bee moved a slip of paper on the desk toward her. \"He is to be in Egypt this month.\"  \"Just think of it,\" commented Adele bending over the desk. \"That's a long way off. Shall I put the picture in for you, Bee?\"  But Bee had already left the room. Adele directed the envelope in her best hand, then picked up her cousin's photograph, and looked at it critically.  \"Poor Bee!\" she said aloud. \"It isn't very good of her. I'd hate to have my father think I looked like that if he was far away from me. And Bee is much better looking. I suppose Uncle William won't mind though, as she is his daughter. Now if it were my picture--\"  She placed her own picture beside that of Bee's, and gazed at it complacently. Suddenly she gave a little ripple of laughter:  \"Wouldn't it be fun to send my picture instead of Bee's?\" she exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with mischief. \"I believe I'll do it. Bee will never know, and hers is really not good enough to send.\"  With this she slipped Bee's photograph into a drawer of the desk, placed her own in the envelope, and sealed it just as Bee re-entered the room.  \"You're a dear!\" exclaimed Bee taking it from her, and picking up her letter. \"Aunt Annie wants me to go down town for her, and I'll be just in time for the night mail.\"     Chapter II  The Omen of the Butterfly      \"Light and silv'ry cloudlets hover       In the air as yet scarce warm;     Mild, with glimmer soft tinged over,       Peeps the sun through fragrant balm.\"      _May Song. Goethe._   \"I am so glad that I sent it,\" exclaimed Beatrice again and again after posting the letter and the photograph. \"Father has always wanted my picture, but I waited hoping that sometime I'd get a good one. Still, it will give him an idea of how I look even though it is a poor likeness. I do wonder if he will like it!\"  And with a roguish smile Adele would answer: \"I think so, Bee.\"  The days passed. With more than her usual impatience Bee waited for an answer to her letter. If the connections were prompt, if he were not away from civilization on an extended butterfly hunt, if he wrote just as soon as he received it, she ought to hear by the last of May, she told herself; so, having arrived at this conclusion, she tried to rest in patience until that time should come.  At length the timid beauties of April were merged into the exuberance of the leaf and flower of May, and Nature was resplendent in the full glory of the springtide. The last day of the month fell upon a Saturday, and early in the morning of that day Bee dressed herself to go into town for the mail. Seating herself upon the steps of the piazza to wait for Adele who was to accompany her she feasted her eyes upon the beauty of the orchard whose trees seemed like great pink and white bouquets set in the ground. Suddenly a puff of wind stirred the branches, and sent the petals of the apple blossoms flying in every direction.  \"Dear me!\" exclaimed the girl springing up from the steps in pretended dismay as a shower of the fragrant blooms deluged her. \"Snow in May! I told Adele that it would be Christmas before she was ready. Come out, and see the storm, Aunt Annie.\"  A lady standing just inside a long French window which opened upon the porch came through it to her niece's side.  \"What an idea!\" she said in a clear musical voice.  \"Get the broom, Bee, and sweep off the steps. I shall be glad when the blossoms are gone. They make such a litter.\"  \"Why, Aunt Annie, glad when the blossoms are gone? You can't mean it. Just look at those trees! Did you ever see anything so pretty?\"  \"They are pretty enough, child,\" returned Mrs. Raymond carelessly. \"There! cease your rhapsodies, and get the broom. When you have seen as many Springs as I have you won't be quite so ecstatic over them.\"  \"I believe that I'll always feel just as I do now,\" declared Bee as she ran for the broom. \"When the trees begin to bud something gets into my being that makes me feel like--like--Oh, like Alexander the Great: that I could conquer the world.\"  \"It's the wine of youth in your blood, Bee.\" The lady smiled at the girl's enthusiasm. \"That's what it is to be young. You are very like your father.\"  \"Am I, auntie?\" Beatrice flushed with pleasure.  \"Yes. At least you are in regard to your feeling for Nature. He sees beauty in everything; or used to do so. It seems to be a family trait of the Raymonds. I don't notice it so much in Adele; but then she takes after my people.\"  \"Perhaps it is because she is so beautiful herself,\" remarked Bee meditatively. \"I've noticed that people don't prize what they themselves possess.\"  \"Don't say that, Bee. You are far from being homely,\" spoke Mrs. Raymond graciously, noting a trace of wistfulness in her niece's tone. \"Beside, 'Beauty is only skin--'\"  \"Yes; I know, Aunt Annie. Spare me!\" The girl put her hand in laughing protest over her aunt's mouth. \"Still, I wouldn't mind having the skin. I just believe that that saying, and the other: 'Handsome is as handsome does,' were invented by some ugly old thing with a skin as yellow as a pumpkin. Oh, here is Adele at last!\"  Mrs. Raymond laughed, and turned toward the door through which her daughter came, her face aglow with pride.  \"Beatrice has been ready a long time,\" she chided, the gentleness of her tone softening the reproof. \"You should not have kept her waiting, my daughter, when this is "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33407"],["title","Bee and Butterfly: A Tale of Two Cousins (#2)"],["body","day she is expecting a letter from her father.\"  \"Don't scold her, auntie,\" pleaded Bee gazing at her cousin with admiring eyes. \"Oh, Adele! how do you make yourself look so pretty?\"  Adele smiled, well pleased. She was accustomed to being told of her beauty, but she never wearied of the homage it exacted.  \"You look nice too, Bee,\" she said condescendingly with a glance of approval at Beatrice's white robed figure. \"Aren't you going to wear any hat?\"  \"I am going to carry it until we reach the road.\" Bee caught up a broad brimmed leghorn from a chair, and held it carelessly by the strings. \"I don't like to wear one any more than I have to. I'll beat you to the gate, Adele.\"  \"A race?\" Adele drew her brows together in a prim little frown. \"Such great girls as we are. Why, we are almost young ladies! It would not be proper.\"  \"Bother propriety!\" ejaculated her cousin. \"There is a whole year before we are sixteen. We don't need to give up running until then. Do we, auntie?\"  \"No;\" answered her aunt indulgently. \"Be girls just as long as you can. You will be young ladies soon enough. I wish Adele would take more exercise.\"  \"Just through the orchard then,\" cried Adele catching up her skirts daintily. \"Here goes! Oh, Bee!\"  \"What's the matter?\" asked Bee, surprised.  \"No wonder you could be dressed before I was,\" exclaimed Adele in shocked tones. \"There are three buttons of your dress unfastened.\"  \"Are there?\" Bee backed up to her unconcernedly. \"Do button them, like a dear. I never was good at closing exercises.\"  Adele giggled appreciatively.  \"Professor Lawrence says that closing exercises should be marked by decorum as well as dispatch,\" she remarked in didatic accents. \"I observe the dispatch, Miss Raymond, but I must say--\"  \"Oh, hurry up,\" interrupted Bee impatiently. \"What's a button more or less on such a glorious day as this? Come on, or I shall run a race with my shadow.\"  \"Catch me then.\" Adele darted away quickly. \"If I beat I shall read your letter first.\"  \"Good-bye, dears,\" called Mrs. Raymond after them. \"Don't let her beat you, Bee.\"  \"I won't, auntie,\" Beatrice paused long enough to say, and then sped after her cousin.  There were ripples of sunshine all tangled over the bowers of apple blooms, and dancing blithely over the mats of blue violets in the grass. Gold belted honeybees hummed a song of contentment in every flowery cluster. Gauze-winged dragon flies darted hither and thither, while butterflies sailed by on new born wings of bronze, and scarlet and gold. The wind laughed a gleeful accompaniment to the merry maidens who ran gaily down the path o'ershadowed by the trees. Adele's graceful form was in the lead, but Beatrice was gradually gaining upon her. At length, as they were nearing the edge of the orchard, Bee gave an exultant shout and passed her cousin, reaching the gate just ahead of her.  \"Weren't you awfully afraid that I'd get to read that letter?\" laughed Adele as, flushed and panting, she leaned against the gate. \"How fast you do run, Bee! I am all out of breath.\"  \"So am I,\" admitted Bee. \"We will have time to rest for a moment before going on to the office. Take off your hat, and you will soon be cool.\" She swung her own back and forth by the strings as she spoke.  \"I'm afraid of freckles,\" sighed her cousin.  \"Gracious!\" ejaculated Bee, quickly putting her hat on her head. \"I had forgotten all about freckles. How can you always remember, Adele?\"  \"Perhaps if you had to take the care of your skin that I do, you would not forget either.\"  \"But don't you ever get tired of it? I should think that you would want to go bareheaded sometimes.\"  \"I would, Bee; but I like to keep my skin nice too. One can't do both.\"  \"Can't one?\" asked Bee thoughtfully. \"I should think that the skin would need air and sunshine just like the flowers, and the butterflies, and all other pretty growing things.\"  \"Mamma always puts her lillies in the shade, doesn't she?\" queried Adele laughing. \"It keeps them white, and that's the reason she tells me to keep on my hat. Tan and freckles may be healthful, but they are not pretty. At least she doesn't think so. Do you know the reason that I always give Dolly Madison as my favorite character in history, Bee?\"  \"No. I have wondered about it. I should think you would prefer Queen Elizabeth, or Joan of Arc, or somebody like them. I like women who do things. Miss Rosa Bonheur, Miss Herschel, or Grace Darling suit me better.\"  \"Well, I like Dolly best because I sympathize with her. When she was a little girl her mother cut holes in her sunbonnet, and tied her hair through them so that she couldn't throw it off. She had a pretty skin too, and her mother didn't want it to get tanned, or sun-burned. I always think of what Dolly had to go through whenever I want to throw off my hat, and it helps me to keep it on. I know just how she felt about that everlasting bonnet. But after a while, you know, she became the mistress of the White House.\"  Bee laughed outright.  \"Is that the reason that you are taking such good care of your complexion?\" she asked teasingly. \"I never thought it of you, Adele.\"  \"Laugh if you want to,\" retorted Adele.  \"Isn't Professor Lawrence always telling the boys that one of them may be President of the United States some day, and that every one of them is eligible? Now the President has to have a wife, doesn't he? Well, I never could see why a girl mightn't look forward to being the Mistress of the White House as well as a boy might expect to be President.\"  \"If having a perfect complexion is one of the essentials toward becoming the Mistress of the White House you are right in line for the position,\" said Bee wiping her eyes. \"Never mind, Adele! I was just having a little fun. Your skin is lovely, and I expect I would be just as careful as you are if it were mine. I wonder how it would feel to be a beauty!\"  \"It's a great responsibility,\" declared Adele with a toss of her head. \"There is so much to live up to. If I am the least bit untidy some one is sure to say: 'Such a pretty girl should always be neat and dainty.' Or, 'beauty and dirt don't go together, my dear.' While you--you can be as careless as you wish, and no one thinks anything about it.\"  \"I am not so sure about that.\" Bee shook her head dubiously. \"Aunt Annie is always taking me to task for my untidiness. And there is much demanded of me in other ways. If you are expected to be neat and dainty at all times, I am urged to be industrious.\"      \"'How doth the little busy bee     Improve each shining hour,     And gather honey all the day     From every opening flower!'\"  quoted Adele in a sing-song tone. \"Isn't that what the girls are always saying, Bee? I never see you flying about the house helping mamma, or running errands, or pouring over your books that I don't think of the 'Little busy bee.' Now I can't find time to do anything except to dress, and to keep myself looking nice.\"  \"Well, a butterfly is not expected to do anything but to fly in the sun, and be happy,\" laughed Bee. \"And you are like a golden and white butterfly, Adele. Bees must make honey. They are too homely to do anything else, while butterflies--\"  \"Speaking of butterflies,\" interrupted Adele quickly. \"There is one just about to light on your head.\"  \"What kind is it?\" queried Beatrice holding her head very still, and speaking anxiously. \"I hope it isn't a cabbage butterfly. I shouldn't like to think that even a butterfly would take my head for a cabbage.\"  \"It's yellow and black, Bee. Is that the cabbage butterfly? I don't know as much about such things as you do.\"  \"The cabbage butterfly is white. Has it settled yet?\"  \"Yes.\" Adele watched as a yellow and black Swallow Tail poised gently upon Bee's head for a moment, and then flew away. \"There! it's gone.\"  \"That's a good omen,\" declared Bee turning toward the gate. \"Whenever a butterfly lights on your head it means favorable news from a distance. There will be something good in father's letter, I know. Come, Adele! lets hurry so that we can get it.\"  Adele straightened her hat a little, and then the two girls set off for the postoffice.     Chapter III  The Good News       \"As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far      country.\"       --_Proverbs._   \"Suppose there shouldn't be a letter,\" remarked Adele suggestively as the cousins entered the postoffice. \"What would you do?\"  \"But there will be,\" answered Bee confidently. \"In all the years that he has been away father has not failed to send me a letter once a month. Even though it may not be an answer to my last, I'll get a letter.\"  She was not disappointed. There was a letter for her, and Adele received one also.  \"Let's hurry to the old elm tree so that we can read them,\" cried Adele. \"I wonder who mine's from? I didn't expect a letter.\"  Beatrice assented readily. The old elm tree stood by the side of the road just outside the town and was a favorite resting place for pedestrians. It did not take the girls long to reach the spot, so eager were they to read their letters. Beatrice threw herself down on the grass without ceremony, and tore open her epistle. Adele sank down with a graceful and effective arrangement of her draperies. Before she had quite completed the adjustment she was startled by an exclamation from her cousin.  \"What is it, Bee?\" she asked, looking up curiously.  \"He is coming home,\" cried Bee jumping up and dancing about wildly. \"Oh, my father is coming home!\"  \"Is he?\" ejaculated Adele excitedly. \"What does he say? Do be quiet, Bee? Sit down and read me the letter, or let me read it.\"  \"I'll read it to you,\" answered Bee, kissing the missive rapturously. \"I'll read it in a minute. Oh, oh, oh! I'm so happy I could fly.\"  She grew quiet presently, however, and seating herself again, began to read:        \"Cairo, Egypt,       May 16th, 19--.       \"My dear Little Daughter:--       \"When you receive this letter your father will be nearer to you      than he has"]]]
