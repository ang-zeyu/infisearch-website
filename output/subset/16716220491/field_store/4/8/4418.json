Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.-- The addressee was Liszt's former teacher, the celebrated Viennese teacher of music and composer of innumerable instructive works (1791-1857).]  My very dear Master,  When I think of all the immense obligations under which I am placed towards you, and at the same time consider how long I have left you without a sign of remembrance, I am perfectly ashamed and miserable, and in despair of ever being forgiven by you! \"Yes,\" I said to myself with a deep feeling of bitterness, \"I am an ungrateful fellow; I have forgotten my benefactor, I have forgotten that good master to whom I owe both my talent and my success.\"...At these words a tear starts to my eyes, and I assure you that no repentant tear was ever more sincere! Receive it as an expiation, and pardon me, for I cannot any longer bear the idea that you have any ill-feeling towards me. You will pardon me, my dear Master, won't you? Embrace me then...good! Now my heart is light.  You have doubtless heard that I have been playing your admirable works here with the greatest success, and all the glory ought to be given to you. I intended to have played your variations on the \"Pirate\" the day after tomorrow at a very brilliant concert that I was to have given at the theater of H.R.H. Madame, who was to have been present as well as the Duchess of Orleans; but man proposes and God disposes. I have suddenly caught the measles, and have been obliged to say farewell to the concert; but it is not given up because it is put off, and I hope, as soon as ever I am well again, to have the pleasure of making these beautiful variations known to a large public.  Pixis [a notable pianist (1788-1874)--lived a long time in Paris] and several other people have spoken much to me of four concertos that you have lately finished, and the reputation of which is already making a stir in Paris. I should be very much pleased, my dear Master, if you would commission me to get them sold. This would be quite easy for me to do, and I should also have the pleasure of playing them FROM"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],["title","Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#2)"],["body","HAND, either at the opera or at some big concerts. If my proposition pleases you, send them to me by the Austrian Embassy, marking the price that you would like to have for them. As regards any passages to be altered, if there are any, you need only mark them with a red pencil, according to your plan which I know so well, and I will point them out to the editor with the utmost care. Give me at the same time some news about music and pianists in Vienna; and finally tell me, dear Master, which of your compositions you think would make the best effect in society.  I close by sending you my heartfelt greetings, and begging you once more to pardon the shameful silence I have kept towards you: be assured that it has given me as much pain as yourself!  Your very affectionate and grateful pupil,  F. Liszt  December 23rd, 1828  P.S.--Please answer me as soon as possible, for I am longing for a letter from you; and please embrace your excellent parents from me. I add my address (Rue Montholon, No. 7bis).    2. To De Mancy in Paris  [Autograph in the possession of M. Etienne Charavay in Paris.]  December 23rd, 1829  My Dear M. de Mancy,  I am so full of lessons that each day, from half-past eight in the morning till 10 at night, I have scarcely breathing time. Please excuse me therefore for not coming, as I should have liked to do, to lunch with Madame de Mancy, but it is quite impossible. The only thing I could do would be to come about 10 o'clock, if that would not be too late for a wedding day, and in that case I will beg M. Ebner [Carl Ebner, a Hungarian, a talented violinist (1812-1836)] to come with me. I don't write you a longer letter, for there is a pupil who has been waiting for me for an hour. Besides, we are not standing on ceremony. Ever yours,  F. Liszt    3. To Carl Czerny  [Autograph in the Musical Society's Archives in Vienna. Printed in a German translation: \"La Mara, Letters of Musicians extending over Five Centuries.\" II. Leipzig, B. and H. 1887.]  My dear and beloved Master,  It would be impossible to explain to you the why and wherefore of my leaving you so long without news of me. Moreover, I have now only five minutes in which to write to you, for Mr. Luden, a pianist from Copenhagen, is starting shortly, and for fear of delaying his journey I must be brief; but what is postponed is not lost, so cheer up, for very soon you will get a great thick letter from me, which I will take care to prepay, as I should not like to ruin you.  Among all the circles of artists where I go in this country I plead your cause tremendously: we all want you to come and stay some time in Paris; it would certainly do you a great deal of good, and you are so widely esteemed that you will doubtless be well satisfied with the reception you will meet with here. If you ever entertain this idea, write to me, I entreat you, for I will do for you what I would do for my father. I have been making a special study of your admirable sonata (Op. 7), and have since played it at several reunions of connoisseurs (or would-be connoisseurs): you cannot imagine what an effect it made; I was quite overcome by it. It was in a burst of enthusiasm caused by the Prestissimo, that Mr. Luden begged for a few words of introduction to you; I know your kindness, indeed I could never forget it. I therefore commend him in all confidence of your goodness, until the time when I am so happy as to embrace you myself and to show you (however feebly) all the gratitude and admiration which fill me.  F. Liszt  Paris, August 26th, 1830    4. To Alphonse Brot in Paris  [Autograph in the possession of M. Etienne Charavay in Paris.]  (Paris, Beginning of the 30th year.)  It would give us great pleasure, my dear M. Brot, if you would come and dine with us without ceremony tomorrow, Monday, about 6 o'clock; I do not promise you a good dinner,--that is not the business of us poor artists; but the good company you will meet will, I trust, make up for that. Monsieur Hugo [the poet] and Edgard Quinet [French writer and philosopher] have promised to come. So do try not to disappoint us, for we should miss you much. My good mother told me to press you to come, for she is very fond of you. Till tomorrow then! Kind regards and thanks.  F. Liszt  I have been at least six times to you without having the pleasure of seeing you.  61, Rue de Provence.    5. Monsieur Pierre Wolff (Junior), Rue de la Tertasse, Geneva, Switzerland  [Autograph in the possession of M. Gaston Calmann-Levy in Paris.]  Nous disons: \"Il est temps. Executons, c'est l'heure.\" Alors nous retournons les yeux--La Mort est la! Ainsi de mes projets.--Quand vous verrai-je, Espagne, Et Venise et son golfe, et Rome et sa campagne,  Toi, Sicile, que ronge un volcan souterrain, Grece qu'on connait trop, Sardaigne qu'on ignore, Cites de l'Aquilon, du Couchant, de l'Aurore, Pyramides du Nil, Cathedrales du Rhin! Qui sait?-- jamais peut-etre!  [We say: \"Now it is time. Let's act, for 'tis the hour.\" Then turn we but our eyes--lo! death is there! Thus with my plans. When shall I see thee, Espagna, And Venice with her gulf, and Rome with her Campagna; Thou, Sicily, whom volcanoes undermine; Greece, whom we know too well, Sardinia, unknown one, Lands of the north, the west, the rising sun, Pyramids of the Nile, Cathedrals of the Rhine! Who knows? Never perchance!]  Earthly life is but a malady of the soul, an excitement which is kept up by the passions. The natural state of the soul is rest!  Paris, May 2nd [1832]  Here is a whole fortnight that my mind and fingers have been working like two lost spirits, Homer, the Bible, Plato, Locke, Byron, Hugo, Lamartine, Chateaubriand, Beethoven, Bach, Hummel, Mozart, Weber, are all around me. I study them, meditate on them, devour them with fury; besides this I practice four to five hours of exercises (3rds, 6ths, 8ths, tremolos, repetition of notes, cadences, etc., etc.). Ah! provided I don't go mad, you will find an artist in me! Yes, an artist such as you desire, such as is required nowadays!  \"And I too am a painter!\" cried Michael Angelo the first time he beheld a chef d'oeuvre...Though insignificant and poor, your friend cannot leave off repeating those words of the great man ever since Paganini's last performance. Rene, what a man, what a violin, what an artist! Heavens! what sufferings, what misery, what tortures in those four strings!  Here are a few of his characteristics:--  [Figure: Liszt here writes down several tiny excerpts from musical scores of Paganini's violin music, such as his famous \"Caprices\"]  As to his expression, his manner of phrasing, his very soul in fact!----  May 8th [1832]  My good friend, it was in a paroxysm of madness that I wrote you the above lines; a strain of work, wakefulness, and those violent desires (for which you know me) had set my poor head aflame; I went from right to left, then from left to right (like a sentinel in the winter, freezing), singing, declaiming, gesticulating, crying out; in a word, I was delirious. Today the spiritual and the animal (to use the witty language of M. de Maistre) are a little more evenly balanced; for the volcano of the heart is not extinguished, but is working silently.--Until when?--  Address your letters to Monsieur Reidet, the receiver-general at the port of Rouen.  A thousand kind messages to the ladies Boissier. I will tell you some day the reasons which prevented me from starting for Geneva. On this subject I shall call you in evidence.  Bertini is in London; Madame Malibran is making her round of Germany; Messemaecker (how is he getting on?) is resting on his laurels at Brussels; Aguado has the illustrious maestro Rossini in tow.--Ah--Hi--Oh--Hu!!!    6. To Ferdinand Hiller  [This letter, published by F. Niecks (\"F. Chopin, Man and Musician,\" Vol. 1. German by Langhans. Leipzig, Leuckart, 1890), was written by Liszt and Chopin jointly, and was also signed by Chopin's friend Franchomme, the violoncellist. The part written by Chopin is indicated here by parentheses ().--Addressed to the well-known composer and author, afterwards Director of the Conservatorium and Concert Society at Cologne (1811-1885).]  This is the twentieth time, at least, that we have tried to meet, first at my house, then here, with the intention of writing to you, and always some visit, or some other unforeseen hindrance, has occurred. I don't know whether Chopin will be strong enough to make excuses to you; for my part, it seems to me that we have been so unmannerly and impertinent that no excuses are now permissible or possible.  We sympathized most deeply in your bereavement, and more deeply did we wish that we could be with you in order to soften, as far as possible, the grief of your heart. [Hiller had lost his father.]  (He has said it all so well that I have nothing to add to excuse me specially for my negligence or idleness, or whim or distraction, or--or--or--You know that I can explain myself better in person, and, this autumn, when I take you home late by the boulevards to your mother, I shall try to obtain your pardon. I am writing to you without knowing what my pen is scribbling, as Liszt is at this moment playing my Studies, and transporting me away from all suitable ideas. I wish I could steal his manner of rendering my own works. With regard to your friends who are staying in Paris, I have often seen, during this winter and spring, the Leo family [August Leo, banker in Paris], and all that follows. There have been evenings at certain ambassadresses' houses, and there was not a single one at which somebody living at Frankfort was not mentioned. Madame Eichthal sends you many kind messages--Plater [Count Plater, Chopin's countryman, and a friend also of Liszt], the whole family were very sorry for your departure, and begged me to give you their condolences.) Madame d'Apponyi [Apponyi, the Austrian ambassador in Paris] was very much vexed with me for not having taken you there before your departure; she hopes "]]]
