The consensus among psychiatrists and psychologists was that the condition stemmed from pathogenic causes.  Dr. Murt raised his eyebrows when he read this. Perhaps Phyllis Sutton was right, after all.  The bulletin continued, \"All clinical pathologists are requested to be alert to the presence of any unusual organisms discovered in body fluids or tissues examined. Please report your findings to the U. S. Public Health Service.\"  Murt found Phyllis Sutton at the microtome, finishing a wax section, and showed her the bulletin.  \"Score one for woman's intuition,\" he smiled. \"Federal Health Service tends to agree with your theory.\"  \"Now I _am_ eager to see those pictures,\" she said.         *       *       *       *       *  Less than two hours later, a messenger brought the photomicrographs, and the two pathologists bent over them together. Phyllis had submitted eighteen samples, six of which were controls taken from healthy, unafflicted subjects. Per her instructions, smears of the specimens in various degrees of dilution had been photographed through the great electron microscope.  [Illustration]  Murt muttered to himself as they compared the controls with the \"infected specimens.\" The \"healthy\" samples were relatively clear, except for minute protein matter. Conversely, all twelve suspect specimens swarmed with shadowy six-sided dots.  Phyllis' eyes widened. \"There is something there! Do you suppose it could be the Love Bug?\"  \"Love Bug?\"  \"Certainly. That bulletin didn't go into the psychologists' findings. The diagnosticians downstairs say that the symptoms appear to be no more than complaints of the lovesick.\"  \"Are you back on the pantie-raid theme again?\"  \"I've never been off it,\" she replied. \"From the first, I've had a notion that some organism was increasing glandular activity. Excess emotionalism often originates in overstimulated glands.\"  \"Of course, but mental attitudes can trigger the glands, and they are interacting. How do you separate the effects? How could you guess that an organism was responsible?\"  She shrugged. \"It was a possibility within our specialty, so I set out to prove or disprove it. From the appearance of these photographs, I don't think we have _disproved_ it.\"  It was a properly cautious statement that pleased Murt. They were a long way from proving that their newly discovered virus was the culprit, but the research had definitely produced a question mark.  Murt ordered copies of the photomicrographs from Ebert Industrial Labs and arranged for a complete dossier to be forwarded to the U. S. Health Service.  That night, he was startled by a headline and lead story that quoted the government bulletin. The science editor had a field day, tying in speculation that \"Doctors Suspect Love Bug Epidemic.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The next day, three reporters called upon him, each with the same query. \"It's rumored that you are doing research on the Love Bug, Dr. Murt. Anything to report?\"  He shooed them out angrily, after learning that someone at Ebert Labs had given them the tip. Phyllis smiled at him as he slammed the door after the last reporter.  \"You still discount the Love Bug idea, don't you?\" she asked.  \"I dislike sensationalism in a matter like this,\" he said. \"Even if their assumptions were true, I wouldn't like it.\"  \"You can't blame the papers. They're starved for some explanation. I pity your passion for anonymity if your virus proves to be the causative factor.\"  \"_My_ virus?\"  \"Certainly. The whole project is under your auspices and direction.\"  \"See here, Phyl, _you_ did the work.\"  \"Don't you dare mention my name,\" she said. \"You're my superior and senior pathologist and it's your duty to protect me against the press. I don't want columnists popping out of my bathroom any more than you do.\"  Murt gave up. \"The argument is entirely anticipatory,\" he pointed out. \"The virus might turn out to be a batch of dormant German measles. Would you consider having dinner with me tonight?\"  \"Why?\" She shot the question back at him like a rebounding tennis ball. \"Answer that first!\"  Murt opened his mouth. He could not recall ever hearing such a rude rejoinder to an invitation to dinner. Not that there had been a plethora of amenities between them, but this was unthinkable! The question was, why _should_ she have dinner with him? Give her eight good reasons. What was his motive in asking her? In one word, _why_?  Murt searched her face, but only a quiet interest showed in her expression.  \"Why does any man invite any woman to dinner?\" he countered.  \"You aren't _any_ man, Dr. Murt. Nor am I _any_ woman. I want your specific reason for inviting me to dinner. Is it to discuss professional matters or--what?\"  \"Good Lord, Dr. Sutton!\" He followed her lead in using the formal address. \"Man is a social animal! I would enjoy your company at dinner, that's all. At least, I thought I would.\"  She looked at him unrelentingly. \"If the talk will be about baseball, books or billiards, I'm for it. If it's to be moonlight, roses and dimmed lights--no sale.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was like asking one's grandfather for a date. His regard for her highly professional approach turned to resentment. After all, she was a woman, a woman who persisted in belting her smock too tightly and wearing sheer nylons. Why this absurd revulsion at his casual acknowledgment of her sex?  He almost withdrew the invitation, but changed his mind at the last moment. \"You name the place and the subject for conversation.\"  She nodded. \"Very well, I'll pick you up at seven.\"  He had his date--with an emancipated female, and she didn't let him forget it during the whole meal. The restaurant she picked was expensive, but about as romantic as a bus depot. She ordered beer instead of a cocktail, toyed wordlessly with a $5.00 steak, and argued over the check.  Only as they were preparing to leave did she betray a sign of femininity. A platinum blonde, two tables away, had been eying Murt. Suddenly, she lurched to her feet without a word to her escort, staggered over to the pathologist, slurred, \"You're what I've b'n lookin' for all m'life,\" and planted a wet alcoholic kiss on his mouth before he could defend himself.  Her escort peeled her away with sad-eyed apologies. There was no jealousy or anger in his face, only a deep hurt. \"She--she isn't well, I think,\" he said. \"You know, this new--whatever it is that's going around.\"  Murt wiped off the lipstick and looked at Phyllis, expecting to find at best sardonic amusement, but she seemed pale and annoyed.  \"I'm sorry I brought you here,\" she said.  \"Think nothing of it,\" Murt told her. \"You heard the man. This is what's going around. Do you think I'll catch it?\"  Phyllis wasn't amused. She did let him ride the taxi to her apartment, but bade him a terse goodby at the door.  Except for the incident of the blonde and Phyl's reaction, the evening had been a bust. Murt wondered how he had ever visualized her as a warm-blooded, responsive female. He smiled at the evening of torment she had once given him.  She was entirely frigid or else so leery of men that she might as well have been one herself.     IV   The following morning, he presided at a specialists' conference at the hospital, during which he revealed the results of the blood research. They had all read the Health Service bulletin and were sharply interested in the photomicrographs.  When the meeting was over, Feldman, the bacteriologist, and Stitchell, an endocrinologist, volunteered to work with Murt. They gave Phyllis' \"gland-irritation\" theory more credence than Murt. He outlined a program. Both agreed to take the problem back to their own departments.  The conference set Murt behind in his work and he spoke scarcely five words to his assistant until he was ready to leave. As he finished scrubbing up, she handed him an early edition of the _Times_.  \"Local Doctor Isolates Love Bug!\" The story was sketchy and not half so positive as the headline, but it did name him and High Dawn Hospital, and described the new virus.  He stared at Phyllis Sutton. \"Did you--\"  \"Of course not. The reporters were here, but I sent them away. I told them we were medicine men, not tobacco men.\"  \"Your name isn't even mentioned,\" he said suspiciously.  \"You signed the report to the Health Service,\" she pointed out. \"The leak probably came at that end.\" She put her hand on his arm. \"It wasn't your fault.\"  His fury cooled as he noted her gesture. Then she realized that he was looking down at her hand and withdrew it quickly.  The next few days were blindly busy. A note from the government acknowledged receipt of his report and pictures, and was followed by a message that the virus could not be identified. The implication was that there was a strong possibility that it was the causative factor in the new _malaise_.         *       *       *       *       *  Murt devoted more attention to the joint laboratory work on the virus. The newspapers continued to come up with confidential information they shouldn't have had, and they dubbed the Love Bug, _Murt's Virus_. The name stuck, and the pathologist found himself famous overnight.  Phyllis continued to force all the credit upon him, on threat of transferring out if he violated her confidence. Except for the nuisance of dodging reporters, the accolade was not entirely unpleasant.  His pictures--old ones, Lord knew where they had dug them up--began appearing in the papers. Instead of reproving him, the hospital board voted him a substantial salary increase and gave him a free hand in directing the research. A government grant was obtained to supplement his budget, and the work picked up speed.  Necessarily, the lead that Phyllis Sutton's early research had given them on the rest of the medical world was maintained largely because of the time lag in disseminating the information"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32759"],["title","Red Nails (#1)"],["body","fool,\" he grunted. \"Come, girl, don't be such a spitfire. I'm not like that Stygian you knifed, and you know it.\"  \"A penniless vagabond,\" she taunted.  He laughed at her.  \"What do you call yourself? You haven't enough money to buy a new seat for your breeches. Your disdain doesn't deceive me. You know I've commanded bigger ships and more men than you ever did in your life. As for being penniless--what rover isn't, most of the time? I've squandered enough gold in the sea-ports of the world to fill a galleon. You know that, too.\"  \"Where are the fine ships and the bold lads you commanded, now?\" she sneered.  \"At the bottom of the sea, mostly,\" he replied cheerfully. \"The Zingarans sank my last ship off the Shemite shore--that's why I joined Zarallo's Free Companions. But I saw I'd been stung when we marched to the Darfar border. The pay was poor and the wine was sour, and I don't like black women. And that's the only kind that came to our camp at Sukhmet--rings in their noses and their teeth filed--bah! Why did you join Zarallo? Sukhmet's a long way from salt water.\"  \"Red Ortho wanted to make me his mistress,\" she answered sullenly. \"I jumped overboard one night and swam ashore when we were anchored off the Kushite coast. Off Zabhela, it was. There a Shemite trader told me that Zarallo had brought his Free Companies south to guard the Darfar border. No better employment offered. I joined an east-bound caravan and eventually came to Sukhmet.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"It was madness to plunge southward as you did,\" commented Conan, \"but it was wise, too, for Zarallo's patrols never thought to look for you in this direction. Only the brother of the man you killed happened to strike your trail.\"  \"And now what do you intend doing?\" she demanded.  \"Turn west,\" he answered. \"I've been this far south, but not this far east. Many days' traveling to the west will bring us to the open savannas, where the black tribes graze their cattle. I have friends among them. We'll get to the coast and find a ship. I'm sick of the jungle.\"  \"Then be on your way,\" she advised. \"I have other plans.\"  \"Don't be a fool!\" He showed irritation for the first time. \"You can't keep on wandering through this forest.\"  \"I can if I choose.\"  \"But what do you intend doing?\"  \"That's none of your affair,\" she snapped.  \"Yes, it is,\" he answered calmly. \"Do you think I've followed you this far, to turn around and ride off empty-handed? Be sensible, wench. I'm not going to harm you.\"  He stepped toward her, and she sprang back, whipping out her sword.  \"Keep back, you barbarian dog! I'll spit you like a roast pig!\"  He halted, reluctantly, and demanded: \"Do you want me to take that toy away from you and spank you with it?\"  \"Words! Nothing but words!\" she mocked, lights like the gleam of the sun on blue water dancing in her reckless eyes.  He knew it was the truth. No living man could disarm Valeria of the Brotherhood with his bare hands. He scowled, his sensations a tangle of conflicting emotions. He was angry, yet he was amused and filled with admiration for her spirit. He burned with eagerness to seize that splendid figure and crush it in his iron arms, yet he greatly desired not to hurt the girl. He was torn between a desire to shake her soundly, and a desire to caress her. He knew if he came any nearer her sword would be sheathed in his heart. He had seen Valeria kill too many men in border forays and tavern brawls to have any illusions about her. He knew she was as quick and ferocious as a tigress. He could draw his broadsword and disarm her, beat the blade out of her hand, but the thought of drawing a sword on a woman, even without intent of injury, was extremely repugnant to him.  \"Blast your soul, you hussy!\" he exclaimed in exasperation. \"I'm going to take off your----\"  He started toward her, his angry passion making him reckless, and she poised herself for a deadly thrust. Then came a startling interruption to a scene at once ludicrous and perilous.  \"_What's that?_\"  It was Valeria who exclaimed, but they both started violently, and Conan wheeled like a cat, his great sword flashing into his hand. Back in the forest had burst forth an appalling medley of screams--the screams of horses in terror and agony. Mingled with their screams there came the snap of splintering bones.  \"Lions are slaying the horses!\" cried Valeria.  \"Lions, nothing!\" snorted Conan, his eyes blazing. \"Did you hear a lion roar? Neither did I! Listen at those bones snap--not even a lion could make that much noise killing a horse.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He hurried down the natural ramp and she followed, their personal feud forgotten in the adventurers' instinct to unite against common peril. The screams had ceased when they worked their way downward through the green veil of leaves that brushed the rock.  \"I found your horse tied by the pool back there,\" he muttered, treading so noiselessly that she no longer wondered how he had surprised her on the crag. \"I tied mine beside it and followed the tracks of your boots. Watch, now!\"  They had emerged from the belt of leaves, and stared down into the lower reaches of the forest. Above them the green roof spread its dusky canopy. Below them the sunlight filtered in just enough to make a jade-tinted twilight. The giant trunks of trees less than a hundred yards away looked dim and ghostly.  \"The horses should be beyond that thicket, over there,\" whispered Conan, and his voice might have been a breeze moving through the branches. \"Listen!\"  Valeria had already heard, and a chill crept through her veins; so she unconsciously laid her white hand on her companion's muscular brown arm. From beyond the thicket came the noisy crunching of bones and the loud rending of flesh, together with the grinding, slobbering sounds of a horrible feast.  \"Lions wouldn't make that noise,\" whispered Conan. \"Something's eating our horses, but it's not a lion--Crom!\"  The noise stopped suddenly, and Conan swore softly. A suddenly risen breeze was blowing from them directly toward the spot where the unseen slayer was hidden.  \"Here it comes!\" muttered Conan, half lifting his sword.  The thicket was violently agitated, and Valeria clutched Conan's arm hard. Ignorant of jungle-lore, she yet knew that no animal she had ever seen could have shaken the tall brush like that.  \"It must be as big as an elephant,\" muttered Conan, echoing her thought. \"What the devil----\" His voice trailed away in stunned silence.  Through the thicket was thrust a head of nightmare and lunacy. Grinning jaws bared rows of dripping yellow tusks; above the yawning mouth wrinkled a saurian-like snout. Huge eyes, like those of a python a thousand times magnified, stared unwinkingly at the petrified humans clinging to the rock above it. Blood smeared the scaly, flabby lips and dripped from the huge mouth.  The head, bigger than that of a crocodile, was further extended on a long scaled neck on which stood up rows of serrated spikes, and after it, crushing down the briars and saplings, waddled the body of a titan, a gigantic, barrel-bellied torso on absurdly short legs. The whitish belly almost raked the ground, while the serrated back-bone rose higher than Conan could have reached on tiptoe. A long spiked tail, like that of a gargantuan scorpion, trailed out behind.  \"Back up the crag, quick!\" snapped Conan, thrusting the girl behind him. \"I don't think he can climb, but he can stand on his hind-legs and reach us----\"  With a snapping and rending of bushes and saplings the monster came hurtling through the thickets, and they fled up the rock before him like leaves blown before a wind. As Valeria plunged into the leafy screen a backward glance showed her the titan rearing up fearsomely on his massive hind-legs, even as Conan had predicted. The sight sent panic racing through her. As he reared, the beast seemed more gigantic than ever; his snouted head towered among the trees. Then Conan's iron hand closed on her wrist and she was jerked headlong into the blinding welter of the leaves, and out again into the hot sunshine above, just as the monster fell forward with his front feet on the crag with an impact that made the rock vibrate.         *       *       *       *       *  Behind the fugitives the huge head crashed through the twigs, and they looked down for a horrifying instant at the nightmare visage framed among the green leaves, eyes flaming, jaws gaping. Then the giant tusks clashed together futilely, and after that the head was withdrawn, vanishing from their sight as if it had sunk in a pool.  Peering down through broken branches that scraped the rock, they saw it squatting on its haunches at the foot of the crag, staring unblinkingly up at them.  Valeria shuddered.  \"How long do you suppose he'll crouch there?\"  Conan kicked the skull on the leaf-strewn shelf.  \"That fellow must have climbed up here to escape him, or one like him. He must have died of starvation. There are no bones broken. That thing must be a dragon, such as the black people speak of in their legends. If so, it won't leave here until we're both dead.\"  Valeria looked at him blankly, her resentment forgotten. She fought down a surging of panic. She had proved her reckless courage a thousand times in wild battles on sea and land, on the blood-slippery decks of burning war-ships, in the storming of walled cities, and on the trampled sandy beaches where the desperate men of the Red Brotherhood bathed their knives in one another's blood in their fights for leadership. But the prospect now confronting her congealed her blood. A cutlas-stroke in the heat of battle was nothing; but to sit idle and helpless on a bare rock until she perished of starvation, besieged by a monstrous survival of an elder age--the thought sent panic throbbing through her brain.  \"He must leave to eat and drink,\" she said helplessly.  \"He won't have to go far to do either,\" Conan pointed out. \"H"]]]
