In a smaller shirt, the whole body is covered at irregular intervals with whorls of the finest porcupine quill work, edged by a border of interlaced black and white quills, finished with perforated shells. Many of the designs are edged with narrow zigzag borders of the split quills in natural colors carefully matched and lapped in very exact fashion. There is one small shirt, made with a decorative border of tanned ermine skins in alternate squares of fur and beautifully colored quill embroidery, not one tint of which is out of harmony with the soft yellow of the deerskin body. The edge of the shirt is finished in very civilized fashion, with ermine tails, each pendant, banded with blue quills, at alternating heights, making a shining zigzag of blue along the fringe. The simplicity of treatment and purity of color in this little garment were fascinating, and must have invested the small savage who wore it with the dignity of a prince.  The mother who evolved the scheme and manner of decoration carried her bit of genius in an uncivilized squaw body, but had none the less a true feeling for beauty, and in this mother task lifted the plane of the art of her people to a higher level.  [Illustration: _Left_--MOCCASINS of porcupine quillwork, made by Sioux Indians.  _Right_--PIPE BAGS of porcupine quillwork, made by Sioux Indians.  _Courtesy of American Museum of Natural History, New York_]  The purely decorative ability which lived and flourished before the advent of civilization lost its distinctive simplicity of character when woven cloth of brilliant red flannel and the tempting glamour of colored glass beads came into their horizon, although they accepted these new materials with avidity. Porcupine quill work seems to have been no longer practiced, although a few headbands of ceremony are to be found among the tribes, and now and then one comes across a veritable treasure, an evidence of long and unremitting toil, which has been preserved with veneration.  Of course many valuable results of the best early embroideries still exist among the Indians themselves.  A very striking feature of both early and late work is the fringing, which plays an important part in the decoration of garments. The fringe materials were generally of the longest procurable dried moose hair, the finely cut strips of deerskin, or, in some instances, the tough stems of river and swamp grasses twisted, braided and interwoven in every conceivable manner, and varied along the depth of the fringes by small perforated shells, teeth of animals, seeds of pine, or other shapely and hard substances which gave variety and added weight. Beads of bone and shell are not uncommon, or small bits of hammered metal. In one or two instances I have seen long deerskin fringes with stained or painted designs, emphasized with seeds or shells at centers of circles, or corners of zigzags. This ingenious use of a decorative fringe gave an effect of elaborate ornament with comparatively small labor.  Perhaps the best lesson we have to learn from this bygone phase of decorative effort is in the possibilities of genuine art, where scant materials of effect are available.  A thoughtful and exact study of early Indian art gives abundant indication of the effect of intimacy with the moods and phenomena of Nature, incident to the lives of an outdoor people.  Many of the designs which decorate the larger pieces, like shirts and blankets, were evidently so inspired. The designs of lengthened and unequal zigzags are lightning flashes translated into embroidery; the lateral lines of broken direction are water waves moving in masses. There are clouds and stars and moons to be found among them, and if we could interpret them we might even find records of the sensations with which they were regarded.  [Illustration: MAN'S JACKET OF PORCUPINE QUILLWORK Made by Sioux Indians.  _Courtesy American Museum of Natural History, New York_]  [Illustration: MAN'S JACKET OF PORCUPINE QUILLWORK Made by Plains Indians.  _Courtesy of American Museum of Natural History, New York_]  It would seem to argue a want of inventive faculty, that the aboriginal women never conceived the idea of weaving fibers together in textiles, but were contented with the skins of animals for warmth of body covering. The two alternatives of so close and warm a substance as tanned skins, or nakedness, seem to a civilized mind to demand some intermediate substance. This, however, was not felt as a want, at least not to the extent of inspiring a textile. Perhaps we should never have had the unique porcupine quill embroidery except for the close-grained skin foundation, which made it possible and permanent. Certainly the cleverness with which the idea of weaving has been used in the evolution of the Indian blanket shows that only the initial thought was lacking. The subsequent use of the arts of spinning and weaving, with the retention of the original idea of decoration in design and coloring, has made the Indian blanket an article of great commercial value.  Fortunately, these productions are valuable to their producers, and even to other members of the tribes, and were carefully preserved from casualties, so that there are still many examples of Indian manufacture, such as belts of wampum, and headbands of ceremony, to be found among existing tribes.  These early specimens are not only intrinsically valuable, but give many a clue to what may be called the spiritual side of the aborigines. They had not learned the limits of representation, and as this history deals with results of life and not with the impulse toward expression which lies at the root of design, we need not attempt more than a suggestion of some of the results. The unguided impulses of Indian art, as seen or imagined in their work, lies behind the work itself and can be read only by its materialization.     CHAPTER II -- THE CREWELWORK OF OUR PURITAN MOTHERS   The crewelwork of New England was the first ornamental stitchery practiced in this country by women of European race, and in their hands made its first appearance even during the days of privation and nights of fear which were their portion in this strange new world to which they had come.  The seed of it was brought by that winged creature of destiny, the _Mayflower_, hidden in the folds or decorating the borders of the precious household linen which was a part of the gear of the first Pilgrims. In its hollow interior there was room for bed dressings and table napery, even when the high-posted bedsteads and tables which they had adorned were abandoned, or exchanged for peace of mind and liberty of action.  It may have declared itself in the very first years of settlement, before they had encountered the savage antagonism of the aborigines, and while they still had only the privations incident to pioneer life; or it may have been after the long struggle for ascendancy and possession was over, and they could settle down in hard-won homes. Upon neighboring or contiguous farms there they gradually drew together the threads of memory concerning former peaceful occupations, and wove them once more into the warp of daily life. They could visit one another, exchanging domestic experiences, or reminiscences of spiritual struggles of their own or of fellow Pilgrims, and old-time hand occupations would be a mutual lullaby and an exorcism of anxiety.  The real beginning of embroidery as a national art was probably at a later period, for its previous practice would be but a continuation of old-world occupations or diversions of life.  The devoted mothers of the American race, who sailed the seas in those far-off days, might have brought some favorite \"piece\" of embroidery among their most intimate belongings, wherewithal to while away the hours of weary days upon the limitless breadths of ocean. There would be intervals of calm between storms, and periods when even the merest shred of a home-practiced art would be doubly and trebly valued, like a piece of heavenly raiment to a naked and banished angel.  [Illustration: CREWEL DESIGN, drawn and colored, which dates back to Colonial times.  _In the possession of the Dunham family of Cooperstown._]  The most natural effort of the woman standing in the midst of such new and strenuous conditions as surrounded the Pilgrim mothers in America, would be to reproduce something which had meant peace and tranquillity in former days. We can imagine her, searching the closely packed iron-bound chests which held most of the worldly goods of the traversing pilgrims--those famous chests, the boards of which had been carefully doweled and faithfully put together to resist outward and inward pressure--packed and repacked with constant misgivings and hopeful foresight. In those crowded treasure chests it was possible there might be found skeins of crewel, and even working patterns which some hopeful instinct had prompted her to preserve.  While the Puritan mother was scheming to add embroidery to her occupations, she did not forget to train each small maid of the family to the use of the needle. Ruth and Peace and Harmony and Mercy made their samplers as faithfully as though they were growing up under the shade of the apple trees of old England instead of among the blackened stumps of newly cut forests.  So the old art survived its transplantation and rooted itself in spite of storms of terror, and during and after the test of fire and blood, and spread, after the manner of art and knowledge, until it became the joy and comfort of a new race, a vehicle of feminine dexterity and an expression of the creative instinct with which in a greater or lesser degree we are all endowed.  We can easily believe that stores of linen and precious china, as well as the small wheels for the spinning of the flax, could not be denied to the devoted women who chose to share the hard fortunes of their Pilgrim"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24166"],["title","The Destroyers (#1)"],["body","the seal, then carefully removed the glass stopper and sniffed at the open mouth of the beautiful bottle. \"Hm-m-m! Say!\" Then he set the bottle down carefully on the table. \"You're the guest, Russ, so you can pour. That tea ready yet, Memi?\"  \"Coming right up,\" said his wife gratefully. \"Coming right up.\"  Anketam watched Russat carefully pour brandy into the cups of hot, spicy tea that Memi set before them. Then he looked up, grinned at his wife, and said: \"Pour yourself a cup, honey. This is an occasion. A big occasion.\"  She nodded quickly, very pleased, and went over to get another cup.  \"What brings you up here, Russ?\" Anketam asked. \"I hope you didn't just decide to pick up a bottle of your Chief's brandy and then take off.\" He chuckled after he said it, but he was more serious than he let on. He actually worried about Russat at times. The boy might just take it in his head to do something silly.  Russat laughed and shook his head. \"No, no. I'm not crazy, and I'm not stupid--at least, I think not. No; I got to go up to Chromdin. My Chief is sending word that he's ready to supply goods for the war.\"  Anketam frowned. He'd heard that there might be war, of course. There had been all kinds of rumors about how some of the Chiefs were all for fighting, but Anketam didn't pay much attention to these rumors. In the first place, he knew that it was none of his business; in the second place, he didn't think there would be any war. Why should anyone pick on Xedii?  What war would mean if it did come, Anketam had no idea, but he didn't think the Chiefs would get into a war they couldn't finish. And, he repeated to himself, he didn't believe there would be a war.  He said as much to Russat.  His brother looked up at him in surprise. \"You mean you haven't heard?\"  \"Heard what?\"  \"Why, the war's already started. Sure. Five, six days ago. We're at war, Ank.\"  Anketam's frown grew deeper. He knew that there were other planets besides Xedii; he had heard that some of the stars in the sky were planets and suns. He didn't really understand how that could be, but even The Chief had said it was true, so Anketam accepted it as he did the truth about God. It was so, and that was enough for Anketam. Why should he bother himself with other people's business?  But--_war_?  Why?  \"How'd it happen?\" he asked.  Russat sipped at his hot drink before answering. Behind him, Memi moved slowly around the cooker, pretending to be finishing the meal, pretending not to be listening.  \"Well, I don't have all the information,\" Russat said, pinching his little short beard between thumb and forefinger. \"But I do know that the Chiefs didn't want the embassy in Chromdin.\"  \"No,\" said Anketam. \"I suppose not.\"  \"I understand they have been making all kinds of threats,\" Russat said. \"Trying to tell everybody what to do. They think they run all of Creation, I guess. Anyway, they were told to pull out right after the last harvest. They refused to do it, and for a while nobody did anything. Then, last week, the President ordered the Army to throw 'em out--bag and baggage. There was some fighting, I understand, but they got out finally. Now they've said they're going to smash us.\" He grinned.  Anketam said: \"What's so funny?\"  \"Oh, they won't do anything,\" said Russat. \"They fume and fuss a lot, but they won't do anything.\"  \"I hope not,\" said Anketam. He finished the last of his spiked tea, and Memi poured him another one. \"I don't see how they have any right to tell us how to live or how to run our own homes. They ought to mind their own business and leave us alone.\"  \"You two finish those drinks,\" said Memi, \"and quit talking about wars. The food will be ready pretty quickly.\"  \"Good,\" said Anketam. \"I'm starved.\" And, he admitted to himself, the brandy and hot tea had gone to his head. A good meal would make him feel better.  Russat said: \"I don't get much of a chance to eat Memi's cooking; I'll sure like this meal.\"  \"You can stay for breakfast in the morning, can't you?\" Anketam asked.  \"Oh, I wouldn't want to put you to all that trouble. I have to be up to your Chief's house before sunrise.\"  \"We get up before sunrise,\" Anketam said flatly. \"You can stay for breakfast.\"   II  The spring planting did well. The rains didn't come until after the seedlings had taken root and anchored themselves well into the soil, and the rows showed no signs of heavy bruising. Anketam had been watching one section in particular, where young Basom had planted. Basom had a tendency to do a sloppy job, and if it had showed up as bruised or poorly planted seedlings, Anketam would have seen to it that Basom got what was coming to him.  But the section looked as good as anyone else's, so Anketam said nothing to Basom.  Russat had come back after twenty days and reported that there was an awful lot of fuss in Chromdin, but nothing was really developing. Then he had gone on back home.  As spring became summer, Anketam pushed the war out of his mind. Evidently, there wasn't going to be any real shooting. Except that two of The Chief's sons had gone off to join the Army, things remained the same as always. Life went on as it had.  The summer was hot and almost windless. Work became all but impossible, except during the early morning and late afternoon. Fortunately, there wasn't much that had to be done. At this stage of their growth, the plants pretty much took care of themselves.  Anketam spent most of his time fishing. He and Jacovik and some of the others would go down to the river and sit under the shade trees, out of the sun, and dangle their lines in the water. It really didn't matter if they caught much or not; the purpose of fishing was to loaf and get away from the heat, not to catch fish. Even so, they always managed to bring home enough for a good meal at the end of the day.  The day that the war intruded on Anketam's consciousness again had started off just like any other day. Anketam got his fishing gear together, including a lunch that Memi had packed for him, and gone over to pick up Blejjo.  Blejjo was the oldest man in the village. Some said he was over a hundred, but Blejjo himself only admitted to eighty. He'd been retired a long time back, and his only duties now were little odd jobs that were easy enough, even for an old man. Not that there was anything feeble about old Blejjo; he still looked and acted spry enough.  He was sitting on his front porch, talking to young Basom, when Anketam came up.  The old man grinned. \"Hello, Ank. You figure on getting a few more fish today?\"  \"Why not? The river's full of 'em. Come along.\"  \"Don't see why not,\" said Blejjo. \"What do you think, Basom?\"  The younger man smiled and shook his head. \"I'll stay around home, I think. I'm too lazy today to go to all that effort.\"  [Illustration]  \"Too lazy to loaf,\" said Blejjo, laughing. \"That's as lazy as I ever heard.\"  Anketam smiled, but he didn't say anything. Basom _was_ lazy, but Anketam never mentioned it unless the boy didn't get his work done. Leave that sort of kidding up to the others; it wasn't good for a supervisor to ride his men unless it was necessary for discipline.  Basom was a powerful young man, tall and well-proportioned. If the truth were known, he probably had the ability to get a good job from The Chief--become a secretary or something, like Russat. But he was sloppy in his work, and, as Blejjo had said, lazy. His saving grace was the fact that he took things as they came; he never showed any resentment towards Anketam if he was rebuked for not doing his work well, and he honestly tried to do better--for a while, at least.  \"Not too lazy to loaf,\" Basom said in self-defense. \"Just too lazy to walk four miles to loaf when I can do it here.\"  Old Blejjo was taking his fishing gear down from the rack on the porch. Without looking around, he said: \"Cooler down by the river.\"  \"By the time I walked there,\" said Basom philosophically, \"walking through all that sun, I'd be so hot it would take me two hours to cool down to where I am now, and another two hours to cool down any more. That's four hours wasted. Now--\" He looked at Anketam with a sly grin. \"Now, if you two wanted to carry me, I'd be much obliged. Anketam, you could carry me piggyback, while Blejjo goes over to fetch my pole. If you'd do that, I believe I could see my way clear to going fishing with you.\"  Anketam shook his head positively. \"I'm afraid the sun would do you in, anyway.\"  \"Maybe you'd like The Chief to carry you,\" said Blejjo. There was a bite in his voice.  \"Now, wait,\" Basom said apprehensively, \"I didn't say anything like that. I didn't mean it that way.\"  Blejjo pointed his fishing pole at the youth. \"You ought to be thankful you've got Anketam for a supervisor. There's some supers who'd boot you good for a crack like that.\"  Basom cast appealing eyes at Anketam. \"I _am_ thankful! You know I am! Why, you're the best super in the barony! Everybody knows that. I was only kidding. You know that.\"  Before Anketam could say anything, the old man said: \"You can bet your life that no other super in this barony would put up with your laziness!\"  \"Now, Blejjo,\" said Anketam, \"leave the boy alone. He meant no harm. If he needs talking to, I'll do the talking.\"  Basom looked gratefully reprieved.  \"Sorry, Ank,\" said Blejjo. \"It's just that some of these young people have no respect for their elders.\" He looked at Basom and smiled. \"Didn't mean to take it out on you, Bas. There's a lot worse than you.\" Then, changing his tone: \"Sure you don't want to come with us?\"  Basom looked apologetic, but he stuck to his guns. \"No. Thanks again, but--\" He grinned self-consciously. \"To be honest, I was thinking of going over to see Zillia. Her dad said I could come.\"  Anketam grinned at the boy. \"Well, now, that's an excuse I'll accept. Come on, Blejjo, this is not a sport for old men like us. Fishing is more our speed.\"  Chuckling, Blejjo shouldered his fishing pole, and the two men started down"]]]
