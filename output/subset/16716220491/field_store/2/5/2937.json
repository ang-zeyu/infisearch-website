If they can control the movement of millions of cars, there's no reason why they can't control a spaceship.\"  \"No,\" I said, \"I suppose not.\" I thought it over for a second, then asked, \"But what do your robotics men say is causing the malfunctions?\"  \"That's where the problem comes in, Mr. Oak.\" He pursed his pudgy lips, and his eyes narrowed. \"The opinions are divided. Some of the men say it's simply a case of engineering failure--that the bugs haven't been worked out of this new combination, but that as soon as they are, everything will work as smoothly as butter. Others say that only deliberate tampering could cause those failures. And still others say that there's not enough evidence to prove either of those theories is correct.\"  \"But your opinion is that it's sabotage?\"  \"Exactly,\" said Ravenhurst, \"and I know who is doing it and why.\"  I didn't try to conceal the little bit of surprise that gave me. \"You know the man who's responsible?\"  He shook his head rapidly, making his jowls wobble. \"I didn't mean that. It's not a single man; it's a group.\"  \"Maybe you'd better go into a little more detail on that, Mr. Ravenhurst.\"  He nodded, and this time his jowls bobbled instead of wobbled. \"Some group at Viking is trying to run me out of the managerial business. They want Viking to be managed by Thurston Enterprises; they evidently think they can get a better deal from him than they can from me. If the McGuire project fails, they'll have a good chance of convincing the stock-holders that the fault lies with Ravenhurst. You follow?\"  \"So far,\" I said. \"Do you think Thurston's behind this, then?\"  \"I don't know,\" he said slowly. \"He might be, or he might not. If he is, that's perfectly legitimate business tactics. He's got a perfect right to try to get more business for himself if he wants to. I've undercut him a couple of times.  \"But I don't think he's too deeply involved, if he's involved at all. This smacks of a personal attack against me, and I don't think that's Thurston's type of play.  \"You see, things are a little touchy right now. I won't go into details, but you know what the political situation is at the moment.  \"It works this way, as far as Viking is concerned: If I lose the managerial contract at Viking, a couple of my other contracts will go by the board, too--especially if it's proved that I've been lax in management or have been expending credit needlessly.  \"These other two companies are actually a little shaky at the moment; I've only been managing them for a little over a year in one case and two years in the other. Their assets have come up since I took over, but they'd still dump me if they thought I was reckless.\"  \"How can they do that?\" I asked. \"You have a contract, don't you?\"  \"Certainly. They wouldn't break it. But they'd likely ask the Government Inspectors to step in and check every step of the managerial work. Now, you and I and everybody else knows that you have to cut corners to make a business successful. If the GI's step in, that will have to stop--which means we'll show a loss heavy enough to put us out. We'll be forced to sell the contract for a pittance.  \"Well, then. If Viking goes, and these other two corporations go, it'll begin to look as if Ravenhurst can't take care of himself and his companies anymore. Others will climb on the bandwagon. Contracts that are coming up for renewal will be reconsidered instead of continuing automatically. I think you can see where that would lead eventually.\"  I did. You don't go into the managing business these days unless you have plenty on the ball. You've got to know all the principles and all the tricks of organization and communication, and you've got to be able to waltz your way around all the roadblocks that are caused by Government laws--some of which have been floating around on the books of one nation or another for two or three centuries.  Did you know that there's a law on the American statute books that forbids the landing of a spaceship within one hundred miles of a city? That was passed back when they were using rockets, but it's never been repealed. Technically, then, it's almost impossible to land a ship anywhere on the North American continent. Long Island Spaceport is openly flouting the law, if you want to look at it that way.  A managerial combine has to know all those little things and know how to get around them. It has to be able to have the confidence of the stock-holders of a corporation--if it's run on the Western Plan--or the confidence of communal owners if it's run on the Eastern Plan.  Something like this could snowball on Ravenhurst. It isn't only the rats that desert a sinking ship; so does anyone else who has any sense.  \"What I want to know, Mr. Oak,\" Ravenhurst continued, \"is who is behind this plot, whether an individual or a group. I want to know identity and motivation.\"  \"Is that all?\" I eyed him skeptically.  \"No. Of course not. I want you to make sure that the MG-YR-7 isn't sabotaged. I want you to make sure it's protected from whatever kind of monkey wrenches are being thrown into its works.\"  \"It's nearly ready for testing now, isn't it?\" I asked.  \"It is ready. It seems to be in perfect condition so far. Viking is already looking for a test pilot. It's still in working order now, and I want to be certain that it will remain so.\"  I cocked my head to one side and gave him my Interrogative And Suspicious Glance--Number 9 in the manual. \"You didn't do any checking on the first six McGuire ships. You wait until this one is done before calling me. Why the delay, Ravenhurst?\"  It didn't faze him. \"I became suspicious after McGuire 6 failed. I put Colonel Brock on it.\"  I nodded. I'd had dealings with Brock. He was head of Ravenhurst's Security Guard. \"Brock didn't get anywhere,\" I said.  \"He did not. His own face is too well known for him to have investigated personally, and he's not enough of an actor to get away with using a plexiskin mask. He had to use underlings. And I'm afraid some of them might be in the pay of the ... ah ... opposition. They got nowhere.\"  \"In other words, you may have spies in your own organization who are working with the Viking group. Very interesting. That means they know I'm working for you, which will effectively seal me up, too. You might as well have kept Brock on the job.\"  He smiled in a smug, superior sort of way that some men might have resented. I did. Even though I'd fed him the line so that he could feel superior, knowing that a smart operator like Ravenhurst would already have covered his tracks. I couldn't help wishing I'd told him simply to trot out his cover story instead of letting him think I believed it had never occurred to either of us before.  \"As far as my staff knows, Mr. Oak, you are here to escort my daughter, Jaqueline, to Braunsville, Luna. You will, naturally, have to take her to Ceres in your flitterboat, where you will wait for a specially chartered ship to take you both to Luna. That will be a week after you arrive. Since the McGuire 7 is to be tested within three days, that should give you ample time.\"  \"If it doesn't?\"  \"We will consider that possibility if and when it becomes probable. I have a great deal of faith in you.\"  \"Thanks. One more thing: why do you think anybody will swallow the idea that your daughter needs a private bodyguard to escort her to Braunsville?\"  His smile broadened a little. \"You have not met my daughter, Mr. Oak. Jaqueline takes after me in a great many respects, not the least of which is her desire to have things her own way and submit to no man's yoke, as the saying goes. I have had a difficult time with her, sir; a difficult time. It is and has been a matter of steering a narrow course between the Scylla of breaking her spirit with too much discipline and the Charybdis of allowing her to ruin her life by letting her go hog wild. She is seventeen now, and the time has come to send her to a school where she will receive an education suitable to her potentialities and abilities, and discipline which will be suitable to her spirit.  \"Your job, Mr. Oak, will be to make sure she gets there. You are not a bodyguard in the sense that you must protect her from the people around her. Quite the contrary, _they_ may need protection from _her_. You are to make sure she arrives in Braunsville on schedule. She is perfectly capable of taking it in her head to go scooting off to Earth if you turn your back on her.\"  Still smiling, he refilled his glass. \"Do have some more Madeira, Mr. Oak. It's really an excellent year.\"  I let him refill my glass.  \"That, I think, will cover your real activities well enough. My daughter will, of course, take a tour of the plant on Ceres, which will allow you to do whatever work is necessary.\"  He smiled at me.  I didn't smile back.  \"Up till now, this sounded like a pretty nice assignment,\" I said. \"But I don't want it now. I can't take care of a teenage girl with a desire for the bright lights of Earth while I investigate a sabotage case.\"  I knew he had an out; I was just prodding him into springing it.  He did. \"Of course not. My daughter is not as scatterbrained as I have painted her. She is going to help you.\"  \"_Help_ me?\"  \"Exactly. You are ostensibly her bodyguard. If she turns up missing, you will, of course, leave no stone unturned to find her.\" He chuckled. \"And Ceres is a fairly large stone.\"  I thought it over. I still didn't like it too well, but if Jaqueline wasn't going to be too much trouble to take care of, it might work out. And if she did get to be too much trouble, I could see to it that she was unofficially detained for a while.  \"All right, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, \"you've got yourself a man for both jobs.\"  \"Both?\"  \"I find out who is trying to sabotage the McGuire ship, and I baby-sit for you. That's two jobs. And you're going to pay for both of them.\"  \"I expected to,\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24204"],["title","The Lost Despatch (#1)"],["body","trooper's figure was silhouetted against the sky in the brilliant moonlight. A mass of heavy hair had fallen down the rider's back.  \"By God! It's a woman!\" gasped Symonds, as he clutched his revolver.  A shot rang out, followed by a stifled cry; then silence, save for the galloping hoof beats growing fainter and fainter down the road in the direction of Washington.     CHAPTER II  BRAINS VS. BRAWN   Up Thirteenth Street came the measured tread of marching feet, and two companies of infantry turned the corner into New York Avenue. The soldiers marched with guns reversed and colors furled. A few passers-by stopped to watch the sad procession. Suddenly they were startled by peal on peal of merry laughter, which came from a bevy of girls standing in front of Stuntz's notion store. Instantly two officers left their places by the curb and walked over to the little group.  \"Your pardon, ladies,\" said Lloyd sternly. \"Why do you laugh at a soldier's funeral?\"  The young girl nearest him wheeled around, and inspected Lloyd from head to foot.  \"What's that to you, Mr. Yank?\" she demanded impudently.  \"Nothing to me, madam; but for you, perhaps, Old Capitol Prison.\"  \"Nonsense, Lloyd,\" exclaimed his companion, Major Goddard. \"I am sure the young ladies meant no intentional offense.\"  Lloyd's lips closed in a thin line, but before he could reply a girl standing in the background stepped forward and addressed him.  \"We meant no disrespect to the dead,\" she said, and her clear, bell-like voice instantly caught both men's attention. \"In fact, we did not notice the funeral; they are, alas, of too frequent occurrence these days to attract much attention.\"  \"Ah, indeed.\" Lloyd's tone betrayed his disbelief. \"And may I ask what you were laughing at?\"  \"Certainly; at Misery.\"  \"Misery?\" Lloyd's color rose. He hated to be made ridiculous, and a titter from the listening girls roused his temper. \"Is that another name for a funeral?\"  \"No, sir,\" demurely; \"it is the name of my dog.\"  \"Your dog?\"  \"Yes, my pet dog. You know, 'Misery loves company.'\" The soft, hazel eyes lighted with a mocking smile as she looked full at the two perplexed men. \"I'm 'company,'\" she added softly.  In silence Lloyd studied the girl's face with growing interest, A vague, elusive likeness haunted him. Where had he heard that voice before? At that instant the glint of her red-gold hair in the winter sunshine caught his eye. His unspoken question was answered.  \"Who's being arrested now?\" asked a quiet voice behind Lloyd, and a man, leaning heavily on his cane, pushed his way through the crowd that had collected about the girls. The slight, limping figure was well known in every section of Washington, and Lloyd stepped back respectfully to make room for Doctor John Boyd. It was the first time he had seen the famous surgeon at such close quarters, and he examined the grotesque old face with interest.  Doctor Boyd had lost none of the briskness of youth, despite his lameness, nor his fingers their skill, but his face was a mass of wrinkles. His keen, black eyes, bristling gray beard, predatory nose, and saturnine wit, together with his brusque manner, made strangers fear him. But their aversion was apt to change to idolatry when he became their physician.  \"What, Nancy Newton, you here?\" continued the surgeon, addressing the last speaker, \"and Belle Cary? Have you two girls been sassing our military friends?\" indicating the two officers with a wave of his hand.  \"Indeed, no, Doctor John,\" protested Nancy; \"such an idea never entered our heads. But these gentlemen don't seem to believe me.\"  Major Goddard stepped forward, and raised his cap.  \"The young lady is mistaken, doctor,\" he said gravely. \"We do believe her, notwithstanding,\" glancing quizzically at Nancy, \"that we have not yet seen her dog.\"  \"Misery!\" exclaimed the surgeon, laughing. \"So my four-footed friend has gotten you into hot water again, Nancy? I might have known it. Here's the rascal now.\"  Around the corner of Twelfth Street, with an air of conscious virtue, trotted the cause of all the trouble--a handsome, red-brown field spaniel. Robert Goddard, a lover of dogs, snapped his fingers and whistled, but Misery paid not the slightest attention to his blandishments. Wagging his tail frantically, he tore up to Nancy, and frisked about her.  \"Misery, give me that bone.\" Nancy stooped over, and endeavored to take it from the struggling dog. \"I cannot stop his eating in the streets. Oh, he's swallowed it!\" Misery choked violently, and looked with reproachful eyes at his mistress. \"You sinner,\" patting the soft brown body, \"come along--that is,\" addressing Lloyd, \"if you do not wish to detain us any longer.\"  \"You are at liberty to go.\" Lloyd bowed stiffly.  \"Hold on, Nancy; if you have no particular engagement, come with me to my office. I have a bottle of medicine to send your aunt,\" exclaimed Doctor Boyd hastily. \"Good evening, gentlemen.\" And he bowed curtly to Lloyd and his friend.  On reaching F Street, the group of girls separated, and Nancy accompanied Doctor Boyd to his office.  \"Go into the waiting room, Nancy,\" directed the surgeon. \"It won't take me a moment to write the directions on the label of the bottle.\"  Obediently Nancy entered the room, followed by Misery, and as the surgeon disappeared into his consulting office, she glanced keenly about her. The room was empty. Quickly she bent over her dog, and took off his round leather collar. Another searching glance about the room; then from a hollow cavity in the round collar, the opening of which was cleverly concealed by the buckle, she drew a tiny roll of tissue paper. Opening it, she read:      Find out Sheridan's future movements. Imperative.  Nancy dropped on her knees before the open grate, tossed the paper into the glowing embers, and watched it burn to the last scrap. A cold, wet nose against her hand roused her.  \"Misery, you darling.\" She stooped, and buried her face in the wriggling body. \"My little retriever!\" Misery licked her face ecstatically. \"If I only knew which way Sam went after giving you that message for me, much valuable time could be saved. As it is----\" Doctor Boyd's entrance cut short her whispered words.                       *      *      *      *      *  Lloyd and his friend, Major Goddard, watched Nancy and her companions out of sight; then continued on their way to Wormley's Hotel, each busy with his own thoughts. The grill room of that famous hostelry was half empty when they reached there, and they had no difficulty in securing a table in a secluded corner. While Lloyd was giving his order to the waiter, Colonel Baker stopped at their table.  \"Heard the news?\" he asked eagerly; then not waiting for an answer: \"They say at the department General Joe Johnston has been captured.\"  His words were overheard by Wormley, the colored proprietor, who was speaking to the head waiter.  \"'Scuse me, Colonel Baker,\" he said deferentially. \"You all ain't captured General Johnston. No, sah. I knows Marse Joe too well to b'lieve that.\"  Wormley was a privileged character, and his remark was received with good-natured laughter. Under cover of the noise, Baker whispered to Lloyd: \"_Stanton has discovered his cipher code book has been tampered with._ Meet me at my office at five o'clock.\"  \"All right, Colonel,\" and Baker departed.  By the time they had reached dessert, the grill room was deserted. Goddard lighted a cigar, and, lounging back in his chair, contemplated his host with keen interest.  \"I can't understand it, Lloyd,\" he said finally.  \"Understand what?\" replied Lloyd, roused from his abstraction.  \"Why you became a professional detective. With your social position, talents...\"  \"That's just it!\"  \"What?\"  \"My talents. If it had not been for them, I would have gone to West Point with you, Bob. But, above all else in the world I enjoy pitting my wits against another's--enjoy unravelling mysteries that baffle others. To me there is no excitement equal to a man hunt. I suppose in a way it is an inheritance; my father was a great criminal lawyer, and his father before him. When Pinkerton organized the Secret Service division of the army in '61, I went with him, thinking I could follow my chosen profession and serve my country at the same time. Besides,\" with a trace of bitterness in his voice, \"I owe society nothing; nor do I desire to associate with society people.\"  Goddard gazed sorrowfully at his friend. \"Hasn't the old wound healed, Lloyd?\" he asked softly.  \"No; nor ever will,\" was the brief response, and Lloyd's face grew stern with the pain of other years. \"As I told you, Bob, I was detailed here to solve a very serious problem for our government,\" he resumed, after a slight pause. \"Baker has rounded up and arrested all persons suspected of corresponding with the rebels, and sent some to Old Capitol Prison, and others through the lines to Richmond, where they can do us no harm. Most of these spies gave themselves away by their secesh talk, or by boasting of their ability to run the blockade.  \"But information of our armies' intended movements is still being carried out of Washington right under Baker's nose. It is imperative that this leak be stopped at once, or the Union forces may suffer another Bull Run. Baker and the provost marshal of the district have tried every means in their power to learn the methods and the identity of this spy, but so far without success.\"  \"But have you found no trace in your search?\" inquired Goddard eagerly.  \"Until to-day I had only a theory; now I have a clue, a faint one, but----\" Lloyd paused and glanced about the room to see that he was not overheard. They had the place to themselves, save for their waiter, Sam, who was busy resetting a table in the opposite corner. \"I have told you, Bob, how I came to get this wound\"--Lloyd touched his temple--\"when on my way to Poolesville.\" Goddard nodded assent. \"But I did not tell you that before the supposed trooper made good his"]]]
