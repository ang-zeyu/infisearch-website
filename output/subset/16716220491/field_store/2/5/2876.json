Tom dropped it back without even opening the flap. He closed the box and took a deep breath. \"Then you really believe that it was an accident and nothing more?\" he said to the major.  Major Briarton shook his head. \"What I think or don't think doesn't make any difference. It just doesn't matter. In order to do anything, I've got to have evidence, and there just isn't any evidence. I can't even take a ship out there for a second look, with the evidence I have, and that's all there is to it.\"  \"But you think that maybe it wasn't an accident, just the same,\" Tom pursued.  The major hesitated. Then he shook his head again. \"I'm sorry, but I've got to stand on what I've said. And I think you'd better stand on it, too. There's nothing else to be done.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It should have been enough, but it wasn't. As Tom Hunter walked with his brother down the broad Upper Ramp to the business section of Sun Lake City, he could not shake off the feeling of helpless anger, the growing conviction that Roger Hunter's death involved something more than the tragic accident in space that Major Briarton had insisted it was.  \"He didn't tell us everything he knew,\" Tom said fiercely. \"He didn't say everything he wanted to say, either. He doesn't think it was an accident any more than I do.\"  \"How do you know, are you a mind reader?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well, Dad wasn't a superman, either. He was taking an awful risk, trying to work a mining rig by himself, and he had a bad break. Why do you have to have somebody to blame for it?\"  \"Keep talking,\" Tom said. \"You'll convince yourself yet.\"  Greg just jammed his hands in his pockets, and they walked in silence for a moment.  For Tom and Greg Hunter, Sun Lake City had always been home. Now they walked along the Main Concourse, Tom with the aluminum box under his arm, Greg with his own spacer's pack thrown over his shoulder. They didn't talk; rather than being drawn closer by the news of the tragedy, it seemed that they had drawn farther apart, as though the one common link that had held them together had suddenly been broken.  Finally Tom broke the silence. \"At least there's one thing we can do,\" he said. \"I'm going to call Johnny Coombs.\"  He shortly found a phone booth and dialed a number. Johnny had been a friend of the family for years; he and Roger Hunter had been partners in many mining ventures in the Asteroid Belt before Roger had taken his position with Jupiter Equilateral. If Johnny had any suspicions that Roger Hunter's accident had been more than an accident, he certainly would not hesitate to voice them....  After a dozen rings, Tom hung up, tried another number. There was no answer there, either. Frowning, Tom rang the city's central paging system. \"Put in a personal call for Johnny Coombs,\" he said when the \"record\" signal flashed on. \"Tell him to contact the Hunters when he comes in. We'll be at home....\"  They resumed their silent walk. When they reached H wing on the fourth level, they turned right down an apartment corridor, and stopped in front of a familiar doorway. Tom pressed his palm against the lock-plate, and the door swung open.  It was home to them, the only home they had ever known. Soft lights sprang up on the walls of the apartment as the door opened. Tom saw the old bookcases lining the walls, the drafting-board and light at the far end of the room, the simple chairs and dining table, the door which led into the bedroom and kitchen beyond. The room had the slightly disheveled look that it had had ever since Mom had died ... a slipper on the floor here, a book face down on the couch there....  It looked as though Dad had just stepped out for an hour or so.  Tom was three steps into the room before he saw the visitor.  The man was sitting comfortably in Roger Hunter's easy chair, a short, fat man with round pink cheeks that sagged a little and a double chin that rested on his neck scarf. There were two other men in the room, both large and broad-shouldered; one of them nodded to the fat man, and moved to stand between the boys and the door.  The fat man was out of his seat before the boys could speak, smiling at them and holding out his hand. \"I wanted to be sure to see you before you left the city,\" he was saying, \"so we just came on in to wait. I hope you don't mind our ... butting in, so to speak.\" He chuckled, looking from one twin to the other. \"You don't know me, I suppose. I'm Merrill Tawney. Representing Jupiter Equilateral, you know.\"  Tom took the card he was holding out, looked at the name and the tiny gold symbol in the corner, a letter \"J\" in the center of a triangle. He handed the card to Greg. \"I've seen you before,\" he told the fat man. \"What do you want with us?\"  Tawney smiled again, spreading his hands. \"We've heard about the tragedy, of course. A shocking thing ... Roger was one of our group so recently. We wanted you to know that if there is anything at all we can do to help, we'd be only too glad....\"  \"Thanks,\" Greg said. \"But we're doing just fine.\"  Tawney's smile tightened a little, but he hung onto it. \"I always felt close to your father,\" he said. \"All of us at Jupiter Equilateral did. We were all sorry to see him leave.\"  \"I bet you were,\" Greg said, \"he was the best mining engineer you ever had. But Dad could never stand liars, or crooked ways of doing business.\"  One of the men started for Greg, but the fat man stopped him with a wave of his hand. \"We had our differences of opinion,\" he said. \"We saw things one way, your father saw them another way. But he was a fine man, one of the finest....\"  \"Look, Mr. Tawney, you'd better say what you came to say and get out of here,\" Greg said dangerously, \"before we give your friends here something to do.\"  \"I merely came to offer you some help,\" Tawney said. He was no longer smiling. \"Since your father's death, you two have acquired certain responsibilities. I thought we might relieve you of some of them.\"  \"What sort of responsibilities?\"  \"You have an unmanned orbit-ship which is now a derelict in the Asteroid Belt. You have a scout-ship out there also. You can't just leave them there as a navigation hazard to every ship traveling in the sector. There are also a few mining claims which aren't going to be of much value to you now.\"  \"I see,\" Greg said. \"Are you offering to buy Dad's mining rig?\"  \"Well, I doubt very much that we'd have any use for it, as such. But we could save you the trouble of going out there to haul it in.\"  \"That's very thoughtful,\" Greg said. \"How much are you offering?\"  Tom looked up in alarm. \"Wait a minute,\" he said. \"That rig's not for sale....\"  \"How much?\" Greg repeated.  \"Forty thousand dollars,\" Merrill Tawney said. \"Ship, rig and claims. We'll even pay the transfer tax.\"  Tom stared at the man, wondering if he had heard right. He knew what Roger Hunter had paid for the rig; he had been with Dad when the papers were signed. Tawney's offer was three times as much as the rig was worth.  But Greg was shaking his head. \"I don't think we could sell at that price.\"  The fat man's hands fluttered. \"You understand that those ships are hardly suited to a major mining operation like ours,\" he said, \"and the claims....\" He dismissed them with a wave of his hand. \"Still, we'd want you to be happy with the price. Say, forty-five thousand?\"  Greg hesitated, shook his head again. \"I guess we'd better think it over, Mr. Tawney.\"  \"Fifty thousand is absolutely the top,\" Tawney said sharply. \"I have the papers right here, drawn up for your signatures, but I'm afraid we can't hold the offer open.\"  \"I don't know, we might want to do some mining ourselves,\" Greg said. \"For all we know, Dad might have struck some rich ore on one of those claims.\"  Tawney laughed. \"I hardly think so. Those claims were all Jupiter Equilateral rejects. Our own engineers found nothing but low grade ore on any of them.\"  \"Still, it might be fun to look.\"  \"It could be very expensive fun. Asteroid mining is a dangerous business, even for experts. For amateurs....\" Tawney spread his hands. \"Accidents occur....\"  \"Yes, we've heard about those accidents,\" Greg said coldly. \"I don't think we're quite ready to sell, Mr. Tawney. We may never be ready to sell to you, so don't stop breathing until we call you. Now if there's nothing else, why don't you take your friends and go somewhere else?\"  The fat man scowled; he started to say something more, then saw the look on Greg's face, and shrugged. \"I'd advise you to give it some careful thought,\" he said as he started for the door. \"It might be very foolish for you to try to use that rig.\"  Smiling, Greg closed the door in his face. Then he turned and winked at Tom. \"Great fellow, Mr. Tawney. He almost had me sold.\"  \"So I noticed,\" Tom said. \"For a while I thought you were serious.\"  \"Well, we found out how high they'd go. That's a very generous outfit Mr. Tawney works for.\"  \"Or else a very crooked one,\" Tom said. \"Are you wondering the same thing I'm wondering?\"  \"Yes,\" Greg said slowly. \"I think I am.\"  \"Then that makes three of us,\" a heavy voice rumbled from the bedroom door.         *       *       *       *       *  Johnny Coombs was a tall man, so thin he was almost gangling, with a long nose and shaggy eyebrows jutting out over his eyes. With his rudely cropped hair and his huge hands, he looked like a caricature of a frontier Mars-farmer, but the blue eyes under the eyebrows were not dull.  \"Johnny!\" Tom cried. \"We were trying to find you.\"  \"I know,\" Johnny said. \"So have a lot of other people, includin' your friends there.\"  \"Well, did you hear what Tawney wanted?\"  \"I'm not so quick on my feet any more,\" Johnny Coombs said, \"but I got nothin' wrong with my ears.\" He scratched his jaw and looked up sharply at Greg. \"Not many people nowadays get a chance to bargain with Merrill Tawney.\"  Greg shrugged. \"He named a price and I didn't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23887"],["title","Strange Stories from History for Young People (#1)"],["body","Indians, and other lawless persons, whom he organized into a strong company of robbers. Garçon made the fort his stronghold, and began to plunder the country round about as thoroughly as any robber baron or Italian bandit ever did, sometimes venturing across the border into the United States.  All this was so annoying and so threatening to our frontier settlements in Georgia, that General Jackson demanded of the Spanish authorities that they should reduce the place; and they would have been glad enough to do so, probably, if it had been possible, because the banditti plundered Spanish as well as other settlements. But the Spanish governor had no force at command, and could do nothing, and so the fort remained, a standing menace to the American borders.  Matters were in this position in the spring of 1816, when General Gaines was sent to fortify our frontier at the point where the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers unite to form the Appalachicola. In June of that year some stores for General Gaines's forces were sent by sea from New Orleans. The vessels carrying them were to go up the Appalachicola, and General Gaines was not sure that the little fleet would be permitted to pass the robbers' stronghold, which had come to be called the Negro Fort. Accordingly, he sent Colonel Clinch with a small force down the river, to render any assistance that might be necessary. On the way Colonel Clinch was joined by a band of Seminoles, who wanted to recapture the fort on their own account, and the two bodies determined to act together.  Meantime the two schooners with supplies and the two gun-boats sent to guard them had arrived at the mouth of the river; and when the commandant tried to hold a conference with Garçon, the ship's boat, bearing a white flag, was fired upon.  Running short of water while lying off the river's mouth, the officers of the fleet sent out a boat to procure a supply. This boat was armed with a swivel and muskets, and was commanded by Midshipman Luffborough. The boat went into the mouth of the river, and, seeing a negro on shore, Midshipman Luffborough landed to ask for fresh-water supplies. Garçon, with some of his men, lay in ambush at the spot, and while the officer talked with the negro the concealed men fired upon the boat, killing Luffborough and two of his men. One man got away by swimming, and was picked up by the fleet; two others were taken prisoners, and, as was afterwards learned, Garçon coated them with tar and burned them to death.  It would not do to send more boats ashore, and so the little squadron lay together awaiting orders from Colonel Clinch. That officer, as he approached the fort, captured a negro, who wore a white man's scalp at his belt, and from him he learned of the massacre of Luffborough's party. There was no further occasion for doubt as to what was to be done. Colonel Clinch determined to reduce the fort at any cost, although the operation promised to be a very difficult one.  Placing his men in line of battle, he sent a courier to the fleet, ordering the gun-boats to come up and help in the attack. The Seminoles made many demonstrations against the works, and the negroes replied with their cannon. Garçon had raised his flags--a red one and a British Union-jack--and whenever he caught sight of the Indians or the Americans, he shelled them vigorously with his 32-pounder.  Three or four days were passed in this way, while the gun-boats were slowly making their way up the river. It was Colonel Clinch's purpose to have the gun-boats shell the fort, while he should storm it on the land side. The work promised to be bloody, and it was necessary to bring all the available force to bear at once. There were no siege-guns at hand, or anywhere within reach, and the only way to reduce the fort was for the small force of soldiers--numbering only one hundred and sixteen men--to rush upon it, receiving the fire of its heavy artillery, and climb over its parapets in the face of a murderous fire of small-arms. Garçon had with him three hundred and thirty-four men, so that, besides having strong defensive works and an abundant supply of large cannon, his force outnumbered Colonel Clinch's nearly three to one. It is true that the American officer had the band of Seminoles with him, but they were entirely worthless for determined work of the kind that the white men had to do. Even while lying in the woods at a distance, waiting for the gun-boats to come up, the Indians became utterly demoralized under the fire of Garçon's 32-pounder. There was nothing to be done, however, by way of improving the prospect, which was certainly hopeless enough. One hundred and sixteen white men had the Negro Fort to storm, notwithstanding its strength and the overwhelming force that defended it. But those one hundred and sixteen men were American soldiers, under command of a brave and resolute officer, who had made up his mind that the fort could be taken, and they were prepared to follow their leader up to the muzzle of the guns and over the ramparts, there to fight the question out in a hand-to-hand struggle with the desperadoes inside.  Finally the gun-boats arrived, and preparations were made for the attack. Sailing-master Jairus Loomis, the commandant of the little fleet, cast his anchors under the guns of the Negro Fort at five o'clock in the morning on the 27th of July, 1816. The fort at once opened fire, and it seemed impossible for the little vessels to endure the storm of shot and shell that rained upon them from the ramparts above. They replied vigorously, however, but with no effect. Their guns were too small to make any impression upon the heavy earthen walls of the fortress.  Sailing-master Loomis had roused his ship's cook early that morning, and had given him a strange breakfast to cook. He had ordered him to make all the fire he could in his galley, and to fill the fire with cannon-balls. Not long after the bombardment began the cook reported that breakfast was ready; that is to say, that the cannon-balls were red-hot. Loomis trained one of his guns with his own hands so that its shot should fall within the fort, instead of burying itself in the ramparts, and this gun was at once loaded with a red-hot shot. The word was given, the match applied, and the glowing missile sped on its way. A few seconds later the earth shook and quivered, a deafening roar stunned the sailors, and a vast cloud of smoke filled the air, shutting out the sun.  The hot shot had fallen into the great magazine, where there were hundreds of barrels of gunpowder, and the Negro Fort was no more. It had been literally blown to atoms in a second.  The slaughter was frightful. There were, as we know already, three hundred and thirty-four men in the fort, and two hundred and seventy of them were killed outright by the explosion. All the rest, except three men who miraculously escaped injury, were wounded, most of them so badly that they died soon afterwards.  One of the three men who escaped the explosion unhurt was Garçon himself. Bad as this bandit chief was, Colonel Clinch would have spared his life, but it happened that he fell into the hands of the sailors from the gun-boat; and when they learned that Garçon had tarred and burned their comrades whom he had captured in the attack on Luffborough's boat, they turned him over to the infuriated Seminoles, who put him to death in their own cruel way.  [Illustration: BREAKFAST AND BATTLE.]  This is the history of a strange affair, which at one time promised to give the government of the United States no little trouble, even threatening to involve us in a war with Spain, for the fort was on Spanish territory, and the Spaniards naturally resented an invasion of their soil.     A WAR FOR AN ARCHBISHOP.  THE CURIOUS STORY OF VLADIMIR THE GREAT.   In the latter part of the tenth century Sviatozlaf was Grand Prince of Russia. He was a powerful prince, but a turbulent one, and he behaved so ill towards his neighbors that, when an opportunity offered, one of them converted his skull into a gold-mounted drinking-cup, with an inscription upon it, and his dominions were parcelled out between his three sons--Yaropolk, Oleg, and Vladimir.  Yaropolk, finding his possessions too small for his ambition, made war on Oleg, and conquered his territory; but his brother Oleg having been killed in the war, the tender-hearted Yaropolk wept bitterly over his corpse.  The other brother, Vladimir, was so grieved at the death of Oleg that he abandoned his capital, Novgorod, and remained for a time in seclusion. Yaropolk seized the opportunity thus offered, and made himself master of Vladimir's dominions also. Not long afterwards Vladimir appeared at the head of an army, and Yaropolk ran away to his own capital, Kiev. Vladimir at once resumed the throne, and sent word to Yaropolk that he would in due time return the hostile visit.  About this time Yaropolk and Vladimir both asked for the hand of the Princess Rogneda, of Polotzk, in marriage; and the father of the princess, fearing to offend either of the royal barbarians, left the choice to Rogneda herself. She chose Yaropolk, sending a very insulting message to Vladimir, whereupon that prince marched against Polotzk, conquered the province, and with his own hand slew the father and brothers of the princess. Then, with their blood still unwashed from his hands, he forced Rogneda to marry him.  Having attended to this matter, Vladimir undertook to return his brother's hostile visit, as he had promised to do. Yaropolk's capital, Kiev, was a strongly fortified place, and capable of a stout resistance; but Vladimir corrupted Blude, one of Yaropolk's ministers, paying him to betray his master, and promising, in the event of success, to heap honors on his head. Blude worked upon Yaropolk's fears, and persuaded him to abandon the capital without a struggle, and Vladimir took possession of the throne and the country. Even in his exile, however, Yaropolk had no"]]]
