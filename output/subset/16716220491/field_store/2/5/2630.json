But neither Tom nor his father dreamed of Squire Hudson's secret animosity, and regarded his willingness to advance the extra two hundred dollars as an evidence of friendship.  But I have said that Tom took account of stock--in other words, ascertained how much he was worth. First, then, of the money borrowed for his trip--the original two hundred dollars--he had twenty-five dollars left over. Besides this sum, after paying all expenses, he had accumulated, by hard work and strict economy, fifty dollars' worth of gold-dust.  \"I wish father had this money,\" said Tom to his tent-mate, Ferguson. \"I am afraid he stands in need of it.\"  \"There may be a way to send it to him, Tom.\"  \"I wish there were.\"  \"There's one of our party going to San Francisco next week. He can buy a draft there, and send it to your father.\"  \"Who is going?\" asked Tom, eagerly.  \"John Miles. You can trust him with the money, Tom.\"  \"Of course I can. I'd trust John Miles with any sum.\"  \"Who's that taking liberties with my name?\" asked a manly voice, and John Miles himself stepped into the tent, bending his head as he entered.  \"I hear you are going to San Francisco, John?\"  \"Yes, I start next week.\"  \"Will you come back again?\"  \"I intend to. I am going to prospect a little, and buy some things for myself and Captain Fletcher.\"  \"Will you do me a favor?\"  \"Of course I will, if it isn't too large a one,\" answered Miles.  Tom explained what he wished, and John Miles cordially assented.  \"You're a good boy, Tom,\" he said, \"to think of your father so soon.\"  \"I feel anxious about him,\" said Tom. \"He raised money to send me out here, and I don't want him to suffer for it.\"  \"That's the right way to feel, Tom. I wish I had a father and mother to look out for,\" said Miles, soberly, \"but you're in better luck than I. Both died when I was a mere lad. How much do you want to send?\"  \"Seventy-five dollars.\"  \"Have you saved up so much already?\" asked Miles, in surprise.  \"Part of it I had left over when I got here.\"  \"Will you have any left?\"  \"No.\"  \"Isn't it well to reserve a little, then?\"  \"Oh, I shall have some more soon,\" answered Tom, sanguine, as most boys are.  \"Suppose you are sick?\"  \"If he is sick he shall suffer for nothing,\" said the Scotchman. \"While I have money, Tom shall not feel the want of it.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Ferguson,\" said Tom, gratefully.  \"That old fellow has a heart, after all,\" thought Miles, who had been disposed to look upon Ferguson ever since their first acquaintance, as rather miserly.  The Scotchman was certainly frugal, and counted his pennies carefully, but he was not mean, and had conceived a strong affection for his young companion, whom he regarded much as a son or a nephew.  \"Suppose you take the money now, John,\" said Tom.  \"Shall I scribble a receipt, Tom? I am afraid my writing materials have given out.\"  \"I don't want any receipt,\" said Tom; \"I'll trust you without one.\"  \"Nevertheless, lad,\" said the cautious Scotchman, \"it may be well--\"  \"Yes, Tom, Mr. Ferguson is right. Of course I know that you trust me; but if anything should happen to me,--any accident, I mean,--the paper may be useful to you.\"  \"Just as you like, Mr. Miles, but I don't ask it, remember that.\"  \"Yes, I will remember it, and I don't mean to meet with any accident if I can help it. Mr. Ferguson, can you oblige me with a pipeful of tobacco? I'll join you in smoking.\"  Smoking was the Scotchman's solitary extravagance, not a costly one, however, as he never smoked cigars, but indulged only in a democratic clay pipe.  John Miles threw himself on the ground between Tom and his Scotch friend, and watched complacently the wreaths of smoke as they curled upwards.  \"Tom, you ought to smoke,\" he said. \"You don't know how much enjoyment you lose.\"  \"Don't tempt the lad,\" said Ferguson. \"It's a bad habit.\"  \"You smoke yourself.\"  \"That is true, but it isn't well for a growing boy. It can do him no good.\"  \"I smoked before I was as old as Tom.\"  \"So did I, but I wish I had not.\"  \"Well, perhaps you're right, but it's a comfort when a man's tired or out of spirits.\"  \"I am not troubled in that way,\" said Tom. \"I mean with being out of spirits.\"  \"Youth is a hopeful age,\" said the Scotchman. \"When we are young we are always hoping for something good to befall us.\"  \"And when one is older, how is it, Mr. Ferguson?\"  \"We fear ill more than we hope for good,\" he replied.  \"Then I want to remain young as long as I can.\"  \"A good wish, Tom. Some men are always young in spirit; but those that have seen the evil there is in the world find it harder to be hopeful.\"  \"You speak as if you had had experience of the evil, Mr. Ferguson.\"  \"So I have,\" answered the Scotchman slowly. Then, after a pause, \"I will tell you about it: it's no secret.\"  \"Not if it is going to pain you.\"  \"Oh, the pain is past. It's only a matter of money, and those wounds heal.\"  \"Only a matter of money!\" said John Miles to himself. \"I must have misjudged Ferguson. I thought money was all in all with him. I did not think he would speak so lightly of it.\"  \"When I was a young man,\" Ferguson began, \"my father died, leaving me a thousand pounds, and a small annuity to my mother. With this money I felt rich, but I knew it would not support me, nor was I minded to be idle. So I began to look about me, to consider what business I had best go into, when a young man, about my own age, a clerk in a mercantile house, came to me and proposed a partnership. He was to put in five hundred pounds, and contribute his knowledge of business, which was greater than mine. He was a young man of good parts, and had a brisk, pleasant way with him, that made him a favorite in business circles. I thought it was a good chance, and, after taking a little time for thought, agreed to his proposal. So the firm of McIntire and Ferguson was formed. We went into business, and for a time all seemed to go well. As my partner chose to keep the books, I was not so clear as I wished to be about matters, but we seemed to be prospering. One morning, however, on coming to business, I found that my partner had disappeared, after possessing himself of all the money he could collect on the credit of the firm. Of course we were bankrupts, or rather I was, for he left me to bear the brunt of failure.\"  \"Have you ever seen him since, Mr. Ferguson?\"  \"From that day to this--twenty years--I have never set eyes on Sandy McIntire.\"  \"It was a mean trick to serve you, Ferguson,\" said Miles.  \"Yes,\" said the Scotchman, soberly. \"I minded the loss of money, but the loss of confidence was a sore thought too, after all the trust I had put in that man.\"  Presently Miles rose to go.  \"I'll take care of your money, Tom,\" he said, \"and do my best to get it safely to your father.\"  \"Thank you, John.\"  As Miles left the tent, he did not observe a crouching figure on the other side of it. It was the figure of Bill Crane, a crony of Missouri Jack, in fact, the man who helped him to fleece poor Peabody of his scanty hoard.  Bill looked after Miles enviously.  \"I wonder how much money he's got?\" thought Bill. \"I'd like some of it, for I'm bust. I must tell Jack. I don't dare to tackle him alone.\"     CHAPTER IV.  A FOILED ROBBER.   In the grand rush to the newly discovered gold-fields all classes were represented. There were men of education, representatives of all the learned professions, men versed in business, and along with them adventurers and men of doubtful antecedents, graduates of prisons and penitentiaries. Bill Crane, introduced in the last chapter, belonged to the latter undesirable class. He had served a term at Sing-Sing as a housebreaker, and later another term in a Western penitentiary. He had come to California with a prejudice against honest labor, and a determination to make a living by the use of the peculiar talents on which he had hitherto relied. He had spent a week at River Bend, chiefly at the saloon of Missouri Jack, whom he found a congenial spirit, and had picked up a little money from flats like the young Bostonian; but, on the whole, he had found it an unprofitable field for the exercise of his special talents.  \"I must make a raise somehow,\" he bethought himself, \"and then I'll make tracks for some other settlement.\"  Precisely how to raise the fund of which he stood in need was difficult to decide. Moneyed men were not plenty at River Bend. Captain Fletcher and his party had been at work but a short time, and were not likely to have collected much.  As we know, Bill Crane overheard a part of the closing conversation between Tom and John Miles. From this he learned that Miles, besides his own money, would be in charge of seventy-five dollars belonging to our young hero. It was not much, but it was something.  \"If the whole doesn't come to over two hundred dollars, I can make it do,\" thought Crane. \"It will get me out of this beastly hole, and carry me to San Francisco.\"  John Miles slept by himself under a small tent at the northern end of the small encampment. He looked like a man who ate well and slept well, and this would be favorable to Bill Crane, who proposed to effect the robbery in the night. He had half a mind to secure the aid of Missouri Jack, but then Jack would expect to go shares in the \"plunder,\" and there was likely to be little enough for one. So Bill decided to make the attempt alone.  In a small camp like that at River Bend, the movements and plans of each individual were generally known. So it was generally understood that John Miles intended to start on Thursday for the city.  The previous evening he spent with Tom and Ferguson, with whom he was more intimate than any others of the party. He would not have been drawn to the Scotchman, but for his being Tom's room-mate. Through him he came to appreciate and respect the Scot's sterling virtues,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22674"],["title","Boy Scouts on Hudson Bay; Or, The Disappearing Fleet (#1)"],["body","own country, as well as over the southern border, and in foreign lands as well, and for young fellows who had not yet attained their majority, all of the scouts had experienced thrills calculated to make men of mature age proud.  And yet in spite of all this they were genuine boys, with warm hearts, and fond of practical joking. Seated around the jolly fire after disposing of supper, while the two guides attended to cleaning up, Jimmy entertained his mates with a series of rollicking songs, accompanied by Teddy on his mandolin, which he had somehow managed to smuggle along, in spite of a careful watch on the part of Ned, who did not wish to take a single article that was not indispensable, for he knew the gigantic task that lay ahead of them.  Jimmy has as usual been overboard during the late afternoon. It was not a voluntary swim the comical chum had been enjoying, either; these plunges never were, but it seemed as though Jimmy must lose his balance once in so often just while the canoes were negotiating through some wild rapids, and in consequence he had to make the passage clinging to the gunwale.  His red sweater was hanging on a bush to dry in the heat of the fire. It looked unusually brilliant as seen in the glow of the leaping flames. Jimmy was very proud of that same old sweater, which had been with him through so many campaigns that it showed signs of wear and tear. But though he had another nice navy-blue one in his waterproof clothes bag, Jimmy persisted in donning the ancient article every blessed day, in spite of the appeals of his chums.  Ned as usual was poring over his well-thumbed chart. Every day he marked the new ground they had covered, and very seldom had he found cause to doubt the correctness of the two guides. And whenever this had happened it turned out that they were right, and the map wrong.  \"Well,\" Frank finally broke out with, \"so far we haven't run across anything in the shape of a rival expedition, though Ned seemed to think in the start that was what would happen to us.\"  \"I haven't changed my mind yet,\" observed the party mentioned, looking up from examining his chart. \"We understood that the syndicate that is trying to unload this wonderful new mining tract they claim will be richer than Mesauba on Jack's father as a speculation, knew about our being sent up here on some secret mission. They could easily guess that we meant to find out if half of the big claim they made was true, and that on our report Mr. Bosworth would base any action he might take. Now it was to be such a tremendously big deal that under the conditions, if so be there was something crooked about the claims they made, you can understand that it would pay them handsomely to shunt us off the track, or else salt the mine, and make us think it would be as rich a proposition as their prospectus set out.\"  \"But,\" interrupted Jack, \"who could they get to do their crooked work away up here in this forlorn country, where we haven't run across a living being since we met that trapper going south with his winter's catch of pelts?\"  \"Oh! money will do lots of things,\" answered Ned. \"Given a soft berth, with good pay, and plenty to eat, and scores of Indian half-breeds, timber cruisers, guides out of employment along the salmon fishing streams of the Dominion, and trappers loafing through an off season, would jump at the bait. There'd be plenty to enlist under the lead of a bold man hired by the syndicate; if, as we more than half believe, their claim is a great swindle which they mean to hang about Jack's father's neck.\"  \"Francois says we will always have to be prepared, and as that is the motto of Boy Scouts all over the known world, it isn't likely to seem new to us,\" Frank Shaw remarked, a little boastfully it must be confessed, for having passed through so many strange happenings in times past had given him a touch of what Jimmy was inclined to call the \"swelled head,\" though any one would have been justified for feeling proud of such a record of wonderful things accomplished.  The scouts having started on the subject of their mission continued to discuss it from various angles. In this way they often hit upon suggestions, because one remark would bring out another until some fellow chanced to open up a new field of conjecture.  They were deep in the matter, and all taking a hand in the discussion, when Francois, the dark-faced voyageur, suddenly started to his knees with a cry of warning. At the same time the boys became aware of the fact that a strange rushing and pounding noise was rapidly bearing down upon the little camp on the river bank.  Jimmy happened to be sitting cross-legged like a Turk, a favorite attitude of his, and becoming excited he could not get up as rapidly as his chums.  In consequence of this he seemed to be in the way of some huge body that rushed the camp, scattering the fire, and rending the branches of the tree under which the exploring party had settled for the night.  It was all over in a few seconds. The camp was in an uproar, one of the tents down flat, the fire in danger of communicating to the brush, and Jimmy squealing on his back, where the sudden rush of the mysterious monster had thrown him.     CHAPTER II.  A WILD CHARGE.   \"Help! Help!\" Jimmy was shouting, kicking wildly as he roared. \"Keep off me, you wild elephant! Somebody shoot him, quick, before he steps on me!\"  \"Here, stop that kicking, if you want to be helped up, do you hear, Jimmy!\" exclaimed Frank, who had hastened to the assistance of the comrade in distress. \"Are you much hurt; and did the beast trample on you any?\"  Jimmy began to feel of his legs and arms, and upon discovering himself apparently as sound as a dollar, grinned sheepishly. Meanwhile the two guides had hastened, with the help of Ned and Jack, to gather the fire together again. Teddy had snatched up the nearest rifle and was down on one knee, peering out through the semi-darkness as though anticipating a return rush on the part of the unknown monster that had created such confusion in the camp.  \"No great damage done, after all, seems like, if Jimmy says he's all right,\" remarked Ned, now beginning to let a broad smile creep over his face, for seeing Jimmy doubled up and had been a ludicrous spectacle not soon to be forgotten.  \"But what in creation was it that put the kibosh all over me like that?\" demanded the one who had been knocked over by the mad rush of the invader.  Ned glanced toward Francois, and the voyageur simply said:  \"Bull moose--him very much mad, charge camp like that!\"  \"Well, I should think he must have been,\" Frank Shaw declared. \"Why, if we'd had a little more warning we might have met him with a volley of hot lead that'd have laid him out dead. Now that Francois says so, I do believe he looked pretty much on the order of a monstrous moose bull. I certainly saw his horns, and they were full grown, because the rutting season is long since past.\"  \"But what makes a moose get his mad up?\" Jack asked. \"We didn't do a single thing to rile him, that I know of, but were sitting here as easy as you please, when all at once he charges through the camp. Why, say, he nearly carried off some of our property, when he knocked down that tent. Look at the rip his horns made in the tanned canvas, would you? Some more sewing for Teddy here, to mend the rip.\"  \"Francois, do bull moose often act in that way?\" asked Teddy, still gripping the repeating rifle, as though not fully convinced that their would be no repetition of the savage onslaught.  The guide shook his head.  \"Know only few times when it happen, and then there be reason. He carry off on horns what makes him rush our camp. I saw the same with my own eyes. Bull moose much like farm bull, and hate ze red color ver' mooch.\"  At hearing this several of the boys gave a shout.  \"There, see what you get, Jimmy, for keeping that silly red sweater around. The old bull saw it hanging there in the light of our fire, and it made him so furious, as it has us lots of times, that he lowered his head and just charged us.\"  \"But he took it away with him, as sure as you live, fellows!\" gasped Jimmy, as a sense of his deep affliction came over him. \"My dear sweater that I loved so much.\"  \"Bully for the moose!\" cried Jack.  \"He'd done us all a mighty good turn, even if he never meant to,\" added Frank, \"now we've seen the last of that terrible old garment, and Jimmy'll just _have_ to get out the nice new one he's been carrying in his bag.\"  \"Just think of the old fool, would you, a-tearin' around the woods with that red flag hanging from his horns,\" Jimmy wailed. \"Don't I hope it keeps him wild right along, so that he'll smash into a tree, and break his blessed neck! But I'm glad he didn't take a notion to carry me off along with my sweater, and that's no lie!\"  The little excitement soon died away. Not much damage had been done after all by that mad charge of the infuriated bull moose. The rent in the canvas could be readily mended, and as for Jimmy's loss it was his companions' gain, so that there would be no lament made save by the late owner.  \"I didn't know moose ever roamed as far north as this,\" remarked Ned.  \"How about that, Francois?\" asked Frank, who, it might be noticed, kept his gun close beside him now, as though meaning to be ready in case another cause for excitement arose.  \"It is not often zat ze bull moose come up here,\" replied the French Canadian, in his queer patois; \"but sometimes in summer zey wander far afield. I haf seen ze same so mooch as three hundred mile north from here.\"  \"One thing sure, there are plenty of caribou around,\" Teddy went on to say; \"and when the meat's tender, it suits me all right. I'm running across new things every day up here, and don't feel sorry I came, so far.\"  \"New things seem to be running across us also,\" chuckled Frank; \"for instance, the monster that just invaded our camp. But as our supply of red sweaters has given out now, we'll hope not "]]]
