The officers, from the captain to the lowest rank, appeared to have performed their duty faithfully; and all the trouble was in the execution of their orders. In conclusion, he announced that the drill would be resumed in half an hour, and directed the commander to pipe down.  \"That didn't hurt anybody,\" said Howe, as he walked forward with Spencer. \"Let us keep it up.\"  \"We may get caught at it.\"  \"No need of that. Accidents will happen.\"  \"Yes; but they don't happen all over the ship at the same time.\"  \"Well, they may, you know,\" laughed Howe. \"In fact, I don't see how accidents are to be avoided while we have such a fellow as Shuffles for captain. If there is any one in the ship that I despise, it is Shuffles.\"  \"So say we all of us!\"  \"The snivelling, canting, whining puppy! Have you any idea that his merit-marks made him captain of the ship?\" continued Howe.  \"I suppose they did.\"  \"Tell that to the marines! Wasn't he acknowledged to be the worst fellow in the ship when we crossed the Atlantic? Wasn't he the ringleader in all mischief and scrapes?\"  \"But he has reformed.\"  \"Reformed!\" sneered Howe. \"He has turned hypocrite, if that is what you mean by reformed. I don't believe in that sort of bosh.\"  \"He's the pet of the principal and the instructors.\"  \"Yes; and they have given him marks enough to make him captain, just to show good fellows, like you and me, what a saint can do. It is all humbug! Why, he got more marks than Kendall, Gordon, Haven, and the rest of those cabin nobs, who are fit to enter the senior class in a college. I am satisfied that his merit-roll was doctored so as to make it come out as it did.\"  \"I don't believe Lowington would do any such thing as that,\" suggested Spencer, shaking his head.  \"Don't you? Well, I do. What's the use of talking! Didn't Shuffles jump from the steerage into the captain's state-room?\"  \"Any other fellow may do the same thing. Look at Tom Perth, who lost a heap of marks for running off in the Josephine, as the rest of us did. He is second master. If it hadn't been for our scrape, very likely he would have been captain.\"  \"Don't you believe it.\"  \"If Lowington had not been fair, and let every fellow go just where his marks carried him, Perth would not have had a place in the cabin.\"  \"O, the principal only wanted to break us up by taking our best fellow away from us. He couldn't drive Tom Perth, and now he's going to lead him--bait him with sugar and offices.\"  \"Some of the fellows say Shuffles can't handle the ship without the help of the principal,\" said Spencer.  \"Of course he can't!\" exclaimed Howe. \"Hasn't he proved that already? If Paul Kendall had been captain, he would have spotted every fellow that made any trouble. Let us keep it up, Spencer, and we shall soon prove that Shuffles can't handle the ship. That will be enough to satisfy me.\"  The approach of an officer interrupted the conversation; but Howe passed from one to another of the malcontents, and instructed them what to do in the next drill. They were to create all the confusion they could in the discharge of their duty. They were to misunderstand the orders, and to blunder in the execution of them, in such a manner as to conceal their own agency in the mischief, and divide the responsibility of it among their companions. The runaway crew of the Josephine, mortified at their failure, were still fretting because they had not visited Paris and Switzerland. They were ready to listen to evil counsels, and regarding Howe as their leader since the promotion of Perth, they promised to follow his instructions to the letter.  \"What are we going to make by it?\" demanded Sheffield, who doubted the policy of the proceeding.  \"We are going to prove, in the first place, that Shuffles can't handle the ship,\" replied Howe.  \"Perhaps you may prove it, even if you don't believe what you prove.\"  \"But I do believe he can't handle the ship.\"  \"I don't. I hate Shuffles as bad as any fellow, but I believe he is as good a sailor as any person on board, man or boy.\"  \"That's all in your eye!\" retorted Howe, contemptuously. \"He may be able to get along while we are lying in port, but I should like to see him work the ship in a gale of wind.\"  \"He can do it,\" answered Sheffield, confidently. \"But he is a flunky, and spoiled all our fun in the Josephine. I am willing to throw him over for being a hypocrite, and selling us out as he did. What else are we to gain?\"  \"We shall help along our chances of going down the Rhine, and,\" whispered Howe, \"of seeing Paris and Switzerland.\"  \"I don't see it.\"  \"Well, I do. If we cave in and pretend to be lambs when we are lions, we shall have to do duty while the rest of the fellows are having a good time on shore. If we show that we are still wide awake, Lowington will take us with him, because he will not dare to leave us on board.\"  \"He will leave Fluxion with us.\"  \"Not much! I heard some of the fellows say that Fluxion was going to Italy to see his mother, or his sister, or somebody that is sick there.\"  \"I heard that.\"  \"If it is true, Lowington will not leave us behind, especially if he finds we are not as gentle as lambs.\"  \"Perhaps not; but as the matter stands, we are already condemned to stay on board during the rest of the season.\"  \"I know that; but Lowington will let us off.\"  \"He will be more likely to do so if we behave well.\"  \"Not he! Don't you believe it.\"  \"They say Shuffles is teasing him to remit the rest of the penalty.\"  \"Shuffles!\"  \"That's so; and Lowington promised to consider the matter. Tom Perth told me this; and he heard Shuffles talking to the principal about it.\"  \"Humph! I don't want to go on those terms,\" replied Howe, in disgust. \"That's some more of Shuffles's cant! One of his sensations! He thinks he whipped us out on board of the Josephine, and now he wants to be magnanimous with his victims. If we go with the crowd, it will be because Lowington is afraid to leave us behind. We are not a set of babies, Sheffield, to be whipped and sent to bed when we are naughty. Neither are we sailors before the mast, to be kicked here and there, at the pleasure of our masters. What do you suppose the fellows came to Europe for, if it was not to see the country? Are we to be left on board just because we went on a little lark? Not much!\"  \"That's all very good, but it won't go down,\" laughed Sheffield.  \"I'm not going to eat humble pie for any one. Do you mean to tell me I am not as good a fellow as Bob Shuffles?\"  \"I didn't say you were not.\"  \"Am I not his equal?\" demanded Howe.  \"I suppose you are, if you behave as well.\"  \"Behave as well!\" sneered the orator. \"I behave well enough, and I'm not going to be put down, nor beg my rights of Bob Shuffles. If I am left on board, for one, when the fellows go down the Rhine, I intend to break things.\"  \"Don't break your own head.\"  \"Let me alone for that. If our fellows have any spirit at all, they will not be left behind. In the next drill, things will be mixed, and no one can tell who makes the mischief. Our fellows are not the only ones that don't like Shuffles, and you will find that about half the crew will help snarl things up. Now, keep your weather eye open, Sheffield. Take my advice, and don't whimper. Our fellows have a little business in Paris and Switzerland, and we shall attend to it in a week or two. There goes the pipe. Mind your eye, Sheffield.\"  The boatswain's call sounded through the ship, and officers and crew hastened to their stations.     CHAPTER II.  CLOSE QUARTERS.   The malcontents in the ship were, apparently, the most zealous seamen on board. Certainly no one would have suspected them of organizing any mischief, they looked so innocent and so determined to do their duty promptly. Howe, Wilton, Little, and others had done their work thoroughly and secretly. They had arranged at least a dozen different tricks for making confusion among the crew. To each one of the discontented a part had been assigned, which he was to perform in such a way as to conceal his own agency.  Captain Shuffles was planking the quarter-deck with the commodore. Everybody could see that he was not entirely at his ease. His position was a novel one to him, and he was oppressed by its responsibilities, especially since the crew had behaved so badly at the first drill. He could not help knowing that a portion of the crew were opposed to him, and would do anything they could to annoy him. The situation was a difficult one; for, at the commencement of his term of office, he did not wish to have any of the seamen punished for neglect or disobedience, even if he could discover the guilty ones.  Mr. Lowington was not on deck. He had purposely gone below, for he wished the new captain to act on his own responsibility, and overcome the difficulty alone. This was in accordance with his previous course, when, even in a gale of wind, he permitted the young officers to handle the ship without any dictation. Though the action adopted by the boys was not always in accordance with his own judgment, he never interfered unless an obvious and dangerous blunder was made. His policy had worked well thus far, and he was disposed to continue it. In the present instance, he was no better informed than the captain in regard to the real cause of the difficulty. He believed it was merely the effect of a fun-loving spirit on the part of the crew; a mere disposition to haze the new officers a little, and perhaps prove what they were made of. He hoped the new officers would satisfy them, and, if necessary, send a dozen or twenty of the mischief-makers to the mainmast for punishment.  \"All hands, up anchor, ahoy!\" piped the boatswain, after he had received the order from the captain, through the proper officers.  Those whose stations were at the cable and capstan sprang to their places with unwonted alacrity.  \"Bring to, forward!\" added the first lieutenant, giving the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24135"],["title","The Measure of a Man (#1)"],["body","wounds.  The only trouble was that Earth couldn't counterattack. Their ships were still out-classed by those of the Rats. And the Rats, their racial pride badly stung, were determined to wipe out Man, to erase the stain on their honor wherever Man could be found. Somehow, some way, they must destroy Earth.  And now, Al Pendray thought bitterly, they would do it.         *       *       *       *       *  The _Shane_ had sneaked in past Rat patrols to pick up a spy on one of the outlying Rat planets, a man who'd spent five years playing the part of a Rat slave, trying to get information on their activities there. And he had had one vital bit of knowledge. He'd found it and held on to it for over three years, until the time came for the rendezvous.  The rendezvous had almost come too late. The Rats had developed a device that could make a star temporarily unstable, and they were ready to use it on Sol.  The _Shane_ had managed to get off-planet with the spy, but they'd been spotted in spite of the detector nullifiers that Earth had developed. They'd been jumped by Rat cruisers and blasted by the superior Rat weapons. The lifeboats had been picked out of space, one by one, as the crew tried to get away.  In a way, Alfred Pendray was lucky. He'd been in the sick bay with a sprained ankle when the Rats hit, sitting in the X-ray room. The shot that had knocked out the port engine had knocked him unconscious, but the shielded walls of the X-ray room had saved him from the blast of radiation that had cut down the crew in the rear of the ship. He'd come to in time to see the Rat cruisers cut up the lifeboats before they could get well away from the ship. They'd taken a couple of parting shots at the dead hulk, and then left it to drift in space--and leaving one man alive.  In the small section near the rear of the ship, there were still compartments that were airtight. At least, Pendray decided, there was enough air to keep him alive for a while. If only he could get a little power into the ship, he could get the rear air purifiers to working.  He left the lifeboat and closed the door behind him. There was no point in worrying about a boat he couldn't use.  He made his way back toward the engine room. Maybe there was something salvageable there. Swimming through the corridors was becoming easier with practice; his Cadet training was coming back to him.  Then he got a shock that almost made him faint. The beam of his light had fallen full on the face of a Rat. It took him several seconds to realize that the Rat was dead, and several more to realize that it wasn't a Rat at all. It was the spy they had been sent to pick up. He'd been in the sick bay for treatments of the ulcers on his back gained from five years of frequent lashings as a Rat slave.  Pendray went closer and looked him over. He was still wearing the clothing he'd had on when the _Shane_ picked him up.  _Poor guy_, Pendray thought. _All that hell--for nothing._  Then he went around the corpse and continued toward the engine room.  The place was still hot, but it was thermal heat, not radioactivity. A dead atomic engine doesn't leave any residual effects.  Five out of the six engines were utterly ruined, but the sixth seemed to be in working condition. Even the shielding was intact. Again, hope rose in Alfred Pendray's mind. If only there were tools!  A half hour's search killed that idea. There were no tools aboard capable of cutting through the hard shielding. He couldn't use it to shield the engine on the lifeboat. And the shielding that been on the other five engines had melted and run; it was worthless.  Then another idea hit him. Would the remaining engine work at all? Could it be fixed? It was the only hope he had left.  Apparently, the only thing wrong with it was the exciter circuit leads, which had been sheared off by a bit of flying metal. The engine had simply stopped instead of exploding. That ought to be fixable. He could try; it was something to do, anyway.  It took him the better part of two days, according to his watch. There were plenty of smaller tools around for the job, although many of them were scattered and some had been ruined by the explosions. Replacement parts were harder to find, but he managed to pirate some of them from the ruined engines.  He ate and slept as he felt the need. There was plenty of food in the sick bay kitchen, and there is no need for a bed under gravity-less conditions.  After the engine was repaired, he set about getting the rest of the ship ready to move--if it _would_ move. The hull was still solid, so the infraspace field should function. The air purifiers had to be reconnected and repaired in a couple of places. The lights ditto. The biggest job was checking all the broken leads to make sure there weren't any short circuits anywhere.  The pseudogravity circuits were hopeless. He'd have to do without gravity.         *       *       *       *       *  On the third day, he decided he'd better clean the place up. There were several corpses floating around, and they were beginning to be noticeable. He had to tow them, one by one, to the rear starboard air lock and seal them between the inner and outer doors. He couldn't dump them, since the outer door was partially melted and welded shut.  He took the personal effects from the men. If he ever got back to Earth, their next-of-kin might want the stuff. On the body of the imitation Rat, he found a belt-pouch full of microfilm. The report on the Rats' new weapon? Possibly. He'd have to look it over later.  On the \"morning\" of the fourth day, he started the single remaining engine. The infraspace field came on, and the ship began moving at multiples of the speed of light. Pendray grinned. _Half gone, will travel_, he thought gleefully.  If Pendray had had any liquor aboard, he would have gotten mildly drunk. Instead, he sat down and read the spools of microfilm, using the projector in the sick bay.  He was not a scientist in the strict sense of the word. He was a navigator and a fairly good engineer. So it didn't surprise him any that he couldn't understand a lot of the report. The mechanics of making a semi-nova out of a normal star were more than a little bit over his head. He'd read a little and then go out and take a look at the stars, checking their movement so that he could make an estimate of his speed. He'd jury-rigged a kind of control on the hull field, so he could aim the hulk easily enough. He'd only have to get within signaling range, anyway. An Earth ship would pick him up.  _If there was any Earth left by the time he got there._  He forced his mind away from thinking about that.  It was not until he reached the last spool of microfilm that his situation was forcibly brought to focus in his mind. Thus far, he had thought only about saving himself. But the note at the end of the spool made him realize that there were others to save.  The note said: _These reports must reach Earth before 22 June 2287. After that, it will be too late._  _22 June!_  That was--let's see....  _This is the eighteenth of September_, he thought, _June of next year is--nine months away. Surely I can make it in that time. I've got to._  The only question was, how fast was the hulk of the _Shane_ moving?  It took him three days to get the answer accurately. He knew the strength of the field around the ship, and he knew the approximate thrust of the single engine by that time. He had also measured the motions of some of the nearer stars. Thank heaven he was a navigator and not a mechanic or something! At least he knew the direction and distance to Earth, and he knew the distance of the brighter stars from where the ship was.  He had two checks to use, then. Star motion against engine thrust and field strength. He checked them. And rechecked them. And hated the answer.  He would arrive in the vicinity of Sol some time in late July--a full month too late.  What could he do? Increase the output of the engine? No. It was doing the best it could now. Even shutting off the lights wouldn't help anything; they were a microscopic drain on that engine.  He tried to think, tried to reason out a solution, but nothing would come. He found time to curse the fool who had decided the shielding on the lifeboat would have to be removed and repaired. That little craft, with its lighter mass and more powerful field concentration, could make the trip in ten days.  The only trouble was that ten days in that radiation hell would be impossible. He'd be a very well-preserved corpse in half that time, and there'd be no one aboard to guide her.  Maybe he could get one of the other engines going! Sure. He _must_ be able to get one more going, somehow. Anything to cut down on that time!  He went back to the engines again, looking them over carefully. He went over them again. Not a single one could be repaired at all.  Then he rechecked his velocity figures, hoping against hope that he'd made a mistake somewhere, dropped a decimal point or forgotten to divide by two. Anything. Anything!  But there was nothing. His figures had been accurate the first time.  For a while, he just gave up. All he could think of was the terrible blaze of heat that would wipe out Earth when the Rats set off the sun. Man might survive. There were colonies that the Rats didn't know about. But they'd find them eventually. Without Earth, the race would be set back five hundred--maybe five thousand--years. The Rats would would have plenty of time to hunt them out and destroy them.  And then he forced his mind away from that train of thought. There had to be a way to get there on time. Something in the back of his mind told him that there _was_ a way.  He had to think. Really think.         *       *       *       *       *  On 7 June 2287, a signal officer on the Earth destroyer _Muldoon_ picked up a faint signal coming from the general direction of the constellation of Sagittarius.
