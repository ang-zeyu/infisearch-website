Since the publication of _Life and Letters_ I have gained fresh evidence on this head. A small packet containing 13 pp. of MS. came to light in 1896. On the outside is written \"First Pencil Sketch of Species Theory. Written at Maer and Shrewsbury during May and June 1842.\" It is not however written in pencil, and it consists of a single chapter on _The Principles of Variation in Domestic Organisms_. A single unnumbered page is written in pencil, and is headed \"Maer, May 1842, useless\"; it also bears the words \"This page was thought of as introduction.\" It consists of the briefest sketch of the geological evidence for evolution, together with words intended as headings for discussion,--such as \"Affinity,--unity of type,--foetal state,--abortive organs.\"       {18} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 116.       {19} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 10.       {20} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 146.       {21} _J. Linn. Soc. Zool._ iii. p. 45.  The back of this \"useless\" page is of some interest, although it does not bear on the question of date,--the matter immediately before us.  It seems to be an outline of the Essay or sketch of 1842, consisting of the titles of the three chapters of which it was to have consisted.  \"I. The Principles of Var. in domestic organisms.  \"II. The possible and probable application of these same principles to wild animals and consequently the possible and probable production of wild races, analogous to the domestic ones of plants and animals.  \"III. The reasons for and against believing that such races have really been produced, forming what are called species.\"  It will be seen that Chapter III as originally designed corresponds to Part II (p. 22) of the Essay of 1842, which is (p. 7) defined by the author as discussing \"whether the characters and relations of animated things are such as favour the idea of wild species being races descended from a common stock.\" Again at p. 23 the author asks \"What then is the evidence in favour of it (the theory of descent) and what the evidence against it.\" The generalised section of his Essay having been originally Chapter III{22} accounts for the curious error which occurs in pp. 18 and 22 where the second Part of the Essay is called Part III.       {22} It is evident that _Parts_ and _Chapters_ were to some extent      interchangeable in the author's mind, for p. 1 (of the MS. we have      been discussing) is headed in ink Chapter I, and afterwards altered      in pencil to Part I.  The division of the Essay into two parts is maintained in the enlarged Essay of 1844, in which he writes: \"The Second Part of this work is devoted to the general consideration of how far the general economy of nature justifies or opposes the belief that related species and genera are descended from common stocks.\" The _Origin of Species_ however is not so divided.  We may now return to the question of the date of the Essay. I have found additional evidence in favour of 1842 in a sentence written on the back of the Table of Contents of the 1844 MS.--not the copied version but the original in my father's writing: \"This was written and enlarged from a sketch in 37 pages{23} in Pencil (the latter written in summer of 1842 at Maer and Shrewsbury) in beginning of 1844, and finished it <_sic_> in July; and finally corrected the copy by Mr Fletcher in the last week in September.\" On the whole it is impossible to doubt that 1842 is the date of the earlier of the two Essays.       {23} On p. 23 of the MS. of the _Foundations_ is a reference to the      \"back of p. 21 bis\": this suggests that additional pages had been      interpolated in the MS. and that it may once have had 37 in place      of 35 pp.  The sketch of 1842 is written on bad paper with a soft pencil, and is in many parts extremely difficult to read, many of the words ending in mere scrawls and being illegible without context. It is evidently written rapidly, and is in his most elliptical style, the articles being frequently omitted, and the sentences being loosely composed and often illogical in structure. There is much erasure and correction, apparently made at the moment of writing, and the MS. does not give the impression of having been re-read with any care. The whole is more like hasty memoranda of what was clear to himself, than material for the convincing of others.  Many of the pages are covered with writing on the back, an instance of his parsimony in the matter of paper{24}. This matter consists partly of passages marked for insertion in the text, and these can generally (though by no means always) be placed where he intended. But he also used the back of one page for a preliminary sketch to be rewritten on a clean sheet. These parts of the work have been printed as footnotes, so as to allow what was written on the front of the pages to form a continuous text. A certain amount of repetition is unavoidable, but much of what is written on the backs of the pages is of too much interest to be omitted. Some of the matter here given in footnotes may, moreover, have been intended as the final text and not as the preliminary sketch.       {24} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 153.  When a word cannot be deciphered, it is replaced by:--<illegible>, the angular brackets being, as already explained, a symbol for an insertion by the editor. More commonly, however, the context makes the interpretation of a word reasonably sure although the word is not strictly legible. Such words are followed by an inserted mark of interrogation <?>. Lastly, words inserted by the editor, of which the appropriateness is doubtful, are printed thus <variation?>.  Two kinds of erasure occur in the MS. of 1842. One by vertical lines which seem to have been made when the 35 pp. MS. was being expanded into that of 1844, and merely imply that such a page is done with: and secondly the ordinary erasures by horizontal lines. I have not been quite consistent in regard to these: I began with the intention of printing (in square brackets) all such erasures. But I ultimately found that the confusion introduced into the already obscure sentences was greater than any possible gain; and many such erasures are altogether omitted. In the same way I have occasionally omitted hopelessly obscure and incomprehensible fragments, which if printed would only have burthened the text with a string of <illegible>s and queried words. Nor have I printed the whole of what is written on the backs of the pages, where it seemed to me that nothing but unnecessary repetition would have been the result.  In the matter of punctuation I have given myself a free hand. I may no doubt have misinterpreted the author's meaning in so doing, but without such punctuation, the number of repellantly crabbed sentences would have been even greater than at present. In dealing with the Essay of 1844, I have corrected some obvious slips without indicating such alterations, because the MS. being legible, there is no danger of changing the author's meaning.  The sections into which the Essay of 1842 is divided are in the original merely indicated by a gap in the MS. or by a line drawn across the page. No titles are given except in the case of § VIII.; and § II. is the only section which has a number in the original. I might equally well have made sections of what are now subsections, _e.g. Natural Selection_ p. 7, or _Extermination_ p. 28. But since the present sketch is the germ of the Essay of 1844, it seemed best to preserve the identity between the two works, by using such of the author's divisions as correspond to the chapters of the enlarged version of 1844. The geological discussion with which Part II begins corresponds to two chapters (IV and V) of the 1844 Essay. I have therefore described it as §§ IV. and V., although I cannot make sure of its having originally consisted of two sections. With this exception the ten sections of the Essay of 1842 correspond to the ten chapters of that of 1844.  The _Origin of Species_ differs from the sketch of 1842 in not being divided into two parts. But the two volumes resemble each other in general structure. Both begin with a statement of what may be called the mechanism of evolution,--variation and selection: in both the argument proceeds from the study of domestic organisms to that of animals and plants in a state of nature. This is followed in both by a discussion of the _Difficulties on Theory_ and this by a section _Instinct_ which in both cases is treated as a special case of difficulty.  If I had to divide the _Origin_ (first edition) into two parts without any knowledge of earlier MS., I should, I think, make Part II begin with Ch. VI, _Difficulties on Theory_. A possible reason why this part of the argument is given in Part I of the Essay of 1842 may be found in the Essay of 1844, where it is clear that the chapter on instinct is placed in Part I because the author thought it of importance to show that heredity and variation occur in mental attributes. The whole question is perhaps an instance of the sort of difficulty which made the author give up the division of his argument into two Parts when he wrote the _Origin_. As matters stand §§ IV. and V. of the 1842 Essay correspond to the geological chapters, IX and X, in the _Origin_. From this point onwards the material is grouped in the same order in both works: geographical distribution; affinities and classification; unity of type and morphology; abortive or rudimentary organs; recapitulation and conclusion.  In enlarging the Essay of 1842 into that of 1844, the author retained the sections of the sketch as chapters in the completer presentment. It follows that what has been said of the relation of the earlier Essay to the _Origin_ is generally true of the 1844 Essay. In the latter, however, the geological discussion is, clearly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22731"],["title","Tin-Types Taken in the Streets of New York (#1)"],["body","rence, \"I'll give you fifty dollars for them.\"  Mr. Ricketty cast forth at her one long, scornful look and then started to go out.  \"Oh, well,\" she called after him, \"I'll be liberal. I'll make it a hundred.\"  \"No, Becky, you wont. You'll not get that glorious relic for the price of a champagne supper. I will die. I will take my pearls and go and jump off the bridge, and together we'll float with the turning tide out into the blue sea. Adieu, Rebecca, so beautiful and yet so cold, adieu! How could Heaven have made thy face so fair, thine eyes so full of light, thy ruddy lips so merry, but thy heart so hard! I press thy hand for the last time, fair Rebecca--\"  \"Well, I like that,\" cried Becky; \"seeing that it's the first. You're very gay for a man of your years, and you'd best keep your fine words for them that wants 'em,--_I_ don't\"; and Becky withdrew her hand, detaining, however, the pearls within it.  Becky was not ill-favored. Her black, silky hair, as fine as a Skye terrier's, curled around a comely head. Her complexion was soft and dark, and her figure light and easy in its movement. These peculiarities, together with her way of fondling the pearls, did not escape Mr. Ricketty's calculating observation.  \"Becky,\" he began blandly.  \"Who told you to call me 'Becky'?\" she angrily demanded.  \"Daughter of Canaan, lend me thine ear, itself as fair as any of these gems of the Southern Sea.\"  \"Oh, come off!\" said Becky.  \"It has cost me many pangs to bring these jewels here--\"  \"And you're going to sell them at so much the pang, I s'pose.\"  \"For hours together have I walked up and down the Bowery, trying to rouse my feeble courage. But when I would stop under the three golden balls, I seemed to see a sneer on every passer's lips. They were all saying, 'There goes Steve Ricketty, about to sell his fond mother's pearls.' The thought choked me, Becky, it burned my filial heart.\"  \"Don't seem as if it did your cheek no harm,\" observed Becky dryly.  \"But when I saw your face through the window there, so beautiful and sympathetic, I said to myself, 'There is a true woman. She will feel for me and my grief.' Suppose we make it two hundred and fifty. Come, Becky, the pearls are yours for two hundred and fifty.\"  \"I wont.\"  \"Am I deceived? No, no, it can't be true. I will not believe--\"  \"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you two hundred to get rid of you.\"  Mr. Ricketty picked up a little hand-glass that lay upon the counter and placed it before her face.  \"Look there,\" he said, \"and tell me what it is that makes Rebecca so heartless. Not those lustrous eyes, so frank and warm; not that--\"  \"Oh, now, stop that.\"  \"Not that sensitive, shapely nose--\"  \"Well, I thank goodness it's got no such bulge on it as yours.\"  \"Not those refined lips, arched like the love-god's bow and many times as dangerous; not those cheeks--those soft peach-tinted cheeks, telling in dainty blushes--\"  \"Oh, six bright stars!\"  \"Of a soul pure as a sunbeam--\"  \"Now, I want you to stop and go 'way. I wont take your old pearls at any price.\"  \"Not that brow--that fair, enameled brow--nor yet that creamy throat. Think, sweet Becky, just how these pearls would look clasped with their diamond catch about that creamy throat. I fear to show you lest their luster pale. But yet, I will! See!\" and catching up the jewels he threw them about her neck and held the glass steadily before her.  Becky looked. It was evidently not a new idea to Becky. She had all along been considering just the situation Mr. Ricketty proposed, and when he finally dropped the pearls and struck an attitude of profound admiration, Becky snatched the prize from her neck, slid it into a drawer under the counter, and drew a leather purse from the safe behind her. She had begun to count out the money, when a figure passing the window caught her eye.  \"There!\" she said sharply. \"You've been bothering me so long that Ike's come back, and we've got to go through a scene. Two hundred and fifty dollars! It'll break Ike's heart.\"  Mr. Ricketty snatched the pocket-book from her hands, coolly extracted bills to the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars, returned the book, and whipped out his handkerchief. As the Jew entered he beheld a man leaning against his counter holding a wad of greenbacks in his hand and sobbing violently.  Apparently summoning all his resolution, Mr. Ricketty dried his eyes and fervently grasped the money-lender's hand.  \"Ikey, my boy,\" he said, \"I leave my all with you. I go from your door, Ikey, like one who treads alone some banquet hall deserted. I have sold you my birthright, dear boy, for a mess of pottage--a mere mess of pottage--a paltry two hundred and fifty dollars.\"  Ikey turned pale. \"Pecky!\" he cried, \"who vas der fool mans und vat he means apoudt der dwo huntered und feefty tollars, hey?\"  \"Well may you call me a fool, Ikey; I can't deny it. I can't even lift my voice in protest. No man in his sober senses would have sold that necklace of glorious gems for such a miserable pittance. Here, Ikey, take back your money and give me my pearls.\"  [Illustration: BECKY.]  He held out the greenbacks with one hand, while with the other he placed his handkerchief to his eyes, of which with great dexterity he reserved a considerable corner for the purposes of observation. At the same time, Becky, well knowing that she had bought the pearls for a sum which, though probably more than her husband would have consented to give, was still far less than their value, handed him the necklace.  The pawnbroker looked from money to jewels and from jewels to money with an expression of curiously mingled grief and greed. Finally, taking Ricketty by the coat-tails, he dragged him towards the door, saying, \"I nefer go pack by anydings vat mine vife does, meester, but ven you haf shewels some more, yust coom along ven I vas der shtore py mineselluf, hey?\"  Mr. Ricketty shook his hand effusively. \"I will, Ikey, I will. These women are very unsatisfactory to deal with. Au revoir, Ikey! Au revoir, madam!\" and bowing with the utmost urbanity to the genial Becky, he strode into the street.  It was easy to see, as Mr. Ricketty wandered aimlessly down the Bowery, that his humor was entirely amiable. The knobs of ruddy flesh under his twinkling black eyes were encircled by a set of merry wrinkles, and his mustache had expanded far across his face.  [Illustration: THE PAWNBROKER.]  He had gone as far as Canal Street, and was just about to turn the corner, when he heard a low, chirping sort of whistle. All in a second his face changed its expression. The merry wrinkles melted and his mustache drew itself compactly together. But he did not turn his head or alter his gait. He walked on for several steps until he heard the whistle again, and this time its tone was sharp. He stopped, wheeled around, and encountered two men.  One of these was a darkly tinted, strongly built man, with big brown eyes, tremendous arms, and an oppressive manner. To him Mr. Ricketty at once addressed himself.  \"Ah, my dear Inspector!\" he cried gayly. \"I'm amazingly happy to see you. You're looking so well and hearty.\"  \"Yes, Steve,\" replied the darkly tinted man, \"I'm feeling fairly well, Steve, and how is it with you?\"  \"So, so.\"  \"I haven't happened to meet you recently, Steve.\"  \"Well, no, Inspector. I've been West, but my brother's death--\"  \"I never knew you had a brother, Steve?\"  \"Oh, yes, Inspector; and a charming fellow he was. He died last week and--\"  \"Was he honest, Steve?\"  \"As honest as a quart measure.\"  \"And did he tell the truth?\"  \"Like a sun-dial.\"  \"Then it's an almighty pity he died, for you need that kind of man in your family, Steve.\"  Mr. Ricketty closed one of his little black eyes, and drew down the ends of his mustache, but beyond this indirect method of communicating his thoughts he made no reply to this observation.  \"I suppose you're not contemplating a very long stay in the city, Steve?\" suggested the Inspector.  \"N--n--no,\" said Mr. Ricketty.  \"You seem in doubt?\"  \"No, I guess I'll return to the West this afternoon.\"  \"Well, on the whole, I shouldn't wonder if that wouldn't be best. Your brother's estate can be settled up, I fancy, without you?\"  \"It aint very large.\"  \"Well, then, good-by, Steve, and, mind now, this afternoon.\"  \"All right, Inspector; good-by!\"  As Mr. Ricketty disappeared down Canal Street, the inspector of police turned to his friend and said: \"That fellow was a clergyman once, and they say he used to preach brilliant sermons.\"     II.

Bootsey was on his way to business. He had come to his tenement home in Cherry Street, just below Franklin Square, to partake of his noonday meal. He had climbed five flights of tenement-house stairs, equal to about thirty flights of civilized stairs, and procuring the key of his mother's room from Mrs. Maguinness, who lived in the third room beyond, where it was always left when Mrs. Biggs went out to get her papers, he had entered within the four walls that he called his home.

He was now satisfied. His stomach was full of boiled cabbage, and his soul was full of peace. He clambered back into the dry-goods box and renewed his guileless operations on the baby.
