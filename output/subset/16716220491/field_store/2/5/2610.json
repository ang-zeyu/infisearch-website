CLEARNESS AND FORCE.   WORDS.  1. Use words in their proper sense.  2. Avoid exaggerations.  3. Avoid useless circumlocution and \"fine writing.\"  4. Be careful in the use of \"not ... and,\" \"any,\" \"but,\" \"only,\" \"not ... or,\" \"that.\"  4 _a_. Be careful in the use of ambiguous words, _e.g._ \"certain.\"  5. Be careful in the use of \"he,\" \"it,\" \"they,\" \"these,\" &c.  6. Report a speech in the First Person, where necessary to avoid ambiguity.  6 _a_. Use the Third Person where the exact words of the speaker are not intended to be given.  6 _b_. Omission of \"that\" in a speech in the Third Person.  7. When you use a Participle implying \"when,\" \"while,\" \"though,\" or \"that,\" show clearly by the context what is implied.  8. When using the Relative Pronoun, use \"who\" or \"which,\" if the meaning is \"and he\" or \"and it,\" \"for he\" or \"for it.\" In other cases use \"that,\" if euphony allows. Exceptions.  9. Do not use \"and which\" for \"which.\"  10. Equivalents for the Relative: (_a_) Participle or Adjective; (_b_) Infinitive; (_c_) \"Whereby,\" \"whereto,\" &c.; (_d_) \"If a man;\" (_e_) \"And he,\" \"and this,\" &c.; (_f_) \"what;\" (_g_) omission of Relative.  10 _a'_. Repeat the Antecedent before the Relative, where the non-repetition causes any ambiguity. See 38.  11. Use particular for general terms. Avoid abstract Nouns.  11 _a_. Avoid Verbal Nouns where Verbs can be used.  12. Use particular persons instead of a class.  13. Use metaphor instead of literal statement.  14. Do not confuse metaphor.  14 _a_. Do not mix metaphor with literal statement.  14 _b_. Do not use poetic metaphor to illustrate a prosaic subject.   ORDER OF WORDS IN A SENTENCE.  15. Emphatic words must stand in emphatic positions; _i.e._, for the most part, at the beginning or the end of the sentence.  15 _a_. Unemphatic words must, as a rule, be kept from the end. Exceptions.  15 _b_. An interrogation sometimes gives emphasis.  16. The Subject, if unusually emphatic, should often be transferred from the beginning of the sentence.  17. The Object is sometimes placed before the Verb for emphasis.  18. Where several words are emphatic, make it clear which is the most emphatic. Emphasis can sometimes be given by adding an epithet, or an intensifying word.  19. Words should be as near as possible to the words with which they are grammatically connected.  20. Adverbs should be placed next to the words they are intended to qualify.  21. \"Only\"; the strict rule is that \"only\" should be placed before the word it affects.  22. When \"not only\" precedes \"but also,\" see that each is followed by the same part of speech.  23. \"At least,\" \"always,\" and other adverbial adjuncts, sometimes produce ambiguity.  24. Nouns should be placed near the Nouns that they define.  25. Pronouns should follow the Nouns to which they refer, without the intervention of any other Noun.  26. Clauses that are grammatically connected should be kept as close together as possible. Avoid parentheses. But see 55.  27. In conditional sentences, the antecedent or \"if-clauses\" must be kept distinct from the consequent clauses.  28. Dependent clauses preceded by \"that\" should be kept distinct from those that are independent.  29. Where there are several infinitives, those that are dependent on the same word must be kept distinct from those that are not.  30. The principle of Suspense.  30 _a_. It is a violation of the principle of suspense to introduce unexpectedly at the end of a long sentence, some short and unemphatic clause beginning with (_a_) \"not,\" (_b_) \"which.\"  31. Suspense must not be excessive.  32. In a sentence with \"if,\" \"when,\" \"though,\" &c., put the \"if-clause,\" antecedent, or protasis, first.  33. Suspense is gained by placing a Participle or Adjective, that qualifies the Subject, before the Subject.  34. Suspensive Conjunctions, _e.g._ \"either,\" \"not only,\" \"on the one hand,\" &c., add clearness.  35. Repeat the Subject, where its omission would cause obscurity or ambiguity.  36. Repeat a Preposition after an intervening Conjunction, especially if a Verb and an Object also intervene.  37. Repeat Conjunctions, Auxiliary Verbs, and Pronominal Adjectives.  37 _a_. Repeat Verbs after the Conjunctions \"than,\" \"as,\" &c.  38. Repeat the Subject, or some other emphatic word, or a summary of what has been said, if the sentence is so long that it is difficult to keep the thread of meaning unbroken.  39. Clearness is increased, when the beginning of the sentence prepares the way for the middle, and the middle for the end, the whole forming a kind of ascent. This ascent is called \"climax.\"  40. When the thought is expected to ascend, but descends, feebleness, and sometimes confusion, is the result. The descent is called \"bathos.\"  40 _a_. A new construction should not be introduced unexpectedly.  41. Antithesis adds force and often clearness.  42. Epigram.  43. Let each sentence have one, and only one, principal subject of thought. Avoid heterogeneous sentences.  44. The connection between different sentences must be kept up by Adverbs used as Conjunctions, or by means of some other connecting words at the beginning of the sentence.  45. The connection between two long sentences or paragraphs sometimes requires a short intervening sentence showing the transition of thought.   II. BREVITY.  46. Metaphor is briefer than literal statement.  47. General terms are briefer, though less forcible, than particular terms.  47 _a_. A phrase may sometimes be expressed by a word.  48. Participles may often be used as brief (though sometimes ambiguous) equivalents of phrases containing Conjunctions and Verbs.  49. Participles, Adjectives, Participial Adjectives, and Nouns may be used as equivalents for phrases containing the Relative.  50. A statement may sometimes be briefly implied instead of being expressed at length.  51. Conjunctions may be omitted. Adverbs, _e.g._ \"very,\" \"so.\" Exaggerated epithets, _e.g._ \"incalculable,\" \"unprecedented.\"  51 _a_. The imperative may be used for \"if &c.\"  52. Apposition may be used, so as to convert two sentences into one.  53. Condensation may be effected by not repeating (1) the common Subject of several Verbs; (2) the common Object of several Verbs or Prepositions.  54. Tautology. Repeating what may be implied.  55. Parenthesis maybe used with advantage to brevity. See 26.  56. Brevity often clashes with clearness. Let clearness be the first consideration.     CLEARNESS AND FORCE.   _Numbers in brackets refer to the Rules._   WORDS.  *1. Use words in their proper sense.*  Write, not \"His _apparent_ guilt justified his friends in disowning him,\" but \"his _evident_ guilt.\" \"Conscious\" and \"aware,\" \"unnatural\" and \"supernatural,\" \"transpire\" and \"occur,\" \"circumstance\" and \"event,\" \"reverse\" and \"converse,\" \"eliminate\" and \"elicit,\" are often confused together.  This rule forbids the use of the same word in different senses. \"It is in my _power_ to refuse your request, and since I have _power_ to do this, I may lawfully do it.\" Here the second \"power\" is used for \"authority.\"  This rule also forbids the slovenly use of \"nice,\" \"awfully,\" \"delicious,\" \"glorious,\" &c. See (2).   *2. Avoid exaggerations.*  \"The _boundless_ plains in the heart of the empire furnished _inexhaustible_ supplies of corn, that would have almost sufficed for twice the population.\"  Here \"inexhaustible\" is inconsistent with what follows. The words \"unprecedented,\" \"incalculable,\" \"very,\" and \"stupendous\" are often used in the same loose way.   *3. Avoid useless circumlocution and \"fine writing.\"*  \"Her Majesty here _partook of lunch_.\" Write \"_lunched_.\"  \"Partook of\" implies sharing, and is incorrect as well as lengthy.  So, do not use \"apex\" for \"top,\" \"species\" for \"kind,\" \"individual\" for \"man,\" \"assist\" for \"help,\" &c.   *4. Be careful how you use the following words: \"not ... and,\" \"any,\" \"only,\" \"not ... or,\" \"that.\"*[5]  *And.* See below, \"Or.\"  *Any.*--\"I am not bound to receive _any_ messenger that you send.\" Does this mean _every_, or _a single_? Use \"every\" or \"a single.\"  *Not.*--(1) \"I do _not_ intend to help you, because you are my enemy &c.\" ought to mean (2), \"I intend not to help you, and my reason for not helping you is, because you are my enemy.\" But it is often wrongly used to mean (3), \"I intend to help you, not because you are my enemy (but because you are poor, blind, &c.).\" In the latter case, _not_ ought to be separated from _intend_. By distinctly marking the limits to which the influence of _not_ extends, the ambiguity may be removed.  *Only* is often used ambiguously for _alone_. \"The rest help me to revenge myself; you _only_ advise me to wait.\" This ought to mean, \"you only _advise_, instead of _helping_;\" but in similar sentences \"you only\" is often used for \"you alone.\" But see 21.  *Or.*--When \"or\" is preceded by a negative, as \"I do not want butter _or_ honey,\" \"or\" ought not, strictly speaking, to be used like \"and,\" nor like \"nor.\" The strict use of \"not ... or\" would be as follows:--  \"You say you don't want both butter _and_ honey--you want butter _or_ honey; I, on the contrary, _do not want butter or honey_--I want them both.\"  Practically, however, this meaning is so rare, that \"I don't want butter _or_ honey\" is regularly used for \"I want neither butter nor honey.\" But where there is the slightest danger of ambiguity, it is desirable to use _nor_.  The same ambiguity attends \"not ... and.\" \"I do not see Thomas _and_ John\" is commonly used for \"I see neither Thomas nor John;\" but it might mean, \"I do not see them both--I see only one of them.\"  *That.*--The different uses of \"that\" produce much ambiguity, _e.g._ \"I am so much surprised by this statement _that_ I am desirous of resigning, _that_ I scarcely know what reply to make.\" Here it is impossible to tell, till one has read past \"resigning,\" whether the first \"that\" depends upon \"so\" or \"statement.\" Write: \"The statement that I am desirous of resigning surprises "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22600"],["title","How to Write Clearly: Rules and Exercises on English Composition (#2)"],["body","so much that I scarcely know &c.\"  *4 a. Be careful in the use of ambiguous words, e.g. \"certain.\"*  \"Certain\" is often used for \"some,\" as in \"Independently of his earnings, he has a _certain_ property,\" where the meaning might be \"unfailing.\"  Under this head may be mentioned the double use of words, such as \"left\" in the same form and sound, but different in meaning. Even where there is no obscurity, the juxtaposition of the same word twice used in two senses is inelegant, _e.g._ (Bain), \"He turned to the _left_ and _left_ the room.\"  I have known the following slovenly sentence misunderstood: \"Our object is that, with the aid of practice, we may sometime arrive at the point where we think eloquence in its most praiseworthy form _to lie_.\" \"To lie\" has been supposed to mean \"to deceive.\"   *5. Be careful how you use \"he,\" \"it,\" \"they,\" \"these,\" &c.* (For \"which\" see 8.) The ambiguity arising from the use of _he_ applying to different persons is well known.  \"He told his friend that if _he_ did not feel better in half an hour he thought _he_ had better return.\" See (6) for remedy.  Much ambiguity is also caused by excessive use of such phrases as _in this way_, _of this sort_, &c.  \"God, foreseeing the disorders of human nature, has given us certain passions and affections which arise from, or whose objects are, these disorders. _Of this sort_ are fear, resentment, compassion.\"  Repeat the noun: \"Among these passions and affections are fear &c.\"  Two distinct uses of _it_ may be noted. _It_, when referring to something that precedes, may be called \"retrospective;\" but when to something that follows, \"prospective.\" In \"Avoid indiscriminate charity: _it_ is a crime,\" \"it\" is retrospective.[6] In \"_It_ is a crime to give indiscriminately,\" \"it\" is prospective.  The prospective \"it,\" if productive of ambiguity, can often be omitted by using the infinitive as a subject: \"To give indiscriminately is a crime.\"   *6. Report a speech in the First, not the Third Person, where necessary to avoid ambiguity.* Speeches in the third person afford a particular, though very common case, of the general ambiguity mentioned in (5). Instead of \"He told his friend that if _he_ did not feel better &c.,\" write \"He said to his friend, 'If, _I_ (or _you_) don't feel better &c.'\"  *6 a. Sometimes, where the writer cannot know the exact words, or where the exact words are unimportant, or lengthy and uninteresting, the Third Person is preferable.* Thus, where Essex is asking Sir Robert Cecil that Francis Bacon may be appointed Attorney-General, the dialogue is (as it almost always is in Lord Macaulay's writings) in the First Person, _except where it becomes tedious and uninteresting so as to require condensation_, and then it drops into the Third Person:  \"Sir Robert _had nothing to say but_ that he thought his own abilities equal to the place which he hoped to obtain, and that his father's long services deserved such a mark of gratitude from the Queen.\"  *6 b. Omission of \"that\" in a speech reported in the Third Person.*--Even when a speech is reported in the third person, \"that\" need not always be inserted before the dependent verb. Thus, instead of \"He said that he took it ill that his promises were not believed,\" we may write, \"'He took it ill,' he said, 'that &c.'\" This gives a little more life, and sometimes more clearness also.   *7. When you use a Participle, as \"walking,\" implying \"when,\" \"while,\" \"though,\" \"that,\" make it clear by the context what is implied.*  \"Republics, in the first instance, are never desired for their own sakes. I do not think they will finally be desired at all, _unaccompanied_ by courtly graces and good breeding.\"  Here there is a little doubt whether the meaning is \"_since_ they are, or, _if_ they are, unaccompanied.\"  *That or when.*--\"Men _walking_ (_that_ walk, or _when_ they walk) on ice sometimes fall.\"  It is better to use \"men walking\" to mean \"men _when_ they walk.\" If the relative is meant, use \"men that walk,\" instead of the participle.    (1) \"_While_   he was } _Walking_ on { (1) the road, } he fell.\"   (2) \"_Because_ he was }              { (2) the ice,  }  When the participle precedes the subject, it generally implies a cause: \"_Seeing_ this, he retired.\" Otherwise it generally has its proper participial meaning, _e.g._ \"He retired, _keeping_ his face towards us.\" If there is any ambiguity, write \"_on_ seeing,\"--\"_at the same time_, or _while_, keeping.\"   (1) \"_Though_ he was}                       {(1) he nevertheless stood                      }                       {    his ground.\"  (2) \"_Since_ he was } _Struck_ with terror, {(2) he rapidly retreated.\"  (3) \"_If_ he is     }                       {(3) he will soon retreat.\"   *8. When using the Relative Pronoun, use \"who\" and \"which\" where the meaning is \"and he, it, &c.,\" \"for he, it, &c.\" In other cases use \"that,\" if euphony allows.*  \"I heard this from the inspector, _who_ (and he) heard it from the guard _that_ travelled with the train.\"  \"Fetch me (all) the books _that_ lie on the table, and also the pamphlets, _which_ (and these) you will find on the floor.\"  An adherence to this rule would remove much ambiguity. Thus: \"There was a public-house next door, _which_ was a great nuisance,\" means \"_and this_ (_i.e._ the fact of its being next door) was a great nuisance;\" whereas _that_ would have meant \"Next door was a public-house _that_ (_i.e._ the public-house) was a great nuisance.\" *\"Who,\" \"which,\" &c. introduce a new fact about the antecedent, whereas \"that\" introduces something without which the antecedent is incomplete or undefined.* Thus, in the first example above, \"inspector\" is complete in itself, and \"who\" introduces a new _fact_ about him; \"guard\" is incomplete, and requires \"_that_ travelled with the train\" to complete the meaning.  It is not, and cannot be, maintained that this rule, though observed in Elizabethan English, is observed by our best modern authors. (Probably a general impression that \"that\" cannot be used to refer to persons has assisted \"who\" in supplanting \"that\" as a relative.) But the convenience of the rule is so great that beginners in composition may with advantage adhere to the rule. The following are some of the cases where _who_ and _which_ are mostly used, contrary to the rule, instead of _that_.  *Exceptions:*--  (_a_) When the antecedent is defined, _e.g._ by a possessive case, modern English uses _who_ instead of _that_. It is rare, though it would be useful,[7] to say \"His English friends _that_ had not seen him\" for \"the English friends, or those of his English friends, that had not seen him.\"  (_b_) _That_ sounds ill when separated from its verb and from its antecedents, and emphasized by isolation: \"There are many persons _that_, though unscrupulous, are commonly good-tempered, and _that_, if not strongly incited by self-interest, are ready for the most part to think of the interest of their neighbours.\" Shakespeare frequently uses _who_ after _that_ when the relative is repeated. See \"Shakespearian Grammar,\" par. 260.  (_c_) If the antecedent is qualified by _that_, the relative must not be _that_. Besides other considerations, the repetition is disagreeable. Addison ridicules such language as \"_That_ remark _that_ I made yesterday is not _that_ _that_ I said _that_ I regretted _that_ I had made.\"  (_d_) _That_ cannot be preceded by a preposition, and hence throws the preposition to the end. \"This is the rule _that_ I adhere _to_.\" This is perfectly good English, though sometimes unnecessarily avoided. But, with some prepositions, the construction is harsh and objectionable, _e.g._ \"This is the mark _that_ I jumped _beyond_,\" \"Such were the prejudices _that_ he rose _above_.\" The reason is that some of these disyllabic prepositions are used as adverbs, and, when separated from their nouns, give one the impression that they are used as adverbs.  (_e_) After pronominal adjectives used for personal pronouns, modern English prefers _who_. \"There are many, others, several, those, _who_ can testify &c.\"  (_f_) After _that_ used as a conjunction there is sometimes a dislike to use _that_ as a relative. See (_c_).   *9. Do not use redundant \"and\" before \"which.\"[8]*  \"I gave him a very interesting book for a present, _and which_ cost me five shillings.\"  In short sentences the absurdity is evident, but in long sentences it is less evident, and very common.  \"A petition was presented for rescinding that portion of the bye-laws which permits application of public money to support sectarian schools over which ratepayers have no control, this being a violation of the principle of civil and religious liberty, _and which_ the memorialists believe would provoke a determined and conscientious resistance.\"  Here _which_ ought grammatically to refer to \"portion\" or \"schools.\" But it seems intended to refer to \"violation.\" Omit \"and,\" or repeat \"a violation\" before \"which,\" or turn the sentence otherwise.   *10. Equivalents for Relative.*  *(_a_) Participle.*--\"Men _thirsting_ (for 'men _that thirst_') for revenge are not indifferent to plunder.\" The objection to the participle is that here, as often, it creates a little ambiguity. The above sentence may mean, \"men, _when_ they thirst,\" or \"_though_ they thirst,\" as well as \"men _that_ thirst.\" Often however there is no ambiguity: \"I have documents _proving_ this conclusively.\"  *(_b_) Infinitive.*--Instead of \"He was the first _that_ entered\" you can write \"_to_ enter;\" for \"He is not a man _who_ will act dishonestly,\" \"_to_ act.\" This equivalent cannot often be used.  *(_c_) Whereby, wherein, &c.,* can sometimes be used for \"by _which_,\" \"in _which_,\" so as to avoid a harsh repetition of \"_which_.\" \"The means _whereby_ this may be effected.\" But this use is somewhat antiquated.  *(_d_) If.*--\"The man _that_ does not care for music is to be pitied\" can be written (though not so forcibly), \"_If_ a man does not care for music, he is to be pitied.\""]]]
