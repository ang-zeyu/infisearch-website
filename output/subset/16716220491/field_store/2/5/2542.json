When he had finished, Fred was nodding his head slowly. “I see,” he said. “I understand just what you want me to do.”  “Good,” Malone said.  “I’ll take a team over to the Senate Office Building,” Fred said, “and check the computer-secretaries there. That way, you see, I’ll be able to do a full running check on them without taking any one machine out of operation for too long.”  “Sure,” Malone said.  “And it shouldn’t take long,” Fred went on, “to find out just what the trouble is.” He looked very confident.  “How long?” Malone asked.  Fred shrugged. “Oh,” he said, “five or six days.”  Malone repressed an impulse to scream. “Days?” he said. “I mean—well, look, Fred, it’s important. Very important. Can’t you do the job any faster?”  Fred gave a little sigh. “Checking and repairing all those machines,” he said, “is an extremely complex job. Sometimes, Malone, I don’t think you realize quite how complex and how delicate a job it is to deal with such a high-order machine. Why—”  “Wait a minute,” Malone said. “Check and repair them?”  “Of course,” Fred said.  “But I don’t want them repaired,” Malone said. Seeing the look of horror on Fred’s face, he added hastily, “I only want a report from you on what’s wrong, whether they are actually making errors or not. And if they are making errors, just what’s making them do it. And just what kind of errors. See?”  Fred nodded very slowly. “But I can’t just leave them there,” he said piteously. “In pieces and everything. It isn’t right, Malone. It just isn’t right.”  “Well, then,” Malone said with energy, “you go right ahead and repair them, if you want to. Fix ’em all up. But you can do that after you make the report to me, can’t you?”  “I—” Fred hesitated. “I had planned to check and repair each machine on an individual basis.”  “The Congress can allow for a short suspension,” Malone said. “Anyhow, they can now, or as soon as I get the word to them. Suppose you check all the machines first, and then get around to the repair work.”  “It’s not the best way,” Fred demurred.  Malone discovered that it was his turn to sigh. “Is it the fastest?” he said.  Fred nodded.  “Then it’s the best,” Malone said. “How long?”  Fred rolled his eyes to the ceiling and calculated silently for a second. “Tomorrow morning,” he announced, returning his gaze to Malone.  “Fine,” Malone said. “Fine.”  “But—”  “Never mind the buts,” Malone said hurriedly. “I’ll count on hearing from you tomorrow morning.”  “All right.”  “And if it looks like sabotage,” Malone added, “if the errors aren’t caused by normal wear and tear on the machines, you let me know right away. Phone me. Don’t waste an instant.”  “I’ll—I’ll start right away,” Fred said heavily. He looked sadly at the mechanism he had been working on, and put his screwdriver down next to it. It looked to Malone as if he were putting flowers on the grave of a dear departed. “I’ll get a team together,” Fred added. He gave the mechanism and screwdriver one last fond parting look, and tore himself away.  Malone looked after him for a second, thinking of nothing in particular, and then turned in the opposite direction and headed back toward the elevator. As he walked, he began to feel more and more pleased with himself. After all, he’d gotten the investigation started, hadn’t he?  And now all he had to do was go back to his office and read some reports and listen to some interview tapes, and then he could go home.  The reports and the interview tapes didn’t exactly sound like fun, Malone thought, but at the same time they seemed fairly innocent. He would work his way through them grimly, and maybe he would even indulge his most secret vice and smoke a cigar or two to make the work pass more pleasantly. Soon enough, he told himself, they would be finished.  Sometimes, though, he regretted the reputation he’d gotten. It had been bad enough in the old days, the pre-1971 days when Malone had thought he was just lucky. Burris had called him a Boy Wonder then, when he’d cracked three difficult cases in a row. Being just lucky had made it a little tough to live with the Boy Wonder label. After all, Malone thought, it wasn’t actually as if he’d done anything.  But since 1971 and the case of the Telepathic Spy, things had gotten worse. Much worse. Now Malone wasn’t just lucky any more. Instead, he could teleport and he could even foretell the future a little, in a dim sort of way. He’d caught the Telepathic Spy that way, and when the case of the Teleporting Juvenile Delinquents had come up he’d been assigned to that one too, and he’d cracked it. Now Burris seemed to think of him as a kind of God, and gave him all the tough dirty jobs.  And if he wasn’t just lucky any more, Malone couldn’t think of himself as a fearless, heroic FBI agent, either. He just wasn’t the type. He was ... well, talented. That was the word, he told himself: talented. He had all these talents and they made him look like something spectacular to Burris and the other FBI men. But he wasn’t, really. He hadn’t done anything really tough to get his talents; they’d just happened to him.  Nobody, though, seemed to believe that. He heaved a little sigh and stepped into the waiting elevator.  There were, after all, he thought, compensations. He’d had some good times, and the talents did come in handy. And he did have his pick of the vacation schedule lately. And he’d met some lovely girls....  And besides, he told himself savagely as the elevator shot upward, he wasn’t going to do anything except return to his office and read some reports and listen to some tapes. And then he was going to go home and sleep all night, peacefully. And in the morning Mitchell was going to call him up and tell him that the computer-secretaries needed nothing more than a little repair. He’d say they were getting old, and he’d be a little pathetic about it; but it wouldn’t be anything serious. Malone would send out orders to get the machines repaired, and that would be that. And then the next case would be something both normal and exciting, like a bank robbery or a kidnapping involving a gorgeous blonde who would be so grateful to Malone that....  He had stepped out of the elevator and gone down the corridor without noticing it. He pushed at his own office door and walked into the outer room. The train of thought he had been following was very nice, and sounded very attractive indeed, he told himself.  Unfortunately, he didn’t believe it. His prescient ability, functioning with its usual efficient aplomb, told Malone that things would not be better, or simpler, in the morning. They would be worse, and more complicated.  They would be quite a lot worse.  And, as usual, that prescience was perfectly accurate.     2   The telephone, Malone realized belatedly, had had a particularly nasty-sounding ring. He might have known it would be bad news.  As a matter of fact, he told himself sadly, he had known.  “Nothing at all wrong?” he said into the mouthpiece. “Not with any of the computers?” He blinked. “Not even one of them?”  “Not a thing,” Mitchell said. “I’ll be sending a report up to you in a little while. You read it; we put them through every test, and it’s all detailed there.”  “I’m sure you were very thorough,” Malone said helplessly.  “Of course we were,” Mitchell said. “Of course. And the machines passed every single test. Every one. Malone, it was beautiful.”  “Goody,” Malone said at random. “But there’s got to be something—”  “There is, Malone,” Fred said. “There is. I think there’s definitely something odd going on. Something funny. I mean peculiar, not humorous.”  “I thought so,” Malone put in.  “Right,” Fred said. “Malone, try and relax. This is a hard thing to say, and it must be even harder to hear, but—”  “Tell me,” Malone said. “Who’s dead? Who’s been killed?”  “I know it’s tough, Malone,” Fred went on.  “Is everybody dead?” Malone said. “It can’t be just one person, not from that tone in your voice. Has somebody assassinated the entire senate? Or the president and his cabinet? Or—”  “It’s nothing like that, Malone,” Fred said, in a tone that implied that such occurrences were really rather minor. “It’s the machines.”  “The machines?”  “That’s right,” Fred said grimly. “After we checked them over and found they were in good shape, I asked for samples of both the input and the output of each machine. I wanted to do a thorough job.”  “Congratulations,” Malone said. “What happened?”  Fred took a deep breath. “They don’t agree,” he said.  “They don’t?” Malone said. The phrase sounded as if it meant something momentous, but he couldn’t quite figure out what. In a minute, he thought confusedly, it would come to him. But did he want it to?  “They definitely do not agree,” Fred was saying. “The correlation is erratic; it makes no statistical sense. Malone, there are two possibilities.”  “Tell me about them,” Malone said. He was beginning to feel relieved. To Fred, the malfunction of a machine was more serious than the murder of the entire Congress. But Malone couldn’t quite bring himself to feel that way about things.  “First,” Fred said in a tense tone, “it’s possible that the technicians feeding information to the machines are making all kinds of mistakes.”  Malone nodded at the phone. “That sounds possible,” he said. “Which ones?”  “All of them,” Fred said. “They’re all making errors—and they’re all making about the same number of errors. There don’t seem to be any real peaks or valleys, Malone; everybody’s doing it.”  Malone thought of the Varsity Drag and repressed the thought. “A bunch of fumblebums,” he said. “All fumbling alike.

It was my duty, to content myself with placing a statement of the facts before the eyes of the grand jury, the public, and leave it to decide. I know, that the question has been determined in the fields of Waterloo; but a victory is not a judicial sentence.  Whatever opinion the impartial reader may form of this work, I can protest beforehand, that I have not allowed myself to be influenced by any private consideration, by any feeling of hatred, affection, or gratitude. I have followed no impulse but that of my conscience, and I may say with Montaigne: \"This is an honest book.\"  Too young to have participated in the errors or crimes of the revolution, I began and ended my political career without blot, and without reproach. The places, titles, and decorations, which the Emperor deigned to bestow on me, were the reward of several acts of great devotion to his service, and of twelve years of trials and sacrifices. Never did I receive from him any favours or gifts: I entered his service rich, I quitted it poor.  When Lyons opened to him its gates, I was free: I spontaneously embraced his cause: it appeared to me, as to the immense number of Frenchmen, that of liberty, honour, and our country. The laws of Solon declared infamous those, who took no part in civil troubles. I followed their maxims. If the misfortunes of the 20th of March must fall on the heads of the guilty, these guilty, I repeat, will not be in the eye of posterity, the Frenchmen who abandoned the royal standard, to return to the ancient colours of their country; but those imprudent and senseless men, who, by their threats, their acts of injustice, and their outrages, compelled us to choose between insurrection and slavery, between honour and infamy.  During the Hundred Days, there was no person to whom I did an ill turn; frequently I had an opportunity of doing good, and seized it with joy.  Since the return of the regal government, I have lived tranquil and solitary; and, whether from forgetfulness, or from a sense of justice, I escaped in 1815 the persecutions, which the partisans and servants of Napoleon experienced.  This explanation, or this apology, appeared to me necessary: it is right the reader should know, who it is that addresses him.  I could have wished, to abstain from speaking of the royal government in the first part of this work: but it was impossible. It was necessary for me, prominently to exhibit the errors and faults of the king's ministers one by one, to render evident this truth, _that they were the sole authors of the 20th of March_. When elsewhere, as here, I say the government, I mean not to designate the King, but his ministers. In a constitutional monarchy, in which the ministers are responsible, we cannot, and ought not to confound them with the King. \"It is from the King,\" said the keeper of the seals, when he proposed to the deputies of the nation the project of a law on the responsibility of ministers, \"that every act of equity, protection, and clemency, and every regular employment of power, emanates: it is to the ministers alone, that abuses, injustice, and misconduct, are to be imputed.\"     MEMOIRS,  &c. &c.     Until the close of the Spanish war, Napoleon, whether as the First Consul of the Republic, or as the Chief of the Empire, had never ceased to be the object of the love, the pride, and the confidence of the people. But the multitude neither judge, nor can judge of the actions of their rulers but from appearances which often mislead them in their judgment; and the loyalty of the nation then became enfeebled. The conduct of Napoleon was stigmatized as a series of hateful aggressions; the war, as an unjustifiable act of violence. Disaffection increased. Napoleon was assailed by the anger of his subjects, and, for the first time, they upbraided him with having spilt their blood, and wasted their riches, in gratifying his vain and culpable ambition.  At this juncture the public mind became absorbed in the contemplation of the invasion of Russia, and the general discontent was withdrawn from the events which had taken place in the peninsula.  Our arms were crowned with good fortune and glory at the commencement of the Russian war; but that conflict was ended by a catastrophe which has no parallel in the annals of the world.  The Emperor, who escaped almost alone from the perils of the campaign, returned to the capital. His countenance was that of a hero who defies adversity. But his firmness was deemed to be the result of heartless insensibility. Instead of inspiring the people with hope, it embittered their feelings. Louder murmurs broke forth; their indignation expressed itself with greater emphasis. Yet such was the enthusiasm which was even then inspired by the proud recollections of the triumphs of Napoleon, that France, blushing for her disgrace, implored him to win new victories. Armies formed themselves as if by enchantment, and Napoleon stood again in the midst of Germany, more terrible than ever.  After we had conquered at Lutzen, at Bautzen, and at Dresden, the battle of Leipsic was fought[1]. Never before that day had we been doomed to witness our national armies flying before the enemy. The scattered wrecks of our battalions, which had been created by the last hope, by the last effort of our country, at length reached our frontiers. But our soldiers were no longer the vigorous and resolute warriors of France; they were bowed down by want, toil, and humiliation. Soon afterwards they were followed by wandering trains of military carriages, loaded with diseased and wounded wretches, who festered beneath the corpses amongst which they were heaped, and who at once absorbed and diffused the germs of pestilence and contagion. Even the firmest minds now yielded to despair; and the grief occasioned by the havoc now made amongst our defenders renewed the sorrows of the mothers and the wives of those who erewhile had perished in Russia and in Spain. Curses upon Napoleon, the author of all these evils, resounded from side to side of the empire.                     [Footnote 1: The misfortunes of that eventful day,                    and of the remainder of the campaign, were caused                    by the treachery of the Saxons and the defection of                    the Princes of the Confederation of the Rhine.]  As long as good fortune waited upon Napoleon, his most ambitious attempts commanded the applauses of the nation. We boasted of his profound political wisdom, we extolled his genius, we worshipped his courage. When his fortune changed, then his political wisdom was called treachery, his genius, ambition, and his courage, fool-hardiness and infatuation.  Napoleon was not to be depressed by ingratitude or misfortune. He re-assembled the feeble fragments of his armies, and proclaimed aloud that he would conquer or die at the head of his soldiery. This resolution only produced a momentary impression. The French, who so lately believed that the happiness and salvation of France depended only upon the life of Napoleon, now coolly considered that his death, the fate which he was prepared to encounter, afforded the only means of putting an end to the calamities of war, for peace otherwise appeared unattainable.  Napoleon departed. He achieved prodigies, but to no effect. National spirit no longer existed, and the nation had gradually sunk into that state of insensibility so fatal to sovereigns, when the public mind has no perception of their dangers, and abandons them to their destiny.  France was thus affected when Napoleon consented to divest himself of his crown[2]. The apathy of the nation drove him to this extremity; for it deprived him of the means either of carrying on the war, or of making peace.                     [Footnote 2: Napoleon, according to the common                    report, was frequently heard to repeat, after his                    abdication, \"I have been ruined by liberal ideas.\"                    I do not think that he ever expressed himself in                    this manner. I do not intend to doubt the                    irresistible force which liberal ideas have now                    acquired; but I do not think, that they contributed                    to effect the first downfal of the imperial throne.                    Nobody thought about liberal ideas at that period.                    France had been trained to the government of                    Napoleon, and his despotism gave rise to no                    complaints. She was not free in the manner                    according to which the nation now wishes to enjoy                    liberty. But the liberty which France then                    possessed was enough for the French. Napoleon would                    often exercise unlimited authority, but the country                    had only one master, and _he_ was the master of                    all. If it is true that the French abandoned                    Napoleon in 1814, it was not because we were tired                    of Napoleon or discontented with his government,                    but because the nation was exhausted, discouraged,                    and demoralized by an uninterrupted succession of                    calamitous wars. The people would still have been                    delighted to obey him, but they had neither                    strength nor soul.                     The real causes of the downfal of Napoleon are to                    be found in his hatred towards England, and in the                    continental system, which resulted from that                    hatred. This gigantic system, which oppressed all                    Europe, could not fail to raise the entire                    continent against Napoleon and France, and thus to                    bring on the ruin of both. \"Rome,\" as it is said by                    Montesquieu, \"extended her empire because her wars               "]]]
