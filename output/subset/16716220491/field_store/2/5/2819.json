Not with Uncle Al on it and Pigtail, and all those people in New Orleans who would disappear right off the streets. They were frogs too, maybe, but good frogs. Not like the Harmon brothers.  Jimmy had a funny picture of himself much younger than he was. Jimmy saw himself as a great husky baby, standing in the middle of the river and blowing on it with all his might. The waves rose and rose, and Jimmy's cheeks swelled out and the river kept getting angrier.  No--he must fight that.  \"Save Uncle Al!\" he whispered fiercely. \"Just save him--and Pigtail!\"  It began to happen the instant Jimmy opened his eyes. Around the bend in the sunlight came a great spinning disk, wrapped in a fiery glow.  Straight toward the Harmon shantyboat the disk swept, water spurting up all about it, its bottom fifty feet wide. There was no collision. Only a brightness for one awful instant where the shantyboat was twisting and turning in the current, a brightness that outshone the rising sun.  Just like a camera flashbulb going off, but bigger, brighter. So big and bright that Jimmy could see the faces of the Harmon brothers fifty times as large as life, shriveling and disappearing in a magnifying burst of flame high above the cypress trees. Just as though a giant in the sky had trained a big burning glass on the Harmon brothers and whipped it back quick.  Whipped it straight up, so that the faces would grow huge before dissolving as a warning to all snakes. There was an evil anguish in the dissolving faces which made Jimmy's blood run cold. Then the disk was alone in the middle of the river, spinning around and around, the shantyboat swallowed up.  And Uncle Al was still swimming, fearfully close to it.  The net came swirling out of the disk over Uncle Al like a great, dew-drenched gossamer web. It enmeshed him as he swam, so gently that he hardly seemed to struggle or even to be aware of what was happening to him.  Pigtail didn't resist, either. She simply stopped thrashing in Uncle Al's arms, as though a great wonder had come upon her.  Slowly Uncle Al and Pigtail were drawn into the disk. Jimmy could see Uncle Al reclining in the web, with Pigtail in the crook of his arm, his long, angular body as quiet as a butterfly in its deep winter sleep inside a swaying glass cocoon.  Uncle Al and Pigtail, being drawn together into the disk as Jimmy stared, a dull pounding in his chest. After a moment the pounding subsided and a silence settled down over the river.  Jimmy sucked in his breath. The voices began quietly, as though they had been waiting for a long time to speak to Jimmy deep inside his head, and didn't want to frighten him in any way.  \"Take it easy, Jimmy! Stay where you are. We're just going to have a friendly little talk with Uncle Al.\"  \"A t-talk?\" Jimmy heard himself stammering.  \"We knew we'd find you where life flows simply and serenely, Jimmy. Your parents took care of that before they left you with Uncle Al.  \"You see, Jimmy, we wanted you to study the Earth people on a great, wide flowing river, far from the cruel, twisted places. To grow up with them, Jimmy--and to understand them. Especially the Uncle Als. For Uncle Al is unspoiled, Jimmy. If there's any hope at all for Earth as we guide and watch it, that hope burns most brightly in the Uncle Als!\"  The voice paused, then went on quickly. \"You see, Jimmy, you're not human in the same way that your sister is human--or Uncle Al. But you're still young enough to feel human, and we want you to feel human, Jimmy.\"  \"W--Who are you?\" Jimmy gasped.  \"We are the Shining Ones, Jimmy! For wide wastes of years we have cruised Earth's skies, almost unnoticed by the Earth people. When darkness wraps the Earth in a great, spinning shroud we hide our ships close to the cities, and glide through the silent streets in search of our young. You see, Jimmy, we must watch and protect the young of our race until sturdiness comes upon them, and they are ready for the Great Change.\"         *       *       *       *       *  For an instant there was a strange, humming sound deep inside Jimmy's head, like the drowsy murmur of bees in a dew-drenched clover patch. Then the voice droned on. \"The Earth people are frightened by our ships now, for their cruel wars have put a great fear of death in their hearts. They watch the skies with sharper eyes, and their minds have groped closer to the truth.  \"To the Earth people our ships are no longer the fireballs of mysterious legend, haunted will-o'-the-wisps, marsh flickerings and the even more illusive distortions of the sick in mind. It is a long bold step from fireballs to flying saucers, Jimmy. A day will come when the Earth people will be wise enough to put aside fear. Then we can show ourselves to them as we really are, and help them openly.\"  The voice seemed to take more complete possession of Jimmy's thoughts then, growing louder and more eager, echoing through his mind with the persuasiveness of muted chimes.  \"Jimmy, close your eyes tight. We're going to take you across wide gulfs of space to the bright and shining land of your birth.\"  Jimmy obeyed.  It was a city, and yet it wasn't like New York or Chicago or any of the other cities Jimmy had seen illustrations of in the newspapers and picture magazines.  The buildings were white and domed and shining, and they seemed to tower straight up into the sky. There were streets, too, weaving in and out between the domes like rainbow-colored spider webs in a forest of mushrooms.         *       *       *       *       *  There were no people in the city, but down the aerial streets shining objects swirled with the swift easy gliding of flat stones skimming an edge of running water.  Then as Jimmy stared into the depths of the strange glow behind his eyelids the city dwindled and fell away, and he saw a huge circular disk looming in a wilderness of shadows. Straight toward the disk a shining object moved, bearing aloft on filaments of flame a much smaller object that struggled and mewed and reached out little white arms.  Closer and closer the shining object came, until Jimmy could see that it was carrying a human infant that stared straight at Jimmy out of wide, dark eyes. But before he could get a really good look at the shining object it pierced the shadows and passed into the disk.  There was a sudden, blinding burst of light, and the disk was gone.  Jimmy opened his eyes.  \"You were once like that baby, Jimmy!\" the voice said. \"You were carried by your parents into a waiting ship, and then out across wide gulfs of space to Earth.  \"You see, Jimmy, our race was once entirely human. But as we grew to maturity we left the warm little worlds where our infancy was spent, and boldly sought the stars, shedding our humanness as sunlight sheds the dew, or a bright, soaring moth of the night its ugly pupa case.  \"We grew great and wise, Jimmy, but not quite wise enough to shed our human heritage of love and joy and heartbreak. In our childhood we must return to the scenes of our past, to take root again in familiar soil, to grow in power and wisdom slowly and sturdily, like a seed dropped back into the loam which nourished the great flowering mother plant.  \"Or like the eel of Earth's seas, Jimmy, that must be spawned in the depths of the great cold ocean, and swim slowly back to the bright highlands and the shining rivers of Earth. Young eels do not resemble their parents, Jimmy. They're white and thin and transparent and have to struggle hard to survive and grow up.  \"Jimmy, you were planted here by your parents to grow wise and strong. Deep in your mind you knew that we had come to seek you out, for we are all born human, and are bound one to another by that knowledge, and that secret trust.  \"You knew that we would watch over you and see that no harm would come to you. You called out to us, Jimmy, with all the strength of your mind and heart. Your Uncle Al was in danger and you sensed our nearness.  \"It was partly your knowledge that saved him, Jimmy. But it took courage too, and a willingness to believe that you were more than human, and armed with the great proud strength and wisdom of the Shining Ones.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The voice grew suddenly gentle, like a caressing wind.  \"You're not old enough yet to go home, Jimmy! Or wise enough. We'll take you home when the time comes. Now we just want to have a talk with Uncle Al, to find out how you're getting along.\"  Jimmy looked down into the river and then up into the sky. Deep down under the dark, swirling water he could see life taking shape in a thousand forms. Caddis flies building bright, shining new nests, and dragonfly nymphs crawling up toward the sunlight, and pollywogs growing sturdy hindlimbs to conquer the land.  But there were cottonmouths down there too, with death behind their fangs, and no love for the life that was crawling upward. When Jimmy looked up into the sky he could see all the blazing stars of space, with cottonmouths on every planet of every sun.  Uncle Al was like a bright caddis fly building a fine new nest, thatched with kindness, denying himself bright little Mardi Gras pleasures so that Jimmy could go to school and grow wiser than Uncle Al.  \"That's right, Jimmy. You're growing up--we can see that! Uncle Al says he told you to bide from the cottonmouths. But you were ready to give your life for your sister and Uncle Al.\"  \"Shucks, it was nothing!\" Jimmy heard himself protesting.  \"Uncle Al doesn't think so. And neither do we!\"         *       *       *       *       *  A long silence while the river mists seemed to weave a bright cocoon of radiance about Jimmy clinging to the bank, and the great circular disk that had swallowed up Uncle Al.  Then the voices began again. \"No reason why Uncle Al shouldn't have a little fun out of life, Jimmy.

Hence they are sometimes called fox-apes.  There are many kinds of them, however; and, although classed in a group called lemurs, they differ exceedingly from one another, some of them having the appearance of foxes, others more resembling squirrels, and still others like flying squirrels--being possessed of a similar wing-like appendage, and capable, like them, of extended flight.  They are known under different appellations, as Makis, Indris, Loris, Galagos, Tarsiers, Ay-ays, etcetera, and naturalists have subdivided them into a great number of genera.  They are found both in Africa and Asia; but by far the greater number of them, as the Makis and Ay-ays, belong to the Island of Madagascar.  The last are not to be confounded with an animal bearing the same name--the ay-ay of America.  The latter is the singular creature known as the sloth, of which there are several distinct species, all inhabitants of the great forests of tropical America.  Of the lemurs, at least thirty different kinds are known, more than half of which belong to the Island of Madagascar.  A few species are found on the west coast of Africa: and the others inhabit the Oriental islands-- Ceylon, Java, Sumatra, Timor, Mindanao, and the Philippine Archipelago.    CHAPTER TWO.  MONKEYS OF THE NEW WORLD.  The Monkeys of America differ in many respects from those of the Old World.  In general they are smaller--none of the species being quite so large as the baboons.  Their bodies and limbs are also more slender and spider-like; and their whole conformation seems intended to adapt them for dwelling in the great virgin forests of the New World.  There is one particular in which they differ most remarkably from their congeners of the Old World; that is, in having _prehensile_ tails.  With these they are enabled to suspend themselves from the branches of trees, or swing their bodies from one to the other; and this prehensile power is far greater than could be obtained by any clutch of the hand.  So great is it, that even after the animal has died from the effect of a shot or other wound, its tail will still remain hooped around the branch; and if the body is not taken down by the hunter, it will hang there till released by the decay of the tail!  Not all the monkeys of America possess this prehensile power of tail. Some are entirely without it, and approach nearer to certain kinds in the Old World; while there are a few species that very closely resemble the lemurs.  These differences have led to a classification of the American monkeys; and they have been thrown into three groups, though it may be remarked that these groups are not very natural.  They are as follow:--The _Sapajous_, whose tails are not only prehensile, but naked underneath, and tubercled near the tips; the _Sajoas_, who possess the prehensile power, but have hairy tails; and the _Sajouins_, whose tails are _not_ prehensile.  For want of a better, this classification may be adopted.  The Sapajous are subdivided into three genera, of which the Howlers form one.  They are so denominated from their habit of assembling in troops, and uttering the most terrible howlings, so loud that the forest is filled with their sonorous voices.  Their cries can be heard at a half-league's distance, and produce upon a stranger unaccustomed to such sounds a very disagreeable impression.  The unusual strength of voice is accounted for by a peculiar drum-like construction of the _os hyoides_, common to all the genera of Sapajous, but more developed in some than in others; and those in whom the voice is loudest constitute the genus of _Alouatles_, or Howlers.  Of the true howlers there are about a dozen species known to naturalists.  Most of them are denizens of the tropical forests of Guiana and Brazil; but some species are not so tropical in their habits, since one or two extend the kingdom of the monkeys into Mexico on the north, and southward to Paraguay.  Closely allied to the last, are the _Ateles_, or Spider monkeys.  These derive their generic name from their singular spider-like appearance-- caused by their disproportionately long and slender limbs, and the great length of their tails.  None equal them in the prehensile power of the caudal appendage; and it is of them that that curious story is related-- the story of the Monkeys' Bridge--where it is told how they pass over a stream: a number of the strongest joining their bodies together by means of their long tails, and thus forming a bridge, by which the whole troop are enabled to cross.  Of the spider monkeys there are about a dozen species; but three of these have been taken to form one of the three genera into which, as already stated, the Sapajous are divided.  These three differ very little from the other spider monkeys, except in being covered with a soft, woolly hair; and, furthermore, in being much more rare than the others; at all events, they are more rarely seen, as they dwell only in the thickest forests, far remote from the habitations of man.  The third and last genus of the Sapajous is that termed _Lagothrix_. They are small monkeys, covered also with soft woolly hair; and their habitat is along the banks of rivers.  They have a strange habit, not observable among their congeners, of collecting in small troops, and rolling or \"clewing\" themselves up together.  This they do in cold weather, or on the approach of a storm.  They summon each other by means of signals and cries; and selecting the convenient bifurcation of some tree, they there form the singular group.  The jaguar and other beasts of prey take advantage of this habit, and often make victims of the whole _tableau vivant_!  There are three species already described, all denizens of the Brazilian forests.  The Sajous form the second group of the American monkeys.  These have also prehensile tails; but the power is not so highly-developed in them as in the Sapajous, nor are their tails naked.  Moreover, the bodies of the Sajous are more robust, and their limbs of stouter make.  The Sajous are well-tempered creatures, and easily domesticated.  Some of the species are favourite pets--on account of their pleasing manners, and the docility of their nature.  The old males, however, scarcely deserve this reputation, as they will bite freely enough when provoked.  They are not subdivided; but permitted to constitute a single genus, of which there are nearly twenty species--all of them inhabiting equatorial America.  The Sajouins form the third group; but as the name merely signifies those monkeys that have not the power of suspending themselves by the tail, it can hardly be considered a natural group, since there are very varied and numerous genera who lack this power.  The group of Sajouins must therefore be subdivided into several lesser groups.  First of all we have the true Sajouins; and of these the _Saimiri_ or _Titi_ is the most distinguished species.  This pretty little creature is about equal in size to a squirrel, and possesses all the playful disposition of the latter.  Its childlike innocence of countenance, as well as its pleasing and graceful manners, render it a favourite pet wherever it can be obtained.  Its rich robe of yellowish-grey, mixed with green, adds to the attraction of its presence.  There are several species of Sajouins, known as the Widow monkey, the Moloch, the Mitred monkey, and the Black-handed Sajouin--all of them dwellers in the tropical regions of America.  The Doroucouli is another small species, that in the nocturnal forest often alarms the traveller by its singular cry; and an allied species of Doroucouli constitutes, with the one above-mentioned, a second genus of the Sajouins.  The _Sakis_ form of themselves another and somewhat extensive family of the Sajouins.  There are a dozen species of them in all; and they possess the peculiarity of being insect-eaters.  They are fond of honey, too; and are often seen ranging the woods, in little troops of ten or twelve, in search of the nests of the wild bees, which they plunder of their luscious stores.  The _Ouistitis_ also constitute a genus.  These, like the Saimiris, are beautiful little creatures--many of the species not being larger than squirrels, and marked with the most lively colours: as bright red and orange.  There are many different kinds of small squirrels known by this name, or by its abbreviation--Titi--some of them belonging to the group of Saimiris, and others to the Ouistitis, properly so called.  Last of all come the little Tamunus; some of which, in beauty of colours, in playfulness of disposition, and other amiable qualities, need not yield either to the Saimiris or Ouistitis.  They are equally prized as pets; and among their Creole owners have equally applied to them the endearing appellation of Titi-titi.  Quadrupeds, what they are and where found--by Captain Mayne Reid    CHAPTER THREE.  BEARS.  In the days of Linnaeus--that is, a century and a half ago--it was supposed there was only one kind of Bear in existence--the common Brown bear of Europe.  It is true that Linnaeus before his death had heard of the great Polar bear, but he had never seen one, and was not certain of its being a distinct species.  Not only has the Polar bear proved to be a very different animal from his brown congener, but other species have turned up in remote quarters of the globe: until the list of these interesting quadrupeds has been extended to the number of at least a dozen distinct species--differing not only in size, shape, and colour, but also in many more essential characteristics.  Bears have been found in North America, and others in South America; some in Asia, and still others in the islands of the Indian Archipelago; entirely unlike the brown bear of Europe, as they are to one another.  As the _Brown bear_ is the oldest of the family known to naturalists, I shall give him the precedence in this little monograph.  It is a misnomer"]]]
