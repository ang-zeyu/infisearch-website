Of course, he didn't deserve any of the praise he was getting, he knew. He'd just happened to walk in on the Gorelik kidnapers because his telephone had been out of order. And the Transom ring hadn't been just his job. After all, if other agents hadn't managed to trace the counterfeit bills back to a common area in Cincinnati, he'd never have been able to complete his part of the assignment. But it was nice to be praised, anyhow. Malone felt a twinge of guilt, and told himself sternly to relax and enjoy himself.  \"That's what I said,\" Burris told him. \"Relaxation.\"  \"Well,\" Malone said, \"I certainly would like a vacation, that's for sure. I'd like to snooze for a couple of weeks, or maybe go up to Cape Cod for a while. There's a lot of nice scenery up around there. It's restful, sort of, and I could just--\"  He stopped. Burris was frowning, and when Andrew J. Burris frowned it was a good idea to look attentive, interested, and alert. \"Now, Malone,\" Burris said sadly, \"I wasn't exactly thinking about a vacation. You're not scheduled for one until August, you know.\"  \"Oh, I know, Chief,\" Malone said. \"But I thought--\"  \"Much as I'd like to,\" Burris said, \"I just can't make an exception; you know that, Malone. I've got to go pretty much by the schedule.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said, feeling just a shade disappointed.  \"But I do think you deserve a rest,\" Burris said.  \"Well, if I--\"  \"Here's what I'm going to do,\" Burris said, and paused. Malone felt a little unsure as to exactly what his chief was talking about, but by now he knew better than to ask a lot of questions. Sooner or later, Burris would probably explain himself. And if he didn't, then there was no use worrying about it. That was just the way Burris acted.  \"Suppose I gave you a chance to take it easy for a while,\" Burris said. \"You could catch up on your sleep, see some shows, have a couple of drinks during the evening, take girls out for dinner--you know. Something like that. How would you like it?\"  \"Well...\" Malone said cautiously.  \"Good,\" Burris said. \"I knew you would.\"  Malone opened his mouth, thought briefly and closed it again. After all, it did sound sort of promising, and if there was a catch in it he'd find out about it soon enough.  \"It's really just a routine case,\" Burris said in an offhand tone. \"Nothing to it.\"  \"Oh,\" Malone said.  \"There's this red Cadillac,\" Burris said. \"It was stolen from a party in Connecticut, out near Danbury, and it showed up in New York City. Now, the car's crossed a state line.\"  \"That puts it in our jurisdiction,\" Malone said, feeling obvious.  \"Right,\" Burris said. \"Right on the nose.\"  \"But the New York office--\"  \"Naturally, they're in charge of everything,\" Burris said. \"But I'm sending you out as sort of a special observer. Just keep your eyes open, and nose around and let me know what's happening.\"  \"Keep my eyes and nose what?\" Malone said.  \"Open,\" Burris said. \"And let me know about it.\"  Malone tried to picture himself with his eyes and nose open, and decided he didn't look very attractive that way. Well, it was only a figure of speech or something. He didn't have to think about it.  It really made a very ugly picture.  \"But why a special observer?\" he said after a second. Burris could read the reports from the New York office, and probably get more facts than any single agent could find out just wandering around a strange city. It sounded as if there were something, Malone told himself, just a tiny shade rotten in Denmark. It sounded as if there were going to be something in the nice easy assignment he was getting that would make him wish he'd gone lion hunting in Darkest Africa instead.  And then again, maybe he was wrong. He stood at ease and waited to find out.  \"Well,\" Burris said, \"it is just a routine case. Just like I said. But there seems to be something a little bit odd about it.\"  \"I see,\" Malone said with a sinking feeling.  \"Here's what happened,\" Burris said hurriedly, as if he were afraid Malone was going to change his mind and refuse the assignment. \"This red Cadillac I told you about was reported stolen from Danbury. Three days later, it turned up in New York City--parked smack across the street from a precinct police station. Of course it took them a while to wake up, but one of the officers happened to notice the routine report on stolen cars in the area, and he decided to go across the street and check the license number on the car. Then something funny happened.\"  \"Something funny?\" Malone asked. He doubted that, whatever it was, it was going to make him laugh. But he kept his face a careful, receptive blank.  \"That's right,\" Burris said. \"Now, if you're going to understand what happened, you've got to get the whole picture.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said.  \"Only that isn't what I mean,\" Burris added suddenly.  Malone blinked. \"_What_ isn't what you mean?\" he said.  \"Understanding what happened,\" Burris said. \"That's the trouble. You won't understand what happened. I don't understand it, and neither does anybody else. So what do you think about it?\"  \"Think about what?\" Malone said.  \"About what I've been telling you,\" Burris snapped. \"This car.\"  Malone took a deep breath. \"Well,\" he said, \"this officer went over to check the license plate. It seems like the right thing to do. It's just what I'd have done myself.\"  \"Sure you would,\" Burris said. \"Anybody would. But listen to me.\"  \"All right, Chief,\" Malone said.  \"It was just after dawn--early in the morning.\" Malone wondered briefly if there were parts of the world where dawn came, say, late in the afternoon, or during the evening sometime, but he said nothing. \"The street was deserted,\" Burris went on. \"But it was pretty light out, and the witnesses are willing to swear that there was nobody on that street for a block in either direction. Except them, of course.\"  \"Except who?\" Malone said.  \"Except the witnesses,\" Burris said patiently. \"Four cops, police officers who were standing on the front steps of the precinct station, talking. They were waiting to go on duty, or anyhow that's what the report said. It's lucky they were there, for whatever reason; they're the only witnesses we've got.\"  Burris stopped. Malone waited a few seconds and then said, as calmly as he could, \"Witnesses to what?\"  \"To this whole business with Sergeant Jukovsky,\" Burris said.  The sudden introduction of a completely new name confused Malone for an instant, but he recovered gamely. \"Sergeant Jukovsky was the man who investigated the car,\" he said.  \"That's right,\" Burris said. \"Except that he didn't.\"  Malone sighed.  \"Those four officers--the witnesses--they weren't paying much attention to what looked like the routine investigation of a parked car,\" Burris said. \"But here's their testimony. They were standing around talking when this Sergeant Jukovsky came out of the station, spoke to them in passing, and went on across the street. He didn't seem very worried or alarmed about anything.\"  \"Good,\" Malone said involuntarily. \"I mean, go on, Chief,\" he added.  \"Ah,\" Burris said. \"All right. Well. According to Jukovsky, he took a look at the plate and found the numbers checked the listing he had for a stolen Connecticut car. Then he walked around to take a look inside the car. It was empty. Get that, Malone. The car was empty.\"  \"Well,\" Malone said, \"it was parked. I suppose parked cars are usually empty. What's special about this one?\"  \"Wait and see,\" Burris said ominously. \"Jukovsky swears the car was empty. He tried the doors, and they were all locked but one, the front door on the curb side, the driver's door. So he opened it, and leaned over to have a look at the odometer to check the mileage. And something clobbered him on the back of the head.\"  \"One of the other cops,\" Malone said.  \"One of the--who?\" Burris said. \"No. Not the cops. Not at all.\"  \"Then something fell on him,\" Malone said. \"Okay. Then whatever fell on him ought to be--\"  \"Malone,\" Burris said.  \"Yes, Chief?\"  \"Jukovsky woke up on the sidewalk with the other cops all around him. There was nothing on that sidewalk but Jukovsky. Nothing could have fallen on him; it hadn't landed anywhere, if you see what I mean.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But--\"  \"Whatever it was,\" Burris said, \"they didn't find it. But that isn't the peculiar thing.\"  \"No?\"  \"No,\" Burris said slowly. \"Now--\"  \"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"They looked on the sidewalk and around there. But did they think to search the car?\"  \"They didn't get a chance,\" Burris said. \"Anyhow, not then. Not until they got around to picking up the pieces of the car uptown at 125th Street.\"  Malone closed his eyes. \"Where was this precinct?\" he said.  \"Midtown,\" Burris said. \"In the forties.\"  \"And the pieces of the car were eighty blocks away when they searched it?\" Malone said.  Burris nodded.  \"All right,\" Malone said pleasantly. \"I give up.\"  \"Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you,\" Burris said. \"According to the witnesses, after Jukovsky fell out of the car, the motor started and the car drove off uptown.\"  \"Oh,\" Malone said. He thought about that for a minute and decided at last to hazard one little question. It sounded silly--but then, what didn't? \"The car just drove off all by itself?\" he said.  Burris seemed abashed. \"Well, Malone,\" he said carefully, \"that's where the conflicting stories of the eyewitnesses don't agree. You see, two of the cops say there was nobody in the car. Nobody at all. Of any kind. Small or large.\"  \"And the other two?\" Malone said.  \"The other two swear they saw somebody at the wheel,\" Burris said, \"but they won't say whether it was a man, a woman, a small child, or an anthropoid ape. And they haven't the faintest idea where he, she, or it came from.\"  \"Great,\" Malone said. He felt a little tired.

He was still trying to feel resigned, but he wasn’t succeeding very well.  “And if you don’t find anything—” Burris began.  “I’ll come right back,” Malone said instantly.  “No,” Burris said. “You keep on looking.”  “I do?”  “You do,” Burris said. “After all, there has to be _something_ wrong.”  “Sure,” Malone said, “if you say so. But—”  “There are the interview tapes,” Burris said, “and the reports the Congressmen brought in. You can go through those.”  Malone sighed. “I guess so,” he said.  “And there must be thousands of other things to do,” Burris said.  “Well—” Malone began cautiously.  “You’ll be able to think of them,” Burris said heartily. “I know you will. I have confidence in you, Malone. Confidence.”  “Thanks,” Malone said sadly.  “You just keep me posted from time to time on what you’re doing, and what ideas you get,” Burris said. “I’m leaving the whole thing in your hands, Malone, and I’m sure you won’t disappoint me.”  “I’ll try,” Malone said.  “I know you will,” Burris said warmly. “And no matter how long it takes, I know you’ll succeed.”  “No matter how long it takes?” Malone said hesitantly.  “That’s right!” Burris said. “You can do it, Malone! You can do it.”  Malone nodded slowly. “I hope so,” he said. “Well, I—Well, I’ll start out right away, then.”  He turned. Before he could make another move Burris said, “Wait!”  Malone turned again, hope in his eyes. “Yes, sir?” he said.  “When you leave—” Burris began, and the hope disappeared. “When you leave,” he went on, “please do one little favor for me. Just one little favor, because I’m an old, tired man and I’m not used to things any more.”  “Sure,” Malone said. “Anything, Chief.”  “Don’t call me—”  “Sorry,” Malone said.  Burris breathed heavily. “When you leave,” he said, “please, please use the door.”  “But—”  “Malone,” Burris said, “I’ve tried. I’ve really tried. Believe me. I’ve tried to get used to the fact that you can teleport. But—”  “It’s useful,” Malone said, “in my work.”  “I can see that,” Burris said. “And I don’t want you to, well, to stop doing it. By no means. It’s just that it sort of unnerves me, if you see what I mean. No matter how useful it is for the FBI to have an agent who can go instantaneously from one place to another, it unnerves me.” He sighed. “I can’t get used to seeing you disappear like an overdried soap bubble, Malone. It does something to me, here.” He placed a hand directly over his sternum and sighed again.  “I can understand that,” Malone said. “It unnerved me, too, the first time I saw it. I thought I was going crazy, when that kid—Mike Fueyo—winked out like a light. But then we got him, and some FBI agents besides me have learned the trick.” He stopped there, wondering if he’d been tactful. After all, it took a latent ability to learn teleportation, and some people had it, while others didn’t. Malone, along with a few other agents, did. Burris evidently didn’t, so he couldn’t teleport, no matter how hard he tried or how many lessons he took.  “Well,” Burris said, “I’m still unnerved. So please, Malone, when you come in here, or go out, use the door. All right?”  “Yes, sir,” Malone said. He turned and went out. As he opened the door, he could almost hear Burris’ sigh of relief. Then he banged it shut behind him and, feeling that he might as well continue with his space-bound existence, walked all the way to the elevator, and rode it downstairs to the FBI laboratories.  The labs, highly efficient and divided into dozens of departments, covered several floors. Malone passed through the Fingerprint section, filled with technicians doing strange things to great charts and slides, and frowning over tiny pieces of material and photographs. Then came Forgery Detection, involving many more technicians, many more slides and charts and tiny pieces of things and photographs, and even a witness or two sitting on the white bench at one side and looking lost and somehow civilian. Identification Classified was next, a great barn of a room filled with index files. The real indexes were in the sub-basement; here, on microfilm, were only the basic divisions. A man was standing in front of one of the files, frowning at it. Malone went on by without stopping.  Cosmetic Surgery Classification came next. Here there were more indexes, and there were also charts and slides. There was an agent sitting on a bench looking bored while two female technicians— classified as O&U for Old and Ugly in Malone’s mind—fluttered around him, deciding what disguises were possible, and which of those was indicated for the particular job on hand. Malone waved to the agent, whom he knew very slightly, and went on. He felt vaguely regretful that the FBI couldn’t hire prettier girls for Cosmetic Surgery, but the trouble was that pretty girls fell for the Agents, and vice versa, and this led to an unfortunate tendency toward only handsome and virile-looking disguises. The O&U division was unfortunate, he decided, but a necessity.  Chemical Analysis (III) was next. The Chemical Analysis Section was scattered over several floors, with the first stages up above. Division III, Malone remembered, was devoted to nonpoisonous substances, like clay or sand found in boots or trouser cuffs, cigar ashes and such. They were placed on the same floor as Fingerprints to allow free and frequent passage between the sections on the problems of plastic prints, made in putty or like substances, and visible prints, made when the hand is covered with a visible substance like blood, ketchup or glue.  Malone found what he was looking for at the very end of the floor. It was the Computer Section, a large room filled with humming, clacking and buzzing machines of an ancient vintage, muttering to themselves as they worked, and newer machines which were smaller and more silent. Lights were lighting and bells were ringing softly, relays were relaying and the whole room was a gigantic maze of calculating and control machines. What space wasn’t filled by the machines themselves was filled by workbenches, all littered with an assortment of gears, tubes, spare relays, transistors, wires, rods, bolts, resistors and all the other paraphernalia used in building the machines and repairing them. Beyond the basic room were other, smaller rooms, each assigned to a particular kind of computer work.  The narrow aisles were choked here and there with men who looked up as Malone passed by, but most of them gave him one quick glance and went back to work. A few didn’t even do that, but went right on concentrating on their jobs. Malone headed for a man working all alone in front of a workbench, frowning down at a complicated-looking mechanism that seemed to have neither head nor tail, and prodding at it with a long, thin screwdriver. The man was thin, too, but not very long; he was a little under average height, and he had straight black hair, thick-lensed glasses and a studious expression, even when he was frowning. He looked as if the mechanism were a student who had cut too many classes, and he was being kind but firm with it.  Malone managed to get to the man’s side, and coughed discreetly. There was no response.  “Fred?” he said.  The screwdriver waggled a little. Malone wasn’t quite sure that the man was breathing.  “Fred Mitchell,” he said.  Mitchell didn’t look up. Another second passed.  “Hey,” Malone said. Then he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “Fred,” he said in a loud, reasonable-sounding voice, “the State Department’s translator has started to talk pig-Latin.”  Mitchell straightened up as if somebody had jabbed him with a pin. The screwdriver waved wildly in the air for a second, and then pointed at Malone. “That’s impossible,” Mitchell said in a flat, precise voice. “Simply impossible. It doesn’t have a pig-Latin circuit. It can’t possibly—” He blinked and seemed to see Malone for the first time. “Oh,” he said. “Hello, Malone. What can I do for you?”  Malone smiled, feeling a little victorious at having got through the Mitchell armor, which was almost impregnable when there was a job in hand. “I’ve been standing here talking to you for some time.”  “Oh, have you?” Mitchell said. “I was busy.” That, obviously, explained that. Malone shrugged.  “I want you to help me check over some calculators, Fred,” he said. “We’ve had some reports that some of the government machines are out of kilter, and I’d like you to go over them for me.”  “Out of kilter?” Fred Mitchell said. “No, you can forget about it. It’s absolutely unnecessary to make a check, believe me. Absolutely. Forget it.” He smiled suddenly. “I suppose it’s some kind of a joke, isn’t it?” he said, just a trifle uncertainly. Fred Mitchell’s world, while pleasant, did not include much humor, Malone knew. “It’s supposed to be funny,” he said in the same flat, precise voice.  “It isn’t funny,” Malone said.  Fred sighed. “Then they’re obviously lying,” he said, “and that’s all there is to it. Why bother me with it?”  “Lying, Fred?” Malone said.  “Certainly,” Fred said. He looked at the machinery with longing.  Malone took a breath. “How do you know?” he said.  Fred sighed. “It’s perfectly obvious,” he said in a patient tone. “Since the State Department translator has no pig-Latin circuit, it can’t possibly be talking pig-Latin. I will admit that such a circuit would be relatively easy to build, though it would have no utility as far as I can see. Except, of course, for a joke.” He paused. “Joke?” he said, in a slightly uneasy tone.  “Sure,” Malone said. “Joke.”  Mitchell looked relieved. “Very well, then,” he began. “Since—”  “Wait a minute,” Malone said. “The pig-Latin is a joke. That’s right. But I’m not talking about the pig-Latin.”  “You’re not?” Mitchell asked, surprised.  “No,” Malone said.  Mitchell frowned. “But you said—” he began.  “A joke,” Malone said. “You were perfectly right. The pig-Latin is a joke.” He waited for Fred’s expression "]]]
