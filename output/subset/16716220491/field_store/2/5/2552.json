Humor is thus seen to have the same effect upon a body of musicians as oil applied to machinery, and musical machinery seems to need more of this kind of lubrication than almost any other variety.  But the conductor must distinguish carefully between sarcastic wit, which laughs _at_, and humor, which laughs _with_. In a book bearing the copyright date of 1849, the writer distinguishes between the two, in the following words:[1]       Humor originally meant moisture, a signification it      metaphorically retains, for it is the very juice of the      mind, enriching and fertilizing where it falls. Wit laughs      at; humor laughs with. Wit lashes external appearances, or      cunningly exchanges single foibles into character; humor      glides into the heart of its object, looks lovingly upon the      infirmities it attacks, and represents the whole man. Wit is      abrupt, scornful ...; humor is slow and shy, insinuating its      fun into your heart.  [Footnote 1: Whipple, _Literature and Life_, p. 91.]  [Sidenote: THE VALUE OF A CHEERFUL ATTITUDE]  The conductor with a sense of humor will ordinarily have the advantage also of being cheerful in his attitude toward the performers, and this is an asset of no mean significance. It is a well-known psychophysical fact that the human body does much better work when the mind is free from care, and that in any profession or vocation, other things being equal, the worker who is cheerful and optimistic will perform his labor much more efficiently at the expense of considerably less mental and bodily energy than he who is ill-humored, worried, fretful, and unable to take a joke. But the _foreman_ who possesses this quality of cheerfulness and humor is doubly fortunate, for he not only secures the beneficial results in his own case, but by his attitude frequently arouses the same desirable state of mind and body in those who are working under him. It is particularly because of this latter fact that the conductor needs to cultivate a cheerful, even a humorous outlook, especially in the rehearsal. As the result of forming this habit, he will be enabled to give directions in such a way that they will be obeyed cheerfully (and consequently more effectively); he will find it possible to rehearse longer with less fatigue both to himself and to his musical forces; and he will be able to digest his food and to sleep soundly after the rehearsal because he is not worrying over trivial annoyances that, after all, should have been dismissed with a laugh as soon as they appeared. There must not of course be so much levity that the effectiveness of the rehearsal will be endangered, but there is not much likelihood that this will happen; whereas there seems to be considerable danger that our rehearsals will become too cold and formal. A writer on the psychology of laughter states that \"laughter is man's best friend\";[2] and in another place (p. 342) says that the smile always brings to the mind \"relaxation from strain.\"  [Footnote 2: Sully, _An Essay on Laughter_.]  [Sidenote: THE VALUE OF IMAGINATION IN CONDUCTING]  Creative imagination is an inborn quality--\"a gift of the gods\"--and if the individual does not possess it, very little can be done for him in the artistic realm. Constructive or creative imagination implies the ability to combine known elements in new ways--_to use the mind forwards_, as it were. The possession of this trait makes it possible to picture to oneself how things are going to look or sound or feel before any actual sense experience has taken place; to see into people's minds and often find out in advance how they are going to react to a projected situation; to combine chemical elements in new ways and thus create new substances; to plan details of organization in a manufacturing establishment or in an educational institution, and to be able to forecast how these things are going to work out.  It is this quality of creative imagination that enables the inventor to project his mind into the future and see a continent spanned by railways and telephones, and the barrier of an ocean broken down by means of wireless and aeroplane; and in every case the inventor works with old and well-known materials, being merely enabled by the power of his creative faculties (as they are erroneously called) to combine these known materials in new ways.  In the case of the musician, such creative imagination has always been recognized as a _sine qua non_ of original composition, but its necessity has not always been so clearly felt in the case of the performer. Upon analyzing the situation it becomes evident, however, that the performer cannot possibly get from the composer his real message unless he can follow him in his imagination, and thus re-create the work. As for adding anything original to what the composer has given, this is plainly out of the question unless the interpreter is endowed somewhat extensively with creative imagination; and the possession of this quality will enable him to introduce such subtle variations from a cut-and-dried, merely _accurate_ rendition as will make his performance seem really spontaneous, and will inevitably arouse a more enthusiastic emotional response in the listeners.  Weingartner sums up the value of imagination in the final paragraph of one of the few really valuable books on conducting at our disposal.[3]       More and more I have come to think that what decides the      worth of conducting is the degree of suggestive power that      the conductor can exercise over the performers. At the      rehearsals he is mostly nothing more than a workman, who      schools the men under him so conscientiously and precisely      that each of them knows his place and what he has to do      there; he first becomes an artist when the moment comes for      the production of the work. Not even the most assiduous      rehearsing, so necessary a prerequisite as this is, can so      stimulate the capacities of the players as the force of      imagination of the conductor. It is not the transference of      his personal will, but the mysterious act of creation that      called the work itself into being takes place again in him,      and transcending the narrow limits of reproduction, he      becomes a new-creator, a self-creator.  [Footnote 3: Weingartner, _On Conducting_, translated by Ernest Newman, p. 56.]  This quality is indispensable to all musicians, be they creators or performers, but is especially desirable in the conductor, for he needs it not only from the standpoint of interpretation, as already noted, but from that of manager or organizer. Upon this latter point we shall have more to say later, but it may be well to state just here that if the conductor could imagine what was going on in the minds of his players or singers, and could see things from their viewpoint; if he could forecast the effect of his explanatory directions or of his disciplinary rulings, nine-tenths of all the quarreling, bickering, and general dissatisfaction that so frequently mar the work of any musical organization could easily be eliminated. We might also add that if the conductor could only foresee the effect upon his audiences of certain works, or of certain interpretations, his plans would probably often be materially altered.  [Sidenote: ORGANIZING ABILITY AND A SENSE OF LEADERSHIP]  But the conductor must be more than a humorous-minded and imaginative musician. He must also (especially in these modern times) be an organizer, a business man, a leader. The qualities of leadership and organizing ability are so closely connected that we shall for the most part treat them together in our discussion, and they are so important that a fairly extensive analysis will be attempted.  In an article on Schumann in _Grove's Dictionary_ Dr. Philip Spitta, the well-known historian and critic, comments upon the conducting of this famous composer as follows:[4]       Schumann was sadly wanting in the real talent for      conducting. All who ever saw him conduct or played under his      direction are agreed on this point. Irrespective of the fact      that conducting for any length of time tired him out, he had      neither the collectedness and prompt presence of mind, nor      the sympathetic faculty, nor the enterprising dash, without      each of which conducting in the true sense is impossible.      He even found difficulty in starting at a given tempo; nay,      he even sometimes shrank from giving any initial beat, so      that some energetic pioneer would begin without waiting for      the signal, and without incurring Schumann's wrath! Besides      this, any thorough practice, bit by bit, with his orchestra,      with instructive remarks by the way as to the mode of      execution, was impossible to this great artist, who in this      respect was a striking contrast to Mendelssohn. He would      have a piece played through, and if it did not answer to his      wishes, have it repeated. If it went no better the second or      perhaps third time, he would be extremely angry at what he      considered the clumsiness, or even the ill-will of the      players; but detailed remarks he never made.  [Footnote 4: _Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians_, New Edition, Vol. IV, p. 363.]  This estimate of Schumann's work as a conductor demonstrates unmistakably that he failed in this particular field, not because his musical scholarship was not adequate, but because he did not have that peculiar ability which enables one man to dominate others: _viz._, _a sense of leadership_, or _personal magnetism_, as it is often called. Seidl asserts[5] that Berlioz, Massenet, and Saint-SaÃ«ns likewise failed as conductors, in spite of recognized musicianship; and it is of course well known that even Beethoven and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22396"],["title","King Arthur's Knights (#1)"],["body","years that the pagan will at the last drive my people into the western sea, and that the name of Christ shall die out of this fair land, and the foul pagan possess it. But thy words give me great heart.'  'Nay, sir,' said Merlin, 'take comfort. Great power will come to this people in a near time, and they shall conquer all their enemies.'  Anon the king slept, and lay thus for three further days, neither speaking nor moving. Many great lords and barons came craving to speak with Merlin, asking if the king were not better. But, looking into their crafty eyes, and seeing there the pride and ambitions of their hearts, Merlin knew that they wished the king were already dead; for all thought that King Uther had no son to take the kingdom after him, and each great baron, strong in men, plotted to win the overlordship when the king should be gone.  'If he dieth and sayeth not which he shall name to succeed him,' some asked, 'say, Merlin, what's to be done?'  'I shall tell you,' said Merlin. 'Come ye all into this chamber to-morrow's morn, and, if God so wills, I will make the king speak.'  Next morn, therefore, came all the great barons and lords into the high hall of the palace, and many were the proud and haughty glances passing among them. There was King Lot of Orkney, small and slim, with his dark narrow face and crafty eyes under pent eyebrows; King Uriens of Reged, tall and well-seeming, with grim eyes war-wise, fresh from the long harrying of the fleeing pagans; King Mark of Tintagel, burly of form, crafty and mean of look; King Nentres of Garlot, ruddy of face, blusterous of manner, who tried to hide cunning under a guise of honesty; and many others, as Duke Cambenet of Loidis, King Brandegoris of Stranggore, King Morkant of Strathclyde, King Clariance of Northumberland, King Kador of Cornwall, and King Idres of Silura.  Now, when all these were assembled about the bed of Uther, Merlin went to the side of the sleeping king, and looked long and earnestly upon his closed eyes. Anon he passed his hands above the face of the king, and Uther instantly awoke, and looked about him as if startled.  'Lord,' said Merlin, 'God's hand is drawing you to Him, and these your lords desire you to name your successor ere you pass from life. Is it not your desire that your son Arthur shall take the kingdom after you, with your blessing?'  Those who craned towards the bed started and looked darkly at Merlin and then at each other; for none had heard of the son whom the wizard named Arthur. Then in the deep silence the dying king raised his hand in the sign of blessing, and in a hollow whisper said:  'Such is my desire. With God's blessing I wish my son Arthur to take this kingdom after me, and all that love me must follow him.'  His eyes closed, a shiver passed down the tall frame as it lay beneath the clothes, and with a sigh the soul of Uther sped.  In a few days the king was buried in all solemnity with the dead of his kindred in the Roman temple that had been made a church, where now stands St. Paul's. Thereafter men waited and wondered, for the land was without a king, and none knew who was rightfully heir to the throne.  As the days went by, men gathered in groups in the market-place of London, whispering the rumours that mysteriously began to fly from mouth to mouth,--how King Lot of Orkney and Lothian was gathering his knights and men-at-arms; and King Uriens and Duke Cambenet of Loidis had got together a great host, although the remnant of the pagans had fled the country. The faces of the citizens went gloomy as they thought of the griefs of civil war, of the terrors of the sack of cities, the ruin of homes, the death of dear ones, and the loss of riches. Nevertheless, some were already wagering which of the great lords would conquer the others, and take to himself the crown of Britain and the title of Pendragon.  As it neared the feast of Christmas, men heard that the Archbishop of London, who was then chief ruler of the Church, had sent his letters to each and all the great nobles, bidding them come to a great council to be holden at the church of St. Paul at Christmas.  When men heard that this was done by the advice of Merlin, faces lightened and looked more joyful.  'Now shall things go right,' said they, 'for the old, old Merlin hath the deepest wisdom of all the earth.'  On Christmas Eve the city throbbed with the clank of arms and the tramp of the great retinues of princes, kings and powerful lords who had come at the archbishop's summons, and by day and night the narrow ways were crowded with armed men. Long ere the dawn of Christmas Day, the lords and the common people betook themselves along the wide road which led across to the church, which then stood in a wide space amid fields, and all knelt therein to mass.  While it was yet dark a great strange cry rang out in the churchyard. Some ran forth, and there by the wall behind the high altar they saw a vast stone, four-square, that had not been there before, and in the middle thereof was stuck a great wedge of steel, and sticking therefrom by the point was a rich sword. On the blade were written words in Latin, which a clerk read forth, which said, 'Whoso pulleth this sword out of this stone and wedge of steel is rightwise born King of all Britain.'  The clerk ran into the church and told the archbishop, and men were all amazed and would have gone instantly to see this marvel, but the archbishop bade them stay.  'Finish your prayers to God,' he said, 'for no man may touch this strange thing till high mass be done.'  When mass was finished, all poured forth from the church and thronged about the stone, and marvelled at the words on the sword. First King Lot, with a light laugh, took hold of the handle and essayed to pull out the point of the sword, but he could not, and his face went hot and angry. Then King Nentres of Garlot took his place with a jest, but though he heaved at the sword with all his burly strength, till it seemed like to snap, he could not move it, and so let go at last with an angry oath. All the others essayed in like manner, but by none was it moved a jot, and all stood about discomfited, looking with black looks at one another and the stone.  'He that is rightwise born ruler of Britain is not here,' said the archbishop at length, 'but doubt not he shall come in God's good time. Meanwhile, let a tent be raised over the stone, and do ye lords appoint ten of your number to watch over it, and we will essay the sword again after New Year's Day.'  So that the kings and lords should be kept together, the archbishop appointed a great tournament to be held on New Year's Day on the waste land north of the city, which men now call Smithfield.  Now when the day was come, a certain lord, Sir Ector de Morven, who had great lands about the isle of Thorney, rode towards the jousts with his son, Sir Kay, and young Arthur, who was Sir Kay's foster-brother. When they had got nearly to the place, suddenly Sir Kay bethought him that he had left his sword at home.  'Do you ride back, young Arthur,' he said, 'and fetch me my sword, for if I do not have it I may not fight.'  Willingly Arthur turned his horse and rode back swiftly. But when he had arrived at the house, he found it shut up and none was within, for all had gone to the jousts. Then was he a little wroth, and rode back wondering how he should obtain a sword for his foster-brother.  Suddenly, as he saw the tower of St. Paul's church through the trees, he bethought him of the sword in the stone, about which many men had spoken in his hearing.  'I will ride thither,' said he, 'and see if I may get that sword for my brother, for he shall not be without a sword this day.'  When he came to the churchyard, he tied his horse to the stile, and went through the grave-mounds to the tent wherein was the sword. He found the place unwatched, and the flashing sword was sticking by the point in the stone.  Lightly he grasped the handle of the sword with one hand, and it came forth straightway!  Then, glad that his brother should not be without a sword, he swiftly gat upon his horse and rode on, and delivered the sword to Sir Kay, and thought no more of aught but the splendid knights and richly garbed lords that were at the jousts.  But Sir Kay looked at the sword, and the writing, and knew it was the sword of the stone, and marvelled how young Arthur had possessed himself thereof; and being of a covetous and sour mind he thought how he might make advantage for himself. He went to his father, Sir Ector, and said:  'Lo, father, this is the sword of the stone, and surely am I rightful king.'  Sir Ector knew the sword and marvelled, but his look was stern as he gazed into the crafty eyes of his son.  'Come ye with me,' he said, and all three rode to the church, and alit from their horses and went in.  Sir Ector strode up the aisle to the altar, and turning to his son, said sternly:  'Now, swear on God's book and the holy relics how thou didst get this sword.'  Sir Kay's heart went weak, and he stammered out the truth.  'How gat you this sword?' asked Sir Ector of Arthur.  'Sir, I will tell you,' said Arthur, and so told him all as it had happened.  Sir Ector marvelled what this should mean; for Arthur had been given to him to nourish and rear as a week-old child by Merlin, but the wizard had only told him that the babe was a son of a dead lady, whose lord had been slain by the pagans.  Then Sir Ector went to the stone and bade Arthur put back the sword into the wedge of steel, which the young man did easily.  Thereupon Sir Ector strove with all his strength to draw the sword forth again, but though he pulled till he sweated, he could not stir the sword.  'Now you essay it,' he said to his son. But naught that Sir Kay could do availed.  'Now do you try,' he bade Arthur.  Arthur lightly grasped the handle with one hand, and the sword came out without hindrance.  Therewith Sir Ector sank to his knees, and Sir Kay also."]]]
