Come promptly at eight o'clock, prepared to stay all day, and bring this card with you.\"  He waved the bit of pasteboard to and fro in the air an instant to be certain that the ink on it was dry and afterward handed it to Ted. Instinctively the boy's gaze dropped to the message written upon it and before he realized it he had read the brief words:      \"Ted Turner. He says he has farmed in Vermont. If he shows any     evidence of it keep him. If not turn him off. Wharton.\"  The man in the chair watched him as he read.  \"Well?\" said he.  \"I beg your pardon, sir. I did not mean to read it,\" Ted replied with a start. \"I'm very much obliged to you for giving me the job.\"  \"I don't see that you've got it yet.\"  \"But I shall have,\" asserted the lad confidently. \"All I asked was a chance.\"  \"That's all the world gives any of us,\" responded the manager gruffly, as he drew forth a sheet of paper and began to write. \"Nobody can develop our brains, train our muscles, or save our souls but ourselves.\"  With this terse observation he turned his back on the boy, and after loitering a moment to make sure that he had nothing more to say, the lad slipped away, triumphantly bearing with him the coveted morsel of yellow pasteboard. That its import was noncommittal and even contained a tang of skepticism troubled him not a whit. The chief thing was that he had wrested from the manager an opportunity, no matter how grudgingly accorded, to show what he was worth. He could farm and he knew it and he had no doubt that he could demonstrate the fact to any boss he might encounter.  Therefore with high courage he was promptly on hand the next morning and even before the time assigned he approached Stevens, the superintendent.  \"What do you want, youngster?\" demanded the man sharply. He was in a hurry and it was obvious that something had nettled him and that he was in no humor to be delayed.  \"I came to help with the haying.\"  \"We don't want any boys as young as you,\" Stevens returned, moving away.  \"I've a card from Mr. Wharton.\"  \"A card, eh? Why didn't you say so in the first place? Shell it out.\"  Shyly Ted produced his magic fragment of paper which the overseer read with disapproval in his glance.  \"Well, since Wharton wants you tried out, you can pitch in with the crowd,\" grumbled he. \"But I still think you're too young. I've had boys your age before and never found them any earthly use. However, you won't be here long if you're not--that's one thing. You'll find a pitchfork in the barn. Follow along behind the men who are mowing and spread the grass out.\"  \"I know.\"  \"Oh, you do, do you! Trust people your size for knowing everything.\"  To the final remark the lad vouchsafed no reply. Instead he moved away and soon returned, fork in hand. What a flood of old memories came surging back with the touch of the implement! Again he was in Vermont in the stretch of mowings that fronted the old white house where he was born. The scent of the hay in his nostrils stirred him like an elixir, and with a thrill of pleasure he set to work. He had not anticipated toiling out there in the hot sunshine at a task which he had always disliked; but to-day, by a strange miracle, it did not seem to be a task so much as a privilege.  How familiar the scene was! As he approached the group of older men it took him only a second to see where he was needed and he thrust his pitchfork into the swath at his feet with a swing of easy grace.  \"Guess you've done this job before,\" called a man behind him after he had worked for an interval.  \"Yes, I have.\"  \"You show it,\" was the brief observation.  They moved on in silence up the field.  \"Where'd you learn to handle that fork, sonny?\" another voice shouted, as they neared the farther wall.  \"In Vermont,\" laughed Ted.  \"I judged as much,\" grunted the speaker. \"They don't train up farmers of your size in this part of the world.\"  Ted flushed with pleasure and for the first time he stopped work and mopped the perspiration from his forehead. He was hot and thirsty but he found himself strangely exhilarated by the exercise and the sweet morning air and sunshine. Again he took up his fork and tossed the newly cut grass up into the light, spreading it on the ground with a methodical sweep of his young arm. The sun had risen higher now and its dazzling brilliance poured all about him. Up and down the meadow he went and presently he was surprised to find himself alone near the point from which he had started. His fellow-laborers were no longer in sight. The field was very still and because it was, Ted began to whistle softly to himself.  He was startled to hear a quiet laugh at his elbow.  \"Don't you ever eat anything, kid?\"  Mr. Wharton was standing beside him, a flicker of amusement in his gray eyes.  \"I didn't know it was noon,\" gasped Ted.  \"We'll have to tie an alarm clock on you,\" chuckled the manager. \"The gang stopped work a quarter of an hour ago.\"  \"I didn't notice they had.\"  The boy flushed. He felt very foolish to have been discovered working there all by himself in this ridiculous fashion.  \"I wanted to finish this side of the field and I forgot about the time,\" he stammered apologetically.  \"Have you done it to your satisfaction?\"  \"Yes, I'm just through.\"  For the life of him Ted could not tell whether the manager was laughing at him or not. He kicked the turf sheepishly.  \"Aren't you tired?\" inquired Mr. Wharton at length.  \"No--at least--well, I haven't thought about it. Perhaps I am a little.\"  \"And well you may be. You've put in a stiff morning's work. You'd better go and wash up now and eat your lunch. Take your full hour of rest. No matter if the others do get back here before you. Stevens says you are worth any two of them, anyway.\"  \"It's just that I'm used to it,\" was the modest reply.  \"We'll let it go at that,\" Mr. Wharton returned ambiguously. \"And one thing more before you go. You needn't worry about staying on. We can use you one way or another all summer. There'll always be work for a boy who knows how to do a job well.\"     CHAPTER III  GOING TO HOUSEKEEPING   Thus it came about that Ted Turner began the long, golden days of his summer vacation at the great estates of the Fernalds, and soon he had made himself such an indispensable part of the farming staff that both Mr. Wharton and Mr. Stevens came to rely on him for many services outside of those usually turned over to the men.  \"Just step over to the south lot at Pine Lea, Ted, and see if those fellows are thinning the beets properly,\" Mr. Wharton would say. \"I gave them their orders but they may not have taken them in. You know how the thing should be done. Sing out to them if they are not doing the job right.\"  Or:  \"Mr. Stevens and I shall be busy this morning checking up the pay roll. Suppose you have an eye on the hilling up of the potatoes, Ted. Show the men how you want it done and start them at it. I'll be over later to see how it's going.\"  Frequently, instead of working, the boy was called in to give an opinion on some agricultural matter with which he had had experience.  \"We are finding white grubs in the corner of the Pine Lea garden. They are gnawing off the roots of the plants and making no end of trouble. What did you do to get rid of them when you were up in Vermont?\"  \"Salt and wood ashes worked better than anything else,\" Ted would reply modestly. \"It might not be any good here but we had luck with it at home.\"  \"We can try it, at least. You tell Mr. Stevens what the proportions are and how you applied it.\"  And because the advice was followed by a successful extermination of the plague, the lad's prestige increased and he was summoned to future conclaves when troublesome conditions arose.  Now and then there was a morning when Mr. Stevens would remark to Mr. Wharton:  \"I've got to go to the Falls to-day to see about some freight. Ted Turner will be round here, though, and I guess things will be all right. The men can ask him if they want anything.\"  And so it went.  First Ted filled one corner, then another. He did errands for Mr. Wharton, very special errands, that required thought and care, and which the manager would not have entrusted to every one. Sometimes he ventured valuable suggestions which Mr. Stevens, who really had had far less farming experience than he, was only too grateful to follow.  If the boy felt at all puffed up by the dependence placed upon him, he certainly failed to show it. On the contrary he did his part enthusiastically, faithfully, generously, and without a thought of praise or reward. Although he was young to direct others, when he did give orders to the men he was tactful and retiring enough to issue his commands in the form of wishes and immediately they were heeded without protest. He never shirked the hard work he asked others to perform but was always ready to roll up the sleeves of his blue jeans and pitch with vigor into any task, no matter how menial it was. Had he been arrogant and made an overbearing use of his authority, the men would quickly have rated him as a conceited little popinjay, the pet of the boss, and made his life miserable; but as he remained quite unspoiled by the preference shown him and exhibited toward every one he encountered a kindly sympathy and consideration, the workmen soon accepted him as a matter of course and even began to turn to him whenever a dilemma confronted them.  Perhaps Ted was too genuinely interested in what he was doing to think much about himself or realize that the place he held was an unusual one. At home he and his father had threshed out many a problem together and each given to it the best his brain had to offer, without thought of the difference in their ages. Sometimes Ted's way proved the better,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2330"],["title","Religions of Ancient China (#1)"],["body","speaking, of the Chou dynasty, it may be as well to state here that there are two terms in ancient Chinese literature which seem to be used indiscriminately for God. One is _T'ien_, which has come to include the material heavens, the sky; and the other is _Shang Ti_, which has come to include the spirits of deceased Emperors. These two terms appear simultaneously, so to speak, in the earliest documents which have come down to us, dating back to something like the twentieth century before Christ. Priority, however, belongs beyond all doubt to _T'ien_, which it would have been more natural to find meaning, first the visible heavens, and secondly the Deity, whose existence beyond the sky would be inferred from such phenomena as lightning, thunder, wind, and rain. But the process appears to have been the other way, so far at any rate as the written language is concerned. The Chinese script, when it first came into existence, was purely pictorial, and confined to visible objects which were comparatively easy to depict. There does not seem to have been any attempt to draw a picture of the sky. On the other hand, the character _T'ien_ was just such a representation of a human being as would be expected from the hand of a prehistoric artist; and under this unmistakable shape the character appears on bells and tripods, as seen in collections of inscriptions, so late as the sixth and seventh centuries B.C., after which the head is flattered to a line, and the arms are raised until they form another line parallel to that of the head.  Distinction between T'ien and Shang Ti.--The term _Shang Ti_ means literally Supreme Ruler. It is not quite so vague as _T'ien_, which seems to be more of an abstraction, while _Shang Ti_ is a genuinely personal God. Reference to _T'ien_ is usually associated with fate or destiny, calamities, blessings, prayers for help, etc. The commandments of _T'ien_ are hard to obey; He is compassionate, to be feared, unjust, and cruel. _Shang Ti_ lives in heaven, walks, leaves tracks on the ground, enjoys the sweet savour of sacrifice, approves or disapproves of conduct, deals with rewards and punishments in a more particular way, and comes more actually into touch with the human race.  Thus _Shang Ti_ would be the God who walked in the garden in the cool of the day, the God who smelled the sweet savour of Noah's sacrifice, and the God who allowed Moses to see His back. _T'ien_ would be the God of Gods of the Psalms, whose mercy endureth for ever; the everlasting God of Isaiah, who fainteth not, neither is weary.  Roman Catholic Dissensions.--These two, in fact, were the very terms favoured by the early Jesuit missionaries to China, though not with the limitations above suggested, as fit the proper renderings for God; and of the two terms the great Manchu Emperor K'ang Hsi chose _T'ien_. It has been thought that the conversion of China to Christianity under the guiding influence of the Jesuits would soon have become an accomplished fact, but for the ignorant opposition to the use of these terms by the Franciscans and Dominicans, who referred this question, among others, to the Pope. In 1704 Clement XI published a bull declaring that the Chinese equivalent for God was _T'ien Chu_=Lord of Heaven; and such it has continued to be ever since, so far as the Roman Catholic church is concerned, in spite of the fact that _T'ien Chu_ was a name given at the close of the third century B.C. to one of the Eight Spirits.  The two Terms are One.--That the two terms refer in Chinese thought to one and the same Being, though possibly with differing attributes, even down to modern times, may be seen from the account of a dream by the Emperor Yung Lo, A.D. 1403-1425, in which His Majesty relates that an angel appeared to him, with a message from _Shang Ti_; upon which the Emperor remarked, \"Is not this a command from _T'ien_?\" A comparison might perhaps be instituted with the use of \"God\" and \"Jehovah\" in the Bible. At the same time it must be noted that this view was not suggested by the Emperor K'ang Hsi, who fixed upon _T'ien_ as the appropriate term. It is probable that, vigorous Confucianist as he was, he was anxious to appear on the side rather of an abstract than of a personal Deity, and that he was repelled by the overwrought anthropomorphism of the Christian God. His conversion was said to have been very near at times; we read, however, that, when hard pressed by the missionaries to accept baptism, \"he always excused himself by saying that he worshipped the same God as the Christians.\"  God in the \"Odes.\"--The Chou dynasty lasted from B.C. 1122 to B.C. 255. It was China's feudal age, when the empire, then included between latitude 34-40 and longitude 109-118, was split up into a number of vassal States, which owned allegiance to a suzerain State. And it is to the earlier centuries of the Chou dynasty that must be attributed the composition of a large number of ballads of various kinds, ultimately collected and edited by Confucius, and now known as the _Odes_. From these _Odes_ it is abundantly clear that the Chinese people continued to hold, more clearly and more firmly than ever, a deep-seated belief in the existence of an anthropomorphic and personal God, whose one care was the welfare of the human race:--       There is Almighty God;      Does He hate any one?  He reigns in glory.--The soul of King Wen, father of the King Wu below, and posthumously raised by his son to royal rank, is represented as enjoying happiness in a state beyond the grave:--       King Wen is on high,      In glory in heaven.      His comings and his goings      Are to and from the presence of God.  He is a Spirit.--Sometimes in the _Odes_ there is a hint that God, in spite of His anthropomorphic semblance, is a spirit:--       The doings of God      Have neither sound nor smell.  Spiritual Beings.--Spirits were certainly supposed to move freely among mortals:--       Do not say, This place is not public;      No one can see me here.      The approaches of spiritual Beings      Cannot be calculated beforehand;      But on no account should they be ignored.  The God of Battle.--In the hour of battle the God of ancient China was as much a participator in the fight as the God of Israel in the Old Testament:--       God is on your side!  was the cry which stimulated King Wu to break down the opposing ranks of Shang. To King Wu's father, and others, direct communications had previously been made from heaven, with a view to the regeneration of the empire:--       The dynasties of Hsia and Shang      Had not satisfied God with their government;      So throughout the various States      He sought and considered      For a State on which He might confer the rule.       God said to King Wen,      I am pleased with your conspicuous virtue,      Without noise and without display,      Without heat and without change,      Without consciousness of effort,      Following the pattern of God.       God said to King Wen,      Take measures against hostile States,      Along with your brethren,      Get ready your grappling-irons,      And your engines of assault,      To attack the walls of Ts'ung.  God sends Famine.--The _Ode_ from which the following extract is taken carries us back to the ninth century B.C., at the time of a prolonged and disastrous drought:--       Glorious was the Milky Way,      Revolving brightly in the sky,      When the king said, Alas!      What crime have my people committed now,      That God sends down death and disorder,      And famine comes upon us again?      There is no spirit to whom I have not sacrificed;      There is no victim that I have grudged;      Our sacrificial symbols are all used up;--      How is it that I am not heard?  The Confucian Criterion.--The keystone of the Confucian philosophy, that man is born good, will be found in the following lines:--       How mighty is God!      How clothed in majesty is God,      And how unsearchable are His judgments!      God gives birth to the people,      But their natures are not constant;      All have the same beginning,      But few have the same end.  God, however, is not held responsible for the sufferings of mankind. King Wen, in an address to the last tyrant of the House of Shang, says plainly,       It is not God who has caused this evil time,      But it is you who have strayed from the old paths.  The Associate of God.--Worshipped on certain occasions as the Associate of God, and often summoned to aid in hours of distress or danger, was a personage known as Hou Chi, said to have been the original ancestor of the House of Chou. His story, sufficiently told in the _Odes_, is curious for several reasons, and especially for an instance in Chinese literature, which, in the absence of any known husband, comes near suggesting the much-vexed question of parthenogenesis:--       She who first gave birth to our people      Was the lady Chiang Yuan.      How did she give birth to them?      She offered up a sacrifice      That she might not be childless;      Then she trod in a footprint of God's, and conceived,      The great and blessed one,      Pregnant with a new birth to be,      And brought forth and nourished      Him who was Hou Chi.       When she had fulfilled her months,      Her firstborn came forth like a lamb.      There was no bursting, no rending,      No injury, no hurt,      In order to emphasise his divinity.      Did not God give her comfort?      Had He not accepted her sacrifice,      So that thus easily she brought forth her son?       He was exposed in a narrow lane,      But sheep and oxen protected and suckled him;      He was exposed in a wide forest,      But woodcutters found him;      He was exposed on cold ice,      But birds covered him with their wings.  Apotheosis of Hou Chi.--And so he grew to man's estate, and taught the people husbandry, with a success that has never been rivalled. Consequently, he was deified, and during"]]]
