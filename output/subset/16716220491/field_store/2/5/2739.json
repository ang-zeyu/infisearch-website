For preparing and mounting all small and medium size specimens I would advise the following list of tools. They will enable the worker to care for any of our native birds, quadrupeds up to the coyote, and any of our game heads, fur rugs, etc.      1 small skinning knife     1 medium skinning knife     1 larger skinning knife     1 pair scissors, fine points     1 pair shears, heavy, short     2 pairs flat nose pliers, large and small.     1 pair side or end cutters  [Illustration: HOME MADE TOOLS.  (1) Skin Scraper (made from screw driver) (2) (3) (4) Modeling Tools (wood and brass) (5) Setting Needle. (6) (7) Stuffers (heavy wire.)]      1 pair fine forceps, 5 or 6 inch     2 flat files, large and small     1 adjustable tool handle, assorted tools, awls.     2 pinking irons, 3/4 and 1-1/2 inch     Needles, assortment of cloth and glovers     Oilstone  If it is capable of taking and holding a good edge the small blade of a pocket knife is equal to a surgeon's scalpel and a sharp shoe or paring knife, ground to the proper shape, is a nice medium size for skinning or trimming skins. A hunting or butcher knife is sufficient for the largest size. A few carpenter's tools are necessary and a complete set does not come amiss if much large work is attempted.  We must have:      Handsaw     Hatchet     Hammer     Bit brace     Assortment, drills and bits, 1/2 in. and less.     Drawshave     Screwdriver     Small grindstone or corundum wheel     Chisels, two or three sizes     1 wood rasp     1 cabinet rasp     1 chopping block, made of a section of       hardwood log  If large animals are to be mounted we will need in addition some iron working tools, such as      Set of taps and dies 1/4 to 1 in.     Monkey wrench     Hack saw     Tanner's knives, 1 or more  A combination vise and anvil will be needed in any case as well as some miscellaneous tools:      Fur comb, coarse and fine combined     Paint, wax, and varnish brushes     Foot rule     Tape measure     Putty knife     Pointing trowel     Skin scraper  and some stuffing and modelling tools which you can make yourself. The list of materials seems like a long one, but many are inexpensive and others are used only in some small amounts, so the aggregate cost is small.      Excelsior     Fine tow     Cotton bat or wadding     Plaster paris     Corn meal     Gasoline     Potter's or modelling clay     Set tube oil colors     Glass eyes, assorted     Soft wire, assorted     Pins     Cord     Spool cotton, coarse and fine, black and white     Wax, varnish, glue, paste     Papier mache, or paper for same     An assortment of nails, tacks, brads, screws,       screw eyes and staples  [Illustration: TAXIDERMISTS TOOLS.

The permanent mounts are treated of elsewhere.  In ordering glass eyes it is often best to get them in the clear glass iris with black pupil so they may be given any color desired by painting the backs with tube colors, afterward protecting the paint with varnish. In this way a small stock will answer for many varieties. The plain black eye which is the least expensive can be used for many of the smaller birds and mammals, but should never be when the iris of the eye has any distinct tint. Do not make the mistake of ordering an assortment of \"off\" sizes and colors, that is those which are seldom called for. Aim to have those on hand for which you will have the most frequent use, the exceptions can be quickly had by parcel post. There is more demand for eyes of some shade of yellow or brown than any other colors, probably.  All birds have the round pupil. Elongated pupils are suitable for horned game and the cat tribe, irregular pupils fish, and the veined iris for dogs, wolves and foxes. Suitable sizes for some species of birds are as follows:    Number  3 to  5   Sparrows generally.   Number  5 to  7   Robin, blue jay, flicker.   Number  7 to  9   The smaller hawks and herons,                     nearly all the ducks.   Number 10 to 12   The smaller owls, the wild goose.   Number 12 to 14   The larger hawks and herons.   Number 15         Screech owl, eagles.   Number 17         Barred owl.   Number 19 or 20   Snowy owl and great horned owl.  [Illustration: GLASS EYES FOR ANIMALS, BIRDS, FISH.]  Size of eyes for quadrupeds:    Number  7 or  8   Mink, skunk, red squirrel.   Number 10 to 12   Gray and fox squirrel, wood                     chuck, raccoon and opossum.   Number 12 to 14   Rabbit, small dogs, house cat.   Number 15 to 17   Jack rabbit, fox, medium size                     dogs, wild cat, black bear.   Number 18         Large dog, wolf, lynx, and grizzly bear.   Number 20 to 22   Puma, jaguar, small deer.   Number 23 to 24   Large deer, tiger.   Number 25 to 27   Moose, elk, caribou, horse, cow, lion.  [Illustration: SIZES OF GLASS EYES.]  [Illustration: SIZES OF GLASS EYES (Style 1)]  Of wire the following sizes are suitable for birds:    Number  6         Pelican.   Number  7         Wild turkey, swan.   Number  8         Eagles.   Number  9         Loon, goose, large herons.   Number 10         Seagull, large ducks, hawks,                     owls, and fish hawk.   Number 11 or 12   Medium size ducks, herons, and similar.   Number 13 or 14   Small ducks and grouse.   Number 15         Small herons, and medium owls.   Number 16         Doves, small owls.   Number 17 or 18   Bob white, jay, robin, snipe.   Number 19         Blackbird, waxwing, oriole.   Number 20         Bluebird, cardinal.   Number 21 to 24   Warblers, wrens, titmouse, finches.   Number 26         North American humming bird.  For quadrupeds:    Number  7         Wild cat.   Number  8         Foxes.   Number 10         Raccoon, wood chuck.   Number 11         Skunk, opossum.   Number 12 or 13   Muskrat, rabbit.   Number 14 or 15   Mink, large squirrels.   Number 17 or 18   Weasel, bull frog, and small squirrels.  These sizes are approximate, varying with size of the individual specimen and the required attitude wanted. For instance, a bird mounted with wings spread would be better for a large size wire than if in a resting position. An animal crouched does not require as heavy supports as one upright or in action. It is best to give the specimen the benefit of the doubt, as nothing is more disastrous than to have an otherwise well mounted subject sag down and spoil the entire effect from lack of sufficient mechanical support. The best wire for this purpose is annealed, galvanized iron. Larger animals require Norway iron rod in the following sizes:      1/4 in.   Coyote, setter dog.    5/16 in.   Wolf, puma.     3/8 in.   Medium deer.     1/2 in.   Caribou and large deer.     3/4 in.   Moose, elk.  A large earthen jar or two will hold sufficient skin pickle for small animals. For large animals or great numbers of small ones a tank or barrel. Keep such jars or barrels covered to prevent evaporation. With dry arsenic and alum, arsenical solution, formaldehyde for an emergency and plenty of salt, even a beginner should be able to save almost anything that falls into his clutches.  There are numbers of reliable dealers in tools and supplies for the taxidermist and a perusal of their catalogs will be helpful, among the number being James P. Babbitt, 192 Hodges Ave., Taunton, Mass. Ready to use head forms, pinked rug and robe trimming, artificial tongues and ear forms, and even paper head and neck forms for the mounting of large game heads are some of the time and labor saving supplies they list. If you cannot attain to these, emergency supplies can be had of the dealer in hardware and dry goods, and one who cares for the art will rise superior to the material at his hand. What you \"stuff 'em with\" is of small consequence provided you use brains in the job. I have seen an elk head stuffed with old clothes with the bottoms of pop bottles for eyes, but would advise some other filling if possible.     CHAPTER III.  PRESERVATIVE PREPARATIONS, FORMULAS, ETC.   Probably arsenic in some form has been, and will continue to be the leading taxidermic preservative, or rather, insect deterrent. Many people are shy of handling this, but with reasonable care the use of arsenic is perfectly safe. Always keep poisons well labeled and out of the way of children. Nine children out of ten would never think of sampling them, but the tenth might prove the fatal exception.  There is far less danger to the operator in handling the needful amount of poisons than in endeavoring to save some rare but over-ripe subject. In many years' use of arsenic, dry, in wet solution, and in soap, I have received nothing more serious than an occasional sore finger.  The shape in which I have found it most satisfactory for poisoning hair and feathers of mounted specimens and the interior of furred skins I will give as  ARSENICAL SOLUTION.      Commercial arsenic       1 lb.     Bicarbonate of soda    1/2 lb.     Water                    5 pts.  Boil until arsenic and soda have dissolved, stirring frequently. Use a vessel at least twice as large as necessary to contain the quantity used as it foams up while boiling. When cold put in a large bottle or jar marked _Poison_, of course. For poisoning finished specimens, mounted heads, etc., take one part of this solution to two parts water and spray the entire surface with this in an atomizer or larger sprayer. It should be tested before using by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23262"],["title","Chasing the Sun (#1)"],["body","water, and leaden-coloured sky were all that met the eyes of the men who stood on the deck of a little schooner that rose and sank and staggered helplessly before the tempest.  Truly, it was a grand sight--a terrible sight--to behold that little craft battling with the storm.  It suggested the idea of God's might and forbearance,--of man's daring and helplessness.  The schooner was named the _Snowflake_.  It seemed, indeed, little heavier than a flake of snow, or a scrap of foam, in the grasp of that angry sea.  On her deck stood five men.  Four were holding on to the weather-shrouds; the fifth stood at the helm.  There was only a narrow rag of the top-sail and the jib shown to the wind, and even this small amount of canvas caused the schooner to lie over so much that it seemed a wonder she did not upset.  Fred Temple was one of the men who held on to the weather-rigging; two of the others were his friends Grant and Sam Sorrel.  The fourth was one of the crew, and the man at the helm was the Captain; for, although Fred understood a good deal of seamanship, he did not choose to take on his own shoulders the responsibility of navigating the yacht.  He employed for that purpose a regular seaman whom he styled Captain, and never interfered with him, except to tell him where he wished to go.  Captain McNab was a big, tough, raw-boned man of the Orkney Islands.  He was born at sea, had lived all his life at sea, and meant (so he said) to die at sea.  He was a grim, hard-featured old fellow, with a face that had been so long battered by storms that it looked more like the figure-head of a South-Sea whaler than the countenance of a living man. He seldom smiled, and when he did he smiled grimly; never laughed, and never spoke when he could avoid it.  He was wonderfully slow both in speech and in action, but he was a first-rate and fearless seaman, in whom the owner of the schooner had perfect confidence.  As we have fallen into a descriptive vein it may be as well to describe the rest of our friends offhand.  Norman Grant was a sturdy Highlander, about the same size as his friend Temple, but a great contrast to him; for while Temple was fair and ruddy, Grant was dark, with hair, beard, whiskers, and moustache bushy and black as night.  Grant was a Highlander in heart as well as in name, for he wore a Glengarry bonnet and a kilt, and did not seem at all ashamed of exposing to view his brown hairy knees.  He was a hearty fellow, with a rich deep-toned voice, and a pair of eyes so black and glittering that they seemed to pierce right through you and come out at your back when he looked at you!  Temple, on the contrary, was clad in grey tweed from head to foot, wideawake included, and looked, as he was, a thorough Englishman.  Grant was a doctor by profession; by taste a naturalist.  He loved to shoot and stuff birds of every shape and size and hue, and to collect and squeeze flat plants of every form and name.  His rooms at home were filled with strange specimens of birds, beasts, fishes, and plants from every part of Scotland, England, and Ireland--to the disgust of his old nurse, whose duty it was to dust them, and to the delight of his little brother, whose self-imposed duty it was to pull out their tails and pick out their eyes!  Grant's trip to Norway promised a rich harvest in a new field, so he went there with romantic anticipations.  Sam Sorrel was like neither of his companions.  He was a little fellow-- a mere spider of a man, and extremely thin; so thin that it seemed as if his skin had been drawn over the bones in a hurry and the flesh forgotten!  The Captain once said to Bob Bowie in a moment of confidence that Mr Sorrel was a \"mere spunk,\" whereupon Bob nodded his head, and added that he was no better than \"half a fathom of pump water.\"  If there was little of Sam, however, that little was good stuff.  It has been said that he was a painter by profession.  Certainly there was not a more enthusiastic artist in the kingdom.  Sam was a strange mixture of earnestness, enthusiasm, and fun.  Although as thin as a walking-stick, and almost as flat as a pancake, he was tough like wire, could walk any distance, could leap farther than anybody, and could swim like a cork. His features were sharp, prominent and exceedingly handsome.  His eyes were large, dark, and expressive, and were surmounted by delicate eyebrows which moved about continually with every changeful feeling that filled his breast.  When excited his glance was magnificent, and the natural wildness of his whole aspect was increased by the luxuriance of his brown hair, which hung in long elf-locks over his shoulders.  Among his intimates he was known by the name of \"Mad Sam Sorrel.\"  When we have said that the crew of the schooner consisted of six picked men besides those described and our friend Bob Bowie, we have enumerated all the human beings who stood within the bulwarks of that trim little yacht on that stormy summer's day.  There was, however, one other being on board that deserves notice.  It was Sam Sorrel's dog.  Like its master, this dog was a curious creature.  It was little and thin, and without form of any distinct or positive kind.  If we could suppose that this dog had been permitted to make itself, and that it had begun with the Skye-terrier, suddenly changed its mind and attempted to come the poodle, then midway in this effort had got itself very much dishevelled, and become so entangled that it was too late to do anything better than finish off with a wild attempt at a long-eared spaniel, one could understand how such a creature as \"Titian\" had come into existence.  Sam had meant to pay a tribute of respect to the great painter when he named his dog Titian.  But having done his duty in this matter, he found it convenient to shorten the name into Tit--sometimes Tittles.  Tittles had no face whatever, as far as could be seen by the naked eye.  His whole misshapen body was covered with long shaggy hair of a light grey colour.  Only the end of his black nose was visible in front and the extreme point of his tail in rear.  But for these two landmarks it would have been utterly impossible to tell which end of the dog was which.  Somehow the end of his tail had been singed or skinned or burned, for it was quite naked, and not much thicker than a pipe-stem.  Tittles was extremely sensitive in regard to this, and could not bear to have his miserable projection touched.  How that storm did rage, to be sure!  The whole sea was lashed into a boiling sheet of foam, and the schooner lay over so much that it was impossible for the men to stand on the deck.  At times it seemed as if she were thrown on her beam-ends; but the good yacht was buoyant as a cork, and she rose again from every fresh blast like an unconquerable warrior.  \"It seems to me that the masts will be torn out of her,\" said Temple to the Captain, as he grasped the brass rail that surrounded the quarterdeck, and gazed upward with some anxiety.  \"No fear o' her,\" said the Captain, turning the quid of tobacco in his cheek; \"she's a tight boat, an' could stand a heavier sea than this.  I hope it'll blow a wee thing harder.\"  \"Harder!\" exclaimed Fred.  \"You must be fond of wind, Captain,\" observed Grant with a laugh.  \"Oo ay, I've no objection to wund.\"  The Captain said this, as he said everything else, more than half through his nose, and very slowly.  \"But do you not think that more wind would be apt to carry away our top-masts, or split the sails?\" said Temple.  \"It's not unlikely,\" was the Captain's cool reply.  \"Then why wish for it?\" inquired the other in surprise.  \"Because we're only thirty miles from the coast of Norway, and if the wund holds on as it's doin', we'll not make the land till dark.  But if it blows harder we'll get under the shelter of the Islands in daylight.\"  \"Dark!\" exclaimed poor Sam Sorrel, who, being a bad sailor, was very sick, and clung to the lee bulwarks with a look of helpless misery; \"I thought there was no dark in Nor--.\"  The unhappy painter stopped abruptly in consequence of a sensation in the pit of his stomach.  \"There's not much darkness in Norway in summer,\" answered McNab, \"but at the south end of it here there's a little--specially when the weather is thick.  Ay, I see it's comin'.\"  The peculiar way in which the Captain said this caused the others to turn their eyes to windward, where it was very evident that something was coming, for the sky was black as ink, and the sea under it was ruffled with cold white foam.  \"Stand by the clew-lines and halyards,\" roared the Captain.  The men, who were now all assembled on deck, sprang to obey.  As they did so a squall came hissing down on the weather-quarter, and burst upon the vessel with such fury that for a moment she reeled under the shock like a drunken man, while the spray deluged her decks, and the wind shrieked through the rigging.  But this was too violent to last.  It soon passed over and the gale blew more steadily, driving the _Snowflake_ over the North Sea like a seamew.  That evening the mountains of Norway rose to view.  About the time that this occurred the sky began to clear towards the north-west and soon after a white line of foam was seen on the horizon right ahead.  This was the ocean beating on the great army of islands, or skerries, that line the west coast of Norway from north to south.  \"Hurrah for old Norway!\" shouted Fred Temple with delight, when he first observed the foam that leaped upon these bare rocky islets.  \"It seems to me that we shall be wrecked,\" said Grant gravely.  \"I do not see an opening in these tremendous breakers, and if we can't get through them, even a landsman could tell that we shall be dashed to pieces.\"  \"Why not put about the ship and sail away from them?\" suggested Sorrel, looking round with a face so yellow and miserable that even the Captain was _almost_ forced to smile.  \"Because that is simply impossible,\" said Fred Temple.  Poor Sam groaned "]]]
