She is supposed to have died in a secluded villa in Hackney.  It is said that not only the wife of George the Third but the wife of George the Fourth believed that the marriage had taken place.  We must not attach too much importance to a story which in itself is so very unlikely.  It is in the last degree improbable that a statesman like Pitt would have lent himself to so singular a proceeding.  Even if an enamoured young Prince were prepared to sanction his affections by a marriage, he would scarcely have found an assistant in the ablest politician of the age. The story of the Axford marriage is far more probable.  If Hannah Lightfoot had been married to George she would have been Queen of England, for there was no Royal Marriage Act in those days.  Another and more famous romance is associated with the youth of George the Third.  Lady Sarah Lennox, the youngest daughter of the second Duke of Richmond, was one of the most beautiful women of her time.  The writers of the day rave about her, describe her as \"an angel,\" as lovelier than any Magdalen by Correggio.  When she was only seventeen years old her beauty attracted the young King, who soon made no secret of his devotion to her.  The new passion divided the Court into two camps.  The House of Lennox was eager to bring about a marriage, which was not then obstructed by the law.  Henry Fox, one of the most ambitious men of that time or of any time, was Lady Sarah's brother-in-law, and he did his best to promote the marriage.  On the other hand, the {10} party which followed the lead of the Princess Dowager and Lord Bute fought uncompromisingly against the scheme.  The Princess Dowager had everything to lose, Lord Bute had everything to lose, by such an alliance.  The power of the Princess Dowager over the young King would vanish, and the influence of Lord Bute over the Princess Dowager would cease to have any political importance.  Lord Bute did all he could to keep the lovers apart.  Henry Fox did all he could to bring the lovers together.  For lovers they undoubtedly were. George again and again made it plain to those who were in his confidence that he was in love with Lady Sarah, and was anxious to make her his queen; and Lady Sarah, though her heart is said to have been given to Lord Newbottle, was quite ready to yield to the wishes of her family when those wishes were for the crown of England.  On the meadows of Holland House the beautiful girl, loveliest of Arcadian rustics, would play at making hay till her royal lover came riding by to greet her.  But the idyll did not end in the marriage for which Fox and the Lennoxes hoped.  It is said that the King was jealous of Lord Newbottle; it is said that a sense of duty to his place and to his people made him resolve to subdue and sacrifice his own personal feelings.  He offered his hand and his crown to the Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.  Lady Sarah lost both her lovers, the King and Lord Newbottle, who, in the words of Grenville, \"complained as much of her as she did of the King.\"  But she did not remain long unmarried. In 1762 she accepted as husband the famous sporting Baronet Sir Thomas Charles Bunbury, and nineteen years later she married the Hon. George Napier, and became the mother of an illustrious pair of soldier brothers, Sir Charles Napier, the hero of Scinde, and Sir William Napier, perhaps the best military historian since Julius Caesar.  Lady Sarah died in 1826, in her eighty-second year.  In her later years she had become totally blind, and she bore her affliction with a sweet patience.  At her death she is described by the chroniclers of the time as \"probably the last surviving {11} great-grand-daughter of King Charles the Second.\"  A barren honor, surely.  [Sidenote: 1760--Princess Charlotte Sophia]  The young Princess whom George married was in many ways well and even excellently qualified to make a good queen.  It is said that she was discovered for her young husband after a fashion something resembling a tale from the \"Arabian Nights.\"  The Princess Dowager, eager to counteract the fatal effect of the beauty of Lady Sarah Lennox, was anxious to have the young King married as soon as possible.  Her own wishes were in favor of a daughter of the House of Saxe-Gotha, but it is said that fear of a disease hereditary in the family overruled her wishes.  Then, according to the story, a Colonel Graeme, a Scotch gentleman upon whose taste Lord Bute placed great reliance, was sent on a kind of roving embassy to the various little German Courts in search of the ideal bride.  The lady of the quest was, according to the instructions given to Colonel Graeme, to be at once beautiful, healthy, accomplished, of mild disposition, and versed in music, an art to which the King was much devoted.  Colonel Graeme, with this pleasing picture of feminine graces ever in his mind, found the original of the portrait in Charlotte Sophia, the second daughter of Charles Lewis Frederick, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.  There is another version of the manner of George's wooing which nullifies the story of Colonel Graeme's romantic mission.  According to this other version George fell in love with his future queen simply from reading a letter written by her.  The tale sounds as romantic as that of the Provencal poet's passion for the portrait of the Lady of Tripoli.  It is true, however, that the letter of Charlotte Sophia was something of the nature of a state paper.  The Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, of which the Princess Charlotte's brother was the sovereign, had been overrun by the troops of the King of Prussia.  The young Princess wrote a letter to the Prussian King, which came to George's notice and inspired him, it is said, with the liveliest admiration for the lady who penned it.  Whatever the actual reason, whether the report of Colonel Graeme or the {12} charms of her epistolary style, the certain thing is that George was married, first by proxy and afterwards in due form, to the young Princess in 1761. The young Princess was not remarkably beautiful.  Even the courtiers of the day, anxious to say their strongest in her praise, could not do much more than commend her eyes and complexion and call her \"a very fine girl,\" while those who were not inclined to flatter said her face was all mouth, and declared, probably untruly, that the young King was at first obviously repelled by the plainness of his wife's appearance. If she was plain, her plainness, as Northcote, the painter, said, was an elegant, not a vulgar plainness, and the grace of her carriage much impressed him.  Walpole found her sensible, cheerful, and remarkably genteel, a not inconsiderable eulogy from him.  She was fairly educated, as the education of princesses went in those days.  She knew French and Italian, knew even a little English.  She had various elegant accomplishments--could draw, and dance, and play, had acquired a certain measure of scientific knowledge, and she had what was better than all these attainments, a good, kindly, sensible nature.  The marriage could hardly be called a popular marriage at first.  Statesmen and politicians thought that the King of England ought to have found some more illustrious consort than the daughter of a poor and petty German House.  The people at large, we are told from a private letter of the time, were \"quite exasperated at her not being handsome,\" beauty in a sovereign being a great attraction to the mass of subjects.  The courtiers in general were amused by, and secretly laughed at, her simple ways and old-fashioned--or at least un-English--manners.  [Sidenote--1761--The Coronation of George the Third]  After the wedding came the coronation, a very resplendent ceremony, which was not free from certain somewhat ludicrous features, and was not denied a certain tragic dignity.  It was enormously expensive. Horace Walpole called it a puppet-show that cost a million.  Loyal London turned out in its thousands.  Surprisingly large sums of money were paid for rooms and scaffolds from which the outdoor sight could be seen, and much larger were paid {13} for places inside the Abbey.  It was very gorgeous, very long, and very fatiguing.  The spectator carried away, with aching senses, a confused memory of many soldiers, of great peers ill at ease in unbecoming habits, of beautiful women beautifully attired, of a blaze of jewels that recalled the story of Aladdin's mine, and of the wonderful effect by which the darkness of Westminster Hall was suddenly illuminated by an ingenious arrangement of sconces that caught fire and carried on the message of light with great rapidity.  The heralds in whose hands the ceremonial arrangements lay bungled their business badly, causing fierce heartburnings by confusions in precedence, and displaying a lamentable ignorance of the names and the whereabouts of many wearers of stately and ancient titles.  When the King expressed his annoyance at some of the blunders, Lord Effingham, the Earl Marshal, offered, for amazing apology, the assurance that the next coronation would be conducted with perfect order, an unfortunate speech, which had, however, the effect of affording the King infinite entertainment.  The one tragic touch in the whole day's work may be legend, but it is legend that might be and that should be truth.  When Dymoke, the King's Champion, rode, in accordance with the antique usage, along Westminster Hall, and flung his glove down in challenge to any one who dared contest his master's right to the throne of England, it is said that some one darted out from the crowd, picked up the glove, slipped back into the press, and disappeared, without being stopped or discovered.  According to one version of the incident, it was a woman who did the deed; according to another it was Charles Edward himself, the Young Pretender--now no longer so very young--who made this last protest on behalf of his lost fortunes and his fallen House.  It is possible, it is even"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23472"],["title","A History of the Four Georges and of William IV, Volume IV (#1)"],["body","adviser at home, and was doing his best to bring about some sort of compromise which might result in the Queen's accepting a quiet and informal separation on fair and reasonable terms.  George, however, was not inclined to listen to conditions of compromise.  He wanted to get rid of his Queen once for all, to be publicly and completely divorced from her, to be free from even a nominal association with her; and he was not inclined to accept any terms which merely secured him against the chance of her {5} ever again appearing within his sight.  Brougham was disposed, and even determined, to do all he could for the unhappy Caroline, although now and then in one of his characteristic bursts of ill-temper he used to rail against the trouble she gave him by her impatient desire to rush back to England and make her appeal to public opinion there.  There was a great deal of negotiation between the advisers on both sides, and the final offer made on the part of the King was that the Queen should have an allowance of 52,000 pounds a year--not, one would have thought, a very illiberal allowance for the daughter of a small German prince--and that she should be allowed to retain her titles, and should be authorized to use them at foreign courts, but that her name was not to appear in the Liturgy, and that she was not to appear officially in England as the wife of the sovereign.  These terms were offered much against the will of the King himself, who still yearned for the divorce, the whole divorce, and nothing but the divorce.  George yielded, however, to the urgent advice of his ministers, with the strong hope and belief still in his own heart that Caroline would not accept the conditions, and would insist upon presenting herself in England and asserting her position as Queen.  The Queen, meanwhile, had left Rome, where she had been staying for some time and where she complained of the want of deference shown to her by the Papal authorities.  She was hurrying back to England, and had written to Brougham requesting him to meet her at Saint Omer, and there accordingly Brougham met her.  Whether he was very urgent in his advice to her to accept the terms it is not easy to know; but, at all events, it is quite certain that she refused point-blank to make any concessions, that she left Brougham with positive abruptness, and hastened on her way to England.  Among her most confidential advisers was Alderman Wood, the head of a great firm in the City of London, a leading man in the corporation of the City, and a member of the House of Commons.  Many eminent Englishmen--among whom were Wilberforce, Canning, and Denman, afterwards Lord Chief Justice--were {6} were warm supporters of her cause, for the good reason that they sincerely believed her to be innocent of the more serious charges against her and deeply wronged by the conduct of the King.  Even her most resolute enemies had to admit that whether her conduct in thus rushing back to England and forcing herself on public notice were wise or unwise, from the worldly point of view, it certainly seemed at least like the conduct of a woman proudly conscious of her own innocence, and determined to accept no compromise which might put her in the position of a pardoned sinner.  The nearer she came to England the more cordial were the expressions of sympathy she received, and from the moment she landed on English shores her way to London became like a triumphal procession.  [Sidenote: 1820--The King's divorce proceedings]  In the mean time the King and his ministers had come to an agreement which was exactly what the King had struggled for from the first, an agreement that steps should be taken in the ordinary way, according to the legal conditions then existing, for the purpose of obtaining a divorce.  The course to be adopted was to bring in a Divorce Bill, and endeavor to have it passed through both Houses of Parliament.  The proceedings were to open in the House of Lords, and the Queen's leading defenders--for her cause was of course to be defended by counsel as in an ordinary court of law--were Brougham and Denman.  The Queen's arrival in London was a signal for the most tumultuous demonstrations of popular devotion and favor towards her, and popular anger, and even fury, against all who were supposed to be her enemies.  The house in which she took up her abode was constantly surrounded by vast throngs of her sympathizers, and she used to have to make her appearance at the windows at frequent intervals and bow her acknowledgments to the crowds below.  Sometimes the zeal of her admirers found a different way of expressing itself, and the window-panes of many houses were broken because the residents were known to be on the side of the King and not of the Queen.  Conspicuous public men who were known, or were believed, to have taken part against her were mobbed in the streets, and even the Duke {7} of Wellington himself was more than once the object of a hostile demonstration.  So widely spread, so deeply penetrating was the feeling in favor of the Queen that it was said to have found its way even into the ranks of the army, and it was believed that some soldiers of regiments quartered in London itself were to be found carousing to the health of Queen Caroline.  A crowd of Italian witnesses had been brought over to bear evidence against the Queen, and these foreign invaders, nearly all of humble rank, had to be sheltered in buildings specially erected for their protection in the near neighborhood of Westminster Hall, and had to be immured and guarded as if they were malefactors awaiting trial and likely to escape, in order that they might be safe from the outbreaks of popular indignation.  It told heavily for the case of the Queen, in the minds of all reasonable and impartial people, that while the King's foreign witnesses were drawn for the most part from a class of persons who might be supposed easily open to subornation and corruption, a great number of distinguished men and women came from various parts of Europe in which the Queen had resided to give evidence in her favor, and to speak highly of her character and her conduct.  The manner in which the proceedings against the Queen were pressed on by the Ministry had one immediate result to their disadvantage by depriving them of the services of George Canning, then one of the most rising of European statesmen.  Canning was strongly impressed with a belief in the Queen's innocence and he could not consent to become one of her formal public accusers, which he must have done were he to remain a member of the administration.  Canning, therefore, after a time, gave up his place as a member of the Government, and he left the work of the prosecution, as it may be called, to be carried on by men less chivalrous and less scrupulous.  It is not necessary to go at any length into the story of the proceedings before the House of Lords.  These proceedings would have been made memorable, if there were nothing else to make them so, by the speeches which Brougham and {8} Denman delivered in defence of the Queen.  Never perhaps in the course of history have the ears of a monarch's advisers been made to tingle by such sentences of magnificent and scathing denunciation poured out in arraignment of the monarch's personal conduct.  Denman, indeed, incurred the implacable hostility of George because, in the course of his speech, he introduced a famous citation from Roman history which, although intended to tell heavily against the King, was mistakenly believed by some of the King's friends to convey a much darker and deeper imputation on the sovereign than that which was really in Denman's mind.  [Sidenote: 1821--Queen Caroline and the King's coronation]  The case may be briefly said to have broken down.  In the House of Lords, where the friends of the sovereign were most powerful, there was only a majority of nine for the third reading of the Bill of Divorce, and the Bill if persevered in would yet have to encounter the House of Commons.  The Government, therefore, made up their minds to abandon the proceedings, and thereupon the friends of the Queen exulted tumultuously over the victory they had won.  But the struggle was not by any means at an end.  The royal coronation had yet to come, and the King was anxious that the ceremonial should be got through at as early a date as possible.  The Queen announced her determination to present herself on the Day of Coronation and claim her right to be crowned as Queen Consort of George the Fourth.  Then the advisers on both sides went to work anew with the vain hope of bringing about something like a compromise which might save the sovereign, the Court, and the country from scandalous and tumultuous scenes.  Again the Queen was offered the allowance which had been tendered to her before, on the old conditions that she would behave quietly and keep herself out of sight.  Again she insisted that her name must be included in the Royal Liturgy, and again the King announced his resolve to make no such concession.  Then the Queen once more made it known that her resolve was final, and that she would present herself at Westminster Abbey on the Coronation Day. George had been advised {9} that all historical precedents warranted him in maintaining that the King had an absolute right to direct the forms of the ceremonial to be used on such an occasion, and he declared that he would not allow the Queen to take any part in the solemnity or even to be present during its performance.  The Queen wrote letters to the King which she sent to him through his Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool.  George sent back the letters unopened to Lord Liverpool, with the announcement that the King would read no letter addressed to him by the Queen, and would only communicate with her through the ordinary official medium of one of his ministers.  The letters thus written on both sides have long since been published, and the perusal"]]]
