And sith his rule is over-ruled by men,   On birds and beasts he'll king it once again.\"   Devon took its unhappy share in the Wars of the Roses, and Perkin Warbeck besieged Exeter in 1497, but unsuccessfully, like most other exploits of that unlucky adventurer.  Fifty years later the West rose in arms against Henry VIII, in support of the \"old religion,\" and to protest against the dissolution of the monasteries; but the rising was put down, and Henry took and subdued Exeter, and carried through his bold and often ruthless policy.  But it is in the reign of Elizabeth that Devon takes on the special glamour with which it is still associated in most minds.  For it was the sixteenth century which gave to England such men as Richard and John Hawkins, Adrien and Humphrey Gilbert, John Davies--that sailor friend of Adrien Gilbert's who, inspired by him, made the first dark voyage into the Polar regions, and traded with the Esquimaux, as told in Hakluyt's \"Voyages\"--and Sir Richard Grenville, with his \"men of Bideford in Devon,\" with whom he fought the _Revenge_ single-handed against the fifty and three Spanish galleons in that last, greatest fight of all; and Sir Walter Raleigh, a philosopher among courtiers, a poet among princes, statesman, dreamer, adventurer, who planned nobly and executed daringly, and failed more greatly than other men succeed. Millais has drawn him for us, in his boyhood, sitting on the beach at Budleigh Salterton, with the wind blowing his hair round his sensitive, eager face, hugging his knees as he listens to the stories of the sailor with the bright parrot-feathers in his hat, one of the men, perhaps, who sailed with Frobisher or terrible John Hawkins, round the world to the far-off coasts of adventure, the lands of gold and spices. It is to Raleigh, and to his half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, that we owe the first colony of America, \"Virginia,\" called so by Raleigh from the Virgin Queen, in the compliment of his day--to them is due the praise of having seen that \"colonization, trade, and the enlargement of Empire, were all more important for the welfare of England than the acquisition of gold,\" and this in an age which was dazzled by the facilities of wealth lying ready to the greedy hand in that \"New World.\"  And this mind, so daring, so original, so diverse, which could turn a sonnet or design a battleship (for the _Ark Raleigh_, built after his plans, was admittedly the best ship of our fleet that met the Armada), which had experienced the favour and disfavour of princes in the fullest degree, which had known triumph and discouragement beyond the ordinary measure of humanity, turned in the last dark years of imprisonment to a steady contemplation of human activity, and, largely conceiving here, as in all else, planned a \"History of the World.\"  Let his own noble words be his epitaph:  \"O eloquent, just, and mighty Death! whom none could advise, thou hast persuaded; what none have dared, thou hast done; and whom all the world have flattered, thou only hast cast out of the world and despised; thou hast drawn together all the far-stretched greatness, all the pride, cruelty and ambition of man, and covered it all over with these two narrow words, 'Hic jacet.'\"  And then there was Drake--Drake, whose name perhaps overshadows all other names in Devon; Drake, who          \"was playing a rubber of bowls   When the great Armada came;\"  but, being told of the sighting of the fleet, remarked that \"they must wait their turn, good souls,\" and continued his game; Drake, who, the year before the sailing of the Armada, \"singed the King of Spain's beard\" most mightily, going up and down the coasts of Spain and Portugal, plundering and burning the ships in their very harbours; who sailed round the world, with the sun for \"fellow traveller,\" as an epitaph under his portrait in the Guildhall says of him; who, on the first independent expedition which he led to America, received a dangerous wound in his attack on Nombre de Dios, but concealed it from his men, and led them to the public treasury, telling them \"that he had brought them to the mouth of the treasury of the world,\" and then fainted over the great bars of silver and gold, and when they took him up he was losing \"so much blood as filled his very footsteps in the sand;\" Drake, who has become a legend and a myth in Devon, so that the country-people say that he brought water from Dartmoor to Plymouth, by compelling a stream to follow his horse's heels all the way into the town; who, like King Arthur and Barbarossa, is not dead, but will return again to his country if his people in their need strike on his drum and call him.  But beyond and behind all these great names, which ring in our ears like martial music, are the nameless crowd of Devon men who sailed with them, and fought with them, and worked with them, and loved them.  Men from Bideford and Appledore and Barnstaple, from Teignmouth and Budleigh and Dartmouth, from every little harbour along the bold north coast, from every creek and bay of the south, from the sheltered villages among their trees, from the wind-swept, hilly little towns, from the busy quayside or the lonely farm, came the men whose courage and whose will, whose love of profit and greater love of adventure, gave a lustre to England in the \"golden days of Elizabeth.\"  Those days passed, and were followed presently by the unhappy years of the great Civil Wars.  It was perhaps not unfitting that a Grenville--Sir Bevil Grenville--led an army against the Parliamentarian troops in the Battle of Lansdown Hill, though it was an army of Cornishmen he led, and not of Devonshire men, for the Grenvilles were then living at their Cornish home of Stowe.  Sir Bevil was killed in battle, but Anthony Payne, his servant, a great giant of a man, and a true friend to his master, set Sir Bevil's young son upon his father's horse, and bade him lead his father's men to victory, as, had he lived, his father would have done.  Afterwards Anthony Payne brought Sir Bevil's body back to Stowe, and he wrote to Lady Grenville a letter which deserves to be recorded for its true and simple dignity:   \"HONOURED MADAM,--  \"Ill news flieth apace: the heavy tidings hath no doubt already travelled to Stowe that we have lost our blessed master by the enemies' advantage.  You must not, dear lady, grieve too much for your noble spouse.  You know, as we all believe, that his soul was in heaven before his bones were cold.  He fell, as he did often tell us he wished to die, for the good Stewart cause, for his country and his King.  He delivered to me his last commands, and with such tender words for you and for his children as are not to be set down with my poor pen, but must come to your ears upon my best heart's breath. . . .  I am coming down with the mournfullest burden that ever a poor servant did bear, to bring the great heart that is cold to Kilkhampton vault.  Oh, my lady, how shall I ever brook your weeping face? . . .\"   This perhaps, is Cornish history and not Devonshire, except that the name of Grenville is so inseparably linked in our minds with Devon.  During the Royalist wars from 1642-1650 Exeter was twice besieged by the Parliamentarians; Ilfracombe twice changed hands, in 1644 being taken by Doddington for the Royalists, and two years later falling to Fairfax after his capture of Barnstaple; Tiverton also was besieged by the Royalists, though it seems to have held within itself the two irreconcilable factions.  But it was not in Devon that the fiercest battles of that time were fought, nor the greatest and bitterest disunion prevailed.  Of the subsequent history of Devon I shall say little.  The unhappy expedition of the Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis, just on the borders of Dorset and Devon, and he himself was joyfully received in Exeter; but it was in Somerset that the battle of Sedgemoor was lost, and Somerset that suffered chiefly from the Bloody Assizes.  Let us rather turn to the Devon of to-day, realizing with thankfulness that the traditions of Drake and Frobisher, of Grenville and Hawkins, still hold; that the heirs of the men who put out in their frail ships for the New World, now buffet round our wild coasts in minesweeper or trawler, destroyer or old cargo tubs, on a far more grim adventure. Without the hope of gain, without the spur of glory, from every port and harbour, from every creek and bay and inlet of our coasts comes the patient, silent, heroic service of the men of the sea.  And on many a hasty grave, in the shot-riddled mud of Flanders, or on the barren beaches of Gallipoli or the ruined lands of Babylon, might that poem of Sir Henry Newbolt's which he calls \"April on Waggon Hill\" be set up as a fitting epitaph:    \"Lad, and can you rest now,     There beneath your hill?   Your hands are on your breast now,     But is your heart so still?   'Twas the right death to die, lad,     A gift without regret,   But unless truth's a lie, lad,     You dream of Devon yet.    \"Ay, ay, the year's awaking,     The fire's among the ling,   The beechen hedge is breaking,     The curlew's on the wing;   Primroses are out, lad,     On the high banks of Lee,   And the sun stirs the trout, lad,     From Brendon to the sea.    \"I know what's in your heart, lad--     The mare he used to hunt,   And her blue market-cart, lad,     With posies tied in front.   We miss them from the moor road,     They're getting old to roam,   The road they're on's a sure road     And nearer, lad, to home.    \"Your name, the name they cherish?     'Twill fade, lad, 'tis true:   But stone and all may perish     With little loss to you.   While fame's fame you're Devon, lad,     The Glory of the West;   Till the roll's called in heaven, lad,     You "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],["title","Electricity for Boys (#1)"],["body","                             39  23.

The boy is directly interested in the practical use which he can make of this wonderful phenomenon in nature.  It is, in reality, the most successful avenue by which he may obtain the theory, for he learns the abstract more readily from concrete examples.  It is an art in which shop practice is a greater educator than can be possible with books. Boys are not, generally, inclined to speculate or theorize on phenomena apart from the work itself; but once put them into contact with the mechanism itself, let them become a living part of it, and they will commence to reason and think for themselves.  It would be a dry, dull and uninteresting thing to tell a boy that electricity can be generated by riveting together two pieces of dissimilar metals, and applying heat to the juncture. But put into his hands the metals, and set him to perform the actual work of riveting the metals together, then wiring up the ends of the metals, heating them, and, with a galvanometer, watching for results, it will at once make him see something in the experiment which never occurred when the abstract theory was propounded.  He will inquire first what metals should be used to get the best results, and finally, he will speculate as to the reasons for the phenomena. When he learns that all metals are positive-negative or negative-positive to each other, he has grasped a new idea in the realm of knowledge, which he unconsciously traces back still further, only to learn that he has entered a field which relates to the constitution of matter itself. As he follows the subject through its various channels he will learn that there is a common source of all things; a manifestation common to all matter, and that all substances in nature are linked together in a most wonderful way.  An impulse must be given to a boy's training. The time is past for the rule-and-rote method. The rule can be learned better by a manual application than by committing a sentence to memory.  In the preparation of this book, therefore, I have made practice and work the predominating factors. It has been my aim to suggest the best form in which to do the things in a practical way, and from that work, as the boy carries it out, to deduce certain laws and develop the principles which underlie them. Wherever it is deemed possible to do so, it is planned to have the boy make these discoveries for himself, so as to encourage him to"]]]
