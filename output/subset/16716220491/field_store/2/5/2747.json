Just a neat little hit!\" came the entreating cry.  \"Oh, if only they do get it!\" murmured Ruth Stevenson. \"I wish Jack was at the bat.\"  \"It's my cousin Dick!\" cried May Powell, and she was right--Spouter Powell was up.  Spouter was not a particularly strong ball player, but he had one feature which was in his favor--he knew how to keep cool, and that helped greatly in this heart-breaking emergency. He waited calmly until two strikes and two balls had been called, and then he struck a low one, sending it just inside the first-base line. It slipped past the baseman, and as Spouter's feet crossed the bag, Fred Rover slid in safely to the home plate.  \"Hurrah! Hurrah! Colby Hall wins!\"  Then followed a wild cheering and yelling, in the midst of which the crowds on the bleachers and the grandstand broke forth to mingle with the players on the ball field. Of course, the Hixley High students were much crestfallen, yet they tried to take their defeat in good part.  \"Three cheers for Hixley High!\" shouted Gif Garrison, and they were given with a will. Then followed a cheer from the high-school students for those of the military academy, and then the crowd started to disperse.  \"Oh, boys! some celebration to-night, what?\" cried Randy Rover, and in the exuberance of his spirits he turned several handsprings on the grass.  \"You bet we'll celebrate!\" exclaimed his cousin Fred.  \"Say! we ought to shoot off the old cannon for this,\" burst out Andy Rover. He referred to an ancient fieldpiece located on the front lawn of the school.  \"Too dangerous,\" interposed his cousin Jack. \"That old cannon is too rusty, and it would fly into a million pieces.\"  \"Yes, but we might----\"  _Boom!_  It was a loud explosion coming from a considerable distance. The cadets, as well as all the others gathered on the ball field, looked at each other in surprise.  \"What could that have been?\" questioned Fred Rover.  \"Sounds like a big cannon going off,\" answered Walt Baxter.  _Boom! Boom!_  Two more explosions rent the air, both much louder than the first. The very ground seemed to be shaken by the concussion.  \"Say, that sounds like a warship!\"  \"No warships around here,\" was the answer.  \"Maybe it's a German Zeppelin!\"  \"Gee! do you suppose the Germans have come over here to bombard us?\"  _Boom! Boom! Boom!_  Several more explosions came now close upon the others, each explosion heavier than those which had gone before. The ground all around seemed to tremble, and those who were still in the grandstand cried out in alarm.  \"The grandstand is going down! Everybody jump for his life!\"  \"Look! Look!\" was the sudden cry from Jack Rover, and he pointed to a place on the opposite shore of Clearwater Lake. A dense volume of smoke was rolling skyward. Then came another tremendous explosion, and a mass of wreckage could be seen to be lifted skyward.  \"It's the Hasley ammunition factory going up!\" cried Fred Rover. \"What an awful thing to happen!\"  \"That factory is right across the lake from our school!\" cried Martha Rover. \"I wonder if it will damage that place any?\"  \"I shouldn't be surprised,\" answered her cousin Andy. And then he added quickly: \"I hope Mary will be safe.\"  \"Oh, oh! do you think Mary is in danger?\" cried Ruth Stevenson, who had just joined the others. Mary was Fred Rover's sister, who had been left behind at the girls' boarding school because she had been suffering that day with a severe headache, and had said she preferred resting to attending the ball game, even though she loved to be with the others.  \"There goes another building!\" yelled Andy Rover, as another report rent the air. Then those who were looking down the river and across the lake saw some strange objects being hurled through the sky in the direction of Clearwater Hall.  \"If that whole ammunition factory starts to go up, it will certainly mean damage to the boarding school,\" declared Jack. \"I guess the best we can do is to get down there and see if Mary is safe.\"  \"That's just what I say!\" declared Fred. \"I'm going to get down there just as fast as I can.\" And he ran off, to board one of the automobiles headed in that direction.  Now, I know it will not be at all necessary to introduce the Rover boys or their friends to my old readers, but for the benefit of those who have not perused any of my former stories a few words concerning these characters will be necessary. In the first volume, entitled \"The Rover Boys at School,\" I told how three brothers, Dick, Tom, and Sam Rover, were sent off to Putnam Hall Military Academy, where they made a great number of friends, including a youth named Lawrence Colby. From Putnam Hall the lads went to Brill College, and on leaving that institution of learning went into business in New York City with offices on Wall Street. They organized The Rover Company, of which Dick was now president, Tom secretary and general manager, and Sam treasurer.  While at Putnam Hall the three Rovers had become acquainted with three very charming girls, Dora Stanhope and her two cousins, Nellie and Grace Laning, and when Dick went into business he made Dora Stanhope his lifelong partner. A short time later Tom married Nellie Laning and Sam married Grace.  The three brothers purchased a fine plot of ground on Riverside Drive overlooking the noble Hudson River, and there they built three connecting houses, Dick and his family living in the middle house, with Tom on one side and Sam on the other.  About a year after their marriage Dick and his wife became the proud parents of a little son, who was named John after Mr. Laning. This son was followed by a daughter, called Martha after her great-aunt Martha of Valley Brook Farm, where the older Rovers had spent many of their younger days. Little Jack, as he was commonly called, was a manly lad with many of the qualities which had made his father so well liked and so successful.  It was about this time that Tom and Nellie Rover came to the front with a surprise for all of the others. This was in the shape of a pair of very lively twins, one of whom was named Anderson, after his grandfather, and the other, Randolph, after his great-uncle Randolph of Valley Brook Farm. Andy and Randy, as they were always called, were very active lads, in that particular being a second edition of their father.  About the time Tom's twins were born Sam and Grace Rover came along with a beautiful little girl, whom they named Mary after Mrs. Laning. Then, a year later, the girl was followed by a sturdy boy, christened Fred after Sam Rover's old and well-known school chum, Fred Garrison.  Residing so close together, the younger generation of Rover boys, as well as their sisters, were brought up very much like one family. They spent their winters usually in New York City, and during the summer often went out to Valley Brook Farm, where their grandfather, Anderson Rover, still resided with Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha.  At first the boys and girls had been sent to private schools in the Metropolis; but soon the lads, led by Andy and Randy, showed such a propensity for \"cutting loose\" that their parents were compelled to hold a consultation.  \"We'll have to do as Uncle Randolph did with us,\" said Dick Rover. \"We'll have to send them to some strict boarding school--some military academy.\" And to this the others had agreed.  Some time previous their old school chum, Lawrence Colby, who had since become a colonel in the state militia, had opened a military academy, called Colby Hall.  \"We'll send them to that place,\" was the decision of the older Rovers. \"Lawrence Colby is just the fellow to make them behave themselves, and as we are such good friends he will be sure to give them extra attention.\"  So the boys were sent off to this school, as related in detail in the first volume of my second series, entitled \"The Rover Boys at Colby Hall.\" This military school was located about half a mile from the town of Haven Point on Clearwater Lake, a beautiful sheet of water about two miles long and nearly half a mile wide. At the head of the lake was the Rick Rack River, running down from the hills and woods beyond.  The school consisted of a large stone building, facing the river at a point not far from where the stream emptied into the lake. It was a three-storied structure, and contained the classrooms and a mess hall and also the dormitories and private rooms for the scholars. Close by was a smaller brick building, occupied by Colonel Colby and his family and some of the professors.  On the opposite side was an up-to-date gymnasium, while at the water's edge were a number of small buildings used as boathouses and bathing pavilions. Behind the hall were a stable and barn, and also a garage, and further back were a large garden and several farm fields and a great athletic field where the boys played baseball in the spring and football in the fall.  On arriving at Colby Hall the young Rovers had found several of their friends awaiting them, one of these being Dick Powell, the son of Songbird Powell, a former schoolmate of their fathers. Dick was always called Spouter because of his fondness for long speeches. Another was Gifford, the son of Fred Garrison, after whom Fred Rover had been named. There was also Walter Baxter, a son of Dan Baxter, who years before had been an enemy of the older Rovers, but who had now reformed and was doing very well.  Before coming to Colby Hall, Jack Rover had had a quarrel in New York City with a tall, dudish youth, named Napoleon Martell. Nappy Martell, as he was called by his cronies, was a cadet at the military academy, and he and his crony, an overgrown bully named Slugger Brown, did what they could to make trouble for the Rovers. But one of their underhanded transactions was exposed, and they were sent away from the academy for the time being.  As mentioned, Colby Hall was located about half a mile beyond Haven Point. On the opposite side of the town was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23292"],["title","Ted and the Telephone (#1)"],["body","Mr. Clarence Fernald did not like it any better but whether he did or not he at least had the courtesy not to show his feelings.  Thus the years had passed and Mr. Laurie had grown from childhood to boyhood. He could now ride about in a motor-car if lifted into it; but he could still walk very little, although specialists had not given up hope that perhaps in time he might be able to do so. There was a rumor that he was strapped into a steel jacket which he was forced to wear continually, and the mill hands commented on its probable discomfort and wondered how the boy could always keep so even-tempered. For it was unavoidable that the large force of servants from Aldercliffe and Pine Lea should neighbor back and forth with the townsfolk and in this way many a tale of Mr. Laurie's rare disposition reached the village. And even had not these stories been rife, anybody could easily have guessed the patience and sweetness of Mr. Laurie's nature from his smile.  Among the employees of Fernald and Company he was popularly known as the Little Master and between him and them there existed a friendliness which neither his father nor his grandfather had ever been able to call out. The difference was that for Mr. Lawrence Fernald the men did only what they were paid to do; for Mr. Clarence they did fully what they were paid to do; and for Mr. Laurie they would gladly have done what they were paid to do and a great deal more.  \"The poor lad!\" they murmured one to another. \"The poor little chap!\"  Of course it followed that no one envied Mr. Laurie his wealth. How could they? One might perhaps envy Mr. Fernald, senior, or Mr. Clarence; but never Mr. Laurie even though the Fernald fortune and all the houses and gardens, with their miles of acreage, as well as the vast cotton mills would one day be his. Even Ted Turner, poor as he was, and having only the prospect of the factories ahead of him, never thought of wishing to exchange his lot in life for that of Mr. Laurie. He would rather toil for Fernald and Company to his dying day than be this weak, dependent creature who was compelled to be carried about by those stronger than himself.  Nevertheless, in spite of this, there were intervals when Ted did wish he might exchange houses with Mr. Laurie. Not that Ted Turner coveted the big colonial mansion, or its fountains, its pergolas, its wide lawns; but he did love gardens, flowers, trees, and sky, and of these he had very little. He was, to be sure, fortunate in living on the outskirts of the village where he had more green and blue than did most of the mill workers. Still, it was not like Vermont and the unfenced miles of country to which he had been accustomed. A small tenement in Freeman's Falls, even though it had steam heat and running water, was in his opinion a poor substitute for all that had been left behind.  But Ted's father liked the new home better, far better, and so did Ruth and Nancy, his sisters. Many a time the boy heard his father congratulating himself that he was clear of the farm and no longer had to get up in the cold of the early morning to feed and water the stock and do the milking. And Ruth and Nancy echoed these felicitations and rejoiced that now there was neither butter to churn nor hens to care for.  Even Ted was forced to confess that Freeman's Falls had its advantages. Certainly the school was better, and as his father had resolved to keep him in it at least a part of the high-school term, Ted felt himself to be a lucky boy. He liked to study. He did not like all studies, of course. For example, he detested Latin, French, and history; but he revelled in shop-work, mathematics, and the sciences. There was nothing more to his taste than putting things together, especially electrical things; and already he had tried at home several crude experiments with improvised telegraphs, telephones, and wireless contrivances. Doubtless he would have had many more such playthings had not materials cost so much, money been so scarce, and Ruth and Nancy so timid. They did not like mysterious sparks and buzzings in the pantry and about the kitchen and told him so in no uncertain terms.  \"The next thing you know you'll be setting the house afire!\" Ruth had asserted. \"Besides, we've no room for wires and truck around here. You'll have to take your clutter somewhere else.\"  And so Ted had obediently bundled his precious possessions into the room where he slept with his father only to be as promptly ejected from that refuge also.  \"You can't be spreadin' wires an' jars an' things round my room!\" protested Mr. Turner with annoyance.  [Illustration: \"You can't be spreadin' wires an' jars an' things round my room!\" protested Mr. Turner. _Page_ 9.]  It did not seem to occur to him that it was Ted's room as well,--the only room the boy had.  Altogether, his treasures found no welcome anywhere in the tiny apartment, and at length convinced of this, Ted took everything down and stowed it away in a box beneath the bed, henceforth confining his scientific adventures to the school laboratories where they might possibly have remained forever but for Mr. Wharton, the manager of the farms at Aldercliffe and Pine Lea.     CHAPTER II  TED RENEWS OLD TIMES   Mr. Wharton was about the last person on earth one would have connected with boxes of strings and wires hidden away beneath beds. He was a graduate of a Massachusetts agricultural college; a keen-eyed, quick, impatient creature toward whom people in general stood somewhat in awe. He had the reputation of being a top-notch farmer and those who knew him declared with zest that there was nothing he did not know about soils, fertilizers, and crops. There was no nonsense when Mr. Wharton appeared on the scene. The men who worked for him soon found that out. You didn't lean on your hoe, light your pipe, and hazard the guess that there would be rain to-morrow; you just hoed as hard as you could and did not stop to guess anything.  Now it happened that it was haying time both at Aldercliffe and Pine Lea and the rumor got abroad that the crop was an unusually heavy one; that Mr. Wharton was short of help and ready to hire at a good wage extra men from the adjoining village. Mr. Turner brought the tidings home from the mill one June night when he returned from work.  \"Why don't you try for a job up at Aldercliffe, my lad?\" concluded he, after stating the case. \"Ever since you were knee-high to a grasshopper you had a knack for pitching hay. Besides, you'd make a fine bit of money and the work would be no heavier than handling freight down at the mills. You've got to work somewhere through your summer vacation.\"  He made the latter statement as a matter of course for a matter of course it had long since become. Ted always worked when he was not studying. Vacations, holidays, Saturdays, he was always busy earning money for if he had not been, there would have been no chance of his going to school the rest of the time. Sometimes he did errands for one of the dry-goods stores; sometimes, if there were a vacancy, he helped in Fernald and Company's shipping rooms; sometimes he worked at the town market or rode about on the grocer's wagon, delivering orders. By one means or another he had usually contrived, since he was quite a small boy, to pick up odd sums that went toward his clothes and \"keep.\" As he grew older, these sums had increased until now they had become a recognized part of the family income. For it was understood that Ted would turn in toward the household expenses all that he earned. His father had never believed in a boy having money to spend and even if he had every cent which the Turners could scrape together was needed at home. Ted knew well how much sugar and butter cost and therefore without demur he cheerfully placed in the hands of his sister Ruth, who ran the house, every farthing that was given him.  From childhood this sense of responsibility had always been in his background. He had known what it was to go hungry that he might have shoes and go without shoes that he might have underwear. Money had been very scarce on the Vermont farm, and although there was now more of it than there ever had been in the past, nevertheless it was not plentiful. Therefore, as vacation was approaching and he must get a job anyway, he decided to present himself before Mr. Wharton and ask for a chance to help in harvesting the hay crops at Aldercliffe and Pine Lea.  \"You are younger than the men I am hiring,\" Mr. Wharton said, after he had scanned the lad critically. \"How old are you?\"  \"Fourteen.\"  \"I thought as much. What I want is men.\"  \"But I have farmed all my life,\" protested Ted with spirit.  \"Indeed!\" the manager exclaimed not unkindly. \"Where?\"  \"In Vermont.\"  \"You don't say so! I was born in the Green Mountains,\" was the quick retort. \"Where did you live?\"  \"Newfane.\"  Instantly the man's face lighted.  \"I know that place well. And you came from Newfane here? How did you happen to do that?\"  \"My father could not make the farm pay and we needed money.\"  \"Humph! Were you sorry to give up farming?\"  \"Yes, sir. I didn't want to come to Freeman's Falls. But,\" added the boy brightening, \"I like the school here.\"  The manager paused, studying the sharp, eager face, the spare figure, and the fine carriage of the lad before him.  \"Do you like haying?\" asked he presently.  \"Not particularly,\" Ted owned with honesty.  Mr. Wharton laughed.  \"I see you are a human boy,\" he said. \"If you don't like it, why are you so anxious to do it now?\"  \"I've got to earn some money or give up going to school in the fall.\"  \"Oh, so that's it! And what are you working at in school that is so alluring?\" demanded the man with a quizzical glance.  \"Electricity.\"  \"Electricity!\"  \"Wireless, telegraphs, telephones, and things like that,\" put in Ted.  For comment Mr. Wharton tipped back in his chair and once more let his eye wander over the boy's face; then he wheeled abruptly around to his desk, opened"]]]
