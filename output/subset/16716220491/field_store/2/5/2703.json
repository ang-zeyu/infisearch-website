I am talking nonsense. My duty lies here, at least at present. Mrs. Willis has taught me always to put duty first. Now, Nan, let us forget what is not likely to happen. It is nearly time for you to go to bed; you look quite tired; there are black rings under your eyes; but first, just tell me about Mrs. Willis and the dear old school.\"  \"Mrs. Willis is well,\" said Nan, with a yawn, \"and the school is in _statu quo_. I am in the middle school now, and perhaps I shall get a drawing-room to myself before long. I'm not sure though, for I never can be tidy.\"  \"I wish you could be; it's a pity not to curb one's faults.\"  \"Oh, bother faults. I don't want you to lecture me, Hetty.\"  \"No, darling, I don't wish to; but I thought you were so fond of Mrs. Willis. I thought you would do anything to please her.\"  \"Yes, of course. I think I do please her. She gave me two prizes at the break up--one for French and one for music. She kissed me, too, quite half-a-dozen times. Look here, Hetty, I don't want you to ask Annie Forest a lot of questions about me. I can't help having a romping time now and then at school; and there are two new girls--Polly and Milly Jenkins; they are so killingly funny; nearly as good as Boris and Kitty Lorrimer. I always had a little bit of the wild element in me, and I suppose it must come out somehow. Annie was wild enough when she was my age, wasn't she, Hester?\"  \"Annie will be gay and light-hearted to the end of the chapter!\" exclaimed Hester.  \"But she was naughty when she was my age, wasn't she?\"  \"She is not naughty now.\"  \"Well, no more will I be when I am sixteen. Now, good-night, Het. Am I to sleep in your room?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How scrumptious. Look out for a fine waking early in the morning.\"  Nan hugged Hester in her usual rough-and-ready manner, and danced upstairs, singing as she went--      \"_Old Daddy-long-legs wouldn't say his prayers,     Catch him by his left leg and throw him downstairs._\"  This was one of Nan's rhymes which Sir John detested. Her voice was loud and somewhat piercing. He heard it in the drawing-room, and went deliberately and shut the door.  \"Miss Forest,\" he said to his young guest, \"there are moments when I feel extremely uneasy with regard to the fate of my youngest daughter.\"  \"About Nan's fate?\" exclaimed Annie, raising her arched eyebrows; \"why, she is quite the dearest little thing in the world. I wish you could see her at school; she is the pet of all the girls at Lavender House.\"  \"That may be,\" said Sir John, with a slightly sarcastic movement of his thin lips; \"but it does not follow that school pets are home pets. If my good friend, Mrs. Willis, finds Nan's society so agreeable, I wish she would arrange to keep her for the holidays.\"  Annie's young face, so round, so fresh, so charming, was fixed in grave surprise on her elderly host.  \"Don't you love Nan at all?\" she asked, wonder in her tone.  Sir John had been giving Miss Forest credit for great tact. Up to this moment, he had considered her a very pretty, agreeable little girl, who would be an acquisition in the house. Now he winced; she had trodden very severely on one of his corns.  \"I naturally have a regard for my child,\" he said, after a pause, \"and I presume that I show it best by having her properly educated and disciplined in her youth.\"  \"Oh, no, I don't think you do,\" said Annie. \"You must forgive me for saying frankly what I really think. I used to be like Nan when I was a little girl, and I'd never have changed--never--never, I'd never have become thoughtful for others, I'd always have been an unmitigated horror to all my friends if my father had treated me like that. He's not a bit like you, Sir John. I don't mean to compare him to you for a moment. He is quite a rough sort of man, and he has led a rough life; but, oh dear me, from the time he came back from Australia, and I knew that I had a living father, I cannot tell you what a difference there has been in my life. I have generally spent my holidays with him, and he has loved me so much that I have loved him back again, and have learnt to know exactly what will please him and make him happy. Nothing tamed me so much as the knowledge that I was necessary to my father's happiness. I am sure,\" added Annie in a low voice, and with a suspicion of tears in her eyes, \"that it would be just the same with dear little Nan.\"  She broke down suddenly, half afraid of her own temerity. There was silence for nearly half a minute then Sir John rose from his chair, and, going over to a lamp which was slightly smoking, turned it down.  \"If your father has been in Australia,\" he said, turning again and looking fixedly at his young visitor, \"you will be interested in books on that country. I have got all Henry Kingsley's novels. You will find them in the library. Ask Hester to show you the book-case.\"  He strode deliberately out of the room, and Annie had to own to herself that she felt crushed.     CHAPTER III.  TWO PROVERBS.   Hester Thornton and Annie Forest had been educated at the same school--the well-known Lavender House. The fame of this school, the noble character of its mistress, the excellent training which each girl who went there received, formed a recommendation for each young student in after life. Hester and Annie had gone through severe storms in these early days. Their friendship had been cemented under the influence of great trouble. It was exactly a year now since Hester had been suddenly sent for from her busy and happy school life to take care of her father through a dangerous illness. He found her company so sweet, her skill and tact in managing his house so great, that he resolved not to allow her to go back to school again. Annie Forest was now, therefore, the head girl at Lavender House. She was Mrs. Willis's right hand; her help and support in every way. Annie was as great a favourite as of old, and as love and kindness had developed all the best side of her character, she was no longer the tomboy of the school, nor the one who was invariably the ringleader when mischief was afloat. She was still impulsive, however--eager, impatient--for such a nature as hers must fight on to the end of the chapter. She did not possess Hester Thornton's steady principles, and would always be influenced, whether for good or evil, by her companions. She was only to spend one more term at school; the future, after that, was practically unknown to her.  \"I wish you'd tell me about Nan,\" said Hester, on the first evening of Annie's visit to the Grange. \"I don't know why, but I feel a little anxious about her.\"  \"You need not be,\" replied Annie. \"She is a dear, jolly little pet, and as open as the day.\"  \"She seems to get wilder and wilder,\" replied Hester. \"You must have noticed, Annie, how she irritates my father.\"  \"Of course I did,\" replied Annie. \"Do you know, Het, that I had the unbounded cheek to give him a piece of my mind this evening?\"  Annie was seated on the side of Hester's bed. She was in a blue dressing-gown, and her dark hair, in a mass of rebellious curls, was falling about her shoulders.  \"I forgot that Nan was in the room,\" she said, putting her finger to her lips and glancing in the direction of Nan's small bed. \"The little monkey may be awake, and I don't want her to hear my nonsense.\"  \"She is sound asleep,\" replied Hester. \"If she were awake, she would soon acquaint us with the fact.\"  \"Shall I tell you what I really said to your father?\" continued Annie.  \"I don't know that I want to hear. I hope you did not shock him, for he is prepared to like you very much.\"  \"I am prepared to like him. I think he is a delightful host; but, oh, _how_ I should hate him for a father.\"  \"Annie!\"  Hester's delicate face flushed crimson, her eyes flashed an angry light.  Annie jumped off the bed and ran to her friend's side.  \"Now you are angry with me,\" she said; \"but if I told him the truth, I may surely tell you. I know you are as good as an angel, but I am quite certain that he ruffles you up the wrong way.\"  \"Don't, Annie,\" said Hester, in a voice of pain.  She walked to the window as she spoke, drew up the blind, and looked out. The night was dark, but innumerable stars could be seen in the deep, unfathomable vault of the sky. Hester clenched one of her hands tightly together. Annie stood and watched her.  \"I would not hurt you for the world,\" she said. \"I am sorry, very sorry; the fact is, I love you with all my heart, but I don't understand you.\"  \"Yes you do, too well,\" replied Hester; \"but there are some things I cannot and will not talk about even to you. Now let me take you to your room, the hour is very late.\"  Annie's pretty room was just on the other side of the passage. Hester took her to it, saw that she had every comfort, and wished her good-night. She then stood for a moment, with a look of irresolution on her face, in the corridor.  \"I don't believe nurse is in bed; I will go and speak to her,\" she said to herself. \"I thought the day when I welcomed Nan back from school, and when Annie came to visit me, would be quite the happiest day of my life, but it would never do to make my father's home uncomfortable for him.\" She reached the baize door, opened it, and soon found herself in the old nursery. She was right, nurse was not yet in bed.  \"Well, now, my deary!\" exclaimed the old woman, \"and why are you losing your beauty sleep in this fashion? When I was young things used to be very different. Girls had to be in bed by ten o'clock sharp to keep away the wrinkles, but now they're all agog to burn the candle at both ends. It don't pay, Miss Hetty, my pet, it don't pay.\"  \"I'm all right, nursey,\" replied Hester. \"I'm the quietest and most jog-trot girl in the world as a rule. Of course I'm excited to-night, because Nan has"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23024"],["title","Grimm Tales Made Gay (#1)"],["body","it was better,   I fear, he should get her:     Just think what she might have become!   For an infant so keen   Might in future have been     A woman of awful renown,   Who carried on fights   For her feminine rights     As the Mare of an Arkansas town.   She might have continued the crime of her 'teens,   And come to write verse for the Big Magazines!    [Illustration]     _The Moral_: There's nothing much glummer     Than children whose talents appall:   One much prefers those who are dumber,     But as for the paragons small,   If a swallow cannot make a summer     It can bring on a summary fall!    [Illustration]       _How the Fatuous Wish of a Peasant Came True_     An excellent peasant,   Of character pleasant,     Once lived in a hut with his wife.   He was cheerful and docile,   But such an old fossil     You wouldn't meet twice in your life.   His notions were all without reason or rhyme,   Such dullness in any one else were a crime,     But the folly pig-headed   To which he was wedded   Was so deep imbedded,         it touched the sublime!    [Illustration]    He frequently stated   Such quite antiquated     And singular doctrines as these:   _\"Do good unto others!   All men are your brothers!\"_     (Of course he forgot the Chinese!)   He said that all men were made equal and free,   (That's true if they're born on _our_ side of the sea!)     That truth should be spoken,   And pledges unbroken:   (Now where, by that token,         would most of us be?)    [Illustration]    One day, as his pottage   He ate in his cottage,     A fairy stepped up to the door;   Upon it she hammered,   And meekly she stammered:     \"A morsel of food I implore.\"   He gave her sardines, and a biscuit or two,   And she said in reply, when her luncheon was through,     \"In return for these dishes   Of bread and of fishes   The first of your wishes         I'll make to come true!\"    That nincompoop peasant   Accepted the present,     (As most of us probably would,)   And, thinking her bounty   To turn to account, he     Said: \"_Now_ I'll do somebody good!   I won't ask a thing for myself or my wife,   But I'll make all my neighbors with happiness rife.     Whate'er their conditions,     Henceforward, physicians     And indispositions         they're rid of for life!\"    [Illustration]    These words energetic   The fairy's prophetic     Announcement brought instantly true:   With singular quickness   Each victim of sickness     Was made over, better than new,   And people who formerly thought they were doomed   With almost obstreperous healthiness bloomed,     And each had some platitude,     Teeming with gratitude,     For the new attitude         life had assumed.    [Illustration]    Our friend's satisfaction   Concerning his action     Was keen, but exceedingly brief.   The wrathful condition   Of every physician     In town was surpassing belief!   Professional nurses were plunged in despair,   And chemists shook passionate fists in the air:     They called at his dwelling,     With violence swelling,     His greeting repelling         with arrogant stare.    [Illustration]    They beat and they battered,   They slammed and they shattered,     And did him such serious harm,   That, after their labors,   His wife told the neighbors     They'd caused her excessive alarm!   They then set to work on his various ills,   And plied him with liniments, powders, and pills,     And charged him so dearly     That all of them nearly     Made double the yearly         amount of their bills.     _This Moral_ by the tale is taught:--   The wish is father to the thought.   (We'd oftentimes escape the worst   If but the thinking part came first!)       How Hop O' My Thumb Got Rid of an Onus     [Illustration]    A worthy couple, man and wife,   Dragged on a discontented life:     The reason, I should state,   That it was destitute of joys,   Was that they had a dozen boys     To feed and educate,   And nothing such patience demands   As having twelve boys on your hands!    [Illustration]    For twenty years they tried their best   To keep those urchins neatly dressed     And teach them to be good,   But so much labor it involved   That, in the end, they both resolved     To lose them in a wood,   Though nothing a parent annoys   Like heartlessly losing his boys!    So when their sons had gone to bed,   Though bitter tears the couple shed,     They laid their little plan.   \"_Faut b'en que ça s'fasse. Quand même_,\"   The woman said, \"_J'en suis tout' blème._\"     \"_Ça colle!_\" observed the man,   \"_Mais ça coute, que ces gosses fichus!   B'en, quoi! Faut qu'i's soient perdus!_\"    (I've quite omitted to explain   That they were natives of Touraine;     I see I must translate.)   \"Of course it must be done, and still,\"   The wife remarked, \"it makes me ill.\"     \"You bet!\" replied her mate:   \"But we've both of us counted the cost,   And the kids simply _have_ to be lost!\"    [Illustration]    But, while they plotted, every word   The youngest of the urchins heard,     And winked the other eye;   His height was only two feet three.   (I might remark, in passing, he     Was little, but O My!)   He added: \"I'd better keep mum.\"   (He was foxy, was Hop O' My Thumb!)    [Illustration]    They took the boys into the wood,   And lost them, as they said they should,     And came in silence back.   Alas for them! Hop O' My Thumb   At every step had dropped a crumb,     And so retraced the track.   While the parents sat mourning their fate   He led the boys in at the gate!    He placed his hand upon his heart,   And said: \"You think you're awful smart,     But I have foiled you thus!\"   His parents humbly bent the knee,   And meekly said: \"H. O. M. T.,     You're one too much for us!\"   And both of them solemnly swore   \"We won't never do so no more!\"    [Illustration]     _The Moral_ is: While I do not   Endeavor to condone the plot,     I still maintain that one   Should have no chance of being foiled,   And having one's arrangements spoiled     By one's ingenious son.   If you turn down your children, with pain,   Take care they don't turn up again!       How the Helpmate of Blue-Beard Made Free with a Door     [Illustration]    A maiden from the Bosphorus,   With eyes as bright as phosphorus,     Once wed the wealthy bailiff                     Of the caliph                           Of Kelat.   Though diligent and zealous, he   Became a slave to jealousy.     (Considering her beauty,                     'Twas his duty                           To be that!)    When business would necessitate   A journey, he would hesitate,     But, fearing to disgust her,                     He would trust her                           With his keys,   Remarking to her prayerfully:   \"I beg you'll use them carefully.     Don't look what I deposit                     In that closet,                           If you please.\"    It may be mentioned, casually,   That blue as lapis lazuli     He dyed his hair, his lashes,                     His mustaches,                           And his beard.   And, just because he did it, he   Aroused his wife's timidity:     Her terror she dissembled,                     But she trembled                           When he neared.    [Illustration: _This shows how grim Blue-Beard, when bound on a bat,                  Instructed his wife on the key of a flat!_]    This feeling insalubrious   Soon made her most lugubrious,     And bitterly she missed her                     Elder sister                           Marie Anne:   She asked if she might write her to   Come down and spend a night or two,     Her husband answered rightly                     And politely:                           \"Yes, you can!\"                            Blue-Beard, the Monday following,                           His jealous feeling swallowing,                             Packed all his clothes together                                            In a leather-                                                  Bound valise,                           And, feigning reprehensibly,                           He started out, ostensibly                             By traveling to learn a                                            Bit of Smyrna                                                  And of Greece.    His wife made but a cursory   Inspection of the nursery;     The kitchen and the airy                     Little dairy                           Were a bore,   As well as big or scanty rooms,   And billiard, bath, and ante-rooms,     But not that interdicted                     And restricted                           Little door!    [Illustration]    For, all her curiosity   Awakened by the closet he     So carefully had hidden,                     And forbidden                           Her to see,   This damsel disobedient   Did something inexpedient,     And in the keyhole tiny                     Turned the shiny                           Little key:    [Illustration]    Then started back impulsively,   And shrieked aloud convulsively--     Three heads of girls he'd wedded                     And beheaded                           Met her eye!   And turning round, much terrified,   Her darkest fears were verified,     For Blue-Beard stood behind her,                     Come to find her                           On the sly!    [Illustration]    Perceiving she was fated to   Be soon decapitated, too,     She telegraphed her brothers                     And some others                           What she feared.   And Sister Anne looked out for them,   In readiness to shout for them     Whenever in the distance                     With assistance                           They appeared.    But only from her battlement   She saw some dust that cattle meant.     The ordinary story                     Isn't gory,                           But a jest.   But here's the truth unqualified.
