It conveyed them to a large ship, whose sails were hanging in the loose condition peculiar to a vessel ready to set sail.  An hour after that the anchor was raised, and wind and tide carried the ship gently down to the sea.  There seemed to Will something very solemn and mysterious in the quiet way in which, during these still and dark hours of the night, the great ship was slowly moved towards her ocean cradle.  At length she floated on the sea, and, soon after, the moon arose on the distant horizon, streaming across the rippling surface as if to kiss and welcome an old friend.  The wind increased; the ship became submissive to the breeze, obedient to the helm, and ere long moved on the waters like \"a thing of life,\" leaving Old England far behind her.  It was then that young Osten, leaning over the taffrail and looking wistfully back at the point where he had seen the last glimpse of the chalk cliffs, began to experience the first feelings of regret.  He tried to quiet his conscience by recalling the harsh and unjustifiable conduct of his father, but conscience would not be quieted thus, and faithful memory reminded him of the many acts of kindness he had experienced at his father's hands, while she pointed to his gentle mother, and bade him reflect what a tremendous blow this sudden departure would be to her.  Starting up and shaking off such thoughts, sternly he went below and threw himself into his narrow cot, where conscience assailed him still more powerfully and vividly in dreams.  Thus did Wandering Will leave his native land.  Commenting on his sudden departure, two days afterwards, Maryann said, in strict confidence, to her bosom friend \"Jemimar,\" that she \"know'd it would 'appen--or somethink simular, for, even w'en a hinfant, he had refused to larf at her most smudgin' blandishments; and that she knew somethink strange would come of it, though she would willingly have given her last shilling to have prevented it, but nothink was of any use tryin' of w'en one couldn't do it, as her 'usband, as was in the mutton-pie line, said to the doctor the night afore he died,--and that her 'art was quite broken about it, so it was.\"  Whereupon Jemima finished to the dregs her last cup of tea, and burst into a flood of tears.    CHAPTER THREE.  TELLS OF THE SEA, AND SOME OF THE MYSTERIES CONNECTED THEREWITH.  For many days and nights the good ship _Foam_ sailed the wide ocean without encountering anything more than the ordinary vicissitudes and experiences of sea-life.  Dolphins were seen and captured, sharks were fished for and caught, stiff breezes and calms succeeded each other, constellations in the far north began to disappear and new constellations arose in the southern skies.  In fact, during many weeks the voyage was prosperous, and young Will Osten began to experience those peculiar feelings with which all travellers are more or less acquainted--he felt that the ship was \"home\"; that his cabin with its furniture, which had appeared so small and confined at first, was quite a large and roomy place; that all the things about him were positive realities, and that the home of his childhood was a shadow of the past-- a sort of dream.  During all this time the young doctor led a busy life.  He was one of those active, intelligent, inquiring spirits which cannot rest.  To acquire information was with him not a duty, but a pleasure.  Before he had been many days at sea he knew the name and use of every rope, sail, block, tackle, and spar in the ship, and made himself quite a favourite with the men by the earnestness with which he questioned them in regard to nautical matters and their own personal experiences.  George Goff, the sail-maker, said he \"was a fust-rate feller;\" and Larry O'Hale, the cook, declared, \"he was a trump intirely, an' ought to have been born an Irishman.\"  Moreover, the affections of long Mr Cupples (as the first mate was styled by the men) were quite won by the way in which he laboured to understand the use of the sextant, and other matters connected with the mysteries of navigation; and stout Jonathan Dall, the captain, was overjoyed when he discovered that he was a good player on the violin, of which instrument he was passionately fond.  In short, Will Osten became a general favourite on board the _Foam_, and the regard of all, from the cabin-boy to the captain, deepened into respect when they found that, although only an advanced student and, \"not quite a doctor,\" he treated their few ailments with success, and acted his part with much self-possession, gentleness, and precision.  Larry O'Hale was particularly eloquent in his praises of him ever after the drawing of a tooth which had been the source of much annoyance to the worthy cook.  \"Why, messmates,\" he was wont to say, \"it bait everything the way he tuk it out.  `Open yer mouth,' says he, an' sure I opened it, an' before I cud wink, off wint my head--so I thought--but faix it wor only my tuth--a real grinder wi' three fangs no less--och! he's a cliver lad intirely.\"  But Will did not confine his inquiries to the objects contained within his wooden home.  The various phases and phenomena of the weather, the aspects of the sky, and the wonders of the deep, claimed his earnest attention.  To know the reason of everything was with him a species of mania, and in pursuit of this knowledge he stuck at nothing.  \"Never venture never win,\" became with him as favourite a motto as it had been with his father, and he acted on it more vigorously than his father had ever done.  One calm evening, as he was leaning over the side of the ship near the bow, gazing contemplatively down into the unfathomable sea, he overheard a conversation between the cook and one of the sailors named Muggins. They were smoking their pipes seated on the heel of the bowsprit.  \"Larry,\" said Muggins, \"I think we have got into the doldrums.\"  \"Ye're out there, boy,\" said Larry, \"for I heerd the capting say we wos past 'em a long way.\"  The men relapsed into silence for a time.  Then Muggins removed his pipe and said--  \"Wot ever caused the doldrums?\"  \"That's more nor I can tell,\" said Larry; \"all I know about them is, that it's aisy to git into them, but uncommon hard to git out again.  If my ould grandmother was here, she'd be able to tell us, I make no doubt, but she's in Erin, poor thing, 'mong the pigs and the taties.\"  \"Wot could _she_ tell about the doldrums?\" said Muggins, with a look of contempt.  \"More nor ye think, boy; sure there isn't nothin' in the univarse but she can spaik about, just like a book, an' though she niver was in the doldrums as far as I knows, she's been in the dumps often enough; maybe it's cousins they are.  Anyhow she's not here, an' so we must be contint with spekilation.\"  \"What's that you say, Larry?\" inquired the captain, who walked towards the bow at the moment.  The cook explained his difficulty.  \"Why, there's no mystery about the doldrums,\" said Captain Dall.  \"I've read a book by an officer in the United States navy which explains it all, and the Gulf Stream, and the currents, an' everything.  Come, I'll spin you a yarn about it.\"  Saying this, the captain filled and lighted his pipe, and seating himself on the shank of the anchor, said--  \"You know the cause of ocean currents, I dare say?\"  \"Niver a taste,\" said Larry.  \"It's meself is as innocent about 'em as the babe unborn; an' as for Muggins there, _he_ don't know more about 'em than my ould shoes--\"  \"Or your old grandmother,\" growled Muggins.  \"Don't be irriverent, ye spalpeen,\" said Larry.  \"I ax her reverence's pardon, but I didn't know she wos a priest,\" said Muggins.--\"Go on, Cap'n Dall.\"  \"Well,\" continued the captain, \"you know, at all events, that there's salt in the sea, and I may tell you that there is lime also, besides other things.  At the equator, the heat bein' great, water is evaporated faster than anywhere else, so that there the sea is salter and has more lime in it than elsewhere.  Besides that it is hotter.  Of course, that being the case, its weight is different from the waters of the cold polar seas, so it is bound to move away an' get itself freshened and cooled.  In like manner, the cold water round the poles feels obliged to flow to the equator to get itself salted and warmed.  This state of things, as a natural consequence, causes commotion in the sea.  The commotion is moreover increased by the millions of shell-fish that dwell there.  These creatures, not satisfied with their natural skins, must needs have shells on their backs, and they extract lime from the sea-water for the purpose of makin' these shells.  This process is called secretin' the lime; coral insects do the same, and, as many of the islands of the south seas are made by coral insects, you may guess that a considerable lot of lime is made away with.  The commotion or disturbance thus created produces two great currents--from the equator to the poles and from the poles to the equator.  But there are many little odds and ends about the world that affect and modify these currents, such as depth, and local heat and cold, and rivers and icebergs, but the chief modifiers are continents.  The currents flowin' north from the Indian Ocean and southern seas rush up between Africa and America.  The space bein' narrow--comparatively--they form one strong current, on doublin' the Cape of Good Hope, which flies right across to the Gulf of Mexico.  Here it is turned aside and flows in a nor'-easterly direction, across the Atlantic towards England and Norway, under the name of the Gulf Stream, but the Gulf of Mexico has no more to do with it than the man in the moon, 'xcept in the way of turnin' it out of its nat'ral course.  This Gulf Stream is a _river of warm water_ flowing through the cold waters of the Atlantic; it keeps separate, and wherever it flows the climate is softened.  It embraces Ireland, and makes the climate there so mild that there is, as you know, scarcely any frost"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23272"],["title","The Story of the Rock (#1)"],["body","the year 1696, when a country gentleman of Essex, named Henry Winstanley, came forward, and, having obtained the necessary legal powers, began the great work of building on the wave-lashed rock.  Winstanley was an eccentric as well as a bold man.  He undoubtedly possessed an ingenious mechanical mind, which displayed itself very much in practical joking.  It is said of him that he made a machine, the spring of which was attached to an old slipper, which lay (apparently by chance) on the floor of his bedroom.  If a visitor kicked this out of his way, a phantom instantly arose from the floor!  He also constructed a chair which seized every one who sat down in it with its arms, and held them fast; and in his garden he had an arbour which went afloat in a neighbouring canal when any one entered it!  As might have been expected, Winstanley's lighthouse was a curious affair, not well adapted to withstand the fury of the waves.  It was highly ornamented, and resembled a Chinese pagoda much more than a lighthouse.  Nevertheless it must be said to the credit of this bold man, that after facing and overcoming, during six years, difficulties and dangers which up to that time had not been heard of, he finished his lighthouse, proved hereby the possibility of that which had been previously deemed impossible, and gave to mankind a noble example of enterprise, daring, and perseverance.  Our friend John Potter had, from the commencement, rendered able assistance in the dangerous work as a stone cutter, and he could not help feeling as if he had been deserted by an old friend that night when the boat went off to the rock without him.  It was in November 1703, when Winstanley expressed the wish that he might experience, in his lighthouse, the greatest storm that ever blew. On the 26th of that month his wish was granted!  That night there arose one of the fiercest gales that ever strewed our shores with wrecks and corpses.  The day before the storm, there were indications of its approach, so John Potter went down to the shore to look with some anxiety at the lighthouse.  There it stood, as the sun went down, like a star on the horizon, glimmering above the waste of foaming water.  When the dark pall and the driving sprays of that terrible night hid it from view, John turned his back on the sea and sought the shelter of his humble home.  It was a cheery home though a poor one, for Mrs Potter was a good housewife, despite her sharp temper; and the threatening aspect of the weather had subdued her somewhat.  \"You wouldn't like to be a lighthouse-keeper on a night like this, John, would you?\" asked Mrs Potter, as she busied herself with supper.  \"May be not: but I would be content to take things as they are sent. Anyhow, I mean to apply for the situation, because I like the notion of the quiet life, and the wage will be good as well as sure, which will be a matter of comfort to you, old girl.  You often complain, you know, of the uncertainty of my present employment.\"  \"Ay, but I'd rather 'ave that uncertainty than see you run the risk of bein' drownded in a light'ouse,\" said Mrs Potter, glancing uneasily at the window, which rattled violently as the fury of the gale increased.  \"Oh, faither,\" exclaimed Tommy, pausing with a potato halfway to his mouth, as he listened partly in delight and partly in dread to the turmoil without: \"I wish I was a man that I might go with 'ee to live in the light'ouse.  Wot fun it would be to hear the gale roarin' out _there_, an' to see the big waves _so close_, an' to feel the house shake, and--oh!\"  The last syllable expressed partly his inability to say more, and partly his horror at seeing the fire blown almost into the room!  For some time past the smoke had poured down the chimney, but the last burst convinced John Potter that it was high time to extinguish the fire altogether.  This accomplished, he took down an old family Bible from a shelf, and had worship, for he was a man who feared and loved God.  Earnestly did he pray, for he had a son in the coasting trade whom he knew to be out upon the raging sea that night, and he did not forget his friends upon the Eddystone Rock.  \"Get thee to bed, lass,\" he said when he had concluded.  \"I'll sit up an' read the word.  My eyes could not close this night.\"  Poor Mrs Potter meekly obeyed.  How strangely the weather had changed her!  Even her enemies--and she had many--would have said there was some good in her after all, if they had seen her with a tear trickling down her ruddy cheek as she thought of her sailor boy.  Day broke at last.  The gale still raged with an excess of fury that was absolutely appalling.  John Potter wrapped himself in a tarpaulin coat and sou'wester preparatory to going out.  \"I'll go with 'ee, John,\" said his wife, touching him on the shoulder.  \"You couldn't face it, Martha,\" said John.  \"I thowt ye had bin asleep.\"  \"No: I've bin thinkin' of our dear boy.  I can face it well enough.\"  \"Come, then: but wrap well up.  Let Tommy come too: I see he's gettin' ready.\"  Presently the three went out.  The door almost burst off its hinges when it was opened, and it required John's utmost strength to reclose it.  Numbers of people, chiefly men, were already hurrying to the beach. Clouds of foam and salt spray were whirled madly in the air, and, carried far inland, and slates and cans were dashing on the pavements. Men tried to say to each other that they had never seen such a storm, but the gale caught their voices away, and seemed to mingle them all up in one prolonged roar.  On gaining the beach they could see nothing at first but the heavings of the maddened sea, whose billows mingled their thunders with the wind.  Sand, gravel, and spray almost blinded them, but as daylight increased they caught glimpses of the foam above the rock.  \"God help us!\" said John, solemnly, as he and his wife and child sought shelter under the lee of a wall: \"_the light'ouse is gone_!\"  It was too true.  The Eddystone lighthouse had been swept completely away, with the unfortunate Winstanley and all his men: not a vestige, save a fragment of chain-cable, remained on the fatal rock to tell that such a building had ever been.    CHAPTER TWO.  BEGINNING OF RUDYERD'S LIGHTHOUSE.  The terrible gale which swept away the first lighthouse that was built on the Eddystone Rock, gave ample proof of the evils resulting from the want of such a building.  Just after the structure fell, a vessel, named the \"Winchelsea,\" homeward bound, approached the dreaded rock. Trusting, doubtless, to the light which had been destroyed so recently, she held on her course, struck, split in two, and went down with every soul on board.  The necessity for building another tower was thus made; as it were, urgently obvious; nevertheless, nearly four years elapsed before any one was found with sufficient courage and capacity to attempt the dangerous and difficult enterprise.  During this period, our friend John Potter, being a steady, able man, found plenty of work at the docks of Plymouth; but he often cast a wistful glance in the direction of \"the Rock\" and sighed to think of the tower that had perished, and the numerous wrecks that had occurred in consequence; for, not only had some vessels struck on the Rock itself, but others, keeping too far off its dreaded locality, were wrecked on the coast of France.  John Potter's sigh, it must be confessed, was also prompted, in part, by the thought that his dreams of a retired and peaceful life as a light-keeper were now destined never to be realised.  Returning home one evening, somewhat wearied, he flung his huge frame into a stout arm chair by the fireside, and exclaimed, \"Heigho!\"  \"Deary me, John, what ails you to-night?\" asked the faithful Martha, who was, as of yore, busy with the supper.  \"Nothin' partikler, Martha; only I've had a hard day of it, an I'm glad to sit down.  Was Isaac Dorkin here to-day?\"  \"No, 'e wasn't.  I wonder you keep company with that man,\" replied Mrs Potter, testily; \"he's for ever quarrelling with 'ee, John.\"  \"No doubt he is, Martha; but we always make it up again; an' it don't do for a man to give up his comrades just because they have sharp words now and then.  Why, old girl, you and I are always havin' a spurt o' that sort off and on; yet I don't ever talk of leavin' ye on that account.\"  To this Martha replied, \"Fiddlesticks;\" and said that she didn't believe in the friendship of people who were always fighting and making it up again; that for her part she would rather have no friends at all, she wouldn't; and that she had a settled conviction, she had, that Isaac Dorkin would come to a bad end at last.  \"I hope not, Martha; but in the meantime he has bin the means of gettin' me some work to do that is quite to my liking.\"  \"What may that be, John?\" asked Mrs Potter in surprise.  \"I'll tell you when we're at supper,\" said John with a smile; for he knew from experience that his better half was in a fitter state to swallow unpleasant news when engaged in swallowing her meals than at any other time.  \"Where is Tommy?\" he added, looking round at the quantity of chips which littered the floor.  \"Where is 'e?\" repeated Mrs Potter, in a tone of indignation.  \"Where would you expect 'im to be but after mischief?  'E's at the mod'l, of course; always at it; never at hanythingk else a'most.\"  \"No!\" exclaimed John, in affected surprise.  \"Wasn't he at school to-day?\"  \"O yes, of course 'e was at school.\"  \"An' did he git his lessons for to-morrow after comin' 'ome?\"  \"I suppose 'e did.\"  \"Ah then, he does something else _sometimes_, eh?\"  Mrs Potter's reply was interrupted by Tommy himself emerging from a closet, which formed his workshop and in which he was at that time busy with a model of Winstanley's lighthouse, executed from the drawings and descriptions by his father, improved by his own brilliant fancy.  Four years make a marked difference on a boy in the early stage of life. He was now nearly ten, and"]]]
