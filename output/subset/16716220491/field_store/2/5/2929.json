This can get real troublesome, like I pick up this five to ten this way.  \"See, they get this chump a couple too many. So, comes morning, he's still in the street. Real tough swinging a parole, too. I'm in here since five years, remember? So I'm real careful where I get muscle any more.\"  \"Sounds interesting.\" Stan nodded thoughtfully.  \"Great Space and all the little Nebulae,\" he said to himself. \"What kind of a planet is this? Nothing in the histories about this sort of thing.\" He walked over to the washstand.  \"Some day,\" he promised himself, \"I'm going to get out of here. And when I do, I'll set up camp by Guard Headquarters. And I'll needle those big brains till they do something about this.\"  There was, he remembered, one organization that should be able to do more than a little in a case like this. He smiled to himself ruefully as he thought of the almost legendary stories he had heard about the Federation's Special Corps for Investigation.  As he remembered the stories, though, corpsmen seemed to appear from nowhere when there was serious trouble. No one ever seemed to call them in. No one even knew how to get in touch with them. He shrugged.  The men of the Special Corps, he remembered, were reputed to be something in the superhuman line.  For a large part of his life, he had dreamed of working with them, but he had been unable to find any way of so much as applying for membership in their select group. So, he'd done the next best thing. He'd gone into the Stellar Guard. And he'd lasted only a little more than three years.  Somehow, he'd taken it from there. He was still a little hazy as to how he'd managed to land in prison on Kell's planet. It had been a mere stopover.  There had been no trial. Obviously, they had searched his luggage at the hotel, but there had been no discussion. He'd simply been beamed into unconsciousness.  After he'd gotten to Opertal, someone had told him the length of his sentence and they'd assigned him to the prison machine shop, to learn a useful trade and the duties of a citizen of Kellonia.  He smiled wryly. They had taught him machinery. And they'd introduced him to their culture. The trade was good. The culture--?         *       *       *       *       *  His memory slid back, past the prison--past the years in Kendall Hall, and beyond.  He was ten years old again.  It was a sunny day in a park and Billy Darfield was holding forth.  \"Yeah,\" the boy was saying, \"Dad told me about the time he met one of them. They look just like anyone else. Only, when things go wrong, there they are, just all at once. And when they tell you to do something, you've had it.\" He closed his eyes dreamily.  \"Oh, boy,\" he said happily, \"how I'd love to be like that! Wouldn't it be fun to tell old Winant, 'go off some place and drown yourself'?\"  Stan smiled incredulously. \"Aw, I've heard a lot about the Special Corps, too. They've just got a lot of authority, that's all. They can call in the whole Stellar Guard if they need 'em. Who's going to get wise with somebody that can do that?\"  Billy shook his head positively. \"Dad told me all about them, and he knows. He saw one of 'em chase a king right off his throne once. Wasn't anybody to help him, either. They've got all they need, all by themselves. Just have to tell people, that's all.\"         *       *       *       *       *  With a jerk, Stan came to the present. He slopped water over his hands.  \"Too bad I can't do something like that myself,\" he thought. \"I'd like to tell a few people to go out and drown themselves, right now.\" He grinned ruefully.  \"Only one trouble. I can't. Probably just a lot of rumor, anyway.\"  But there was something behind those stories of the Special Corps, he was sure. They didn't get official publicity, but there were pages of history that seemed somehow incomplete. There must have been someone around with a lot more than the usual ability to get things done, but whoever he had been, he was never mentioned.  He shrugged and turned away from the washstand.  \"Hope that bell rings pretty soon,\" he told himself. \"I'd better get chow and go to work before I really go nuts.\"  [Illustration]  A demonstrator had the back off from one of the big Lambert-Howell sprayers. As the man started to point out a feed assembly, another prisoner stepped directly in front of Graham.  Stan shook his head impatiently and moved aside. Again, the man was in front of him, blocking his view. Again, Stan moved.  The third time the man blocked his view, Stan touched his shoulder.  \"Hey, Chum,\" he said mildly, \"how about holding still a while. The rest of us would sort of like to see, too.\"  For several seconds, the other froze. Then he whirled, to present a scowling face.  \"Who you pushing around, little rat? Keep your greasy paws to yourself, see.\" He turned again, then took a sudden, heavy step back.  Stan moved his foot aside and the man's heel banged down on the stone floor. For a heartbeat, Stan regarded the fellow consideringly, then he shook his head.  \"Stay in orbit, remember?\" he told himself. He moved aside, going to the other side of the group around the fabricator.  Now he remembered the man. Val Vernay had been working on the fabricators when Stan had come to the shop.  Somehow, he had never run an acceptable program, but he hung around the demonstrations, unable to comprehend the explanations--resentful of those who showed aptitude.  He glanced aside as Stan moved, then pushed his way across until he was again in front of the smaller man. Stan sighed resignedly.  Again, the heavy foot crashed toward the rear. This time, the temptation was too great. Deftly, Stan swung his toe through a small arc, sweeping Vernay's ankle aside and putting the man off balance.  He moved quickly away, further trapping the ankle and getting clear of the flailing arms.  For a breathless instant, Vernay tried to hop on one foot, his arms windmilling as he fought to regain his balance. Then he crashed to the floor, his head banging violently against the stones.  Stan looked at the body in consternation. He had merely intended to make the fellow look a little silly.  \"Hope he's got a hard head,\" he told himself.  The workroom guard came up warily.  \"What's all this?\"  \"I don't know, sir.\" Stan managed a vaguely puzzled look. \"First thing I knew, he was swinging his arms all over the place. Then he went down. Maybe he had a fit, huh?\"  \"Yeah.\" The guard was sardonic. \"Yeah, maybe he had a fit. Well, no more trouble out of him for a while.\" He raised his voice.  \"Hey, you over by the first-aid kit. Grab that stretcher.\"  Big Carl Marlo was in his bunk when Stan came into the cell. He looked up with a grin.  \"Hey, kid, you start at the top, huh?\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"This Vernay, what else? Like I said, you start at the top. I didn't think you got it when I told you about the muscle racket. How'd I know you was already figuring something?\" Marlo shook his head admiringly.  \"Real nice job, too. You take it easy, set this chump up, and there you are. Only you get a real big fish. Think you can handle this guy again?\"  Stan blinked. \"Look,\" he said, \"punch in some more data, will you? And run it by real slow. I'm way off co-ordinates.\"  \"Huh? What you--Oh, I get you.\" Marlo frowned.  \"Now don't go telling me you don't know about this Vernay. Don't give me you ain't figured how you can land a big job with Janzel Equipment. You know me--Big Carl. I don't talk, remember?\" He looked at the blank expression on Stan's face.  \"Besides, there ain't a guy in the walls, don't figure this deal by now. Man, you just don't know how many guys been watching that Vernay.\"  Stan walked across the cell and sat down on his bunk.  \"Look,\" he said patiently, \"let's just say I'm some stupid kid from off planet. Maybe I don't get things so well. Now, what's this all about?\"  Marlo shrugged. \"So all right, but for some guy don't know what he's doing, you sure pick 'em pretty. Well, anyway, here's the layout.  \"See, this guy, Vernay, is one of Janzel's big strong-arms. Real salt and butter guy. Been pushing them poor apes of theirs all over the place, see. Don't know too much about the business, but they tell him some mug's not putting out, Vernay goes over and bends the guy around his machine a while, he should maybe work faster. See what I mean?\"  Stan frowned distastefully and Marlo held up a hand.  \"Oh, that's all right,\" he said. \"This is what they pay this guy for. But he gets to like his work too well, know what I mean? So here a while back, he gets on some machine tender. Leans all over this poor guy. Well, the fab nurse ends up turning in his tickets, and this, the joes don't go for so good.\" He jerked a shoulder.  \"Oh, Janzel tries to kill the squawk, but it's no go. The joes push the button and here's Vernay.\" He grinned.  \"They manage to get it knocked to some kinda manslaughter, but Vernay's still got time to pick up, so they pull wires and get him up here. It ain't no rest home, but it ain't no madhouse neither, like some of them places.\" His eyes clouded.  \"Oogh, when I think of some of the holes--\" He waved a hand.  \"So anyway, like you see, Vernay's got plenty of muscle, but he's kind of low in the brain department. Maybe they thought something might drill through the skull up here, but that don't work either. I guess Janzel'd about as soon get another pretty boy, but they know they'll lose too much face, they dump him right away.  \"Then you come along and just about split the chump's conk just so's he'll stay out of your light, see?\" He shook his head slowly.  \"Only thing, that don't solve nothing. He comes out of the bone-house in a couple days, and he ain't gonna like you at all. See what I mean?\"  \"Yeah.\" Stan examined his fingernails.  \"Yeah,\" he repeated. \"You make it all nice and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24182"],["title","Rollo in London (#1)"],["body"," so that the passengers get out nearly all at once, and the platform becomes immediately crowded. Beyond the platform, on the other side, there is usually, when a train comes in, a long row of cabs and carriages drawn up, ready to take the passengers from the several cars; so that the traveller has generally nothing to do but to step across the platform from the car that he came in to the cab that is waiting there to receive him. Nor is there, as is usual in America, any difficulty or delay in regard to the baggage; for each man's trunks are placed on the car that he rides in, directly over his head; so that, while he walks across the platform to the cab, the railway porter takes his trunk across and places it on the top of the cab; and thus he is off from the station in his cab within two minutes sometimes after he arrived at it in the car.  The railway porters, who attend to the business of transferring the passengers thus from the railway carriages to those of the street, are very numerous all along the platform; and they are very civil and attentive to the passengers, especially to those who come in the first-class cars--and more especially still, according to my observation and experience, if the traveller has an agreeable looking lady under his charge. The porters are dressed in a sort of uniform, by which they are readily distinguished from the crowd. They are strictly forbidden to receive any fee or gratuity from the passengers. This prohibition, however, does not prevent their taking very thankfully the shillings or sixpences[A] that are often offered them, particularly by Americans, who, being strangers in the country, and not understanding the customs very well, think that they require a little more attention than others, and so are willing to pay a little extra fee. It is, however, contrary to the rules of the station for the porters to receive any thing; and, if they take it at all, they try to do it as secretly as possible. I once knew a traveller who offered a porter a shilling openly on the platform; but the porter, observing a policeman near, turned round with his side to the gentleman, and, holding his hand open behind him, with the back of it against his hip and his fingers moving up and down briskly in a beckoning manner, said,--  \"We are not allowed to take it, sir--we are not allowed to take it.\"  [A] Whenever shillings or sixpences are mentioned in this book, English coin is meant. As a general rule, each English denomination is of double the value of the corresponding American one. Thus the English penny is a coin as large as a silver dollar, and it is worth two of the American pennies. The shilling is of the value of a quarter of a dollar; and a sixpence is equal to a New York shilling.         *       *       *       *       *  As Mr. George stepped out upon the platform at the London Bridge station his first thought was to find Rollo, who had chosen to come in a second-class car, partly for the purpose of saving the difference in the fare, and partly, as he said, \"for the fun of it.\" Rollo had a regular allowance from his father for his travelling expenses, sufficient to pay his way in the first-class conveyances; and the understanding was, that whatever he should save from this sum by travelling in the cheaper modes was to be his own for pocket money or to add to his reserved funds.  Mr. George and Rollo soon found each other on the platform.  \"Well, Rollo,\" said Mr. George, \"and how do you like travelling cheap?\"  \"Pretty well,\" said Rollo; \"only I could not see out much; but then I have saved six shillings in coming from Dover. That is the same as twelve New York shillings--a dollar and a half. I can buy several pretty things with that to carry home.\"  \"That's very true,\" said Mr. George.  \"Some time I mean to go in the fourth-class car,\" said Rollo. \"'Tis true we have to stand up all the time like sheep in a pen; but I shall not care for that.\"  \"Well, you can try it,\" said Mr. George; \"but now for our luggage.\"  The English people always call the effects which a traveller takes with him on the journey his luggage.  Very soon a porter took Mr. George's trunk from the top of the car.  \"Will you have a cab, sir?\" said the porter, touching his cap to Mr. George.  \"I want to leave my trunk here for a short time under your charge,\" said Mr. George. \"That is a little out of the line of your duty, I know; but I will remember that when I come for it.\"  \"All right, sir,\" said the porter, promptly, touching his cap again.  He took up the trunk and threw it on his shoulder; and then, followed by Mr. George and Rollo, he walked away to the luggage room. After it had been properly deposited in its place, Mr. George and Rollo went out of the station into the street.  \"Are not you going to ride?\" said Rollo to Mr. George.  \"No,\" said Mr. George; \"I am going to walk.\"  \"What's that for?\" said Rollo.  \"There are two reasons,\" said Mr. George; \"one is, I want to show you London Bridge.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo; \"and what is the other reason?\"  \"The other is,\" said Mr. George, \"that I do not wish to have the trouble of the luggage while I am looking out lodgings. If I go to a hotel and leave my luggage there and take a room, and then go and look up lodgings, we have the hotel bill to pay, without getting much benefit from it; and, if we take the luggage on a cab, we might go to a dozen different places before we find a room to suit us, and so have a monstrous great cab fare to pay.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo; \"I understand. Besides, I should like to walk through the streets and see the city.\"  As our two travellers walked along towards London Bridge, Mr. George explained to Rollo what is stated in the first chapter in respect to the double character of London.  \"What we are coming to now, first,\" said he, \"is the _city_--the commercial capital of the country. In fact, it may almost be said to be the commercial capital of the world. Here are the great docks and warehouses, where are accumulated immense stores of merchandise from every quarter of the globe. Here is the bank, with its enormous vaults full of treasures of gold and silver coin, and the immense legers in which are kept accounts with governments, and wealthy merchants, and great capitalists all over the world. Here is the post office, too, the centre of a system of communications, by land and sea, extending to every quarter of the globe.  \"The chief magistrate of the city,\" continued Mr. George, \"is called the lord mayor. He lives in a splendid palace called the Mansion House. Then there is the great Cathedral Church of St. Paul's, and a vast number of other churches, and chapels, and hospitals, and schools, all belonging to, and supported by, the commercial and business interests which concentrate in the city. You will find a very different set of buildings and institutions at the West End.\"  \"What shall we find there?\" asked Rollo.  \"We shall find there,\" said Mr. George, \"the palace of the queen; and the houses of Parliament, where the lords and commons assemble to make laws for the empire; and the Horse Guards, which is a great edifice that serves as head quarters for the British army; and the Admiralty, which is the head quarters of the navy; and the private palaces of the nobles; and the parks and pleasure grounds that connect and surround them.\"  About this time Mr. George and Rollo began to come in sight of London Bridge; and very soon afterwards they found themselves entering upon it. Rollo was, for a time, quite bewildered with astonishment at the extraordinary aspect of the scene. They came out upon the bridge, from the midst of a very dense and compact mass of streets and houses, on what is called the Surrey side of the river; and they could see, dimly defined through the murky atmosphere, the outlines of the city on the other side. There were long ranges of warehouses; and innumerable chimneys, pouring forth black smoke; and the Monument; and spires of churches; and, conspicuous among the rest,--though half obscured by murky clouds of smoke and vapor,--the immense dome of St. Paul's, with the great gilded ball and cross on the top of it.  The bridge was built of stone, on arches, and was of the most massive and ponderous character. There was a roadway in the centre of it, on which two continued streams of vehicles were passing--one on the left, going into the city; and the other on the right, coming out. On each side were broad stone sidewalks, formed of massive blocks of granite, feeling solid and heavy under the tread as if they had been laid upon the firm ground. These sidewalks were crowded with passengers, who were going, some into, and some out of, the city, so as to form on each sidewalk two continuous streams. On each side of the bridge, towards the water, was a solid parapet, or wall. This parapet was about as high as Rollo's shoulders. Here and there, at different places along the bridge, were groups of people that had stopped to look over the parapet to the river. Each group formed a little row, arranged along the parapet, with their faces towards the water.  \"Let us stop and look over,\" said Rollo.  \"No,\" said Mr. George, \"not now; we will wait till we get to the middle of the bridge.\"  So they walked on. When they had proceeded a little way, they came to a place where there was a sort of niche, or recess, in the parapet, perhaps ten or fifteen feet long, and four or five deep, from the sidewalk. There were stone seats extending all around the sides of this recess; and these seats were full of boys and men, some with burdens and some without, who had stopped and sat down there to rest. Rollo wished to propose to Mr. George that they should stop and sit down there too; not because he was tired, but only to see how it would seem to be seated in such a place. He did not propose this plan, however, for he saw at a glance that the seats were all occupied, and that there was no room.  A little distance beyond they came to"]]]
