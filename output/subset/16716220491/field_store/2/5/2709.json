And there is only one answer to such questions, a strong emphatic \"yes.\" It surely is the Christ-spirit that moves in all of this. This is a coming of Christ; and a blessed coming, too. There was nothing of this sort before the Christ-spirit began to sweeten the world's life. And there is none of it to-day except in those parts of the world where the Christ-spirit influences life.  But--there's a \"but\"--it proves a blessed but; this is only a crumb or two falling from a loaded table. And he who judges Christ by these crumbs only, wholesome and toothsome as they are, will have a very skimpy conception of Christ.  All of this sort of thing that has come has come very slowly. It has had to fight through and in, every step of the way that it has come. Its coming has been opposed stubbornly, maliciously, viciously every inch of the road, as only those know who are in the thick of the struggle for these reforms, panting for breath sometimes.  It is as though a few whiffs of wholesome life-giving air have breathed through the cracks and crevices of the breastworks and fortifications of evil in which all our common life seems entrenched. But the fortifications are still there. If the sweet, wholesome breathing in through cracks and crannies has been so blest, what would it be if the forces of evil were clean removed from the scene, and the Christ-spirit became the whole atmosphere breathed fully and freely without restraint, with no bad draughts, and no counter currents to guard and fight against?  It would seem like a strange sort of a kingdom if the present is even a gradual coming in of the Kingdom. We would seem to be having a new, strange sort of a Christ if the present is a sample of His sort of reigning. For it may well be thoughtfully doubted if ever there was such a condition of feverish unrest in all parts of the world as to-day.  It is most difficult to put your finger on a single spot of the world-map that is not being torn and uptorn by unrest in one shape or another. Either actual war, or constant studious preparation for war, actually never ceases. And it is difficult to say which is the worse of the two. The actual war reveals more terribly to our eyes and ears the awful cost in treasure and in precious human blood spilled without stint. The never-ceasing preparation for war seems actually to cost more. In the immense treasure involved, and in blood too, given out, not on an occasional battlefield, but in the continual battle of daily life to meet the terrible drain of taxation, it costs immensely more. There is less of the tragic for the news headings, but not a whit less, rather much more, in the slow suffering, the pinched lives, and the awful temptations to barter character for bread.  Then there is the continual seething unrest in the industrial world; the protests sometimes so strange and startling against social and political conditions; the feverish greed for gold, and land, and position; the intense pace of all our modern life; the abandonment of home and home ideals; the terrific attack against our young womanhood. The political pot which gathers into itself all these things, never quits boiling or boiling over, in some part of the world, now here, now there. And it seems like the greatest achievement of diplomacy when here and there it can be kept from boiling clean over, or at least made to boil over less.  It would seem indeed like a queer sort of kingdom if this is a sample. Some of us would have less heart in repeating one petition of the old daily prayer. And Christ would seem to have quite changed His spirit and character if this is a result of His coming.   The Greatness of Patience.  And the great simple truth is this, the truth that in the strange mix-up of life we easily lose sight of is this: _Christ has not yet taken possession of all of His domain_; a part of it still remains to be possessed. \"We see _not yet_ all things subjected to Him.\"[23] We are living in the \"not-yet\" interval between the crowning and the actual reigning. We are living on the \"not-yet\" possessed part of His domain.  And the question that comes hot and quick from our lips, even though with an attempt at subdued reverence, is this: \"Why does He not take possession, and untangle the snarl, and right the wrongs, and bring in the true rational order of things?\" And all the long waiting, the soreness of hearts over the part that touches one's own life most closely, the shortness of breath in the tensity of the struggle, underscore that word \"why?\"  And the answer to the impatient question reveals all afresh the greatness of the love of our Christ. His greatness is shown most in His _patience_. But patience is one of the things we men on this old earth don't know. It's one of the unknown quantities to us. It can be known only by knowing God. For patience is love at its best. Patience is God at His best. His is the patience that sees all, and feels all with the tender heart that broke once under the load, and yet waits, steadily waits, and then waits just a bit longer.  In this He runs the risk of being misunderstood. Men in their stupidity constantly mistake strong patience for weakness or indifference or lack of a gripping purpose. And God is misunderstood in this, even by His trusting children. But, even so, the object to be gained is so great, and so near Christ's heart that He waits, strongly waits with a patience beyond our comprehension; waits just a bit longer, always just a bit longer.  There are two parts to the answer. Jesus the Christ is giving man the fullest opportunity. He never interferes with man's right of free choice. Man is free to do as he chooses. Every possible means is used to influence him to choose right, but the choice itself is always left to the man. The present is man's opportunity. The initiative of action on the earth is altogether in man's hand. All of God's power is at man's disposal; but man must _reach out_ and _take_. This long stretched but waiting time is for man's sake, that he may have fullest opportunity. The longsuffering of God would woo men.[24]  When at length opportunity comes to its end it will be only because things have gotten into such desperate shape, into such an awful fix, that at length _for man's sake_ Christ will step into the direct action of the earth once again. He will take the leadership of earth into His own hands, even while still leaving each man free in his individual choice. This is the first part of the answer. The waiting is that man may have fullest opportunity.  Then Christ has a great hunger for _willing_ hearts. No words are strong enough to tell His longing for a free, glad, joyous surrender to His mastery. He could so easily end the present conflict, but He waits that men may bring to Him the allegiance of their lives, given of their own glad, gracious, voluntary accord. He was a volunteer Saviour. He longs for that love that is the bubbling out of a free, full heart.  The best love is only given freely without any compulsion of any sort, save only love's sweet compelling. He wants what He gives--the best. And so He waits, patiently waits just a bit longer. This is the second bit of the answer. The long delay spells out the hunger as well as the patience of God's heart. The divine Husbandman is patiently waiting, and sending warm sun and soft rains and fragrant dews while waiting.[25]   \"The Husbandman waiteth--    The _Husbandman_? Why?  For the heart of one servant    Who hears not His cry.   \"The Husbandman waiteth--    He _waiteth_? What for?  For the heart of one servant    To love Him yet more.   \"The Husbandman waiteth--    Long patience hath He--  But He waiteth in hunger--    Oh! Is it for thee?\"[26]   Taking with Your Life.  But--ah! listen, there's a wonderful \"but\" to put in here. But, while waiting _He puts all His limitless power at our disposal_. If that simple sentence could be put into letters of living flame, its tremendous meaning might burn into our hearts. When Paul piled up phrase on phrase in his eager attempt to have his Asiatic friends in and around Ephesus take in the limitless power of the ascended Christ, he added the significant words, \"to the Church.\"[27] All that power is for the use, and at the disposal, of the Church.  The Church was meant to be a unit in spirit in loyalty to her absent Lord, wholly under the dominating touch of the Holy Spirit, not only in her official actions, but in the lives of the individual members. If she were so, no human imagination could take in the startling, revolutionary power, softly, subtly, but with resistless sweep, flowing down from the crowned Christ, among grateful men.  Not being such a unit it is not possible that that power shall be as great in manifestation as was planned and meant. For no individual nor group can ever take the place in action of the whole unified body of believers, acting as a channel for the power of the crowned Christ. That power shall be realized on the earth only when the Church is so unified, and at work, under the reigning Christ, from the new headquarters up in the heavens.  But meanwhile all of that power is _at the disposal of any disciple of Christ_--the humblest--who will simply live in full-faced touch with Christ, and who will _take_ of that power as the need comes, and as the sovereign Holy Spirit leads.

As soon as they were gone I began to collect my thoughts, and to consider my best chance of finding the lost ring.  As I heard Mr Wells say that he would not have lost it for a hundred pounds, I believed that was its value, and though I had no just conception of how much a hundred pounds was, I knew that it must be a great deal of money.  I was therefore very anxious to restore it to the kind gentleman.  Here I benefited by my good mother's instruction; and I believed her spirit watched over me to keep me from evil; for it never occurred to me, as I am sorry to say it did to some of the other boys who overheard the gentleman's observation, that it would be easier if the ring was found to sell it and secure its value, than to trust to the chance of obtaining a small reward by returning it to its proper owner.  I fortunately overheard them plotting to secure the ring for themselves, and I determined to counteract their plan.  Though the water was deep where the ring had fallen there was no current, as it was in a little bay in the bank of the river, and what was more, I remembered that the ground was rather harder than that surrounding it, and that it rose slightly outside.  These circumstances gave me hopes of finding the ring; so I sat down at some little distance on the bank, pretending to be counting the money I had received, but in reality watching narrowly the spot where I thought it had fallen.  I do not mean to say that I was indifferent to my good fortune, but I honestly believe I thought much more of the pleasure it would give the poor people who had charitably taken care of me in my destitution, than of the benefit I should myself derive from it.  The tide had only run off a very little when the ring was thrown in, so that I had a considerable time to wait; but though I grew very hungry, and felt that I might enjoy a plentiful meal, I would not quit my post; indeed, I was accustomed to starve, so that did not incommode me much.  Slowly the tide receded, and one after one the other boys went away.  At last the bank appeared, and the intervening space was left with very little water over it.  I was in hopes that none of the other boys would return to interrupt me in my search; but, to my annoyance, just as the mud was left quite clear, two of them came back, and immediately tucking up their trousers, hurried into the mud.    CHAPTER TWO.  NEW FRIENDS.  Now it so happened that I had carefully noted where the penny had fallen, and if I had been alone, I could have gone straight to the place.  But, wishing to mislead my rivals in the search, I waded into the water at a considerable distance from the spot.  Glad of a clue, the other mud-larks came over to me in a hurry, and began hunting about. Leaving them there, I went to another place, and so on till I gradually approached the spot where I thought the ring had fallen.  They again followed me, and as I was stooping down I heard one of them cry out, and I thought he had found the treasure, but it was only the penny Mr Wells had thrown me.  \"Ho! ho!\"  I thought, \"the ring will not have reached as far as that, but I must make haste and find it, or it will be too dark to see anything.\"  The other boys thought the ring must be close to the penny, and kept turning up the mud in every direction round it, while I worked my way straight on to where the boat had been.  I had begun to think that I must have passed it, when I saw something glitter in a little pool of water just under a large stone.  I stooped down, and to my joy I found that it was the gold ring.  My first impulse was to sing out, but then it struck me that I might run some chance of being robbed of my treasure, and that it would be a just punishment to the naughty boys to keep them still hunting for it; so, instead of saying anything about the matter, I pretended to be groping on as before, and at last, on getting near the shore, I exclaimed that there was no chance of any one finding it that night, and that I should go home.  On getting on shore I ran as fast as my legs would carry me, eager to give my charitable friends an account of my good fortune, but with regard to the ring I said not a word.  The instinctive caution I possessed taught me that it would be wiser to say nothing, even to them, about it.  I told them, as was the case, that the money had been given to me by the gentlemen for repeating poetry to them.  We had a capital supper that night, the best I had ever enjoyed; and giving my wealth to my friends to keep for me, I set off the next morning, my heart beating high with satisfaction, to restore the ring to Mr Wells.  I found his house without much difficulty, although I had never been in that part of London before, but my wits were not at fault on this occasion more than on any other.  A domestic opened the door, whom I at first took to be a very great lord, for I had seldom before seen a livery servant; but when he told me that his master was not at home, and he could not say when he would return, and without deigning any further answer slammed the door in my face, I guessed who he was.  I accordingly sat down on the steps to wait patiently for the return of Mr Wells.  As I had been thinking all night long of my good fortune, I had not slept a wink, and it was therefore not surprising that I fell very fast asleep where I sat.  How long I thus remained dreaming of the events of the previous day I do not know, when I was awaked by the sound of a kind voice in my ear, and opening my eyes I saw Mr Wells standing before me.  \"Ah, my little poet!\" he exclaimed; \"you here already!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" I answered, jumping up; \"and I have found your ring, and brought it to you too.\"  \"Have you indeed?  That is more than I expected,\" he replied.  \"But come in, and you can then give me the ring, and tell me something about yourself.\"  So I went into his house, and he was evidently pleased when he saw the ring, which I had washed and wrapped up carefully in a bit of rag, and it looked clean and bright.  He then took me into the parlour, where two ladies were sitting at breakfast, where he made me join them, all untidy as I was, at their meal; after which he desired me to give a full account of myself, and to recite some more poetry, all of which I did, apparently much to the satisfaction of the party present.  \"'Twere a pity for the child to grow up neglected and uncared for, as will probably be his fate, till he becomes in no way superior to the uncultivated, ignorant men among whom he will be doomed to live,\" observed one of the ladies to Mr Wells, who was, I found, his wife. \"Can you do anything for him?\"  \"I was thinking on the subject, my love,\" answered Mr Wells.  \"The question in my mind is, `In what position shall he be placed?'\"  \"Oh, my dear, that is very easy,\" replied the lady, in an eager tone; \"send him to a good school, and then make him one of your clerks.\"  \"That might not prove a real kindness after all,\" said her husband; \"he has already, by his own exertions and good conduct, made one step up the ladder, and I think it will be wiser to leave him to work his own way upward.  He will then be less liable to slip down again.  I will keep an eye on him, and give him advice when he requires it.\"  This I believe he said for my benefit, that I might not fancy that I had nothing further to do than to wait for the coming of good luck, as is the case too often with certain people, who then grumble and find fault with the world because their luck never comes.  I do not mean to say that opportunities do not occur to some men more frequently than to others, but I believe that they visit most of us at some time or other of our lives, and that it is our own fault if we do not take advantage of them.  \"But I will learn what the boy himself has to say on the subject,\" said Mr Wells.--\"What would you like to do, my lad?\"  \"I want to be a sailor, sir,\" I answered, promptly; for such had been the earnest desire of my life; \"I wish to go to some of the places the ships I see passing up and down the river visit.\"  \"You are too young yet to go to sea, but when you are old enough you cannot perhaps do better.  The sea requires people of sense more than any other, and yet some persons send the dunce of the family on board ship, and then are surprised that he does not get on.  You shall now go back to the friends who have taken care of you, and who seem good people.  We must find somebody to whom you may go when you wish to get some more learning, and I dare say you will find some means of earning your bread till you are old enough to go to sea.  \"By-the-by, I must not forget the reward I promised you for finding my ring.  I will bring it down to you to-morrow or next day, if you will in the meantime trust me.\"  He said this smiling, and I felt sure he would not deceive me.  At the same time I told him that he had paid me before handsomely, and that I did not want any other reward.  He told me that must rest with him, and that I was fairly entitled to it.  He then bade me good-bye.  With a joyful heart I returned home to record to my friends all that had happened.  Mr Wells was as good as his word, and the following day I saw him on horseback, inquiring his way to the street where I lived.  I went up to him, and led him to the house.  He then dismounted, and giving his horse to another boy to hold, he called me in, and told my friends that he had spoken to the curate of the parish about me, and that I might go to him two hours every evening after I had done my work.  He then gave me five pounds, advising me to rig myself out neatly; and he told me besides that he had spoken to some of the boatmen in the neighbourhood, who he thought were very likely to employ me if I applied to them.  After a few more words of advice the good gentleman took his departure.  Now Mr Wells was a "]]]
