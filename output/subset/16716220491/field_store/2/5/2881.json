You set me thinking and asking myself questions about why not, and all that sort of rubbish.  Why, sir, for the first time since our acquaintance began, you have been playing the tempter, and nearly won, what with your litters and palanquins and ponies.  No, sir; it's impossible.\"  \"I say, Mark,\" said Dean, in a loud whisper, \"didn't uncle once say that there was hardly such a word as impossible for a man or boy with a will?\"  \"Silence, sir!\" cried Sir James angrily.  \"I say, dad,\" said Mark, closing up to his father's chair and leaning upon his shoulder, \"I said I wouldn't go unless you did.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" cried his father fiercely, \"and if you dare to let me hear you utter such insubordinate words again I'll--\"  The boy leaned over to look him full in the eyes, and gazed at him firmly, and the others saw him move his lips in a slow, deliberate way as if he were saying something emphatically; and then he drew himself up and seemed to intensify his gaze.  \"Well, baby,\" cried Sir James, \"what do you mean by those dumb motions? Speak out.\"  Mark shook his head and tightened his lips, compressing them into a long line across the bottom of his face, the curve disappearing and a couple of dot-like dimples forming at either end.  \"What do you mean by that, sir?\" cried Sir James.  \"Tell me what you mean?\"  The boy shook his head once more, and then the line disappeared, the curves came back, and he silently shaped the words as before.  \"Do you want to aggravate me, sir?  Such foolery!  Speak out, sir, at once.\"  Mark drew back, walked sharply across the room and half opened the door, before turning to face his father again, the others gazing at him in wonder.  \"What's come to him, doctor?\" cried Sir James.  \"Here, Mark, I command you, sir: speak out!\"  \"If you don't come with us, father,\" said the boy, slowly and deliberately--\"oh, Dean, I am sorry for you--there will be no expedition, for I won't go.\"  There was a moment or two's silence, and then Sir James raged out, \"Well, of all the daring--here, doctor, is this the result of your moral teaching of my boys?  Now, sir, frankly, what am I to do in a case like this?\"  The doctor was silent for a moment or two.  Then after drawing a deep breath he turned to Sir James.  \"You want my advice, sir, as frankly as I can give it, between man and man?\"  \"Of course I do, sir,\" snapped out Sir James.  \"Well, sir, my advice is this.  Dismiss us now.\"  \"What for--to conspire against me?\"  \"No, sir,\" said the doctor, rising; \"to give you time to calmly and dispassionately weigh this matter over--I even go so far as to say, to sleep on it.\"  \"No, I can decide now.  You don't want me with you.\"  It is a curious fact, but three voices at the same moment gave vent to the same ejaculation, which blended together and formed one big round \"O!\"  \"I should be an encumbrance upon you.\"  \"You would be a great help and counsel to me, Sir James, and of course take all the responsibility off my shoulders.\"  \"Humph!  Yes.  Well, that's true,\" said Sir James.  \"But you, Dean--now, sir, be honest--I want the simple truth.\"  \"I always do tell the truth, uncle,\" said the boy, rather surlily; \"at least, I always try to.\"  \"Then let's have it out now, sir, without a shadow of a doubt.  Let there be no trying.  Wouldn't you rather that I stayed at home?\"  \"No, uncle,\" came sharply, and almost before the question was uttered.  \"Now you, Mark,\" cried Sir James.  There was silence again for what seemed a minute, but probably was not half.  \"Well, sir, I'm waiting.\"  There was another pause, and then as the baronet jerked himself forward in his chair, gazing at his son fiercely as if to drag a reply from his lips, the boy seemed to swallow something, and, as Dean afterwards said to his cousin when talking the matter over, \"I could see it go down your throat just as if you were a big bull calf gulping down the cud.\"  \"I can't help it, father; something seems to make me say it: I won't go unless you come too.\"  Sir James sank back in his chair, fixing his eyes first upon the doctor, then upon Dean, and lastly upon his son, and it was quite a minute now before he opened his lips to emit a long pent up breath.  Then he said, \"I must give in, doctor; I'm beaten.\"  \"And you will come too, father?\" cried Mark, and his utterance was full of joyous excitement.  \"Yes, my boy; I'll come.\"    CHAPTER THREE.  FITS OF TEMPER.  \"Don't go to sleep, Dozey.\"  \"Who's going to sleep?\"  \"Your eyes were nearly shut.\"  \"Well, who's to keep them open in this glaring sun?\" cried Dean, half angrily.  \"Well, don't jump down a fellow's throat.\"  \"It's enough to make one.  I just put my eyes half to, because there's no shade, and you begin at me directly because once or twice I wouldn't keep awake to listen to your prosing about something or another after we had gone to bed, and I did not want to hear.\"  \"I beg pardon,\" cried Mark, with mock politeness.  \"Don't!\" cried Dean pettishly.  \"Now then, what was it you wanted to say?\"  \"Well, I was going to say, what do you think of it now we have got here?\"  \"Not much; and if it's going to be all like this I shall soon be wishing we had stayed at home.\"  \"Same here.  I say, what a lot of gammon they do write in books!  I always thought Africa was quite a grand country; very hot--\"  \"Oh, it's hot enough,\" said Dean sharply.  \"Yes, it's hot enough to make everyone seem lazy.  Look at those black fellows there, fast asleep in the sun with their mouths open and the flies buzzing about.  But I say, I don't think much of these soldiers.  What little under-sized fellows!\"  \"Haven't done growing, perhaps,\" said Dean.  \"Oh, yes; they are old 'uns.  But they do look like sunburnt boys.  But I say, I expected something very different from this.  What stuff people do write in books!  I mean to say it's too bad.\"  \"Yes; just over a month since we started from Southampton, and here we are dropped in this miserable place along with all our luggage and boxes, and been caged up in that hotel.  Do you know what I felt when I first looked ashore?\"  \"No, but I know what I did--as if I should have liked to tell uncle that we had better stop aboard the steamer, for I was sure we had made a mistake and come to the wrong place.\"  \"No, no, I say, play fair; that's what I felt,\" said Mark.  \"You felt?  You couldn't, because that's what I felt.\"  \"Well, I could, for I did feel it exactly.  I say, though; where are Bob and Pretty Dance?\"  \"Pretty Dance,\" said Dean dreamily.  \"Yes, we have been in a pretty dance, and no mistake.  I don't know where they are.  Wandering about somewhere having a look at what shipping there is, for there isn't much to see in the town.\"  \"I say, I hope those two fellows are keeping an eye on the cases.  It would be a nice job if someone opened our luggage and got at the guns.\"  \"Oh, the landlord said that would be all right.  Phew!  It is hot! Here, let's go and talk to the doctor.\"  \"No, don't disturb him; he's lying down and having a nap.  Let's go and talk to uncle.\"  \"He's gone to lie down and have a nap too.\"  \"Bother!  I thought as soon as we got ashore it was all going to be interesting and beautiful, and that we should be having glorious adventures.  I don't know how we are going to get through it.\"  \"Get through what?\"  \"Those three days before we can start up the country.\"  \"Oh, there they are,\" said Dean sharply.  \"Who?\"  \"Our two keepers.\"  \"Let's go and talk to them, then.  Poor old Bacon.  If it's going to be like this Bob will be frizzled.\"  \"Well, don't walk so fast.  I say, it must be hot.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because I feel as if I had got too many clothes on.\"  \"Ah, it will be hotter than this; but it's the only thing that makes me think we are in a foreign country.  Here, who's this?  Why, it's that sailor again.\"  \"Yes,\" said Dean.  \"What does he want?  He was following us about all day yesterday when we were trying to look at the town.\"  \"What does he want?  Coppers, of course.  He's a beggar.\"  \"Well, he doesn't look like one.  No, that isn't it.  He's got a boat somewhere, and wants to take us up the river for a row.  Shall we go?\"  \"No; it's too hot.  Think we could buy an umbrella somewhere?\"  \"What for?  It looks as if it had not rained here for a twelvemonth.\"  \"Keep the sun off.\"  \"Oh, I see.  Come along, then, till we get to those stores, and we can buy one there, I daresay; but I shan't walk with you if you put it up. Bother you and your umbrella!  Are you afraid you'll melt?\"  \"I am melting.\"  As Dean spoke very surlily, \"that sailor,\" as Mark called him, a little stumpy fellow who looked as though he should have been plump and rosy, but who was ghastly pale instead, sauntered up slowly, looking very hard at Mark, and opened his lips as if to say something, but closed them again as if with an effort.  He was dressed in a sailor's canvas frock and loose trousers, both of which articles of attire were old and shabby but scrupulously clean, while his hat, a very old straw, showed an ugly rent which its owner had apparently tried to hide by means of the silken band just above its brim.  But the band had slipped upwards so that a good-sized patch of crisp, curly, black hair had escaped and thrust its way out into the sun.  As the man came abreast, he opened his lips and closed them twice before passing on, and in the sultry stillness of the sleepy place they heard him give a faint sigh.  \"Doesn't look much like a beggar,\" said Dean.  \"He's had a fever, or something.\"  \"Well, I shouldn't like to have a fever here,\" said Mark.  \"I don't mean to be ill.  If I am it's because I have come to a place where there's nothing to do and nothing to see.  Oh, I am disappointed!  Here he comes back again.  He must be a beggar, and he's ashamed to ask us to give him something.  No, it can't be that.  For foreign beggars are not ashamed to beg.  I shall ask him if he has been ill.\"  \"No, don't.  He mightn't like it,\" said Dean.  \"Then he will have to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23929"],["title","Revolution (#1)"],["body"," memo to introduce you to this new item. We call it a Tracy.\"  Paul frowned at the wristwatch, fingered it a moment, held it to his ear. It ticked and the second hand moved. \"Tracy?\" he said.  Stevens said, \"After Dick Tracy. Remember, a few years ago? His wrist two-way radio.\"  \"But this is really a watch,\" Paul said.  \"Sure. Keeps fairly good time, too. However, that's camouflage. It's also a two-way radio. Tight beam from wherever you are to the Chief.\"  Paul pursed his lips. \"The transistor boys are really doing it up brown.\" He handed the watch back to Derek Stevens. \"Show me how it works, Derek.\"  They spent fifteen minutes on the communications device, then Derek Stevens said, \"Here's another item the Chief thought you might want to see:\"  It was a compact, short-muzzled hand gun. Paul handled it with the ease of long practice. \"The grip's clumsy. What's its advantage? I don't particularly like an automatic.\"  Derek Stevens motioned with his head. \"Come into the firing range, Koslov, and we'll give you a demonstration.\"  Paul shot him a glance from the side of his eyes, then nodded. \"Lead on.\"  In the range, Stevens had a man-size silhouette put up. He stood to one side and said, \"O.K., let her go.\"  Paul stood easily, left hand in pants pocket, brought the gun up and tightened on the trigger. He frowned and pressed again.  He scowled at Derek Stevens. \"It's not loaded.\"  Stevens grunted amusement. \"Look at the target. First time you got it right over the heart.\"  \"I'll be ...,\" Paul began. He looked down at the weapon in surprise. \"Noiseless and recoilless. What caliber is it, Derek, and what's the muzzle velocity?\"  \"We call it the .38 Noiseless,\" Stevens said. \"It has the punch of that .44 Magnum you're presently carrying.\"  With a fluid motion Paul Koslov produced the .44 Magnum from the holster under his left shoulder and tossed it to one side. \"That's the last time I tote that cannon,\" he said. He balanced the new gun in his hand in admiration. \"Have the front sight taken off for me, Derek, and the fore part of the trigger guard. I need a quick draw gun.\" He added absently, \"How did you know I carried a .44?\"  Stevens said, \"You're rather famous, Koslov. The Colonel Lawrence of the Cold War. The journalists are kept from getting very much about you, but what they do learn they spread around.\"  Paul Koslov said flatly, \"Why don't you like me, Stevens? In this game I don't appreciate people on our team who don't like me. It's dangerous.\"  Derek Stevens flushed. \"I didn't say I didn't like you.\"  \"You didn't have to.\"  \"It's nothing personal,\" Stevens said.  Paul Koslov looked at him.  Stevens said, \"I don't approve of Americans committing political assassinations.\"  Paul Koslov grinned wolfishly and without humor. \"You'll have a hard time proving that even our cloak and dagger department has ever authorized assassination, Stevens. By the way, I'm not an American.\"  Derek Stevens was not the type of man whose jaw dropped, but he blinked. \"Then what are you?\"  \"A Russian,\" Paul snapped. \"And look, Stevens, we're busy now, but when you've got some time to do a little thinking, consider the ethics of warfare.\"  Stevens was flushed again at the tone. \"Ethics of warfare?\"  \"There aren't any,\" Paul Koslov snapped. \"There hasn't been chivalry in war for a long time, and there probably never will be again. Neither side can afford it. And I'm talking about cold war as well as hot.\" He scowled at the other. \"Or did you labor under the illusion that only the Commies had tough operators on their side?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Paul Koslov crossed the Atlantic in a supersonic TU-180 operated by Europa Airways. That in itself galled him. It was bad enough that the Commies had stolen a march on the West with the first jet liner to go into mass production, the TU-104 back in 1957. By the time the United States brought out its first really practical trans-Atlantic jets in 1959 the Russians had come up with the TU-114 which its designer, old Andrei Tupolev named the largest, most efficient and economical aircraft flying.  In civil aircraft they had got ahead and stayed ahead. Subsidized beyond anything the West could or at least would manage, the air lines of the world couldn't afford to operate the slower, smaller and more expensive Western models. One by one, first the neutrals such as India, and then even members of the Western bloc began equipping their air lines with Russian craft.  Paul grunted his disgust at the memory of the strong measures that had to be taken by the government to prevent even some of the American lines from buying Soviet craft at the unbelievably low prices they offered them.         *       *       *       *       *  In London he presented a card on which he had added a numbered code in pencil. Handed it over a desk to the British intelligence major.  \"I believe I'm expected,\" Paul said.  The major looked at him, then down at the card. \"Just a moment, Mr. Smith. I'll see if his lordship is available. Won't you take a chair?\" He left the room.  Paul Koslov strolled over to the window and looked out on the moving lines of pedestrians below. He had first been in London some thirty years ago. So far as he could remember, there were no noticeable changes with the exception of automobile design. He wondered vaguely how long it took to make a noticeable change in the London street scene.  The major re-entered the room with a new expression of respect on his face. \"His lordship will see you immediately, Mr. Smith.\"  \"Thanks,\" Paul said. He entered the inner office.  Lord Carrol was attired in civilian clothes which somehow failed to disguise a military quality in his appearance. He indicated a chair next to his desk. \"We've been instructed to give you every assistance Mr. ... Smith. Frankly, I can't imagine of just what this could consist.\"  Paul said, as he adjusted himself in the chair, \"I'm going into the Soviet Union on an important assignment. I'll need as large a team at my disposal as we can manage. You have agents in Russia, of course?\" He lifted his eyebrows.  His lordship cleared his throat and his voice went even stiffer. \"All major military nations have a certain number of espionage operatives in each other's countries. No matter how peaceful the times, this is standard procedure.\"  \"And these are hardly peaceful times,\" Paul said dryly. \"I'll want a complete list of your Soviet based agents and the necessary information on how to contact them.\"  Lord Carrol stared at him. Finally sputtered, \"Man, _why_? You're not even a British national. This is--\"  Paul, held up a hand. \"We're co-operating with the Russian underground. Co-operating isn't quite strong enough a word. We're going to _push_ them into activity if we can.\"  The British intelligence head looked down at the card before him. \"Mr. Smith,\" he read. He looked up. \"John Smith, I assume.\"  Paul said, still dryly, \"Is there any other?\"  Lord Carrol said, \"See here, you're really Paul Koslov, aren't you?\"  Paul looked at him, said nothing.  Lord Carrol said impatiently, \"What you ask is impossible. Our operatives all have their own assignments, their own work. Why do you need them?\"  \"This is the biggest job ever, overthrowing the Soviet State. We need as many men as we can get on our team. Possibly I won't have to use them but, if I do, I want them available.\"  The Britisher rapped, \"You keep mentioning _our team_ but according to the dossier we carry on you, Mr. Koslov, you are neither British nor even a Yankee. And you ask me to turn over our complete Soviet machinery.\"  Paul came to his feet and leaned over the desk, there was a paleness immediately beneath his ears and along his jaw line. \"Listen,\" he said tightly, \"if I'm not on this team, there just is no team. Just a pretense of one. When there's a real team there has to be a certain spirit. A team spirit. I don't care if you're playing cricket, football or international cold war. If there's one thing that's important to me, that I've based my whole life upon, it's this, understand? _I've_ got team spirit. Perhaps no one else in the whole West has it, but _I_ do.\"  Inwardly, Lord Carrol was boiling. He snapped, \"You're neither British nor American. In other words, you are a mercenary. How do we know that the Russians won't offer you double or triple what the Yankees pay for your services?\"  Paul sat down again and looked at his watch. \"My time is limited,\" he said. \"I have to leave for Paris this afternoon and be in Bonn tomorrow. I don't care what opinions you might have in regard to my mercenary motives, Lord Carrol. I've just come from Downing Street. I suggest you make a phone call there. At the request of Washington, your government has given me carte blanche in this matter.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Paul flew into Moscow in an Aeroflot jet, landing at Vnukovo airport on the outskirts of the city. He entered as an American businessman, a camera importer who was also interested in doing a bit of tourist sightseeing. He was traveling deluxe category which entitled him to a Zil complete with chauffeur and an interpreter-guide when he had need of one. He was quartered in the Ukrayna, on Dorogomilovskaya Quai, a twenty-eight floor skyscraper with a thousand rooms.  It was Paul's first visit to Moscow but he wasn't particularly thrown off. He kept up with developments and was aware of the fact that as early as the late 1950s, the Russians had begun to lick the problems of ample food, clothing and finally shelter. Even those products once considered sheer luxuries were now in abundant supply. If material things alone had been all that counted, the Soviet man in the street wasn't doing so badly.  He spent the first several days getting the feel of the city and also making his preliminary business calls. He was interested in a new \"automated\" camera currently being touted by the Russians as the world's best. Fastest lens, foolproof operation,"]]]
