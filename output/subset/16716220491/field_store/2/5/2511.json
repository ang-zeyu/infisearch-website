Mary Louise fervently blessed the old lady for this idea and at once seated herself in the pavilion while she examined at leisure the scene spread out before her.  Trees hid all the neighboring residences but one. Just across the river and not far from its bank stood a small, weather-beaten cottage that was in sharp contrast with the rather imposing Kenton residence opposite. It was not well kept, nor even picturesque. The grounds were unattractive. A woodpile stood in the front yard; the steps leading to the little porch had rotted away and had been replaced by a plank-- rather unsafe unless one climbed it carefully, Mary Louise thought. There were time-worn shades to the windows, but no curtains. A pane of glass had been broken in the dormer window and replaced by a folded newspaper tacked over it. Beside the porch door stood a washtub on edge; a few scraggly looking chickens wandered through the yard; if not an abode of poverty it was surely a place where careless indifference to either beauty or the comfort of orderly living prevailed.  So much Mary Louise had observed, wondering why Mrs. Kenton had not bought the cottage and torn it down, since it was a blot on the surrounding landscape, when she saw the door open and a man come out. She gave a little gasp of astonishment as her eyes followed this man, who slowly took the path to the bridge, from whence the road led into the village.    CHAPTER III THE FOLKS ACROSS THE RIVER  Her first glance told the girl that here was a distinctly unusual personage. His very appearance was quaint enough to excite comment from a stranger. It must have been away back in the revolutionary days when men daily wore coats cut in this fashion, straight across the waist-line in front and with two long tails flapping behind. Modern \"dress coats\" were much like it, to be sure, but this was of a faded blue-bottle color and had brass buttons and a frayed velvet collar on it. His trousers were tight-fitting below the knee and he wore gaiters and a wide-brimmed silk hat that rivaled his own age and had doubtless seen happier days.  Mary Louise couldn't see all these details from her seat in the pavilion across the river, but she was near enough to observe the general effect of the old man's antiquated costume and it amazed her.  Yes, he was old, nearly as ancient as his apparel, the girl decided; but although he moved with slow deliberation his gait was not feeble, by any means. With hands clasped behind him and head slightly bowed, as if in meditation, he paced the length of the well-worn path, reached the bridge and disappeared down the road toward the village.  \"That,\" said a voice beside her, \"is the Pooh-Bah of Cragg's Crossing. It is old Cragg himself.\"  Gran'pa Jim was leaning against the outer breast of the pavilion, book in hand.  \"You startled me,\" she said, \"but no more than that queer old man did. Was the village named after him, Gran'pa?\"  \"I suppose so; or after his father, perhaps, for the place seems even older than old Cragg. He has an 'office' in a bare little room over the store, and I rented this place from him. Whatever his former fortunes may have been--and I imagine the Craggs once owned all the land about here--old Hezekiah seems reduced to a bare existence.\"  \"Perhaps,\" suggested Mary Louise, \"he inherited those clothes with the land, from his father. Isn't it an absurd costume, Gran'pa Jim? And in these days of advanced civilization, too! Of course old Hezekiah Cragg is not strong mentally or he would refuse to make a laughingstock of himself in that way.\"  Colonel Hathaway stared across the river for a time without answering. Then he said:  \"I do not think the natives here laugh at him, although I remember they called him 'Old Swallowtail' when I was directed to him as the only resident real estate agent. I found the old man quite shrewd in driving a bargain and thoroughly posted on all the affairs of the community. However, he is not a gossip, but inclined to be taciturn. There is a fathomless look in his eyes and he is cold and unresponsive. Country life breeds strange characteristics in some people. The whimsical dress and mannerisms of old Mr. Cragg would not be tolerated in the cities, while here they seem regarded with unconcern because they have become familiar. I was rather, pleased with his personality because he is the Cragg of Cragg's Crossing. How much of the original plot of land he still owns I don't know.\"  \"Why, he lives in that hovel!\" said the girl.  \"So it seems, although he may have been merely calling there.\"  \"He fits the place,\" she declared. \"It's old and worn and neglected, just as he and his clothes are. I'd be sorry, indeed, to discover that Mr. Cragg lives anywhere else.\"  The Colonel, his finger between the leaves of the book he held, to mark the place where he was reading, nodded somewhat absently and started to turn away. Then he paused to ask anxiously:  \"Does this place please you, my dear?\"  \"Ever so much, Gran'pa Jim!\" she replied with enthusiasm, leaning from her seat inside the pavilion to press a kiss upon his bare gray head. \"I've a sense of separation from all the world, yet it seems good to be hidden away in this forgotten nook. Perhaps I wouldn't like it for always, you know, but for a summer it is simply delightful. We can rest--and rest--and rest!--and be as cozy as can be.\"  Again the old gentleman nodded, smiling at the girl this time. They were good chums, these two, and what pleased one usually pleased the other.  Colonel Hathaway had endured a sad experience recently and his handsome old face still bore the marks of past mental suffering. His only daughter, Beatrice Burrows, who was the mother of Mary Louise, had been indirectly responsible for the Colonel's troubles, but her death had lifted the burden; her little orphaned girl, to whom no blame could be attached, was very dear to \"Gran'pa Jim's\" heart. Indeed, she was all he now had to love and care for and he continually planned to promote her happiness and to educate her to become a noble woman. Fortunately he had saved considerable money from the remains of an immense estate he had once possessed and so was able to do anything for his grandchild that he desired. In New York and elsewhere Colonel James Hathaway had a host of influential friends, but he was shy of meeting them since his late unpleasant experiences.  Mary Louise, for her part, was devotedly attached to her grandfather and preferred his society to that of any other person. As the erect form of the old gentleman sauntered away through the trees she looked after him affectionately and wagged her little head with hearty approval.  \"This is just the place for Gran'pa Jim,\" she mused. \"There's no one to bother him with questions or sympathy and he can live as quietly as he likes and read those stuffy old books--the very name 'classics' makes me shudder--to his heart's content. He'll grow stronger and happier here, I'm sure.\"  Then she turned anew to revel in the constantly shifting view of river and woodland that extended panoramically from her seat in the pavilion. As her eyes fell on the old cottage opposite she was surprised to see a dishpan sail through the open window, to fall with a clatter of broken dishes on the hard ground of the yard. A couple of dish-towels followed, and then a broom and a scrubbing-brush--all tossed out in an angry, energetic way that scattered them in every direction. Then on the porch appeared the form of a small girl, poorly dressed in a shabby gingham gown, who danced up and down for a moment as if mad with rage and then, observing the washtub, gave it a kick which sent it rolling off the porch to join the other utensils on the ground.  Next, the small girl looked around her as if seeking more inanimate things upon which to vent her anger, but finding none she dashed into the cottage and soon reappeared with a much-worn straw hat which she jammed on her flaxen head and then, with a determined air, walked down the plank and marched up the path toward the bridge--the same direction that old Cragg had taken a short time before.  Mary Louise gave a gasp of amazement. The scene had been dramatic and exciting while it lasted and it needed no explanation whatever. The child had plainly rebelled at enforced drudgery and was going--where?  Mary Louise sprang lightly from her seat and ran through the grounds to their entrance. When she got to the road she sped along until she came to the bridge, reaching one end of it just as the other girl started to cross from the opposite end. Then she stopped and in a moment the two met.  \"Where are you going?\" asked Mary Louise, laying a hand on the child's arm as she attempted to pass her.  \"None o' yer business,\" was the curt reply.  \"Oh, it is, indeed,\" said Mary Louise, panting a little from her run. \"I saw you throw things, a minute ago, so I guess you mean to run away.\"  The girl turned and stared at her.  \"I don't know ye,\" said she. \"Never saw ye before. Where'd ye come from anyway?\"  \"Why, my grandfather and I have taken the Kenton house for the summer, so we're to be your neighbors. Of course, you know, we must get acquainted.\"  \"Ye kin be neighbors to my Gran'dad, if ye like, but not to me. Not by a ginger cookie! I've done wi' this place fer good an' all, I hev, and if ye ever see me here ag'in my name ain't Ingua Scammel!\"  \"Here; let's sit down on the bridge and talk it over,\" proposed Mary Louise. \"There's plenty of time for you to run away, if you think you'd better. Is Mr. Cragg your grandfather, then?\"  \"Yes, Ol' Swallertail is. 'Ol' Humbug' is what _I_ calls him.\"  \"Not to his face, do you?\"  \"I ain't so foolish. He's got a grip on him like a lobster, an' when he's mad at me he grips my arm an' twists it till I holler. When Gran'dad's aroun' you bet I hev to knuckle down, er I gits the worst of it.\"  \"So he's cruel, is he?\"  \"U"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22226"],["title","The Whispering Spheres (#1)"],["body","again. He stepped over more glowing piles of ashes.  Then his ears caught a crescendo of the whispering that he had heard before. He looked behind him. In the doorway was an orange glow. The sphere was coming--looking for him!  Behind the forge was a machine which had been used to operate the crane. Beyond it was stygian darkness. He might hide there.  The captain slipped toward the machine. Every bit of electrical wiring on the controls had been fused.  The room grew lighter, the whispering louder and then, through the doorway, floated the dazzling sphere.  Something gripped Taylor's shoulder muscles. A mild electrical shock coursed through his body, as if an invisible feeler had passed over him.  The sphere halted, changed its direction and floated slowly toward the captain.  Instinctively, Taylor backed into the corner behind the machine. He dropped to his hands and knees and was free of the invisible feeler! Again the orange sphere halted, as if trying to relocate its victim.  Taylor rounded a pillar which supported the track for the crane. His fingers struck an accumulation of rubbish that had been tossed into the corner. He started to push it out of the way, when the floor beneath it moved. It was a trap door!  A gasp of surprise came from Taylor's lips. He had a chance. But the sound gave him away. The electrical feeler touched him again. The shock jerked at his muscles and the sphere started floating nearer.  The trap door swung back. Taylor's right boot touched the top rung of the ladder. He moved his left boot down to the next rung. Each movement seemed to take ages and every exertion of his muscles was agony as the electrical shock gripped him with increasing intensity.  He forced his body down into the opening. He saw the flame flickering over the surface of the sphere as the thing prepared to strike.  The sphere seemed to pulse briefly as he released his grasp on the rim of the opening and shoved himself downward into the hole. He dropped several feet.  Above him a brilliant flash of fire lit the opening.  The sphere itself hovered above the hole.     CHAPTER III  PRIMARY OBJECTIVES   The sphere pulsed again. But this time no flaming whip sprang from its surface. There was a single flash. For an instant Taylor caught a glimpse of bestial eyes, looking angrily at him from the center of the flash. Then there was nothing. He was in the darkness of a tunnel. Even the charred embers of the wooden trap door above him seemed dimmed by a cloud of dust.  The sphere had simply exploded.  Taylor had no time to analyze the situation. His hands groped along the side of the tunnel, the one Norden had used to enter the plant on his spying expeditions. Taylor crawled slowly, feeling his way. It seemed eternity until at last he reached the end of the passage and felt the trap door overhead.  A minute later he rejoined the others, huddled in darkness outside the gate.  \"The searchlight went out,\" Masters explained. \"Something wrong with the power, I guess.\"  \"I know what it was,\" Taylor said gruffly. He turned to the disarmed sentry. \"Has anyone come out of here since the factory stopped working?\"  \"Nobody but him, sir,\" the soldier said, jerking his thumb at the sobbing man huddled against Norden. \"He said his name was Orkins--Jim Orkins. He works in the warehouse. But you can't tell anything about the rest o' what he says. He just babbles, sir. Something about livin' lightnin' and balls of fire. He ain't drunk, sir, so he must be crazy.\"  \"Help him get up,\" Taylor ordered. \"Masters, you take charge of Norden. We're going back to the car.\"  \"Excuse me, sir,\" the sentry said, hesitantly. \"But that's against orders. I can't leave. I'm to guard this gate, sir.\"  \"Your orders are canceled,\" the captain said.  \"If I desert my post, it's court martial,\" the sentry explained. \"How do I know you aren't a spy? Captains don't go around making privates break the orders of the day. If you've got business in the plant, why was I told to keep _everyone_ out? Why didn't they tell me to pass Captain Taylor? I got a duty here and I'll do it if it kills me. So help me, sir. Sergeant o' the guard!\"  The echo of the sentry's bellow rattled against the bleak factory buildings. A sphere bobbed up through the hole in the roof. Orkins opened his mouth to scream, but Norden clapped his hand over the man's lips, choking him off.  \"Quiet!\" Taylor ordered hoarsely. He addressed the sentry: \"See that thing? It means death to you, to all of us if it finds us. The sergeant of the guard, probably all of the other sentries are dead. Every workman in the plant is dead. Somehow we were missed. The searchlight power went off before they found this post, I suppose. Now then, all of you follow Masters back to the car. I'll bring up the rear.\"  \"I won't leave,\" the sentry said, stubbornly.  Masters stepped forward and put his pistol against the soldier's back.  \"You'll go,\" he said. \"Maybe this ain't regulation, but neither are the spheres.\"  The stubby little secret service man pushed the soldier ahead of him. The sentry marched with his hands in the air.  Drawing his own pistol, Taylor turned to Norden.  \"Help Orkins to the car,\" he said.  Norden drew himself up stiffly.  \"Go ahead and shoot,\" he said. \"It'll save the firing squad some trouble.\"  Taylor took one step forward. Norden faced him unflinchingly. Taylor's hand shot out, caught Norden's coat and threw him after Masters.  \"Don't leave me alone!\" Orkins cried, crawling after Norden and clasping him about the legs. Norden kicked him aside.  \"Keep moving!\" Taylor ordered Norden, who had halted.  Norden did not move.  Taylor swung his fist. The blow connected and the officer caught the falling man, swung him over his shoulder, then turned to the cringing Orkins.  \"If you don't want to be left here alone, follow us,\" he said.  Orkins suddenly regained his ability to use his muscles.  Masters, watching over his shoulder, chuckled. There was a faint wink of one eye visible in the moonlight.  \"Kinda screwy, ain't he?\" he said, jerking his head in Orkins' direction.  \"I don't know that I blame him, much,\" Taylor said. \"Look at the plant.\"  Over the roof and the smokestacks floated the yellowish-red ball of fire. Another sphere was emerging from the hole in the roof.  \"What are they? A new kind of bomb?\" Masters asked.  \"Norden's bomb never had a chance. Compared with what actually happened in there, a bomb would have been a picnic. There's not a living person left in the whole place.\"  \"Not a--hold on there, Cap! Do you know how many were working?\"  \"They're all dead,\" Taylor said. Briefly he outlined what he had seen in the plant.  \"Norden, the blankety-blank!\" Masters swore. \"Shooting's too good for him.\"  \"This isn't connected with the war--at least not directly. It's something else, Masters. What, I don't know yet, but I'm beginning to think that it's something the human race has never met before. Those spheres have killed a couple of hundred workers with bolts of energy--\"  \"I'm no scientist, captain.\"  \"That's the best I can describe this force, Masters. I might call it heat-bolts, but it's probably partly electric and partly heat, not entirely either. You see, Masters, heat is energy, just like electricity and light. The energy these spheres shoot out is a mixture of energies. We can imagine a spark of electricity shooting out and striking a man like a bolt of lightning, but it's hard to visualize heat behaving that way.\"  \"Say, mister,\" the sentry interrupted, \"my arms are getting tired.\"  \"Okay, buddy,\" Masters replied. \"If I let you put your arms down, will you behave like a nice little boy?\"  \"I'll be a perfect angel,\" the sentry said, lowering his arms.  \"You'll be an angel if you aren't, too,\" Masters added.  \"What's your name, soldier?\" Taylor asked the sentry.  \"Private Pember, sir. Company A, 110th infantry--\"  \"All right, Private Pember, you can carry this fellow.\"  Taylor shifted the faintly stirring Norden to the shoulders of the soldier.  \"If it will make you feel any easier, Pember,\" the captain went on, \"I can assure you that exigencies demanded your removal from your post. Your life was in danger and you could do no good by remaining there. In fact, there was nothing left to guard. You can do more good for your country by coming with us.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Pember said. \"I guess you are right, captain.\"  \"You're a good soldier, Pember,\" Taylor went on. \"A situation like this is unique. It demands use of individual initiative, rather than blind obedience to orders. Do you understand?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Pember said, adjusting the burden on his shoulder.         *       *       *       *       *  They reached the car.  A dozen of the orange-red globes now floated above the plant. They were circling slowly, in widening arcs, toward the limits of the factory grounds.  \"Searching for human beings,\" Taylor decided, watching them.  Orkins clutched Taylor's coat tails.  \"They're coming out!\" he cried. \"There's hell to pay.\"  Taylor took Orkins' arm and forced him down on the running board of the car, where Norden already was coming out of his daze.  \"Keep quiet!\" Taylor ordered. \"They'll discover us.\"  \"They'll find us anyway!\" Orkins said, frantic with fear. He groaned loudly.  \"Okay. He asked for it,\" Masters said.  There was a splatting sound as Masters' fist landed. Masters made a face over a distasteful duty done and turned to Pember:  \"Put them both in the car.\" He indicated Norden. \"Here's handcuffs. Lock them together.\"  Taylor and Masters watched the circling spheres. Suddenly one darted down. From its pulsating body shot a flash of flame. A human scream rent the air.  \"It's the darnedest thing I ever saw,\" Masters said with a shudder. \"Those fireballs squirt heat-electricity out at a guy and roast him!\"  \"Yes,\" Taylor said with a nod, \"and that isn't all. Those spheres act as though they were alive. When that one went out above the opening of the tunnel, I thought I saw a pair of eyes.\""]]]
