One of the best of the first class was selected--the _Water Lily_, A1 on Lloyd's--and in it Annie, with her nurse, was sent to sea for the benefit of her health.  The parting was a somewhat important event in Mr Webster's life, for it convinced him, to his own surprise, that his power to love a human being was not yet utterly gone!  Annie's arms clasped convulsively round his neck at the moment of parting--her sobbing \"Good-bye, darling papa,\" had stirred depths which had lain unmoved almost from the days of early manhood.  But the memory of this passed away as soon as he turned again to gaze upon the loved countenance of his yellow mistress.  The voyage did Annie much good.  The short residence in Demerara, while the vessel was discharging cargo and reloading, wrought wonders, and a letter, forwarded by a ship that sailed a short time after their arrival in \"foreign parts,\" told Mr Webster that he might expect to see his daughter home again, sound and well, in a month or two at the farthest.  But, to return from this digression to the abode of Mr Webster's soul:--  Having looked at the portrait of his late wife's father for a moment and smiled, he glanced at the letter in his hand and frowned.  Not because he was displeased, but because the writing was cramped and difficult to read.  However, the merchant was accustomed to receive such letters from seafaring men on many subjects of interest; he therefore broke the seal and set himself patiently to decipher it.  Immediately his countenance became ghastly pale, then it flushed up and became pale again, while he coughed and gasped once or twice, and started up and sat down abruptly. In fact Mr Webster exhibited all the signs of having received a severe shock, and an eye-witness might have safely concluded that he had just read the news of some great mercantile loss.  So it was in one sense-- but that was not the ordinary sense.  The letter in question was in the handwriting of a fussy officious \"bumble\" friend of the wealthy man, who dwelt in the town of Covelly. It ran as follows:    \"My dear Sir,--I write in great haste, and in much perturbation,   having just heard from my servant of the wreck of your ship, the   _Water Lily_, in Covelly Bay.  She does not seem to be quite sure,   however, of the name, and says that the only man who has been rescued   is scarcely able to speak, so that I do sincerely hope my domestic,   who is a stupid old woman, may turn out to be mistaken.  I am on the   point of hasting down to the shore to ascertain the truth for myself,   but am obliged to write to you this brief and unsatisfactory account   of what I have heard, in order to save the post, which is just being   closed.  You shall hear from me again, of course, by the next mail.--I   remain, my dear sir, in much anxiety, your most obedient humble   servant,    \"JOSEPH DOWLER.\"  It chanced that at the moment the above letter was handed to the postmaster, and while the wax was being melted before the final sealing of the post-bag, a sailor lad, drenched to the skin and panting vehemently, dashed into the office.  \"Stop! stop!\" he cried, \"a letter--about the wreck--the _Water Lily_--to the owners--not too late, I hope?\"  \"No, no, just in time.  Here, in with it.  There, all right.  Now, Jim, off with 'ee.\"  The postman jumped on his vehicle, the whip cracked, and in another minute the Royal Mail was gone.  Thus it came to pass that two epistles reached Mr Webster that morning from Covelly.  But in the extreme agitation of his spirit, he did not observe the other letter which lay among the usual morning mass that still awaited examination.  After reading the letter twice, and turning it over with trembling hands, as if he wished there were more in it, he pronounced a deep malediction on his \"humble\" friend, and rang the bell for his confidential clerk, who was an unusually meek, mild, and middle-aged little man, with a bald head, a deprecatory expression of countenance, and a pen behind his ear.  \"Mr Grinder,\" said Mr Webster, putting strong constraint on himself, and pretending to be quite composed, \"a letter from Covelly informs me that it is feared the _Water Lily_ has been wrecked in--\"  \"The _Water Lily_, sir!\" exclaimed Grinder, starting as if he had received an electric shock.  \"I spoke audibly, did I not?\" said Mr Webster, turning with a sharp look on his confidential clerk.  \"Ye-es, sir, but, I--Miss An--\" The poor man could get no further, being of a timid, nervous temperament, and Mr Webster, paying no attention to his remark, was going on to say that he intended to go by the mail to Covelly without delay to ascertain the truth for himself, when he was interrupted by the confidential clerk who exclaimed in a burst of agitation--  \"There were _two_ letters, sir, from Covelly this morning--did you read--\"  He stopped, for already his employer had sought for, found, and torn open the second epistle, which was written in a fair, legible hand.  It ran thus:--    \"SIR,--My father, Captain Boyns, directs me to inform you that your   daughter, Miss Annie, has been saved from the wreck of your brig, the   _Water Lily_, which ran aground here this afternoon, and has become a   total wreck.  Your daughter's nurse and the crew have also been   rescued by our new lifeboat, which is a noble craft, and, with God's   blessing, will yet do good service on this coast.  I have pleasure in   adding, from myself, that it was my father who rescued your child.   She fell into the sea when being passed from the wreck into the boat,   and sank, but my father dived and brought her up in safety.    \"Much of the brig's cargo has been lost, I regret to say, but a good   deal of it has been washed ashore and saved in a damaged state.  The   captain says that defective compasses were the cause of the disaster.   There is not time to give you a more particular account, as it is   close upon post-time.  Miss Annie sends you her kindest love, and bids   me say she is none the worse of what she has passed through.--I am,   sir, your obedient servant,    \"HARRY BOYNS.\"  \"Thank God!\" exclaimed Mr Webster fervently.  \"Why, what are you staring at, Mr Grinder?\" he added, on observing that his confidential servant was gazing at him with an expression of considerable surprise.  \"Excuse me, sir,\" stammered the unfortunate man, \"I--I--in fact--you have so often told me that you did not believe in God that I fancied-- I--wondered--\"  \"Really, Mr Grinder, I must beg of you to confine your remarks in future entirely to matters of business.  The so-called religious observations which you sometimes venture to make in my presence are extremely distasteful, I assure you.  In explanation of what I said, however, I may tell you that this letter informs me of my daughter's safety, and I merely used the expression of satisfaction that is usual on such occasions.  The phrase, as it is generally understood (except by weak men), commits me to nothing more.  But enough of this.  I find that the _Water Lily_ has indeed been lost.  It was fully insured, I believe?\"  \"Yes, sir, it was.\"  \"Very well; report the matter without delay.  I will go to Covelly to-night, and shall probably be back to-morrow.\"  Saying this, Mr Webster left the office, and, on the evening of that day, found himself seated in Captain Boyns's parlour, with little Annie on his knee.  Her pretty head was on his shoulder, her fair curls straggled over his chest, and her round little arms tightly encircled his large body as far as they could reach, while she sobbed on his bosom and kissed him by turns.  This was quite a new experience in the life of the gold-lover.  He had declined to submit to familiar caresses in former years, but on such an occasion as the present, he felt that common propriety demanded the sacrifice of himself to some extent.  He therefore allowed Annie to kiss him, and found the operation--performed as she did it--much more bearable than he had anticipated; and when Annie exclaimed with a burst of enthusiasm, \"Oh, dear, dear papa, I did feel such a dreadful longing for you when the waves were roaring round us!\" and gave him another squeeze, he felt that the market price of the bundle of goods on his knee was rising rapidly.  \"Did you think you were going to be drowned, dear?\" said Mr Webster with the air of a man who does not know very well what to say.  \"I'm not sure what I thought,\" replied Annie smiling through her tears. \"Oh, I was so frightened!  You can't think, papa, how very dreadful it is to see the water boiling all round, and sometimes over you; and such awful thumping of the ship, and then the masts breaking; but what I feared most was to see the faces of the sailors, they were so white, and they looked as if they were afraid.  Are men ever afraid, papa?\"  \"Sometimes, Annie; but a white face is not always the sign of fear--that may be caused by anxiety.  Did any of them refuse to obey orders?\"  \"No; they were very obedient.\"  \"Did any of them get into the lifeboat before you and nurse!\"  \"Oh, no; they all refused to move till we were put into it, and some of them ran to help us, and were very very kind?\"  \"Then you may be quite sure they were not afraid, however pale their faces were; but what of yourself, Annie--were you afraid?\"  \"Oh, dreadfully, and so was poor nurse; but once or twice I thought of the text that--that--you know who was so fond of,--`Call upon me in the time of trouble and I will deliver thee,' so I prayed and felt a little better.  Then the lifeboat came, and, oh! how my heart did jump, for it seemed just like an answer to my prayer.  I never felt any more fear after that, except when I fell into the sea; but even then I was not so frightened as I had been, for I felt somehow that I was sure to be saved, and I was right, you see, for dear Captain Boyns dived for me.  I love Captain Boyns!\" cried Annie, and here again she kissed her father and held him so tight"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23388"],["title","Wrecked but not Ruined (#1)"],["body","the Canadian, as he emerged from the snow with eyes, ears, and nostrils stuffed full; \"no--not quite!\"  Satisfying himself that no bones were broken, he turned abruptly to look for his companion, whose motionless legs sticking out of the drift were the only visible portions of his body.  Anxiously and swiftly did Francois drag his master out, and great was his relief when poor Redding looked at him with a bewildered gaze and demanded to know what had happened!  \"Oh!  I see, capsized,\" he said, rising and pressing his hand to his brow, \"I believe I must have hit my head against a stump, for I've been slightly stunned.  However, `all's well that ends well.'  Not hurt, Francois?\"  \"No, Monsieur,--not fatever.\"  \"That's right, lend a hand to lift the sleigh--hoop! there--jump in.\"  Le Rue obeyed.  The bear-rug was replaced around them, and the pony, which had stood as quiet as a lamb during the accident, started forward again.  \"Voila! von light,\" exclaimed the Canadian.  At that moment they had rounded the corner of a high cliff, and come into view of Boulder Creek.  There was just light enough to make the chaotic grandeur of the place visible in a ghostly degree.  Great boulders and masses of rock, which had fallen from the neighbouring mountains and cliffs, lay piled about in the creek or gully in wildest confusion.  Some of these masses were as large as a small hut, but they were of all sizes as well as shapes.  It was a weird scene, and forbidding; nevertheless some human being had seen fit to take up his abode there, as was made apparent by the light referred to by Le Rue.  Picking their way carefully among the boulders, the travellers at last reached a log-hut which was so small, weather-worn, and grey, that, from a short distance, it might have easily been mistaken, even in daylight, for one of the rocks by which it was surrounded.  The door stood wide open, and through it streamed the light of a roaring fire of wood.  So powerful was the contrast between the ruddy light and the cold grey scene without, that to the approaching travellers it appeared as if the whole interior of the hut glowed with fervent heat.  In the small doorway stood the figure of a man who was so large as almost to fill up the entrance, and so black, by contrast with the glowing background, that neither feature nor form was distinguishable save his sharp outline.  The outline, however, was a remarkably telling one.  It told of a broad chest and square shoulders, of massive limbs, and an easy air, and a sturdy attitude, and suggested difficulty in the way of entering that hut without leave asked and obtained.  \"Hallo!\" exclaimed the outline, in a voice so deep that it must have been unfathomable.  \"How d'ee do, Bellew?\" cried Reginald Redding, as he drove into the stream of light, pulled up, and sprang from the sleigh.  \"Hearty, sir, hearty, thank 'ee,\" replied the outline, advancing and becoming a little more visible on the surface as he did so.  \"Hallo!  Le Rue, how are 'ee?  Glad to see you both.  Step in.  A good fire on a coldish night is cheery--ain't it, Mister Redding?\"  \"Indeed it is, Bellew, especially when the night happens to be also darkish.\"  \"Ha! oui,\" interposed Le Rue, bustling into the hut with the bear-rug, \"it vas so darkish dat ve capsize under de cliff an' a'most knock de whole affair to smattoms--sleigh, cheval, an' peepil.\"  \"I'm glad to see that the `peepil' is all right, however,\" said Bellew, glancing at his visitors with what may be called a grave smile; \"it might have bin worse, for that's an ugly corner under the cliff, an' needs careful drivin' even in daylight.\"  \"I've not come off quite scatheless, however,\" said Redding, rubbing the top of his head tenderly, \"for here is a bump that would perplex the whole college of phrenologists.\"  \"Skin broke, sir?\" asked Bellew, advancing and examining the part.  \"No, all right.  A good supper will be the best cure for it.  If I was a phrenologist now, I'd name it the bump of top-heaviness.  Sit down, sir; sit down, Le Rue, an' look after my kettle while I see to your nag.\"  So saying, their host went out and left his unexpected, but evidently welcome, guests to make themselves comfortable.  Although Jonas Bellew was a recluse, he was by no means an ascetic.  He was marked by deep gravity of countenance coupled with a kindly humorous disposition.  No one knew where he came from, or why he had taken up his abode in such a lonely spot.  Many of the rough fellows who hang on the outskirts of the wilderness had tried as they said, to \"pump\" him on these points, but Jonas was either a dry well or a deep one, for pumping brought forth nothing.  He gained a livelihood by shooting, fishing, trapping wild animals for their skins, and, sometimes, by doing what he called \"odd jobs\" in the settlements.  \"Your home appears to me to grow wilder every time I see it,\" said Redding, as Bellew re-entered the hut, and busied himself in spreading on a rough deal table the materials of a plain but substantial meal.  \"That seems to be the idea of most men who come here,\" replied the trapper, \"but it's not many that favour me with a visit.\"  \"Ha! vraiment, dat must be true,\" interposed the Canadian, \"for no body vill com' here 'xcept them as do want hims legs broke.\"  \"Well, I have seen a few damaged shins and broken heads since I came to this location,\" said Jonas, \"but such accidents occur chiefly among the Canadian French, who seem on the whole to be a clumsy set.\"  \"Not von half so clumsy as de Engleesh, or Irish, or Scosh,\" retorted Le Rue.  \"Perhaps you're right, an' mayhap you're wrong, lad, anyway here is supper.  The Frenchmen are always good at their victuals, so sit in an' go to work.  Take the keg, Mister Redding.  I've not found time yet to make chairs, but it's wonderful how well a man gets along without such luxuries.\"  \"Especially when a man sits down to a venison-steak like this,\" said the fur-trader, taking the offered seat, while his man sat down on a block of wood set on end, and prepared to prove the truth of the trapper's assertion in regard to French capacity for food.  \"'Taint venison,\" said Bellew, assisting his companions to the meat in question, \"it's bear.\"  \"Indeed? and not bad food for a hungry man,\" returned Redding, as he began supper.  \"Where got you him?\"  \"Down near Jenkins Creek, where the McLeods are setting up their saw-mill.\"  \"The McLeods!\" exclaimed Redding, looking up suddenly, \"have you seen the McLeods?\"  \"Ay, I've bin helpin' them a bit wi' the mill.  Goin' down again to-morrow.  If this weather holds, the ice must give way soon, and then we'll be able to push ahead faster.\"  The trapper said this quietly, and without looking up from the bear-steak with which he was busy, so that Redding's look of surprise appeared to be lost on him.  The fur-trader and his man exchanged glances.  For a few minutes the process of mastication completely engrossed the trio, but the thoughts of the fur-trader were busy, for he was disappointed to find that one whom he respected so much as Jonas Bellew should thus coolly state that he was aiding the interlopers.  Presently he laid down his knife and fork, and said:--  \"Are you aware, Bellew, that these McLeods have settled themselves on the Company's reserve lands?\"  \"No, sir, I wasn't aware of it.\"  \"Well, then, I now tell you that they have,\" said Redding, who, unfortunately for himself and others, possessed an easily-roused spirit and was apt to become irascible when the rights--real or supposed--of the Company which he represented appeared in danger of violation.  \"At least,\" he continued, in a less positive tone, \"I have reason to believe that such is the case, and I am now on my way to--\"  He paused abruptly, feeling the impropriety of revealing his plans to one who, although a quiet and sensible man, and not given to talk too much, was, nevertheless, by his own admission, an aider and abettor of the enemy.  \"Whereabouts is the boundary line?\" asked Bellew, after a short silence.  \"At Jenkins Creek--_that_ creek is the boundary,\" answered the fur-trader.  \"On which side of the creek have they begun to build the mill?\"  \"They haven't begun yet, sir, but I believe they intend to commence on the south side.\"  \"So far well,\" replied Redding, \"but if I find that they have raised a stone or planted a stake on the _north_ side of the creek, I'll--\"  Here feeling that he was about to give way to a boastful spirit, he got himself out of the difficulty of having to finish the sentence by making a sudden and somewhat stern demand for \"more bear-steak.\"  \"Vid pleasieur, Monsieur,\" said Le Rue, placing a huge slice on his master's plate.  \"Well, sir, I hope you'll find that they haven't overstepped the boundary,\" said Bellew, \"because the McLeods look as if they'd be troublesome customers to deal with.\"  The fur-trader made no reply.  He felt indignant at the bare idea of his being checked in doing his duty by any man, or men, who were \"troublesome,\" by which expression he understood Bellew to mean that they were resolute and physically powerful in opposition; he therefore thought it best to avoid any further tendency to boast by holding his tongue.  Not so his volatile retainer, who stuck his fork into a lump of meat vindictively, as if it had been the body of a McLeod, and exclaimed:--  \"Hah! vat you say? troblesom, eh? who care for dat?  If de Macklodds do touche, by von small hinch, de lands of de Companie--ve vill--hah!\"  Another stab of the fork was all that the savage Le Rue vouchsafed as an explanation of his intentions.  In this frame of mind Reginald Redding and his man started off next morning on foot at an early hour, slept that night at a place called Sam's hut, and, the following evening, drew near to the end of their journey.
