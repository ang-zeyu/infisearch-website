Those few words of his sowed a crop of prejudice among the boys against Harry.  \"Campbell's been caught cribbing off Egerton,\" was what rose to the mind and lips of all; and a sort of sympathy grew up in favour of the true culprit, because it appeared that he had been the sufferer.  Naturally enough, there was a slight commotion in the room, and this gave Egerton ample opportunity to hide his book by sitting on it, or--but we must not anticipate.  Soon after, Harry finished his paper, folded it, and walked to Mr Prichard's desk; in his hurry, leaving his own open at the time.  As he handed in his work he said, stammering: \"I wasn't looking at Egerton's paper, sir; indeed I wasn't,\" and then blushed crimson.  Mr Prichard said nothing, but looked very hard at him, and this made Harry blush the more.  Then he went back to his desk (which he never noticed was now closed), locked it, and sat quietly till the class was dismissed; and shortly after was running home to his mother.     CHAPTER V.  MOTHER AND SON.  Very miserable--Past hope--Mother and son--Breaking down--Resignation--\"It is well.\"   The doctor's carriage with the broken-winded pony was standing at the door of the farm.  Mrs Valentine had just come out, and was talking to the doctor's little boy, who sat holding the reins.  \"Hallo, Harry,\" he cried, \"home from school?\"  \"Hush, Master Bromley, don't make such a noise!\" interposed Mrs Valentine.  Without taking any notice of Master Bromley, Harry exclaimed nervously to Mrs Valentine--  \"Is mamma worse, Mrs Valentine?\"  \"Yes, dear,\" the good farmer's wife answered; \"you mustn't go in now. She's very bad, indeed.  Mr Bromley is with her.\"  So Harry ran into the orchard, and sitting down under a tree, felt very miserable.  His mamma was worse--was she really dying now?  The terrible examination--he remembered her words about his work, and going to Oxford.  What was he to do?  Was he to get leave from school, and give up the chance of getting the prize, and stay at home with mamma instead?  But wouldn't that vex her, and perhaps make her worse? Besides, what use could he be at home?  Ah! but if she were to die when he was away?  No, no; he could not go away and leave her.  He must stay with her now!  The examination was nothing!  Such were the thoughts that coursed through Harry's brain; for though only thirteen years old, he was, in point of mind, far beyond his years, not in his school work, but in his ideas and feelings on general subjects of every-day life; and the reason of this was his having had, for so long, his mother as his only companion.  Presently Mrs Valentine came out to him.  Her eyes were very red, for she had been crying.  \"You can come in now, Master Harry.\"  \"Mrs Valentine, is mamma dying?  What can I do?  She mustn't die. Can't Mr Bromley do anything for her?\" cried Harry.  \"No, dear boy.  Mr Bromley can't do anything for her, poor dear; nor any one else either, for the matter of that.  He can only make her easier for the time, like.\"  \"But will mamma die before papa comes home?\"  \"She may die very--very soon,\" sobbed Mrs Valentine.  By this time they were at the door, and Mrs Valentine left Harry to run quietly upstairs to his mother's room.  He found her in bed, looking fearfully white, saving two red hectic spots glowing in her wasted cheeks.  Her hands were dry and hot; and when she began to speak, a fit of coughing made utterance impossible.  Harry sat by the bedside, and burst out crying.  After a few minutes, Mrs Campbell said in a low voice, but so cheerfully--  \"Well, Harry dear, how did the examination go off?\"  \"It's not over, mamma; and, please, don't talk about that.  Are you really going to die, mamma?  Tell me, is it really true?\"  \"Yes, darling boy, I am really going away from you now, and soon, too--very soon.\"  \"What shall I do when you are gone, mamma?  How shall I----\" and here Harry fairly broke down; he could speak no more.  \"Don't cry, Harry; it makes me so sad.  Don't you know I am going to heaven, and there will be no pain there.  I shall not cough any more. You mustn't cry so.  Tell me about school; I like to hear it all.  I am not going to die to-day, darling boy.  We shall have a little longer together.  Tell me about the examination.\"  How Harry longed to pour his story out to her, of Egerton and Mr Prichard.  But he wouldn't do so now.  He would bear it by himself.  He had run home so quickly, meaning to tell her all, and knowing she would believe and pity him, and tell him what to do.  But how could he distress her now?  So he only answered very quietly--  \"I did the paper pretty well, mamma; I think; the examiner doesn't come for two or three days; but--but--you won't be here--then,\" and back came the memory of the fateful message, back came the fears at the thought that he would be alone in the world then.  \"How hot the room is,\" sighed Mrs Campbell.  \"It makes me feel so weak.\"  \"Ah! the air isn't like it was at Malta; is it, mamma?  You told me it was so cool and sweet there; didn't you, mamma?\"  \"Yes, dear boy; but those cool winds have made me like this.  It was sitting out, in the evenings there, that first gave me my cough.  But it was God's will,\" she said half to herself, \"and why should one look to second causes?\"  \"Go and have your dinner, Harry dear or you will be late for school,\" she said to him.  \"Must I go to school, mamma, and leave you?\"  \"Yes, dear,\" she answered, \"it is far better for you to go, as usual. They shall send for you if--if--  Go down now, dear,\" she added, falteringly.  And when Harry hesitatingly left the room, Mrs Campbell turned her face to the wall, and prayed to God, to guard the motherless child; to guard the toilers on the sea; and then she thought of her girlhood, of her bright, strong, healthy days; and then of her marriage in the ominous Scotch mists, of the sojourning at Malta, of the journeyings to and fro; and chiefly of her husband's love, and of her happy life; and from the depths of her heart she thanked God for it all, and confessed that it had indeed \"been well.\"     CHAPTER VI.  INJURED INNOCENCE.  A surprise--Public opinion--Questioned--Circumstantial evidence--Inexorable.   With a heavy heart Harry set out for school; but it was a walk of a mile, and his spirits were very elastic; so that by the time he had settled to his afternoon's work, all his old interest and excitement in the examination had returned.  Again the class sat writing in their corner-classroom, with busy fingers and hushed voices.  At half-past four Mr Prichard rose, contrary to his ordinary custom, to collect the papers.  Harry had just opened his desk hastily for some blotting paper, and as he took the piece from its wonted corner, what was his astonishment to see Egerton's crib lying there.  As he was making assurance doubly sure, that it really was the delectus-crib, he felt a hand on his shoulder, and starting suddenly, found Mr Prichard standing, looking over him into his desk.  \"Give me your paper, Campbell,\" said Mr Prichard; \"and that book!\" he added, sternly.  Harry's heart seemed to rise into his mouth.  He was too frightened to utter a word, but gave up the book immediately with his paper.  The whole affair had so astonished him that he scarcely knew whether he stood on his head or his heels.  \"Stay after school-prayers, Campbell,\" said Mr Prichard, as he passed on, collecting the papers as he went.  Shortly after, the whole class rose, and many were the murmurs, \"Sneak! cribber!\" that greeted Harry's burning ears as they all hurried along towards the big schoolroom.  Poor boy! he felt in a sad strait, for he well knew how hard it would be to clear himself.  However, the consciousness of his innocence gave him a brave heart.  His mother had always told him that, no matter what the consequences were, so long as his conscience told him he was in the right, it was all well; and that seeming misfortunes would but work to his final good.  Prayers over, Harry took up his position at Mr Prichard's desk.  It so happened no boys were kept in that evening, so the rest of the masters were soon gone; but somehow or other the room did not clear so speedily as usual.  Harry's class especially was among the lingerers.  The report had soon spread through the school.  And the boys (the younger ones chiefly), always glad of a row when not themselves concerned, stood peeping through the open doors.  \"Leave the room at once, all of you,\" shouted Mr Prichard, \"unless you want an imposition?\"  Waiting calmly and deliberately till the room was clear, and the doors shut, while Harry longed, and yet dreaded for him to begin, Mr Prichard turned and said--  \"Well, Campbell, what have you to say for yourself?  This morning, I catch you in the act of copying, or attempting to copy, from Egerton's paper; and, now, this afternoon, I find you with a book in your possession, which, you know, you have no business whatever to have.  I suppose this will account for the correctness of your work during the past half-year?  Do you feel very proud of your performance,\" he added, sneeringly, \"when none of it was your own labour or cleverness?\"  Meek-hearted Harry was in tears long before this oration was concluded; and the streaming face and crimson blushes only tended to confirm Mr Prichard's conviction of his guilt.  \"Please, sir, I wasn't copying off Egerton this morning,\" sobbed Harry; \"I wasn't copying off him; and it isn't my book.  It's--it's--it isn't mine, sir!\"  \"It isn't yours, sir?\" cried Mr Prichard, indignantly.  \"Have you the face to contradict me flatly, sir, and say the book does not belong to you?  Whose name is that?\" he cried, holding the delectus-translation, open at its fly-leaf, to Harry.  And there plain enough it was--_Harry Campbell_.  \"No, sir, no; it isn't mine,\" persisted Harry, through his tears.  \"It isn't mine.  I never saw it till this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22216"],["title","Project Mastodon (#1)"],["body"," the tree and stared across the land. It was a pretty place, he thought--the rolling ridges covered by vast grazing areas and small groves, the forest-covered, ten-mile river valley. And everywhere one looked, the grazing herds of mastodon, giant bison and wild horses, with the less gregarious fauna scattered hit and miss.  Old Buster, the troublesome mastodon, a lone bull which had been probably run out of a herd by a younger rival, stood at the edge of a grove a quarter-mile away. He had his head down and was curling and uncurling his trunk in an aimless sort of way while he teetered slowly in a lazy-crazy fashion by lifting first one foot and then another.  The old cuss was lonely, Cooper told himself. That was why he hung around like a homeless dog--except that he was too big and awkward to have much pet-appeal and, more than likely, his temper was unstable.  The afternoon sun was pleasantly warm and the air, it seemed to Cooper, was the freshest he had ever smelled. It was, altogether, a very pleasant place, an Indian-summer sort of land, ideal for a Sunday picnic or a camping trip.  The breeze was just enough to float out from its flagstaff before the tent the national banner of Mastodonia--a red rampant mastodon upon a field of green.  \"You know, Johnny,\" said Adams, \"there's one thing that worries me a lot. If we're going to base our claim on precedent, we may be way off base. The old explorers always claimed their discoveries for their nations or their king, never for themselves.\"  \"The principle was entirely different,\" Cooper told him. \"Nobody ever did anything for himself in those days. Everyone was always under someone else's protection. The explorers either were financed by their governments or were sponsored by them or operated under a royal charter or a patent. With us, it's different. Ours is a private enterprise. You dreamed up the time unit and built it. The three of us chipped in to buy the helicopter. We've paid all of our expenses out of our own pockets. We never got a dime from anyone. What we found is ours.\"  \"I hope you're right,\" said Adams uneasily.  Old Buster had moved out from the grove and was shuffling warily toward the camp. Adams picked up the rifle that lay across his knees.  \"Wait,\" said Cooper sharply. \"Maybe he's just bluffing. It would be a shame to plaster him; he's such a nice old guy.\"  Adams half raised the rifle.  \"I'll give him three steps more,\" he announced. \"I've had enough of him.\"  Suddenly a roar burst out of the air just above their heads. The two leaped to their feet.  \"It's Chuck!\" Cooper yelled. \"He's back!\"  The helicopter made a half-turn of the camp and came rapidly to Earth.  Trumpeting with terror, Old Buster was a dwindling dot far down the grassy ridge.     III   They built the nightly fires circling the camp to keep out the animals.  \"It'll be the death of me yet,\" said Adams wearily, \"cutting all this wood.\"  \"We have to get to work on that stockade,\" Cooper said. \"We've fooled around too long. Some night, fire or no fire, a herd of mastodon will come busting in here and if they ever hit the helicopter, we'll be dead ducks. It wouldn't take more than just five seconds to turn us into Robinson Crusoes of the Pleistocene.\"  \"Well, now that this recognition thing has petered out on us,\" said Adams, \"maybe we can get down to business.\"  \"Trouble is,\" Cooper answered, \"we spent about the last of our money on the chain saw to cut this wood and on Chuck's trip to Washington. To build a stockade, we need a tractor. We'd kill ourselves if we tried to rassle that many logs bare-handed.\"  \"Maybe we could catch some of those horses running around out there.\"  \"Have you ever broken a horse?\"  \"No, that's one thing I never tried.\"  \"Me, either. How about you, Chuck?\"  \"Not me,\" said the ex-ambassador extraordinary bluntly.  Cooper squatted down beside the coals of the cooking fire and twirled the spit. Upon the spit were three grouse and half a dozen quail. The huge coffee pot was sending out a nose-tingling aroma. Biscuits were baking in the reflector.  \"We've been here six weeks,\" he said, \"and we're still living in a tent and cooking on an open fire. We better get busy and get something done.\"  \"The stockade first,\" said Adams, \"and that means a tractor.\"  \"We could use the helicopter.\"  \"Do you want to take the chance? That's our getaway. Once something happens to it....\"  \"I guess not,\" Cooper admitted, gulping.  \"We could use some of that Point Four aid right now,\" commented Adams.  \"They threw me out,\" said Hudson. \"Everywhere I went, sooner or later they got around to throwing me out. They were real organized about it.\"  \"Well, we tried,\" Adams said.  \"And to top it off,\" added Hudson, \"I had to go and lose all that film and now we'll have to waste our time taking more of it. Personally, I don't ever want to let another saber-tooth get that close to me while I hold the camera.\"  \"You didn't have a thing to worry about,\" Adams objected. \"Johnny was right there behind you with the gun.\"  \"Yeah, with the muzzle about a foot from my head when he let go.\"  \"I stopped him, didn't I?\" demanded Cooper.  \"With his head right in my lap.\"  \"Maybe we won't have to take any more pictures,\" Adams suggested.  \"We'll have to,\" Cooper said. \"There are sportsmen up ahead who'd fork over ten thousand bucks easy for two weeks of hunting here. But before we could sell them on it, we'd have to show them movies. That scene with the saber-tooth would cinch it.\"  \"If it didn't scare them off,\" Hudson pointed out. \"The last few feet showed nothing but the inside of his throat.\"  Ex-ambassador Hudson looked unhappy. \"I don't like the whole setup. As soon as we bring someone in, the news is sure to leak. And once the word gets out, there'll be guys lying in ambush for us--maybe even nations--scheming to steal the know-how, legally or violently. That's what scares me the most about those films I lost. Someone will find them and they may guess what it's all about, but I'm hoping they either won't believe it or can't manage to trace us.\"  \"We could swear the hunting parties to secrecy,\" said Cooper.  \"How could a sportsman keep still about the mounted head of a saber-tooth or a record piece of ivory?\" And the same thing would apply to anyone we approached. Some university could raise dough to send a team of scientists back here and a movie company would cough up plenty to use this place as a location for a caveman epic. But it wouldn't be worth a thing to either of them if they couldn't tell about it.  \"Now if we could have gotten recognition as a nation, we'd have been all set. We could make our own laws and regulations and be able to enforce them. We could bring in settlers and establish trade. We could exploit our natural resources. It would all be legal and aboveboard. We could tell who we were and where we were and what we had to offer.\"  \"We aren't licked yet,\" said Adams. \"There's a lot that we can do. Those river hills are covered with ginseng. We can each dig a dozen pounds a day. There's good money in the root.\"  \"Ginseng root,\" Cooper said, \"is peanuts. We need _big_ money.\"  \"Or we could trap,\" offered Adams. \"The place is alive with beaver.\"  \"Have you taken a good look at those beaver? They're about the size of a St. Bernard.\"  \"All the better. Think how much just one pelt would bring.\"  \"No dealer would believe that it was beaver. He'd think you were trying to pull a fast one on him. And there are only a few states that allow beaver to be trapped. To sell the pelts--even if you could--you'd have to take out licenses in each of those states.\"  \"Those mastodon carry a lot of ivory,\" said Cooper. \"And if we wanted to go north, we'd find mammoths that would carry even more....\"  \"And get socked into the jug for ivory smuggling?\"  They sat, all three of them, staring at the fire, not finding anything to say.  The moaning complaint of a giant hunting cat came from somewhere up the river.     IV   Hudson lay in his sleeping bag, staring at the sky. It bothered him a lot. There was not one familiar constellation, not one star that he could name with any certainty. This juggling of the stars, he thought, emphasized more than anything else in this ancient land the vast gulf of years which lay between him and the Earth where he had been--or would be--born.  A hundred and fifty thousand years, Adams had said, give or take ten thousand. There just was no way to know. Later on, there might be. A measurement of the stars and a comparison with their positions in the twentieth century might be one way of doing it. But at the moment, any figure could be no more than a guess.  The time machine was not something that could be tested for calibration or performance. As a matter of fact, there _was_ no way to test it. They had not been certain, he remembered, the first time they had used it, that it would really work. There had been no way to find out. When it worked, you knew it worked. And if it hadn't worked, there would have been no way of knowing beforehand that it wouldn't.  Adams had been sure, of course, but that had been because he had absolute reliance in the half-mathematical, half-philosophic concepts he had worked out--concepts that neither Hudson nor Cooper could come close to understanding.  That had always been the way it had been, even when they were kids, with Wes dreaming up the deals that he and Johnny carried out. Back in those days, too, they had used time travel in their play. Out in Johnny's back yard, they had rigged up a time machine out of a wonderful collection of salvaged junk--a wooden crate, an empty five-gallon paint pail, a battered coffee maker, a bunch of discarded copper tubing, a busted steering wheel and other odds and ends. In it, they had \"traveled\" back to Indian-before-the-white-man land and mammoth-land and dinosaur-land and the slaughter, he remembered, had been wonderfully appalling.  But, in reality, it had been much different. There was much"]]]
