What a trouble it is!  Impossible to keep it in--such a night!\"  \"Hee! hee!\" giggled Slowfoot, who was busy refilling her pipe.  La Certe was still standing in a state of hesitancy, troubled by a strong desire to help his friend, and a stronger desire to spare himself, when he was thrown somewhat off his wonted balance by the sudden reappearance of Dechamp, leading, or rather supporting, a man.  Need we say that it was Fergus McKay, almost blind and dumb from exhaustion, for the parting from Dan Davidson which we have mentioned had proved to be the last straw which broke them both down, and it is probable that the frozen corpse of poor Dan would have been found next day on the snow, had he not been accidentally met by Dechamp, and taken in charge by the Indian Okematan.  Fergus, having a shorter way to go, and, perhaps, possessing a little more vitality or endurance, had just managed to stagger to La Certe's hut when he encountered the same man who, an hour previously, had met and saved his companion further down the Settlement.  The moment Fergus entered the hut, he looked wildly round, and opened his mouth as if to speak.  Then he suddenly collapsed, and fell in a heap upon the floor, scattering flakes of snow from his person in all directions.  La Certe and his wife, though steeped in selfishness, were by no means insensible to the sufferings of humanity when these were actually made visible to their naked eyes.  Like many--too many--people, they were incapable of being impressed very deeply through their ears, but could be keenly touched through the eyes.  No sooner did they behold the condition of Fergus--who was well-known to them--than they dropped their apathetic characters as though they had been garments.  In her haste Slowfoot let fall her pipe, which broke to atoms on the floor--but she heeded it not.  La Certe capsized his mug of tea--but regarded it not; and while the former proceeded to remove the shawl from Fergus's neck and chafe his cold hands, the latter assisted Dechamp to drag the exhausted man a little nearer to the fire, and poured a cup of warm tea down his throat.  Their efforts, though perchance not as wisely directed as they might have been, were so vigorously conducted that success rewarded them. Fergus soon began to show signs of returning animation.  A hunter of the western wilderness is not easily overcome, neither is he long of reviving, as a rule, if not killed outright.  They set him up in a sitting posture with his back against a box, and his feet towards the fire.  Heaving a deep sigh, Fergus looked round with a bewildered, anxious expression.  In a moment intelligence returned to his eyes, and he made a violent attempt to rise, but Dechamp held him down.  \"Let me up!\" he gasped, \"life and death are in the matter--if it iss not death already--\"  \"Be still, Fergus McKay,\" said Dechamp, with that firmness of manner and tone which somehow command respect; \"I know all about it.  Take one bit of bread, one swig more of tea, and you go with me to Fort Garry, to tell the Gov'nor what you know.  He will send help at once.\"  Great was the relief of Fergus when he heard this.  Submitting to treatment like an obedient child, he was soon fit to stagger to the sleigh or cariole, into which he was carefully stuffed and packed like a bale of goods by La Certe and his wife, who, to their credit be it recorded, utterly ignored, for once, the discomforts of the situation.  Fergus was asleep before the packing was quite done.  Then Dechamp jumped in beside him, and drove off in the direction of the Hudson's Bay Company's establishment, Fort Garry, while our worthy couple returned to their hut to indulge in a final and well-earned pipe and a mug of the strongest possible tea.    CHAPTER THREE.  TO THE RESCUE.  Winnipeg city, with its thousands of inhabitants, now covers the spot to which Antoine Dechamp drove his friend Fergus McKay.  At the time we write of, the only habitation there was Fort Garry, a solitary stone building of some strength, but without regular troops of any kind, and held only by a few employes of the Hudson's Bay Company, who were there only in the capacity of fur-traders.  Here the Governor of the colony received the unexpected guests with hospitality; heard the tale of Fergus with a sympathetic ear, and at once organised a rescue-expedition with dog-sledges and provisions.  While this was being done at the fort, Dan Davidson was similarly employed at Prairie Cottage, the residence of his mother, who, since the death of her husband--a farmer from the Scottish Lowlands--had managed her farm with the aid of her two sons, Dan and Peter; the latter being a youth of seventeen.  She was also assisted by her only daughter, Jessie, who was over thirteen years of age, and already esteemed an authority on the subjects of poultry, cookery, and dairy produce.  A small servant--a French half-breed named Louise--completed the household of the widow Davidson.  On reaching home, Dan, like Fergus McKay, experienced difficulties that he had not counted on, for his overtaxed strength fairly broke down, and he found himself almost incapable at first of telling his tale of disaster.  Then, when he tried to go about the needful preparations for rescue, he found himself unable to resist drowsiness, and if he ventured to sit down for a moment he fell sound asleep at once.  Those who have experienced this condition know how overwhelming and intensely disagreeable it is, especially if resistance to it is rendered imperative by a matter of life or death.  Davidson struggled bravely against it of course, but the struggle had already been so long continued that his efforts were now in vain.  Starting up from the supper which Jessie had spread before him, and which he was languidly attempting to eat, he said, almost fiercely, \"Where is the wash-tub, Louise?\"  The surprised little domestic pointed to the article in question.  \"Here; fetch some cold water.\"  \"It is full,\" said Louise with a strong French accent and a pretty lisp.  Without the ceremony even of throwing back his collar Dan plunged his head into the water, and, after steeping it for a few seconds, drew it out refreshed.  His younger brother entered the room at that moment.  \"Peter,\" he said, drying his head violently with a jack-towel, \"have you got the sledge ready, and the provisions packed, and the empty sledge wi' the buffalo-robes?\"  \"Ay--all ready,\" answered the other, for he was a sprightly, willing youth, who rejoiced in any unexpected demand on his superabundant energies.  \"But I say, Dan, you are quite unfit to start off again without rest.\"  He looked in his brother's face anxiously, for Dan had seated himself once more to his food, but seemed unable to deal with it properly. \"Why, you've got the knife and fork in the wrong hands, Dan!  You _must_ have an hour's rest before we start.\"  \"Impossible,\" returned the other with a dazed look, as he seized a mug of water and drank it off.  \"An hour's delay may mean death to Elspie and old Duncan McKay.\"  \"But let _me_ start off at once,\" returned Peter, eagerly.  \"I've a pretty good guess, from your description, where you left them.  Besides, the gale is not so bad now.  After an hour's sleep you will be able to start fresh, maybe overtake me.  Jess will be sure to waken you in--\"  He stopped, for his brother's head had bent slowly forward while he was speaking, and now rested on his arms on the table.  The worn-out man was sound asleep.  \"Just leave him, Peter, and be off wi' the dogs,\" said Mrs Davidson. \"Okematan will keep you in the right track.  I'll be sure to wake him in time to catch you up.\"  \"No, mother, not without his leave,\" said the youth, firmly.  \"Dan! Dan! rouse up, old boy!  Shall we start without you?\"  \"Yes, yes--I'm ready,\" said the poor fellow, starting up and swaying to and fro like a drunken man; \"but--I say, Peter, I'm done for.  I depend on you, lad, to keep me up to the scratch.  Lay the dog-whip across my shoulders if I try to lie down.  Promise me that.  D'ee hear!\"  \"Yes, I understand,\" returned the youth with intense earnestness.  \"Now look here, Dan, you know me: will you trust me?\"  \"Of course I will,\" answered Dan with a languid smile.  \"Well, then; come along, we'll rescue Elspie--you may depend on that. Okematan and I will look after you and see that all goes right.  Come.\"  He took his brother by the arm, and led him unresistingly away, followed by the dark-skinned Indian, who, with the usual reticence of his race, had stood like a brown statue, silently observing events.  Jessie Davidson, who was a fair and comely maiden, touched him on the arm as he was passing out--  \"Oh! take care of him, Okematan,\" she said, anxiously.  Okematan replied \"Ho!\" in a sort of grunt.  It was an expressively uttered though not very comprehensible reply; but Jessie was satisfied, for she knew the man well, as he had for a considerable time been, not exactly a servant of the house, but a sort of self-appointed hanger-on, or unpaid retainer.  For an Indian, he was of a cheerful disposition and made himself generally useful.  When they were outside, it was found that the gale had abated considerably, and that the moon was occasionally visible among the clouds which were driving wildly athwart the heavens, as though the elemental war which had ceased to trouble the earth were still raging in the sky.  \"Peter,\" said the brother, as they stood for a moment beside two Indian sledges, one of which was laden with provisions, the other empty--\"Peter, don't forget your promise.  Lay the whip on heavy. Nothing else will keep me awake!\"  \"All right!  Sit down there for a moment.  We're not quite ready yet.\"  \"I'd"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23373"],["title","The Eagle Cliff (#1)"],["body","crossed the road at the same identical moment, slowly.  They met!  Who can describe that meeting? Not the writer, for he did not see it; more's the pity!  Very few people saw it, for it was a quiet corner.  The parties concerned cannot be said to have seen, though they felt it.  Both went down.  It was awful, really, to see a feeble old lady struggling with an athlete and a bicycle!  Two little street boys, and a ragged girl appeared as if by magic.  They always do!  \"Oh!  I say!  Ain't he bin and squashed 'er?\"  Such was the remark of one of the boys.  \"Pancakes is plump to 'er,\" was the observation of the other.  The ragged girl said nothing, but looked unspeakable things.  Burning with shame, trembling with anxiety, covered with dust and considerably bruised, Barret sprang up, left his fallen steed, and, raising the little old lady with great tenderness in his arms, sat her on the pavement with her back against the railings, while he poured out abject apologies and earnest inquiries.  Strange to say the old lady was not hurt in the least--only a good deal shaken and very indignant.  Stranger still, a policeman suddenly appeared in the distance.  At the same time a sweep, a postman, and a servant girl joined the group.  Young Barret, as we have said, was sensitive.  To become the object and centre of a crowd in such circumstances was overwhelming.  A climax was put to his confusion, when one of the street arabs, observing the policeman, suddenly exclaimed:--  \"Oh!  I say, 'ere's a bobby!  What a lark.  Won't you be 'ad up before the beaks?  It'll be a case o' murder.\"  \"No, it won't,\" retorted the other boy; \"it'll be a case o' manslaughter an' attempted suicide jined.\"  Barret started up, allowing the servant maid to take his place, and saw the approaching constable.  Visions of detention, publicity, trial, conviction, condemnation, swam before him.  \"A reg'lar Krismas panty-mime for nuffin'!\" remarked the ragged girl, breaking silence for the first time.  Scarcely knowing what he did, Barret leaped towards his bicycle, set it up, vaulted into the saddle, as he well knew how, and was safely out of sight in a few seconds.  Yet not altogether safe.  A guilty conscience pursued, overtook, and sat upon him.  Shame and confusion overwhelmed him.  Up to that date he had been honourable, upright, straightforward; as far as the world's estimation went, irreproachable.  Now, in his own estimation, he was mean, false, underhand, sneaking!  But he did not give way to despair.  He was a true hero, else we would not have had anything to write about him.  Suddenly he slowed, frowned, compressed his lips, described a complete circle--in spite of a furniture van that came in his way--and deliberately went back to the spot where the accident had occurred; but there was no little lady to be seen.  She had been conveyed away, the policeman was gone, the little boys were gone, the ragged girl, sweep, postman, and servant maid--all were gone, \"like the baseless fabric of a vision,\" leaving only new faces and strangers behind to wonder what accident and thin old lady the excited youth was asking about--so evanescent are the incidents that occur; and so busily pre-occupied are the human torrents that rush in the streets of London!  The youth turned sadly from the spot and continued his journey at a slower pace.  As he went along, the thought that the old lady might have received internal injuries, and would die, pressed heavily upon him: Thus, he might actually be a murderer, at the best a man-slaughterer, without knowing it, and would carry in his bosom a dreadful secret, and a terrible uncertainty, to the end of his life!  Of course he could go to that great focus of police energy--Scotland Yard--and give himself up; but on second thoughts he did not quite see his way to that.  However, he would watch the daily papers closely. That evening, in a frame of mind very different from the mental condition, in which he had set out on his sixty miles' ride in the afternoon, John Barret presented himself to his friend and old schoolfellow, Bob Mabberly.  \"You're a good fellow, Barret; I knew you would come; but you look warm. Have you been running?\" asked Mabberly, opening the door of his lodging to his friend.  \"Come in: I have news for you.  Giles Jackman has agreed to go.  Isn't that a comfort? for, besides his rare and valuable sporting qualities, he is more than half a doctor, which will be important, you know, if any of us should get ill or come to grief.  Sit down and we'll talk it over.\"  Now, it was a telegram from Bob Mabberly which led John Barret to suddenly undertake a sixty miles' ride that day, and which was thus the indirect cause of the little old lady being run down.  The telegram ran as follows:--  \"Come instanter.  As you are.  Clothes unimportant.  Yacht engaged. Crew also.  Sail, without fail, Thursday.  Plenty more to say when we meet.\"  \"Now, you see, Bob, with your usual want of precision, or care, or some such quality--\"  \"Stop, Barret.  Do be more precise in the use of language.  How can the want of a thing be a _quality_?\"  \"You are right, Bob.  Let me say, then, that with your usual unprecision and carelessness you sent me a telegram, which could not reach me till late on Wednesday night, after all trains were gone, telling me that you sail, without fail, on Thursday, but leaving me to guess whether you meant Thursday morning or evening.\"  \"How stupid!  My dear fellow, I forgot that!\"  \"Just so.  Well to make sure of losing no time, instead of coming here by trains, which, as you know, are very awkward and slow in our neighbourhood, besides necessitating long waits and several changes, I just packed my portmanteau, gun, rods, etcetera, and gave directions to have them forwarded here by the first morning train, then took a few winks of sleep, and at the first glimmer of daylight mounted my wheel and set off across country as straight as country roads would permit of--and--here I am.\"  \"True, Barret, and in good time for tea too.  We don't sail till morning, for the tide does not serve till six o'clock, so that will give us plenty of time to put the finishing touches to our plans, allow your things to arrive, and permit of our making--or, rather, renewing--our acquaintance with Giles Jackman.  You remember him, don't you?\"  \"Yes, faintly.  He was a broad, sturdy, good-humoured, reckless, little boy when I last saw him at old Blatherby's school.\"  \"Just so.  Your portrait is correct.  I saw him last month, after a good many years' interval, and he is exactly what he was, but considerably exaggerated at every point.  He is not, indeed, a little, but a middle sized man now; as good-humoured as ever; much more reckless; sturdier and broader a great deal, with an amount of hair about his lip, chin, and head generally that would suffice to fit out three or four average men.  He has been in India--in the Woods and Forests Department, or something of that sort--and has killed tigers, elephants, and such-like by the hundred, they say; but I've met him only once or twice, and he don't speak much about his own doings.  He is home on sick-leave just now.\"  \"Sick-leave!  Will he be fit to go with us?\" asked Barret, doubtfully.  \"Fit!\" cried Mabberly.  \"Ay, much more fit than you are, strong and vigorous though you be, for the voyage home has not only cured him; it has added superabundant health.  Voyages always do to sick Anglo-Indians, don't you know?  However ill a man may be in India, all he has to do is to obtain leave of absence and get on board of a ship homeward bound, and straightway health, rushing in upon him like a river, sends him home more than cured.  So now our party is made up, yacht victualled, anchor tripped; and--`all's well that ends well.'\"  \"But all is not ended, Bob.  Things have only begun, and, as regards myself, they have begun disastrously,\" said Barret, who thereupon related the incident of the little old lady being run down.  \"My dear fellow,\" cried Mabberly, laughing, \"excuse me, don't imagine me indifferent to the sufferings of the poor old thing; but do you really suppose that one who was tough enough, after such a collision, to sit up at all, with or without the support of the railings, and give way to indignant abuse--\"  \"Not abuse, Bob, indignant looks and sentiments; she was too thorough a lady to think of abuse--\"  \"Well, well; call it what you please; but you may depend upon it that she is not much hurt, and you will hear nothing more about the matter.\"  \"That's it!  That's the very thing that I dread,\" returned Barret, anxiously.  \"To go through life with the possibility that I may be an uncondemned and unhung murderer is terrible to think of.  Then I can't get over the meanness of my running away so suddenly.  If any one had said I was capable of such conduct I should have laughed at him.  Yet have I lived to do it--contemptibly--in cold blood.\"  \"Contemptibly it may have been, but not in cold blood, for did you not say you were roused to a state of frenzied alarm at the sight of the bobby? and assuredly, although unhung as yet, you are not uncondemned, if self-condemnation counts for anything.  Come, don't take such a desponding view of the matter.  We shall see the whole affair in the morning papers before sailing, with a report of the old lady's name and condition--I mean condition of health--as well as your unmanly flight, without leaving your card; so you'll be able to start with an easy--Ha! a cab! yes, it's Jackman.  I know his manservant,\" said Mabberly, as he looked out at the window.  Another moment and a broad-chested man, of about five-and-twenty, with a bronzed face--as far as hair left it visible--a pair of merry blue eyes, and a hearty manner, was grasping his old schoolfellows by the hand, and endeavouring to trace the likeness in John Barret to the quiet little boy whom he used to help with his tasks many years before.  \"Man, who would have thought you could"]]]
