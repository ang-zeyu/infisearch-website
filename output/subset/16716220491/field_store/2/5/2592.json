It was well known to various influential partizans that events of unusual gravity were \"looming in the distance,\"[4] by which they hoped to be able to raise themselves to power. Rumours of a sinister import were in constant circulation; the more alarmed looked hourly for some mischievous demonstration, and the more reckless displayed increasing confidence and audacity. That reports should be circulated of an immediate change of Government, must have been only natural under such circumstances; the wide-spread discontent of the masses of the population, swelling and surging like a storm-driven sea, had nothing else sufficiently prominent to direct itself against, but the authorities who appeared to them responsible for the evils under which they laboured; and those persons who feared, or pretended to fear, the threatened storm, caught at the idea of removing the unpopular Ministers as affording the only chance of re-establishing the public tranquillity. Such, however, had long before been the tactics of opposition, and such, we are afraid, they are likely to remain.        [4] \"The Government,\" writes a Cabinet Minister to the Lord       Lieutenant of Ireland, \"is in a very strange and, I must       acknowledge, in a precarious state.\"--Lord Sidmouth to Earl       Talbot, Pellew's \"Life of Lord Sidmouth,\" vol. iii. p. 310.       DR. PHILLIMORE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Whitehall, Feb. 15, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD,      As your Lordship desired me to write if there was any news of any     description in circulation, I take up my pen merely to inform you     that there is a report most generally disseminated both throughout     the West-end of the town and the City, that the Ministers have     resigned. Sir W. Scott [Lord Stowell] yesterday, in expressing his     apprehension (to an acquaintance of mine) that such an event was in     contemplation, said it would not be a partial change, \"but a     general sweep.\" Excuse haste.      Ever your obliged and faithful servant,      JOSEPH PHILLIMORE.      P.S.--The Cabinet sat thirteen hours on Sunday.   The sweeping change so confidently anticipated did not take place; and probably when it became evident to some of the most daring of the political speculators of the time, that this was not so imminent as they desired, they resolved to expedite it in a fashion that should leave no necessity for a second experiment of the kind.  On the 23rd of February, the loyal citizens of the metropolis were startled by the intelligence of the timely discovery of a plot to assassinate his Majesty's Ministers while they were at dinner in the house of the Earl of Harrowby, Grosvenor Square, and of a sanguinary conflict of the police and military with the conspirators, when attempting to seize the latter at their place of rendezvous, in an obscure thoroughfare near Paddington, called Cato Street. The history of the Thistlewood Conspiracy,[5] as related in the criminal annals of the period, illustrates in a remarkable manner the diseased state of political feeling then existing in England. It was a small copy of the Irish rebellion,--marked by the same cut-throat policy,--having in view a similar overwhelming revolution, with the same absurdly inadequate means. Fortunately for the United Kingdom, the chief actors in both succeeded only in bringing upon themselves the destruction with which they had menaced a powerful Government.        [5] A good account of it may be found in Pellew's \"Life of Lord       Sidmouth,\" vol. iii. p. 312.  Thistlewood proposed to slaughter the entire Cabinet at once, when assembled at Lord Harrowby's, which was assented to; \"for,\" said he, \"as there has not been a dinner for so long, there will no doubt be fourteen or sixteen there; and it will be a rare haul to murder them all together.\"[6]        [6] Thistlewood's Trial, p. 37. Alison's \"Europe,\" vol. ii. p.       425.  The next communication refers to the same incident, as well as to the various rumours then in circulation:--       MARQUIS WELLESLEY TO MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Richmond, Tuesday, Feb. 29, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD,      Not having received any commands from you, and having nothing to     communicate beyond the rumours of the day, without any authentic     information, I have not lately troubled your Lordship with any     letter.      It was unnecessary to state that the stories of my being summoned     to the King, &c. &c., were all absolutely false. If I had received     any such summons, your Lordship would have been fully acquainted     with the whole transaction by express from me at the earliest     moment.      I believe an attempt was made to confirm the rumours by the     circumstance of his Majesty's gracious kindness in answering my     inquiries at the moment of his greatest danger, by expresses from     Carlton House. My carriage also was in town one day in the highest     paroxysm of the supposed squabble; but I happened not to be in it,     being confined at home by a cold.      I have not been in town, except to collect some account of the late     horrible plot, on the day after the discovery (when I was in the     House of Lords about half an hour), for a considerable time, the     weather and a cold having concurred to keep me at home.      I know nothing authentic of the quarrel, so much the subject of     rumour and noise, nor do I know more of the present designs or     future plans. I am at all times at your Lordship's orders, to wait     on you whenever you please; the weather is now so much improved,     that I can attend you in London any morning that may suit you; but     I really have nothing yet to state beyond the contents of my former     letters.      Always, my dear Lord,      Yours most sincerely,      WELLESLEY.   In the spring of the year 1821, their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Clarence lost their only child, the infant Princess Elizabeth. Of this long-forgotten branch of the Royal Family, one who was present at her birth says:--\"She is christened by the name of Elizabeth Georgiana. I hope the bairn will live. It came a little too early, and is a very small one at present, but the doctors seem to think it will thrive; and to the ears of your humble servant it appears to be noisy enough to show it has great strength.\"[7] Her loss affected the King, between whom and the Duke the most lively affection existed; and he wrote to his confidential attendant in the following terms:--        [7] Twiss's \"Life of Lord Eldon,\" vol. ii. p. 37.       THE KING TO SIR WILLIAM KNIGHTON.      Brighton, March 4, 1821.      MY DEAR FRIEND,      For God's sake come down to me to-morrow morning. The melancholy     tidings of the almost sudden death of my poor little niece have     just reached me, and have overset me beyond all I can express to     you. Poor William's[8] letter, which is all affection, and     especially towards you, refers me to you for all the particulars;     therefore pray come to me with as little delay as possible. I have     not time to add a word more about myself. You will be a great     consolation to me.      Ever your most affectionate friend,      G. R.[9]        [8] The Duke of Clarence.        [9] Knighton's \"Memoirs,\" p. 88.   The first report of the intention of Queen Caroline, as the Princess of Wales was now styled, to return to England, appears to have taken both the King and the Government by surprise; but the latter, in the conviction that they had an overwhelming case against her, would not believe that she was serious, and took no steps towards putting the result of the Milan investigations into shape.[10]        [10] \"Every one,\" the Duke of Wellington acknowledged, \"had his       secret persuasion and his wish, that with such a case against her       she would never come here.\"--R. Plumer Ward's \"Diary,\" vol. ii.       p. 65.  That everything did not run smoothly between his Majesty and his Ministers, may be inferred from a memorandum made (April 26, 1820) by one of the most influential of them:--  \"Our Royal master seems to have got into temper again, as far as I could judge from his conversation with me this morning. He has been pretty well disposed to part with us all, because we would not make additions to his revenue. This we thought conscientiously we could not do in the present state of the country, and of the distresses of the middle and lower orders of the people,--to which we might add, too, that of the higher orders. My own individual opinion was such that I could not bring myself to oppress the country at present by additional taxation for that purpose, and I strictly and firmly acted upon that opinion, when I had every reason to believe that, adhering to it, I should no longer write the letter C. after the name Eldon. I think now the speech, in which he will disavow wishing for any increase, will make him popular, and if times mend, will give him a better chance of fair increase of income than anything else could give him.\"[11]        [11] Twiss's \"Life of Lord Eldon,\" vol. ii. p. 3.  The Lord Chancellor, who has not been held in great estimation for disinterestedness or patriotism, is here represented as very nearly making himself a martyr to his sense of public duty; but the cause of Lord Eldon's unusual dissatisfaction with his Sovereign may be gathered from another cotemporary memorandum, dated the following day:--  \"The Vice-Chancellor Leach has been trying to root out the Ministry; he has been telling the King that his present Ministers are not standing by him; that he ought to have a divorce. There is a flirtation between Tierney and the King.\"[12]        [12] \"Wilberforce's Life,\" by his Sons, vol. v. p. 54.

Public opinion, indeed, was showing itself in many curious ways. \"The town here is employed,\" writes the Lord Chancellor, \"in nothing but speculation whether her Majesty will or will not come. Great bets are laid about it. Some people have taken fifty guineas, undertaking in lieu of them to pay a guinea a-day till she comes, so sure are these that she will come within fifty days; others, again, are taking less than fifty guineas, undertaking to pay a guinea a-day till she comes, so sure are they that she will not come; others assert that they know she will come, and that she will find her way into Westminster Abbey and Westminster Hall on the Coronation, in spite of all opposition. I retain my old opinion that she will not come, _unless she is insane_.\"[13]        [13] Twiss's \"Life of Eldon,\" vol. ii. p. 5.  A change of Ministry, Lord Dudley[14] assures us, was talked about more than usual; but, as the Opposition were obliged to confess that they would find great difficulty in establishing a Government, the existing Administration held a tolerably secure tenancy.        [14] \"Letters,\" p. 251. Alison states that attempts were made       to form a new Ministry, with Lord Wellesley at the head--\"History       of Europe,\" vol. ii. p. 457. This, however, as has been shown       (_ante_ p. 9), is incorrect.  An Order in Council was issued for omitting the Queen's name from the Church Service, and other signs appeared, indicating a desire to withhold from her her queenly title. This made a temper, never remarkably tractable, not to be controlled by the dictates of prudence; the old spirit manifested itself in its most spirited form; and she lost no time in letting the world know that she was returning to England to obtain justice for her wrongs. Those who thought they knew her best, considered that vindictive feelings influenced her resolution, and that, with a full knowledge of the inflammable state of public opinion in the British Empire, she had determined on some great work of mischief against the peace of the kingdom and the security of its ruler.  At this period there were many elements of discord in the social community that were acting upon a large and dangerous portion of it, to the prejudice of the Government.[15] Besides the Thistlewood gang, justice was about to dispose of Mr. Orator Hunt and his myrmidons, then awaiting their trial. Sir Charles Wolseley, a baronet, and Joseph Harrison, a preacher, were under prosecution for uttering seditious speeches.[16] Sir Francis Burdett--a more popular tribune--was also at variance with the laws for a scandalous attack on Ministers; in short, every day seemed to bring to light some source of mischief which could not fail to add to the uneasiness of the responsible servants of the Crown. A general election stirred up other noxious ingredients, and during the spring of the year everything seemed to betoken a coming convulsion. At this time the following communication was written:--        [15] Lord Sidmouth's intelligence led him to expect daily a       revolutionary movement.--\"Life,\" by Dean Pellew, vol. iii.       p. 325.        [16] The minister of religion exceeded the democratic baronet       in the violence of his denunciations of the ruling powers,       a fair example of which may be found in the following       _morceau_:--\"Kings, princes, dukes, lords, commons, parliaments,       archbishops, bishops, prelates, rectors, high-constables,       constables, sheriffs, deputy-constables and bailiffs, are all       corrupt, and the time is near at hand when they will be upset.       The people should rise _en masse_ to suppress such a tyrannical       Government as the one of this country, and it will not be long,       but very soon, that it shall be overturned, and many a bloody       battle may be fought, and many a one incarcerated in prison,       before it shall be accomplished.\"       LORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      March 29, 1820.      Hunt's conviction is beyond my hope, though it would certainly have     been no easy matter for any jury to acquit him, even under the     charge such as it is. His motion for a new trial is, I imagine,     nothing more than the sort of last resource at which defeated men,     whether at elections or trials, always love to catch. It would have     been a dreadful thing indeed if it had been established by the     result of that trial that the Manchester meeting was, under all its     circumstances, a legal assembly.   Alarming as might be considered the aspect of domestic affairs, the Government, so far from betraying apprehension, carried on the business of the country with untiring vigilance and decision. Hunt and five of his associates, after a long trial, were on the 23rd of March, at York, found guilty of unlawfully assembling and inciting to hatred of the Government. On the same day, Sir Francis Burdett was found guilty of uttering a seditious libel. On the 10th of April, Sir Charles Wolseley and Mr. Joseph Harrison were also found guilty of sedition. The most guilty of the Cato Street heroes made their last public appearance at the Old Bailey on the 1st of May; the remainder were expatriated to New South Wales. Thus the supremacy of the law was vindicated; but there still existed in the more populous districts feelings inimical to the authorities, that might be restrained by coercive demonstrations, but which only waited a favourable season for bursting through all control: and as, on the 20th of April, Mr. Denman and Mr. Brougham had been acknowledged by the Lord Chancellor, from his seat in the Court of Chancery, the Queen's Solicitor and Attorney-General, the discontented took heart, and saw in this admission of the Queen's position, a prognostication of the struggle that was to create for them the opportunity for which they were waiting.  The Court of the Monarch did not appear more apprehensive than his Ministers. A day was fixed for the Coronation; and among those who would have to assist in the ceremonial, no one ventured to hint on the possibility of the Queen having any position in it. On the 3rd of May, the King received addresses at Carlton House; and on the 10th, his Majesty held his first Levee since his accession to the throne, at which nearly 1800 persons of distinction were present, who testified their attachment to his person in a manner that must have left him little to desire. It was known that his consort intended to agitate the empire from end to end, and her arrival was looked for in a few weeks; but the families of the great political party that formed and supported the Government, betrayed no uneasiness--indeed, the most influential regarded, or affected to regard, the coming struggle with a quiet disdain, that evinced their confidence in the loyalty and good sense of the nation. \"His Majesty's Opposition,\" however, talked and looked very differently;--the Democratic party were vehement in their denunciations of the Queen's wrongs, and the leading Whigs began to come forward prominently as champions of her rights. This is about the date of the following communications:--       RIGHT HON. THOS. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Cleveland Square, May 4, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD B----,      I have but little news to tell you. The general arrangement of the     Civil List, by replacing it as it stood in 1816, is so much better     a bargain for the public than I had expected, that I for one am     well contented with it; and if report be true, it was obtained by     nothing but the most determined refusal of the Ministers to do     more. Still, however, I understand that the Admiralty Droits are     unpopular enough to threaten the Government with a good deal of     embarrassment; for undoubtedly, if they have bargained with the     King for the statement of 1816, when he had the Admiralty Droits,     they cannot in equity deprive him of that part of his bargain.     Brougham seems by his speech to have conceived the notion of giving     the King _compensation_ for them; but it seems to me to be but     a bad bargain for the public, to make them, under the present     pressure, purchase out a remote contingent future revenue, which     can arise only out of a war that no Power in Europe is rich enough     to make, any more than ourselves.      Nobody knows what Brougham's motion will be to-morrow, or what     course the Opposition will take on Monday. I hope none of our     friends will disturb an arrangement which I believe the Government     had some merit and great difficulty in reducing to its present     form.      The Coronation, which Lord G. Seymour told me ten days ago was     suspended, is now again in expectation, according to general     belief; it has revived in common report, because I fancy the Earl     Marshal has just been ordered to have an estimate made of the     necessary expenses attending it in his department; but it does not     follow from that estimate that the ceremony will take place, I     think it more probable that it will be put off, because the King     will not like it unless it be expensive, and Van knows not how to     pay for it if it is. Clive told me yesterday, that three naval     peers are about to be made--Sir W. Young, Warren, and Saumarez.     This looks as if an Accession List was preparing; but I have heard     of no others. It seems now understood that the whole Militia will     be called out. Manchester, as Lady Grosvenor tells me, is quieter;     as Harriet writes, is as bad as ever. Scotland is still only quiet     from the military force there, but the temper is said to be as bad     as ever.       MR. W. H. FREMANTLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Stanhope Street, May 8, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD,      We had a heavy debate last night,--Tierney very able, and"]]]
