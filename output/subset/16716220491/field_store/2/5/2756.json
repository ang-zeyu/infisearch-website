I'll be glad to have her at my fireside, for your sake, Nell.\"  \"But she won't leave the old house.\"  \"H'm! well, that difficulty may be got over by my comin' to the old house, since the old 'ooman won't come to the noo one.  I can rent it from her, and buy up the furniture as it stands; so that there will be no occasion for her to move out of her chair.--Why, what's the objection to that plan?\" he added, on observing that Nelly shook her head.  \"She would never consent to sell the things,--not even to you, Bill; and she has been so long the head of the house that I don't think she would like to--to--\"  \"To play second fiddle,\" put in the sailor.  \"Very good, but I won't ask to play first fiddle.  In fact, she may have first, second, and third, and double bass and trombone, all to herself as far as I am concerned. Come, Nelly, don't let us have any more `buts'; just name the day, and I'll bear down on the parson this very afternoon.\"  Leaving them to continue the discussion of this interesting point, we will turn into the cottage and visit the old woman who stood so much in the way of our hero's wishes.  Mrs Blyth was one of those unfortunates who, although not very old, have been, by ill-health, reduced to the appearance of extreme old age. Nevertheless, she had been blessed with that Christian spirit of calm, gentle resignation, which is frequently seen in aged invalids, enabling them to bear up cheerfully under heavy griefs and sufferings.  She was very little, very thin, very lame, very old-looking (ninety at least, in appearance), very tremulous, very subdued, and _very_ sweet.  Even that termagant gossip, Mrs Hard-soul, who dwelt alone in a tumble-down hut near the quay, was heard upon one occasion to speak of her as \"dear old Mrs Blyth.\"  Beside Mrs Blyth, on a stool, engaged in peeling potatoes, sat a young woman who was in all respects her opposite.  Bessy Blunt was tall, broad, muscular, plain-looking, masculine, and remarkably unsubdued. She was a sort of maid-of-all-work and companion to the old woman.  Mrs Blyth lived in the hope of subduing her attendant--who was also her niece--by means of kindness.  \"Who came into the garden just now?\" asked Mrs Blyth in a meek voice.  \"Who would it be but William Bowls? sure he comes twice every day, sometimes oftener,\" replied Bessy; \"but what's the use? nothing comes of it.\"  \"Something _may_ come of it, Bessy,\" said Mrs Blyth, \"if William settles down steadily to work, but I am anxious about him, for he seems to me hasty in temper.  Surely, Bessy, you would not like to see our Nell married to an angry man?\"  \"I don't know about that,\" replied the girl testily, as she cut a potato in two halves with unnecessary violence; \"all I know is that I would like to see her married to Bill Bowls.  He's an able, handsome man. Indeed, I would gladly marry him myself if he asked me!\"  Mrs Blyth smiled a little at this.  Bessy frowned at a potato and said \"Humph!\" sternly.  Now it happened just at that moment that the press-gang before referred to arrived in front of the cottage.  Bessy chanced to look through the window, and saw them pass.  Instantly she ran to the back door and screamed \"Press-gang,\" as a warning to Bill to get out of the way and hide himself as quickly as possible, then, hastening back, she seized one of old Mrs Blyth's crutches, ran to the front door, and slammed it to, just as the leader of the gang came forward.  Meanwhile William Bowls, knowing that if he did not make his escape, his hopes of being married speedily would be blasted, turned to leap over the garden wall, but the leader of the press-gang had taken care to guard against such a contingency by sending a detachment round to the rear.  \"It's all up with me!\" cried Bill, with a look of chagrin, on observing the men.  \"Come, hide in the kitchen; quick!  I will show you where,\" cried Nelly, seizing his hand and leading him into the house, the back door of which she locked and barred.  \"There, get in,\" cried the girl, opening a low door in the wall, which revealed the coal-hole of the establishment.  Bill's brow flushed.  He drew back with a proud stern look and hesitated.  \"Oh, do! for _my_ sake,\" implored Nell.  A thundering rap on the front door resounded through the cottage; the sailor put his pride in his pocket, stooped low and darted in.  Nelly shut the door, and leaned a baking-board against it.  \"Let us in!\" said a deep voice outside.  \"Never!\" replied Bessy, stamping her foot.  \"You had better, dear,\" replied the voice, in a conciliatory tone; \"we won't do you any harm.\"  \"Go along with you--brutes!\" said the girl.  \"We'll have to force the door if you don't open it, my dear.\"  \"You'd better not!\" cried Bessy through the keyhole.  At the same time she applied her eye to that orifice, and instantly started back, for she saw the leader of the gang retire a few paces preparatory to making a rush.  There was short time for action, nevertheless Bessy was quick enough to fling down a large stool in front of the door and place herself in an attitude of defence.  Next moment the door flew open with a crash, and a sailor sprang in, cutlass in hand.  As a matter of course he tripped over the stool, and fell prostrate at Bessy's feet, and the man who followed received such a well-delivered blow from the crutch that he fell on the top of his comrade.  While the heroine was in the act of receiving the third she felt both her ankles seized by the man who had fallen first.  A piercing yell followed.  In attempting to free herself she staggered back and fell, the crutch was wrenched from her grasp, and the whole gang poured over her into the kitchen, where they were met by their comrades, who had just burst in the back door.  \"Search close,\" cried one of these; \"there's a big fellow in the house; we saw him run into it.\"  \"You may save yourselves the trouble; there's no man in this house,\" cried Bessy, who had risen and followed her conquerors, and who now stood, with dishevelled locks, flushed countenance, and gleaming eyes, vowing summary vengeance on the first man she caught off his guard!  As the men believed her, they took care to keep well on their guard while engaged in the search.  Poor old Mrs Blyth looked absolutely horror-stricken at this invasion of her cottage, and Nelly stood beside her, pale as marble and trembling with anxiety.  Every hole and corner of the house was searched without success; the floors were examined for trap-doors, and even the ceilings were carefully looked over, but there was no sign of any secret door, and the careless manner in which the bake-board had been leaned against the wall, as well as its small size, prevented suspicion being awakened in that direction.  This being the case, the leader of the gang called two of his men aside and engaged in a whispered conversation.  \"It's quite certain that he is here,\" said one, \"but where they have stowed him is the puzzle.\"  \"Well, it is indeed a puzzle,\" replied the leader, \"but I've thought of a plan.  He may be the father, or brother, or cousin of the household, d'ye see, and it strikes me if we were to pretend to insult the women, that would draw him out!\"  \"But I don't half like that notion,\" said one of the men.  \"Why not?\" asked the other, who wore a huge pair of whiskers, \"it's only pretence, you know.  Come, I'll try it.\"  Saying this he went towards old Mrs Blyth and whispered to Nelly--\"Don't be frightened, my ducky, we're only a-goin' to try a dodge, d'ye see.  Stand by, we won't do you no harm.\"  The man winked solemnly several times with the view of reassuring Nelly, and then raising his voice to a loud pitch exclaimed--  \"Come now, old 'ooman, it's quite plain that there's a feller in this here house, an' as we can't find him nowheres, we've come to the conclusion he must be under your big chair.  In coorse we must ask you to git up, an' as ye don't seem to be able to do that very well, we'll have to lift you.  So here goes.\"  The man seized the old woman's chair and shuffled with his feet as though he were about to lift it.  Nelly screamed.  Bessy uttered a howl of indignation, and rushed upon the foe with teeth and nails ready, but being arrested by a powerful man in the rear, she vented her wrath in a hideous yell.  The success of the scheme was great--much greater, indeed, than had been anticipated.  The bake-board fell flat down, the door of the coal-hole burst open, and our hero, springing out, planted a blow on the nose of the big-whiskered man that laid him flat on the floor.  Another blow overturned the man who restrained Bessy, and a third was about to be delivered when a general rush was made, and Bill Bowls, being overpowered by numbers, was finally secured.  \"Now, my fine fellow,\" said the leader of the gang, \"you may as well go with us quietly, for ye see resistance is useless, an' it only frightens the old woman.\"  This latter part of the remark had more effect on the unfortunate Bill than the former.  He at once resigned himself into the hands of his captors.  As he was about to be led away, he turned towards Mrs Blyth, intending to speak, but the poor old woman had fainted, and Nelly's fears for her lover were lost for the moment in her anxiety about her mother.  It was not until the party had left the room that the poor girl became fully aware of what was going on.  Uttering a loud cry she rushed towards the outer door.  Bill heard the cry, and, exerting himself to the utmost, almost succeeded in overturning the five men who held him.  \"Make your mind easy,\" said one of them; \"no harm will come to the women.  We ain't housebreakers or thieves.  All fair an' above board we are--true-blue British tars, as would rather swing at the yard-arm than hurt the feelin's of a woman, pretty or ugly, young or old.  It's all in the way of dooty, d'ye see?  The King's orders, young man so belay heavin' about like that, else we'll heave ye on your beam-ends, lash you hand and futt to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23371"],["title","Blown to Bits: The Lonely Man of Rakata, the Malay Archipelago (#1)"],["body","backstays of the foremast gave way.  The result was that the additional strain thus thrown on the other stays was too much for them.  They also parted, and the foretop-mast, snapping short off with a report like a cannon-shot, went over the side, carrying the main-topgallant-mast and all its gear along with it.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE HAVEN IN THE CORAL RING.  It seemed as if the storm-fiend were satisfied with the mischief he had accomplished, for immediately after the disaster just described, the gale began to moderate, and when the sun rose it had been reduced to a stiff but steady breeze.  From the moment of the accident onward, the whole crew had been exerting themselves to the utmost with axe and knife to cut and clear away the wreck of the masts, and repair damages.  Not the least energetic among them was our amateur first mate, Nigel Roy.  When all had been made comparatively snug, he went aft to where his father stood beside the steersman, with his legs nautically wide apart, his sou'-wester pulled well down over his frowning brows, and his hands in their native pockets.  \"This is a bad ending to a prosperous voyage,\" said the youth, sadly; \"but you don't seem to take it much to heart, father!\"  \"How much or little I take it to heart you know nothin' whatever about, my boy, seein' that I don't wear my heart on my coat-sleeve, nor yet on the point of my nose, for the inspection of all and sundry.  Besides, you can't tell whether it's a bad or a good endin', for it has not ended yet one way or another.  Moreover, what appears bad is often found to be good, an' what seems good is pretty often uncommon bad.\"  \"You are a walking dictionary of truisms, father!  I suppose you mean to take a philosophical view of the misfortune and make the best of it,\" said Nigel, with what we may style one of his twinkling smiles, for on nearly all occasions that young man's dark, brown eyes twinkled, in spite of him, as vigorously as any \"little star\" that was ever told in prose or song to do so--and much more expressively, too, because of the eyebrows of which little stars appear to be destitute.  \"No, lad,\" retorted the captain; \"I take a common-sense view--not a philosophical one; an' when you've bin as long at sea as I have, you'll call nothin' a misfortune until it's proved to be such.  The only misfortune I have at present is a son who cannot see things in the same light as his father sees 'em.\"  \"Well, then, according to your own principle that is the reverse of a misfortune, for if I saw everything in the same light that you do, you'd have no pleasure in talking to me, you'd have no occasion to reason me out of error, or convince me of truth.  Take the subject of poetry, now--\"  \"Luff;\" said Captain Roy, sternly, to the man at the wheel.  When the man at the wheel had gone through the nautical evolution involved in \"luff,\" the captain turned to his son and said abruptly--\"We'll run for the Cocos-Keelin' Islands, Nigel, an' refit.\"  \"Are the Keeling Islands far off?\"  \"Lift up your head and look straight along the bridge of your nose, lad, and you'll see them.  They're an interesting group, are the Keelin' Islands.  Volcanic, they are, with a coral top-dressin', so to speak. Sit down here an' I'll tell 'ee about 'em.\"  Nigel shut up the telescope through which he had been examining the thin, blue line on the horizon that indicated the islands in question, and sat down on the cabin skylight beside his father.  \"They've got a romantic history too, though a short one, an' are set like a gem on the bosom of the deep blue sea.\"  \"Come, father, you're drifting out of your true course--that's poetical!\"  \"I know it, lad, but I'm only quotin' your mother.  Well, you must know that the Keelin' Islands--we call them Keelin' for short--were uninhabited between fifty and sixty years ago, when a Scotsman named Ross, thinking them well situated as a port of call for the repair and provisioning of vessels on their way to Australia and China, set his heart on them and quietly took possession in the name of England.  Then he went home to fetch his wife and family of six children, intendin' to settle on the islands for good.  Returning in 1827 with the family and fourteen adventurers, twelve of whom were English, one a Portugee and one a Javanee, he found to his disgust that an Englishman named Hare had stepped in before him and taken possession.  This Hare was a very bad fellow; a rich man who wanted to live like a Rajah, with lots o' native wives and retainers, an' be a sort of independent prince.  Of course he was on bad terms at once with Ross, who, finding that things were going badly, felt that it would be unfair to hold his people to the agreement which was made when he thought the whole group was his own, so he offered to release them.  They all, except two men and one woman, accepted the release and went off in a gun-boat that chanced to touch there at the time.  For a good while Hare and his rival lived there--the one tryin' to get the Dutch, the other to induce the English Government to claim possession.  Neither Dutch nor English would do so at first, but the English did it at long last--in 1878--and annexed the islands to the Government of Ceylon.  \"Long before that date, however--before 1836--Hare left and went to Singapore, where he died, leaving Ross in possession--the `King of the Cocos Islands' as he came to be called.  In a few years--chiefly through the energy of Ross's eldest son, to whom he soon gave up the management of affairs--the Group became a prosperous settlement.  Its ships traded in cocoa-nuts, (the chief produce of the islands), throughout all the Straits Settlements, and boatbuildin' became one of their most important industries.  But there was one thing that prevented it from bein' a very happy though prosperous place, an' that was the coolies who had been hired in Java, for the only men that could be got there at first were criminals who had served their time in the chain-gangs of Batavia.  As these men were fit for anything--from pitch-and-toss to murder--and soon outnumbered the colonists, the place was kept in constant alarm and watchfulness.  For, as I dare say you know, the Malays are sometimes liable to have the spirit of _amok_ on them, which leads them to care for and fear nothin', and to go in for a fight-to-death, from which we get our sayin'--_run amuck_.  An' when a strong fellow is goin' about loose in this state o' mind, it's about as bad as havin' a tiger prowlin' in one's garden.  \"Well, sometimes two or three o' these coolies would mutiny and bide in the woods o' one o' the smaller uninhabited islands.  An' the colonists would have no rest till they hunted them down.  So, to keep matters right, they had to be uncommon strict.  It was made law that no one should spend the night on any but what was called the Home Island without permission.  Every man was bound to report himself at the guard-house at a fixed hour; every fire to be out at sunset, and every boat was numbered and had to be in its place before that time.  So they went on till the year 1862, when a disaster befell them that made a considerable change--at first for the worse, but for the better in the long-run.  Provin' the truth, my lad, of what I was--well, no--I was goin' to draw a moral here, but I won't!  \"It was a cyclone that did the business.  Cyclones have got a free-an'-easy way of makin' a clean sweep of the work of years in a few hours.  This cyclone completely wrecked the homes of the Keelin' Islanders, and Ross--that's the second Ross, the son of the first one-- sent home for _his_ son, who was then a student of engineering in Glasgow, to come out and help him to put things to rights.  Ross the third obeyed the call, like a good son,--observe that, Nigel.\"  \"All right, father, fire away!\"  \"Like a good son,\" repeated the captain, \"an' he turned out to be a first-rate man, which was lucky, for his poor father died soon after, leavin' him to do the work alone.  An' well able was the young engineer to do it.  He got rid o' the chain-gang men altogether, and hired none but men o' the best character in their place.  He cleared off the forests and planted the ground with cocoa-nut palms.  Got out steam mills, circular saws, lathes, etcetera, and established a system of general education with a younger brother as head-master--an' tail-master too, for I believe there was only one.  He also taught the men to work in brass, iron, and wood, and his wife--a Cocos girl that he married after comin' out--taught all the women and girls to sew, cook, and manage the house.  In short, everything went on in full swing of prosperity, till the year 1876, when the island-born inhabitants were about 500, as contented and happy as could be.  \"In January of that year another cyclone paid them a visit.  The barometer gave them warning, and, remembering the visit of fourteen years before, they made ready to receive the new visitor.  All the boats were hauled up to places of safety, and every other preparation was made.  Down it came, on the afternoon o' the 28th--worse than they had expected.  Many of the storehouses and mills had been lately renewed or built.  They were all gutted and demolished.  Everything movable was swept away like bits of paper.  Lanes, hundreds of yards in length, were cleared among the palm-trees by the whirling wind, which seemed to perform a demon-dance of revelry among them.  In some cases it snapped trees off close to the ground.  In others it seemed to swoop down from above, lick up a patch of trees bodily and carry them clean away, leaving the surrounding trees untouched.  Sometimes it would select a tree of thirty years growth, seize it, spin it round, and leave it a permanent spiral screw.  I was in these regions about the time, and had the account from a native who had gone through it all and couldn't speak of it except with glaring eyeballs and gasping breath.  \"About midnight of the 28th the gale was"]]]
