Go ahead, my dear, and invest your money in something where moth and rust will not corrupt and where thieves will not break through and steal.\"  \"Oh, Uncle Peter, I am so glad to hear you say that. I haven't any blood kin to go to for advice and Danny always says for me to do exactly what I want to do, which is bad for my character. It might make me very conceited to have him always insist that I'm right just because I want to do something.\"  \"Well, well! The young rascal is right,\" laughed Mr. Conant.  \"But do you think Grandpa Jim would approve of what I am doing?\"  \"Surely he would. I haven't a doubt if you had not been in existence he would have done much the same sort of thing with his fortune. Jim Hathaway was a powerful charitable man.\"  Mary Louise then went to see Dr. Weston at his office in the dingy little building that housed the Children's Home Society. The old man slept on a bumpy couch in the corner of his office. He had been assigned a bedroom in the house, but the association had grown beyond its quarters and the devoted doctor had long ago given up his room as an overflow dormitory for the constantly increasing number of little children who were sent to the home to be kept there until some kind person saw fit to adopt them.  Dr. Weston's life had been dedicated to social work and now in his old age the thing which interested him most and to which he gave all his strength and time was the placing of unfortunate children in good homes. It was through his labor and influence the Children's Home Society had been established and struggled for existence. He was hampered in his work by an unwieldy board of women managers, but he realized the importance of having a large board, because the more persons interested the more money it was possible to raise for his pet charity. At the time of Mary Louise's call funds were very low, so low that it seemed as though the society might have to close its hospitable doors to the homeless waifs and the present inmates be parceled out to the various orphan asylums. The board was to meet that very day. Dr. Weston always dreaded a board meeting. There were some fine, noble women on his board, but also some interfering busy-bodies, who were always starting disagreeable discussions, such as how much sugar a little child should be allowed and how important it was that vanity should not be encouraged in the girls.  Business and finance were not Dr. Weston's strong points. His only idea was to gather in the little children and give them a home in the society until better homes could be found for them. He wanted to make the place as little like an institution as possible, but several members of the board were for unrelenting law and prison order.  The old man sat with his head in his hands worrying over the affairs of the home. He was aware of the fact that funds were low and needs were increasing. The home needed another nurse and a higher-priced cook, who would prepare the food with more care than the present slatternly incumbent. It needed several hospital wards, where children could be isolated when attacked by contagious diseases. The doctor had known his family, varying from thirty to fifty, all down at one time with bad colds, or coryza, as named by the medical profession, when isolating the first small cougher and sneezer might have saved all of the others.  \"If only that young Mrs. Dexter, Jim Hathaway's granddaughter, would make us a small donation,\" he groaned. \"No doubt she could well afford it, but young folks are mighty thoughtless. She seemed interested in the children but I fancy that will be all--just a sentimental interest and no more.\"  A tap on the door and Mary Louise entered as though in answer to his thoughts.  \"I have come to see if I might help, Dr. Weston,\" she said simply.    CHAPTER II THE BOARD ELECTS NEW MEMBERS  As Mary Louise seated herself in Dr. Weston's shabby office Josie entered and was introduced.  \"Miss O'Gorman is an especial friend of mine, Dr. Weston, and I have asked her to come here because she also is interested in your home.\"  \"Fine! There can't be too many interested in my home,\" exclaimed the old man, a light coming in his eyes. \"I say _my_ home just because I am so interested in it, but it is in reality under the control of the board. You say you want to help some?\" he asked with eagerness.  \"Yes, sir! I have been thinking over the matter and have decided that this undertaking of all others appeals to me most and I should like to give my old home. You know the old Hathaway house, do you not?\"  \"Yes, yes!\" There was excitement in Dr. Weston's tone.  \"It is too big for me to live in and I think my grandfather would be glad to know that many little children are finding a temporary home there,\" said Mary Louise. \"There is a great deal of furniture there, too, much of which would be suitable, and a lovely great yard and pretty garden where the kiddies can play.\"  \"Oh, my dear, you make an old man very happy!\"  \"I want to make an endowment, too,\" Mary Louise continued, \"enough with the subscriptions you already control to take care of the children as they should be taken care of.\"  The tears were rolling down Dr. Weston's cheeks, then he laughed. \"What a bomb I can throw in the camp when the board meets this morning! I dreaded their coming but now--now--\"  \"Who is on your board?\" asked Josie practically.  Dr. Weston began naming them over.  \"Humph!\" was all Josie said, but that \"humph\" was eloquent.  Many of the names were known to the girls. It was a varied list composed of good, bad and indifferent personalities, from the viewpoint of the social worker.  \"Mrs. Opie is a fine open-hearted woman,\" said Josie, \"and Mrs. McGraw is good nature itself and most generous. Mrs. Wright is a great worker and manager--\" Josie shrugged her shoulders without finishing her sentence.  \"Yes!\" breathed Dr. Weston with an eloquent sigh. \"A good woman, a good woman, but something of a--a--boss!\"  \"You mean Elizabeth's mother?\" asked Mary Louise. \"Grandpa Jim used to call her Kaiser Wright, but that was before we went into the war. He said she could be the head of an absolute monarchy and run all the affairs of state and see to it that the kitchen maids washed out the tea towels after every meal. She is on every charitable and club board in town and at the same time is a most strenuous housekeeper and has a hand in the making of the clothes of her entire family.\"  \"A wonderful woman! A wonderful woman!\" exclaimed Dr. Weston, but there was that in his tone that gave Mary Louise and Josie to understand that he was glad there were not many \"wonderful women\" on the board of the Children's Home Society.  \"The board meets in a few minutes,\" continued the old man. \"It is now beginning to assemble in the parlor. I hope you young ladies can remain until I can inform the ladies of the generous gift in store for our home. I am the sole and unworthy representative of my sex on the board.\"  \"Of course we can wait,\" declared Josie. \"Who is the president of your organization?\"  \"Mrs. Trescott is chairman but--\"  \"She doesn't stay in it?\" laughed Josie.  \"I won't say that,\" smiled the doctor. \"Never tell tales out of the board. Ill return in a few moments. I can't tell you the happiness I feel in being able to inform these ladies of our good fortune.\"  The board was trying to get in session. The girls, waiting in the office, could hear a steady hum of conversation with an occasional sharp rap of the gavel when the president evidently had something to say herself.  \"Sounds more like an afternoon tea than the deliberations of an august body,\" said Josie.  But at last the meeting was called to order, the minutes were read, the treasurer's report made and the various committees called on for a reckoning. All this was accomplished with much talk and many interruptions. The treasurer's report brought forth a groan. There was little money left in the treasury and much was needed in the way of equipment.  \"I see nothing for it but to give up,\" said one lugubrious member. \"Dorfield doesn't take enough interest to support the home and so there's an end of it.\"  \"That would come under new business,\" suggested the president. \"We must get through with what is on the carpet first,\" consulting a small book on parliamentary law.  \"Well, there is no use in staying here if we are going to have to give up,\" spake the lugubrious one. \"All of this talk is foolish if we are going to disband.\"  \"Disband, nothing!\" broke in Mrs. Wright, whose hands were busily employed knitting a sweater for one of her girls while her eyes were glancing from person to person. Her foot tapped constantly while her knitting needles flew. One felt that she was doing some kind of work with that tapping foot.  \"Disband, indeed!\" she whispered sibilantly. \"We'll have a tag day and a rummage sale and I'll get up a dicker party and some theatricals. Disband, indeed!\"  At last Dr. Weston was allowed to speak.  \"Ladies,\" he said, \"I mean Madame President, I have to report to the board--\"  \"Not another case of measles, I trust!\" interrupted one.  \"No, not a case of measles, but a case that I hope is going to prove quite as contagious--\"  \"Mumps, I'll be bound!\"  \"No, madame! We have had a gift for the home--\"  \"More old faded carpets and carved walnut furniture, I wager!\"  Finally Dr. Weston was able to divulge to the board of managers that Mary Louise Burrows, Jim Hathaway's granddaughter, now Mrs. Danny Dexter, intended to hand over to them her grandfather's old home.  Mary Louise and Josie in the next room with the door closed were able to tell exactly the moment when the news was broken. Such a hubbub ensued that the doctor's voice was quite drowned out.  \"And now, ladies,\" continued Dr. Weston, \"since we have several vacancies on our board, I think we could not do better than to ask Mrs. Dexter to fill one of those vacancies and her friend Miss Josie"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22532"],["title","Mary Louise and Josie O'Gorman (#2)"],["body","'Gorman one of the others.\"  There was much hemming and hawing at this proposition.  \"Too young!\" was the general verdict, but Dr. Weston declared that Mary Louise was not too young to give her property to the home, and then he hinted wisely of other things she might give. The astute old man was a good judge of human nature, especially human nature as exemplified by a board of women managers. He had held back the fact that Mary Louise also intended to endow the home. He was determined to have her put on the board first, and also her clever little friend, who had such a quiet way of hitting the nail on the head.  With the air of conferring on Mary Louise and Josie a tremendous favor they were finally elected to the board.  \"But who is this Josie O'Gorman?\" asked a smartly dressed woman, \"and why? Isn't she a kind of a washerwoman?\"  \"Hush!\" admonished another. \"Don't you know she is in the Higgledy-Piggledy Shop with Elizabeth Wright?\"  The secretary was requested to inform the two young women of the honor conferred upon them.  \"They are in my office,\" said Dr. Weston, \"and I might just step in and tell them myself.\"  \"Oh, horrors!\" cried one of the women. \"Do you suppose they heard what we said?\"  \"I never said anything but that they were too young. Nobody could object to that.\"  \"And I said board work might prove too arduous for them.\"  \"And I said our board was too big as it was.\"  \"I was for them all the time.\"  \"And I!\"  \"And I!\"    CHAPTER III MARY LOUISE TELLS A STORY  The members of the board need not have concerned themselves in regard to the waiting girls. Josie and Mary Louise had been fully occupied. At the moment that the hubbub had arisen, marking the time when Dr. Weston had made his announcement, there had been a sharp tap on the office door. Josie had opened the door and there had entered a woman and two children, a girl of eight and a boy of about six. The girl carried a badly wrapped bundle of clothes.  Mary Louise and Josie felt a keen interest in all three. The woman was young--under thirty. She was handsome, with raven black hair and well-cut features. Her face was pale and her eyes gloomy. She carried herself with a slow, lazy grace. The good lines of her tall figure asserted themselves in spite of the cheap, ill-fitting serge suit. Josie always noticed hands and feet, because she declared they were more difficult to disguise than any other portion of one's anatomy. One glance at the woman's ungloved hands made Josie wonder at the well-kept nails and dimpled knuckles.  \"No horny-handed daughter of toil, at least,\" was her mental note. She then instinctively glanced at the woman's feet.  \"Too well shod for the serge suit,\" was her verdict, \"high arched triple A with French heels, about a five, which is small for a person of her height. She must be at least five feet, ten inches.\"  This inventory took Josie the fraction of a second, so quick was she to see and pigeon-hole her observations in her well-ordered brain.  The children had evidently been crying. The girl's eyes and nose were red and the boy at intervals gave a dry sob as though he had been through a storm of weeping and could with difficulty stop. They clung to each other as they would had they been drowning. The woman pushed them into the room. The children's clothes were the worse for wear, and untidy. Their faces were dirty and showed signs of grimy little knuckles having been dug into streaming eyes. The eyes of both children were blue, as blue as cornflowers, and their hair very light, the boy's curling in tight rings but the girl's straight and bobbed.  \"I want to see the manager,\" said the woman in a well-modulated voice.  \"Dr. Weston will be here in a few minutes,\" said Mary Louise. \"Won't you sit down?\"  The young woman sank into a chair. She paid no attention to the children, but Josie found them a seat on a bench by the window. The little girl lifted the boy to the bench and put her arm around his shoulders, drawing him close to her sisterly bosom.  \"Quite warm today,\" said Josie to the woman.  Mary Louise could with difficulty keep from giggling. It was so foreign to Josie's character to discuss the weather.  \"Think so?\" answered the woman shortly.  \"Not so warm as it was yesterday, but still a little unseasonable,\" persisted Josie. \"I find a suit quite warm, but then, what is one to wear?\"  Mary Louise listened in amazement. Josie talking weather and clothes! She had reduced the problem of dress to a science and having done so dismissed the matter from her mind. As for the weather, she had frequently declared that all weather was good if one just accepted it.  \"Clothes are getting a little cheaper than they were last spring,\" she chattered on, \"almost pre-war prices at Temple & Sweet's this week. Charming georgette blouses for a mere song and shoes at a great bargain if one wears a narrow last.\"  The woman was plainly interested.  \"Temple & Sweet's?\" she murmured, and her glance instinctively fell on her own well-turned arch and narrow toe.  Suddenly the little boy's sobs got the better of him and he wept convulsively. His sister hugged him more closely and with the hem of her skirt wiped his eyes. She shook her own tow head and her blue eyes snapped dangerously as the woman said roughly: \"Stop your bawling!\"  \"Peter, dear, please!\" she whispered, but Peter could not stop. Mary Louise went over and sat on the bench by the children.  \"You mustn't cry, my boy,\" she said gently. \"Whatever troubles you I am sure will come out right. Look out of the window at that robin. Isn't he busy? Do you know what he is doing? He is building his nest. There is his wife. She is going to help him. What a good little wife she is! She thinks it is better to help because her husband is always stopping and singing. There he goes now! A cunning little teasing song the robin sings. I love to hear him in the spring. He always sounds so gay and cheery. Do you know what will happen when they get the nest built?\"  \"Wha-at?\" sobbed the boy. The tears had ceased and the sobs were almost under control.  \"The little wife bird will lay four beautiful eggs. They will be a greenish blue, the blue that people call robin's egg blue. And then she will stay patiently on her nest for many days keeping those eggs nice and warm, only leaving her nest for something to eat and a drink of water and when she is off, her husband, if he can stop singing long enough, will keep the eggs warm for her, and by and by the pretty blue shells will crack and inside them will be the most ridiculous-looking little creatures you ever saw, all mouth at first, with no feathers at all, and those mouths will always be stretched wide open like this,\" and Mary Louise stretched her pretty mouth as wide as nature would allow. The boy laughed and his sister smiled contentedly.  Mary Louise resumed, in her pleasant voice:  \"Then such a business! Mother and Father Robin will be working every minute of daylight to try and fill those hungry mouths. Poor little worms will be afraid to show their noses or their tails because there will be a robin ready to peck them up and carry them off to their babies. Those little birds will eat so much that by and by they will begin to grow feathers and they will be pretty and fluffy and two of them will take after their father and have very red breasts and two of them will take after their mother and have just a delicate shade of red on their breasts. And after those little birds get all covered with feathers and their wings begin to grow strong Father Robin will say to Mother Robin, 'See here, my dear, it is time these young rascals learned how to fly and to grub for themselves.' That will make Mother Robin sad, because she hates for her babies to grow up and have to leave her.\"  \"O--h!\" in a long-drawn sigh from the little girl. \"Do you think she feels that way? How wonderful?\"  \"Of course she does; at least she will,\" smiled Mary Louise.  \"Go on!\" commanded Peter. \"Polly, don't interrupt! Will they leave their nice house--I mean nest?\"  Josie silently noted the speech of the children. \"From the South!\" was her verdict. \"Soft slurred r's and the way the boy says house would give them away.\"  \"Yes,\" continued Mary Louise, \"some pleasant morning in June, perhaps, they will awaken very early and their mother and father will get busy catching the early worm for their breakfast. You see, nobody must ever try to do anything very important, like learning to fly, on an empty stomach.\"  \"That's what I been a-tellin' Polly; but go on, please.\"  \"Then, when they are all fed and full and happy, Mother Robin balances herself on the side of the nest and spreads her wings and says 'Now, children, watch me!' and she floats down to the ground.\"  \"From away up in the tree tops?\"  \"No, not so high up, because you see robins build in high bushes and hedges, but it will seem very far to the little birds, as high as the top of trees and even church steeples would seem to you.\"  \"But if my mother would say, 'Come on, Peter, and jump off the church steeple, I'm a-gonter do it. I wouldn't feel 'fraid--not a mite, not if my mo--\" But he could not finish the word mother. A realization of something came over him and again his lip trembled and he seemed on the verge of more tears and sobs.  \"And then the little birds,\" continued Mary Louise quickly, trying to keep the tears from her own sweet eyes, \"they will look over the edge of the nest and see their mother hopping around on the soft green grass, and maybe they will see her catch a nice fat wiggly worm and, wonder of wonders! and horror of horrors! instead of flying back to the nest to give it to one of her babies she will gobble it up her own self. That won't be because she is a greedy mother, but just to let them realize that if they get down on the grass they can find plenty of delicious worms for themselves. Then Father Robin will tell them they are all little cry-babies not to jump up and fly from the nest, and one by one "]]]
