We're more advanced now.\"  Dr. Braun said softly, \"My father fought against Geronimo in Arizona. It wasn't so long ago as all that.\"  Ross Wooley felt the argument going against him and lashed back. \"We've been over and over this, what's your point?\"  Patricia said doggedly, \"The same point I tried to make from the beginning. This discovery must not be generally released. We'll simply have to suppress it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The door opened behind them. They turned. Nothing was there. Ross, scowling, lumbered to his feet to walk over and close it.  \"Hey, take it easy,\" a voice laughed. \"Don't walk right into a guy.\"  Ross stopped, startled.  Dr. Braun and Patricia stood up and stared, too.  Crowley laughed. \"You all look like you're seeing a ghost.\"  Ross rumbled a grudging chuckle. \"It'd be all right if we _saw_ the ghost, it's not seeing you that's disconcerting.\"  The air began to shimmer, somewhat like heat on the desert's face.  Crowley said, \"Hey, the stuff's wearing off. Where're my clothes?\"  \"Where you left them. There in that bedroom,\" Ross said. \"We'll wait for you.\" He went back and rejoined his associates. The door to the bedroom opened, there was a shimmering, more obvious now, and then the door closed behind it.  \"He rejoined us just in time,\" Dr. Braun murmured. \"Another ten minutes and he would have ... umah ... _materialized_ down on the street.\"  Ross hadn't finished the discussion. He said, his face in all but pout, \"What you don't realize, Pat, is the world has gone beyond the point where scientific discoveries can be suppressed. If we try to keep the lid on this today, the Russians or Chinese, or somebody, will hit on it tomorrow.\"  Patricia said impatiently, \"Good heavens, let's don't bring the Cold War into it.\"  Ross opened his mouth to snap something back at her, closed it again and shrugged his bulky shoulders angrily.  In a matter of less than ten minutes the bedroom door reopened and this time a grinning Crowley emerged, fully dressed. He said, \"Man, that was a devil of an experience!\"  They saw him to a chair and had him talk it all through. He was candid enough, bubbling over with it all.  In the some eleven and a half hours he'd been on his own, he had covered quite an area of Manhattan.  Evidently the first hour had been spent in becoming used to the startling situation. He couldn't even see himself, which, to his surprise affected walking and even use of his hands. You had to get used to it. Then there was the fact that he was nude and _felt_ nude and hence uncomfortable walking about in mixed pedestrian traffic. But that phase passed. Early in the game he found that there was small percentage in getting into crowds. It led to all sorts of complications, including the starting of minor rows, one person thinking another was pushing when it was simply a matter of Crowley trying to get out from underfoot.  Then he went through a period of the wonder of it all. Being able to walk _anywhere_ and observe people who had no suspicion that they were being observed. It was during that phase that he had sought out the hotel in which he had read the chesty French movie actress Brigette Loren was in residence. Evidently, he'd hit the nail right on the head. Brigette was at her toilette when he arrived on scene. In telling about this, Crowley leered amusedly at Patricia from the side of his eyes. She ignored him.  Then he'd gone through a period when the full realization of his immunity had hit him.  At this point he turned to Braun, \"Hey, Doc, you ever eaten any caviar? You know, that Russian stuff. Supposed to be the most expensive food in the world.\"  The doctor cleared his throat. \"Small amounts in hors d'oeuvres at cocktail parties.\"  \"Well, maybe I'm just a country boy but the stuff tastes like fish eggs to me. Anyway, to get back to the story....\"  He'd gone into Tiffany's and into some of the other swank shops. And then into a bank or two, and stared at the treasures of Manhattan.  At this point he looked at Ross. \"You know, just being invisible don't mean all that. How you going to pick up a wad of thousand dollar bills and just walk out the front door with them? Everybody'd see the dough just kind of floating through the air.\"  \"I came to the same conclusion myself, when I experimented,\" Ross said wryly.  He had ridden on the subways ... free. He had eaten various food in various swank restaurants. He had even had drinks in name bars, sampling everything from Metaxa to vintage champagne. He was of the opinion that even though he remained invisible for the rest of his years, he'd still stick to bourbon and beer.  [Illustration]  He had gone down to Wall Street and into the offices of the top brokerage firms and into the sanctum sanctorums of the wealthiest of mucky-mucks but had been too impatient to stick around long enough to possibly hear something that might be profitable. He admitted, grudgingly, that he wouldn't have known what to listen for anyway. Frustrated there, he had gone back uptown and finally located the hangout of one of the more renown sports promoters who was rumored to have gangster connections and was currently under bail due to a boxing scandal. He had stayed about that worthy's office for an hour, gleaning nothing more than several dirty jokes he'd never heard before.  All this activity had wearied him so he went to the Waldorf, located an empty suite in the tower and climbed into bed for a nap after coolly phoning room service to give him a call in two hours. That had almost led to disaster. Evidently, someone on room service had found the suite to be supposedly empty and had sent a boy up to investigate. However, when he had heard the door open, Crowley had merely rolled out of the bed and left, leaving a startled bellhop behind staring at rumpled bedclothes which had seemed to stir of their own accord.         *       *       *  The rest of the day was little different from the first hours. He had gone about gawking in places he couldn't have had he been visible. Into the dressing room of the Roxie, into the bars of swank private clubs, into the offices of the F.B.I. He would have liked to have walked in on a poker game with some real high rollers playing, such as Nick the Greek, but he didn't have the time nor know-how to go about finding one.  Crowley wound it all up with a gesture of both hands, palms upward. \"I gotta admit, it was fun, but what the devil good is it?\"  They looked at him questioningly.  Crowley said, \"I mean, how's it practical? How can you make a buck out of it, if you turn it over to the public, like? Everybody'd go around robbing everybody else and you'd all wind up equal.\"  Dr. Braun chuckled in deprecation. \"There would be various profitable uses, Don. One priceless one would be scientific observation of wild life. For that matter there would be valid usage in everyday life. There are often personal reasons for not wishing to be observed. Celebrities, for instance, wishing to avoid crowds.\"  \"Yeah,\" Crowley laughed, \"or a businessman out with his secretary.\"  Dr. Braun frowned. \"Of course, there are many other aspects. It would mean the end of such things as the Iron Curtain. And also the end of such things as American immigration control. There are many, many ramifications, Don, some of which frighten us. The world would be never quite the same.\"  Crowley leaned forward confidentially. \"Well, I'll tell you. I was thinking it all out. What we got to do is turn it over to the Army and soak them plenty for it.\"  The others ignored his cutting himself a piece of the cake.  Ross Wooley merely grunted bitterly.  Patricia said impatiently, \"We've thought most of these things through, Don. However, Dr. Braun happens to be quite a follower of Lord Russell.\"  Crowley looked at her blankly.  \"He's a pacifist,\" she explained.  Braun pushed his glasses back more firmly on his nose and said, gently, \"The military already have enough gadgets to destroy quite literally everything and I trust one set of them no more than the other. If _both_ sides had our discovery, then, very well, each would go about attempting to find some manner of penetrating the invisibility, or taking various measures to protect their top secrets. But to give it to just one would be such an advantage that the other would have to embark immediately upon a desperate attack before the advantage could be fully realized. If we turn this over to the Pentagon, for exclusive use, the Soviets would have to begin a preventative war as soon as they learned of its existence.\"  \"You a red?\" Crowley said, scowling.  The doctor shrugged hopelessly. \"No,\" he said.  Crowley turned to the other two. \"If you think it's the patriotic thing to do, why don't one of you sell it to the government?\"  Patricia said testily, \"You don't understand, Don. Even if we were so thoroughly in disagreement that we would act unilaterally, we couldn't. You see, this is a three-way discovery. No one of us knows the complete process.\"  His face twisted. \"Look, maybe some of this egghead stuff doesn't get through to me but I'm not stupid, see? You got the stuff, haven't you? You gave me that shot this morning.\"  Braun took over, saying reasonably, \"Don, this discovery was hit upon by accident. The three of us are employed in the laboratories of a medical research organization. I am the department head. Patricia and Ross were doing some routine work on a minor problem when they separately stumbled upon some rather startling effects, practically at the same time. Each, separately, brought their discoveries to me, and, working you might say intuitively, I added some conclusions of my own, and ... well, I repeat, the discovery was stumbled upon.\"  Crowley assimilated that. \"None of you knows how to do it, make those injections like, by himself?\"  \"That is correct. Each knows just one phase of the process. Each must combine"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23197"],["title","Subversive (#1)"],["body"," a bar?_ They can't manufacture it for that. Will the stuff pass the Health Department?\"  \"Evidently,\" Tracy said wryly. \"The salesman claimed it's the same soap as reputable firms peddle.\"  \"Go on.\"  \"We had to go to a bit of trouble to get a line on them without raising their suspicion. One of the boys lived in a neighborhood that was being canvassed for new customers and his wife had signed up. So I took her place when the salesman arrived with her first delivery--they deliver the first batch. I let him think I was Bob Coty and questioned him, but not enough to raise his suspicions.\"  \"And?\"  \"An outfit selling soap and planning on branching into bread and heavens knows what else. No advertising. No middlemen. No nothing, as the salesman said, except standard soap at three cents a bar.\"  \"They can't package it for that!\"  \"They don't package it at all.\"  The Chief raised his chubby right hand and wiped it over his face in a stereotype gesture of resignation. \"Did you get his home office address? Maybe there's some way of buying them out--indirectly, of course.\"  \"No, sir. It seemed to be somewhat of a secret.\"  The other's eyes widened. \"Ridiculous. You can't hide anything like that. There's a hundred ways of tracking them down before the day is out.\"  \"Of course. I've got Jerome Wiseman following him in a helio-jet. No use getting rough, as yet. We'll keep it quiet ... assuming that meets with your approval.\"  \"You're in the field, Frank. You make the decisions.\"  The phone screen had lighted up and LaVerne's piquant face faded in. \"The call Mr. Tracy was expecting from Operative Wiseman.\"  \"Put him on,\" the Chief said, lacing his plump fingers over his stomach.  Jerry's face appeared in the screen. He was obviously parked on the street now. He said, \"Subject has disappeared into this office building, Tracy. For the past fifteen minutes he's kinda looked as though the day's work was through and since this dump could hardly be anybody's home, he must be reporting to his higher-up.\"  \"Let's see the building,\" Tracy said.  The portable screen was directed in such manner that a disreputable appearing building, obviously devoted to fourth-rate businesses, was centered.  \"O.K.,\" Tracy said. \"I'll be over. You can knock off, Jerry. Oh, except for one thing. Subject's name is Warren Dickens. Just for luck, get a complete dossier on him. I doubt if he's got a criminal or subversive record, but you never know.\"  Jerry said, \"Right,\" and faded.  Frank Tracy came to his feet and knocked the rest of his pipe out into the gigantic ashtray on his boss' desk. \"Well, I suppose the next step's mine.\"  \"Check back with me as soon as you know anything more,\" the Chief said. He wheezed a sigh as though sorry the interview was over and that he'd have to go back to his desk chores, but shifted his bulk and took up a sheaf of papers.  Just as Tracy got to the door, the Chief said, \"Oh, yes. Easy on the rough stuff, Tracy. I've been hearing some disquieting reports about some of the overenthusiastic bullyboys on your team. We wouldn't want such material to get in the telly-casts.\"  _Lard bottom_, Tracy growled inwardly as he left. Did the Chief think he liked violence? Did anyone in his right mind like violence?         *       *       *  Frank Tracy looked up at the mid-century type office building. He was somewhat surprised that the edifice still remained. Where did the owners ever find profitable tenants? What business could be so small these days that it would be based in such quarters? However, here it was.  The lobby was shabby. There was no indication on the list of tenants of the firm he was seeking, nor was there a porter. The elevator was out of repair.  He did it the hard way, going from door to door, entering, hat in hand, apologetically, and saying, \"Pardon me. You're the people who sell the soap?\" They kept telling him no until he reached the third floor and a door to an office even smaller than usual. It was lettered _Freer Enterprises_ and even as he knocked and entered, the wording rang a bell.  There was only one desk but it was efficiently equipped with the latest in office gadgetry. The room was quite choked with files and even a Mini-IBM tri-unit. The man behind the desk was old-fashioned enough to wear glasses, but otherwise seemed the average aggressive executive type you expected to meet in these United States of the Americas. He was possibly in his mid-thirties and one of those alert, over-eager characters irritating to those who believe in taking matters less than urgently.  He looked up and said snappily, \"What can I do for you?\"  Tracy dropped into an easy-going characterization. \"You're the people who sell the soap?\"  \"That is correct. What can I do for you?\"  Tracy said easily, \"Why, I'd like to ask you a few questions about the enterprise.\"  \"To what end, sir? You'd be surprised how busy a man I am.\"  Tracy said, \"Suppose I'm from the Greater New York _News-Times_ looking for a story?\"  The other tapped a finger on his desk impatiently. \"Pardon me, but in that case I would be inclined to think you a liar. The _News-Times_ knows upon which side its bread is spread. Its advertisers include all the soap companies. It does not dispense free advertising through its news columns.\"  Tracy chuckled wryly, \"All right. Let's start again.\" He brought forth his wallet, flicked through various identification cards until he found the one he wanted and presented it. \"Frank Tracy is the name,\" he said. \"Department of Internal Revenue. There seems to be some question as to your corporation taxes.\"  \"Oh,\" the other said, obviously taken aback. \"Please have a chair.\" He read the authentic looking, but spurious credentials. Tracy took the proffered chair and then sat and looked at the other as though it was his turn.  \"My name is Flowers,\" the Freer Enterprises man told him, nervously. \"Frederic Flowers. Frankly, this is my first month at the job and I'm not too well acquainted with all the ramifications of the business.\" He moistened his lips. \"I hope there is nothing illegal--\" He let the sentence fade away.  Tracy reclaimed his false identity papers and put them back into his wallet before saying easily, \"I really couldn't say, as yet. Let's have a bit of questions and answers and I'll go further into the matter.\"  Flowers regained his confidence. \"No reason why not,\" he said quickly. \"So far as I know, all is above board.\"  Frank Tracy let his eyes go about the room. \"Why are you established, almost secretly, you might say, in this business backwoods of the city?\"  \"No secret about it,\" Flowers demurred. \"Merely the cheapest rent we could find. We cut costs to the bone, and then shave the bone.\"  \"Um-m-m. I've spoken to one of your salesmen, a Warren Dickens, and I suppose he gave me the standard sales talk. I wonder if you could elaborate on your company's policies, its goals, that sort of thing.\"  \"Goals?\"  \"You obviously expect to make money, somehow or other, though I don't see that peddling soap at three cents a bar has much of a future. There must be some further angle.\"  Flowers said, \"Admittedly, soap is just a beginning. Among other things, it's given us a mailing list of satisfied customers. Consumers who can then be approached for future purchases.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Frank Tracy relaxed in his chair, reached for pipe and tobacco and let the other go on. But his eyes had narrowed, coldly.  Flowers wrapped himself up in his subject. \"Mr. Tracy, you probably have no idea of the extent to which the citizens of Greater America are being victimized. Let me use but one example.\" He came quickly to his feet, crossed to a small toilet which opened off the office and returned with a power-pack electric shaver which he handed to Tracy.  Tracy looked at it, put it back on the desk and nodded. \"It's the brand I have,\" he said agreeably.  \"Yes, and millions of others. What did you pay for it?\"  Frank Tracy allowed himself a slight smirk. \"As a matter of fact, I got mine through a discount outfit, only twenty-five dollars.\"  \"_Only_ twenty-five dollars, eh, when the retail price is supposedly thirty-five?\" Flowers was triumphant. \"A great bargain, eh? Well, let me give you a rundown, Mr. Tracy.\"  He took a quick breath. \"True, they're advertised to retail at thirty-five dollars. And stores that sell them at that rate make a profit of fifty per cent. The regional supply house, before them, knocks down from forty to sixty per cent, on the wholesale price. Then the trade name distributor makes at least fifty per cent on the sales to the regional supply houses.\"  \"Trade name distributor?\" Tracy said, as though ignorant of what the other was talking about. \"You mean the manufacturer?\"  \"No, sir. That razor you just looked at bears a trade name of a company that owns no factory of its own. It buys the razors from a large electrical appliances manufacturing complex which turns out several other name brand electric razors as well. The trade name company does nothing except market the product. Its budget, by the way, calls for an expenditure of six dollars on every razor for national advertising.\"  \"Well, what are you getting at?\" Tracy said impatiently.  Frederic Flowers had reached his punch line. \"All right, we've traced the razor all the way back to the manufacturing complex which made it. Mr. Tracy, that razor you bought at a discount bargain for twenty-five dollars cost thirty-eight cents to produce.\"  Tracy pretended to be dumfounded. \"I don't believe it.\"  \"It can be proven.\"  Frank Tracy thought about it for a while. \"Well, even if true, so what?\"  \"It's a crime, that's so-what,\" Flowers blurted indignantly. \"And that's where Freer Enterprises comes in. Very shortly, we're going to enter the market with an electric razor retailing for exactly one dollar. No name brand, no advertising, no nothing except a razor just as good as though selling for from twenty-five to fifty dollars.\"  Tracy"]]]
