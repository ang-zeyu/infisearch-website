I believe that, with all my limitations, I can tell my fellow-countrymen things about the history of America which they do not know. It would be absurd effrontery to pretend that I can tell Americans what they do not know. For them, whatever interest this book may possess must depend upon the value of a foreigner's interpretation of the facts. I know that I should be extraordinarily interested in an American's view of the story of England since the Separation; and I can only hope that some degree of such interest may attach to these pages in American eyes.  It will be obvious to Americans that in some respects my view of their history is individual. For instance, I give Andrew Jackson both a greater place in the development of American democracy and a higher meed of personal praise than do most modern American historians and writers whom I have read. I give my judgment for what it is worth. In my view, the victory of Jackson over the Whigs was the turning-point of American history and finally decided that the United States should be a democracy and not a parliamentary oligarchy. And I am further of opinion that, both as soldier and ruler, \"Old Hickory\" was a hero of whom any nation might well be proud.  I am afraid that some offence may be given by my portrait of Charles Sumner. I cannot help it. I do not think that between his admirers and myself there is any real difference as to the kind of man he was. It is a kind that some people revere. It is a kind that I detest--absolutely leprous scoundrels excepted--more than I can bring myself to detest any other of God's creatures.

The islands on which Columbus first landed and the adjacent stretch of mainland from Mexico to Patagonia which the Spaniards who followed him colonized lay outside the territory which is now known as the United States. Nevertheless the instinct of the American democracy has always looked back to him as a sort of ancestor, and popular American tradition conceives of him as in some shadowy fashion a founder. And that instinct and tradition, like most such national instincts and traditions, is sound.  In the epoch which most of us can remember pretty vividly--for it came to an abrupt end less than five years ago--when people were anxious to prove that everything important in human history had been done by \"Teutons,\" there was a great effort to show that Columbus was not really the first European discoverer of America; that that honour belonged properly to certain Scandinavian sea-captains who at some time in the tenth or eleventh centuries paid a presumably piratical visit to the coast of Greenland. It may be so, but the incident is quite irrelevant. That one set of barbarians from the fjords of Norway came in their wanderings in contact with another set of barbarians living in the frozen lands north of Labrador is a fact, if it be a fact, of little or no historical import. The Vikings had no more to teach the Esquimaux than had the Esquimaux to teach the Vikings. Both were at that time outside the real civilization of Europe.  Columbus, on the other hand, came from the very centre of European civilization and that at a time when that civilization was approaching the summit of one of its constantly recurrent periods of youth and renewal. In the North, indeed, what strikes the eye in the fifteenth century is rather the ugliness of a decaying order--the tortures, the panic of persecution, the morbid obsession of the _danse macabre_--things which many think of as Medi√¶val, but which belong really only to the Middle Ages when old and near to death. But all the South was already full of the new youth of the Renaissance. Boccaccio had lived, Leonardo was at the height of his glory. In the fields of Touraine was already playing with his fellows the boy that was to be Rabelais.  Such adventures as that of Columbus, despite his pious intentions with regard to the Khan of Tartary, were a living part of the Renaissance and were full of its spirit, and it is from the Renaissance that American civilization dates. It is an important point to remember about America, and especially about the English colonies which were to become the United States, that they have had no memory of the Middle Ages. They had and have, on the other hand, a real, formative memory of Pagan antiquity, for the age in which the oldest of them were born was full of enthusiasm for that memory, while it thought, as most Americans still think, of the Middle Ages as a mere feudal barbarism.  Youth and adventurousness were not the only notes of the Renaissance, nor the only ones which we shall see affecting the history of America. Another note was pride, and with that pride in its reaction against the old Christian civilization went a certain un-Christian scorn of poverty and still more of the ugliness and ignorance which go with poverty; and there reappeared--to an extent at least, and naturally most of all where the old religion had been completely lost--that naked Pagan repugnance which almost refused to recognize a human soul in the barbarian. It is notable that in these new lands which the Renaissance had thrown open to European men there at once reappears that institution which had once been fundamental to Europe and which the Faith had slowly and with difficulty undermined and dissolved--Slavery.  The English colonies in America owe their first origin partly to the English instinct for wandering and especially for wandering on the sea, which naturally seized on the adventurous element in the Renaissance as that most congenial to the national temper, and partly to the secular antagonism between England and Spain. Spain, whose sovereign then ruled Portugal and therefore the Portuguese as well as Spanish colonies, claimed the whole of the New World as part of her dominions, and her practical authority extended unchallenged from Florida to Cape Horn. It would have been hopeless for England to have attempted seriously to challenge that authority where it existed in view of the relative strength at that time of the two kingdoms; and in general the English seamen confined themselves to hampering and annoying the Spanish commerce by acts of privateering which the Spaniards naturally designated as piracy. But to the bold and inventive mind of the great Raleigh there occurred another conception. Spain, though she claimed the whole American continent, had not in fact made herself mistress of all its habitable parts. North of the rich lands which supplied gold and silver to the Spanish exchequer, but still well within the temperate zone of climate, lay great tracts bordering the Atlantic where no Spanish soldier or ruler had ever set his foot. To found an English colony in the region would not be an impossible task like the attempt to seize any part of the Spanish empire, yet it would be a practical challenge to the Spanish claim. Raleigh accordingly projected, and others, entering into his plans, successfully planted, an English settlement on the Atlantic seaboard to the south of Chesapeake Bay which, in honour of the Queen, was named \"Virginia.\"  In the subsequent history of the English colonies which became American States we often find a curious and recurrent reflection of their origin. Virginia was the first of those colonies to come into existence, and we shall see her both as a colony and as a State long retaining a sort of primacy amongst them. She also retained, in the incidents of her history and in the characters of many of her great men, a colour which seems partly Elizabethan. Her Jefferson, with his omnivorous culture, his love of music and the arts, his proficiency at the same time in sports and bodily exercises, suggests something of the graceful versatility of men like Essex and Raleigh, and we shall see her in her last agony produce a soldier about whose high chivalry and heroic and adventurous failure there clings a light of romance that does not seem to belong to the modern world.  If the external quarrels of England were the immediate cause of the foundation of Virginia, the two colonies which next make their appearance owe their origin to her internal divisions. James I. and his son Charles I., though by conviction much more genuine Protestants than Elizabeth, were politically more disposed to treat the Catholics with leniency."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24064"],["title","Damned If You Don't (#1)"],["body","the greater concentration involved, the partial genius usually gets more recognition than the general--that is, if he gets any recognition at all. Thus, the mathematical and optical work of Sir Isaac Newton show true genius; his theological and political ideas weren't worth the paper he wrote them on. Similar accusations might be leveled against Albert Einstein--and many others.  The general genius isn't so well known because he spreads his abilities over a broad area. Some--like Leonardo da Vinci--have made a name for themselves, but, in general, they have remained in the background.  Someone once defined a specialist as \"a man who learns more and more about less and less until he finally knows everything about nothing.\" And there is the converse, the general practitioner, who knows \"less and less about more and more until he finally knows nothing about everything.\"  Both types can produce geniuses, and there is, of course, a broad spectrum in between. Da Vinci, for instance, became famous for his paintings; he concentrated on that field because he knew perfectly well that his designs for such things as airplanes were impracticable at the time, whereas the Church would pay for art.  Samson Bending was a genius, granted; but he was more toward the \"special\" than the \"general\" side of the spectrum. His grasp of nuclear physics was far and away beyond that of any other scientist of his day; his ability to handle political and economic relationships was rather feeble.  As he sat in his waiting room on that chill day of February, 1981, his mind was centered on nuclear physics, not general economics. Not that Bending was oblivious to the power of the Great God Ammon; Bending was very fond of money and appreciated the things it could achieve. He simply didn't appreciate the over-all power of Ammon. At the moment, he was brooding darkly over the very fact of existence of Power Utilities, and trying to figure out a suitable rejoinder to their _coup de d√©mon_.  And then he heard the whir of helicopter blades over the building. The police had come.  He opened the door of the lab building as they came up the steps. There were two plainclothes men--the Technical Squad, Bending knew--and four uniformed officers.         *       *       *       *       *  The plainclothesman in the lead, a tall, rather thin man, with dark straight hair and a small mustache, said: \"Mr. Bending? I'm Sergeant Ketzel. Mind if the boys take a look at the scene? And I'd like to ask a few questions?\"  \"Fine,\" said Sam Bending. \"Come on in.\"  He showed the officers to the lab, and telling them nothing, left them to their work. Then he went into his office, followed by Sergeant Ketzel. The detective took down all the pertinent data that Bending chose to give him, and then asked Bending to go with him to the lab.  The other plainclothesman came up to Sergeant Ketzel and Bending as they entered. \"Pretty easy to see what happened,\" he said. \"Come on over and take a look.\" He led them over to the wall where the Converter had been hidden.  \"See,\" he said, \"here's your main power line coming in here. It's been burned off. They shut off the power to cut off the burglar alarm to that safe over there.\"  Ketzel shook his head slowly, but said nothing for the moment. He looked at Bending. \"Has the safe been robbed?\"  \"I don't know,\" Bending admitted. \"I didn't touch it after I saw all this wreckage.\"  Ketzel told a couple of the uniformed men to go over the safe for evidence. While they waited, Bending looked again at the hole in the wall where the Converter had been. And it suddenly struck him that, even if he had reported the loss of the Converter to the police, it would be hard to prove. The thief had taken care to burn off the ends of the old leads that had originally come into the building. Bending himself had cut them a week before to install the Converter. Had they been left as they were, Bending could have proved by the oxidation of the surface that they had been cut a long time before the leads on this side of the Converter. But both had been carefully fused by a torch.  \"Nothing on the safe,\" said one of the officers. \"No prints, at any rate. Micros might show glove or cloth traces, but--\" He shrugged.  \"Would you mind opening the safe, Mr. Bending?\" Sergeant Ketzel asked.  \"Certainly,\" Bending said. He wondered if the safe _had_ been robbed. In the certainty that it was only the Converter that the burglars had been after, he hadn't even thought about the safe.  Bending touched the handle, turned it a trifle, and the door swung open easily in his hand. \"It wasn't even locked,\" Bending said, almost to himself.  He looked inside. The safe had been thoroughly gone through, but as far as Bending could see, there were no papers missing.  \"Don't touch anything in there, Mr. Bending,\" said Ketzel, \"Just tell us as much as you can by looking at it.\"  \"The papers have been disturbed,\" Bending said carefully, \"but I don't think anything is missing, except the petty cash box.\"  \"Uh-huh,\" Ketzel grunted significantly. \"Petty cash box. About how much was in it, Mr. Bending?\"  \"Three or four thousand, I imagine: you'll have to ask Jim Luckman, my business manager. He keeps track of things like that.\"  \"Three or four _thousand_ in petty cash?\" Ketzel asked, as though he'd prefer Bending to correct the figure to \"two or three hundred.\"  \"About that. Sometimes we have to order equipment of one kind or another in a hurry, and we can usually expedite matters if we can promise cash. You know how it is.\"  Sergeant Ketzel nodded sourly. He evidently knew only too well how it was. Even the most respectable businessmen were doing occasional business with the black market in technological devices. But he didn't say anything to Bending.  \"What did the cash box look like?\" he asked.  Bending held out his hands to measure off a distance. \"About so long--ten inches, I guess; maybe six inches wide and four deep. Thin sheet steel, with a gray crackle finish. There was a lock on it, but it wasn't much of one; since it was kept in the safe, there was no need for a strong lock.\"  Sergeant Ketzel nodded. \"In other words, an ordinary office cash box. No distinguishing marks at all?\"  \"It had 'Bending Consultants' on the top. And underneath that, the word 'Lab'. In black paint. That 'Lab' was to distinguish it from the petty cash box in the main office.\"  \"I see. Do you know anything about the denominations of the bills? Were they marked in any way?\"  Bending frowned. \"I don't know. You'd have to ask Luckman about that, too.\"  \"Where is he now?\"  \"Home, I imagine. He isn't due to report for work until ten.\"  \"O.K. Will you leave word that we want to talk to him when he comes in? It'll take us a while to get all the information we can from the lab, here.\" He looked back at the hole in the wall. \"It still doesn't make sense. Why should they go to all that trouble just to shut off a burglar alarm?\" He shook his head and went over to where the others were working.  It was hours before the police left, and long before they were gone Sam Bending had begun to wish fervently that he had never called them. He felt that he should have kept his mouth shut and fought Power Utilities on the ground they had chosen. They had known about the Converter only two weeks, and they had already struck. He tried to remember exactly how the Utilities representative had worded what he'd said, and couldn't.  Well, there was an easy way to find out. He went over to his files and took out the recording for Friday, 30 January 1981. He threaded it through the sound player--he had no particular desire to look at the man's face again--and turned on the machine. The first sentence brought the whole scene back to mind.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Thank you for your time, Mr. Bending,\" the man whose card had announced him as Richard Olcott. He was a rather average-sized man, with a fiftyish face, graying hair that was beginning to thin, and an expression like that of a friendly poker player--pleasant, but inscrutable.  \"I always have time to see a representative of Power Utilities, Mr. Olcott,\" Bending said. \"Though I must admit that I'm more used to dealing with various engineers who work for your subsidiaries.\"  \"Not subsidiaries, please,\" Olcott admonished in a friendly tone. \"Like the Bell Telephone Company, Power Utilities is actually a group of independent but mutually co-operative companies organized under a parent company.\"  Bending grinned. \"I stand corrected. What did you have on your mind, Mr. Olcott?\"  Olcott's hesitation was of half-second duration, but it was perceptible.  \"Mr. Bending,\" he began, \"I understand that you have been ... ah ... working on a new and ... ah ... radically different method of power generation. Er ... is that substantially correct?\"  Bending looked at the man, his blocky, big-jawed face expressionless. \"I've been doing experimenting with power generators, yes,\" he said after a moment. \"That's my business.\"  \"Oh, quite, quite. I understand that,\" Olcott said hurriedly. \"I ... ah ... took the trouble to look up your record before I came. I'm well aware of the invaluable work you've done in the power field.\"  \"Thank you,\" Bending said agreeably. He waited to see what the other would say next. It was his move.  \"However,\" Olcott said, \"that's not the sort of thing I was referring to.\" He leaned forward in his chair, and his bright gray eyes seemed to take on a new life; his manner seemed to alter subtly.  \"Let me put my ... _our_ cards on the table, Mr. Bending. We understand that you have designed, and are experimenting with, an amazingly compact power source. We understand that little remains but to get the bugs out of your pilot model.  \"Naturally, we are interested. Our business is supplying the nation with power. Anything from a new type solar battery on up is of interest to us.\" He stopped, waiting for Bending to speak.  Bending obliged. \"I see Petternek let"]]]
