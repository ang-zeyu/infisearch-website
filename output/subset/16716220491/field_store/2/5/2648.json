Sawtelle wanted Jeffers to head this group, instead of me. Everybody thought he _would_ head it.\"  \"And Hilton wanted Eggleston and got _me_,\" Sandra said.  \"That's right. And quite a few of you didn't want to come at all, but were told by the Board to come or else.\"  The group stirred. Eyes met eyes, and there were smiles.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I myself think Jeffers _should_ have had the job. I've never handled anything half this big and I'll need a lot of help. But I'm stuck with it and you're all stuck with me, so we'll all take it and like it. You've noticed, of course, the accent on youth. The Navy crew is normal, except for the commanders being unusually young. But we aren't. None of us is thirty yet, and none of us has ever been married. You fellows look like a team of professional athletes, and you girls--well, if I didn't know better I'd say the Board had screened you for the front row of the chorus instead of for a top-bracket brain-gang. How they found so many of you I'll never know.\"  \"Virile men and nubile women!\" Etienne de Vaux leered enthusiastically. \"_Vive le Board!_\"  \"Nubile! Bravo, Tiny! _Quelle delicatesse de nuance!_\"  \"Three rousing cheers for the Board!\"  \"Keep still, you nitwits! Let me ask a question!\" This came from one of the twins. \"Before you give us the deduction, Jarvis--or will it be an intuition or an induction or a ...\"  \"Or an inducement,\" the other twin suggested, helpfully. \"Not that _you_ would need very much of that.\"  \"You keep still, too, Miney. I'm asking, Sir Moderator, if I can give my deduction first?\"  \"Sure, Bernadine; go ahead.\"  \"They figured we're going to get completely lost. Then we'll jettison the Navy, hunt up a planet of our own and start a race to end all human races. Or would you call this a _see_-duction instead of a _dee_-duction?\"  This produced a storm of whistles, cheers and jeers that it took several seconds to quell.  \"But seriously, Jarvis,\" Bernadine went on. \"We've all been wondering and it doesn't make sense. Have you any idea at all of what the Board actually did have in mind?\"  \"I believe that the Board selected for mental, not physical, qualities; for the ability to handle anything unexpected or unusual that comes up, no matter what it is.\"  \"You think it wasn't double-barreled?\" asked Kincaid, the psychologist. He smiled quizzically. \"That all this virility and nubility and glamor is pure coincidence?\"  \"No,\" Hilton said, with an almost imperceptible flick of an eyelid. \"Coincidence is as meaningless as paradox. I think they found out that--barring freaks--the best minds are in the best bodies.\"  \"Could be. The idea has been propounded before.\"  \"Now let's get to work.\" Hilton flipped the switch of the recorder. \"Starting with you, Sandy, each of you give a two-minute boil-down. What you found and what you think.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Something over an hour later the meeting adjourned and Hilton and Sandra strolled toward the control room.  \"I don't know whether you convinced Alexander Q. Kincaid or not, but you didn't quite convince me,\" Sandra said.  \"Nor him, either.\"  \"Oh?\" Sandra's eyebrows  \"No. He grabbed the out I offered him. I didn't fool Teddy Blake or Temple Bells, either. You four are all, though, I think.\"  \"Temple? You think _she's_ so smart?\"  \"I don't _think_ so, no. Don't fool yourself, chick. Temple Bells looks and acts sweet and innocent and virginal. Maybe--probably--she is. But she isn't showing a fraction of the stuff she's really got. She's heavy artillery, Sandy. And I mean _heavy_.\"  \"I think you're slightly nuts there. But do you really believe that the Board was playing Cupid?\"  \"Not trying, but doing. Cold-bloodedly and efficiently. Yes.\"  \"But it wouldn't _work_! We aren't going to get lost!\"  \"We won't need to. Propinquity will do the work.\"  \"Phooie. You and me, for instance?\" She stopped, put both hands on her hips, and glared. \"Why, I wouldn't marry _you_ if you ...\"  \"I'll tell the cockeyed world you won't!\" Hilton broke in. \"Me marry a damned female Ph.D.? Uh-uh. Mine will be a cuddly little brunette that thinks a slipstick is some kind of lipstick and that an isotope's something good to eat.\"  \"One like that copy of Murchison's Dark Lady that you keep under the glass on your desk?\" she sneered.  \"Exactly....\" He started to continue the battle, then shut himself off. \"But listen, Sandy, why should we get into a fight because we don't want to marry each other? You're doing a swell job. I admire you tremendously for it and I like to work with you.\"  \"You've got a point there, Jarve, at that, and I'm one of the few who know what kind of a job _you're_ doing, so I'll relax.\" She flashed him a gamin grin and they went on into the control room.  It was too late in the day then to do any more exploring; but the next morning, early, the _Perseus_ lined out for the city of the humanoids.         *       *       *       *       *  Tula turned toward her fellows. Her eyes filled with a happily triumphant light and her thought a lilting song. \"I have been telling you from the first touch that it was the Masters. It _is_ the Masters! The Masters are returning to us Omans and their own home world!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Captain Sawtelle,\" Hilton said, \"Please land in the cradle below.\"  \"_Land!_\" Sawtelle stormed. \"On a planet like _that_? Not by ...\" He broke off and stared; for now, on that cradle, there flamed out in screaming red the _Perseus'_ own Navy-coded landing symbols!  \"Your protest is recorded,\" Hilton said. \"Now, sir, land.\"  Fuming, Sawtelle landed. Sandra looked pointedly at Hilton. \"First contact is my dish, you know.\"  \"Not that I like it, but it is.\" He turned to a burly youth with sun-bleached, crew-cut hair, \"Still safe, Frank?\"  \"Still abnormally low. Surprising no end, since all the rest of the planet is hotter than the middle tail-race of hell.\"  \"Okay, Sandy. Who will you want besides the top linguists?\"  \"Psych--both Alex and Temple. And Teddy Blake. They're over there. Tell them, will you, while I buzz Teddy?\"  \"Will do,\" and Hilton stepped over to the two psychologists and told them. Then, \"I hope I'm not leading with my chin, Temple, but is that your real first name or a professional?\"  \"It's real; it really is. My parents were romantics: dad says they considered both 'Golden' and 'Silver'!\"  Not at all obviously, he studied her: the almost translucent, unblemished perfection of her lightly-tanned, old-ivory skin; the clear, calm, deep blueness of her eyes; the long, thick mane of hair exactly the color of a field of dead-ripe wheat.  \"You know, I like it,\" he said then. \"It fits you.\"  \"I'm glad you said that, Doctor....\"  \"Not that, Temple. I'm not going to 'Doctor' you.\"  \"I'll call you 'boss', then, like Stella does. Anyway, that lets me tell you that I like it myself. I really think that it did something for me.\"  \"_Something_ did something for you, that's for sure. I'm mighty glad you're aboard, and I hope ... here they come. Hi, Hark! Hi, Stella!\"  \"Hi, Jarve,\" said Chief Linguist Harkins, and:  \"Hi, boss--what's holding us up?\" asked his assistant, Stella Wing. She was about five feet four. Her eyes were a tawny brown; her hair a flamboyant auburn mop. Perhaps it owed a little of its spectacular refulgence to chemistry, Hilton thought, but not too much. \"Let us away! Let the lions roar and let the welkin ring!\"  \"Who's been feeding _you_ so much red meat, little squirt?\" Hilton laughed and turned away, meeting Sandra in the corridor. \"Okay, chick, take 'em away. We'll cover you. Luck, girl.\"  And in the control room, to Sawtelle, \"Needle-beam cover, please; set for minimum aperture and lethal blast. But no firing, Captain Sawtelle, until I give the order.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The _Perseus_ was surrounded by hundreds of natives. They were all adult, all naked and about equally divided as to sex. They were friendly; most enthusiastically so.  \"Jarve!\" Sandra squealed. \"They're _telepathic_. Very strongly so! I never imagined--I never felt anything like it!\"  \"Any rough stuff?\" Hilton demanded.  \"Oh, no. Just the opposite. They love us ... in a way that's simply indescribable. I don't like this telepathy business ... not clear ... foggy, diffuse ... this woman is _sure_ I'm her long-lost great-great-a-hundred-times grandmother or something--_You!_ Slow down. Take it _easy_! They want us all to come out here and live with ... no, not _with_ them, but each of us alone in a whole house with them to wait on us! But first, they all want to come aboard....\"  \"_What?_\" Hilton yelped. \"But are you _sure_ they're friendly?\"  \"Positive, chief.\"  \"How about you, Alex?\"  \"We're all sure, Jarve. No question about it.\"  \"Bring two of them aboard. A man and a woman.\"  \"You won't bring _any_!\" Sawtelle thundered. \"Hilton, I had enough of your stupid, starry-eyed, ivory-domed blundering long ago, but this utterly idiotic brainstorm of letting enemy aliens aboard us ends all civilian command. Call your people back aboard or I will bring them in by force!\"  \"Very well, sir. Sandy, tell the natives that a slight delay has become necessary and bring your party aboard.\"  The Navy officers smiled--or grinned--gloatingly; while the scientists stared at their director with expressions ranging from surprise to disappointment and disgust. Hilton's face remained set, expressionless, until Sandra and her party had arrived.  \"Captain Sawtelle,\" he said then, \"I thought that you and I had settled in private the question or who is in command of Project Theta Orionis at destination. We will now settle it in public. Your opinion of me is now on record, witnessed by your officers and by my staff. My opinion of you, which is now being similarly recorded and witnessed, is that you are a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2276"],["title","The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (#1)"],["body","sweethearts, save in the way of dreaming about them; but, as his spirit began again by slow degrees to verge towards the boundaries of reason, it became lighter and more buoyant from the effects of deep repose, and his dreams partook of that buoyancy, yea, to a degree hardly expressible. He dreamed of the reel, the jig, the strathspey, and the corant; and the elasticity of his frame was such that he was bounding over the heads of maidens, and making his feet skimmer against the ceiling, enjoying, the while, the most ecstatic emotions. These grew too fervent for the shackles of the drowsy god to restrain. The nasal bugle ceased its prolonged sounds in one moment, and a sort of hectic laugh took its place. \"Keep it going--play up, you devils!\" cried the laird, without changing his position on the pillow. But this exertion to hold the fiddlers at their work fairly awakened the delighted dreamer, and, though he could not refrain from continuing, his laugh, beat length, by tracing out a regular chain of facts, came to be sensible of his real situation. \"Rabina, where are you? What's become of you, my dear?\" cried the laird. But there was no voice nor anyone that answered or regarded. He flung open the curtains, thinking to find her still on her knees, as he had seen her, but she was not there, either sleeping or waking. \"Rabina! Mrs. Colwan!\" shouted he, as loud as he could call, and then added in the same breath, \"God save the king--I have lost my wife!\"  He sprung up and opened the casement: the day-light was beginning to streak the east, for it was spring, and the nights were short, and the mornings very long. The laird half dressed himself in an instant, and strode through every room in the house, opening the windows as he went, and scrutinizing every bed and every corner. He came into the hall where the wedding festival had been held; and as he opened the various windowboards, loving couples flew off like hares surprised too late in the morning among the early braird. \"Hoo-boo! Fie, be frightened!\" cried the laird. \"Fie, rin like fools, as if ye were caught in an ill-turn!\" His bride was not among them; so he was obliged to betake himself to further search. \"She will be praying in some corner, poor woman,\" said he to himself. \"It is an unlucky thing this praying. But, for my part, I fear I have behaved very ill; and I must endeavour to make amends.\"  The laird continued his search, and at length found his beloved in the same bed with her Glasgow cousin who had acted as bridesmaid. \"You sly and malevolent imp,\" said the laird; \"you have played me such a trick when I was fast asleep! I have not known a frolic so clever, and, at the same time, so severe. Come along, you baggage you!\"  \"Sir, I will let you know that I detest your principles and your person alike,\" said she. \"It shall never be said, Sir, that my person was at the control of a heathenish man of Belial--a dangler among the daughters of women--a promiscuous dancer--and a player of unlawful games. Forgo your rudeness, Sir, I say, and depart away from my presence and that of my kinswoman.\"  \"Come along, I say, my charming Rab. If you were the pink of all puritans, and the saint of all saints, you are my wife, and must do as I command you.\"  \"Sir, I will sooner lay down my life than be subjected to your godless will; therefore I say, desist, and begone with you.\"  But the laird regarded none of these testy sayings: he rolled her in a blanket, and bore her triumphantly away to his chamber, taking care to keep a fold or two of the blanket always rather near to her mouth, in case of any outrageous forthcoming of noise.  The next day at breakfast the bride was long in making her appearance. Her maid asked to see her; but George did not choose that anybody should see her but himself. He paid her several visits, and always turned the key as he came out. At length breakfast was served; and during the time of refreshment the laird tried to break several jokes; but it was remarked that they wanted their accustomed brilliancy, and that his nose was particularly red at the top.  Matters, without all doubt, had been very bad between the new-married couple; for in the course of the day the lady deserted her quarters, and returned to her father's house in Glasgow, after having been a night on the road; stage-coaches and steam-boats having then no existence in that quarter.  Though Baillie Orde had acquiesced in his wife's asseveration regarding the likeness of their only daughter to her father, he never loved or admired her greatly; therefore this behaviour nothing astounded him. He questioned her strictly as to the grievous offence committed against her, and could discover nothing that warranted a procedure so fraught with disagreeable consequences. So, after mature deliberation, the baillie addressed her as follows:  \"Aye, aye, Raby! An' sae I find that Dalcastle has actually refused to say prayers with you when you ordered him; an' has guidit you in a rude indelicate manner, outstepping the respect due to my daughter--as my daughter. But, wi' regard to what is due to his own wife, of that he's a better judge nor me. However, since he has behaved in that manner to MY DAUGHTER, I shall be revenged on him for aince; for I shall return the obligation to ane nearer to him: that is, I shall take pennyworths of his wife--an' let him lick at that.\"  \"What do you mean, Sir?\" said the astonished damsel.  \"I mean to be revenged on that villain Dalcastle,\" said he, \"for what he has done to my daughter. Come hither, Mrs. Colwan, you shall pay for this.\"  So saying, the baillie began to inflict corporal punishment on the runaway wife. His strokes were not indeed very deadly, but he made a mighty flourish in the infliction, pretending to be in a great rage only at the Laird of Dalcastle. \"Villain that he is!\" exclaimed he, \"I shall teach him to behave in such a manner to a child of mine, be she as she may; since I cannot get at himself, I shall lounder her that is nearest to him in life. Take you that, and that, Mrs. Colwan, for your husband's impertinence!\"  The poor afflicted woman wept and prayed, but the baillie would not abate aught of his severity. After fuming and beating her with many stripes, far drawn, and lightly laid down, he took her up to her chamber, five stories high, locked her in, and there he fed her on bread and water, all to be revenged on the presumptuous Laird of Dalcastle; but ever and anon, as the baillie came down the stair from carrying his daughter's meal, he said to himself: \"I shall make the sight of the laird the blithest she ever saw in her life.\"  Lady Dalcastle got plenty of time to read, and pray, and meditate; but she was at a great loss for one to dispute with about religious tenets; for she found that, without this advantage, about which there was a perfect rage at that time, the reading and learning of Scripture texts, and sentences of intricate doctrine, availed her naught; so she was often driven to sit at her casement and look out for the approach of the heathenish Laird of Dalcastle.  That hero, after a considerable lapse of time, at length made his appearance. Matters were not hard to adjust; for his lady found that there was no refuge for her in her father's house; and so, after some sighs and tears, she accompanied her husband home. For all that had passed, things went on no better. She WOULD convert the laird in spite of his teeth: the laird would not be converted. She WOULD have the laird to say family prayers, both morning and evening: the laird would neither pray morning nor evening. He would not even sing psalms, and kneel beside her while she performed the exercise; neither would he converse at all times, and in all places, about the sacred mysteries of religion, although his lady took occasion to contradict flatly every assertion that he made, in order that she might spiritualize him by drawing him into argument.  The laird kept his temper a long while, but at length his patience wore out; he cut her short in all her futile attempts at spiritualization, and mocked at her wire-drawn degrees of faith, hope, and repentance. He also dared to doubt of the great standard doctrine of absolute predestination, which put the crown on the lady's Christian resentment. She declared her helpmate to be a limb of Antichrist, and one with whom no regenerated person could associate. She therefore bespoke a separate establishment, and, before the expiry of the first six months, the arrangements of the separation were amicably adjusted. The upper, or third, story of the old mansion-house was awarded to the lady for her residence. She had a separate door, a separate stair, a separate garden, and walks that in no instance intersected the laird's; so that one would have thought the separation complete. They had each their own parties, selected from their own sort of people; and, though the laird never once chafed himself about the lady's companies, it was not long before she began to intermeddle about some of his.  \"Who is that fat bouncing dame that visits the laird so often, and always by herself?\" said she to her maid Martha one day.  \"Oh dear, mem, how can I ken? We're banished frae our acquaintances here, as weel as frae the sweet gospel ordinances.\"  \"Find me out who that jolly dame is, Martha. You, who hold communion with the household of this ungodly man, can be at no loss to attain this information. I observe that she always casts her eye up toward our windows, both in coming and going; and I suspect that she seldom departs from the house emptyhanded.\"  That same evening Martha came with the information that this august visitor was a Miss Logan, an old and intimate acquaintance of the laird's, and a very worthy respectable lady, of good connections, whose parents had lost their patrimony in the civil wars.  \"Ha! very well!\" said the lady; \"very well, Martha! But, nevertheless, go thou and watch this respectable lady's motions and"]]]
