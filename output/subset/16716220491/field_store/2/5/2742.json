To make matters worse, the weather became gloomy and cold, with sudden blasts of piercing wind accompanied by snow.  They pushed on vigorously notwithstanding, and had well-nigh crossed the swamp when Mr Buchan was suddenly seized with a fit.  This compelled a halt.  As he could not go further, a fire was kindled, and those who were most fatigued were left behind to take care of him, while the rest continued to advance.  At last they reached the summit of the mountain, and were rewarded for their toil by the botanical specimens discovered there.  It was late in the day by that time, and as it was impossible to get back to the ship that night, they were obliged to make up their minds to bivouac on the mountain, a necessity which caused them no little uneasiness, for it had now become bitterly cold.  Sharp blasts of wind became so frequent, however, that they could not remain on the exposed mountain-side, and were obliged to make for the shelter of the woods in the nearest valley.  Mr Buchan having recovered, and the whole party having reassembled, they set out to recross the swamp, intending, when they should get into the woods, to build a hut of leaves and branches, kindle a fire, and pass the night there as well as they could.  But an overpowering torpor had now begun to seize hold upon some of the party, and it was with the greatest difficulty the others could prevent the drowsy ones from lying down to sleep in the snow.  This almost irresistible tendency to sleep is common in cold countries.  It is one of the effects of extreme cold upon exhausted men, and is a very dangerous condition, because those who fall into it cannot resist giving way to it, even though they know that if they do so they will certainly die.  Dr Solander, who had formerly travelled on the snow-topped mountains of Norway, was aware of the danger of giving way to this feeling, and strove to prevent his companions from falling into the fatal rest. \"Whoever sits down,\" said he, \"will sleep, and whoever sleeps will awake no more.\"  Strange to say, Dr Solander was the first to disregard his own warning. While they were still pushing across the naked side of the mountain, the cold became suddenly so intense that it increased the effect they dreaded so much.  The doctor found the desire to rest so irresistible that he insisted on being suffered to lie down.  Mr Banks tried to prevent him, but in vain.  Down he lay upon the ground, covered though it was with snow, and all that his friends could do was to keep shaking him, and so prevent him from falling into the fatal sleep.  At the same time one of the negro servants became affected in a similar manner.  Mr Banks, therefore, sent forward five of the company with orders to get a fire ready at the first convenient place they could find, while himself with four others remained with the doctor and the negro, whom partly by entreaty and partly by force, they roused up and brought on for some little distance.  But when they had got through the greatest part of the swamp they both declared they could go no further.  Again Mr Banks tried to reason with the two unfortunate men, pointing out their extreme danger, and beseeching them to make an effort to advance.  But all he could say had no effect.  When the negro was told that if he would not go on he must, in a short time, be frozen to death, he answered that he desired nothing but to be allowed to lie down and die.  Dr Solander, on being told the same thing, replied that he was willing to go on but that he must \"_first take some sleep_,\" forgetting apparently that he had before told his comrades that to sleep was to perish.  As Mr Banks and his companions could not carry them, there was no help for it--they were suffered to sit down, being partly supported by the bushes.  In a few minutes they were both sound asleep.  Providentially, just at that time, some of the people who had been sent forward returned with the welcome news that a fire had been lighted not more than a quarter of a mile off.  Renewed attempts were therefore made to rouse the sleepers.  But the negro was past help.  Every effort failed to awaken him.  With Dr Solander they were more successful, yet, though he had not slept five minutes he had almost lost the use of his limbs, and the muscles were so shrunken that the shoes fell off his feet. Staggering and stumbling among the slush and snow, more dead than alive, he was half carried, half dragged by his comrades to the fire.  Meanwhile the other negro and a seaman were left in charge of the unfortunate black servant, with directions to stay by him and do what they could for him until help should be sent.  The moment Dr Solander was got to the fire, two of the strongest of the party who had been refreshed were sent back to bring in the negro.  In half an hour, however, they had the mortification to see these two men return alone. They had been unable to find their comrades.  This at first seemed unaccountable, but when it was discovered that the only bottle of rum belonging to the party was amissing, Mr Banks thought it probable that it had been in the knapsack of one of the absent men, that by means of it the sleeping negro had been revived, that they had then tried to reach the fire without waiting for assistance, and so had lost themselves.  It was by this time quite dark, another heavy fall of snow had come on, and continued for two hours, so that all hope of seeing them again alive was given up, for it must be remembered that the men remaining by the fire were so thoroughly knocked up that had they gone out to try to save their comrades they would in all probability have lost their own lives. Towards midnight, however, a shout was heard at some distance.  Mr Banks, with four others, went out immediately, and found the seaman who had been left with the two negroes, staggering along with just strength enough to keep on his legs.  He was quickly brought to the fire, and, having described where the other two were, Mr Banks proceeded in search of them.  They were soon found.  The first negro, who had sunk down at the same time with Dr Solander, was found standing on his legs, but unable to move.  The other negro was lying on the snow as insensible as a stone.  All hands were now called from the fire, and an attempt was made to carry them to it, but every man was so weak from cold, hunger, and fatigue that the united strength of the whole party was not sufficient for this.  The night was extremely dark, the snow was very deep, and although they were but a short distance from the fire, it was as much as each man could do to make his way back to it, stumbling and falling as he went through bogs and bushes.  Thus the poor negroes were left to their sad fate, and some of the others were so near sharing that fate with them that they began to lose their sense of feeling.  One of Mr Banks's servants became so ill, that it was feared he would die before he could be got to the fire.  At the fire, however, they did eventually arrive, and beside it passed a dreadful night of anxiety, grief, and suffering.  Of the twelve who had set out on this unfortunate expedition in health and good spirits two were dead; a third was so ill that it was doubtful whether he would be able to go forward in the morning; and a fourth, Mr Buchan, was in danger of a return of his fits.  They were distant from the ship a long day's journey, while snow lay deep on the ground and still continued to fall.  Moreover, as they had not expected to be out so long, they had no provisions left, except a vulture which chanced to be shot, and which was not large enough to afford each of them quarter of a meal.  When morning dawned nothing was to be seen, as far as the eye could reach, but snow, which seemed to lie as thick upon the trees as on the ground, and the wind came down in such sudden violent blasts, that they did not dare to resume their journey.  How long this might last they knew not.  Despair crept slowly over them, and they began gloomily to believe that they were doomed to perish of hunger and cold in that dreary waste.  But the Almighty, who often affords help to man when his case seems most hopeless and desperate, sent deliverance in a way most agreeable and unexpected.  He caused a soft, mild breeze to blow, under the influence of which the clouds began to clear away, the intense cold moderated, and the gladdening sun broke forth, so that with revived spirits and frames the wanderers were enabled to start on the return journey to the coast.  Before doing so, they cooked and ate the vulture, and it is probable that they devoured that meal with fully as much eagerness and satisfaction as the ravenous bird itself ever devoured its prey.  It was but a light breakfast, however.  After being skinned, the bird was divided into ten portions, and every man cooked his own as he thought fit, but each did not receive above three mouthfuls.  Nevertheless it strengthened them enough to enable them to return to the ship, where they were received by their anxious friends with much joy and thankfulness.  The month of December is the middle of summer in the land at the extreme south of South America.  That land occupies much about the same position on the southern half of this world that we occupy on the northern half; so that, when it is winter with us, it is summer there.  The climate is rigorous and stormy in the extreme, and the description given of the natives shows that they are a wretched and forlorn race of human beings.  Captain Cook visited one of their villages before leaving the coast.  It contained about a dozen dwellings of the poorest description.  They were mere hovels; nothing more than a few poles set up in a circle and meeting together at the top, each forming a kind of cone.  On the weather side each cone was covered with a few boughs "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23271"],["title","Sunk at Sea (#1)"],["body","often told me has been your motto through life, `Never venture never win?'\"  \"Certainly; you know that I have often urged you to act on that principle at school.  Why do you ask the question?\"  \"Because I mean to act on it now, and go to sea,\" replied Will firmly.  \"What? without permission, without clothes, and without money; for you shan't have a six-pence from me?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Will.  Mr Osten was one of those stern, despotic men who cannot bear to be thwarted.  He was a rich merchant, and almost the king of the little town in which he dwelt.  His greatest ambition was to make his only son a thorough man of business.  To be spoken to in such a tone by that rebellious son was too much for him.  He lost his temper, leaped up, and, seizing Will by the collar, thrust him out of the room.  The boy ran to his own bedroom, and, seating himself in front of the dressing-table, hit that piece of furniture with his clenched fist so violently that all its contents leaped up and rattled.  \"Dear, dear Will,\" said a gentle voice at his side, while a loving hand fell on his shoulder, \"why do you frown so fiercely?\"  \"How can I help it, mother, when he treats me like that?  He is harsh and unfair to me.\"  \"Not so unfair as you think, dear Will,\" said his mother.  We will not detail the arguments by which the good lady sought to combat her son's desires.  Suffice it to say that she succeeded--as only mothers know how--in lulling the lion to sleep at that time, and in awakening the lamb.  Wandering Will went back to school with a good grace, and gave up all idea of going to sea.    CHAPTER TWO.  RECORDS A SUDDEN DEPARTURE, AND MARYANN'S OPINION THEREON.  There is a fallacy into which men and women of mature years are apt to fall--namely, that the cares and sorrows of the young are light.  How many fathers and mothers there are who reason thus--\"Oh, the child will grow out of this folly.  'Tis a mere whim--a youthful fancy, not worthy of respect,\"--forgetting or shutting their eyes to the fact, that, light though the whim or fancy may be in their eyes, it has positive weight to those who cherish it, and the thwarting of it is as destructive of peace and joy to the young as the heavier disappointments of life are to themselves.  True, the cares and sorrows of the young are light in the sense that they are not usually permanent.  Time generally blows them away, while the cares of later years often remain with us to the end.  But they are not the less real, heavy, and momentous at the time on that account.  Those troubles cannot with propriety be called light which drive so many young men and women to rebellion and to destruction.  Well would it have been for Mr Osten if he had treated his son like a rational being, instead of calling him a \"young fool,\" and commanding him to \"obey.\"  Will, however, was not an untractable young lion.  He went through school and entered college, despite his unconquerable desire to go to sea, in obedience to his father's wishes.  Then he resolved to study medicine.  Mr Osten regarded the time thus spent as lost, inasmuch as his son might have been better employed in learning \"the business\" to which he was destined; still he had no great objection to his son taking the degree of MD, so he offered no opposition; but when Will, at the age of eighteen, spoke to him of his intention to take a run to the north or south seas, as surgeon in a whaler, he broke out on him.  \"So, it seems that your ridiculous old fancy still sticks to you,\" said Mr Osten, in great wrath, for the recurrence of the subject was like the lacerating of an old sore.  \"Yes, father; it has never left me.  If you will listen for a few moments to my reasons--\"  \"No, boy,\" interrupted his father, \"I will _not_ listen to your reasons. I have heard them often enough--too often--and they are foolish, false, utterly inconclusive.  You may go to Jericho as far as I am concerned; but if you do go, you shall never darken my doors again.\"  \"When I was a boy, father,\" said Will earnestly, \"your speaking sharply to me was natural, for I was foolish, and acted on impulse.  I am thankful now that I did not give way to rebellion, as I was tempted to do; but I am not now a boy, father.  If you will talk calmly with me--\"  \"Calmly!\" interrupted Mr Osten, growing still more angry at the quiet demeanour of his son; \"do you mean to insinuate that--that--.  What do you mean, sir?\"  \"I insinuate nothing, father; I mean that I wish you to hear me patiently.\"  \"I _won't_ hear you,\" cried Mr Osten, rising from his chair, \"I've heard you till I'm tired of it.  Go if you choose, if you dare.  You know the result.\"  Saying this he left the room hastily, shutting the door behind him with a bang.  A grave, stern expression settled on the youth's countenance as he arose and followed him into the passage.  Meeting his mother there, he seized her suddenly in his arms and held her in a long embrace; then, without explaining the cause of his strong emotion, he ran down stairs and left his father's house.  In a dirty narrow street, near the harbour of the town, there stood a small public-house which was frequented chiefly by the sailors who chanced to be in the port, and by the squalid population in its immediate neighbourhood.  Although small, the Red Lion Inn was superior in many respects to its surroundings.  It was larger than the decayed buildings that propped it; cleaner than the locality that owned it; brighter and warmer than the homes of the lean crew on whom it fattened. It was a pretty, light, cheery, snug place of temptation, where men and women, and even children assembled at nights to waste their hard-earned cash and ruin their health.  It was a place where the devil reigned, and where the work of murdering souls was carried on continually,-- nevertheless it was a \"jolly\" place.  Many good songs were sung there, as well as bad ones; and many a rough grasp of hearty friendship was exchanged.  Few people, going into the house for a few minutes, could have brought themselves to believe that it was such a _very_ broad part of the road leading to destruction: but the landlord had some hazy notion on that point.  He sat there day and night, and saw the destruction going on.  He saw the blear-eyed, fuddled men that came to drown conscience in his stalls, and the slatternly women who came and went.  Nevertheless he was a rosy, jocund fellow who appeared to have a good deal of the milk of human kindness about him, and would have looked on you with great surprise, if not scorn, had you told him that he had a hand in murdering souls.  Yes! the Red Lion might have been appropriately styled the Roaring Lion, for it drove a roaring trade among the poor in that dirty little street near the harbour.  The gas was flaring with attractive brilliancy in the Red Lion when Will Osten entered it, and asked if Captain Dall was within.  \"No, sir,\" answered the landlord; \"he won't be here for half-an-hour yet.\"  \"A pot of beer,\" said Will, entering one of the stalls, and sitting down opposite a tall, dark-countenanced man, who sat smoking moodily in a corner.  It was evident that our hero had not gone there to drink, for the beer remained untouched at his elbow, as he sat with his face buried in his hands.  The dark man in the corner eyed him steadily through the smoke which issued from his lips, but Will paid no attention to him.  He was too deeply absorbed in his own reflections.  \"A fine night, stranger,\" he said at length, in a slightly nasal tone.  Still Will remained absorbed, and it was not until the remark had been twice repeated that he looked up with a start.  \"I beg pardon; did you speak?\" he said.  \"Well, yes,\" drawled the dark man, puffing a long white cloud from his lips, \"I did make an observation regardin' the weather.  It looks fine, don't it?\"  \"It does,\" said Will.  \"You're waitin' for Captain Dall, ain't you?\"  \"Why, how did _you_ come to know that?\" said Will.  \"I didn't come to know it, I guessed it,\" said the dark man.  At that moment the door opened, and a short thick-set man, in a glazed hat and pea-jacket, with huge whiskers meeting under his chin, entered.  His eye at once fell upon the dark man, whom he saluted familiarly--\"All ready, Mr Cupples?\"  \"All ready, sir,\" replied the other; \"it's now more than half-flood; in three hours we can drop down the river with the first of the ebb, and if this breeze holds we'll be in blue water before noon to-morrow.\"  \"Hallo, doctor, is that yourself?\" said the captain, whose eye had for some moments rested on Will.  \"It is,\" said the youth, extending his hand, which the other grasped and shook warmly.  \"What! changed your mind--eh?\"  \"Yes, I'm going with you.\"  \"The governor bein' agreeable?\" inquired the captain.  Will shook his head.  \"Hope there ain't bin a flare-up?\" said the captain earnestly.  \"Not exactly,\" said Will; \"but he is displeased, and will not give his consent, so I have come away without it.\"  At this the jovial skipper, who was styled captain by courtesy, sat down and shook his head gravely, while he removed his hat and wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead.  \"It's a bad business to run agin the wishes of one's parents,\" he said; \"it seldom turns out well; couldn't you come round him nohow?\"  \"Impossible.  He won't listen to reason.\"  \"Ah, then, it's of no manner of use,\" said the captain, with a pitying sigh, \"when a man won't listen to reason, what's the consequence? why he's unreasonable, which means bein' destitoot of that which raises him above the brutes that perish.  Such bein' the case, give it up for a bad job, that's my advice.  Come, I'll have a bottle o' ginger-beer, not bein' given to strong drink, an' we'll talk over this matter.\"  Accordingly the beer was ordered, and the three sat there talking for a couple of hours in reference to a long, long voyage to the southern seas.  After that they rose, and, leaving the Red Lion, went down to the pier, where a boat was in"]]]
