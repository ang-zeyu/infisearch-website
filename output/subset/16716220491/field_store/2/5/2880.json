Lad's tail began to wag again. Apparently, this eccentric person was coming out, after all, to keep him company. Now, the man was kneeling on the window-seat. Now, in gingerly fashion, he reached forward and set the small bag down on the veranda; before negotiating the climb across the broad seat,--a climb that might well call for the use of both his hands.  Lad was entranced. Here was a game he understood. Thus, more than once, had the Mistress tossed out to him his flannel doll, as he had stood in pathetic invitation on the porch, looking in at her as she read or talked. She had laughed at his wild tossings and other maltreatments of the limp doll. He had felt he was scoring a real hit. And this hit he decided to repeat.  Snatching up the swollen little satchel, almost before it left the intruder's hand, Lad shook it, joyously, reveling in the faint clink and jingle of the contents. He backed playfully away; the bag-handle swinging in his jaws. Crouching low, he wagged his tail in ardent invitation to the stranger to chase him and get back the satchel. Thus did the Master romp with Lad, when the flannel doll was the prize of their game. And Lad loved such races.  Yes, the stranger was accepting the invitation. The moment he had crawled out on the veranda he reached down for the bag. As it was not where he thought he had left it, he swung his groping hand forward in a half-circle, his fingers sweeping the floor.  Make that enticing motion, directly in front of a playful collie pup; specially if he has something he doesn't want you to take from him;--and watch the effect.  Instantly, Lad was athrill with the spirit of the game. In one scurrying backward jump, he was off the veranda and on the lawn, tail vibrating, eyes dancing; satchel held tantalizingly towards its would-be possessor.  The light sound of his body touching ground reached the man. Reasoning that the sweep of his own arm had somehow knocked the bag off the porch, he ventured off the edge of the veranda and flashed a swathed ray of his pocket light along the ground in search of it.  The flashlight's lens was cleverly muffled; in a way to give forth but a single subdued finger of illumination. That one brief glimmer was enough to show the thief a right impossible sight. The glow struck answering lights from the polished sides of the brown bag. The bag was hanging in air, some six inches above the grass and perhaps five feet away from him. Then he saw it swig frivolously to one side and vanish in the night.  The astonished man had seen more. Feeble was the flashlight's shrouded ray, too feeble to outline against the night the small dark body behind the shining brown bag. But that same ray caught and reflected back to the incredulous beholder two splashes of pale fire;--glints from a pair of deep-set collie-eyes.  As the bag disappeared, the eerie fire-points were gone. The thief all but dropped his flashlight. He gaped in nervous dread; and sought vainly to account for the witch-work he had witnessed. He had plenty of nerve. He had plenty of experience along his chosen line of endeavor. But, while a crook may control his nerve, he cannot make  it phlegmatic or steady. Always, he must be conscious of holding it in check, as a clever driver checks and steadies and keeps in subjection a plunging horse. Let the vigilance slacken, and there is a runaway.  Now this particular marauder had long ago keyed his nerve to the chance of interruption from some gun-brandishing householder; and to the possible pursuit of police; and to the need of fighting or of fleeing. But all his preparations had not taken into account this newest emergency. He had not steeled himself to watch unmoved the gliding away of a treasure-satchel, apparently moving of its own will; nor the shimmer of two greenish sparks in the air just above it. And, for an instant, the man had to battle against a craven desire to bolt.  Lad, meanwhile, was having a beautiful time. Sincerely, he appreciated the playful grab his nocturnal friend had made in his general direction. Lad had countered this, by frisking away for another five or six feet, and then wheeling about to face once more his playfellow and to await the next move in the blithe gambol. The pup could see tolerably well, in the darkness quite well enough to play the game his guest had devised. And of course, he had no way of knowing that the man could not see equally well.  Shaking off his momentary terror, the thief once more pressed the button of his flashlight; swinging the torch in a swift semicircle and extinguishing it at once; lest the dim glow be seen by any wakeful member of the family.  That one quick sweep revealed to his gaze the shiny brown bag a half-dozen feet ahead of him, still swinging several inches above ground. He flung himself forward at it; refusing to believe he also saw that queer double glow of pale light just above. He dived for the satchel with the speed and the accuracy of a football tackle. And that was all the good it did him.  Perhaps there is something in nature more agile and dismayingly elusive than a romping young collie. But that \"something\" is not a mortal man. As the thief sprang, Lad sprang in unison with him; darting to the left and a yard or so backward. He came to an expectant standstill once more; his tail wildly vibrating, his entire furry body tingling with the glad excitement of the game. This sportive visitor of his was a veritable godsend. If only he could be coaxed into coming to play with him every night--!  But presently he noted that the other seemed to have wearied of the game. After plunging through the air and landing on all fours with his grasping hands closing on nothingness, the man had remained thus, as if dazed, for a second or so. Then he had felt the ground all about him. Then, bewildered, he had scrambled to his feet. Now he was standing, moveless, his lips working.  Yes, he seemed to be tired of the lovely game;--and just when Laddie was beginning to enter into the full spirit of it. Once in a while, the Mistress or the Master stopped playing, during the romps with the flannel doll. And Laddie had long since hit on a trick for reviving their interest. He employed this ruse now.  As the man stood, puzzled and scared, something brushed very lightly,-even coquettishly,--against his knuckles. He started in nervous fright. An instant later, the same thing brushed his knuckles again, this time more insistently. The man, in a spurt of fear-driven rage, grabbed at the invisible object. His fingers slipped along the smooth sides of the bewitched bag that Lad was shoving invitingly at him.  Brief as was the contact, it was long enough for the thief's sensitive finger tips to recognize what they touched. And both hands were brought suddenly into play, in a mad snatch for the prize. The ten avid fingers missed the bag; and came together with clawing force. But, before they met, the finger tips of the left hand telegraphed to the man's brain that they had had momentary light experience with something hairy and warm,--something that had slipped, eel-like, past them into the night;--something that most assuredly was no satchel, but ALIVE!  The man's throat contracted, in gagging fright. And, as before, fear scourged him to feverish rage.  Recklessly he pressed the flashlight's button; and swung the muffled bar of light in every direction. In his other hand he leveled the pistol he had drawn. This time the shaded ray revealed to him not only his bag, but,--vaguely,--the Thing that held it.  He could not make out what manner of creature it was which gripped the satchel's handle and whose eyes pulsed back greenish flares into the torch's dim glow. But it was an animal of some kind;--distorted and formless in the wavering finger of blunted light; but still an animal. Not a ghost.  And fear departed. The intruder feared nothing mortal. The mystery in part explained, he did not bother to puzzle out the remainder of it. Impossible as it seemed, his bag was carried by some living thing. All that remained for him was to capture the thing, and recover his bag. The weak light still turned on, he gave chase.  Lad's spirits arose with a bound. His ruse had succeeded. He had reawakened in this easily-discouraged chum a new interest in the game. And he gamboled across the lawn, fairly wriggling with delight. He did not wish to make his friend lose interest again. So instead of dashing off at full speed, he frisked daintily, just out of reach of the clawing hand.  And in this pleasant fashion the two playfellows covered a hundred yards of ground. More than once, the man came within an inch of his quarry. But always, by the most imperceptible spurt of speed, Laddie arranged to keep himself and his dear satchel from capture.  Then, in no time at all, the game ended; and with it ended Lad's baby faith in the friendliness and trustworthiness of all human nature.  Realizing that the sound of his own stumblingly running feet and the intermittent flashes of his torch might well awaken some light sleeper in the house, the thief resolved on a daring move. This creature in front of him,--dog or bear or goat, or whatever it was,--was uncatchable. But by sending a bullet through it, he could bring the animal to a sudden and permanent stop.  Then, snatching up his bag and running at top speed, he himself could easily win clear of the Place before anyone of the household should appear. And his car would be a mile away before the neighborhood could be aroused. Fury at the weird beast and the wrenching strain on his own nerves lent eagerness to his acceptance of the idea.  He reached back again for his pistol, whipped it out, and, coming to a standstill, aimed at the pup. Lad, waiting only to bound over an obstruction in his path, came to a corresponding pause, not ten feet ahead of his playmate.  It was an easy shot. Yet the bullet"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23922"],["title","Dead Man's Land (#1)"],["body","ear, how tiresome!\" he cried.  \"Haven't got a lozenge in your pocket, have you, Dean?\"  \"No, uncle.  Shall I get you a glass of water?\"  \"No, sir,\" almost shouted his uncle.  \"You know I hate cold water. Dear, dear!  Barking like this, just as if something has gone the wrong way!\"  And the baronet pulled out a big silk handkerchief and began blowing his nose violently.  \"Ah, that's better now.  Can't be cold coming on.  Ah, much better now.\"  Then next moment he had clapped his hand smartly down on Mark's shoulder, and the doctor noticed that he kept it there, while there was an artificial ring in his voice as he continued, \"Oh, you won't go, sir, won't you?\"  \"No, father,\" cried the boy firmly, and he gave his prisoned shoulder a hitch as if to free himself from the pressure, which immediately grew tighter.  \"Oh, that's it, is it, sir?  Now that I have made up my mind to it and am going to start you all off with a first class equipment, you tell me you are going to play the disobedient young dog, and plump out in a most insolent way--you heard him doctor?--that you won't go!\"  \"Oh, I must say on his behalf, Sir James,\" cried the doctor, \"that he did not strike me as being insolent.\"  \"Then you could not have been listening, sir, attentively,\" retorted Sir James.  \"I look upon it as disobedient and undutiful and--and cowardly.\"  \"Oh, father! cowardly!\" cried Mark, making another unsuccessful attempt to set his shoulder free.  \"How could it be cowardly?\"  \"Why, sir, if there's any selfishness in it you want to shuffle it off your shoulders on to mine.\"  \"Oh, no, father; don't say that.\"  \"But I have said it, sir,\" cried Sir James.  \"But he doesn't mean it, Mark,\" cried Dean.  \"What, sir!  What!  What!  What's that, sir?  How dare you!\" thundered Sir James.  \"Are you going to be insolent and disobedient too?\"  \"Excuse me, Sir James,\" said the doctor.  \"Let me say a few words.\"  \"No, sir,\" cried Sir James fiercely, \"not one word!  This is my affair. I never interfere with you over your teaching of my boys.\"  \"I beg your pardon, Sir James.\"  \"No, don't,\" cried the baronet.  \"I beg yours.  I am very much put out, doctor--very angry--very angry indeed.  I always am when I am opposed in anything which I consider to be right.  I oughtn't to have spoken to you as I did, so pray leave this to me or I may forget myself and say words to you, my good old friend, for which I shall be sorry afterwards.\"  The doctor bowed his head.  \"I say, uncle,\" cried Dean.  \"Well, sir, and pray what do you say?\" snapped out Sir James.  \"I was only going to say don't be cross with us, uncle.\"  \"I am not cross, sir--cross, indeed!--only angry and hurt at this opposition.  Well, sir, what were you going to say?\"  \"Only, nunkey--\"  \"Nunkey, sir!  Bah!\"  That bah! was a regular bark.  \"You know how I hate that silly, childish word.\"  \"That you don't,\" thought the boy.  \"You know you always like it when you are not out of temper.\"  \"Well, there, sir; go on.\"  \"I was going to say, uncle, that I know how it can all be managed.\"  \"Yes, sir, of course!  Like all stupid people you want to put your spoke in the wheel and stir everything up and make the mess worse than it was before.--I say, doctor,\"--and there was a peculiar twinkle in Sir James's eye--\"that's what you would call a mixed metaphor, isn't it?\"  \"Well, Sir James,\" said the doctor, smiling, \"it does sound something like it.\"  \"Sound!\" said Sir James, who was cooling fast.  \"It would look very much like it in print.  Now, Dean, fire away.  How were you going to put it right?\"  \"You come too, uncle.\"  \"Come too!\" cried the boy's uncle, growing fierce again.  \"How can I come too, sir?  Why, sir, I should want a Sam Weller, like poor old Pickwick at Dingley Dell, when he could not go to the partridge shooting.  Do you think I want to go in a wheelbarrow with someone to push me, in a country where there are no roads?  Bah!  Pish!  Tush! Rrrrr-r-r-rubbish!  Here, doctor, did you ever hear such a piece of lunacy in your life?\"  \"Well, I don't know, Sir James.  Lunacy?\"  \"Yes, sir; lunacy.  Now, look here, doctor, don't you begin apologising for these boys and taking their part, because if you do, sir, we are no longer friends.\"  \"Well, Sir James, it has always been an understood thing between us that I was to be quite independent and have liberty to express my opinion in matters connected with you and your boys.\"  \"There, I knew it!  You are going over to their side!\" raged out Sir James.  \"And I know how it will be: I shall be so upset that I shall have a fearful fit of the gout after this, and be obliged to have in that doctor with his wretched mixtures for the next fortnight.  Well, sir, I must listen to you, I suppose.\"  \"Yes, Sir James, I think you had better,\" said the doctor, smiling; and he glanced at Mark.  \"Well, go on, then,\" cried Sir James.  \"Oh, I say, father, don't,\" cried Mark sharply.  \"Don't what, sir?\" pretty well roared his father.  \"I don't mind a nip or two, but you did give it to me then.  It was like a vice.\"  \"Pooh, boy, pooh!  You are not a baby, are you?\"  \"No, father, but--\" began Mark, wriggling his shoulder.  \"Hold your tongue, sir, and don't interrupt the doctor.  Now, doctor, what were you going to say?\"  \"I was going to say, Sir James, that I fully believe that a fit of the gout must be very painful--\"  \"Oh, you think so, do you?\"  \"Yes, Sir James, and I think also that you are not troubled with many. Of course we are not going to imitate Mr Pickwick, and a wheelbarrow is quite out of the question.\"  \"Now, look here, sir,\" cried Sir James angrily--but somehow there was a want of reality in his tones--\"don't you begin to suggest impossibilities.  I think I know what you are aiming at.\"  \"I should not be surprised, sir, if you do.  Now, of course if we went on this expedition, or expeditions, we should be going through forests often nearly impassable; but I think I have read--\"  \"Oh, yes, I know,\" said Sir James shortly, and the boys watched the doctor with eager eyes, and as they caught his he gave to each a keen encouraging look; \"you have read everything--a deal too much, I think,\" he grumbled, almost inaudibly.  \"--that,\" continued the doctor, making believe that he had not heard the baronet's tetchy words, \"great use is made of the blacks in Africa and India, who are quite accustomed to using a litter for the sportsmen in hunting expeditions, for the benefit of their employers.\"  Sir James set his son's shoulder free by giving him a fierce thrust, and his own hand too, so as to bring down his doubled fist upon the library table.  \"Look here, sir,\" he roared, \"do you for a moment think that I would consent to be carried stretched out on a couple of poles raised shoulder high by a pack of niggers?  Because if you do--\"  \"And sometimes,\" continued the doctor calmly, \"the sure-footed ponies of a country are very much used by travellers and hunting parties, for it is necessary that the sportsman or naturalist should not be over fatigued and should keep his nerves steady, as at times his life or that of his companions may rest upon the ability to be true in his aim at some dangerous beast about to charge and strike him down.\"  \"Humph!  Yes.  That's quite true, boys.  A man can't shoot straight when he's pumped out with too much exertion.  I have missed horribly sometimes after a long day's tramp seeing nothing worth shooting at; and then just at the end the birds have risen, or a hare has started up and given me an easy chance, and then got away.  There, go on, doctor, and don't let me check you with my chatter.\"  \"Oh, I have not much more to say, sir,\" was the reply.  \"Not much more to say!\" cried Sir James, in a disappointed tone. \"There, go on, sir; go on.  The boys are very anxious to hear you-- there, I won't be a sham--so am I too.\"  \"Well, to be brief, sir--\" began the doctor.  \"But I don't want you to be brief,\" cried Sir James, thumping the table again, but this time more softly, and no coffee sprang out into the saucers.  \"Oh, do go on; do go on!\" said Mark's lips inaudibly, and Dean sat swinging himself softly to and fro as he rubbed his hands over his knees.  \"Well, Sir James,\" continued the doctor, \"I must say that it seems to me perfectly feasible for you to make up your mind to be one of the party.\"  \"An old man like me, sir?\" cried Sir James.  \"I beg your pardon, sir; you are not an old man.  I believe I number as many years as you, and saving for a slight indisposition now and then you certainly enjoy robust health.\"  \"Oh, no, no, no, no!\" cried Sir James.  \"That's adulation, sir, and I won't have it.\"  \"'Tisn't father; is it, Dean?\"  \"Not a bit of it,\" was the reply.  \"The doctor never flatters.\"  \"Will you boys be quiet?\" shouted Sir James, and Mark clapped his hand over his cousin's lips, receiving a similar compliment from Dean in return, while Sir James threw himself back in his chair, frowned severely as he stared straight out of the wide open window, and then twitched himself about, changing his position again and again as if his seat were not comfortable.  A strange silence had fallen on the group, and it was as if three of the four individuals present were suffering from a desire to turn a questioning look upon their companions, but dared not for fear of interrupting Sir James in the deep thoughts which were evidently playing about in his brain and filling his frank, florid, John-Bull-like countenance with wrinkles.  During the space of perhaps two minutes the silence deepened, till all at once from somewhere in the stableyard there was a loud, whack, whack, whack, whack as of wings beating together, and then sharp and clear, defiant and victorious, as if a battle had been won--_Cock-a-doodle-do_!  \"Hah!\" ejaculated Sir James, starting upright in his chair, as if awakened out of a dream, and turning towards the doctor as if to speak, but only to check himself again.  \"Oh, absurd!\" he quite shouted.  \"No, no, no, no; impossible;"]]]
