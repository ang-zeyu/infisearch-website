The poet Spenser's name was spelled with a _c_ in the Pioneer, but the article \"the\" was not used before \"Critics,\" as in the extract from Royce,--an unpardonable error in a book printed in Cambridge, and at the Riverside Press too.  The Spanish books mentioned by Shirley were evidently not neglected by her, and her acquaintance with and friendship for the Spanish-speaking population scattered along the banks of the Río de las Plumas must have made her very familiar with their tongue. In reading these Letters one cannot fail to perceive how fittingly Spanish words and phrases are interwoven with her own English. At the time these Letters were written, many Spanish words were a part of the California vernacular, but to Shirley belongs the honor of introducing them into the literature of California; hence, in printing the Letters, such words are not italicized, as they usually are, by printers who should know better.  Dr. Royce also says on page 350, \"Prominent in the society of the Bar was a trapper, of the old Frémont party, who told blood-curdling tales of Indian fights.\" (See post, p. 111.) It is singular that the Doctor has failed to identify this trapper with the well-known James P. Beckwourth, whose Life and Adventures (Harpers, New York, 1856) was written from his own dictation by Thomas D. Bonner, a justice of the peace in Butte County in 1852. His name is preserved in \"Beckwourth Pass.\" He first entered this pass probably in the spring of the year 1851, although 1850 is the year given in his Life. The Western Pacific Railroad utilizes the pass for its tracks entering California, and through it came the pioneers of whom Shirley has much to say in Letter the Twenty-second.  Among punishments for thefts, the Doctor, on page 351, speaks of a \"decidedly barbarous case of hanging\" for that offense. It is referred to here for the reason that in the sequel of the hanging Bret Harte found more than a suggestion for his finale of The Outcasts of Poker Flat. Both are reprinted here for the purpose of comparison. Shirley says (post, p. 157),--      The body of the criminal was allowed to hang for some hours after     the execution. It had commenced storming in the earlier part of the     evening, and when those whose business it was to inter the remains     arrived at the spot, they found them enwrapped in a soft white     shroud of feathery snowflakes, as if pitying nature had tried to     hide from the offended face of Heaven the cruel deed which her     mountain-children had committed.  The finale of The Outcasts of Poker Flat follows, in part, with no other changes than those of punctuation and capitalization.      They slept all that day and the next, nor did they waken when     voices and footsteps broke the silence of the camp. And when     pitying fingers brushed the snow from their wan faces, you could     scarcely have told, from the equal peace that dwelt upon them,     which was she that had sinned. Even the law of Poker Flat     recognized this, and turned away, leaving them still locked in each     other's arms. But at the head of the gulch, on one of the largest     pine-trees, they found the deuce of clubs pinned to the bark with a     bowie-knife.... And pulseless and cold, with a derringer by his     side and a bullet in his heart, though still calm as in life,     beneath the snow lay he who was at once the strongest and yet the     weakest of the outcasts of Poker Flat.  The phrase, \"though still calm as in life,\" in the last sentence of the extract immediately preceding, is one that would seem to invite the challenge of a proof-reader. It is passed without further notice.  Dr. Royce is not at his best in reviewing Letter the Nineteenth. The suggestion for The Outcasts of Poker Flat was found therein by Bret Harte, as previously noted. On page 354 the Doctor says,--      A \"majestic-looking Spaniard\" had quarreled with an Irishman about     a Mexican girl (\"Shirley\" for the first time, I think, thus showing     a knowledge of the presence at Indian Bar of those women who seem,     in the bright and orderly days of her first arrival, to have been     actually unknown in the camp). The Mexican, having at last stabbed     and killed the other, fled to the hills.  It does not appear from the letter that a girl of any kind was involved in this stabbing and death. Shirley distinguishes between the Spaniard and the Mexican; the Doctor does not. As to the presence of \"those women,\" Shirley, without commenting, sheds much light upon that subject, as will be perceived from the following extracts. Dr. Royce's review does not coincide with the facts.      Seven miners from Old Spain, enraged at the cruel treatment which     their countrymen had received on the Fourth,... had united for the     purpose of taking revenge on seven Americans. All well armed,...     intending to challenge each one his man,... on arriving at Indian     Bar ... they drank a most enormous quantity of champagne and     claret. Afterwards they proceeded to [a vile resort kept by an     Englishman], when one of them commenced a playful conversation with     one of his countrywomen. This enraged the Englishman, who instantly     struck the Spaniard a violent blow.... Thereupon ensued a spirited     fight, which ... ended without bloodshed.... Soon after,... Tom     Somers, who is said always to have been a dangerous person when in     liquor, without any apparent provocation struck Domingo (one of the     original seven) a violent blow.... The latter,... mad with wine,     rage, and revenge, without an instant's pause drew his knife and     inflicted a fatal wound upon his insulter. [Post, p. 271.]      In the bakeshop, which stands next door to our cabin, young Tom     Somers lay straightened for the grave (he lived but fifteen minutes     after he was wounded), while over his dead body a Spanish woman was     weeping and moaning in the most piteous and heartrending manner.     [Post, p. 264.]      Domingo, with a Mexicana hanging upon his arm, and brandishing     threateningly the long, bloody knife,... was parading up and down     the street unmolested.... The [Americans] rallied and made a rush     at the murderer, who immediately plunged into the river and swam     across,... and without doubt is now safe in Mexico. [Post, p. 263.]  A disregard of exactness is not peculiar to Dr. Royce. Secondary authorities are generally open to criticism. Of the authenticity of Shirley's facts there can be no question. Dr. Royce recognized this, while subjecting the work of other writers to severe scrutiny. But Shirley's printer did her much evil. It is not necessary here to say much concerning trade usages in making an author's manuscript presentable in type,--the essentially different ways of and differences between the job, the newspaper, and the book printer. Shirley's letters, not having been written for publication, required exceptional care while being put in type, and especially so since the manuscript was not prepared for the press. It is amusing to read what the printers of the Pioneer have to say of themselves.      Our facilities for doing FINE BOOK WORK, are very great, possessing     as we do, large founts of new type, and an ADAMS POWER PRESS. We     refer to the Pioneer Magazine, as a specimen. We have in use a     MAMMOTH PRESS, which gives us a great advantage in the execution of     the LARGEST SIZE MAMMOTH POSTERS, in colors or plain.  In the estimation of the printers, the matériel was the principal thing; the personnel, not worthy of mention,--and it so happened that it wasn't, for, judging from the typographical inaccuracies of the Pioneer, the compositors were of a very low order of intelligence, and if a proof-reader was employed, he assuredly stood high in their estimation, as he evidently caused them but little trouble.  Much has been said by writers on matters typographical as to what is meet and necessary in the reprinting of a book, and much more on literary blunders and mistakes. Some printers are rash, and perpetrate a worse blunder than that attempted to be corrected in reprinting. Worse than such people are the amateur proof-readers, who generally run to extremes, that is, they either cannot see a blunder, and hence pass it unchallenged, or else they manifest a disposition to challenge and \"improve\" everything they do not comprehend, and, knowing nothing of typographical usages or style, they are a decidedly malignant quantity.  Every old printer knows, what is often said, that English is a grammarless tongue, and that no grammarian ever wrote a sentence worth reading. No proof-reader, with the experience of a printer behind him, will change a logically expressed idea so as to make it conform to grammatical rules, nor will he harass the author thereof with suggestions looking to that end.  Critical readers of these Letters must ever bear in mind the fact that Shirley was not writing for publication, and that the printer of this edition had no desire to and did not alter Shirley's text to suit his ideas of what was fitting and proper, further than to smooth or round out in many instances rugged or careless construction. Punctuation, hyphenization, capitalization, italicizing, spelling, required much, and of course received much, attention.  In some instances where Shirley does not express her meaning clearly, and reconstruction seemed necessary, no change was made. Singularly, this was the case in the first sentence of the first letter.      I can easily imagine, dear M., the look of large wonder which     gleams from your astonished eyes when they fall upon the date of     this letter.  M. could be astonished but once, but the language used conveys the idea of wonder arising each time the letter is read; then, again, it is the place-name, and not the date, that is to cause wonder to gleam from astonished eyes, as the context shows.  Where reconstruction was not needed to make the meaning clear, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23286"],["title","The Rover Boys Under Canvas; Or, The Mystery of the Wrecked Submarine (#1)"],["body","river is!\" added Randy Rover.  The next ball to come in was a wide out-curve, and again Jack let it pass him.  \"Ball two!\" shouted the umpire.  \"That's the way to do it, Jack! Make 'em give you what you want!\"  With two balls against him, the noted pitcher for the high school exercised a little more care in his next delivery. He sent in a straight, swift one, directly over the outer point of the plate. It was not exactly what Jack desired, but it was good enough, and he swung at it with all his strength. Crack! And the ball went sailing directly over the head of the shortstop and into the field beyond.  \"Run, Jack! Run! It's good for a two-bagger!\"  \"Leg it, Dan! Leg it for home!\"  \"Send the ball in, Wiffles! Don't let 'em get home!\"  These and a hundred other cries rang out as nearly every spectator sprang to his or her feet in the excitement. Dan Soppinger, half way to third when Jack made the hit, had now touched that bag and was tearing for the home plate.  In the meantime Jack, running like a deer, had passed first and was making for second. The shortstop had made a high but ineffectual jump for the ball, and now he and the fielder behind him were both after the sphere. There was a short mix-up, and then the fielder sent the ball with unerring aim toward the catcher at the home plate.  \"Slide, Dan, slide!\"  And then Dan Soppinger, running as he had never run before, dropped down and slid to the plate amid a whirl of dust, followed instantly by the ball, which landed with a thud in the catcher's mitt.  \"He's safe! He's safe!\"  \"And look! Jack Rover is going to make third!\"  Realizing that it was too late to catch the man at the plate, the catcher threw the ball down to second. But Jack Rover had already started for third, and now he streaked along with all his might, arriving at that bag just an instant before the ball followed him.  \"That's the way to do it, boy! Keep it up!\"  \"Oh, he made three bases!\" cried one of the girls in the grandstand. \"Isn't that just lovely?\"  \"I told you he'd do it, Ruth,\" said another of the girls.  \"I wish my cousin Dick was coming up,\" remarked one of the girls. \"I'm sure he would be able to help them out.\"  \"Never mind, May. He'll be coming up pretty soon,\" answered Ruth Stevenson.  The next cadet to the bat was Walt Baxter. Walt was a good all-around player, but just at present he was not in the best of condition, having suffered from a touch of the grippe early in the season.  \"Bang out a homer, Walt!\" sang out Andy Rover.  \"Never mind that, Walt. Make a safe hit and bring Jack in,\" said Gif Garrison.  \"I'll do my best,\" answered Walt Baxter. But it was plainly to be seen that his recent illness had rendered him somewhat nervous. He had a ball and a strike called on him, and then got another strike through a little foul that passed over one of the coaches' heads. Then Dink Wilsey passed him a slow, tantalizing ball. Walt connected with it but sent up only a pop fly, which the third baseman gathered in with ease.  \"Hurrah! that's the way to hold 'em down,\" came the cry from one of the high-school boys.  \"Gee, old man, it's too bad you didn't have a chance to bring that run in,\" remarked Gif Garrison to Jack Rover, as the latter walked in from third base.  \"Well, anyway, I brought Dan in,\" returned Jack, as cheerfully as he could.  \"Yes; but if you had got in that would have tied the score,\" went on the manager. \"However, the game isn't over yet.\"  \"Over! Why, we've just begun to play!\" returned Jack, with a grin.  \"That's the talk!\" cried Andy Rover. \"Colby Hall forever! Now then, boys, all together!\" he yelled, turning to the grandstand. And a moment later there boomed out this refrain:      \"Who are we?      Can't you see?      Colby Hall!      Dum! Dum! Dum, dum, dum!      Here we come with fife and drum!      Colby! Colby! Colby Hall!\"  And then followed a great yelling and tooting of horns and sounding of rattles.  \"My gracious! if they keep on I'll surely become deaf,\" said Martha Rover.  \"I think I had better retire from this game,\" remarked Walt Baxter, as he faced the manager. \"I told you I didn't feel like going in, and now I am sure I should have kept out of it.\"  \"All right, Walt. I'll be sorry to lose you,\" answered Gif. And then he told Andy Rover to get ready to get into the game.  With a score still 4 to 3 in their favor, Hixley High opened the seventh inning with vigor. They managed to get a man on first, and then on a sacrifice advanced him to second. Then came a two-bagger, and the play made by Colby Hall in the ending of the sixth inning was repeated by their opponents, thus making the score 5 to 3.  On their part Colby Hall tried its best to score during the seventh, but was doomed to disappointment.  Then came the eighth inning with a goose egg placed on the board for each nine.  \"Say, this begins to look bad for us,\" remarked Will Hendry, the fattest boy at Colby Hall. \"It looks as if Hixley High was going to have a sweet revenge.\"  In the Hixley High half of the ninth inning Dink Wilsey showed what a very good all-around player he was. The noted pitcher cracked out a home run, making the tally with ease. Fortunately this was at a time when there was no one on base, so that only one run was scored. Two men were out, and the next player knocked a fly to short, which was gathered in by Frank Newberry with ease.  \"Hurrah! Score another for Hixley High!\"  \"That makes the score six to three!\"  \"I guess this game is as good as won!\"  So the cries ran on among the high-school scholars and their friends. The Colby Hall contingent was, of course, much downcast, but they refused to show it, and once more the slogan of the military academy boomed forth.  \"Now, boys, pull yourselves together and go at 'em hammer and tongs,\" cried Gif Garrison. \"Watch the pitcher. Don't let Dink put anything over you.\"  Fred Rover was at the bat, and he managed to make a safe hit. He was followed by a player who made another safe hit, thus advancing Fred to second. Then came two outs, but in the mix-up Fred managed to steal to third, while the player on first got down to second. Jack Rover was now once more to the bat, and all of his friends were yelling at the top of their lungs for him to \"Knock the hide off the ball!\" \"Send it over the back fence!\" \"Show 'em where the other side of the river is!\" and to \"Wipe up the field with Hixley High!\"  One ball was called, and then a strike. Then came another strike, and things began to look gloomy for Colby Hall. But then Jack got a ball exactly where he wanted it, and he swung at it with every ounce of muscle he could command. Crack! went the bat, and the sphere went sailing far down in left field.  \"That's the way to do it! Run, boys, run!\"  \"Come on home, Jack!\"  Fred, on third, was already streaking for home, and close behind him came the player who had been on second. In the meanwhile, Jack raced to first and around to second, and then came plowing up to third.  \"Hold it, Rover! Hold it!\"  \"Come on in--don't wait! Come on in!\"  Jack looked down into the field and saw that the fielder was just in the act of picking up the ball. With a great bound, he started for the home plate, and when ten feet from that place dropped to the ground and slid in with the rapidity of lightning.  \"He's safe! A home run!\"  \"That ties the score!\"  \"Now then, boys, go in and finish 'em up!\"  The din and excitement was now tremendous. The score was indeed a tie. Which club would win?     CHAPTER II  ABOUT THE ROVER BOYS   \"Now then, fellows, don't forget to bring in the winning run!\"  \"Show Hixley High what we can do!\"  And then came a rousing cheer from the Colby Hall cadets, and once more they gave the well-known military academy refrain.  Any ordinary pitcher might have been nervous over the prospect ahead of him; but Dink Wilsey was not one of that caliber, and he faced the next batsman as coolly as he had all of the others. Two balls were called, and then two strikes, and then two more balls, and the batsman walked to first base.  \"Hurrah! he's afraid to give him the kind we chew up.\"  \"Maybe he'll let the next man walk, too!\" cried another.  But this was not to be. The next cadet up went out on a foul, and the inning came to a sudden end.  \"A tie! A tie! The game is a tie!\"  \"Now for the winning run! Hixley High!\"  \"That's the stuff! Larsen to the bat! And, my, won't he wallop that ball!\"  Larsen was the Hixley High center fielder--a tall, sturdy youth with blue eyes and light hair, of Norwegian descent. He came to the plate with a \"do-or-die\" look on his face. He allowed two balls to pass him, only one of which, however, was called a strike. Then he made a sweep for the next ball, sending it out in a red-hot liner toward Jack.  Many a young ball player would have stepped out of the way with such a red-hot variety of baseball coming his way. But not so Jack Rover. Like a flash his hands went out and he caught the ball firmly, although the impact of the sphere whirled him half way around.  \"Gee, look at that!\"  \"I wouldn't have caught that ball for a thousand dollars!\"  A great shout of approval rang out, and during this Gif hurried over to Jack's side.  \"How about it--did it hurt you any?\" he questioned quickly.  \"It stung me a little, that's all,\" was Jack's reply. His hands burnt like fire, but he did not intend to let anybody know it.  \"One down! Now for the other two!\" came the cry.  \"Not much! Here is where we score!\"  But alas for the hopes of Hixley High! The next man up went out on strikes, and the fellow to follow knocked a foul which was easily gathered in by the third baseman.  \"Now here is where we bring home the bacon!\" cried Ned Lowe, one of the Colby Hall fans.  Andy Rover had been burning to distinguish himself, and now his chance came. First to the bat, he made a very neat base hit. Then, however, came an out, and the Colby Hall boys were, for a moment, downcast. But they quickly recovered when the next player made a single"]]]
