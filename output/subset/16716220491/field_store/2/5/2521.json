It is to him that the chronicler William of Malmesbury dedicated his work.  Robert Fitzroy died in Gloucester in 1147, but was buried at St. James' Priory, Bristol, another foundation which was indebted to his munificence. His successor was William Fitzcount, the second Earl of Gloucester.  In 1178 the monastery was partly burnt down, the church fortunately suffering but little. There are some slight traces of fire on the exterior walls of the south and west faces of the tower, and on the interior of the south transept. The Annals of Winton say, \"_Combusta est et redacta in pulverem Ecclesia de Theokesberia_\"--an untenable hypothesis; but the Tewkesbury Chronicles merely mention that the monastery and the offices were destroyed. John, Earl of Cornwall, better known as King John, was entertained in the monastery soon afterwards, so that the damage cannot have been quite so overwhelming as the Winchester Chronicles allege it to have been. The fire might have been much more serious than it was, and it seems that only the fact of the wind being north-east saved the church. Judging by the marks of calcination on the outside of the tower, and the chief arch of the south transept, the roof must have been seriously damaged, and the roof of the cloister walk abutting on to the south aisle must have been completely burned. In all probability the group of roofing next to the south transept was destroyed.  William Fitzcount, dying in 1183, after a long and successful life, was buried at Keynsham, a magnificent abbey built by him in memory of a son who died young. Earl William's other children were girls, and the lordship of Gloucester was vested in Henry II. for some years. In 1189 the Abbey lands were granted by Richard I. to his brother John (who was afterwards king, 1199 to 1215), the first husband of Isabella, third daughter of William Fitzcount. Being divorced from John after his accession in 1199, she married Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex, who paid 20,000 marks for the honour of Gloucester and the possessions of the Lady Isabel.  The earldom of Gloucester finally passed in 1221 to Amice--sister of the Lady Isabella--great granddaughter of Fitz-Hamon the founder, who had married Richard de Clare, Earl of Hertford. This Richard de Clare was the ancestor of the Tewkesbury De Clares, a family which held the honour of Tewkesbury for nearly a century.  His son, Gilbert de Clare, married Isabelle de Marechal. His name, as also that of his father, is among the signatories of Magna Charta, and he was a strenuous supporter of the barons against the King. Though he died in Brittany, his body was brought home and buried in Tewkesbury, at the foot of the steps leading up to the high altar. In a few months' time his widow, Isabelle, married Richard, Earl of Cornwall, brother of King Henry III. At her death she wished to be buried next to Gilbert de Clare, but as her husband objected to this, she bequeathed her heart to the Abbey, and this was duly interred in Gilbert de Clare's grave. As the Register quaintly says in its rhyming hexameters--      \"Postrema voce legavit cor comitissa     Pars melior toto fuit huc pro corpore missa     Hæc se divisit dominum recolendo priorem     Huc cor quod misit verum testatur amorem     His simul ecclesiæ sanctæ suffragia prosint     Ut simul in requie cælesti cum Domino sint.\"  Gilbert de Clare bequeathed to the Abbey the manor called Mythe, on the hill just outside the town, and Isabelle also left to it many relics, besides vestments, and much valuable church furniture.  On the death of Gilbert de Clare, his son Richard became a ward of the King. Marrying Margaret de Burgh, a daughter of the great Earl of Kent, without permission, he incurred the royal displeasure, and was eventually forced to divorce his young wife in favour of the lady chosen for him. He supported the barons against the King, with whom he had never been in agreement. In 1262 he died, and was buried in the Abbey. One of his wife's sisters married Robert Bruce, competitor for the Scottish Crown and grandfather of King Robert Bruce.  His son Gilbert the second, Rufus or Rubens, _i.e._ Red, is another well-known figure. Like his father, he at first supported the barons, but soon after the battle of Lewes he took the King's side, and fought for him at Evesham. Again from pique he deserted him, returning to his allegiance once more in 1270. He was buried in the Abbey in 1295.  Gilbert de Clare the third, who was born at Tewkesbury in 1291, was perhaps the most famous of the De Clares. Whilst he was still in early manhood, he was twice chosen by Edward II. to serve as Regent of England in his absence, once even before he had attained full age. His promising career was cut short at Bannockburn in 1314, and the last of the De Clares was buried in the Choir in 1314, his widow being placed later by his side.  The lordship of Tewkesbury then passed from the De Clares, who had held it for ninety years, to Eleanor, Gilbert's eldest sister. By her marriage in 1321 to Hugh le Despenser, the lordship came into the hands of the Despensers. This Hugh the younger, or Hugo Secundus as the Register calls him, was too faithful a supporter of Edward II., and he paid for his fidelity with his life in 1326, having been hanged, drawn, and quartered in Hereford about three weeks after his aged father had suffered a similar fate at Bristol. His remains were collected and buried in the tomb at the back of the sedilia, where Abbot John's tomb was placed at a later date.  The next lord of Tewkesbury was Hugh, the son of Hugh the younger and Eleanor de Clare. His tomb is to be seen on the north side of the high altar, with his effigy upon it, together with that of his wife, the Lady Elizabeth, who, though thrice married, preferred to be buried with him. She retained the manor of Tewkesbury after her marriage to Sir Guy de Brien, and on her death in 1359 it passed to her nephew, Edward le Despenser.  This Edward le Despenser took part in the battle of Poitiers, and was one of the first Knights of the Garter. On his death at Cardiff in 1375 his body was brought to Tewkesbury, and his effigy is to be seen on the roof of the Trinity Chapel on the south side of the high altar. He was buried close to the presbytery, and his wife was, in 1409, buried next to him.  Thomas le Despenser, the third son of Edward, was for two years only Earl of Gloucester, and being attainted, was executed at Bristol in 1400. No trace remains of his grave at Tewkesbury.     [Illustration: RICHARD BEAUCHAMP, FIRST HUSBAND OF ISABELLE    DESPENSER, AND HIS ARMORIAL CONNECTIONS.    From the _Registrum Theokusburiæ._    (_H.J.L.J.M._)]  With the death of his son Richard in 1414, the lordship of the Despensers in the male line, after ninety-three years, became extinct.  Once again the Manor of Tewkesbury passed by the female line, and into the distinguished family of the Beauchamps, with whom Richard le Despenser's sister Isabelle was connected by her marriage with Richard Beauchamp, or Ricardus de Bello Campo as the Register calls him when it does not give his name as Becham. He was killed at the siege of Breaux in France in 1421, and his young widow erected the sumptuous chantry chapel known as the Warwick Chapel over his remains. She then, by special papal dispensation, married her cousin, also a Richard Beauchamp, and from henceforth was generally known by her new title, the Countess of Warwick. On her husband's death at Rouen in 1439, she brought his body to England and had it conveyed to the Beauchamp Chapel at Warwick. The widowed countess died in December of the same year, but elected to be buried at Tewkesbury.  Her young son Henry was a favourite of Henry VI., who bestowed most unusual favours upon him, creating him Duke of Warwick and King of the Isle of Wight, and later King of Jersey and Guernsey. The young Duke, who was married to Cicely Neville, died at the age of twenty-one, and was buried in the choir of the Abbey. As he left no children, the manor passed in 1449 to his sister Anne, the wife of Richard Neville the \"King-maker.\" All the \"King-maker's\" estates were confiscated to the Crown after he fell at Barnet in 1471, but were eventually shared between his two daughters Isabelle and Anne. Isabelle married George, Duke of Clarence, Earl of Warwick and Salisbury, who in 1477, a few days after Isabelle's supposed death by poison at Warwick, was put to death in the Tower. Both were buried at Tewkesbury (_vide_ p. 62).  The young Edward, son of the Duke of Clarence, was imprisoned in the Tower till his execution in 1499.  The Manor of Tewkesbury, as a possession of the Warwicks, passed into the hands of Lord Seymour of Sudeley, the husband of Catharine Parr, until his attainder, when they once more came into the hands of the Crown. James I. sold the manor to the Corporation in 1609. During the present century the lordship of the manor again passed by sale into private hands.  In the chronicles of the Abbey the following facts are recorded:--  In 1218 the dormitory roof fell down upon the monks when they returned from an early service, and Gilbert, a monk, had a thigh broken and his head injured, while the Prior Gunfrey escaped unhurt.  In 1224, Robert Travers, Bishop of Kildelo (_i.e._ Killaloe), in the winter dedicated two large bells in the tower.  In 1234 the principal gate of the monastery and two stables were burnt down.  In 1237, Hervey de Sipton, the then Prior, pulled down and rebuilt the chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas. Nothing can be said definitely as to its size, owing to the later work done in this part. The chronicle, however, distinctly states that divine service was first held in Prior Sipton's new chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas, on St. Nicholas' Day.[2]  The roof bears the arms of the Clares and Despensers, and this would "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22265"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Cruise (#1)"],["body","to-morrow morning,\" said Frank. \"Here is a friend of mine who will require a suit like the others.\"  \"That is crowding us somewhat, sir,\" smiled the tailor. \"I hardly think we can----\"  \"I will pay five dollars extra if the suit is delivered at the American House at six o'clock in the morning,\" said Frank, quietly.  \"Very well, sir. I think that will cover the extra expense of rushing it through. If the gentleman will step back this way, his measure will be taken.\"  So Jack was measured, and, ten minutes after entering the store, the boys left it.  \"He didn't even ask a deposit of you, Merry,\" said Jack, in surprise.  \"No. Benjamin vouched for me, and that was all that was necessary. No deposit was required under such circumstances.\"  \"What if he fails to get the suits round on time?\"  \"He won't. He wouldn't want them left on his hands.\"  Frank's confidence reassured Jack, and they strolled over toward Tremont Street and finally came out at the Common.  \"I'd like to have a little time to look Boston over?\" said Jack.  \"You can do that when we come back. If you were to stop long enough to take in all the interesting sights, we wouldn't get down into Maine this summer. I want to spend a little more time in Boston, although I have seen Faneuil Hall, the new Public Library Building, the Old South Church, Bunker Hill Monument and a hundred other interesting things. The business portion of Boston is not particularly attractive, but the suburbs and the aristocratic dwelling sections are beautiful.\"  They walked across the Common to the Public Gardens, then turned round and strolled back. From Tremont Row they went down Temple Street to Washington, and just as they reached Jordan, Marsh & Co.'s store, two girls stepped out upon the sidewalk and came face to face with them.  \"Miss Burrage!\" exclaimed Diamond, lifting his hat.  \"Inza!\" cried Frank, also lifting his hat. \"Miss Benjamin, too! This is an unexpected pleasure. Miss Benjamin, permit me to present a particular friend of mine, Mr. Jack Diamond, of Virginia.\"  Paula Benjamin was a pretty girl. Her eyes met Jack's, and she showed her pearly teeth in a most bewitching smile as she bowed, saying:  \"I have heard of Mr. Diamond.\"  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Jack. \"I was not aware I was quite as famous.\"  \"Yes. My brother mentioned you. Perhaps you know something of him--his name is Jack. He plays on the Harvard eleven.\"  \"And he spoke of me? That is surprising. Don't see what he could have said about me.\"  \"I don't believe I will tell,\" laughed the girl, and her manner aroused all of the Virginian's curiosity.  \"Please tell,\" he urged, smiling.  \"Well,\" hesitated Paula, still laughing, \"before the game on Jarvis Field, he said you were fool enough to think Frank Merriwell could beat the whole Harvard eleven. After the game he said you weren't half the fool he took you for.\"  This caused them all to laugh, and, as the street was crowded, they strolled on together.  \"Oh, Frank!\" exclaimed Inza; \"you can't guess what we are going to do!\"  \"Then I will give it up without trying. What is it?\"  \"Paula and I are going to Bar Harbor.\"  \"What?\"  \"It's true.\"  \"I am astonished!\"  \"I knew you would be. We've been talking about it, you know--saying we'd like to go. Yesterday Paula had a letter from her cousin, who is spending the summer down there. Her cousin urged her to come. Paula's mother said it was impossible, as two girls like us should not be traveling about alone. Then Aunt Abigail said she'd like to spend a week or two in Bar Harbor herself, and she volunteered to chaperone us. After a while, Paula obtained her mother's consent, and we take the Bangor boat for Rockland to-morrow night.\"  \"By Jove, this is interesting! We'll have to run in to Bar Harbor and see you on our cruise. I didn't suppose we would see much of each other after leaving Fardale.\"  \"I didn't know as you would care about that,\" said Inza, carelessly.  \"Care!\" exclaimed Frank. \"You should know I would care. How can you say anything like that! What made you imagine I wouldn't care?\"  \"Oh, something!\"  \"Something! What was it? Tell me, Inza.\"  \"Sometime--perhaps.\"  \"Tell me now,\" urged Frank, in his masterful way. \"During the last of my stay in Fardale I noticed a change in your treatment of me, Inza.\"  \"Did you?\" she murmured, lifting her eyebrows.  \"Yes. You were cold toward me, and you seemed to shun me. If I tried to be friendly, as in the old days, you would not give me the opportunity. I did not understand it.\"  \"That is singular. The reason was plain enough.\"  \"If so, I must have been thick-witted.\"  \"Elsie Bellwood was there.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I read your secret. You made your choice between us.\"  Frank was astounded.  \"Choice? What can you mean, Inza? I did not make any choice.\"  \"Oh, but you did!\"  \"If you say so--but I--really----\"  \"You made your choice that time when the boat upset, and we were struggling in the water, Elsie and I. You plunged in to her rescue. I was quite as near to you as was Elsie--nearer, if anything.\"  Frank caught his breath, beginning to realize what she meant. Inza went on:  \"You swam to Elsie's rescue--you saved her. That was the test. I brought it about, for I upset the boat intentionally to settle the point. I wanted to know which one of us you cared the most for--and I found out!\"  It was like her, Frank realized that. He knew she was telling the truth when she said she upset the boat intentionally.  \"But you--you could swim some, Inza. I knew it.\"  \"Did you know Elsie could not swim?\"  \"N--no.\"  \"She is the daughter of a sea captain, and she has been with him on many voyages. There was every reason to suppose that she could swim quite as well as I--or better. No, Frank, you made your choice between us that day. It's all right,\" and she forced a laugh that was not very musical. \"I don't deny that, at one time, I did think more of you than any other fellow. There was every reason why I should. You saved me from a mad dog, saved me from death beneath a railroad engine, saved me from drowning. But I am not a fool, if I am a girl! I have not been taking stock in all the passionate love stories I have read. I got out of the way. I remained Elsie's friend, for she is the sweetest girl I know. I don't blame you for thinking more of her than you do of me.\"  \"Inza!\"  Frank uttered the word in protest; it was all he could say.  \"You can't deny it, so don't try,\" came almost harshly from the girl. \"It's all right. We're still friends. We'll always be friends--nothing more. Sometime I'll be bridesmaid at the wedding, and----\"  But Frank had heard enough, and he stopped her.  \"I am not likely to marry anyone very soon,\" he said. \"Elsie knows that. Let's talk about something else. How did it happen we met you?\"  Inza seemed willing enough to permit the conversation to be turned into another channel.  \"We were out shopping, you know--making our last purchases before starting for Bar Harbor. You must take us out on your yacht after we all get down there.\"  \"I'll do it. Your aunt----\"  \"Oh, she will not object. You know she thinks you the finest fellow in all the world. She will come along.\"  At last the boys were forced to part from the girls, but Jack had made such progress with Paula that she offered him her hand at parting, saying laughingly:  \"Next fall you will not pick the winner if you pick Yale, even if Mr. Merriwell is on that eleven. If you want to keep your record for wisdom, be careful.\"  \"Jove!\" exclaimed Jack, after they had seen the girls on board a car. \"She's a way-upper, Merry!\"  \"She's a good sample of the Boston girl.\"  \"Eh? Where's her glasses?\"  \"You have been reading the comic papers.\"  \"She didn't mention Emerson or Browning.\"  \"And that surprised you?\"  \"Why, I didn't suppose the genuine Boston girl could talk ten minutes without doing so.\"  \"Boston girls are very much like other nice girls, old man. They are well educated, refined and all that, but they are not always quoting Emerson and Browning, they do not all wear glasses, they are not all cold and freezing and they are handsome.\"  They came to Cornhill. A car was coming down from Scollay Square, and they paused close to it to let it swing out upon Washington Street.  Just as the front of the car approached, Frank Merriwell received a push from behind that sent him flat upon the track directly in front of the car wheels!  That particular car did not have a fender, and it seemed that Frank must be mangled beneath the wheels. The motorman saw the lad go down and put on the brake hard, but he could not stop the car in time.  Frank realized that he had been pushed upon the track by some one whose deliberate purpose it was to maim or murder him, but he could not save himself. He struck the paving, and the iron wheels seemed right upon him.  But Jack Diamond moved with marvelous quickness. He made a grasp at Frank as the latter fell, almost caught him, then stooped, grasped his coat and yanked Merry from the track.  The car brushed Frank as it passed, but he was not injured.  \"Thank you, old man,\" said Merriwell, as he quickly rose to his feet. \"You saved me that time. But who pushed me?\"  They looked about. A small crowd had witnessed Frank's peril and gathered. In the crowd was a person slipping away. With a bound Frank was after him, caught him by the shoulder, swung him to get a look at his face.  \"Get out!\"  The fellow snarled the words and struck at Frank's face with his clinched hand.  Frank dodged.  \"Wat Snell!\" he cried, astounded.  \"Yes, Wat Snell!\" grated the other, who was a boy well known to him--a boy who had been his enemy years before at Fardale Academy, when they both went to school.  \"You pushed me!\" accused Frank.  \"You lie! I did not touch you! You fell.\"  \"I felt you push me, you miserable dog!\"  \"Don't dare talk like that to me!\" hissed Snell. \"I'll have you----\"  \"What! You don't dare do anything that is cowardly and treacherous! You did push me!\"  \"That's right!\" exclaimed a boy. \"I seen "]]]
