It was just as Draycott had made the unpleasant discovery that no longer did the weekly boat run from Marseilles to Tunis and thence to Malta, and was debating on the rival merits of a journey through Italy, and thence by Syracuse to the island of goats; or a journey through Spain to Gibraltar, and thence by sea--with luck, that a railway magnate entered and gave his celebrated rendering of a boiler explosion.  It appeared--when every one had partially recovered--that he was the proud possessor of ten francs and three sous.  He also admitted to a wife suffering from something with a name that hurt, and various young railway magnates of both sexes.  It transpired that the ten francs and three sous had been laboriously collected from his _ménage_ only that morning; that the youngest hopeful had wept copiously on losing her life's savings; and further, that it was the limit of his resources.  He had letters of credit, or something dangerous of that sort, to the extent of a few million; he was prepared to buy the whole one-donkey country by a stroke of the pen, but--in hard cash--he had ten francs and three sous. . . .  It was pathetic; it was dreadful.  An American multi-millionaire, one of those strange beings of whom one reads, who corner tin-tacks and things, and ruin or make thousands with a word, reduced to ten francs and three sous.  For not another cent piece did America's pride obtain; not another sou to add to the three.  Politely, firmly, a harassed clerk shooed him away.  No, he could not tell him when the next boat would sail--perhaps to-morrow, perhaps in a fortnight.  He did not know, and he did not care how he proposed to live during that period, and he had no intention of furnishing him with any money to do it with.  He had definite orders from his firm: no cheques cashed under any circumstances whatever.  He was sorry the gentleman didn't like Marseilles, or war, or France, or him personally; he regretted deeply that the gentleman's wife liked peaches with every meal, and hoped he'd manage all right on his ten francs; he----  And then came the interruption.  They crowded to the door, and watched them coming.  Occasionally a cheer rang out, but for the most part they came in silence, passing through the ranks of people that lined the road each side.  Half way down the column a band blared forth, and every now and then the Colonel in front lifted his right hand gravely in a salute.  They were small men, the poilus of that regiment; but they marched well, with a swing, and the glint of white teeth.  Sometimes they waved a greeting to a girl on the footpath, and she would smile back, or throw them a flower or a kiss.  And like a ripple going down the lines of spectators, men took off their hats suddenly.  The Colours were passing. . . .  Almost dazedly the American took off his hat as the ripple reached him; then he put it on again and turned to Draycott.  \"Hell!\" he remarked tersely, \"and I've been worry in' over a ten-franc note.  I guess I feel a bit small.\"  He turned and followed the regiment, with his hands deep in his pockets, and his shoulders squared.   VI  It came through the following afternoon--the news they had been waiting for; and now for a certain period the curtain of discretion must be drawn.  I gather that Draycott has dim recollections of a stout field officer endeavouring to stand on a small marble-topped table, with a glass of beer in each hand.  He was making a speech--chiefly in Hindustani--to the frenzied mob of cheering Frenchmen around him.  Then he came to the point when the best people say \"Vive la France!\"  He remembered he had a hat on; he remembered he ought to take it off; he did.  The only thing he forgot was the beer.  But as he said later when they sorted him out, it was an old suit, and England didn't declare war every day. . . .  The following night they left in an ancient old cargo boat, skippered by the type of man who has since made our mercantile marine the glory of the world.  His job was to get his peculiarly odoriferous cargo home to his owners as soon as possible; beyond that he either failed or refused to look.  The entire German Navy might have been waiting outside for all he cared; he merely consumed a little more whisky, and conducted morning prayers.  He would give them no assurance; they went at their own risk, but, if the boat got there, he would land them at Gibraltar.  And having thought the matter over, and realised that firstly a journey through Italy might result in their being kept as prisoners of war; secondly, that a journey through Spain would probably take a fortnight at least; and thirdly, that any way they could do neither as they could get no money, Draycott and his friends embarked with the patent manure, and watched the lights of Marseilles growing fainter and fainter till they dropped below the horizon astern.  It was an uneventful voyage, and never for one hour after the first day were they out of sight of land.  It was the only concession the skipper would make for the safety of his boat; and so they jogged along at a peaceful ten knots and watched the sun set each evening in a blaze of golden glory over the rocky coast of Spain.  For the first time since leaving England a week before, they were able to think.  In the rush to Paris, in the horse-box to Marseilles, in Marseilles itself, they had been too busy.  Besides, they were outsiders. . . .  Now, England was in it; the thing which they had known in their hearts was coming, ever since a kindly senior subaltern had first taken it upon himself to shape their destinies, had actually come.  And bitterest thought of all--_they_ were not there.  \"It can't last more than three months.\"  A pessimistic garrison gunner from Malta, who was playing patience, cheated savagely.  \"I tell you no European country could stand it.\"  Undoubtedly the fatuous drivel of certain writers had influenced even the Army itself.  \"Peace will be declared before Christmas.  An' I'll have sat on that cursed island, and whenever I see a ship I'd like to poop at, the searchlight will go out, an' I'll be bitten by sand flies.\"  He glared morosely at Draycott; until, suddenly, a dawning look of joy spread over his face. \"It's coming out.  I swear it's coming out!\"  \"You cheated,\" remarked an onlooker cruelly.  \"I saw you with my own eyes.\"  It was then that he burst into tears. . . .  Shut off as they were from the outside world--the old tramp had no wireless--they could only wonder, and wait, fuming with impatience. What had happened?  Had the fleets met?  Had the wonderful day which the German Navy was popularly supposed to be living for--had it arrived?  And if it had--what had been the result?  They could only lean over the stern and try and grasp the one monumental fact--war. And what did it hold in store? . . .  Visions of forlorn hopes, visions of glory, visions of the glamour of war rose unbidden in their minds.  And then, when they had got as far as that, the smell of that patent manure obtruded itself once again, and the dreamers of honours to come passed sadly down the gangway to the Levantine villain who presided over the vermouth and the gin. Which might be taken as the text for a sermon on things as they are. In this war it is the patent manure and the vermouth which dominate the situation as far as the fighters, at any rate, are concerned.  The talkers may think otherwise, may prate of soul-stirring motives, and great ideals.  But for the soldiers, life is a bit too grim and overpowering for gloss.  After a spell they come for their vermouth, for something to help nerves a trifle jangled, something to give a contrast to stark reality, and having had it they go back again to the patent manure; while the onlookers see visions and dream dreams.  I suppose it's a fair division of labour! . . .   VII  It was the distinguished-looking gentleman in blue who came alongside just after they dropped anchor at the Rock, who brought the glorious news.  He ascended the gangway with great dignity, and disappeared into some secret place with the skipper.  After some delay and a slight commotion, various flags were hoisted, and he majestically appeared again.  It seemed that the hoisting of the flags had apparently been successful.  Suspicion had been averted by this simple act; there was no longer any danger of being made a target for enthusiastic gunners. And, what was more to the point, the distinguished gentleman was now free to impart his great tidings.  \"The German fleet, gentlemen,\" he remarked genially, \"has ceased to exist.\"  \"Who said so?\" asked a doubting voice.  \"It is in all the Spanish papers.\"  The Admiral, or whatever he was, eyed the speaker compassionately.  \"A great action has taken place in the North Sea; we have lost nineteen big ships in addition to destroyers, and the German fleet is wiped out.\"  \"It doesn't seem good enough, does it?\" murmured a graceless member of the group.  \"But if it's really authentic?\"  Draycott turned to him doubtfully. \"And there must be something in it if it's in all the Spanish papers.\"  \"On the contrary,\" returned the graceless one.  \"It is precisely that fact that makes me believe there is nothing in it.\"  The remark seemed conclusive; and yet so detailed was the information all over Gib, so definite the lists of vessels sunk on each side, that even intelligent Scorps--as the inhabitants of the place are known--were impressed.  Strangely enough, exactly the same detailed lists, with just sufficient difference to make them credible, were in all the Italian papers at the same time--though this only transpired later.  At the moment nothing much mattered but the time of the next boat going East: it was their own little personal future that counted.  A naval battle--yes, perhaps; nineteen ships down--the German fleet as well; fifty or sixty thousand men--gone, finished, wiped out.

And beside each bundle was a valise already packed with everything that a campaigner could need; indeed, when I read the printed list showing what was in each my heart warmed with the same joy that I felt when I first read _Robinson Crusoe_. Government, who is rigorous and unyielding as a disciplinarian to her soldiers, is a mother to them in her provision for their wants. Each bag contained a knife, fork, spoon, tin canteen, shaving brush, soap, razor, boot brushes, clothes brush, hair brush, pipeclay, button polisher, cleaning paste, and a dozen other things just as interesting and as useful. Out of curiosity I opened a housewife, and my heart was touched with the almost feminine consideration that it indicated; for there, cunningly folded up, were skeins of wool and cotton in many different shades, as well as half a dozen sizes of needles. Surely the War Office is human, and not the strange machine that some of us esteem it, for how else could it provide that Tommy shall not have to darn his socks with scarlet, nor his tunic with grey, nor his trousers with white wool? As the men came into the stores each one received his share of these excellent things, and the quartermaster's sergeants displayed quite a genius in estimating and fitting the various proportions of the men. And the men's eyes brightened at the sight of the glorious new red cloth; I believe that, although they wore it for a few days only, it did much to reconcile them with the inconvenience and hardship that some of them endured in rejoining. Khaki uniforms were served out later.  All round the barrack square the men stood in groups as I have described, and in one corner were clusters of men arrayed in their new garments. One could read pretty easily in their faces the story of the last few days. One saw several men who had evidently risen in the world since they had left the army. They had an air of sleekness and delicacy that made them seem out of place. Others had evidently been going down in the social scale, and wore their new clothes like fine feathers. Some were evidently glad at the prospect of action and excitement, and fell back into the regimental routine as a man sits down in a comfortable chair. To others, not a few, all this hustle was an act in a domestic tragedy. Sometimes it was a comedy, as in the case of one man who had built up a \"nice little butchering business,\" snatching his profits from the niggard hand of competition; and now he must go forth to kill men, leaving his rival master in the field of domestic butchery. But the comedies were few, or else I did not come across them, for it was the serious side of this business that impressed me the most. Men caught away from new-found family joys, not for personal advancement or glory, but to take their places as units in the huge war-machine that is fed with human bodies. It is so easy to speak and think of \"losses\" when we count them by the hundred; it is so hard and bitter to think of one death and all that it means when one stands and speaks to a soldier. I found one man standing apart by himself--a young man, with a good, clean, hardy face--and there were tears in his eyes. As I was passing he asked me what time it was, and in a few minutes he told me his story. He had been married two years; he had one little child; he had left his wife dying of pneumonia. That was all; but I think one can hardly realise how much it meant. I should like some civilians who do their soldiering in an armchair, and who really seem to like a war for the spice with which it flavours their newspaper, to have seen that man and heard his short tale of misery.[1] He is, of course, one of the few on whom an admirable system inflicts a fearful wound; but he is an example (if one were needed) of the matchless discipline that can teach a man to obey without question or complaint a command that has two edges for death. I am glad to say that I met no other man in half so dreadful a plight as his, but there were dozens of men to whom the order came as an ending of happiness, and of course one knew, although the thought was not dwelt upon, that many of the little homes of which these men had been the centre and support would have that support no more. Yet of one thing I am very sure. Not one of the men to whom I spoke but was willing and anxious to serve his country; not one but looked proud to be wearing the old uniform again. The sadness and trouble was all in the retrospect, not in the outlook. Tommy Atkins, with his great, simple, conspicuous vices and his obscure, surprising, and enduring virtues was unconsciously putting into practice the precept of a certain Old Buccaneer: _No regrets; they unman the heart we want for to-morrow._  [Footnote 1: This man's wife died a week after he had sailed.]     II  HOW THE ARMY LEFT ENGLAND   The few days that elapsed between rejoining and embarkation were spent by the Reservist at the depôt barracks of his regiment, where he received his kit and underwent the small amount of drill necessary to remove the rust of civilian life. After that, the sound of reveille in the depth of a winter night; the sudden awakening; the hasty breakfast, eaten like a Passover feast; the long and noisy railway journey; the faint, salt smell of the sea, and the first sight of it through the rainy dawn. In the early days of the war I was present at many embarkations at Liverpool and Southampton, and they left an impression on my mind which will not easily be effaced. For, even to an onlooker, the embarkation of troops, with its sights and sounds of tragedy, is an affair that burns itself into the memory; one is dazzled and confounded by the number and variety of the small dramas that are enacted before one's eyes; and the whole is framed in a setting of military system and circumstance that lends dignity, if that were needed, to the humble tragedies of the moment.  Only a few of the thousands who came to watch the departure of the _Canada_ from Liverpool one December morning were allowed inside the dock shed; nearly all of those within the gate were sweethearts and wives and children of soldiers who had contrived to procure passes for them. Even in the shed the scene was one of extraordinary confusion. At intervals of about half an hour detachments were marched in and formed up at one end of the shed, where they left their bundles and heavy kit, and whence they were marched in single file up the gangway of the ship. With the exception of the Manchesters, all the troops were in khaki, and were easily distinguishable from the dark-coloured mass of civilians. Thus there was always a yellow pool of colour in the midst of the black mass, and all the morning a thin yellow line flowed from the pool to the ship's gangway. As often as one looked, during the whole morning, there was a line of men in the act of ascending the gangway. One felt as though one had fallen asleep for a moment and dreamed, and waked again to find the same men in the same position, so little did the appearance of things change. It was really a picture that one looked at, for the colours and bold outlines remained constant; the eye at times grew used to the minute movement, and refused to notice that the picture was preserved only because the same things were being done over and over again by hundreds of different people. The same greetings as friends recognised the newly-arrived man, the same hurried words, the same faltering voices, the same desperate embraces, the same endless tramp from the formed ranks to the ship, the same tears. The absorption of so many acute personal emotions into one revolving routine was the most amazing part of it; the stream of discipline and system ran swift and deep here, drawing into its flood even the most sacred and intimate of human experiences, and turning into a pattern the parting of husband from wife and father from child. When at length one became used to the picture one began to notice the elements of its composition, and only in watching them could one gain relief from the overburdening sense of personality submerged in a system. The little dramas were very strange and very affecting. I can only give a few examples out of dozens that I watched.  As the troops came in at the door, marching four deep, the crowd formed on each side, and those who had friends in the detachment tried to get a prominent place in the front rank of the crowd, where they could attract the attention of the soldiers as they passed. The men were not hurried, and they were marching at ease, so there was generally time for a few words and a kiss or a hand-clasp before they were moved on. One wife, who was little more than a girl, had taken a good place on the edge of the crowd when her husband's detachment began to file in. I heard her telling a friend that she had not said good-bye to \"her lad,\" as she wanted to see the last of him; it had been arranged that she was to be near when he passed so that he could give her a parting kiss. Oh, how anxiously she scanned the faces of the men as they swung into sight, throwing all her soul into her eyes!  Presently, \"There he is!\" she cried; \"here, Jim, I'm here!\"  The young man's fine honest face had a look no less intent than hers, but it was turned away from her; he was searching as eagerly as she, but on the wrong side of the lane of people; and by one of those impish tricks that Fate plays upon us in acute moments, he never saw her, nor heard her voice above the cheers of the people and the blare of the band. It was a cruel thing; she was fast wedged in the crowd. Someone ran after the man and told him where she was, but before the sympathiser could reach him his company had been drawn up and he could not be allowed to fall out. And long before she was clear of the tightly packed throng he had passed on to the ship, where she could not follow him.  Another"]]]
