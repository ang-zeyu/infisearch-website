LATHAM. Does this mean that the mental disturbances arise from some form of electromagnetic radiation?  NIEMAND. We doubt it. As I said before, the charts show a lag of about forty-eight hours between the development of an S-Region and the onset of mental disturbance. This indicates that the malignant energy emanating from an S-Region consists of some highly penetrating form of corpuscular radiation, as yet unidentified.[A]  [Footnote A: Middletown believes that the Intense radiation recently discovered from information derived from Explorer I and III has no connection with the corpuscular S-radiation.]  LATHAM. A question that puzzles me is why some people are affected by the S-Regions while others are not.  NIEMAND. Our latest results indicate that probably _no one_ is completely immune. All are affected in _some_ degree. Just why some should be affected so much more than others is still a matter of speculation.  LATHAM. How long does an S-Region last?  NIEMAND. An S-Region may have a lifetime of from three to perhaps a dozen solar rotations. Then it dies out and for a time we are free from this malignant radiation. Then a new region develops in perhaps an entirely different region of the Sun. Sometimes there may be several different S-Regions all going at once.  LATHAM. Why were not the S-Regions discovered long ago?  NIEMAND. Because the radio exploration of the Sun only began since the end of World War II.  LATHAM. How does it happen that you only got patients suffering from S-radiation since about 1955?  NIEMAND. I think we did get such patients previously but not in large enough numbers to attract attention. Also the present sunspot cycle started its rise to maximum about 1954.  LATHAM. Is there no way of escaping the S-radiation?  NIEMAND. I'm afraid the only sure way is to keep on the unilluminated side of the Earth which is rather difficult to do. Apparently the corpuscular beam from an S-Region is several degrees wide and not very sharply defined, since its effects are felt simultaneously over the entire continent. Hillyard and Middletown are working on some form of shielding device but so far without success.  LATHAM. What is the present state of S-Region activity?  NIEMAND. At the present moment there happens to be no S-Region activity on the Sun. But a new one may develop at any time. Also, the outlook for a decrease in activity is not very favorable. Sunspot activity continues at a high level and is steadily mounting in violence. The last sunspot cycle had the highest maximum of any since 1780, but the present cycle bids fair to set an all time record.  LATHAM. And so you believe that the S-Regions are the cause of most of the present trouble in the world. That it is not ourselves but something outside ourselves--  NIEMAND. That is the logical outcome of our investigation. We are controlled and swayed by forces which in many cases we are powerless to resist.  LATHAM. Could we not be warned of the presence of an S-Region?  NIEMAND. The trouble is they seem to develop at random on the Sun. I'm afraid any warning system would be worse than useless. We would be crying WOLF! all the time.  LATHAM. How may a person who is not particularly susceptible to this malignant radiation know that one of these regions is active?  NIEMAND. If you have a feeling of restlessness and anxiety, if you are unable to concentrate, if you feel suddenly depressed and discouraged about yourself, or are filled with resentment toward the world, then you may be pretty sure that an S-Region is passing across the face of the Sun. Keep a tight rein on yourself. For it seems that evil will always be with us ... as long as the Sun shall continue to shine upon this little world."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24152"],["title","The Guardians (#1)"],["body","into the side walls. Mryna heard footsteps moving toward her down one of the corridors; she pulled herself blindly into another. As she went farther from the circular room, a vague sense of gravity returned. At the end of the corridor she was able to stand on her feet again, although she still had to walk very carefully. Any sudden movement sent her soaring in a graceful leap that banged her head against the ceiling.   Cautiously she opened a thick, metal door into another hall--and she stood transfixed, looking through a mica wall at the emptiness of space pinpointed with its billions of stars. This was the reality of the charts she had seen in the astronomy text: that knowledge alone saved her sanity. She had believed it when the proof lay hidden above the rain mist; she must believe it now.  From where she stood, she was able to see the place where the god-car had brought her--like a vast cartwheel spinning in the void. The god-car was clamped against the hub, from which eight corridors radiated outward like wheel spokes toward the rim. Far below the gigantic wheel Mryna saw the sphere of Rythar, invisible behind its shroud of glowing mist.  She moved along the rim corridor, past the mica wall, until she came to a door that stood open. The room beyond was a sleeping compartment and it was empty. She searched it for clothing, and found nothing. She went through four more dormitory rooms before she came upon anything she could use--brief shorts, clearly made for a man, and a loose, white tunic. It wasn't suitable; it wasn't the way she wanted to be dressed when she faced him. But it had to do.  Mryna was pawing through a footlocker looking for boots when she heard a hesitant step behind her. She whirled and saw a small, stooped, white-haired man, naked except for trunks like the ones she was wearing. The wrinkled skin on his wasted chest was burned brown by the hot glare of the sun. Thick-lensed glasses hung from a chain around his neck.  \"My dear young lady,\" he said in a tired voice, \"this is a men's ward!\"  \"I'm sorry. I didn't know--\"  \"You must be a new patient.\" He fumbled for his glasses. Instinctively she knew she shouldn't let him see her clearly enough to identify her as a stranger. She shoved past him, knocking the glasses from his hand.  \"I'd better find my own--ward.\" Mryna didn't know the word, but she supposed it meant some sort of sleeping chamber.  The old man said chattily, \"I hadn't heard they were bringing in any new patients today.\"  She was in the corridor by that time. He reached for her hand. \"I'll see you in the sunroom?\" It was a timid, hopeful question. \"And you'll tell me all the news--everything they're doing back on Earth. I haven't been home for almost a year.\"  She fled down the hall. When she heard voices ahead of her, she pulled back a door and slid into another room--a storeroom piled with cases of medicines. Behind the cartons she thought she would be safe.  This wasn't what she had expected. Mryna thought there might be one man living in a kind of prefab somehow suspended above the rain mist. But there were obviously others up here; she didn't know how many. And the old man frightened her--more than the dazzling sight of the heavens visible through the mica wall. Mryna had never seen physical age before. No one on Rythar was older than she was herself--a sturdy, healthy, lusty twenty. The old man's infirmity disgusted her; for the first time in her life she was conscious of the slow decay of death.   The door of the supply room slid open. Mryna crouched low behind the cartons, but she was able to see the man and the woman who had entered the room. A woman--here? Mryna hadn't considered that possibility. Perhaps the Earth-god already had a mate.  The newcomers were dressed in crisp, white uniforms; the woman wore a starched, white hat. They carried a tray of small, glass cylinders from which metal needles projected. While the woman held the tray, the man drove the needles through the caps of small bottles and filled the cylinders with a bright-colored liquid.  \"When are you leaving, Dick?\" the woman asked.  \"In about forty minutes. They're sending an auto-pickup.\"  \"Oh, no!\"  \"Now don't start worrying. They have got the bugs out of it by this time. The auto-pickups are entirely trustworthy.\"  \"Sure, that's what the army says.\"  \"In theory they should be even more reliable than--\"  \"I wish you'd wait for the hospital shuttle.\"  \"And miss the chance to address Congress this year? We've worked too long for this; I don't want to muff it now. We've all the statistical proof we need, even to convince those pinchpenny halfwits. During the past eight years we've handled more than a thousand cases up here. On Earth they were pronounced incurable; we've sent better than eighty per cent back in good health after an average stay of fourteen months.\"  \"No medical man has ever questioned the efficiency of cosmic radiation and a reduced atmospheric gravity, Dick.\"  \"It's just our so-called statesmen, always yapping about the budget. But this time we have the cost problem licked, too. For a year and a half the ore they send up from Rythar has paid for our entire operation.\"  \"I didn't know that.\"  \"We've kept it under wraps, so the politicians wouldn't cut our appropriations.\"  Their glass tubes were full, and they turned toward the door. \"It isn't right,\" the woman persisted, \"for them not to send a piloted shuttle after you, Dick. It isn't dignified. You're our assistant medical director and--\"  Her words were cut off as the door slid shut behind them. Mryna tried to fit this new information into what she already knew--or thought she knew--about the Earth-god. It didn't add up to a pretty picture. She had once asked for a definition of illness, and it was apparent to her that this place which they called the Guardian Wheel was an expensive hospital for Earthmen. It was paid for by the sacrificial ores mined on Rythar. In a sense, Rythar was being enslaved and exploited by Earth. True, it was not difficult to dig out the ore, but Mryna resented the fact that the kids on Rythar had not been told the truth. She had long ago lost her awe of the man called god; now she lost her respect as well.  Mryna was glad she had not seen him, glad no one knew she was aboard the Guardian Wheel. She would return to Rythar. After she told the others what she knew, Rythar would send up no more sacrifice ores. Let the Earthmen come down and mine it for themselves!   Very cautiously she pulled the door open. The rim corridor was empty. She moved toward one of the intersecting corridors. When she heard footsteps, she hid in another dormitory room.  This was different from the others. It showed more evidence of permanent occupation. She guessed it was a dormitory for the people who took care of the sick. Pictures were fastened to the curved, metal walls. Personal articles cluttered the shelves hung beside the bunks. On a writing desk she saw a number of typed reports. Five freshly laundered uniforms, identical to the one she had lost in the antiseptic wash, hung on a rack behind the door. Mryna stripped off the makeshift she was wearing and put on one of the uniforms; she found boots under the desk. When she was dressed, she stood admiring herself in the polished surface of the metal door.  She was a handsome woman, and she was very conscious of that. Her face was tanned by the mist-filtered sunlight of Rythar; her lips were red and sensuous; her long, platinum-colored hair fell to her shoulders. She compared herself to the small, hard-faced female she had seen in the supply room. Was that a typical Earthwoman? Mryna's lips curled in a scornful smile. Let the gods come down to Rythar, then, and discover what a real female was like in the lush, green, Rytharian paradise.  Mryna went to the desk and glanced at the typed reports. They had been written by a man who signed himself \"Commander in Charge, Guardian Wheel,\" and they were addressed to the Congress of the world government. One typed document was a supply inventory; a second, still unfinished, was a budget report. (_You won't show a profit next time_, Mryna thought vindictively, _when we stop sending you the sacrifice ore_.) Another report dealt with Rythar, and Mryna read it with more interest.  One paragraph caught her attention,  \"We have asked for soil samples to be taken from an area covering ten thousand square miles. Our chemical analysis has been thorough, and we find nothing that could be remotely harmful to human life. Atmospheric samples produce the same negative results. On the other hand, we have direct evidence that no animal life has ever evolved on Rythar; the life cycle is exclusively botanical.\"  The soil samples, Mryna realized, would be the vials of Earth which the Earth-god had requested so often. Were the Earthmen planning to move their hospital down to Rythar? That idea disturbed her. Mryna did not want her garden world cluttered up with a lot of sick, old men discarded by Earth.  She turned to the second page of the report. \"The original colony survived for a year. The Sickness in the Old Village developed only after the first harvest of Rytharian-grown food. It is more and more evident that the botanical cycle of Rythar must be examined before we find the answer. To do that adequately, we shall have to send survey teams to the surface; that requires much larger appropriations for research than we have had in the past. The metal immunization suits, which must, of course, be destroyed after each expedition--\"  \"And what, may I ask, is the meaning of this?\"   Mryna dropped the report and swung toward the door. She saw a woman standing there--another hard-faced Earthwoman, with a starched, white cap perched on her graying hair.  \"I must have come to the wrong room,\" Mryna said in a small voice.  \"Indeed! Everyone knows this is command headquarters. Who are you?\" The woman put her hand on Mryna's arm, and the fingers bit through the "]]]
