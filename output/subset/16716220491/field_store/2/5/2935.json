It was from Earth, of course, since no printing was being done yet on Meloa. It must have come in on one of the three big Earth freighters he'd heard land during the night. Tucked into it was another of the brief notes he'd been receiving: \"Director Flannery will be pleased to call on Captain O'Neill at the captain's convenience.\"  He shredded the note as he went across the field; he started to do the same with the news magazine, until the headlines caught his attention.  Most of the news meant nothing to him. But he skimmed the article on the eleventh planet to join the Outer Federation; the writer was obviously biased against the organization, but Duke nodded approvingly. At least someone was doing something. He saw that Cathay was in for trouble. Earth was living up to her old form! Then he shoved the magazine into his pocket and trudged on toward the veteran's reassignment headquarters.  Machinery was being moved from the Earth freighters, and Duke swore again. Five billion Earthmen would read of their \"generosity\" to Meloa, and any guilt they felt for their desertion would vanish in a smug satisfaction at their charity. Smugness was easy in a world without dust or carrion smell or craters that had been factories.  There were only a few Meloans in the crude tent that served as their headquarters. Duke went back toward the cubbyhole where a thin, haggard man sat on a broken block behind a makeshift desk.  The hairless blue head shook slowly while the man's eyes dropped hungrily to the paper in Duke's pocket and away again guiltily. \"No work, Captain O'Neill. Unless you can operate some of those Earth machines we're getting?\"  Duke grimaced, passing the magazine over to hands that trembled as they took it. His education was in ultra-literary creative writing, his experience in war. And here, where there was the whole task of rebuilding a planet to be done, the ruin of tools and power made what could be done too little for even the few who were left. There was no grain to reap or wood to cut after the killing gas from Throm had ruined vegetation; there were no workable mines where all had been blasted closed. Transportation was gone. And the economy had passed beyond hand tools, leaving too few of those. Even whole men were idle, and his artificial hand could never replace a real one for carrying rubble.  \"Director Flannery has been asking for you again,\" the man told him.  Duke ignored it. \"What about my wife?\"  The Meloan frowned, reaching for a soiled scrap of paper. \"We may have something. One of her former friends thinks she was near this address. We'll send someone out to investigate, if you wish, captain; but it's still pretty uncertain.\"  \"I'll go myself,\" Duke said harshly. He picked up the paper, recognizing the location as one that had been in the outskirts.  The man behind the desk shook his head doubtfully. Then he shrugged, and reached behind him for a small automatic. \"Better take this--and watch your step! There are two bullets left.\"  Duke nodded his thanks and turned away, dropping the gun into his pocket. Behind him he heard a long sigh and the rustle of a magazine being opened quickly.                      *      *      *      *      *  It was a long walk. At first, he traced his way through streets that had been partially blasted clear. After the first mile, however, he was forced to hunt around or over the litter and wreckage, picking the way from high spot to high spot. There were people about, rooting through the debris, or patrolling in groups. He drew the automatic and carried it in his hand, in plain sight. Some stared at him and some ignored him, but none came too close.  Once he heard shouting and a group ran across his path, chasing a small rodent. He heard a wild tumult begin, minutes later. When he passed the spot where they had stopped, a fight was going on, apparently over the kill.  At noon he stopped to drink sparingly of his water and eat one of the incredibly bad biscuits. What food there was available or which could be received from the Earth freighters was being mixed into them, but it wasn't enough. The workers got a little more, and occasionally someone found a few cans under the rubble. The penalty for not turning such food in was revocation of all food allotment, but there was a small black market where unidentified cans could be bought for five Earth dollars, and some found its way there. The same black market sold the few remaining cigarettes at twice that amount each.  It was beginning to thunder to the north as he stood up and went wearily on, and the haze was thickening. He tried to hurry, uncertain of how dark it would get. If he got caught now, he'd never be able to return before night. He stumbled on a broken street sign, decoding what was left of it, and considered. Then he sighed in relief. As he remembered it, he was almost there.  The buildings had been lower here, and the rubble was thinner. There seemed to be more people about, judging by the traces of smoke that drifted out of holes or through glassless windows. He saw none outside, however.  He was considering trying one of the places from which smoke was coming when he saw the little boy five hundred feet ahead. He started forward, but the kid popped into what must have been a cellar once. Duke stopped, calling quietly.  This time it was a girl of about sixteen who appeared. She sidled closer, her eyes fixed on his hair. Her voice piped out suddenly, scared and desperate. \"You lonesome, Earthman?\" Under the fright, it was a grotesque attempt at coquetry. She edged nearer, staring at him. \"I won't roll you, honest!\"  \"All I want is information,\" he told her thickly. \"I'm looking for a woman named Ronda--Ronda O'Neill. She was my wife.\"  The girl considered, shaking her head. Her eyes grew wider as he pulled out a green Earth bill, but she didn't move. Then, as he added the two remaining biscuits, she nodded quickly, motioning him forward. \"Mom might know,\" she said.  She ran ahead, and soon an older woman shuffled up the broken steps. In her arms was a baby, dead or in a coma, and she rocked it slowly, moaning softly as she listened to his questions. She grunted finally, and reached out for the reward. Shuffling ahead of him, she went up the rubble-littered street and around a corner, to point. \"Go in,\" she said. \"Ronda'll be back.\"  Duke shoved the crude door back and stepped into what was left of a foyer in a cheap apartment house. The back had been blasted away, but the falling building had sealed over one corner, covering it from most of the weather. Light came from the shattered window, showing a scrap of blanket laid out on the floor near a few possessions. At first, nothing identified the resident in any way, and he wondered if it were a trap. Then he bent over a broken bracelet, and his breath caught sharply. The catch still worked, and a faded miniature of him was inside the little holder. Ronda's!  Duke dropped onto the blanket, trying to imagine what Ronda would be like, and to picture the reunion. But the present circumstances wouldn't fit into anything he could imagine. He could only remember the bravely smiling girl who had seen him off five years before.  He heard a babble of voices outside, but he didn't look out. The walk had exhausted him. Hard as the bed was, it was better than standing up. Anyhow, if Ronda came back, he was pretty sure she would be warned of his presence.  He slept fitfully, awakened by the smells and sounds from outside. Once he thought someone looked in, but he couldn't be sure. He turned over, almost decided to investigate, and dozed off again.  It was the hoarse sound of breathing and a soft shuffle that wakened him that time. His senses jarred out of slumber with a feeling of wrongness that reacted in instant caution. He let his eyes slit open, relieved to find there was still light.  Between him and the door, a figure was creeping up on hands and knees. The rags of clothes indicated it was a woman and the knife in one hand spelled murder!  Duke snapped himself upright to a sitting position, his hand darting for the gun in his pocket. A low shriek came from the woman, and she lunged forward, the knife rising. There was no time for the gun. He caught her wrist, twisting savagely. She scratched and writhed, but the knife spun from her grasp. With a moan, she collapsed across his knees.  He turned her face up, staring at it unbelievingly. \"Ronda!\"  Bloated and stained, lined with fear, it still bore a faint resemblance to the girl he had known. Now a fleeting look of cunning crossed her face briefly, to be replaced with an attempt at dawning recognition. \"Duke!\" She gasped it, then made a sound that might have been meant for joy. She stumbled to her knees, reaching out to him. But her eyes swiveled briefly toward the knife. \"Duke, it's you!\"  He pushed her back and reached for the knife. He was sure she'd known who it was--had probably been the one who awakened him by looking in through the broken window. \"Why'd you try to kill me, Ronda? You saw who it was. If you needed money, you know I'd give you anything I had. Why?\"  \"Not for money.\" She twisted from him and slumped limply against a broken wall. Tears came into her eyes. This time the catch in her voice was real. \"I know ... I know, Duke. And I wanted to see you, to talk to you, too.\" She shook her head slowly. \"What can I do with money? I wanted to wake you up like old times. But Mrs. Kalaufa--she led you here--she said--\"  He waited, but she didn't finish. She traced a pattern on the dust of the floor, before looking up again. \"You've never been really hungry! Not that hungry! You wouldn't understand.\"  \"Even with the dole, you can't starve that much in the time since Kordule was bombed,\" he protested. He gagged as he thought of the meaning he'd guessed from her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24197"],["title","The Tinted Venus: A Farcical Romance (#1)"],["body","just then to see Matilda, and--and I haven't been near the Parkinsons ever since. So you can see for yourself that a meeting might be awkward for all parties concerned; and I really must get out, James!\"  Jauncy forced him back. \"It's all nonsense, Tweddle,\" he said, \"you can't back out of it now! Don't make a fuss about nothing. Ada don't look as if she'd been breaking her heart for you!\"  \"You never can tell with women,\" said the hairdresser, sententiously; \"and meeting me sudden, and learning it could never be--no one can say how she mightn't take it!\"  \"I call it too bad!\" exclaimed Jauncy. \"Here have I been counting on you to make the ladies enjoy themselves--for I haven't your gift of entertaining conversation, and don't pretend to it--and you go and leave me in the lurch, and spoil their evening for them!\"  \"If I thought I was doing that----\" said Leander, hesitating.  \"You are, you know you are!\" persisted Jauncy, who was naturally anxious to avoid the reduction of his party to so inconvenient a number as three.  \"And see here, Tweddle, you needn't say anything of your engagement unless you like. I give you my word I won't, not even to Bella, if you'll only come! As to Ada, she can take care of herself, unless I'm very much mistaken in her. So come along, like a good chap!\"  \"I give in, James; I give in,\" said Leander. \"A promise is a promise, and yet I feel somehow I'm doing wrong to go, and as if no good would come of it. I do indeed!\"  And so he did not stop the cab a second time, and allowed himself to be taken without further protest to Fenchurch Street Station, on the platform of which they found the Misses Parkinson waiting for them.  Miss Bella Parkinson, the elder of the two, who was employed in a large toy and fancy goods establishment in the neighbourhood of Westbourne Grove, was tall and slim, with pale eyes and auburn hair. She had some claims to good looks, in spite of a slightly pasty complexion, and a large and decidedly unamiable mouth.  Her sister Ada was the more pleasing in appearance and manner, a brunette with large brown eyes, an impertinent little nose, and a brilliant healthy colour. She was an assistant to a milliner and bonnet-maker in the Edgware Road.  Both these young ladies, when in the fulfilment of their daily duties, were models of deportment; in their hours of ease, the elder's cold dignity was rather apt to turn to peevishness, while the younger sister, relieved from the restraints of the showroom, betrayed a lively and even frivolous disposition.  It was this liveliness and frivolity that had fascinated the hairdresser in days that had gone by; but if he had felt any self-distrust now in venturing within their influence, such apprehensions vanished with the first sight of the charms which had been counteracted before they had time to prevail.  She was well enough, this Miss Ada Parkinson, he thought now; a nice-looking girl in her way, and stylishly dressed. But his Matilda looked twice the lady she ever could, and a vision of his betrothed (at that time taking a week's rest in the country) rose before him, as if to justify and confirm his preference.  The luckless James had to undergo some amount of scolding from Miss Bella for his want of punctuality, a scolding which merely supplied an object to his grin; and during her remarks, Ada had ample time to rally Leander Tweddle upon his long neglect, and used it to the best advantage.  Perhaps he would have been better pleased by a little less insensibility, a touch of surprise and pleasure on her part at meeting him again, as he allowed himself to show in a remark that his absence did not seem to have affected her to any great extent.  \"I don't know what you expected, Mr. Tweddle,\" she replied. \"Ought I to have cried both my eyes out? You haven't cried out either of yours, you know!\"  \"'Men must work, and women must weep,' as Shakspeare says,\" he observed, with a vague idea that he was making rather an apt quotation. But his companion pointed out that this only applied to cases where the women had something to weep about.  The party had a compartment to themselves, and Leander, who sat at one end opposite to Ada, found his spirits rising under the influence of her lively sallies.  \"That's the only thing Matilda wants,\" he thought, \"a little more liveliness and go about her. I like a little chaff myself, now and then, I must say.\"  At the other end of the carriage, Bella had been suggesting that the gardens might be closed so late in the year, and regretting that they had not chosen the new melodrama at the Adelphi instead; which caused Jauncy to draw glowing pictures of the attractions of Rosherwich Gardens.  \"I was there a year ago last summer,\" he said, \"and it was first-rate: open-air dancing, summer theatre, rope-walking, fireworks, and supper out under the trees. You'll enjoy yourself, Bella, right enough when you get there!\"  \"If that isn't enough for you, Bella,\" cried her sister, \"you must be difficult to please! I'm sure I'm quite looking forward to it; aren't you, Mr. Tweddle?\"  The poor man was cursed by the fatal desire of pleasing, and unconsciously threw an altogether unnecessary degree of _empressement_ into his voice as he replied, \"In the company I am at present, I should look forward to it, if it was a wilderness with a funeral in it.\"  \"Oh dear me, Mr. Tweddle, that _is_ a pretty speech!\" said Ada, and she blushed in a manner which appalled the conscience-stricken hairdresser.  \"There I go again,\" he thought remorsefully, \"putting things in the poor girl's head--it ain't right. I'm making myself too pleasant!\"  And then it struck him that it would be only prudent to make his position clearly understood, and, carefully lowering his voice, he began a speech with that excellent intention. \"Miss Parkinson,\" he said huskily, \"there's something I have to tell you about myself, very particular. Since I last enjoyed the pleasure of meeting with you my prospects have greatly altered, I am no longer----\"  But she cut him short with a little gesture of entreaty. \"Oh, not here, please, Mr. Tweddle,\" she said; \"tell me about it in the gardens!\"  \"Very well,\" he said, relieved; \"remind me when we get there--in case I forget, you know.\"  \"Remind you!\" cried Ada; \"the _idea_, Mr. Tweddle! I certainly shan't do any such thing.\"  \"She thinks I am going to propose to her!\" he thought ruefully; \"it will be a delicate business undeceiving her. I wish it was over and done with!\"  It was quite dark by the time they had crossed the river by the ferry, and made their way up to the entrance to the pleasure gardens, imposing enough, with its white colonnade, its sphinxes, and lines of coloured lamps.  But no one else had crossed with them; and, as they stood at the turnstiles, all they could see of the grounds beyond seemed so dark and silent that they began to have involuntary misgivings. \"I suppose,\" said Jauncy to the man at the ticket-hole, \"the gardens are open--eh?\"  \"Oh yes,\" he said gruffly, \"_they're_ open--they're _open_; though there ain't much going on out-of-doors, being the last night of the season.\"  Bella again wished that they had selected the Adelphi for their evening's pleasure, and remarked that Jauncy \"might have known.\"  \"Well,\" said the latter to the party generally, \"what do you say--shall we go in, or get back by the first train home?\"  \"Don't be so ridiculous, James!\" said Bella, peevishly. \"What's the good of going back, to be too late for everything. The mischief's done now.\"  \"Oh, let's go in!\" advised Ada; \"the amusements and things will be just as nice indoors--nicer on a chilly evening like this;\" and Leander seconded her heartily.  So they went in; Jauncy leading the way with the still complaining Bella, and Leander Tweddle bringing up the rear with Ada. They picked their way as well as they could in the darkness, caused by the closely planted trees and shrubs, down a winding path, where the sopped leaves gave a slippery foothold, and the branches flicked moisture insultingly in their faces as they pushed them aside.  A dead silence reigned everywhere, broken only by the wind as it rustled amongst the bare twigs, or the whistling of a flaring gas-torch protruding from some convenient tree.  Jauncy occasionally shouted back some desperate essay at jocularity, at which Ada laughed with some perseverance, until even she could no longer resist the influence of the surroundings.  On a hot summer's evening those grounds, brilliantly illuminated and crowded by holiday-makers, have been the delight of thousands of honest Londoners, and will be so again; but it was undeniable that on this particular occasion they were pervaded by a decent melancholy.  Ada had slipped a hand, clad in crimson silk, through Leander's arm as they groped through the gloom together, and shrank to his side now and then in an alarm which was only half pretended. But if her light pressure upon his arm made his heart beat at all the faster, it was only at the fancy that the trusting hand was his Matilda's, or so at least did he account for it to himself afterwards.  They followed on, down a broad promenade, where the ground glistened with autumn damps, and the unlighted lamps looked wan and spectral. There was a bear-pit hard by, over the railings of which Ada leaned and shouted a defiant \"Boo;\" but the bears had turned in for the night, and the stone re-echoed her voice with a hollow ring. Indistinct bird forms were roosting in cages; but her umbrella had no effect upon them.  Jauncy was waiting for them to come up, perhaps as a protection against his _fiancée's_ reproaches. \"In another hour,\" he said, with an implied apology, \"you'll see how different this place looks. We--we're come a little too early. Suppose we fill up the time by a nice little dinner at the Restorong--eh, Ada? What do you think, Tweddle?\"  The suggestion was received favourably, and Jauncy, thankful to retrieve his reputation as leader, took them"]]]
