But \"nous avons changé tout cela,\" and are reaping the advantages of the change. The writer is far from conceiving that any thing he can adduce by personal precept or example can at all approach his regular, or even irregular predecessors: he is merely giving a reason why he preferred the more regular formation of a structure, however feeble, to an entire abandonment of all rules whatsoever. Where he has failed, the failure is in the architect,--and not in the art.  In this tragedy it has been my intention to follow the account of Diodorus Siculus;[4] reducing it, however, to such dramatic regularity as I best could, and trying to approach the unities. I therefore suppose the rebellion to explode and succeed in one day by a sudden conspiracy, instead of the long war of the history.

SARDANAPALUS.[5]                                     ACT I.                       SCENE I.--_A Hall in the Palace_.       _Salemenes_ (_solus_).     He hath wronged his queen, but still he is her lord;     He hath wronged my sister--still he is my brother;     He hath wronged his people--still he is their sovereign--     And I must be his friend as well as subject:     He must not perish thus. I will not see     The blood of Nimrod and Semiramis     Sink in the earth, and thirteen hundred years     Of Empire ending like a shepherd's tale;     He must be roused. In his effeminate heart     There is a careless courage which Corruption                        10     Has not all quenched, and latent energies,     Repressed by circumstance, but not destroyed--     Steeped, but not drowned, in deep voluptuousness.     If born a peasant, he had been a man     To have reached an empire: to an empire born,     He will bequeath none; nothing but a name,     Which his sons will not prize in heritage:--     Yet--not all lost--even yet--he may redeem     His sloth and shame, by only being that     Which he should be, as easily as the thing                          20     He should not be and is. Were it less toil     To sway his nations than consume his life?     To head an army than to rule a harem?     He sweats in palling pleasures, dulls his soul,[a]     And saps his goodly strength, in toils which yield not     Health like the chase, nor glory like the war--     He must be roused. Alas! there is no sound                                  [_Sound of soft music heard from within_.     To rouse him short of thunder. Hark! the lute--     The lyre--the timbrel; the lascivious tinklings     Of lulling instruments, the softening voices                        30     Of women, and of beings less than women,     Must chime in to the echo of his revel,     While the great King of all we know of earth     Lolls crowned with roses, and his diadem     Lies negligently by to be caught up     By the first manly hand which dares to snatch it.     Lo, where they come! already I perceive     The reeking odours of the perfumed trains,     And see the bright gems of the glittering girls,[b]     At once his Chorus and his Council, flash                           40     Along the gallery, and amidst the damsels,     As femininely garbed, and scarce less female,     The grandson of Semiramis, the Man-Queen.--     He comes! Shall I await him? yes, and front him,     And tell him what all good men tell each other,     Speaking of him and his. They come, the slaves     Led by the monarch subject to his slaves.                                   SCENE II.             _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _effeminately dressed, his Head          crowned with Flowers, and his Robe negligently flowing,              attended by a Train of Women and young Slaves_.      _Sar._ (_speaking to some of his attendants_).     Let the pavilion[6] over the Euphrates     Be garlanded, and lit, and furnished forth     For an especial banquet; at the hour     Of midnight we will sup there: see nought wanting,     And bid the galley be prepared. There is     A cooling breeze which crisps the broad clear river:     We will embark anon. Fair Nymphs, who deign     To share the soft hours of Sardanapalus,     We'll meet again in that the sweetest hour,     When we shall gather like the stars above us,                       10     And you will form a heaven as bright as theirs;     Till then, let each be mistress of her time,     And thou, my own Ionian Myrrha,[7] choose;     Wilt thou along with them or me?      _Myr._                          My Lord--      _Sar._ My Lord!--my Life! why answerest thou so coldly?     It is the curse of kings to be so answered.     Rule thy own hours, thou rulest mine--say, wouldst thou     Accompany our guests, or charm away     The moments from me?      _Myr._              The King's choice is mine.      _Sar._ I pray thee say not so: my chiefest joy                      20     Is to contribute to thine every wish.     I do not dare to breathe my own desire,     Lest it should clash with thine; for thou art still     Too prompt to sacrifice thy thoughts for others.      _Myr._ I would remain: I have no happiness     Save in beholding thine; yet--      _Sar._                         Yet! what YET?     Thy own sweet will shall be the only barrier     Which ever rises betwixt thee and me.      _Myr._ I think the present is the wonted hour     Of council; it were better I retire.                                30      _Sal._ (_comes forward and says_)     The Ionian slave says well: let her retire.      _Sar._ Who answers? How now, brother?      _Sal._                               The _Queen's_ brother,     And your most faithful vassal, royal Lord.      _Sar._ (_addressing his train_).     As I have said, let all dispose their hours     Till midnight, when again we pray your presence.                                                     [_The court retiring_.

I thought _thou_ wouldst remain.      _Myr._                                  Great King,     Thou didst not say so.      _Sar._                 But _thou_ looked'st it:     I know each glance of those Ionic eyes,[d]     Which said thou wouldst not leave me.      _Myr._                               Sire! your brother----      _Sal._ His _Consort's_ brother, minion of Ionia!                    40     How darest _thou_ name _me_ and not blush?      _Sar._                                    Not blush!     Thou hast no more eyes than heart to make her crimson     Like to the dying day on Caucasus,     Where sunset tints the snow with rosy shadows,     And then reproach her with thine own cold blindness,     Which will not see it. What! in tears, my Myrrha?      _Sal._ Let them flow on; she weeps for more than one,     And is herself the cause of bitterer tears.      _Sar._ Curséd be he who caused those tears to flow!      _Sal._ Curse not thyself--millions do that already.                 50      _Sar._ Thou dost forget thee: make me not remember     I am a monarch.      _Sal._          Would thou couldst!      _Myr._                               My sovereign,     I pray, and thou, too, Prince, permit my absence.      _Sar._ Since it must be so, and this churl has checked     Thy gentle spirit, go; but recollect     That we must forthwith meet: I had rather lose     An empire than thy presence.

I can at least command myself, who listen     To language such as this: yet urge me not                           60     Beyond my easy nature.      _Sal._                 'Tis beyond     That easy--far too easy--idle nature,     Which I would urge thee.

Think'st thou there is no tyranny but that     Of blood and chains?

Only a week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand.\"  \"Did he give a name?\" I asked.  \"None; but he was an Englishman, though of an unusual type.\"  \"A savage?\" said I, linking my facts after the fashion of my illustrious friend.  \"Exactly.  That describes him very well. He is a bulky, bearded, sunburned fellow, who looks as if he would be more at home in a farmers' inn than in a fashionable hotel.  A hard, fierce man, I should think, and one whom I should be sorry to offend.\"  Already the mystery began to define itself, as figures grow clearer with the lifting of a fog.  Here was this good and pious lady pursued from place to place by a sinister and unrelenting figure.  She feared him, or she would not have fled from Lausanne.  He had still followed. Sooner or later he would overtake her.  Had he already overtaken her? Was THAT the secret of her continued silence?  Could the good people who were her companions not screen her from his violence or his blackmail? What horrible purpose, what deep design, lay behind this long pursuit?  There was the problem which I had to solve.  To Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and surely I had got down to the roots of the matter.  In reply I had a telegram asking for a description of Dr. Shlessinger's left ear.  Holmes's ideas of humour are strange and occasionally offensive, so I took no notice of his ill-timed jest--indeed, I had already reached Montpellier in my pursuit of the maid, Marie, before his message came.  I had no difficulty in finding the ex-servant and in learning all that she could tell me.  She was a devoted creature, who had only left her mistress because she was sure that she was in good hands, and because her own approaching marriage made a separation inevitable in any case. Her mistress had, as she confessed with distress, shown some irritability of temper towards her during their stay in Baden, and had even questioned her once as if she had suspicions of her honesty, and this had made the parting easier than it would otherwise have been. Lady Frances had given her fifty pounds as a wedding-present.  Like me, Marie viewed with deep distrust the stranger who had driven her mistress from Lausanne.  With her own eyes she had seen him seize the lady's wrist with great violence on the public promenade by the lake. He was a fierce and terrible man.  She believed that it was out of dread of him that Lady Frances had accepted the escort of the Shlessingers to London.  She had never spoken to Marie about it, but many little signs had convinced the maid that her mistress lived in a state of continual nervous apprehension.  So far she had got in her narrative, when suddenly she sprang from her chair and her face was convulsed with surprise and fear.  \"See!\" she cried.  \"The miscreant follows still!  There is the very man of whom I speak.\"  Through the open sitting-room window I saw a huge, swarthy man with a bristling black beard walking slowly down the centre of the street and staring eagerly at the numbers of the houses.  It was clear that, like myself, he was on the track of the maid. Acting upon the impulse of the moment, I rushed out and accosted him.  \"You are an Englishman,\" I said.  \"What if I am?\" he asked with a most villainous scowl.  \"May I ask what your name is?\"  \"No, you may not,\" said he with decision.  The situation was awkward, but the most direct way is often the best.  \"Where is the Lady Frances Carfax?\" I asked.  He stared at me with amazement.  \"What have you done with her?  Why have you pursued her?  I insist upon an answer!\" said I.  The fellow gave a bellow of anger and sprang upon me like a tiger. I have held my own in many a struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and the fury of a fiend.  His hand was on my throat and my senses were nearly gone before an unshaven French ouvrier in a blue blouse darted out from a cabaret opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and struck my assailant a sharp crack over the forearm, which made him leave go his hold.  He stood for an instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether he should not renew his attack. Then, with a snarl of anger, he left me and entered the cottage from which I had just come.  I turned to thank my preserver, who stood beside me in the roadway.  \"Well, Watson,\" said he, \"a very pretty hash you have made of it! I rather think you had better come back with me to London by the night express.\"  An hour afterwards, Sherlock Holmes, in his usual garb and style, was seated in my private room at the hotel.  His explanation of his sudden and opportune appearance was simplicity itself, for, finding that he could get away from London, he determined to head me off at the next obvious point of my travels.  In the disguise of a workingman he had sat in the cabaret waiting for my appearance.  \"And a singularly consistent investigation you have made, my dear Watson,\" said he.  \"I cannot at the moment recall any possible blunder which you have omitted.  The total effect of your proceeding has been to give the alarm everywhere and yet to discover nothing.\"  \"Perhaps you would have done no better,\" I answered bitterly.  \"There is no 'perhaps' about it.  I HAVE done better.  Here is the Hon. Philip Green, who is a fellow-lodger with you in this hotel, and we may find him the starting-point for a more successful investigation.\"  A card had come up on a salver, and it was followed by the same bearded ruffian who had attacked me in the street.  He started when he saw me.  \"What is this, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.  \"I had your note and I have come.  But what has this man to do with the matter?\"  \"This is my old friend and associate, Dr. Watson, who is helping us in this affair.\"  The stranger held out a huge, sunburned hand, with a few words of apology.  \"I hope I didn't harm you.  When you accused me of hurting her I lost my grip of myself.  Indeed, I'm not responsible in these days.  My nerves are like live wires.  But this situation is beyond me.  What I want to know, in the first place, Mr. Holmes, is, how in the world you came to hear of my existence at all.\"  \"I am in touch with Miss Dobney, Lady Frances's governess.\"  \"Old Susan Dobney with the mob cap!  I remember her well.\"  \"And she remembers you.  It was in the days before--before you found it better to go to South Africa.\"  \"Ah, I see you know my whole story.  I need hide nothing from you.  I swear to you, Mr. Holmes, that there never was in this world a man who loved a woman with a more wholehearted love than I had for Frances.  I was a wild youngster, I know--not worse than others of my class.  But her mind was pure as snow.  She could not bear a shadow of coarseness. So, when she came to hear of things that I had done, she would have no more to say to me. And yet she loved me--that is the wonder of it!--loved me well enough to remain single all her sainted days just for my sake alone.  When the years had passed and I had made my money at Barberton I thought perhaps I could seek her out and soften her. I had heard that she was still unmarried, I found her at Lausanne and tried all I knew.  She weakened, I think, but her will was strong, and when next I called she had left the town.  I traced her to Baden, and then after a time heard that her maid was here. I'm a rough fellow, fresh from a rough life, and when Dr. Watson spoke to me as he did I lost hold of myself for a moment.  But for God's sake tell me what has become of the Lady Frances.\"  \"That is for us to find out,\" said Sherlock Holmes with peculiar gravity.  \"What is your London address, Mr. Green?\"  \"The Langham Hotel will find me.\"  \"Then may I recommend that you return there and be on hand in case I should want you?  I have no desire to encourage false hopes, but you may rest assured that all that can be done will be done for the safety of Lady Frances.  I can say no more for the instant.  I will leave you this card so that you may be able to keep in touch with us.  Now, Watson, if you will pack your bag I will cable to Mrs. Hudson to make one of her best efforts for two hungry travellers at 7:30 to-morrow.\"   A telegram was awaiting us when we reached our Baker Street rooms, which Holmes read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to me.  \"Jagged or torn,\" was the message, and the place of origin, Baden.  \"What is this?\" I asked.  \"It is everything,\" Holmes answered.  \"You may remember my seemingly irrelevant question as to this clerical gentleman's left ear. You did not answer it.\"  \"I had left Baden and could not inquire.\"  \"Exactly.  For this reason I sent a duplicate to the manager of the Englischer Hof, whose answer lies here.\"  \"What does it show?\"  \"It shows, my dear Watson, that we are dealing with an exceptionally astute and dangerous man.  The Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, missionary from South America, is none other than Holy Peters, one of the most unscrupulous rascals that Australia has ever evolved--and for a young country it has turned out some very finished types.  His particular specialty is the beguiling of lonely ladies by playing upon their religious feelings, and his so-called wife, an Englishwoman named Fraser, is a worthy helpmate.  The nature of his tactics suggested his identity to me, and this physical peculiarity--he was badly bitten in a saloon-fight at Adelaide in '89--confirmed my suspicion.  This poor lady is in the hands of a most infernal couple, who will stick at nothing, Watson.  That she is already dead is a very likely supposition.  If not, she is undoubtedly in some sort of confinement and unable to write to Miss Dobney or her other friends.  It is always possible that she never reached London, or that she has passed through it, but the former is improbable, as, with their system of registration, it is not easy for foreigners to play tricks"]]]
