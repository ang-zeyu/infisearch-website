By-o.\"  De Hooch and Willows walked back to the control room of Number Two Reactor in silence.  Once inside the control room, de Hooch said: \"How are those control circuits?\" Willows was supposed to have been checking them while he had been dragging Ferguson and Metty out of the antechamber.  \"Well, I ... I'm not sure. I'll show you what I've found so far, Guz. You ought to take a look at them. I ... I'd like you to take a look-see. I think\"--he gestured toward the console--\"I think they're all right except for the freezer vernier and the pressure release control.\"  _He doesn't trust his own work_, de Hooch thought. _Well, that's all right. Neither do I._  Painstakingly, the two of them went over the checking circuits. Willows was right. The freezer and pressure controls were inoperable.  \"Damn,\" said de Hooch. \"Double damn.\"  \"They're probably both stuck at the firewall,\" Willows said.  \"Sure. Where else? I'll have to go in there and unstick 'em. Help me get back into that two-legged tank again.\" He wished he knew more about what Ferguson and Metty had been doing. He wished he knew why the two men had gone into the anteroom in the first place. He wished a lot of things, but wishing was a useless pastime at this stage of the game.  If only one of the two men had been in a condition to talk!  He got back into his radiation-proof suit again, took one last look at the instruments on the console, and headed for the reactor.         *       *       *  Through the first radiation trap--left turn, right turn, right turn, left turn--through the \"cold\" room, through the second radiation trap, through the decontamination chamber, and through the third radiation trap into the anteroom. Now that Ferguson and Metty were safely out of the way, he could give his attention to the damage that had been done.  Had Ferguson and Metty actually come in to tap off a sample, as he had suggested to Willows? He looked around at the wreckage in the antechamber. Quite obviously, the heavy door of the sample chamber was wide open, and it certainly appeared that the wreckage was scattered from that point. Cautiously, he went over to look at the open sample chamber. It looked all right, except that the bottom was covered with a bright, metallic dust. He rubbed his finger over it and looked at the fingertip. A very fine dust. And yet it hadn't been scattered very much by the explosion. Heavy. Very likely osmium. Osmium 187 was stable, but it wasn't a normally used step toward Mercury 203. Four successive alpha captures would give Polonium 203, not mercury. Ditto for an oxygen fusion. It could be iridium or platinum, of course. Whatever it was, the instruments in his helmet told him it wasn't hot.  He had a hunch that Ferguson and Metty had been building Mercury 203 from Hafnium 179 by the process of successive fusions with Hydrogen 3 and that something had gone wrong with the H-3 production. It appeared that the explosion had been a simple chemical blast caused by the air oxidation of H-2. But the bleeder vent at the other end of the reactor had apparently kicked at the same time. An enormous amount of unused energy had been released, blowing the entire emergency bleeder system out.  Something didn't seem right. Something stuck in his craw, and he couldn't figure out what it was.  He opened up the conduit boxes that led through the antechamber from the control console to the reactor beyond the firewall. Everything looked fine. That meant that whatever it was that had fouled up the controls was on the other side of the firewall.  \"How does it look?\" Willows' voice came worriedly over the earphones.  \"Have I already said 'damn'?\" de Hooch asked.  \"You have,\" Willows said with forced lightness. \"You even said 'double damn'.\"  \"_Factorial_ damn, then!\" said de Hooch.  \"What's the matter?\"  \"Apparently the foul-up is on the _other_ side of the firewall.\"  \"Are you going in?\"  \"I'll have to.\"  \"All right. Watch yourself.\"  \"I will.\" He went over to the periscope that surveyed the part of the reactor beyond the firewall. Everything looked normal enough. He carefully checked the pressure gauge. Normal.  \"Check the spectro for me, will you?\" he asked. \"Make sure that's just the normal helium atmosphere in there.\"  \"Sure.\" A pause. \"Nothing but helium, Guz. What were you expecting?\"  \"I don't think I'd care to walk into a hydrogen atmosphere at three hundred Centigrade.\"  \"Neither would I, but how could there be hydrogen in there?\"  \"There shouldn't be. But there's something screwy going on here, and I can't put my finger on it.\"  \"Well, whatever it is, it isn't hydrogen in the reactor room.\"  \"O.K. Stand by. I'm going in.\"  He walked over to the firewall door. On the other side of it was a small chamber where the oxygen and nitrogen of normal air would be swept out before he opened the inner door to go into the inner chamber itself. There was no need for an air lock, since small amounts of impurities in the He-4 didn't bother anything.  It was just as he turned the lever that undogged the firewall door that he realized his mistake.  But it was too late.  The door jerked outward, and a hot wind picked him up and slammed him against the far wall.  There was a moment of pain.  Then--nothing.         *       *       *       *       *  _There was something familiar about the man who was turning the wheel, but de Hooch couldn't place it. The man was wearing a black hood, as befitted a torturer and executioner._  _\"Idiot,\" said the hooded man, giving the wheel of the rack a little more pressure, \"explain the following: If a half plus a half is equal to a whole, why is halfnium plus halfnium not equal to wholmium?\"_  _Stretched as he was on the rack, de Hooch could not think straight because of the excruciating pain._  _\"Because a half is eight point two eight per cent heavier than a hole,\" said de Hooch._  _\"You are an idiot, none the less,\" said the torturer. He gave the wheel another twist. De Hooch wanted to scream, but he couldn't._  _\"Try again,\" said the torturer. \"What is a half plus four plus four plus four plus four plus--\"_  \"Stop!\" _screamed de Hooch_. \"Stop! _Stop at the osmium!_\"  _\"Ah! But it_ didn't _stop at the osmium,\" said the hooded man. \"It went on and on and on. Plus four plus four plus four plus four plus four--until there were so many plus fours in there that the place looked like an old-fashioned golf course.\"_  _\"My legs hurt,\" said de Hooch. The man was no longer wearing a hood, but de Hooch couldn't tell if it was Willows or himself._  _\"We will all go together when we go,\" said the man._  _De Hooch turned his head away and looked at the ceiling._  And he realized that it was the ceiling of the antechamber.  \"My legs hurt,\" he repeated. And he could hear the hoarse whisper inside the helmet. He realized that he was lying flat on his back. He had been jarred around quite a bit in the suit.  He wondered if he could sit up. He managed to get both arms behind him and push himself into a sitting position. He wiggled his feet. The servos responded. He hurt all over, but a little experiment told him that he was only bruised. Nothing was broken. He hadn't been hit as hard as Ferguson and Metty had been.  \"Willows?\" he said. \"Willows?\"  There was no answer from the earphones.  He looked at the chronometer dial inside his helmet. Oh two forty-nine. He had been unconscious less than ten minutes.  The same glance brought his eyes to two other dials. The internal radiation of the suit was a little high, but nothing to worry about. But the dial registering the external radiation was plenty high. Without the protection of the suit, he wouldn't have lived through those ten minutes.  Where was Willows?  And then he knew, and he pushed any thought of further help from that quarter out of his mind. What had to be done would have to be done by Peter de Hooch alone. He climbed to his feet.  His head hurt, and he swayed with nausea and pain. Only the massive weight of the suit's shoes kept him upright. Then it passed, and he blinked his eyes and shook his head to clear it. He found he was holding his breath, and he let it out.  The trouble had been so simple, and yet he hadn't seen it. Oh, yes, he had! He _must_ have, subconsciously. Otherwise, how would he have guessed that the stuff in the sampling chamber was Osmium 187? Ferguson and Metty _had_ been trying to make Mercury 203 by adding eight successive tritium nuclei to Hafnium 179, progressing through Tantalum 182, Tungsten 185, Rhenium 188, Osmium 191, Iridium 194, Platinum 197, and Gold 200, all of which were unstable.  But the Hydrogen 3 reaction had gone wrong. The doubling had set in, producing Helium 4. Successive additions of the alpha particles to Hafnium 179 had produced, first, Tungsten 183, and then Osmium 187, both of which were stable.  Ferguson and Metty, seeing that something was wrong, drew off a sample and then reset the reaction to produce the Hg-203 they wanted. Then they had come down to pick up the sample.  They hadn't realized that the helium production had gone wild. Much more helium than necessary was being produced, and the bleeder valve had failed. When they opened the sample chamber, they got a blast of high-pressure helium right in the face. The shock of that sudden release had jarred the whole atmosphere inside the reaction chamber, and the bleeder valve had let go. But the violence of the pressure release had caused a fault to the surface to open up and had closed the valve again--jammed it, probably. There had been enough pressure left in there to blow de Hooch up against the nearest wall when he opened the door. Since the pressure indicator system was connected to the release system, when one had failed, the other had failed. That's why the pressure gauge had indicated normal.  And, of course, it had been the pressure differential that had caused the controls to stick. Well, they ought to be all right now, then. He decided he'd better take a look.   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23765"],["title","Captain Boldheart & the Latin-Grammar Master (#1)"],["body"," Provisions now ran very low. Our hero put the crew on short allowance, and put himself on shorter allowance than any man in the ship. But his spirit kept him fat. In this extremity, the gratitude of Boozey, the captain of the foretop whom our readers may remember, was truly affecting. The loving though lowly William repeatedly requested to be killed, and preserved for the captain's table.  We now approach a change in affairs.  One day during a gleam of sunshine and when the weather had moderated, the man at the masthead--too weak now to touch his hat, besides its having been blown away--called out,  \"Savages!\"  All was now expectation.  Presently fifteen hundred canoes, each paddled by twenty savages, were seen advancing in excellent order. They were a light green colour (the Savages were), and sang, with great energy, the following strain:    Choo a choo a choo tooth.     Muntch, muntch. Nycey!   Choo a choo a choo tooth.     Muntch, muntch. Nyce!  As the shades of night were by this time closing in, these expressions were supposed to embody this simple people's views of the Evening Hymn. But it too soon appeared that the song was a translation of \"For what we are going to receive,\" &c.  The chief, imposingly decorated with feathers of lively colours, and having the majestic appearance of a fighting Parrot, no sooner understood (he understood English perfectly) that the ship was The Beauty, Captain Boldheart, than he fell upon his face on the deck, and could not be persuaded to rise until the captain had lifted him up, & told him he wouldn't hurt him. All the rest of the savages also fell on their faces with marks of terror, and had also to be lifted up one by one. Thus the fame of the great Boldheart had gone before him, even among these children of Nature.  Turtles and oysters were now produced in astonishing numbers, and on these and yams the people made a hearty meal. After dinner the Chief told Captain Boldheart that there was better feeding up at the village, and that he would be glad to take him and his officers there. Apprehensive of treachery, Boldheart ordered his boat's crew to attend him completely armed. And well were it for other commanders if their precautions--but let us not anticipate.  [Illustration: \"Arm-in-arm with the Chief\"]  [Illustration: \"TWO SAVAGES FLOURED HIM BEFORE PUTTING HIM TO THE FIRE.\"]  When the canoes arrived at the beach, the darkness of the night was illumined by the light of an immense fire. Ordering his boat's crew (with the intrepid though illiterate William at their head) to keep close and be upon their guard, Boldheart bravely went on, arm-in-arm with the Chief.  But how to depict the captain's surprise when he found a ring of Savages singing in chorus that barbarous translation of \"For what we are going to receive, &c.,\" which has been given above, and dancing hand-in-hand round the Latin-Grammar-Master, in a hamper with his head shaved, while two savages floured him, before putting him to the fire to be cooked!  Boldheart now took counsel with his officers on the course to be adopted. In the mean time, the miserable captive never ceased begging pardon and imploring to be delivered. On the generous Boldheart's proposal, it was at length resolved that he should not be cooked, but should be allowed to remain raw, on two conditions. Namely,       1. That he should never under any circumstances presume to teach      any boy any thing any more.       2. That, if taken back to England, he should pass his life in      travelling to find out boys who wanted their exercises done, and      should do their exercises for those boys for nothing, and never say      a word about it.  Drawing his sword from its sheath, Boldheart swore him to these conditions on its shining blade. The prisoner wept bitterly, and appeared acutely to feel the errors of his past career.  The captain then ordered his boat's crew to make ready for a volley, and after firing to re-load quickly. \"And expect a score or two on ye to go head over heels,\" murmured William Boozey; \"for I'm a looking at ye.\" With those words the derisive though deadly William took a good aim.  \"Fire!\"  The ringing voice of Boldheart was lost in the report of the guns and the screeching of the savages. Volley after volley awakened the numerous echoes. Hundreds of savages were killed, hundreds wounded, and thousands ran howling into the woods. The Latin-Grammar-Master had a spare night-cap lent him, and a longtail coat which he wore hind side before. He presented a ludicrous though pitiable appearance, and serve him right.  [Illustration: \"THE LATIN-GRAMMAR-MASTER HAD A SPARE NIGHTCAP LENT HIM AND A LONGTAIL COAT WHICH HE WORE HIND SIDE BEFORE.\"]  [Illustration: \"ERE THE SUN WENT DOWN FULL MANY A HORNPIPE HAD BEEN DANCED ... BY THE UNCOUTH THOUGH AGILE WILLIAM.\"]  We now find Captain Boldheart, with this rescued wretch on board, standing off for other islands. At one of these, not a cannibal island, but a pork and vegetable one, he married (only in fun on his part) the King's daughter. Here he rested some time, receiving from the natives great quantities of precious stones, gold dust, elephants' teeth, and sandal wood, and getting very rich. This, too, though he almost every day made presents of enormous value to his men.  The ship being at length as full as she could hold of all sorts of valuable things, Boldheart gave orders to weigh the anchor, and turn the Beauty's head towards England. These orders were obeyed with three cheers, and ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced on deck by the uncouth though agile William.  We next find Captain Boldheart about three leagues off Madeira, surveying through his spy-glass a stranger of suspicious appearance making sail towards him. On his firing a gun ahead of her to bring her to, she ran up a flag, which he instantly recognized as the flag from the mast in the back-garden at home.  [Illustration: \"Married the Chief's daughter\"]  Inferring from this, that his father had put to sea to seek his long-lost son, the captain sent his own boat on board the stranger, to inquire if this was so, and if so, whether his father's intentions were strictly honourable. The boat came back with a present of greens and fresh meat, and reported that the stranger was The Family of twelve hundred tons, and had not only the captain's father on board, but also his mother, with the majority of his aunts and uncles, and all his cousins. It was further reported to Boldheart that the whole of these relations had expressed themselves in a becoming manner, and were anxious to embrace him and thank him for the glorious credit he had done them. Boldheart at once invited them to breakfast next morning on board the Beauty, and gave orders for a brilliant ball that should last all day.  It was in the course of the night that the captain discovered the hopelessness of reclaiming the Latin-Grammar-Master. That thankless traitor was found out, as the two ships lay near each other, communicating with The Family by signals, and offering to give up Boldheart. He was hanged at the yard-arm the first thing in the morning, after having it impressively pointed out to him by Boldheart that this was what spiters came to.  The meeting between the captain and his parents was attended with tears. His uncles and aunts would have attended their meeting with tears too, but he wasn't going to stand that. His cousins were very much astonished by the size of his ship and the discipline of his men, and were greatly overcome by the splendour of his uniform. He kindly conducted them round the vessel, and pointed out every thing worthy of notice. He also fired his hundred guns, and found it amusing to witness their alarm.  The entertainment surpassed everything ever seen on board ship, and lasted from ten in the morning until seven the next morning. Only one disagreeable incident occurred. Captain Boldheart found himself obliged to put his cousin Tom in irons, for being disrespectful. On the boy's promising amendment, however, he was humanely released after a few hours' close confinement.  Boldheart now took his mother down into the great cabin, and asked after the young lady with whom, it was well known to the world, he was in love. His mother replied that the object of his affections was then at school at Margate, for the benefit of sea-bathing (it was the month of September), but that she feared the young lady's friends were still opposed to the union. Boldheart at once resolved, if necessary, to bombard the town.  Taking the command of his ship with this intention, and putting all but fighting men on board The Family, with orders to that vessel to keep in company, Boldheart soon anchored in Margate Roads. Here he went ashore well-armed, and attended by his boat's crew (at their head the faithful though ferocious William), and demanded to see the Mayor, who came out of his office.  \"Dost know the name of yon ship, Mayor?\" asked Boldheart fiercely.  [Illustration: \"DOST KNOW THE NAME OF YON SHIP, MAYOR?\"]  [Illustration: STANDING SENTRY OVER HIM]  \"No,\" said the Mayor, rubbing his eyes, which he could scarce believe when he saw the goodly vessel riding at anchor.  \"She is named the Beauty,\" said the captain.  \"Hah!\" exclaimed the Mayor, with a start. \"And you, then, are Captain Boldheart?\"  \"The same.\"  A pause ensued. The Mayor trembled.  \"Now, Mayor,\" said the captain, \"choose. Help me to my Bride, or be bombarded.\"  The Mayor begged for two hours' grace, in which to make inquiries respecting the young lady. Boldheart accorded him but one; and during that one placed William Boozey sentry over him, with a drawn sword and instructions to accompany him wherever he went, and to run him through the body if he showed a sign of playing false.  At the end of the hour, the Mayor re-appeared more dead than alive, closely waited on by Boozey more alive than dead.  [Illustration: \"His lovely Bride came forth\"]  \"Captain,\" said the"]]]
