Thursby looked angrily baffled for a moment, then he clamped his lips grimly. \"As long as we're here, I guess we might as well.\"  I knew perfectly well it was what he had intended to do all along.  \"One of you guys spin that wheel,\" he said to the technicians. One of them gave the wheel a spin and dropped the ball. It clattered on its merry way and dropped into a slot. Forty-two.  Thursby took the gadget out of his pocket. It was still set at Thirteen.  The men who had surrounded Howley on the night of his arrest had been keeping their eyes open, and they had seen how Howley had handled the thing. Well--_almost_ how. Thursby had the lens opening pointed at the wheel, but his thumb and fingers weren't touching the silver plates properly.  \"Spin it again,\" he said.  Everyone's eyes were on the ball as it whirled, so I had time to get my own copy of Howley's gadget out and set it at Thirteen. I hoped the thing would work for me. I concentrated on Thirteen, making sure my thumb and fingers were placed right.  Evidently they were. The ball fell into Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low.  A huge grin spread over Thursby's face, but he was man enough not to turn and grin at me. \"Try it again,\" he said.  Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low.  \"I wonder how the thing works?\" said Thursby, looking at the gadget in a sort of pleased awe.  \"You'd better be able to prove that it _does_ work, Thursby,\" I said, trying to put irritation into my voice.  This time, he did grin at me. \"Oh, I think we can prove that, all right.\" He turned back to the technician. \"Spin it once more, Sam, and show the defense counsel, here, how it works.\"  The technician did as he was told. \"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low,\" he chanted, grinning.  \"Let's try another number,\" Thursby said. He turned the dial to One. And this time, when he pointed it, his fingers were touching the plates in the right places.  \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"Let me spin that thing.\"  \"Be my guest, counselor,\" said Thursby.  I spun the wheel and scooted the ball along the rim. It dropped into a slot. One, Red, Odd, and Low. I looked as disappointed and apprehensive as I could.  \"Co-incidence,\" I said. \"Nothing more. You haven't proved anything.\"  Thursby's grin widened. \"Of course I haven't,\" he said with a soothing, patronizing tone. \"But I don't have to prove anything until I get to court.\"  Then he looked at the technicians and jerked his head toward the door. \"Let's go, boys. Maybe the counselor wants to look over the table for himself. Maybe he thinks we've got it rigged.\"  There was a chorus of guffaws as they walked out. I just stood there, scowling, trying to keep from laughing even harder than they were.         *       *       *       *       *  Jason Howley sat next to me at the defense table, just inside the low partition that divided the court from the public. There weren't many people in the auditorium itself; listening to some poor dope get himself sentenced for cheating at gambling is considered pretty dull entertainment in the State of Nevada.  Thursby had managed to push the indictment through the grand jury in a hurry, but, as he sat across the room from me at the prosecution table, I thought I could detect a false note in the assumed look of confidence that he was trying to wear.  Howley tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around, and he whispered: \"How much longer?\"  I tapped my wrist watch. \"Couple minutes. Judge Lapworth is one of those precisionists. Never a moment late or early. Getting jumpy?\"  He shook his head gently and smiled. \"No. You've handled this even better than I'd have imagined. You thought of things I didn't even know existed. I'm no lawyer; I can see that.\"  I returned the smile. \"And I don't invent gimmicks, either. So what?\"  His eyes looked at me from behind the distorting negative lenses. \"I've been wondering, counselor--why are you so interested in this? I mean, I offered you a pretty good fee, and all that, but it seems to me you're taking an unusual interest in the case.\"  I grinned at him. \"Mr. Howley, my profession is Law--with a capital L. The study of the Law isn't like the study of physics or whatever; these are manmade laws--commands, not descriptions. They don't necessarily have anything to do with facts at all. Take the word 'insanity,' for instance; the word isn't even used by head-shrinkers any more because it's a legal definition that has nothing whatever to do with the condition of the human mind.  \"Now, any such set of laws as that can't possibly be self-consistent and still have some use on an action level. A lawyer's job is to find the little inconsistencies in the structure, the places where the pieces have been jammed together in an effort to make them look like a structured whole. To find, in other words, the loopholes and use them.  \"And when I find a loophole, I like to wring everything I can out of it. I'm enjoying this.\"  Howley nodded. \"I see. But what if something--\"  I held up my hand to silence him, because the door to the judges' chambers opened at that moment, and Judge Lapworth came in as the bailiff announced him. We all stood up while the bailiff intoned his \"Oyez, oyez.\"  Thursby made a short preliminary speech to the jury, and I requested and was granted permission to hold my own opening statement until the defense was ready to present its case.  Thursby was looking worried, although it took a trained eye to see it. I was pretty sure I knew why. He had been pushed too hard and had gone too fast. He'd managed to slide through the grand jury too easily, and I had managed to get the trial date set for a week later. Thursby's case was far from being as tight as he wanted it.         *       *       *       *       *  I just sat still while the prosecution brought forth its witnesses and evidence. The croupier, the deputies, several employees of the Golden Casino, and a couple of patrons all told their stories. I waived cross-examination in every case, which made Thursby even edgier than he had been.  When he called in the head of the technicians who had inspected the table at the casino, I made no objection to his testimony, but I made my first cross-examination.  \"Mr. Thompson, you have stated your qualifications as an expert on the various devices which have been used to illegally influence the operation of gambling devices in this state.\"  Thursby said: \"Oh, if the Court please, I should like to remind counsel for the defense that he has already accepted the qualifications of the witness.\"  \"I am not attempting to impugn the qualifications of the witness,\" I snapped.  Judge Lapworth frowned at Thursby. \"Are you making an objection, Mr. District Attorney?\"  Thursby pursed his lips, said, \"No, Your Honor,\" and sat down.  \"Proceed with the cross-examination,\" said the judge.  \"Mr. Thompson,\" I said, \"you have testified that you examined the table at the Golden Casino for such devices and found none. Is that right?\"  \"That's right,\" he said positively.  \"Have you seen the device labeled People's Exhibit A, which was found by the officers on the person of the defendant?\"  \"Well ... yes. I have.\"  \"Have you examined this device?\"  Thursby was on his feet. \"Objection, Your Honor! This material was not brought out in direct examination!\"  \"Sustained,\" said Judge Lapworth.  \"Very well, Your Honor,\" I said. Then I turned back to Thompson. \"As an expert in this field, Mr. Thompson, you have examined many different devices for cheating gambling equipment, haven't you?\"  \"Yes, I have.\"  \"How many, would you say?\"  \"Oh ... several hundred.\"  \"Several hundred different _types_?\"  \"No. Several hundred individual devices. Most of them are just variations of two or three basic types.\"  \"And you are familiar with the function of these basic types and their variations?\"  \"I am.\"  \"You know exactly how all of them work, then?\"  He saw where I was heading. \"Most of them,\" he hedged.  Thursby saw where I was heading, too, and was sweating. I'd managed to get around his objection.  \"Have you ever examined any which you could not understand?\"  \"I ... I don't quite know what you mean.\"  \"Have you ever,\" I said firmly, \"come across a device used in cheating which you could not comprehend or explain the operation of?\"  Thursby stood up. \"Same objection as before, Your Honor.\"  \"Your Honor,\" I said, \"I am merely trying to find the limitations of the witness' knowledge; I am not trying to refute his acknowledged ability.\"  \"Overruled,\" said Judge Lapworth. \"The witness will answer the question.\"  I repeated the question.  \"Yes,\" Thompson said in a low voice.  \"More than once?\"  \"Only once.\"  \"Only once. You did find one device which didn't operate in any fashion you can explain. Is that right?\"  \"That's right.\"  \"Can you tell me what this device was?\"  Thompson took a deep breath. \"It was People's Exhibit A--the device taken from the defendant at the time of his arrest.\"  There was a buzz in the courtroom.  \"No more questions,\" I said, turning away. Then, before Thompson could leave the stand, I turned back to him. \"Oh, just one moment, Mr. Thompson. Did you examine this device carefully? Did you take it apart?\"  \"I opened it and looked at it.\"  \"You just looked at it? You didn't subject it to any tests?\"  Thompson took a deep breath. \"No.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"There wasn't anything inside it to test.\"         *       *       *       *       *  This time, there was more than just a buzz around the courtroom. Judge Lapworth rapped for order.  When the room was quiet, I said: \"The box was empty, then?\"  \"Well, no. Not exactly empty. It had some stuff in it.\"  I turned to the judge. \"If the Court please, I would like to have the so-called device, Exhibit A, opened so that the members of the jury may see for themselves what it contains.\"  [Illustration]  Judge Lapworth said: \"The Court would like very much to see the internal workings of this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23540"],["title","The Twin Cousins (#1)"],["body","rty, either. Auntie Prim thinks they won't any of 'em come.\"  \"Oh, yes, they will! their mammas said they might.\"  \"Hope they won't!\" said Flaxie, stamping her foot so hard that a \"hop-toad\" thought there was an earthquake, and hurried out of the way. \"Hope they won't, any of 'em! I'm not agoin' to go to it myself,--so there!\"  Milly peeped up in surprise.  \"I hate it, Milly Allen; let's run away!\"  \"Why, Flaxie Frizzle!\" was all Mabel could say, for the idea of a little girl's running away from her own party was truly amazing.  \"You think I don't dare,\" said Flaxie; \"but I do dare! I'm agoin' right off in the woods, and stay there! And I _thought_ you's agoin' with me. You're my twin cousin, and it's your party as much as 'tis mine.\"  Milly knew this was very wrong, and ought to have said so to Flaxie. If they had already done one foolish thing, it would make it no better to do another foolish thing, as _you_ can see in a moment. But Milly wanted to please Flaxie, so she said stoutly:  \"Oh, yes, I'm going!\"  Silly children! Flaxie pretended she was running away from her party, but she didn't mean to _stay_ away. Oh, no! She wouldn't have missed the party for anything. Even now she was beginning to wonder what Dora was baking.  The woods were deep and high and dark. Before they had gone quarter of a mile Flaxie wanted to turn back, but waited for Milly to speak first.  \"Oh dear!\" cried Milly, trembling, for she had never been in such a place before. \"You s'pose it's night, Flaxie? Has the sun set?\"  \"No, it hasn't. But we ought to brought a imbreller; it's goin' to rain,\" replied Flaxie, holding out her hand to catch a drop. \"I didn't spect you'd be so 'fraid, Milly Allen; but if you _are_ afraid, we'll go right home this minute.\"  They turned, but the wrong way, and instead of going home, only struck deeper into the woods. They didn't see the sky at all, and all the light seemed to come from the gay leaves and the gold of Flaxie's hair; for I am sorry to say she had lost her hat.  \"Ha' pas' two; ha' pas' two,\" said she dreamily. \"Let's go home to the party.\"  \"Thought you hated the old party,\" said Milly, falling over a dead tree, and crying.  \"Well, I was only in fun. Don't you know when I'm in fun, you goosie?\"  You see they were both getting cross as well as hungry, for dinner-time was past long ago. In another hour they were half-starved.  \"I spect we're lost,\" said Flaxie, calmly. \"Going to rain, too; sun setting. Pretty near midnight--\"  Upon this Milly began to scream.  \"Well, then, what made you hide behind the lilac-bush, and not invite the folks, Milly Allen?\" exclaimed Flaxie, feeling obliged to scold _somebody_; and then she too began to scream, though nobody heard, for they were three or four miles from the village.  They wound in and out, in and out, among the trees; but it was like a little bird putting his head through the bars of his cage. It did no good at all; they couldn't get out.  Thoroughly tired at last and discouraged, the poor babes in the wood lay down and fell asleep in each other's arms. I know it was a pretty sight,--the black head and the golden head so close together, and the beautiful bright trees bending over to say, \"Good night.\"     CHAPTER II.  STAYING OUT TO TEA.   But before the robins had had time to cover them with leaves, or even to think of it, there was a shout from Preston Gray.  \"Hurrah, boys, I've found 'em!\"  He and half a dozen other lads had been out all the afternoon in search of the little wanderers, and here it was five o'clock. They carried them home on their backs, taking turns, and Flaxie looked up only once to ask sleepily:  \"Is it ha' pas' two?\"  \"Won't she catch it, though?\" said Bert Abbott, who was in great awe of Mrs. Prim.  But Mrs. Prim was a just woman, and she thought poor little Flaxie's punishment had been hard enough. Her party was over long ago; the guests hadn't stayed to supper, and had gone home saying they \"didn't think Flaxie was very polite,\" and they \"wouldn't go to her parties any more.\" And here she was, tired and wretched, and scratched all over by blackberry bushes. No, Auntie Prim didn't even scold. She merely looked through her spectacles at grandma, and said, \"Children are so absurd!\"  And grandma replied sorrowfully:  \"Well, they have to suffer for their own naughtiness, and that does grieve me!\"  \"They ought to suffer,\" said Mrs. Prim; \"it is the only way they can learn not to behave so again.\"  Dear little Milly heard this, and remembered it, and repeated it to her mother the next week when she went home to Hilltop. She thought _she_ had suffered so much that she should never be \"absurd\" again, even to please her beloved Flaxie Frizzle.  After she had gone away, Flaxie wandered drearily about the house, saying, \"Oh dear! what shall I do without my twin cousin?\"  You would have thought she had enough left to make her happy. Dr. Gray's house stood on a hill facing the river, with a green yard in front, and a stable and two gardens behind it. It was all beautiful, and Flaxie enjoyed the stable as well as the fruit and flower gardens, for she was very fond of the horses, Whiz and Hiawatha, and the cows and the hens. You needn't tell anybody, but I do pity children who never hunted for hens' nests: it is such capital fun! And then there was the handsome dog, Tantra-Bogus, one of Flaxie's best friends.  In the house she had her \"splendid Dr. Papa;\" her dear brother Preston, who could whittle all sorts of things with a penknife; her darling Grandma Gray, an old lady with white hair, white cap, and white ribbons; and last, but not least, she had the \"beautifullest baby\" Philip, who could stand on his head \"just as cunning,\" and \"hug grizzly\"--that is, like a grizzly bear. Flaxie loved him with her whole heart, but there were moments when she felt half ashamed of him, for he was eighteen months old, and hadn't a sign of a tooth; wasn't it awful?  \"Perhaps he'll cut one before your mother and Julia come home; I keep hoping so,\" said grandma, feeling in baby's mouth with her finger, which baby bit hard, like an old rogue as he was.  \"Will they give him some gold teeth, if his don't ever cut?\" asked Flaxie anxiously. \"Preston says they will.\"  \"No,\" replied Mrs. Prim, who sat by the window, with her little ebony work-box on a stand beside her. \"Your brother Preston says very absurd things merely in sport; but you must not be so foolish as to believe them.\"  Down dropped Flaxie's head in grandma's lap, her hair falling over grandma's black silk apron in a golden shower.  Mrs. Prim looked surprised. She did not know that Flaxie really _had_ believed in those gold teeth, and had been comforted by thinking how Phil would outshine everybody by-and-by! And now the poor little girl was crying because it was all a mistake, and because Mrs. Prim had said she was \"foolish.\"  \"Run and let in the cat,\" said grandma; \"don't you hear her mewing?\"  When Kitty Gray was let in, she came bringing a mouse, and Flaxie laughed to see her run right up to grandma and rub against her dress.  \"Good pussy, pretty pussy,\" said grandma, stroking the cat, who almost purred her heart out for joy. Not a mouse did she ever catch but she brought it to grandma or mamma to show it; but she never brought one to Mrs. Prim. I wonder why not.  \"Now let her out, Mary,\" said grandma to Flaxie. \"And go ask Dora if it isn't almost time to make the gravy for dinner.\"  When Flaxie skipped away, grandma said to Mrs. Prim, \"The poor child is lonesome, with nothing to do.\"  \"She ought to do something,\" replied Mrs. Prim, making a knot in her silk. \"If she were my little girl, I should send her to school, to occupy her mind.\"  \"Should you?\" said Grandma Gray, hesitating, and patting her white curls. \"Her mother said there were some naughty children about here, and she might be led into mischief at school, while Julia is away.\"  \"I'm sure she is led into mischief at home,\" said Mrs. Prim.  \"Very true. Perhaps she would be quite as safe at school. I will talk to her father about it,\" said Grandma Gray.  And of course Dr. Papa said, \"Just as you please;\" and Flaxie was sent to school with her satchel and books.  She came home the first day very dirty, after the dinner was cold, and Auntie Prim wondered if such a child ought to have any pudding.  \"Oh, auntie,\" said Flaxie, shaking her flying hair, \"I saw a little girl down under the hill, and says I, 'What's your name?' and says she, 'Patty C. Proudfit.' And I thought you'd want me to go down and play with her, and I did.\"  This was the first Mrs. Prim had ever heard of \"Patty C. Proudfit,\" and grandma knew nothing about her either; but Preston said the Proudfit family had just moved into town, \"a whole army of 'em, and lived in that black house under the hill.\"  Next day, as Mrs. Prim was looking out of the window, she saw Flaxie and Miss Patty playing dolls under the trees. Patty was two years older than Flaxie, but her red hair had not been combed lately, her dress was torn, and her shoes were out at the toes.  \"She is not a nice child; I am sorry to see this,\" sighed Mrs. Prim, turning away from the window. \"But as Mrs. Gray is coming home next week, I shall do nothing about it.\"  Flaxie's mind was \"occupied\" now, and she gave very little trouble in the house. Patty was \"a dear, sweet, good little girl,\" she said, \"and she loved her next as much as her twin cousin.\"  But you can't be quite happy in this world; and Patty's baby brother, only nine months old, had cut four whole teeth, and I won't say this wasn't a trial to Flaxie.  \"Poh, but they're eeny-teeny things,\" said she to grandma. \"Phil's will be lots and lots bigger--when he gets 'em.\"  Patty came up to the fence one day, where Flaxie stood smelling a geranium leaf.  \"How do you do?\" said she.  \"I do as I please, 'cause Auntie Prim is gone,\" replied little Flaxie, with a saucy smile. She was really very bold and naughty sometimes, as you have already found out, I suppose.  \""]]]
