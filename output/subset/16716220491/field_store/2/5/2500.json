For the absolute magnitudes of those stars for which it has hitherto been possible to carry out a determination, we find a value of _M_ between -8 and +13. We shall give in the third chapter short tables of the absolutely brightest and faintest stars now known.   8. _Photographic magnitudes._ The magnitudes which have been mentioned in the preceding paragraphs all refer to observations taken with the eye, and are called _visual_ magnitudes. The total intensity of a star is, however, essentially dependent on the instrument used in measuring the intensity. Besides the eye, the astronomers use a photographic plate, bolometer, a photo-electric cell, and other instruments. The difference in the results obtained with these instruments is due to the circumstance that different parts of the radiation are taken into account.  The usual photographic plates, which have their principal sensibility in the violet parts of the spectrum, give us the _photographic_ magnitudes of the stars. It is, however, to be remarked that these magnitudes may vary from one plate to another, according to the distributive function of the plate (compare L. M. 67). This variation, which has not yet been sufficiently studied, seems however to be rather inconsiderable, and must be neglected in the following.  The photographic magnitude of a star will in these lectures be denoted by _m′_, corresponding to a visual magnitude _m_.  In practical astronomy use is also made of plates which, as the result of a certain preparation (in colour baths or in other ways), have acquired a distributive function nearly corresponding to that of the eye, and especially have a maximum point at the same wave-lengths. Such magnitudes are called _photo-visual_ (compare the memoir of PARKHURST in A. J. 36 [1912]).  The photographic magnitude of a star is generally determined from measurements of the diameter of the star on the plate. A simple mathematical relation then permits us to determine _m′_. The diameter of a star image increases with the time of exposure. This increase is due in part to the diffraction of the telescope, to imperfect achromatism or spherical aberration of the objective, to irregular grinding of the glass, and especially to variations in the refraction of the air, which produce an oscillation of the image around a mean position.  The _zero-point_ of the photographic magnitudes is so determined that this magnitude coincides with the visual magnitude for such stars as belong to the spectral type A0 and have _m_ = 6.0, according to the proposal of the international solar conference at Bonn, 1911.  Determinations of the photographic or photo-visual magnitudes may now be carried out with great accuracy. The methods for this are many and are well summarised in the Report of the Council of the R. A. S. of the year 1913. The most effective and far-reaching method seems to be that proposed by SCHWARZSCHILD, called the half-grating method, by which two exposures are taken of the same part of the sky, while at one of the exposures a certain grating is used that reduces the magnitudes by a constant degree.   9. _Colour of the stars._ The radiation of a star is different for different wave-lengths (λ). As regarding other mass phenomena we may therefore mention:--(1) the _total radiation_ or intensity (_I_), (2) the _mean wave-length_ (λ_0), (3) the _dispersion of the wave-length_ (σ). In the preceding paragraphs we have treated of the total radiation of the stars as this is expressed through their magnitudes. The mean wave-length is pretty closely defined by the _colour_, whereas the dispersion of the wave-length is found from the _spectrum_ of the stars.  There are blue (B), white (W), yellow (Y) and red (R) stars, and intermediate colours. The exact method is to define the colour through the mean wave-length (and not conversely) or the _effective_ wave-length as it is most usually called, or from the _colour-index_. We shall revert later to this question. There are, however, a great many direct eye-estimates of the colour of the stars.  _Colour corresponding to a given spectrum._      _Sp._    _Colour_       _Number_      B3        YW-            161      A0        YW-            788      A5        YW             115      F5        YW, WY-        295      G5        WY             216      K5        WY+, Y-        552      M         Y, Y+           95      -----------------------------                      Sum ... 2222  _Spectrum corresponding to a given colour._      _Colour_       _Sp._       _Number_      W, W+          A0           281      YW-            A0           356      YW             A5           482      YW+, YW-       F3           211      WY             G4           264      WY+, Y-        K1           289      Y, Y+          K4           254      RY-, RY        K5            85      --------------------------------                         Sum ... 2222  The signs + and - indicate intermediate shades of colour.  The preceding table drawn up by Dr. MALMQUIST from the colour observations of MÜLLER and KEMPF in Potsdam, shows the connection between the colours of the stars and their spectra.  The Potsdam observations contain all stars north of the celestial equator having an apparent magnitude brighter than 7m.5.  We find from these tables that there is a well-pronounced _regression_ in the correlation between the spectra and the colours of the stars. Taking together all white stars we find the corresponding mean spectral type to be A0, but to A0 corresponds, upon an average, the colour yellow-white. The yellow stars belong in the mean to the K-type, but the K-stars have upon an average a shade of white in the yellow colour. The coefficient of correlation (_r_) is not easy to compute in this case, because one of the attributes, the colour, is not strictly graduated (_i.e._ it is not expressed in numbers defining the colour).[5] Using the coefficient of contingency of PEARSON, it is, however, possible to find a fairly reliable value of the coefficient of correlation, and MALMQUIST has in this way found _r_ = +0.85, a rather high value.  In order to facilitate the discussion of the relation between colour and spectrum it is convenient to deal here with the question of the spectra of the stars.   10. _Spectra of the stars._ In order to introduce the discussion I first give a list of the wave-lengths of the FRAUENHOFER lines in the spectrum, and the corresponding chemical elements.      _FRAUENHOFER line_    _Element_          λ        A                                   759.4        B                                   686.8        C(α)               H (hydrogen)     656.3        D_1                Na (sodium)      589.6        D_3                He               587.6        E                  Fe (iron)        527.0        F(β)               H                486.2         (γ)               H                434.1        G                  Ca (calcium)     430.8        h(δ)               H                410.2        H(ε)               Ca(H)            396.9        K                  Ca               393.4  The first column gives the FRAUENHOFER denomination of each line. Moreover the hydrogen lines α, β, γ, δ, ε are denoted. The second column gives the name of the corresponding element, to which each line is to be attributed. The third column gives the wave-length expressed in millionths of a millimeter as unit (μμ).  On plate III, where the classification of the stellar spectra according to the Harvard system is reproduced, will be found also the wave-lengths of the principal H and He lines.  By the visual spectrum is usually understood the part of the radiation between the FRAUENHOFER lines A to H (λ = 760 to 400 μμ), whereas the photographic spectrum generally lies between F and K (λ = 500 to 400 μμ).  In the earliest days of spectroscopy the spectra of the stars were classified according to their visual spectra. This classification was introduced by SECCHI and was later more precisely defined by VOGEL. The three classes I, II, III of VOGEL correspond approximately to the colour classification into white, yellow, and red stars. Photography has now almost entirely taken the place of visual observations of spectra, so that SECCHI's and VOGEL's definitions of the stellar spectra are no longer applicable. The terminology now used was introduced by PICKERING and Miss CANNON and embraces a great many types, of which we here describe the principal forms as they are defined in Part. II of Vol. XXVIII of the Annals of the Harvard Observatory. It may be remarked that PICKERING first arranged the types in alphabetical order A, B, C, &c., supposing that order to correspond to the temperature of the stars. Later this was found to be partly wrong, and in particular it was found that the B-stars may be hotter than those of type A. The following is the temperature-order of the spectra according to the opinion of the Harvard astronomers.  _Type O_ (WOLF-RAYET stars). The spectra of these stars consist mainly of bright lines. They are characterized by the bright bands at wave-lengths 463 μμ and 469 μμ, and the line at 501 μμ characteristic of gaseous nebulae is sometimes present.  This type embraces mainly stars of relatively small apparent brightness. The brightest is γ Velorum with _m_ = 2.22. We shall find that the absolute magnitude of these stars nearly coincides with that of the stars of type B.  The type is grouped into five subdivisions represented by the letters Oa, Ob, Oc, Od and Oe. These subdivisions are conditioned by the varying intensities of the bright bands named above. The due sequence of these sub-types is for the present an open question.  Among interesting stars of this type is ζ Puppis (Od), in the spectrum of which PICKERING discovered a previously unknown series of helium lines. They were at first attributed (by RYDBERG) to hydrogen and were called “additiona"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22163"],["title","The Rover Boys on the Farm; or, Last Days at Putnam Hall (#1)"],["body","schievously.  \"Now, Tom----\"  \"Oh, I know what you mean, dad, and I'll be as quiet as a mule with a sandbag tied to his tail,\" answered the fun-loving offspring.  The day after Anderson Rover's departure from the farm was quiet enough, but on the morning following the boys' uncle received a letter in the mail which seemed to trouble him not a little.  \"I must attend to this matter without delay,\" said Randolph Rover to his wife.  \"What is wrong, Randolph?\"  \"I don't think I can explain to you, Martha. It's about those traction company bonds I purchased a few months ago.\"  \"Those you paid ten thousand dollars for?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What about them?\"  \"As I said before, I can't explain--it is rather a complicated affair.\"  \"They are yours, aren't they, Randolph?\"  \"Oh, yes. But----\"  \"Aren't they worth what you gave for them?\"  \"I hope so.\"  \"Can't you find out and make sure?\"  \"That is what I am going to do,\" replied Randolph Rover, and heaved a deep sigh. As my old readers know, he was a very retired individual, given to scientific research, especially in regard to farming, and knew little about business.  \"If you've been swindled in any way, you must go after the men who sold you the bonds,\" said Mrs. Rover. \"We cannot afford to lose so much money.\"  \"I don't believe I've been swindled--at least, if I have, I think the party who sold me the bonds will make them good, Martha. I'll know all about it to-morrow,\" answered Randolph Rover, and there the conversation came to an end.     CHAPTER II  WHAT HAPPENED ON THE MOUNTAIN   It was on the day that Randolph Rover was to go to the town of Carwell, fifteen miles away, to see about the bonds, that the three Rover boys planned for a day's outing.  \"Let us go to the top of Chase Mountain,\" suggested Sam. \"I haven't been up there for three years.\"  \"Second the suggestion,\" replied Tom. \"We can take a lunch along and make a day of it,\" and so it was arranged.  Chase Mountain was about three miles away, on the other side of Humpback Falls, where Sam had once had such a stirring adventure, as told in detail in \"The Rover Boys at School.\" It was a ragged eminence, and from the top a view could be had of the country for many miles around.  The day seemed to be a perfect one when the three youths started, and when they reached the top of the mountain they enjoyed the vast panorama spread before them. They likewise enjoyed the substantial lunch their Aunt Martha had provided, and ate until Tom was ready to \"bust his buttons,\" as he expressed it.  \"Let us try a new path down,\" said Sam, when it came time to go home, and he and Tom led the way, over a series of rocky ridges and cliffs anything but easy to traverse. In some places they had to drop ten and fifteen feet, and once Tom came down on his ankle in a manner that made him cry with pain.  \"You look out for yourself,\" warned Dick. \"If you sprain an ankle up here we'll have a job of it getting you home.\"  \"No sprained ankle for mine, thank you,\" replied Tom. And he was more careful after that.  As Dick came after his brothers he saw something peculiar at one side of the path he was pursuing. It appeared to be a tin lunch box suspended from a tree limb by a bit of wire. The box was painted red and seemed to be new.  \"That's strange,\" said the eldest Rover boy to himself. \"Who would leave such a thing as that in that position? I'll have to investigate.\"  Without telling Sam and Tom what he was going to do, Dick left the path and plunged into the bushes which grew between himself and the tree from which the tin box was suspended. Among the bushes the footing was uncertain, and hardly had he taken a dozen steps when he felt himself sinking.  \"Hi! this won't do!\" he cried in alarm, and then plunged down into a big hole, some bushes, moss and dead leaves coming down on top of him.  In the meantime, Sam and Tom had gone on. Coming to where the path appeared to divide, they turned to the right, only to find, five minutes later, that they had made a mistake.  \"Where in the world can Dick be?\" murmured Sam, after he and his brother had called again. \"I thought he was right behind us.\"  \"So did I, Sam. It's mighty queer what's become of him. If he fell over a cliff----\" Tom did not finish, but heaved a deep sigh.  With anxious hearts the two boys endeavored to retrace their steps up the mountainside. They had to climb up one of the cliffs, and just as this was accomplished it began to rain.  \"More bad luck,\" grumbled Sam. \"If this keeps on we'll soon be soaked.\"  \"Spit, spat, spo! Where did that mountain path go!\" cried Tom, repeating a doggerel often used by children. \"Dick! Dick!\" he yelled, at the top of his lungs. Then Sam joined in the call once again. But as before, there was no answer.  It must be confessed that the two Rover boys were now thoroughly alarmed. As they had climbed up the mountainside they knew they must be close to the spot where they had last seen Dick. What had become of their big brother?  \"Tom, do you think he could have fallen over some cliff and rolled to the bottom of the mountain?\" questioned Sam, anxiously.  \"How could he roll to the bottom with the trees so thick? He would have plenty of chance to catch hold of one of them.\"  \"Not if he was knocked unconscious.\"  \"Well, where can he be?\"  \"I don't know.\"  It was now raining steadily, and to protect themselves the two boys pulled their caps well down over their heads and turned up their coat collars. They came to a halt under the wide-spreading branches of a hemlock tree.  \"It beats the nation, that's what it does,\" declared Tom. \"Maybe the earth opened and swallowed him up!\"  \"Tom, this is no joke.\"  \"And I'm not joking, Sam. I can't understand it at all.\"  \"Is that the path over yonder?\" continued the youngest Rover, pointing to a spot beyond the opposite side of the hemlock tree.  \"It looks a little like it,\" was Tom's reply. \"Might as well go over and make sure.\"  Leaving the shelter of the tree, they made their way through the bushes, which were now beginning to drip from the rain. As they progressed Sam pushed a big branch from him and let it swing back suddenly, thereby catching Tom full in the face.  \"Wow!\" spluttered the fun-loving Rover, as he staggered back. \"Hi! Sam, do you think I need a shower bath? I'm wet enough already.\" And Tom commenced to brush the water from his face.  \"I didn't mean to let it slip,\" answered Sam. \"But say----\"  What Sam was going to say further will never be known, for just then he felt himself slipping down into some sort of a hole. He tried to leap back, and made a clutch at Tom's legs, and the next instant both rolled over and over and shot downward, out of the daylight into utter darkness.  They were taken so completely by surprise that neither said a word. Over and over they went, a shower of dirt, sticks and dead leaves coming after them. Then they brought up on a big pile of decayed leaves and lay there, the breath all but knocked out of them.  \"Wha--what--where are we?\" gasped Sam, when he felt able to speak.  \"Say, is thi--this a ne--new shoot-the--the--chutes?\" asked Tom who was bound to have his fun no matter what occurred.  \"Are you hurt?\"  \"I don't think I am, but I reckon my liver turned over about ten times. How about you?\"  \"Shook up, that's all,\" answered Sam, after rising to his feet. \"Say, we came down in a hurry, didn't we?\"  \"Yes, and got no return ticket either.\" Tom looked upward. \"Gracious! the top of this hole is about fifty feet away! We are lucky that we didn't break our necks!\"  \"Now we are down here, the question is, How do we get out, Tom?\"  \"Don't ask me any conundrums.\"  \"We've got to get out somehow.\"  \"Unless we want to stay here and save the expense of a cemetery lot.\"  \"Tom!\"  \"Oh, I know it's no joke, Sam. But what is there to do? Here's a hole at least fifty feet deep and the sides are almost perpendicular. Do you think we can climb up? I am afraid, if we try it, we'll end by breaking our necks.\"  \"It certainly is steep,\" answered the youngest brother, looking upward. \"Say!\" he added, suddenly, \"do you suppose Dick went down in some such hole as this?\"  \"Perhaps; where there is one hole there may be more. If he went down let us hope he didn't get killed.\"  As well as they were able, the two boys gazed around them. The hole was irregular in form, but about fifteen feet in diameter. One side was of rough rocks and the other dirt and tree roots. At the top the treacherous bushes overhung all sides of the opening, partly concealing the yawning pit below.  \"The rain is coming in pretty lively,\" was Sam's comment, presently. \"I wonder if there is any danger of this hole filling up with water.\"  \"I don't think so, but if it does we can swim out.\"  \"Or get drowned.\"  \"Now who is getting blue?\" demanded Tom.  To keep out of the worst of the rain Sam leaned against one of the sides of the hole. He felt it give beneath his weight and before he could save himself he went down into another hole, and Tom came after him.  The boys were scared and both cried out lustily. They did not fall far, however--in fact, they rather rolled, for the second opening was on a slant of forty-five degrees. They brought up against something soft, but this time it was not a bank of decayed leaves.  \"Sam! And Tom!\"  \"Dick!\"  \"Where did you come from?\"  \"How did you get here?\"  \"Are you hurt?\"  \"No, are you?\"  \"No.\"  These were some of the questions asked and answered as the three Rover boys stared at each other. Other questions quickly followed, and Dick told how he had started to get the tin box and gone down so unexpectedly.  \"You want to be careful,\" he cautioned. \"This mountainside is full of holes and pitfalls. I came down one hole and then shot right into another.\"  \"And we did the same thing!\" cried Tom. \"Thank heaven none of us have broken bones!\"  \"Didn't you hear us call to you?\" asked the youngest Rover.  \"I thought I heard something--but I was not sure. I called back.\"  \"We didn't hear you,\" answered Tom. "]]]
