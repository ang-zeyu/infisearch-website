The cable straightened and pulled at the anchor as the _Nancy Bell_ tried to get away from the asteroid.  \"Jules, old bunion,\" he said as he watched the needle of the tension gauge, \"we have set her well.\"  \"Yes, m'lud. So it would appear, m'lud.\"  St. Simon cut the power. \"Very good, Jules. Now we shall see if the beeper is functioning as it should.\" He flipped a switch that turned on the finder pickup, then turned the selector to his own frequency band.  _Beep!_ said the radio importantly. _Beep!_  The explosion had also triggered on a small but powerful transmitter built into the anchor. The tugs would be able to find the planetoid by following the beeps.  \"Ah, Jules! Success!\"  \"Yes, m'lud. Success. For the tenth time in a row, this trip. And how many trips does this make?\"  \"Ah, but who's counting? Think of the money!\"  \"And the monotony, m'lud. To say nothing of molasses, muchness, and other things that begin with an M.\"  \"Quite so, Jules; quite so. Well, let's detach the towing cable and be on our way.\"  \"Whither, m'lud, Vesta?\"  \"I rather thought Pallas this time, old thimble.\"  \"Still, m'lud, Vesta--\"  \"Pallas, Jules.\"  \"Vesta?\"  \"Hum, hi, ho,\" said Captain St. Simon thoughtfully. \"Pallas?\"  The argument continued while the tow cable was detached from the freshly-placed anchor, and while the air was being let back into the control chamber, and while St. Simon divested himself of his suit. Actually, although he would like to go to Vesta, it was out of the question. Energywise and timewise, Pallas was much closer.  He settled back in the bucket seat and shot toward Pallas.         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Edway Tarnhorst was from San Pedro, Greater Los Angeles, California, Earth. He was a businessman of executive rank, and was fairly rich. In his left lapel was the Magistral Knight's Cross of the Sovereign Hierosolymitan Order of Malta, reproduced in miniature. In his wallet was a card identifying him as a Representative of the Constituency of Southern California to the Supreme Congress of the People of the United Nations of Earth. He was just past his fifty-third birthday, and his lean, ascetic face and graying hair gave him a look of saintly wisdom. Aside from the eight-pointed cross in his lapel, the only ornamentation or jewelry he wore consisted of a small, exquisitely thin gold watch on his left wrist, and, on the ring finger of his left hand, a gold signet ring set with a single, flat, unfaceted diamond which was delicately engraved with the Tarnhorst coat of arms. His clothing was quietly but impressively expensive, and under Earth gravity would probably have draped impeccably, but it tended to fluff oddly away from his body under a gee-pull only a twentieth of Earth's.  He sat in his chair with both feet planted firmly on the metal floor, and his hands gripping the armrests as though he were afraid he might float off toward the ceiling if he let go. But only his body betrayed his unease; his face was impassive and calm.  The man sitting next to him looked a great deal more comfortable. This was Mr. Peter Danley, who was twenty years younger than Mr. Tarnhorst and looked it. Instead of the Earth-cut clothing that the older man was wearing, he was wearing the close-fitting tights that were the common dress of the Belt cities. His hair was cropped close, and the fine blond strands made a sort of golden halo about his head when the light from the panels overhead shone on them. His eyes were pale blue, and the lashes and eyebrows were so light as to be almost invisible. That effect, combined with his thin-lined, almost lipless mouth, gave his face a rather expressionless expression. He carried himself like a man who was used to low-gravity or null-gravity conditions, but he talked like an Earthman, not a Belt man. The identification card in his belt explained that; he was a pilot on the Earth-Moon shuttle service. In the eyes of anyone from the Belt cities, he was still an Earthman, not a true spaceman. He was looked upon in the same way that the captain of a transatlantic liner might have looked upon the skipper of the Staten Island ferry two centuries before. The very fact that he was seated in a chair gave away his Earth habits.  The third man was standing, leaning at a slight angle, so that his back touched the wall behind him. He was not tall--five nine--and his face and body were thin. His tanned skin seemed to be stretched tightly over this scanty padding, and in places the bones appeared to be trying to poke their way through to the surface. His ears were small and lay nearly flat against his head, and the hair on his skull was so sparse that the tanned scalp could be easily seen beneath it, although there was no actual bald spot anywhere. Only his large, luminous brown eyes showed that Nature had not skimped on everything when he was formed. His name was lettered neatly on the outside of the door to the office: Georges Alhamid. In spite of the French spelling, he pronounced the name \"George,\" in the English manner.  He had welcomed the two Earthmen into his office, smiling the automatic smile of the diplomat as he welcomed them to Pallas. As soon as they were comfortably seated--though perhaps that word did not exactly apply to Edway Tarnhorst--Georges Alhamid said:  \"Now, gentlemen, what can I do for you?\"  He asked it as though he were completely unaware of what had brought the two men to Pallas.  Tarnhorst looked as though he were privately astonished that his host could speak grammatically. \"Mr. Alhamid,\" he began, \"I don't know whether you're aware that the industrial death rate here in the Belt has been the subject of a great deal of discussion in both industrial and governmental circles on Earth.\" It was a half question, and he let it hang in the air, waiting to see whether he got an answer.  \"Certainly my office has received a great deal of correspondence on the subject,\" Alhamid said. His voice sounded as though Tarnhorst had mentioned nothing more serious than a commercial deal. Important, but nothing to get into a heavy sweat over.  Tarnhorst nodded and then held his head very still. His actions betrayed the fact that he was not used to the messages his semicircular canals were sending his brain when he moved his head under low gee.  \"Exactly,\" he said after a moment's pause. \"I have 'stat copies of a part of that correspondence. To be specific, the correspondence between your office and the Workers' Union Safety Control Board, and between your office and the Workingman's Compensation Insurance Corporation.\"  \"I see. Well, then, you're fully aware of what our trouble is, Mr. Tarnhorst. I'm glad to see that an official of the insurance company is taking an interest in our troubles.\"  Tarnhorst's head twitched, as though he were going to shake his head and had thought better of it a fraction of a second too late. It didn't matter. The fluid in his inner ears sloshed anyway.  \"I am not here in my capacity as an officer of the Workingman's Compensation Insurance Corporation,\" he said carefully. \"I am here as a representative of the People's Congress.\"  Alhamid's face showed a mild surprise which he did not feel. \"I'm honored, of course, Mr. Tarnhorst,\" he said, \"but you must understand that I am not an official of the government of Pallas.\"  Tarnhorst's ascetic face betrayed nothing. \"Since you have no unified government out here,\" he said, \"I cannot, of course, presume to deal with you in a governmental capacity. I have spoken to the Governor of Pallas, however, and he assures me that you are the man to speak to.\"  \"If it's about the industrial death rate,\" Alhamid agreed, \"then he's perfectly correct. But if you're here as a governmental representative of Earth, I don't understand--\"  \"Please, Mr. Alhamid,\" Tarnhorst interrupted with a touch of irritation in his voice. \"This is not my first trip to the Belt, nor my first attempt to deal with the official workings of the Confederated Cities.\"  Alhamid nodded gently. It was, as a matter of fact, Mr. Tarnhorst's second trip beyond the Martian orbit, the first having taken place some three years before. But the complaint was common enough; Earth, with its strong centralized government, simply could not understand the functioning of the Belt Confederacy. A man like Tarnhorst apparently couldn't distinguish between _government_ and _business_. Knowing that, Alhamid could confidently predict what the general sense of Tarnhorst's next sentence would be.  \"I am well aware,\" said Tarnhorst, \"that the Belt Companies not only have the various governors under their collective thumb, but have thus far prevented the formation of any kind of centralized government. Let us not quibble, Mr. Alhamid; the Belt Companies run the Belt, and that means that I must deal with officials of those companies--such as yourself.\"  Alhamid felt it necessary to make a mild speech in rebuttal. \"I cannot agree with you, Mr. Tarnhorst. I have nothing to do with the government of Pallas or any of the other asteroids. I am neither an elected nor an appointed official of any government. Nor, for that matter, am I an advisor in either an official or unofficial capacity to any government. I do not make the laws designed to keep the peace, nor do I enforce them, except in so far as I am a registered voter and therefore have some voice in those laws in that respect. Nor, again, do I serve any judiciary function in any Belt government, except inasmuch as I may be called upon for jury duty.  \"I am a business executive, Mr. Tarnhorst. Nothing more. If you have governmental problems to discuss, then I can't help you, since I'm not authorized to make any decisions for any government.\"  Edway Tarnhorst closed his eyes and massaged the bridge of his thin nose between thumb and forefinger. \"I understand that. I understand that perfectly. But out here, the Companies have taken over certain functions of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23565"],["title","Red-Tape and Pigeon-Hole Generals (#1)"],["body"," CHAPTER XVII.

CHAPTER I.  _The Advent of our General of Division--Camp near Frederick City, Maryland--The Old Revolutionary Barracks at Frederick--An Irish Corporal's Recollections of the First Regiment of Volunteers from Pennsylvania--Punishment in the Old First._   \"Our new Division-General, boys!\" exclaimed a sergeant of the 210th Pennsylvania Volunteers, whose attention and head were turned at the clatter of horses' hoofs to the rear. \"I heard an officer say that he would be along to-day, and I recognise his description.\"  The men, although weary and route-worn, straightened up, dressed their ranks, and as the General and Staff rode past, some enthusiastic soldier proposed cheers for our new Commander. They started with a will, but the General's doubtful look, as interpreted by the men, gave little or no encouragement, and the effort ended in a few ragged discordant yells.  \"He is a strange-looking old covey any how,\" said one of the boys in an undertone. \"Did you notice that red muffler about his neck, and how pinched up and crooked his hat is, and that odd-looking moustache, and how savagely he cocks his eyes through his spectacles?\"  \"They say,\" replied the sergeant, \"that we are the first troops that he has commanded. He was a staff officer before in the Topographical Corps. Didn't you notice the T.C. on his coat buttons?\"  \"And is he going to practise upon us?\" blurts out a bustling red-faced little Irish corporal. \"Be Jabers, that accounts for the crooked cow road we have marched through the last day--miles out of the way, and niver a chance for coffee.\"  \"You are too fast, Terence,\" said the sergeant; \"if he belongs to the Topographical Corps, he ought at least to know the roads.\"  \"And didn't you say not two hours ago that we were entirely out of the way, and that we had been wandering as crooked as the creek that flows back of the old town we are from, and nearly runs through itself in a dozen places?\"  The sergeant admitted that he had said so, but stated that perhaps the General was not to blame, and added somewhat jocosely: \"At any rate the winding of the creek makes those beautiful walks we have so much enjoyed in summer evenings.\"  \"Beautiful winding walks! is it, sergeant! Shure and whin you have your forty pound wait upon your back, forty rounds of lead and powdher in your cartridge-box, and twenty more in your pocket, three days' rations in your haversack, a musket on your shoulder, and army brogans on your throtters, you are just about the first man that I know of to take straight cuts.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was a close warm day near the middle of September. The roads were dusty and the troops exhausted. Two days previously the brigade to which they belonged had left the pleasantest of camps, called \"Camp Whipple\" in honor of their former and favorite Division Commander. Situated in an orchard on the level brow of a hill that overlooked Washington, the imposing Capitol, the broad expanse of the Potomac dotted with frequent craft, the many national buildings, and scenery of historic interest, the men left it with regret, but carried with them recollections that often in times of future depression revived their patriotic ardor.  Over dusty roads, through the muddy aqueduct of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, hurried on over the roughly paved streets of Georgetown, and through the suburbs of Washington, they finally halted for the night, and, as it chanced through lack of orders, for the succeeding day also, near Meridian Hill. Under orders to join the Fifth Army Corps commanded by Major-General Fitz John Porter, to which the Division had been previously assigned, the march was resumed on the succeeding day, which happened to be Sunday, and in the afternoon of which our chapter opens.  A march of another day brought the Brigade to a recent Rebel camp ground. Traces of their occupancy were found not only in their depredations in the neighborhood destructive of railroad bridges, but also in letters and wall-paper envelopes adorned with the lantern-jawed phiz of Jefferson Davis. The latter were sought after with avidity as soon as ranks were broken and tents pitched; the more eagerly perhaps for the reason that during the greater part of their previous month of service they had been frequently within sound of rebel cannon, although but once under their fire. During the previous day, in fact, they had marched to the music of the artillery of South Mountain.  That night awakened lively recollections in the mind of Terence McCarty, our lively little Irish corporal. His duty for the time as corporal of a relief gave him ample opportunity to indulge them. He had belonged to the old First Pennsylvania Regiment of three months men, that a little over a year before, when Maryland was halting between loyalty and disloyalty, had spent its happiest week of service in the yard of the revolutionary barracks in the city of Frederick. Terence was but two short miles from the spot. Brimfull of the memories, he turned to a comrade, who had also belonged to the First, and who with others chanced to stand near.  \"I say, Jack! Do you recollect the ould First and Frederick, and do you know that we are but two miles and short ones at that from the blissed ould white-washed barracks, full of all kind of quare guns and canteens looking like barrels cut down; and the Parade Ground where our ould Colonel used to come his 'Briskly, men! Briskly,' when he'd put us through the manual, and where so many ladies would come to see our ivolutions, and where they set the big table for us on the Fourth, and where--\"  \"Hold on, corporal! you can't give that week's history to-night.\"  \"I was only going to obsarve, Jack, that I feel like a badly used man.\"  \"How so, Terence?\"  \"Why you see nearly ivery officer, commissioned and non-commissioned, of the ould First has been promoted. The Colonel was too ould for service, or my head on it, he would have had a star. Just look at the captains by way of sample--Company A, a Lieutenant-Colonel, expecting and desarving an eagle ivery day; Company B, a Lieutenant-Colonel; Company C, our own Lieutenant-Colonel; Company D, a Brigadier for soldierly looks, daring, and dash; Company E, a Captain in an aisy berth in the regular service; Company F, a Colonel; Company G, a Major; Company H, a Lieutenant-Colonel; Company I, I have lost sight of, and the lion-hearted captain of Company K, doing a lion's share of work at the head of a regiment in Tennessee. Now, Jack, the under officers and many privates run pretty much the same way, but not quite as high. Bad luck to me, I was fifth corporal thin and am eighth now--promoted crab-fashion. Fortune's wheel gives me many a turn, Jack! but always stops with me on the lower side.\"  \"I saw you on the upper side once,\" retorted Jack roguishly.  \"And whin? may I ask.\"  \"When, do you say? why, when you took about half a canteen too much, and that same old colonel had you tied on the upper side of a barrel on the green in front of the barracks.\"  \"Bad luck to an ill-natured memory, Jack, for stirring that up,\" replied the corporal, breaking in upon the laughter that followed, \"but I now recollect, it was the day before you slipped the guard whin the colonel gave you a barrel uniform with your head through the end, and kept me for two mortal long hours in the hot sun, a tickling of you under the nose with a straw, and daubing molasses on your chaps to plaze the flies, to the great admiration of a big crowd of ladies and gentlemen.\"  Jack subsided, and the hearty laughter at the corporal's ready retort was broken a few minutes later by a loud call for the corporal of the guard, which hurried Terence away, dispersed the crowd, and might as well end this chapter.
