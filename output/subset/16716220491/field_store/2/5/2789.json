There was dense fog, however, and nothing could be seen.  He made no report of it at the time.  Why, whatever is the matter with Mr. Holmes?\"  My friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon his face, staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the tunnel.  Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points.  On these his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen, alert face that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils, and concentration of the heavy, tufted brows which I knew so well.  \"Points,\" he muttered; \"the points.\"  \"What of it?  What do you mean?\"  \"I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as this?\"  \"No; they are very few.\"  \"And a curve, too.  Points, and a curve.  By Jove! if it were only so.\"  \"What is it, Mr. Holmes?  Have you a clue?\"  \"An idea--an indication, no more.  But the case certainly grows in interest.  Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not?  I do not see any indications of bleeding on the line.\"  \"There were hardly any.\"  \"But I understand that there was a considerable wound.\"  \"The bone was crushed, but there was no great external injury.\"  \"And yet one would have expected some bleeding.  Would it be possible for me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the thud of a fall in the fog?\"  \"I fear not, Mr. Holmes.  The train has been broken up before now, and the carriages redistributed.\"  \"I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,\" said Lestrade, \"that every carriage has been carefully examined.  I saw to it myself.\"  It was one of my friend's most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient with less alert intelligences than his own.  \"Very likely,\" said he, turning away.  \"As it happens, it was not the carriages which I desired to examine.  Watson, we have done all we can here.  We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade.  I think our investigations must now carry us to Woolwich.\"  At London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he handed to me before dispatching it.  It ran thus:  See some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out. Meanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street, a complete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to be in England, with full address.  Sherlock.  \"That should be helpful, Watson,\" he remarked as we took our seats in the Woolwich train.  \"We certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for having introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable case.\"  His eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung energy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had opened up a stimulating line of thought.  See the foxhound with hanging ears and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels, and compare it with the same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it runs upon a breast-high scent--such was the change in Holmes since the morning.  He was a different man from the limp and lounging figure in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled so restlessly only a few hours before round the fog-girt room.  \"There is material here.  There is scope,\" said he.  \"I am dull indeed not to have understood its possibilities.\"  \"Even now they are dark to me.\"  \"The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead us far.  The man met his death elsewhere, and his body was on the ROOF of a carriage.\"  \"On the roof!\"  \"Remarkable, is it not?  But consider the facts.  Is it a coincidence that it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as it comes round on the points?  Is not that the place where an object upon the roof might be expected to fall off?  The points would affect no object inside the train.  Either the body fell from the roof, or a very curious coincidence has occurred.  But now consider the question of the blood.  Of course, there was no bleeding on the line if the body had bled elsewhere.  Each fact is suggestive in itself.  Together they have a cumulative force.\"  \"And the ticket, too!\" I cried.  \"Exactly.  We could not explain the absence of a ticket.  This would explain it.  Everything fits together.\"  \"But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling the mystery of his death.  Indeed, it becomes not simpler but stranger.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Holmes, thoughtfully, \"perhaps.\"  He relapsed into a silent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in Woolwich Station.  There he called a cab and drew Mycroft's paper from his pocket.  \"We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,\" said he.  \"I think that Sir James Walter claims our first attention.\"  The house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns stretching down to the Thames.  As we reached it the fog was lifting, and a thin, watery sunshine was breaking through.  A butler answered our ring.  \"Sir James, sir!\" said he with solemn face.  \"Sir James died this morning.\"  \"Good heavens!\" cried Holmes in amazement.  \"How did he die?\"  \"Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel Valentine?\"  \"Yes, we had best do so.\"  We were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room, where an instant later we were joined by a very tall, handsome, light-beared man of fifty, the younger brother of the dead scientist.  His wild eyes, stained cheeks, and unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the household.  He was hardly articulate as he spoke of it.  \"It was this horrible scandal,\" said he.  \"My brother, Sir James, was a man of very sensitive honour, and he could not survive such an affair. It broke his heart.  He was always so proud of the efficiency of his department, and this was a crushing blow.\"  \"We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would have helped us to clear the matter up.\"  \"I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to all of us.  He had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the police.  Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was guilty.  But all the rest was inconceivable.\"  \"You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?\"  \"I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard.  I have no desire to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that we are much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this interview to an end.\"  \"This is indeed an unexpected development,\" said my friend when we had regained the cab.  \"I wonder if the death was natural, or whether the poor old fellow killed himself!  If the latter, may it be taken as some sign of self-reproach for duty neglected?  We must leave that question to the future.  Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.\"  A small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the bereaved mother.  The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any use to us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady, who introduced herself as Miss Violet Westbury, the fiancee of the dead man, and the last to see him upon that fatal night.  \"I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,\" she said.  \"I have not shut an eye since the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what the true meaning of it can be.  Arthur was the most single-minded, chivalrous, patriotic man upon earth.  He would have cut his right hand off before he would sell a State secret confided to his keeping.  It is absurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him.\"  \"But the facts, Miss Westbury?\"  \"Yes, yes; I admit I cannot explain them.\"  \"Was he in any want of money?\"  \"No; his needs were very simple and his salary ample.  He had saved a few hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year.\"  \"No signs of any mental excitement?  Come, Miss Westbury, be absolutely frank with us.\"  The quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner.  She coloured and hesitated.  \"Yes,\" she said at last, \"I had a feeling that there was something on his mind.\"  \"For long?\"  \"Only for the last week or so.  He was thoughtful and worried. Once I pressed him about it.  He admitted that there was something, and that it was concerned with his official life.  'It is too serious for me to speak about, even to you,' said he.  I could get nothing more.\"  Holmes looked grave.  \"Go on, Miss Westbury.  Even if it seems to tell against him, go on. We cannot say what it may lead to.\"  \"Indeed, I have nothing more to tell.  Once or twice it seemed to me that he was on the point of telling me something.  He spoke one evening of the importance of the secret, and I have some recollection that he said that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.\"  My friend's face grew graver still.  \"Anything else?\"  \"He said that we were slack about such matters--that it would be easy for a traitor to get the plans.\"  \"Was it only recently that he made such remarks?\"  \"Yes, quite recently.\"  \"Now tell us of that last evening.\"  \"We were to go to the theatre.  The fog was so thick that a cab was useless.  We walked, and our way took us close to the office. Suddenly he darted away into the fog.\"  \"Without a word?\"  \"He gave an exclamation; that was all.  I waited but he never returned. Then I walked home.  Next morning, after the office opened, they came to inquire.  About twelve o'clock we heard the terrible news.  Oh, Mr. Holmes, if you could only, only save his honour!  It was so much to him.\"  Holmes shook his head sadly.  \"Come, Watson,\" said he, \"our ways lie elsewhere.  Our next station must be the office from which the papers were taken.  \"It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries make it blacker,\" he remarked as the cab lumbered off. \"His coming marriage gives a motive for the crime.  He naturally wanted money.  The idea was in his head, since he spoke about it. He nearly made the girl an accomplice in the treason by telling her his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23462"],["title","More Russian Picture Tales (#1)"],["body",", it's all right. Only I'm not very fat yet, so you'd better begin on my tail, and meanwhile I'll be munching some more grass and get a little fuller.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  So the wolf went up to him from behind, and was just going to get to work on his tail, when the horse let out at him as hard as he could! And the wolf rolled over, while the horse ran off.  And there sat the wolf, and he thought: \"Well, wasn't I a fool! wasn't I a noodle! Who ever heard of anyone starting to eat a horse by the tail?\"  [Illustration]  And so he wandered on further, when after a bit he saw a pig coming towards him, so when he got to him he said: \"Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, I'm going to eat you!\" But the pig answered: \"Who are you, I should like to know, that you mean to eat me?\" \"I'm a wolf.\" \"You're a queer sort of wolf,\" answered the pig, \"you're only a dog!\" \"No, I'm not a dog,\" said he, \"I'm a wolf!\" \"Oh, that's all right then,\" answered the pig, \"you just sit down on my back. I'll give you a ride, and then you can eat me.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  So the wolf sat down on the pig's back, when lo and behold! the pig carried him straight into the village.  [Illustration]  And all the dogs ran out, made a dash for the wolf, and began to tease him. And they teased him so much, it was all he could do to tear himself away and run off back into the forest.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration: Guess how old I am!]     THE PEASANT AND THE BEAR.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]   Once upon a time a certain peasant lost his wife, then he lost his other relations, and then he was left alone with no one to help him in his home or his fields. So he went to Bruin and said: \"Look here, Bruin, let's keep house and plant our garden and sow our corn together.\" And Bruin asked: \"But how shall we divide it afterwards?\" \"How shall we divide it?\" said the peasant, \"Well, you take all the tops and let me have all the roots.\" \"All right,\" answered Bruin. So they sowed some turnips, and they grew beautifully. And Bruin worked hard, and gathered in all the turnips, and then they began to divide them. And the peasant said: \"The tops are yours, aren't they, Bruin?\" \"Yes,\" he answered. So the peasant cut off all the turnip tops and gave them to Bruin, and then sat down to count the roots. And Bruin saw that the peasant had done him down.  [Illustration]  And he got huffy, lay down in his den, and started sucking his paws.  [Illustration]  The next spring the peasant again came to see him, and said: \"Look here, Bruin, let's work together again, shall we?\" And Bruin answered: \"Right-ho! only this time mind! you can have the tops, but I'm going to have the roots!\" \"Very well,\" said the peasant. And they sowed some wheat, and when the ears grew up and ripened, you never saw such a sight. Then they began to divide it, and the peasant took all the tops with the grain, and gave Bruin the straw and the roots. So he didn't get anything that time either.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And Bruin said to the peasant: \"Well, good-bye! I'm not going to work with you any more, you're too crafty!\" And with that he went off into the forest.  [Illustration]     THE DOG AND THE COCK  [Illustration]   One summer a certain peasant's crops failed him, and so he had no food to give to his animals, which were a cock and a dog. And the dog said to the cock: \"Well, brother Peeter, I think we should get more to eat if we went and lived in the forest than here at our master's, don't you?\" \"That's a fact,\" answered the cock, \"let's be off, there's no help for it.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  So they said good-bye to their master and mistress and went off to see what they could find. And they went on and on, and couldn't find a nice place to stop. Then it began to grow dark, and the cock said: \"Let's spend the night on a tree. I'll fly up on to a branch, and you take shelter in the hollow. We'll get through the night somehow.\"  [Illustration]  So the cock made his way on to a branch, tucked in his toes, and went to sleep, while the dog made himself a bed in the hollow of the tree. And they slept soundly the whole night through, and towards morning, when it began to get light, the cock woke up and, as was his custom, crew as loud as he could: \"Cock-a-doodle-doo! cock-a-doodle-do! all wake up! all get up! the sun will soon be rising, and the day will soon begin!\"  [Illustration]  And he crew so loud, that a fox in a hole near by was up in an instant thinking: \"What a funny thing for a cock to be crowing in the forest! I expect he's lost his way and can't get out again!\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And he began to look for the cock, and after a bit he saw him sitting upon the branch of the tree. \"Oho!\" thought the fox, \"he'd make a fine meal! How can I get him to come down from there?\"  [Illustration]  So he went up to the tree and said to the cock: \"What a splendid cock you are! I've never seen such a fine one all my days! What lovely feathers, just as if they were covered with gold! And your tail! nobody could describe it in words or on paper, it's so beautiful! And what a sweet voice you've got! I could listen to it all day and all night. Do fly down a little closer and let's get to know each other a little better. That reminds me, I've got a christening on at my place to-day, and I shall have plenty of food and drink to offer such a welcome guest. Let's go along to my home.\"  [Illustration]  \"Right you are,\" answered the cock, \"I'll certainly come, only you must ask my companion too. We always go about together.\" \"And where is your companion?\" asked the fox. \"Down below in the tree hollow,\" answered the cock. And the fox poked his head into the hole, thinking there was another cock there, when the dog popped his head out and caught Mr. Fox by the nose!  [Illustration]     KING FROST.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]   Once upon a time there lived an old man and his wife. She had one daughter of her own, and he had one of _his_ own. And the old woman took a dislike to her step-daughter. Whatever her own daughter did, she praised her for everything and stroked her head, but whatever her step-daughter did, she grumbled at her and scolded her for everything; it was simply dreadful. And the old woman began to want to drive her step-daughter off the face of the earth, and she said to her husband: \"Take her away into the dark forest, and let the frost freeze her to death.\" So there was nothing for the old man to do but harness his horse to the sledge, put his daughter in it, and drive her off into the forest. And he brought her right into the middle of the forest, set her down on the snow, and drove off home.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And there the little girl sat in the forest all alone, shivering with the cold. When lo and behold! there was old King Frost coming towards her, and he said: \"Hullo, little girl, are you warm?\" And she answered: \"Yes, King Frost.\" Then he blew a cold breath on to her and again asked: \"Are you warm, little girl?\" And she answered: \"Yes, King Frost!\" Then he began to make it still colder; he made the branches crack, and covered them with hoar-frost, and let loose such cold, that you could hear the air creaking.  [Illustration]  Then he asked her again: \"Well, little girl, are you warm now?\" And she answered: \"Yes, King Frost!\" And when he saw that she was a good girl, he felt sorry for her. So he put on her a fur coat, with trimmings of beaver, and made her warm, and said to her: \"You're a good girl, and so I'll stop. Here's a little present for you from King Frost.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And he brought her a trunk full of all sorts of things, silver and gold, and bright-coloured stones.  [Illustration]  Meanwhile her step-mother was saying to the old man at home: \"I expect your daughter's frozen by now. Go into the forest and bring her back.\" So he harnessed his horse to the sledge, and set out to fetch his daughter.  [Illustration]  Then his wife began to watch at the window, and at last she saw her husband driving towards home, and she said to herself: \"That's all right, there come the old man's daughter's bones back in the sledge.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  But the doggie outside said: \"Bow, wow, bow-wow-wow! The old man's bringing his daughter home. She's blooming like the poppy-bloom, and she's got a fine present, and a new coat with a beaver collar!\" And lo and behold! it was true; the old man drove up with his daughter alive and well, in her fine clothes and with her presents. \"Well,\" thought her step-mother, \"if King Frost has given all those things to the old man's daughter, he'll give my pretty girl ever so much more.\" And she said to her husband: \"Take my daughter to the same place as quick as you can, and let King Frost give her a share too!\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  So the old man took her daughter, left her in the forest, and then drove off home. And there the girl sat, with her teeth chattering with the cold, when lo and behold! there was King Frost coming along, and he said: \"Hullo, little girl, are you warm?\" And she answered: \"What's that got to do with you? Go away to where you came from!\" And King Frost grew angry and blew a cold breath on to the girl, and then asked her: \"Are you warm, little girl?\" And she answered: \"Fancy asking! You can see I'm frozen! Be quick and give me the presents, and then get away to your home.\" Then King Frost began to make the girl still colder. And he kept making it colder and colder till he had frozen her through and through.  [Illustration]  Meanwhile her mother was saying to the old man at home: \"Go into the forest now, and bring back my daughter. And mind, don't forget to take the trunk and the fine clothes as well.\" So the old man started off, and his wife began to watch at the window.  She waited and waited, and at last she saw her husband driving towards home, and said to herself: \"That's all right, there comes the old "]]]
