Now that he had told the lie he would stay by it. He pointed to a big double tooth and resolved that he would remember it.  The superintendent looked at the tooth and at the boy.  \"Perhaps you don't know how much that tooth is worth?\"  \"No, sir,\" agreed Glen.  \"A very conservative price is a hundred dollars, at your age. You wouldn't throw a hundred dollars away.\"  \"No, sir; but I want it pulled.\"  It was all very well to talk of a hundred dollars, but when Glen had his mind set on a matter he would make any sacrifice.  \"Well, you must not have it pulled. But have the dentist look at it. I will give you a pass for this afternoon. You will wear your uniform, walk to the car line and take the street car to the dentist's office. Let me ask you one thing, Glen. Don't forget to come back.\"  It was as if the superintendent read his thoughts. Glen changed color and looked foolish. He could think of only one thing to say. \"At what time, sir?\"  \"You will be in by six o'clock. As you go to town and see the boys at liberty on the streets remember that if you keep up your good behavior you may soon be paroled and be as free as they. All you have to do, Glen, is to keep it up.\"  As he went to put on his uniform, the hated uniform that made it so hard for him to lose himself in the crowd, Glen realized better how it was that Nixon and some of the others who had been given liberty in town had never violated their trust. It seemed abominably mean and small to go back on a man like this. He actually began to have his own doubts. But it was very hard for Glen Mason to give up anything on which he had set his heart.  There were several things went wrong which were quite disturbing. In the first place he was obliged to change his clothing under the eye of the physical director which utterly spoiled any scheme of hiding a suit of overalls under his uniform. The walk to the street car and the ride to the doctor's office would have been very enjoyable had not every one stared at him and his uniform. More than once he heard some one say \"There goes a reform school boy.\" Then the dentist did all manner of things in his efforts to find the nonexistent aching tooth. Finally he did find an area of tenderness in an entirely different tooth to the one specified.  \"Does this tooth hurt you more than the others!\" he asked.  \"It does,\" Glen agreed, quite truthfully, an involuntary \"Ouch\" following his words.  \"I thought as much,\" the doctor observed. \"It is often hard to locate the pain definitely. The nerve reflexes are responsible for it. I will now drill into this and see what we find.\"  \"Do you have to drill?\" asked Glen.  \"Surely. Have to clean out all the old decayed tooth before I fill it. I often give the boys from the school a little sermon by telling them the bad has to be cleaned out before you get sound living.\"  \"Make it as easy as you can,\" Glen requested.  \"Yes, of course. But cleaning out decay often hurts.\"  It did hurt but Glen would have fainted rather than make an outcry.  The doctor stepped to the 'phone and called up the superintendent.  \"It's all right with the Mason boy,\" he said. \"I've done all I can to-day for him. I'm leaving now. What shall he do until time for his car.\"  He turned to Glen as he received a reply.  \"You are to wait until five o'clock in my reception room and then take the inter-urban car,\" he said, locking the inner office when they passed out. \"I am leaving a little early to-night.\"  Before he left he stepped into a little closet which led out of the reception room and changed his office clothes. Glen's eyes sparkled. His problem was solved.  At five o'clock Glen Mason rode down in the elevator to the ground floor and asked the elevator man how he could identify the inter-urban car. But instead of leaving the building he dodged back to the stairway as soon as the elevator had started on its return trip and ran stealthily up the stairs and again entered the dentist's reception room. It was empty. Glen boldly entered the little closet and dressing himself in the dentist's office clothes made a bundle of his uniform. The closet was both deep and high. He climbed to the top shelf and shoved his bundle far back over its wide surface against the wall. He dared not risk going out in the doctor's clothing in daylight. He must stay until the building was deserted and use the fire escape. His great fear was lest some one should come to the reception room. The only safeguard was concealment in the hot, dark closet. He waited hours without any disturbance. He felt sure that it must be almost midnight. Stealthily he opened the door of the closet and stepped to a window. It was still daylight, though the sun was setting. He returned to his closet.  It must have been some hours afterward that he heard footsteps and voices outside the door. In sudden desperation he climbed up and lay flat on the wide shelf where he had hidden the uniform. Someone opened the door of the closet, glanced inside and shut it again.  \"I tell you I took him down about five o'clock and showed him his car. He ain't here,\" said the voice of the elevator man.  \"I have to make sure,\" replied his companion.  Glen knew the voice for that of one of the school officials. So already they were seeking him!  After all was quiet Glen ventured to open the closet door and peep out. It was dark now but there were lights in the hall. After a long time they were extinguished and the building seemed deserted. The last late worker departed. The elevator ceased its rhythmic motion.  Glen waited yet longer for a time and then crept down the hall to the fire-escape, which he made out by a red light. It was a dark night, but, nerved to the act, he made no hesitation as he swung himself out on to the iron bars. It was an old-fashioned escape, bars at wide intervals so close to the wall as to leave hardly a toe hold. Down, down he went, not daring to look to see where he was going but clinging fast and letting one step follow another. Then suddenly the ladder stopped. Feel as he would, in this direction or in that, there were no more steps. He had known of fire-escapes ending ten or twelve feet from the ground with an extension which might be lowered. But he found no extension. He looked down, but it was black night and he could see nothing but shadowy outlines. Looking up, the ladder soon disappeared in the darkness. There was no sense in mounting again. He let down his legs as far as he could reach, with his body balanced on his elbows, then he let himself hang by his hands and kicked out in the hope of finding some landing. There was nothing to be felt but the brick wall. His arms grew tired as he swung. His efforts to draw up again were ineffectual. In desperation he swung off into space.  Splash! He was choking and gasping in water!     CHAPTER II  A FRIEND AND A FOE   Splashing about in his watery quarters Glen speedily discovered that he had fallen into an enormous rain barrel. He was able to reach the top with his hands, and lost no time in drawing himself up and crawling over the side. Then he stood in the shelter of the barrel and wrung a gallon or so of water out of the doctor's clothes. When the job was finished he had pretty well destroyed the identity of that suit of clothing. The draggled, wrinkled and stained garments bore no resemblance to the neat office suit. His mishap had given material help in effecting a disguise.  He struck out away from the town and met no one to interfere with him as he walked along the quiet residence streets. Just at the edge of the city he was attracted by a great illumination. It was the electric lighting of a park, which even at that hour was thronged with visitors. The boy who had been shut up for a year and more looked hungrily through the great entrance way. It was free to all. He walked cautiously in, keeping a suspicious eye wide for policemen; for though he thought he was free he was in bondage to his guilty conscience.  Of the many attractions the one which made the greatest appeal to Glen--and the only one he could afford, for his sole fortune was the nickel he had for car-fare--was the merry-go-round with its gaudy horses and its gurdy tunes. He bought a ticket and mounted one of the turbulent steeds with a little thrill of anticipatory pleasure. The music began, the movement gradually quickened, and he was just giving himself up to the pleasure of it when he saw working toward him, on the inside running-board, a man collecting tickets. On his coat was the nickeled badge of a constable. Glen did not know that he was a special officer for the sole purpose of protecting his own outfit against rowdies. In his eyes it was the approach of the law. Although they were now swinging round at a good rate he slipped from his horse and jumped, at peril of his neck. The sight of an official badge struck terror to his soul.  So it was wherever he went. He saw in every man an officer. One might have supposed the park policed by an army. He had just dodged one of the two real park policemen when he overheard a momentous conversation.  A man from the bathhouse came by.  \"Anything doing, Jake?\" he asked the officer.  \"Nothing much,\" replied the policeman. \"They 'phoned us a boy got away from the reform school. They think he might just have come out to the park for fun and overstayed. Ain't seen any one, have ye?\"  \"Not me.\"  \"Well, if he's in here we'll get him as he goes out. I'll watch one gate and Barney the other.\"  So they were on the look out for him. But there was nothing in his present clothing to suggest the reform school boy, and though he was hatless there were numbers of hatless boys in the park. There were many people of all kinds, in fact, and if he went with the crowd, he could surely slip out unnoticed. Yet he feared to attempt to pass the representative of the law at the gate. How conscience doth make cowards of us all!  It was a good deed, done"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22644"],["title","The Boy Scout Treasure Hunters; Or, The Lost Treasure of Buffalo Hollow (#2)"],["body","lsively, that solved Glen's problem. An automobile was passing. The occupants were all watching the bathers in the lake, excepting a little chap of three who had seized the opportunity to climb over the door with the evident idea of jumping to the ground. When Glen saw him he was poised on the running board ready for his jump. Like a flash Glen jumped for the footboard of the moving car and interposed his body as an obstacle to the little fellow's leap. The women in the car screamed and the man who was driving stopped his car in surprise at the intrusion. It was only when Glen hauled the little boy up to view that they saw what he had done.  \"I am Jonathan Gates,\" said the man, offering Glen his hand, \"and this is my wife and daughter. We don't know how to thank you for saving that little scamp from harm.\"  \"We might at least take you back into town,\" suggested Mrs. Gates.  \"But I am going west, into the country,\" said Glen.  \"That is still better,\" said Mr. Gates. \"We live eight miles west of here and will take you wherever you say.\"  \"I'll go just as far as you go,\" Glen replied. \"I live away out west and am on my way on foot. Every mile is a help.\"  They passed through the gates without any notice from the officer who was watching for an escaped Reform School boy, and Glen felt safe again.  \"We have not visited the park in a long while,\" explained Mrs. Gates, \"and it was all new to us. That is why we lost sight of Jack. He was very anxious to run back and see the monkeys again.\"  \"I have never been there before at all,\" said Glen. \"And I am glad I saw this monkey. I was passing and I just went in by chance.\"  \"Not chance,\" said Mr. Gates. \"Let us say Providence. Our boy might have been badly hurt or even killed. Certainly you were led by Providence, or I would rather be more definite and say the hand of God.\"  \"Oh I don't know. I guess not,\" stammered Glen, greatly embarrassed. He wondered what Mr. Gates would say if he knew that he came to the park in running away from the reform school. He had not yet learned that the power of God may even overrule our evil for good. But he was quite willing to agree that his good fortune in meeting the Gates family might be God's providence.  He felt his good fortune still more when Mrs. Gates insisted that he must stay with them at least one night. He yielded, thinking that he would get up very early and slip away before they were astir in the morning. But the excitement of the day had such an effect that he overslept and did not waken until called to breakfast.  The effect of this family was something such as Glen had never known. All they knew of him was his name, but they took him at his word. They accepted his statements without a question--a most unusual thing in his experience. They showed him every kindness. At breakfast Mr. Gates heaped his plate with good things. They were so cordial in their invitation to stay and rest for awhile that he could not refuse them. They showed to him such a spirit of love as made him feel that, after all, Christian people were different from others, and to begin to be sorry that he had taken advantage of the good, old superintendent. They planted in his softened heart seeds of kindness and love which were bound to blossom.  Glen stayed two days, and might have remained longer, but on the morning of the third day, coming down early, he picked up the day-old paper which Mr. Gates had been reading. It was folded back at a place which told of his disappearance from the reform school. He was ashamed to look again in their faces, so he stole out the back way, passed through the barn, and thus made his way out into the dusty road.  His thoughts, as he trudged along, were far from cheerful. Although he had strong, boyish desires to fare forth into the world alone, he much disliked to leave this cheery home. Had he been a clean, honorable boy with a good record he might have stayed there and learned to be a man.  His gloomy thoughts were diverted by the sight of a man who seemed to be having troubles of his own. He was down at the side of an automobile, perspiring freely and vexed with the whole world as he unsuccessfully labored at changing a tire. The automobile was no ordinary car. It had a driver's seat in front and a closed car behind like the closed delivery wagons Glen had seen in town. Bright colored letters announced to the world that J. Jervice supplied the public with a full line of novelties, including rugs, curtains, rare laces and Jervice's Live Stock Condition Powders.  \"Can I help you,\" volunteered Glen. It is worthy of note that the service was freely offered before the man spoke so much as a word. It had not been Glen's habit to volunteer help. He was feeling the influence of the home he had just left.  The offer was not kindly received. The man's reply was so churlish as to leave open the suspicion that he was not naturally a man of pleasant ways.  \"Garn away f'm here,\" he snarled. \"I don't need no boys spyin' around my car.\"  \"Who's spyin'?\" asked Glen defiantly. \"You seem to need somebody pretty bad. You ain't man enough to strip that tire off.\"  \"Nor nobody else wouldn't be,\" declared the man. \"Leastways nobody with jest one pair of hands. While I pry it off one end it slips back on the other. Are you strong?\" he asked, stopping to look at Glen.  \"I'm pretty stout for my age,\" admitted Glen, modestly, \"but I don't want to help nor spy, if you don't want me.\"  \"I could use another pair of hands,\" the peddler admitted. \"I can't pay you nothing for it, though, unless it be a ride to town.\"  \"That is just what I want,\" agreed Glen. \"It's a bargain.\"  The perspiration of Mr. J. Jervice had not been without occasion. The tire he was trying to change had done good service--it was, in fact, the very first tire that wheel had ever carried. Perhaps it cherished fond hopes of remaining in service as long as the wheel to which it clung--at least it resisted most strenuously all efforts to detach it. Both Glen and the man were moist with their efforts before it came away, and they accumulated still more dirt and moisture in applying its successor. But at last it was all done, and Glen had already mounted to the seat, while his companion was putting away his tools, when a cart drove up alongside and Glen recognized in the driver, Mr. Gates.  \"What's the matter?\" he asked, as Mr. Gates pulled up his horse.  \"What's the matter?\" echoed Mr. J. Jervice; \"this boy been doing anything?\"  It was not an unnatural question for there was something in Mr. Gates's look and in Glen's questioning tone that betokened affairs out of the ordinary; furthermore, Mr. J. Jervice seemed to be so suspicious of people in general that one might well think he had something to conceal.  \"The boy's all right,\" replied Mr. Gates. \"I have something to say to him, that's all. If he will come over here we will drive on a few feet while I say it.\"  Glen's thoughts flew back to the folded newspaper and he was instantly suspicious.  \"I don't want to get down,\" he said. \"This gentleman's agreed to give me a ride to town and I don't want to keep him.\"  \"But I want you to stay,\" replied Mr. Gates. \"I will take you to town if you wish, but first I want you to go back home with me and I will tell you something important.\"  Glen felt one of his old, unrestrained passions rising within him.  \"I know what you want,\" he cried. \"I saw the newspaper. You want to send me back to the reform school.\"  \"I want to help you make a man of yourself,\" asserted Mr. Gates, unmoved by the boy's passion. \"It's true I want you to go back to the school, but I will go with you and speak for you. You must go back because it is the only right way out. Let me tell you, Glen, you will never get over a trouble by running away from it. The manly and Christian thing to do is to go back. And that is why I want you to do it.\"  \"And of course you don't want the reward of ten dollars that's always paid for returning a boy. You wouldn't take the money, would you?\"  If the eyes of Mr. Gates were saddened by this mean sneer those of Mr. J. Jervice were not. They lightened with a sudden interest, and he jumped into the battle for the first time.  \"This boy's a goin' with me,\" he told Mr. Gates. \"He's earned a ride and I promised it and I'm a man of my word. You be off, now, and leave him alone.\"  \"You are spoiling his best chance,\" said Mr. Gates. \"I am not interested in the school or the reward. I am simply trying to do my duty to the boy.\"  \"Well, you've done it,\" cried Mr. J. Jervice, as his car gathered headway. \"Good-by to ye.\"  He turned to Glen as the car got into its speed.  \"So you've run away from the reform school, eh? And he was goin' to make ten dollars taking you back?\"  \"Oh, he didn't want the ten dollars,\" said Glen, his rage all gone. \"He treated me awful fine while I was at his house. I just said that because I was mad. But he can't get me to go back; nor nobody else unless they tie me up first.\"  \"I don't know?\" said Mr. J. Jervice. \"Ten dollars is pretty near a week's pay for most men.\"  \"That wouldn't make any difference with him,\" said Glen. \"He's straight as a string.\"  Mr. Gates would have been gratified to know how deep an impression his Christian character had made on this boy who had flouted his kindness.  Mr. J. Jervice was not inclined to conversation--he was puzzling over a problem something akin to that of the fox and the geese (he to be the fox). So they drove along in comparative silence until, topping a hill, Glen exclaimed at the sight of the buildings of a large town.  \"Are we almost there?\" he asked.  \"About three miles yet,\" said Mr. J. Jervice. \"What you going to do when we get there?\"  \"I'm not sure, but I think I'd better leave you before we get to town. I don't believe Mr. Gates would telephone the police but somebody else might.\"  \"You can ride with me a couple o' miles yet. Tell ye what ye can do. S'pose'n you get inside. There's lots o' room and there's a"]]]
