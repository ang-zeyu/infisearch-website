For five years she had heard \"'Twas the night before Christmas,\" and hung up a scarlet stocking many sizes too large for her, and pinned a sprig of holly on her little white nightgown, to show Santa Claus that she was a \"truly\" Christmas child, and dreamed of fur-coated saints and toy-packs and reindeer, and wished everybody a \"Merry Christmas\" before it was light in the morning, and lent every one of her new toys to the neighbors' children before noon, and eaten turkey and plum-pudding, and gone to bed at night in a trance of happiness at the day's pleasures.  Donald was away at college now. Paul and Hugh were great manly fellows, taller than their mother. Papa Bird had gray hairs in his whiskers; and Grandma, God bless her, had been four Christmases in heaven.  But Christmas in the Birds' Nest was scarcely as merry now as it used to be in the bygone years, for the little child, that once brought such an added blessing to the day, lay month after month a patient, helpless invalid, in the room where she was born. She had never been very strong in body, and it was with a pang of terror her mother and father noticed, soon after she was five years old, that she began to limp, ever so slightly; to complain too often of weariness, and to nestle close to her mother, saying she \"would rather not go out to play, please.\" The illness was slight at first, and hope was always stirring in Mrs. Bird's heart. \"Carol would feel stronger in the summer-time;\" or, \"She would be better when she had spent a year in the country;\" or, \"She would outgrow it;\" or, \"They would try a new physician;\" but by and by it came to be all too sure that no physician save One could make Carol strong again, and that no \"summer-time\" nor \"country air,\" unless it were the everlasting summer-time in a heavenly country, could bring back the little girl to health.  The cheeks and lips that were once as red as holly-berries faded to faint pink; the star-like eyes grew softer, for they often gleamed through tears; and the gay child-laugh, that had been like a chime of Christmas bells, gave place to a smile so lovely, so touching, so tender and patient, that it filled every corner of the house with a gentle radiance that might have come from the face of the Christ-child himself.  Love could do nothing; and when we have said that we have said all, for it is stronger than anything else in the whole wide world. Mr. and Mrs. Bird were talking it over one evening, when all the children were asleep. A famous physician had visited them that day, and told them that some time, it might be in one year, it might be in more, Carol would slip quietly off into heaven, whence she came.  \"It is no use to close our eyes to it any longer,\" said Mr. Bird, as he paced up and down the library floor; \"Carol will never be well again. It almost seems as if I could not bear it when I think of that loveliest child doomed to lie there day after day, and, what is still more, to suffer pain that we are helpless to keep away from her. Merry Christmas, indeed; it gets to be the saddest day in the year to me!\" and poor Mr. Bird sank into a chair by the table, and buried his face in his hands to keep his wife from seeing the tears that would come in spite of all his efforts.  \"But, Donald, dear,\" said sweet Mrs. Bird, with trembling voice, \"Christmas Day may not be so merry with us as it used, but it is very happy, and that is better, and very blessed, and that is better yet. I suffer chiefly for Carol's sake, but I have almost given up being sorrowful for my own. I am too happy in the child, and I see too clearly what she has done for us and the other children. Donald and Paul and Hugh were three strong, willful, boisterous boys, but now you seldom see such tenderness, devotion, thought for others, and self-denial in lads of their years. A quarrel or a hot word is almost unknown in this house, and why? Carol would hear it, and it would distress her, she is so full of love and goodness. The boys study with all their might and main. Why? Partly, at least, because they like to teach Carol, and amuse her by telling her what they read. When the seamstress comes, she likes to sew in Miss Carol's room, because there she forgets her own troubles, which, Heaven knows, are sore enough! And as for me, Donald, I am a better woman every day for Carol's sake; I have to be her eyes, ears, feet, hands,--her strength, her hope; and she, my own little child, is my example!\"  \"I was wrong, dear heart,\" said Mr. Bird more cheerfully; \"we will try not to repine, but to rejoice instead, that we have an 'angel of the house.'\"  \"And as for her future,\" Mrs. Bird went on, \"I think we need not be over-anxious. I feel as if she did not belong altogether to us, but that when she has done what God sent her for, He will take her back to Himself--and it may not be very long!\" Here it was poor Mrs. Bird's turn to break down, and Mr. Bird's turn to comfort her.     III  THE BIRDS' NEST   Carol herself knew nothing of motherly tears and fatherly anxieties; she lived on peacefully in the room where she was born.  But you never would have known that room; for Mr. Bird had a great deal of money, and though he felt sometimes as if he wanted to throw it all in the sea, since it could not buy a strong body for his little girl, yet he was glad to make the place she lived in just as beautiful as it could be.  The room had been extended by the building of a large addition that hung out over the garden below, and was so filled with windows that it might have been a conservatory. The ones on the side were thus still nearer the Church of Our Saviour than they used to be; those in front looked out on the beautiful harbor, and those in the back commanded a view of nothing in particular but a narrow alley; nevertheless, they were pleasantest of all to Carol, for the Ruggles family lived in the alley, and the nine little, middle-sized, and big Ruggles children were a source of inexhaustible interest.  The shutters could all be opened and Carol could take a real sun-bath in this lovely glass house, or they could all be closed when the dear head ached or the dear eyes were tired. The carpet was of soft gray, with clusters of green bay and holly leaves. The furniture was of white wood, on which an artist had painted snow scenes and Christmas trees and groups of merry children ringing bells and singing carols.  Donald had made a pretty, polished shelf, and screwed it on the outside of the foot-board, and the boys always kept this full of blooming plants, which they changed from time to time; the head-board, too, had a bracket on either side, where there were pots of maiden-hair ferns.  Love-birds and canaries hung in their golden houses in the windows, and they, poor caged things, could hop as far from their wooden perches as Carol could venture from her little white bed.  On one side of the room was a bookcase filled with hundreds--yes, I mean it--with hundreds and hundreds of books; books with gay-colored pictures, books without; books with black and white outline sketches, books with none at all; books with verses, books with stories; books that made children laugh, and some, only a few, that made them cry; books with words of one syllable for tiny boys and girls, and books with words of fearful length to puzzle wise ones.  This was Carol's \"Circulating Library.\" Every Saturday she chose ten books, jotting their names down in a diary; into these she slipped cards that said:--                      \"Please keep this book two weeks and read it.                      With love,     CAROL BIRD.\"  Then Mrs. Bird stepped into her carriage and took the ten books to the Children's Hospital, and brought home ten others that she had left there the fortnight before.  This was a source of great happiness; for some of the Hospital children that were old enough to print or write, and were strong enough to do it, wrote Carol sweet little letters about the books, and she answered them, and they grew to be friends. (It is very funny, but you do not always have to see people to love them. Just think about it, and tell me if it isn't so.)  There was a high wainscoting of wood about the room, and on top of this, in a narrow gilt framework, ran a row of illuminated pictures, illustrating fairy tales, all in dull blue and gold and scarlet and silver. From the door to the closet there was the story of \"The Fair One with Golden Locks;\" from closet to bookcase, ran \"Puss in Boots;\" from bookcase to fireplace, was \"Jack the Giant-killer;\" and on the other side of the room were \"Hop o' my Thumb,\" \"The Sleeping Beauty,\" and \"Cinderella.\"  Then there was a great closet full of beautiful things to wear, but they were all dressing-gowns and slippers and shawls; and there were drawers full of toys and games, but they were such as you could play with on your lap. There were no ninepins, nor balls, nor bows and arrows, nor bean bags, nor tennis rackets; but, after all, other children needed these more than Carol Bird, for she was always happy and contented, whatever she had or whatever she lacked; and after the room had been made so lovely for her, on her eighth Christmas, she always called herself, in fun, a \"Bird of Paradise.\"  On these particular December days she was happier than usual, for Uncle Jack was coming from England to spend the holidays. Dear, funny, jolly, loving, wise Uncle Jack, who came every two or three years, and brought so much joy with him that the world looked as black as a thunder-cloud for a week after he went away again.  The mail had brought this letter:--                                           LONDON, NOVEMBER 28, 188-.       Wish you merry Christmas, you dearest birdlings in America!

I am coming with such a      trunk full of treasures that you'll have to borrow the stockings of      Barnum's Giant and Giantess; I am coming to squeeze a certain      little lady-bird until she cries for mercy; I am coming to see if I      can find a boy to take care of a black pony that I bought lately.      It's the strangest thing I ever knew; I've hunted all over Europe,      and can't find a boy to suit me! I'll tell you why. I've set my      heart on finding one with a dimple in his chin, because this pony      particularly likes dimples! [\"Hurrah!\" cried Hugh; \"bless my dear      dimple; I'll never be ashamed of it again.\"]       Please drop a note to the clerk of the weather, and have a good,      rousing snow-storm--say on the twenty-second. None of your meek,      gentle, nonsensical, shilly-shallying snow-storms; not the sort      where the flakes float lazily down from the sky as if they didn't      care whether they ever got here or not and then melt away as soon      as they touch the earth, but a regular business-like whizzing,      whirring, blurring, cutting snow-storm, warranted to freeze and      stay on!       I should like rather a LARGE Christmas tree, if it's convenient:      not one of those \"sprigs,\" five or six feet high, that you used to      have three or four years ago, when the birdlings were not fairly      feathered out; but a tree of some size. Set it up in the garret, if      necessary, and then we can cut a hole in the roof if the tree      chances to be too high for the room.       Tell Bridget to begin to fatten a turkey. Tell her that by the      twentieth of December that turkey must not be able to stand on its      legs for fat, and then on the next three days she must allow it to      recline easily on its side, and stuff it to bursting. (One ounce of      stuffing beforehand is worth a pound afterwards.)       The pudding must be unusually huge, and darkly, deeply,      lugubriously blue in color. It must be stuck so full of plums that      the pudding itself will ooze out into the pan and not be brought on      to the table at all. I expect to be there by the twentieth, to      manage these little things myself,--remembering it is the early      Bird that catches the worm,--but give you the instructions in case      I should be delayed.       And Carol must decide on the size of the tree--she knows best, she      was a Christmas child; and she must plead for the snow-storm--the      \"clerk of the weather\" may pay some attention to her; and she must      look up the boy with the dimple for me--she's likelier to find him      than I am, this minute. She must advise about the turkey, and      Bridget must bring the pudding to her bedside and let her drop      every separate plum into it and stir it once for luck, or I'll not      eat a single slice--for Carol is the dearest part of Christmas to      Uncle Jack, and he'll have none of it without her. She is better      than all the turkeys and puddings and apples and spare-ribs and      wreaths and garlands and mistletoe and stockings and chimneys and      sleigh-bells in Christendom! She is the very sweetest Christmas      Carol that was ever written, said, sung, or chanted, and I am      coming as fast as ships and railway trains can carry me, to tell      her so.  Carol's joy knew no bounds. Mr. and Mrs. Bird laughed like children and kissed each other for sheer delight, and when the boys heard it they simply whooped like wild Indians; until the Ruggles family, whose back yard joined their garden, gathered at the door and wondered what was \"up\" in the big house.  [Illustration]     IV  \"BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER\"   Uncle Jack did really come on the twentieth. He was not detained by business, nor did he get left behind nor snowed up, as frequently happens in stories, and in real life too, I am afraid. The snow-storm came also; and the turkey nearly died a natural and premature death from overeating. Donald came, too; Donald, with a line of down upon his upper lip, and Greek and Latin on his tongue, and stores of knowledge in his handsome head, and stories--bless me, you couldn't turn over a chip without reminding Donald of something that happened \"at College.\" One or the other was always at Carol's bedside, for they fancied her paler than she used to be, and they could not bear her out of sight. It was Uncle Jack, though, who sat beside her in the winter twilights. The room was quiet, and almost dark, save for the snow-light outside, and the flickering flame of the fire, that danced over the \"Sleeping Beauty's\" face and touched the Fair One's golden locks with ruddier glory. Carol's hand (all too thin and white these latter days) lay close clasped in Uncle Jack's, and they talked together quietly of many, many things.  \"I want to tell you all about my plans for Christmas this year, Uncle Jack,\" said Carol, on the first evening of his visit, \"because it will be the loveliest one I ever had. The boys laugh at me for caring so much about it; but it isn't altogether because it is Christmas, nor because it is my birthday; but long, long ago, when I first began to be ill, I used to think, the first thing when I waked on Christmas morning, 'To-day is Christ's birthday--_and mine_!' I did not put the words close together, you know, because that made it seem too bold; but I first said, 'Christ's birthday,' out loud, and then, in a minute, softly to myself--'_and mine_!' 'Christ's birthday--_and mine_!' And so I do not quite feel about Christmas as other girls do. Mamma says she supposes that ever so many other children have been born on that day. I often wonder where they are, Uncle Jack, and whether it is a dear thought to them, too, or whether I am so much in bed, and so often alone, that it means more to me. Oh, I do hope that none of them are poor, or cold, or hungry; and I wish--I wish they were all as happy as I, because they are really my little brothers and sisters. Now, Uncle Jack dear, I am going to try and make somebody happy every single Christmas that I live, and this year it is to be the 'Ruggleses in the rear.'\"  \"That large and interesting brood of children in the little house at the end of the back garden?\"  \"Yes; isn't it nice to see so many together?--and, Uncle Jack, why do the big families always live in the small houses, and the small families in the big houses? We ought to call them the Ruggles children, of course; but Donald began talking of them as the 'Ruggleses in the rear,' and Papa and Mamma took it up, and now we cannot seem to help it. The house was built for Mr. Carter's coachman, but Mr. Carter lives in Europe, and the gentleman who rents his place for him doesn't care what happens to it, and so this poor family came to live there. When they first moved in, I used to sit in my window and watch them play in their back yard; they are so strong, and jolly, and good-natured;--and then, one day, I had a terrible headache, and Donald asked them if they would please not scream quite so loud, and they explained that they were having a game of circus, but that they would change and play 'Deaf and Dumb Asylum' all the afternoon.\"  \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Uncle Jack, \"what an obliging family, to be sure!\"  \"Yes, we all thought it very funny, and I smiled at them from the window when I was well enough to be up again. Now, Sarah Maud comes to her door when the children come home from school, and if Mamma nods her head, 'Yes,' that means 'Carol is very well,' and then you ought to hear the little Ruggleses yell,--I believe they try to see how much noise they can make; but if Mamma shakes her head, 'No,' they always play at quiet games. Then, one day, 'Cary,' my pet canary, flew out of her cage, and Peter Ruggles caught her and brought her back, and I had him up here in my room to thank him.\"  \"Is Peter the oldest?\"  \"No; Sarah Maud is the oldest--she helps do the washing; and Peter is the next. He is a dress-maker's boy.\"  \"And which is the pretty little red-haired girl?\"  \"That's Kitty.\"  \"And the fat youngster?\"  \"Baby Larry.\"  \"And that--most freckled one?\"  \"Now, don't laugh--that's Peoria.\"  \"Carol, you are joking.\"  \"No, really, Uncle dear. She was born in Peoria; that's all.\"  \"And is the next boy Oshkosh?\"  \"No,\" laughed Carol, \"the others are Susan, and Clement, and Eily, and Cornelius; they all look exactly alike, except that some of them have more freckles than the others.\"  \"How did you ever learn all their names?\"  \"Why, I have what I call a 'window-school.' It is too cold now; but in warm weather I am wheeled out on my balcony, and the Ruggleses climb up and walk along our garden fence, and sit down on the roof of our carriage-house. That brings them quite near, and I tell them stories. On Thanksgiving Day they came up for a few minutes,--it was quite warm at eleven o'clock,--and we told each other what we had to be thankful for; but they gave such queer answers that Papa had to run away for fear of laughing; and I couldn't understand them very well. Susan was thankful for '_trunks_,' of all things in the world; Cornelius, for 'horse-cars;' Kitty, for 'pork steak;' while Clem, who is very quiet, brightened up when I came to him, and said he was thankful for '_his lame puppy_.' Wasn't that pretty?\"  \"It might teach some of us a lesson, mightn't it, little girl?\"  \"That's what Mamma said. Now I'm going to give this whole Christmas to the Ruggleses; and, Uncle Jack, I earned part of the money myself.\"  \"You, my bird; how?\"  \"Well, you see, it could not be my own, own Christmas if Papa gave me all the money, and I thought to really keep Christ's birthday I ought to do something of my very own; and so I talked with Mamma. Of course she thought of something lovely; she always does: Mamma's head is just brimming over with lovely thoughts,--all I have to do is ask, and out pops the very one I want. This thought was to let her write down,"]]]
