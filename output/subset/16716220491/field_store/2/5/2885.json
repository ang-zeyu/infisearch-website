You may be a cliver sort of a mon, but moles be varmint.\" Thus saying, the old fellow wished us good morning and left us. \"Papa,\" said Willy, \"do not moles make very curious places under the ground in which they reside at times? I think I have somewhere seen pictures of these encampments.\" Yes, they do; but I only know of them from description and figures; the fortress is generally made under a hillock; it consists of many galleries connected with each other, and with a central chamber. You remember a young mole was brought to us last summer, and that we put it into a box with plenty of loose earth and some worms. We only kept it a day or two. One morning I found it dead. I suppose it had not enough to eat. The mole has an insatiable appetite, and, according to the observations of some naturalists, it will devour birds. Mr. Bell says that \"even the weaker of its own species under particular circumstances are not exempted from this promiscuous ferocity; for if two moles be placed together in a box without a very plentiful supply of food the weaker certainly falls a prey to the stronger. No thoroughbred bulldog keeps a firmer hold of the object of its attack than the mole. Mr. Jackson, a very intelligent mole-catcher, says that, when a boy, his hand was so severely and firmly laid hold of by one that he was obliged to use his teeth in order to loosen its hold.\"  [Illustration: HERON AND YOUNG.]  We now proceeded on our ramble, and I espied about one hundred yards off a heron on the bank of the Strine. He did not see us at first, but when we got a little nearer, off he flew, with his long legs stretched out behind, and his head bent close to his shoulders. He had evidently been fishing, for we could see the scales of fish on the side of the bank. Willy asked whether herons built on trees, and Jack wanted to know how they managed with their great long legs while sitting on their nests. These birds in the breeding season assemble together and make their nests on tall firs or oak trees; sometimes they build on rocks near the sea coast. It is said, too, that they will occasionally build on the ground. The heron's nest is not unlike that of the rook, only larger and broader; it is made of sticks and lined with wool and coarse grass; the female lays four or five eggs of a green colour, her long legs are tucked under her. Rooks and jackdaws sometimes take up their quarters near to a heronry, and do you know they steal their eggs, the rogues, and devour them. Both male and female herons take great care of their little ones and bring them food. Besides fish the heron will eat frogs, rats, young ducks, and coots. Eels are great dainties in the opinion of Mr. Heron; and sometimes an eel, after being pierced through the head by the sharp and strong bill of the heron, manages to wrap himself so tight round the bird's neck as to stop his breathing and cause his death. A good many years ago herons were protected by the law; they were considered royal game, and their capture by the peregrine falcon was looked upon as very exciting sport. As we followed the bank of the stream out flew a couple of kingfishers with straight and rapid flight; we distinctly heard the shrill note these birds utter; they flew about two hundred yards and lighted on a rail near the water's edge. Let us see if we can get a little nearer to them, I said, and then sit down and see what they will do. \"Papa,\" said May, \"is not the kingfisher a very beautiful bird, and the most brightly coloured of all British birds?\" Yes, it is; its splendid colours remind one of the gorgeous plumage of tropical birds, and we have no other British bird with such brilliant colours. There, did you see that? one of the birds darted off the rail into the water. I have no doubt he has caught a small fish; and now he has lighted on the same rail, and with my pocket telescope I can see him throw his head up and swallow some dainty morsel. It is not at all an uncommon sight to see a kingfisher hover over the water after the manner of a kestril-hawk; suddenly it will descend with the greatest rapidity and again emerge, seldom failing to secure a fish for its dinner. \"Did you ever find a kingfisher's nest, papa?\" Willy inquired. Yes; some years ago I found one in a hole in a bank; there were four eggs in it, and I had to put my whole arm into the hole before I got at the nest, which consisted of sand mixed with a great quantity of very small fish bones. The eggs are very pretty, having a delicate pink tinge, the shell is thin, and the form of the egg almost round. \"But where,\" asked Jack, \"do the little fish bones of the nest come from?\" I think I have told you that many birds--hawks, eagles, owls, shrikes, &c.--throw up from their crops the indigestible portions of their food. It is not uncommon to find these on the ground in the course of one's rambles. Kingfishers possess this power; they throw up the undigested fishbones, and curiously enough, as it would appear, form them into a nest. There is a kingfisher's nest in the British Museum, which I remember to have seen a few years ago. It has been a disputed point whether the parent bird throws the fishbones up at random into the hole where she is going to lay, or whether she forms them into a nest. The nest in the British Museum was secured at the expense of great patience and pains by the celebrated ornithologist and splendid draughtsman, Mr. Gould, whose drawings you may one day see in the library of the museum at Eyton. This specimen, if I remember right, was of a flattened form and fully half an inch thick. It is said that the kingfisher always selects a hole that has an upward slope, so that, though heavy rains may cause the water of the river bank to rise into the hole, the eggs will be dry. Some naturalists have said that kingfishers do not make their own holes, but use those already made by other animals. Mr. Gould, however, is of opinion that kingfishers drill their own holes. The tunnels always slope upwards, as I said; at the further end of the tunnel is an oven-like chamber where the nest is made. The fish-bone nest is thought by Mr. Gould to be really a nest, and intended to keep the eggs off the damp ground. However, there is difference of opinion on this point, and I reserve my own. We will see if we cannot find a kingfisher's nest some time this summer. Now, May, what little plant have you got hold of? \"Indeed I don't know, papa, but it is a very curious little plant; I gathered it at the bottom of that hedge bank.\" Ah, I know it well, and a little favorite it is too; it is the moschatell. You see it is about five inches high, with pale green flowers and leaves; the flowers are arranged in heads of five each, namely, four on the side, and one on the top; it has a delicate musk-like odour, very pleasant and refreshing. Take a few specimens home and put them in water with your primroses. Mamma, I know, is very fond of the pretty little moschatell.  \"Oh, papa,\" exclaimed Willy, \"look at the bottom of this drain; what is that strange-looking insect crawling slowly about at the bottom?\" I see; it is a water-scorpion, a very common insect in these drains on the moors,--indeed, it is common everywhere; let us catch him and take him home for examination. He is a queer-looking creature, with a small head and pointed beak; his forearms are something like lobster's claws; his prevailing colour blackish-brown, like the mud upon which he crawls; his body is very flat, and ends in two long stick-like projections; underneath these horny covers of the creature may be seen his two wings. He is an aquatic murderer; inserting that pointed beak into the body of some other insect, and holding his victim in his lobster-like forearms--oh! fatal embrace--he sucks out the juices of the struggling prey. Kirby and Spence say that some of the tribe of insects to which the water-scorpion belongs are so savage that they seem to love destruction for its own sake. A water-scorpion which was put into a basin of water with several young tadpoles killed them all without attempting to eat one. The tail projections, I ought to tell you, are connected with the insect's breathing; they are protruded out of the water and conduct the air to the spiracles at the end of the body, about which I must tell you more at another time. The eggs of the water-scorpion I have frequently found; they are of an oval form, with seven long hair-like projections at one end. But it is time to go home, our walk to-day is over; let us look forward to another holiday and another country ramble.  [Illustration]  FOOTNOTES:  [Footnote A: 'Wild Sports of the Highlands,' p. 136.]     WALK II.  APRIL   We will walk to-day along the side of the canal bank as far as the aqueduct, then take the Duke's Drive and home by Lubstree Park; we shall find lots to see and to admire in the course of our ramble. We notice plenty of those beautiful balls of green jelly (_Ophrydium versatile_) in the clear water of the canal which, you know, we see every spring. These balls vary in size from that of a pea to that of Jack's fist; they are, you see, generally attached to some water-weed, and consist of myriads of very minute creatures called _infusoria_, which are imbedded in a mass of whitish jelly; these animals can detach themselves from the jelly and swim freely about; of course it requires a microscope to see the tiny green animalcules. If we examine a single specimen under a high power of the microscope we shall see its shape, which, when fully extended, is long and cylindrical, having at one end a mouth surrounded, as is usually the case in the _infusoria_, by a circle of very fine hairs, or _cilia_, as they are called, from the Latin word _cilium_ an eyelash; the mouth opens into a long narrow channel; the creature's throat, which leads to its stomach; towards the opposite"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23942"],["title","Unborn Tomorrow (#1)"],["body","an overgrown festival in comparatively remote Southern Germany? The tourist season is over before September 21st, first day of the gigantic beer bust. Nor could the Germans account for any such number. Munich itself has a population of less than a million, counting children.  And those millions of gallons of beer, the hundreds of thousands of chickens, the herds of oxen. Who ponied up all the money for such expenditures? How could the average German, with his twenty-five dollars a week salary?  In Munich there was no hotel space available. I went to the Bahnhof where they have a hotel service and applied. They put my name down, pocketed the husky bribe, showed me where I could check my bag, told me they'd do what they could, and to report back in a few hours.  I had another suspicious twinge. If five million people attended this beer bout, how were they accommodated?  The _Theresienwiese_, the fair ground, was only a few blocks away. I was stiff from the plane ride so I walked.         *       *       *       *       *  There are seven major brewers in the Munich area, each of them represented by one of the circuslike tents that Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tent contained benches and tables for about five thousand persons and from six to ten thousands pack themselves in, competing for room. In the center is a tremendous bandstand, the musicians all _lederhosen_ clad, the music as Bavarian as any to be found in a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of peasant garbed _fräuleins_ darted about the tables with quart sized earthenware mugs, platters of chicken, sausage, kraut and pretzels.  I found a place finally at a table which had space for twenty-odd beer bibbers. Odd is right. As weird an assortment of Germans and foreign tourists as could have been dreamed up, ranging from a seventy- or eighty-year-old couple in Bavarian costume, to the bald-headed drunk across the table from me.  A desperate waitress bearing six mugs of beer in each hand scurried past. They call them _masses_, by the way, not mugs. The bald-headed character and I both held up a finger and she slid two of the _masses_ over to us and then hustled on.  \"Down the hatch,\" the other said, holding up his _mass_ in toast.  \"To the ladies,\" I told him. Before sipping, I said, \"You know, the tourist pamphlets say this stuff is eighteen per cent. That's nonsense. No beer is that strong.\" I took a long pull.  He looked at me, waiting.  I came up. \"Mistaken,\" I admitted.  A _mass_ or two apiece later he looked carefully at the name engraved on his earthenware mug. \"Löwenbräu,\" he said. He took a small notebook from his pocket and a pencil, noted down the word and returned the things.  \"That's a queer looking pencil you have there,\" I told him. \"German?\"  \"Venusian,\" he said. \"Oops, sorry. Shouldn't have said that.\"  I had never heard of the brand so I skipped it.  \"Next is the Hofbräu,\" he said.  \"Next what?\" Baldy's conversation didn't seem to hang together very well.  \"My pilgrimage,\" he told me. \"All my life I've been wanting to go back to an _Oktoberfest_ and sample every one of the seven brands of the best beer the world has ever known. I'm only as far as Löwenbräu. I'm afraid I'll never make it.\"  I finished my _mass_. \"I'll help you,\" I told him. \"Very noble endeavor. Name is Simon.\"  \"Arth,\" he said. \"How could you help?\"  \"I'm still fresh--comparatively. I'll navigate you around. There are seven beer tents. How many have you got through, so far?\"  \"Two, counting this one,\" Arth said.  I looked at him. \"It's going to be a chore,\" I said. \"You've already got a nice edge on.\"  Outside, as we made our way to the next tent, the fair looked like every big State-Fair ever seen, except it was bigger. Games, souvenir stands, sausage stands, rides, side shows, and people, people, people.  The Hofbräu tent was as overflowing as the last but we managed to find two seats.  The band was blaring, and five thousand half-swacked voices were roaring accompaniment.      _In Muenchen steht ein Hofbräuhaus!     Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!_  At the _G'sufa_ everybody upped with the mugs and drank each other's health.  \"This is what I call a real beer bust,\" I said approvingly.  Arth was waving to a waitress. As in the Löwenbräu tent, a full quart was the smallest amount obtainable.  A beer later I said, \"I don't know if you'll make it or not, Arth.\"  \"Make what?\"  \"All seven tents.\"  \"Oh.\"  A waitress was on her way by, mugs foaming over their rims. I gestured to her for refills.  \"Where are you from, Arth?\" I asked him, in the way of making conversation.  \"2183.\"  \"2183 where?\"  He looked at me, closing one eye to focus better. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, 2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.\"  \"New Albuquerque? Where's that?\"  Arth thought about it. Took another long pull at the beer. \"Right across the way from old Albuquerque,\" he said finally. \"Maybe we ought to be getting on to the Pschorrbräu tent.\"  \"Maybe we ought to eat something first,\" I said. \"I'm beginning to feel this. We could get some of that barbecued ox.\"  Arth closed his eyes in pain. \"Vegetarian,\" he said. \"Couldn't possibly eat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.\"  \"Well, we need some nourishment,\" I said.  \"There's supposed to be considerable nourishment in beer.\"  That made sense. I yelled, \"_Fräulein! Zwei neu bier!_\"         *       *       *       *       *  Somewhere along in here the fog rolled in. When it rolled out again, I found myself closing one eye the better to read the lettering on my earthenware mug. It read Augustinerbräu. Somehow we'd evidently navigated from one tent to another.  Arth was saying, \"Where's your hotel?\"  That seemed like a good question. I thought about it for a while. Finally I said, \"Haven't got one. Town's jam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof. I don't think we'll ever make it, Arth. How many we got to go?\"  \"Lost track,\" Arth said. \"You can come home with me.\"  We drank to that and the fog rolled in again.  When the fog rolled out, it was daylight. Bright, glaring, awful daylight. I was sprawled, complete with clothes, on one of twin beds. On the other bed, also completely clothed, was Arth.  That sun was too much. I stumbled up from the bed, staggered to the window and fumbled around for a blind or curtain. There was none.  Behind me a voice said in horror, \"Who ... how ... oh, _Wodo_, where'd you come from?\"  I got a quick impression, looking out the window, that the Germans were certainly the most modern, futuristic people in the world. But I couldn't stand the light. \"Where's the shade,\" I moaned.  Arth did something and the window went opaque.  \"That's quite a gadget,\" I groaned. \"If I didn't feel so lousy, I'd appreciate it.\"  Arth was sitting on the edge of the bed holding his bald head in his hands. \"I remember now,\" he sorrowed. \"You didn't have a hotel. What a stupidity. I'll be phased. Phased all the way down.\"  \"You haven't got a handful of aspirin, have you?\" I asked him.  \"Just a minute,\" Arth said, staggering erect and heading for what undoubtedly was a bathroom. \"Stay where you are. Don't move. Don't touch anything.\"  \"All right,\" I told him plaintively. \"I'm clean. I won't mess up the place. All I've got is a hangover, not lice.\"  Arth was gone. He came back in two or three minutes, box of pills in hand. \"Here, take one of these.\"  I took the pill, followed it with a glass of water.         *       *       *       *       *  And went out like a light.  Arth was shaking my arm. \"Want another _mass_?\"  The band was blaring, and five thousand half-swacked voices were roaring accompaniment.      _In Muenchen steht ein Hofbräuhaus!     Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!_  At the _G'sufa_ everybody upped with their king-size mugs and drank each other's health.  My head was killing me. \"This is where I came in, or something,\" I groaned.  Arth said, \"That was last night.\" He looked at me over the rim of his beer mug.  Something, somewhere, was wrong. But I didn't care. I finished my _mass_ and then remembered. \"I've got to get my bag. Oh, my head. Where did we spend last night?\"  Arth said, and his voice sounded cautious, \"At my hotel, don't you remember?\"  \"Not very well,\" I admitted. \"I feel lousy. I must have dimmed out. I've got to go to the Bahnhof and get my luggage.\"  Arth didn't put up an argument on that. We said good-by and I could feel him watching after me as I pushed through the tables on the way out.  At the Bahnhof they could do me no good. There were no hotel rooms available in Munich. The head was getting worse by the minute. The fact that they'd somehow managed to lose my bag didn't help. I worked on that project for at least a couple of hours. Not only wasn't the bag at the luggage checking station, but the attendant there evidently couldn't make heads nor tails of the check receipt. He didn't speak English and my high school German was inadequate, especially accompanied by a blockbusting hangover.  I didn't get anywhere tearing my hair and complaining from one end of the Bahnhof to the other. I drew a blank on the bag.  And the head was getting worse by the minute. I was bleeding to death through the eyes and instead of butterflies I had bats in my stomach. Believe me, _nobody_ should drink a gallon or more of Marzenbräu.         *       *       *       *       *  I decided the hell with it. I took a cab to the airport, presented my return ticket, told them I wanted to leave on the first obtainable plane to New York. I'd spent two days at the _Oktoberfest_, and I'd had it.  I got more guff there. Something was wrong with the ticket, wrong date or some such. But they fixed that up. I never was clear on what was fouled up, some clerk's error, evidently.  The trip back was as uninteresting as the one over. As the hangover began to wear off--a little--I was almost sorry I hadn't been able to stay. If I'd only been able to get a room I _would_ have stayed, I told myself.  From Idlewild, I came directly to the office rather than going to my apartment. I figured I might as"]]]
