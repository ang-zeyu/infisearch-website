What caused those vibroblades to burn up that way?\"  \"Must have been faulty,\" Mike the Angel said innocently.  \"Both of them?\" Sergeant Cowder asked skeptically. \"At the same time?\"  \"Oh no. Thirty seconds apart, I'd guess.\"  \"Very interesting. Very.\" He started to say something else, but a uniformed officer stuck his head in through the doorway that led to the front of the shop.  \"We combed the whole area, Sergeant. Not a soul around. But from the looks of the alley, there must have been a small truck parked in there not too long ago.\"  Cowder nodded. \"Makes sense. Those JD's wouldn't have tried this unless they intended to take everything they could put their hands on, and they certainly couldn't have put all this in their pockets.\" He rubbed one big finger over the tip of his nose. \"Okay, Barton, that's all. Take those two kids to the hospital and book 'em in the detention ward. I want to talk to them when they wake up.\"  The cop nodded and left.  Sergeant Cowder looked back at Harry. \"Your alarm to the precinct station went off at six thirty-six. I figure that whoever was on the outside, in that truck, knew something had gone wrong as soon as the fight started in here. He--or they--shut off whatever they were using to suppress the alarm system and took off before we got here. They sure must have moved fast.\"  \"Must have,\" agreed Harry. \"Is there anything else, Sergeant?\"  Cowder shook his head. \"Not right now. I'll get in touch with you later, if I need you.\"  Harry and Mike the Angel followed him through the front of the shop to the front door. At the door, Cowder turned.  \"Well, good night. Thanks for your assistance, Mr. Gabriel. I wish some of our cops had had your luck.\"  \"How so?\" asked Mike the Angel.  \"If more vibroblades would blow up at opportune moments, we'd have fewer butchered policemen.\"  Mike the Angel shook his head. \"Not really. If their vibros started burning out every time they came near a cop, the JD's would just start using something else. You can't win in this game.\"  Cowder nodded glumly. \"It's a losing proposition any way you look at it.... Well, good night again.\" He stepped out, and Old Harry closed and locked the door behind him.  Mike the Angel said: \"Come on, Harry; I want to find something.\" He began walking back down the long, narrow shop toward the rear again. Harry followed, looking mystified.  Mike the Angel stopped, sniffing. \"Smell that?\"  Harry sniffed. \"Aye. Burnt insulation. So?\"  \"You know which one of these bins is nearest to your main control cable. Start looking. See if you find anything queer.\"  Old Harry walked over to a nearby bin, pulled it open, and looked inside. He closed it, pulled open another. He found the gadget on the third try. It was a plastic case, six by six by eight, and it still smelled of hot insulation, although the case itself was barely warm.  \"What is it?\" Harry asked in wonder.  \"It's the gizmo that turned your equipment off. When I passed by it, my own gadget must have blown it. I knew the police couldn't have made it here between the time of the fight and the time they showed up. They must have had at least an extra minute. Besides, I didn't think anyone could build an instrument that would blank out everything at long range. It had to be something near your main cable. I think you'll find a metallic oscillator in there. Analyze it. Might be useful.\"  Harry turned the box over in his hands. \"Probably has a timer in it to start it.... Well.... That helps.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"I've got a pretty good idea who put it here. Older kid. Nineteen--maybe twenty. Seemed like a nice lad, too. Didn't take him for a JD. Can't trust anyone these days. Thanks, Mike. If I find anything new in here, I'll let you know.\"  \"Do that,\" said Mike the Angel. \"And, as a personal favor, I'll show you how to build my own super-duper, extra-special, anti-vibroblade defense unit.\"  Old Harry grinned, crinkling up his wizened face in a mass of fine wrinkles. \"You'd better think up a shorter name than that for it, laddie; I could probably build one in less time than it takes you to say it.\"  \"Want to bet?\"  \"I'll bet you twenty I can do it in twenty-four hours.\"  \"Twenty it is, Harry. I'll sell you mine this time tomorrow for twenty bucks.\"  Harry shook his head. \"I'll trade you mine for yours, plus twenty.\" Then his eyes twinkled. \"And speaking of money, didn't you come down here to buy something?\"  Mike the Angel laughed. \"You're not going to like it. I came down to get a dozen plastic-core resistors.\"  \"What size?\"  Mike told him, and Old Harry went over to the proper bin, pulled them out, all properly boxed, and handed them to him.  \"That'll be four dollars,\" he said.  Mike the Angel paid up with a smile. \"You don't happen to have a hundred-thousand-unit microcryotron stack, do you?\"  \"Ain't s'posed to,\" said Harry MacDougal. \"If I did, I wouldn't sell it to you. But, as a matter of cold fact, I do happen to have one. Use it for a paperweight. I'll give it to you for nothing, because it don't work, anyhow.\"  \"Maybe I can fix it,\" said Mike the Angel, \"as long as you're giving it to me. How come it doesn't work?\"  \"Just a second, laddie,\" said Harry. He scuttled to the rear of the shop and came back with a ready-wrapped package measuring five by five by four. He handed it to Mike the Angel and said: \"It's a present. Thanks for helping me out of a tight spot.\"  Mike said something deprecative of his own efforts and took the package. If it were in working order it would have been worth close to three hundred dollars--more than that on the black market. If it was broken, though, it was no good to Mike. A microcryotron unit is almost impossible to fix if it breaks down. But Mike took it because he didn't want to hurt Old Harry's feelings by refusing a present.  \"Thanks, Harry,\" he said. \"Happen to know why it doesn't work?\"  Harry's face crinkled again in his all-over smile. \"Sure, Mike. It ain't plugged in.\"     4   Mike the Angel did not believe in commuting. Being a bachelor, he could afford to indulge in that belief. In his suite of offices on 112th Street, there was one door marked \"M. R. Gabriel.\" Behind that door was his private secretary's office, which acted as an effective barrier between himself and the various employees of the firm. Behind the secretary's office was his own office.  There was still another door in his inner office, a plain, unmarked door that looked as though it might conceal a closet.  It didn't. It was the door to a veddy, veddy expensive apartment with equally expensive appointments. One wall, thirty feet long and ten feet high, was a nearly invisible, dustproof slab of polished, optically flat glass that gave the observer the feeling that there was nothing between him and the city street, five hundred feet below.  The lights of the city, coming through the wall, gave the room plenty of illumination after sunset, but the simple flick of a switch could polarize it black, allowing perfect privacy.  The furniture was massive, heavily braced, and well upholstered. It had to be; Mike the Angel liked to flop into chairs, and his two hundred and sixty pounds gave chairs a lot of punishment.  On one of the opaque walls was Dali's original \"Eucharist,\" with its muffled, robed figures looking oddly luminous in the queer combination of city lights and interior illumination. Farther back, a Valois gleamed metallically above the shadowed bas-reliefs of its depths.  It was the kind of apartment Mike the Angel liked. He could sleep, if necessary, on a park bench or in a trench, but he didn't see any reason for doing so if he could sleep on a five-hundred-dollar floater.  As he had passed through each door, he had checked them carefully. His electrokey had a special circuit that lighted up a tiny glow lamp in the key handle if the lock had been tampered with. None of them had.  He opened the final door, went into his apartment, and locked the door behind him, as he had locked the others. Then he turned on the lights, peeled off his raincoat, and plopped himself into a chair to unwrap the microcryotron stack he had picked up at Harry's.  Theoretically, Harry wasn't supposed to sell the things. They were still difficult to make, and they were supposed to be used only by persons who were authorized to build robot brains, since that's what the stack was--a part of a robot brain. Mike could have put his hands on one legally, provided he'd wanted to wait for six or eight months to clear up the red tape. Actually, the big robotics companies didn't want amateurs fooling around with robots; they'd much rather build the robots themselves and rent them out. They couldn't make do-it-yourself projects impossible, but they could make them difficult.  In a way, there was some good done. So far, the JD's hadn't gone into big-scale robotics. Self-controlled bombs could be rather nasty.  Adult criminals, of course, already had them. But an adult criminal who had the money to invest in robotic components, or went to the trouble to steal them, had something more lucrative in mind than street fights or robbing barrooms. To crack a bank, for instance, took a cleverly constructed, well-designed robot and plenty of ingenuity on the part of the operator.  Mike the Angel didn't want to make bombs or automatic bankrobbers; he just wanted to fiddle with the stack, see what it would do. He turned it over in his hands a couple of times, then shrugged, got up, went over to his closet, and put the thing away. There wasn't anything he could do with it until he'd bought a cryostat--a liquid helium refrigerator. A cryotron functions only at temperatures near absolute zero.  The phone chimed.  Mike went over to it, punched the switch, and said: \"Gabriel speaking.\"  No image formed on the screen. A voice said: \"Sorry, wrong number.\" There was a slight click, and the phone went dead. Mike shrugged and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23344"],["title","The Magic Fishbone (#1)"],["body","stood on the steps coming home from school, and terrified him out of his wits and he put his hand through a pane of glass, and bled bled bled. When the seventeen other young Princes and Princesses saw him bleed bleed bleed, they were terrified out of their wits too, and screamed themselves black in their seventeen faces all at once. But the Princess Alicia put her hands over all their seventeen mouths, one after another, and persuaded them to be quiet because of the sick Queen. And then she put the wounded Prince's hand in a basin of fresh cold water, while they stared with their twice seventeen are thirty-four put down four and carry three eyes, and then she looked in the hand for bits of glass, and there were fortunately no bits of glass there. And then she said to two chubby-legged Princes who were sturdy though small, \"Bring me in the Royal rag-bag; I must snip and stitch and cut and contrive.\" So those two young Princes tugged at the Royal rag-bag and lugged it in, and the Princess Alicia sat down on the floor with a large pair of scissors and a needle and thread, and snipped and stitched and cut and contrived, and made a bandage and put it on, and it fitted beautifully, and so when it was all done she saw the King her Papa looking on by the door.  [Illustration]  \"Alicia.\"  \"Yes, Papa.\"  \"What have you been doing?\"  \"Snipping stitching cutting and contriving, Papa.\"  \"Where is the magic fish-bone?\"  \"In my pocket, Papa.\"  \"I thought you had lost it?\"  \"O, no, Papa.\"  \"Or forgotten it?\"  \"No, indeed, Papa.\"  After that, she ran up-stairs to the Duchess and told her what had passed, and told her the secret over again, and the Duchess shook her flaxen curls and laughed with her rosy lips.  [Illustration]  Well! and so another time the baby fell under the grate. The seventeen young Princes and Princesses were used to it, for they were almost always falling under the grate or down the stairs, but the baby was not used to it yet, and it gave him a swelled face and a black eye. The way the poor little darling came to tumble was, that he slid out of the Princess Alicia's lap just as she was sitting in a great coarse apron that quite smothered her, in front of the kitchen-fire, beginning to peel the turnips for the broth for dinner; and the way she came to be doing that was, that the King's cook had run away that morning with her own true love who was a very tall but very tipsy soldier. Then, the seventeen young Princes and Princesses, who cried at everything that happened, cried and roared. But the Princess Alicia (who couldn't help crying a little herself) quietly called to them to be still, on account of not throwing back the Queen up-stairs, who was fast getting well, and said, \"Hold your tongues, you wicked little monkeys, every one of you, while I examine baby!\" Then she examined baby, and found that he hadn't broken anything, and she held cold iron to his poor dear eye, and smoothed his poor dear face, and he presently fell asleep in her arms. Then, she said to the seventeen Princes and Princesses, \"I am afraid to lay him down yet, lest he should wake and feel pain, be good, and you shall all be cooks.\" They jumped for joy when they heard that, and began making themselves cooks' caps out of old newspapers. So to one she gave the salt-box, and to one she gave the barley, and to one she gave the herbs, and to one she gave the turnips, and to one she gave the carrots, and to one she gave the onions, and to one she gave the spice-box, till they were all cooks, and all running about at work, she sitting in the middle smothered in the great coarse apron, nursing baby. By and by the broth was done, and the baby woke up smiling like an angel, and was trusted to the sedatest Princess to hold, while the other Princes and Princesses were squeezed into a far-off corner to look at the Princess Alicia turning out the saucepan-full of broth, for fear (as they were always getting into trouble) they should get splashed and scalded. When the broth came tumbling out, steaming beautifully, and smelling like a nosegay good to eat, they clapped their hands. That made the baby clap his hands; and that, and his looking as if he had a comic toothache, made all the Princes and Princesses laugh. So the Princess Alicia said, \"Laugh and be good, and after dinner we will make him a nest on the floor in a corner, and he shall sit in his nest and see a dance of eighteen cooks.\" That delighted the young Princes and Princesses, and they ate up all the broth, and washed up all the plates and dishes, and cleared away, and pushed the table into a corner, and then they in their cooks' caps, and the Princess Alicia in the smothering coarse apron that belonged to the cook that had run away with her own true love that was the very tall but very tipsy soldier, danced a dance of eighteen cooks before the angelic baby, who forgot his swelled face and his black eye, and crowed with joy.  [Illustration: The Dance of the Eighteen Cooks]  And so then, once more the Princess Alicia saw King Watkins the First, her father, standing in the doorway looking on, and he said: \"What have you been doing, Alicia?\"  \"Cooking and contriving, Papa.\"  \"What else have you been doing, Alicia?\"  \"Keeping the children light-hearted, Papa.\"  \"Where is the magic fish-bone, Alicia?\"  \"In my pocket, Papa.\"  \"I thought you had lost it?\"  \"O, no, Papa.\"  \"Or forgotten it?\"  \"No, indeed, Papa.\"  The King then sighed so heavily, and seemed so low-spirited, and sat down so miserably, leaning his head upon his hand, and his elbow upon the kitchen table pushed away in the corner, that the seventeen Princes and Princesses crept softly out of the kitchen, and left him alone with the Princess Alicia and the angelic baby.  \"What is the matter, Papa?\"  \"I am dreadfully poor, my child.\"  \"Have you no money at all, Papa?\"  [Illustration: \"What is the matter, Papa?\"]  \"None my child.\"  \"Is there no way left of getting any, Papa?\"  \"No way,\" said the King. \"I have tried very hard, and I have tried all ways.\"  When she heard those last words, the Princess Alicia began to put her hand into the pocket where she kept the magic fish-bone.  \"Papa,\" said she, \"when we have tried very hard, and tried all ways, we must have done our very very best?\"  \"No doubt, Alicia.\"  \"When we have done our very very best, Papa, and that is not enough, then I think the right time must have come for asking help of others.\" This was the very secret connected with the magic fish-bone, which she had found out for herself from the good fairy Grandmarina's words, and which she had so often whispered to her beautiful and fashionable friend the Duchess.  So she took out of her pocket the magic fish-bone that had been dried and rubbed and polished till it shone like mother-of-pearl; and she gave it one little kiss and wished it was quarter day. And immediately it _was_ quarter day; and the King's quarter's salary came rattling down the chimney, and bounced into the middle of the floor.  But this was not half of what happened, no not a quarter, for immediately afterwards the good fairy Grandmarina came riding in, in a carriage and four (Peacocks), with Mr Pickles's boy up behind, dressed in silver and gold, with a cocked hat, powdered hair, pink silk stockings, a jewelled cane, and a nosegay. Down jumped Mr Pickles's boy with his cocked hat in his hand and wonderfully polite (being entirely changed by enchantment), and handed Grandmarina out, and there she stood in her rich shot silk smelling of dried lavender, fanning herself with a sparkling fan.  \"Alicia, my dear,\" said this charming old Fairy, \"how do you do, I hope I see you pretty well, give me a kiss.\"  The Princess Alicia embraced her, and then Grandmarina turned to the King, and said rather sharply:--\"Are you good?\"  [Illustration: \"Alicia, my dear ... how do you do?\"]  The King said he hoped so.  \"I suppose you know the reason, _now_, why my god-Daughter here,\" kissing the Princess again, \"did not apply to the fish-bone sooner?\" said the Fairy.  The King made her a shy bow.  \"Ah! but you didn't _then_!\" said the Fairy.  The King made her a shyer bow.  \"Any more reasons to ask for?\" said the Fairy.  The King said no, and he was very sorry.  \"Be good then,\" said the Fairy, \"and live happy ever afterwards.\"  Then, Grandmarina waved her fan, and the Queen came in most splendidly dressed, and the seventeen young Princes and Princesses, no longer grown out of their clothes, came in newly fitted out from top to toe, with tucks in everything to admit of its being let out. After that, the Fairy tapped the Princess Alicia with her fan, and the smothering coarse apron flew away, and she appeared exquisitely dressed, like a little Bride, with a wreath of orange-flowers and a silver veil. After that, the kitchen dresser changed of itself into a wardrobe, made of beautiful woods and gold and looking glass, which was full of dresses of all sorts, all for her and all exactly fitting her. After that, the angelic baby came in, running alone, with his face and eye not a bit the worse but much the better. Then, Grandmarina begged to be introduced to the Duchess, and, when the Duchess was brought down many compliments passed between them.  A little whispering took place between the Fairy and the Duchess, and then the Fairy said out loud, \"Yes. I thought she would have told you.\" Grandmarina then turned to the King and Queen, and said, \"We are going in search of Prince Certainpersonio. The pleasure of your company is requested at church in half an hour precisely.\" So she and the Princess Alicia got into the carriage, and Mr Pickles's boy handed in the Duchess who sat by herself on the opposite seat, and then Mr Pickles's boy put up the steps and got up behind, and the Peacocks flew away with their tails spread.  [Illustration: She appeared exquisitely dressed, like a little Bride]  Prince Certainpersonio was sitting by himself, eating barley-sugar and waiting to be ninety. When he "]]]
