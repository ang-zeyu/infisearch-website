How Rumplestilz Held Out in Vain for a Bonus     In Germany there lived an earl     Who had a charming niece:   And never gave the timid girl     A single moment's peace!   Whatever low and menial task     His fancy flitted through,   He did not hesitate to ask     That shrinking child to do.   (I see with truly honest shame you   Are blushing, and I do not blame you.   A tale like this the feelings softens,   And brings the tears, as does \"Two Orphans.\")    [Illustration]    She had to wash the windows, and     She had to scrub the floors,   She had to lend a willing hand     To fifty other chores:   She gave the dog his exercise,     She read the earl the news,   She ironed all his evening ties,     And polished all his shoes,   She cleaned the tins that filled the dairy,   She cut the claws of the canary,   And then, at night, with manner winsome,   When coal was wanted, carried in some!    But though these tasks were quite enough,     He thought them all too few,   And so her uncle, rude and rough,     Invented something new.   He took her to a little room,     Her willingness to tax,   And pointed out a broken loom     And half a ton of flax,   Observing: \"Spin six pairs of trousers!\"   His haughty manner seemed to rouse hers.   She met his scornful glances proudly--    [Illustration]    But when the earl went down the stair     She yielded to her fears.   Gave way at last to grim despair,     And melted into tears:   When suddenly, from out the wall,     As if he felt at home,   There pounced a singularly small     And much distorted gnome.   He smiled a smile extremely vapid,   And set to work in fashion rapid;   No time for resting he deducted,   And soon the trousers were constructed.    [Illustration]    The girl observed: \"How very nice     To help me out this way!\"   The gnome replied: \"A certain price     Of course you'll have to pay.   I'll call to-morrow afternoon,     My due reward to claim,   And then you'll sing another tune     Unless you guess my name!\"   He indicated with a gesture   The pile of newly fashioned vesture:   His eyes on hers a moment centered,   And then he went, as he had entered.    [Illustration]    As by this tale you have been grieved     And heartily distressed,   Kind sir, you will be much relieved     To know his name she guessed:    But if I do not tell the same,     Pray count it not a crime:--   I've tried my best, and for that name     I can't find any rhyme!   Yet spare me from remarks injurious:   I will not leave you foiled and furious.   If something must proclaim the answer,   And I cannot, the title can, sir!     _The Moral_ is: All said and done,   There's nothing new beneath the sun,   And many times before, a title   Was incapacity's requital!       How Jack Made the Giants Uncommonly Sore     Of all the ill-fated   Boys ever created     Young Jack was the wretchedest lad:   An emphatic, erratic,   Dogmatic fanatic     Was foisted upon him as dad!   From the time he could walk,   And before he could talk,     His wearisome training began,   On a highly barbarian,   Disciplinarian,   Nearly Tartarean         Plan!    [Illustration]    He taught him some Raleigh,   And some of Macaulay,     Till all of \"Horatius\" he knew,   And the drastic, sarcastic,   Fantastic, scholastic     Philippics of \"Junius,\" too.   He made him learn lots   Of the poems of Watts,     And frequently said he ignored,   On principle, any son's   Title to benisons   Till he'd learned Tennyson's         \"Maud.\"    \"For these are the giants   Of thought and of science,\"     He said in his positive way:   \"So weigh them, obey them,   Display them, and lay them     To heart in your infancy's day!\"   Jack made no reply,   But he said on the sly     An eloquent word, that had come   From a quite indefensible,   Most reprehensible,   But indispensable         Chum.    By the time he was twenty   Jack had such a plenty     Of books and paternal advice,   Though seedy and needy,   Indeed he was greedy     For vengeance, whatever the price!   In the editor's seat   Of a critical sheet     He found the revenge that he sought;   And, with sterling appliance of   Mind, wrote defiance of   All of the giants of         Thought.    He'd thunder and grumble   At high and at humble     Until he became, in a while,   Mordacious, pugnacious,   Rapacious. Good gracious!     They called him the Yankee Carlyle!   But he never took rest   On his quarrelsome quest     Of the giants, both mighty and small.   He slated, distorted them,   Hanged them and quartered them,   Till he had slaughtered them         All.     And this is _The Moral_ that lies in the verse:   If you have a go farther, you're apt to fare worse.   (When you turn it around it is different rather:--   You're not apt to go worse if you have a fair father!)    [Illustration]       How Rudeness and Kindness Were Justly Rewarded     Once on a time, long years ago     (Just when I quite forget),   Two maidens lived beside the Po,     One blonde and one brunette.   The blonde one's character was mild,   From morning until night she smiled,   Whereas the one whose hair was brown   Did little else than pine and frown.     (_I_ think one ought to draw the line     At girls who always frown and pine!)    The blonde one learned to play the harp,     Like all accomplished dames,   And trained her voice to take _C_ sharp     As well as Emma Eames;   Made baskets out of scented grass,   And paper-weights of hammered brass,   And lots of other odds and ends   For gentleman and lady friends.     (_I_ think it takes a deal of sense     To manufacture gifts for gents!)    The dark one wore an air of gloom,     Proclaimed the world a bore,   And took her breakfast in her room     Three mornings out of four.   With crankiness she seemed imbued,   And everything she said was rude:   She sniffed, and sneered, and, what is more,   When very much provoked, she swore!     (_I_ think that I could never care     For any girl who'd learned to swear!)    One day the blonde was striding past     A forest, all alone,   When all at once her eyes she cast     Upon a wrinkled crone,   Who tottered near with shaking knees,   And said: \"A penny, if you please!\"   And you will learn with some surprise   This was a fairy in disguise!     (_I_ think it must be hard to know     A fairy who's incognito!)    The maiden filled her trembling palms     With coinage of the realm.   The fairy said: \"Take back your alms!     My heart they overwhelm.   Henceforth at every word shall slip   A pearl or ruby from your lip!\"   And, when the girl got home that night,--   She found the fairy's words were right!     (_I_ think there are not many girls     Whose words are worth their weight in pearls!)    [Illustration]    It happened that the cross brunette,     Ten minutes later, came   Along the self-same road, and met     That bent and wrinkled dame,   Who asked her humbly for a sou.   The girl replied: \"Get out with you!\"   The fairy cried: \"Each word you drop,   A toad from out your mouth shall hop!\"     (_I_ think that nothing incommodes     One's speech like uninvited toads!)    And so it was, the cheerful blonde     Lived on in joy and bliss,   And grew pecunious, beyond     The dreams of avarice!   And to a nice young man was wed,   And I have often heard it said   No other man who ever walked   Most loved his wife when most she talked!     (_I_ think this very fact, forsooth,     Goes far to prove I tell the truth!)    The cross brunette the fairy's joke     By hook or crook survived,   But still at every word she spoke     An ugly toad arrived,   Until at last she had to come   To feigning she was wholly dumb,   Whereat the suitors swarmed around,   And soon a wealthy mate she found.     (_I_ think nobody ever knew     The happier husband of the two!)     _The Moral_ of the tale is: Bah!   _Nous avons changé tout celà._   No clear idea I hope to strike   Of what _your_ nicest girl is like,   But she whose best young man _I_ am   Is not an oyster, nor a clam!    [Illustration: _This shows why each suitor, who rode up to spark,                  Would mark the toad maybe, but ne'er toed the mark._]       How Beauty Contrived to Get Square with the Beast     Miss Guinevere Platt   Was so beautiful that     She couldn't remember the day   When one of her swains   Hadn't taken the pains     To send her a mammoth bouquet.   And the postman had found,   On the whole of his round,     That no one received such a lot   Of bulky epistles   As, waiting his whistles,     The beautiful Guinevere got!    [Illustration]    A significant sign   That her charm was divine     Was seen in society, when   The chaperons sniffed   With their eyebrows alift:     \"Whatever's got into the men?\"   There was always a man   Who was holding her fan,     And twenty that danced in details,   And a couple of mourners,   Who brooded in corners,     And gnawed their mustaches and nails.    John Jeremy Platt   Wouldn't stay in the flat,     For his beautiful daughter he missed:   When he'd taken his tub,   He would hie to his club,     And dally with poker or whist.   At the end of a year   It was perfectly clear     That he'd never computed the cost,   For he hadn't a penny   To settle the many     Ten thousands of dollars he'd lost!    F. Ferdinand Fife   Was a student of life:     He was coarse, and excessively fat,   With a beard like a goat's,   But he held all the notes     Of ruined John Jeremy Platt!   With an adamant smile   That was brimming with guile,     He said: \"I am took with the face   Of your beautiful daughter,   And wed me she ought ter,     To save you from utter disgrace!\"    Miss Guinevere Platt   Didn't hesitate at     Her duty's imperative call.   When they looked "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23031"],["title","Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands (#1)"],["body","to picture stealing over my patient's waxen face after long and precarious illness.  Before long it was very natural that I should seek to extend my practice; and so I found other patients in the dogs and cats around me. Many luckless brutes were made to simulate diseases which were raging among their owners, and had forced down their reluctant throats the remedies which I deemed most likely to suit their supposed complaints. And after a time I rose still higher in my ambition; and despairing of finding another human patient, I proceeded to try my simples and essences upon--myself.  When I was about twelve years old I was more frequently at my mother's house, and used to assist her in her duties; very often sharing with her the task of attending upon invalid officers or their wives, who came to her house from the adjacent camp at Up-Park, or the military station at Newcastle.  As I grew into womanhood, I began to indulge that longing to travel which will never leave me while I have health and vigour. I was never weary of tracing upon an old map the route to England; and never followed with my gaze the stately ships homeward bound without longing to be in them, and see the blue hills of Jamaica fade into the distance. At that time it seemed most improbable that these girlish wishes should be gratified; but circumstances, which I need not explain, enabled me to accompany some relatives to England while I was yet a very young woman.  I shall never forget my first impressions of London. Of course, I am not going to bore the reader with them; but they are as vivid now as though the year 18-- (I had very nearly let my age slip then) had not been long ago numbered with the past. Strangely enough, some of the most vivid of my recollections are the efforts of the London street-boys to poke fun at my and my companion's complexion. I am only a little brown--a few shades duskier than the brunettes whom you all admire so much; but my companion was very dark, and a fair (if I can apply the term to her) subject for their rude wit. She was hot-tempered, poor thing! and as there were no policemen to awe the boys and turn our servants' heads in those days, our progress through the London streets was sometimes a rather chequered one.  I remained in England, upon the occasion of my first visit, about a year; and then returned to Kingston. Before long I again started for London, bringing with me this time a large stock of West Indian preserves and pickles for sale. After remaining two years here, I again started home; and on the way my life and adventures were very nearly brought to a premature conclusion. Christmas-day had been kept very merrily on board our ship the \"Velusia;\" and on the following day a fire broke out in the hold. I dare say it would have resisted all the crew's efforts to put it out, had not another ship appeared in sight; upon which the fire quietly allowed itself to be extinguished. Although considerably alarmed, I did not lose my senses; but during the time when the contest between fire and water was doubtful, I entered into an amicable arrangement with the ship's cook, whereby, in consideration of two pounds--which I was not, however, to pay until the crisis arrived--he agreed to lash me on to a large hen-coop.  Before I had been long in Jamaica I started upon other trips, many of them undertaken with a view to gain. Thus I spent some time in New Providence, bringing home with me a large collection of handsome shells and rare shell-work, which created quite a sensation in Kingston, and had a rapid sale; I visited also Hayti and Cuba. But I hasten onward in my narrative.  Returned to Kingston, I nursed my old indulgent patroness in her last long illness. After she died, in my arms, I went to my mother's house, where I stayed, making myself useful in a variety of ways, and learning a great deal of Creole medicinal art, until I couldn't find courage to say \"no\" to a certain arrangement timidly proposed by Mr. Seacole, but married him, and took him down to Black River, where we established a store. Poor man! he was very delicate; and before I undertook the charge of him, several doctors had expressed most unfavourable opinions of his health. I kept him alive by kind nursing and attention as long as I could; but at last he grew so ill that we left Black River, and returned to my mother's house at Kingston. Within a month of our arrival there he died. This was my first great trouble, and I felt it bitterly. For days I never stirred--lost to all that passed around me in a dull stupor of despair. If you had told me that the time would soon come when I should remember this sorrow calmly, I should not have believed it possible: and yet it was so. I do not think that we hot-blooded Creoles sorrow less for showing it so impetuously; but I do think that the sharp edge of our grief wears down sooner than theirs who preserve an outward demeanour of calmness, and nurse their woe secretly in their hearts.     CHAPTER II.      STRUGGLES FOR LIFE--THE CHOLERA IN JAMAICA--I LEAVE     KINGSTON FOR THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA--CHAGRES, NAVY BAY,     AND GATUN--LIFE IN PANAMA--UP THE RIVER CHAGRES TO     GORGONA AND CRUCES.   I had one other great grief to master--the loss of my mother, and then I was left alone to battle with the world as best I might. The struggles which it cost me to succeed in life were sometimes very trying; nor have they ended yet. But I have always turned a bold front to fortune, and taken, and shall continue to take, as my brave friends in the army and navy have shown me how, \"my hurts before.\" Although it was no easy thing for a widow to make ends meet, I never allowed myself to know what repining or depression was, and so succeeded in gaining not only my daily bread, but many comforts besides from the beginning. Indeed, my experience of the world--it is not finished yet, but I do not think it will give me reason to change my opinion--leads me to the conclusion that it is by no means the hard bad world which some selfish people would have us believe it. It may be as my editor says--      \"That gently comes the world to those     That are cast in gentle mould;\"  hinting at the same time, politely, that the rule may apply to me personally. And perhaps he is right, for although I was always a hearty, strong woman--plain-spoken people might say stout--I think my heart is soft enough.  How slowly and gradually I succeeded in life, need not be told at length. My fortunes underwent the variations which befall all. Sometimes I was rich one day, and poor the next. I never thought too exclusively of money, believing rather that we were born to be happy, and that the surest way to be wretched is to prize it overmuch. Had I done so, I should have mourned over many a promising speculation proving a failure, over many a pan of preserves or guava jelly burnt in the making; and perhaps lost my mind when the great fire of 1843, which devastated Kingston, burnt down my poor home. As it was, I very nearly lost my life, for I would not leave my house until every chance of saving it had gone, and it was wrapped in flames. But, of course, I set to work again in a humbler way, and rebuilt my house by degrees, and restocked it, succeeding better than before; for I had gained a reputation as a skilful nurse and doctress, and my house was always full of invalid officers and their wives from Newcastle, or the adjacent Up-Park Camp. Sometimes I had a naval or military surgeon under my roof, from whom I never failed to glean instruction, given, when they learned my love for their profession, with a readiness and kindness I am never likely to forget. Many of these kind friends are alive now. I met with some when my adventures had carried me to the battle-fields of the Crimea; and to those whose eyes may rest upon these pages I again offer my acknowledgments for their past kindness, which helped me to be useful to my kind in many lands.  And here I may take the opportunity of explaining that it was from a confidence in my own powers, and not at all from necessity, that I remained an unprotected female. Indeed, I do not mind confessing to my reader, in a friendly confidential way, that one of the hardest struggles of my life in Kingston was to resist the pressing candidates for the late Mr. Seacole's shoes.  Officers of high rank sometimes took up their abode in my house. Others of inferior rank were familiar with me, long before their bravery, and, alas! too often death, in the Crimea, made them world famous. There were few officers of the 97th to whom Mother Seacole was not well known, before she joined them in front of Sebastopol; and among the best known was good-hearted, loveable, noble H---- V----, whose death shocked me so terribly, and with whose useful heroic life the English public have become so familiar. I can hear the ring of his boyish laughter even now.  In the year 1850, the cholera swept over the island of Jamaica with terrible force. Our idea--perhaps an unfounded one--was, that a steamer from New Orleans was the means of introducing it into the island. Anyhow, they sent some clothes on shore to be washed, and poor Dolly Johnson, the washerwoman, whom we all knew, sickened and died of the terrible disease. While the cholera raged, I had but too many opportunities of watching its nature, and from a Dr. B----, who was then lodging in my house, received many hints as to its treatment which I afterwards found invaluable.  Early in the same year my brother had left Kingston for the Isthmus of Panama, then the great high-road to and from golden California, where he had established a considerable store and hotel. Ever since he had done so, I had found some difficulty in checking my reviving disposition to roam, and at last persuading myself that I might be of use to him (he was far from strong), I resigned my house into the hands of a cousin, and made arrangements to journey to Chagres. Having come to this conclusion, I"]]]
