Nur in solchen engeren Kreisen, nur unter Männern, welche Gleichheit der Studien zu einander hinzieht, sind mündliche Discussionen möglich. Ohne diese Art der Erörterung, ohne Ansicht der gesammelten, oft schwer zu bestimmenden, und darum streitigen Naturkörper, würde der freimüthige Verkehr Wahrheit-suchender Männer eines belebenden Princips beraubt sein.  Unter den Anstalten, welche in dieser Stadt zur Aufnahme der Gesellschaft getroffen worden sind, hat man vorzuglich auf die Möglichkeit einer solchen Absonderung in Sectionen Rücksicht genommen. Die Hoffnung, dass diese Vorkehrungen sich Ihres Beifalls erfreuen werden, legt mir die Pflicht auf, hier in Erinnerung zu bringen, dass, obgleich Ihr Vertrauen zweien Reisenden zugleich die Geschäftsführung übertragen hat, doch nur einem allein, meinem edlen Freunde, Herrn Lichtenstein, das Verdienst sorgsamer Vorsicht und rastloser Thätigkeit zukommt. Den wissenschaftlichen Geist achtend, der die Gesellschaft deutscher Naturforscher und Ärzte beseelt, und die Nützlichkeit ihres Bestrebens anerkennend, ist das Königliche Ministerium des Unterrichts, seit vielen Monaten, jedem unsrer Wünsche mit der aufopferndsten Bereitwilligkeit zuvorgekommen.  In der Nähe der Versammlungsorte, welche auf diese Weise für ihre allgemeinen und besondern Arbeiten vorbereitet worden, erheben sich die Museen, welche der Zergliederungskunst, der Zoologie, der Oryktognosie und der Gebirgskunde gewidmet sind. Sie liefern dem Naturforscher einen reichen Stoff der Beobachtung und vielfache Gegenstände kritischer Discussionen. Der grössere Theil dieser wohlgeordneten Sammlungen zählt, wie die Universität zu Berlin, noch nicht zwei Decennien; die ältesten, zu welchen der botanische Garten (einer der reichsten in Europa) gehört, sind in dieser Periode nicht bloss vermehrt, sondern gänzlich umgeschaffen worden. Der frohe und lehrreiche Genuss, den solche Institute gewähren, erinnert mit tiefem Dankgefühle, dass sie das Werk des erhabenen Monarchen sind, der, geräuschlos, in einfacher Grösse, jedes Jahr diese Königsstadt mit neuen Schätzen der Natur und der Kunst ausschmückt, und, was einen noch höheren Werth hat, als diese Schätze selbst, was dem preussischen Volke jugendliche Kraft und inneres Leben und gemüthvolle Anhänglichkeit an das alte Herrscherhaus giebt, der sich huldreich jedem Talente zuneigt, und freier Ausbildung des Geistes vertrauensvoll seinen königlichen Schutz verleiht."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22665"],["title","Christian Gellert's Last Christmas (#1)"],["body","scoff, and oppose: and what was just gushing as an aspiration from the soul, is converted to a confused absurdity.  At such a time, the spirit, courageous and self-dependent, must take refuge in itself and show a firm front to a world of foes.  A strong nature boldly hurls his inkstand at the Devil's head; goes to battle with his opponents with words both written and spoken; and keeps his own individuality free from the perplexities with which opponents disturb all that has been previously done, and make the soul unsteadfast and unnerved for what is to come.  Gellert's was no battling, defiant nature, which relies upon itself; he did not hurl his opponents down and go his way; he would convince them, and so they were always ready to encounter him. And as the applause of his friends rejoiced him, so the opposition of his enemies could sink him in deep dejection. Besides, he had always been weakly; he had, as he himself complained, in addition to frequent coughs and a pain in his loins, a continual gnawing and pressure in the centre of his chest, which accompanied him from his first rising in the morning until he slept at night.  Thus he sat for a while, in deep dejection: and, as often before, his only wish was, that God would give him grace whereby when his hour was come, he might die piously and tranquilly.  It was past midnight when he sought his bed and extinguished his light.  And the buckets at the well go up and go down.  About the same hour, in Duben Forest, the rustic Christopher was rising from his bed. As with steel and flint he scattered sparks upon the tinder, in kindling himself a light, his wife, awaking, cried:  “Why that heavy sigh?”  “Ah! life is a burden: I 'm the most harassed mortal in the world. The pettiest office-clerk may now be abed in peace, and need n't break off his sleep, while I must go out and brave wind and weather.”  “Be content,” replied his wife: “why, I dreamt you had actually been made magistrate, and wore something on your head like a king's crown.”  “Oh! you women; as though what you see is n't enough, you like to chatter about what you dream.”  “Light the lamp, too,” said his wife, “and I 'll get up and make you a nice porridge.”  The peasant, putting a candle in his lantern, went to the stable; and after he had given some fodder to the horses, he seated himself upon the manger. With his hands squeezed between his knees and his head bent down, he reflected over and over again what a wretched existence he had of it. “Why,” thought he, “are so many men so well-off, so comfortable, whilst you must be always toiling? What care I if envy be not a virtue?--and yet I 'm not envious, I don't grudge others being well-off, only I should like to be well-off too; oh, for a quiet, easy life! Am I not worse off than a horse? He gets his fodder at the proper time, and takes no care about it. Why did my father make my brother a minister? He gets his salary without any trouble, sits in a warm room, has no care in the world; and I must slave and torment myself.”  Strange to say, his very next thought, that he would like to be made local magistrate, he would in no wise confess to himself.  He sat still a long while; then he went back again to the sitting-room, past the kitchen, where the fire was burning cheerily. He seated himself at the table and waited for his morning porridge. On the table lay an open book; his children had been reading it the previous evening: involuntarily taking it up, he began to read. Suddenly he started, rubbed his eyes, and then read again. How comes this verse here just at this moment? He kept his hand upon the book, and so easily had he caught the words, that he repeated them to himself softly with his lips, and nodded several times, as much as to say: “That's true!” And he said aloud: “It's all there together: short and sweet!” and he was still staring at it, when his wife brought in the smoking porridge. Taking off his cap, he folded his hands and said aloud:      “Accept God's gifts with resignation,         Content to lack what thou hast not:     In every lot there 's consolation;         There 's trouble, too, in every lot!”  The wife looked at her husband with amazement. What a strange expression was upon his face! And as he sat down and began to eat, she said: “What is the meaning of that grace? What has come to you? Where did you find it?”  “It is the best of all graces, the very best,--real God's word. Yes, and all your life you 've never made such nice porridge before. You must have put something special in it!”  “I don't know what you mean. Stop! There 's the book lying there--ah! that's it--and it's by Gellert, of Leipzig.”  “What! Gellert, of Leipzig! Men with ideas like that don't live now; there may have been such, a thousand years ago, in holy lands, not among us; those are the words of a saint of old.”  “And I tell you they are by Gellert, of Leipzig, of whom your brother has told us; in fact, he was his tutor, and have n't you heard how pious and good he is?”  “I would n't have believed that such men still lived, and so near us, too, as Leipzig.”  “Well, but those who lived a thousand years ago were also once living creatures: and over Leipzig is just the same heaven, and the same sun shines, and the same God rules, as over all other cities.”  “Oh! yes, my brother has an apt pupil in you!”  “Well, and why not? I 've treasured up all he told us of Professor Gellert.”  “Professor!”  “Yes, Professor!”  “A man with such a proud, new-fangled title could n't write anything like that!”  “He did n't give himself the title, and he is poor enough withal! and how hard it has fared with him! Even from childhood he has been well acquainted with poverty: his father was a poor minister in Haynichen, with thirteen children; and Gellert, when quite a little fellow, was obliged to be a copying office-clerk: who can tell whether he did n't then contract that physical weakness of his? And now that he 's an old man, things will never go better with him; he has often no wood, and must be pinched with cold. It is with him, perhaps, as with that student of whom your brother has told us, who is as poor as a rat, and yet must read; and so in winter he lies in bed with an empty stomach, until day is far advanced; and he has his book before him, and first he takes out one hand to hold his book, and then, when that is numb with cold, the other. Ah! tongue cannot tell how poorly the man must live; and yet your brother has told me, if he has but a few pounds, he does n't think at all of himself; he always looks out for one still poorer than he is, and then gives all away: and he 's always engaged in aiding and assisting others. Oh! dear, and yet he is so poor! May be at this moment he is hungry and cold; and he is said to be in ill-health, besides.”  “Wife, I would willingly do the man a good turn if I could. If, now, he had some land, I would plough, and sow, and reap, and carry, and thresh by the week together for him. I should like to pay him attention in such a way that he might know there was at least one who cared for him. But his profession is one in which I can't be of any use to him.”  “Well, just seek him out and speak with him once; you are going to-day, you know, with your wood to Leipzig. Seek him out and thank him; that sort of thing does such a man's heart good. Anybody can see him.”  “Yes, yes; I should like much to see him, and hold out to him my hand,--but not empty: I wish I had something!”  “Speak to your brother, and get him to give you a note to him.”  “No, no; say nothing to my brother; but it might be possible for me to meet him in the street. Give me my Sunday coat; it will come to no harm under my cloak.”  When his wife brought him the coat, she said: “If, now, Gellert had a wife, or a household of his own, one might send him something; but your brother says he is a bachelor, and lives quite alone.”  Christopher had never before so cheerfully harnessed his horses and put them to his wood-laden wagon; for a long while he had not given his hand so gayly to his wife at parting as to-day. Now he started with his heavily-laden vehicle through the village; the wheels creaked and crackled in the snow. At the parsonage he stopped, and looked away yonder where his brother was still sleeping; he thought he would wake him and tell him his intention: but suddenly he whipped up his horses, and continued his route. He would n't yet bind himself to his intention--perchance it was but a passing thought; he does n't own that to himself, but he says to himself that he will surprise his brother with the news of what he has done; and then his thoughts wandered away to the good man still sleeping yonder in the city; and he hummed the verse to himself in an old familiar tune.  Wonderfully in life do effects manifest them-selves, of which we have no trace. Gellert, too, heard in his dreams a singing; he knew not what it was, but it rang so consolingly, so joyously!... Christopher drove on, and he felt as though a bandage had been taken from his eyes; he reflected what a nice house, what a bonny wife and rosy children he had, and how warm the cloak which he had thrown over him was, and how well off were both man and beast; and through the still night he drove along, and beside him sat a spirit; but not an illusion of the brain, such as in olden time men conjured up to their terror, a good spirit sat beside him--beside the woodman who his whole life long had never believed that anything could have power over him but what had hands and feet.  It is said that, on troublous nights, evil spirits settle upon the necks of men, and belabor them so that they gasp and sweat for very terror; quite another sort it was to-day which sat by the woodman: and his heart was warm, and its beating quick.  In ancient times, men also carried loads of wood through the night, that heretics might be burned thereon: these men thought they were doing a good deed in helping to execute justice;"]]]
