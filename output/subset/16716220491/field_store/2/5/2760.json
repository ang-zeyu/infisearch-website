It changed the course of his vessel only a little, but that little sufficed to send the cutwater of the _Cormorant_ straight into the port bows of the _Lively Poll_ with a tremendous crash, for a smart breeze was blowing at the time.  The bulwarks were cut down to the deck, and, as the _Cormorant_ recoiled and again surged ahead, the bowsprit was carried away, and part of the topmast brought down.  Deep and fierce was the growl that burst from Lockley's lips at this disaster, but that did not mend matters.  The result was that the _Lively Poll_ had to quit the fleet a week before her time of eight weeks afloat was up, and run to Yarmouth for repairs.  Next day, however, it fell calm, and several days elapsed before she finally made her port.  Meanwhile Fred Martin reached London, with his feverish complaint greatly aggravated, and his undressed wound much worse.  In London he was detained some hours by his employers, and then sent on to Yarmouth, which he reached late in the afternoon, and ultimately in a state of great suffering and exhaustion, made his way to Gorleston, where his mother lived.  With his mind in a species of wild whirl, and acute pains darting through his wounded hand and arm, he wended his way slowly along the road that led to his mother's house.  Perhaps we should style it her attic, for she could claim only part of the house in which she dwelt. From a quaint gable window of this abode she had a view of the sea over the houses in front.  Part of Fred's route lay along the banks of the Yare, not far from its mouth.  At a spot where there were many old anchors and cables, old and new trawl-beams, and sundry other seafaring rusty and tarry objects, the young fisherman met a pretty young girl, who stopped suddenly, and, with her large blue eyes expressing unspeakable surprise, exclaimed, \"Fred!\"  The youth sprang forward, seized the girl with his uninjured hand, and exclaimed, \"Isa!\" as he drew her towards him.  \"Fred--not here.  Behave!\" said Isa, holding up a warning finger.  Fred consented to behave--with a promise, however, that he would make up for it at a more fitting time and place.  \"But what is the matter!\" asked Isa, with an anxious look, laying her pretty little hands on the youth's arm.  Yes, you need not smile, reader; it is not a perquisite of ladies to have pretty little hands.  Isa's hands were brown, no doubt, like her cheeks, owing to exposure and sunshine, and they were somewhat roughened by honest toil; but they were small and well-shaped, with taper fingers, and their touch was very tender as she clasped them on her lover's arm.  \"Nothing serious,\" replied the youth lightly; \"only an accident with a fish-bone, but it has got to be pretty bad for want of attention; an' besides I'm out o' sorts somehow.  No physic, you see, or doctors in our fleet, like the lucky dogs of the Short-Blue.  I've been knocked up more or less for some weeks past, so they sent me home to be looked after. But I won't need either physic or doctor now.\"  \"No? why not?\" asked the girl, with a simple look.  \"Cause the sight o' your sweet face does away with the need of either.\"  \"Don't talk nonsense, Fred.\"  \"If that's nonsense,\" returned the fisherman, \"you'll never hear me talk sense again as long as I live.  But how about mother, Isa?  Is she well!\"  \"Quite well.  I have just left her puzzling herself over a letter from abroad that's so ill-written that it would bother a schoolmaster to read it.  I tried to read it, but couldn't.  You're a good scholar, Fred, so you have come just in time to help her.  But won't she be surprised to see you!\"  Thus conversing, and walking rather slowly, the pair made their way to the attic of Mrs Martin, where the unexpected sight of her son threw the patient woman into a great flutter of surprise and pleasure.  We use the word \"patient\" advisedly, for Mrs Martin was one of those wholesome-minded creatures who, having to battle vigorously for the bare necessaries of life in the face of many adverse circumstances, carry on the war with a degree of hearty, sweet-tempered resolution which might put to shame many who are better off in every way.  Mrs Martin was a widow and a washerwoman, and had a ne'er-do-well brother, a fisherman, who frequently \"sponged\" upon her.  She also had a mother to support and attend upon, as well as a \"bad leg\" to endure.  True, the attendance on her mother was to the good woman a source of great joy.  It constituted one of the few sunbeams of her existence, but it was not on that account the less costly, for the old woman could do nothing whatever to increase the income of the widow's household--she could not, indeed, move a step without assistance.  Her sole occupation was to sit in the attic window and gaze over the sands upon the sea, smiling hopefully, yet with a touch of sadness in the smile; mouthing her toothless gums, and muttering now and then as if to herself, \"He'll come soon now.\"  Her usual attitude was that of one who listens expectantly.  Thirty years before Granny Martin had stood at the same attic window, an elderly woman even then, looking out upon the raging sea, and muttering anxiously the same words, \"He'll come soon now.\"  But her husband never came.  He was lost at sea.  As years flew by, and time as well as grief weakened her mind, the old woman seemed to forget the flight of time, and spent the greater part of every day in the attic window, evidently on the look-out for some one who was to come \"soon.\"  When at last she was unable to walk alone, and had to be half carried to her seat in the attic window by her strong and loving daughter, the sadness seemed to pass away, and her cheery spirit revived under the impression, apparently, that the coming could not be delayed much longer.  To every one Granny was condescendingly kind, especially to her grandchild Fred, of whom she was very fond.  Only at intervals was the old woman's cheerfulness disturbed, and that was during the occasional visits of her ne'er-do-well son Dick, for he was generally drunk or \"half-seas-over\" when he came.  Granny never mentioned his name when he was absent, and for a long time Mrs Martin supposed that she tried to forget him, but her opinion changed on this point one night when she overheard her mother praying with intense earnestness and in affectionate terms that her dear Dick might yet be saved.  Still, however much or frequently Granny's thoughts might at any time be distracted from their main channel, they invariably returned thereto with the cheerful assurance that \"_he_ would soon come now.\"  \"You're ill, my boy,\" said Mrs Martin, after the first greetings were over.  \"Right you are, mother,\" said the worn-out man, sitting down with a weary sigh.  \"I've done my best to fight it down, but it won't do.\"  \"You must have the doctor, Fred.\"  \"I've had the doctor already, mother.  I parted with Isa Wentworth at the bottom o' the stair, an' she will do me more good than dozens o' doctors or gallons o' physic.\"  But Fred was wrong.  Not long afterwards the _Lively Poll_ arrived in port, and Stephen Lockley hastened to announce his arrival to his wife.  Now it was the experience of Martha Lockley that if, on his regular return to land for his eight days' holiday, after his eight weeks' spell afloat, her handsome and genial husband went straight home, she was wont to have a happy meeting; but if by any chance Stephen first paid a visit to the Blue Boar public-house, she was pretty sure to have a miserable meeting, and a more or less wretched time of it thereafter.  A conversation that Stephen had recently had with Fred Martin having made an impression on him--deeper than he chose to admit even to himself--he had made up his mind to go straight home this time.  \"I'll be down by daybreak to see about them repairs,\" he said to Peter Jay, as they left the _Lively Poll_ together, \"and I'll go round by your old friend, Widow Mooney's, and tell her to expect you some time to-night.\"  Now Peter Jay was a single man, and lodged with Widow Mooney when on shore.  It was not, however, pure consideration for his mate or the widow that influenced Lockley, but his love for the widow's little invalid child, Eve, for whose benefit that North Sea skipper had, in the kindness of his heart, made a special collection of deep-sea shells, with some shreds of bright bunting.  Little Eve Mooney, thin, wasted, and sad, sat propped up with dirty pillows, in a dirty bed, in a dirtier room, close to a broken and paper-patched window that opened upon a coal-yard with a prospect rubbish-heap beyond.  \"Oh, I'm _so_ glad it's you!\" cried Eve, with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, as the fisherman entered.  \"Yes, Eve, my pretty.  I'm back sooner than I expected--and look what I've brought you.  I haven't forgot you.\"  Joy beamed in the lustrous eyes and on every feature of the thin face as the sick child surveyed the treasures of the deep that Lockley spread on her ragged counterpane.  \"How good--how kind of you, Stephen!\" exclaimed Eve.  \"Kind!\" repeated the skipper; \"nothing of the sort, Eve.  To please you pleases me, so it's only selfishness.  But where's your mother?\"  \"Drunk,\" said the child simply, and without the most remote intention of injuring her parent's character.  Indeed, that was past injury.  \"She's in there.\"  The child pointed to a closet, in which Stephen found on the floor a heap of unwomanly rags.  He was unable to arouse the poor creature, who slumbered heavily beneath them.  Eve said she had been there for many hours.  \"She forgot to give me my breakfast before she went in, and I'm too weak to rise and get it for myself,\" whimpered Eve, \"and I'm _so_ hungry! And I got such a fright, too, for a man came in this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23379"],["title","Old Mr. Wiley (#1)"],["body","would bring the pup without fail. She believed that she had read indomitable determination in those piercing black eyes; she knew inwardly that he would not rest until he had found that thing which would give young Frank renewed interest in living.  Although the child appeared, if anything, a trifle less apathetic the following day and Miss Beaver felt that each succeeding visit of old Mr. Wiley with the fox-terrier would give the lad another push toward convalescence, yet the nurse did not feel inclined to mention openly that secret visit in the dead of night. The old gentleman's finger tapping his gravely smiling lips was one thing that restrained her; the other was the irritation betrayed, ingenuously enough, by the boy's mother during her early morning visit to the sickroom.         *       *       *       *       *  Young Mrs. Wiley looked especially pretty in a pleated jade sports skirt, a white pullover sweater, a jade beret on her fair hair. Under one arm she carried a small white Pomeranian about whose neck flared a matching wide jade satin bow.  \"Well, how is Francis this morning?\" she inquired briskly with the determined manner of one dutifully performing an unpleasant task. \"He looks better, doesn't he?\"  Miss Beaver, to whom this inquiry was addressed, nodded shortly.  The boy did not look at his pretty young mother after his first indifferent glance as she entered the room. He lay in silence with closed eyes and compressed lips, a most unchildlike expression on his thin boyish face.  \"Look, Francis! See how sweet Kiki looks with this big green bow!\"  Mrs. Wiley dropped the Pomeranian on the bed. The dog snarled and snapped viciously. Frank thrust out one hand and gave the animal a pettish push. Bestowing a hard, cold glare on her son, Mrs. Wiley snatched up the growling dog in high indignation.  \"There! I ask you, nurse, if that child isn't just unnatural. I thought boys liked dogs. Francis is queer. I believe he actually hates Kiki.\" She lifted the dog against her face, permitting it to loll its pink tongue against her carefully rouged cheek. \"Pwecious ... Was it muvver's own pwecious ikkle Kiki? Francis,\" she addressed her son sharply, \"you'll have to get over your nasty ugliness to poor little Kiki. It's a shame, the way you hate dogs!\"  \"But I don't hate dogs!\" cried the boy vehemently, his voice breaking with indignant resentment. \"It's just Kiki. I'd love to have a little dog of my very own, Mother. If you'd only let me have a little dog of my very own!\" The faint voice died away in a sick wail. The boy's eyelids closed tightly against gushing tears.  Mrs. Wiley gave a short exclamation of impatience.  \"Francis has the idea that a dirty mongrel would be nicer than a beautiful pedigreed dog like Kiki,\" she cried disgustedly.  \"But why not try letting him have a dog of his own?\" asked Miss Beaver ill-advisedly, her interest getting the better of her. \"Perhaps it would give him interest enough ...\"  \"Nonsense!\" snapped Mrs. Wiley sharply. \"I won't have street mutts wandering around the house to irritate poor little Kiki. Nasty smelly common mongrels with fleas. Indeed not. I'm surprised at you, nurse, for making the suggestion.\"  With that, young Mrs. Wiley removed her vivid presence from the room, leaving Miss Beaver shrugging her shoulders and raising her eyebrows. And the little boy crying softly, the sheet pulled over his dark head.  \"What's all this, Frankie?\" asked the father's voice.  \"_She_ won't let me have a dog of my own,\" sobbed the boy, coming out from under the concealing sheet, lips a-quiver, eyes humid.  Miss Beaver's lips compressed. He called his mother \"She\" as if she were an outsider....  Frank Wiley III stood for a moment looking at his son, then let himself gently down on the edge of the bed, laying one big palm on the little chap's hot forehead. He did not speak, just sat and stroked the fevered brow with tenderness. On his face a dark look brooded. His eyes were absent, unhappy.  \"Daddy, why couldn't I have just a _little_ puppy of my own?\"  The father replied with obvious effort.  \"You know, Frankie, we have one small dog already,\" said he with forced lightness.  \"Oh! Kiki!\"  \"Couldn't you manage to make friends with Kiki?\"  \"_She_ doesn't really want Kiki to like me, Daddy.\" (Wise beyond his years, marvelled Miss Beaver.) \"Kiki doesn't really like little boys.\"  \"Oh, my God, Frankie, don't go to crying again! Don't you see that Daddy can't quarrel with Mother over a dog? Try to get well, old man, and we'll see then what we can do. How about a pony, son?\"  The little boy disappeared under the sheet, refusing to reply. Miss Beaver could not bear his convulsive, hardly-controlled sobs, and turned an accusing face upon Frank Wiley III.  \"Is it possible,\" she asked icily, \"that Frank's mother would actually refuse him so small a thing as a puppy, if it meant the merest chance of his getting better?\"  The face turned to hers was gloomy, the voice impatient.  \"Oh, good God! Was ever a man in such a damnable situation? My dear Miss Beaver, ask the doctor to tell you how much influence I have in this household, before you blame me for not taking a firm stand with a woman as nervous and temperamental as Mrs. Wiley. I'd give my life willingly to bring my boy back to health but unhappily I'm not like the founders of our family. Some day I'll show you our family album. You'll find it easy to trace the strong resemblance Frankie has to his forebears. Its the damnably high spirit he gets from them that is so stubbornly killing him now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He rose, wheeled about and went to the door. Paused. Still with that brooding dark look on his face he turned to her again.  \"If my death would make it any easier for Frank, I wouldn't hesitate a moment. I'm a failure. It wouldn't matter. But I feel that by living and watching over him I'm standing between my boy's development as an individual, and the subtlest, softest peril that could possibly threaten him. I would rather he died, if he cannot bring about what he wills for his own development. As for me, I ... I am a dead man walking futilely among the living.\"  With that, he swung out of the room.  Miss Beaver knelt by the boy's bed, murmuring persuasively to him as she strove to make him check his hysterical sobs.  \"Frankie, you really must stop crying. You're too big a chap to cry and it only makes you worse. If you're a good boy to-day and eat your food, I'll let your grandfather bring the little dog tonight,\" she promised rashly.  The sheet turned down and Frank's reddened face peered at her plaintively.  \"That was my _great_-grandfather,\" he assured her gravely.  \"Well, great or great-great, it's all the same,\" she conceded good-humoredly.  \"Do you really think he'll bring Spot tonight?\"  \"Of course he will. But you must eat your meals, take a long nap, and stop crying.\"  \"Oh, I promise!\" the boy cried eagerly.  The day, Miss Beaver was told later, was uneventful. She had remained with the day nurse until Doctor Parris had made his visit. The doctor had been much pleased to find his small patient in good spirits and congratulated himself upon having put Miss Beaver on the case.  \"If our young friend continues to improve like this, Miss Beaver,\" he joked, \"we'll have him playing football within a month.\" He lowered his voice for her ear only. \"Has anything particular come under your notice that might account for this agreeable change?\"  Miss Beaver's forehead wrinkled slightly. She regarded the doctor from narrowed, thoughtful eyes.  \"Tell me, Doctor Parris, if it isn't asking too much, why Mr. Wiley is a Man-Afraid-of-his-Wife?\"  The doctor could not repress an involuntary chuckle.  \"Come now, nurse, don't you think you're asking rather a good deal?\"  \"No, I don't,\" retorted Miss Beaver shortly. \"Nor do you think so, either. What I'm trying to get at is, why Mr. Wiley lets Mrs. Wiley prevent him from giving Frank a puppy that he wants?\"  The doctor regarded her thoughtfully.  \"So it's a pup the boy wants. Ha, hum!\" he uttered.  \"I'm asking you,\" she repeated impatiently.  \"Oh! Eh! Well! Mrs. Wiley, you have undoubtedly discerned, is one of those self-centered egotists who simply cannot permit people to live any way but her way. She won't have another dog in the house because it might interfere with the comfort of that silly damn--excuse me--Pom of hers. If Frank were a bit older and could feign a penchant for the Pom and his mother got the idea that the animal's affection might be alienated from her, she would at once get the child another dog, just to keep him away from Kiki.\"  \"All of which sounds subtle but isn't very helpful,\" decided Miss Beaver with unflattering directness. \"I've told Mr. Wiley that I thought a dog might interest his son and Mr. Wiley replies that his wife won't let him get one. There is something more behind this and it's obvious you don't want to tell me.\"  \"Oh, hang it, nurse! You always manage to get your own way with me, don't you? I'll probably have to marry you one of these days, so I can keep the upper hand,\" he grinned. \"Well, then, Wiley is a weak sister and oughtn't to be. He's completely under his chorus-girl wife's thumb. He lost a good bit in Wall Street and what's left is in her name, so he's got to watch his step until he's recouped his losses.  \"If he were like his father or his grandfather ... but he isn't,\" snapped the doctor vexedly. \"Now, this boy here, he's a throw-back, young Frank is. He's the spittin' image of the founder of the family and I'm willing to wager he's got the grit and determination that once endowed old Frank Wiley I.\"  \"I've observed,\" murmured Miss Beaver, \"that you and his father call the boy Frank, while his mother refers to him as Francis.\"  \"That's her hifalutin way of putting on the dog, nurse,\" Doctor Parris grinned wickedly. \"His name on the birth certificate is Frank but she'd make a girlish Francis of him if she had her own "]]]
