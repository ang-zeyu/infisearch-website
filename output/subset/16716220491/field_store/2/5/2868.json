There was great enthusiasm on board over the news from the seat of war, not only on account of the recent capture of Richmond and Petersburg, but because, during the night, the news had flashed over the wires of the surrender of Lee and the death of the Rebellion. We thus became the bearers of these glorious tidings to Fort Sumter and Charleston.  My reception of the news in New York is thus described in my diary: \"Monday, April 10, Astor House. On coming down from my room this morning, my attention was arrested by the 'big letters' at the head of the column of the morning paper, bearing the announcement of the surrender of General Lee and his whole army. It was pretty big news to take _in_, and contain myself. Passing into the hotel parlors, I noticed that Broadway was gaily decorated with flags (though the rain was descending in torrents), and there read in the _Herald_ the official documents from General Grant, upon which I could hardly refrain from shouting three cheers! I believe I did give one! While waiting for breakfast I ventured, in the enthusiasm of the moment, to seat myself at the piano, and was hard at work on about the only patriotic tune I could drum, viz: 'Tenting on the old camp ground,' when a small boy came up with a message from some nice looking young ladies at the opposite end of the parlor, requesting 'The Star Spangled Banner,' in honor of the glorious news. Well, I didn't exactly fall under the piano; but briefly conveying regrets at my inability to comply, I retired as gracefully as possible.\"  Promptly at noon we waved our adieus from the deck of the \"Oceanus\" to the friends assembled on shore, and steamed slowly down the harbor. The weather was extremely rainy and foggy, and when hardly three hours out, we found ourselves aground on Sandy Hook bar. A pilot was signaled, who brought the report of a heavy storm outside, and after getting us safely off the sand-spit, he advised our \"laying to\" till morning. This was a great disappointment, as there was no time to lose, and some one impatiently asked, \"Can't you take us out this afternoon, pilot?\" \"I reckon I can if you all say so,\" responded the old salt, \"but you'd better lay _here_, to-night!\" \"Why so, pilot?\" \"You gentlemen want to go to Charleston, don't you?\" \"Why, yes, of course.\" \"Wall, then, I tell you, you'd better lay _here_ to-night, for it's goin' to be a werry nasty, dirty night outside.\" That settled the matter, and down went the big anchor of the \"Oceanus.\"  Having eaten but sparingly during the day to avoid sea-sickness, and fully believing that we were firmly anchored for the night, I indulged in a hearty supper, concluding, as my diary says, \"with sardines and oranges.\" I had occasion to feel very sorry for this a few hours later.  A patriotic meeting was held in the cabin during the evening. The music and addresses were very enjoyable, till suddenly the sound of hurrying feet was heard overhead, and the news was whispered round that we were \"weighing anchor.\" Soon we began to feel the uncomfortable rolling of the steamer. The orator who was then addressing the meeting, and who had waxed eloquent with his subject, now provoked considerable merriment by his ungraceful and involuntary gestures, clutching desperately at a chair, then taking a fresh hold of the table to steady himself. It well illustrated Demosthenes' famous rule for oratory, \"Action! action! action!\" But a more serious impression quickly prevailed among the audience, that it was high time to retire, and, like Longfellow's Arabs, they began to \"silently steal away.\" The chairman of the meeting, Mayor Wood, of Brooklyn, unmindful of his usual decorum, upon an extra roll of the steamer went over the back of his chair, and rolled ingloriously upon the floor. He acknowledged that he had never been so completely floored in his life.  There was another portly gentleman who, in attempting to navigate, was caught near the cabin door, just behind the knees, by a friendly chair, and as he was suddenly tilted back into it, remarked somewhat dryly, \"I believe _I'll sit down_!\" Going out on deck, I found that the storm had lifted, the lights of Sandy Hook were far astern, and we were fairly at sea. From this point of time on Monday evening, when we _lay_ on deck, (things were getting too _unsteady_ for landsmen to _stand_,) I omit, out of courtesy to ourselves, any further incidents of the voyage, and pass on to Thursday morning, which found us sitting on the forward deck, waiting and watching for the spires of Charleston. The weather was delightful. As we passed into the warmer southern climate, the sea became calmer and more transparent, schools of porpoises played about the steamer, and one enthusiastic individual insisted that he had seen a whale! but he was set down by one of the disgruntled passengers as \"only a pesky oil speculator.\" The German band on board, or rather the brief remnant of it, still kept up what at the distance of several yards sounded like very dismal music! Presently some one suggested \"lemons and lump sugar,\" as the right remedy for any lingering unpleasantness, and we drew lots as to who should \"go below,\" combat the smells of the cook-room, and purchase them. The announcement that the chance had fallen on my old friend and comrade of the Tenth Rhode Island, William Vaughan, was greeted with roars of laughter. But he got off very much like another fellow described in Pickwick, who spelled his name with a \"double you\" and a \"wee,\" by liberally feeing some one else to go in his place.  About three o'clock in the afternoon came the joyful shout of \"Land-ho!\" which quickly filled the deck of the \"Oceanus\" with a troop of smiling faces. All gloom now gave way to sanguine expectation. We could plainly distinguish the light-ship, bearing the suggestive name, \"Rattlesnake Shoals,\" and knew we were at last off Charleston harbor. A pilot was presently taken on board, who informed the captain that we could not go over the bar till sunset. Some one asked him, \"Are the people over there in Charleston loyal now, pilot?\" He shook his head gravely, and was non-committal. \"Well, then, we've come down here to _make_ you loyal, pilot!\" Turning his keen eye, which had peered into many a northeaster, directly upon his interviewer, the old salt vigorously replied, \"You can't make _me_ loyal, for I always _have_ been!\" Noble words and truly spoken, as we afterwards found.  The sun was still shining brightly in the western horizon as we weighed anchor, and with colors flying and whistle sounding, steamed slowly towards the majestic bay which expands its broad bosom before the city of Charleston. The pilot, dressed in navy blue, stood at the window of the pilot-house, guiding the helmsman and announcing the various points of historic interest.  [Illustration]  Close at hand two buoys marked the spots where the monitors \"Keokuk\" and \"Weehawken\" were sunk; and lashed to a mast-head of the latter, still visible above the water, was a small American flag floating in the breeze. But the attention of all was now suddenly arrested by a more imposing display in the sky. For high above the city the glorious sunset had painted the western heavens with streaming bars of red and white and blue, fringed with gold. It was our banner, stretched out again by a Divine hand, over the recovered city; and all eyes turned to behold the sight, as the shout went up, \"See, the Red, White and Blue! The Red, White and Blue!\" Fort Strong, formerly called Fort Wagner, on Morris Island, was passed with uncovered heads, in honor of Colonel Shaw, who fell gallantly leading his colored regiment to the assault; then Fort Putnam, formerly Battery Gregg, on Cummings' Point, and on the right Fort Moultrie and Battery Bee, on Sullivan's Island, were pointed out, till at length the cry rang out, \"Fort Sumter! Fort Sumter!\" Battered and crumbled almost to shapelessness, it rose before us like some vast monster in the centre of the harbor. As we drew nearer, we could distinguish the sentinels on the ramparts, whose bayonets glistened in the rays of the setting sun.  [Illustration: FORT SUMTER IN RUINS.]  For a few moments we contemplated in silence the storied fortress, as memories of the long and bitter struggle here inaugurated passed in quick procession before us. But victory had come at last, and rebellion had perished. As by a common inspiration, all hearts and voices united in the grand old doxology,       \"Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.\"  It was our good passport to the city, heard and honored at Fort Sumter by the rapid dipping of the colors, while the answering strains of the \"Star Spangled Banner\" echoed and re-echoed o'er the bay.  Passing rapidly on, we soon arrived within hailing distance of our blockading squadron, safely riding at anchor. As we gave each ship and gunboat and monitor, as we passed, the news of Lee's surrender, a scene of the wildest enthusiasm followed, which quickly spread throughout the entire fleet. The sailor boys in blue crowded to the bulwarks, or mounting aloft, manned the yards, climbing even to the main-tops, and turning swung their caps and rent the air with their shouts. \"Hurrah! hurrah! Lee has surrendered! Lee has surrendered!!\" How welcome the tidings after their arduous service.       \"Sweet after danger's the close of the war.\"  The shades of night were falling thickly about us, as we left the fleet astern and came swiftly up to the city, which was shrouded in darkness. From the midst of a crowd of people gathering on the deck ahead of us, a squeaky voice piped out, \"What's the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23846"],["title","The Flag Replaced on Sumter (#2)"],["body","ews?\" and a strong voice gave back the answer:  \"Lee has surrendered with his whole army!\"  Again the piping voice:  \"Have you got Lee?\"  And the reply, with no uncertain sound:  \"Yes, we've got him this time, sure,\" followed by an indescribable medley of southern yelling, cheering and dancing.  Amid the excitement and enthusiasm, the band of the United States steamer \"Blackstone\" struck up the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" to which ours responded with \"My country, 'tis of thee.\" Again from the \"Blackstone,\" \"The Red, White and Blue,\" followed by the martial notes of \"Hail Columbia\" from the \"Oceanus\" as she was made fast to the dock. Captain Hunt, of General Hatch's staff, came aboard promptly, and after exchanging congratulations over the great news, tendered us during our stay the \"freedom of the city.\" We were not expected to avail ourselves of this courtesy till morning; a few of us, however, did get out on southern soil, just to stretch ourselves a bit after our long sea-faring, but encountering rather a suspicious looking crowd, we soon returned on board, to await the morrow, the ever-memorable fourteenth of April, 1865.  The day dawned at length, mild and verdant with the breath of spring,               \"And o'er the bay,      Slowly, in all his splendors dight,      The great sun rises to behold the sight.\"  Turning toward the city we could easily distinguish the long line of edifices along the Battery, their windows glittering in the yellow sunshine. Quickly dressing, we set forth on a ramble through the deserted metropolis. There was plenty of time, as the transports were not to leave for Fort Sumter till ten o'clock. Vaughan and I sauntered down East Bay street, among the crumbling and deserted warehouses, to the Battery. This was a long and straight promenade, with stone pavement, commanding a fine prospect of the bay and fortifications. Here, four years before, all was activity and bustle; here the populace assembled, and sent up their frenzied shouts as the flag of the Republic was lowered, and the ensign of Rebellion supplanted it for a season.  How changed the scene! The streets were deserted. The crowds were scattered and gone forever! The silence of desolation reigned on every hand, disturbed only by the songs of the summer birds. Not even a newsboy assailed us with the _Mercury_ or _Courier_, containing an account of the latest victory over the Yankees. Here, along the Battery, were many of the finest residences, stately mansions with broad verandas, which bore the terrible effects of the long bombardment. Their walls were scarred and rent. The roofs were crushed, the glass shattered, piles of rubbish and other débris encumbered the ground, and the grass was growing in the streets. The siege of the city had steadily and relentlessly continued for five hundred and eighty-eight days. It was commenced on the twenty-first of August, 1863, by the opening of the Swamp Angel Battery on Morris Island, five miles away. On the seventh of September, Fort Wagner and Battery Gregg were taken, and more guns were trained upon the city (notably the water battery), compelling the evacuation of the lower part. During the long siege not less than thirteen thousand shot and shell were thrown into the city.  We strolled into the garden of one of the deserted mansions, which still exhibited evidences of taste and culture, even in neglect and decay. Borders of box lined the graveled walks and encircled beautiful flower shrubs, or clusters of japonica, of manifold hues; the mock-orange, the lilac and magnolia tree were blooming luxuriantly, and grew to a remarkable height. What a contrast to the bare gardens we had left at home, amid a cold and cheerless storm. We were now in another zone, in the full bloom of summer. After helping ourselves to roses in abundance, the largest I had ever seen, we passed on up the street. Notices like the following were posted on the doors of some of the houses: \"Occupied by permission of the Provost Marshal, the owner having taken the oath of allegiance to the United States.\" Similar cards in the shop windows announced that the occupants had permission to transact business.  A Charleston lady complained to one of our officers, saying, \"_You_ treat us well enough, but _the niggers_ are _dreadful_ sassy. They don't turn out now when you meet them; they even smoke cigars, and go right up to a gentleman and ask him for a light!\"  [Illustration]  We now began to meet contrabands of all ages and of all sizes, from the little barefooted piccaninnies and chimney sweeps to the old, gray-haired uncles and turbaned aunties. While all appeared bubbling over with joy, yet they were quiet and orderly, greeting us with bows and courtesies, and a \"God bress ye! we're so powerful glad ye've come!\" Said one old negro to another, \"Yer mus' try now, an' do as yer done by, Uncle Rube.\" \"Yeth,\" said Uncle Reuben, \"but de fact am _dis_ chile ain't never been _done by_! Dat's where de shoe pinches!\"  We took great pleasure in calling with other friends upon Colonel Lorenzo Potter, one of the veteran Union citizens, formerly of Providence. He had been at home only a few weeks, but his family had remained through the long and dreary siege. Fortunately the shells from the Union batteries had spared the home of these devoted loyalists.  I remember a fine fig-tree in his garden, laden with fruit, and my disappointment at finding it in a green state, \"for the time of figs was not yet.\" Reluctantly leaving this hospitable family, we made a hasty tour of several public buildings and banks, which we found in a sadly _broken_ and ravaged condition. The elaborately carved counters and wainscoting had been reduced to fragments; the tiled floors and frescoed walls were plowed up and ruined by exploding shells. In one of the banks I secured a collection of both Continental and Confederate notes, the obsolete currency of two centuries. On one of them I read this curious endorsement: \"Payable two years after a treaty of peace between the Confederate and United States Governments.\" But right before me lay the effective protest of the Union shot and shell against any treaty of peace with armed rebellion, in the shape of an immense pile of débris,--broken brick and glass, and charred timbers, the ruins of a once fine and imposing structure. I was told of an estimable lady of Charleston who, after investing her all (fully $5,000) in these Confederate \"promises to pay,\" brought them out at last, and kindled her morning fire with the worthless chaff. Most of the citizens who were considered wealthy at the beginning of the war were reduced to penury at its close, and were to be seen carrying their rations through the streets of Charleston.  \"General Wade Hampton needs horses,\" read the last order of the Governor to the citizens, on the twenty-first of January, 1865, \"and I have told him he shall have them. Put aside your please-carriages for the time, and bring or send in your horses to Columbia. Colonel C.T. Hampton is charged by me with the duty of receiving with thanks all that will be sent, and of _taking_ all that are withheld. The horses will be paid for. No one shall suffer from his devotion to the State.\"  The public conveyances kindly placed at our disposal by the authorities, showed how effectively this order had been carried out. Such a sorry looking set of horses, mules and donkeys, attached to omnibuses, army ambulances and fish-wagons, would appropriately have found a place in a Providence Antique and Horrible procession!  Passing on to the Market Building we stopped to chat with the darkey shop-keepers who occupied the few stalls which were open. We purchased here some sugar-cane and strawberries, the first of the season. The darkeys proved to be pretty shrewd traders, and promptly declined all offers of Confederate currency in payment. One shook his woolly head, saying, \"O, sar, we'd better _gib_ um to you, sar!\" They had evidently acquired some of the sharpness of their old masters, one of whom I read about used to make his negroes _whistle_ while they were picking cherries, for fear they would _eat_ some! But now they could sing their Jubilee hymn, as their colored brethren sung it, marching through Richmond:       \"De whip is lost, de han'cuf broken,      An' massa'l hab to _whistle_ for his _pay_;      He's ole enough, big enough, an' ought to known better      Dan to went an' run'd away:              Ole massa run, ha! ha!              De darkey stay, ho! ho!              It mus' be now dat de kingdom's cummin',              An' de year of Jubilo!\"  Some ragged negro boys on the street, who, by the way they danced, appeared to have india-rubber joints, and who ended their songs with a \"shout\" and a \"break-down,\" were asked if they knew the John Brown song.  \"Oh, yeth, massa; we know ole John Brown.\"  \"Well, give it to us then.\"       \"John Brown's body lies a mold'ring in de clay,      But his soul am a marchin' home!\"  \"Good! give us some more!\"       \"We'll hang Jeff Davis on a sour apple tree,      On Canaan's happy _sho'_!\"  Some of them doubtless still sing the new version, believing that Jeff Davis will yet be hung, on Canaan's happy shore; and so they are all \"bound for the happy land of Canaan!\" It has been stated as an indisputable _fact_, that some of the older negroes having never heard their masters mention the name of a Yankee except with a profane accompaniment, have been praying for years, \"O Lord! bress, we beseech Thee, and speedily bring along de comin' of de _dam_ Yankees!\"  Retracing our steps towards the steamer, we met our friends coming from various directions. Some of them would have passed for returning miners, who, in lieu of rich booty, were heavily laden with relics of stone, brass and iron. While these Yankee relic-hunters failed in getting away with old Fort Sumter itself, they successfully carried off two six-hundred pound shots from the great English Blakely gun, (sent over to"]]]
