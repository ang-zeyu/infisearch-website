Being led by the augur into the citadel, he sat down on a stone, with his face looking towards the south, and on his left hand sat the augur, having his head covered and in his hand an augur's staff, which is a wand bent at the end and having no knot. Then looking towards the city and the country round about, he offered prayers to the Gods and marked out the region of the sky from the sunrising to the sunsetting; the parts towards the south he called the right, and the parts towards the north he called the left; and he set a boundary before as far as his eye could reach. After this he took his staff in his left hand and laid his right on the head of Numa, praying in these words: \"Father Jupiter, if it be thy will that this Numa Pompilius, whose head I hold, should be King of Rome, show us, I pray thee, clear tokens of this thy will within the space which I have marked out.\" He then named the tokens which he desired, and when they had been shown, Numa was declared to be King.  King Numa, considering that the city was but newly founded, and that by violence and force, conceived that he ought to found it anew, giving it justice and laws and religion; and that he might soften the manners and tempers of the people, he would have them cease awhile from war. To this end he built a temple of Janus, by which it might be signified whether there was peace or war in the State; for, if it were peace, the gates of the temple should be shut, but if it were war, they should be open. Twice only were the gates shut after the days of Numa; for the first time when Titus Manlius was Consul, after the ending of the first war against Carthage, and for the second time when the Emperor Augustus, after vanquishing Antony at Actium, established universal peace both by land and sea. This temple then King Numa built, and shut the gates thereof, having first made treaties of peace with the nations round about.  Many other things did King Numa set in order for his people. First he divided the year into twelve months, each month being according to the course of the moon, and in every twenty-fourth year another month, that the year might so agree with the course of the sun. Also he appointed certain lawful days for business, and other days on which nothing might be done. He made priests also, of whom the chief was the priest of Jupiter, to whom he gave splendid apparel and a chair of ivory. Two other priests he made, one of Mars, and the other of Quirinus, that is to say, of Romulus the god. And he chose virgins for the service of Vesta, who should keep alive the sacred fire, and twelve priests of Mars, whom he called the Salii, to be keepers of the sacred shield. (This shield, men said, fell down from heaven, and that it might be kept the more safely, King Numa commanded that they should make eleven other shields like unto it.) This shield and its fellows the Salii were to carry through the city, having on flowered tunics and breastplates of brass, and dancing and singing hymns. And many other things as to the worship of the gods, and the interpreting of signs, and the dealing with marvels and portents, King Numa set in order. And that the people might regard these laws and customs with the more reverence, he gave out that he had not devised them of his own wit, but that he had learnt them from a certain goddess whose name was Egeria, whom he was wont to meet in a grove that was hard by the city.  King Numa died, having reigned forty and three years; and the people chose in his room one Tullus Hostilius.     CHAPTER II. ~~ THE STORY OF ALBA.  King Tullus Hostilius, being newly come to the throne, looked about for an occasion of war; for the Romans had now for a long time been at peace. Now it chanced that in those days the men of Rome and the men of Alba had a quarrel, the one against the other, the country folk being wont to cross the border and to plunder their neighbours; and that ambassadors were sent from either city to seek restitution of such things as had been carried off. King Tullus said to his ambassador, \"Delay not to do your business so soon as ye shall be come to Alba;\" knowing that the men of Alba would certainly refuse to deliver up the things, and thinking that he could thus with a good conscience proclaim war against them. As for the ambassadors of Alba, when they were come to Rome, they made no haste about their business, but ate and drank, the King entertaining them with much courtesy and kindness. While therefore they feasted with him, there came back the ambassadors of Rome telling the King how they had made demand for the things carried off, and when the men of Alba had refused to deliver them, had declared war within the space of thirty days. Which when the King heard, he called to him the ambassadors of Alba, and said to them, \"Wherefore are ye come to Rome? Set forth now your mission.\" Then the men, not knowing what had befallen, began to make excuse, saying, \"We would not willingly say aught that should displease the King, but we are constrained by them that have sent us thither. We are come to ask for the things that your country folk have carried off. And, if ye will not deliver them up, we are bidden to declare war against you.\" To this Tullus made answer, \"Now do I call the Gods to witness that ye men of Alba first refused to repair the thing that has been done amiss, and I pray them that they will bring all the blood of this war upon your heads.\" And with this message the men of Alba went home.  After this the two cities made great preparations for war. And because the men of Troy had built Lavinium, from which some going forth had set up the city of Alba, and from the royal house of Alba had come the founder of Rome, it was as though the children would fight against their fathers. Yet it came not to this, the matter being finished without a battle. The men of Alba first marched into the land of the Romans, having with them a very great army, and pitched their camp five miles from the city, digging about it a deep ditch. But while they lay in this camp their King Cluilius died, and a certain Mettus was made dictator in his room. Which when King Tullus heard, he became very bold, saying that the gods had smitten Cluilius for his wrong-doing, and would smite also the whole people of Alba. Whereupon he marched into the land of the Albans, leaving the enemy's camp to one side. And when these also had come forth against him, and the two armies were now drawn up in battle array, the one against the other, there came a messenger to King Tullus, saying that Mettus of Alba desired to have speech with him, having that to say to him which concerned the Romans not less than the men of Alba. Nor did King Tullus refuse to hear him, though indeed battle had pleased him better than speech. So when the King and certain nobles with him had gone forth into the open space that was between the two armies, and Mettus also with his companions had come to the same place, this last spake, saying, \"I have heard King Cluilius that is dead affirm that your wrong-doing, ye men of Rome, in that ye would not deliver up the things that had been carried off, was the cause of this war; nor do I doubt but that thou, King Tullus, hast the same quarrel against us. Yet if we would speak that which is true rather than that which has a fair show, we should, I doubt not, confess that we, though we be both kinsmen and neighbours, are driven into this war by the lust of power. Now I say not whether this be just or no. Let others look to this; for I am not King of Alba, but captain of the host only. Yet there is a matter which I would fain call to thy mind, King. Thou knowest the Etruscans, how mighty they are both by land and sea; for indeed they are nearer by far to thee at Rome than to us at Alba. Bethink thee, therefore, how, when thou shalt give the signal of battle between thy army and our army, the same Etruscans will look on, rejoicing to see us fight together; and how, when the battle is ended, they will fall upon us, having us at disadvantage; for of a truth, whether ye or we prevail, we shall have but little strength remaining to us. If therefore we be not content with the freedom that we have, but must needs set on the chance of a die whether we shall be masters or servants, let us devise some way by which the one may win dominion over the other without great loss and shedding of blood.\" Now King Tullus was a great warrior, and would willingly have fought, being confident that he and his people would prevail; nevertheless the thing that Mettus of Alba had said pleased him. And when they came to consider the matter, there seemed by good fortune to be a way ready to their hands. There were in the army of Alba three brothers that had been born at one birth, whose name was Curiatius. And in the army of the Romans there were other three, and these born likewise at one birth, whose name was Horatius. Nor was there much difference in respect either of age or of strength between the brothers of Alba and the brothers of Rome. Then King Tullus and Mettus of Alba called for the brothers, and enquired of them whether they were willing to fight, each three for their own country, agreement being first made that that people should bear rule for ever whose champions should prevail in the battle. And as the young men were willing, a place was appointed for the battle and a time also. But first there was made a treaty in this fashion, for the fashion of making treaties is the same always, though their conditions be different. The herald said, \"Wilt thou, King Tullus, that I make a treaty with the minister of the people of Alba?\" And when the King answered \"Yea,\" the herald said, \"I will that thou give me the sacred herbs.\" Then the King made reply, \"Take them, and see that they be clean.\" So the herald took them clean from the hill of the citadel. Having done this, he said to the King, \"Dost thou appoint me to do the pleasure of the people of Rome, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24035"],["title","The Pirates of Ersatz (#1)"],["body"," sense! I know what I've done. What monstrous crime am I charged with?\"  \"The charges against you,\" said the justice politely, \"are that on the night of Three Twenty-seven last, you, Bron Hoddan, entered the fenced-in grounds surrounding the Mid-Continent power receptor station. It is charged that you passed two no-admittance signs. You arrived at a door marked 'Authorized Personnel Only.' You broke the lock of that door. Inside, you smashed the power receptor taking broadcast power from the air. This power receptor converts broadcast power for industrial units by which two hundred thousand men are employed. You smashed the receptor, imperiling their employment.\" The justice paused. \"Do you wish to challenge any of these charges as contrary to fact?\"  The Citizen's Representative said hurriedly:  \"You have the right to deny any of them, of course.\"  \"Why should I?\" asked Hoddan. \"I did them! But what's this about me killing somebody? Why'd they tear my place apart looking for something? Who'd I kill, anyhow?\"  \"Don't bring that up!\" pleaded the Citizen's Representative. \"Please don't bring that up! You will be much, much better off if that is not mentioned!\"  \"But I didn't kill anybody!\" insisted Hoddan.  \"Nobody's said a word about it,\" said the Citizen's Representative, jittering. \"Let's not have it in the record! The record has to be published.\" He turned to the justice. \"Sir, the facts are conceded as stated.\"  \"Then,\" said the justice to Hoddan, \"do you choose to answer these charges at this time?\"  \"Why not?\" asked Hoddan. \"Of course!\"  \"Proceed,\" said the justice.         *       *       *       *       *  Hoddan drew a deep breath. He didn't understand why a man's death, charged to him, was not mentioned. He didn't like the scared way everybody looked at him. But--  \"About the burglary business,\" he said confidently. \"What did I do in the power station before I smashed the receptor?\"  The justice looked at Nedda's father's attorney.  \"Why,\" said that gentleman amiably, \"speaking for the Power Board as complainant, before you smashed the standard receptor you connected a device of your own design across the power-leads. It was a receptor unit of an apparently original pattern. It appears to have been a very interesting device.\"  \"I'd offered it to the Power Board,\" said Hoddan, with satisfaction, \"and I was thrown out. You had me thrown out! What did it do?\"  \"It substituted for the receptor you smashed,\" said the attorney. \"It continued to supply some two hundred million kilowatts for the Mid-Continent industrial area. In fact, your crime was only discovered because the original receptor--naturally--had to be set to draw peak power at all times, with the unused power wasted by burning carbon. Your device adjusted to the load and did not burn carbon. So when the attendants went to replace the supposedly burned carbon and found it unused, they discovered what you had done.\"  \"It saved carbon, then,\" said Hoddan triumphantly. \"That means it saved money. I saved the Power Board plenty while that was connected. They wouldn't believe I could. Now they know. I did!\"  The justice said:  \"Irrelevant. You have heard the charges. In legal terms, you are charged with burglary, trespass, breaking and entering, unlawful entry, malicious mischief, breach of the peace, sabotage, and endangering the employment of citizens. Discuss the charges, please!\"  \"I'm telling you!\" protested Hoddan. \"I offered the thing to the Power Board. They said they were satisfied with what they had and wouldn't listen. So I proved what they wouldn't listen to! That receptor saved them ten thousand credits worth of carbon a week! It'll save half a million credits a year in every power station that uses it! If I know the Power Board, they're going right on using it while they arrest me for putting it to work!\"  The courtroom, in its entirety, visibly shivered.  \"Aren't they?\" demanded Hoddan belligerently.  \"They are not,\" said the justice, tight-lipped. \"It has been smashed in its turn. It has even been melted down.\"  \"Then look at my patents!\" insisted Hoddan. \"It's stupid--\"  \"The patent records,\" said the justice with unnecessary vehemence, \"have been destroyed. Your possessions have been searched for copies. Nobody will ever look at your drawings again--not if they are wise!\"  \"Wha-a-at?\" demanded Hoddan incredulously. \"Wha-a-at?\"  \"I will amend the record of this hearing before it is published,\" said the justice shakily. \"I should not have made that comment. I ask permission of the Citizen's Representative to amend.\"  \"Granted,\" said the Representative before he had finished.  The justice said quickly:  \"The-charges-have-been-admitted-by-the-defendant. Since-the-complainant-does-not-wish-punitive-action-taken-against-him--\"  \"He'd be silly if he did,\" grunted Hoddan.  \"And-merely-wishes-security-against-repetition-of-the-offense, I-rule-that-the-defendant-may-be-released-upon-posting-suitable-bond-for -good-behavior-in-the-future. That-is, he-will-be-required-to-post-bond -which-will-be-forfeited-if-he-ever-again-enters-a-power-station -enclosure-passes-no-trespassing-signs-ignores-no-admittance-signs -and/or-smashes-apparatus-belonging-to-the-complainant.\"  \"All right,\" said Hoddan indignantly. \"I'll raise it somehow. If they're too stupid to save money-- How much bond?\"  \"The-court-will-take-it-under-advisement-and-will-notify-the-defendant -within-the-customary-two-hours,\" said the justice at top speed. He swallowed. \"The-defendant-will-be-kept-in-close-confinement-until-the -bond-is-posted. The-hearing-is-ended.\"  He did not look at Hoddan. Courtroom guards put stun-pistols against Hoddan's body and ushered him out.         *       *       *       *       *  Presently his friend Derec came to see him in the tool-steel cell in which he had been placed. Derec looked white and stricken.  \"I'm in trouble because I'm your friend, Bron,\" he said miserably, \"but I asked permission to explain things to you. After all, I caused your arrest. I urged you not to connect up your receptor without permission!\"  \"I know,\" growled Hoddan, \"but there are some people so stupid you have to show them everything. I didn't realize that there are people so stupid you can't show them anything.\"  \"You ... showed something you didn't intend,\" said Derec miserably. \"Bron, I ... I have to tell you. When they went to charge the carbon bins at the power station, they ... they found a dead man, Bron!\"  Hoddan sat up.  \"What's that?\"  \"Your machine--killed him. He was outside the building at the foot of a tree. Your receptor killed him through a stone wall! It broke his bones and killed him.... Bron--\" Derec wrung his hands. \"At some stage of power-drain your receptor makes deathrays!\"  Hoddan had had a good many shocks today. When Derec arrived, he'd been incredulously comparing the treatment he'd received and the panic about him, with the charges made against him in court. They didn't add up. This new, previously undisclosed item left him speechless. He goggled at Derec, who fairly wept.  \"Don't you see?\" asked Derec pleadingly. \"That's why I had to tell the police it was you. We can't have deathrays! The police can't let anybody go free who knows how to make them! This is a wonderful world, but there are lots of crackpots. They'll do anything! The police daren't let it even be suspected that deathrays can be made! That's why you weren't charged with murder. People all over the planet would start doing research, hoping to satisfy all their grudges by committing suicide for all their enemies with themselves! For the sake of civilization your secret has to be suppressed--and you with it. It's terrible for you, Bron, but there's nothing else to do!\"  Hoddan said dazedly:  \"But I only have to put up a bond to be released!\"  \"The ... the justice,\" said Derec tearfully, \"didn't name it in court, because it would have to be published. But he's set your bond at fifty million credits! Nobody could raise that for you, Bron! And with the reason for it what it is, you'll never be able to get it reduced.\"  \"But anybody who looks at the plans of the receptor will know it can't make deathrays!\" protested Hoddan blankly.  \"Nobody will look,\" said Derec tearfully. \"Anybody who knows how to make it will have to be locked up. They checked the patent examiners. They've forgotten. Nobody dared examine the device you had working. They'd be jailed if they understood it! Nobody will ever risk learning how to make deathrays--not on a world as civilized as this, with so many people anxious to kill everybody else. You have to be locked up forever, Bron. You have to!\"  Hoddan said inadequately:  \"Oh.\"  \"I beg your forgiveness for having you arrested,\" said Derec in abysmal sorrow, \"but I couldn't do anything but tell--\"  Hoddan stared at his cell wall. Derec went away weeping. He was an admirable, honorable, not-too-bright young man who had been Hoddan's only friend.  Hoddan stared blankly at nothing. As an event, it was preposterous, and yet it was wholly natural. When in the course of human events somebody does something that puts somebody else to the trouble of adjusting the numb routine of his life, the adjustee is resentful. The richer he is and the more satisfactory he considers his life, the more resentful he is at any change, however minute. And of all the changes which offend people, changes which require them to think are most disliked.  The high brass in the Power Board considered that everything was moving smoothly. There was no need to consider new devices. Hoddan's drawings and plans had simply never been bothered with, because there was no recognized need for them. And when he forced acknowledgment that his receptor worked, the unwelcome demonstration was highly offensive in itself. It was natural, it was inevitable, it should have been infallibly certain that any possible excuse for not thinking about the receptor would be seized upon. And a single dead man found near the "]]]
