Born almost black, this colt had shed his baby fur two seasons ago for a dark iron-gray hide which would grow lighter with the years. He had Eclipse's heritage, but he was more than a racing machine. He was--Drew's forehead rasped against the weathered wood of the rail--he was the kind of horse a man could dream about all his days and perhaps find once in a lifetime, if he were lucky! Give that colt three or four more years and there wouldn't be any horse that could touch him. Not in Kentucky, or anywhere else!  He was circling on a leading strap now, throwing his feet in a steady, rhythmic pattern around the hub of a Negro groom who was holding the strap and admiring the action. Mounted on another gray--a mare with a dainty, high-held head--was a woman, her figure trim in a habit almost the same shade of green as the fields.  Drew pulled back. Then he smiled wryly at his instinctive retreat. His aunt, Marianna Forbes, had abilities to be respected, but he very much doubted if she could either sense his presence or see through the leafy wall of his present spy hole. Yet caution dictated that he get about his real business and inspect the fields where the horses he sought should be grazing.  He halted several times during his perimeter march to survey the countryside. And the bits of activity he spied upon began to puzzle him. Aunt Marianna's supervision of the colt's schooling had been the beginning. And he had seen her later, riding out with Rafe, the overseer, to make the daily rounds, a duty which had never been undertaken at Red Springs by any one other than his grandfather.  Aunt Marianna had every right to be at Red Springs. She had been born under its roof, having left it only as a bride to live in Lexington. The war had brought her back when her husband became an officer in the Second Kentucky Cavalry--Union. But now--riding with Rafe, watching in the paddock--where was Alexander Mattock?  Red Springs was his grandfather. Drew found it impossible to think of the house and the estate without the man, though in the past two years he had discovered very few things could be dismissed as impossible. Curiosity made him want to investigate the present mystery. But the memory of his last exit from that house curbed such a desire.  Drew had never been welcome there from the day of his birth within those walls. And the motive for his final flight from there had only provided an added aggravation for his grandfather. A staunch Union supporter wanted no part of a stubborn-willed and defiant grandson who rode with John Hunt Morgan. Drew clung to his somewhat black thoughts as he made his way to the pasture. The escape he had found in the army was no longer so complete when he skulked through these familiar fields.  But there were only two horses grazing peacefully in the field dedicated by custom to the four- and five-year-olds, and neither was of the best stock. One could imagine that Red Springs had already contributed to the service.  Of course, Morgan's men were not the only riders aiming to sweep good horseflesh out of Kentucky blue grass this season, and here the Union cavalry would be favored.  There was a slim chance that a few horses might be in the stables. He debated the chance of that against the risk of discovery and continued debating it as he started back to the tree house.  Drew had known short rations and slim foraging for a long time, but the present pinch in his middle sharpened when he sighted the big house, with its attendant summer kitchen showing a trail of chimney smoke.  Alexander Mattock might have considered his grandson an interloper at Red Springs; certainly the old man never concealed the state of his feelings on that subject. But neither had he, in any way, slighted what he deemed to be his duty toward Drew.  There had been plenty of good clothing--the right sort for a Mattock grandson--and the usual bounteous table set by hospitable Kentucky standards. Just as there had been education, sometimes enforced by the use of a switch when the tutor--imported from Lexington--thought it necessary to impress learning on a rebellious young mind by a painful application in another portion of the body. Education, as well as a blooded horse in the stables, and all the other prerequisites of a young blue-grass grandee. But never any understanding, affection, or sympathy.  That cold behavior--the cutting, weighing, and judgment of every act of childish mischief and boyish recklessness--might have crushed some into a colorless obedience. But it had made of Drew a rebel long before he tugged on the short gray shell jacket of a Confederate cavalryman.  Drew had forgotten the feel of linen next to his now seldom clean skin, the set of broadcloth across the shoulders. And he depended upon the roan's services with appreciation which had nothing to do with boasted bloodlines, having discovered in the army that a cold-blooded horse could keep going on rough forage when a finer bred hunter broke down. But today the famed dinner table at Red Springs was a painful memory to one facing only cold hoecake and stone-hard dried beef.  He had circled back to the brush screening the brook and the tree house. Now he stood very still, his hand sliding one of the heavy Colts out of its holster. The roan was still grazing, paying no attention to a figure who was kneeling on the limb-supported platform and turning over the gear Drew had left piled there.  The scout flitted about a bush, choosing a path which would bring him out at the stranger's back. That same warm sun, now striking from a different angle into the tree house, was bright on a thick tangle of yellow hair, curly enough to provide its owner with a combing problem.  Drew straightened to his full height. The sense of the past which had dogged him all day now struck like a blow. He couldn't help calling aloud that name, even though the soberer part of his brain knew there could be no answer.  \"Shelly!\"  The blond head turned, and blue eyes looked at him, startled, across a bowed shoulder. Drew's puzzlement was complete. Not Sheldon, of course, but who? The other's open surprise changed to wide-eyed recognition first.  \"Drew!\" The hail came in the cracked voice of an adolescent as the other jumped down to face the scout. They stood at almost eye-to-eye level, but the stranger was still all boy, awkwardly unsure of strength or muscle control.  \"You must be Boyd--\" Drew blinked, something in him still clinging to the memory of Sheldon, Sheldon who had helped to build the tree house. Why, Boyd was only a small boy, usually tagging his impatient elders, not this tall, almost exact copy of his dead brother.  \"Sure, I'm Boyd. And it's true then, ain't it, Drew? General Morgan's coming back here? Where?\" He glanced over his shoulder once more as if expecting to see a troop prance up through the bushes along the stream.  Drew holstered the revolver. \"Rumors of that around?\" he asked casually.  \"Some,\" Boyd answered. \"The Yankee-lovers called out the Home Guard yesterday. What sort of a chance do they think they'll have against _General Morgan_?\"  Drew moved toward the roan's picket rope. As his fingers closed on that he thought fast. Just as the Mattocks and the Forbeses were Union, the Barretts were, or had been, Southern in sympathy. Most of Kentucky was divided that way now. But what might have been true two years ago was not necessarily a fact today. One took no chances.  \"You come back to see your grandfather, Drew?\"  \"Any reason why I should?\" The whole countryside must know very well the state of affairs between Alexander Mattock and Drew Rennie.  \"Well, he's been sick for so long.... Didn't you know about that?\" Boyd must have read Drew's answer in his face, for he spilled out the news quickly. \"He had some kind of a fit when he heard Murray was killed----\"  Drew dropped the picket rope. \"Uncle Murray ... dead?\"  Boyd nodded. \"Killed at Murfreesboro in sixty-two, but the news didn't come till about a week after the battle. Mr. Mattock was in town when Judge Hagerstorm told him ... just turned red in the face and fell down in the middle of the street. They brought him home, and sometimes he sits outdoors. But he can't walk too good and he talks thick; you can hardly understand him.\"  \"So that's why Aunt Marianna's in charge.\" Drew thought of Uncle Murray swept away by time and the chances of war as so many others--and no emotion stirred within him. Murray Mattock had firmly agreed with his father concerning the child who was the result of a runaway match between his sister Melanie and a despised Texan. But Uncle Murray's death must indeed have been a paralyzing blow for the old man at Red Springs, with all his pride and his plans for his only son.  \"Yes, Cousin Marianna runs Red Springs,\" Boyd assented, \"she and Rafe. They sell horses to the army--the blue bellies.\" He used the term with the concentration of one determined to say the right thing at the right time.  Drew laughed. And with that spontaneous outburst, years fell away from his somber face. \"I take it that you do not approve of blue bellies, Boyd?\"  \"'Course not! Me, I'm goin' to join General Morgan now. Ain't nobody goin' to keep me from doin' that!\" Again his voice scaled up out of control, and he flushed.  \"You're rather young----\" Drew began, when the other interrupted him with something close to desperation in his voice.  \"No, I ain't too young! That's all I ever hear--too young to do this, too young to be thinkin' about things like that! Well, I ain't much younger than you were, Drew Rennie, when you joined up with Captain Castleman and rode south to join General Morgan--you and Shelly. And you know that, too! I'll be sixteen on the fifteenth of this July. And this time I'm goin'! Where's the General now, Drew?\"  The scout shrugged. \"Movin' fast. Your rumors probably know as much as I do. They plant him half a dozen places at once. He might be in any one of them or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23624"],["title","Ride Proud, Rebel! (#2)"],["body","miles away; that's how Morgan rides.\"  \"But you're goin' to join him, and you'll take me with you, won't you, Drew?\"  The lightness was gone from the older boy's eyes, his mouth set in controlled anger. \"I am not goin' to do anything of the kind, Boyd Barrett.\" He spoke the words slowly, in an even tone, with a fraction of pause between each. Men of the command had once or twice heard young Rennie speak that way. Although difficult to know well, he had the general reputation of being easy to get along with. But a few times he had erupted into action as might a spring uncoiling from tight pressure, and that action was usually preceded by just such quiet statements as the one he had just made to Boyd.  Boyd, however, was never one to be defeated in a first skirmish of wills. \"Why not?\" he demanded now.  \"Because,\" Drew offered the first argument he could think of which might be acceptable to the other, \"I'm on scout in enemy-held territory. If I'm taken, it's not good. I have to ride light and fast, and this is duty I've been trained to do. So I can't afford to be hampered by a green kid----\"  \"I can ride just as fast and hard as you can, Drew Rennie, and I have Whirlaway for my own now. He's certainly better than that nag!\" With an arrogant lift of the chin, Boyd indicated the roan, who had raised his head and was chewing rather noisily, regarding the two by the tree house with mild interest.  \"Don't underrate Shawnee.\" For an instant Drew rose to the roan's defense and then found himself irritated at being so drawn from the main argument. \"And I wouldn't care if you had Gray Eagle, himself, under you, boy--I'm not taking you with me. Let us be snapped up by the Yankees, and you'd be in bigger trouble than I would.\" He gestured to his shirt and breeches. \"I'm in uniform; you ain't.\"  \"No blue bellies could drop on us,\" Boyd pushed. \"I know where all the garrisons are round here--all about their patrols. I could get us through quicker'n you can, yourself. I ain't no green kid!\"  Drew slapped the blanket down on Shawnee's back, smoothed it flat with a palm stroke, and jerked his saddle from the platform. He could not stay right here now that Boyd had smoked him out--maybe nowhere in the neighborhood with this excitable boy dogging him.  The scout was driven to his second line of defense. \"What about Cousin Merry?\" he asked as he tightened the cinch. \"Have you talked this over with her--enlistin', I mean?\"  Boyd's lower lip protruded in a child's pout. His eyes shifted away from Drew's direct gaze.  \"She never said No----\"  \"Did you ask her?\" Drew challenged.  \"Did you ask your grandfather when you left?\" Boyd tried a counterattack.  This time Drew's laughter was harsh, without humor. \"You know I didn't, and you also know why. But I didn't leave a mother!\"  He was being purposefully brutal now, for a good reason. Sheldon had ridden away before; Boyd must not go now. In Drew's childhood, his father's cousin, Meredith Barrett, had been the only one who had really cared about him. His only escape from the cold bleakness of Red Springs had been Barrett's Oak Hill. There was a big debt he owed Cousin Merry; he could not add to it the burden of taking away her second son.  Sure, he had been only a few months older than this boy when he had run away to war, but he had not left anyone behind who would worry about him. And Alexander Mattock's cold discipline had tempered his grandson into someone far more able to take hard knocks than Boyd Barrett might be for years to come. Drew had met those knocks, thick and fast, enduring them as the price of his freedom.  \"You were mad at your grandfather, and you ran away. Well, I ain't mad at Mother, but I ain't goin' to sit at home with General Morgan comin'! He needs men. They've been recruitin' for him on the quiet; you know they have. And I've got to make up for Sheldon----\"  Drew swung around and caught Boyd's wrist in a grip tight enough to bring a reflex backward jerk from the boy. \"That's no way to make up for Sheldon's death-runnin' away from home to fight. Don't give me any nonsense about goin' to kill Yankees because they killed him! When a man goes to war ... well, he takes his chances. Shelly did at Chickamauga. War ain't a private fight, just one man up against another--\"  But he was making no impression; he couldn't. At Boyd's age you could not imagine death as coming to you; nor were you able to visualize the horrors of an ill-equipped field hospital. Any more than you could picture all the rest of it--the filth, hunger, cold, and boredom with now and then a flash of whirling horses and men clashing on some road or field, or the crazy stampede of other men, yelling their throats raw as they charged into a hell of Minié balls and canister shot.  \"I'm goin' to ride with General Morgan, like Shelly did,\" Boyd repeated doggedly, with that stubbornness which seasons ago had kept him eternally tagging his impatient elders.  \"That's up to you.\" Suddenly Drew was tired, tired of trying to find words to pierce to Boyd's thinking brain--if one had a thinking brain at his age. Slinging his carbine, Drew mounted Shawnee. \"But I do know one thing--you're not goin' with me.\"  \"Drew-Drew, just listen once....\"  Shawnee answered to the pressure of his rider's knees and leaped the brook. Drew bowed his head to escape the lash of a low branch. There was no going back ever, he thought bitterly, shutting his ears to Boyd's cry. He'd been a fool to ride this way at all.     2  _Guns in the Night_   There were sounds enough in the middle of the night to tell the initiated that a troop was on the march--creak of saddle leather, click of shod hoof, now and then the smothered exclamation of a man shaken out of a cavalryman's mounted doze. To Drew's trained ears all this was loud enough to send any Union picket calling out the guard. Yet there was no indication that the enemy ahead was alert.  Near two o'clock he made it, and the advance were walking their horses into the fringe of Lexington--this was home-coming for a good many of the men sagging in the saddles. Morgan's old magic was working again. Escaping from the Ohio prison, he had managed to gather up the remnants of a badly shattered command, weld them together, and lead them up from Georgia to their old fighting fields--the country which they considered rightfully theirs and in which during other years they had piled one humiliating defeat for the blue coats on another. General Morgan could _not_ lose in Kentucky!  And they already had one minor victory to taste sweet: Mount Sterling had fallen into their hold as easily as it had before. Now Lexington--with the horses they needed--friends and families waiting to greet them.  Captain Tom Quirk's Irish brogue, unmistakable even in a half whisper, came out of the dark: \"Pull up, boys!\"  Drew came to a halt with his flanking scout. There was a faint drum of hoofs from behind as three horsemen caught up with the first wave of Quirk's Scouts.  \"Taking the flag in ...\" Drew caught a snatch of sentence passed between the leader of the newcomers and his own officer. He recognized the voice of John Castleman, his former company commander.  \"... worth a try ...\" that was Quirk.  But when the three had cantered on into the mouth of the street the scout captain turned his head to the waiting shadows. \"Rennie, Bruce, Croxton ... give them cover!\"  Drew sent Shawnee on, his carbine resting ready across his saddle. The streets were quiet enough, too quiet. These dark houses showed no signs of life, but surely the Yankees were not so confident that they would not have any pickets posted. And Fort Clay had its garrison....  Then that ominous silence was broken by Castleman's call: \"Bearer of flag of truce!\"  \"... Morgan's men?\" A woman called from a window up ahead, her voice so low pitched Drew heard only a word or two. Castleman answered her before he gave the warning:  \"Battery down the street, boys. Take to the sidewalks!\"  A lantern bobbed along in their direction. Drew had a glimpse of a blue-uniformed arm above it. A moment later Castleman rode back. One of his companions swerved close-by, and Drew recognized Key Morgan, the General's brother.  \"They say, 'No surrender.'\"  Perhaps that was what they said. But the skirmishers were now drifting into town. Orders snapped from man to man through the dark. The crackle of small-arms fire came sporadically, to be followed by the heavier _boom-boom_ as cannon balls from Fort Clay ricocheted through the streets, the Yankees being forced back into the protection of that stronghold. Riders threaded through alleys and cross streets; lamps flared up in house windows. There was a pounding on doors, and shouted greetings. Fire made a splash of angry color at the depot, to be answered with similar blazes at the warehouses.  \"Spur up those crowbaits of yours, boys!\" Quirk rounded up the scouts. \"We're out for horses--only the best, remember that!\"  Out of the now aroused Lexington just as daylight was gray overhead, they were on the road to Ashland. If Red Springs might have proved poor picking, John Clay's stables did not. One sleek thoroughbred after another was led from the stalls while Quirk fairly purred.  \"Skedaddle! Would you believe it? Here's Skedaddle, himself, just aching to show heels to the blue bellies, ain't you?\" He greeted the great racer. \"Now that's the sort of stuff we need! Give us another chase across the Ohio clean up to Canada with a few like him under us. Sweep 'em clean and get going! The General wants to see the catch before noon.\"  Drew watched the mounts being led down the lane. Beautiful, yes, but to his mind not one of them was the equal of the gray colt he had seen at Red Springs. Now that was a horse! And he was not tempted now to strip his saddle off Shawnee and transfer to any one of the princes of equine blood passing him by. He knew the roan, and Shawnee knew his job. Knows more about the work than I do sometimes,"]]]
