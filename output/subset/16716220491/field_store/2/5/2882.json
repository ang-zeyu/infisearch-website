He was told, as expected, that the factory and distribution point was in Leningrad and given instructions and letters of introduction.  On the fifth day he took the Red Arrow Express to Leningrad and established himself at the Astoria Hotel, 39 Hertzen Street. It was one of the many of the Intourist hotels going back to before the revolution.  He spent the next day allowing his guide to show him the standard tourist sights. The Winter Palace, where the Bolshevik revolution was won when the mutinied cruiser _Aurora_ steamed up the river and shelled it. The Hermitage Museum, rivaled only by the Vatican and Louvre. The Alexandrovskaya Column, the world's tallest monolithic stone monument. The modest personal palace of Peter the Great. The Peter and Paul Cathedral. The king-size Kirov Stadium. The Leningrad subway, as much a museum as a system of transportation.  He saw it all, tourist fashion, and wondered inwardly what the Intourist guide would have thought had he known that this was Mr. John Smith's home town.  The day following, he turned his business problem over to the guide. He wanted to meet, let's see now, oh yes, here it is, Leonid Shvernik, of the Mikoyan Camera works. Could it be arranged?  Of course it could be arranged. The guide went into five minutes of oratory on the desire of the Soviet Union to trade with the West, and thus spread everlasting peace.  An interview was arranged for Mr. Smith with Mr. Shvernik for that afternoon.  Mr. Smith met Mr. Shvernik in the latter's office at two and they went through the usual amenities. Mr. Shvernik spoke excellent English so Mr. Smith was able to dismiss his interpreter-guide for the afternoon. When he was gone and they were alone Mr. Shvernik went into his sales talk.  \"I can assure you, sir, that not since the Japanese startled the world with their new cameras shortly after the Second War, has any such revolution in design and quality taken place. The Mikoyan is not only the _best_ camera produced anywhere, but since our plant is fully automated, we can sell it for a fraction the cost of German, Japanese or American--\"  Paul Koslov came to his feet, walked quietly over to one of the pictures hanging on the wall, lifted it, pointed underneath and raised his eyebrows at the other.  Leonid Shvernik leaned back in his chair, shocked.  Paul remained there until at last the other shook his head.  Paul said, in English, \"Are you absolutely sure?\"  \"Yes.\" Shvernik said. \"There are no microphones in here. I absolutely know. Who are you?\"  Paul said, \"In the movement they call you Georgi, and you're top man in the Leningrad area.\"  Shvernik's hand came up from under the desk and he pointed a heavy military revolver at his visitor. \"Who are you?\" he repeated.  Paul ignored the gun. \"Someone who knows that you are Georgi,\" he said \"I'm from America. Is there any chance of anybody intruding?\"  \"Yes, one of my colleagues. Or perhaps a secretary.\"  [Illustration]  \"Then I suggest we go to a bar, or some place, for a drink or a cup of coffee or whatever the current Russian equivalent might be.\"  Shvernik looked at him searchingly. \"Yes,\" he said finally. \"There's a place down the street.\" He began to stick the gun in his waistband, changed his mind and put it back into the desk drawer.  As soon as they were on the open street and out of earshot of other pedestrians, Paul said, \"Would you rather I spoke Russian? I have the feeling that we'd draw less attention than if we speak English.\"  Shvernik said tightly, \"Do the Intourist people know you speak Russian? If not, stick to English. Now, how do you know my name? I have no contacts with the Americans.\"  \"I got it through my West German contacts.\"  The Russian's face registered unsuppressed fury. \"Do they ignore the simplest of precautions! Do they reveal me to every source that asks?\"  Paul said mildly, \"Herr Ludwig is currently under my direction. Your secret is as safe as it has ever been.\"  The underground leader remained silent for a long moment. \"You're an American, eh, and Ludwig told you about me? What do you want now?\"  \"To help,\" Paul Koslov said.  \"How do you mean, to help? How can you help? I don't know what you're talking about.\"  \"Help in any way you want. Money, printing presses, mimeograph machines, radio transmitters, weapons, manpower in limited amounts, know-how, training, anything you need to help overthrow the Soviet government.\"  They had reached the restaurant. Leonid Shvernik became the Russian export official. He ushered his customer to a secluded table. Saw him comfortably into his chair.  \"Do you actually know anything about cameras?\" he asked.  \"Yes,\" Paul said, \"we're thorough. I can buy cameras from you and they'll be marketed in the States.\"  \"Good.\" The waiter was approaching. Shvernik said, \"Have you ever eaten caviar Russian style?\"  \"I don't believe so,\" Paul said \"I'm not very hungry.\"  \"Nothing to do with hunger.\" Shvernik said. From the waiter he ordered raisin bread, sweet butter, caviar and a carafe of vodka.  The waiter went off for it and Shvernik said, \"To what extent are you willing to help us? Money, for instance. What kind of money, rubles, dollars? And how much? A revolutionary movement can always use money.\"  \"Any kind,\" Paul said flatly, \"and any amount.\"  Shvernik was impressed. He said eagerly, \"Any amount within reason, eh?\"  Paul looked into his face and said flatly, \"Any amount, period. It doesn't have to be particularly reasonable. Our only qualification would be a guarantee it is going into the attempt to overthrow the Soviets--not into private pockets.\"  The waiter was approaching. Shvernik drew some brochures from his pocket, spread them before Paul Koslov and began to point out with a fountain pen various features of the Mikoyan camera.  The waiter put the order on the table and stood by for a moment for further orders.  Shvernik said, \"First you take a sizable portion of vodka, like this.\" He poured them two jolts. \"And drink it down, ah, bottoms up, you Americans say. Then you spread butter on a small slice of raisin bread, and cover it with a liberal portion of caviar. Good? Then you eat your little sandwich and drink another glass of vodka. Then you start all over again.\"  \"I can see it could be fairly easy to get stoned, eating caviar Russian style,\" Paul laughed.  They went through the procedure and the waiter wandered off.  Paul said, \"I can take several days arranging the camera deal with you. Then I can take a tour of the country, supposedly giving it a tourist look-see, but actually making contact with more of your organization. I can then return in the future, supposedly to make further orders. I can assure you, these cameras are going to sell very well in the States. I'll be coming back, time and again--for business reasons. Meanwhile, do you have any members among the interpreter-guides in the local Intourist offices?\"  Shvernik nodded. \"Yes. And, yes, that would be a good idea. We'll assign Ana Furtseva to you, if we can arrange it. And possibly she can even have a chauffeur assigned you who'll also be one of our people.\"  That was the first time Paul Koslov heard the name Ana Furtseva.         *       *       *       *       *  In the morning Leonid Shvernik came to the hotel in a Mikoyan Camera Works car loaded with cameras and the various accessories that were available for the basic model. He began gushing the advantages of the Mikoyan before they were well out of the hotel.  The last thing he said, as they trailed out of the hotel's portals was, \"We'll drive about town, giving you an opportunity to do some snapshots and then possibly to my country dacha where we can have lunch--\"  At the car he said, \"May I introduce Ana Furtseva, who's been assigned as your guide-interpreter by Intourist for the balance of your stay? Ana, Mr. John Smith.\"  Paul shook hands.  She was blond as almost all Russian girls are blond, and with the startling blue eyes. A touch chubby, by Western standards, but less so than the Russian average. She had a disturbing pixie touch around the mouth, out of place in a dedicated revolutionist.  The car took off with Shvernik at the wheel. \"You're actually going to have to take pictures as we go along. We'll have them developed later at the plant. I've told them that you are potentially a very big order. Possibly they'll try and assign one of my superiors to your account after a day or two. If so, I suggest that you merely insist that you feel I am competent and you would rather continue with me.\"  \"Of course,\" Paul said. \"Now then, how quickly can our assistance to you get underway?\"  \"The question is,\" Shvernik said, \"just how much you can do in the way of helping our movement. For instance, can you get advanced type weapons to us?\"  The .38 Noiseless slid easily into Paul's hands. \"Obviously, we can't smuggle sizable military equipment across the border. But here, for instance, is a noiseless, recoilless hand gun. We could deliver any reasonable amount within a month.\"  \"Five thousand?\" Shvernik asked.  \"I think so. You'd have to cover once they got across the border, of course. How well organized are you? If you aren't, possibly we can help there, but not in time to get five thousand guns to you in a month.\"  Ana was puzzled. \"How could you possibly get that number across the Soviet borders?\" Her voice had a disturbing Slavic throatiness. It occurred to Paul Koslov that she was one of the most attractive women he had ever met. He was amused. Women had never played a great part in his life. There had never been anyone who had really, basically, appealed. But evidently blood was telling. Here he had to come back to Russia to find such attractiveness.  He said, \"The Yugoslavs are comparatively open and smuggling across the Adriatic from Italy, commonplace. We'd bring the things you want in that way. Yugoslavia and Poland are on good terms, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2393"],["title","His Dog (#1)"],["body","a compound fracture. From Civil War hospital experience the father had been a deft bonesetter. And following his recollection of the old man's methods, Link himself had later set the broken leg of one of his lambs. The operation had been a success. He resolved now to duplicate it.  Slowly and somewhat clumsily he went to work at the injured dog. The collie's brave patience nerved him to greater tenderness and care. A veterinary would have  made neater work of the bonesetting, but hardly could have rendered the  job more effective.  When the task was achieved Link brought his patient a bowl of cold water--which the collie drank greedily--and some bread and meat scraps which the feverish patient would not touch.  As he worked at his bonesetting task, Ferris had more chance to study his new acquisition. The dog was young--probably not more than two years old. The teeth proved that. He wore a thin collie collar with no inscription on its silver band.  Even to Link's inexperienced eye he was an animal of high breeding and of glorious beauty. Link told himself he would perhaps get as much as ten dollars for the return of so costly a pet. And he wondered why the golden prospect did not seem more alluring.  Three times in the night Link got up to give the collie fresh water and to moisten and re-adjust the bandages. And, every time, the sight of his rescuer would cause the dog's tail to thump a joyous welcome and would fill the dark eyes with a loving gratitude which went straight to Ferris's lonely heart.  In the morning the dog was prevailed upon to lap a saucer of warm milk, and even to nibble at a crust of soaked bread. Link was ashamed of his own keen and growing interest in his find. For the first time he realized how bleakly lonesome had been his home life, since the death of his father had left him solitary.   There was a mysteriously comforting companionship in the dog's presence. Link found himself talking to him from time to time as to a fellow human. And the words  did not echo back in eerie hollowness from the walls, as when he had  sometimes sought to ease his desolation by talking aloud to himself.  He was embarrassed by his general ignorance of dogs, and by his ignorance of this particular dog's name. He sought to learn what the collie had been called; by trying one familiar dog name after another. But, to such stand-by cognomens as Rover, Tige, Fido, Ponto, Shep and the rest, the patient gave no further sign of recognition than a friendly wagging of his plumed tail. And he wagged it no more interestedly for one name than for another.  So Ferris ceased from the effort, and decided to give his pet a brand-new name for such brief space as they should be housemates. After long deliberation he hit upon the name \"Chum,\" as typical of the odd friendship that was springing to life between the dog and himself. And he planned to devote much time to teaching the collie this name.  But, to his surprise, no such tedious period of instruction was necessary. In less than a single day Chum knew his name,--knew it past all doubt.  Link was amazed at such cleverness. For three solid months, at one time, he had striven to teach his horse and his cows and a few of his sheep to respond to given names. And at the end of the course of patient tutelage he had been morbidly certain that not one of his solemn-eyed pupils had grasped the lessons.  It was surprisingly pleasant to drop in at the kitchen door nowadays, in intervals between chores or at the day's end, and be greeted by that glad glint of the eye and the ecstatic pounding of the wavy tail against the floor. It was still pleasanter to see the gaze of wistful adoration that strengthened daily  as Chum and his new master grew better and better acquainted.  Pleasantest of all was it to sit and talk to the collie in the once-tedious evenings, and to know that his every word was appreciated and listened to with eager interest, even if the full gist of the talk itself did not penetrate to the listener's understanding.  Link Ferris, for the first time in his life, had a dog. Incidentally, for the first time in his life, he had an intimate friend--something of whose love and loyalty he waxed increasingly sure. And he was happy.  His brighter spirits manifested themselves in his farm work, transforming drudgery into contentment. And the farm began, in small ways, to show the effects of its owner's new attitude toward labor.   The day after he found Chum, Link had trudged to Hampton; and, there, had affixed to the clapboards of the general store a bit of paper whereon he had scrawled:  \"Found-One white and brown bird dog with leg broken. Owner can have same by paying a reward.\"  On his next huckster trip to Craigswold he pinned a similar sign to the bulletin board of that rarefied resort's post-office. And he waited for results.  He did more. He bought two successive copies of the county's daily paper and scanned it for word of a missing dog. But in neither copy did he find what he sought.  True, both editions carried display advertisements which offered a seventy-five dollar reward for information leading to the return of a \"dark-sable-and-white collie lost somewhere between Hohokus and Suffern.\"  The first time he saw this notice Link was  vaguely troubled lest it might refer to Chum. He told himself he hoped it did. For seventy-five dollars just now would be a godsend. And in self-disgust he choked back a most annoying twinge of grief at thought of parting with the dog.  Two things in the advertisement puzzled him. In the first place, as Chum was longhaired and graceful, Link had mentally classified him as belonging to the same breed as did the setters which accompanied hunters on mountain rambles past his farm in the autumns. Being wholly unversed in canine lore, he had, therefore, classified Chum as a \"bird dog\". The word \"collie\", if ever he had chanced to hear it before, carried no meaning to him.  Moreover, he did not know what \"sable\" meant. He asked Dominie Jansen, whom he met on the way home. And the dominie told him \"sable\" was another name for \"black.\" Jansen went on to amplify the theme, dictionary-fashion, by quoting a piece of sacred poetry about \"the sable wings of night.\"  A great load was off Link's heart. Chum, most assuredly, was not black and white. So the advertisement could not possibly refer to him. The reverend gentleman, not being a dog fancier, of course had no means of knowing that \"sable\", in collie jargon, means practically every shade of color except black or gray or white.  Link was ashamed of his own delight in finding he need not give up his pet--even for seventy-five dollars. He tried to recall his father's invectives against dogs, and to remind himself that another mouth to feed on the farm must mean still sharper poverty and skimping. But logic could not strangle joy, and life took on a new zest for the lonely man.  By the time Chum could limp around on the fasthealing foreleg, he and Link had established a friendship that was a boon to both and a stark astonishment to Ferris.  Link had always loved animals. He had an inborn \"way\" with them. Yet his own intelligence had long since taught him that his \"farm critters\" responded but dully to his attempts at a more perfect understanding.  He knew, for example, that the horse he had bred and reared and had taught to come at his call, would doubtless suffer the first passing stranger to mount him and ride him away, despite any call from his lifelong master. He knew that his presence, to the cattle and sheep, meant only food or a shift of quarters; and that an outsider could drive or tend them as readily as could he on whose farm they had been born. Their possible affection for him was a hazy thing, based solely on what he fed them and on their occasional mild interest in being petted.  But with Chum it was all different. The dog learned quickly his new master's moods and met them in kind. The few simple tricks Link sought to teach him were grasped with bewildering ease. There was a human quality of sympathy and companionship which radiated almost visibly from Chum. His keen collie brain was forever amazing Ferris by its flashes of perception. The dog was a revelation and an endless source of pleasure to the hermit-farmer.  When Chum was whole of his hurt and when the injured leg had knit so firmly that the last trace of lameness was gone, Link fell to recalling his father's preachments as to the havoc wrought by dogs upon sheep. He could not afford to lose the leanest and toughest of his little sheep flock--even as price for the happiness of owning a comrade. Link puzzled sorely over this.  Then one morning it occurred to him to put the matter up to Chum himself. Hitherto he had kept the dog around the house, except on their daily walks; and he had always tied him when driving the sheep to or from pasture. This morning he took the collie along when he went out to release the tiny flock from their barnyard fold and send them out to graze.  Link opened the fold gate, one hand on Chum's collar. Out billowed the sheep in a ragged scramble. Chum quivered with excitement as the woolly catapults surged past him. Eagerly he looked up into his master's face, then back at the tumbling creatures.  \"Chum!\" spoke Ferris sharply. \"Leave 'em be! Get that? LEAVE 'EM BE!\"  He tightened his hold on the collar as he gave the command. Chum ceased to quiver in eagerness and stood still, half puzzled, half grieved by the man's unwonted tone.  The sheep, at sight and smell of the dog, rushed jostlingly from their pen and scattered in every direction, through barnyard and garden and nearer fields. Bleating and stampeding, they ran. Link Ferris blinked after them, and broke into speech. Loudly and luridly he swore.  This stampede might well mean an hour's running to and fro before the scattered flock could be herded once more. An hour of panting and blasphemous pursuit, at the very outset of an overbusy day. And"]]]
