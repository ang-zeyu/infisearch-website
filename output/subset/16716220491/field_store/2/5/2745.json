Ho! ho!  Yis, me see an' hear berry well Muggins go too if hims can--and Larry O'Hale, ho yis.  Now, me go too!\"  \"You too?\"  \"Yis.

CHAPTER THREE.  DESCRIBES A TREMENDOUS BUT BLOODLESS FIGHT.  Proverbial philosophy tells us--and every one must have learned from personal experience--that \"there is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.\"  Heroes in every rank of life are peculiarly liable to such slips, and _our_ hero was no exception to the rule.  Finding that the vessel in which he sailed was now little, if at all, better than a pirate, he had fondly hoped that he should make his escape on the first point of South America at which they touched.  Land was at last in sight.  Hope was high in the breast of Will Osten, and expressive glances passed between him and his friends in captivity, when, alas! the land turned out to be a small island, so low that they could see right across it, and so scantily covered with vegetation that human beings evidently deemed it unworthy of being possessed.  \"There's niver a sowl upon it,\" remarked Larry O'Hale, in a tone of chagrin.  \"Maybe not,\" said Griffin, who overheard the observation; \"but there's plenty of _bodies_ on it if not souls, and, as we are short of provisions, I intend to lay-to, and give you a chance of seeing them. Get ready to go ashore; I'm not afraid of you _wandering too far_!\"  Griffin wound up this speech with a low chuckle and a leer, which sent a chill to the heart not only of Will Osten but of Larry and Muggins also, for it convinced them that their new master had guessed their intention, and that he would, of course, take every precaution to prevent its being carried out.  After the first depression of spirits, consequent on this discovery, the three friends became more than ever determined to outwit their enemy, and resolved to act, in the meantime, with perfect submission and prompt obedience--as they had hitherto done.  Of course, each reserved in his own mind the right of rebellion if Griffin should require them to do any criminal act, and they hoped fervently that they should not fall in with any vessel that might prove a temptation to their new captain.  A few minutes after this, the order was given to lower one of the boats, and a crew jumped into her, among whom were Larry and Muggins.  Will Osten asked permission to go, and Griffin granted his request with a grin that was the reverse of amiable.  \"Musha! what sort o' bodies did the capting main?\" said Larry, when they had pulled beyond earshot of the ship.  \"Ha, paddy,\" replied one of the men, \"they're pleasant fat bodies-- amusin' to catch and much thought of by aldermen;--turtles no less.\"  \"Ah! then, it's jokin' ye are.\"  \"Not I.  I never joke.\"  \"Turthles is it--green fat an' all?\"  \"Ay, an' shells too.\"  \"Sure it's for the coppers they're wanted.\"  \"Just so, Larry, an' if you'll ship your oar an jump out wi' the painter, we'll haul the boat up an' show you how to catch 'em.\"  As the sailor spoke, the boat's keel grated on the sand, and the Irishman sprang over the side, followed by his comrades, who regarded the expedition in the light of a \"good spree.\"  The party had to wait some time, however, for the anticipated sport.  It was near sunset when they landed, but turtles are not always ready to deliver themselves up, even though the honour of being eaten by London aldermen sometimes awaits them!  It is usually night before the creatures come out of the sea to enjoy a snooze on the beach.  The men did not remain idle, however.  They dragged the boat a considerable distance from the water, and then turned it keel up, supporting one gunwale on several forked sticks, so that a convenient shelter was provided.  This look-out house was still further improved by having a soft carpet of leaves and grass spread beneath it.  When these preparations had been made, those men, who had never seen turtle-turning performed, were instructed in their duties by an experienced hand.  The process being simple, the explanation was short and easy.  \"You see, lads,\" said the instructor, leaning against the boat and stuffing down the glowing tobacco in his pipe with the point of his (apparently) fireproof little finger--\"You see, lads, this is 'ow it is. All that you've got for to do is to keep parfitly still till the turtles comes out o' the sea, d'ye see?--then, as the Dook o' Wellin'ton said at Waterloo--Up boys an' at 'em!  W'en, ov coorse, each man fixes his eyes on the turtle nearest him, runs out, ketches him by the rim of his shell an' turns him slap over on his back--d'ye understand?\"  \"Clear as ditch wather,\" said Larry.  \"Humph!\" said Muggins.  \"Well, then, boys,\" continued the old salt with the fireproof little finger, \"ye'd better go an' count the sand or the stars (when they comes out), for there won't be nothin' to do for an hour to come.\"  Having delivered himself thus, he refilled his pipe and lay down to enjoy it under the boat, while the others followed his example, or sauntered along the shore, or wandered among the bushes, until the time for action should arrive.  Will Osten and his two friends availed themselves of the opportunity to retire and hold an earnest consultation as to their future prospects and plans.  As this was the first time they had enjoyed a chance of conversing without the fear of being overheard, they made the most of it, and numerous were the projects which were proposed and rejected in eager earnest tones--at least on the part of Larry and Will.  As for Muggins, although always earnest, he was never eager.  Tremendous indeed must have been the influence which could rouse him into a state of visible excitement!  During the discussion the other two grew so warm that they forgot all about time and turtles, and would certainly have prolonged their talk for another hour had not one of the men appeared, telling them to clap a stopper on their potato-traps and return to the boat, as the sport was going to begin.  The moon had risen and commenced her course through a sky which was so clear that the planets shone like resplendent jewels, and the distant stars like diamond dust.  Not a breath of air ruffled the surface of the sea; nevertheless, its slumbering energies were indicated by the waves on the outlying coral reef, which, approaching one by one, slowly and solemnly, fell with what can only be called a quiet roar, hissed gently for a moment on the sand, and then passed with a sigh into absolute silence.  \"Don't it seem as if the sea wor sleepin',\" whispered one of the men, while they all lay watching under the boat.  \"Ay, an' snorin' too,\" answered another.  \"Whisht!\" exclaimed a third, \"if old Neptune hears ye, he'll wake up an' change his tune.\"  \"Och, sure he's woke up already,\" whispered Larry, pointing with great excitement to a dark object which at that moment appeared to emerge from the sea.  \"Mum's the word, boys,\" whispered the old salt who had charge of the party; \"the critters are comin', an' England expec's every man for to do his dooty, as old Nelson said.\"  In the course of a few minutes several more dark objects emerged from the sea, and waddled with a kind of sigh or low grunt slowly up the beach, where they lay, evidently intending to have a nap!  With breathless but eager interest, the sailors lay perfectly still, until fifteen of the dark objects were on the sands, and sufficient time was allowed them to fall into their first nap.  Then the word \"Turn\" was given, and, leaping up, each man rushed swiftly but silently upon his prey!  The turtles were pounced upon so suddenly that, almost before they were wide awake, they were caught; a bursting cheer followed, and instantly ten splendid animals were turned over on their backs, in which position, being unable to turn again, they lay flapping their flippers violently.  \"That's the way to go it,\" shouted one of the men who, after turning his turtle, dashed after one of the other five which were now hastening back to the sea, with laborious but slow haste.  His comrades followed suit instantly with a wild cheer.  Now, to the uninitiated, this was the only moment of danger in that bloodless fight.  Being aware of his incapacity for swift flight, the turtle, when in the act of running away from danger, makes use of each flipper alternately in dashing the sand to an incredible height behind and around him, to the endangering of the pursuer's eyes, if he be not particularly careful.  Sometimes incautious men have their eyes so filled with sand in this way that it almost blinds them for a time, and severe inflammation is occasionally the result.  The old salt--Peter Grant by name, but better known among his shipmates as Old Peter--was well aware of this habit of the turtle; but, having a spice of mischief in him, he said nothing about it.  The consequences were severe on some of the men, particularly on Muggins.  Our sedate friend was the only one who failed to turn a turtle at the first rush. He had tripped over a stone at starting, and when he gathered himself up and ran to the scene of action, the turtles were in full retreat.

Shirley says (post, p. 70),--      It has no window, all the light admitted entering through an     aperture where there _will_ be a door when it becomes cold enough     for such a luxury.  Describing the service, the Doctor says, in part,--      After a long and wandering impromptu prayer by somebody, a prayer     which \"Shirley\" found disagreeable (since she herself was a     churchwoman, and missed the burial service), the procession,     containing twenty men and three women, set out.  Shirley was not, at that time, a churchwoman, and her account of the prayer, etc., is,--      About twenty men, with the three women of the place, had assembled     at the funeral. An extempore prayer was made, filled with all the     peculiarities usual to that style of petition. Ah, how different     from the soothing verses of the glorious burial service of the     church!  It may not be inappropriate here to note that the baby referred to in the two immediately preceding pages is none other than the original of The Luck in Bret Harte's Luck of Roaring Camp. How the funeral scene as described by Shirley was adapted by this master of short-story writing, and how skillfully he combined it with the birth of The Luck, may be perceived in the two paragraphs following.      [Shirley, post, p. 70.] On a board, supported by two butter-tubs,     was extended the body of the dead woman, covered with a sheet. By     its side stood the coffin, of unstained pine, lined with white     cambric.      [The Luck of Roaring Camp, Overland, vol. i, p. 184.] Beside the     low bunk or shelf, on which the figure of the mother was starkly     outlined below the blankets, stood a pine table. On this a     candle-box was placed, and within it, swathed in staring red     flannel, lay the last arrival at Roaring Camp.  Bancroft (History of California, vol. vii, p. 724), speaking of early California literature, says,--      Mining life in California furnished inexhaustible material;... and     almost every book produced in the golden era gave specimens more or     less entertaining of the wit and humor developed by the struggle     with homelessness, physical suffering, and mental gloom. And when,     perchance, a writer had never heard original tales of the kind he     felt himself expected to relate, he took them at second-hand....     Even the most powerful of Bret Harte's stories borrowed their     incidents from the letters of Mrs. Laura A. K. Clapp, who under the     nom de plume of 'Shirley,' wrote a series of letters published in     the _Pioneer Magazine_, 1851-2. The 'Luck of Roaring Camp' was     suggested by incidents related in Letter II., p. 174-6 of vol. i.     of the _Pioneer_. In Letter XIX., p. 103-10 of vol. iv., is the     suggestion of the 'Outcasts of Poker Flat.' Mrs. Clapp's simple     epistolary style narrates the facts, and Harte's exquisite style     imparts to them the glamour of imagination.  The temptation cannot be resisted, at this point, to pursue the history of The Luck of Roaring Camp a little further. The reader will kindly remember that no changes are made in printing extracts. Mr. T. Edgar Pemberton, in his Bret Harte: A Treatise and a Tribute (London, 1900), says, in referring to criticism of the story when it was first in type,--      Mr. Noah Brooks has recorded this strange incident as follows:--      'Perhaps I may be pardoned,' he says, 'for a brief reference to an     odd complication that arose while _The Luck of Roaring Camp_ was     being put into type in the printing office where _The Overland     Monthly_ was prepared for publication. A young lady who served as     proof-reader in the establishment had been somewhat shocked by the     scant morals of the mother of Luck, and when she came to the scene     where Kentuck, after reverently fondling the infant, said, \"he     wrastled with my finger, the d----d little cuss,\" the indignant     proof-reader was ready to throw up her engagement rather than go     any further with a story so wicked and immoral. There was     consternation throughout the establishment, and the head of the     concern went to the office of the publisher with the virginal     proof-reader's protest. Unluckily, Mr. Roman was absent from the     city. Harte, when notified of the obstacle raised in the way of     _The Luck of Roaring Camp_, manfully insisted that the story must     be printed as he wrote it, or not at all. Mr. Roman's _locum     tenens_ in despair brought the objectionable manuscript around to     my office and asked my advice. When I had read the sentence that     had caused all this turmoil, having first listened to the tale of     the much-bothered temporary publisher, I surprised him by a burst     of laughter. It seemed to me incredible that such a tempest in a     tea-cup could have been raised by Harte's bit of character     sketching. But, recovering my gravity, I advised that the whole     question should await Mr. Roman's return. I was sure that he would     never consent to any \"editing\" of Harte's story. This was agreed     to, and when the publisher came back, a few days later, the embargo     was removed. _The Luck of Roaring Camp_ was printed as it was     written, and printing office and vestal proof-reader survived the     shock.'      It is amazing to think that, but for the determination and     self-confidence of quite a young author, a story that has gladdened     and softened the hearts of thousands,--a story that has drawn     welcome smiles and purifying tears from all who can appreciate its     deftly-mingled humour and pathos,--a story that has been a boon to     humanity--might have been sacrificed to the shallow ruling of a     prudish 'young-lady' proof-reader, and a narrow-minded, pharisaical     deacon-printer!      It is appalling to think what might have happened if through     nervousness or modesty the writer had been frightened by the     premature criticisms of this precious pair.  The \"deacon-printer\" mentioned by Pemberton was Jacob Bacon, a fine specimen of the printer of the latter half of the last century. He was the junior partner of the firm of Towne and Bacon, the printers of Harte's _first_ volume, The Lost Galleon. Mr. Towne (not _Tane_, as spelled in Merwin's Life of Bret Harte) obtained judgment in Boston for the printing of that volume. (See further, Mrs. T. B. Aldrich's Crowding Memories, as to satisfaction of judgment.)  A half-tone portrait of the \"prudish 'young-lady' proof-reader\" (what a lacerating taunt!) is printed in the Bret Harte Memorial Number of the Overland (September, 1902).  The proof-readers have not dealt kindly with The Luck of Roaring Camp; but the first of that ilk to mutilate the story was also the worst, to wit, the aforesaid \"prudish 'young-lady' proof-reader.\"  Good usage in typography was utterly unknown to this young lady,--punctuation, capitalization, the use of the hyphen in dividing and compounding words. In practice she did not--perhaps could not--recognize any distinction between a cipher and a lower-case _o_. As to spelling, one may find \"etherial,\" \"azalias,\" \"tessallated.\"  Noah Brooks, in the Overland Memorial Number, says (p. 203),--      He [Bret Harte] collected some half-dozen stories and poems and     they were printed in a volume entitled \"The Luck of Roaring Camp     and Other Sketches,\" (1870.)  There were no poems printed in that volume. It was published in Boston by Fields, Osgood, & Co. Printed at the University Press at Cambridge, then unquestionably the best book-printing house in the United States, of course many of the typographical errors were weeded out. This volume was reprinted in London by John Camden Hotten.  It is to be regretted that the University Press was not more painstaking in the proof-reading, for the Overland typographical perversions persist in some instances to the present day. The reader is not misled by the lubbering punctuation of the sentence, \"She was a coarse, and, it is to be feared, a very sinful woman.\" The usage in such a construction is, \"She was a coarse, and it is to be feared a very sinful, woman.\" But note where the sense is affected:--      Cherokee Sal was sinking fast. Within an hour she had climbed, as     it were, that rugged road that led to the stars, and so passed out     of Roaring Camp, its sin and shame forever.  Cherokee Sal could not possibly be the sin and shame of Roaring Camp forever; hence the sense calls for a comma after \"shame,\" in the extract. It is gratifying to note that the comma is used in the Hotten reprint.  Another egregious blunder which has persisted is the printing of the word \"past\" for \"passed,\" in the extract below.      Then he [Kentuck] walked up the gulch, past the cabin, still     whistling with demonstrative unconcern. At a large redwood tree he     paused and retraced his steps, and again passed the cabin.  It remained for a proof-reader at the Riverside Press to reconstruct the sentence by deleting the comma after the word \"gulch\"; thus, \"the gulch past the cabin.\" That Kentuck \"again passed the cabin\" seems not to have been considered. Hence, in the Houghton Mifflin Company's printings of The Luck of Roaring Camp, the last error is worse than the first.  These errors are not venial. Those that are such have not been mentioned, as they occur in almost every book, and appear to be unavoidable. Other errors, evincing a lack of knowledge of good usage in book-typography, must also pass unnoticed.  The Luck of Roaring Camp having been disposed of, consideration of Dr. Royce's review of the Shirley Letters will be resumed.  The Doctor, on page 350 of his work, says, \"In her little library she had a Bible, a prayer-book, Shakespeare, and Lowell's 'Fable for the Critics,' with two or three other books.\" Shirley (p. 100, post) says she had a--      Bible and prayer-book, Shakespeare, Spenser, Coleridge, Shelley,     Keats, Lowell's Fable for Critics, Walton's Complete Angler, and     some"]]]
