We have given orders at Council this afternoon to draw all the standing forces to Stirling, and has sent to the west country to raise all the fencible men, and Sir John Lanier has write to the English forces in Northumberland to march in here, and is going to Stirling to command, for Mackay is either killed or taken by all the account we have yet got, but you shall quickly have another flying packet or an express.

(Edinburgh: Bannatyne Club, 1833.)   Being come up to the advanced party he[2] saw some small parties of the enemy, the matter of a short mile, marching slowly along the foot of a hill which lay towards Blair, marching towards us; whereupon he sent orders to Balfour to march up to him in all haste with the foot. But presently upon that order, having discovered some bodies of them marching down an high hill, within a quarter of a mile to the place where he stood, when the gross[3] of their body appeared, fearing that they should take possession of an eminence just above the ground where our forces halted on, of a steep and difficult ascent, full of trees and shrubs, and within a carbine shot of the place whereon we stood, whereby they could undoubtedly force us with their fire in confusion over the river, he galloped back in all haste to the forces, and having made every battalion form by a Quart de Conversion to the right upon the ground they stood, made them march each before his face up the hill, by which means he prevented that inconveniency, and got a ground fair enough to receive the enemy, but not to attack them, there being, within a short musket shot to it, another eminence before our front, as we stood when we were up the lowest hill, near the river, whereof Dundee had already got possession before we could be well up, and had his back to a very high hill, which is the ordinary maxim of Highlanders, who never fight against regular forces upon anything of equal terms, without a sure retreat at their back, particularly if their enemies be provided of horse; and to be sure of their escape, in case of a repulse, they attack bare footed, without any clothing but their shirts, and a little Highland doublet, whereby they are certain to outrun any foot, and will not readily engage where horse can follow the chase any distance.... Shortly thereafter, and about half an hour before sunset, they began to move down the hill.  The General had already commanded the officers, commanding battalions, to begin their firing at the distance of 100 paces by platoons, to discourage the approaching Highlanders, meeting with continual fire: That part of their forces which stood opposite to Hastings, who had the right of all, before the Generals', Levin's and Kenmore's regiments, came down briskly together with their horse, and notwithstanding of a brisk fire, particularly from the General's own battalion, whereby many of the chief gentlemen of the name of Macdonald, who attacked it, were killed, pushed their point, after they had fired their light pieces at some distance, which made little or no execution, with sword in hand, tho' in great confusion, which is their usual way. Which when the General observed, he called to the Lord Belhaven to march up with the first troop of horse, ordering him to flank to the left hand the enemy, the fire being then past on all hands, and coming to handy strokes if our men had stood, appointing the second troop to do the same to the right; but scarcely had Belhaven got them without the front of the line, where they had orders to wheel for the flank, tho' their very appearance made the enemy turn away from the place where they saw the horse coming up, but contrary to orders, they began to pass, not knowing whereat, and presently turned about, as did also Kenmore's and the half of Levin's battalion.  The General, observing the horse come to a stand, and firing in confusion, and the foot beginning to fall away from him, thinking happily that the horse would be picked to follow his example, and in all cases to disengage himself out of the crowd of Highlanders which came down just upon the place where he was calling to the officers of the horse to follow him, spurr'd his horse through the enemy, (where no body nevertheless followed him, but one of his servants, whose horse was shot in passing).... Having passed through the crowd of attacking Highlanders, he turned about to see how matters stood, and found that all his left had given way, and got down the hill which was behind our line, ranged a little above the brow thereof, so that in the twinkling of an eye in a manner, our men, as well as the enemy, were out of sight, being got down pall mall to the river where our baggage stood....  The enemy lost on the field six for our one, the fire to our right having been continued and brisk, whereby not only Dundee, with several gentlemen of quality of the countys of Angus and Perth, but also many of the best gentlemen among the Highlanders, particularly of the Macdonalds of the Isles and Glengarie, were killed, coming down the hill upon Hastings, the General, and Levin's regiments, which made the best fire and all the execution....  The General having got the small rests of his forces safely over the river, and seeing no disposition, so far as he could discern, of the enemy to pursue him, he bethought himself which way he had best retire; and notwithstanding of the contrary advice of all the officers who would have him to descend the plain country of Athole to Dunkeld and Perth, he resolved rather to march into the Highlands three or four miles, and then over to Strath Tay and along the foot of the hills, over the Castle of Drummond, where he had a garrison, to Stirling, whither he resolved to make all the speed possible, to fall upon some present measures.

But before we start I must ask you a few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.\"  The other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his more controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion of the clergyman.  He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze fixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together. His pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which had befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something of the horror of the scene.  \"Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,\" said he eagerly.  \"It is a bad thing to speak of, but I will answer you the truth.\"  \"Tell me about last night.\"  \"Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder brother George proposed a game of whist afterwards.  We sat down about nine o'clock.  It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go.  I left them all round the table, as merry as could be.\"  \"Who let you out?\"  \"Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out.  I shut the hall door behind me.  The window of the room in which they sat was closed, but the blind was not drawn down.  There was no change in door or window this morning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been to the house.  Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and Brenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the chair.  I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as I live.\"  \"The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,\" said Holmes.  \"I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any way account for them?\"  \"It's devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis. \"It is not of this world.  Something has come into that room which has dashed the light of reason from their minds.  What human contrivance could do that?\"  \"I fear,\" said Holmes, \"that if the matter is beyond humanity it is certainly beyond me.  Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations before we fall back upon such a theory as this.  As to yourself, Mr. Tregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family, since they lived together and you had rooms apart?\"  \"That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We were a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a company, and so retired with enough to keep us.  I won't deny that there was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood between us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we were the best of friends together.\"  \"Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything stand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the tragedy?  Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help me.\"  \"There is nothing at all, sir.\"  \"Your people were in their usual spirits?\"  \"Never better.\"  \"Were they nervous people?  Did they ever show any apprehension of coming danger?\"  \"Nothing of the kind.\"  \"You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?\"  Mortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.  \"There is one thing occurs to me,\" said he at last.  \"As we sat at the table my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my partner at cards, was facing it.  I saw him once look hard over my shoulder, so I turned round and looked also.  The blind was up and the window shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it seemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them.  I couldn't even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was something there.  When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me that he had the same feeling.  That is all that I can say.\"  \"Did you not investigate?\"  \"No; the matter passed as unimportant.\"  \"You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?\"  \"None at all.\"  \"I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.\"  \"I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This morning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook me.  He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent message.  I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we looked into that dreadful room.  The candles and the fire must have burned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark until dawn had broken.  The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at least six hours.  There were no signs of violence.  She just lay across the arm of the chair with that look on her face.  George and Owen were singing snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes.  Oh, it was awful to see!  I couldn't stand it, and the doctor was as white as a sheet.  Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we nearly had him on our hands as well.\"  \"Remarkable--most remarkable!\" said Holmes, rising and taking his hat. \"I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without further delay.  I confess that I have seldom known a case which at first sight presented a more singular problem.\"   Our proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the investigation.  It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident which left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding, country lane.  While we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a carriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass.  As it drove by us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly contorted, grinning face glaring out at us.  Those staring eyes and gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.  \"My brothers!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. \"They are taking them to Helston.\"  We looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way. Then we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they had met their strange fate.  It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with a considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well filled with spring flowers.  Towards this garden the window of the sitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis, must have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single instant blasted their minds.  Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully among the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch. So absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over the watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the garden path.  Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish housekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked after the wants of the family.  She readily answered all Holmes's questions.  She had heard nothing in the night.  Her employers had all been in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more cheerful and prosperous.  She had fainted with horror upon entering the room in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table. She had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning air in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for the doctor.  The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her. It took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage. She would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting that very afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.  We ascended the stairs and viewed the body.  Miss Brenda Tregennis had been a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age.  Her dark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still lingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been her last human emotion.  From her bedroom we descended to the sitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred.  The charred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate.  On the table were the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered over its surface.  The chairs had been moved back against the walls, but all else was as it had been the night before.  Holmes paced with light, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs, drawing them up and reconstructing their positions.  He tested how much of the garden was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the fireplace; but never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes and tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some gleam of light in this utter darkness.  \"Why a fire?\" he asked once.  \"Had they always a fire in this small room on a spring evening?\"  Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that reason, after his arrival, the fire was lit.  \"What are you going to do now, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.  My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm.  \"I think, Watson, that I shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often and so justly condemned,\" said he.  \"With your permission, gentlemen, we will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new factor is likely to come to our notice here.  I will turn the facts over in my mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will certainly communicate with you and the vicar.  In the meantime I wish you both good-morning.\"  It was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes broke his complete and absorbed silence.  He sat coiled in his armchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue swirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead contracted, his eyes vacant and far away.  Finally he laid down his pipe and sprang to his feet.  \"It won't do, Watson!\" said he with a laugh.  \"Let us walk along the cliffs together and search for flint arrows.  We are more likely to find them than clues to this problem.  To let the brain work"]]]
