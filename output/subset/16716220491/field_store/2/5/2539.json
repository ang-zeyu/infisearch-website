There is no excuse for the way you are behaving. Maud is a charming girl--\"  \"Oh, absolutely! One of the best.\"  \"Very well, then!\"  \"But, mater, what I mean to say is--\"  \"I don't want any more temporizing, Reggie!\"  \"No, no! Absolutely not!\" said Reggie dutifully, wishing he knew what the word meant, and wishing also that life had not become so frightfully complex.  \"Now, this afternoon, why should you not take Maud for a long ride in your car?\"  Reggie grew more cheerful. At least he had an answer for that.  \"Can't be done, I'm afraid. I've got to motor into town to meet Percy. He's arriving from Oxford this morning. I promised to meet him in town and tool him back in the car.\"  \"I see. Well, then, why couldn't you--?\"  \"I say, mater, dear old soul,\" said Reggie hastily, \"I think you'd better tear yourself away and what not. If you're catching the twelve-fifteen, you ought to be staggering round to see you haven't forgotten anything. There's the car coming round now.\"  \"I wish now I had decided to go by a later train.\"  \"No, no, mustn't miss the twelve-fifteen. Good, fruity train. Everybody speaks well of it. Well, see you anon, mater. I think you'd better run like a hare.\"  \"You will remember what I said?\"  \"Oh, absolutely!\"  \"Good-bye, then. I shall be back tomorrow.\"  Reggie returned slowly to his stone seat. He breathed a little heavily as he felt for his cigarette case. He felt like a hunted fawn.  Maud came out of the house as the car disappeared down the long avenue of elms. She crossed the terrace to where Reggie sat brooding on life and its problem.  \"Reggie!\"  Reggie turned.  \"Hullo, Maud, dear old thing. Take a seat.\"  Maud sat down beside him. There was a flush on her pretty face, and when she spoke her voice quivered with suppressed excitement.  \"Reggie,\" she said, laying a small hand on his arm. \"We're friends, aren't we?\"  Reggie patted her back paternally. There were few people he liked better than Maud.  \"Always have been since the dear old days of childhood, what!\"  \"I can trust you, can't I?\"  \"Absolutely!\"  \"There's something I want you to do for me, Reggie. You'll have to keep it a dead secret of course.\"  \"The strong, silent man. That's me. What is it?\"  \"You're driving into town in your car this afternoon, aren't you, to meet Percy?\"  \"That was the idea.\"  \"Could you go this morning instead--and take me?\"  \"Of course.\"  Maud shook her head.  \"You don't know what you are letting yourself in for, Reggie, or I'm sure you wouldn't agree so lightly. I'm not allowed to leave the castle, you know, because of what I was telling you about.\"  \"The chappie?\"  \"Yes. So there would be terrible scenes if anybody found out.\"  \"Never mind, dear old soul. I'll risk it. None shall learn your secret from these lips.\"  \"You're a darling, Reggie.\"  \"But what's the idea? Why do you want to go today particularly?\"  Maud looked over her shoulder.  \"Because--\" She lowered her voice, though there was no one near. \"Because he is back in London! He's a sort of secretary, you know, Reggie, to his uncle, and I saw in the paper this morning that the uncle returned yesterday after a long voyage in his yacht. So--he must have come back, too. He has to go everywhere his uncle goes.\"  \"And everywhere the uncle went, the chappie was sure to go!\" murmured Reggie. \"Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.\"  \"I must see him. I haven't seen him since last summer--nearly a whole year! And he hasn't written to me, and I haven't dared to write to him, for fear of the letter going wrong. So, you see, I must go. Today's my only chance. Aunt Caroline has gone away. Father will be busy in the garden, and won't notice whether I'm here or not. And, besides, tomorrow it will be too late, because Percy will be here. He was more furious about the thing than anyone.\"  \"Rather the proud aristocrat, Percy,\" agreed Reggie. \"I understand absolutely. Tell me just what you want me to do.\"  \"I want you to pick me up in the car about half a mile down the road. You can drop me somewhere in Piccadilly. That will be near enough to where I want to go. But the most important thing is about Percy. You must persuade him to stay and dine in town and come back here after dinner. Then I shall be able to get back by an afternoon train, and no one will know I've been gone.\"  \"That's simple enough, what? Consider it done. When do you want to start?\"  \"At once.\"  \"I'll toddle round to the garage and fetch the car.\" Reggie chuckled amusedly. \"Rum thing! The mater's just been telling me I ought to take you for a drive.\"  \"You are a darling, Reggie, really!\"  Reggie gave her back another paternal pat.  \"I know what it means to be in love, dear old soul. I say, Maud, old thing, do you find love puts you off your stroke? What I mean is, does it make you slice your approach-shots?\"  Maud laughed.  \"No. It hasn't had any effect on my game so far. I went round in eighty-six the other day.\"  Reggie sighed enviously.  \"Women are wonderful!\" he said. \"Well, I'll be legging it and fetching the car. When you're ready, stroll along down the road and wait for me.\"                      *   *   *  When he had gone Maud pulled a small newspaper clipping from her pocket. She had extracted it from yesterday's copy of the Morning Post's society column. It contained only a few words:       \"Mr. Wilbur Raymond has returned to his residence at     No. 11a Belgrave Square from a prolonged voyage in his     yacht, the Siren.\"  Maud did not know Mr. Wilbur Raymond, and yet that paragraph had sent the blood tingling through every vein in her body. For as she had indicated to Reggie, when the Wilbur Raymonds of this world return to their town residences, they bring with them their nephew and secretary, Geoffrey Raymond. And Geoffrey Raymond was the man Maud had loved ever since the day when she had met him in Wales.    CHAPTER 2.  The sun that had shone so brightly on Belpher Castle at noon, when Maud and Reggie Byng set out on their journey, shone on the West-End of London with equal pleasantness at two o'clock. In Little Gooch Street all the children of all the small shopkeepers who support life in that backwater by selling each other vegetables and singing canaries were out and about playing curious games of their own invention. Cats washed themselves on doorsteps, preparatory to looking in for lunch at one of the numerous garbage cans which dotted the sidewalk. Waiters peered austerely from the windows of the two Italian restaurants which carry on the Lucretia Borgia tradition by means of one shilling and sixpenny _table d'h√¥te_ luncheons. The proprietor of the grocery store on the corner was bidding a silent farewell to a tomato which even he, though a dauntless optimist, had been compelled to recognize as having outlived its utility. On all these things the sun shone with a genial smile. Round the corner, in Shaftesbury Avenue, an east wind was doing its best to pierce the hardened hides of the citizenry; but it did not penetrate into Little Gooch Street, which, facing south and being narrow and sheltered, was enabled practically to bask.  Mac, the stout guardian of the stage door of the Regal Theatre, whose gilded front entrance is on the Avenue, emerged from the little glass case in which the management kept him, and came out to observe life and its phenomena with an indulgent eye. Mac was feeling happy this morning. His job was a permanent one, not influenced by the success or failure of the productions which followed one another at the theatre throughout the year; but he felt, nevertheless, a sort of proprietary interest in these ventures, and was pleased when they secured the approval of the public. Last night's opening, a musical piece by an American author and composer, had undoubtedly made a big hit, and Mac was glad, because he liked what he had seen of the company, and, in the brief time in which he had known him, had come to entertain a warm regard for George Bevan, the composer, who had travelled over from New York to help with the London production.  George Bevan turned the corner now, walking slowly, and, it seemed to Mac, gloomily towards the stage door. He was a young man of about twenty-seven, tall and well knit, with an agreeable, clean-cut face, of which a pair of good and honest eyes were the most noticeable feature. His sensitive mouth was drawn down a little at the corners, and he looked tired.  \"Morning, Mac.\"  \"Good morning, sir.\"  \"Anything for me?\"  \"Yes, sir. Some telegrams. I'll get 'em. Oh, I'll _get_ 'em,\" said Mac, as if reassuring some doubting friend and supporter as to his ability to carry through a labour of Hercules.  He disappeared into his glass case. George Bevan remained outside in the street surveying the frisking children with a sombre glance. They seemed to him very noisy, very dirty and very young. Disgustingly young. Theirs was joyous, exuberant youth which made a fellow feel at least sixty. Something was wrong with George today, for normally he was fond of children. Indeed, normally he was fond of most things. He was a good-natured and cheerful young man, who liked life and the great majority of those who lived it contemporaneously with himself. He had no enemies and many friends.  But today he had noticed from the moment he had got out of bed that something was amiss with the world. Either he was in the grip of some divine discontent due to the highly developed condition of his soul, or else he had a grouch. One of the two. Or it might have been the reaction from the emotions of the previous night. On the morning after an opening your sensitive artist is always apt to feel as if he had been dried over a barrel.  Besides, last night there had been a supper party after the performance at the flat which the comedian of the troupe had rented in Jermyn Street, a forced, rowdy supper party where a number of tired people with over-strained nerves had seemed to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22332"],["title","Brain Twister (#1)"],["body","I want to say that I picked you personally. Believe me, there's never been anything like it before.\"  \"I'll do my best,\" Malone said at random. He was twenty-six, and he had been an FBI agent for three years. In that time, he had, among other things, managed to break up a gang of smugglers, track down a counterfeiting ring, and capture three kidnappers. For reasons which he could neither understand nor explain, no one seemed willing to attribute his record to luck.  \"I know you will,\" Burris said. \"And if anybody can crack this case, Malone, you're the man. It's just that--everything sounds so _impossible_. Even after all the conferences we've had.\"  \"Conferences?\" Malone said vaguely. He wished the Chief would get to the point. Any point. He smiled gently across the desk and tried to look competent and dependable and reassuring. Burris' expression didn't change.  \"You'll get the conference tapes later,\" Burris said. \"You can study them before you leave. I suggest you study them very carefully, Malone. Don't be like me. Don't get confused.\" He buried his face in his hands. Malone waited patiently. After a few seconds, Burris looked up. \"Did you read books when you were a child?\" he asked.  Malone said: \"What?\"  \"Books,\" Burris said. \"When you were a child. Read them.\"  \"Sure I did,\" Malone said. _\"Bomba the Jungle Boy_, and _Doctor Doolittle_, and _Lucky Starr_, and _Little Women_--\"  _\"Little Women?\"_  \"When Beth died,\" Malone said, \"I wanted to cry. But I didn't. My father said big boys don't cry.\"  \"And your father was right,\" Burris said. \"Why, when I was a--never mind. Forget about Beth and your father. Think about Lucky Starr for a minute. Remember him?\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"I liked those books. You know it's funny, but the books you read when you're a kid, they kind of stay with you. Know what I mean? I can still remember that one about Venus, for instance. Gee, that was--\"  \"Never mind about Venus, too,\" Burris said sharply. \"Keep your mind on the problem.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. He paused. \"What problem, sir?\" he added.  \"The problem we're discussing,\" Burris said. He gave Malone a bright, blank stare. \"My God,\" he said. \"Just listen to me.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"All right, then.\" Burris took a deep breath. He seemed nervous. Once again he stood up and went to the window. This time, he spoke without turning. \"Remember how everybody used to laugh about spaceships, and orbital satellites, and life on other planets? That was just in those Lucky Starr books. That was all just for kids, wasn't it?\"  \"Well, I don't know,\" Malone said slowly.  \"Sure it was all for kids,\" Burris said. \"It was laughable. Nobody took it seriously.\"  \"Well, _somebody_ must--\"  \"You just keep quiet and listen,\" Burris said.  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said.  Burris nodded. His hands were clasped behind his back. \"We're not laughing any more, are we, Malone?\" he said without moving.  There was silence.  \"Well, are we?\"  \"Did you want me to answer, sir?\"  \"Of course I did!\" Burris snapped.  \"You told me to keep quiet and--\"  \"Never mind what I told you,\" Burris said. \"Just do what I told you.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. \"No, sir,\" he added after a second.  \"No, sir, what?\" Burris asked softly.  \"No, sir, we're not laughing any more,\" Malone said.  \"Ah,\" Burris said. \"And why aren't we laughing any more?\"  There was a little pause. Malone said, tentatively: \"Because there's nothing to laugh about, sir?\"  Burris whirled. \"On the head!\" he said happily. \"You've hit the nail on the head, Kenneth. I knew I could depend on you.\" His voice grew serious again, and thoughtful. \"We're not laughing any more because there's nothing to laugh about. We have orbital satellites, and we've landed on the Moon with an atomic rocket. The planets are the next step, and after that the stars. Man's heritage, Kenneth. The stars. And the stars, Kenneth, belong to Man--not to the Russians!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said soberly.  \"So,\" Burris said, \"we should learn not to laugh any more. But have we?\"  \"I don't know, sir.\"  \"We haven't,\" Burris said with decision. \"Can you read my mind?\"  \"No, sir,\" Malone said.  \"Can I read your mind?\"  Malone hesitated. At last he said: \"Not that I know of, sir.\"  \"Well, I can't,\" Burris snapped. \"And can any of us read each other's mind?\"  Malone shook his head. \"No, sir,\" he said.  Burris nodded. \"That's the problem,\" he said. \"That's the case I'm sending you out to crack.\"  This time, the silence was a long one.  At last, Malone said: \"What problem, sir?\"  \"Mind reading,\" Burris said. \"There's a spy at work in the Nevada plant, Kenneth. And the spy is a telepath.\"                                * * * * *  The video tapes were very clear and very complete. There were a great many of them, and it was long after nine o'clock when Kenneth Malone decided to take a break and get some fresh air. Washington was a good city for walking, even at night, and Malone liked to walk. Sometimes he pretended, even to himself, that he got his best ideas while walking, but he knew perfectly well that wasn't true. His best ideas just seemed to come to him, out of nowhere, precisely as the situation demanded them.  He was just lucky, that was all. He had a talent for being lucky. But nobody would ever believe that. A record like his was spectacular, even in the annals of the FBI, and Burris himself believed that the record showed some kind of superior ability.  Malone knew that wasn't true, but what could he do about it? After all, he didn't want to resign, did he? It was kind of romantic and exciting to be an FBI agent, even after three years. A man got a chance to travel around a lot and see things, and it was interesting. The pay was pretty good, too.  The only trouble was that, if he didn't quit, he was going to have to find a telepath.  The notion of telepathic spies just didn't sound right to Malone. It bothered him in a remote sort of way. Not that the idea of telepathy itself was alien to him--after all, he was even more aware than the average citizen that research had been going on in that field for something over a quarter of a century, and that the research was even speeding up.  But the cold fact that a telepathy-detecting device had been invented somehow shocked his sense of propriety, and his notions of privacy. It wasn't decent, that was all.  There ought to be something sacred, he told himself angrily.  He stopped walking and looked up. He was on Pennsylvania Avenue, heading toward the White House.  That was no good. He went to the corner and turned off, down the block. He had, he told himself, nothing at all to see the President about.  Not yet, anyhow.  The streets were dark and very peaceful. _I get my best ideas while walking_, Malone said without convincing himself. He thought back to the video tapes.  The report on the original use of the machine itself had been on one of the first tapes, and Malone could still see and hear it. That was one thing he did have, he reflected; his memory was pretty good.  Burris had been the first speaker on the tapes, and he'd given the serial and reference number in a cold, matter-of-fact voice. His face had been perfectly blank, and he looked just like the head of the FBI people were accustomed to seeing on their TV and newsreel screens. Malone wondered what had happened to him between the time the tapes had been made and the time he'd sent for Malone.  Maybe the whole notion of telepathy was beginning to get him, Malone thought.  Burris recited the standard tape-opening in a rapid mumble, like a priest involved in the formula of the Mass: \"Any person or agent unauthorized for this tape please refrain from viewing further, under penalties as prescribed by law.\" Then he looked off, out past the screen to the left, and said: \"Dr. Thomas O'Connor, of Westinghouse Laboratories. Will you come here, Dr. O'Connor?\"  Dr. O'Connor came into the lighted square of screen slowly, looking all around him. \"This is very fascinating,\" he said, blinking in the lamplight. \"I hadn't realized that you people took so many precautions--\"  He was, Malone thought, somewhere between fifty and sixty, tall and thin with skin so transparent that he nearly looked like a living X- ray. He had pale blue eyes and pale white hair, and, Malone thought, if there ever were a contest for the best-looking ghost, Dr. Thomas O'Connor would win it hands (or phalanges) down.  \"This is all necessary for the national security,\" Burris said, a little sternly.  \"Oh,\" Dr. O'Connor said quickly. \"I realize that, of course. Naturally. I can certainly see that.\"  \"Let's go ahead, shall we?\" Burris said.  O'Connor nodded. \"Certainly. Certainly.\"  Burris said: \"Well, then,\" and paused. After a second he started again: \"Now, Dr. O'Connor, would you please give us a sort of verbal rundown on this for our records?\"  \"Of course,\" Dr. O'Connor said. He smiled into the video cameras and cleared his throat. \"I take it you don't want an explanation of how this machine works. I mean: you don't want a technical exposition, do you?\"  \"No,\" Burris said, and added: \"Not by any means. Just tell us what it does.\"  Dr. O'Connor suddenly reminded Malone of a professor he'd had in college for one of the law courses. He had, Malone thought, the same smiling gravity of demeanor, the same condescending attitude of absolute authority. It was clear that Dr. O'Connor lived in a world of his own, a world that was not even touched by the common run of men.  \"Well,\" he began, \"to put it very simply, the device indicates whether or not a man's mental--ah--processes are being influenced by outside-- by outside influences.\" He gave the cameras another little smile. \"If you will allow me, I will demonstrate on the machine itself.\"  He took two steps that carried him out of camera range, and returned wheeling a large heavy-looking box. Dangling from the metal covering were a number of wires and attachments. A long cord led from the box to the floor and snaked out of sight to the"]]]
