All my instincts tell me that she is in London, but as we have at present no possible means of telling where, we can only take the obvious steps, eat our dinner, and possess our souls in patience. Later in the evening I will stroll down and have a word with friend Lestrade at Scotland Yard.\"  But neither the official police nor Holmes's own small but very efficient organization sufficed to clear away the mystery.  Amid the crowded millions of London the three persons we sought were as completely obliterated as if they had never lived. Advertisements were tried, and failed.  Clues were followed, and led to nothing.  Every criminal resort which Shlessinger might frequent was drawn in vain. His old associates were watched, but they kept clear of him.  And then suddenly, after a week of helpless suspense there came a flash of light.  A silver-and-brilliant pendant of old Spanish design had been pawned at Bovington's, in Westminster Road.  The pawner was a large, clean-shaven man of clerical appearance.  His name and address were demonstrably false.  The ear had escaped notice, but the description was surely that of Shlessinger.  Three times had our bearded friend from the Langham called for news--the third time within an hour of this fresh development. His clothes were getting looser on his great body.  He seemed to be wilting away in his anxiety.  \"If you will only give me something to do!\" was his constant wail.  At last Holmes could oblige him.  \"He has begun to pawn the jewels.  We should get him now.\"  \"But does this mean that any harm has befallen the Lady Frances?\"  Holmes shook his head very gravely.  \"Supposing that they have held her prisoner up to now, it is clear that they cannot let her loose without their own destruction.  We must prepare for the worst.\"  \"What can I do?\"  \"These people do not know you by sight?\"  \"No.\"  \"It is possible that he will go to some other pawnbroker in the future. In that case, we must begin again.  On the other hand, he has had a fair price and no questions asked, so if he is in need of ready-money he will probably come back to Bovington's.  I will give you a note to them, and they will let you wait in the shop.  If the fellow comes you will follow him home.  But no indiscretion, and, above all, no violence.  I put you on your honour that you will take no step without my knowledge and consent.\"  For two days the Hon. Philip Green (he was, I may mention, the son of the famous admiral of that name who commanded the Sea of Azof fleet in the Crimean War) brought us no news.  On the evening of the third he rushed into our sitting-room, pale, trembling, with every muscle of his powerful frame quivering with excitement.  \"We have him!  We have him!\" he cried.  He was incoherent in his agitation.  Holmes soothed him with a few words and thrust him into an armchair.  \"Come, now, give us the order of events,\" said he.  \"She came only an hour ago.  It was the wife, this time, but the pendant she brought was the fellow of the other.  She is a tall, pale woman, with ferret eyes.\"  \"That is the lady,\" said Holmes.  \"She left the office and I followed her.  She walked up the Kennington Road, and I kept behind her.  Presently she went into a shop.  Mr. Holmes, it was an undertaker's.\"  My companion started.  \"Well?\" he asked in that vibrant voice which told of the fiery soul behind the cold gray face.  \"She was talking to the woman behind the counter. I entered as well. 'It is late,' I heard her say, or words to that effect. The woman was excusing herself.  'It should be there before now,' she answered.  'It took longer, being out of the ordinary.'  They both stopped and looked at me, so I asked some questions and then left the shop.\"  \"You did excellently well.  What happened next?\"  \"The woman came out, but I had hid myself in a doorway.  Her suspicions had been aroused, I think, for she looked round her. Then she called a cab and got in.  I was lucky enough to get another and so to follow her.  She got down at last at No. 36, Poultney Square, Brixton.  I drove past, left my cab at the corner of the square, and watched the house.\"  \"Did you see anyone?\"  \"The windows were all in darkness save one on the lower floor. The blind was down, and I could not see in.  I was standing there, wondering what I should do next, when a covered van drove up with two men in it.  They descended, took something out of the van, and carried it up the steps to the hall door.  Mr. Holmes, it was a coffin.\"  \"Ah!\"  \"For an instant I was on the point of rushing in.  The door had been opened to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had opened it.  But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me, and I think that she recognized me.  I saw her start, and she hastily closed the door. I remembered my promise to you, and here I am.\"  \"You have done excellent work,\" said Holmes, scribbling a few words upon a half-sheet of paper.  \"We can do nothing legal without a warrant, and you can serve the cause best by taking this note down to the authorities and getting one.  There may be some difficulty, but I should think that the sale of the jewellery should be sufficient. Lestrade will see to all details.\"  \"But they may murder her in the meanwhile.  What could the coffin mean, and for whom could it be but for her?\"  \"We will do all that can be done, Mr. Green.  Not a moment will be lost.  Leave it in our hands.  Now Watson,\" he added as our client hurried away, \"he will set the regular forces on the move. We are, as usual, the irregulars, and we must take our own line of action.  The situation strikes me as so desperate that the most extreme measures are justified.  Not a moment is to be lost in getting to Poultney Square.  \"Let us try to reconstruct the situation,\" said he as we drove swiftly past the Houses of Parliament and over Westminster Bridge.  \"These villains have coaxed this unhappy lady to London, after first alienating her from her faithful maid.  If she has written any letters they have been intercepted.  Through some confederate they have engaged a furnished house.  Once inside it, they have made her a prisoner, and they have become possessed of the valuable jewellery which has been their object from the first.  Already they have begun to sell part of it, which seems safe enough to them, since they have no reason to think that anyone is interested in the lady's fate.  When she is released she will, of course, denounce them.  Therefore, she must not be released. But they cannot keep her under lock and key forever. So murder is their only solution.\"  \"That seems very clear.\"  \"Now we will take another line of reasoning.  When you follow two separate chains of thought, Watson, you will find some point of intersection which should approximate to the truth.  We will start now, not from the lady but from the coffin and argue backward.  That incident proves, I fear, beyond all doubt that the lady is dead.  It points also to an orthodox burial with proper accompaniment of medical certificate and official sanction.  Had the lady been obviously murdered, they would have buried her in a hole in the back garden.  But here all is open and regular.  What does this mean?  Surely that they have done her to death in some way which has deceived the doctor and simulated a natural end--poisoning, perhaps.  And yet how strange that they should ever let a doctor approach her unless he were a confederate, which is hardly a credible proposition.\"  \"Could they have forged a medical certificate?\"  \"Dangerous, Watson, very dangerous.  No, I hardly see them doing that. Pull up, cabby!  This is evidently the undertaker's, for we have just passed the pawnbroker's.  Would you go in, Watson?  Your appearance inspires confidence.  Ask what hour the Poultney Square funeral takes place to-morrow.\"  The woman in the shop answered me without hesitation that it was to be at eight o'clock in the morning.  \"You see, Watson, no mystery; everything above-board!  In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly been complied with, and they think that they have little to fear. Well, there's nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack.  Are you armed?\"  \"My stick!\"  \"Well, well, we shall be strong enough.  'Thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just.'  We simply can't afford to wait for the police or to keep within the four corners of the law.  You can drive off, cabby. Now, Watson, we'll just take our luck together, as we have occasionally in the past.\"  He had rung loudly at the door of a great dark house in the centre of Poultney Square.  It was opened immediately, and the figure of a tall woman was outlined against the dim-lit hall.  \"Well, what do you want?\" she asked sharply, peering at us through the darkness.  \"I want to speak to Dr. Shlessinger,\" said Holmes.  \"There is no such person here,\" she answered, and tried to close the door, but Holmes had jammed it with his foot.  \"Well, I want to see the man who lives here, whatever he may call himself,\" said Holmes firmly.  She hesitated.  Then she threw open the door.  \"Well, come in!\" said she.  \"My husband is not afraid to face any man in the world.\"  She closed the door behind us and showed us into a sitting-room on the right side of the hall, turning up the gas as she left us.  \"Mr. Peters will be with you in an instant,\" she said.  Her words were literally true, for we had hardly time to look around the dusty and moth-eaten apartment in which we found ourselves before the door opened and a big, clean-shaven bald-headed man stepped lightly into the room.  He had a large red face, with pendulous cheeks, and a general air of superficial benevolence which was marred by a cruel, vicious mouth.  \"There is surely some mistake here, gentlemen,\" he said in an unctuous, make-everything-easy voice.  \"I fancy that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23488"],["title","The Jacobite Rebellions (1689-1746) (#1)"],["body","government itself.  The Marquis of Athole was a subject of great consequence, because his estate and power lay in the heart of the highlands. He had concurred in all the measures of the two royal brothers, and had been loaded with favours and honours by both. Yet, upon news of James's retreat, he flew, from restlessness of temper more than from principle, to London, while Scotland was yet in disquiet; resolved, amid contending Princes, to make the best terms for himself. He almost alone, of all those who went to London to offer their service to the Prince of Orange, returned home discontented; because his views had been too sanguine, and because he was ashamed of what he had done. His repentance he made offer of to the friends of James in Scotland, which was received, and thanked in public, but in secret distrusted.  Lord Stair had none of the external advantages of the other two. Yet, from great reach of thought, and through knowledge of men and parties gained from experience, he came to be a considerable figure in party.... Upon the restoration he attached himself to the Duke of Lauderdale. The furies of that minister he often moderated, and often opposed, openly when he could, secretly when he could not; yet still preserved his friendship. After enduring many years the loss of his rank and his country, from the injustice of the Duke of York, he, at the age of seventy, assumed again his long-neglected sword and cuirass, and came over with the Prince of Orange, who was so fond of him that he carried him in his own ship. The influence of Lord Stair in party was increased by that of his son Sir John Dalrymple, a man distinguished above all by the beauty of his person, and the power of his eloquence. To the wisdom and experience of the father, to the parts and show of the son, rather than to the power of the Duke of Hamilton, William, certain that the two former could never hope to be pardoned by James, resolved to leave the management of Scotland in the end; but, in the meantime, to make advantage of the Duke's offers of service for the settlement of that country.  Of all those nobles whom James, when Duke of York, had honoured with his friendship, and when King, graced with his favours, a few only continued openly in his interest. Of these the chief were the Duke of Gordon, a Roman Catholic, to whom James had entrusted the castle of Edinburgh, a man weak, and wavering in courage, but bound by shame and religion; Lord Balcarres attached by affection, gratitude, and that delicacy of sentiment which the love of letters commonly inspires; and Lord Dundee, who had for ever before his eyes ideas of glory, the duty of a soldier, and the example of the great Montrose, from whose family he was descended. James had entrusted the care of his civil concerns in Scotland to Balcarres, and of his military ones to Dundee. William asked both to enter into his service. Dundee refused without ceremony. Balcarres confessed the trust which had been put in him, and asked the King, if, after that, he could enter into the service of another? William generously answered, \"I cannot say that you can.\" But added, \"Take care that you fall not within the law; for otherwise I shall be forced against my will to let the law overtake you.\" The other nobles of the late King's party waited for events, in hopes and in fears from the old government and the new, intriguing with both, and depended upon by neither.     THE CONVENTION OF ESTATES (1689).      +Source.+--_Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland, from the     Dissolution of the Last Parliament of Charles II. until the     Sea-Battle off La Hogue_, vol. i., p. 218, by Sir John Dalrymple,     Bart. (London and Edinburgh: 1771.)   The convention met on the 14th of March. As the governing part of the boroughs had been modelled by King James, the members sent up from thence should have been favourable to his interests. But Lord Stair, whose views were extensive, had taken care, in the paper which contained the offer of administration to the Prince, to recommend that the borough-elections should be made by a general poll of the burgesses; an artifice which, while it took the blame of innovation off the Prince, prepared the way for securing the elections to the whigs and presbyterians. The parties at the convention first tried their strengths in the choice of a president. The Duke of Hamilton was set up by the new, the Marquis of Athole by the old court: a singular situation, where both candidates were distrusted, both by those who recommended, and by those who elected them. The former was preferred by 40 votes out of about 150 voters: a victory which, from the nature of the human mind, determined the wavering. A committee of elections was next named, consisting of nine whigs and three tories. Sir John Dalrymple, who was an able lawyer, found it easy to start objections to the returns of the opposite party, and to remove those which were made against his own. The committee in the house followed his opinions, because the necessity of the times was made the excuse of partiality....  When the convention sat down, two letters were presented, one from the present, and another from the late King of England. The convention read both; but first passed an act, that nothing contained in the last of them should dissolve their assembly, or stop their proceeding to the settlement of the nation. James's letter was written in the terms of a conqueror and a priest; threatening the convention with punishment in this world, and damnation in the next. And, as it was counter-signed by Lord Melfort, a papist, and a minister abhorred by the presbyterians, the style and the signature hurt equally the interest which the letter was intended to serve. No answer was given. William's letter, on the contrary, was answered in strains of gratitude and respect; a distinction which sufficiently showed what might be expected with regard to the future resolutions of the assembly....  The revolution in England was brought about by a coalition of whigs and tories; but, in Scotland, by the whigs almost alone. Hence, the Scottish convention, instead of amusing themselves with school disputes about words, which, while they discovered the fine lines of party in England, had embarrassed the English convention, struck their blow without ceremony, and came to a resolution, that King James had, by his evil deeds, _forfaulted_ his right to the crown; a term which, in the language of the law of Scotland, involved in it the exclusion of all his posterity as well as his own. But, as this resolution would have comprehended the other children of James, as well as the young Prince, they agreed upon the following explanation of the word _forfaulted_. \"Agreed, that the word _forfault_, in the resolution, should imply no other alteration in the succession to the crown than the seclusion of King James, the pretended Prince of Wales, and the children that shall be procreated of either of their bodies.\" Only five opposed these resolutions....  The convention next made offer of the crown to William and Mary: a vote in which the Duke of Queensberry and the Marquis of Athole concurred, although they had refused to be present at the other. They reconciled their conduct by saying, \"That, since the throne was declared vacant by the nation, they knew none so worthy to fill it as the Prince and Princess of Orange\"--a mixture of sentiment, intended to please both Kings, but which, like most compliments of the kind, pleased neither. From an excess of zeal which betrayed the cause of it, the Duke of Hamilton demeaned himself to act the part of a clerk; reading, at the ordinary place of proclamation, the act of convention aloud to the mean multitude, who found even their own vanity hurt in the sacrifice which was made to it by the first man in the nation. With more dignity the parliament accompanied the offer of the crown with such a declaration of rights as laid open all the invasions upon the constitution, not of the late King alone, but of his brother, and ascertained every disputed pretension between the crown and the subject; for, accustomed either to trample upon their sovereigns, or to be trampled upon by them, the Scottish nation chose to leave nothing to be adjusted afterwards by the vibration between the executive and legislative powers, which had kept the English constitution almost continually in a just medium between the imperiousness of the crown and the licentiousness of the subject. The Earl of Argyle for the peers, Sir James Montgomery for the knights, and Sir John Dalrymple for the boroughs, were sent to London with the offer of the crown....  The administration of the coronation-oath of Scotland was a ceremony attended with much awe; the King holding up his right hand high, whilst he swore, and repeated each word with slowness after the person who read it. It contained a clause, that the King should root out heretics. At these words, William stopt the Earl of Argyle, who was administering the oath, and declared, he did not mean to oblige himself to become a persecutor. The commissioners answering, that such was not the meaning of the oath: \"Then,\" said the King, \"I take it in that sense only.\" Whether this scruple was the effect of affectation or of delicacy, is immaterial: it became a King, and it pleased the people.
