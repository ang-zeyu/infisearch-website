And he then remembered that the Hon. Cicero W. Gilkins, when he was president of the now defunct club, had installed a Northern man as resident chief game-protector and superintendent at the Foam Island Club House.  Marche had never even seen Herold; but, through lack of personal interest, and also because he needed somebody to look out for the property, he had continued to pay this man Herold his inconsiderable salary every year, scarcely knowing, himself, why he did not put the Foam Island shooting on the market and close up the matter for good.  \"It's been five years since I was here, Miss Herold,\" he said, smiling. \"That was in the old days of the club, when Judge Gilkins and Colonel Vyse used to come here shooting every season. But you don't remember them, I fancy.\"  \"I remember them.\"  \"Really! You must have been quite a child.\"  \"I was thirteen.\"  \"Oh, then you are eighteen, now,\" he said humorously.  Her grave, young lips were only slightly responsive to his smile.  \"You have been here a long time,\" he said. \"Do you find it lonely?\"  \"Sometimes,\" she admitted.  \"What do you do for recreation?\"  \"I don't think I know what you mean, Mr. Marche.\"  \"I mean for pleasure.\"  She looked at him out of her clear, gray eyes, then turned her gaze on the window. But she could not see through it; the pane only reflected her face darkly; and to her, for a moment, it seemed that way with her whole pent-up life, here in the Virginia marshes--no outlet, no outlook, and wherever she turned her wistful eyes only her own imprisoned self to confront her out of the dull obscurity.  \"I suppose,\" he said, watching her, \"that you sometimes go to Norfolk for a holiday?\"  \"No.\"  \"Or to Old Point, or Baltimore, perhaps?\"  She had her under lip between her teeth, now, and was looking so fixedly at the window that he thought she had not heard him.  He rose from the table, and as she turned to meet his pleasant eyes he smilingly thanked her for waiting on him.  \"And now,\" he said, \"if you will say to your father that I'd like to have a little talk with him----\"  \"Father is ill in bed,\" she said, in a low voice.  \"Oh, I'm sorry. I hope it isn't anything serious.\"  \"I--think not.\"  \"Will he be able to see me to-morrow?\"  \"I am afraid not, Mr. Marche. He--he asked me to say to you that you might safely transact any business with me. I know all about it,\" she said, speaking a little hurriedly. \"I keep the accounts, and I have every item and every bill ready for your inspection; and I can tell you exactly what condition the property is in and what lumber has been cut and what repairs have been necessary. Whenever you are ready for me, I will come into the sitting room,\" she added, \"because Jim and I have had our supper.\"  \"Very well,\" he said, smiling, \"I am ready now, if you are.\"  So she went away to rinse her hands and lay aside her apron, and in a few minutes she entered the sitting room. He rose and placed a chair for her, and she thanked him, flushing a little, and then he resumed his seat, watching her sorting over the papers in her lap.  Presently she crossed one knee over the other, and one slim, prettily shaped foot, in its shabby shoe, swung clear of its shadow on the floor. Then she handed him a sheaf of bills for his inspection, and, pencil in hand, followed the totals as he read them off aloud.  For half an hour they compared and checked off items, and he found her accounts accurate to a penny.  \"Father bought three geese and a gander from Ike Helm,\" she said. \"They were rather expensive, but two were mated, and they call very well when tied out separated. Do you think it was too expensive?\" she added timidly, showing him the bill.  \"No,\" he said, smiling. \"I think it's all right. Mated decoys are what we need, and you can wing-tip a dozen before you get one that will talk at the right time.\"  \"That is true,\" she said eagerly. \"We try our best to keep up the decoys and have nothing but talkers. Our geese are nearly all right, and our ducks are good, but our swans are _so_ vexing! They seem to be such fools, and they usually behave like silly cygnets. You will see to-morrow.\"  While she was speaking, her brother came quietly into the room with an open book in his hands, and Marche, glancing at it curiously, saw that it was a Latin grammar.  \"Where do you go to school, Jim?\" he asked.  \"Father teaches me.\"  Marche, rather astonished at the calibre of his superintendent, glanced from the boy to his sister in silence. The girl's head remained steadily lowered over the papers on her knee, but he saw her foot swinging in nervous rhythm, and he was conscious of her silent impatience at something or other, perhaps at the interruption in their business discussion.  [Illustration: \"'Well,' he said pleasantly, 'what comes next, Miss Herold?'\"]  \"Well,\" he said pleasantly, \"what comes next, Miss Herold?\"  She handed him a list of the decoys. He read it gravely, nodded, and returned it.  \"You may count them for yourself to-morrow,\" she said.  \"Not at all. I trust you entirely,\" he replied laughingly.  Then they went over the remaining matters, the condition of the pine timber, the repairs to the boats and blinds and stools, items for snaps, swivels, paint, cement, wire, none of which interested Marche as much as the silent boy reading his Latin grammar by the smoky lamp interested him, or the boy's sister bending over the papers on her knee, pencil poised in her pretty, weather-roughened hand.  \"I sent the shells from New York by express,\" he said. \"Did they arrive?\"  \"I left two hundred in your room,\" said the boy, looking up.  \"Oh, thank you, Jim.\" And, turning to his sister, who had raised her head, inquiringly, \"I suppose somebody will call me at the screech of dawn, won't they?\"  \"Do you know the new law?\" she asked.  \"No. I don't like laws, anyway,\" he said smilingly.  She smiled, too, gathering up her papers preparatory to departure. \"Nobody is allowed,\" she said, \"to put off from shore until the sun is above the horizon line. And the wardens are very strict.\" Then she rose. \"Will you excuse me? I have the dishes to do.\"  The boy laid aside his book and stood up, but his sister said:  \"Stay and study, Jim. I don't need any help.\"  And Jim resumed his seat with heightened color. A moment later, however, he went out to the kitchen.  \"Look here, Molly,\" he said, \"wha'd' you want to give me away for? He'll think I'm a sissy, helping you do dishes and things.\"  \"My dear, my dear!\" she exclaimed contritely, \"I didn't think of it. Please forgive me, Jim. Anyway, you don't really care what this man thinks about any of us----\"  \"Yes, I do! Anyway, a fellow doesn't want another fellow to think he washes dishes.\"  \"You darling! Forgive me. I wasn't thinking. It was too stupid of me.\"  \"It really was,\" said the boy, in his sweet, dignified voice, \"and I'd been telling him that I'd shot ducks, too.\"  [Illustration: \"'I'm _so_ sorry, Jim.'\"]  His sister caught him around the neck and kissed his blonde head. \"I'm _so_ sorry, Jim. He won't think of it again. If he does, he'll only respect a boy who is so good to his sister. And,\" she added, cautioning him with lifted finger, \"don't talk too much to him, Jim, no matter how nice and kind he is. I know how lonely you are and how pleasant it is to talk to a man like Mr. Marche; but remember that father doesn't wish us to say anything about ourselves or about him, so we must be careful.\"  \"Why doesn't father want us to speak about him or ourselves to Mr. Marche?\" asked the boy.  His sister had gone back to her dishes. Now, looking around over her shoulder, she said seriously, \"That is father's affair, dear, not ours.\"  \"But don't you know why?\"  \"Shame on you, Jim! What father cares to tell us he will tell us; but it's exceedingly bad manners to ask.\"  \"Is father really very ill?\"  \"I told you that to ask me such things is improper,\" said the girl, coloring. \"He has told us that he does not feel well, and that he prefers to remain in his room for a few days. That is enough for us, isn't it?\"  \"Yes,\" said the boy thoughtfully.     II   Marche, buried under a mountain of bed clothes, dreamed that people were rapping noisily on his door, and grinned in his dream, meaning to let them rap until they tired of it. Suddenly a voice sounded through his defiant slumbers, clear and charming as a golden ray parting thick clouds. The next moment he found himself awake, bolt upright in the icy dusk of his room, listening.  \"Mr. Marche! Won't you _please_ wake up and answer?\" came the clear, young voice again.  \"I _beg_ your pardon!\" he cried. \"I'll be down in a minute!\"  He heard her going away downstairs, and for a few seconds he squatted there, huddled in coverings to the chin, and eying the darkness in a sort of despair. The feverish drive of Wall Street, late suppers, and too much good fellowship had not physically hardened Marche. He was accustomed to have his bath tempered comfortably for his particular brand of physique. Breakfast, also, was a most carefully ordered informality with him.  The bitter chill smote him. Cursing the simple life, he crawled gingerly out of bed, suffered acutely while hunting for a match, lighted the kerosene lamp with stiffened fingers, and looked about him, shivering. Then, with a suppressed anathema, he stepped into his folding tub and emptied the arctic contents of the water pitcher over himself.  Half an hour later he appeared at the breakfast table, hungrier than he had been in years. There was nobody there to wait on him, but the dishes and coffee pot were piping hot, and he madly ate eggs and razor-back,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24389"],["title","Blue-Bird Weather (#2)"],["body","drank quantities of coffee, and finally set fire to a cigarette, feeling younger and happier than he had felt for ages.  Of one thing he was excitedly conscious: that dreadful and persistent dragging feeling at the nape of his neck had vanished. It didn't seem possible that it could have disappeared overnight, but it had, for the present, at least.  He went into the sitting room. Nobody was there, either, so he broke his sealed shell boxes, filled his case with sixes and fives and double B's, drew his expensive ducking gun from its case and took a look at it, buckled the straps of his hip boots to his belt, felt in the various pockets of his shooting coat to see whether matches, pipe, tobacco, vaseline, oil, shell extractor, knife, handkerchief, gloves, were in their proper places; found them so, and, lighting another cigarette, strolled contentedly around the small and almost bare room, bestowing a contented and patronizing glance upon each humble article and decoration as he passed.  Evidently this photograph, in an oval frame of old-time water gilt, was a portrait of Miss Herold's mother. What a charming face, with its delicate, high-bred nose and lips! The boy, Jim, had her mouth and nose, and his sister her eyes, slightly tilted to a slant at the outer corners--beautifully shaped eyes, he remembered.  He lingered a moment, then strolled on, viewing with tolerant indifference the few poor ornaments on the mantel, the chromos of wild ducks and shore birds, and found himself again by the lamp-lit table from which he had started his explorations.  On it were Jim's Latin book, a Bible, and several last year's magazines.  Idly he turned the flyleaf of the schoolbook. Written there was the boy's name--\"Jim, from Daddy.\"  As he was closing the cover a sudden instinct arrested his hand, and, not knowing exactly why, he reopened the book and read the inscription again. He read it again, too, with a vague sensation of familiarity with it, or with the book, or something somehow connected with it, he could not tell exactly what; but a slightly uncomfortable feeling remained as he laid aside the book and stood with brows knitted and eyes absently bent on the stove.  The next moment Jim came in, wearing a faded overcoat which he had outgrown.  \"Hello!\" said Marche, looking up. \"Are you ready for me, Jim?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"What sort of a chance have I?\"  \"I'm afraid it is blue-bird weather,\" said the boy diffidently.  Marche scowled, then smiled. \"Your sister said it would probably be that kind of weather. Well, we all have to take a sporting chance with things in general, don't we, Jim?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  Marche picked up his gun case and cartridge box. The boy offered to take them, but the young man shook his head.  \"Lead on, old sport!\" he said cheerily. \"I'm a beast of more burdens than you know anything about. How's your father, by the way?\"  \"I think father is about the same.\"  \"Doesn't he need a doctor?\"  \"No, sir, I think not.\"  \"What is it, Jim? Fever?\"  \"I don't know,\" said the boy, in a low voice. He led the way, and Marche followed him out of doors.  A gray light made plain the desolation of the scene, although the sun had not yet risen. To the south and west the sombre pine woods stretched away; eastward, a few last year's cornstalks stood, withered in the clearing, through which a rutted road ran down to the water.  \"It isn't the finest farming land in the world, is it, Jim?\" he said humorously.  \"I haven't seen any other land,\" said the boy quietly.  \"Don't you remember the Northern country at all?\"  \"No, sir--except Central Park.\"  \"Oh, you were New-Yorkers?\"  \"Yes, sir. Father----\" and he fell abruptly silent.  They were walking together down the rutted road, and Marche glanced around at him.  \"What were you going to say about your father, Jim?\"  \"Nothing.\" Then truth jogged his arm. \"I mean I was only going to say that father and mother and all of us lived there.\"  \"In New York?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Is your--your mother living?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"I think I saw her picture in the sitting room,\" he said gently. \"She must have been everything a mother should be.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Was it long ago, Jim?\"  \"When she died?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Yes, very long ago. Six years ago.\"  \"Before you came here, then?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  After they had walked in silence for a little while, Marche said, \"I suppose you have arranged for somebody to take me out?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  They emerged from the lane to the shore at the same moment, and Marche glanced about for the expected bayman.  \"Oh, there he is!\" he said, as a figure came from behind a dory and waded leisurely shoreward through the shallows--a slight figure in hip boots and wool shooting hood and coat, who came lightly across the sands to meet him. And, astonished, he looked into the gray eyes of Molly Herold.  \"Father could not take you,\" she said, without embarrassment, \"and Jim isn't quite big enough to manage the swans and geese. Do you mind my acting as your bayman?\"  \"Mind?\" he repeated. \"No, of course not. Only--it seems rather rough on you. Couldn't you have hired a bayman for me?\"  \"I will, if you wish,\" she said, her cheeks reddening. \"But, really, if you'll let me, I am perfectly accustomed to bayman's work.\"  \"Do you _want_ to do it?\"  She said, without self-consciousness, \"If it is the same to you, Mr. Marche, I had rather that the bayman's wages came to us.\"  \"Certainly--of course,\" he said hurriedly. Then, smiling: \"You look the part. I took you for a young man, at first. Now, tell me how I can help you.\"  \"Jim can do that. Still, if you don't mind handling the decoys----\"  \"Not at all,\" he said, going up to the fenced inclosures which ran from a rod or two inland down into the shallow water, making three separate yards for geese, swans, and ducks.  Jim was already in the duck pen, hustling the several dozen mallard and black ducks into an inland corral. The indignant birds, quacking a concerted protest, waddled up from the shore, and, one by one, the boy seized the suitable ones, and passed them over the fence to Marche. He handed them to Molly Herold, who waded out to the dory, a duck tucked under either arm, and slipped them deftly into the decoy-crates forward and aft.  The geese were harder to manage--great, sleek, pastel-tinted birds whose wing blows had the force of a man's fist--and they flapped and struggled and buffeted Jim till his blonde head spun; but at last Marche and Molly had them crated in the dory.  Then the wild swans' turn came--great, white creatures with black beaks and feet; and Molly and Marche were laughing as they struggled to catch them and carry them aboard.  But at last every decoy was squatting in the crates; the mast had been stepped, guns laid aboard, luncheon stowed away. Marche set his shoulder to the stern; the girl sprang aboard, and he followed; the triangular sail filled, and the boat glided out into the sound, straight into the glittering lens of the rising sun.  A great winter gull flapped across their bows; in the lee of Starfish Island, long strings of wild ducks rose like shredded clouds, and, swarming in the sky, swinging, drifting, sheered eastward, out toward the unseen Atlantic.  \"Bluebills and sprigs,\" said the girl, resting her elbow on the tiller. \"There are geese on the shoal, yonder. They've come out from Currituck. Oh, I'm afraid it's to be blue-bird weather, Mr. Marche.\"  \"I'm afraid it is,\" he assented, smiling. \"What do you do in that case, Miss Herold?\"  \"Go to sleep in the blind,\" she admitted, with a faint smile, the first delicate approach to anything resembling the careless confidence of camaraderie that had yet come from her.  \"See the ducks!\" she said, as bunch after bunch parted from the water, distantly, yet all around them, and, gathering like clouds of dusky bees, whirled away through the sky until they seemed like bands of smoke high drifting. Presently she turned and looked back, signaling adieu to the shore, where her brother lifted his arm in response, then turned away inland.  \"That's a nice boy,\" said Marche briefly, and glanced up to see in his sister's face the swift and exquisite transformation that requires no words as answer.  \"You seem to like him,\" said he, laughing.  Molly Herold's gray eyes softened; pride, that had made the love in them brilliant, faded until they grew almost sombre. Silent, her aloof gaze remained fixed on the horizon; her lips rested on each other in sensitive curves. There was no sound save the curling of foam under the bows.  Marche looked elsewhere; then looked at her again. She sat motionless, gray eyes remote, one little, wind-roughened hand on the tiller. The steady breeze filled the sail; the dory stood straight away toward the blinding glory of the sunrise.  Through the unreal golden light, raft after raft of wild ducks rose and whirled into the east; blue herons flopped across the water; a silver-headed eagle, low over the waves, winged his way heavily toward some goal, doggedly intent upon his own business.  Outside Starfish Shoal the girl eased the sheet as the wind freshened. Far away on Golden Bar thousands of wild geese, which had been tipping their sterns skyward in plunging quest of nourishment, resumed a more stately and normal posture, as though at a spoken command; and the long ranks, swimming, and led by age and wisdom, slowly moved away into the glittering east.  At last, off the starboard bow, the low, reedy levels of Foam Island came into view, and in a few minutes more the dory lay in the shallows, oars, mast, and rag stowed; and the two young people splashed busily about in their hip boots, carrying guns, ammunition, and food into the blind.  Then Molly Herold, standing on the mud bank, flung, one by one, a squadron of wooden, painted, canvasback decoys into the water, where they righted themselves, and presently rode the waves, bobbing and steering with startling fidelity to the real things.  Then it came the turn of the real things. Marche and Molly, "]]]
