I've a hunch you killed that sphere.\"  \"I've thought of that, but how could I? I didn't touch him.\"  \"Maybe you don't have to touch 'em to kill 'em. We don't know what they are, except they're different--\"  \"We don't know the real natures of anything, as far as that goes. Man's a mixture of chemicals, but that doesn't explain him. The spheres are a mixture of energies--we can observe that much, but it still doesn't explain them. Where are they from? Why did they come here? What are their primary objectives?\"  \"Primary objectives? That's a military term, ain't it?\"  \"Partly military, and partly scientific. We know the secondary objective of the spheres. It's the same as man's or any other living creature. The spheres are alive and their objective is to keep on living, but that isn't their primary motif. The primary objective is the difference between a good man and a bad one. Whatever is more important to a man than life itself is his primary objective.\"  \"Life's pretty important,\" Masters said, solemnly.  \"Yes, but life isn't everything. Any man, no matter how yellow or mean he is, has some ideal he's willing to die for--or at least he's willing to risk dying to attain. Look at Norden. He's hard, cold-blooded and he doesn't think twice about putting a bomb in a plant to wipe out scores of lives. He dared me to kill him, rather than help us. His code as a spy is his primary objective. Look at Pember. He must have been frightened by the spheres, but we had to force him to leave his post. We've shown him that his duty now is with us--he realizes that the spheres are the immediate enemy of his country and he'll do his best fighting them. And you and I have ideals--we know each other too well to list them.\"  \"I getcha so far, but what about Orkins?\"  \"The man's not afraid of death, but afraid of the unknown. Men like him commit suicide rather than face reality. He wants security. He's afraid of uncertainty. He lives in an unreal, imaginary world and when uncertainty, which is reality, intrudes, he is completely lost.\"  \"You make me feel sorry for the poor devil.\"  \"That's because you understand why he's funky. Primary objectives make men do what they do--but understanding Orkins doesn't solve our problem.\"  \"No. What are the spheres? Are they alive? If so, they must want something. What do they want?\"  \"A conquest of the human race?\" Taylor pondered. \"Maybe. But it isn't likely. They can't gain much by conquering us. It wouldn't do man any good to stage a conquest of earthworms and swordfish, since neither could pay taxes. The spheres are as different from man as man from an angle-worm. Are we a menace to the spheres? Apparently the only time we really menace them is when we crawl into a hole like a rabbit--maybe there's something in that that will help us, but I don't think that's why they kill us. Are we a nuisance? If so, why? Are we a food? There is energy in sunlight and chemicals in the human body. A creature of energy would feed on something like sunlight, not chemicals. His menu would be electric wires, storage batteries--\"  \"Great Scott, Captain!\" Masters interrupted. \"Let's get away from this car. There's a battery in it--food for the spheres!\"  Masters looked nervously up at the circling globes. Taylor, deep in thought, did not stir. Instead, he continued his speculation:  \"Maybe they kill us for sport.\"  He was thinking of small boys torturing frogs; of Roman emperors at the circus; of sportsmen exterminating game; of the mob watching the guillotine on the streets of Paris. It was Zarathustra who said that when gazing at tragedies, bull fights and crucifixions, man has felt his happiest; and when man invented hell, he made hell his heaven on earth. Couldn't this be a characteristic of all life? Couldn't the spheres be cruel and ruthless, too?  Man, the mighty hunter, had become the prey.  A sphere detached itself from the group and circled toward the car.  \"I guess you're right, Masters,\" Taylor decided as he watched the spheres. \"We'd better move.\"     CHAPTER IV  PREY   Masters unlocked the handcuffs of the two men in the car. He disposed of his short-wave set in a ditch, for it, too, had batteries which might attract the spheres.  \"Get out of the car, Orkins,\" he ordered.  \"Watch him, Masters,\" Taylor warned. \"If he starts yelling, choke him.\"  \"But not too hard,\" Masters added. \"If we're going to be rabbits, human values will change. Men who run into holes will live to eat turnips, those who bare their teeth won't. Orkins might be the forefather of a new race--a helluva race. Come on, Orkins. Get out. Hurry up, Father Abraham, or I'll drag you out.\"  Orkins, cringing, emerged.  Taylor took charge of Norden, who followed Orkins out of the machine.  \"I hate your guts, Norden,\" he said. \"You're a dirty, lousy rat and you ought to be shot. But after all, you're a man. You've courage and I admire it, as much as I hate the way you use it. Overseas there's a war between countries. Here there's another war between humanity and a species of alien monsters. Whether we like it or not, we're allies.\"  Norden's undershot jaw moved in a grin.  \"I know about the spheres, Captain,\" Norden replied. \"I overheard your remarks to Mr. Masters. I've listened to Orkins' babble.\"  \"Will you help us?\"  \"I will bargain with you.\"  \"For your life? You know I can't do anything about that. I'll do my best--I'll speak a good word at your trial, try to save you from the firing squad, but I'm only a captain. That's all I can do. I haven't the power to do anything more.\"  \"Then I will not help.\"  \"Do you know what we're up against?\"  \"It looks pretty bad, doesn't it, Captain? But consider my hopeless case.\"  \"We have a chance, Norden. I know, more than any other living man perhaps, what those spheres are. I've seen them close at hand. Any hope of defeating them rests in us, using the meager knowledge I've gained from contact. What happens to your fatherland after the spheres finish on this side of the ocean depends on whether we conquer them, or they exterminate us.\"  Norden stopped smiling.  \"When you put it that way, Captain, how could I refuse?\" he asked. \"I'll cooperate, not to help you, but to help the fatherland.\"  The moonlight showed a gleam in Norden's deep-set eyes that Taylor did not like.         *       *       *       *       *  They moved to a wooded spot in a nearby field. There was a feeling of semi-security as they settled down to rest under the trees. Orkins' moans of fear were silenced by sleep. Norden sat motionless and Taylor could not tell whether he was asleep or awake. Pember removed his pack and used it for a pillow. Masters snored peacefully on the grass.  Only Taylor remained awake. A sphere floated overhead. Taylor, watching, saw the leaves of the tree stir restlessly as the invisible feelers probed toward the earth.  It was a reddish-orange orb, like the setting sun. Taylor once more got the impression of deeply embedded eyes glowering beneath the shining surface.  Were the eyes an illusion? Did the creatures really have eyes, like those of higher forms of animal life? Illusion or not, the eyes seemed to be there, intense, glaring and savage. They seemed to peer into the depths of Taylor's soul.  Taylor sat motionless, almost positive he was under observation. He expected to feel the jerk of the electric shock of the feeler. Instead, the sphere drifted on. The eyes had not seen.  A moment later flame streaked down from the sphere toward the parking lot. There was a roar as a gasoline tank exploded and flame shot skyward.  \"There goes the battery!\" Taylor muttered.  The others were roused by the explosion. Orkins sobbed hysterically. Masters, Pember and Norden watched the roaring flame.  \"We'll never escape them!\" Orkins moaned. \"They'll find us sooner or later. They can sense us.\"  \"They're not infallible,\" Taylor said. \"Remember I got away from them in the tunnel.\" He turned knowingly toward the others. \"Perhaps, if we dug a cave--\"  \"Sure!\" said Masters. \"It's a good idea.\"  \"Yes, sir!\" Pember said with a nod. He pulled his trench tool from his pack and handed it to Orkins. \"Maybe you'd like to dig, Mr. Orkins. It'll keep your mind off them things.\"  Orkins seized the small shovel almost instantly. Taylor half-smiled. He had made the suggestion for Orkins' benefit. The cave probably would never be finished. One deep enough to offer a refuge for five men could hardly be dug in a practical length of time.  Dawn was not far off and the spheres were drifting over the town. Already streets were filled with panic-stricken people. The appearance of the strange balls of fire brought residents from their homes in the middle of the night. Some fled in terror, believing a new type of raider had been invented by the enemy. Others stood watching.  The spheres circled. Taylor watched them, realizing he could do nothing to stop what would happen. There was no way to warn these helpless people that the spheres dealt death in a most sudden and violent form.  Something nagged at Taylor's mind. Why had the sphere gone out when he crept into the tunnel? What had caused it to die? Had the sphere been grounded, trying to reach him under the surface of the earth? Not likely, otherwise the creatures would not be able to attack a man standing on the ground. The bolt, besides, was not electricity, like lightning, but heat, which is not grounded easily.  Where had the spheres come from? They surely were not of this world. On the basis of biological evolution they could not be the children of any life known to science. Had they evolved suddenly, by accident? Some scientists thought all life had grown by accident; the right combination of circumstances had occurred and a chemical action had followed. Had the right combination for the spheres come about as the result of the war "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22234"],["title","Aunt Jo's Scrap Bag, Volume 5 (#1)"],["body","about the other point.  \"Do you think _I_ would have any chance?\" he asked, still holding Will, who seemed inclined for another dance.  \"I know you would. Don't you do splendidly at school? And didn't they want you for a choir boy, only your mother couldn't spare you?\" answered Will, decidedly; for Jimmy did love music, and had a sweet little pipe of his own, as she well knew.  \"Mother will have to spare me now, if they pay like that. I can work all day and do without sleep to earn money this way. Oh, Will, I'm so glad you came, for I was just ready to run away to sea. There didn't seem anything else to do,\" whispered Jimmy in a choky sort of tone, as hopes and fears struggled together in his boyish mind.  \"Run as fast as you like, and I'll go too. We'll sail in the 'Pinafore,' and come home with our pockets full of money.  \"'Sing, hey, the merry maiden and the tar!'\"  burst out Will, who was so full of spirits she could not keep still another minute.  Jimmy joined in, and the fresh voices echoed through the street so pleasantly that Mrs. Peters stopped scolding her six squabbling children, while Kitty's moaning changed to a feeble little sound of satisfaction, for \"brother's\" lullabies were her chief comfort and delight.  \"We shall lose school, you know, for we act in the afternoon, not the evening. I don't care; but you will, you like to study so well. Miss Pym didn't like it at first, but Ma said it would help the poor folks, and a little fun wouldn't hurt the children. I thought of you right away, and if you don't get as much money as I do, you shall have some of mine, so Kitty can go away soon.\"  Will's merry face grew very sweet and kind as she said that, and Jimmy was glad his mother called him just then, because he did not know how to thank this friend in need. When he came out with the parcel of vests he looked like a different boy, for Mrs. Nelson had told him to go and find out all about it, and had seemed as much dazzled by the prospect as he did, sewing was such weary work.  Their interview with Miss Pym was a most encouraging one, and it was soon settled that Jimmy should go with Will to try for a place on the morrow.  \"And I'll get it, too!\" he said to himself, as he kissed Kitty's thin cheek, full of the sweet hope that he might be the means of bringing back life and color to the little face he loved so well.  He was so excited he could not sleep, and beguiled the long hours by humming under his breath all the airs he knew belonging to the already popular opera. Next morning he flew about his work as if for a wager, and when Will came for him there was not a happier heart in all the city than the hopeful one that thumped under Jimmy's threadbare best jacket.  Such a crowd of girls and boys as they found at the hall where they were told to apply for inspection; such a chirping and piping went on there, it sounded like a big cage full of larks and linnets; and by and by, when the trial was over, such a smiling troop of children as was left to be drilled by the energetic gentlemen who had the matter in hand. Among this happy band stood our Jimmy, chosen for his good voice, and Will, because of her bright face and lively, self-possessed manners. They could hardly wait to be dismissed, and it was a race home to see who should be first to tell the good news. Jimmy tried to be quiet on Kitty's account, but failed entirely; and it was a pleasant sight to see the boy run into his mother's arms, crying joyfully,--  \"I'm in! I'm in! Ten dollars a week! Hurrah!\"  \"I can hardly believe it!\" And weary Mrs. Nelson dropped her needle to indulge in a few moments of delightful repose.  \"If it goes well they may want us for a month or six weeks,\" the man said. \"Just think, maybe I'll get fifty or sixty dollars! and Baby will get well right off,\" cried Jimmy, in an arithmetical sort of rapture, as he leaned above Kitty, who tried to clap her little hands without quite knowing what the joy was all about.   HOW HE SAILED.  After that day Jimmy led a very happy life, for he loved music and enjoyed the daily drill with his mates, though it was long before he saw the inside of the theatre. Will knew a good deal about it, for an actor's family had boarded with her mother, and the little girl had been behind the scenes. But to Jimmy, who had only seen one fairy play, all was very strange when at last he went upon the stage; for the glittering world he expected was gone, and all was dusty, dark, and queer, with trap-doors underfoot, machinery overhead, and a wilderness of scenery jumbled together in the drollest way. He was all eyes and ears, and enjoyed himself immensely as he came and went, sung and acted, with the troop of lads who made up the sailor chorus. It was a real ship to him, in spite of painted cannon, shaky masts, and cabin doors that led nowhere. He longed to run up the rigging; but as that was forbidden, for fear of danger, he contented himself by obeying orders with nautical obedience, singing with all his might, and taking great satisfaction in his blue suit with the magical letters \"H. M. S. Pinafore\" round his cap.  Day by day all grew more and more interesting. His mother was never tired of hearing his adventures, he sung Kitty to sleep with the new songs, and the neighbors took such a friendly interest in his success that they called him Lord Nelson, and predicted that he would be as famous as his great namesake.  When the grand day came at last, and the crew of jolly young tars stood ready to burst forth with the opening chorus,  \"We sail the ocean blue,   Our saucy ship's a beauty; We're gallant men and true,   And bound to do our duty!\"  Jimmy hardly knew whether he stood on his head or his heels at first, for, in spite of many rehearsals, everything seemed changed. Instead of daylight, gas shone everywhere, the empty seats were full, the orchestra playing splendidly, and when the curtain rose, a sea of friendly faces welcomed them, and the pleasant sound of applause made the hearts under the blue jackets dance gayly.  How those boys did sing! how their eyes shone, and their feet kept time to the familiar strains! with what a relish they hitched up their trousers and lurched about, or saluted and cheered as the play demanded. With what interest they watched the microscopic midshipmite, listened to Rafe as his sweet voice melodiously told the story of his hapless love, and smiled on pretty Josephine, who was a regular bluebird without the scream.  \"Ain't this fun?\" whispered Jimmy's next neighbor, taking advantage of a general burst of laughter, as the inimitable little bumboat woman advertised her wares with captivating drollery.  \"Right down jolly!\" answered Jimmy, feeling that a series of somersaults across the stage would be an immense relief to the pent-up emotions of his boyish soul. For under all the natural excitement of the hour deep down lay the sweet certainty that he was earning health for Kitty, and it made his heart sing for joy more blithely than any jovial chorus to which he lent his happy voice.  But his bliss was not complete till the stately Sir Joseph, K. C. B., had come aboard, followed by \"his sisters and his cousins and his aunts;\" for among that flock of devoted relatives in white muslin and gay ribbons was Will. Standing in the front row, her bright face was good to see, for her black eyes sparkled, every hair on her head curled its best, her cherry bows streamed in the breeze, and her feet pranced irresistibly at the lively parts of the music. She longed to dance the hornpipe which the little Quaker aunt did so capitally, but, being denied that honor, distinguished herself by the comic vigor with which she \"polished up the handle of the big front door,\" and did the other \"business\" recorded by the gallant \"ruler of the Queen's Navee.\"  She and Jimmy nodded to each other behind the Admiral's august back, and while Captain Corcoran was singing to the moon, and Buttercup suffering the pangs of \"Wemorse,\" the young people had a gay time behind the scenes. Jimmy and Will sat upon a green baize bank to compare notes, while the relatives flew about like butterflies, and the sailors talked base-ball, jack-knives, and other congenial topics, when not envying Sir Joseph his cocked hat, and the Captain his epaulettes.  It was a very successful launch, and the merry little crew set sail with a fair wind and every prospect of a prosperous voyage. When the first performance was over, our two children left their fine feathers behind them, like Cinderella when the magic hour struck, and went gayly home, feeling much elated, for they knew they should go back to fresh triumphs, and were earning money by their voices like Jenny Lind and Mario. How they pitied other boys and girls who could not go in at that mysterious little door; how important they felt as parts of the spectacle about which every one was talking, and what millionnaires they considered themselves as they discussed their earnings and planned what to do with the prospective fortunes.  That was the beginning of many busy, happy weeks for both the children,--weeks which they long remembered with great pleasure, as did older and wiser people; for that merry, innocent little opera proved that theatres can be made the scenes of harmless amusement, and opened to a certain class of young people a new and profitable field for their talents. So popular did this small company become that the piece went on through the summer vacation, and was played in the morning as well as afternoon to satisfy the crowds who wished to see and hear it.  Never had the dear old Boston Museum, which so many of us have loved and haunted for years, seen such a pretty sight as one of those morning performances. It was the perfection of harmless merry-making, and the audience was as pleasant a spectacle as that upon the stage. Fathers and mothers stole an hour from their busy lives to come and be children with their children, irresistibly attracted and "]]]
