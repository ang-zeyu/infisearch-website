Where did you pick him up?\" asked Mabberly.  \"In the woods and forests of course,\" said Jackman, \"where I have picked up everything of late--from salary to jungle fevers.  He's an old soldier--also on sick-leave, though he does not look like it.  He came originally from the west of Ireland, I believe; but there's little of the Irishman left, save the brogue and the honesty.  He's a first-rate servant, if you know how to humour him, and, being a splendid cook, we shall find him useful.\"  \"I hope so,\" said Mabberly, with a dubious look.  \"Why, Bob, do you suppose I would have offered him as cook and steward if I had not felt sure of him?\"  \"Of course not; and I would not have accepted him if I had not felt sure of you, Giles, my boy; so come along and let's have something to eat.\"  \"But you have not yet told me, Bob,\" said Jackman, while the three friends were discussing their meal, \"what part of the world you intend to visit.  Does your father give you leave to go wherever you please, and stay as long as you choose?\"  \"No; he limits me to the Western Isles.\"  \"That's an indefinite limitation.  D'you mean the isles of the Western Pacific?\"  \"No; only those of the west of Scotland.  And, to tell you the truth, I have no settled or definite plan.  Having got leave to use the yacht all the summer on condition that I don't leave our own shores, I have resolved to begin by running at once to the wildest and farthest away part of the kingdom, leaving circumstances to settle the rest.\"  \"A circumstantial account of the matter, no doubt, yet rather vague. Have you a good crew?\"  \"Yes; two men and a boy, one of the men being skipper, and the nearest approach to a human machine you ever saw.  He is a Highlander, a thorough seaman, hard as mahogany and about as dark, stiff as a poker, self-contained, silent, except when spoken to, and absolutely obedient.\"  \"And we set sail to-morrow, early?\" asked Barret.  \"Yes; after seeing the morning papers,\" said Mabberly with a laugh.  This, of course, turned the conversation on the accident, much to the distress of Barret, who feared that the jovial, off-hand reckless man from the \"woods and forests\" would laugh at and quiz him more severely than his friend Bob.  To his surprise and great satisfaction, however, he found that his fears were groundless, for Jackman listened to the account of the incident quite gravely, betrayed not the slightest tendency to laugh, or even smile; asked a good many questions in an interested tone, spoke encouragingly as to the probable result, and altogether showed himself to be a man of strong sympathy as well as high spirits.  Next morning found our three adventurers dropping down the Thames with the first of the ebb tide, and a slight breeze from the south-west; Mabberly and Jackman in the very small cabin looking after stores, guns, rods, etcetera; Barret anxiously scanning the columns of a newspaper; Quin and the skipper making each other's acquaintance with much of the suspicion observable in two bull-dogs who meet accidentally; the boy in the fore part of the vessel coiling ropes; and the remainder of the crew at the helm.  \"Port! port! stiddy,\" growled the skipper.  \"Port it is; steady,\" replied the steersman in a sing-song professional tone, as a huge steamer from the antipodes went slowly past, like a mighty leviathan of the deep.  \"Is it to the north, south, east, or west we're bound for, captain?\" asked Quin, with a voice like that of a conciliatory bassoon.  \"I don't know where we're bound for,\" growled the skipper slowly. \"Starboard a bit; stiddy!\"  \"Steady!\" sang out the man at the tiller.  A few hours carried them into the German Ocean.  Here Quin thought he would try again for a little information.  \"Sure it's nor'-east we're steerin', captain,\" he remarked in a casual way.  \"No, it's not,\" growled the skipper, very much through his nose; \"she's headin' west.\"  \"It's to _somewhere_ that coorse will take us in the ind, no doubt, if we carry on?\" suggested Quin, interrogatively.  \"Ay; oot to sea,\" replied the skipper.  Quin was obliged to give it up for the time being.  For some time they were nearly becalmed; then, as the land dropped astern and the shades of night deepened, the wind fell altogether, and, when the stars came out, a profound calm prevailed over the gently undulating sea.  The exuberant spirits of our three friends were subdued by the sweet influences around, and, as the hour for rest drew near, the conversation, which at first became fitful, dropped at last to silence.  This was broken at length by Jackman saying, to the surprise of his companions, \"What d'you say to reading a chapter before turning in?  I'm fond of striking what's called a key-note.  If we begin this pleasure-trip with an acknowledgment of our dependence on God, we shall probably have a really pleasant time of it.  What say you?\"  Both Mabberly and Barret gladly agreed to their friend's proposal--for both had been trained in God-fearing families--though neither would have had the courage to make the proposal himself.  The crew were invited to join, and thus family worship was established on board the _Fairy_ from the first day.  Only one point is worthy of note in connection with this--although no one noted it particularly at the time, namely, that the portion of Scripture undesignedly selected contained that oft-quoted verse, \"Ye know not what a day may bring forth.\"  The truth of this was very soon thrust home upon them by stern experience.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE VOYAGE AUSPICIOUSLY BEGUN AND PROMPTLY ENDED.  A voyage up the east coast of Great Britain and through the Pentland Firth does not usually take a long time.  When the vessel is a swift little schooner-yacht, and the breeze is stiff as well as fair, the voyage is naturally a brief one.  Everything favoured the little _Fairy_.  Sun, moon, and stars cheered her, and winds were propitious, so that our voyagers soon found themselves skimming over the billows of the western sea.  It was one part of Mabberly's plan that he and his friends should do duty as part of the crew.  He was himself accustomed to the handling of yachts, and Barret he knew had been familiar with the management of boats from childhood.  \"You can steer, of course?\" he had asked Giles Jackman almost as soon as they were fairly at sea.  \"Well, ye-es, oh yes.  No doubt I could steer if I were to try.\"  \"Have you never tried?\" asked his friend in surprise.  \"Oh yes, I have tried--once.  It was on an occasion when a number of us had gone on a picnic.  We had to proceed part of the way to our destination by river in a small boat, which was managed by a regular old sea-dog--I forget his name, for we generally hailed him by the title of Old Salt.  Some of the impatient members of the party suggested a little preliminary lunch.  There are always people ready to back up impatient suggestions!  It was agreed to, and Old Salt was ordered to open the provision basket, which had been stowed away in the bows of the boat. `Would you steer, sir?' said Old Salt to me, as he rose to go forward. `Certainly, with pleasure,' said I, for, as you know, it's an old weakness of mine to be obliging!  Well, in a few minutes they were all eating away as if they'd had no breakfast, while we went merrily down the river, with the current and a light breeze in our favour.  \"Suddenly Old Salt shouted something that was smothered in its passage through a bite of sandwich.  I looked up, and saw a native canoe coming straight towards us.  `Port!' roared Old Salt, in an explosion that cleared away half the sandwich.  `No, thankee; I prefer sherry,' said I. But I stopped there, for I saw intuitively from the yell with which he interrupted me that something was wrong.  `_Hard_ a-port!' he cried, jumping up and scattering his rations.  I shoved the tiller hard to the side that suggested itself, and hoped for the best.  The worst followed, for we struck the native canoe amidships, as it was steering wildly out of our way, and capsized it!  There were only two men in it, and they could swim like ducks; but the river was full of alligators, and two sharp-set ones were on the scent instantly.  It is my opinion that those two natives would, then and there, have been devoured, if we had not run in between and made such a splashing and hullaballoo with boat-hook, oars, and voices, that the monsters were scared away.  I have never steered since that day.\"  \"I don't wonder; and, with my consent, you shall not steer now,\" said Mabberly, laughing.  \"Why, Giles, I was under the impression that you understood everything, and could do almost anything!\"  \"Quite a mistake, Bob, founded in error or superstition.  You have confused the will with the deed.  I am indeed willing to try anything, but my capacity for action is limited, like my knowledge.  In regard to the higher mathematics, for instance, I know nothing.  Copper-mining I do not understand.  I may say the same with reference to Tartar mythology, and as regards the management of infants under two years I am densely ignorant.\"  \"But do you really know nothing at all about boats and ships, Giles?\" asked Barret, who, being a good listener, did not always shine as a speaker.  \"How can you ask such a question?  Of course I know a great deal"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23377"],["title","The Lively Poll: A Tale of the North Sea (#1)"],["body"," character,--Lockley, the skipper being genial; Peter Jay, the mate, very appreciative of humour, though quiet and sedate; Duffy, jovial and funny; Freeman, kindly, though reckless; and Bob, the boy-cook, easy-going both as to mind and morals.  They all liked Martin, however, in spite of his religion, for he practised much and preached little.  \"What's wrong?\" asked Lockley, who stood at the tiller looking out for lights ahead.  \"Only a bone into my left hand,\" replied Martin, going on with his somewhat dirty labours.  \"Well that it's no worse, boy,\" observed Freeman, \"for we've got no medicine-chest to fly to like that lucky Short-Blue fleet.\"  \"That's true, Jim,\" responded Martin; \"I wish we had a Gospel smack with our fleet, for our souls need repairing as well as our bodies.\"  \"There you go,\" growled Stubley, flinging down a just finished fish with a flap of indignation.  \"A feller can't mention the name o' them mission craft without rousin' you up to some o' your hypocritical chaff.  For my part, if it wasn't for the medicine-chest and the mittens, I think we'd be better by a long way without Gospel ships, as ye call 'em.  Why, what good 'ave they done the Short-Blues?  I'm sure _we_ doesn't want churches, or prayin', or psalm-singin' or book--\"  \"Speak for yourself, Jo,\" interrupted Puffy.  \"Although your head may be as thick as a three-inch plank, through which nothin' a'most can pass either from books or anything else, you mustn't think we've bin all built on the same lines.  I likes a good book myself, an', though I don't care about prayin' or psalm-singin', seein' I don't understand 'em, I say `good luck' to the mission smacks, if it was for nothin' else than the books, an' doctor stuff, an' mitts what the shoregoin' ladies--bless their hearts!--is so fond o' sendin' to us.\"  \"Ay, an the cheap baccy, too, that they say they're a-goin' to send to us,\" added Freeman.  \"P'r'aps they'll send us cheap grog at last,\" said Puffy, with a laugh.  \"They'll hardly do that,\" remarked Martin; \"for it's to try an' keep us from goin' for our baccy to the _copers_ that they've started this new plan.\"  \"I wish 'em success,\" said Lockley, in a serious tone.  And there was good ground for that wish, for our genial and handsome skipper was peculiarly weak on the point of strong drink, that being to him a powerful, almost irresistible, temptation.  When the fish-cleaning and packing were completed, the men went below to snatch a few hours' repose.  Wet, weary, and sleepy, but with a large stock of reserve strength in them, they retired to the little cabin, in which they could scarcely stand up without bumping their heads, and could hardly turn round without hitting their elbows on something or other.  Kicking off their long boots, and throwing aside oilskin coats and sou'-westers, they tumbled into their narrow \"bunks\" and fell asleep almost without winking.  There was one among them, however, who did not sleep long that night. Fred Martin was soon awakened by the pain of his wound, which had begun to inflame, and by a feeling of giddiness and intense uneasiness with which he had been troubled for several days past.  Turning out at last, he sat down in front of the little iron stove that served to cook food as well as to warm the cabin, and, gazing into the embers, began to meditate on his strangely uncomfortable sensations.  \"Hallo, Martin, anything wrong?\" asked the mate, who descended at that moment to relight his pipe.  \"I believe there is, mate.  I never felt like this afore.  I've fowt against it till I can hardly stand.  I feel as if I was goin' to knock under altogether.  This hand, too, seems gittin' bad.  I do think my blood must be poisoned, or somethin' o' that sort.  You know I don't easily give in, but when a feller feels as if little red-hot wires was twistin' about inside of him, an' sees things goin' round as if he was drunk, why--\"  \"Why, it's time to think of goin' home,\" interrupted Jay, with a laugh. \"But let's have a look at you, Fred.  Well, there does seem to be some o' your riggin' slack.  Have you ever had the measles?\"  \"Not as I knows of.\"  \"Looks like it,\" said the mate, lighting his pipe.  \"P'r'aps it'll be as well to send you into dock to refit.  You'd better turn in again, anyhow, for a snooze would do you good.\"  Fred Martin acted on this advice, while Jay returned to the deck; but it was evident that the snooze was not to be had, for he continued to turn and toss uneasily, and to wonder what was wrong with him, as strong healthy men are rather apt to do when suddenly seized with sickness.  At grey dawn the admiral signalled again.  The order was to haul up the nets, which had been scraping the bottom of the sea since midnight, and the whole fleet set to work without delay.  Martin turned out with the rest, and tried to defy sickness for a time, but it would not do.  The strong man was obliged to succumb to a stronger than he--not, however, until he had assisted as best as he could in hauling up the trawl.  This second haul of the gear of the _Lively Poll_ illustrated one of those mishaps, to which all deep-sea trawlers are liable, and which are of frequent occurrence.  A piece of wreck or a lost anchor, or something, had caught the net, and torn it badly, so that when it reached the surface all the fish had escaped.  \"A night's work for nothing!\" exclaimed Stephen Lockley, with an oath.  \"_Might_ have been worse,\" suggested Martin.  By that time it was broad daylight, and as they had no fish to pack, the crew busied themselves in removing the torn net from the beam, and fitting on a new one.  At the same time the crews of the other smacks secured their various and varied hauls, cleaned, packed, and got ready for delivery.  The smoke of the steam-carrier was seen on the horizon early in the forenoon, and all the vessels of the fleet made for her, as chickens make for their mother in times of danger.  We may not pause here to describe the picturesque confusion that ensued--the arriving, congregating, tacking, crossing, and re-crossing of smacks; the launching of little boats, and loading them with \"trunks;\" the concentration of these round the steamer like minnows round a whale; the shipping of the cargo, and the tremendous hurry and energy displayed in the desire to do it quickly, and get the fish fresh to market.  Suffice it to say that in less than four hours the steamer was loaded, and Fred Martin, fever-stricken and with a highly inflamed hand and arm, started on a thirty-six hours' voyage to London.  Then the fleet sheered off and fell into order, the admiral issued his instructions, and away they all went again to continue the hard, unvarying round of hauling and toiling and moiling, in heat and cold, wet and dry, with nothing to lighten the life or cheer the heart save a game at \"crib\" or \"all fives,\" or a visit to the _coper_, that terrible curse of the North Sea.    CHAPTER TWO.  ACCIDENTS AFLOAT AND INCIDENTS ASHORE.  Now, although it is an undoubted fact that the skippers of the North Sea trawling smacks are first-rate seamen, it is an equally certain fact that strong drink can render them unfit for duty.  One of the skippers was, if we may say so, unmanned by drink at the time the fleet sheered off from the steam-carrier, as stated in the last chapter.  He was named Georgie Fox--better known in the fleet as Groggy Fox.  Unfortunately for himself as well as others, Skipper Fox had paid a visit to one of the _copers_ the day before for the purpose of laying in a stock of tobacco, which was sold by the skipper of the floating grog-shop at 1 shilling 6 pence a pound.  Of course Fox had been treated to a glass of fiery spirits, and had thereafter been induced to purchase a quantity of the same.  He had continued to tipple until night, when he retired in a fuddled state to rest.  On rising he tippled again, and went on tippling till his fish were put on board the steamer.  Then he took the helm of his vessel, and stood with legs very wide apart, an owlish gaze in his eyes, and a look of amazing solemnity on his visage.  When a fleet sheers off from a steam-carrier after delivery of cargo, the sea around is usually very much crowded with vessels, and as these cross and re-cross or run past or alongside of each other before finally settling into the appointed course, there is a good deal of hearty recognition--shouting, questioning, tossing up of arms, and expressions of goodwill--among friends.  Several men hailed and saluted Fox as his smack, the _Cormorant_, went by, but he took no notice except with an idiotic wink of both eyes.  \"He's bin to the _coper_,\" remarked Puffy, as the _Cormorant_ crossed the bow of the _Lively Poll_.  \"I say, Lumpy, come here,\" he added, as Bob Lumsden came on deck.  \"Have 'ee got any o' that coffee left?\"  \"No, not a drop.  I gave the last o't to Fred Martin just as he was goin' away.\"  \"Poor Fred!\" said Puffy.  \"He's in for suthin' stiff, I doubt, measles or mulligrumps, if not wuss.\"  \"A great pity,\" remarked Peter Jay, who stood at the helm, \"that Martin couldn't hold out a week longer when our turn comes round to run for Yarmouth.\"  \"It's well we got him shipped off to-day,\" said Lockley.  \"That hand of his would have made him useless before another day was out.  It's a long time for a man in his state to be without help, that run up to Lun'on. Port your helm a bit, Jay.  Is it the _Cormorant_ that's yawin' about there in that fashion?\"  \"Ay, it's the _Cormorant_,\" replied Jay.  \"I seed her just now a'most run foul o' the _Butterfly_.\"  \"She'll be foul of us.  Hi!  Look out!\" cried Lockley, becoming excited, as he saw the _Cormorant_ change her course suddenly, without apparent reason, and bear straight down upon his vessel.  There was, indeed, no reason for the strange movements of the smack in question, except that there was at the helm a man who had rendered his reason incapable of action.
