Presently they saw lights twinkling through the trees, and came to a place which was clearly the focus of festivity. There was the open-air theatre, its drop-scene lowered, its proscenium lost in the gloom; there was the circle for _al-fresco_ dancing, but it was bare, and the clustered lights were dead; there was the restaurant, dark and silent like all else.  Jauncy stood there and rubbed his chin. \"This is where I dined when we were here last,\" he said, at length; \"and a capital little dinner they gave us too!\"  \"What _I_ should like to know,\" said the elder Miss Parkinson, \"is, where are we to dine to-night?\"  \"Yes,\" said Jauncy, encouragingly; \"don't you fret yourself, Bella. Here's an old party sweeping up leaves, we'll ask him.\"  They did so, and were referred to a large building, in the Gothic style, with a Tudor doorway, known as the \"Baronial All,\" where lights shone behind the painted windows.  Inside, a few of the lamps around the pillars were lighted, and the body of the floor was roped in as if for dancing; but the hall was empty, save for a barmaid, assisted by a sharp little girl, behind the long bar on one of its sides.  Jauncy led his dejected little party up to this, and again put his inquiry with less hopefulness. When he found that the only available form of refreshment that evening was bitter ale and captain's biscuits, mitigated by occasional caraway seeds, he became a truly pitiable object.  \"They--they don't keep this place up on the same scale in the autumn, you see,\" he explained weakly. \"It's very different in summer; what they call 'an endless round of amusements.'\"  \"There's an endless round of amusement now,\" observed Ada; \"but it's a naught!\"  \"Oh, there'll be something going on by-and-by, never fear,\" said Jauncy, determined to be sanguine; \"or else they wouldn't be open.\"  \"There'll be dancing here this evening,\" the barmaid informed him. \"That is all we open for at this time of year; and this is the last night of the season.\"  \"Oh!\" said Jauncy, cheerfully; \"you see we only came just in time, Bella; and I suppose you'll have a good many down here to-night--eh, miss?\"  \"How much did we take last Saturday, Jenny?\" said the barmaid to the sharp little girl.  \"Seven and fourpence 'ap'ny--most of it beer,\" said the child. \"Margaret, I may count the money again to-night, mayn't I?\"  The barmaid made some mental calculation, after which she replied to Jauncy's question. \"We may have some fifteen couples or so down to-night,\" she said; \"but that won't be for half an hour yet.\"  \"The question is,\" said Jauncy, trying to bear up under this last blow; \"the question is, How are we to amuse ourselves till the dancing begins?\"  \"I don't know what others are going to do,\" Bella announced; \"but I shall stay here, James, and keep warm--if I can!\" and once more she uttered her regret that they had not gone to the Adelphi.  Her sister declined to follow her example. \"I mean to see all there is to be seen,\" she declared, \"since we are here; and perhaps Mr. Tweddle will come and take care of me. Will you, Mr. Tweddle?\"  He was not sorry to comply, and they wandered out together through the grounds, which offered considerable variety. There were alleys lined with pale plaster statues, and a grove dedicated to the master minds of the world, represented by huge busts, with more or less appropriate quotations. There were alcoves, too, and neatly ruined castles.  Ada talked almost the whole time in a sprightly manner, which gave Leander no opportunity of introducing the subject of his engagement, and this continued until they had reached a small battlemented platform on some rising ground; below were the black masses of trees, with a faint fringe of light here and there; beyond lay the Thames, in which red and white reflections quivered, and from whose distant bends and reaches came the dull roar of fog-horns and the pantings of tugs.  Ada stood here in silence for some time; at last she said, \"After all, I'm not sorry we came--are _you_?\"  \"If I don't take care what I say, I _may_ be!\" he thought, and answered guardedly, \"On the contrary, I'm glad, for it gives me the opportunity of telling you something I--I think you ought to know.\"  \"What was he going to say next?\" she thought. Was a declaration coming, and if so, should she accept him? She was not sure; he had behaved very badly in keeping so long away from her, and a proposal would be a very suitable form of apology; but there was the gentleman who travelled for a certain firm in the Edgware Road, he had been very \"particular\" in his attentions of late. Well, she would see how she felt when Leander had spoken; he was beginning to speak now.  \"I don't want to put it too abrupt,\" he said; \"I'll come to it gradually. There's a young lady that I'm now looking forward to spending the whole of my future life with.\"  \"And what is she called?\" asked Ada. (\"He's rather a nice little man, after all!\" she was thinking.)  \"Matilda,\" he said; and the answer came like a blow in the face. For the moment she hated him as bitterly as if he had been all the world to her; but she carried off her mortification by a rather hysterical laugh.  \"Fancy you being engaged!\" she said, by way of explanation of her merriment; \"and to any one with the name of Matilda--it's such a stupid sounding sort of name!\"  \"It ain't at all; it all depends how you say it. If you pronounce it like I do, _Matilda_, it has rather a pretty sound. You try now.\"  \"Well, we won't quarrel about it, Mr. Tweddle; I'm glad it isn't my name, that's all. And now tell me all about your young lady. What's her other name, and is she very good-looking?\"  \"She's a Miss Matilda Collum,\" said he; \"she is considered handsome by competent judges, and she keeps the books at a florist's in the vicinity of Bayswater.\"  \"And, if it isn't a rude question, why didn't you bring her with you this evening?\"  \"Because she's away for a short holiday, and isn't coming back till the last thing to-morrow night.\"  \"And I suppose you've been wishing I was Matilda all the time?\" she said audaciously; for Miss Ada Parkinson was not an over-scrupulous young person, and did not recognize in the fact of her friend's engagement any reason why she should not attempt to reclaim his vagrant admiration.  Leander _had_ been guilty of this wish once or twice; but though he was not absolutely overflowing with tact, he did refrain from admitting the impeachment.  \"Well, you see,\" he said, in not very happy evasion, \"Matilda doesn't care about this kind of thing; she's rather particular, Matilda is.\"  \"And I'm not!\" said Ada. \"I see; thank you, Mr. Tweddle!\"  \"You do take one up so!\" he complained. \"I never intended nothing of the sort--far from it.\"  \"Well, then, I forgive you; we can't all be Matildas, I suppose. And now, suppose we go back; they will be beginning to dance by now!\"  \"With pleasure,\" he said; \"only you must excuse me dancing, because, as an engaged man, I have had to renounce (except with one person) the charms of Terpsy-chore. I mean,\" he explained condescendingly, \"that I can't dance in public save with my intended.\"  \"Ah, well,\" said Ada, \"perhaps Terpsy-chore will get over it; still I should like to see the Terpsy-choring, if you have no objection.\"  And they returned to the Baronial Hall, which by this time presented a more cheerful appearance. The lamps round the mirror-lined pillars were all lit, and the musicians were just striking up the opening bars of the Lancers; upon which several gentlemen amongst the assembly, which now numbered about forty, ran out into the open and took up positions, like colour-sergeants at drill, to be presently joined, in some bashfulness, by such ladies as desired partners.  The Lancers were performed with extreme conscientiousness; and when it was over, every gentleman with any _savoir faire_ to speak of presented his partner with a glass of beer.  Then came a waltz, to which Ada beat time impatiently with her foot, and bit her lip, as she had to look on by Leander's side.  \"There's Bella and James going round,\" she said; \"I've never had to sit out a waltz before!\"  He felt the implied reproach, and thought whether there could be any harm, after all, in taking a turn or two; it would be only polite. But, before he could recant in words, a soldier came up, a medium-sized warrior with a large nose and round little eyes, who had been very funny during the Lancers in directing all the figures by words of military command.  \"Will you allow me the honour, miss, of just one round?\" he said to Ada, respectfully enough.  The etiquette of this ballroom was not of the strictest; but she would not have consented but for the desire of showing Leander that she was not dependent upon him for her amusement. As it was, she accepted the corporal's arm a little defiantly.  Leander watched them round the hall with an odd sensation, almost of jealousy--it was quite ridiculous, because he could have danced with Ada himself had he cared to do so; and besides, it was not she, but Matilda, whom he adored.  But, as he began to notice, Ada was looking remarkably pretty that evening, and really was a partner who would bring any one credit; and her corporal danced villainously, revolving with stiff and wooden jerks, like a toy soldier. Now Leander flattered himself he could waltz--having had considerable practice in bygone days in a select assembly, where the tickets were two shillings each, and the gentlemen, as the notices said ambiguously enough, \"were restricted to wearing gloves.\"  So he felt indignantly that Ada was not having justice done to her. \"I've a good mind to give her a turn,\" he thought, \"and show them all what waltzing is!\"  Just then the pair happened to come to a halt close to him. \"Shockin' time they're playing this waltz in,\" he heard the soldier exclaim with humorous vivacity (he was apparently the funny man of the regiment, and had brought a silent "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24198"],["title","A Spaceship Named McGuire (#1)"],["body","I accept the job, I won't threaten to quit again unless I mean to carry it through, and it would take a lot more than common discourtesy to make me do that. On the other hand, your brand of discourtesy is a shade above the common.\"  \"I thank you for that, at least,\" said Ravenhurst. \"Show him to my office, Mr. Feller.\"  The blond young man nodded wordlessly and led me from the room.         *       *       *       *       *  Walking under low-gee conditions is like nothing else in this universe. I don't mean trotting around on Luna; one-sixth gee is practically homelike in comparison. And zero gee is so devoid of orientation that it gives the sensation of falling endlessly until you get used to it. But a planetoid is in a different class altogether.  Remember that dream--almost everybody's had it--where you're suddenly able to fly? It isn't flying exactly; it's a sort of swimming in the air. Like being underwater, except that the medium around you isn't so dense and viscous, and you can breathe. Remember? Well, that's the feeling you get on a low-gee planetoid.  Your arms don't tend to hang at your sides, as they do on Earth or Luna, because the muscular tension tends to hold them out, just as it does in zero-gee, but there is still a definite sensation of up-and-down. If you push yourself off the floor, you tend to float in a long, slow, graceful arc, provided you don't push too hard. Magnetic soles are practically a must.  I followed the blond Mr. Feller down a series of long corridors which had been painted a pale green, which gave me the feeling that I was underwater. There were doors spaced at intervals along the corridor walls. Occasionally one of them would open and a busy looking man would cross the corridor, open another door, and disappear. From behind the doors, I could hear the drum of distant sounds.  We finally ended up in front of what looked like the only wooden door in the place. When you're carving an office and residence out of a nickel-iron planetoid, importing wood from Earth is a purely luxury matter.  There was no name plate on that mahogany-red door; there didn't need to be.  Feller touched a thin-lined circle in the door jamb.  \"You don't knock?\" I asked with mock seriousness.  \"No,\" said Feller, with a straight face. \"I have to signal. Knocking wouldn't do any good. That's just wood veneer over a three-inch-thick steel slab.\"  The door opened and I stepped inside.  I have never seen a room quite like it. The furniture was all that same mahogany--a huge desk, nineteenth century baroque, with carved and curlicued legs; two chairs carved the same, with padded seats of maroon leather; and a chair behind the desk that might have doubled as a bishop's throne, with even fancier carving. Off to one side was a long couch upholstered in a lighter maroon. The wall-to-wall carpeting was a rich Burgundy, with a pile deep enough to run a reaper through. The walls were paneled with mahogany and hung with a couple of huge tapestries done in maroon, purple, and red. A bookcase along one wall was filled with books, every one of which had been rebound in maroon leather.  It was like walking into a cask of old claret. Or old blood.  The man sitting behind the desk looked as though he'd been built to be the lightest spot in an analogous color scheme. His suit was mauve with purple piping, and his wide, square, saggy face was florid. On his nose and cheeks, tiny lines of purple tracing made darker areas in his skin. His hair was a medium brown, but it was clipped so short that the scalp showed faintly through, and amid all that overwhelming background, even the hair looked vaguely violet.  \"Come in, Mr. Oak,\" said Shalimar Ravenhurst.  I walked toward him across the Burgundy carpet while the blond young man discreetly closed the door behind me, leaving us alone. I didn't blame him. I was wearing a yellow union suit, and I hate to think what I must have looked like in that room.  I sat down in one of the chairs facing the desk after giving a brief shake to a thick-fingered, well-manicured, slightly oily hand.  He opened a crystal decanter that stood on one end of the desk. \"Have some Madeira, Mr. Oak? Or would you like something else? I never drink spirits at this time of night.\"  I fought down an impulse to ask for a shot of redeye. \"The Madeira will be fine, Mr. Ravenhurst.\"  He poured and handed me a stemmed glass nearly brimming with the wine. I joined him in an appreciative sip, then waited while he made up his mind to talk.  He leaned across the desk, looking at me with his small, dark eyes. He had an expression on his face that looked as if it were trying to sneer and leer at the same time but couldn't get much beyond the smirk stage.  \"Mr. Oak, I have investigated you thoroughly--as thoroughly as it can be done, at least. My attorneys say that your reputation is A-one; that you get things done and rarely disappoint a client.\"  He paused as if waiting for a comment. I gave him nothing.  After a moment, he went on. \"I hope that's true, Mr. Oak, because I'm going to have to trust you.\" He leaned back in his chair again, his eyes still on me. \"Men very rarely like me, Mr. Oak. I am not a likable man. I do not pretend to be. That's not my function.\" He said it as if he had said it many times before, believed it, and wished it wasn't so.  \"I do not ask that you like me,\" he continued. \"I only ask that you be loyal to my interests for the duration of this assignment.\" Another pause. \"I have been assured by others that this will be so. I would like your assurance.\"  \"If I take the assignment, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I told him, \"I'll be working for _you_. I can be bought, but once I'm bought I stay bought.  \"Now, what seems to be your trouble?\"  He frowned. \"Well, now, let's get one thing settled: Are you working for me, or not?\"  \"I won't know that until I find out what the job is.\"  His frown deepened. \"Now, see here; this is very confidential work. What happens if I tell you and you decide not to work for me?\"  I sighed. \"Ravenhurst, right now, you're paying me to listen to you. Even if I don't take your job, I'm going to bill you for expenses and time to come all the way out here. So, as far as listening is concerned, I'm working for you now. If I don't like the job, I'll still forget everything I'm told. All right?\"  He didn't like it, but he had no choice. \"All right,\" he said. He polished off his glass of Madeira and refilled it. My own glass was still nearly full.  \"Mr. Oak,\" he began, \"I have two problems. One is minor, the other major. But I have attempted to blow the minor problem up out of proportion, so that all the people here at Raven's Rest think that it is the only problem. They think that I brought you out here for that reason alone.  \"But all that is merely cover-up for the real problem.\"  \"Which is?\" I prompted.  He leaned forward again. Apparently, it was the only exercise he ever got. \"You're aware that Viking Spacecraft is one of the corporations under the management of Ravenhurst Holdings?\"  I nodded. Viking Spacecraft built some of the biggest and best spacecraft in the System. It held most of Ceres--all of it, in fact, except the Government Reservation. It had moved out to the asteroids a long time back, after the big mining concerns began cutting up the smaller asteroids for metal. The raw materials are easier to come by out here than they are on Earth, and it's a devil of a lot easier to build spacecraft under low-gee conditions than it is under the pull of Earth or Luna or Mars.  \"Do you know anything about the experimental robotic ships being built on Eros?\" Ravenhurst asked.  \"Not much,\" I admitted. \"I've heard about them, but I don't know any of the details.\" That wasn't quite true, but I've found it doesn't pay to tell everybody everything you know.  \"The engineering details aren't necessary,\" Ravenhurst said. \"Besides, I don't know them, myself. The point is that Viking is trying to build a ship that will be as easy to operate as a flitterboat--a one-man cargo vessel. Perhaps even a completely automatic job for cargo, and just use a one-man crew for the passenger vessels. Imagine how that would cut the cost of transportation in the Solar System! Imagine how it would open up high-speed cargo transfer if an automatic vessel could accelerate at twenty or twenty-five gees to turnover!\"  I'll give Ravenhurst this: He had a light in his eyes that showed a real excitement about the prospect he was discussing, and it wasn't due entirely to the money he might make.  \"Sounds fine,\" I said. \"What seems to be the trouble?\"  His face darkened half a shade. \"The company police suspect sabotage, Mr. Oak.\"  \"How? What kind?\"  [Illustration]  \"They don't know. Viking has built six ships of that type--the McGuire class, the engineers call it. Each one has been slightly different than the one before, of course, as they ironed out the bugs in their operation. But each one has been a failure. Not one of them would pass the test for space-worthiness.\"  \"Not a failure of the drive or the ordinary mechanisms of the ship, I take it?\"  Ravenhurst sniffed. \"Of course not. The brain. The ships became, as you might say, _non compos mentis_. As a matter of fact, when the last one simply tried to burrow into the surface of Eros by reversing its drive, one of the roboticists said that a coroner's jury would have returned a verdict of 'suicide while of unsound mind' if there were inquests held for spaceships.\"  \"That doesn't make much sense,\" I said.  \"No. It doesn't. It isn't sensible. Those ships' brains shouldn't have behaved that way. Robot brains don't go mad unless they're given instructions to do so--conflicting orders, erroneous information, that sort of thing. Or, unless they have actual physical defects in the brains themselves.\"  \"The brains can handle the job of flying a ship all right, though?\" I asked. \"I mean, they have the capacity for it?\"  \"Certainly. They're the same type that's used to"]]]
