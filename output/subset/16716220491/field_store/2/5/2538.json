Owing to the coiling of the end of the long tail the plane of the section, as is seen in figure 5I, passes through the posterior end of the embryo no less than four times. In the most posterior of these four sections of the tail, beginning slightly caudad to the section here shown, is seen a small cavity which may be called the post-anal gut, _pag_. It has thick walls, and extends for about thirty-five sections in the series under discussion. Its lumen is very large in its caudal region, figure 5I, _pag_, and tapers gradually cephalad until it disappears. Posteriorly the post-anal gut ends quite abruptly not very far from the extreme tip of the tail.  Figure 5J is a composite drawing from reconstructions of the enterons of two embryos of approximately this stage. One of these reconstructions was plotted on paper from a series of transverse sections; the other was made in wax from a series of sagittal sections. For the sake of simplicity the gill clefts are not represented, and the pharynx, mouth, and liver are represented in outline only. For the same reason the lung rudiment of one side only is shown.  The relative size of the pharynx, _ph_, as seen in the figure, is smaller than it is in reality because of the small dorso-ventral diameter (the only one here shown) compared to the lateral diameter. The end of the lung rudiment, _lu_, is slightly enlarged and lies in a plane nearer to the observer than that of the oesophagus, _oe_, though this is not well shown in the figure.  The oesophagus, _oe_, diminishes slightly in caliber for a short distance caudad to the origin of the lungs, then gradually increases in caliber until it suddenly bends to the side (towards the observer) and merges into the wide stomach, _i´_. The stomach, which is irregularly conical in shape, lies in a place slightly nearer the observer than the end of the lung rudiment mentioned above.  Lying to one side of the stomach and duodenum, and extending cephalad beyond the end of the lung rudiment is the liver, _li_, whose outline is only roughly shown here by the broken line. The stomach opens rather abruptly into the duodenum, _d_, which slopes back towards the plane of the oesophagus (away from the observer).  The projection from the side of the duodenum, _pan_, not well figured here, indicates the position of the pancreas, better shown in the next reconstruction. The duodenum extends only a short distance caudad to this point and then opens, _aip_, to the yolk-sac.  The yolk-stalk, or unclosed region of the enteron, is still of considerable extent, though its exact boundaries are not easy to determine. The distance between the anterior and posterior intestinal portals is approximately shown in the figure under discussion.  The hindgut is cylindrical in cross section and of about the same diameter throughout, except for a slight enlargement in the cloacal region.  The post-anal gut is not shown here; it will be described in connection with the next reconstruction where it is figured.  Figure 6 is a surface view in profile of an embryo of the next stage to be studied. The manus and pes are here well developed, and the general development of the embryo is in considerable advancement over the last stage studied.  Figure 6A represents a reconstruction, from a series of transverse sections, of the enteron of an embryo of about the age of the one shown in figure 6. The outlines of the entire embryo, of the eye, _e_, and of the anterior, _aa_, and posterior, _pa_, appendages are shown by broken lines. Its position being coincident with that of the stomach, liver, and pancreas, the anterior appendage can scarcely be seen. The enteron, including one lung only, for the sake of simplicity, is shaded solid black, while the liver and pancreas, with their ducts, are outlines with unbroken lines. As in the preceding reconstruction no attempt is made to show the gill clefts, and only the dorso-ventral profile of the enteron is shown. Caudad to the pharynx, the enteron being more or less cylindrical in section, this profile gives a good idea of its shape, but in the pharyngeal region, where the lateral diameter is so much greater than the dorso-ventral, the reconstruction gives but a poor idea of the size of that part of the enteron.  The widely-open mouth, _m_, leads, with no line of demarkation, into the pharynx, _ph_, which is of irregular outline and, as has been said, of much greater lateral than dorso-ventral diameter.  The pharynx becomes gradually constricted to form the oesophagus, _oe_, a very long and slender structure, which, as will be seen in cross section, is, at this stage, solid for the greater part of its length. As in the case of the pharynx, the lateral diameter of the oesophagus is generally greater than the dorso-ventral diameter.  From the floor of the caudal part of the pharynx is pushed out the trachea, _ta_. In the reconstruction, especially in the anterior end, the trachea appears several times the diameter of the oesophagus; this is due to the great thickness and indefiniteness of its walls rather than to a greater diameter of its lumen.  At about the position of the line _ta_ the trachea divides into the two bronchi (only one shown in the figure), which are somewhat enlarged at the ends to form the lung rudiments, _lu_. While the trachea and bronchi lie ventrad to the oesophagus, the lungs lie laterad and even dorsad to the oesophagus and cardiac end of the stomach. Caudad to the heart and in the region of the anterior appendages, _aa_, the oesophagus suddenly enlarges to form the stomach, _i´_, which has now quite the outline of the typical human stomach.  From the stomach the duodenum, _d_, extends, following a sort of V-shaped course, towards the yolk-stalk, _ys_. In the region of the yolk-stalk it is somewhat enlarged and ends in a blind sac like a caecum. At the side of this sac is seen the opening of the enteron to the yolk-stalk; the anterior and posterior intestinal portals are not distinguishable from each other. From this point the hindgut, _hg_, extends cephalad until it lies laterad to the middle region of the duodenum, then bends through 180° and extends, in an almost straight line, to the cloaca, _cl_, lying in the region of the posterior appendage, _pa_.  The allantois, _al_, extends cephalad for some distance from the floor of the cloaca. Some distance caudad to the cloaca, near the end of the much coiled tail, is seen the post-anal gut, _pag_. This structure as has been noted above, is quite distinct from the other parts of the enteron. It is of elongated, pyriform outline, with the pointed end extending cephalad.  In the narrow space between the stomach and the duodenum is the elongated pancreas, _pan_, opening by two or more short ducts into the duodenum.  The liver, _li_, in the figure under discussion, has about twice the area of the stomach. It extends caudad and dorsal about the same distance as the latter organ, but it extends ventrad and cephalad far beyond the boundaries of the stomach.  Extending along the ventral border of the liver is a long narrow duct, apparently the bile duct, _bd_. It connects, caudally, with the anterior end of the pancreas, while at its other extremity, near the antero-ventral corner of the liver; it ends blindly.  The transverse sections now to be described have been selected from the series from which the reconstruction, just described, was made.  Figure 6B represents a typical section through the pharynx. Its plane is approximately shown by the line 400 of figure 6A though the plane apparently does not cut the eye, _e_. The pharynx, _ph_, has here the outline of an irregular V. Its walls, except at the outer angles of the clefts, _g^1_, are composed of but a single layer of cells. In the dorsal wall these cells are flattened, while in the ventral wall they are more rounded. This difference in the shape of the cells accounts for the slightly greater thickness of the floor over that of the roof of the pharynx. The gill clefts no longer communicate with the exterior.  Figure 6C represents the caudal half of the embryo in the plane 475 of figure 6A. The section of the pharynx, _ph_, is here crescentic in outline, and the pharyngeal walls, especially the floor, are somewhat thicker than in the more anterior section just described. Lying a short distance dorsad to the pharynx are seen two small, thick-walled openings, _ty_; these are the rudiments of the thymus glands. They are here quite distinct from the enteron, and may be traced through a large number of sections, being in some regions solid and of a smaller diameter than in the present section.  Figure 6D is in the region of the line 500 in figure 6A. The thymus rudiments, _ty_, have about the same appearance as in the preceding figure, except that they are somewhat larger. The pharynx, _ph_, is much smaller than in the last section, and though somewhat crescentic in outline, its convex side is dorsal instead of ventral in position. The pharyngeal walls are here thicker, and consist of two or three layers of cells, instead of the single layer of more anterior sections.  In the median plane the floor of the pharynx is pushed down, as a solid tongue of cells, _gs_, the anterior edge of the glottis. Ventrad and laterad to the glottis a crescentic condensation of mesoblast represents the beginning of the laryngeal cartilages, _la_.  Two or three sections caudad to the one just described, the two layers of which the tongue of cells from the floor of the pharynx is composed separate slightly at the bottom to form a small cavity, the trachea, _ta_; this condition is shown in figure 6E, which represents part of a section through the plane 532 of figure 6A.  The oesophagus, _oe_, is here a solid, crescentic mass of cells, the lumen being completely obliterated.

I merely meant that you could point out to her, as a father, where her duty and happiness lie.\"  \"Drink this!\" cried his lordship with sudden fury, spraying his can over the nearest bush, and addressing his remark to the invisible thrips. He had forgotten Lady Caroline completely. \"Don't stint yourselves! There's lots more!\"  A girl came down the steps of the castle and made her way towards them. She was a good-looking girl, with an air of quiet efficiency about her. Her eyes were grey and whimsical. Her head was uncovered, and the breeze stirred her dark hair. She made a graceful picture in the morning sunshine, and Reggie Byng, sighting her from the terrace, wobbled in his tracks, turned pink, and lost the thread of his remarks.  The sudden appearance of Alice Faraday always affected him like that.  \"I have copied out the notes you made last night, Lord Marshmoreton. I typed two copies.\"  Alice Faraday spoke in a quiet, respectful, yet subtly authoritative voice. She was a girl of great character. Previous employers of her services as secretary had found her a jewel. To Lord Marshmoreton she was rapidly becoming a perfect incubus. Their views on the relative importance of gardening and family histories did not coincide. To him the history of the Marshmoreton family was the occupation of the idle hour: she seemed to think that he ought to regard it as a life-work. She was always coming and digging him out of the garden and dragging him back to what should have been a purely after-dinner task. It was Lord Marshmoreton's habit, when he awoke after one of his naps too late to resume work, to throw out some vague promise of \"attending to it tomorrow\"; but, he reflected bitterly, the girl ought to have tact and sense to understand that this was only polite persiflage, and not to be taken literally.  \"They are very rough,\" continued Alice, addressing her conversation to the seat of his lordship's corduroy trousers. Lord Marshmoreton always assumed a stooping attitude when he saw Miss Faraday approaching with papers in her hand; for he laboured under a pathetic delusion, of which no amount of failures could rid him, that if she did not see his face she would withdraw. \"You remember last night you promised you would attend to them this morning.\" She paused long enough to receive a non-committal grunt by way of answer. \"Of course, if you're busy--\" she said placidly, with a half-glance at Lady Caroline. That masterful woman could always be counted on as an ally in these little encounters.  \"Nothing of the kind!\" said Lady Caroline crisply. She was still ruffled by the lack of attention which her recent utterances had received, and welcomed the chance of administering discipline. \"Get up at once, John, and go in and work.\"  \"I am working,\" pleaded Lord Marshmoreton.  Despite his forty-eight years his sister Caroline still had the power at times to make him feel like a small boy. She had been a great martinet in the days of their mutual nursery.  \"The Family History is more important than grubbing about in the dirt. I cannot understand why you do not leave this sort of thing to MacPherson. Why you should pay him liberal wages and then do his work for him, I cannot see. You know the publishers are waiting for the History. Go and attend to these notes at once.\"  \"You promised you would attend to them this morning, Lord Marshmoreton,\" said Alice invitingly.  Lord Marshmoreton clung to his can of whale-oil solution with the clutch of a drowning man. None knew better than he that these interviews, especially when Caroline was present to lend the weight of her dominating personality, always ended in the same way.  \"Yes, yes, yes!\" he said. \"Tonight, perhaps. After dinner, eh? Yes, after dinner. That will be capital.\"  \"I think you ought to attend to them this morning,\" said Alice, gently persistent. It really perturbed this girl to feel that she was not doing work enough to merit her generous salary. And on the subject of the history of the Marshmoreton family she was an enthusiast. It had a glamour for her.  Lord Marshmoreton's fingers relaxed their hold. Throughout the rose-garden hundreds of spared thrips went on with their morning meal, unwitting of doom averted.  \"Oh, all right, all right, all right! Come into the library.\"  \"Very well, Lord Marshmoreton.\" Miss Faraday turned to Lady Caroline. \"I have been looking up the trains, Lady Caroline. The best is the twelve-fifteen. It has a dining-car, and stops at Belpher if signalled.\"  \"Are you going away, Caroline?\" inquired Lord Marshmoreton hopefully.  \"I am giving a short talk to the Social Progress League at Lewisham. I shall return tomorrow.\"  \"Oh!\" said Marshmoreton, hope fading from his voice.  \"Thank you, Miss Faraday,\" said Lady Caroline. \"The twelve-fifteen.\"  \"The motor will be round at a quarter to twelve.\"  \"Thank you. Oh, by the way, Miss Faraday, will you call to Reggie as you pass, and tell him I wish to speak to him.\"  Maud had left Reggie by the time Alice Faraday reached him, and that ardent youth was sitting on a stone seat, smoking a cigarette and entertaining himself with meditations in which thoughts of Alice competed for precedence with graver reflections connected with the subject of the correct stance for his approach-shots. Reggie's was a troubled spirit these days. He was in love, and he had developed a bad slice with his mid-iron. He was practically a soul in torment.  \"Lady Caroline asked me to tell you that she wishes to speak to you, Mr. Byng.\"  Reggie leaped from his seat.  \"Hullo-ullo-ullo! There you are! I mean to say, what?\"  He was conscious, as was his custom in her presence, of a warm, prickly sensation in the small of the back. Some kind of elephantiasis seemed to have attacked his hands and feet, swelling them to enormous proportions. He wished profoundly that he could get rid of his habit of yelping with nervous laughter whenever he encountered the girl of his dreams. It was calculated to give her a wrong impression of a chap--make her think him a fearful chump and what not!  \"Lady Caroline is leaving by the twelve-fifteen.\"  \"That's good! What I mean to say is--oh, she is, is she? I see what you mean.\" The absolute necessity of saying something at least moderately coherent gripped him. He rallied his forces. \"You wouldn't care to come for a stroll, after I've seen the mater, or a row on the lake, or any rot like that, would you?\"  \"Thank you very much, but I must go in and help Lord Marshmoreton with his book.\"  \"What a rotten--I mean, what a dam' shame!\"  The pity of it tore at Reggie's heart strings. He burned with generous wrath against Lord Marshmoreton, that modern Simon Legree, who used his capitalistic power to make a slave of this girl and keep her toiling indoors when all the world was sunshine.  \"Shall I go and ask him if you can't put it off till after dinner?\"  \"Oh, no, thanks very much. I'm sure Lord Marshmoreton wouldn't dream of it.\"  She passed on with a pleasant smile. When he had recovered from the effect of this Reggie proceeded slowly to the upper level to meet his step-mother.  \"Hullo, mater. Pretty fit and so forth? What did you want to see me about?\"  \"Well, Reggie, what is the news?\"  \"Eh? What? News? Didn't you get hold of a paper at breakfast? Nothing much in it. Tam Duggan beat Alec Fraser three up and two to play at Prestwick. I didn't notice anything else much. There's a new musical comedy at the Regal. Opened last night, and seems to be just like mother makes. The Morning Post gave it a topping notice. I must trickle up to town and see it some time this week.\"  Lady Caroline frowned. This slowness in the uptake, coming so soon after her brother's inattention, displeased her.  \"No, no, no. I mean you and Maud have been talking to each other for quite a long time, and she seemed very interested in what you were saying. I hoped you might have some good news for me.\"  Reggie's face brightened. He caught her drift.  \"Oh, ah, yes, I see what you mean. No, there wasn't anything of that sort or shape or order.\"  \"What were you saying to her, then, that interested her so much?\"  \"I was explaining how I landed dead on the pin with my spoon out of a sand-trap at the eleventh hole yesterday. It certainly was a pretty ripe shot, considering. I'd sliced into this baby bunker, don't you know; I simply can't keep 'em straight with the iron nowadays--and there the pill was, grinning up at me from the sand. Of course, strictly speaking, I ought to have used a niblick, but--\"  \"Do you mean to say, Reggie, that, with such an excellent opportunity, you did not ask Maud to marry you?\"  \"I see what you mean. Well, as a matter of absolute fact, I, as it were, didn't.\"  Lady Caroline uttered a wordless sound.  \"By the way, mater,\" said Reggie, \"I forgot to tell you about that. It's all off.\"  \"What!\"  \"Absolutely. You see, it appears there's a chappie unknown for whom Maud has an absolute pash. It seems she met this sportsman up in Wales last summer. She was caught in the rain, and he happened to be passing and rallied round with his rain-coat, and one thing led to another. Always raining in Wales, what! Good fishing, though, here and there. Well, what I mean is, this cove was so deucedly civil, and all that, that now she won't look at anybody else. He's the blue-eyed boy, and everybody else is an also-ran, with about as much chance as a blind man with one arm trying to get out of a bunker with a tooth-pick.\"  \"What perfect nonsense! I know all about that affair. It was just a passing fancy that never meant anything. Maud has got over that long ago.\"  \"She didn't seem to think so.\"  \"Now, Reggie,\" said Lady Caroline tensely, \"please listen to me. You know that the castle will be full of people in a day or two for Percy's coming-of-age, and this next few days may be your last chance of having a real, long,"]]]
