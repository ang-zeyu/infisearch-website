Russia began the work by bringing about an agreement between Bulgaria and Servia; England completed it by bringing Greece into the League.  There ensued a local, which, in accordance with the old diplomatic prophecy, was soon to lead to the universal conflagration.  Organized as she was, Greece succeeded better than anyone expected; and the national gratitude--the exuberant gratitude of a Southern people--went out to the two men directly responsible for that success: to King Constantine, whose brilliant generalship beat the enemy hosts; and to M. Venizelos, whose able statesmanship had prepared the field.  Poets and pamphleteers vied with each other in expatiating on the wonders they had performed, to the honour and advantage of their country.  In this ecstasy of popular adoration the spirit of the soldier and the spirit of the lawyer seemed to have met.  But the union was illusive and transient.  Between these two men, so strangely flung together by destiny, there existed no link of sympathy; and propinquity only forced the growth of their mutual antagonism.  The seeds of discord had already borne fruit upon the common ground of their Balkan exploits.  Immediately after the defeat of Turkey a quarrel over the spoils arose among the victors.  King Constantine, bearing in mind Bulgaria's long-cherished dream of hegemony, and persuaded that no sacrifices made by Greece and Servia could do more than defer a rupture, urged a Graeco-Servian alliance against their truculent partner.  He looked at the matter from a purely Greek standpoint and was anxious to secure the maximum of profit for his country.  M. Venizelos, on the other hand, aware that the Western Powers, and particularly England, wanted a permanent Balkan coalition as a barrier against Germany in the East, and anxious to retain those Powers' favour, was prepared to concede {6} much for the sake of averting a rupture.  Not until the Bulgars betrayed their intentions by actual aggressions in Macedonia did he withdraw his opposition to the alliance with Servia, which ushered in the Second Balkan War and led to the Peace of Bucharest.  He yielded to the pressure of the circumstances brought to bear upon him; but the encounter represented no more than the preliminary crossing of swords between two strong antagonists.     {7}  CHAPTER I  From the moment when the rupture between Austria and Servia, in July, 1914, came to disturb the peace, Greece deliberately adopted an attitude of neutrality, with the proviso that she would go to Servia's assistance in case of a Bulgarian attack upon the latter.  Such an attitude was considered to be in accordance with the Graeco-Servian Alliance.  For, although the Military Convention accompanying the Treaty contained a vague stipulation for mutual support in case of war between one of the allied States and \"a third Power,\" the Treaty itself had as its sole object mutual defence against Bulgaria.[1]  In the opinion of M. Venizelos, her pact did not oblige Greece to go to Servia's assistance against Austria, but at most to mobilize 40,000 men.[2]  Treaty obligations apart, neutrality was also imposed by practical considerations.  It was to the interest of Greece--a matter of self-preservation--not to tolerate a Bulgarian attack on Servia calculated to upset the Balkan balance of power established by the Peace of Bucharest, and she was firmly determined, in concert with Rumania, to oppose such an attack with all her might.  But as to Austria, M. Venizelos had to consider whether Greece could or could not offer her ally effective aid, and after consideration he decided that she {8} should not proceed even to the mobilization of 40,000 men, for such a measure might provoke a Bulgarian mobilization and precipitate complications.  For the rest, the attitude of Greece in face of Servia's war with Austria, M. Venizelos pointed out, corresponded absolutely with the attitude which Servia had taken up in face of Greece's recent crisis with Turkey.[3]  On that occasion Greece had obtained from her ally merely moral support, the view taken being that the _casus faederis_ would arise only in the event of Bulgarian intervention.[4]  Accordingly, when the Servian Government asked if it could count on armed assistance from Greece, M. Streit, Minister for Foreign Affairs under M. Venizelos, answered that the Greek Government was convinced that it fully performed its duty as a friend and ally by adopting, until Bulgaria moved, a policy of most benevolent neutrality.  The co-operation of Greece in the war with Austria, far from helping, would harm Servia; by becoming a belligerent Greece could only offer her ally forces negligible compared with the enemy's, while she would inevitably expose Salonica, the only port through which Servia could obtain war material, to an Austrian attack; and, moreover, she would weaken her army which, in the common interest, ought to be kept intact as a check on Bulgaria.[5]  A similar communication, emphasizing the decision to keep out of the conflict, and to intervene in concert with Rumania only should Bulgaria by intervening against Servia jeopardize the _status quo_ established by the Bucharest Treaty--in which case the action of Greece would have a purely Balkan character--was made to the Greek Ministers abroad after a Council held in the Royal Palace under the presidency of the King.[6]  This policy brought King Constantine into sharp collision with one of the Central Powers, whose conceptions in regard to the Balkans had not yet been harmonized.  Vienna readily acquiesced in the Greek Government's declaration that it could not permit Bulgaria to compromise {9} the Bucharest Treaty, and since by an eventual action against Bulgaria Greece would not quarrel with Austria, the Austrian Government, on its part, promised to abstain from manifesting any solidarity with Bulgaria in the event of a Graeco-Bulgarian war.[7] Not so Berlin.  The German Emperor egotistically presumed to dictate the course which Greece should pursue, and on 31 July he invited King Constantine to join Germany, backing the invitation with every appeal to sentiment and interest he could think of.  The memory of his father, who had been assassinated, made it impossible for Constantine to favour the Servian assassins; never would Greece have a better opportunity of emancipating herself, under the protection of the Central Powers, from the tutelage which Russia aimed at exercising over the Balkan Peninsula; if, contrary to the Kaiser's expectations, Greece took the other side, she would be exposed to a simultaneous attack from Italy, Bulgaria and Turkey, and by the same token all personal relations between him and Constantine would be broken for ever.  He ended with the words: \"I have spoken frankly, and I beg you to let me know your decision without delay and with the same absolute frankness.\"  He had nothing to complain of on that score.  King Constantine on 2 August replied that, while it was not the policy of Greece to take an active part in the Austro-Servian conflict, it was equally impossible for her \"to make common cause with the enemies of the Serbs and to fall upon them, since they are our allies.  It seems to me that the interests of Greece demand an absolute neutrality and the maintenance of the _status quo_ in the Balkans such as it has been created by the Treaty of Bucharest.\"  He went on to add that Greece was determined, in concert with Rumania, to prevent Bulgaria from aggrandizing herself at the expense of Servia; if that happened, the balance in the Balkans would be upset and it would bring about the very Russian tutelage which the Kaiser feared.  \"This way of thinking,\" he concluded, \"is shared by the whole of my people.\"  What the Kaiser thought of these opinions was summed up in one word on the margin, \"Rubbish.\"  This, however, was not meant for his brother-in-law's ears.  To him he {10} used less terse language.  On 4 August he informed King Constantine through the Greek Minister in Berlin that an alliance had that day been concluded between Germany and Turkey, that Bulgaria and Rumania were similarly ranging themselves on Germany's side, and that the German men-of-war in the Mediterranean were going to join the Turkish fleet in order to act together.  Thus all the Balkan States were siding with Germany in the struggle against Slavism.  Would Greece alone stand out?  His Imperial Majesty appealed to King Constantine as a comrade, as a German Field Marshal of whom the German Army was proud, as a brother-in-law; he reminded him that it was thanks to his support that Greece was allowed to retain Cavalla; he begged him to mobilize his army, place himself by the Kaiser's side and march hand in hand against the common enemy--Slavism.  He made this urgent appeal for the last time, convinced that the King of Greece would respond to it.  If not, all would be over between the two countries--this being a slightly attenuated version of another marginal note: \"I will treat Greece as an enemy if she does not adhere at once.\"  King Constantine's answer was tactful but final: His personal sympathies and his political opinions, he said, were on the Kaiser's side.  But alas! that which the Kaiser asked him to do was completely out of the question.  Greece could not under any conceivable circumstances side against the Entente: the Mediterranean was at the mercy of the united French and British fleets, which could destroy the Greek marine, both royal and mercantile, take the Greek islands, and wipe Greece off the map.  Things being so, neutrality, he declared, was the only policy for Greece, and he ended up by meeting the Kaiser's threat with a counter-threat, none the less pointed for being veiled under the guise of an \"assurance not to touch his friends among my neighbours (i.e. Bulgaria and Turkey) as long as they do not touch our local Balkan interests.\" [8"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22689"],["title","The Confessions of a Caricaturist, Vol. 2 (#1)"],["body","                       86   Hebe                                                                  86   My Driver                                                             87   Fra' Huddersfield                                                     87   Niagara growing upon Me                                               88   I admire the great Horseshoe Fall                                     89   Jonathan harnessing Niagara                                           90   \"The Three Sisters.\"                                                  91   Inclined Railway, Niagara                                             92   Where Captain Webb was Killed                                         93   Tourists                                                              94   American Travelling.
