This being done with admiration to the beholders, after some short pause, fire the train of the Castle, that the pieces all of one side may go off, then fire the Trains, of one side of the Ship as in a battel; next turn the Chargers; and by degrees fire the trains of each other side as before. This done to sweeten the stink of powder, let the Ladies take the egg-shells full of sweet waters and throw them at each other. All dangers being seemingly over, by this time you may suppose they will desire to see what is in the pyes; where lifting first the lid off one pye, out skip some Frogs, which make the Ladies to skip and shreek; next after the other pye, whence come out the Birds, who by a natural instinct flying in the light, will put out the Candles; so that what with the flying Birds and skipping Frogs, the one above, the other beneath, will cause much delight and pleasure to the whole company: at length the Candles are lighted, and a banquet brought in, the Musick sounds, and every one with much delight and content rehearses their actions in the former passages.

Thus with all meats sauce shall have the operation.       Directions for the order of carving Fowl.     _Lift that Swan._  The manner of cutting up a Swan must be to slit her right down in the middle of the breast, and so clean thorow the back from the neck to the rump, so part her in two halves cleanly and handsomly, that you break not nor tear the meat, lay the two halves in a fair charger with the slit sides downwards, throw salt about it, and let it again on the Table. Let your sauce be chaldron for a Swan, and serve it in saucers.     _Rear the Goose._  You must break a goose contrary to the former way. Take a goose being roasted, and take off both his legs fair like a shoulder of Lamb, take him quite from the body then cut off the belly piece round close to the lower end of the breast: lace her down with your knife clean through the breast on each side your thumbs bredth for the bone in the middle of the breast; then take off the pinion of each side, and the flesh which you first lac't with your knife, raise it up clear from the bone, and take it from the carcase with the pinion; then cut up the bone which lieth before in the breast (which is commonly call'd the merry thought) the skin and the flesh being upon it; then cut from the brest-bone, another slice of flesh clean thorow, & take it clean from the bone, turn your carcase, and cut it asunder the back-bone above the loin-bones: then take the rump-end of the back-bone, and lay it in a fair dish with the skinny-side upwards, lay at the fore-end of that the merry-thought with the skin side upward, and before that the apron of the goose; then lay your pinions on each side contrary, set your legs on each side contrary behind them, that the bone end of the legs may stand up cross in the middle of the dish, & the wing pinions on the outside of them; put under the wing pinions on each side the long slices of flesh which you cut from the breast bone, and let the ends meet under the leg bones, let the other ends lie cut in the dish betwixt the leg and the pinion; then pour your sauce into the dish under your meat, throw on salt, and set it on the table.     _To cut up a Turkey or Bustard._  Raise up the leg very fair, and open the joynt with the point of your knife, but take not off the leg; then lace down the breast with your knife on both sides, & open the breast pinion with the knife, but take not the pinion off; then raise up the merry-thought betwixt the breast bone, and the top of the merry-thought, lace down the flesh on both sides of the breast-bone, and raise up the flesh called the brawn, turn it outward upon both sides, but break it not, nor cut it not off; then cut off the wing pinion at the joynt next to the body, and stick on each side the pinion in the place where ye turned out the brawn, but cut off the sharp end "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22793"],["title","The Standard Oratorios: Their Stories, Their Music, And Their Composers (#1)"],["body"," wif, in twenty devill ways,       Or alles stand thee without.\"  Her friends the gossips entreat her to remain with them, and have a carousal over a \"pottel full of malmsey;\" but at last Shem makes a virtue of necessity and forces her into the ark, as the following scene shows:--        \"In faith, moder, in ye shall,       Whither you will or noughte.\"              NOE.        \"Well me wif into this boate.\"           [_She gives him a box on the ear._]       \"Haue you that for thee note.\"              NOE.        \"A le Mary this whote,       A childre methinks my boate remeues,       Our tarrying here heughly me grieues.\"           [_She is forced into the ark._]  The earliest of these representations, so far as has been discovered, dates back to the twelfth century, and is known as the Feast of Asses. In these exhibitions, Balaam, superbly habited and wearing an enormous pair of spurs, rode a wooden ass, in which the speaker was concealed. The ass and the devil were favorite characters. The former sometimes appeared in monkish garb and brayed responses to the intonations of the priests, while the latter, arrayed in fantastic costumes, seems to have been the prototype of clown in the pantomime. As late as 1783 the buffoonery of this kind of exhibition continued. An English traveller, describing a mystery called the \"Creation\" which he saw at Bamberg in that year, says:--    \"Young priests had the wings of geese tied on their shoulders to   personate angels. Adam appeared on the scene in a big curled wig and   brocaded morning-gown. Among the animals that passed before him to   receive their names were a well-shod horse, pigs with rings in their   noses, and a mastiff with a brass collar. A cow's rib-bone had been   provided for the formation of Eve; but the mastiff spied it out,   grabbed it, and carried it off. The angels tried to whistle him back;   but not succeeding, they chased him, gave him a kicking, and recovered   the bone, which they placed under a trap-door by the side of the   sleeping Adam, whence there soon emerged a lanky priest in a loose   robe, to personate Eve.\"  The buffoonery and profanity of the early exhibitions, however, gradually wore away when the Church assumed the monopoly of them and forbade secular performances. Among the earlier works Burney cites the following:--    \"The 'Conversion of St. Paul,' performed at Rome, 1440, as described by   Sulpicius, has been erroneously called the first opera, or musical   drama. 'Abram et Isaac suo Figliuolo,' a sacred drama (_azione sacra_),   'showing how Abraham was commanded by God to sacrifice his son Isaac on   the mountain,' was performed in the Church of St. Mary Magdalen in   Florence, 1449. Another on the same subject, called 'Abraham and   Sarah,' 'containing the good life of their son Isaac, and the bad   conduct of Ishmael, the son of his handmaid, and how they were turned   out of the house,' was printed in 1556; 'Abel e Caino,' and 'Samson,'   1554; 'The Prodigal Son,' 1565; and 'La Commedia Spirituale dell'   Anima' ('The Spiritual Comedy of the Soul'), printed at Siena, without   date, in which there are near thirty personifications, besides Saint   Paul, Saint John Chrysostom, two little boys who repeat a kind of   prelude, and the announcing angel, who always speaks the prologue in   these old mysteries. He is called _l'angelo che nunzia_, and his figure   is almost always given in a wooden cut on the title-page of printed   copies. Here, among the interlocutors, we have God the Father, Michael   the archangel, a chorus of angels, the Human Soul with her guardian   angel, memory, intellect, free-will, faith, hope, charity, reason,   prudence, temperance, fortitude, justice, mercy, poverty, patience, and   humility; with hatred, infidelity, despair, sensuality, a chorus of   demons, and the devil. None of these mysteries are totally without   music, as there are choruses and _laudi_, or hymns, that are sung in   them all, and sometimes there was playing on instruments between the   acts. In a play written by Damiano and printed at Siena, 1519,   according to Crescimbeni, at the beginning of every act there was an   octave stanza, which was sung to the sound of the lyra viol by a   personage called Orpheus, who was solely retained for that purpose; at   other times a madrigal was sung between the acts, after the manner of a   chorus.\"  It was not until the time when San Filippo Neri began his dramatization and performance of Biblical stories, such as \"The Good Samaritan,\" \"The Prodigal Son,\" and \"Tobias and the Angels,\" accompanied with music written by his friend Giovanni Animuccia, that the term \"Oratorio\" came to be accepted as the distinctive title of these sacred musical dramas. His productions were very crudely and hastily arranged, his only purpose having been to render his service attractive. After his death, however, in 1595, his work was continued by Emilio del Cavaliere, a Roman composer, who produced the first real oratorio which had as yet appeared. It was entitled \"La Rappresentazione dell' Anima e del Corpo\" (\"The Soul and the Body\"), and was first performed in February, 1600, in the oratory of the Church of Santa Maria della Vallicella at Rome. Burney assigns to it the credit of being \"the first sacred drama or oratorio in which recitative was used.\" The characters were Time, Human Life, the World, Pleasure, the Intellect, the Soul, the Body, and two youths who were to recite the prologue. The orchestra was composed of a double lyre, a harpsichord, a large or double guitar, and two flutes. The composer has left some curious instructions for the performance of his work; among them the following:--    \"Pleasure, an imaginary character, with two companions, are to have   instruments in their hands, on which they are to play while they sing   and perform the ritornels.    \"Il Corpo, the Body, when these words are uttered, 'Sí che hormai alma   mia,' etc., may throw away some of his ornaments, as his gold collar,   feather from his hat, etc.    \"The World, and Human Life in particular, are to be gayly and richly   dressed; and when they are divested of their trappings, to appear very   poor and wretched, and at length dead carcases.\"  The ballet played a prominent part in all the early oratorios, and the composer has also left detailed instructions for its guidance. During the ritornels the four principal dancers accompanied them in \"a ballet enlivened with capers,\" and at the close of the performance stanzas were sung, alternating with dances to be executed \"sedately and reverentially.\"  Emilio del Cavaliere was followed by a long line of Italian oratorio composers who contributed to amplify and enrich this form of composition. Among the earliest of these writers were Carissimi, Stradella, Scarlatti, Mazzocchi, Federici, Pistocchi, Caldara, and Colonna. Carissimi perfected the recitative and invested the music with more importance, giving it something like equal rank with the dramatic character of the composition. It was during his time that the personage known as \"Historicus\" was introduced, who continued the action with explanatory passages between the numbers,--a modern illustration of which may be found in the \"Narrator,\" as used by Gounod in his \"Redemption.\" Carissimi employed this expedient, and made it very effective. It is also claimed that he was the first to introduce the cantata as a form of church music, and the accompaniment of violins in motet performances. His most famous oratorios are \"Jephte,\" \"Abraham et Isaac,\" \"Le Jugement Dernier,\" and \"Judicium Salomonis.\" Of the first named, Hawkins says: \"It consists of recitative, airs, and chorus; and for sweetness of melody, artful modulation, and original harmony, is justly esteemed one of the finest efforts of musical skill and genius that the world knows of.\" Stradella, whose romantic history is familiar to every one, is chiefly remembered by his attachment for Hortensia, the vengeance of the Venetian lover which followed them so long, and the song which saved the composer's life from the assassins. This song was from his own oratorio, \"St. John the Baptist,\" first performed in the Church of St. John Lateran at Rome. Burney, who examined the score, says: \"The recitative is in general excellent, and there is scarce a movement among the airs in which genius, skill, and study do not appear.\" He also observes that this oratorio is the first work in which the proper sharps and flats are generally placed at the clef. Scarlatti, born in 1659, was a composer of great originality, as well as versatility. He has left, in addition to his numerous operas and cantatas, several oratorios, the most famous of which are \"I Dolori di Maria sempre Vergine,\" \"Il Sagrifizio d' Abramo,\" \"Il Martirio di Santa Teodosia,\" and \"La Concezzione della beata Vergine.\" He gave to the oratorio more breadth, boldness, and dignity of style, improved the form of the aria, made the accompanied recitative more dramatic, and developed the treatment of several instruments, among them the trumpet, whose real beauty and effect he was the first to bring out. Mazzocchi is chiefly known by his oratorio, \"Querimonia,\" produced in Rome in 1631, which is said to have drawn tears from all who heard it. Federici wrote two oratorios, \"Santa Cristina,\" and \"Santa Caterina de Sienna,\" in both of which \"interstitial\" accompaniment is used for the first time; that is, the violins, instead of accompanying the voice, repeat portions of the melody in short symphonies. Pistocchi was one of the most prominent stage-singers of his time, and established a school of singing at Bologna. His most famous oratorio is entitled \"Maria Vergine addolerata,\" and is without overture or chorus. Burney notes that in the close of this work degrees of diminution of sound, such as \"piano,\" \"più piano,\" and \"pianissimo,\" are used for the first time. Caldara wrote a large number of oratorios, mostly adapted to the poetry of"]]]
