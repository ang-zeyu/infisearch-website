Darkness that could be felt between the flashes of lightning.  Thunder that was nearly drowned by the roaring of the wind an' the crashing of everything all round.  To save their lives the people had to fling themselves into ditches and hollows of the ground.  Mr Ross and some of his people were lying in the shelter of a wall near his house.  There had been a schooner lying not far off.  When Mr Ross raised his head cautiously above the wall to have a look to wind'ard he saw the schooner comin' straight for him on the top of a big wave.  `Hold on!' he shouted, fell flat down, and laid hold o' the nearest bush.  Next moment the wave burst right over the wall, roared on up to the garden, 150 yards above high-water mark, and swept his house clean away!  By good fortune the wall stood the shock, and the schooner stuck fast just before reachin' it, but so near that the end of the jib-boom passed right over the place where the household lay holdin' on for dear life and half drowned.  It was a tremendous night,\" concluded the captain, \"an' nearly everything on the islands was wrecked, but they've survived it, as you'll see. Though it's seven years since that cyclone swep' over them, they're all right and goin' ahead again, full swing, as if nothin' had happened.\"  \"And is Ross the Third still king?\" asked Nigel with much interest.  \"Ay--at least he was king a few years ago when I passed this way and had occasion to land to replace a tops'l yard that had been carried away.\"  \"Then you won't arrive as a stranger?\"  \"I should think not,\" returned the captain, getting up and gazing steadily at the _atoll_ or group of islets enclosed within a coral ring which they were gradually approaching.  Night had descended, however, and the gale had decreased almost to a calm, ere they steered through the narrow channel--or what we may call a broken part of the ring--which led to the calm lagoon inside.  Nigel Roy leaned over the bow, watching with profound attention the numerous phosphorescent fish and eel-like creatures which darted hither and thither like streaks of silver from beneath their advancing keel.  He had enough of the naturalist in him to arouse in his mind keen interest in the habits and action of the animal life around him, and these denizens of the coral-groves were as new to him as their appearance was unexpected.  \"You'll find 'em very kind and hospitable, lad,\" said the captain to his son.  \"What, the fish?\"  \"No, the inhabitants.  Port--port--steady!\"  \"Steady it is!\" responded the man at the wheel.  \"Let go!\" shouted the captain.  A heavy plunge, followed by the rattling of chains and swinging round of the brig, told that they had come to an anchor in the lagoon of the Cocos-Keeling Islands.    CHAPTER THREE.  INTERESTING PARTICULARS OF VARIOUS KINDS.  By the first blush of dawn Nigel Roy hastened on deck, eager to see the place in regard to which his father's narrative had awakened in him considerable interest.  It not only surpassed but differed from all his preconceived ideas.  The brig floated on the bosom of a perfectly calm lake of several miles in width, the bottom of which, with its bright sand and brilliant coral-beds, could be distinctly seen through the pellucid water.  This lake was encompassed by a reef of coral which swelled here and there into tree-clad islets, and against which the breakers of the Indian Ocean were dashed into snowy foam in their vain but ceaseless efforts to invade the calm serenity of the lagoon.  Smaller islands, rich with vegetation, were scattered here and there within the charmed circle, through which several channels of various depths and sizes connected the lagoon with the ocean.  \"We shall soon have the king himself off to welcome us,\" said Captain Roy as he came on deck and gave a sailor-like glance all round the horizon and then up at the sky from the mere force of habit.  \"Visitors are not numerous here.  A few scientific men have landed now and again; Darwin the great naturalist among others in 1836, and Forbes in 1878. No doubt they'll be very glad to welcome Nigel Roy in this year of grace 1883.\"  \"But I'm not a naturalist, father, more's the pity.\"  \"No matter, lad; you're an ammytoor first mate, an' pr'aps a poet may count for somethin' here.  They lead poetical lives and are fond o' poetry.\"  \"Perhaps that accounts for the fondness you say they have for you, father.\"  \"Just so, lad.  See!--there's a boat puttin' off already: the king, no doubt.\"  He was right.  Mr Ross, the appointed governor, and \"King of the Cocos Islands,\" was soon on deck, heartily shaking hands with and welcoming Captain Roy as an old friend.  He carried him and his son off at once to breakfast in his island-home; introduced Nigel to his family, and then showed them round the settlement, assuring them at the same time that all its resources were at their disposal for the repair of the _Sunshine_.  \"Thank 'ee kindly,\" said the captain in reply, \"but I'll only ask for a stick to rig up a fore-topmast to carry us to Batavia, where we'll give the old craft a regular overhaul--for it's just possible she may have received some damage below the water-line, wi' bumpin' on the mast and yards.\"  The house of the \"King\" was a commodious, comfortable building in the midst of a garden, in which there were roses in great profusion, as well as fruit-trees and flowering shrubs.  Each Keeling family possessed a neat well-furnished plank cottage enclosed in a little garden, besides a boat-house at the water-edge on the inner or lagoon side of the reef, and numerous boats were lying about on the white sand.  The islanders, being almost born sailors, were naturally very skilful in everything connected with the sea.  There was about them a good deal of that kindly innocence which one somehow expects to find associated with a mild paternal government and a limited intercourse with the surrounding world, and Nigel was powerfully attracted by them from the first.  After an extensive ramble, during which Mr Ross plied the captain with eager questions as to the latest news from the busy centres of civilisation--especially with reference to new inventions connected with engineering--the island king left them to their own resources till dinner-time, saying that he had duties to attend to connected with the kingdom!  \"Now, boy,\" said the captain when their host had gone, \"what'll 'ee do? Take a boat and have a pull over the lagoon, or go with me to visit a family I'm particularly fond of, an' who are uncommon fond of _me_!\"  \"Visit the family, of course,\" said Nigel.  \"I can have a pull any day.\"  \"Come along then.\"  He led the way to one of the neatest of the plank cottages, which stood on the highest ridge of the island, so that from the front windows it commanded a view of the great blue ocean with its breakers that fringed the reef as with a ring of snow, while, on the opposite side, lay the peaceful waters and islets of the lagoon.  A shout of joyful surprise was uttered by several boys and girls at sight of the captain, for during his former visit he had won their hearts by telling them wild stories of the sea, one-half of each story being founded on fact and personal experience, the other half on a vivid imagination!  \"We are rejoiced to see you,\" said the mother of the juveniles, a stout woman of mixed nationality--that of Dutch apparently predominating.  She spoke English, however, remarkably well, as did many of the Cocos people, though Malay is the language of most of them.  The boys and girls soon hauled the captain down on a seat and began to urge him to tell them stories, using a style of English that was by no means equal to that of the mother.  \"Stop, stop, let me see sister Kathy first.  I can't begin without her. Where is she?\"  \"Somewhere, I s'pose,\" said the eldest boy.  \"No doubt of that.  Go--fetch her,\" returned the captain.  At that moment a back-door opened, and a girl of about seventeen years of age entered.  She was pleasant-looking rather than pretty--tall, graceful, and with magnificent black eyes.  \"Here she comes,\" cried the captain, rising and kissing her.  \"Why, Kathy, how you've grown since I saw you last!  Quite a woman, I declare!\"  Kathy was not too much of a woman, however, to join her brothers and sisters in forcing the captain into a seat and demanding a story on the spot.  \"Stop, stop!\" cried the captain, grasping round their waists a small boy and girl who had already clambered on his knees.  \"Let me inquire about my old friends first--and let me introduce my son to you--you've taken no notice of _him_ yet!  That's not hospitable.\"  All eyes were turned at once on Nigel, some boldly, others with a shy inquiring look, as though to say, \"Can _you_ tell stories?\"  \"Come, now,\" said Nigel, advancing, \"Since you are all so fond of my father, I must shake hands with you all round.\"  The hearty way in which this was done at once put the children at their ease.  They admitted him, as it were, into their circle, and then turning again to the captain continued their clamour for a story.  \"No, no--about old friends first.  How--how's old mother Morris?\"  \"Quite well,\" they shouted.  \"Fatterer than ever,\" added an urchin, who in England would have been styled cheeky.  \"Yes,\" lisped a very little girl; \"one of 'e doors in 'e house too small for she.\"  \"Why, Gerchin, you've learned to speak English like the rest,\" said the captain.  \"Yes, father make every one learn.\"  \"Well, now,\" continued the captain, \"what about Black Sam?\"  \"Gone to Batavia,\" chorused the children.  \"And--and--what's-'is-name?--the man wi' the nose--\"  A burst of laughter and, \"We's _all_ got noses here!\" was the reply.  \"Yes, but you know who I mean--the short man wi' the--\"  \"Oh! with the turned _up_ nose.  _I_ know,\" cried the cheeky boy; \"you means Johnson?  He hoed away nobody know whar'.\"  \"And little Kelly Drew, what of her?\"  A sudden silence fell on the group, and solemn eyes were turned on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23372"],["title","The Buffalo Runners: A Tale of the Red River Plains (#1)"],["body","seated beside him calmly smoking a shorter pipe with obvious enjoyment.  The man was a Canadian half-breed.  His wife was an Indian woman.  They were both moderately young and well matched, for they thoroughly agreed in everything conceivable--or otherwise.  In the length and breadth of the Settlement there could not have been found a lazier or more good-natured or good-for-nothing couple than La Certe and his spouse. Love was, if we may venture to say so, the chief element in the character of each.  Love of self was the foundation.  Then, happily, love of each other came next.  Rising gracefully, the superstructure may be described as, love of tobacco, love of tea, love of ease, and love of general comfort, finishing off with a top-dressing, or capital, of pronounced, decided, and apparently incurable love of indolence.  They had only one clear and unmistakable hatred about them, and that was the hatred of work.  They had a child about four years of age which was like-minded--and not unlike-bodied.  In the wilderness, as in the city, such individuals are well-known by the similarity of their characteristics.  It is not that they can't work, but they won't work--though, of course, if taxed with this disposition they would disclaim it with mild indignation, or an expression of hurt remonstrance, for they are almost too lazy to become enraged.  \"Take life easy, or, if we can't take it easy, let us take it as easy as we can,\" is, or ought to be, their motto.  In low life at home they slouch and smile.  In high life they saunter and affect easy-going urbanity--slightly mingled with mild superiority to things in general.  Whatever rank of life they belong to they lay themselves out with persistent resolution to do as little work as they can; to make other people do as much work for them as possible; to get out of life as much of enjoyment as may be attainable--consistently, of course, with the incurable indolence--and, to put off as long as may be the evil day which, they perceive or suspect, must inevitably be coming.  The curious thing about this race of beings is, that, whether in high or low station, they are never ashamed of themselves--or of their position as drones in the world's hive.  They seem rather to apologise for their degradation as a thing inevitable, for which they are not accountable-- and sometimes, in the case of the rich, as a thing justifiable.  \"I'm glad I did not go to the plains this fall,\" said La Certe, stirring the logs on the fire with his toe and emitting a prolonged sigh of mingled smoke and contentment, while a blast from the bleak nor'-west shook every blackened rafter in his little hut.  \"Heel hee!\" responded his wife, whose Indian name--translated--was Slowfoot, and might have been Slowtongue with equal propriety, for she was quite an adept at the art of silence.  She frequently caused a giggle to do duty for speech.  This suited her husband admirably, for he was fond of talking--could tell a good story, sing a good song, and express his feelings in a good hearty laugh.  \"Yes, it will be hard for the poor boys who have gone to the plains, the weather is so awful, to say nothing of the women.\"  \"Ho,\" replied Slowfoot--though what she meant to express by this no mortal knows--nor, perhaps, cares.  It meant nothing bad, however, for she smiled seraphically and sent forth a stream of smoke, which, mingling with that just emitted by her husband, rose in a curling harmony to the roof.  Slowfoot was not a bad-looking woman as North American Indians go.  She was brown unquestionably, and dirty without doubt, but she had a pleasant expression, suggestive of general good-will, and in the budding period of life must have been even pretty.  She was evidently older than her husband, who might, perhaps, have been a little over thirty.  \"I should not wonder,\" continued La Certe, \"if the buffalo was drove away, and the people starved this year.  But the buffalo, perhaps, will return in time to save them.\"  \"Hm!\" responded the wife, helping herself to some very strong tea, which she poured out of a tin kettle into a tin mug and sweetened with maple sugar.  \"Do you know if Cloudbrow went with them?\" asked the half-breed, pushing forward his mug for a supply of the cheering beverage.  \"No, he stopped in his house,\" replied the woman, rousing herself for a moment to the conversational point, but relapsing immediately.  The man spoke in patois French, the woman in her native Cree language. For convenience we translate their conversation as near as may be into the English in which they were wont to converse with the Scotch settlers who, some time before, had been sent out by the Earl of Selkirk to colonise that remote part of the northern wilderness.  La Certe's father was a French Canadian, his mother an Indian woman, but both having died while he was yet a boy he had been brought or left to grow up under the care of an English woman who had followed the fortunes of the La Certe family.  His early companions had been half-breeds and Indians.  Hence he could speak the English, French, and Indian languages with equal incorrectness and facility.  \"You don't like Cloudbrow,\" remarked the man with an inquiring glance over the rim of his mug.  \"Why you not like him?\"  \"Hee! hee!\" was Slowfoot's lucid reply.  Then, with an unwonted frown on her mild visage, she added with emphasis--  \"No!  I _not_ like him.\"  \"I know that,\" returned the husband, setting down his mug and resuming his pipe, \"but why?\"  To this the lady answered with a sound too brief to spell, and the gentleman, being accustomed to his wife's little eccentricities, broke into a hilarious laugh, and assured her that Cloudbrow was not a bad fellow--a capital hunter and worthy of more regard than she was aware of.  \"For,\" said he, \"Cloudbrow is willing to wait till spring for payment of the horse an' cart I hired from him last year.  You know that I could not pay him till I go to the plains an' get another load of meat an' leather.  You will go with me, Slowfoot, an' we will have grand times of it with buffalo-humps an' marrow bones, an' tea an' tobacco.  Ah! it makes my mouth water.  Give me more tea.  So.  That will do.  What a noise the wind makes!  I hopes it won't blow over the shed an' kill the horse.  But if it do I cannot help that.  Cloudbrow could not ask me to pay for what the wind does.\"  There came another gust of such violence, as he spoke, that even Slowfoot's benignant expression changed to a momentary glance of anxiety, for the shingles on the roof rattled, and the rafters creaked as if the hut were groaning under the strain.  It passed, however, and the pair went on smoking with placid contentment, for they had but recently had a \"square\" meal of pemmican and flour.  This compost when cooked in a frying-pan is exceedingly rich and satisfying--not to say heavy--food, but it does not incommode such as La Certe and his wife.  It even made the latter feel amiably disposed to Cloudbrow.  This _sobriquet_ had been given by the half-breeds to a young Scotch settler named Duncan McKay, in consequence of the dark frown which had settled habitually on his brow--the result of bad temper and unbridled passion.  He was younger brother to that Fergus who has already been introduced to the reader.  Having been partially trained, while in Scotland, away from the small farm-house of his father, and having received a better education, Duncan conceived himself to stand on a higher level than the sedate and uneducated Fergus.  Thus pride was added to his bad temper.  But he was not altogether destitute of good points.  What man is?  One of these was a certain reckless open-handedness, so that he was easily imposed on by the protestations and assurances of the sly, plausible, and lazy La Certe.  The couple were still engaged in smoking, quaffing tea, and other intellectual pursuits, when they heard sounds outside as of some one approaching.  Another moment, and the door burst open, and a man in white stepped in.  He saluted them with a familiar and hasty \"_bonjour_,\" as he stamped and beat the snow vigorously from his garments.  \"What?  Antoine Dechamp!\" exclaimed La Certe, rising slowly to welcome his friend; \"you seem in hurry?\"  \"Ay--in great hurry!  They are starving on the plains!  Many are dead! Davidson has come in!  He is more than half-dead!  Can hardly tell the news!  Drops asleep when he is speaking!  Luckily I met him when going home in my cariole!  Okematan, the Indian, was with me.  So he got out, and said he would pilot Davidson safe home!  He said something about Fergus McKay, which I could not understand, so I have come on, and will drive to Fort Garry with the news!  But my horse has broke down!  Is yours in the stable?\"  Dechamp was a sturdy young half-breed and an old playmate of La Certe. He spoke with obvious impatience at the delay caused by having so much to tell.  \"Is your horse in the stable?\" he demanded sharply a second time, while his friend began, with exasperating composure, to assure him that it was, but that the horse was not his.  \"Cloudbrow is its owner,\" he said, \"and you know if anything happens to it he will ---.  Stay, I will get you lantern--\"  He stopped, for Dechamp, observing a large key hanging on the wall, had seized it and rushed out of the hut without waiting for a lantern.  \"Strange, how easy some men get into a fuss!\" remarked La Certe to his surprised, but quiet, spouse as he lighted a large tin lantern, and went to the door.  Looking out with an expression of discomfort, he put on his cap, and prepared to face the storm in the cause of humanity.  He held the lantern high up first, however, and peered under it as if to observe the full extent of the discomfort before braving it.  Just then a furious gust blew out the light.  \"Ha!  I expected that,\" he said, with a sigh that was strongly suggestive of relief, as he returned to the fire to relight the lantern.  On going the second time to the"]]]
