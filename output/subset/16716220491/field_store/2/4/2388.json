There was only the remnant of the shattered bush between the two; the buffalo stood for a few seconds eyeing him furiously, the blood streaming down its face from a bullet-hole between the two eyes, and its head garnished with a torn mass of the bush.  Again it charged, and again Tom, unable to get a favourable chance for his second barrel, leaped aside and evaded it with difficulty.  The bush was now trampled down, and scarcely formed a shadow of a screen between them; nevertheless Tom stood his ground, hoping to get a shot at the bull's side, and never for a single instant taking his eye off him.  Once more he charged, and again our hero escaped.  He did not venture, however, to stand another, but turned and fled, closely followed by the infuriated animal.  A few yards in front the path turned at almost right angles.  Tom thought he felt the hot breath of his pursuer on his neck as he doubled actively round the corner.  His enemy could neither diverge from nor check his onward career; right through a fearfully tangled thicket he went, and broke into the open beyond, carrying an immense pile of rubbish on his horns.  Tom instantly threw himself on his back in the thicket to avoid being seen, and hoped that his native followers would now attract the bull's attention, but not one of them made his appearance, so he started up, and just as the disappointed animal had broken away over the plain, going straight from him, he gave him the second barrel, and hit him high up on the last rib on the off side, in front of the hip.  He threw up his tail, made a tremendous bound in the air, dashed through bush-thorns so dense and close that it seemed perfectly marvellous how he managed it, and fell dead within two hundred yards.  Note.  If the reader should desire fuller accounts of such battles, we recommend to him _African Hunting_, a very interesting work, by W.C. Baldwin, Esquire, to whom, with Dr Livingstone, Du Chaillu, and others, I am indebted for most of the information contained in this volume,-- R.M.B.  The moment it fell the natives descended from the different trees in which they had taken refuge at the commencement of the fray, and were lavish in their compliments; but Tom, who felt that he had been deserted in the hour of need, did not receive these very graciously, and there is no saying how far he might have proceeded in rebuking his followers (for the Brown family is pugnacious under provocation) had not the major's voice been heard in the distance, shouting, \"Hallo! look out! a buffalo! where are you, Tom Brown, Wilkins?\"  \"Hallo!\" he added, bursting suddenly into the open where they were standing, \"what's this--a--buffalo? dead!  Have 'ee killed him? why, I saw him alive not two minutes--\"  His speech was cut short by a loud roar, as the buffalo he had been in chase of, scared by the approach of Wilkins, burst through the underwood and charged down on the whole party.  They fled right and left, but as the brute passed, Wilkins, from the other side of the open, fired at it and put a ball in just behind the shoulder-blade.  It did not fall, however, and the three hunters ran after it at full speed, Wilkins leading, Tom Brown next, and the major last.  The natives kept well out of harm's way on either side; not that they were unusually timid fellows, but they probably felt that where such able hands were at work it was unnecessary for them to interfere!  As the major went racing clumsily along--for he was what may be called an ill-jointed man, nevertheless as bold as a lion and a capital shot-- he heard a clatter of hoofs behind him, and, looking over his shoulder, observed another buffalo in full career behind.  He stopped instantly, took quick aim at the animal's breast, and fired, but apparently without effect.  There chanced to be a forked tree close at hand, to which the major rushed and scrambled up with amazing rapidity.  He was knocked out of it again quite as quickly by the shock of the tremendous charge made by the buffalo, which almost split its skull, and rolled over dead at the tree-root, shot right through the heart.  Meanwhile Tom Brown and the lieutenant had overtaken and killed the other animal, so that they returned to camp well laden with the best part of the meat of three buffaloes.  Here, while resting after the toils of the day, beside the roaring camp-fires, and eating their well-earned supper, Hicks the trader told them that a native had brought news of a desperate attack by lions on a kraal not more than a day's journey from where they lay.  \"It's not far out o' the road,\" said Hicks, who was a white man--of what country no one knew--with a skin so weather-beaten by constant exposure that it was more like leather than flesh; \"if you want some sport in that way, I'd advise 'ee to go there to-morrow.\"  \"Want some sport in that way!\" echoed Wilkins in an excited tone; \"why, what do you suppose we came here for?  _Of course_ we'll go there at once; that is, if my comrades have no objection.\"  \"With all my heart,\" said the major with a smile as he carefully filled his beloved pipe.  Tom Brown said nothing; but he smoked his pipe quietly, and nodded his head gently, and felt a slight but decided swelling of the heart, as he murmured inwardly to himself, \"Yes, I'll have a slap at the lions to-morrow.\"    CHAPTER THREE.  IN WHICH GREAT DEEDS ARE DONE, AND TOM BROWN HAS A NARROW ESCAPE.  But Tom was wrong.  Either the report had been false, or the lions had a special intimation that certain destruction approached them; for our hunters waited two nights at the native kraal without seeing one, although the black king thereof stoutly affirmed that they had attacked the cattle enclosures nearly every night for a week past, and committed great havoc.  One piece of good fortune, however, attended them, which was that they unexpectedly met with the large party which the major had expressed his wish to join.  It consisted of about thirty men, four of whom were sportsmen, and the rest natives, with about twenty women and children, twelve horses, seventy oxen, five wagons, and a few dogs; all under the leadership of a trader named Hardy.  Numerous though the oxen were, there were not too many of them, as the reader may easily believe when we tell him that the wagons were very large, clumsy, and heavily laden,--one of them, besides other things, carrying a small boat--and that it occasionally required the powers of twenty oxen to drag one wagon up some of the bad hills they encountered on the journey to the Zulu country.  The four sportsmen, who were named respectively Pearson, Ogilvie, Anson, and Brand, were overjoyed at the addition to the party of Tom Brown and his companions, the more so that Tom was a doctor, for the constitutions of two of them, Ogilvie and Anson, had proved to be scarcely capable of withstanding the evil effects of the climate.  Tom prescribed for them so successfully that they soon regained their strength; a result which he believed, however, was fully as much due to the cheering effects of the addition to their social circle as to medicine.  Having rested at the kraal a few days, partly to recruit the travellers, and partly to give the lions an opportunity of returning and being shot, the whole band set forth on their journey to the Umveloose river, having previously rendered the king of the kraal and his subjects happy by a liberal present of beads, brass wire, blue calico, and blankets.  At the kraal they had procured a large quantity of provisions for the journey--amobella meal for porridge, mealies, rice, beans, potatoes, and water-melons; and, while there, they had enjoyed the luxury of as much milk as they could drink; so that all the party were in pretty good condition and excellent spirits when they left.  But this did not last very long, for the weather suddenly changed, and rain fell in immense quantities.  The long rank grass of those regions became so saturated that it was impossible to keep one's-self dry; and, to add to their discomforts, mosquitoes increased in numbers to such an extent that some of the European travellers could scarcely obtain a wink of sleep.  \"Oh dear!\" groaned poor Wilkins, one night as he lay between the major and Tom Brown on the wet grass under the shelter of a bullock-wagon covered with a wet blanket; \"how I wish that the first mosquito had never been born!\"  \"If the world could get on without rain,\" growled the major, \"my felicity would be complete.  There is a particular stream which courses down the underside of the right shaft of the wagon, and meets with some obstruction just at the point which causes it to pour continuously down my neck.  I've shifted my position twice, but it appears to follow me, and I have had sensations for the last quarter of an hour which induce me to believe that a rivulet is bridged by the small of my back.  Ha! have you killed him this time?\"  The latter remark was addressed to Tom Brown, who had for some time past been vigorously engaged slapping his own face in the vain hope of slaying his tormentors--vain, not only because they were too quick to be caught in that way, but also, because, if slain by hundreds at every blow, there would still have remained thousands more to come on!  \"No,\" replied Tom, with a touch of bitterness in his tone; \"he's not dead yet.\"  \"He?\" exclaimed Wilkins; \"do you mean to say that you are troubled by only _one_ of the vile creatures?\"  \"Oh no!\" said Tom; \"there are millions of 'em humming viciously round my head at this moment, but one of them is so big and assiduous that I have come to recognise his voice--there! d'you hear it?\"  \"Hear it!\" cried Wilkins; \"how can you expect me to hear one of yours when I am engaged with a host of my own?  Ah! but I hear _that_,\" he added, laughing, as another tremendous crack resounded from Tom Brown's cheek; \"what a tough skin you must"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21740"],["title","The Iron Horse (#1)"],["body","the setting sun over a winter fog-bank.  Hark?  A rumble in the far distance--ominous and low at first, but rapidly increasing to the tones of distant thunder.  It is the night express for the North--going at fifty miles an hour.  At such a rate of speed it might go right round the world in twenty-one days!  While yet distant the whistle is heard, shrill, threatening, and prolonged. Louder and louder; it is nearing the curve now and the earth trembles-- the house trembles too, but Gertie's parted lips breathe as softly as before; baby's eyes are as tight and his entire frame as still as when he first fell asleep.  Mrs Marrot, too, maintains the monotony of her snore.  Round the curve it comes at last, hammer and tongs, thundering like Olympus, and yelling like an iron fiend.  The earthquake is \"on!\" The embankment shudders; the house quivers; the doors, windows, cups, saucers, and pans rattle.  Outside, all the sledge-hammers and anvils in Vulcan's smithy are banging an _obbligato_ accompaniment to the hissing of all the serpents that Saint Patrick drove out of Ireland as the express comes up; still Gertie's rest is unbroken.  She does indeed give a slight smile and turn her head on the other side, as if she had heard a pleasant whisper, but nothing more.  Baby, too, vents a prolonged sigh before plunging into a profounder depth of repose.  Mrs Marrot gives a deprecatory grunt between snores, but it is merely a complimentary \"Hallo! 's that you?\" sort of question which requires no answer.  As the rushing storm goes by a timid and wakeful passenger happens to lower the window and look out.  He sees the house.  \"It's all over?\" are his last words as he falls back in his seat and covers his face with his hands.  He soon breathes more freely on finding that it is not all over, but fifteen or twenty miles lie between him and the house he expected to annihilate, before his nervous system has quite recovered its tone.  This, reader, is a mere sample of the visitations by which that family was perpetually affected, though not afflicted.  Sometimes the rushing masses were heavy goods trains, which produced less fuss, but more of earthquake.  At other times red lights, intimating equally danger and delay, brought trains to a stand close to the house, and kept them hissing and yelling there as if querulously impatient to get on.  The uproar reached its culminating point about 12:45, on the night of which we write, when two trains from opposite directions were signalled to wait, which they did precisely opposite John Marrot's windows, and there kept up such a riot of sound as feeble language is impotent to convey. To the accustomed ears the whistle and clank of a checked and angry pilot-engine might have been discerned amid the hullabaloo; but to one whose experience in such matters was small, it might have seemed as though six or seven mad engines were sitting up on end, like monster rabbits on a bank, pawing the air and screaming out their hearts in the wild delirium of unlimited power and ungovernable fury.  Still, although they moved a little, the sleepers did not awake--so potent is the force of habit!  However, it did not last long.  The red lights removed their ban, the white lights said \"Come on,\" the monster rabbits gave a final snort of satisfaction and went away--each with its tail of live-stock, or minerals, or goods, or human beings, trailing behind it.  The temporary silence round the house was very intense, as may well be believed--so much so that the heavy foot-fall of a man in the bypath that led to it sounded quite intrusive.  He was a tall broad-shouldered man in a large pilot coat, cap and boots, and appeared to walk somewhat lame as he approached the door.  He tried the handle.  It was locked, of course.  \"I thought so,\" he muttered in a low bass voice; \"so much for a bad memory.\"  He rapped twice on the door, loudly, with his knuckles and then kicked it with his boot.  Vain hope!  If a burglar with a sledge-hammer had driven the door in, he would have failed to tickle the drum of any ear there.  The man evidently was aware of this, for, changing his plan, he went round to a back window on the ground-floor, and opened it at the top with some difficulty.  Peeping in he gazed for some time intently, and then exclaimed under his breath, \"Ha! it's open by good luck.\" Gathering a handful of gravel, he threw it into the house with considerable force.  The result proved that he had not aimed at random, for the shower entered the open door of Nanny's sleeping-cellar and fell smartly on her face.  It is well-known that sailors, although capable of slumbering through loud and continuous noises, can be awakened by the slightest touch, so likewise Nanny.  On receiving the shower of gravel she incontinently buried her head in the blankets, drew an empty coal-scuttle over her shoulders and began to shout thieves! and murder! at the top of her voice.  Having taken such pains to muffle it, of course no one heard her cries.  The man, if a burglar, had evidently a patient philosophical turn of mind, for he calmly waited till the damsel was exhausted, and when she at length peeped out to observe the effect of her heroic efforts at self-preservation he said quietly, \"Nanny, lass, don't be a fool!  It's me; open the door; I've gone an' forgot my latch-key.\"  \"Oh la! master, it ain't you, is it?  It ain't thieves and robbers, is it?\"  \"No, no.  Open the door like a good girl.\"  \"And it ain't an accident, is it?\" continued Nanny partially dressing in haste.  \"Oh, I knows it's a accident, Missus always prophesied as a accident would come to pass some day, which has come true.  You're not maimed, master?\"  \"No, no; be quick, girl!\"  \"Nor Willum ain't maimed, is he?  He ain't dead?  Oh _don't_ say Willum is--\"  \"Bill Garvie's all right,\" said the engine-driver, as he brushed past the girl and went up-stairs.  Now, although Mrs Marrot's ears were totally deaf to locomotives they were alert enough to the sound of her husband's voice.  When, therefore, he entered the kitchen, he found her standing on the floor with an ample shawl thrown round her.  \"Nothing wrong?\" she inquired anxiously.  \"Nothing, Molly, my dear, only I got a slight bruise on the leg in the engine-shed to-day, and I had to go up an' show it to the doctor, d'ye see, before comin' home, which has made me later than usual.\"  \"Are you _sure_ it's not a back hurt, father?\" asked Loo, coming in at the moment--also enveloped in a shawl, and looking anxious.  \"Sure? ay, I'm sure enough; it's only a scratch.  See here.\"  Saying this he removed one of his boots, and pulling up his trousers displayed a bandaged leg.  \"Well, but we can't see through the bandages, you know,\" said Mrs Marrot.  \"Let me take them off, father, and I'll replace--\"  \"Take 'em off!\" exclaimed John, pulling down the leg of his trouser and rising with a laugh.  \"No, no, Loo; why, it's only just bin done up all snug by the doctor, who'd kick up a pretty shindy if he found I had undid it.  There's one good will come of it anyhow, I shall have a day or two in the house with you all; for the doctor said I must give it a short rest.  So, off to bed again, Loo.  This is not an hour for a respectable young woman to be wanderin' about in her night-dress.  Away with you!\"  \"Was any one else hurt, father?\" said Loo.  She asked the question anxiously, but there was a slight flush on her cheek and a peculiar smile which betrayed some hidden feeling.  \"No one else,\" returned her father.  \"I tell 'ee it wasn't an accident at all--it was only a engine that brushed up agin me as I was comin' out o' the shed.  That's all; so I just came home and left Will Garvie to look after our engine.  There, run away.\"  Loo smiled, nodded and disappeared, followed by Mrs Marrot, who went, like a sensible woman, to see that her alarmed domestic was all right. While she was away John went to the crib and kissed the rosy cheek of his sleeping boy.  Then he bent over the bed with the white dimity curtains to Miss Gertie's forehead, for which purpose he had to remove a mass of curly hair with his big brown hand.  \"Bless you, my darling,\" he said in silent speech, \"you came near bein' fatherless this night--nearer than you ever was before.\"  He kissed her again tenderly, and a fervent \"thank the Lord!\" rose from his heart to heaven.  In less than half-an-hour after this the engine-driver's family sank into profound repose, serenaded by the music of a mineral train from the black country, which rushed laboriously past their dwelling like an over-weighted thunderbolt.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE DRIVER VISITS A LITTLE ELDERLY GENTLEWOMAN AND PREPARES THE IRON HORSE FOR ACTION.  Next day John Marrot spent the brief period of repose accorded by the doctor to his leg in romping about the house with the baby in his arms. Being a large man, accustomed to much elbow-room and rapid motion, and the house being small, John may be said to have been a dangerous character in the family on such occasions.  Apart from baby, no elephant was ever more sluggish in his motions; but when coupled--professionally speaking--to his own tender infant, John knew no bounds, his wife knew no rest and his baby knew no higher earthly bliss.  Sometimes it was on his shoulder, sometimes on his head and often on his foot, riding with railway speed to \"Banbury Cross.\"  Again it was on its back in the crib or on the bed being tickled into fits of laughter, which bid fair at times to merge into fits of convulsion, to the horror of little Gertie, who came in for a large share of that delightful holiday's enjoyment, but whose spirit was frequently harrowed with alarm at the riotous conduct of her invalid father.  In his glee the man might have been compared to a locomotive with a bad driver, who was constantly shutting off the steam and clapping on the brakes too soon or too late, thus either falling short of or overshooting his mark.
