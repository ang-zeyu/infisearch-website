As for the fireman he took a novel way of making his escape, by diving into the shelving bank of coal and letting it slide over him. In the excitement of the flurry of firing he was able to do this.  Jim and Ketchel both leaped from the same side of the engine and were protected by a slight cut alongside of the track. Bullets whirred and cut into the dirt around them. As they ran both of them sent a shot at the man on the near side of the blind baggage, with such good effect that he pitched to the ground with an injured leg.  \"Duck low, Jim,\" yelled the engineer; \"we will beat them yet. I've got a scheme.\"  \"I'm with you,\" replied Jim.  This was literally true, for he was right at the heels of the scurrying Bob. As they passed the barricade of stones, Ketchel gave it a quick, searching look, then in a few strides they got to cover in a culvert a number of yards in front of the pile of stone. By the help of a few ties they made a respectable fort.  \"So far, so well,\" said Ketchel, \"but it won't do to stay here very long, for they will loot the train.\"  \"Nearly the whole gang is down there,\" cried Jim, \"I can tell by the firing.\"  \"We've got to clear that barricade off the track and quick, too,\" declared the engineer. \"It's our only hope.\"  \"Those stones are pretty heavy to lift off under fire,\" said Jim composedly, \"but I guess we can make a go of it.\"  \"I like your nerve,\" said Ketchel, a gleam of admiration showing for an instant in his usually noncommittal face, \"but I've got something here, that will help us in this hoisting business,\" and he thrust his hand into one of the pockets of his overalls.  \"What is it?\" queried Jim.  \"Dynamite,\" replied the engineer, producing a small chunk of the same to view.  \"Won't it blow up the engine, too?\" asked Jim.  \"Not likely with this amount,\" said Ketchel. \"We will have to chance it anyhow.\"  \"Ain't you afraid that you might take a chaw on it, by mistake for your tobacco?\" queried Jim in a matter-of-fact voice. Bob Ketchel only grinned by way of reply.  \"Now is our chance,\" whispered the engineer; \"keep the beggars lying low while I start the fireworks.\"  \"I'll attend to that,\" replied Jim briefly and with emphasis.  Then two crouching figures slipped out from the culvert, and Jim kept on the move with the quick dodging motions of a boxer so that the enemy in ambush could not get a bead on him. Flashing the fire of his revolver this side and that at a cluster of rock, or a clump of bushes he dodged on, and such was his accuracy that not a man in the attacking party dared show himself in the open.  Jim was able to keep down their fire, as his ally rushed to the barricade; then Ketchel stooped down and thrust the dynamite into an opening between the rocks and drawing off quickly threw himself flat down by the track. Then there came an upheaval that shook things. A geyser of rocks shot into the air, and in a jiffy Jim and the engineer had cleared off what remained on the track in the shape of debris. The engine itself had most of the cowcatcher torn off and the headlight smashed.  \"Spoiled her beauty for you,\" said Jim. \"But we will spoil their game I guess, and I don't think the railroad company will complain at the loss of a cowcatcher.\" Meantime both had raced back to the engine.  Before the gang had time to fully realize what had happened, Ketchel had regained his place in the cab and had turned the engine loose on the sanded rails. Within a remarkably short distance he had her full speed ahead, with a parting salute of shots from the enraged and baffled \"hold ups.\"  \"There goes three of 'em,\" cried Jim, who had swung aboard. \"My what a jump.\"  They shot from the rear of the train like projectiles from a catapult, rolling over and over down a steep embankment. Two got up very slowly but the third lay as if dead.  \"Where's Sheehan?\" cried the engineer; \"we haven't lost him I hope.\"  \"Gosh! he's in the coal!\" exclaimed Jim.  He leaped into the tender and saw a movement under the coal. Working frantically, Jim was able to drag their submerged ally from the retreat that had almost buried him. The cold air brought him to, and he rose staggeringly to his feet.  \"Yer started your thrain too suddint, Mr. Ketchel, and pulled two ton of coal over my poor head,\" cried the fireman in half humorous indignation. \"Why didn't you whistle and give me fair warning as to your intentions. And how did you lads escape without bullets in your hides. Yer must have charmed lives the both of you.\"  \"How many of 'em did you get, Bill,\" yelled back the engineer from his cab.  \"Aye, there is many of them that will carry black marks the rest of their lives, where I handed them some chunks of coal.\"  \"The company will take it out of your salary for wasting their coal,\" remarked Ketchel.  \"And shure and they ain't none too good to do it,\" remarked Bill Sheehan with conviction.  \"Get in, Bill, and throw what coal you have got left into that boiler; we have got to make the siding this side of the Divide to get out of the way of 'The Eastern Express.' That little fracas back there cost us fifteen minutes.\"  \"And half a ton of coal,\" said the fireman, as he bent his back to the work of shoveling, looking for all the world like a black gnome.  \"I wonder what has happened to the passengers,\" said Jim to the engineer; \"there seemed to be a lot going on back there the last five minutes of the fight.\"  \"I can't slow up, Jim,\" responded the engineer, \"because we have got to make that siding.\"  \"I don't expect you to, Bob,\" replied Jim, \"I'll go over the roofs. I can make it if those open air burglars did.\"  \"It's durn risky,\" warned the engineer; \"we are speeding now, and the train is twisting so it will sure throw you on some of the curves.\"  \"I've ridden a few bronchos in my time,\" declared Jim, \"and been aloft in some heavy seas and I guess I can manage this.\"  Self-confidence is all right but pride often goes before destruction and Jim came very near getting his on this occasion.  \"And where do you think you are going, lad?\" asked Bill Sheehan, as Jim started on his climb over the tender.  \"I'm going back to see how many of the passengers have been scared to death and why some of those guys in the sleepers didn't turn out and help us to fight off those bandits back there.\"  \"Oh, them are tenderfeet from way back the other side of the range, they was too busy hiding behind their women folks to fight,\" declared the fireman, \"but you ain't going on no such trip young feller.\" He made a dive for Jim but that worthy was not to be detained and was half way up the little iron ladder before Bill Sheehan had recovered his balance. \"Come back,\" he cried, poising a bit of coal in his hand, \"or I'll bring you back.\" This bluff did not disturb Jim who was now on top of the baggage car.  \"Just like a young limb,\" he muttered, as he watched the daring James. \"I'd have done the same twenty years ago.\"  Jim crawled or sneaked his way along the elevated part of the roof, so that he could clutch one side or the other in case of need. The train was now winding through a narrow gulch in a line of hills and a fierce wind tore at his body as though trying to fling him loose. He felt that it was more than he had bargained for, as the grimy roof slipped this way and that under him, then there came a sudden lurch and he was lifted clear off the top of the car and one hand was wrenched loose, and in a second his feet were hanging over the side.  His other hand caught the steel rod that opens one of the small windows in the elevated roof of the car. Would it hold? On its strength depended his only chance of life. He drew himself up slowly with every ounce of his strength. The rod bent but held and once more he was back on the roof. So he took his perilous way along and at last he reached the foreward coach. The door was guarded and he came near being shot by the suspicious conductor, who took him for one of the bandits.     CHAPTER IV  THE GIRL AND THE ENGINEER   Indeed Jim's appearance was much against him. He was covered with dirt and grime and coal dust. It was only by holding his ticket against the pane of glass in the door of the coach, that the conductor was made willing to admit him. But when he was informed who Jim was he treated him with due respect and even cordiality. That was pretty good for a conductor in those days.  Jim was an object of interest as he passed through the coach. He might have blushed at finding himself a hero, but if so he was perfectly disguised by his temporary color, which was decidedly dusky.  \"Oh, Mamma,\" cried a youngster, \"I'm afraid of that big black man. Will he steal me!\"  \"Nonsense, Willie, that's the nice, kind gentleman, who gave you some candy at the station yesterday.\" Jim laughed and the only show of white about him was his teeth. \"I don't blame the little chap for being scared,\" he said, \"I'm a bad looking object for a fact.\"  \"You ought to have seen three of those fellows jump,\" remarked Mr. Conductor, as they went on their way through the train; \"that was when Bob opened up. I guess one of 'em was badly shook up by the way he lit.\"  \"I saw them take their flying leap,\" returned Jim, \"but was anybody hurt back here?\"  \"The brakeman got it in the shoulder,\" replied the conductor, \"but I guess he will be all right. Have to take a lay-off for some weeks.\"  \"It's curious how many bullets are fired without hurting anybody,\" remarked Jim, \"but I've noticed that before.\"  The conductor looked at the tall young fellow keenly for a moment.  \"I reckon you are no tenderfoot,\" he asserted.  \"Right there!\" replied Jim; \"that is if experience counts. But I was born in the East.\"  \"You can't help that,\" remarked the conductor, to Jim's amusement; \"you would have laughed to see them fellows lying close to the floor of the car, when the shooting was going on. It ain't a dignified sight to see a round fat man trying to make himself small by lying as flat as possible.\" "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20264"],["title","Parsifal: Story and Analysis of Wagner's Great Opera (#1)"],["body","ion. The theater is darkened, the footlights are lowered, the prelude begins.     Act I   The waves of sound rise from the shadowy gulf sunken between the audience and the footlights. Upon the sound ocean of \"wind\" the \"Take, eat,\" or \"Love-feast\" motive floats. Presently the strings pierce through it, the Spear motive follows, and then, full of heavy pain, \"Drink ye all of this,\" followed by the famous Grail motive--an old chorale also used by Mendelssohn in the Reformation Symphony. Then comes the noble Faith and Love theme.  As I sit in the low light, amid the silent throng, and listen, I need no interpreter--I am being placed in possession of the emotional key-notes of the drama. Every subject is first distinctly enunciated, and then all are wondrously blended together. There is the pain of sacrifice--the mental agony, the bodily torture; there are the alternate pauses of Sorrow and respite from sorrow long drawn out, the sharp ache of Sin, the glimpses of unhallowed Joy, the strain of upward Endeavor, the serene peace of Faith and Love, crowned by the blessed Vision of the Grail. 'Tis past. The prelude melts into the opening recitative.  The eyes have now to play their part. The curtain rises, the story begins. The morning breaks slowly, the gray streaks redden, a lovely summer landscape lies bathed in primrose light. Under the shadow of a noble tree, the aged knight. Gurnemanz, has been resting with two young attendants. From the neighboring halls of Montsalvat the solemn _reveillé_--the Grail motive--rings out, and all three sink on their knees in prayer. The sun bursts forth in splendor as the hymn rises to mingle with the voices of universal nature. The waves of sound well up and fill the soul with unspeakable thankfulness and praise.  The talk is of Amfortas, the king, and of his incurable wound. A wild gallop, a rush of sound--and a weird woman, with streaming hair, springs toward the startled group. She bears a phial with rare balsam from the Arabian shores. It is for the king's wound. Who is the wild horsewoman? Kundry--strange creation--a being doomed to wander, like the Wandering Jew, the wild Huntsman, or Flying Dutchman, always seeking a deliverance she can not find--Kundry, who, in ages gone by, met the Savior on the road to Calvary and derided him. Some say she was Herodias's daughter. Now filled with remorse, yet weighted with sinful longings, she serves by turns the Knights of the Grail, then falls under the spell of Klingsor, the evil knight sorcerer, and, in the guise of an enchantress, is compelled by him to seduce, if possible, the Knights of the Grail.  Eternal symbol of the divided allegiance of a woman's soul! She it was who, under the sensual spell, as an incarnation of loveliness, overcame Amfortas, and she it is now who, in her ardent quest for salvation, changed and squalid in appearance, serves the Knights of the Grail, and seeks to heal Amfortas's wound!  No sooner has she delivered her balsam to the faithful Gurnemanz, and thrown herself exhausted upon the grass--where she lies gnawing her hair morosely--than a change in the sound atmosphere, which never ceases to be generated in the mystic orchestral gulf, presages the approach of Amfortas.  He comes, borne on a litter, to his morning bath in the shining lake hard by. Sharp is the pain of the wound--weary and hopeless is the king. Through the Wound-motive comes the sweet woodland music and the breath of the blessed morning, fragrant with flowers and fresh with dew. It is one of those incomparable bursts of woodland notes, full of bird-song and the happy hum of insect life and rustling of netted branches and waving of long tasseled grass. I know of nothing like it save the forest music in _Siegfried_.  The sick king listens, and remembers words of hope and comfort that fell from a heavenly voice, what time the glory of the Grail passed:      \"Durch Mitleid wissend       Der reine Thor,     Harre sein       Den ich erkor.\"      [Wait for my chosen one,     Guileless and innocent,     Pity-enlightened.]  They hand him the phial of balsam; and presently, while the lovely forest music again breaks forth, the king is carried on to his bath, and Kundry, Gurnemanz, and the two esquires hold the stage.  As the old knight, who is a complete repertory of facts connected with the Grail tradition, unfolds to the esquires the nature of the king's wound, the sorceries of Klingsor, the hope of deliverance from some unknown \"guileless one,\" a sudden cry breaks up the situation.  A white swan, pierced by an arrow, flutters dying to the ground. It is the swan beloved of the Grail brotherhood, bird of fair omen, symbol of spotless purity. The slayer is brought in between two knights--a stalwart youth, fearless, unabashed, while the death-music of the swan, the slow distilling and stiffening of its life-blood, is marvelously rendered by the orchestra. Conviction of his fault comes over the youth as he listens to the reproaches of Gurnemanz. He hangs his head ashamed and penitent, and at last, with a sudden passion of remorse, snaps his bow and flings it aside. The swan is borne off, and Parsifal, the \"guileless one\" (for he it is), with Gurnemanz and Kundry--who rouses herself and surveys Parsifal with strange, almost savage curiosity--hold the stage.  In this scene Kundry tells the youth more than he cares to hear about himself: how his father, Gamuret, was a great knight killed in battle; how his mother, Herzeleide (Heart's Affliction), fearing a like fate for her son, brought him up in the lonely forest; how he left her to follow a troop of knights that he met one day winding through the forest glade, and being led on and on in pursuit of them, never overtook them and never returned to his mother, Heart's Affliction, who died of grief. At this point the frantic youth seizes Kundry by the throat in an agony of rage and grief, but is held back by Gurnemanz, till, worn out by the violence of his emotion, he faints away, and is gradually revived by Kundry and Gurnemanz.  Suddenly, Kundry rises with a wild look, like one under a spell. Her mood of service is over. She staggers across the stage--she can hardly keep awake. \"Sleep,\" she mutters, \"I must sleep--sleep!\" and falls down in one of those long trances which apparently last for months, or years, and form the transition periods between her mood of Grail service and the Klingsor slavery into which she must next relapse in spite of herself.  And is this the guileless one? This wild youth who slays the fair swan--who knows not his own name nor whence he comes, nor whither he goes, nor what are his destinies? The old knight eyes him curiously--he will put him to the test. This youth had seen the king pass once--he had marked his pain. Was he \"enlightened by pity\"? Is he the appointed deliverer? The old knight now invites him to the shrine of the Grail. \"What is the Grail?\" asks the youth. Truly a guileless, innocent one! yet a brave and pure knight, since he has known no evil, and so readily repents of a fault committed in ignorance.  Gurnemanz is strangely drawn to him. He shall see the Grail, and in the Holy Palace, what time the mystic light streams forth and the assembled knights bow themselves in prayer, the voice which comforted Amfortas shall speak to his deliverer and bid him arise and heal the king.         *       *       *       *       *  Gurnemanz and Parsifal have ceased to speak. They stand in the glowing light of the summer-land. The tide of music rolls on continuously, but sounds more strange and dreamy.  Is it a cloud passing over the sky? There seems to be a shuddering in the branches--the light fades upon yonder sunny woodlands--the foreground darkens apace. The whole scene is moving, but so slowly that it seems to change like a dissolving view. I see the two figures of Gurnemanz and Parsifal moving through the trees--they are lost behind yonder rock. They emerge farther off--higher up. The air grows very dim; the orchestra peals louder and louder. I lose the two in the deepening twilight. The forest is changing, the land is wild and mountainous. Huge galleries and arcades, rock-hewn, loom through the dim forest; but all is growing dark. I listen to the murmurs of the \"Grail,\" the \"Spear,\" the \"Pain,\" the \"Love and Faith\" motives--hollow murmurs, confused, floating out of the depths of lonely caves. Then I have a feeling of void and darkness, and there comes a sighing as of a soul swooning away in a trance, and a vision of waste places and wild caverns; and then through the confused dream I hear the solemn boom of mighty bells, only muffled. They keep time as to some ghastly march. I strain my eyes into the thick gloom before me. Is it a rock, or forest, or palace?  As the light returns slowly, a hall of more than Alhambralike splendor opens before me. My eyes are riveted on the shining pillars of variegated marble, the tessellated pavements, the vaulted roof glowing with gold and color; beyond, arcades of agate columns, bathed in a misty moonlight air, and lost in a bewildering perspective of halls and corridors.  [Illustration: Copyright, 1903, by Pach Bros., N. Y.  PARSIFAL AND GURNEMANZ PASSING THROUGH THE RAVINE]  I hear the falling of distant water in marble fonts; the large bells of Montsalvat peal louder and louder, and to music of unimaginable stateliness the knights, clad in the blue and red robes of the Grail, enter in solemn procession, and take their seats at two semicircular tables which start like arms to the right and left of the holy shrine. Beneath it lies Titurel entranced, and upon it is presently deposited the sacred treasure of the Grail itself.  As the wounded King Amfortas is borne in, the assembled knights, each standing in his place, a golden cup before him, intone the Grail motive, which is taken up by the entering choruses of servitors and esquires bearing the holy relics.
