The man was speaking violently, then beseechingly, to the stranger, who was in uniform.  \"What is it?\" again demanded Zaidos.  He began to get the run of the conversation, but as he made it out, it was too preposterous to consider.  The officer laid a hand on his shoulder and shook his head.  \"You will _have_ to come,\" he said.  \"YOU ARE WANTED FOR THE ARMY.\"  \"But my father?\" said Zaidos, alarmed.  The man shrugged his shoulders.  \"He will die the same whether you come or not.  Come!\"  A grim look came into the boy's face.  It alarmed the servant.  \"Go, go, master,\" he begged.  \"You do not know.  They take everyone. What is to be must be.  Go, I entreat you, without violence.  I do not want to go and tell your father that I have seen you slain before my eyes.  I will tell him you are here, and that you will come later.\"  He drew back and bowed to the officer, who kept a hand on Zaidos' shoulder.  \"Yes, tell him I will come soon,\" said Zaidos.  \"Go to him quickly.\"  The man turned and hurried away.  \"Give up all thought of going,\" said the officer.  \"It is a pity--one owes a great duty to one's father; but we need you now.  And the need of country comes first.\"  \"But Greece is not in the war!\" said Zaidos as they hurried along the street.  \"No, not yet; but there are places enough to guard, so we need more men than we dreamed.  But I talk too much.  Here is the headquarters.  Let me advise you not to bother the Colonel with demands to visit your home.\"  They entered the big, dingy room of the police station which had been transformed into a sort of recruiting station.  The officer in charge was an overbearing First Lieutenant who was overworked, tired and irritable.  He had come from a distant part of Greece, and the name of Zaidos carried no weight with him.  He shook his head when Zaidos made his request.  He even smiled a little.  \"Too thin, too thin!\" he said. \"I should say that all the mothers and fathers, and most of the uncles and aunts and cousins in the world are ill,\" he sneered.  \"No, you can't go.  Get back there in line and wait for your squad to be outfitted.\"  Zaidos shrugged his shoulders and obeyed, well knowing that, once in uniform, even that display of feeling would be absolutely out of order. He had been too long in a military school to misunderstand military procedure, and he knew that whatever queer chance had placed him in his present position, the thing was done now.  He was to see real fighting.  Zaidos had a lion's heart and was absolutely ignorant of fear, but he worried when he thought of the possible effect on his father.  He, poor man, would feel that his natural wish to behold his only son once more had placed the boy in a position of the gravest danger; indeed, in the path of almost certain death.  What the effect of this knowledge would be on his health, Zaidos trembled to consider.  But he was powerless to avoid the shock to his father, and once more shrugging his shoulders he stepped into line.  After a tedious delay, during which the men and boys who were unaccustomed to any sort of drill shifted uneasily from foot to foot, shuffled, twisted, and fretted generally, while Zaidos alone stood easily at attention, the order was given for the squad to go into another room.  Here they were registered, examined physically, and equipped with uniforms.  Then they were finally taken to the mess hall and provided with a wholesome, plain meal which they proceeded to enjoy to the utmost.  Zaidos could not eat.  He toyed with the food, his quick brain ever planning some way by which he could get to his father.  The more he thought of it the more it seemed to be his duty to do so at _any_ cost.  But he seemed surrounded by barriers.  He could not see a way clear.  So he resigned himself for the present, and marched to the dormitory where his squad was quartered.  It had been a trying and exhausting day for everyone and his peasant companions, accustomed to bed-time at sunset, soon threw themselves down and slept.  The sleeping quarters were on the ground floor.  Zaidos found his pallet behind a great door opening on the street.  It was open a trifle, but a heavy chain secured it from opening any further.  Zaidos stuck his head out.  There was enough space for that.  It was the blackest night he had ever seen, if one could be said to see anything as dark.  A sentry padded up and down in the blackness.  Zaidos smiled.  The man could certainly not see five feet ahead of him.  All the city lights were out for safety's sake.  As he approached, Zaidos drew back, and lay staring at the ceiling.  A stifled sob startled him.  He turned.  On the next pallet a young fellow lay face downward, and muffled his weeping in the coarse blanket.  For an hour Zaidos listened.  The shaken breathing and occasional sobs continued.  Zaidos could stand it no longer.  He reached over and let a friendly clasp fall on the heaving shoulder.  \"What is it?\" he whispered in his best Greek.  The young fellow turned to him eagerly, glad of sympathy.  In a rush of words that made it hard for Zaidos to understand, he whispered his story.  There was a wife and a little, little baby, \"Oh, _so_ little!\" far up on the mountain-side; they would starve; surely, _surely_ they would starve!  They did not know what had become of him.  Zaidos tried in vain to calm the man.  He could not do so and finally dropped into a restless sleep with the man's stifled sobs ringing in his ears.  Zaidos had to concede that the man's fate was a hard one.  He was only nineteen years of age.  The girl-wife was seventeen.  As Zaidos dropped asleep he was reflecting that no doubt nine-tenths of the men sleeping in that room carried burdens as well as the young mountaineer and himself.  He was wakened awhile later by a touch on the shoulder nearest the door.  A voice addressed him.  For a moment Zaidos was unable to locate it.  Then he discovered that it was coming from the partly open door. It was the young husband who had sobbed in the dark.  \"Waken, friend!\" said the low whisper.  \"Waken!  Farewell!  I go! There is a small packet under my pallet.  I forgot it.  Will you hand it quickly before the sentry turns?\"  \"Don't do a fool stunt like that,\" said Zaidos in English.  The deserter repeated, \"Quickly, quickly!\" and as Zaidos handed him the packet he disappeared, the night swallowing him in its blackness. Zaidos crawled to the door and, flat on the floor, put his head out the opening into the street.  All was quiet.  The sentry marched up and down the long block with the dragging slowness of a weary man.  The mountaineer had escaped!  Somewhere a clock struck eleven booming strokes.  Zaidos could not believe that it was so early, but immediately another faint chime verified the first.  Here and there in the room heavy snoring or muttered words sounded.  There were no guards in the room as the door was locked.  Eleven o'clock!  Five hours before daylight.  A daring thought flashed into Zaidos' head.  He knelt and once more leaned through the opening of the door.  He thanked his schoolboy leanness.  There _was_ enough space!  He waited until the sentry's heavy footfall dragged to the end of the block; then with a struggle he twisted through the door and stood in the open, deserted street.  In the years of his absence he had forgotten the city, but he remembered the general directions, and only yesterday he had seen in the distance the gleaming white marble walls of his home standing on the beautiful headland overlooking the blue waters of the bay.  He heard the sentry approaching and, trusting to instinct, turned into the nearest street and hurried away.  It seemed to Zaidos that the journey was endless, yet he went like the wind.  He found himself searching the east for dawn.  His instinct did for him what sight and reason would have failed to do.  In daylight he would have been lost, but in that black darkness he kept his course, and finally the great white building where his fathers for generations had lived loomed mysteriously before him.  He hurried up the broad stairs and besieged the massive doors with heavy blows.  A startled footman opened it, and with a curt word Zaidos entered and demanded his father.  The man bowed and led him up to a closed door.  Here he knocked softly and a stout old woman answered.  She looked hard at the young man in uniform, then with a little cry clasped him in a warm embrace.  It was his old nurse.  \"Ah,\" she cried, \"God has answered my prayers!  You are in time!\"  A chill of apprehension swept over the boy.  \"Is he so ill?\" he asked.  \"He has waited for you,\" she answered.  \"I told him you would come.  I knew it.  He has been dying for many days, but he would not go until he saw you.\"  \"Let me come,\" said Zaidos.  He dashed past the old woman, the nurses and the doctors, and was clasped in his father's arms.     CHAPTER II  AN IMPRESSED SOLDIER  The events of that night long remained in Zaidos' memory, a blurred picture of pain and heart-break.  There was a brief and precious hour with the father whom he had so seldom seen; a time filled with the priceless last communications which seemed to bridge all absence and bring them close, close together at last.  His coming seemed to fill his dying father with a strange new strength.  He talked rationally and earnestly with his beloved son.  Zaidos could not believe that the end was near.  Count Zaidos gave the boy a paper containing a list of the places where the family treasure was put away or concealed.  Also other papers of the greatest value.  Without these he would be unable to prove his heirship to the title and estates of the Zaidos family.  In case of the boy's death all would go to a distant cousin, Velo Kupenol, who had long made his home with the Count.  Zaidos turned to meet this cousin, whom he had not seen for so many years that his existence had been forgotten.  He saw a keen, ferret-faced lad, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21787"],["title","Shelled (#2)"],["body","little older than himself.  He took an instant dislike to the boy, and rebuked himself for doing so.  Yet the hard eyes looked _too_ steadily into his, with a cold, piercing, deadly look.  \"I'm in the way,\" thought Zaidos, as he turned again to his father. And some sure instinct in his heart cried, \"Beware, beware!\"  When the dying Count handed the thin packet of precious papers to his son, Zaidos slipped them in the inner pocket of his blouse.  At that moment Velo approached the bedside.  \"Uncle,\" he said, \"unfortunately my cousin here has been impressed into service.  Would it not be well for _me_ to keep these papers?  I would guard them with my life, and as I do not intend to fight they would be safe with me in any case.\"  The Count frowned.  \"No,\" he cried.  \"Velo Kupenol, I have not found you true to your name!  You have been here with me for years, and I know you through and through.  I have treated you with all patience, have paid your debts, have saved you from disgrace for the sake of the family.  I have forgiven you over and over.  You have not shown me even the loyalty that a true friend would expect, to say nothing of a relative.  If anything happens to my son, unfortunately the estates will be yours; but while he lives, the papers will remain in _his_ possession, to do with as he sees fit.  Ah!\" he cried, turning to his son, \"be worthy of our name, my boy!  No Zaidos has ever yet disgraced it.  I put my trust in you, and I know you will not fail me.  To the day she died, your mother planned great things for her baby boy.  She--\"  He fixed his eyes on space.  A look of surprise and happiness lit his face.  Slowly he raised his arms as though in greeting, then sank back, dead.  Zaidos, kneeling, buried his face in the pillow.  So it was over, all over!  Someone raised him to his feet, as the nurse tenderly drew the sheet over his father's face.  He lifted it and with one last lingering look replaced it gently, then left the room.  The clock struck three.  As he sank wearily in a chair, the old nurse entered.  Her face was stained with tears.  She glanced about, then seized Zaidos by the arm.  \"_Don't trust Velo!_\" she whispered, and left his side.  None too soon, for Velo entered the room and with a gesture dismissed the old servant.  \"Now, Zaidos,\" he said abruptly, \"we will talk.  You are _crazy_ to carry such valuables around with you.  After we have had breakfast, we will decide where to keep those papers.  I am the next in line, as you know, and it is only just that I should know where they are in case you should get in trouble.\"  Zaidos shook his head.  \"I shall keep the papers,\" he said.  \"Of course you may remain here.  I shall always look out for you.  I shall not be killed in this fighting; I feel it.\"  \"So have other men,\" sneered Velo.  \"How did you get away?\"  Zaidos told him.  \"Do you mean that you could not get permission, and that you escaped and came anyhow?\" he asked, an evil gleam lighting his narrow eyes.  \"That's about it,\" said Zaidos, nodding.  \"I must go back at once.  The doctor's car will take me close to the barracks.  I must get there before dawn.\"  He went to the window and looked out.  \"I have no time to waste!\" he cried.  \"But look here, if you are caught, it means desertion,\" said Velo.  \"Yes!\"  \"In war-time that means death,\" said Velo.  \"Yes, but I am not going to be caught,\" answered Zaidos.  \"Then you must hurry,\" declared his cousin.  \"Wait here just a moment, and I will see that the car is ready and get a cloak to cover you.  I almost fear you have waited too long, cousin,\" and hurried, from the room with a last sidelong look at Zaidos' bent head.  Five minutes passed; then with a last look at his father's closed door, Zaidos went down and found Velo standing beside the automobile, talking to the chauffeur.  Already the intense blackness of the night was lifting.  Zaidos felt a chill of apprehension.  \"You will have to hurry,\" said his cousin.  \"I will come down later and look you up.  Hope you get back.\"  He stepped back, and the car shot forward, but only for a short distance.  With a queer grinding noise the engine stopped.  The driver leaped out and examined it with a flashlight.  He uttered an exclamation of dismay.  \"Someone has put sand in the engine!\" he exclaimed.  \"Yet I have been in it all night long!\"  \"You _must_ have left it,\" said Zaidos.  \"Or did you go to sleep?\"  \"Yes, yes!\" stammered the driver excitedly.  \"I was called away just now, when Velo Kupenol sent me to my master to tell him that I was to take you back to barracks.  Ah, what shall we do?\"  \"How far is it?\" demanded Zaidos.  The night was lifting.  He shivered.  \"A mile straight down that avenue, Excellency, until you reach the great fountain in the public square.  Then a half block to the left. You cannot miss it, but you cannot make it before dawn.\"  \"Good-bye!\" called Zaidos.  He started down the wide avenue with the gentle, easy stride that had made him the best long-distance runner in school.  His wind was perfect and he covered ground like a deer; but clearer and clearer as he raced he could see the grey forms of surrounding objects take shape.  He reached the fountain in the public square; he made the turn to the left and slowed to a walk.  The sentry, walking slowly, reached the opposite corner, and before Zaidos could reach the open door he turned.  It was too late to turn back.  Zaidos squared his shoulders and approached.  The sentry eyed him sharply and was about to speak but Zaidos said, \"Good-morning,\" with civil ease. The man returned the salutation.  Then, \"What are you doing here?\" he questioned.  \"With a letter,\" said Zaidos, tapping his pocket.  \"Where from?\" demanded the sentry.  \"Over there,\" said Zaidos, nodding his head in the direction of the avenue.  It was a bold shot, but it carried.  \"Oh!\" said the sentry.  \"The other barracks, eh?  Well, will your errand wait, or must I wake them up within?\"  \"There is no hurry at all,\" said Zaidos, easily.  \"I must see the commanding officer by seven o'clock, that's all.\"  \"Very well,\" said the man.  \"I'll take you in then.  I'm tired enough myself tramping up and down here all night.  That place is full of recruits, and a lot of them are unwilling ones, I can tell you.  But they are under lock and key.  They can't escape.  All the air they get even is from that crack in the door.  A fly couldn't get out there.\" He was a fat sentry, and he laughed.  Zaidos joined his mirth.  \"Perhaps a thin fly might,\" he said.  The man shrugged.  \"Perhaps!\" he said.  \"Those recruits are raw, I can tell you.  You can be glad you are a trained soldier.  I could tell it by your walk, even in this dim light.  The walk always tells.\"  Zaidos nodded and squatted down near the open door.  Moment by moment his danger was growing.  The sentry turned and sauntered to the end of the block.  Zaidos counted slowly.  Once the man turned and nodded in a friendly fashion, then resumed his slow pace.  Sixty steps.  He stood for a moment on the corner, then came back.  \"Not long now,\" he said, and smiled.  Then he passed in the other direction.  Eighty steps that way.  Zaidos counted.  Again the man returned.  Zaidos could feel his muscles stiffening, as if about to spring.  He cautiously shifted to a position still nearer the partly open door and measured the opening. He felt heavy and awkward.  He studied the dark opening.  It did indeed look very narrow.  He had squirmed through it without much trouble, but that was in the densest darkness, and he had taken all the time he needed.  Now if the sentry should turn * * * Well, it would be the end of Zaidos, and a most ignominious end at that.  He was not a coward, but he had no fancy to find himself against a wall with a firing squad before him.  Sixty steps and back walked the sentry, and Zaidos, head against the wall, body reclining close to the open door, seemed to be dozing.  One, two, three steps past him, went the sentry again--  With the quickness of a cat Zaidos ripped off his uniform blouse, thrust it through the door, stretched his arms over his head, and with a mighty shove of his strong young legs thrust himself into the opening.  There was a terrific struggle for a moment, a series of agile twists, and Zaidos fell forward on the stone floor.  Quickly he kicked away his shoes and tumbled down on his pallet.  After the gray dawn outside the room was very dark.  He heard the sentry outside come running to the door, push it against its stout chain and stand thinking.  Zaidos laughed to himself.  The opening, \"too small for a fly,\" had swallowed him; and the unsuspicious fellow outside was filled with almost superstitious amazement.  He knew that Zaidos could not by any possibility have reached the corner without making the least sound, and the street was absolutely silent.  Zaidos, scarcely daring to breathe, smiled in the dark.  Then, fatherless and friendless as he was, and thrust by a strange fate of birth into a war in which he had no part, Zaidos, exhausted by his night's experiences, dropped asleep.  About him men tired by a long night spent on pallets as hard as the stone flooring tossed and groaned or sighed wakefully.  Zaidos slept on.  He was sleeping so heavily an hour later that he did not hear two soldiers enter with a slender young fellow in civilian dress.  He never stirred as they went from pallet to pallet, scanning the faces as they passed.  When they reached his side the young man looked down at him with an expression which might have been taken for startled amazement if anyone had been watching.  He nodded to the officers, and spoke a word of thanks.  \"This is my cousin,\" he said in a low voice.  \"With your permission I will sit here by him until he awakes.  It would be cruel to rouse him only to tell him of his father's death.\"  \"Yes, you may stay,\" said the older soldier.  \"There can be no objection to that.\"  They turned and soon the distant door closed behind them."]]]
