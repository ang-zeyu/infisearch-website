Perhaps she was wondering whether all Englishmen, possessed such innocent kindly faces and such ungainly though powerful frames.  It may be that she was contrasting him with the handsome well-knit Pedro at his side.  Whatever her thoughts might have been, the short glances of her lustrous eyes gave no clue to them, and her tongue was silent, save when she replied by some brief monosyllable to a remark or query put in the Indian language occasionally by Pedro.  Sometimes a gleam of the firelight threw her fine brown features into bold relief, but on these occasions, when Lawrence Armstrong chanced to observe them, they conveyed no expression whatever save that of profound gravity, with a touch, perhaps, of sadness.  The bench being awkwardly situated for a table, they had arranged a small box, bottom up, instead.  Lawrence and his new acquaintance seated themselves on the ground, and Manuela used her saddle as a chair.  Towards the end of their meal the two men became more communicative, and when Pedro had lighted a cigarette, they began to talk of their immediate future.  \"You don't smoke?\" remarked Pedro in passing.  \"No,\" replied Lawrence.  \"Not like the most of your countrymen,\" said the other.  \"So much the worse,\" rejoined the youth.  \"The worse for them or for you--which?\" asked Pedro, with a significant glance.  \"No matter,\" returned Lawrence with a laugh.  \"Well, now,\" resumed Pedro, after a few puffs, during the emission of which his countenance assumed the expression of seriousness, which seemed most natural to it, \"what do you intend to do?  It is well to have that point fairly settled to-night, so that there may be no uncertainty or delay in the morning.  I would not urge the question were it not that in the morning we must either go on together as travelling companions, or say our final adieux and part.  I am not in the habit of prying into men's private affairs, but, to speak the bare truth, I am naturally interested in one whose father has on more than one occasion done me good service.  You need not answer me unless you please, senhor,\" added the man with the air of one who is prepared to retire upon his dignity at a moment's notice.  \"Thanks, thanks, Pedro,\" said the Englishman, heartily, \"I appreciate your kindness, and accept your sympathy with gratitude.  Moreover, I am glad to find that I have been thrown at such a crisis in my fortunes into the company of one who had regard for my dear father.  But I scarce know what to do.  I will give you my confidence unreservedly.  Perhaps you may be able to advise--\"  \"Stay,\" interrupted the other, on whose countenance a slightly stern expression hovered.  \"Before you give me unreserved confidence, it is but fair that I should tell you candidly that I cannot pay you back in kind.  As to private matters, I have none that would be likely to interest any one under the sun.  In regard to other things--my business is not my own.  Why I am here and what I mean to do I have no right to reveal.  Whither I am bound, however, is not necessarily a secret, and if you choose to travel with me you undoubtedly have a right to know.\"  Young Armstrong expressed himself satisfied.  He might have wished to know more, but, like Pedro, he had no desire to pry into other men's affairs, and, being of an open confiding nature, was quite ready to take his companion on trust, even though he had been less candid and engaging in manner than he was.  After explaining that he had been educated in Edinburgh, and trained to the medical profession, he went on to say that he had been hastily summoned to take charge of the sugar-mill at his father's death, and that he had expected to find an old overseer, who would have instructed him in all that he had to do in a business with which he was totally unacquainted.  \"You see,\" he continued, \"my father always said that he meant to retire on his fortune, and did not wish me to carry on the business, but, being naturally an uncommunicative man on business matters, he never gave me any information as to details.  Of course, I had expected that his manager here, and his books, would reveal all that I required to know, but the soldiers have settled that question.  Mill and books have gone together, and as to manager, clerks, and servants, I know not where they are.\"  \"Scattered, no doubt,\" said Pedro, \"here, there, and everywhere--only too glad to escape from a neighbourhood which has been given up to fire and sword by way of improving its political condition!\"  \"I know not,\" returned Lawrence, sadly.  \"But it would be useless, I fear, to try to ferret them out.\"  \"Quite useless,\" said Pedro.  \"Besides, what would it avail to talk with any of them about the affairs of a place that is now in ashes?  But if your father spoke of his fortune, he must have had at least some of it in a bank somewhere.\"  \"True, but I don't know where.  All I know is that he once mentioned casually in one of his letters that he was going to Buenos Ayres, where he had some property.\"  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Pedro.  \"Come, that may help you to decide, for I am myself going to Buenos Ayres, and can guide you there if disposed to go. Only, you will have to make up your mind to a pretty long and hard journey, for duty requires me to go by a devious route.  You must know,\" he continued, lighting another cigarette, \"that I am pledged to take that girl to her father, who lives not far from Buenos Ayres.\"  He pointed as he spoke to Manuela, who, having laid her head on her saddle, appeared to have fallen asleep.  \"Her father must be a chief, I should think, to judge from her dignified, graceful carriage, as well as her fine features,\" said Lawrence in a low tone.  \"Yes, he is a chief--a great chief,\" returned Pedro, gazing at his cigarette in a meditative mood--\"a very great chief.  You see, she happened to be living with friends on the western side of the mountains when this war between Chili and Peru broke out, and her father naturally wants to get her out of danger.  The old chief once saved my life, so, you see, I am bound both by duty and gratitude to rescue his daughter.\"  \"Indeed you are, and a pleasant duty it must be,\" returned Lawrence with an approving nod; \"but don't you think it might have been wise to have rescued some other female, a domestic for instance, to keep her company? The poor girl will feel very lonely on such a long journey as you speak of.\"  Pedro again looked musingly at his cigarette, and flipped off the ash with his little finger.  \"You have not had much experience of war, young man,\" he said, \"if you think that in cases of rescue men can always arrange things comfortably, and according to the rules of propriety.  When towns and villages are in flames, when plunder and rapine run riot everywhere, and little children are spitted on the bayonets of patriots, as is often the case even in what men have agreed to term civilised warfare, one is glad to escape with the skin of one's teeth.  Yet I was not as regardless of Manuela's comfort as you seem to think.  A poor woman who had nursed her when a child volunteered to accompany us, and continued with us on the first part of our journey; but the exertion, as I had feared, was too much for her.  She caught a fever and died, so that we were forced to come on alone.  If you join us, however, I shall be greatly pleased, for two can always make a better fight than one, and in these unsettled times there is no saying what we may fall in with in crossing the mountains.\"  \"But why expose the poor girl to such risks?\" asked Lawrence.  \"Surely there must be some place of safety nearer than Buenos Ayres, to which you might conduct her?\"  \"Senhor Armstrong,\" replied the man, with a return of his stern expression, \"I have told you that my business is urgent.  Not even the rescue of my old friend's daughter can turn me aside from it.  When Manuela begged me to take her with me, I pointed out the difficulties and dangers of the route, and the necessity for my pursuing a long and devious course, but she said she feared to remain where she was; that, being young, strong, and accustomed to an active life, she felt sure she was equal to the journey; that she could trust me, and that she knew her father would approve of her taking the step.  I agreed, with some hesitation.  It turned out that the girl was right in her fears, for before we left the town it was attacked by the troops of Chili.  The Peruvians made but a poor resistance, and it was carried by assault. When I saw that all hope of saving the place was gone, I managed to bring Manuela and her nurse away in safety.  As I have told you, the nurse died, and now--here we are alone.  Manuela chooses to run the risk.  I will not turn aside from my duty.  If you choose to join us, the girl will be safer--at least until we cross the mountains.  On the other side I shall be joined by friends, if need be.\"  Pedro ceased, and rekindled his cigarette, which had gone out during the explanation.  \"I will go with you,\" said Lawrence, with decision, as he extended his hand.  \"Good,\" replied Pedro, grasping it with a hearty squeeze; \"now I shall have no fears for our little Indian, for robbers are cowards as a rule.\"  \"Have we, then, much chance of meeting with robbers?\"  \"Well, I should say we have little chance of altogether escaping them, for in times of war there are always plenty of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21701"],["title","The Settler and the Savage (#1)"],["body"," to who should drink most.  At last, the point of utmost capacity in both was reached, and they retired with a sigh of contentment, Rob Roy to browse on the plain, and his master to betake himself to the encampment on the knoll, where Hans Marais quickly supplied him with glorious steaks of springbok venison.  \"Isn't it an enjoyable thing to eat when one is hungry, eh?\" said Considine, after half an hour's silent devotion to the duty in hand.--\"Why, where got you that?\"  He referred to an ostrich egg which his companion had taken from a saddle-bag, and in one end of which he was busy boring a hole.  \"Found it in the sand just before I found you,\" said Hans.  \"Did you ever eat one?\"  \"No, never.\"  \"Well then, you shall do so now, and I'll show you how the niggers here make an omelet.\"  He planted the huge egg in the hot ashes as he spoke, and kept stirring its contents with a piece of stick until sufficiently cooked.  \"Not bad,--eh?\"  \"Glorious!\" exclaimed Considine, smacking his lips.  Both youths continued to smack their lips over the egg until it was finished, after which Charlie pronounced it not only a glorious but a satisfying morsel.  This was doubtless true, for an ostrich egg is considered equal to twenty-four hen's eggs.  Returning to the springbok steaks, the half-starved youth continued his repast, while Hans Marais, having finished, extended his huge frame beside the camp-fire, leaned upon his saddle, and smoked his pipe in benignant contemplation of his companion.  \"This is pleasant!\" said Charlie, pausing, with a sigh, and looking up.  \"Ja, it is pleasant,\" replied Hans.  \"Ja!\" repeated Charlie, quoting the Dutch \"Yes\" of the other; \"are you a Dutchman?\"  \"I am; at least I am a Cape colonist descended from Dutchmen.  Why are you surprised?\"  \"Because,\" replied his companion, while he prepared another steak over the embers, \"you speak English so well that I could not have known it. How came you to learn the language so perfectly?\"  \"My father, being wiser than some of his friends and neighbours,\" said Hans, \"sent me to Capetown to be educated.  I suppose that is the reason.  We dwelt in the western part of the colony then, and I was the eldest of the family.  When a number of us Dutchmen left that part of the country--being disgusted with the Government,--and came up here, my brothers and sister had to be taken from school.  This was a pity, for education taught me to know that education is an inestimable blessing-- the want of it a heavy misfortune.\"  \"True,\" remarked Considine.  But being still too busy with the steaks to pursue the subject he merely added--\"Does your father live near this?\"  \"About seven hours' ride, which, as I daresay you know, is forty-two miles.  You shall go home with me to-morrow.\"  \"How many are there of you?\" asked Considine, looking at the young Dutchman over a bone.  \"Excuse my being so impolite,\" he added, \"but d'you know, one feels horribly like a tiger after a two days' fast.\"  \"Don't stand on ceremony,\" said the other, with a laugh.  \"When you are satisfied we can converse.  There are fifteen of us: father, mother, sister, and eleven boys besides myself.  I'll tell you about them all after supper; meanwhile I'll go fetch the horses, for there are lions about, as I daresay you know, and some of them are nearly as ravenous as yourself.\"  Hans rose, put his pipe in the band of his broad-brimmed hat, and sauntered heavily out of the thicket.  In a few minutes he returned, leading the horses, and then busied himself in surrounding the camp with an almost impenetrable wall of mimosa-thorn branches, the spikes of which were so tremendous that it seemed as if nothing smaller than an elephant could force its way through.  This done, he sat down and quietly refilled his pipe, while Considine, having at last finished his meal, drew the embers of the fire together, disposed his limbs comfortably on the ground, lay back on his saddle, and prepared to enjoy a contemplative gaze at the cheering blaze and an interrogative conversation with his new friend.  \"Do you smoke?\" asked Hans.  \"No.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because it makes me sick, and I don't like it.\"  Hans looked surprised.  This was a new idea to him, and he sat for some time pondering it; indeed, we may say with truth that he \"smoked it\" In a few minutes he looked earnestly at the youth, and asked why he came to the Cape.  \"To make my fortune,\" answered Considine.  \"Fortunes are not easily made at the Cape,\" was the grave reply.  \"My father has been making his fortune for the last quarter of a century, and it's not made yet.--Why did you choose the Cape?\"  \"I didn't choose it.\"  \"No?\" said the Dutchman, with a look of surprise.  \"No,\" responded the Englishman; \"my coming here was not a matter of choice: it was necessity.  Come, I will make a confidant of you and relate my history.  Don't be alarmed, I won't keep you up all night with prosy details.  My life, as you may see, has not yet been a long one, and until this year it has been comparatively uneventful.\"  He paused a few moments as if to recall the past, while his companion, picking his pipe with a mimosa thorn, settled himself to listen.  \"Father, mother, brothers, and sisters I have none,\" began Considine as he whittled a stick--a pastime, by the way, which is erroneously supposed to be an exclusively American privilege.  \"Neither have I grandfathers, grandmothers, aunts, nephews, nieces, or anything else of the sort.  They all died either before or soon after I was born.  My only living relation is an uncle, who was my guardian.  He is a sea-captain, and a good man, but tough.  I bear him no ill-will.  I would not speak disrespectfully of him; but he is tough, and, I incline to think, no better than he should be.  Infancy and boyhood with squalling and schooling I pass over.  My uncle ordered me to study for the medical profession, and I obeyed.  Wishing to see a little of the world before finishing my course, I sailed in a vessel bound for Australia.  We touched at Table Bay in passing.  Obtaining leave, I went ashore at Capetown.  The ship also went ashore--without leave--in company with six other ships, during a terrific gale which sprang up in the night.  Our vessel became a total wreck.  The crew were saved, but my effects went with the cargo to the bottom.  Fortunately, however, I had carried ashore with me the little cash I possessed.\"  \"I found the Capetown people very kind.  One of them took me by the hand and offered me employment, but I preferred to proceed into the interior with a trader and work or shoot my way, in order to save my money.  No trader being about to start at that time, I was obliged to accept the offer of a frontier farmer, who, for a small sum, agreed to allow me to accompany his waggons, on condition that I should make myself generally useful.  I grudged the cash, but closed with the offer, and next day started on our journey of six hundred miles--such being the distance we had to go, according to my employer or comrade, Jan Smit.\"  \"Who?\" exclaimed Hans, with sudden energy.  \"Jan Smit,\" repeated Considine.  \"Do you know him?\"  \"Ja--but go on,\" said Hans, with a nod and a smile.  \"Well, I soon found that my Dutch comrade--\"  \"He's only half Dutch,\" interrupted Hans.  \"His mother was Dutch, but his father is English.\"  \"Well, Dutch or English, he is the most unmitigated scoundrel I ever met.\"  \"Ja,\" muttered Hans, \"he is.\"  \"And I soon found that my trip of pleasure became a trip of torment.  It is true we shot plenty of game--lions among the rest--but in camp the man was so unbearable that disgust counterbalanced all the pleasure of the trip.  I tried hard to get the better of him by good-humour and jollity, but he became so insolent at last that I could not stand it. Three days ago when I asked him how far we were from his farm, he growled that it wasn't far off now; whereupon I could not refrain from saying that I was glad to hear it, as we should soon have the pleasure of parting company.  This put him in a rage.  He kicked over the pot containing part of our breakfast, and told me I might part company then and there if I pleased.  My temper does not easily go, but it went at last.  I jumped up, saddled my horse, mounted, and rode away.  Of course I lost myself immediately, and for two days have been trying to find myself, without success, mourning over my fate and folly, and fasting from necessity.  But for my opportune meeting with you, Mr Marais, it might have gone hard with me and my poor horse, for the want of water had well-nigh floored us both.\"  \"You'll never make your fortune by doctoring on the frontier,\" said Hans, after a few minutes' silence.  \"Nobody gets ill in this splendid climate--besides, we couldn't afford to waste time in that way.  People here usually live to a great age, and then go off without the assistance of a doctor.  What else can you turn your hand to?\"  \"Anything,\" replied Considine, with the overweening confidence of youth.  \"Which means nothing, I suspect,\" said the Dutchman, \"for Jack-of-all-trades is proverbially master of none.\"  \"It may be so,\" retorted the other, \"nevertheless, without boasting, I may venture to assert--because I can prove it--that I am able to make tables, chairs, chests, and such-like things, besides knowing something of the blacksmith's trade.  In regard to doctoring, I am not entitled to practise for fees, not yet being full-fledged--only a third-year student--but I may do a little in that way for love, you know.  If you have a leg, for instance, that wants amputating, I can manage it for you with a good carving-knife and a cross-cut saw.  Or, should a grinder give you annoyance, any sort of pincers, small enough to enter your mouth, will enable me to relieve you.\"  At this Hans smiled and displayed a set of brilliant \"grinders,\" which did not appear likely to give him annoyance for some time to come.  \"Can you shoot?\" asked Hans, laying his hand on his companion's double-barrelle"]]]
