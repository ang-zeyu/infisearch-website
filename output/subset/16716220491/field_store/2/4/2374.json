Soon the boat was alongside, and much the same scene that we have already described was re-enacted; but there were no rebels this time. By the captain's resolute bearing at first many lives had probably been saved.  When most of the people had been lowered into the boat--not without great risk and many bruises--the widow, who, cowering with her father and child under the forecastle, had been overlooked, was led to the side with her child.  \"Not together, ma'am,\" said the captain.  \"You'd likely drop her.  Let me lower the child down first; or come first yourself--that will be better.\"  \"Give Lizzie to me,\" said the grandfather.  \"I'll hold her till you are safe, and ready to receive her.\"  \"Look alive, ma'am,\" urged one of the lifeboat men, who had scrambled on deck to render assistance.  The widow was soon in the boat, and held out her arms for little Lizzie. Somehow--no one could tell how--the men made a bungle of it.  Perhaps the very fear of doing so was the cause.  Instead of being caught by the boatmen, Lizzie slipped between the boat and the vessel into the boiling sea.  Giving one agonised cry, the grandfather leaped after her, but the surging boat swept in at the moment, and the old man fortunately fell into that instead of the sea.  He was not hurt, for strong arms had been upraised to receive him.  The little child rose above the foam as she was whirled past the stern of the boat by a swift current.  Bob Massey saw her little out-stretched arms.  There was no time for thought or consideration.  With one bound the coxswain was overboard.  Next moment the crew saw him far astern with the child in his arms.  \"Get 'em all aboard _first_!\" came back, even against the wind, in Bob's powerful, deep-toned voice.  Another moment, and he was lost to sight in the boiling waste of waters. Slag knew well what he meant.  If they should cast off the rope before rescuing all, for the purpose of picking up the coxswain, there would be no possibility of getting back again to the schooner, for she was fast breaking up.  Every current and eddy about these sands was well known to Joe Slag, also the set of the tides--besides, had not Bob got on his lifebelt?  He felt, nevertheless, that it was a tremendous risk to let him go.  But what could poor Slag do?  To cast off at once would have been to sacrifice about a dozen lives for the sake of saving two.  It was a fearful trial.  Joe loved Bob as a brother.  His heart well nigh burst, but it stood the trial.  He did his duty, and held on to the wreck!  Duty, on that occasion, however, was done with a promptitude, and in a fashion, that was not usual in one of his sedate nature.  Fortunately, none but men remained on the wreck by that time.  \"Tumble 'em in--sharp!\" cried Slag.  The lifeboat men obeyed literally, and tumbled them in with a celerity that might almost have awakened surprise in a sack of potatoes!  To haul up the anchor would have been slow work.  Slag--economical by nature--became extravagant for once.  An axe made short work of cable and anchor.  \"Let 'em go!\" he growled, as the boat drifted away.  The sail was set with miraculous speed, for now the wind was in their favour, and the gay lifeboat bounded off in the direction where Bob had disappeared, as though it felt a lively interest in the recovery of its coxswain.  It seemed as if the very elements sympathised with their anxiety, for just then the gale sensibly abated, and the rising sun broke through a rift in the grey clouds.  \"There he is--I see him!\" shouted the man in the bow--pointing eagerly ahead.  \"It's on'y a bit o' wreck, boy,\" cried a comrade.  \"Right you are,\" returned the bowman.  \"There he is, though, an' no mistake, this time.  Port!--port! hard-a-port!\"  As he spoke, the boat swept round into a sort of cross-current among the waves, where an object resembling a man was observed spinning slowly round like a lazy teetotum.  They were soon alongside.  A dozen claw-like hands made a simultaneous grasp, and hauled the object on board with a mighty cheer, for it was, indeed, the coxswain--alive, though much exhausted--with his precious little curly-haired burden in his arms.  The burden was also alive, and not much exhausted, for the weather was comparatively warm at the time, and Bob had thrust her little head into the luxuriant thicket of his beard and whiskers; and, spreading his great hands and arms all over her little body, had also kept her well out of the water--all which the great buoyancy of his lifebelt enabled him easily to do.  Shall we describe the joy of the widow and the grandfather?  No; there are some sacred matters in life which are best left to the imagination. The sunshine which had begun to scatter the clouds, and flood both land and sea, was typical of the joy which could find no better means than sobs wherewith to express gratitude to the God of mercy.  We have said that the gale had begun to abate.  When the lifeboat escaped from the turmoil of cross-seas that raged over the sands and got into deep water, all difficulties and dangers were past, and she was able to lay her course for Greyton harbour.  \"Let's have another swig o' that cold tea,\" said Bob Massey, resuming his rightful post at the helm.  \"It has done me a power o' good.  I had no notion that cold tea was so good for warmin' the cockles o' one's heart.\"  Ah!  Bob Massey, it was not the cold tea, but the saving of that little girl that sent the life's blood careering so warmly through your veins! However, there's no harm done in putting it down to the credit of the cold tea.  Had the tea been hot, there might have been some truth in your fancy.  \"What's the time?\" asked Bob, with a sudden look of anxiety.  \"Just gone ten,\" said Slag, consulting a chronometer that bore some resemblance to an antique warming-pan.  The look of anxiety on the coxswain's countenance deepened.  \"Ease off the sheet a bit,\" he said, looking sternly over the weather quarter, and whistling for a fresher breeze, though most men would have thought the breeze fresh enough already.  As if to accommodate him, and confirm the crew in the whistling superstition, the breeze did increase at the moment, and sent the lifeboat, as one of the men said, \"snorin'\" over the wild sea towards the harbour of Greyton.  It was a grand sight to behold the pier of the little port on that stormy morning.  Of course, it had soon become known that the lifeboat was out.  Although at starting it had been seen by only a few of the old salts--whose delight it was to recall the memory of grand stormy times long past, by facing the gales at all hours in oiled coats and sou'-westers--the greater part of the fishing village only became aware of the fact on turning out to work in the morning.  We have said that the gale had moderated, and the sun had come out, so that the pier was crowded, not only with fisher-folk, but with visitors to the port, and other landsmen.  Great was the hope, and sanguine the expectation of the crowd, when, after long and anxious waiting, the lifeboat was at last descried far out at sea, making straight for the harbour.  \"All right, Bill,\" exclaimed an old fisherman, who had been for some time past sweeping the horizon with his glass, \"the flag's a-flyin'.\"  \"What does that mean?\" asked a smart young lady, who had braved the blast and run the risk of a salt-wash from the sprays at the pier-end in her eager desire to see the boat arrive.  \"It means, Miss, that they've managed to save somebody--how many, in course, we can't tell till they come.\"  There was a strong disposition on the part of the crowd to cheer when this was said.  After a few minutes' further observation, the old man with the glass murmured, as if speaking to himself, \"I do believe she's chock-full o' people.\"  When this was repeated, the suppressed cheer broke forth, and the excitement increased.  Soon the people with good eyes could see for themselves that the swiftly approaching boat was as full as she could hold, of human beings.  At the same time, those who were in the boat could see the swarms of sympathisers on the pier who awaited their arrival.  But there was one man who took no note of these things, and seemed indifferent to everything around him.  The coxswain of the lifeboat was spiritually absent from the scene.  \"You seem to've got the fidgets, Bob,\" remarked Joe Slag, looking earnestly at his friend.  \"That swim has been too much for 'ee.\"  \"'Taint that, Joe,\" replied Bob, quickly.  \"What's the time now, lad?\"  Pulling out the antique warming-pan again, Slag said it was nigh a quarter past ten, and added that he, (Bob), seemed to be \"uncommon consarned about the time o' day that mornin'.\"  \"And so would you be, lad,\" returned the coxswain, in a low voice, as he advanced his mouth to his comrade's ear, \"if you was in my fix.  I've got to be spliced this day before twelve, an' the church is more'n two miles inland!\"  \"That's awk'ard,\" returned Slag, with a troubled look.  \"But, I say, Bob, you've kep' this uncommon close from us all--eh?  I never heerd ye was to be spliced so soon.\"  \"Of course I kep' it close, 'cos I wanted to give you an' my mates a surprise, but it strikes me I'll give some other people a surprise to-day, for there's no time to put on clean toggery.\"  \"You'll never manage it,\" said Slag, in a sympathetic tone, as he once more consulted the warming-pan.  \"It's gettin' on for half arter ten now, an' it takes a mortal time to rig out in them go-to-meetin' slops.\"  \"Do I look anything like a bridegroom as I am?\" asked the coxswain with a curious glance.  \"Sca'cely,\" replied Slag, surveying his friend with a grim smile--\"(mind your helm, Bob, there's a awk'ard"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21726"],["title","Deep Down, a Tale of the Cornish Mines (#1)"],["body","of ferns, and in various other ways sought to pacify him.  The old man grumbled a good deal at first, but was finally so far mollified as to say less testily, while he put on his hat, \"I warrant me, young man, you are come on some wild-goose chase to this out-o'-the-way region of the land in search of the picturesque--eh?--a dauber on canvas?\"  \"No, sir,\" replied the youth, \"I profess not to wield the pencil or brush, although I admit to having made feeble efforts as an amateur. The scalpel is more to my taste, and my object in coming here is to visit a relative.  I am on my way to St. Just; but, having wandered somewhat out of my road, have been obliged to strike into bypaths, as you see.\"  \"As I _see_, young man!--yes, and as I _feel_,\" replied the old gentleman, with some remains of asperity.  \"I have already expressed regret for the mischance that has befallen you,\" said the youth in grey somewhat sternly, for his impulsive spirit fired a little at the continued ill-humour of the old gentleman. \"Perhaps you will return good for evil by pointing out the way to St. Just.  May I venture to ask this favour of you?\"  \"You may venture, and you _have_ ventured; and it is my belief, young man, that you'll venture many a thing before this world has done with you; however, as you are a stranger in these parts, and have expressed due penitence for your misdeed, though I more than half doubt your sincerity, I can do no less than point out the road to St. Just, whither I will accompany you at least part of the way; and, young sir, as you have taken pretty free liberty with _me_ this morning, may I take the liberty of asking _you_ the name of your relative in St. Just?  I am well acquainted with most of the inhabitants of that town.\"  \"Certainly,\" replied the youth.  \"The gentleman whom I am going to visit is my uncle.  His name is Donnithorne.\"  \"What!  Tom Donnithorne?\" exclaimed the old gentleman, in a tone of surprise, as he darted a keen glance from under his bushy eyebrows at his companion.  \"Hah! then from that fact I gather that you are Oliver Trembath, the young doctor whom he has been expecting the last day or two.  H'm--so old Tom Donnithorne is your uncle, is he?\"  The youth in grey did not relish the free and easy, not to say patronising, tone of his companion, and felt inclined to give a sharp answer, but he restrained his feelings and replied,--\"He is, and you are correct in your supposition regarding myself.  Do you happen to know my uncle personally?\"  \"Know him personally!\" cried the old gentleman with a sardonic laugh; \"Oh yes, I know him intimately--intimately; some people say he's a very good fellow.\"  \"I am glad to hear that, for to say truth--\"  He paused abruptly.  \"Ha!  I suppose you were going to say that you have heard a different account of him--eh?\"  \"Well, I _was_ going to observe,\" replied Oliver, with a laugh, \"that my uncle is rather a wild man for his years--addicted to smuggling, I am told, and somewhat given to the bottle; but it is well known that tattlers give false reports, and I am delighted to hear that the old boy is not such a bad fellow after all.\"  \"Humph!\" ejaculated the other.  \"Then you have never seen him, I suppose?\"  \"No, never; although I am a Cornishman I have seen little of my native county, having left it when a little boy--before my uncle came to live in this part of the country.\"  \"H'm--well, young man, I would advise you to beware of that same uncle of yours.\"  \"How!\" exclaimed the youth in surprise; \"did you not tell me just now that he is a very good fellow?\"  \"No, sir, I did not.  I told you that _some_ people say he is a very good fellow, but for myself I think him an uncommonly bad man, a man who has done me great injury in his day--\"  \"It grieves me to hear you say so,\" interrupted Oliver, whose ire was again roused by the tone and manner of his companion.  \"A decidedly bad man,\" continued the old gentleman, not noticing the interruption, \"a thorough rascal, a smuggler, and a drunkard, and--\"  \"Hold, sir!\" cried the youth sternly, as he stopped and faced the old gentleman, \"remember that you speak of my relative.  Had you been a younger man, sir--\"  Again the youth paused abruptly.  \"Go on, sir,\" said the old gentleman ironically, \"you would have pommelled me to a jelly with your cudgel, I suppose; is that it?--acting somewhat in the spirit of your kinsman, that same smuggling and tippling old scoundrel, who--\"  \"Enough, sir,\" interrupted the young man angrily; \"we part company here.\"  So saying, he vaulted over the wall that separated the road from the moor, and hurried away.  \"Take the first turn to the left, and keep straight on, else you'll lose yourself aga-a-a-in,\" roared the old gentleman, \"and my compliments to the rascally old smugg-le-e-r-r!\"  \"The old scoundrel!\" muttered the youth as he hurried away.  \"The young puppy!\" growled the old gentleman as he jogged along.  \"Given to smuggling and the bottle indeed--humph! the excitable jackanapes! But I've given him a turn in the wrong direction that will cool his blood somewhat, and give me leisure to cool mine too, before we meet again.\"  Here the old gentleman's red countenance relaxed into a broad grin, and he chuckled a good deal, in the midst of a running commentary on the conduct and appearance of his late companion, from the disjointed sentences of which it might have been gathered that although his introduction to the young doctor had been unfortunate, and the succeeding intercourse stormy, his opinion of him was not altogether unfavourable.    CHAPTER TWO.  SHOWS WHAT ASTONISHING RESULTS MAY FOLLOW FROM TAKING THE WRONG ROAD.  Before Oliver Trembath had advanced half a mile on his path, he had cooled sufficiently to experience some regret at having been so quick to take offence at one who, being evidently an eccentric character, should not, he thought, have been broken with so summarily.  Regrets, however, had come too late, so he endeavoured to shake off the disagreeable feelings that depressed him, and, the more effectually to accomplish this, burst forth into a bravura song with so much emphasis as utterly to drown, and no doubt to confound, two larks, which, up to that time, had been pouring their melodious souls out of their little bodies in the bright blue sky above.  Presently he came to a part of the moor where two roads diverged--one to the right and the other to the left.  Recalling the shout of advice which the old gentleman had given him in parting, he took that which led to the left, and was gratified, on gaining an eminence a short distance in advance, to see in the far distance a square turret, which he concluded was that of the church of St. Just.  Keeping this turret in view, the youth stepped out so vigorously that he soon reached the small town that clustered round the church, and going up to the first man he met, said, \"This is the town of St. Just, I suppose, is it not?\"  \"No, et is'n; thee's come the wrang road, sur,\" replied the rustic. \"This es Sennen church-town.  St. Just es up over th' hill theere.\"  Oliver Trembath's first feeling was one of surprise; this was followed by annoyance, which quickly degenerated into anger as it flashed into his mind that the old gentleman might possibly have led him wrong on purpose.  \"How far is it to St. Just?\" he inquired.  \"'Bout six miles, sur.\"  \"Then I suppose I am not far from the Land's End?\" said Oliver after a pause.  \"No, not fur,\" replied the man.  \"Et do lie straight before 'ee.\"  Thanking the man, Oliver started off at a smart pace, resolving, before proceeding to St. Just, to visit this extreme western point of England-- a visit to which he had often looked forward with pleasant anticipation.  During the last hour of his walk the sun had been obscured by clouds, but, just as he approached the cliffs, the clouds separated, and a golden flood rushed over the broad Atlantic, which now lay spread out before him in all its wide majesty as far as the eye could see.  \"A good omen!\" cried the youth with a shout, as he hurried towards the shore, intending to fling off his garments and bathe in the mighty ocean, which, from the place where he first beheld it, appeared to be smooth and still as a mill-pond.  But Oliver was compelled to restrain his ardour, for on nearing the sea he found that he stood on the summit of high cliffs, beyond which the Land's End stretched in a succession of broken masses of granite, so chafed and shattered by the action of the sea, and so curiously split, as to resemble basaltic columns.  To reach the outermost of those weather-worn sentinels of Old England, required some caution on the part of our traveller, even although well used to scaling the rocky heights of Scottish mountains, and when he did at last plant his foot on the veritable Land's End, he found that it was a precipice apparently sixty feet high, which descended perpendicularly into deep water.  His meditated bathe was therefore an impossibility, for those glassy undulations, which appeared so harmless at a distance, gathered slow and gradual height as they approached the land, and at last, assuming the form of majestic waves, flung themselves with a grand roar on the stern cliffs which they have battered so long in vain, and round which--always repulsed but never conquered--they seethed in milky foam.  With glistening eye, and heaving breast, and mantling colour, the young doctor stood long and motionless on this extreme point of land--absorbed in admiration of the glorious scene before him.  Often had he beheld the sea in the firths and estuaries of the North, but never till now had he conceived the grandeur of the great Atlantic.  It seemed to him as if the waves of those inland seas, when tossed by wild storms, were but rough miniature copies of the huge billows which arose before him, without apparent cause, and, advancing without rush or agitation, fell successively with solemn roar at his feet, awakening irresistibly"]]]
