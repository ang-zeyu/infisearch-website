The child once more knelt by the side of the Indian and held the can to him, while he conveyed the soup to his lips with a trembling, unsteady hand.  The eyes of the poor man glittered as he gazed eagerly at the food, which he ate with the avidity of a half-famished wolf.  His nurses looked on with great satisfaction, and when Wapaw glanced up from time to time in their faces, he was advised to continue his meal with nods and smiles of goodwill.  Great preparations were made for the dinner of that New Year's Day. Those who \"dwell at home at ease\" have no idea of the peculiar feelings with which the world's wanderers hail the season of Christmas and New Year.  Surrounded as they usually are by strange scenes, and ignorant as they are of what friends at home are doing or thinking, they lay hold of this season as being one point at least in the circle of the year in which they can unite with the home circle, and, at the _same time_, commemorate with them the birth of the blessed Saviour of mankind, and think with them of absent friends.  Much, therefore, as the \"happy\" season is made of in the \"old country,\" it is made more of, if possible, in the colonies; especially on the outskirts of the world, where the adventurous and daring have pitched their tents.  Of course Robin Gore and his household did not think of the \"old country,\" for they were descendants of settlers; but they had imbibed the spirit of the old country from their forefathers, and thought of those well-remembered friends whom they had left behind them in the settlements.  Notwithstanding the delay caused by the conveying of Wapaw to the Fort, the hunters had walked so fast that there was still some time to spare before dinner should be ready.  Roy resolved to devote this time to a ramble in the woods with his sister Nelly.  Accordingly the two put on their snow-shoes, and, merely saying to their mother that they were going to take a run in the woods, set forth.  Now, it must be known that Mrs Gore had looked forward to New Year's Day dinner with great interest and much anxiety.  There was a general feeling of hilarity and excitement among the male members of the self-exiled family that extended itself to the good woman, and induced her to resolve that the entire household should have what Walter styled a \"rare blow-out!\"  During the whole morning she had been busy with the preparation of the various dishes, among which were a tart made of cloudberry jam, a salt goose, and a lump of bear's ham, besides the rabbits and ptarmigan which had been shot that day.  \"That's the way to do it, Molly,\" cried Robin, as he opened the door and peeped in upon his wife during the height and heat of her culinary labours; \"keep the pot bilin', my dear, and don't spare the butter this day.  It only comes once a year, you know.\"  \"Twice,\" muttered Larry in a low voice, as he stirred the contents of a large pot which hung over the fire.  \"And see that you look after Wapaw,\" continued Robin.  \"Don't give him too much at first, it'll hurt him.\"  \"No fear of that,\" replied Larry, \"he's got so much a'ready that he couldn't howld another morsel av he was to try.\"  \"Well, well, take care of him, anyhow,\" said Robin, with a laugh; \"meanwhile I'll go see after the defences o' the Fort, and make all snug.\"  By dint of unwearied perseverance the dinner was cooked, and then it occurred to Robin to ask where the children were, but no one could tell, so the hunter remarked quietly that they would \"doubtless make their appearance in a short while.\"  Gradually the dinner reached that interesting point which is usually styled \"ready to dish.\"  Whereupon Robin again asked where the children were.  Still no one could tell, so he said he would go out and hail them.  Loudly and long did the hunter call, but no one answered; then he made a rapid search in and about the Fort, but they were not to be found.  Moreover, a snow-storm had begun to set in, and the drift rendered it difficult to distinguish tracks in the snow.  At last the day's labours were brought to a close.  Dinner was served, and smoked invitingly on the table.  The party only awaited the return of Robin with the children.  In a few minutes Robin entered hastily.  \"Molly,\" said he, in a tone of anxiety, \"the foolish things have gone into the woods, I think.  Come, lads, we must hunt them down.  It's snowin' hard, so we've no time to lose.\"  Walter and Larry at once put on their capotes, fur-caps, and snow-shoes, and sallied forth, leaving Mrs Gore seated alone, and in a state of deep anxiety, by the side of her untasted New Year's Day dinner.    CHAPTER FOUR.  LOST IN THE SNOW.  When Roy and Nelly set out for a ramble, they had at first no intention of going beyond their usual haunts in the woods around the Fort; but Roy had been inspirited by his successful march that day with his father and Walter, and felt inclined to show Nelly some new scenes to which they had not, up to that time, dared to penetrate together.  The snow-storm, already referred to, had commenced gradually.  When the children set forth on their ramble only a few flakes were falling, but they had not been away half an hour when snow fell so thickly that they could not see distinctly more than a few yards ahead of them.  There was no wind, however, so they continued to advance, rather pleased than otherwise with the state of things.  \"Oh, I _do_ like to see falling snow,\" cried Nelly, with a burst of animation.  \"So do I,\" said Roy, looking back at his sister with a bright smile, \"and I like it best when it comes down thick and heavy, in big flakes, on a _very_ calm day, don't you?\"  \"Yes, oh it's so nice,\" responded Nelly sympathetically.  They paused for minutes to shake some of the snow from their garments, and beat their hands together, for their fingers were cold, and to laugh boisterously, for their hearts were merry.  Then they resumed their march, Roy beating the track manfully and Nelly following in his footsteps.  In passing beneath a tall fir-tree Roy chanced to touch a twig.  The result was literally overwhelming, for in a moment he was almost buried in snow, to the unutterable delight of his sister, who stood screaming with laughter as the unfortunate boy struggled to disentomb himself.  In those northern wilds, where snow falls frequently and in great abundance, masses are constantly accumulating on the branches of trees, particularly on the pines, on the broad flat branches of which these masses attain to considerable size.  A slight touch is generally sufficient to bring these down, but, being soft, they never do any injury worth mentioning.  When Roy had fairly emerged from the snow he joined his sister in the laugh, but suddenly he stopped, and his face became very grave.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Nelly, with an anxious look.  \"My snow-shoe's broken,\" said Roy.  There was greater cause for anxiety on account of this accident than the reader is perhaps aware of.  It may be easily understood that in a country where the snow averages four feet in depth, no one can walk half-a-mile without snow-shoes without being thoroughly exhausted; on the other hand, a man can walk thirty or forty miles a day by means of snow-shoes.  \"Can't you mend it?\" asked Nelly.  Roy, who had been carefully examining the damaged shoe, shook his head.  \"I've nothing here to do it with; besides, it's an awful smash.  I must just try to scramble home the best way I can.  Come, it's not very far, we'll only be a bit late for dinner.\"  The snow-shoe having been bandaged, after a fashion, with a pocket-handkerchief, the little wanderers began to retrace their steps; but this was now a matter of extreme difficulty, owing to the quantity of snow which had fallen and almost obliterated the tracks.  The broken shoe, also, was constantly giving way, so that ere long the children became bewildered as well as anxious, and soon lost the track of their outward march altogether.  To make matters worse, the wind began to blow clouds of snow-drift into their faces, compelling them to seek the denser parts of the forest for shelter.  They wandered on, however, in the belief that they were drawing nearer home every step, and Roy, whose heart was stout and brave, cheered up his sister's spirit so much that she began to feel quite confident their troubles would soon be over.  Presently all their hopes were dashed to the ground by their suddenly emerging upon an open space, close to the very spot where the snow-mass had fallen on Roy's head.  After the first feeling of alarm and disappointment had subsided, Roy plucked up heart and encouraged Nelly by pointing out to her that they had at all events recovered their old track, which they would be very careful not to lose sight of again.  Poor Nelly whimpered a little, partly from cold and hunger as well as from disappointment, as she listened to her brother's words; then she dried her eyes and said she was ready to begin again.  So they set off once more.  But the difficulty of discerning the track, if great at first, was greater now, because the falling and drifting snow had well-nigh covered it up completely.  In a very few minutes Roy stopped, and, confessing that he had lost it again, proposed to return once more to their starting point to try to recover it.  Nelly agreed, for she was by this time too much fatigued and alarmed to have any will of her own, and was quite ready to do whatever she was told without question.  After wandering about for nearly an hour in this state of uncertainty, Roy at last stopped, and, putting his arm round his sister's waist, said that he had "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21704"],["title","Six Months at the Cape (#1)"],["body","ter.  At all events, you may depend upon it, my dear Periwinkle, that no new friend shall ever tumble _you_ out of the niche which you occupy in my bosom!  But be this as it may, it is a fact that in my berth--which held four, and was full all the voyage--there was a tall, dark, powerful, middle-aged man, an Englishman born in Cape Colony, [see note 3], who had been \"home\" for a trip, and was on his way out again to his African home on the great Karroo.  This man raised within me feelings of disgust when I first saw him in the dim light of our berth, because he was big, and I knew that a big man requires more air to fill his lungs than a little one, and there was no superabundant air in our berth--quite the reverse.  This man occupied the top berth opposite to mine.  Each morning as I awoke my eyes fell on his beard of iron-grey, and I gazed at his placid countenance till he awoke--or I found his placid countenance gazing at me when _I_ awoke.  From gazing to nodding in recognition is an easy step in ordinary circumstances, but not when one's head is on one's pillow.  We therefore passed at once, without the ceremony of nodding, into a quiet \"good morning.\"  Although reticent, he gradually added a smile to the \"good morning,\" and I noticed that his smile was a peculiarly pleasant one.  Steps that succeed the \"first\" are generally easy.  From disliking this man--not on personal, but purely selfish grounds--I came to like him; then to love him.  I have reason to believe that the attachment was mutual.  His name--why should I not state it?  I don't think he would object--is Hobson.  In the bunk below Hobson lay a young Wesleyan minister.  He was a slender young fellow,--modest and thoughtful.  If Hobson's bunk had given way, I fear that his modesty and thoughtfulness might have been put to a severe test.  I looked down upon this young Wesleyan from my materially exalted position, but before the voyage was over I learned to look up to him from a spiritually low position.  My impression is that he was a \"meek\" man.  I may be mistaken, but of this am I certain, that he was one of the gentlest, and at the same time one of the most able men in the ship.  But, to return to my berth--which, by the way, I was often loth to do, owing to the confined air below, and the fresh glorious breezes on deck--the man who slept under me was a young banker, a clerk, going out to the Cape to make his fortune, and a fine capable-looking fellow he was, inclined rather to be receptive than communicative.  He frequently bumped me with his head in getting up; I, not unfrequently, put a foot upon his nose, or toes, in getting down.  What can I say about the sea that has not been said over and over again in days of old?  This, however, is worthy of record, that we passed the famous Bay of Biscay in a dead-calm.  We did not \"lay\" one single \"day\" on that \"Bay of Biscay, O!\"  The \"O!\" seems rather awkwardly to imply that I am not stating the exact truth, but I assure you that it is a fact.  More than this, we had not a storm all the way to the Cape.  It was a pure pleasure excursion--a sort of yacht voyage--from beginning to end; very pleasant at the time, and delightful now to dwell upon; for, besides the satisfaction of making a new friend like Hobson, there were others to whom I was powerfully drawn, both by natural sympathy and intellectual bias.  There was a Wesleyan minister, also an Englishman, born in South Africa, and of the race of Anak, with whom, and his amiable wife, and pretty children, I fraternised ardently.  My soul was also gladdened by intercourse with a clergyman of the Dutch-Reformed Church, well-known in the Cape, and especially in the Transvaal--who, with his pleasant wife and daughter, was on his way back to South Africa after a brief trip to Europe.  He was argumentative; so, you know, am I.  He was also good-tempered, therefore we got on well.  It would be an endless business to name and describe all the passengers who were personally attractive, and who were more or less worthy of description.  There were, among others, a genial and enthusiastic Dutch-African legislator of the Cape; a broad-shouldered but retiring astronomer; also a kindly Cape merchant; and a genial English banker, with their respective wives and families.  I had the good fortune to sit in the midst of these at meals, close to Captain Hewat, who is unquestionably, what many of us styled him, a \"trump.\"  He is also a Scotchman.  There was likewise a diamond-digger, and another man who seemed to hate everybody except himself.  There were also several sportsmen; one of whom, a gallant son of Mars, and an author, had traversed the \"Great Lone Land\" of British America, and had generally, it seemed to me, \"done\" the world, with the exception of Central Africa, which he was at last going to add to his list.  There were also troops of children, who behaved remarkably well considering the trials they had to undergo; and numerous nurses, some of whom required more attention than all the ladies put together.  You will now, no doubt, expect an account of romantic adventures on the deep, and narrow escapes, and alarms of fire, and men overboard, and thrilling narratives.  If so, your expectations are doomed to disappointment.  We fished for no sharks, we chased no whales, we fell in with no slavers or pirates.  Nevertheless we saw flying fish, and we had concerts and lectures; and such delightful perambulations of the decks, and such charming impromptu duets and glees and solos on retired parts of the deck in moonlight nights, and such earnest discussions, and such genial companionship!  Truly that voyage was one of those brilliant episodes which occur only once in a lifetime, and cannot be repeated; one of those green spots in memory, which, methinks, will survive when all other earthly things have passed away.  I will write no more about it, however, at present.  Neither will I proceed in what is usually considered the natural manner with my epistles--namely, step by step.  Arrivals, cities, travelling, roads, inns, and all such, I will skip, and proceed at one bound to that which at the present moment is to me most interesting, merely remarking that we reached Capetown, (of which more hereafter), in November,--the South African summer--after a voyage of twenty-five days.  I am now sojourning at Ebenezer-Hobson's residence on the Karroo.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.  Near the Tower of London.

To start for the hunting-field at seven in the morning in a carriage and six, smacks of royalty and sounds luxurious, but in South Africa there are drawbacks connected therewith.  Hobson's farm is, as I have said, on the Karroo--those vast plains which at some seasons resemble a sandy desert, and at others are covered with rich verdure and gorgeous flowers.  They are named after the small, succulent, Karroo-bush, which represents the grass of other plains, and is excellent food for cattle, sheep, and ostriches.  These plains embrace a considerable portion of the territory of the Cape.  The Karroo is pre-eminently lumpy.  Its roads in most places are merely the result of traffic.  They, also, are lumpy.  Our carriage was a native \"cart,\" by which is meant a plain and powerful machine with springs that are too strong readily to yield.  Five of our team were mules, the sixth was a pony.  Our party at starting numbered five, but grew as we progressed.  We took with us provisions and fodder for two days.  The driving was undertaken by Hobson's nephew, assisted by his eldest son--\"Six-foot Johnny.\" There was a double necessity for two drivers.  To hold the reins of five kicking mules and a prancing pony required both hands as well as all the strength of the cousin, though he was a powerful fellow, and the management of the whip claimed both arms, and all the strength, as well as the undivided attention of his assistant.  The whip was a salmon-rod in appearance, without exaggeration.  It had a bamboo handle somewhere between twelve and fourteen feet long, with a proportionate lash.  The operator sometimes found it convenient to stand when he made a cast with his fishing-rod weapon.  He was an adept with it; capable, it seemed to me, of picking a fly off one of the leader's ears.  There was some trouble in keeping our team quiet while rifles, ammunition, provisions, etcetera, were being stowed in the cart.  At last the cousin gave the word.  Six-foot Johnny made a cast.  The lash grazed the leader's flank with a crack that might have shamed a small revolver.  The mules presented first their noses, then their heels to the sky; the cart leaped from the ground, and we were off--bumping, rattling, crashing, swinging, over the wild Karroo, followed by some half-dozen horses led by two mounted Hottentot attendants.  My friend Hobson, greatly to our grief, did not accompany us, owing to inflamed eyes, but I shared the back seat of the cart with his brother Jonathan, a tall strapping man of middle age and modest mien, who seemed to me the perfect type of a colonial hero.  In an hour or so we came to the solitary farm of a Mr Green, who regaled us with a sumptuous breakfast, and lent me a spur.  I had the liberal offer of two spurs, but as, in hunting with the rifle, it is sometimes advisable to sit on one's right heel, and memory during the excitement of the"]]]
