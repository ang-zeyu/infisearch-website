He at once levelled his rifle at the creature's breast and fired.  The bear rushed at him, nevertheless, as if uninjured.  Drawing his revolver, Tom discharged two shots before the monster reached him.  All three shots had taken effect but bears are noted for tenacity of life, and are frequently able to fight a furious battle after being mortally wounded.  The rifle ball had touched its heart, and the revolver bullets had gone deep into its chest, yet it showed little sign of having been hurt.  Knowing full well the fate that awaited him if he stood to wrestle with a bear, the youth turned to run, but the bear was too quick for him.  It struck him on the back and felled him to the earth.  Strange to say, at that moment Tom Brixton's ill-gotten gains stood him in good stead.  There can be no question that the bear's tremendous claws would have sunk deep into the youth's back, and probably broken his spine, if they had not been arrested by the bag of gold which was slung at his back.  Although knocked down and slightly stunned, Brixton was still unwounded, and, even in the act of falling, had presence of mind to draw his long knife and plunge it up to the haft in the creature's side, at the same time twisting himself violently round so as to fall on his back and thus face the foe.  In this position, partly owing to the form of the ground, the bear found it difficult to grasp its opponent in its awful embrace, but it held him with its claws and seized his left shoulder with its teeth.  This rendered the use of the revolver impossible, but fortunately Brixton's right arm was still free, and he drove the keen knife a second time deep into the animal's sides.  Whether mortal or not, the wound did not immediately kill.  Tom felt that his hour was come, and a deadly fear came over him as the thought of death, his recent life, and judgment, flashed through his brain.  He drew out the knife, however, to make another desperate thrust.  The bear's great throat was close over his face.  He thought of its jugular vein, and made a deadly thrust at the spot where he imagined that to run.  Instantly a flood of warm blood deluged his face and breast; at the same time he felt as if some dreadful weight were pressing him to death. Then consciousness forsook him.  While this desperate fight was going on, the miners of Pine Tree camp were scouring the woods in all directions in search of the fugitive.  As we have said, great indignation was felt at that time against thieves, because some of them had become very daring, and cases of theft were multiplying.  Severe penalties had been imposed on the culprits by the rest of the community without curing the evil.  At last death was decided on as the penalty for any act of theft, however trifling it might be.  That these men were in earnest was proved by the summary execution of the next two offenders who were caught.  Immediately after that thieving came to an abrupt end, insomuch that if you had left a bag of gold on an exposed place, men would have gone out of their way to avoid it!  One can understand, therefore, the indignation that was roused in the camp when Tom Brixton revived the practice in such a cool and impudent manner.  It was felt that, despite his being a favourite with many of the diggers, he must be made an example.  Pursuit was, therefore, organised on an extensive scale and in a methodical manner.  Among others, his friend Fred Westly took part in it.  It cost those diggers something thus to give up the exciting work of gold-finding for a chase that promised to occupy time and tax perseverance.  Some of them even refused to join in it, but on the whole the desire for vengeance seemed general.  Bully Gashford, as he did not object to be called, was, in virtue of his size, energy, and desperate character, tacitly appointed leader.  Indeed he would have assumed that position if it had not been accorded to him, for he was made of that stuff which produces either heroes of the highest type or scoundrels of the deepest dye.  He arranged that the pursuers should proceed in a body to the mouth of the valley, and there, dividing into several parties, scatter themselves abroad until they should find the thief's trail and then follow it up.  As the miners were not much accustomed to following trails, they engaged the services of several Indians who chanced to be at the camp at that time.  \"What direction d'ye think it's likely your precious chum has taken?\" asked Gashford, turning abruptly to Fred Westly when the different parties were about to start.  \"It is impossible for me to tell.\"  \"I know that,\" retorted Gashford, with a scowl and something of a sneer, \"but it ain't impossible for you to guess.  However, it will do as well if you tell me which party you intend to join.\"  \"I shall join that which goes to the south-west,\" replied Westly.  \"Well, then, _I_ will join that which goes to the south-east,\" returned the bully, shouldering his rifle.  \"Go ahead, you red reptile,\" he added, giving a sign to the Indian at the head of the party he had selected to lead.  The Indian at once went off at a swinging walk, amounting almost to a trot.  The others followed suit and the forest soon swallowed them all in its dark embrace.  In making this selection Gashford had fallen into a mistake not uncommon among scoundrels--that of judging other men by themselves.  He knew that Westly was fond of his guilty friend, and concluded that he would tell any falsehood or put the pursuers on any false scent that might favour his escape.  He also guessed--and he was fond of guessing--that Fred would answer his question by indicating the direction which he thought it most probable his friend had _not_ taken.  In these guesses he was only to a small extent right.  Westly did indeed earnestly hope that his friend would escape; for he deemed the intended punishment of death most unjustly severe, and, knowing intimately the character and tendencies of Tom Brixton's mind and tastes, he had a pretty shrewd guess as to the direction he had taken, but, so far from desiring to throw the pursuers off the scent his main anxiety was to join the party which he thought most likely to find the fugitive--if they should find him at all--in order that he might be present to defend him from sudden or unnecessary violence.  Of course Paddy Flinders went with the same party, and we need scarcely add that the little Irishman sympathised with Fred.  \"D'ee think it's likely we'll cotch 'im?\" he asked, in a whisper, on the evening of that day, as they went rapidly through the woods together, a little in rear of their party.  \"It is difficult to say,\" answered Westly.  \"I earnestly hope not; indeed I think not, for Tom has had a good start; but the search is well organised, and there are bloodthirsty, indignant, and persevering men among the various parties, who won't be easily baffled.  Still Tom is a splendid runner.  We may depend on having a long chase before we come up with him.\"  \"Ah, then, it's glad I am that ye think so, sor,\" returned Paddy, \"for I've been afear'd Mister Tom hadn't got quite so much go in him, since he tuk to gambling and drinkin'.\"  \"Look here, Paddy,\" exclaimed his companion, stopping abruptly, and pointing to the ground, \"are not these the footprints of one of your friends?\"  \"Sure it's a bar,\" said the little man, going down on his knees to examine the footprints in question with deep interest.  Flinders was a remarkably plucky little man, and one of his great ambitions was to meet with a bear, when alone, and slay it single-handed.  His ambition had not up to that time, been gratified, fortunately for himself, for he was a bad shot and exceedingly reckless, two qualities which would probably have insured his own destruction if he had had his wish.  \"Let's go after it, Mister Westly,\" he said, springing to his feet with an excited look.  \"Nonsense, it is probably miles off by this time; besides, we should lose our party.\"  \"Niver a taste, sor; we could soon overhaul them agin.  An' won't they have to camp at sundown anyhow?  Moreover, if we don't come up wi' the bar in a mile or so we can give it up.\"  \"No, no, Paddy, we must not fall behind.  At least, _I_ must not; but you may go after it alone if you choose.\"  \"Well, I will, sor.  Sure it's not ivery day I git the chance; an' there's no fear o' ye overhaulin' Mister Tom this night.  We'll have to slape over it, I'll be bound.  Just tell the boys I'll be after them in no time.\"  So saying Paddy shouldered his rifle, felt knife and axe to make sure of their being safe in his belt, and strode away in the track of the bear.  He had not gone above a quarter of a mile when he came to the spot where the mortal combat had taken place, and found Tom Brixton and the bear dead--as he imagined--on the blood-stained turf.  He uttered a mighty cry, partly to relieve his feelings and partly to recall his friend.  The imprudence of this flashed upon him when too late, for others, besides Fred, might have heard him.  But Tom Brixton was not dead.  Soon after the dying bear had fallen on him, he recovered consciousness, and shaking himself clear of the carcass with difficulty had arisen; but, giddiness returning, he lay down, and while in this position, overcome with fatigue, had fallen asleep.  Paddy's shout aroused him.  With a sense of deadly peril hanging over him he leaped up and sprang on the Irishman.  \"Hallo, Paddy!\" he cried, checking himself, and endeavouring to wipe from his face some of the clotted blood with which he had been deluged. \"_You_ here?  Are you alone?\"  \"It's wishin' that I was,\" replied the little man, looking round anxiously.  \"Mister Fred 'll be here d'rectly, sor--an'--an' I hope that'll be all.  But it's alive ye are, is it?  An' didn't I take ye for dead.  Oh!

CHAPTER TWO.  HEADQUARTERS--THE MEN--DISPUTATION AND UNCERTAINTY--NEW USES FOR THE SKINS OF DEAD BOYS!--MUTINOUS RESOLVES.  Moose Fort, the headquarters and depot of the fur-traders, who prosecute their traffic in almost all parts of the wild and uninhabited regions of North America, stands on an island near the mouth of Moose River.  Like all the establishments of the fur-traders, it is a solitary group of wooden buildings, far removed beyond the influences--almost beyond the ken--of the civilised world, and surrounded by the primeval wilderness, the only tenants of which were, at the time we write of, a few scattered tribes of Muskigon Indians, and the wild animals whose flesh furnished them with food and whose skins constituted their sole wealth.  There was little of luxury at Moose Fort.  The walls of the houses within the stockade, that served more as an ornament than a defence, were of painted, in some cases unpainted, planks.  The floors, ceilings, chairs, tables, and, in short, all the articles of furniture in the place, were made of the same rough material.  A lofty scaffolding of wood rose above the surrounding buildings, and served as an outlook, whence, at the proper season, longing eyes were wont to be turned towards the sea in expectation of \"the ship\" which paid the establishment an annual visit from England.  Several large iron field-pieces stood before the front gate; but they were more for the sake of appearance than use, and were never fired except for the purpose of saluting the said ship on the occasions of her arrival and departure.  The first boom of the cannon unlocks the long-closed portals of connection between Moose Fort and England; the second salvo shuts them up again in their frozen domains for another year!  A century and a half ago, the band of \"adventurers trading into Hudson's Bay\" felled the first trees and pitched their tents on the shores of James's Bay, and successive generations of fur-traders have kept the post until the present day; yet there is scarcely a symptom of the presence of man beyond a few miles round the establishment.  Years ago the fort was built, and there it stands now, with new tenants, it is true, but in its general aspect unchanged; and there it is likely to remain, wrapped in its barrier of all but impregnable solitude, for centuries to come.  Nevertheless, Moose is a comfortable place in its way, and when contrasted with other trading establishments is a very palace and temple of luxury.  There are men within its walls who can tell of log-huts and starvation, solitude and desolation, compared with which Moose is a terrestrial paradise.  Frank Morton, whom we have introduced in the first chapter, said, on his arrival at Moose, that it appeared to him to be the very fag-end of creation.  He had travelled night and day for six weeks from what he considered the very outskirts of civilisation, through uninhabited forests and almost unknown rivers, in order to get to it; and while the feeling of desolation that overwhelmed him on his first arrival was strong upon him, he sighed deeply, and called it a \"horrid dull hole.\"  But Frank was of a gay, hearty, joyous disposition, and had not been there long ere he loved the old fort dearly.  Poor fellow! far removed though he was from his fellow-men at Moose, he afterwards learned that he had but obtained an indistinct notion of the signification of the word \"solitude.\"  There were probably about thirty human beings at Moose, when Mr George Stanley, one of the principal fur-traders of the place, received orders from the governor to make preparations, and select men, for the purpose of proceeding many hundred miles deeper into the northern wilderness, and establishing a station on the distant, almost unknown, shores of Ungava Bay.  No one at Moose had ever been there before; no one knew anything about the route, except from the vague report of a few Indians; and the only thing that was definitely known about the locality at all was, that its inhabitants were a few wandering tribes of Esquimaux, who were at deadly feud with the Indians, and generally massacred all who came within their reach.  What the capabilities of the country were, in regard to timber and provisions, nobody knew, and, fortunately for the success of the expedition, nobody cared!  At least those who were to lead the way did not; and this admirable quality of total indifference to prospective dangers is that which, to a great extent, insures success in a forlorn hope.  Of the leaders of this expedition the reader already knows something. George Stanley was nearly six feet high, forty years of age, and endued with a decision of character that, but for his quiet good humour, would have been deemed obstinacy.  He was deliberate in all his movements, and exercised a control over his feelings that quite concealed his naturally enthusiastic disposition.  Moreover, he was married, and had a daughter of ten years of age.  This might be thought a disadvantage in his present circumstances; but the governor of the fur-traders, a most energetic and active ruler, thought otherwise.  He recommended that the family should be left at Moose until an establishment had been built, and a winter passed at Ungava.  Afterwards they could join him there. As for Frank Morton, he was an inch taller than his friend Stanley, and equally powerful; fair-haired, blue-eyed, hilarious, romantic, twenty-two years of age, and so impulsive that, on hearing of the proposed expedition from one of his comrades, who happened to be present when Stanley was reading the dispatches, he sprang from his chair, which he upset, dashed out at the door, which he banged, and hurried to his friend's quarters in order to be first to volunteer his services as second in command; which offer was rendered unnecessary by Stanley's exclaiming, the moment he entered his room--  \"Ha, Frank, my lad, the very man I wanted to see!  Here's a letter from headquarters ordering me off on an expedition to Ungava.  Now, I want volunteers; will you go!\"  It is needless to add that Frank's blue eyes sparkled with animation as he seized his friend's hand and replied, \"To the North Pole if you like, or farther if need be!\"  It was evening.  The sun was gilding the top of the flagstaff with a parting kiss, and the inhabitants of Moose Fort, having finished their daily toil, were making preparations for their evening meal.  On the end of the wharf that jutted out into the stream was assembled a picturesque group of men, who, from the earnest manner in which they conversed, and the energy of their gesticulations, were evidently discussing a subject of more than ordinary interest.  Most of them were clad in corduroy trousers, gartered below the knee with thongs of deer-skin, and coarse, striped cotton shirts, open at the neck, so as to expose their sunburnt breasts.  A few wore caps which, whatever might have been their original form, were now so much soiled and battered out of shape by long and severe service that they were nondescript; but most of these hardy backwoodsmen were content with the covering afforded by their thick, bushy locks.  \"No, no,\" exclaimed a short, thick-set, powerful man, with a somewhat ascetic cast of countenance; \"I've seen more than enough o' these rascally Huskies [Esquimaux].  'Tis well for me that I'm here this blessed day, an' not made into a dan to bob about in Hudson's Straits at the tail of a white whale, like that poor boy Peter who was shot by them varmints.\"  \"What's a dan?\" asked a young half-breed who had lately arrived at Moose, and knew little of Esquimau implements.  \"What a green-horn you must be, Francois, not to know what a dan is!\" replied another, who was inclined to be quizzical.  \"Why, it's a sort of sea-carriage that the Esquimaux tie to the tail of a walrus or sea-horse when they feel inclined for a drive.  When they can't get a sea-horse they catch a white whale asleep, and wake him up after fastening the dan to his tail.  I suppose they have conjurers or wizards among them, since Massan told us just now that poor Peter was--\"  \"Bah! gammon,\" interrupted Francois with a smile, as he turned to the first speaker.  \"But tell me, Massan, what is a dan?\"  \"It's a sort o' float or buoy, lad, used by the Huskies, and is made out o' the skin o' the seal.  They tie it with a long line to their whale spears to show which way the fish bolts when struck.\"  \"And did they use Peter's skin for such a purpose?\" inquired Francois earnestly.  \"They did,\" replied Massan.  \"And did you see them do it?\"  \"Yes, I did.\"  Francois gazed intently into his comrade's face as he spoke; but Massan was an adept at what is usually called drawing the long bow, and it was with the most imperturbable gravity that he continued--  \"Yes, I saw them do it; but I could not render any assistance to the poor child, for I was lying close behind a rock at the time, with an arrow sticking between my shoulders, and a score o' them oily varmints a-shoutin', and yellin', and flourishing their spears in search o' me.\"  \"Tell us how it happened, Massan.  Let's hear the story,\" chorused the men, as they closed round their comrade.  \"Well then,\" began the stout backwoodsman, proceeding leisurely to fill his pipe from an ornamented bag that hung at his belt, \"here goes.  It was about the year--a--I forget the year, but it don't matter--that we were ordered off on an expedition to the Huskies; 'xactly sich a one as they wants us to go on now, and--but you've heerd o' that business, lads, haven't you?\"  \"Yes, yes, we've heard all about it; go on.\"  \"Well,\" continued Massan, \"I needn't be wastin' time tellin' you how we failed in that affair, and how the Huskies killed some of our men and burnt our ship to the water's edge.  After it was all over, and they thought they had killed us all, I was, as I said, lyin'"]]]
