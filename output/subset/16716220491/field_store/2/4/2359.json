In Dr Thomson's _History of Chemistry_, an anecdote, related by Mr Benjamin Bell, refers to this as follows:--  \"Soon after the appearance of Mr Cavendish's paper on hydrogen gas, in which he made an approximation to the specific gravity of that body, showing that it was at least ten times lighter than common air, Dr Black invited a party of friends to supper, informing them that he had a curiosity to show them.  Dr Hutton, Mr Clerk of Eldin, and Sir George Clerk of Penicuik, were of the number.  When the company invited had arrived, he took them into a room where he had the allantois of a calf filled with hydrogen gas, and, upon setting it at liberty, it immediately ascended and adhered to the ceiling.  The phenomenon was easily accounted for; it was taken for granted that a small black thread had been attached to the allantois, that the thread passed through the ceiling, and that some one in the apartment above, by pulling the thread, elevated it to the ceiling, and kept it in its position!  This explanation was so plausible, that it was agreed to by the whole company, though, like many other plausible theories, it turned out wholly fallacious, for, when the allantois was brought down, no thread whatever was found attached to it.  Dr Black explained the cause of the ascent to his admiring friends; but such was his carelessness of his own reputation, that he never gave the least account of this curious experiment even to his class, and several years elapsed before this obvious property of hydrogen gas was applied to the elevation of balloons.\"  Cavallo made the first practical attempts with hydrogen gas six years later, but he only succeeded in causing soap-bubbles to ascend.  At last the art of aerial navigation was discovered in France, and in 1782 the first ascent was made.  The triumph was achieved by Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, sons of a wealthy paper-maker who dwelt at Annonay, on the banks of a rivulet which flows into the Rhone, not far from Lyons.  These brothers were remarkable men.  Although bred in a remote provincial town, and without the benefit of a liberal education, they were possessed in a high degree of ingenuity and the spirit of observation.  They educated themselves, and acquired an unusually large stock of information, which their inventive and original minds led them to apply in new fields of speculation.  They were associated in business with their father, a man who passed his quiet days like a patriarch amidst a large family and a numerous body of dependants, until he reached the advanced age of ninety-three.  Stephen devoted himself chiefly to the study of mathematics, Joseph to chemistry; and they were accustomed to form their plans in concert.  It appears that they had long contemplated, with philosophical interest, the floating and ascent of clouds in the air, and when they heard of or read Cavendish's theories in regard to _different kinds of air_, it at once struck them that by enclosing some gas lighter than the atmosphere in a bag, a weight might be raised from the earth into the air.  The brothers Montgolfier were men of that vigorous stamp who act promptly on receiving their convictions.  At once they set about experimenting, and constructed large bags of paper,--the substance which naturally came readiest to their hands, and which appeared to them to be best suited to their purpose.  These were filled with hydrogen gas, which raised them to the ceiling; but, owing to the escape of the gas through the pores and cracks of the case, those embryo balloons descended in a few minutes.  Instead of varnishing the paper to prevent the escape of the gas, and supposing, erroneously, that the fault lay in the latter, they sought about for a new gas more suitable to the paper. This they found, as they supposed, in the gas which resulted from the combustion of wet straw and wool, which had an upward tendency, they thought, on account of its electrical properties, which caused it to be repelled from the ground.  It is scarcely necessary now to point out that the true cause of the upward tendency lay in the rarefaction of the air by the heat of the fire, and that hot air has a tendency to rise because its bulk is greatly increased beyond the same quantity of the surrounding cold air.  Although wrong in assigning the cause of the result, they were right in the application of it.  While on a visit to Avignon Joseph Montgolfier procured a silk bag having a small opening at its lower end, and a capacity of about fifty cubic feet.  Under the orifice some paper was burnt; the air inside was heated and expanded so as to fill the bag, which, when let go, soared rapidly up to the height of seventy or eighty feet, where it remained until the air cooled and allowed it to descend. Thus did the _first_ balloon ascend in the month of November 1782.  Delighted with their success, the indefatigable brothers resolved to make further experiment on a larger scale.  They procured a quantity of packcloth or coarse linen, formed it into a globe about ninety feet in circumference, lined it with paper, and lighted a fire under it in an iron choffer.  This balloon went up with a force which they estimated as equivalent to 500 pounds.  After this the Montgolfiers appeared to have become ambitious of accomplishing greater things, and giving to their discoveries publicity; for we are told that, \"they invited the members of the provincial meeting of the states of the Vivarais, then assembled at Annonay, to witness the first _public_ aerial ascent.  On the 5th June 1783, amidst a very large concourse of spectators, the spherical bag or balloon, consisting of different pieces of linen, merely buttoned together, was suspended from cross poles.  Two men kindled a fire under it, and kept feeding the flame with small bundles of chopped straw.  The loose bag gradually swelled, assuming a graceful form, and in the space of five minutes it was completely distended, and made such an effort to escape that eight men were required to hold it down.  \"On a signal being given the stays were slipped, and the balloon instantly rose with an accelerating motion till it reached some height, when its velocity continued uniform, and carried it to an elevation of more than a mile.  All was admiration and transport.  Amidst the shouts of unbounded applause, the progress of the artificial cloud retiring from sight arrested every eye.  It was hurried along by the wind; but its buoyant force being soon spent, it remained suspended only ten minutes, and fell gently in a vineyard at a distance of about a mile and a half from the place of its ascension.  So memorable a feat lighted up the glow of national vanity, and the two Montgolfiers were hailed and exalted by the spontaneous impulse of their fellow-citizens.\"  This event created a sensation not only in France but over the whole of Europe.  In Paris, particularly, the effect on all classes was so great that they determined to have the experiment repeated, set a subscription on foot, and appointed a scientific man named Charles, and two brothers of the name of Robert, to construct a balloon.  This they did, but instead of applying the Montgolfier motive power--heated air--they used hydrogen gas, procured by the action of diluted sulphuric acid upon iron filings.  Their balloon, which was made of thin silk, varnished with a solution of elastic gum, was a much nearer approach to the balloon of modern days than that of Montgolfier.  It was a great success; it rose and remained suspended at a height of 100 feet, in which state it was conveyed with acclamation to the Place des Victoires, where it rested and underwent some repairs.  At midnight it was conveyed in solemn procession by torchlight, and guarded by a detachment of horse, to the Champ de Mars, where, on the following day, the whole world of Paris turned out to witness another ascent.  The balloon went up to the sound of cannon, and in two minutes reached a height of 3000 feet, when it was lost for a time in a dark cloud, but speedily reappeared still higher. After a flight of fifteen miles, performed in three-quarters of an hour, it sunk to the ground in a field near Ecouen, where it was secured by the peasants.  The Parisians now appeared to become balloon-mad.  The Royal Academy of Sciences invited Joseph Montgolfier to repeat his experiments, and another balloon was prepared by him of coarse linen with a paper lining, which, however, was destroyed by incessant and violent rain before it could be tried.  Undeterred by this, another was constructed by him, which ascended from Versailles on the 19th of September 1783.  This balloon deserves peculiar notice as being the first which carried up living creatures.  A sheep, a cockerel, and a duck, were the first aeronauts!  They ascended to a height of about 1500 feet; remained suspended for a time, and descended some two miles off in perfect safety--indeed we may say in perfect comfort, for the sheep was discovered to be quietly feeding when it returned to the earth!  The practicability of ballooning being now fairly established, men soon began to venture their own persons in the frail cars.  A young and enthusiastic naturalist named Rozier leaped into the car of another of Montgolfier's balloons soon after this, and ascended in safety to an elevation of about 300 feet, but on this occasion the balloon was held down by ropes.  The ice, however, was broken, and bolder attempts quickly followed.    CHAPTER THREE.  EARLY ATTEMPTS AT AERIAL NAVIGATION.  The first free and unfettered balloon voyage was performed very soon after the event mentioned at the end of the last chapter.  It was a daring attempt, and attended with great danger.  A balloon made by Montgolfier was used.  It was 75 feet high, 45 feet wide, and spheroidal in form--heated air being the motive power.  The bold aeronauts, on this occasion, were the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21709"],["title","The Walrus Hunters: A Romance of the Realms of Ice (#1)"],["body","a large grey goose under his belt.  At his side, leaning against a tree, was the long-barrelled fowling-piece, which he had just reloaded.  It was one of those common, cheap, flint-lock affairs which were supplied by the fur-traders in those days.  The Indian was a tall, powerfully built middle-aged man, and, from his look and manner, was evidently unsuspicious of the presence of a foe. He seemed to be quite alone.  The Eskimo poised his light spear, but hesitated to launch it.  He shrank from killing a defenceless foe.  The hesitation betrayed him, for at the moment the sharp ear of the red man heard, and his eye discovered him.  The gun flew to the Indian's shoulder, and the Eskimo launched his spear, but by good fortune both weapons failed.  The well-directed spear was cleverly dodged, and the gun missed fire.  To re-cock the weapon, take a more deadly aim, and pull the trigger, was the work of three seconds; but again the flint proved faithless. Cheenbuk, however, divined the meaning of the attempt, and sprang upon his foe to prevent a repetition of the action, though he was now practically unarmed,--for the little stone knife which he carried in his bosom was but ill suited for deadly combat.  The Indian clubbed his gun to meet the onset, but the Eskimo, evading the first blow, caught hold of the weapon with both hands, and now began a fierce and prolonged struggle for possession of the \"fire-spouter.\"  Both hands of each combatant being engaged, neither could venture to draw his knife, and, as the men were pretty equally matched, both as to size and strength, they swayed to and fro with desperate energy for a considerable time, each endeavouring to throw the other, while the sweat poured down their faces and their breathing came in fitful gasps.  At length there was a pause in the conflict.  It seemed as if they had stopped by mutual consent to recover breath for a final effort.  As they glared into each other's faces, each felt surprised to see little or nothing of the evidence of that deadly hatred which usually characterises implacable foes.  Suddenly Cheenbuk relaxed his grip of the gun and stepped back a pace.  In so doing he put himself, to some extent at least, at the mercy of his adversary.  With quick perception the Indian recognised the fact.  He drew himself up and dropped the gun on the ground.  \"Why should we fight?  The hunting-grounds are wide enough!\" he said, in the grave sententious tones peculiar to his race.  \"That is just what came to my thought when I let go,\" answered the more matter-of-fact Eskimo.  \"Let us part, then, as friends,\" returned the red man, \"and let us do it in the manner of the pale-faced traders.\"  He extended his right hand as he spoke.  Cheenbuk, who had heard a rumour of the white man's customs--probably from men of his race who had met with the crews of whalers--advanced, grasped the extended hand, and shook it in a way that might have done credit to any Englishman!  He smiled at the same time with a slightly humorous expression, but the other maintained his solemnity.  Fun is not a prominent characteristic of the red man.  \"But there is no need that we should part before feeding,\" said the Eskimo.  \"Waugh!\" replied the Indian, by which it is to be presumed he signified assent.  The reconciled foes being both adepts in the art of cookery, and--one of them at least--in woodcraft, it was not long before a large fire was blazing under a convenient fir-tree, and the grey goose soon hissed pleasantly in front of it.  They were a quiet and self-contained couple, however, and went about their work in profound silence.  Not that they lacked ideas or language--for each, being naturally a good linguist, had somehow acquired a smattering of the other's tongue,--but they resembled each other in their disinclination to talk without having something particular to say, and in their inclination to quietness and sobriety of demeanour.  Here, however, the resemblance ceased, for while the Eskimo was free and easy, ready to learn and to sympathise, and quick to see and appreciate a joke, the Indian was sternly conservative, much impressed with his own rectitude of intention, as well as his capacity for action, and absolutely devoid of the slightest tinge of humour.  Thus the Eskimo's expression varied somewhat with the nature of the subjects which chased each other through his mind, while that of the red man never changed from the calm of dignified immobility--except, of course, when, as during the recent struggle, his life was in danger.  While the goose was roasting, the erstwhile foes sat down to watch the process.  They had not to watch long, for the fire was strong and neither of them was particular.  Indeed, the Eskimo would gladly have eaten his portion raw, but waited patiently, out of deference to what he deemed his companion's prejudices.  \"You are alone?\" said the Eskimo interrogatively.  \"Yes--alone,\" returned the Indian.  To such men, this was mental food for at least a quarter of an hour.  By the end of that time one side of the bird was sufficiently done.  The Indian turned the stick on which it was impaled, drew his scalping-knife, and commenced on the side that was ready while the other side was being done.  Cheenbuk drew his stone knife, cut a large slice of the breast, and also fell to work.  They ate vigorously, yet the process was not soon over, for the goose was large and their appetites were strong.  Of course they had no time or inclination for conversation during the meal.  When it was finished, the grey goose was reduced to a miserable skeleton.  Then both men sighed the sigh of contentment, wiped their knives on the grass, and looked gravely at each other.  Cheenbuk seemed as if about to speak, but was arrested in his intention by the strange and unaccountable proceedings of his companion, who now drew forth a gaily decorated bag which hung at his belt behind him. From this he extracted a whitish implement with a little bowl at one end, and having leisurely filled it with a brown substance, also drawn from the bag, he put the other or small end of the instrument between his teeth.  Then he took up a burning stick and applied it to the bowl.  The Eskimo had been gazing at him with ever-widening eyes, but at this his mouth also began to open, and he gave vent to a gentle \"ho!\" of unutterable surprise, for immediately there burst from the Indian's lips a puff of smoke as if he had suddenly become a gun, or fire-spouter and gone off unexpectedly.  There was profound interest as well as astonishment in the gaze of our Eskimo, for he now became aware that he was about to witness a remarkable custom of the red men, of which he had often heard, but which he had never clearly understood.  \"Does it not burn?\" he asked in breathless curiosity.  \"No,\" replied his friend.  \"Do you like it?  Hi--i!\"  The exclamation was induced by the Indian, who at the moment sent a stream of smoke from each nostril, shut his eyes as he did so, opened his mouth, and otherwise exhibited symptoms of extreme felicity.  \"Would you like to try it?\" he asked after one or two more whiffs.  Cheenbuk accepted the offer and the pipe, drew a voluminous whiff down into his lungs and exploded in a violent fit of coughing, while the tears overflowed his eyes.  \"Try again,\" said the Indian gravely.  For some minutes the Eskimo found it difficult to speak; then he returned the pipe, saying, \"No.  My inside is not yet tough like yours. I will look--and wonder!\"  After being admired--with wonder--for a considerable time, the Indian looked at his companion earnestly, again offered him the pipe, and said, \"Try again.\"  The obliging Eskimo tried again, but with the caution of a child who, having been burnt, dreads the fire.  He drew in a little smoke by means of the power of inhalation and choked again slightly, but, being now on his mettle, he resolved not to be beaten.  The Indian regarded him meanwhile with grave approval.  Then it occurred to Cheenbuk to apply the power of suction instead of inhalation.  It was successful.  He filled his mouth instead of his lungs, and, in his childlike delight at the triumph, he opened his mouth to its full extent, and sent forth a cloud with a gasp which was the combined expression of a puff and a \"ho!\"  Again he tried it, and was again successful.  Overjoyed at this, like a child with a new toy, he went in for quite a broadside of puffs, looking round at his friendly foe with a \"ho!\" between each, and surrounding his head with an atmosphere of smoke.  Suddenly he stopped, laid down the pipe, rose up, and, looking as if he had forgotten something, retired into the bush.  The Indian took up the discarded pipe, and for the first time displayed a few wrinkles about the corners of his eyes as he put it between his lips.  Presently Cheenbuk returned, somewhat paler than before, and sat down in silence with a look, as if of regret, at the skeleton-goose.  Without any reference to what had passed, the Indian turned to his companion and said, \"Why should the men of the ice fight with the men of the woods?\"  \"Why?\" asked Cheenbuk, after a few moments' profound meditation, \"why should the men of the woods attack the men of the ice with their fire-spouters?\"  This question seemed to puzzle the Indian so much that he proceeded to fill another pipe before answering it.  Meanwhile the Eskimo, being more active-minded, continued--  \"Is it fair for the men of the woods to come to fight us with fire-spouters when we have only spears?  Meet us with the same weapons, and then we shall see which are the best men.\"  The Indian looked at his companion solemnly and shook his head.  \"The strongest warriors and the best fighters,\" he said, \"are not always the best men.  He who hunts well, keeps his wives supplied with plenty of food and deerskin robes, and is kind to his children, is the best man.\"  Cheenbuk looked suddenly in the face of his sententious companion with earnest"]]]
