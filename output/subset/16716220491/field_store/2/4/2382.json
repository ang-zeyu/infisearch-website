In fact, it is this pushing process which causes the end of the tongue to shed its bergs, because, when the point is thrust into deep water and floats, the motion of the sea cracks the floating mass off from that pail which is still aground, and lets it drift away.  Now it was to these ice-cliffs that the somewhat reckless giant betook himself.  Although not well acquainted with that region, or fully alive to the extent of the danger incurred, his knowledge was sufficient to render him cautious in the selection of the position which should form his outlook.  And a magnificent sight indeed presented itself when he took his stand among the glittering pinnacles.  Far as the eye could reach, the sea lay stretched in the sunshine, calm as a mill-pond, and sparkling with ice-jewels of every shape and size.  An Arctic haze, dry and sunny, seemed to float over all like golden gauze.  Not only was the sun encircled by a beautiful halo, but also by those lovely lights of the Arctic regions known as parhelia, or mock-suns.  Four of these made no mean display in emulation of their great original.  On the horizon, refraction caused the ice-floes and bergs to present endless variety of fantastic forms, and in the immediate foreground--at the giant's feet-- tremendous precipices of ice went sheer down into the deep water, while, away to the right, where a bay still retained its winter grasp of an ice-field, could be seen, like white bee-hives, the temporary snow-huts of these wandering Eskimos.  Well might the eye, as well as the head, of the so-called savage rise upwards while he pondered the great mystery of the Maker of all!  As he stood on the giddy ledge, rapt in contemplation, an event occurred which was fitted to deepen the solemnity of his thoughts.  Not twenty yards from the point on which he stood, a great ice-cliff--the size of an average house--snapped off with a rending crash, and went thundering down into the deep, which seemed to boil and heave with sentient emotion as it received the mass, and swallowed it in a turmoil indescribable.  Chingatok sprang from his post and sought a safer but not less lofty outlook, while the new-born berg, rising from the sea, swayed majestically to and fro in its new-found cradle.  \"It is not understandable,\" muttered the giant as he took up his new position and gazed with feelings of awe upon the grand scene.  \"I wonder if the pale-faced men in the floating islands think much about these things.  Perhaps they dwell in a land which is still more wonderful than this, and hunt the walrus and the seal like us.  It is said they come for nothing else but to see our land and find out what is in it.  Why should I not go to see their land?  My kayak is large, though it has no wings.  The land may be far off, but am I not strong?  They are pale-faced; perhaps the reason is that they are starved.  That must be so, else they would not leave their home.  I might bring some of the poor creatures to this happy land of ours, where there is always plenty to eat.  They might send messengers for their relations to come and dwell with us.  I will speak to mother about that; she is wise!\"  Like a dutiful son, the giant turned on his heel, descended the cliffs, and went straight home to consult with his mother.    CHAPTER TWO.  UNEXPECTED MEETINGS, ALARMS, AND CONFIDENCES.  \"Mother, I have been thinking,\" said Chingatok, as he crept into his hut and sat down on a raised bench of moss.  \"That is not news, my son; you think much.  You are not like other men. They think little and eat much.\"  The stout little woman looked up through the smoke of her cooking-lamp and smiled, but her big son was too much absorbed in his thoughts to observe her pleasantry, so she continued the cooking of a walrus chop in silence.  \"The Kablunets are not to be seen, mother,\" resumed Chingatok.  \"I have looked for them every day for a long time, and begin to weary.  My thought is now to launch my kayak when we come to open water, load it with meat, take four spears and more lines than a strong hunter needs for a whole season; then paddle away south to discover the land of the Kablunets.  They must be poor; they may be starving.  I will guide them to our home, and show them this land of plenty.\"  He paused abruptly, and looked at his mother with solemn anxiety, for he was well aware that he had given her food for profound reflection.  We feel tempted here to repeat our remark about the strong resemblance between different members of the human family, but refrain.  This untutored woman of the Arctic lands met her son's proposition with the well-known reply of many civilised persons.  \"Of what use would it be, my son?  No good can come of searching out these poor lands.  You cannot benefit the miserable Kablunets.  Perhaps they are savage and fierce; and you are sure to meet with dangers by the way.  Worse--you may die!\"  \"Mother,\" returned Chingatok, \"when the white bear stands up with his claws above my head and his mouth a-gape, does my hand tremble or my spear fail?\"  \"No, my son.\"  \"Then why do you speak to me of danger and death?\"  Toolooha was not gifted with argumentative powers.  She relapsed into silence and lamp-smoke.  But her son was not to be so easily dissuaded.  He adopted a line of reasoning which never failed.  \"Mother,\" he said, sadly, \"it may be that you are right, and I am of too fearful a spirit to venture far away from you by myself; I will remain here if you think me a coward.\"  \"Don't say so, Chingatok.  You know what I think.  Go, if you must go, but who will hunt for your poor old mother when you are gone?\"  This was an appeal which the astute little woman knew to be very powerful with her son.  She buried her head in the smoke again, and left the question to simmer.  Chingatok was tender-hearted.  He said nothing, but, as usual, he thought much, as he gazed in a contemplative manner at his oily parent, and there is no saying to what lengths of self-sacrifice he would have gone if he had not been aroused, and his thoughts scattered to the winds, by a yell so tremendous that it might well have petrified him on the spot.  But it did nothing of the kind.  It only caused him to drop on his knees, dart through the tunnel like an eel, spring into the open air like an electrified rabbit from its burrow, and stand up with a look of blazing interrogation on his huge countenance.  The cry had been uttered by his bosom friend and former playmate Oolichuk, who came running towards him with frantic gesticulations.  \"The Kablunets!\" he gasped, \"the white-faces have come!--on a floating island!--alive!--smoking!--it is all true!\"  \"Where?\" demanded our giant, whose face blazed up at once.  \"There!\" cried Oolichuk, pointing seaward towards the ice-hummocks with both hands, and glaring up at his friend.  Without another word Chingatok ran off in the direction pointed out, followed hotly by his friend.  Oolichuk was a large and powerful man, but, his legs were remarkably short.  His pace, compared with that of Chingatok, was as that of a sparrow to an ostrich.  Nevertheless he kept up, for he was agile and vigorous.  \"Have you seen them--have you spoken?\" asked the giant, abruptly.  \"Yes, all the tribe was there.\"  \"No one killed?\"  \"No, but terribly frightened; they made me run home to fetch you.\"  Chingatok increased his speed.  So did Oolichuk.  While they run, let us leap a little ahead of them, reader, and see what had caused all the excitement.  The whole party had gone off that morning, with the exception of Chingatok and his mother, to spear seals in a neighbouring bay, where these animals had been discovered in great numbers.  Dogs and sledges had been taken, because a successful hunt was expected, and the ice was sufficiently firm.  The bay was very large.  At its distant southern extremity there rose a great promontory which jutted far out into the sea.  While the men were busy there making preparations to begin the hunt, Oblooria, Chingatok's little sister, amused herself by mounting a hummock of ice about thirty feet high.  When there, she chanced to look towards the promontory.  Instantly she opened her eyes and mouth and uttered a squeal that brought her friends running to her side.  Oolichuk was the first to reach her.  He had no need to ask questions. Oblooria's gaze directed his, and there, coming round the promontory, he beheld an object which had never before filled his wondering eyes.  It was, apparently, a monstrous creature with a dark body and towering wings, and a black thing in its middle, from which were vomited volumes of smoke.  \"Kablunets! white men!\" he yelled.  \"Kablunets!--huk! huk!\" echoed the whole tribe, as they scrambled up the ice-hill one after another.  And they were right.  A vessel of the pale-faces had penetrated these northern solitudes, and was advancing swiftly before a light breeze under sail and steam.  Despite the preparation their minds had received, and the fact that they were out in search of these very people, this sudden appearance of them filled most of the Eskimos with alarm--some of them with absolute terror, insomuch that the term \"pale-face\" became most appropriate to themselves.  \"What shall we do?\" exclaimed Akeetolik, one of the men.  \"Fly!\" cried Ivitchuk, another of the men, whose natural courage was not high.  \"No; let us stay and behold!\" said Oolichuk, with a look of contempt at his timid comrade.  \"Yes, stay and see,\" said Eemerk sternly.  \"But they will kill us,\" faltered the young woman, whom we have already mentioned by the name of Tekkona.  \"No--no one would kill _you_,\" said Eemerk gallantly; \"they would only carry you off and keep you.\"  While they conversed with eager, anxious looks, the steam yacht--for such she was--advanced rapidly, threading her way among the ice-fields and floes with graceful rapidity and ease, to the unutterable amazement of the natives.  Although her sails were spread"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21734"],["title","The Golden Dream: Adventures in the Far West (#1)"],["body","across his capacious chest, and, being much too short, shewed a very undignified amount of braces below it.  \"Uncle!\" exclaimed Ned Sinton, rushing up to his relative, \"what _can_ be the meaning of all this?  Everybody seems to be mad.  I think you must be mad yourself, to come here such a figure as that; and I'm quite sure _I_ shall go mad if you don't explain it to me.  What _does_ it all mean?\"  \"California,\" replied Mr Shirley, becoming more sarcastic in expression and less pitiful.  \"Why, that's what everybody cries,\" exclaimed Ned, who was now driven almost to desperation.  \"My dear uncle, do look like yourself and exercise some of your wonted sagacity.  Just glance round at the cave and the company, all made of gold, and look at me--gold too, if not pinchbeck, but I'm not a good-enough judge of metals to tell which. What _has_ done it, uncle?  _Do_ look in a better humour, and tell me how it has happened.\"  \"California,\" replied Mr Shirley.  \"Yes, yes; I know that.  California seems to be everything here.  But how has it come about?  Why are _you_ here, and what has brought me here?\"  \"California,\" repeated Mr Shirley.  \"Uncle, I'll go deranged if you don't answer me.  What do you mean?\"  \"California,\" reiterated Mr Shirley.  At the same moment a stout golden lady with a filigree turban shouted, \"for ever!\" at the top of a very shrill voice, and immediately the company took up the cry again, filling the cave with deafening sounds.  Ned Sinton gave one look of despair at his relative--then turned and fled.  \"Put him out,\" shouted the company.  \"Down with the intruder!\"  Ned cast a single glance backward, and beheld the people pushing and buffeting his uncle in a most unceremonious manner.  His helmet was knocked down over his eyes, and the coat--so much too small for him--was rendered an easy fit by being ripped up behind to the neck.  Ned could not stand this.  He was stout of limb and bold as a lion, although not naturally addicted to fighting, so he turned suddenly round and flew to the rescue.  Plunging into the midst of the struggling mass of golden creatures, Ned hit out right and left like a young Hercules, and his blows rang upon their metal chests and noses like the sound of sledge-hammers, but without any other effect.  Suddenly he experienced an acute sensation of pain, and--awoke to find himself hammering the bed-post with bleeding knuckles, and his uncle standing beside his bed chuckling immensely.  \"O uncle,\" cried Ned, sitting up in his bed, and regarding his knuckles with a perplexed expression of countenance, \"I've had _such_ an extraordinary dream!\"  \"Ay, Ned,\" interrupted his uncle, \"and all about California, I'll be bound.\"  \"Why, how did you guess that?\"  \"It needs not a wizard to guess that, lad.  I've observed that you have read nothing in the newspapers for the last three months but the news from the gold-diggings of California.  Your mind has of late been constantly running on that subject, and it is well-known that day-dreams are often reproduced at night.  Besides, I heard you shouting the word in your sleep as I entered your room.  Were you fighting with gold-diggers, eh! or Indians?\"  \"Neither, uncle; but I was fighting with very strange beings, I assure you, and--\"  \"Well, well,\" interrupted Mr Shirley, \"never mind the dream just now; we shall have it at some other time.  I have important matters to talk over with you, my boy.  Morton has written to me.  Get up and come down as quickly as you can, and we'll discuss the matter over our breakfast.\"  As the door closed after the retreating form of his uncle, Edward Sinton leaped out of bed and into his trousers.  During his toilet he wondered what matters of importance Mr Shirley could intend to discuss with him, and felt half inclined to fear, from the grave expression of his uncle's face when he spoke of it, that something of a disagreeable nature awaited him.  But these thoughts were intermingled with reminiscences of the past night.  His knuckles, too, kept constantly reminding him of his strange encounter, and, do what he would, he could not banish from his mind the curious incidents of that remarkable golden dream.    CHAPTER TWO.  OUR HERO.  We have entered thus minutely into the details of our hero's dream, because it was the climax to a long series of day-dreams, in which he had indulged ever since the discovery of gold in California.  Edward Sinton was a youth of eighteen at the time of which we write, and an orphan.  He was tall, strong, broad-shouldered, fair-haired, blue-eyed, Roman-nosed, and gentle as a lamb.  This last statement may perhaps appear inconsistent with the fact that, during the whole course of his school-life, he had a pitched battle every week--sometimes two or three in the week.  Ned never began a fight, and, indeed, did not like fighting.  But some big boys _will_ domineer over little ones, and Ned would not be domineered over; consequently he had to be thrashed.  He was possessed, even in boyhood, of an amount of physical courage that would have sufficed for any two ordinary men.  He did not boast.  He did not quarrel.  He never struck the first blow, but, if twenty boys had attacked him, he would have tried to fight them all.  He never tyrannised over small boys.  It was not his nature to do so; but he was not perfect, any more than you are, dear reader.  He sometimes punched small boys' heads when they worried him, though he never did so without repenting of it, and doing them a kindness afterwards in order to make up.  He was very thoughtless, too, and very careless; nevertheless he was fond of books--specially of books of adventure--and studied these like a hero--as he was.  Boys of his own size, or even a good deal bigger, never fought with Ned Sinton.  They knew better than that; but they adored him, in some cases envied him, and in all cases trusted and followed him.  It was only _very_ big boys who fought with him, and all they got by it was a good deal of hard pummelling before they floored their little adversary, and a good deal of jeering from their comrades for fighting a small boy. From one cause or another, Ned's visage was generally scratched, often cut, frequently swelled, and almost always black and blue.  But as Ned grew older, the occasions for fighting became less frequent; his naturally amiable disposition improved, (partly owing, no doubt, to the care of his uncle, who was, in every sense of the term, a good old man,) and when he attained the age of fifteen and went to college, and was called \"Sinton,\" instead of \"Ned,\" his fighting days were over.  No man in his senses would have ventured to attack that strapping youth with the soft blue eyes, the fair hair, the prominent nose, and the firm but smiling lips, or, if he had, he would have had to count on an hour's extremely hard work, whether the fortune of war went for or against him.  When Ned had been three years at college, his uncle hinted that it was time to think of a profession, and suggested that as he was a first-rate mathematician, and had been fond of mechanics from his childhood, he should turn an engineer.  Ned would probably have agreed to this cheerfully, had not a thirst for adventure been created by the stirring accounts which had begun to arrive at this time from the recently-discovered gold-fields of California.  His enthusiastic spirit was stirred, not so much by the prospect of making a large fortune suddenly by the finding of a huge nugget--although that was a very pleasant idea--as by the hope of meeting with wild adventures in that imperfectly-known and distant land.  And the effect of such dreams was to render the idea of sitting down to an engineer's desk, or in a mercantile counting-room, extremely distasteful.  Thus it came to pass that Edward Sinton felt indisposed to business, and disposed to indulge in golden visions.  When he entered the breakfast-parlour, his mind was still full of his curious dream.  \"Come along, my lad,\" cried Mr Shirley, laying down the Bible, and removing his spectacles from a pair of eyes that usually twinkled with a sort of grave humour, but in which there was now an expression of perplexity; \"set to work and get the edge off your appetite, and then I'll read Moxton's letter.\"  When Mr Shirley had finished breakfast, Ned was about half done, having just commenced his third slice of toast.  So the old gentleman complimented his nephew on the strength of his appetite, put on his spectacles, drew a letter from his pocket, and leaned back in his chair.  \"Now, lad, open your ears and consider what I am about to read.\"  \"Go on, uncle, I'm all attention,\" said Ned, attacking slice number four.  \"This is Moxton's letter.  It runs thus--  \"`Dear Sir,--I beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 5th inst.  I shall be happy to take your nephew on trial, and, if I find him steady, shall enter into an engagement with him, I need not add that unremitting application to business is the only road to distinction in the profession he is desirous of adopting.  Let him call at my office to-morrow between ten and twelve.--Yours very truly, Daniel Moxton.'\"  \"Is that all?\" inquired Ned, drawing his chair towards the fire, into which he gazed contemplatively.  Mr Shirley looked at his nephew over the top of his spectacles, and said--  \"That's all.\"  \"It's very short,\" remarked Ned.  \"But to the point,\" rejoined his uncle.  \"Now, boy, I see that you don't relish the idea, and I must say that I would rather that you became an engineer than a lawyer; but then, lad, situations are difficult to get now-a-days, and, after all, you might do worse than become a lawyer.  To be sure, I have no great love for the cloth, Ned; but the ladder reaches very high.  The foot is crowded with a struggling mass of aspirants, many of whom are of very questionable character, but the top reaches to one of the highest positions in the empire.  You might become the Lord High Chancellor at last, who knows!  But"]]]
