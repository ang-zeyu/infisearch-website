Yet I utter this in thine ear, for I would not that the blades of the valley knew it, lest they might presume upon it, and I should have to prove my ability-- despite my want of love--upon some of their carcasses.\"  \"I wish there were no such thing as war,\" said Hilda with a sigh.  Erling knitted his brows and gazed into the smithy fire as if he were engaged in pondering some knotty point.  \"Well, I'm not sure,\" said he slowly, and descending to a graver tone of address--\"I'm not sure that I can go quite so far as that.  If we had no war at all, perchance our swords might rust, and our skill, for want of practice, might fail us in the hour of need.  Besides, how could men in that case hope to dwell with Odin in Valhalla's bright and merry halls?  But I agree with thee in wishing that we had less of war and more of peace _at home_.\"  \"I fear,\" said Hilda, \"we seem likely to have more of war and less of peace than usual, if rumours be true.  Have you heard that Danish vikings have been seen among the islands?\"  \"Aye, truly, I have heard of them, and it is that which has sent me to the smithy this morning to hasten forward my battle-axe; for I love not too light a weapon.  You see, Hilda, when it has not weight one must sometimes repeat the blow; especially if the mail be strong.  But with a heavy axe and a stout arm there is no need for that.  I had begun this weapon,\" continued the youth, as if he were musing aloud rather than speaking to his companion, \"with intent to try its metal on the head of the King; but I fear me it will be necessary to use it in cracking a viking's headpiece before it cleaves a royal crown.\"  \"The King!\" exclaimed Hilda, with a look of surprise, not unmingled with terror, \"Erling, has ambition led thee to this?\"  \"Not so; but self-preservation urges me to it.\"  The maiden paused a few seconds, ere she replied in a meditative voice--\"The old man who came among us a year ago, and who calls himself Christian, tells me that his god is not a god of war, like Odin; he says that his god permits no war to men, save that of self-defence; but, Erling, would slaying the King be indeed an act of self-preservation?\"  \"Aye, in good sooth would it,\" replied the youth quickly, while a dark frown crossed his brow.  \"How can that be?\" asked the maiden.  \"Hast such small love for gossip, Hilda, that the foul deeds and ambitious projects of Harald Haarfager have not reached thine ear?\"  \"I have heard,\" replied Hilda, \"that he is fond of war, which, truly, is no news, and that he is just now more busy with his bloody game than usual; but what does that matter to thee?\"  \"Matter!\" cried the youth impatiently, as he seized the lump of metal on which he had been at work, and, thrusting it into the smouldering charcoal, commenced to blow the fire energetically, as if to relieve his feelings.  \"Know ye not that the King--this Harald Fairhair--is not satisfied with the goodly domains that of right belong to him, and the kingly rule which he holds, according to law, over all Norway, but that he means to subdue the whole land to himself, and trample on our necks as he has already trampled on our laws?\"  \"I know somewhat of this,\" said Hilda.  \"No one,\" pursued Erling vehemently, and blowing the fire into a fervent heat--\"no one denies to Harald the right to wear the crown of Norway. That was settled at the Ore Thing [see note 1] in Drontheim long ago; but everyone denies his right to interfere with our established laws and privileges.  Has he not, by mere might and force of arms, slain many, and enslaved others, of our best and bravest men?  And now he proposes to reduce the whole land to slavery, or something like it, and all because of the foolish speech of a proud girl, who says she will not wed him until he shall first subdue to himself the whole of Norway, and rule over it as fully and freely as King Eric rules over Sweden, or King Gorm over Denmark.  He has sworn that he will neither clip nor comb his hair, until he has subdued all the land with scatt [taxes] and duties and domains, or die in the attempt.  Trust me! he is like to die in the attempt; and since his Kingship is to be so little occupied with his hair, it would please me well if he would use his time and his shears in clipping the tongue of the wench that set him on so foul an errand.  All this thou knowest, Hilda, as well as I; but thou dost not know that men have been at the stede to-day, who tell us that the King is advancing north, and is victorious everywhere.  Already King Gandalf and Hako are slain; the two sons of King Eystein have also fallen, and many of the upland kings have been burned, with most of their men, in a house at Ringsager.  It is not many days since Harald went up Gudbrandsdal, and north over the Doverfielde, where he ordered all the men to be slain, and everything wide around to be given to the flames.  King Gryting of Orkadal and all his people have sworn fidelity to him, and now--worst news of all--it is said he is coming over to pay us a visit in Horlingdal.  Is not here cause for fighting in self-defence, or rather for country, and laws and freedom, and wives, and children, and--\"  The excited youth stopped abruptly, and, seizing the tongs, whirled the white mass of semi-molten steel upon the anvil, and fell to belabouring it with such goodwill that a bright shower of sparks drove Hilda precipitately out of the workshop.  The wrongs which roused the young Norseman's indignation to such a pitch are matters of history.  The government of the country at that time involved the democratic element very largely.  No act or expedition of any importance could be done or undertaken without the previous deliberation and consent of a \"Thing\", or assembly of landed proprietors.  There were many different Things--such as General Things, District Things, House Things of the King's counsellors, and Herd Things of the Court, etcetera, and to such of these there was a distinct and well-known trumpet call.  There were also four great Things which were legislative, while the small district Things were only administrative.  In addition to which there was the Ore Thing of Drontheim, referred to by Erling.  At these Things the King himself possessed no greater power than any of the bonders.  He was only a \"Thing-man\" at a Thing.  No wonder, then, that the self-governing and warlike Norsemen could not bring themselves tamely to submit to the tyranny of Harald Haarfager, or Fairhair, King of Norway by hereditary right, when he cast aside all the restraints of ancient custom, and, in his effort to obtain more power, commenced those bloody wars with his subjects, which had the effect of causing many of his chief men to expatriate themselves and seek new homes in the islands of the great western sea, and which ultimately resulted in the subjugation (at least during that reign) of all the petty kings of Norway.  These small kings, be it observed, were not at that time exercising any illegal power, or in the occupation of any unwarrantable position, which could be pleaded by King Harald in justification of his violent proceedings against them.  The title of king did not imply independent sovereignty.  They were merely the hereditary lords of the soil, who exercised independent and rightful authority over their own estates and households, and modified authority over their respective districts, subject, however, to the laws of the land--laws which were recognised and perfectly understood by the people and the king, and which were admitted by people and king alike to have more authority than the royal will itself.  By law the small kings were bound to attend the meetings of the Stor Things or Parliaments, at the summons of the sovereign, and to abide by the decisions of those assemblies, where all men met on an equal footing, but where, of course, intellectual power and eloquence led the multitude, for good or for evil, then just as they do now, and will continue to do as long as, and wherever, free discussion shall obtain.  To say that the possession of power, wealth, or influence was frequently abused to the overawing and coercing of those assemblies, is simply to state that they were composed of human beings possessed of fallen natures.  So thoroughly did the Northmen appreciate the importance of having a right to raise their voices and to vote in the national parliaments, and so jealously did they assert and maintain their privileges, that the King himself--before he could, on his accession, assume the crown--was obliged to appear at the \"Thing\", where a freeborn landholder proposed him, and where his title to the crown was investigated and proved in due form.  No war expedition on a large scale could be undertaken until a Thing had been converged, and requisition legally made by the King for a supply of men and arms; and, generally, whenever any act affecting national or even district interests was contemplated, it was necessary to assemble a Thing, and consult with the people before anything could be done.  It may be easily understood, then, with what an outburst of indignation a free and warlike race beheld the violent course pursued by Harald Fairhair, who roamed through the country with fire and sword, trampling on their cherished laws and privileges, subduing the petty kings, and placing them, when submissive, as Jarls, i.e. earls or governors over the districts to collect the scatt or taxes, and manage affairs in his name and for his behoof.  It is no wonder that Erling the Bold gathered his brow into an ominous frown, pressed his lips together, tossed his locks impatiently while he thought on these things and battered the iron mass on his anvil with the amount of energy that he would have expended in belabouring the head of King Harald himself, had opportunity offered.  Erling's wrath cooled, however, almost instantly on his observing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21731"],["title","Fighting the Whales (#1)"],["body"," put on my kettle to boil, for this Word tells me that `the Lord will provide.'  I _expect_ my tea to-night.\"  The sailor's face expressed puzzled astonishment at these words, and he continued to regard my mother with a look of wonder as he drew forth his supplies of food, and laid them on the table.  In a short time we were all enjoying a cup of tea, and talking about the whale-fishery, and the difficulty of my going away while my mother was dependent on me.  At last the sailor rose to leave us.  Taking a five-pound note from his pocket, he laid it on the table and said--  \"Mistress, this is all I have in the world, but I've got neither family nor friends, and I'm bound for the South Seas in six days; so, if you'll take it, you're welcome to it, and if your son Bob can manage to cast loose from you without leaving you to sink, I'll take him aboard the ship that I sail in.  He'll always find me at the Bull and Griffin, in the High Street, or at the end o' the pier.\"  While the sailor was speaking, I observed a figure standing in a dark corner of the room near the door, and, on looking more closely, I found that it was the old gentleman with the nose like his cane-knob.  Seeing that he was observed, he came forward and said--  \"I trust that you will forgive my coming here without invitation; but I happened to overhear part of the conversation between your son and this seaman, and I am willing to help you over your little difficulty, if you will allow me.\"  The old gentleman said this in a very quick, abrupt way, and looked as if he were afraid his offer might be refused.  He was much heated, with climbing our long stair no doubt, and as he stood in the middle of the room, puffing and wiping his bald head with a handkerchief, my mother rose hastily and offered him a chair.  \"You are very kind, sir,\" she said; \"do sit down, sir.  I'm sure I don't know why you should take so much trouble.  But, dear me, you are very warm; will you take a cup of tea to cool you?\"  \"Thank you, thank you.  With much pleasure, unless, indeed, your son objects to a `_stingy old chap_' sitting beside him.\"  I blushed when he repeated my words, and attempted to make some apology; but the old gentleman stopped me by commencing to explain his intentions in short, rapid sentences.  To make a long story short, he offered to look after my mother while I was away, and, to prove his sincerity, laid down five shillings, and said he would call with that sum every week as long as I was absent.  My mother, after some trouble, agreed to let me go, and, before that evening closed, everything was arranged, and the gentleman, leaving his address, went away.  The sailor had been so much filled with surprise at the suddenness of all this, that he could scarcely speak.  Immediately after the departure of the old gentleman, he said, \"Well, good-bye, mistress, good-bye, Bob,\" and throwing on his hat in a careless way, left the room.  \"Stop,\" I shouted after him, when he had got about half-way down stair.  \"Hallo! wot's wrong now?\"  \"Nothing, I only forgot to ask your name.\"  \"Tom Lokins,\" he bellowed, in the hoarse voice of a regular boatswain, \"w'ich wos my father's name before me.\"  So saying, he departed, whistling \"Rule Britannia\" with all his might.  Thus the matter was settled.  Six days afterwards, I rigged myself out in a blue jacket, white ducks, and a straw hat, and went to sea.    CHAPTER TWO.  AT SEA.  My first few days on the ocean were so miserable that I oftentimes repented of having left my native land.  I was, as my new friend Tom Lokins said, as sick as a dog.  But in course of time I grew well, and began to rejoice in the cool fresh breezes and the great rolling billows of the sea.  Many and many a time I used to creep out to the end of the bowsprit, when the weather was calm, and sit with my legs dangling over the deep blue water, and my eyes fixed on the great masses of rolling clouds in the sky, thinking of the new course of life I had just begun.  At such times the thought of my mother was sure to come into my mind, and I thought of her parting words, \"Put your trust in the Lord, Robert, and read His Word.\"  I resolved to try to obey her, but this I found was no easy matter, for the sailors were a rough lot of fellows, who cared little for the Bible.  But, I must say, they were a hearty, good-natured set, and much better, upon the whole, than many a ship's crew that I afterwards sailed with.  We were fortunate in having fair winds this voyage, and soon found ourselves on the other side of the _line_, as we jack-tars call the Equator.  Of course the crew did not forget the old custom of shaving all the men who had never crossed the line before.  Our captain was a jolly old man, and uncommonly fond of \"sky-larking.\"  He gave us leave to do what we liked the day we crossed the line; so, as there were a number of wild spirits among us, we broke through all the ordinary rules, or, rather, we added on new rules to them.  The old hands had kept the matter quiet from us greenhorns, so that, although we knew they were going to do some sort of mischief, we didn't exactly understand what it was to be.  About noon of that day I was called on deck and told that old father Neptune was coming aboard, and we were to be ready to receive him.  A minute after, I saw a tremendous monster come up over the side of the ship and jump on the deck.  He was crowned with sea-weed, and painted in a wonderful fashion; his clothes were dripping wet, as if he had just come from the bottom of the sea.  After him came another monster with a petticoat made of sailcloth, and a tippet of a bit of old tarpaulin. This was Neptune's wife, and these two carried on the most remarkable antics I ever saw.  I laughed heartily, and soon discovered, from the tones of their voices, which of my shipmates Neptune and his wife were. But my mirth was quickly stopped when I was suddenly seized by several men, and my face was covered over with a horrible mixture of tar and grease!  Six of us youngsters were treated in this way; then the lather was scraped off with a piece of old hoop-iron, and, after being thus shaved, buckets of cold water were thrown over us.  At last, after a prosperous voyage, we arrived at our fishing-ground in the South Seas, and a feeling of excitement and expectation began to show itself among the men, insomuch that our very eyes seemed brighter than usual.  One night those of us who had just been relieved from watch on deck, were sitting on the lockers down below telling ghost stories.  It was a dead calm, and one of those intensely dark, hot nights, that cause sailors to feel uneasy, they scarce know why.  I began to feel so uncomfortable at last, listening to the horrible tales which Tom Lokins was relating to the men, that I slipt away from them with the intention of going on deck.  I moved so quietly that no one observed me; besides, every eye was fixed earnestly on Tom, whose deep low voice was the only sound that broke the stillness of all around.  As I was going very cautiously up the ladder leading to the deck, Tom had reached that part of his story where the ghost was just appearing in a dark churchyard, dressed in white, and coming slowly forward, one step at a time, towards the terrified man who saw it.  The men held their breath, and one or two of their faces turned pale as Tom went on with his description, lowering his voice to a hoarse whisper.  Just as I put my head up the hatchway the sheet of one of the sails, which was hanging loose in the still air, passed gently over my head and knocked my hat off.  At any other time I would have thought nothing of this, but Tom's story had thrown me into such an excited and nervous condition that I gave a start, missed my footing, uttered a loud cry, and fell down the ladder right in among the men with a tremendous crash, knocking over two or three oil-cans and a tin bread-basket in my fall, and upsetting the lantern, so that the place was instantly pitch dark.  I never heard such a howl of terror as these men gave vent to when this misfortune befell me.  They rushed upon deck with their hearts in their mouths, tumbling, and peeling the skin off their shins and knuckles in their haste; and it was not until they heard the laughter of the watch on deck that they breathed freely, and, joining in the laugh, called themselves fools for being frightened by a ghost story.  I noticed, however, that, for all their pretended indifference, there was not one man among them--not even Tom Lokins himself--who would go down below to relight the lantern for at least a quarter of an hour afterwards!  Feeling none the worse for my fall, I went forward and leaned over the bow of the ship, where I was much astonished by the appearance of the sea.  It seemed as if the water was on fire.  Every time the ship's bow rose and fell, the little belt of foam made in the water seemed like a belt of blue flame with bright sparkles in it, like stars or diamonds. I had seen this curious appearance before, but never so bright as it was on that night.  \"What is it, Tom?\" said I, as my friend came forward and leaned over the ship's bulwark beside me.  \"It's blue fire, Bob,\" replied Tom, as he smoked his pipe calmly.  \"Come, you know I can't swallow that,\" said I; \"everybody knows that fire, either blue or red, can't burn in the water.\"  \"Maybe not,\" returned Tom; \"but it's blue fire for all that.  Leastwise if it's not, I don't know wot else it is.\"  Tom had often seen this light before, no doubt, but he had never given himself the trouble to find out what it could be.  Fortunately the captain came up just as I put the question, and he enlightened me on the subject.  \"It is caused by small animals,\" said he, leaning over the side.  \"Small animals!\" said I, in astonishment.  \"Ay, many parts of the sea are full of creatures so small and so thin and colourless, that you can hardly see them even in a clear glass tumbler.  Many of them are larger "]]]
