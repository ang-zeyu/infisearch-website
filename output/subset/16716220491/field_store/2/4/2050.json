CHAPTER III.      ... If studious, copie fair what time hath blurred,     Redeem truth from his jawes; if souldier,     Chase brave employments with a naked sword     Throughout the world. Fool not; for all may have,     If they dare try, a glorious life, or grave.         *       *       *       *       *      In brief, acquit thee bravely: play the man. Look not on     pleasures as they come, but go. Defer not the least vertue:     life's poore span Make not an ell, by trifling in thy woe. If     thou do ill, the joy fades, not the pains. If well, the pain     doth fade, the joy remains.  GEORGE HERBERT.   Young Mrs. Johnson, who was a mother of many, hardly knew which to pity more; Miss Jessamine for having her little ways and her antimacassars rumpled by a young Jackanapes; or the boy himself, for being brought up by an old maid.  Oddly enough, she would probably have pitied neither, had Jackanapes been a girl. (One is so apt to think that what works smoothest works to the highest ends, having no patience for the results of friction.) That Father in GOD, who bade the young men to be pure, and the maidens brave, greatly disturbed a member of his congregation, who thought that the great preacher had made a slip of the tongue.  \"That the girls should have purity, and the boys courage, is what you would say, good Father?\"  \"Nature has done that,\" was the reply; \"I meant what I said.\"  In good sooth, a young maid is all the better for learning some robuster virtues than maidenliness and not to move the antimacassars. And the robuster virtues require some fresh air and freedom. As, on the other hand, Jackanapes (who had a boy's full share of the little beast and the young monkey in his natural composition) was none the worse, at his tender years, for learning some maidenliness--so far as maidenliness means decency, pity, unselfishness and pretty behavior.  And it is due to him to say that he was an obedient boy, and a boy whose word could be depended on, long before his grandfather the General came to live at the Green.  He was obedient; that is he did what his great aunt told him. But--oh dear! oh dear!--the pranks he played, which it had never entered into her head to forbid!  It was when he had just been put into skeletons (frocks never suited him) that he became very friendly with Master Tony Johnson, a younger brother of the young gentleman who sat in the puddle on purpose. Tony was not enterprising, and Jackanapes led him by the nose. One summer's evening they were out late, and Miss Jessamine was becoming anxious, when Jackanapes presented himself with a ghastly face all besmirched with tears. He was unusually subdued.  \"I'm afraid,\" he sobbed; \"if you please, I'm very much afraid that Tony Johnson's dying in the churchyard.\"  Miss Jessamine was just beginning to be distracted, when she smelt Jackanapes.  \"You naughty, naughty boys! Do you mean to tell me that you've been smoking?\"  \"Not pipes,\" urged Jackanapes; \"upon my honor, Aunty, not pipes. Only segars like Mr. Johnson's! and only made of brown paper with a very, very little tobacco from the shop inside them.\"  Whereupon, Miss Jessamine sent a servant to the churchyard, who found Tony Johnson lying on a tomb-stone, very sick, and having ceased to entertain any hopes of his own recovery.  If it could be possible that any \"unpleasantness\" could arise between two such amiable neighbors as Miss Jessamine and Mrs. Johnson--and if the still more incredible paradox can be that ladies may differ over a point on which they are agreed--that point was the admitted fact that Tony Johnson was \"delicate,\" and the difference lay chiefly in this: Mrs. Johnson said that Tony was delicate--meaning that he was more finely strung, more sensitive, a properer subject for pampering and petting than Jackanapes, and that, consequently, Jackanapes was to blame for leading Tony into scrapes which resulted in his being chilled, frightened, or (most frequently) sick. But when Miss Jessamine said that Tony Johnson was delicate, she meant that he was more puling, less manly, and less healthily brought up than Jackanapes, who, when they got into mischief together, was certainly not to blame because his friend could not get wet, sit a kicking donkey, ride in the giddy-go-round, bear the noise of a cracker, or smoke brown paper with impunity, as he could.  Not that there was ever the slightest quarrel between the ladies. It never even came near it, except the day after Tony had been so very sick with riding Bucephalus in the giddy-go-round. Mrs. Johnson had explained to Miss Jessamine that the reason Tony was so easily upset, was the unusual sensitiveness (as a doctor had explained it to her) of the nervous centres in her family--\"Fiddlestick!\" So Mrs. Johnson understood Miss Jessamine to say, but it appeared that she only said \"Treaclestick!\" which is quite another thing, and of which Tony was undoubtedly fond.  [Illustration]  It was at the fair that Tony was made ill by riding on Bucephalus. Once a year the Goose Green became the scene of a carnival. First of all, carts and caravans were rumbling up all along, day and night. Jackanapes could hear them as he lay in bed, and could hardly sleep for speculating what booths and whirligigs he should find fairly established, when he and his dog Spitfire went out after breakfast. As a matter of fact, he seldom had to wait long for news of the Fair. The Postman knew the window out of which Jackanapes' yellow head would come, and was ready with his report.  \"Royal Theayter, Master Jackanapes, in the old place, but be careful o' them seats, sir; they're rickettier than ever. Two sweets and a ginger-beer under the oak tree, and the Flying Boats is just a-coming along the road.\"  No doubt it was partly because he had already suffered severely in the Flying Boats, that Tony collapsed so quickly in the giddy-go-round. He only mounted Bucephalus (who was spotted, and had no tail) because Jackanapes urged him, and held out the ingenious hope that the round-and-round feeling would very likely cure the up-and-down sensation. It did not, however, and Tony tumbled off during the first revolution.  Jackanapes was not absolutely free from qualms, but having once mounted the Black Prince he stuck to him as a horseman should. During the first round he waved his hat, and observed with some concern that the Black Prince had lost an ear since last Fair; at the second, he looked a little pale but sat upright, though somewhat unnecessarily rigid; at the third round he shut his eyes. During the fourth his hat fell off, and he clasped his horse's neck. By the fifth he had laid his yellow head against the Black Prince's mane, and so clung anyhow till the hobby-horses stopped, when the proprietor assisted him to alight, and he sat down rather suddenly and said he had enjoyed it very much.  The Grey Goose always ran away at the first approach of the caravans, and never came back to the Green till there was nothing left of the Fair but footmarks and oyster-shells. Running away was her pet principle; the only system, she maintained, by which you can live long and easily, and lose nothing. If you run away when you see danger, you can come back when all is safe. Run quickly, return slowly, hold your head high, and gabble as loud as you can, and you'll preserve the respect of the Goose Green to a peaceful old age. Why should you struggle and get hurt, if you can lower your head and swerve, and not lose a feather? Why in the world should any one spoil the pleasure of life, or risk his skin, if he can help it?      \"'What's the use'     Said the Goose.\"  Before answering which one might have to consider what world--which life--whether his skin were a goose-skin; but the Grey Goose's head would never have held all that.  Grass soon grows over footprints, and the village children took the oyster-shells to trim their gardens with; but the year after Tony rode Bucephalus there lingered another relic of Fairtime, in which Jackanapes was deeply interested. \"The Green\" proper was originally only part of a straggling common, which in its turn merged into some wilder waste land where gipsies sometimes squatted if the authorities would allow them, especially after the annual Fair. And it was after the Fair that Jackanapes, out rambling by himself, was knocked over by the Gipsy's son riding the Gipsy's red-haired pony at break-neck pace across the common.  Jackanapes got up and shook himself, none the worse, except for being heels over head in love with the red-haired pony. What a rate he went at! How he spurned the ground with his nimble feet! How his red coat shone in the sunshine! And what bright eyes peeped out of his dark forelock as it was blown by the wind!  The Gipsy boy had had a fright, and he was willing enough to reward Jackanapes for not having been hurt, by consenting to let him have a ride.  \"Do you mean to kill the little fine gentleman, and swing us all on the gibbet, you rascal?\" screamed the Gipsy-mother, who came up just as Jackanapes and the pony set off.  \"He would get on,\" replied her son. \"It'll not kill him. He'll fall on his yellow head, and it's as tough as a cocoanut.\"  But Jackanapes did not fall. He stuck to the red-haired pony as he had stuck to the hobbyhorse; but oh, how different the delight of this wild gallop with flesh and blood! Just as his legs were beginning to feel as if he did not feel them, the Gipsy boy cried \"Lollo!\" Round went the pony so unceremoniously, that, with as little ceremony, Jackanapes clung to his neck, and he did not properly recover himself before Lollo stopped with a jerk at the place where they had started.  \"Is his name Lollo?\" asked Jackanapes, his hand lingering in the wiry mane.  \"Yes.\"  \"What does"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20352"],["title","The Jest Book (#1)"],["body","him?\"--\"Nonsense,\" replied his companion; \"introduce him as a _Liveryman_ of the _city of London_. _What_ is more honorable?\"           X.--GOOD ADVICE.  LADY ---- spoke to the butler to be saving of an excellent cask of small beer, and asked him how it might be best preserved. \"I know no method so effectual, my lady,\" replied the butler, \"as placing a barrel of _good_ ale by it.\"           XI.--NEW RELATIONSHIP.  A STRANGER to law courts hearing a judge call a sergeant \"brother,\" expressed his surprise. \"Oh,\" said one present, \"they are brothers--_brothers-in-law_.\"           XII.--A SMALL INHERITANCE.  IT was the habit of Lord Eldon, when Attorney-General, to close his speeches with some remarks justifying his own character. At the trial of Horne Tooke, speaking of his own reputation, he said: \"It is the little inheritance I have to leave my children, and, by God's help, I will leave it unimpaired.\" Here he shed tears; and, to the astonishment of those present, Mitford, the Solicitor-General, began to weep. \"Just look at Mitford,\" said a by-stander to Horne Tooke; \"what on earth is he crying for?\" Tooke replied, \"He is crying to think what a _small_ inheritance Eldon's children are likely to get.\"           XIII.--A DIFFERENCE.  JERROLD one day met a Scotch gentleman, whose name was Leitch, and who explained that he was not the popular caricaturist, John Leech. \"I'm aware of that; you're the Scotchman with the _i-t-c-h_ in your name,\" said Jerrold.           XIV.--THE LIGHT SUBJECT.  THE government, having threatened to proceed rigorously against those who refused to pay the assessed taxes, offered to them a remission of _one fourth_. \"This at least,\" said a sufferer, \"may be called, giving them some _quarter_.\"           XV.--COMPLIMENTARY.  LORD NORTH, who was very corpulent before a severe sickness, said to his physician after it, \"Sir, I am obliged to you for introducing me to some old acquaintances.\"--\"Who are they, my lord?\"--\"_My ribs_,\" replied his lordship, \"which I have not felt for many years until now.\"           XVI.--A FAIR SUBSTITUTE.  WHEN Lord Sandwich was to present Admiral Campbell, he told him, that probably the king would knight him. The admiral did not much relish the honor. \"Well, but,\" said Lord S., \"perhaps Mrs. Campbell will like it.\"--\"Then let the king _knight her_,\" answered the rough seaman.           XVII.--A CONSTITUTIONAL PUN.  DANIEL PURCELL, the famous punster, was desired to make a pun extempore. \"Upon what subject?\" said Daniel. \"The king,\" answered the other. \"O, sir,\" said he, \"the _king_ is no _subject_.\"           XVIII.--A CONVERT.  A NOTORIOUS miser having heard a very eloquent charity sermon, exclaimed, \"This sermon strongly proves the necessity of alms. I have almost a mind to turn _beggar_.\"           XIX.--INCREDIBLE.  SHERIDAN made his appearance one day in a pair of new boots; these attracting the notice of some of his friends, \"Now guess,\" said he, \"how I came by these boots?\" Many _probable_ guesses then took place. \"No!\" said Sheridan, \"no, you've not hit it, nor ever will,--I bought them, and paid for them!\"           XX.--ALL THE DIFFERENCE.  IN a large party, one evening, the conversation turned upon young men's allowance at college. Tom Sheridan lamented the ill-judging parsimony of many parents in that respect. \"I am sure, Tom,\" said his father, \"you need not complain; I always allowed you eight hundred a year.\"--\"Yes, father, I must confess you _allowed_ it; but then it was never paid.\"           XXI.--SPIRITUAL AND SPIRITUOUS.  DR. PITCAIRN had one Sunday stumbled into a Presbyterian church, probably to beguile a few idle moments (for few will accuse that gentleman of having been a warm admirer of _Calvinism_), and seeing the parson apparently overwhelmed by the importance of his subject: \"What makes the man _greet_?\" said Pitcairn to a fellow that stood near him. \"By my faith, sir,\" answered the other, \"you would perhaps greet, too, if you were in his place, _and had as little to say_.\"--\"Come along with me, friend, and let's have a glass together; you are too good a fellow to be here,\" said Pitcairn, delighted with the man's repartee.           XXII.--A WONDERFUL WOMAN.  WHEN a late Duchess of Bedford was last at Buxton, and then in her eighty-fifth year, it was the medical farce of the day for the faculty to resolve every complaint of whim and caprice into \"a shock of the nervous system.\" Her grace, after inquiring of many of her friends in the rooms what brought them there, and being generally answered for a nervous complaint, was asked in her turn, \"What brought her to Buxton?\"--\"I came only for pleasure,\" answered the healthy duchess; \"for, thank God, I was born before _nerves came into fashion_.\"           XXIII.--A WISE SON WHO KNEW HIS OWN FATHER.  SHERIDAN was very desirous that his son Tom should marry a young woman of large fortune, but knew that Miss Callander had won his son's heart. Sheridan, expatiating on the folly of his son, at length exclaimed, \"Tom, if you marry Caroline Callander, I'll cut you off with a shilling!\" Tom could not resist the opportunity of replying, and looking archly at his father said, \"Then, sir, you must _borrow_ it.\" Sheridan was tickled at the wit, and dropped the subject.           XXIV.--A WRITTEN CHARACTER.  GEORGE III. having purchased a horse, the dealer put into his hands a large sheet of paper, completely written over. \"What's this?\" said his majesty. \"The pedigree of the horse, sire, which you have just bought,\" was the answer. \"Take it back, take it back,\" said the king, laughing; \"it will do very well for the _next horse you sell_.\"           XXV.--WELL MATCHED.  DR. BUSBY, whose figure was beneath the common size, was one day accosted in a public coffee-room by an Irish baronet of colossal stature, with, \"May I pass to my seat, O Giant?\" When the doctor, politely making way, replied, \"Pass, O Pigmy!\"--\"O, sir,\" said the baronet, \"my expression alluded to the _size of your intellect_.\"--\"And my expression, sir,\" said the doctor, \"to the _size of yours_.\"           XXVI.--A PARDONABLE MISTAKE.  A BUTCHER of some eminence was lately in company with several ladies at a game of whist, where, having lost two or three rubbers, one of the ladies addressing him, asked, \"Pray, sir, what are the stakes now?\" To which, ever mindful of his occupation, he immediately replied, \"Madam, the best rump I cannot _sell_ lower than tenpence halfpenny _a pound_.\"           XXVII.--THREE CAUSES.  THREE gentlemen being in a coffee-house, one called for a dram, _because he was hot_. \"Bring me another,\" says his companion, \"_because I am cold_.\" The third, who sat by and heard them, very quietly called out, \"Here, boy, bring me a glass, _because I like it_.\"           XXVIII.--THE CONNOISSEUR.  A PERSON to whom the curiosities, buildings, &c., in Oxford were shown one very hot day, was asked by his companion if he would see the remainder of the University. \"My dear sir,\" replied the connoisseur, \"I am _stone blind_ already.\"           XXIX.--A SYMBOL.  A SATIRIC poet underwent a severe drubbing, and was observed to walk ever afterwards with a stick. \"Mr. P. reminds me,\" says a wag, \"of some of the saints, who are always painted with _the symbols_ of their martyrdom.\"           XXX.--THE ONE THING WANTING.  IN a small party, the subject turning on matrimony, a lady said to her sister, \"I wonder, my dear, you have never made a _match_; I think you want the _brimstone_\";--she replied, \"No, not the _brimstone_, only the _spark_.\"           XXXI.--A HORSE LAUGH.  A COACHMAN, extolling the sagacity of one of his horses, observed, that \"if anybody was to go for to use him ill, he would _bear malice_ like a _Christian_.\"           XXXII.--ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER.  DR. A., physician at Newcastle, being summoned to a vestry, in order to reprimand the sexton for drunkenness, he dwelt so long on the sexton's misconduct, as to draw from him this expression: \"Sir, I thought you would have been the last man alive to appear against me, as _I have covered so many blunders of yours_!\"           XXXIII.--A NOVEL COMPLAINT.  A RICH man sent to call a physician for a slight disorder. The physician felt his pulse, and said, \"Do you eat well?\"--\"Yes,\" said the patient. \"Do you sleep well?\"--\"I do.\"--\"Then,\" said the physician, \"I shall give you something to take away _all that_!\"           XXXIV.--A CONJUGAL CAUTION.  SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE, having run up a score at Lockit's, absented himself from the ordinary. In consequence of this, Mrs. Lockit was sent to dun him and threaten him with an action. He told the messenger that he would certainly kiss her if she stirred a step in it! On this, the message being brought, she called for her hood and scarf, and told her husband, who interposed, \"that she should see if there was any fellow alive that had the impudence!\"--\"Pr'ythee, my dear, don't be so rash,\" replied the good man; \"you don't know what a man may do _in a passion_.\"           XXXV.--A PORTRAIT CAPITALLY EXECUTED.  IN a bookseller's catalogue lately appeared the following article: \"Memoirs of Charles the First,--with, a _head capitally executed_.\"           XXXVI.--MATTER IN HIS MADNESS.  A LUNATIC in Bedlam was asked how he came there? He answered, \"By a dispute.\"--\"What dispute?\" The bedlamite replied, \"The world said I was _mad_; I said the world was _mad_, and they _outwitted me_.\"           XXXVII.--PLEASANT INVITATION.  SOME years ago, says Richardson, in his anecdotes of painting, a gentleman came to me to invite me to his house. \"I have,\" says he, \"a picture of Rubens, and it is a rare good one. Little H. the other day came to see it, and says it is _a copy_. If any one says so again, I'll _break his head_. Pray, Mr. Richardson, will you do me the favor to come, and give me _your real opinion of it_?\"           XXXVIII.--WELL-BRED HORSE.  \"HOW does your new-purchased horse _answer_?\" said the late Duke of Cumberland to"]]]
