He was breathless, hatless, moist, and frantic.  \"My child! my darling! my dear Di!\" he gasped.  \"Papa!\" responded Diana, with a little scream, and, leaping into his arms, grasped him in a genuine hug.  \"Oh!  I say,\" whispered the small butcher, \"it's a melly-drammy--all for nuffin!\"  \"My!\" responded the small baker, with a solemn look, \"won't the Lord left-tenant be down on 'em for play-actin' without a licence, just!\"  \"Is the pony killed?\" inquired Sir Richard, recovering himself.  \"Not in the least, sir.  'Ere 'e is, sir; all alive an' kickin',\" answered the small butcher, delighted to have the chance of making himself offensively useful, \"but the hinsurance offices wouldn't 'ave the clo'se-baskit at no price.  Shall I order up the remains of your carriage, sir?\"  \"Oh!  I'm so glad he's not dead,\" said Diana, looking hastily up, \"but this policeman was nearly killed, and _I_ did it!  He saved my life, papa.\"  A chorus of voices here explained to Sir Richard how Number 666 had come up in the nick of time to receive the flying child upon his bosom.  \"I am deeply grateful to you,\" said the knight, turning to the constable, and extending his hand, which the latter shook modestly while disclaiming any merit for having merely performed his duty--he might say, involuntarily.  \"Will you come to my house?\" said Sir Richard.  \"Here is my card.  I should like to see you again, and pray, see that some one looks after my pony and--\"  \"And the remains,\" suggested the small butcher, seeing that Sir Richard hesitated.  \"Be so good as to call a cab,\" said Sir Richard in a general way to any one who chose to obey.  \"Here you are, sir!\" cried a peculiarly sharp cabby, who, correctly judging from the state of affairs that his services would be required, had drawn near to bide his time.  Sir Richard and his little daughter got in and were driven home, leaving Number 666 to look after the pony and the remains.  Thus curiously were introduced to each other some of the characters in our tale.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE IRRESISTIBLE POWER OF LOVE.  Need we remark that there was a great deal of embracing on the part of Di and her nurse when the former returned home?  The child was an affectionate creature as well as passionate.  The nurse, Mrs Screwbury, was also affectionate without being passionate.  Poor Diana had never known a mother's love or care; but good, steady, stout Mrs Screwbury did what in her lay to fill the place of mother.  Sir Richard filled the place of father pretty much as a lamp-post might have done had it owned a child.  He illuminated her to some extent-- explained things in general, stiffly, and shed a feeble ray around himself; but his light did not extend far.  He was proud of her, however, and very fond of her--when good.  When not good, he was--or rather had been--in the habit of dismissing her to the nursery.  Nevertheless, the child exercised very considerable and ever-increasing influence over her father; for, although stiff, the knight was by no means destitute of natural affection, and sometimes observed, with moist eyes, strong traces of resemblance to his lost wife in the beautiful child.  Indeed, as years advanced, he became a more and more obedient father, and was obviously on the high road to abject slavery.  \"Papa,\" said Di, while they were at luncheon that day, not long after the accident, \"I _am_ so sorry for that poor policeman.  It seems such a dreadful thing to have actually jumped upon him! and oh! you should have heard his poor head hit the pavement, and seen his pretty helmet go spinning along like a boy's top, ever so far.  I wonder it didn't kill him.  I'm _so_ sorry.\"  Di emphasised her sorrow by laughing, for she had a keen sense of the ludicrous, and the memory of the spinning helmet was strong upon her just then.  \"It must indeed have been an unpleasant blow,\" replied Sir Richard, gravely, \"but then, dear, you couldn't help it, you know--and I dare say he is none the worse for it now.  Men like him are not easily injured. I fear we cannot say as much for the boy who was holding the pony.\"  \"Oh!  I quite forgot about him,\" exclaimed Di; \"the naughty boy! he wouldn't let go the pony's reins when I bid him, but I saw he tumbled down when we set off.\"  \"Yes, he has been somewhat severely punished, I fear, for his disobedience.  His leg had been broken.  Is it not so, Balls?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied the butler, \"'e 'as 'ad 'is--\"  Balls got no farther, for Diana, who had been struck dumb for the moment by the news, recovered herself.  \"His leg broken!\" she exclaimed with a look of consternation; \"Oh! the poor, poor boy!--the dear boy! and it was me did that too, as well as knocking down the poor policeman!\"  There is no saying to what lengths the remorseful child would have gone in the way of self-condemnation if her father had not turned her thoughts from herself by asking what had been done for the boy.  \"We sent 'im 'ome, sir, in a cab.\"  \"I'm afraid that was a little too prompt,\" returned the knight thoughtfully.  \"A broken leg requires careful treatment, I suppose.  You should have had him into the house, and sent for a doctor.\"  Balls coughed.  He was slightly chagrined to find that the violation of his own humane feelings had been needless, and that his attempt to do as he thought his master would have wished was in vain.  \"I thought, Sir Richard, that you didn't like the lower orders to go about the 'ouse more--\"  Again little Di interrupted the butler by asking excitedly where the boy's home was.  \"In the neighbour'ood of W'itechapel, Miss Di.\"  \"Then, papa, we will go straight off to see him,\" said the child, in the tone of one whose mind is fully made up.  \"You and I shall go together-- won't we? good papa!\"  \"That will do, Balls, you may go.  No, my dear Di, I think we had better not.  I will write to one of the city missionaries whom I know, and ask him to--\"  \"No, but, papa--dear papa, we _must_ go.  The city missionary could never say how very, _very_ sorry I am that he should have broken his leg while helping me.  And then I should _so_ like to sit by him and tell him stories, and give him his soup and gruel, and read to him.  Poor, _poor_ boy, we _must_ go, papa, won't you?\"  \"Not to-day, dear.  It is impossible to go to-day.  There, now, don't begin to cry.  Perhaps--perhaps to-morrow--but think, my love; you have no idea how dirty--how _very_ nasty--the places are in which our lower orders live.\"  \"Oh! yes I have,\" said Di eagerly.  \"Haven't I seen our nursery on cleaning days?\"  A faint flicker of a smile passed over the knight's countenance.  \"True, darling, but the places are far, far dirtier than that.  Then the smells.  Oh! they are very dreadful--\"  \"What--worse than _we_ have when there's cabbage for dinner?\"  \"Yes, much worse than that.\"  \"I don't care, papa.  We _must_ go to see the boy--the poor, _poor_ boy, in spite of dirt and smells.  And then, you know--let me up on your knee and I'll tell you all about it.  There!  Well, then, you know, I'd tidy the room up, and even wash it a little.  Oh, you can't think how nicely I washed up my doll's room--her corner, you know,--that day when I spilt all her soup in trying to feed her, and then, while trying to wipe it up, I accidentally burst her, and all her inside came out--the sawdust, I mean.  It was the worst mess I ever made, but I cleaned it up as well as Jessie herself could have done--so nurse said.\"  \"But the messes down in Whitechapel are much worse than you have described, dear,\" expostulated the parent, who felt that his powers of resistance were going.  \"So much the better, papa,\" replied Di, kissing her sire's lethargic visage.  \"I should like _so_ much to try if I could clean up something worse than my doll's room.  And you've promised, you know.\"  \"No--only said `perhaps,'\" returned Sir Richard quickly.  \"Well, that's the same thing; and now that it's all nicely settled, I'll go and see nurse.  Good-bye, papa.\"  \"Good-bye, dear,\" returned the knight, resigning himself to his fate and the newspaper.    CHAPTER THREE.  POVERTY MANAGES TO BOARD OUT HER INFANT FOR NOTHING.  On the night of the day about which we have been writing, a woman, dressed in \"unwomanly rags\" crept out of the shadow of the houses near London Bridge.  She was a thin, middle-aged woman, with a countenance from which sorrow, suffering, and sin had not been able to obliterate entirely the traces of beauty.  She carried a bundle in her arms which was easily recognisable as a baby, from the careful and affectionate manner in which the woman's thin, out-spread fingers grasped it.  Hurrying on to the bridge till she reached the middle of one of the arches, she paused and looked over.  The Thames was black and gurgling, for it was intensely dark, and the tide half ebb at the time.  The turbid waters chafed noisily on the stone piers as if the sins and sorrows of the great city had been somehow communicated to them.  But the distance from the parapet to the surface of the stream was great.  It seemed awful in the woman's eyes.  She shuddered and drew back.  \"Oh! for courage--only for one minute!\" she murmured, clasping the bundle closer to her breast.  The action drew off a corner of the scanty rag which she called a shawl, and revealed a small and round, yet exceedingly thin face, the black eyes of which seemed to gaze in solemn wonder at the scene of darkness visible which was revealed.  The woman stood between two lamps in the darkest place she could find, but enough of light reached her to glitter in the baby's solemn eyes as they met her gaze, and it made a pitiful attempt to smile as it recognised its mother.  \"God help me!  I can't,\" muttered the woman with a shiver, as if an ice-block had touched her heart.  She drew the rag hastily over the baby's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21730"],["title","Erling the Bold (#1)"],["body","be misled by the termination of the latter word, which has no reference whatever to the royal title king.  A viking was merely a piratical rover on the sea, the sea-warrior of the period, but a Sea-king was a leader and commander of vikings. Every Sea-king was a viking, but every viking was not a Sea-king; just as every Admiral is a sailor, but every sailor is not an Admiral.  When it is said that Erling was a Sea-king, it is much as if we had said he was an admiral in a small way.    CHAPTER TWO.  INTRODUCES, AMONG OTHERS, THE HERO AND HEROINE, AND OPENS UP A VIEW OF NORSE LIFE IN THE OLDEN TIME.  Ulf of Romsdal had a daughter named Hilda.  She was fair, and extremely pretty.  The young men said that her brow was the habitation of the lily, her eye the mirror of the heavens, her cheek the dwelling-place of the rose. True, in the ardour of their feelings and strength of their imaginations they used strong language; nevertheless it was impossible to overpraise the Norse maiden.  Her nut-brown hair fell in luxuriant masses over her shapely shoulders, reaching far below the waist; her skin was fair, and her manners engaging.  Hilda was undoubtedly blue-eyed and beautiful. She was just seventeen at this time.  Those who loved her (and there were few who did not) styled her the sunbeam.  Erling and Hilda had dwelt near each other from infancy.  They had been playmates, and for many years were as brother and sister to each other. Erling's affection had gradually grown into a stronger passion, but he never mentioned the fact to anyone, being exceedingly shamefaced and shy in regard to love.  He would have given his ears to have known that his love was returned, but he dared not to ask.  He was very stupid on this point.  In regard to other things he was sharp-witted above his fellows. None knew better than he how to guide the \"warship\" through the intricate mazes of the island-studded coast of Norway; none equalled him in deeds of arms; no one excelled him in speed of foot, in scaling the fells, or in tracking the wolf and bear to their dens; but all beat him in love-making!  He was wondrously slow and obtuse at that, and could by no means discover whether or not Hilda regarded him as a lover or a brother.  As uncertainty on this point continued, Erling became jealous of all the young men who approached her, and in proportion as this feeling increased his natural disposition changed, and his chafing spirit struggled fiercely within him.  But his native good sense and modesty enabled him pretty well to conceal his feelings.  As for Hilda, no one knew the state of her mind.  It is probable that at this time she herself had not a very distinct idea on the point.  Hilda had a foster-sister named Ada, who was also very beautiful.  She was unusually dark for a Norse maiden.  Her akin indeed was fair, but her hair and eyes were black like the raven's wing.  Her father was King Hakon of Drontheim.  It was the custom in those warlike days for parents to send out some of their children to be fostered by others--in order, no doubt, to render next to impossible the total extirpation of their families at a time when sudden descents upon households were common.  By thus scattering their children the chances of family annihilation were lessened, and the probability that some members might be left alive to take revenge was greatly increased.  Hilda and Ada were warmly attached.  Having been brought up together, they loved each other as sisters--all the more, perhaps, that in character they were somewhat opposed.  Hilda was grave, thoughtful, almost pensive.  Ada was full of vivacity and mirth, fond of fun, and by no means averse to a little of what she styled harmless mischief.  Now there was a man in Horlingdal called Glumm, surnamed the Gruff, who loved Ada fervently.  He was a stout, handsome man, of ruddy complexion, and second only to Erling in personal strength and prowess.  But by nature he was morose and gloomy.  Nothing worse, however, could be said of him.  In other respects he was esteemed a brave, excellent man. Glumm was too proud to show his love to Ada very plainly; but she had wit enough to discover it, though no one else did, and she resolved to punish him for his pride by keeping him in suspense.  Horlingdal, where Ulf and Haldor and their families dwelt was, like nearly all the vales on the west of Norway, hemmed in by steep mountains of great height, which were covered with dark pines and birch trees.  To the level pastures high up on mountain tops the inhabitants were wont to send their cattle to feed in summer--the small crops of hay in the valleys being carefully gathered and housed for winter use.  Every morning, before the birds began to twitter, Hilda set out, with her pail and her wooden box, to climb the mountain to the upland dairy or \"saeter\", and fetch the milk and butter required by the family during the day.  Although the maid was of noble birth--Ulf claiming descent from one of those who are said to have come over with Odin and his twelve godars or priests from Asia--this was not deemed an inappropriate occupation.  Among the Norsemen labour was the lot of high and low.  He was esteemed the best man who could fight most valiantly in battle and labour most actively in the field or with the tools of the smith and carpenter.  Ulf of Romsdal, although styled king in virtue of his descent, was not too proud, in the busy summertime, to throw off his coat and toss the hay in his own fields in the midst of his thralls [slaves taken in war] and house-carles.  Neither he, nor Haldor, nor any of the small kings, although they were the chief men of the districts in which they resided, thought it beneath their dignity to forge their own spearheads and anchors, or to mend their own doors.  As it was with the men, so was it with the women.  Hilda the Sunbeam was not despised because she climbed the mountainside to fetch milk and butter for the family.  One morning, in returning from the fell, Hilda heard the loud clatter of the anvil at Haldorstede.  Having learned that morning that Danish vikings had been seen prowling among the islands near the fiord, she turned aside to enquire the news.  Haldorstede lay about a mile up the valley, and Hilda passed it every morning on her way to and from the saeter.  Ulfstede lay near the shore of the fiord.  Turning into the smithy, she found Erling busily engaged in hammering a huge mass of stubborn red-hot metal.  So intent was the young man on his occupation that he failed to observe the entrance of his fair visitor, who set down her milk pail, and stood for a few minutes with her hands folded and her eyes fixed demurely on her lover.  Erling had thrown off his jerkin and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt of coarse homespun fabric, in order to give his thick muscular arms unimpeded play in wielding the hammer and turning the mass of glowing metal on the anvil.  He wore woollen breeches and hose, both of which had been fashioned by the fingers of his buxom mother, Herfrida.  A pair of neatly formed shoes of untanned hide--his own workmanship--protected his feet, and his waist was encircled by a broad leathern girdle, from one side of which depended a short hunting-knife, and from the other a flap, with a slit in it, to support his sword.  The latter weapon--a heavy double-edged blade--stood leaning against the forge chimney, along with a huge battle-axe, within reach of his hand.  The collar of his shirt was thrown well back, exposing to view a neck and chest whose muscles denoted extraordinary power, and the whiteness of which contrasted strikingly with the ruddy hue of his deeply bronzed countenance.  The young giant appeared to take pleasure in the exercise of his superabundant strength, for, instead of using the ordinary single-hand hammer with which other men were wont to bend the glowing metal to their will, he wielded the great forehammer, and did it as easily, too, with his right arm as if it had been but a wooden mallet.  The mass of metal at which he wrought was thick and unyielding, but under his heavy blows it began to assume the form of an axe--a fact which Hilda noticed with a somewhat saddened brow.  Erling's long hair, rolling as it did down his shoulders, frequently straggled over his face and interfered slightly with his vision, whereupon he shook it back with an impatient toss, as a lion might shake his mane, while he toiled with violent energy at his work.  To look at him, one might suppose that Vulcan himself had condescended to visit the abodes of men, and work in a terrestrial smithy!  During one of the tosses with which he threw back his hair, Erling chanced to raise his eyes, which instantly fell upon Hilda.  A glad smile beamed on his flushed face, and he let the hammer fall with a ringing clatter on the anvil, exclaiming:  \"Ha! good morrow to thee, Hilda!  Thou comest with stealthy tread, like the midnight marauder.  What news?  Does all go well at Ulfstede?  But why so sad, Hilda?  Thy countenance is not wont to quarrel with the mountain air.\"  \"Truly, no!\" replied the girl, smiling, \"mountain air likes me well.  If my looks are sadder than usual, it is because of the form of the weapon thou art fashioning.\"  \"The weapon!\" exclaimed Erling, as he raised the handle of the hammer, and, resting his arms on it, gazed at his visitor in some surprise.  \"It is but an axe--a simple axe, perchance a trifle heavier than other axes because it suits my arm better, and I have a weakness that way.  What ails thee at a battle-axe, Hilda?\"  \"I quarrel not with the axe, Erling, but it reminds me of thy love of fighting, and I grieve for that.  Why art thou so fond of war?\"  \"Fond of war!\" echoed the youth.  \"Now, out upon thee, Hilda! what were a man fit for if he could not fight?\"  \"Nay, I question not thine ability to fight, but I grieve to see thy love for fighting.\"  \"Truly there seems to me a close relationship between the love of war and the ability to "]]]
