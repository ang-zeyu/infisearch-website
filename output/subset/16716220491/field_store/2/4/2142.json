Mrs. Brent set him down as a good deal of a Miss Nancy. But the ladies had a delightful time going over family histories and getting relationships disentangled.  When the eventful day of parting came it brought a very real sorrow. They made promises that they would renew their meetings and keep each other in mind.  It was Saturday evening when the Leverett household sat around the cheerful fire in the cozy room where the small family gathered on this evening of the week with their work all done, after the fashion of the past, still strictly observed by many of the older Puritan families. The industrious ladies sat with folded hands. Sometimes Chilian read aloud from a volume of the divines who had finished their good fight.  This night he was gazing idly in the fire, the lines in his face deepening now and then.  \"I suppose he _is_ tired with all the talk, and rambles, and confusion of the week,\" Elizabeth thought, stealing furtive glances at him.  He straightened himself presently and made a pretence of clearing his throat, as an embarrassed person often does.  \"I have something to tell you,\" he began. \"I thought I would not disturb you while our relatives were here. We found enough to talk about;\" with a short half-laugh.  \"And it tired you out, I know. We live so quietly that such an event quite upsets us,\" Eunice said in a gentle, deprecating tone.  \"It was very pleasant,\" he added. \"I was a good deal interested in Anthony Drayton. But this is something quite different. Can you recall that I had a letter from the East Indies the morning the word came from Cousin Giles?\"  \"Why, yes!\" Elizabeth started in surprise. \"I had really forgotten about it. Business, I suppose, with Anthony Leverett. Why, I think it is high time he came home.\"  Chilian sighed. \"I am afraid--though I cannot see why we should fear so much to enter the other portal, since it is the destiny of all, and we believe in a better world. He was hopelessly ill when he wrote and was winding up some business matters. He is a brave man to meet death so composedly. The only pang is parting from his child.\"  \"Oh, his little girl! Let me see--she must be eight or nine years old. What will become of her?\"  \"He makes me executor and guardian of the child. She was to start three weeks after his letter with Captain Corwin in the _Flying Star_. That will be due, if it meets with no mishap, from the middle to the last of April.\"  \"But she doesn't come alone!\" ejaculated Elizabeth in surprise.  \"Yes. He wishes to be buried there beside his wife. And he does not want her to have the remembrance of his death. So he sends her with the woman who has been her nurse and maid the last three years, an Englishwoman.\"  \"Of all things! I wonder what will come next! We seem in the line of surprises. And it's queer they should happen together. A little girl! Chilian, do _you_ like it? Why, it will fairly turn the house upside down!\"  There was an accent of protest in Elizabeth's tone, showing plainly her unwillingness to accept the situation.  \"One little girl can't move much furniture about;\" with a sound of humor in his voice.  \"Oh, you know what I mean--not actually dragging sofas and tables about, but she will chairs, as you'll see. And lots of other things. Look at the Rendall children. The house always looks as if it had been stirred up with the pudding-stick, and Sally Rendall spends good half her time looking for things they have carted off. Tom and Anstice were digging up the path the day we called, and what do you suppose they had! The tablespoons. And I'll venture to say they were left out of doors.\"  \"There are so many of them,\" Chilian said, as if in apology.  \"And I don't see how we can keep this child away from them. It isn't as if they were low-down people. Sally's father having been a major in the war, and the Rendalls are good stock. Let me see--what's her name? Her mother was called Letty.\"  \"Cynthia. She was named for my mother.\" Chilian's voice had a reverent softness in it.  \"I always thought it a pretty name,\" said Eunice.  \"And I've heard people call it 'Cyn.' I do abominate nicknames.\"  Elizabeth uttered this with a good deal of vigor. Then she remembered she quite liked Bessy.  No one spoke for some moments. Chilian thought of the sister, whose brief married life had ended in her pretty home at Providence, and how she looked in her coffin with her baby sheltered by one arm. The picture came before him vividly.  Elizabeth liked cleanliness and order. It was natural after a long practice in it. Chilian's particular ways suited her. Year after year had settled them--perhaps she had settled him more definitely, as he liked the way. Eunice was thinking of the little girl who had neither father or mother. She had some unfulfilled dreams. In her youth there had been a lover, and a wedding planned when he came home from his voyage. She had begun to \"lay by\" for housekeeping. And there were some pretty garments in the trunk upstairs, packed away with other articles. The lover was lost at sea, as befell many another New England coast woman.  She had hoped against hope for several years--men were sometimes restored as by a miracle--but he never came. So she sometimes dreamed of what might have been, of home and children, and it kept her heart tender. Anthony's little girl would make a sight of trouble, she could see that, but a little girl about would be a great pleasure--to her at least. She glanced furtively at Elizabeth, then at Chilian. She could not comfort either of them with this sudden glow and warmth that thrilled through her veins.  \"Well, we will be through with house-cleaning before she comes,\" said the practical and particular housewife. Chilian simply sighed. It was the usual spring ordeal, and did end. But who could predict the ending of the other?     CHAPTER II  THE LITTLE GIRL   Down at the wharf there was much bustle and stir. Vessels were lading for various home ports, fishing craft were going out on their ventures, even a whaler had just fitted up for a long cruise, and the young as well as middle-aged sailors were shouting out farewells. White and black men were running to and fro, laughing, chaffing, and swearing at each other.  There lay the East Indiaman, with her foreign flag as well as that of her country. She had come in about midnight and at early dawn preliminaries had begun. Captain Corwin had been ashore a time or two, looking up and down amid the motley throng, and now he touched his hat and nodded to Chilian Leverett, who picked his way over to him.  \"We are somewhat late,\" he began apologetically. \"A little due to rough weather, but one can never fix an exact date.\"  \"All is well, I hope;\" in an anxious tone.  \"Yes; the child proved a good sailor and was much interested in everything. I was afraid she would take it hard. But she is counting on her father's coming. I don't know how you will ever console her when she learns the truth.\"  \"And he----\" Chilian looked intently into the captain's eyes.  \"I suppose the end has come before this. They thought he might last a month when we left. It's sad enough. He should have lived to be ninety. But matters went well with him, and he has been an honest, kindly, upright man with a large heart. I've lost my best friend and adviser.\"  The captain drew his rough coat-sleeve across his face and looked past Chilian, winking hard.  \"There's a sight of business when we come to that, Mr. Leverett, but now--will you go on board? The maid is a most excellent and sensible person. They are in the cabin.\"  \"Yes,\" he answered and followed with a curious throb at his heart--pity for the orphaned child and a sense of responsibility he was conscious that he accepted unwillingly, yet he would do his duty to the uttermost.  Already some officials were on hand, for at this period Salem was really a notable port. Chilian passed them with a bow, followed the captain down the gangplank, stared a little at the foreign deck-hands in their odd habiliments, stepped over boxes and bales in canvas and matting full of Oriental fragrance that from the closeness was almost stifling, coming from the clear air. Then he was ushered into the cabin, that was replete with Orientalism as well.  A rather tall woman rose to meet him.  \"This is Mistress Rachel Winn, who has mothered the little girl for several years, Mr. Leverett, her relative and guardian, and--Cynthia----\"  The child threw herself down on the couch.  \"I want to go back home. I want to see my father, and Aymeer, and Babo, and Nalla. I can't stay here.\"  \"But perhaps your father will bring them when he comes. Don't you remember he told you he lived here when he was a little boy, and what nice times he had with the cousin he loved? And the cousin is here to bid you welcome. Come and speak to him. We cannot go back at once, the ship has to unload her cargo and take in ever so many other things. See, here is Cousin Leverett.\"  She sat up, made a forward movement as if she would rise, but simply stared.  \"Yes, I am Cousin Leverett.\" He began advancing and held out his hand.  \"And very glad to see such an excellent traveller as you have been,\" said the captain. \"And such a nice little girl. You are an American girl; you know your father told you that. And this is your native town. Cousin Leverett remembers you when you were very little.\"  \"But I don't remember you;\" taking no notice of the proffered hand.  \"Then you must get acquainted with me. And you must tell me about your life and your father, whom I have not seen in a long, long time. Let us shake hands.\"  She held out hers then and raised herself to her feet.  \"Oh, how soft your hands are,\" she cried, \"just like Nalla's. But they are very white. Nalla's were brown.\"  \"And who was Nalla?\"  \"She used to come and play with me and make chains out of shells, and make bracelets and anklets, and dance. And she used to go to the Sahibs'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20726"],["title","A Slave is a Slave (#1)"],["body","centuries they had lived in isolation, spreading over a dozen hitherto undiscovered planets. Excalibur, Tizona, Gram, Morglay, Durendal, Flamberge, Curtana, Quernbiter; the names were a roll-call of fabulous blades of Old Terran legend.  Then they had erupted, suddenly and calamitously, into what was left of the Terran Federation as the Space Vikings, carrying pillage and destruction, until the newborn Empire rose to vanquish them. In the sixth Century Pre-Empire, one of their fleets had come from Morglay to Aditya.  The Adityans of that time had been near-barbarians; the descendants of the original settlers had been serfs of other barbarians who had come as mercenaries in the service of one or another of the local chieftains and had remained to loot and rule. Subjugating them had been easy; the Space Vikings had taken Aditya and made it their home. For several centuries, there had been communication between them and their home planet. Then Morglay had become involved in one of the interplanetary dynastic wars that had begun the decadence of the Space Vikings, and again Aditya dropped out of history.  Until this morning, when history returned in the black ships of the Galactic Empire.         *       *       *       *       *  He stubbed out the cigarette and summoned the robot to give him another. Shatrak was speaking:  \"You see, Count Erskyll, we really had to do it this way, for their own good.\" He wouldn't have credited the commodore with such guile; anything was justified, according to Obray of Erskyll, if done for somebody else's good. \"What we did, we just landed suddenly, knocked out their army, seized the center of government, before anybody could do anything. If we'd landed the way you'd wanted us to, somebody would have resisted, and the next thing, we'd have had to kill about five or six thousand of them and blow down a couple of towns, and we'd have lost a lot of our own people doing it. You might say, we had to do it to save them from themselves.\"  Obray of Erskyll seemed to have doubts, but before he could articulate them, Shatrak's communication-screen was calling attention to itself. The commodore flicked the switch, and his executive officer, Captain Patrique Morvill, appeared in it.  \"We've just gotten reports, sir, that some of Ravney's people have captured a half-dozen missile-launching sites around the city. His air-reconn tells him that that's the lot of them. I have an officer of one of the parties that participated. You ought to hear what he has to say, sir.\"  \"Well, good!\" Vann Shatrak whooshed out his breath. \"I don't mind admitting, I was a little on edge about that.\"  \"Wait till you hear what Lieutenant Carmath has to say.\" Morvill seemed to be strangling a laugh. \"Ready for him, Commodore?\"  Shatrak nodded; Morvill made a hand-signal and vanished in a flicker of rainbow colors; when the screen cleared, a young Landing-Troop lieutenant in battle-dress was looking out of it. He saluted and gave his name, rank and unit.  \"This missile-launching site I'm occupying, sir; it's twenty miles north-west of the city. We took it thirty minutes ago; no resistance whatever. There are four hundred or so people here. Of them, twelve, one dozen, are soldiers. The rest are civilians. Ten enlisted men, a non-com of some sort, and something that appears to be an officer. The officer had a pistol, fully loaded. The non-com had a submachine gun, empty, with two loaded clips on his belt. The privates had rifles, empty, and no ammunition. The officer did not know where the rifle ammunition was stored.\"  Shatrak swore. The second lieutenant nodded. \"Exactly my comment when he told me, sir. But this place is beautifully kept up. Lawns all mowed, trees neatly pruned, everything policed up like inspection morning. And there is a headquarters office building here adequate for an army division....\"  \"How about the armament, Lieutenant?\" Shatrak asked with forced patience.  \"Ah, yes; the armament, sir. There are eight big launching cradles for panplanetary or off-planet missiles. They are all polished up like the Crown Jewels. But none, repeat none, of them is operative. And there is not a single missile on the installation.\"  Shatrak's facial control didn't slip. It merely intensified, which amounted to the same thing.  \"Lieutenant Carmath, I am morally certain I heard you correctly, but let's just check. You said....\"  He repeated the lieutenant back, almost word for word. Carmath nodded.  \"That was it, sir. The missile-crypts are stacked full of old photoprints and recording and microfilm spools. The sighting-and-guidance systems for all the launchers are completely missing. The letoff mechanisms all lack major parts. There is an elaborate set of detection equipment, which will detect absolutely nothing. I saw a few pairs of binoculars about; I suspect that that is what we were first observed with.\"  \"This office, now; I suppose all the paperwork is up to the minute in quintulplicate, and initialed by everybody within sight or hearing?\"  \"I haven't checked on that yet, sir. If you're thinking of betting on it, please don't expect me to cover you, though.\"  \"Well, thank you, Lieutenant Carmath. Stick around; I'm sending down a tech-intelligence crew to look at what's left of the place. While you're waiting, you might sort out whoever seems to be in charge and find out just what in Nifflheim he thinks that launching-station was maintained for.\"  [Illustration]  \"I think I can tell you that, now, Commodore,\" Prince Trevannion said as Shatrak blanked the screen. \"We have a petrified authoritarianism. Quite likely some sort of an oligarchy; I'd guess that this Convocation thing they talk about consists of all the ruling class, everybody has equal voice, and nobody will take the responsibility for doing anything. And the actual work of government is probably handled by a corps of bureaucrats entrenched in their jobs, unwilling to exert any effort and afraid to invite any criticism, and living only to retire on their pensions. I've seen governments like that before.\" He named a few. \"One thing; once a government like that has been bludgeoned into the Empire, it rarely makes any trouble later.\"  \"Just to judge by this missileless non-launching station,\" Shatrak said, \"they couldn't even decide on what kind of trouble to make, or how to start it. I think you're going to have a nice easy Proconsulate here, Count Erskyll.\"  Count Erskyll started to say something. No doubt he was about to tell Shatrak, cuttingly, that he didn't want an easy Proconsulate, but an opportunity to help these people. He was saved from this by the buzzing of Shatrak's communication-screen.  It was Colonel Pyairr Ravney, the Navy Landing-Troop commander. Like everybody else who had gone down to Zeggensburg, he was in battle-dress and armed; the transpex visor of his helmet was pushed up. Between Shatrak's generation and Count Erskyll's, he sported a pointed mustache and a spiky chin-beard, which, on his thin and dark-eyed face, looked distinctly Mephistophelean. He was grinning.  \"Well, sir, I think we can call it a done job,\" he said. \"There's a delegation here who want to talk to the Lords-Master of the ships on behalf of the Lords-Master of the Convocation. Two of them, with about a dozen portfolio-bearers and note-takers. I'm not too good in Lingua Terra, outside Basic, at best, and their brand is far from that. I gather that they're some kind of civil-servants, personal representatives of the top Lords-Master.\"  \"Do we want to talk to them?\" Shatrak asked.  \"Well, we should only talk to the actual, titular, heads of the government--Mastership,\" Erskyll, suddenly protocol-conscious, objected. \"We can't negotiate with subordinates.\"  \"Oh, who's talking about negotiating; there isn't anything to negotiate. Aditya is now a part of the Galactic Empire. If this present regime assents to that, they can stay in power. If not, we will toss them out and install a new government. We will receive this delegation, inform them to that effect, and send them back to relay the information to their Lords-Master.\" He turned to the Commodore. \"May I speak to Colonel Ravney?\"  Shatrak assented. He asked Ravney where these Lords-Master were.  \"Here in the Citadel, in what they call the Convocation Chamber. Close to a thousand of them, screaming recriminations at one another. Sounds like feeding time at the Imperial Zoo. I think they all want to surrender, but nobody dares propose it first. I've just put a cordon around it and placed it off limits to everybody. And everything outside off limits to the Convocation.\"  \"Well thought of, Colonel. I suppose the Citadel teems with bureaucrats and such low life-forms?\"  \"Bulging with them. Literally thousands. Lanze Degbrend and Commander Douvrin and a few others are trying to get some sensible answers out of some of them.\"  \"This delegation; how had you thought of sending them up?\"  \"Landing-craft to _Isobel_; _Isobel_ will bring them the rest of the way.\"  He looked at his watch. \"Well, don't be in too much of a rush to get them here, Colonel. We don't want them till after lunch. Delay them on _Isobel_; the skipper can see that they have their own lunch aboard. And entertain them with some educational films. Something to convince them that there is slightly more to the Empire than one ship-of-the-line, two cruisers and four destroyers.\"  Count Erskyll was dissatisfied about that, too. He wanted to see the delegation at once and make arrangements to talk to their superiors. Count Erskyll, among other things, was zealous, and of this he disapproved. Zealous statesmen perhaps did more mischief than anything in the Galaxy--with the possible exception of procrastinating soldiers. That could indicate the fundamental difference between statecraft and war. He'd have to play with that idea a little.         *       *       *       *       *  An Empire ship-of-the-line was almost a mile in diameter. It was more than a"]]]
