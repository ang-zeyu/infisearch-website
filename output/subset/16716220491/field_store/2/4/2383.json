Moxton is a grave, stern man, but a sterling fellow for all that, and in good practice.  Now, what do you think!\"  \"Well, uncle,\" replied Ned, \"I've never concealed my thoughts from you since the day you took me by the hand, eleven years ago, and brought me to live under your roof; and I'll not begin to dissemble now.  The plain truth is, that I don't like it at all.\"  \"Stop, now,\" cried Mr Shirley, with a grieved expression of countenance; \"don't be hasty in forming your opinion.  Besides, my boy, you ought to be more ready to take my advice, even although it be not altogether palatable.\"  \"My dear uncle, you quite misunderstand me.  I only tell you what I _think_ about the proposal.  As to taking your advice, I fully intend to do that whether I like it or not; but I think, if you will listen to me for a few minutes, you will change your mind in regard to this matter. You know that I am very fond of travelling, and that I dislike the idea of taking up my abode on the top of a three-legged stool, either as a lawyer's or a merchant's clerk.  Well, unless a man likes his profession, and goes at it with a will, he cannot hope to succeed, so that I have no prospect of getting on, I fear, in the line you wish me to adopt.  Besides, there are plenty of poor fellows out of work, who love sitting still from nine a.m. to ten p.m., and whose bread I would be taking out of their mouths by devoting myself to the legal profession, and--\"  At this point Ned hesitated for a moment, and his uncle broke in with--  \"Tell me, now, if every one thought about business as you do, how would the world get on, think you?\"  \"Badly, I fear,\" replied the youth, with a smile; \"but everybody doesn't think of it as I do; and, tell me, uncle, if everybody thought of business as you would wish me to do, what would come of the soldiers and sailors who defend our empire, and extend our foreign trade, and achieve the grand geographical discoveries that have of late added so much lustre to the British name?\"  Ned flushed and became quite eloquent at this point.  \"Now, look at California,\" he continued; \"there's a magnificent region, full of gold; not a mere myth, or an exaggeration, but a veritable fact, attested by the arrival of letters and gold-dust every month.  Surely that land was made to be peopled; and the poor savages who dwell there need to be converted to Christianity, and delivered from their degraded condition; and the country must be worked, and its resources be developed; and who's to do it, if enterprising clergymen, and schoolmasters, and miners do not go to live there, and push their fortunes?\"  \"And which of the three callings do you propose adopting?\" inquired Mr Shirley, with a peculiar smile.  \"Well uncle, I--a--the fact is, I have not thought much about that as yet.  Of course, I never thought of the first.  I do not forget your own remark, that the calling of a minister of the gospel of Christ is not, like other professions, to be adopted merely as a means of livelihood. Then, as to the second, I might perhaps manage that; but I don't think it would suit me.\"  \"Do you think, then, that you would make a good digger?\"  \"Well, perhaps I would,\" replied Ned, modestly.  Mr Shirley gravely regarded the powerful frame that reclined in the easy-chair before him, and was compelled to admit that the supposition was by no means outrageous.  \"Besides,\" continued the youth, \"I might turn my hand to many things in a new country.  You know I have studied surveying, and I can sketch a little, and know something of architecture.  I suppose that Latin and Greek would not be of much use, but the little I have picked up of medicine and surgery among the medical students would be useful.  Then I could take notes, and sketch the scenery, and bring back a mass of material that might interest the public, and do good to the country.\"  \"Oh,\" said the old gentleman, shortly; \"come back and turn author, in fact, and write a book that nobody would publish, or which, in the event of its being published, nobody would read!\"  \"Come, now, my dear uncle, don't laugh at me.  I assure you it seems very reasonable to me to think that what others have done, and are doing every day, I am able to do.\"  \"Well, I won't laugh at you; but, to be serious, you are wise enough to know that an old man's experience is worth more than a youth's fancies. Much of what you have said is true, I admit, but I assure you that the bright prospects you have cut out for yourself are very delusive.  They will never be realised, at least in the shape in which you have depicted them on your imagination.  They will dissolve, my boy, on a nearer approach, and, as Shakespeare has it, `like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wrack behind,' or, at least, not much more than a wrack.\"  Ned reverted to the golden dream, and felt uneasy under his uncle's kind but earnest gaze.  \"Most men,\" continued Mr Shirley, \"enjoy themselves at first, when they go to wild countries in search of adventure, but they generally regret the loss of their best years afterwards.  In my opinion men should never emigrate unless they purpose making the foreign land they go to their _home_.  But I won't oppose you, if you are determined to go; I will do all I can to help you, and give you my blessing; but before you make up your mind, I would recommend you to call on Mr Moxton, and hear what prospects he holds out to you.  Then take a week to think seriously over it; and if at the end of that time, you are as anxious to go as ever, I'll not stand in your way.\"  \"You are kind to me, uncle; more so than I deserve,\" said Ned earnestly. \"I'll do as you desire, and you may depend upon it that the generous way in which you have left me to make my own choice will influence me against going abroad more than anything else.\"  Ned sighed as he rose to quit the room, for he felt that his hopes at that moment were sinking.  \"And before you take a step in the matter, my boy,\" said old Mr Shirley, \"go to your room and ask counsel of Him who alone has the power to direct your steps in this life.\"  Ned replied briefly, \"I will, uncle,\" and hastily left the room.  Mr Shirley poked the fire, put on his spectacles, smoothed out the wrinkles on his bald forehead with his hand, took up the _Times_, and settled himself down in his easy-chair to read; but his nephew's prospects could not be banished from his mind.  He went over the whole argument again, mentally, with copious additions, ere he became aware of the fact, that for three-quarters of an hour he had been, (apparently), reading the newspaper upside down.    CHAPTER THREE.  HOPES AND FEARS--MR. SHIRLEY RECEIVES A VISIT AND A WILD PROPOSAL.  When Edward Sinton left his chamber, an hour after the conversation related in the last chapter, his brow was unruffled and his step light. He had made up his mind that, come what might, he would not resist the wishes of his only near relative and his best friend.  There was a day in the period of early boyhood that remained as fresh on the memory of young Sinton as if it had been yesterday--the day on which his mother died.  The desolation of his early home on that day was like the rising of a dark thunder-cloud on a bright sky.  His young heart was crushed, his mind stunned, and the first ray of light that broke upon him--the first gush of relief--was when his uncle arrived and took him on his knee, and, seated beside the bed where that cold, still form lay, wept upon the child's neck as if his heart would break.  Mr Shirley buried the sister whom he had been too late to see alive.  Then he and his little nephew left the quiet country village and went to dwell in the great city of London.  From that time forward Mr Shirley was a father to Ned, who loved him more than any one else on earth, and through his influence he was early led to love and reverence his heavenly Father and his blessed Redeemer.  The subject of going abroad was the first in regard to which Ned and his uncle had seriously disagreed, and the effect on the feelings of both was very strong.  Ned's mind wandered as he put on his hat, and buttoned his great-coat up to the chin, and drew on his gloves slowly.  He was not vain of his personal appearance; neither was he reckless of it.  He always struck you as being a particularly well-dressed man, and he had naturally a dashing look about him.  Poor fellow! he felt anything but dashing or reckless as he hurried through the crowded streets in the direction of the city that day.  Moxton's door was a green one, with a brass knocker and a brass plate, both of which ornaments, owing to verdigris, were anything but ornamental.  The plate was almost useless, being nearly illegible, but the knocker was still fit for duty.  The street was narrow--as Ned observed with a feeling of deep depression--and the house to which the green door belonged, besides being dirty, retreated a little, as if it were ashamed of itself.  On the knocker being applied, the green door was opened by a disagreeable-looking old woman, who answered to the question, \"Is Mr Moxton in?\" with a short \"Yes,\" and, without farther remark, ushered our hero into a very dingy and particularly small office, which, owing to the insufficient quantity of daylight that struggled through the dirty little windows, required to be lighted with gas.  Ned felt, so to speak, like a thermometer which was falling rapidly.  \"Can I see Mr Moxton?\" he inquired of a small dishevelled clerk, who sat on a tall stool behind a high desk, engaged in writing his name in every imaginable form on a sheet of note paper.  The dishevelled clerk pointed to a door which opened into an inner apartment, and resumed his occupation.  Ned tapped at the door indicated.  \"Come in,\" cried a stern voice.  Ned, (as a thermometer), fell considerably lower.  On entering, he beheld a tall, gaunt man, with a sour cast of countenance, standing with his back to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21735"],["title","The Floating Light of the Goodwin Sands (#1)"],["body","isintegration.  Coffee went down in half-cup gulps; shrimps disappeared in shoals, shells and all; and--in short, his proceedings might have explained to an intelligent observer how it is that so many men grow to be exceedingly fat, and why it is that hotel proprietors cannot afford to lower their apparently exorbitant charges. The waiter, standing modestly by, and looking on with solemn interest, mentally attributed the traveller's extraordinary powers and high health to the fact that he neither smoked nor drank.  It would be presumptuous in us to hazard a speculation on this subject in the face of an opinion held by one who was so thoroughly competent to judge.  Breakfast over, the keen-eyed man put on his hat and overcoat and sallied forth to the harbour, where he spent the greater part of the forenoon in loitering about, inspecting the boats--particularly the lifeboat--and the shipping with much interest, and entering into conversation with the boatmen who lounged upon the pier.  He was very gracious to the coxswain of the lifeboat--a bluff, deep-chested, hearty, neck-or-nothing sort of man, with an intelligent eye, almost as keen as his own, and a manner quite as prompt.  With this coxswain he conversed long about the nature of his stirring and dangerous duties.  He then made inquiry about his crew: how many men he had, and their circumstances; and, by the way, whether any of them happened to be named Jones.  One of them was so named, the coxswain said--Tom Jones.  This led the traveller to ask if Tom Jones owned a small sloop.  No, he didn't own a sloop, not even a boat.  Was there any other Jones in the town who owned a small sloop and dealt largely in cured fish?  Yes there was, and he was a regular gallow's-bird, if all reports were true, the coxswain told him.  The traveller did not press the subject long.  Having brought it up as it were incidentally, he dismissed it carelessly, and again concentrated his attention and interest on the lifeboat.  To all the men with whom he conversed this bluff man with the keen grey eyes put the same question, and he so contrived to put it that it seemed to be a matter of comparatively little interest to him whether there was or was not a man of the name of Jones in the town.  Nevertheless, he gained all the information about Jones that he desired, and then, hiring a boat, set out for the floating light.  The weather, that had appeared threatening during the night, suddenly became calm and fine, as if to corroborate the statement of the waiter of the Fortress Hotel in regard to its uncertainty; but knowing men in oilcloth sou'westers and long boots gave it as their opinion that the weather was not to be trusted.  Fortunately for the traveller, it remained trustworthy long enough to serve his purpose.  The calm permitted his boat to go safely alongside of the light-ship, and to climb up the side without difficulty.  The vessel in which he found himself was not by any means what we should style clipper-built--quite the reverse.  It was short for its length, bluff in the bows, round in the stern, and painted all over, excepting the mast and deck, of a bright red colour, like a great scarlet dragon, or a gigantic boiled lobster.  It might have been mistaken for the first attempt in the ship-building way of an infatuated boy, whose acquaintance with ships was founded on hearsay, and whose taste in colour was violently eccentric.  This remarkable thing had one immense mast in the middle of it, supported by six stays, like the Norse galleys of old, but it had no yards; for, although the sea was indeed its home, and it incessantly braved the fury of the storm, diurnally cleft the waters of flood and ebb-tide, and gallantly breasted the billows of ocean all the year round, it had no need of sails.  It never advanced an inch on its course, for it had no course.  It never made for any port. It was never either homeward or outward bound.  No streaming eyes ever watched its departure; no beating hearts ever hailed its return.  Its bowsprit never pointed either to \"Greenland's icy mountains, or India's coral strand,\" for it had no bowsprit at all.  Its helm was never swayed to port or starboard, although it _had_ a helm, because the vessel turned submissive with the tides, and its rudder, being lashed hard and fast amidships--like most weather-cocks--couldn't move.  Its doom was to tug perpetually, day and night, from year to year, at a gigantic anchor which would not let go, and to strain at a monster chain-cable which would not snap--in short, to strive for ever, like Sisyphus, after something which can never be attained.  A sad destiny, some may be tempted to exclaim.  No, reader, not so sad as it appears.  We have presented but one side of the picture.  That curious, almost ridiculous-looking craft, was among the aristocracy of shipping.  Its important office stamped it with nobility.  It lay there, conspicuous in its royal colour, from day to day and year to year, to mark the fair-way between the white cliffs of Old England and the outlying shoals--distinguished in daylight by a huge ball at its mast-head, and at night by a magnificent lantern with argand lamps and concave reflectors, which shot its rays like lightning far and wide over the watery waste, while, in thick weather, when neither ball nor light could be discerned, a sonorous gong gave its deep-toned warning to the approaching mariner, and let him know his position amid the surrounding dangers.  Without such warnings by night and by day, the world would suffer the loss of thousands of lives and untold millions of gold. Indeed the mere absence of such warnings for one stormy night would certainly result in loss irreparable to life and property.  As well might Great Britain dispense with her armies as with her floating lights!  That boiled-lobster-like craft was also, if we may be allowed to say so, stamped with magnanimity, because its services were disinterested and universal.  While other ships were sailing grandly to their ports in all their canvas panoply, and swelling with the pride of costly merchandise within, each unmindful of the other, _this_ ship remained floating there, destitute of cargo, either rich or poor, never in port, always on service, serene in all the majesty of her one settled self-sacrificing purpose--to guide the converging navies of the world safely past the dangerous shoals that meet them on their passage to the world's greatest port, the Thames, or to speed them safely thence when outward-bound.  That unclipperly craft, moreover, was a gallant vessel, because its post was one of danger.  When other ships fled on the wings of terror--or of storm trysails--to seek refuge in harbour and roadstead, this one merely lengthened her cable--as a knight might shake loose the reins of his war-horse on the eve of conflict--and calmly awaited the issue, prepared to let the storm do its worst, and to meet it with a bold front.  It lay right in the Channel, too, \"i' the imminent deadly breach,\" as it were, prepared to risk encounter with the thousands of ships, great and small, which passed to and fro continually;--to be grazed and fouled by clumsy steersmen, and to be run into at night by unmanageable wrecks or derelicts; ready for anything in fact--come weal come woe, blow high blow low--in the way of duty, for this vessel was the Floating Light that marked the Gull-stream off the celebrated and fatal Goodwin Sands.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE FLOATING LIGHT BECOMES THE SCENE OF FLOATING SURMISES AND VAGUE SUSPICIONS.  It must not be supposed, from what has been said, that the Gull Lightship was the only vessel of the kind that existed at that time. But she was a good type of the class of vessels (numbering at present about sixty) to which she belonged, and, both as regarded her situation and duties, was, and still is, one of the most interesting among the floating lights of the kingdom.  When the keen-eyed traveller stepped upon her well-scrubbed deck, he was courteously received by the mate, Mr John Welton, a strongly-built man above six feet in height, with a profusion of red hair, huge whiskers, and a very peculiar expression of countenance, in which were united calm self-possession, coolness, and firmness, with great good-humour and affability.  \"You are Mr Welton, I presume?\" said the traveller abruptly, touching his hat with his forefinger in acknowledgment of a similar salute from the mate.  \"That is my name, sir.\"  \"Will you do me the favour to read this letter?\" said the traveller, selecting a document from a portly pocket-book, and presenting it.  Without reply the mate unfolded the letter and quietly read it through, after which he folded and returned it to his visitor, remarking that he should be happy to furnish him with all the information he desired, if he would do him the favour to step down into the cabin.  \"I may set your mind at rest on one point at once,\" observed the stranger, as he moved towards the companion-hatch, \"my investigations have no reference whatever to yourself.\"  Mr Welton made no reply, but a slight look of perplexity that had rested on his brow while he read the letter cleared away.  \"Follow me, Mr Larks,\" he said, turning and descending the ladder sailor-fashion--which means crab-wise.  \"Do you happen to know anything,\" asked Mr Larks, as he prepared to follow, \"about a man of the name of Jones?  I have come to inquire particularly about him, and about your son, who, I am told--\"  The remainder of the sentence was lost in the cabin of the floating light.  Here, with the door and skylight shut, the mate remained closeted for a long time in close conference with the keen-eyed man, much to the surprise of the two men who constituted the watch on deck, because visitors of any kind to a floating light were about as rare as snowflakes in July, and the sudden advent of a visitor, who looked and acted mysteriously, was in itself a profound mystery.  Their curiosity, however, "]]]
