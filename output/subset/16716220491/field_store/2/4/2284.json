But jealous little Mrs. Ladybug had no such misgivings. _She_ went out of her way to explain to people that if they noticed a change in Betsy Butterfly's appearance, they might thank _her_ for it.... \"I told Betsy that she ought to brush the dust off herself,\" she informed her friends.  Naturally she was displeased when she met Betsy that very afternoon and saw that the dust still lay thick on her wings.  \"I believe you actually want to be untidy!\" Mrs. Ladybug cried. \"And if you aren't going to brush that dust off, I shall do it myself!\" And grasping a small Indian paint-brush, the weight of which she could scarcely stagger under, Mrs. Ladybug advanced upon Betsy Butterfly with a determined look in her eye.  \"Oh, don't do that!\" cried Betsy.  \"It's my painful duty to give you a thorough dusting,\" Mrs. Ladybug declared.     VII  BUTTERFLY BILL   NOW, a crowd had gathered quickly around Betsy Butterfly and Mrs. Ladybug; for the field people are quick to notice anything unusual. And a sprightly young cousin of Betsy's known as Butterfly Bill said to Mrs. Ladybug, with a wink at everybody else:  \"I suppose you'll dust the rest of us, too?\"  \"Only those that need it!\" replied Mrs. Ladybug.  \"Then you'll have your hands full,\" Butterfly Bill told her. \"Maybe you haven't noticed that every member of the Butterfly family in Pleasant Valley is covered with dust just as Betsy is.\"  Mrs. Ladybug looked surprised.  \"Is that so?\" she said faintly.  \"It certainly is!\" Bill cried. \"Maybe you never knew that the dust is what gives us our--_ahem_--our beautiful colors,\" he added proudly. \"And I warn you that if you so much as touch my lovely cousin with that brush you'll have every one of us fellows in your hair.\"  Of course poor Mrs. Ladybug was quite bald. But she knew what Butterfly Bill meant. And she was so upset that she promptly let the paint-brush fall to the ground.  Then Betsy's cousin nodded approvingly.  \"Now you'd better hurry home,\" he told Mrs. Ladybug. \"There's a rumor around the meadow that your house is on fire. And they say your children are in great danger.\"  Little Mrs. Ladybug at once fell to weeping.  \"It's that horrid Freddie Firefly!\" she shrieked. \"I've told him to keep away from my home. I've told him that he would set it to blazing with that light of his. But he's forever sneaking around my house as soon as my back is turned.\"  \"There, there! Don't be frightened!\" Betsy Butterfly said to her soothingly. \"It's only a rumor, you know.\"  \"That's so,\" Mrs. Ladybug admitted, drying her eyes. \"I hear it almost every day, too. But I never can get used to it.... I suppose this is only a false alarm, after all.\"  \"I wouldn't be so sure about that,\" Butterfly Bill said wickedly, with a shake of his head. \"And if I were you I'd look after my own family a little more carefully, instead of troubling myself with other people's affairs.\"  Several of Bill's friends applauded his speech. But Betsy Butterfly whispered to him to hush.  \"Don't you see that Mrs. Ladybug is not quite herself?\" she asked him.  But Butterfly Bill was not a person to be easily silenced like that.  \"She's a meddling busybody!\" he declared. \"And it's my opinion that she ought to be put where she'll have to mind her own business.\"  \"Who--me?\" called a wheezing voice right in his ear.  Turning, Butterfly Bill saw that it was Jennie Junebug who had spoken to him. She had noticed the crowd from a distance. And she had just arrived, quite out of breath.  Before Betsy Butterfly's cousin Bill could answer, Jennie Junebug actually threatened him.  \"If you were talking about me I shall have to knock you down,\" she declared.  He had heard that Jennie delighted in flying _bang_ into anybody. But he did not know that she indulged in that unladylike trick _only after dark_.  \"Of course I didn't mean you!\" he said hastily.  \"And I hope you didn't mean my friend Mrs. Ladybug, either,\" Jennie Junebug added. \"For if you did----\"  But Butterfly Bill waited to hear no more. Thoroughly frightened, he sought safety in flight. And as he flew away Mrs. Ladybug couldn't help noticing the dust on his wings.  \"They're certainly a peculiar lot--that Butterfly family!\" she muttered.     VIII  DO YOU LIKE BUTTER?   AFTER Mrs. Ladybug failed in her attempt to brush the dust off Betsy Butterfly she grew more jealous of Betsy than ever.  It was really a shame that Mrs. Ladybug should feel like that. Usually she was quite harmless, even if she was a busybody and a gossip. But she simply couldn't forgive Betsy Butterfly for being so beautiful. And now Mrs. Ladybug began to neglect her children more than ever, in order to spy upon Betsy in the hope of discovering some new fault in her.  Betsy Butterfly soon noticed that wherever she went she was sure to see Mrs. Ladybug, who had a way of bobbing up in a most startling fashion. But Betsy was always quite polite to the jealous little creature. And she never failed to inquire for her health and that of her children as well, even if she met Mrs. Ladybug a dozen times a day.  For some reason Mrs. Ladybug seemed quite touchy, where her family was concerned.  \"You don't need to ask about my children,\" she told Betsy at last in a somewhat sharp tone. \"They are in the best of health. And I'll let you know in case they fall ill.... It's strange,\" she continued, \"how everybody in this neighborhood is always prying into my household affairs.\"  Betsy Butterfly smiled to herself. She did not care to quarrel with Mrs. Ladybug--nor with anyone else, for that matter. So she abruptly changed the subject.  \"Do you like butter?\" she asked.  \"Why, no!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"I don't care anything about it. At least, I never ate any.\"  \"Then I don't see how you know whether you like it or not,\" Betsy observed, \"unless you've looked into a buttercup to find out.\"  Mrs. Ladybug was interested, in spite of herself.  \"Can a person tell by doing that?\" she wanted to know.  \"It's a sure way,\" said Betsy Butterfly. \"I was just looking into this buttercup that I'm sitting on when you flew up and spoke to me.\"  \"Do _you_ like butter?\" Mrs. Ladybug inquired.  \"I'm afraid not,\" Betsy told her.  \"I'd like to try, myself,\" Mrs. Ladybug exclaimed eagerly. \"But I don't know how.\"  \"It's simple enough,\" Betsy Butterfly replied. \"You just look into a buttercup blossom.  \"And if it makes your face yellow, then you're fond of butter--whether you ever had any or not.\"  So Mrs. Ladybug perched herself on a big blossom and peered earnestly into its cup.  \"Is my face yellow?\" she asked Betsy.  \"I do believe it is!\" Betsy Butterfly cried.  And Mrs. Ladybug looked much pleased.  \"I've always known I had refined tastes,\" she remarked with a lofty air. \"And now I'd like to sample a bit of butter; but I don't know where to find any.\"  \"Butter? They make it at the farmhouse,\" Betsy informed her.  \"Then perhaps Farmer Green's wife will let me have a little,\" Mrs. Ladybug said hopefully. \"I'll go over to the farmhouse at once.... It's too bad you don't like butter, too,\" she added.  But secretly she was delighted that Betsy Butterfly had looked into a buttercup in vain.     IX  UNEXPECTED NEWS   LITTLE Mrs. Ladybug had a disappointment when she reached the farmhouse. She found, to her dismay, that she couldn't get inside it; for wire screens blocked her way through both doors and windows. And nobody paid the slightest attention to her when she stopped at the buttery window and asked if she couldn't please have a bit of butter.  There was plenty of golden butter right there in plain sight, since it happened to be churning day. And Farmer Green's wife, with her sleeves rolled above her elbows, was working busily on the other side of the window screen.  \"I should think she might easily spare me a small sample!\" Mrs. Ladybug cried at last. \"I'm afraid Farmer Green's wife is stingy.\"  Mrs. Ladybug hoped that Johnnie Green's mother would hear her remark. But she didn't. And in the end Mrs. Ladybug had to fly away with her longing for butter still unsatisfied.  Meanwhile Betsy Butterfly had been amusing herself in the meadow to her heart's content. To tell the truth, it was rather a relief to be rid of Mrs. Ladybug's society for so long a time. And Betsy hoped that Mrs. Ladybug's errand to the farmhouse would keep that busybody engaged for the rest of the day.  Now, after she left the farmhouse Mrs. Ladybug set out to find Betsy Butterfly again. But meeting Daddy Longlegs near the stone wall, she stopped to gossip with him, telling him how she had learned that she liked butter, and explaining that she had not yet tasted any.  \"So you looked into a buttercup to find out, eh?\" said Daddy Longlegs. \"I'll have to do that, myself. Maybe I've always liked butter, too, without knowing that I do.\"  \"You can't tell till you try,\" Mrs. Ladybug remarked. \"But you mustn't be too sure. You may be disappointed. There's Betsy Butterfly! She doesn't care for butter at all.\"  \"Are you sure about that?\" Daddy Longlegs inquired. \"Really, I think you must be mistaken, for I saw her with her face just _buried_ in butter this very day.\"  At first Mrs. Ladybug looked at him in amazement. And then she grew very angry.  \"Betsy Butterfly deceived me!\" she cried in a shrill voice. \"She was afraid that if I knew she ate butter she would have to share it with me.... I'd like to know where she gets her butter,\" Mrs. Ladybug mused.  \"She was standing on some of Farmer Green's, when I saw her,\" Daddy Longlegs explained.  \"Did she ask him for it?\" Mrs. Ladybug demanded.  \"I don't believe she did,\" he admitted. \"I think she just took it.\"  A wicked gleam came into Mrs. Ladybug's eyes when she learned that. And she threw up her hands, exclaiming, \"She steals! Betsy Butterfly steals butter! When the field people hear the news they won't think she's so fine.\" And then Mrs. Ladybug turned to Daddy Longlegs once more and demanded whether he knew of anything else that Betsy Butterfly was in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21324"],["title","Recollections of Old Liverpool (#1)"],["body","chapters, but such was the interest they created, that they were extended to their present length.  Those who have recorded the green memories of an old man, as told while seated by his humble \"ingle nook\" have endeavoured to adhere to his own words and mode of narration--hence the somewhat rambling and discursive style of these \"Recollections\"--a style which does not, in the opinion of many, by any means detract from their general interest.  The frontispiece is copied (by special permission) from part of a very finely-painted view of Liverpool, by Jenkinson, dated 1813, in the possession of Thomas Dawson, Esq., Rodney-street.  The vignette of the Mill which stood at the North end of the St. James' Quarry in the title page, is from an original water colour drawing by an amateur (name unknown), dated 1821.  _November_, 1863.     CHAPTER I.   I was born in Liverpool, on the 4th of June in 1769 or '70.  I am consequently about ninety-three years old.  My friends say I am a wonderful old man.  I believe I am.  I have always enjoyed such excellent health, that I do not know what the sensation is of a medical man putting his finger on my wrist.  I have eaten and drunk in moderation, slept little, risen early, and kept a clear conscience before God and man.  My memory is surprising.  I am often astonished at myself in recalling to mind events, persons, and circumstances, that occurred so long ago as to be almost forgotten by everybody else.  I can recollect every occurrence that has fallen under my cognizance, since I was six years old.  I do not remember so well events that have taken place during the last twenty or thirty years, as they seem confused to me; but whatever happened of which I had some knowledge during my boyish days and early manhood, is most vividly impressed upon my memory. My family have been long-livers.  My father was ninety odd, when he died, my mother near that age at her death.  My brother and sister are still living, are healthy, and, like myself, in comfortable circumstances.  I may be seen any fine day on the Pier-head or Landing-stage, accompanied by one of my dear great grandchildren; but you would not take me to be more than sixty by my air and appearance.  We lived in a street out of Church-street, nearly opposite St. Peter's. I was born there.  At that time the churchyard was enclosed by trees, and the gravestones were erect.  One by one the trees died or were destroyed by mischievous boys, and unfortunately they were not replaced.  The church presented then a very pretty appearance.  Within the last thirty years there was one tree standing nearly opposite to the Blue Coat School.  When that tree died, I regretted its loss as of an old friend. The stocks were placed just within the rails, nearly opposite the present extensive premises occupied by the Elkingtons.  Many and many a man have I seen seated in them for various light offences, though in many cases the punishment was heavy, especially if the culprit was obnoxious in any way, or had made himself so by his own conduct.  The town boys were very cruel in my young days.  It was a cruel time, and the effects of the slave-trade and privateering were visible in the conduct of the lower classes and of society generally.  Goodness knows the town boys are cruel now, but they are angels to what their predecessors were.  I think education has done some good.  All sorts of mischievous tricks used to be played upon the culprits in the stocks; and I have seen stout and sturdy fellows faint under the sufferings they endured.  By the way, at the top of Marybone, there was once a large pond, called the Flashes, where there was a ducking-post and this was a favourite place of punishment when the Lynch Law of that time was carried out.  I once saw a woman ducked there. She might have said with Queen Catherine:--      \"Do with me what you will,     For any change must better my condition.\"  There was a terrible row caused once by the rescue of a woman from the Cuckstool.  At one time it threatened to be serious.  The mayor was dining at my father's, and I recollect he was sent for in a great hurry, and my father and his guests all went with him to the pond.  The woman was nearly killed, and her life for long despaired of.  She was taken to the Infirmary, on the top of Shaw's Brow, where St. George's Hall now stands.  The way they ducked was this.  A long pole, which acted as a lever, was placed on a post; at the end of the pole was a chair, in which the culprit was seated; and by ropes at the other end of the lever or pole, the culprit was elevated or dipped in the water at the mercy of the wretches who had taken upon themselves the task of executing punishment. The screams of the poor women who were ducked were frightful.  There was a ducking tub in the House of Correction, which was in use in Mr. Howard's time.  I once went with him through the prison (as I shall describe presently) and saw it there.  It was not till 1804 or 1805 that it was done away with.  My father was owner and commander of the _Mary Ellen_.  She was launched on the 4th of June, my birthday, and also the anniversary of our revered sovereign, George III.  We used to keep his majesty's birthday in great style.  The bells were set ringing, cannon fired, colours waved in the wind, and all the schools had holiday.  We don't love the gracious Lady who presides over our destinies less than we did her august grandfather, but I am sure we do not keep her birthday as we did his.  The _Mary Ellen_ was launched on the 4th of June, 1775.  She was named after and by my mother.  The launch of this ship is about the first thing I can remember.  The day's proceedings are indelibly fixed upon my memory.  We went down to the place where the ship was built, accompanied by our friends.  We made quite a little procession, headed by a drum and fife. My father and mother walked first, leading me by the hand.  I had new clothes on, and I firmly believed that the joy bells were ringing solely because _our_ ship was to be launched.  The _Mary Ellen_ was launched from a piece of open ground just beyond the present Salt-house Dock, then called, \"the South Dock.\"  I suppose the exact place would be somewhere about the middle of the present King's Dock.  The bank on which the ship was built sloped down to the river.  There was a slight boarding round her.  There were several other ships and smaller vessels building near her; amongst others, a frigate which afterwards did great damage to the enemy during the French war.  The government frequently gave orders for ships to be built at Liverpool.  The view up the river was very fine. There were few houses to be seen southward.  The mills on the Aigburth-road were the principal objects.  It was a pretty sight to see the _Mary Ellen_ launched.  There were crowds of people present, for my father was well-known and very popular. When the ship moved off there was a great cheer raised.  I was so excited at the great \"splash\" which was made, that I cried, and was for a time inconsolable, because they would not launch the ship again, so that I might witness another great \"splash.\"  I can, in my mind's eye, see \"the splash\" of the _Mary Ellen_ even now.  I really believe the displacement of the water on that occasion opened the doors of observation in my mind. After the launch there was great festivity and hilarity.  I believe I made myself very ill with the quantity of fruit and good things I became possessed of.  While the _Mary Ellen_ was fitting-up for sea, I was often taken on board.  In her hold were long shelves with ring-bolts in rows in several places.  I used to run along these shelves, little thinking what dreadful scenes would be enacted upon them.  The fact is that the _Mary Ellen_ was destined for the African trade, in which she made many very successful voyages.  In 1779, however, she was converted into a privateer.  My father, at the present time, would not, perhaps, be thought very respectable; but I assure you he was so considered in those days.  So many people in Liverpool were, to use an old and trite sea-phrase, \"tarred with the same brush\" that these occupations were scarcely, indeed, were not at all, regarded as anything derogatory from a man's character.  In fact, during the privateering time, there was scarcely a man, woman, or child in Liverpool, of any standing, that did not hold a share in one of these ships.  Although a slave captain, and afterwards a privateer, my father was a kind and just man--a good father, husband, and friend.  His purse and advice were always ready to help and save, and he was, consequently, much respected by the merchants with whom he had intercourse.  I have been told that he was quite a different man at sea, that there he was harsh, unbending and stern, but still just. How he used to rule the turbulent spirits of his crews I don't know, but certain it is that he never wanted men when other Liverpool ship-owners were short of hands.  Many of his seamen sailed voyage after voyage with him.  It was these old hands that were attached to him who I suspect kept the others in subjection.  The men used to make much of me.  They made me little sea toys, and always brought my mother and myself presents from Africa, such as parrots, monkeys, shells, and articles of the natives' workmanship.  I recollect very well, after the _Mary Ellen_ had been converted into a privateer, that, on her return from a successful West Indian cruise, the mate of the ship, a great big fellow, named Blake, and who was one of the roughest and most ungainly men ever seen, would insist upon my mother accepting a beautiful chain, of Indian workmanship, to which was attached the miniature of a very lovely woman.  I doubt the rascal did not come by it very honestly, neither was a costly bracelet that one of my father's best hands (once a Northwich salt-flatman) brought home for my baby sister.  This man would insist upon putting it on the baby"]]]
