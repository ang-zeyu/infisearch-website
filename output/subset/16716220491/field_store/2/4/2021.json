Shall you go in the launch?\" he added, hoping with all his strength that the officer would not take the motor boat with him.  \"Certainly,\" was the quick reply. \"I must make progress, you know!\"  Jimmie and Jack, who had followed their chum to the nipa hut, now entered and stood by the door. Ned saw them winking knowingly at each other when the Major spoke of going away in the motor boat, and decided to prod their inclinations a bit.  \"I shall be sorry to have the _Manhattan_ away just now,\" he said, \"for we might use her to good advantage during your absence. However, there seems to be no other way.\"  Jimmie and Jack slid out of the doorway and down the oscillating bamboo stairs, and when, an hour later, the Major went to the little dock where the _Manhattan_ lay he found the two boys working over her, sweating and complaining in loud voices against the inefficiency of modern motor boat manufacturers. The Major went on with his preparations for departure, never doubting that the _Manhattan_ would be ready for him in a few minutes. At last Jimmie turned an oil-smeared face toward Ned.  \"No use,\" he exclaimed, \"she won't go! The batteries are off and there's something wrong with the carbureter, and the spark-plug is twisted, and the delivery is all to the bad. Perhaps Major Ross can bring new parts down from Manila.\"  \"Shut up, you dunce!\" whispered Jack. \"You'll give yourself away!\"  Captain Godwin nudged Ned with an elbow and turned his laughing eyes away. He saw what the boys were doing, and rather approved of the idea of journeys among the islands in the motor boat during the Major's absence.  \"Preposterous!\" shouted the Major. \"You must get the boat in shape to make the voyage to Manila! My mission will not endure delay. Captain Godwin, see what you can do with the boat.\"  Captain Godwin knew about as much of the running gear of a motor boat as did Jimmie, but he at once oiled up his hands and his face and tugged and pulled at the wheel, tapped on the supply pipes, investigated the electric appliance, and finally announced that the boat was not in running order.  The Major blustered about for a few moments and then set forth on his mission in the canoe in which the party had landed.  \"Perhaps,\" he said, at parting, \"I may be able to catch a ship at Banglo, or whatever the name of that little pueblo is on the island to the west. In that case I shall return inside of ten days.\"  And so the Major went away, urging the rowers to greater exertions and wiping his red face with a red handkerchief. Then a strange thing happened. Jack drove Jimmie away from the _Manhattan_, asked Captain Godwin to bring him a wrench, and in ten minutes, or as soon as the canoe bearing the disgusted Major was conveniently around a bend, the boat was sailing about on the river like a bird in the sky.  Captain Godwin started to censure the boys for the deception they had practiced on the Major, but his severe words ended in a laugh.  \"You helped!\" Jimmie said, accusingly. \"You knew what was up! Why didn't you tell him?\"  \"We'll discuss that later,\" was the smiling reply.  \"Anyway,\" Jimmie said, \"we're rid of the old bluffer, and may be able to do somethin', if he stays away long enough.\"  \"You came near spoiling the whole thing,\" declared Jack, grinning at Jimmie. \"You and your talk about twisted spark-plugs! You'd have been finding worn places in the spark next! You know about as much of a motor boat as a pig knows of the hobble skirt. Good thing the Major knows less about a boat than you do!\"  \"Why didn't he use the wire, instead of going off on that long journey?\" asked Jimmie.  \"The government can't lay cables to all these tiny islands,\" Captain Godwin replied, \"but we are promised a wireless outfit before the season closes. Now, if you are ready,\" he added, turning to Ned, \"we'll go back to the hut and make the examination suggested. I'm afraid there was a tragedy there last night.\"  \"Are any of the people missing from the pueblo?\" asked Ned, as the boat came to the dock and they all stepped ashore.  \"Not a man missing,\" was the reply.  \"Have you talked with the man who was sent to the hut to wait on the Lieutenant and his companions?\"  \"Only briefly,\" was the reply, \"but he will be at the hut when we get there. He is rather above the average native in intelligence, and may be able to throw some light on the mystery.\"  \"Is he dependable?\" asked Ned.  \"I think so. He has been with me for a long time, ever since I came to this out-of-the-way jumping-off place.\"  \"Well,\" Ned said, \"you go back to the hut, if you will be so kind, and take the boys with you. I want to look about a little.\"  Captain Godwin hesitated, but Jack started away.  \"Let Ned alone,\" he said. \"He'll be giving us the shape of the aeroplane the Lieutenant and his men sailed away in before long!\"  \"He wants to consult the dream book,\" added Jimmie.  Frank Shaw, who had been sitting on the bridge deck of the _Manhattan_ during this conversation, now sprang ashore and followed along after Ned.  \"You ginks do a lot of talking!\" he said. \"Run along with the Captain and I'll take care of Ned.\"  Ned and Frank examined the ground around the pier and walked up and down the river bank for some distance. Save here and there where the natives drew up their canoes, and where the women came down with the meager family washing, the bank on the pueblo side was covered with a growth of bushes except where the little pier ran out in front of the house with the tin roof.  Several times Frank saw his companion take out a rule and measure impressions he found in the soft earth under the thickets, and once he saw him put something he had picked up in his pocketbook. Knowing well the methods of his chum, Frank looked on with interest and maintained a discreet silence.  When the two reached the hut at last they found Captain Godwin and Jimmie and Jack sitting on the porch with a government map of the islands before them.  \"That is just what I was thinking of,\" Ned said, taking a seat by their side. \"I have yet to learn in what portion of the Philippines we are stopping.\"  \"Strange the Major did not inform you as to that,\" Captain Godwin said.  \"I have an idea that he knew very little of our future movements when we landed here,\" Ned said. \"His instructions were unopened, remember, besides being a month or more old.\"  \"I see,\" observed the Captain. \"Well, you are on a little island of the Babuyan group, in the Balintang channel, north of the island of Luzon and southeast of the coast of China and Hong Kong. The transport sailed due west from Honolulu and to the north of Luzon. The nearest station of any size is Pata, on Luzon. The Major left without informing you as to his instructions?\"  \"Yes, he was in such haste to get away that he left us here without a word of information as to what we were to do. Rotten, don't you think?\"  \"He was in a hurry to get back to the soft side of military life at Manila,\" laughed the Captain. \"Well, before you investigate the hut it may be well for me to give you some idea as to the situation. What I have to say may give direction to your search of the place.\"  \"Everything is as when the discovery of the absence of the men was made, I hope,\" Ned said.  \"Nothing has been touched,\" was the reply.  \"Then go ahead with your story,\" Ned replied. \"I have come a long way on speculation, and am anxious for something tangible.\"  \"Some months ago,\" the Captain began, \"it was discovered that hostile influences--hostile to the United States Government--were at work among the outer islands of the Philippine group.\"  \"I was told that much.\"  \"Yes; well, investigation--and a crude and indifferent investigation it was--developed the fact that the tribes on some of the islands were forming an alliance against Uncle Sam.\"  \"Now,\" said Ned, \"you have come to the end of my information of the subject. What comes next?\"  \"At first little attention was given to the matter. Some of the native tribes are always in revolt, though the news of the battles and skirmishes are kept off the wires. Finally, however, it was learned that rifles were being received by the tribes belonging to this alliance.\"  \"Then some nation alleged to be civilized must be at the bottom of the matter,\" Ned suggested. \"I am anxious for you to come to that point.\"  \"Well,\" hesitated the Captain, \"I don't know what nation to suspect. It seems that no one does. I think that is the problem you were brought here to solve.\"  \"It seems to me that the wise men at Washington ought to be able to secure information on the subject,\" Ned ventured.  \"I half believe that the state department does know a lot about the matter,\" the Captain replied, \"but does not see fit to act in the absence of conclusive proof.\"  \"But how can a mess of Boy Scouts get the truth?\" demanded Ned.  \"By being Boy Scouts,\" was the smiling reply. \"The launch was brought here for your convenience, and you are to go floating about among the islands north of Luzon, hunting, fishing, gathering specimens, and all that until you find out what sort of people it is that is doing this trading with the natives.\"  \"That was the idea in the Canal Zone,\" laughed Ned, \"but we had little hunting to do! It was quick action down there.\"  \"And I hope it will be here,\" said the Captain. \"Military detectives have been sent down here, but have gone back as ignorant as when they came, for the seasoned secret service man shows what his occupation is and betrays"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20212"],["title","Police Your Planet (#1)"],["body","aid, \"come on down. He's alone, anyhow. What's pushing, stranger?\"  \"A yellow ticket,\" Gordon told him, \"and a government allotment that'll last me two weeks in the dome. I figure on making it last six here, and don't let my being a firster give you hot palms. My brother was Lanny Gordon!\"  It happened to be true, though Bruce Gordon hadn't seen his brother from the time the man had left the family, as a young punk, to the day they finally convicted him on his twenty-first murder. But here, if it was like places he'd known on Earth, even second-hand contact with \"muscle\" was useful.  It seemed to work. A huge man oozed out of the shadows, his gray face contorting its doughy fat into a yellow-toothed grin, and a filthy hand waved back the others. There were a few wisps of long, gray hair on the head and face, and they quivered as he moved forward.  \"Looking for a room?\" he whined.  \"I'm looking for Mother Corey.\"  \"Then you're looking at him, cobber. Sleep on the floor, want a bunk, squat with four, or room and duchess to yourself?\"  There was a period of haggling, followed by a wait as Mother Corey kicked four grumbling men out of a four-by-seven hole on the second floor. Gordon's money had carried more weight than his brother's reputation; for that, Corey humored his guest's wish for privacy. \"All yours, cobber, while your crackle's blue.\"  It was a filthy, dark place. In one corner was an unsheeted bed. There was a rusty bucket for water, a hole kicked through the floor for waste water. Plumbing, and such luxuries, apparently hadn't existed for years--except for the small cistern and worn water-recovery plant in the basement, beside the tired-looking weeds in the hydroponic tanks that tried unsuccessfully to keep the air breathable.  \"What about a lock on the door?\" Gordon asked.  \"What good would it do you? Got a different way here, we have. One credit a week, and you get Mother Corey's word nobody busts in. And it sticks, cobber--one way or the other.\"  Gordon paid, and tossed his pouch on the filthy bed. With a little work, the place could be cleaned enough.  He pulled the cards out of his pouch, trying to be casual. Mother Corey stood staring at the pack while Bruce Gordon changed out of his airsuit, gagging faintly as the full effluvium of the place hit him. \"Where does a man eat around here?\"  Mother Corey pried his eyes off the cards and ran a thick tongue over heavy lips. \"Eh? Oh. Eat. There's a place about ten blocks back. Cobber, stop teasing me! With elections coming up, and the boys loaded with vote money back in town--with a deck of cheaters like that--you want to _eat_?\"  He picked the deck up fondly, while a faraway look came into his clouded eyes. \"Same ones--same identical ones I wore out nigh twenty years ago. Smuggled two decks up here. Set to clean up--and I did, for a while.\" He shook his head sadly, and handed the deck back to Gordon. \"Come on down. For the sight of these, I'll give you the lay for your pitch. And when your luck's made or broken, remember Mother Corey was your friend first, and your old Mother can get longer use from them than you can.\"  He waddled off, telling of his plans to take Mars for a cleaning, once long ago. Gordon followed him, staring at the surrounding filth.  His thoughts were churning so busily that he didn't see the blonde girl until she had forced her way past them on the stairs. Then he turned back, but she had vanished into one of the rooms.     Chapter II  HONEST IZZY   A lot could be done in ten days, when a man knew what he was after. It was exactly ten days later. Bruce Gordon stood in the motley crowd inside the barnlike room where Fats ran a bar along one wall, and filled the rest of the space with assorted tables--all worn. Gordon was sweating slightly as he stood at the roulette table, where both zero and double-zero were reserved for the house.  The croupier was a little wizened man wanted on Earth. His eyes darted down to the point of the knife that showed under Gordon's sleeve, and he licked his lips, showing snaggled teeth. The wheel hesitated and came to a halt, with the ball trembling in a pocket.  \"Twenty-one wins again.\" He pushed chips toward Gordon, as if every one of them came out of his own pay. \"Place your bets.\"  Two others around the table watched narrowly as Gordon left his chips where they were; they then exchanged looks and shook their heads. In a Martian roulette game, numbers with that much riding just didn't turn up. The croupier shifted his weight, then caught the wheel and spun it savagely.  Gordon's leg ached from his strained position, but he shifted his weight onto it more heavily, and sweat popped out on the croupier's face. His eyes darted down, to where the full weight of Gordon seemed to rest on the heel that was grinding into his instep. He tried to pull his foot off the button that was concealed in the floor.  The heel ground harder, bringing a groan from him. And the ball hovered over Twenty-one and came to rest there once more.  Slowly, painfully, the little man counted stacks of chips and moved them across the table toward Gordon, his hands trembling.  Gordon straightened from his awkward position, drawing his foot back, and reached out for the pile of chips. Then he scooped it up and nodded. \"Okay. I'm not greedy.\"  The strain of watching the games until he could spot the fix, and then holding the croupier down, had left him momentarily weak, but Gordon could still feel the tensing of the crowd. Now he let his eyes run over them--the night citizens of Marsport, lower-dome section. Spacemen who'd missed their ships; men who'd come here with dreams, and stayed without them--the shopkeepers who couldn't meet their graft and were here to try to win it on a last chance; street women and petty grifters. The air was thick with their unwashed bodies--all Mars smelled, since water was still too rare for frequent bathing--and their cheap perfume, and clouded with cheap Marsweed cigarettes.  Gordon swung where their eyes pointed, until he saw Fats Eller sidling through the groups, then let the knife slip into the palm of his hand as the crowd seemed to hold its breath. Fats plucked a sheaf of Martian bank notes from his pocket and tossed them to the croupier.  \"Cash in his chips.\" Then his pouchy eyes turned to Gordon. \"Get your money, punk, and get out! And stay out!\"  For a moment, as he began pocketing the bills, Gordon thought he was going to get away that easily. Fats watched him dourly, then swung on his heel, just as a shrill, strangled cry went up from someone in the crowd.  The deportee let his glance jerk to it, then froze. His eyes caught the sight of a hand pointing behind him, and he knew it was too crude a trick to bother with. But he paused, shocked to see the girl he'd seen on Mother Corey's stairs gazing at him in well-feigned warning. In spite of his better judgment, she caught his eyes and drew them down over curves and swells that would always be right for arousing a man's passion.  He glanced back at Fats, who had started to turn again. Gordon took a step backwards, preparing to duck. Again the girl's finger motioned behind him; he disregarded it--and then realized it was a mistake.  It was the faintest swish in the air that caught his ear; he brought his shoulders up and his head down. Fast as his reaction was, it was almost too late. The weapon crunched against his shoulder and slammed over the back of his neck, almost knocking him out.  His heel lashed back and caught the shin of the man behind him. Gordon's other leg spun him around, still crouching; the knife in his hand started coming up, sharp edge leading, and aimed for the belly of the bruiser who confronted him. The pug saw the blade and tried to check his lunge.  Gordon felt the blade strike; but he was already pulling his swing, and it only gashed a long streak. The thug shrieked hoarsely and fell over. That left the way clear to the door; Bruce Gordon was through it and into the night in two soaring leaps. After only a few days on Mars, his legs were still hardened to Earth gravity, and he had more than a double advantage over the others.  Outside, it was the usual Martian night in the poorer section of the dome, which meant near-darkness. Most of the street lights had never been installed--graft had eaten up the appropriations, instead--and the nearest one was around the corner, leaving the side of Fats' Place in the shadow. Gordon checked his speed, threw himself flat, and rolled back against the building, just beyond the steps that led to the street.  Feet pounded out of the door above as Fats and the bouncer broke through. Gordon's hand had already knotted a couple of coins into his kerchief; he waited until the two turned uncertainly up the street and tossed it. It struck the wall near the corner, sailed on, and struck again at the edge of the unpaved street with a muffled sound.  Fats and the other swung, just in time to see a bit of dust where it had hit. \"Around the corner!\" Fats yelled. \"After him, and shoot!\"  In the shadows, Gordon jerked sharply. It was rare enough to have a gun here; but to use one inside the dome was unthinkable. His eyes shot up, to where the few dim lights were reflected off the great plastic sheet that was held up by air pressure and reinforced with heavy webbing. It was the biggest dome ever built--large enough to cover all of Marsport before the slums sprawled out beyond it; it still covered half the city, and made breathing possible here without a helmet. But the dome wasn't designed to stand stray bullets; and having firearms inside it--except for a few chosen men--was a crime punishable by death.  Fats had swung back, and was now herding the crowd inside his place. He might have been only a small gambling-house owner, but within his own circle his words carried weight.  Gordon got to his hands and knees and began crawling away from the corner. He came to a dark alley, smelling of decay where"]]]
