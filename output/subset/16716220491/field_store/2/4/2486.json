Natural under the circumstances? Or neurosis building up already?  \"Our tests showed you to be a schizoid--well-compensated, of course. You know there's no such thing as a _normal_ human being. We all have tendencies toward one or more types of psychoses. In your case the symptoms are an overly active imagination and in some cases an inability to distinguish reality from--well, fancy.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kimball turned to regard the psych coolly. \"What's reality, Steinhart? Do _you_ know?\"  The analyst flushed. \"No.\"  \"I didn't think so.\"  \"You lived pretty much in your mind when you were a child,\" Steinhart went on doggedly. \"You were a solitary, a lonely child.\"  Kimball was watching the sky again.  Steinhart felt futile and out of his depth. \"We know so little about the psychology of space-flight, Kim----\"  Silence. The rumble of the tires on the packed sand of the road, the murmur of the command car's engine, spinning oilily, and lit by tiny sunbright flashes deep in the hollows of the hot metal.  \"You're glad to be leaving, aren't you--\" Steinhart said finally. \"Happy to be the first man to try for the planets----\"  Kimball nodded absently, wishing the man would be quiet. Mars, a dull rusty point of light low on the horizon, seemed to beckon.  They topped the last hillock and dropped down into the lighted bowl of the launching site. The rocket towered, winged and monstrously checkered in white and orange, against the first flickerings of the false dawn.         *       *       *       *       *  _Kimmy saw the girls before they saw him. In their new, low waisted middies and skirts, they looked strange and out of place standing by the pebbled shore of the River Iss.  They were his sisters, Rose and Margaret. Older than he at fifteen and seventeen. But they walked by the river and into danger. Behind him he could hear the rustling sound of the Plant Men as the evening breeze came up.  \"Kimm-eeeee--\"  They were calling him. In the deepening dusk their voices carried far down the river. \"Kimmmmm--eeeeeeeeee--\"  He knew he should answer them, but he did not. Behind him he could hear the awful Plant Men approaching. He shivered with delicious horror.  He stood very still, listening to his sisters talking, letting their voices carry down to where he hid from the dangers of the Valley Dor.  \"Where is that little brat, anyway?\"  \"He always wanders off just at dinnertime and then we have to find him----\"  \"Playing with that old faucet--\" Mimicry. \"'My rad-ium pis-tol----'\"  \"Cracked--just cracked. Oh, where IS he, anyway? Kimmm-eee, you AN-swer!\"  Something died in him. It wasn't a faucet, it WAS a radium pistol. He looked at his sisters with dismay. They weren't really his sisters. They were Therns, with their yellow hair and their pale skins. He and John Carter and Tars Tarkas had fought them many times, piling their bodies for barricades and weaving a flashing pattern of skillful swords in the shifting light of the two moons.  \"Kimmmm--eeee Mom's going to be mad at you! Answer us!\"  If only Tars Tarkas would come now. If only the great Green Jeddak would come splashing across the stream on his huge thoat, his two swords clashing----  \"He's up there in that clump of willows--hiding!\"  \"Kimmy! You come down here this instant!\"  The Valley Dor was blurring, fading. The Golden Cliffs were turning into sandy, river-worn banks. The faucet felt heavy in his grimy hand. He shivered, not with horror now. With cold.  He walked slowly out of the willows, stumbling a little over the rocks._         *       *       *       *       *  He lay like an embryo in the viscera of the ship, protected and quite alone. The plastic sac contained him, fed him; and the rocket, silent now, coursed through the airless deep like a questing thought. Time was measured by the ticking of the telemeters and the timers, but Kimball slept insulated and complete.  And he dreamed.  He dreamed of that summer when the river lay still and deep under the hanging willows. He dreamed of his sisters, thin and angular creatures as he remembered them through the eyes of a nine-year-old----  And his mother, tall and shadowy, standing on the porch of the rented cottage and saying exasperatedly: \"_Why do you run off by yourself, Kimmy? I worry about you so----_\"  And his sisters: \"_Playing with his wooden swords and his radium pistol and never wanting to take his nose out of those awful books----_\"  He dreamed of the low, beamed ceiling of the cottage, sweltering in the heat of the summer nights and the thick longing in his throat for red hills and a sky that burned deep blue through the long, long days and canals, clear and still. A land that he knew somehow never was, but which lived, for him, through some alchemy of the mind. He dreamed of Mars.  And Steinhart: \"_What is reality, Kimmy?_\"         *       *       *       *       *  The hours stretched into days, the days into months. Time wasn't. Time was a deep night and a starshot void. And dreams.  He awoke seldom. His tasks were simple. The plastic sac and the tender care of the ship were more real than the routine jobs of telemetering information back to the Base across the empty miles, across the rim of the world.  He dreamed of his wife. \"_You don't live here, Kim._\"  She was right, of course. He wasn't of earth. Never had been. My love is in the sky, he thought, filled with an immense satisfaction.  And time slipped by, the weeks into months; the sun dwindled and earth was gone. All around him lay the stunning star-dusted night.  He lay curled in the plastic womb when the ship turned. He awoke sluggishly and dragged himself into awareness.  \"I've changed,\" he thought aloud. \"My face is younger; I feel different.\"  The keening sound of air over the wings brought a thrill. Below him, a great curving disk of reds and browns and yellows. He could see dust storms raging and the heavy, darkened lines of the canals.  There was skill in his hands. He righted the rocket, balanced it. Began the tricky task of landing. It took all of his talent, all of his training. Ponderously, the ship settled into the iron sand; slowly, the internal fires died.         *       *       *       *       *  Kimball stood in the control room, his heart pounding. Slowly, the ports opened. Through the thick quartz he could see the endless plain. Reddish brown, empty. The basin of some long ago sea. The sky was a deep, burning blue with stars shining at midday at the zenith. It looked unreal, a painting of unworldly quiet and desolation.  _What is reality, Kimmy?_  Steinhart was right, he thought vaguely. A tear streaked his cheek. He had never been so alone.  And then he imagined he saw something moving on the great plain. He scrambled down through the ship, past the empty fuel tanks and the lashed supplies. His hands were clawing desperately at the dogs of the outer valve. Suddenly the pressure jerked the hatch from his hands and he gasped at the icy air, his lungs laboring to breathe.  He dropped to one knee and sucked at the thin, frigid air. His vision was cloudy and his head felt light. But there _was_ something moving on the plain.  A shadowy cavalcade.         *       *       *       *       *  Strange monstrous men on fantastic war-mounts, long spears and fluttering pennons. Huge golden chariots with scythes flashing on the circling hubs and armored giants, the figments of a long remembered dream----  He dropped to the sand and dug his hands into the dry powdery soil. He could scarcely see now, for blackness was flickering at the edges of his vision and his failing heart and lungs were near collapse.  _Kimmm-eee!_  A huge green warrior on a gray monster of a thoat was beckoning to him. Pointing toward the low hills on the oddly near horizon.  _Kimmmm-eeeee!_  The voice was thin and distant on the icy wind. Kimball knew that voice. He knew it from long ago in the Valley Dor, from the shores of the Lost Sea of Korus where the tideless waters lay black and deep----  He began stumbling across the empty, lifeless plain. He knew the voice, he knew the man, and he knew the hills that he must reach, quickly now, or die.  They were the hills of home.    +--------------------------------------------------------------+   | Transcriber's Note and Errata                                |   |                                                              |   | This etext was produced from \"Future Science Fiction\" No. 30 |   | 1956.

Finally, in some indefinable way, character will become more important to him than physical health even. Illness is half compensated when a man realizes that it is not what he accomplishes in the world, but what he _is_ that really counts, which puts him in touch with the creative forces of God and raises him out of the aimless and ordinary into a life of inspiration and joy.     II  RELIGIO MEDICI       At all events, it is certain that if any medical man had come to     Middlemarch with the reputation of having definite religious     views, of being given to prayer and of otherwise showing an     active piety, there would have been a general presumption     against his medical skill.                 GEORGE ELIOT.  When a medically educated man talks and writes of religion and of God, he is rightly enough questioned by his brothers--who are too busy with the hard work of practice to be concerned with anything but material problems. To me the word \"God\" is symbolic of the power which created and which maintains the universe. The sunrise and the stars of heaven give me some idea of his majesty, the warmth and tenderness of human love give me some idea of his divine love. That is all I know, but it is enough to make life glow; it is enough to inspire the most intense devotion to any good cause; it is enough to make me bear suffering with some degree of patience; and it is enough, finally, to give me some confidence and courage even in the face of the great mystery of death. Why this or another conception of God should produce such a profound result upon any one, I do not know, except that in some obscure way it connects the individual with the divine plan, and does not leave him outside in despair and loneliness. However that may be, it will be conceded that a religious conception of some kind does much toward justifying life, toward making it strong and livable, and so has directly to do with certain important problems of illness and health. The most practical medical man will admit that any illness is made lighter and more likely to recover in the presence of hope and serenity in the mind of the patient.  Naturally the great bulk of medical practice calls for no handling other than that of the straight medical sort. A man comes in with a crushed finger, a girl with anæmia--the way is clear. It is only in deeper, more intricate departments of medicine that we altogether fail. The bacteriologist and the pathologist have no use for mental treatment, in their departments. But when we come to the case of the nervously broken-down school teacher, or the worn-out telegrapher, that is another matter. Years may elapse before work can be resumed--years of dependence and anxiety. Here, a new view of life is often more useful than drugs, a view that accepts the situation reasonably after a while, that does not grope blindly and impatiently for a cure, but finds in life an inspiration that makes it good in spite of necessary suffering and limitations. Often enough we cannot promise a cure, but we must be prepared to give something better.  A great deal of the fatigue and unhappiness of the world is due to the fact that we do not go deep enough in our justification for work or play, or for any experience, happy or sad. There is a good deal of a void after we have said, \"Art for art's sake,\" or \"Play for the joy of playing,\" or even after we have said, \"I am working for the sake of my family, or for some one who needs my help.\" That is not enough; and whether we realize it or not, the lack of deeper justification is at the bottom of a restlessness and uncertainty which we might not be willing to acknowledge, but which nevertheless is very real.  I am not satisfied when some moralist says, \"Be good and you will be happy.\" The kind of happiness that comes from a perfunctory goodness is a thing which I cannot understand, and which I certainly do not want. If I work and play and serve and employ, making up the fabric of a busy life, if I attain a very real happiness, I am tormented by the desire to know why I am doing it, and I am not satisfied with the answer I usually get. The patient may not be cured when he is relieved of his anæmia, or when his emaciation has given place to the plumpness and suppleness and physical strength that we call health. The man whom we look upon as well, and who has never known physical illness, is not well in the larger sense until he knows why he is working, why he is living, why he is filling his life with activity. In spite of the elasticity and spring of the world's interests, there must come often, and with a kind of fatal insistence, the deep demand for a cause, for a justification. If there is not an adequate significance behind it, life, with all its courage and accomplishment, seems but a sorry thing, so full of pathos, even in its brightest moments, so shadowed with a sense of loss and of finality that the bravest heart may well fail and the truest courage relax, supported only by the assurance that this way lies happiness or that right is right.  What is this knowledge that the world is seeking, but can never find? What is this final justification? If we seek it in its completeness, we are doomed always to be ill and unsatisfied. If we are willing to look only a little way into the great question, if we are willing to accept a little for the whole, content because it is manifestly part of the final knowledge, and because we know that final knowledge rests with God alone, we shall understand enough to save us from much sorrow and painful incompleteness.  There is, in the infinitely varied and beautiful world of nature, and in the hearts of men, so much of beauty and truth that it is a wonder we do not all realize that these things of common life may be in us and for us the daily and hourly expression of the infinite being we call God. We do not see God, but we do feel and know so much that we may fairly believe to be of God that we do not need to see Him face to face. It is something more than imagination to feel that it is the life of God in our lives, so often unrecognized or ignored, that prompts us to all the greatness and the inspiration and the accomplishment of the world. If we could know more clearly the joy of such a conception, we should dry up at its source much of the unhappiness which is, in a deep and subtle way, at the bottom of many a nervous illness and many a wretched existence.  The happiness which is found in the recognition of kinship with God, through the common things of life, in the experiences which are so significant that they could not spring from a lesser source, the happiness which is not sought, but which is the inevitable result of such recognition--this experience goes a long way toward making life worth living.  If we do have this conception of life, then some of the old, old questions that have vexed so many dwellers upon the earth will no longer be a source of unhappiness or of illness of mind or body. The question of immortality, for instance, which has made us afraid to die, will no longer be a question--we shall not need to answer it, in the presence of God, in our lives and in the world about us. We shall be content finally to accept whatever is in store for us--so it be the will of God. We may even look for something better than mere immortality, something more divine than our gross conception of eternal life.  This is a religion that I believe medical men may teach without hesitation whenever the need shall arise. I know well enough that many a blunt if kindly man cannot bring himself to say these words, even if he believes them, but I do think that in some measure they point the way to what may wisely be taught.  There is a practice of medicine--the common practice--that is concerned with the body only, and with its chemical and mechanical reactions. We can have nothing but respect and admiration for the men who go on year after year in the eager pursuit of this calling. We know that such a work is necessary, that it is just as important as the educational practice of which I write. We know that without the physical side medicine would fail of its usefulness and that disease and death would reap far richer harvests: I only wish the two naturally related aspects of our dealing with patients might not be so completely separated that they lose sight of each other. As a matter of fact, both elements are necessary to our human welfare. If medicine devotes itself altogether to the cure and prevention of physical disease, it will miss half of its possibilities. It is equally true that if we forget the physical necessities in our zeal for spiritual hygiene, we shall get and deserve complete and humiliating failure. Many men will say, \"Why mix the two? Why not let the preachers and the philosophers preach and the doctors follow their own ways?\" For the most part this may have to be the arrangement, but the doctor who can see and treat the spiritual needs of his patient will always be more likely to cure in the best sense than the doctor who sees only half of the picture. On the other hand, the philosopher is likely to be a comparatively poor doctor, because he knows nothing of medicine, and so can see only the other half of the picture. There is much to be said for the religion of medicine if it can be kept free from cant, if it can be simple and rational enough to be available for the whole world.     III  THOUGHT AND WORK       I wish I had a trade!--It would animate my arms and tranquilize     my brain.                 SENANCOUR.      \"Doe ye nexte thynge.\"--_Old English Proverb_.  Since our minds are so constantly filled with anxiety, there would seem to be at least one sure way to be rid of it--to stop thinking.  A great many people believe that the mind will become less effective, that life will become dull and purposeless, unless they are constantly thinking and planning"]]]
