He, for his part, was engaged in the profitless task of disposing of large margins of goods at fifty per cent below cost of production whilst the leisurely, crafty Greeks kept him waiting from day to day in the expectation of getting another ten per cent reduction.  \"The whole world's out of gear,\" said the American in disgust.  \"The war and the Russian revolution are the cause.  They have ruined the meaning of money.\"  I was to find his words true to this extent that at every capital the European problem proved to be inextricably involved in the Russian problem also.     EXTRA LEAVES  (i) _On Passports and \"Circulation\"_  Mr. H. G. Wells, in \"The Salvaging of Civilization,\" has very pleasantly contrasted the States of America with the States of Europe--the Disunited States.  America, where you can travel by through trains without showing passports, without customs-barriers, without change of currency and without police-inquisition; America where there is a free interchange of peoples and opinions, Europe lying in unexampled obstruction and stagnation; America with its cheap post and universally-used telephone service, Europe with its expensive, ill-managed posts and local and limited and expensive and contumacious telephone.  At the time of writing you can send a letter from San Francisco to London for less than it costs to send a similar letter from one London suburb to another.  In America you have inter-state telephone service, you have the constant extension of an elaborate and efficient system, whilst on our side of the water we intelligent Europeans are asking to have the apparatus removed as a hindrance and a failure.  Passports, railway-service, post, telephone, currency--all these may fittingly be considered as aspects of one vital matter, namely, circulation.  All living organic unity is dependent on circulation.  As the health of the human body is dependent on an unobstructed circulation of the blood, of the lymph, of the air, so the health of a nation or a state or a group of states is dependent on the free circulation of peoples, goods, opinions, money, and what not.  A bad circulation results in \"pins and needles,\" and we Europeans have so inverted common sense as to indulge habitually in a policy of pin-pricks.  A bad circulation results in cold feet, in local stagnation, in lethargy.  No circulation results in death.  It means    to die, and go we know not where,   To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot.   It may almost be said that Shakespeare's formula for death describes Europe--she goes she knows not where, she lies in cold obstruction and she rots.  In reality it is not quite so bad as that.  Though there is local paralysis of an alarming kind, there is also a sluggish circulation. How impeded that circulation is let the traveller judge.  In January, 1921, I took a general passport for Europe.  The British passport office facilitated my struggles.  For I am a well-known struggler there and am now excused the preliminary heats.  I spent a week getting visas in London.  I remembered his Excellency of Greece had changed his address.  When the taxi-driver had located his new office in Great Tower Street we found that he was having a holiday, celebrating New Year's Day in orthodox Greek style about the fourteenth of the month.  I returned in a few days' time and his Excellency was celebrating Epiphany.  Next time I resolved to take a precautionary twenty minutes at the telephone and find out whether there were any other festivals on.  The Poles, I remember, asked for answers to questions on two sheets of foolscap and charged thirty shillings for a visa that went out of date before I could get to their country.  His Excellency of Bulgaria I made several trips to Kensington to find, and I gave him up as apparently non-existent.  With the representatives of Latvia I had a troublous conversation and finally obtained another useless visa for forty shillings.  The Germans would not give a visa as I was entering Germany from the other side of Europe.  I spent about ten pounds in London merely for the application of rubber stamps and Consuls' signatures.  In the course of my travels that passport became an appalling wilderness of visas and remarks climbing out of their legitimate spaces to get mixed up with wife's signature and the colour of the hair.  The most flattering of these remarks is no doubt that affixed at Sofia station--\"Not dangerous to society.\"  But I had to show that passport not only to the police and the military of all nations, but also before entering the gambling halls of Monte Carlo on the one hand and before entering the gates of the Cathedral of Sancta Sophia at Constantinople on the other.  One of the worst places is Vintimiglia on the Franco-Italian line.  The French frank you out of their country; the Italians frank you in.  You step into a separate chamber and are searched and asked particular and impertinent questions.  Before leaving Italy the Italian police demand your personal attendance and take a small due.  In some countries you are required to obtain police permission to leave the country; in some not.  No one tells you what you have to do.  You can take a ticket and proceed gaily to the frontier and then be turned back.  This can happen even in the enlightened State of Czechoslovakia.  Greece, however, is one of the worst international offenders in this matter.  The traveller has to spend a morning with the police, and he may be held up for some days if Church Festivals intervene.  If he goes to the frontier without the police stamp on his passport he gets sent back.  Two examples of how this lack of international manners works out I append: A German officer captured by the Russians in 1915, was sent to Siberia, escaped and got somehow down to Tashkent, the ex-capital of Russian Central Asia, struggled out of Asia and through Asia Minor in an utterly indigent condition, and this year stowed away on a Greek ship and got to Athens.  So great was the interest in his case that a subscription was made for him publicly, and he was given a first-class ticket to Berlin, and a place in the sleeping car was reserved.  Incredible as it may seem, he was turned off the express at midnight at Ghevgeli and returned to Salonica by slow train because his passport had not the Greek police visa.  Of course he lost his sleeping-car accommodation and resumed his journey homewards by ordinary trains.  Another case was that of a young Roumanian returning from the Far East after endless vicissitudes in the Koltchak and Bolshevik adventures.  He also was turned off and had to go to Salonica to visit the police.  However, the British authorities could not throw stones at the Greeks. It would be unwise.  Constantinople under British domination is one of the worst places of obstruction in Europe.  You need a military pass to get in; you need a good deal more than that to get out.  The Australian Colonel in charge of the work going on at the Dardanelles gave me a letter to G.H.Q. Constantinople, asking D.M.I. (we still talk of D.M.I.'s) to put my passport through quickly.  Here I was met by one of those drawling incapables who make England loathed on the Continent. \"I--don't--really--see,\" says he, and pauses, and looks at my weather-beaten cap and tramping boots--\"I don't really see----\" Inability is a guiding sign of the administration.  I went to the Allied Passport Bureau, British Section, where a tippable man was keeping a queue of all the rabble of the East, and I was to come tomorrow morning.  When the British section had given the visa I went to the French, then to the Italians.  One loses one's patience, being kept waiting so long, and one breaks into a room sometimes before one is asked.  It was so with the Italians.  I stepped suddenly into the room of the man who had to initial my pass, and he was tenderly embracing a charming brunette.  He signed tacitly and rapidly and I was gone. . . .  After the Italians you seek out the Greeks who are in an entirely different district.  Outside the Consulate is a string of photographers with cameras and ricketty chairs.  The Greeks require photographs--you sit down on a chair on the open roadway, and in a quarter of an hour you have a sheaf of wet pictures of yourself by which it certainly would be hard to recognize you.  Inside the Greek Consulate rages a terrific hurly-burly.  You wait and perspire in a vapour of garlic. . . .  Then for the Bulgars.  The Bulgars have certainly hit on a novelty.  The rubber stamp is applied to your passport in one office and the date is written but the visa has to be signed in another office a mile away.  Are we then through with everything?  No.  The Orient Express requires a doctor's certificate that you are free from vermin and infection.  For this the doctors naturally charge a heavy fee.  For my part I refused to see a doctor and carried the matter off with a high hand at the railway station, where they put me down as \"officer in mufti.\"  Apparently officers are exempted from all this.  It is only if you happen to be one of the ordinary dirty and despised free citizens of Europe and not a member of any Commission or Red Cross or Y.M.C.A., or military unit--that you go through all this.  Europe for the man in uniform!  So useful is the military uniform that some civilians carry their ex-khaki attire in an extra suit-case and put it on when they want to get along.  I met an Englishman, ex-officer, in this get-up in the Serbian Constituent Assembly.  He could beard whom he liked in Jugo-Slavia clad in an old uniform with ribbons.  I heard of another in Austria who was arrested at the chief station in Vienna, having four millions of Austrian crowns on his person.  Austrian crowns are worth much more in London than in Vienna, and it is illegal to take large quantities out of the country.  But an observant speculator had concluded that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215"],["title","The Call of the Wild (#1)"],["body","es; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate nor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. When he flung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed at him and taunted him. They growled and barked like detestable dogs, mewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. It was all very silly, he knew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger waxed and waxed. He did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch. For that matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment had flung him into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue.  He was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. That had given them an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them. They would never get another rope around his neck. Upon that he was resolved. For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during those two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him. His eyes turned blood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. So changed was he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him; and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at Seattle.  Four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small, high-walled back yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver. That was the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled himself savagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.  “You ain’t going to take him out now?” the driver asked.  “Sure,” the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.  There was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance.  Buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging and wrestling with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was there on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.  “Now, you red-eyed devil,” he said, when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of Buck’s body. At the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.  And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for the spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his blood-shot eyes. Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights. In mid air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip. He whirled over, fetching the ground on his back and side. He had never been struck by a club in his life, and did not understand. With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air. And again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground. This time he was aware that it was the club, but his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he charged, and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.  After a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to rush. He staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver. Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head and chest.  For the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down, knocked utterly senseless.  “He’s no slouch at dog-breakin’, that’s wot I say,” one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically.  “Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,” was the reply of the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.  Buck’s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.  “‘Answers to the name of Buck,’” the man soliloquized, quoting from the saloon-keeper’s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents. “Well, Buck, my boy,” he went on in a genial voice, “we’ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that. You’ve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog and all ’ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I’ll whale the stuffin’ outa you. Understand?”  As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded, and though Buck’s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he drank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk, from the man’s hand.  He was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was a revelation. It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law, and he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by, other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and again, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty, though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails, and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.  Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly, and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was glad each time when he was not selected.  Yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not understand.  “Sacredam!” he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck. “Dat one dam bully dog! Eh? How moch?”  “Three hundred, and a present at that,” was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater. “And seem’ it’s government money, you ain’t got no kick coming, eh, Perrault?”  Perrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal. The Canadian Government would be no loser, nor would its despatches travel the slower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at Buck he knew that he was one in a thousand—“One in ten t’ousand,” he commented mentally.  Buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when Curly, a good-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened man. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the _Narwhal_, it was the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he were taken below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called François. Perrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but François was a French-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They were a new kind of men to Buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and while he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew honestly to respect them. He speedily learned that Perrault and François were fair men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.  In the ’tween-decks of the _Narwhal_, Buck and Curly joined two other dogs. One of them was a big, snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied a Geological Survey into the Barrens. He was friendly, in a treacherous sort of way, smiling into one’s face the while he meditated some underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from Buck’s food at the first meal. As Buck sprang to punish him, the lash of François’s whip sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained to Buck but to recover the bone. That was fair of François, he decided, and the half-breed began his rise in Buck’s estimation.  The other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not attempt to steal from the newcomers. He was a gloomy, morose fellow, and he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone, and further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone. “Dave” he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times, and took interest in nothing, not even when the _Narwhal_ crossed Queen Charlotte Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed. When Buck and Curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he raised his head as though annoyed, favored them with an incurious glance, yawned, and"]]]
