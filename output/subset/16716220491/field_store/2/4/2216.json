Some people don't seem to think there's anything wrong in a boy's lying about his age to get into the army. But I do, and I think you do---- Don't you?\" he added anxiously.  \"Y-e-es.\"  \"Of course, you couldn't enlist without Mr. Temple's consent, he being your guardian, unless you lied--and I know you wouldn't do that.\"  \"You didn't catch me in many, did you?\"  \"I never caught you in _any_, Tom.\"  \"Well, then----\"  \"Well, then,\" concluded Mr. Ellsworth, \"I guess we'd all better go home and get some sleep. We've got one strenuous day to-morrow.\"  \"It's going to be a peach,\" said Roy, looking up at the stars. As they started to move away, Mr. Ellsworth instinctively extended his hand to Tom again.  \"I have your promise, then?\" said he.  \"Y-e-s.\"  \"I'm not stuck on that 'yes.'\"  \"Yes,\" said Tom, more briskly.  \"That you won't do anything along that line till you consult me?\"  \"Don't do anything till you count ten,\" said Roy.  \"Make it ten thousand,\" said Mr. Ellsworth.  \"And after you've counted ten,\" put in Pee-wee, \"if you decide to go, I'll go with you, by crinkums!\"  \"Go-o-d-night!\" laughed Roy. \"That ought to be enough to keep you at home, Tomasso!\"  Tom smiled, half grudgingly, as he turned and started toward home.  \"You don't think he'd really enlist, do you?\" queried Roy, as he and Pee-wee and Mr. Ellsworth sauntered up the street.  \"He won't now,\" said the scoutmaster. \"I have his promise.\"  \"Otherwise, do you think he would?\"  \"I think it extremely likely.\"  \"And lie about his age?\"  Mr. Ellsworth screwed his face into a funny, puzzled look. \"There's a good deal of that kind of thing going on,\" he said, \"and I sometimes think the recruiting people wink at it, or perhaps they are just a little too ready to judge by physical appearance. Look how Billy Wade got through.\"  \"He doesn't look eighteen,\" said Roy.  \"Of course he doesn't. But he told them he was 'going on nineteen,' and so he was--just the same as Pee-wee is going on fifty.\"  Roy laughed.  \"The honor of enlisting, the willingness to sacrifice one's life, seems to cover a multitude of sins in the eyes of some people,\" said the scoutmaster. \"Heroic duty done for one's country will wipe out a lot of faults.--It's hard to get a line on Tom's thoughts. He asked me the other day what I thought about the saying, _To do a great right, do a little wrong._ I don't know where he rooted it out, but it gave me a shudder when he asked me.\"  \"He was standing in front of the recruiting station down at the postoffice yesterday,\" said Roy, \"staring at the posters. Goodness only knows what he was thinking about. He came along with me when he saw me.\"  \"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ellsworth thoughtfully.  \"But I guess he wouldn't try anything like that here--the town is too small,\" said Roy. \"Even the recruiting fellow knows him.\"  \"Yes; but what worries me,\" said Mr. Ellsworth, \"is when he goes to the city and stands around listening to the orators and watches the young fellows surging into the recruiting places. That phrase, _Your country needs you_, is dinging in his ears.\"  \"He'd get through in a walk,\" said Roy.  \"That's just the trouble,\" Mr. Ellsworth mused. \"Tom would never do anything that he thought wrong,\" he added, after a pause; \"but he has a way of doping things out for himself, and sometimes he asks queer questions.\"  \"Well, he promised you, anyway,\" said Roy finally.  \"Oh, yes, that settles it,\" Mr. Ellsworth said. \"All's well that ends well.\"  \"We should worry,\" said Roy, in his usual light-hearted manner.  \"That's just what I _shan't_ do,\" the scoutmaster answered.  \"All right, so long, see you later,\" Roy called, as he started up Blakeley's hill.  Mr. Ellsworth and Pee-wee waved him goodnight. Presently Pee-wee deserted and went down, scout pace, through Main Street, laboriously hoisting his belt axe up with every other step. It was very heavy and a great nuisance to his favorite gait, but he had worn it regularly to scout meeting ever since war had been declared.     CHAPTER II  \"BULL HEAD\" AND \"BUTTER FINGERS\"   The lateness of the hour did not incline Tom to hurry on his journey homeward. He was thoroughly discouraged and dissatisfied with himself, and it pleased his mood to amble along kicking a stone in front of him until he lost it in the darkness. Without this vent to his distemper he became still more sullen. It would have been better if he had hunted up the stone and gone on kicking it. But now he was angry at the stone too. He was angry at everybody and everything.  Ever since war had been declared Tom had worked with the troop, doing his bit under Mr. Ellsworth's supervision, and everything he had done he had done wrong--in his own estimation.  The Red Cross bandages which he had rolled had had to be rolled over again. The seeds which he had planted had not come up, because he had buried them instead of planting them. Roy's onion plants were peeping coyly forth in the troop's patriotic garden; Doc Carson's lettuce was showing the proper spirit; a little regiment of humble radishes was mobilizing under the loving care of Connie Bennett, and Pee-wee's tomatoes were bold with flaunting blossoms. A bashful cucumber which basked unobtrusively in the wetness of the ice-box outlet under the shed at Artie Van Arlen's home was growing apace. But not a sign was there of Tom's beans or peas or beets--nothing in his little allotted patch but a lonely plantain which he had carefully nursed until Pee-wee had told him the bitter truth--that this child of his heart was nothing but a vulgar weed.  It is true that Roy Blakeley had tried to comfort Tom by telling him that if his seeds did not come up in Bridgeboro they might come up in China, for they were as near to one place as the other! Tom had not been comforted.  His most notable failure, however, had come this very week when three hundred formidable hickory sticks had been received by the Home Defense League and turned over to the Scouts to have holes bored through them for the leather thongs.  There had been a special scout meeting for this work; every scout had come equipped with a gimlet, and there was such a boring seance as had never been known before. Roy had said it was a great bore. As fast as the holes were bored, Pee-wee had tied the strips of leather through them, and the whole job had been finished in the one evening.  Tom had broken his gimlet and three extra ones which fortunately some one had brought. The hickory had proven as stubborn as he was himself--which is saying a great deal.  He had tried boring from each side so that the holes would meet in the middle; but the holes never met. When he had bored all the way through from one side, he had either broken the gimlet or the hole had come slantingways and the gimlet had come out, like a woodchuck in his burrow, where it had least been expected to appear.  And now, to cap the climax, he was to stand outside one of the registration places the next day and pin little flags on the young men as they came out after registering. The other members of the troop were to be distributed all through the county for this purpose (wherever there was no local scout troop), and each scout, or group of scouts, would sally heroically forth in the morning armed with a shoebox full of these honorable mementoes, made by the girls of Bridgeboro.  And meanwhile, thought Tom, the Germans were sinking our ships and dropping bombs on hospitals and hitting below the belt, generally. He was not at all satisfied with himself, or with his trifling, ineffective part in the great war. He felt that he had made a bungle of everything so far, and his mind turned contemptuously from these inglorious duties in which he had been engaged to the more heroic r√¥le of the real soldier.  Perhaps his long trousers had had something to do with his dissatisfaction; in any event, they made his bungling seem the more ridiculous. His fellow scouts had called him \"bull head\" and \"butter fingers,\" but only in good humor and because they loved to jolly him; for in plain fact they all knew and admitted that Tom Slade, former hoodlum, was the best all-round scout that ever raised his hand and promised to do his duty to God and Country and to obey the Scout Law.  The fact was that Tom was clumsy and rough--perhaps a little uncouth--and he could do big things but not little things.  As he ambled along the dark street, nursing his disgruntled mood, he came to Rockwood Place and turned into it, though it did not afford him the shortest way home. But in his sullen mood one street was as good as another, and Rockwood Place had that fascination for him which wealth and luxury always had for poor Tom.  Three years before, when Tom Slade, hoodlum, had been deserted by his wretched, drunken father and left a waif in Bridgeboro, Mr. Ellsworth had taken him in hand, Roy had become his friend, and John Temple, president of the Bridgeboro Bank, noticing his amazing reformation, had become interested in him and in the Boy Scouts as well.  It had proven a fine thing for Tom and for the Scouts. Mr. Temple had endowed a large scout camp in the Catskills, which had become a vacation spot for troops from far and near, and which, during the two past summers, had been the scene of many lively adventures for the Bridgeboro boys.  But Tom had to thank Temple Camp and its benevolent founder for something more than health and recreation and good times. When the troop had returned from that delightful woodland community in the preceding autumn and Tom had reached the dignity of long trousers, the question of what he should do weighed somewhat heavily on Mr. Ellsworth's mind, for Tom was through school and it was necessary that he be established in some sort of home and in some form of work which would enable him to pay his way."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20986"],["title","Tom Slade with the Colors (#2)"],["body","Tom's own realization of this had its part in inclining him to go off to war. In any event, Mr. Ellsworth's perplexities, and to some extent his anxieties, had come to an end when Mr. Temple had announced that Temple Camp was to have a city office and a paid manager for the conduct of its affairs, which had theretofore been looked after by himself and the several trustees and, to some extent, by Jeb Rushmore, former scout and plainsman, who made his home at the camp and was called its manager.  Whether Jeb had fulfilled all the routine requirements may be a question, but he was the spirit of the camp, the idol of every boy who visited it, and it was altogether fitting that he should be relieved of the prosy duties of record-keeping which were now to be relegated to the little office in Mr. Temple's big bank building in Bridgeboro.  So it was arranged that Tom should work as a sort of assistant to Mr. Burton in the Temple Camp office and, like Jeb Rushmore, if he fell short in some ways (he couldn't _touch_ a piece of carbon paper without getting his fingers smeared) he more than made up in others, for he knew the camp thoroughly, he could describe the accommodations of every cabin, and tell you every by-path for miles around, and his knowledge of the place showed in every letter that went out over Mr. Burton's name.  From the window, high up on the ninth floor, Tom could look down behind the big granite bank building upon a narrow, muddy place with barrel staves for a sidewalk and tenements with conspicuous fire escapes, and washes hanging on the disorderly roofs. This was Barrel Alley, where Tom had lived and where his poor, weary mother had died. He could pick out the very tenement. Strangely enough, this spot of squalor and unhappy memories held a certain place in his affection even now.  Tom and Mr. Burton and Miss Ellison, the stenographer, were the only occupants of the little office, but Mr. Temple usually came upstairs from the bank each day to confer with Mr. Burton for half an hour or so.  There was also another visitor who was in the habit of coming upstairs from the bank and spending many half hours lolling about and chatting. This was Roscoe Bent, a young fellow who was assistant something-or-other in the bank and whose fashionable attire and worldly wisdom caused Tom to stand in great awe of him.  Roscoe made no secret of the fact that he came up in order to smoke cigarettes, which practice was forbidden down in the bank. He would come up, smoke a cigarette, chat a while, and then go down again. He seemed to know by inspiration when Mr. Burton and Mr. Temple were going to be there. Up to the morning of this very day he had never shown very much interest in either Tom or Temple Camp, though he appeared to entertain a lively interest in Miss Ellison, and Tom envied him his easy manner and his faculty for entertaining her and making her laugh.  On the morning of this day, however, when he had come up for his clandestine smoke, he had manifested much curiosity about the camp, looking over the maps and pictures and asking many questions.  Tom had felt highly flattered.     CHAPTER III  ROSCOE BENT   Indeed, Tom had felt so highly flattered that the memory of young Mr. Roscoe Bent's condescension had lingered with him all day, and now he was going to give himself the pleasure of walking through Rockwood Place for a passing glimpse of the beautiful house wherein young Roscoe resided.  Tom knew well enough that Roscoe had to thank the friendship between his father and Mr. Temple for his position in the bank. In his heart he knew that there was not much to be said for Roscoe; that _he_ could do many things which Roscoe couldn't begin to do; but Roscoe on the other hand could do all those little things which poor Tom never could master; he could joke and make people laugh, and he always knew what to say and how to say it--especially to girls.  Tom's long trousers had not brought him this accomplishment, and in his clumsiness of speech and manner he envied this sprightly youth who had become so much of a celebrity in his thoughts that he actually took a certain pleasure in walking past the Bent residence just because it was where Roscoe and his well-to-do parents lived.  He was a little ashamed of doing this, just as he was ashamed of his admiration for Roscoe, and he knew that neither Roscoe, with his fine airs, nor Roscoe's home would have had any attractions for Roy at all. But then Roy's father was rich, whereas Tom's father had been poor, and he had come out of the slums and in some ways he would never change.  \"He isn't so bad, anyway,\" Tom muttered to himself, as he kicked another stone along. \"I knew he'd be really interested some day. Any feller's _got_ to be interested in a camp like that. If he only _went_ there once, he'd see what it was like and he'd fall for it, all right. I bet in the summer he goes to places where they dance and bow, and all that, but he'd fall for Temple Camp if he ever went there--he would.\"  Tom was greatly elated at Roscoe's sudden interest, and he believed that great things would come of it.  \"If he could only once see that shack up on the mountain,\" he said to himself, \"and make that climb, I bet he'd knock off his cigarettes. If he thought those pictures were good--gee, what would he think of the shack itself!\"  When he reached the Bent house he was surprised to see an automobile standing directly in front of it which he had not noticed as he approached because its lights were out. Not even the little red light which should have illuminated the car's number was visible, nor was there a single light either in the entrance hall or in any of the windows of the big house.  In the car sat a dark figure in the chauffeur's place, and Tom, as he passed, fancied that this person turned away from him. He was rather surprised, and perhaps a little curious, for he knew that the Bents did not keep a car, and he thought that if the presence of the machine meant visitors, or a doctor, there would be some light in the house.  Reaching the corner, he looked back just in time to see another figure, carrying luggage, descend the steps and enter the car. He was still close enough to know that not a word was spoken nor a sound made; there was not even the familiar and usual bang of the automobile door. But a certain characteristic swing of the person with the luggage, as he passed one bag and then the other into the car, showed Tom that the figure was that of young Roscoe Bent. Then the car rolled away, leaving him gaping and speculating in the concealment of a doorway near the corner.  \"I wonder where he can be going this time of night,\" Tom mused. \"Gee, that was funny! If he was going on a vacation or anything like that, he'd have said so this morning--and he'd have said good-bye to me. Anyway, he'd have said good-bye to Miss Ellison....\"  Tom boarded with a private family in Culver Street, and after he reached home he sat up in his room for a while working with a kind of sullen resignation on the few registration badges which had still to have pins attached to them.  It was while he was engaged in this heroic labor that a thought entered his mind which he put away from him, but which kept recurring again and again, and which ended by cheating him out of his night's sleep. Why should Roscoe Bent be leaving home with two suitcases at twelve o'clock at night when he would have to register for the selective draft the next day?  After this rather puzzling question had entered his mind and refused to be ousted or explained away, other puzzling questions began to follow it. Why had the lights of the automobile been out? Why had there been no lights in the house? Why had no one come out on the porch to bid Roscoe good-bye? Why had not Roscoe slammed the auto door shut, as one naturally did, that being the easiest way to shut it?  Well, all that was Roscoe's business, not his, thought Tom, as he settled down to go to sleep, and perhaps he had closed the door quietly because he wished not to disturb any one so late at night. That was very thoughtful of Roscoe....  But just the same Tom could not go to sleep, and he lay in bed thinking uneasily.  He had just about conquered his misgivings and had begun to think how suspicious and ungenerous he was, when another question occurred to him which had the effect of a knockout blow to his peace of mind.  Why had Roscoe Bent told Miss Ellison that it was better to be a live coward than a dead hero?  --Why, he had only been joking, of course, when he said that! It was one of those silly, careless things that he was always saying. Miss Ellison had not seemed to think it was very funny, but that had only made Roscoe laugh the more. \"I'd rather kill time than kill Germans,\" he had said lightly. And Miss Ellison had said, \"You're quite brave at killing time, aren't you?\"  It was just joking and jollying, thought Tom, as he turned over for the fourth or fifth time, and he wished that _he_ could joke and jolly like that. He made up his mind that when Roscoe came upstairs in the morning he would ask him whether the Germans weren't cowards to murder innocent women and children, and whether he would really want to be like them. He believed he could say that much without a tremor, even in front of Miss Ellison.  He wished morning would come so that he could be sure that Roscoe ... so that he could say that when Roscoe came upstairs.  \"I'll bet he'll be sleepy after being out so late,\" thought Tom.     CHAPTER IV  THE CUP OF JOY   Tom was to have the next day off for his patriotic activities, but he went to the Temple Camp office early in the morning to get the mail opened and attend to one or two routine duties.  He found Miss Ellison already at her desk, and she greeted him with a mysterious smile.  \"I hear you're going to be one of the celebrities,\" she said, busying herself with her typewriter machine.  \"One of the what?\" said Tom.  \"One of the leading"]]]
