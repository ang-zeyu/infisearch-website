If you knew how for the last thirty years this has preyed upon my mind, you would comprehend my anxiety on this account; but God's will be done.  Do not let me detain you longer, Alexander; I should prefer being alone.\"  Alexander, at this intimation, took the proffered hand of his grand-uncle in a reverential and feeling manner, and, without saying any more, quitted the room.    CHAPTER TWO.  The conversation which he had had with his grand-uncle made a very forcible impression upon Alexander Wilmot; it occasioned him to pass a very sleepless night, and he remained till nearly four o'clock turning it over in his mind.  The loss of the _Grosvenor_ Indiaman had occurred long before he was born; he was acquainted with the outline of what had taken place, and had been told, when a child, that a relation of his family had perished; but although the narrative had, at the time, made some impression upon his young mind, he had seldom, if ever, heard it spoken of since, and may have been said to have almost forgotten it.  He was therefore not a little surprised when he found how great an influence it had upon his grand-uncle, who had never mentioned it to him before; indeed it had escaped Alexander's memory that it was his grand-uncle's only surviving daughter who had been lost in the vessel.  Alexander Wilmot was warmly attached to the old gentleman; indeed, he would have been very ungrateful if he had not been, for it was impossible that any one could have been treated with more kindness and liberality than he was by Sir Charles.  It was but the week before, that he had expressed a wish to travel on the continent, and Sir Charles had immediately given his consent that he should remain abroad, if he pleased, for two years.  When he approved, however, of Alexander's plans, he had made a remark as to his own age and infirmity, and the probable chance that they might not meet again in this world; and this remark of his grand-uncle left such an impression upon Alexander, that he almost repented having made the request, and had been ever since in a state of indecision as to whether he should avail himself of his grand-uncle's kindness and disregard of self, shown towards him in thus having granted his permission.  The conversation with Sir Charles had brought up a new idea in his mind; he had witnessed the anxiety and longing which his good old relation had shown about the fate of his daughter; he had heard from his own lips how long the ignorance of her fate had preyed upon his mind, and that to be satisfied on this point was the one thing wanting to enable the old man to die happy,--to permit him to say with sincerity, \"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.\"  Why, then, should he not go to discover the truth?  It would not, perhaps, occupy him so long as the two years of travelling on the continent, which had been consented to by his grand-uncle, and, instead of travelling for his own pleasure, he might be the means of satisfying the mind and quieting the anxiety of one who had been so kind to him.  Indeed, he should actually prefer a journey into the interior of Africa to a mere sojourn of some time on the continent; the very peril and danger, the anticipation of distress and hardship, were pleasing to his high and courageous mind, and before he fell asleep Alexander had made up his mind that he would propose the expedition, and if he could obtain his uncle's permission would proceed upon it forthwith.  Having come to this resolution, he fell fast asleep and dreamed away, till eight o'clock in the morning, that he was hunting elephants and having hand-to-hand conflicts with every variety of beast with which he had peopled Africa in his fancy.  When he was called up in the morning, he found his determination of the night before rather strengthened than otherwise, and accordingly, after breakfast was over, he opened the subject.  \"My dear sir,\" said he to Sir Charles, \"you were kind enough to give me your permission to travel on the continent for two years.\"  \"I did do so, Alexander; it is natural at your age that you should wish to see the world, and you have my full permission.  When do you think of starting?\"  \"That depends upon circumstances, sir, and I must be altogether guided by you; to tell you the truth, I do not think that one sees much of the world by following in the beaten track made by so many of our countrymen.\"  \"There I agree with you; in the present high state of civilisation there will be found little or no difference in the manners and customs of people; in the courts, none; very little in the best society, in which you will of course mix; and not so very much as people may imagine among the mass of population; but the scenery of the countries and the remains of ancient times are still interesting, and will afford pleasure; it must be your own reflections and comments upon what you see which must make it profitable; most people, however, travel from the love of change, added to the love of excitement.\"  \"I grant it, sir, and I do not mean to say but that I should receive much pleasure from a continental tour; perhaps I may add that I should derive more profit if I were to delay it till I am a little older and a little wiser; do you not think so?\"  \"I certainly do, Alexander.  What then? do you propose remaining in England for the present?--if so, I am sure it is on my account, and I am very grateful to you for your sacrifice.\"  \"If you wish it, sir, I will undoubtedly remain in England; at all events, if I do not go elsewhere.  I have abandoned my continental tour for the present; but I have another proposal to make, which I hope will meet with your approbation.\"  \"Why, my dear Alexander, on what expedition would you now proceed?  Do you wish to visit the United States or South America?\"  \"No, sir; I wish to make a voyage of still more interest--I wish to go to Africa,--that is, to embark for the Cape of Good Hope, and from thence proceed to the northward, to ascertain, if possible, what now is a source of sad disquiet to you, the actual fate of those who were wrecked in the _Grosvenor_, and have not since been heard of with any degree of certainty.\"  Sir Charles was for a time silent.  He pressed his hands to his forehead; at last he removed them, and said,--\"I cannot, much as I wish it, no,--I cannot consent, my dear boy; the danger will be too great. You must not risk your life.  It is very kind of you--very kind; but no, it must not be.\"  \"Indeed, sir, I think, on reflection, you will alter your mind.  As for danger--what danger can there be when missionaries are permitted to form their stations, and reside uninjured among the very savages who were so hostile when the _Grosvenor_ was lost?  The country, which was then a desert, is now inhabited by Europeans, within 200 miles of the very spot where the _Grosvenor_ was wrecked.  The continual emigration since the Cape has fallen under British government, and the zeal of those who have braved all dangers to make known the Word of God to the heathen and idolater, have in forty years made such an alteration, that I see no more danger in the mission which I propose than I do in a visit to Naples; and as for time, I have every reason to expect that I shall be back sooner than in the two years which you have proposed for my stay on the continent.\"  \"But if some accident were to happen to you, I should never forgive myself for having given my consent, and the few days that are left to me would be rendered miserable.\"  \"My dear sir, we are in the hands of God; and (short-sighted as we are) in running away from danger, as often run into it.  What we call an accident, the fall of a brick or a stone, the upsetting of a vehicle, anything however trivial or seemingly improbable, may summon us away when we least expect it: `In the midst of life we are in death,' and that death I may meet by staying in this country, which I might have avoided by going on this expedition.  Difficulties may arise, and some danger there may be, I admit; but when prepared to encounter both, we are more safe than when, in fancied security, we are taken unawares.  Do not, I entreat you, sir, refuse me this favour; I have considered well, and shall be most unhappy if I am not permitted to obtain the information for you which you have so much at heart.  Let my travels be of some advantage to you as well as to myself.  Do not refuse, I entreat you.\"  \"You are a good boy, Alexander, and your kindness makes me still more unwilling to part with you.  I hardly know what to say.  Let us drop the subject for the present; we will talk of it to-morrow or next day.  I must have time for reflection.\"  Alexander Wilmot did not fail to renew his entreaties on the following day, but could not gain Sir Charles's consent.  He was not, however, discouraged.  He had taken from the library all the works he could find relative to Southern Africa, and continually enforcing his arguments by quotations from various authors, all tending to prove that he might travel through the country without much risk, if he took proper precautions, his grand-uncle's objections grew daily more feeble, and at last Sir Charles gave his unwilling consent.  In the mean time, the books which Alexander had read had produced a great effect upon him. When he first proposed the mission, it was more from a feeling of gratitude towards his old relative than any other, but now he was most anxious to go on his own account.  The narratives of combats with wild beasts, the quantity and variety of game to be found, and the continual excitement which would be kept up, inflamed his imagination and his love of field-sports, and he earnestly requested to be permitted to depart immediately, pointing out to Sir Charles that the sooner he went away the sooner he would be back again.  This last argument was not without its weight, and Alexander was allowed to make "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21566"],["title","The Good Old Songs We Used to Sing, '61 to '65 (#1)"],["body","who so vauntingly swore   That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion A home and a country should leave us no more?

Union soldiers gain the day!_\" Upon hearing such      glorious news Chaplain McCabe sung this soul-stirring hymn,      all the prisoners joining heartily in the chorus, making the      old prison walls ring--\"Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!\"  [Illustration: SIXTEENTH CORPS.]  Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is tramping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible quick sword;      His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps; They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps; I have read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;      His day is marching on.  CHORUS.--Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!  I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel, \"As ye deal with my contemners, so with my grace shall deal; Let the hero born of woman crush the serpent with his heel,      Since God is marching on.\"  CHORUS.--Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!
