So, rather late to bed; Mr. Brown making up his Diary, as usual, on the dressing-table--a rule he always observed, though, in some cases, it would have been better left until the morning; for, against December 24th, Tuesday, we find his feelings richly expressed in cramped caligraphy, upside down, bearing evident marks of excitement;--having been penned--in a dream--with hair-dye, mistaken for ink; pounced with carmine, and blotted with the small-tooth-comb in lieu of paper; it is, moreover, curious for its allegorical allusions--likening Captain de Camp to a \"brick,\" a \"downey card,\" a \"sharp file,\" and several other inanimate poetical images.  Of our mild friend, Spohf, he is sleeping soundly upon a light supper--obtained from \"St. Stiff's dairy\"--some very thin milk, divested of all unctuous quality--that having gone to an epicure Captain, at the Albert Villa. Poor Spohf's talent has not put many _talents_ in his purse--these real racing times run over genius!--they would tunnel Helicon, turn Hippocrene to flush a city's drains,--make Pegasus serve letters by carrying a post-boy, and, in the end, sell the noble beast for feline food:--everything now must be tangible. The little organist, who had spent so many a Merry Christmas with the Browns--he has no pleasure to anticipate on the morrow, except the performance of his new hymn, \"The Star of Bethlehem,\" a composition of which the little tailor in the attic thought small things, for it did not _compose_ him to sleep.    [Illustration: \"SAFE BIND--SAFE FIND.\"]  The 25th of December arrives.--The festival of the year has come. Christmas-day commences with the rising of the cook, who finished the evening, kneading and gaping over pies and puddings; and wakes with the same operation, gaping and kneading her eyes, which do not fairly open until she comes to look after her first care--the pudding:--the fire, having been made up over night, is discovered a \"beauty;\" but, behold,--within the copper, the pudding has dissolved!--there is nothing to be found but a cloth, which must have been boiling all night in a rich plum-soup,--the string having come untied; or rather, never been tied at all, but popped in by Mrs. B. without attending to that operation:--a piece of neglect, for which the cook gets \"warning,\" and all the servants rated--until the bells of St. Stiff's remind Mrs. B. that it is time to depart, for the duties of a Christian, to eschew all the vanities of this wicked world, in a rich purple Genoa velvet paletot and duck of a plum bonnet. That day Mr. Churchwarden Brown's pue would not hold all, so Mrs. Strap, the pue-opener, had to manoeuvre by appropriating part of another to their use, losing her Christmas-box for the offence against its owner, Mr. Din, the copper-smith.  Mr. Spohf's Christmas hymn is much liked, and is really so fine as to make that essence of gentleness, himself, temporarily egotistical; he wonders what impression it has made upon Miss Jemima, and the strange gentleman who is so attentive to her--could he do as much? But Mr. Latimer de Camp is heedless of other good things flying about him; for, upon the walk home after service, among the savoury Christmas dinners that are hurrying in every direction, he is so abstracted as to find a sucking-pig in his stomach, and not a little gravy spilt upon his trowsers, compelling him to change them, upon his arrival at home, for a neat pair of young Brown's.    [Illustration: Good living at least once a year]  Mr. Spohf, having played all out of St. Stiff the Martyr, walks home moodily:--instead of finding his dinner as usual, the chop and potato, he learns that his landlord, Mr. Strap, the greengrocer, has stopped the supplies. It is quarter-day!--Strap thinks of the five weeks' arrears, and Mr. Spohf's inability to pay for his lodgings; so, Mr. and Mrs. Strap have surprised him, by preparing a huge leg of mutton and pudding; for they know he does not, as of old, go to the \"Willer.\" After this humble repast, which was relished as much as any could be, and was far less likely to leave unpleasant sensations than if it had been more costly, they draw round the fire; and master Ichabod Strap, one of the choristers of St. Stiff the Martyr, is playing with a shilling, polishing the coin upon his sleeve--it is the identical one said to have been put in the plate by Captain de Camp, and given by Mr. Flyntflayer (the gentleman who held the gothic platter) to Mrs. Strap, the pue-opener, advising her at the same time to nail it to the counter--a counterfeit to deter \"smashers.\" But, somehow, the coin seemed doomed to remain unholy, for no orifice or artifice could have rendered it a _lucky_ one; it was shown to Mr. Spohf, who thought it bad, and that it might have gotten into the plate by mistake; Mrs. Strap knew it bad--an intentional perpetration,--and, like the giver, not worth a dump; Mr. Strap not only thought it bad, but proved it so; for, after having spun, sounded, and eaten a portion of it, he cast the coin into the glowing fire, where the silver quickly changed, dropping, like quick-silver, among the ashes, to be picked out by Ichabod, very unlike a sterling coin.    [Illustration]  Old Strap, who had taken \"the pledge,\" but since introduced an exceptional clause in favour of feasts and festivals, gets out the black bottle for fraternity's sake. They take a pipe a-piece, and so softened is the little organist with their genuine unsophisticated kindness, that he sees all his cares fly, and nothing but joys in the wreathed curls of smoke betaking themselves up the chimney:--he sees Messrs. Blow and Grumble, the eminent organ-builders, making a fortune by his \"new movement;\" having purchased and patented it: he has found a publisher for his church music, and sold his old opera. Captain de Camp has vanished in smoke--he has exploded of spontaneous combustion,--they find him all deceit, leaving a glass eye and a cork leg. Mr. Latimer gets the Colonial Bishopric of Bushantee, in New Zealand, and cuts Miss Jemima. Mr. Wellesley having gone to India for glory, returns with it,--a hook, and a patch over his eye. Miss Angelina vows to die a virgin. Mr. Brown says to Mr. Spohf, \"my son!\"--Mr. Spohf says to Mr. Brown, \"my father!\" Mr. Strap is standing in triumph upon a pyramid of \"carpets to beat,\" viewing a lesser one of \"boots to brush;\" having been entrusted with more \"messages\" than mortal ever could \"deliver;\" whilst innumerable vans, bearing the name of Strap, traverse innumerable roads in \"Town and Country.\" Mrs. Strap, dressed in a plain plum silk, turns a mahogany mangle, and gets up nothing but \"fine things.\" Ichabod has cut the choir, and made his _d√©but_ in an opera as Herr Strapii, a perfect triumph.  But here we will leave Mr. Spohf's reverie--for Victoria and reality; where the company is arriving to the annual dinner, and sitting about the drawing-room, looking as happy as patients at a dentist's; or festive, as disappointed toadeaters at the funeral of an opulent relative, who had left all his property to found an asylum for decayed postboys--after leading everybody to expect the lion's share of it:--the guests, for want of more exciting topics, admiring the gimcracks they admired a year ago; thinking the portrait of Mr. Brown--\"done,\" twenty years since, at a portrait club,--a splendid likeness, and that the original grows younger (query, richer?); stating truths and untruths about the weather; inquiring energetically after each other's health--not caring for the answers; with other homely pleasantries, too numerous to mention; until some of the juveniles--the only ones who really seem at home--espy from the window a loaded parcel-cart; this they observe as funny on a Sunday (little thinking, at that moment, it was Tuesday). Here Mr. Brown descends, to hold an altercation with the guard of that cart, who makes light of a huge hamper of game; whilst the guests at the windows above, speculate upon having to eat an uncooked turkey, or fancy their ravenous appetites waiting while it is cooked--the youngsters calculating upon a dinner all pudding. Mr. Brown returns, and tenders his arm to Lady Lucretia de Camp--in the excitement, leading her down the side where the stairs taper to nothing,--causing that lady to lose both equilibrium and temper.    [Illustration: THE PUDDING.   AS IT OUGHT TO HAVE APPEARED.]  In the hall they are introduced to the viands, all thought to partake of;--which have arrived too late, and are now displayed in their primitive state--a picture of still life; whilst the guests--a picture of disappointment--have to put up with odds and ends, concocted to meet the emergency, ending with a series of plum-dumplings, in place of the legitimate large pudding. However, the indigent relatives, who prefer the cold corners, and take \"any part,\" declare themselves well satisfied:--all partaking of everything, and brandy afterwards, as if the viands were rich. Master Brown does justice to everything, of course--that sweet child is now pulling the _merry thought_ with his maiden aunt; he is victor, and, as no one wishes to know his _thoughts_, seems determined to tell them,--_wishing_ \"Jemy. and Mr. Latimer would look sharp, and knock up the match Mamma spoke of; as then he should be breeched, have pockets, and money:\" here the little dear turned to the Captain, saying, \"You'll give me a crown, won't you?\"--a question at which the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20259"],["title","Frontier Boys in Frisco (#1)"],["body","up the track and then at his heavy, open-faced watch. \"What do you suppose is the matter with her? No need of losing time on a night like this,\" he continued.  \"Maybe she has been held up,\" said the fireman.  \"That's more likely to happen to us,\" replied the engineer shortly. \"No. 10 doesn't carry anything but the money the newsboy gets out of the passengers for peanuts and bum dime novels but we have something in that express car that's going to California and it's valuable.\"  \"I'm going to California,\" put in Jim mildly.  \"But you ain't valuable,\" replied the engineer with a grin.  \"Except with this,\" said Jim, putting his hand on his revolver, with a touch of seeming bravado.  \"That's where you come in,\" said the engineer.  \"I thought you weren't giving me a ride just for the fresh air, and to get a view of the 'mountings' by moonlight. But where do you expect these villains to jump you?\" inquired Jim.  \"Well, there are numerous, romantic, little spots along the trail ahead where they might stop us for an interview,\" said Ketchel.  \"I'm thinking they will be a lurking in 'Boxwood Canyon,'\" said Bill Sheehan, the fireman. \"It's the likes of a dirty black gang that will do the deed, the same that shot poor Jimmie McGuire last month because he wouldn't give up his train to 'em, and him with three childer at home.\"  \"There comes 'No. 10.'\" cried Jim, \"and it will be all aboard for Boxwood Canyon.\"  \"Aye, but you have sharp ears, I don't hear anything of her as yet,\" remarked Bill.  \"Him has sharp ears and eyes, Bill!\" exclaimed the engineer. \"That boy there can take the trail with any red Indian and that's the truth.\"     CHAPTER II  A HOLD UP   At that moment there came a glare of light sweeping down the track from the headlight of \"No. 10.\" With a roar and swaying of the big engine, the train rushed down upon them and swept past with its hind heels or wheels kicking up the dust. Then its tail lights of cherry red grew dim way down the valley.  \"All aboard, boys,\" cried Ketchel as No. 10 passed; \"we've got some time to make up.\"  \"He'll stop just short of murder to the train,\" declared the fireman who knew his engineer when it came to a question of picking up a few minutes of time.  \"He will swing her like he used to drive the old stagecoach on the down grade,\" remarked Jim, \"and that will be going some.\"  Already they were gathering speed, as he sent \"The General Denver\" along the level of the valley. In a short time the train came to a steep descent through a narrow canyon, and Jim was in for a new experience. Enured though he was to all kinds of dangers it made him catch his breath when the engine went straight for a wall of solid rock and then turned as though to dash straight from the track, into the brawling stream below.  It righted itself with an effort and leaped down the shining trail rocking from side to side and trembling with the vibrations of its fierce power, dashing straight for the depths of the shadows between the towering cliffs. Little did the sleeping passengers realize the dangers through which they were passing every minute.  \"Gee!\" exclaimed Jim, \"suppose a bowlder has rolled onto the track just ahead. It might happen easy enough too.\"  Just then, Bill Sheehan, the fireman, touched Jim with the end of his shovel to call his attention to something they were coming to ahead. Jim saw a jumbled heap of freight cars half in the stream and half out, and a little ways further on was the rusty ruin of a once powerful locomotive. Jim nodded to the fireman.  \"Something has been doing there,\" he yelled, but the words were blown from his lips and lost in the roar as steam disappears in the air. Jim took a look at his friend, the engineer. He was alert and intent, ready for any emergency, and Jim felt a sense of absolute confidence in his friend's skill. After a ten mile run, the canyon began to broaden out and there were other trees besides the solemn pines. A sense of impending danger came over Jim. He had experienced it many times before and whether it was an ambush of Indians, or the plans of some band of outlaws it had rarely betrayed him. It was something in the air; a vibration that the human nerves are as conscious of as a dog's nose is cognizant of the scent of some wild animal. Jim turned and looked at the engineer, who nodded back at him for a second, with a look that indicated there was business ahead; then his eyes were fastened on the track again.  Jim took out his watch and saw that it was a quarter to two. It brought a quizzical smile to his face. Time and again he had noted the fact that it was just about this time that an attack was sure to come. It sent a thrill through his nerves for he felt that they were rushing straight to a crisis. Much depended on the three men in the engine, for there were many helpless women and children on the train for whose safety they were responsible. Jim noted that the country through which they were going was well suited for the purposes of the bandits desiring to hold up the train.  On either side the walls of the mountains rose at the distance of only a few hundred yards, covered with dark pines and huge rocks showing here and there on the bare fall of some precipice. Between the foot of the mountains and the track was rugged ground, with large bowlders scattered here and there. Clumps of trees and bushes and numerous gullies could be discerned.  It was just the country for a surprise of this kind. Jim stepped down from his narrow seat and got his hands thoroughly warm and pliable, took off his coat and folded it neatly on the seat and stood with his revolver in hand, seeing whether its action was all right. He was a stalwart figure indeed, dressed in his characteristic regimentals, with a thick, tight fitting sweater of blue, pants of the same color, and a new sombrero of a dark hue, for the old one had been battered and worn out of all semblance to a hat, and he was obliged to give it up, though it was like parting with an old friend.  Jim as you remember, perhaps, was a trifle over six feet in height and during his short stay at home he had gained in flesh, so that he weighed one hundred and eighty-five pounds. His hair was brown and straight and his eyes gray. He was doubtless fit for this battle or any that should come his way.  Just at that moment, Bob Ketchel saw an obstruction on the track, about two hundred yards distant, and applied the air brakes instantly. He had been on the watch for just this thing, and noted that there was plenty of cover where the express was halted wherein the desperadoes could hide.  Slowly the panting engine came to a stop with its nose almost against the stone obstruction and there were flashes from a half dozen rifles on either side of \"The General Denver.\" A simultaneous attack was made at the rear of the train.  It was hardly a fair duel but Jim and Bob Ketchel were competent hands at this game and keeping under cover they managed to get in some telling shots. A near bullet sent a splinter from the cab into Jim's cheek, but he paid no attention to it at the time. When he caught a sudden glimpse of two men skulking behind a clump of bushes trying to get a bead on him, he sent two shots straight at them and then ducked into the cab in time to escape a side shot from behind a rock.  He could hear Bob's fusillade from the other side of the cab and the return volleys from the enemy, but he did not worry about his friend, the engineer, for he knew full well that he could take care of himself. It was the other fellows who would have to look out. But Jim saw a figure leap in behind a rock, near the side of the express car, where he would have the drop on Bob.  There was but one thing to do and James did it. He leaped into the tender which made an excellent fort, and there for a few minutes he kept the bandits at bay. He would have laughed heartily at the fireman, Bill Sheehan, if he could have spared the time, for that worthy had taken up the battle in his own way. Having quickly discarded his revolver with which he was not an expert, he began hurling chunks of coal, wherever he saw the flash of the enemy's fire, and filled with fighting fury he exposed himself most recklessly, but with no apparent harm. Whether Bill's novel form of attack made the attacking party helpless with laughter or because he was in such constant motion that it was hard to get a bead on him, be the reason what it may, at least Sheehan came through unscathed.  For a brief time, the battle was even, in fact the engineer and Jim probably had the best of it, and then there came a change in the situation. The party in the rear, saw that their brethren were meeting with a sharp resistance from the engine, so two of them swiftly and stealthily ran along by the side of the train until they came to the baggage car next to the engine.  Slipping in between the two cars they quickly got on top of the baggage. Any noise they might have made being deadened by the firing going on just below. The desperadoes redoubled their attack when they saw two of their number about to turn the fight in their favor, for it was perfectly clear what an advantage their position on the roof of the car would give them.  They could not be hit themselves even if discovered, and it was certain death for Jim and the engineer for they would not be more than thirty feet from the two desperadoes. Even a tenderfoot would not miss at that distance and these men were not in that class. Neither Jim nor Bob Ketchel were standing so that they could catch a glimpse of the two men who were crawling along the top of the blind baggage. At that instant, Bill Sheehan made a rush for the top of the coal pile to get a chunk of ammunition of sufficient size and weight.     CHAPTER III  JIM TAKES A CHANCE   As Sheehan mounted the coal, he caught a glimpse of one of the desperadoes on top of the car and yelled to Ketchel and Jim who jumped just in the nick of time, and by sheer luck not"]]]
