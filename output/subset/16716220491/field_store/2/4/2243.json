At the same time he bounded towards her.  Of course Spot's yelps warned her to run. The moment she heard his first bark she forgot all about her own hunt, being herself the hunted. She scurried off across the farmyard, with Spot tearing after her.  If she had had time enough Miss Kitty would have climbed a tree. But Spot was altogether too near her for that. And being a stranger about the farmyard, she hadn't learned all the fine hiding places. Since Spot was between her and the house, she made for the barn and sprang through the open door. Inside Spot quickly cornered her.  With her back arched and her tail almost as big as Tommy Fox's brush, Miss Kitty Cat turned and faced her pursuer.     IV  A TENDER NOSE   \"HURRAH!\" old dog Spot barked. At least, what he said sounded a good deal like that.  He had cornered Miss Kitty Cat in the barn. And there was nothing he liked more than teasing anybody that was short-tempered as she was.  \"_Tchah!_\" Miss Kitty hissed.  Now, that ought to have been warning enough to Spot to keep a good, safe distance from her. But he was one of the sort that never knows enough to take a warning for what it is worth.  \"_Wow!_\" he chuckled. \"You needn't think I'm afraid of you. If you ran from me once, you'll run again.\"  He didn't intend to hurt Miss Kitty. All he wanted was to get her to run across the yard again, so that he might have the sport of chasing her. So he edged nearer and nearer her, thinking that she would dodge past him and run out of the barn.  But Miss Kitty Cat had no relish for that sport.  \"Keep your distance, sir!\" she cried. And though she spoke plainly enough, old Spot paid no heed to her words. Instead, he gave a quick spring at her, just to worry her a bit more.  To his great surprise, almost at that same instant Miss Kitty Cat sprang at him. And as she jumped, she flashed one of her paws out and struck Spot on one side of his long nose.  It was not just a gentle tap with a soft, well-padded paw. She thrust her claws well out from between her toes. And jabbing them deep into Spot's tender nose, she gave a sharp downward pull.  All at once old dog Spot thought of the time when, as a puppy, he stuck his nose into a hornet's nest. His joyful bark changed suddenly to a shrill _ki-yi_ of pain. And at the same time he became angry.  \"You don't know how to have fun,\" he growled at Miss Kitty Cat. \"Just to teach you better manners I'm going to take you by the back of your neck and shake you.\"  It appeared that Miss Kitty herself had quite a different notion. At least, she went through an entirely different motion, which was not at all like offering the back of her neck for old Spot to seize. When Spot reached for her she clawed him furiously, with one paw after another, while she told him what she thought of him.  He did not wait to hear everything that Miss Kitty had to say to him. Spot thought too much of his nose to linger in the barn any longer, but turned tail and hurried into the yard.  Miss Kitty Cat chased him as far as the door. Taking one quick backward glance at her as he went, Spot noticed how fiercely her eyes glared. It was a terrible sight. And it made him hasten all the faster.  \"My goodness! What a temper!\" he said under his breath.  Loping across the farmyard, he looked about him uneasily. He hoped nobody had seen Miss Kitty Cat driving him out of the barn. He knew it would be a hard matter to explain to any one. All his farmyard friends would be sure to think it a great joke.  Luckily there was no one in sight except Henrietta Hen.  \"She won't notice anything,\" Spot assured himself. \"She's the stupidest person on the farm.\"  Having nothing more to worry about except his scratched nose, old Spot crawled under the woodshed and nursed his wounds during the rest of the morning.  As for Miss Kitty Cat, she stayed in the barn a long time.  \"What a worthless fellow that old dog is!\" she thought. \"This barn is full of mice! I don't believe he has caught one in all the years he has lived on the farm.\"     V  SPOTS AND SPECKLES   WHEN she first met Miss Kitty Cat face to face Henrietta Hen exclaimed, \"What a pity!\"  Miss Kitty Cat hadn't intended to speak to Henrietta Hen at all. She didn't care, as a rule, to have anything to do with hens. She often remarked that she liked eggs and she liked chickens; but she never could see what hens were good for.  Well, when Henrietta Hen spoke to her like that Miss Kitty Cat paused and stared at her coolly for a moment or two. Then she asked in rather a distant tone, \"What's a pity?\"  Now, Henrietta Hen seldom knew when she was snubbed. And goodness knows people snubbed her often enough, too. For she was forever making remarks about their looks. And now she said to Miss Kitty Cat, \"It's a pity your speckles are so big.\"  Miss Kitty Cat saw at once that Henrietta Hen was a vain creature. She had half a mind to walk on and leave her, without saying another word to her. Indeed, Miss Kitty had turned aside to continue her stroll towards the meadow when Henrietta Hen spoke to her again.  \"Don't you think,\" Henrietta demanded, \"that speckles should be worn very small, like mine? Don't you think yours are too big?\"  \"I'd rather not talk with you,\" said Miss Kitty Cat. \"I can see plainly that we'd never agree.\"  \"Oh, do stop for a while!\" Henrietta Hen besought her. \"I love a chat with a cat,\" she added with a silly giggle.  Miss Kitty Cat was vexed. She thought that Henrietta Hen was a tiresome person.  \"Ill stop and have a chat with you,\" Miss Kitty relented, \"for it's not often that I meet a spotted hen. If my speckles are too big,\" she went on in an icy tone, \"it is just as true that your spots are altogether too small.\"  \"Spots!\" Henrietta cackled. Like all empty-headed people, she was quick to lose her temper. \"Spots indeed! I'd have you know that I haven't any spots. I'm a speckled beauty--that's what I am. And if you don't believe it you can ask the Rooster.\"  \"Perhaps I was mistaken,\" Miss Kitty Cat purred. \"Anyhow, I'll take _your_ word about the Specks. I won't bother to ask the Rooster.\"  \"Ah!\" Henrietta Hen exclaimed. \"You're afraid of him! You're afraid he might want to fight you. And I wish he would,\" she screamed at Miss Kitty, \"for it's plain that you're no gentleman.\"  \"Well--I should hope not!\" Miss Kitty Cat gasped.  \"I thought you were a gentleman, or I should never have spoken to you,\" Henrietta Hen declared. \"When I first saw you I said to myself, 'Here's a quiet, polite gentleman! It will be pleasant to have him living at the farmhouse.' But I see that I was mistaken.\"  \"You were!\" cried Miss Kitty, who was--to say the least--greatly astonished by Henrietta's odd remarks. \"My name is Miss Kitty Cat. And what made you think I was a gentleman is more than I can guess.\"  \"_Miss!_\" cried Henrietta. \"_Miss!_ Then why, pray tell me, do you wear those whiskers?\"  Try as she would, Miss Kitty could give no reason that satisfied Henrietta Hen. And Henrietta always declared that Miss Kitty Cat was a strange, strange person.     VI  BEECHNUT SHUCKS   ONCE in a while Frisky Squirrel paid a visit to Farmer Green's place. Although he had learned that the farmyard was not without its dangers, after one adventure Frisky was always sure to return, sometime, as if in search of another.  So a certain fine, fall day found him scampering along the top of the stone wall that followed the road as it dropped down the hill from the woods to Farmer Green's front gate.  Old Mr. Crow, sailing lazily over the yellowing fields, caught sight of the stone wall traveller and glided into a tree beside the road. \"You'd better not go near the farmyard, young fellow!\" old Mr. Crow called.  Frisky Squirrel stopped, sat down, and looked up at Mr. Crow in the tree above him.  \"Why not?\" Frisky inquired.  \"Haven't you heard the news?\" Mr. Crow asked him. \"Haven't you heard that there's a cat at the farmhouse?\"  \"I didn't know it,\" Frisky admitted. \"But I don't see why I should turn back. I won't hurt her.\"  Old Mr. Crow _haw-hawed_.  \"I don't believe,\" he croaked, \"you've ever met a cat.\"  \"No, I haven't,\" Frisky Squirrel replied, \"but I'd like to see one. So I'll be on my way. But don't worry, Mr. Crow? I won't hurt her.\" And then Frisky started off along the top of the stone wall once more, at a somewhat brisker pace to make up for lost time.  \"He can't say I didn't warn him,\" Mr. Crow exclaimed as he watched the bouncing bit of gray fur.  \"I hope Mr. Crow won't worry,\" said Frisky Squirrel to himself. \"If the cat gets hurt it will be her own fault, for I certainly won't harm her.\"  When Frisky reached the farmyard he crept around a corner of the barn, hoping to find a few kernels of corn. But Henrietta Hen had been there before him and there wasn't one kernel left. He ran here and there about the yard. And at last, when quite near the woodshed door, he sat up suddenly, twitched his nose a few times, and said, \"Ha! I smell beechnuts!\"  Now, that was not strange. Johnnie Green had been eating beechnuts in the woodshed doorway. And he had scattered the shucks on the broad stone step. Frisky Squirrel began nosing them. And just out of sight inside the woodshed Miss Kitty Cat awoke from a short nap, stopped right in the middle of a long stretch, and said, \"Ha! I smell a squirrel!\"  Miss Kitty Cat was wide awake in an instant. She flattened herself upon the woodshed floor and crept silently to the door. Though she didn't make the slightest sound, all at once Frisky Squirrel's nose twitched again, as he muttered to himself, \"There's a very queer smell about these beechnut shucks!\"  He was sitting on the edge of the stone doorstep with a bit of beechnut clutched in his paws. And when he looked up and saw somebody's nose appear in the doorway he tumbled right over backward. The only sound he made came from the beechnut shuck, which made a faint click as it fell upon the stone. And Miss "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21078"],["title","The Tale of Miss Kitty Cat (#2)"],["body","Cat's sharp ears caught it.     VII  TWO IN A TREE   WHEN Miss Kitty Cat dashed out of the woodshed Frisky Squirrel was two jumps ahead of her. That was really a better lead than it sounds. Frisky was always a good jumper. And the more scared he was, the further he could leap. Anybody that knew him well would have known then--just to see him--that something had given him a great fright.  First he had noticed a strange smell. Next he had seen a strange nose come stealing out of the woodshed door. And not knowing who was going to follow that nose, Frisky Squirrel felt that the sooner he climbed a tree the better it would be for him. So he made for a tall elm that wasn't too far away.  Though Miss Kitty Cat was a fast runner, Frisky reached the foot of the tree ahead of her. And he was half way to the lowest branches before he took a real look at his pursuer.  To his dismay he saw that the creature hadn't stopped at the foot of the tree. The monster had already begun climbing after him. Frisky had never seen any one just like this fierce person. One look was enough for him. He pushed higher and higher into the tree-top and crept far out on a drooping limb, which swayed beneath his weight as he clung to it.  There he paused, while he watched to see what the stranger would do. And as he stared at the creature he remembered suddenly what Mr. Crow had told him. \"There's a cat at the farmhouse,\" the old gentleman had said.  \"This must be the cat,\" Frisky thought. And to her he called, \"If you're the cat, don't come any nearer, madam! You might get hurt.\" For he remembered, too, that he had told Mr. Crow that he wouldn't harm the cat.  \"It _is_ the cat,\" he said to himself presently, \"for she has stopped.\"  Miss Kitty Cat did not quite dare follow Frisky Squirrel to the tip where he swung. She crouched upon the branch a little way from him, where it was safer for her, and with switching tail and bristling whiskers waited to see what he would do next.  \"It makes me uneasy to see you swaying so,\" she told Frisky. \"Besides, you're shaking this limb. And I don't like it.\"  \"She's a fussy creature--this cat!\" Frisky said to himself. \"I promised Mr. Crow I wouldn't hurt her; but I didn't promise him that I wouldn't tease her.\" So he bobbed up and down with all his might.  \"Stop!\" cried Miss Kitty Cat. \"That's a very reckless thing to do. It's like rocking the boat.\"  \"I think it's the finest sport in the world,\" Frisky chuckled.  \"I know a finer,\" Miss Kitty snarled.  \"What that?\" he asked her.  \"If I could get my claws on you I'd soon show you,\" she told him grimly.  Somehow there was something about her remark that startled Frisky Squirrel--something that made him shiver. And when he shivered he lost his hold. Down he dropped, slipping and floundering from one branch to another.  And down Miss Kitty Cat followed him.     VIII  NINE LIVES   FRISKY SQUIRREL was much more at home in the trees than Miss Kitty Cat was. While Frisky managed at last to cling to a limb and right himself, Miss Kitty lost her footing and fell out of the tree completely.  \"Oh! She'll he hurt!\" Frisky cried as he saw her turning and twisting through the air. But to his great surprise she struck with all her four feet on the ground, quite unharmed. \"You did that very nicely,\" he called to her generously.  But she didn't answer. To tell the truth, she felt rather foolish because she had fallen out of the tree. And she walked back to the woodshed and stalked through the doorway without saying a word.  After that adventure Frisky Squirrel decided to go back home. So he scurried town the tree-trunk and scampered to the stone wall, and scooted along the top of it.  Old Mr. Crow was watching for him. And as before, he dropped down near the wall to talk.  \"I hardly expected to see you again,\" Mr. Crow remarked. \"You couldn't have met the cat.\"  \"Yes!\" said Frisky. \"I met her. She followed me up a tree. And it's a wonder she didn't get hurt, though I was careful of her. She had a fall; but she landed beautifully.\"  Old Mr. Crow nodded wisely.  \"She always lands on her feet,\" he observed. \"And you needn't worry about her,\" he added. \"You know, they say she has nine lives.\"  \"Nine lives!\" Frisky Squirrel exclaimed. \"What do you mean, Mr. Crow?\"  Now, Mr. Crow really knew a great deal, because he had lived many years. And he pretended to know still more, because he liked to appear learned. But this question was a puzzler for him. He simply couldn't answer it.  \"You wouldn't understand, even if I explained,\" he told Frisky Squirrel. And then he flew away, leaving Frisky to run home and wonder what it meant to have nine lives.  As for Mr. Crow, he suddenly made up his mind that he would find out about Miss Kitty Cat's nine lives. He would ask that lady herself. So he flapped himself over to the big elm in the farmyard, where he cawed and cawed, hoping that Miss Kitty Cat would appear to see what all the noise was about.  And sure enough! she soon bounced out of the woodshed door and looked up at Mr. Crow inquiringly.  \"I've been hearing a good deal about; you,\" Mr. Crow called down to her in what he considered his sweetest tones, though anybody else would have said they were quite hoarse. \"I know you always manage to land on your feet--and I can understand that. But what's this I hear about _nine lives?_\"  Miss Kitty Cat only stared at him.  \"Perhaps you don't feel like talking,\" said Mr. Crow. \"If you've just had a fall, maybe you're still a bit shaken up, even if you did land on your feet. Perhaps you'd rather I came back later.\"  Miss Kitty Cat suddenly found her voice.  \"You've been gossiping with that young squirrel!\" she snapped. \"I'll have you know that I'm not shaken up at all. But I'd shake you up if I could get hold of you!\"  Mr. Crow was astonished. He was sure he had been most polite. Yet here was Miss Kitty Cat as rude as she could be!  He amused himself by jeering at her until she turned her back on him and went inside the woodshed. And he had to go away without learning anything at all about the nine lives of Miss Kitty Cat. They always remained a deep mystery. Everybody agreed that the number was nine. But beyond that, nobody could explain about them.     IX  THE STOLEN CREAM   \"I DECLARE!\" Farmer Green's wife cried one day. \"Somebody's been stealing my cream in the buttery.\"  The buttery was a big bare room on the shady side of the house, where great pans of milk stood on a long table. When the cream was thick enough on the milk Mrs. Green skimmed it off and put it in cans. At one end of the buttery there was a trap door in the floor. When the trap was raised you could look right down into a well. And into its cool depths Mrs. Green dropped her cans of cream by means of a rope, which she fastened to a beam under the floor, so the tops of the cans would stay out of the water.  Mrs. Green made butter out of that cream. So it was no wonder she was upset when she discovered that some one had meddled with one of her pans of milk.  \"It can't be the cat,\" said Farmer Green's wife. \"The buttery door has been shut tight all the time.\"  Miss Kitty Cat was right there in the kitchen while Mrs. Green was talking to her husband. And it was easy to see that Miss Kitty agreed with her mistress. She came close to Mrs. Green and purred, saying quite plainly that she was a good, honest cat and that she deserved to be petted. At least, that was what Mrs. Green understood her to mean.  Often, after that, Mrs. Green discovered traces of the thief in the buttery. Flecks of cream on the side of a milk pan, drops of cream on the table, smudges of cream now and then on the floor! Such signs meant something. But Farmer Green's wife couldn't decide what.  And another strange thing happened. Miss Kitty Cat lost her appetite for milk. She would leave her saucer of milk untasted on the kitchen floor.  Now and then Mrs. Green picked Miss Kitty up and looked closely at her face. At such times Miss Kitty purred pleasantly. She did not seem to be the least bit disturbed.  One evening, after dark, Johnnie Green went into the buttery to get a pail. The moment he opened the door there was a crash and a clatter inside the room.  Johnnie jumped back quickly.  \"There's somebody in the buttery!\" he shouted.  But when his father brought a light they found no one there. A tin dipper lay on the floor.  \"When you opened the door it must have jarred the dipper off the edge of the table,\" said Farmer Green.  \"_Meaow!_\" said a voice behind them. There stood Miss Kitty Cat, saying that everything _must_ have happened exactly as Farmer Green said.  \"She couldn't have been in here, could she?\" Farmer Green puzzled. \"Come, Kitty!\" And he picked up Miss Kitty and held her where the light fell full upon her face. \"Clean as a whistle!\" said Farmer Green. \"I guess she just followed us in.\" He set her down again. And once more, with a plaintive _meaow_ she agreed with him perfectly.     X  A CREAMY FACE   FARMER GREEN'S wife threw away pan after pan of milk, because she knew somebody had been stealing cream off the top of them. At least, she told Farmer Green to feed the milk to the pigs, because she wasn't going to make butter of any cream that had been tampered with by goodness knew whom or what. And old dog Spot said that feeding good creamy milk to the pigs was just the same as throwing it away. He made that remark to Miss Kitty Cat, adding that it was a shame that somebody was stealing cream and declaring that he hoped to catch the thief.  Miss Kitty Cat made no reply whatsoever.  \"Don't you hope I'll catch the guilty party?\" Spot asked her.  \"Please don't speak to me!\" Miss Kitty Cat exclaimed impatiently. \"I don't enjoy your talk; and you may as well know it.\"  \"Very well!\" said Spot. \"But when I catch him I'll let you know.\"  \"She's jealous,\" Spot thought. \"She knows I'm a good watch dog. And she can't bear the idea of my catching a thief.\"  It was hard, usually, to tell how Miss Kitty"]]]
