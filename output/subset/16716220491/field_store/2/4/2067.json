St. John said I was an upstart, a nobody.\"  \"St. John had better mind his own business! It was not cousinly for him to interfere!\" And Marion's face flushed.  \"I suppose he doesn't look at me in the light of a cousin. He considers me an intruder.\"  \"Well, if he won't count you a cousin he need not count me one either--so there!\"  \"But you must not hurt yourself by standing up for me,\" cried Jack hastily.  \"I will not hurt myself--in the eyes of those whose respect is worth considering. In the eyes of the law you are my real brother, for my parents adopted you. St. John must not forget that.\"  \"But tell me of the past, Marion. Where did I come from, and how did I get here?\"  \"It's a long story, Jack. Do you see yonder wreck, on Hemlock Bluff rocks?\"  \"To be sure I do.\"  \"Well, when that wreck came ashore, between ten and eleven years ago, you had been one of the passengers on the boat.\"  \"Me!\"  \"Yes. I have heard mother tell of it several times. It was a fearful night and Old Ben, he was our slave then, was out on the bluff watching. Presently there was the booming of a signal gun--showing the ship was in distress--and soon the ship came in sight, rocking to and fro, with the wild waves running over her deck. Not a soul was left on board, captain and crew having all gone down in the ocean beyond.\"  \"But where did they find me?\"  \"On the beach. Old Ben heard a cry of pain and ran in the direction of the sound. Soon he made out the form of a woman, your mother. She had been hurt by being hit with some wreckage. You were in her arms, and as Old Ben came up you cried out: 'Jack is hungry. Give Jack some bread and butter, please.'\"  \"Yes, yes! I remember something of a storm and of the awful waves. But it's all dreamy-like.\"  \"You were only three or four years old, and the exposure nearly cost you your life. Old Ben took you and your mother to the boathouse and then ran up to the plantation for help. Father went back with him, along with half a dozen men, and they brought you and your mother to the house. I remember that time well, for I was nearly seven years old.\"  \"But my mother, what of her?\" asked Jack impatiently.  \"Poor dear! she died two days later. The physicians did all they could for her, but the shock had been too great, and she passed away without recovering consciousness.\"  \"Then she told nothing about me--who I was?\"  \"No. All she did say while she lived was 'Save my husband! Save my darling little Jack.'\"  \"Then my father must have been on the boat with her?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And they did not find his body?\"  \"No, the only bodies recovered were those of sailors.\"  \"Didn't they try to find out who I was?\"  \"To be sure, but, although father did his best, he could learn nothing. Your father and mother had taken passage on the ship at the last moment and their names did not appear on the list at the shipping offices, and none of the books belonging to the ship itself were ever recovered.\"  \"Perhaps they are on the wreck!\" cried Jack, struck by a sudden idea.  \"No, the wreck was searched from end to end, and all of value taken away.\"  \"I'd like to row over and look around.\"  \"You may do so, Jack. I presume the wreck will have more of an interest than ever for you now.\"  The distance to Hemlock Bluff rocks was a good mile, but Jack soon covered it and, bringing the boat to a safe corner, he assisted Marion out and then leaped out himself.  \"This news is enough to make a fellow's head whirl,\" he observed, as they walked in the direction of the wreck, which lay high up on the beach.  \"I suppose that is true, Jack. But do not let it worry you. You are as dear to mother and me as if you were one of the family.\"  \"But I would like to know who I really am.\"  \"Perhaps time will solve the mystery.\"  Soon the pair were at the wreck, which lay with its bow well up on the rocks and its stern projecting over the sea.  It was no mean task to reach the deck of the wreck, but Jack was a good climber and soon he was aboard. Then he gave Marion a hand up.  The deck of the wreck was much decayed, and they had to be careful how they moved around.  \"I am going below,\" said the youth, after a general look around.  \"Be careful. Jack, or you may break a limb,\" cautioned Marion.  \"I don't suppose you care to go down with me?\"  \"I think not--at least, I will wait until you have been down.\"  Soon Jack was crawling down the rotted companion way. At the bottom all was dirty and dark. He pushed open the door, which hung upon one rusty hinge, and peered into the cabin.  \"I wish I had brought a lantern along,\" he murmured, as he stepped into the compartment.  As Marion had said, the wreck had been cleared of everything of value. All the furniture was gone and the pantries and staterooms were bare. From the cabin he passed into several of the staterooms.  \"What have you found?\" called Marion.  \"Nothing much.\"  \"Any mice down there, or spiders?\"  \"None, so far as I can see.\"  \"Then I'll come down.\"  Soon Marion was beside Jack, and the pair made a tour of the wreck from bow to stern. Their investigations proved to be highly interesting, and they spent more time below than they had anticipated doing.  \"We must get back, Jack,\" said the girl at last.  \"Oh, there is no hurry! Mother is not at home,\" answered Jack. It seemed a bit odd to call Mrs. Ruthven mother now that he knew she was not his relative.  So fully another hour was spent below, moving from one part of the big wreck to another. Presently Jack came to a sudden stop and listened.  \"What a queer noise, Marion!\"  \"It is the wind rising. We had better be getting back, before the bay grows too rough for rowing.\"  \"You are right.\"  Jack ran up the companion way and Marion after him. To their surprise the sky was overcast, and the wind was whipping the surface of the bay into numerous whitecaps.  \"We must lose no time in getting back!\" cried Jack. \"As it is, the wind will be dead against us!\"  As quickly as possible he assisted Marion over the side, and then both set off on a run for the little cove where the rowboat had been left tied up.  As they gained the boat Jack gave an exclamation of dismay.  \"The oars--they are gone!\"  He was right. Marion had shifted their position before leaving the craft, and bumping against the rocks had sent them adrift.     CHAPTER IV.  ON BOARD THE WRECK.   \"Jack, what shall we do now?\" asked Marion, as with a blanched face she gazed into the empty boat.  \"Wait--the oars may be close at hand,\" he replied. \"I will make a search.\"  \"And so will I. Oh, we must find them!\"  They ran up and down the rocky shore, looking far and near for the oars, but without success. Presently they came to a halt, out of breath with running.  \"Gone, sure enough!\" groaned the boy. \"What a pickle we are in now!\"  \"We can't stay here, Jack.\"  \"We'll have to stay here, Marion, unless I can find the oars or make substitutes.\"  \"How are you going to make substitutes?\"  \"I might take some planks from the wreck.\"  \"But you have no tools.\"  \"I have a stout jack-knife.\"  \"It will take a long time, and see, it is already beginning to rain.\"  Marion was right, the rain had started, and as it grew heavier they withdrew to the shelter of the wreck.  \"I wouldn't mind staying here until the shower was over, only I wouldn't want mother to worry about us,\" went on Marion, when they were safe under cover.  \"That's just it. But we do not know if she is home yet.\"  The rain soon increased, while the thunder rolled in the distance. But they felt fairly safe in the cabin of the wreck, and sat down on a bench running along one of the walls.  \"This looks as if it was going to keep up all night,\" observed Jack, an hour later, after another look at the sky from the top of the companion way.  \"Oh, you don't mean we'll have to remain here all night!\" exclaimed Marion.  \"Perhaps, Marion.\"  \"But I do not wish to remain in such a place all night.\"  \"Are you afraid of ghosts?\" and Jack gave a short laugh.  \"No, Jack; but you'll admit it isn't a very nice place.\"  \"I know that. But that isn't the worst of it.\"  \"Not the worst of it?\"  \"No. You must remember that we have nothing to eat or to drink here.\"  \"That is true, but I do not feel much like eating or drinking just now.\"  \"Yes, but you'll be hungry and thirsty before morning, Marion.\"  \"Perhaps. We can drink rain water, if we wish.\"  Another hour passed and the storm grew more violent. The lightning flashed across the sky and lit up the wreck from end to end. Then a blackness as of night followed.  \"We could not row ashore now, even if we had oars,\" observed Marion, as she listened to the howling of the wind.  \"You are right, Marion. My, how it does blow!\"  Suddenly, the sounds of footsteps on the deck of the wreck reached their ears.  \"Somebody is coming!\" said Jack, and looked up the companion way. \"Why, it's Old Ben!\"  He was right; it was Ben the fisherman who had put in an appearance, market basket in hand.  \"Marion! Jack! Am dat yo'?\" came in an anxious voice.  \"Yes, Ben!\" cried both.  \"What brought you?\" continued the boy.  \"I dun thought yo' was a-wantin' ob Ole Ben,\" grinned the colored man. \"I seed yo' rowin' off an' I didn't see yo' cum back, so I says to myself, 'Da is stuck fast on de wreck.' An' den I says, 'Da aint got nuffin to eat.' So ober I comes, an' wid a basketful of good t'ings from de plantation.\" And he held up the market basket. He was soaked from the rain, and the water ran from his clothing in a stream.  \"Ben, you are a jewel!\" burst out Marion and patted his wet coat-sleeve affectionately.  At this the old negro grinned broadly. He had always been a privileged character on the Ruthven plantation,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20437"],["title","The Frog Prince and Other Stories (#1)"],["body","the share she had had in their preservation.  [Illustration]  But the good Fairy protected them, and after floating at sea for seven days they were picked up by a Corsair. He was so struck by their beauty that he altered his course, and took them home to his wife, who had no children. She was transported with joy when he placed them in her hands. They admired together the wonderful stars, the chains of gold that could not be taken off their necks, and their long ringlets. Much greater was the woman's astonishment when she combed them, for at every instant there rolled out of their hair pearls, rubies, diamonds, and emeralds. She told her husband of it, who was not less surprised than herself.  \"I am very tired,\" said he, \"of a Corsair's life, and if the locks of those little children continue to supply us with such treasures, I will give up roaming the seas.\" The Corsair's wife, whose name was Corsine, was enchanted at this, and loved the four infants so much the more for it. She named the Princess, Belle-Etoile, her eldest brother, Petit-Soleil, the second, Heureux, and the son of Brunette, Cheri.  As they grew older, the Corsair applied himself seriously to their education, as he felt convinced there was some great mystery attached to their birth.  The Corsair and his wife had never told the story of the four children, who passed for their own. They were exceedingly united, but Prince Cheri entertained for Princess Belle-Etoile a greater affection than the other two. The moment she expressed a wish for anything, he would attempt even impossibilities to gratify her.  One day Belle-Etoile overheard the Corsair and his wife talking. \"When I fell in with them,\" said the Corsair, \"I saw nothing that could give me any idea of their birth.\" \"I suspect,\" said Corsine, \"that Cheri is not their brother, he has neither star nor neck-chain.\" Belle-Etoile immediately ran and told this to the three Princes, who resolved to speak to the Corsair and his wife, and ask them to let them set out to discover the secret of their birth. After some remonstrance they gained their consent. A beautiful vessel was prepared, and the young Princess and the three Princes set out. They determined to sail to the very spot where the Corsair had found them, and made preparations for a grand sacrifice to the fairies, for their protection and guidance. They were about to immolate a turtle-dove, but the Princess saved its life, and let it fly. At this moment a syren issued from the water, and said, \"Cease your anxiety, let your vessel go where it will; land where it stops.\" The vessel now sailed more quickly. Suddenly they came in sight of a city so beautiful that they were anxious their vessel should enter the port. Their wishes were accomplished; they landed, and the shore in a moment was crowded with people, who had observed the magnificence of their ship. They ran and told the King the news, and as the grand terrace of the Palace looked out upon the sea-shore, he speedily repaired thither. The Princes, hearing the people say, \"There is the King,\" looked up, and made a profound obeisance. He looked earnestly at them, and was as much charmed by the Princess's beauty, as by the handsome mien of the young Princes. He ordered his equerry to offer them his protection, and everything that they might require.  [Illustration]  The King was so interested about these four children, that he went into the chamber of the Queen, his mother, to tell her of the wonderful stars which shone upon their foreheads, and everything that he admired in them. She was thunderstruck at it, and was terribly afraid that Feintise had betrayed her, and sent her secretary to enquire about them. What he told her of their ages confirmed her suspicions. She sent for Feintise, and threatened to kill her. Feintise, half dead with terror, confessed all; but promised, if she spared her, that she would still find means to do away with them. The Queen was appeased; and, indeed, old Feintise did all she could for her own sake. Taking a guitar, she went and sat down opposite the Princess's window, and sang a song which Belle-Etoile thought so pretty that she invited her into her chamber. \"My fair child,\" said Feintise, \"Heaven has made you very lovely, but you yet want one thing--the dancing-water. If I had possessed it, you would not have seen a white hair upon my head, nor a wrinkle on my face. Alas! I knew this secret too late; my charms had already faded.\" \"But where shall I find this dancing-water?\" asked Belle-Etoile. \"It is in the luminous forest,\" said Feintise. \"You have three brothers; does not any one of them love you sufficiently to go and fetch some?\" \"My brothers all love me,\" said the Princess, \"but there is one of them who would not refuse me anything.\" The perfidious old woman retired, delighted at having been so successful. The Princes, returning from the chase, found Belle-Etoile engrossed by the advice of Feintise. Her anxiety about it was so apparent, that Cheri, who thought of nothing but pleasing her, soon found out the cause of it, and, in spite of her entreaties, he mounted his white horse, and set out in search of the dancing-water. When supper-time arrived, and the Princess did not see her brother Cheri, she could neither eat nor drink; and desired he might be sought for everywhere, and sent messengers to find him and bring him back.  [Illustration]  The wicked Feintise was very anxious to know the result of her advice; and when she heard that Cheri had already set out, she was delighted, and reported to the Queen-Mother all that had passed. \"I admit, Madam,\" said she, \"that I can no longer doubt that they are the same four children: but one of the Princes is already gone to seek the dancing-water, and will no doubt perish in the attempt, and I shall find similar means to do away with all of them.\"  The plan she had adopted with regard to Prince Cheri was one of the most certain, for the dancing-water was not easily to be obtained; it was so notorious from the misfortunes which occurred to all who sought it, that every one knew the road to it. He was eight days without taking any repose but in the woods. At the end of this period he began to suffer very much from the heat; but it was not the heat of the sun, and he did not know the cause of it, until from the top of a mountain he perceived the luminous forest; all the trees were burning without being consumed, and casting out flames to such a distance that the country around was a dry desert.  At this terrible scene he descended, and more than once gave himself up for lost. As he approached this great fire he was ready to die with thirst; and perceiving a spring falling into a marble basin, he alighted from his horse, approached it, and stooped to take up some water in the little golden vase which he had brought with him, when he saw a turtle-dove drowning in the fountain. Cheri took pity on it, and saved it. \"My Lord Cheri,\" she said, \"I am not ungrateful; I can guide you to the dancing-water, which, without me, you could never obtain, as it rises in the middle of the forest, and can only be reached by going underground.\" The Dove then flew away, and summoned a number of foxes, badgers, moles, snails, ants, and all sorts of creatures that burrow in the earth. Cheri got off his horse at the entrance of the subterranean passage they made for him, and groped his way after the kind Dove, which safely conducted him to the fountain. The Prince filled his golden vase; and returned the same way he came.  He found Belle-Etoile sorrowfully seated under some trees, but when she saw him she was so pleased that she scarcely knew how to welcome him.  Old Feintise learned from her spies that Cheri had returned, and that the Princess, having washed her face with the dancing-water, had become more lovely than ever. Finding this, she lost no time in artfully making the Princess sigh for the wonderful singing-apple. Prince Cheri again found her unhappy, and again found out the cause, and once more set out on his white horse, leaving a letter for Belle-Etoile.  [Illustration]  In the meanwhile, the King did not forget the lovely children, and reproached them for never going to the Palace. They excused themselves by saying that their brother's absence prevented them.  Prince Cheri at break of day perceived a handsome young man, from whom he learned where the singing-apple was to be found: but after travelling some time without seeing any sign of it, he saw a poor turtle-dove fall at his feet almost dead. He took pity on it, and restored it, when it said, \"Good-day, handsome Cheri, you are destined to save my life, and I to do you signal service. You are come to seek for the singing-apple: it is guarded by a terrible dragon.\" The Dove then led him to a place where he found a suit of armour, all of glass: and by her advice he put it on, and boldly went to meet the dragon. The two-headed monster came bounding along, fire issuing from his throat; but when he saw his alarming figure multiplied in the Prince's mirrors he was frightened in his turn. He stopped, and looking fiercely at the Prince, apparently laden with dragons, he took flight and threw himself into a deep chasm. The Prince then found the tree, which was surrounded with human bones, and breaking off an apple, prepared to return to the Princess. She had never slept during his absence, and ran to meet him eagerly.  When the wicked Feintise heard the sweet singing of the apple, her grief was excessive, for instead of doing harm to these lovely children, she only did them good by her perfidious counsels. She allowed some days to pass by without showing herself; and then once more made the Princess unhappy by saying that the dancing-water and the singing-apple were useless without the little green bird that tells everything.  Cheri again set out, and after some trouble learnt that this bird was to be found on the top of a frightful rock, in a frozen climate. At length,"]]]
