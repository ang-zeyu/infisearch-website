Now it is overrun by Cook's tourists in bicycle costumes, irreverent, chattering, idle, and foolish. Even Wagner has grown gray and the _Ring_ sounded antique to me, so strong were the disturbing influences of my environment.  The bad singing by ancient Teutons--for the most part--was to blame for this. Certainly when Walhall had succumbed to the flames and the primordial Ash-Tree sunk in the lapping waters of the treacherous Rhine, I felt that the end of the universe was at hand and it was with a sob I saw outside in the soft, summer-sky, riding gallantly in the blue, the full moon. It was the only young thing in the world at that moment, this burnt-out servant planet of ours, and I gazed at it long and fondly, for it recalled the romance of my student years, my love of Schumann's poetic music and other illusions of a vanished past. In a word, I had again surrendered to the sentimental spell of Germany, Germany by night, and with my heart full I descended from the terrace, walked slowly down the arbored avenue to Sammett's garden and there sat, mused and--smoked my Yankee pipe. I realize that I am, indeed, an old man ready for that shelf the youngsters provide for the superannuated and those who disagree with them.  I had all but forgotten the performances. They were, as I declared at the outset, far from perfect, far from satisfactory. The _Ring_ was depressing. Rosa Sucher, who visited us some years ago, was a flabby _Sieglinde_. The _Siegmund_, Herr Burgstalles, a lanky, awkward young fellow from over the hills somewhere. He was sad. Ernst Kraus, an old acquaintance, was a familiar _Siegfried_. Demeter Popovici you remember with Damrosch, also Hans Greuer. Van Rooy's _Wotan_ was supreme. It was the one pleasant memory of Bayreuth, that and the moon. Gadski was not an ideal _Eva_ in _Meistersinger_, while Demuth was an excellent _Hans Sachs_. The _Brünnhilde_ was Ellen Gulbranson, a Scandinavian. She was an heroic icicle that Wagner himself could not melt. Schumann-Heink, as _Magdalene_ in _Meistersinger_, was simply grotesque. Van Rooy's _Walther_ I missed. Hans Richter conducted my favorite of the Wagner music dramas, the touching and pathetic Nuremberg romance, and, to my surprise, went to sleep over the _tempi_. He has the technique of the conductor, but the elbow-grease was missing. He too is old, but better one aged Richter than a caveful of spry Siegfried Wagners!  I shan't bother you any more as to details. Bayreuth is full of ghosts--the very trees on the terrace whisper the names of Liszt and Wagner--but Madame Cosima is running the establishment for all there is in it financially--excuse my slang--and so Bayreuth is deteriorating. I saw her, Liszt's daughter, von Bülow, and Wagner's wife--or rather widow--and her gaunt frame, strong if angular features, gave me the sight of another ghost from the past. Ghosts, ghosts, the world is getting old and weary, and astride of it just now is the pessimist Nietzsche, who, disguised as a herculean boy, is deceiving his worshippers with the belief that he is young and a preacher of the joyful doctrines of youth. Be not deceived, he is but another veiled prophet. His mask is that of a grinning skeleton, his words are bitter with death and deceit.  I stopped over at Nuremberg and at a chamber concert heard Schubert's quintet for piano and strings, _Die Forelle_--and although I am no trout fisher, the sweet, boyish loquacity, the pure music made my heart glad and I wept.     III  THE WAGNER CRAZE   The new century is at hand--I am not one of those chronologically stupid persons who believes that we are now in it--and tottering as I am on its brink, the brink of my grave, and of all born during 1900, it might prove interesting as well as profitable for me to review my musical past. I hear the young folks cry aloud: \"Here comes that garrulous old chap again with his car-load of musty reminiscences! Even if Old Fogy did study with Hummel, is that any reason why we should be bored by the fact? How can a skeleton in the closet tell us anything valuable about contemporary music?\"  To this youthful wail--and it is a real one--I can raise no real objection. I am an Old Fogy; but I know it. That marks the difference between other old fogies and myself. Some English wit recently remarked that the sadness of old age in a woman is because her face changes; but the sad part of old age in a man is that his mind does not change. Well, I admit we septuagenarians are set in our ways. We have lived our lives, felt, suffered, rejoiced, and perhaps grown a little tolerant, a little apathetic. The young people call it cynical; yet it is not cynicism--only a large charity for the failings, the shortcomings of others. So what I am about to say in this letter must not be set down as either garrulity or senile cynicism. It is the result of a half-century of close observation, and, young folks, let me tell you that in fifty years much music has gone through the orifices of my ears; many artistic reputations made and lost!  I repeat, I have witnessed the rise and fall of so many musical dynasties; have seen men like Wagner emerge from northern mists and die in the full glory of a reverberating sunset. And I have also remarked that this same Richard the Actor touched his apogee fifteen years ago and more. Already signs are not wanting which show that Wagner and Wagnerism is on the decline. As Swinburne said of Walt Whitman: \"A reformer--but not founder.\" This holds good of Wagner, who closed a period and did not begin a new one. In a word, Wagner was a theater musician, one cursed by a craze for public applause--and shekels--and knowing his public, gave them more operatic music than any Italian who ever wrote for barrel-organ fame. Wagner became popular, the rage; and today his music, grown stale in Germany, is being fervently imitated, nay, burlesqued, by the neo-Italian school. Come, is it not a comical situation, this swapping of themes among the nations, this picking and stealing of styles? And let me tell you that of all the Robber Barons of music, Wagner was the worst. He laid hands on every score, classical or modern, that he got hold of.  But I anticipate; I put the _coda_ before the dog. When _Rienzi_ appeared none of us were deceived. We recognized our Meyerbeer disfigured by clumsy, heavy German treatment. Wagner had been to the opera in Paris and knew his Meyerbeer; but even Wagner could not distance Meyerbeer. He had not the melodic invention, the orchestral tact, or the dramatic sense--at that time. Being a born mimicker of other men, a very German in industry, and a great egotist, he began casting about for other models. He soon found one, the greatest of all for his purpose. It was Weber--that same Weber for whose obsequies Wagner wrote some funeral music, not forgetting to use a theme from the _Euryanthe_ overture. Weber was to Wagner a veritable Golconda. From this diamond mine he dug out tons of precious stones; and some of them he used for _The Flying Dutchman_. We all saw then what a parody on Weber was this pretentious opera, with its patches of purple, its stale choruses, its tiresome recitatives. The latter Wagner fondly imagined were but prolonged melodies. Already in his active, but musically-barren brain, theories were seething. \"How to compose operas without music\" might be the title of all his prose theoretical works. Not having a tail, this fox, therefore, solemnly argued that tails were useless appanages. You remember your Æsop! Instead of melodic inspiration, themes were to be used. Instead of broad, flowing, but intelligible themes, a mongrel breed of recitative and _parlando_ was to take their place.  It was all very clever, I grant you, for it threw dust in the public eye--and the public likes to have its eyes dusted, especially if the dust is fine and flattering. Wagner proceeded to make it so by labeling his themes, leading motives. Each one meant something. And the Germans, the vainest race in Europe, rose like catfish to the bait. Wagner, in effect, told them that his music required brains--Aha! said the German, he means _me_; that his music was not cheap, pretty, and sensual, but spiritual, lofty, ideal--Oho! cried the German, he means _me_ again. I am ideal. And so the game went merrily on. Being the greatest egotist that ever lived, Wagner knew that this music could not make its way without a violent polemic, without extraneous advertising aids. So he made a big row; became socialist, agitator, exile. He dragged into his music and the discussion of it, art, politics, literature, philosophy, and religion. It is a well-known fact that this humbugging comedian had written the _Ring of the Nibelungs_ before he absorbed the Schopenhauerian doctrines, and then altered the entire scheme so as to imbue--forsooth!--his music with pessimism.  Nor was there ever such folly, such arrant \"faking\" as this! What has philosophy, religion, politics to do with operatic music? It cannot express any one of them. Wagner, clever charlatan, knew this, so he worked the leading-motive game for all it was worth. Realizing the indefinite nature of music, he gave to his themes--most of them borrowed without quotation marks--such titles as Love-Death; Presentiment of Death; Cooking motive--in _Siegfried_; Compact theme, etc., etc. The list is a lengthy one. And when taxed with originating all this futile child's-play he denied that he had named his themes. Pray, then, who did? Did von Wolzogen? Did Tappert? They worked directly under his direction, put forth the musical lures and decoys and the ignorant public was easily bamboozled. Simply mention the esoteric, the mysterious omens, signs, dark designs, and magical symbols, and you catch a certain class of weak-minded persons.  Wagner knew this; knew that the theater, with its lights, its scenery, its costumes, orchestra, and vocalizing, was the place to hoodwink the \"cultured\" classes.

When the test is to begin, stop the feed pump and tie a string around the gage glass on the boiler to mark the height of the water level in the boiler. Then start the pump connected to barrel 3. Fill barrels 1 and 2 up to the overflow before the test is started. Then open the valve _V_ on barrel 1 and let the water run into barrel 3 as fast as the feed pump draws water from barrel 3. When barrel 1 is emptied close its valve _V_ and open its valve _A_ so as to refill it.  While barrel 1 is filling empty barrel 2 into barrel 3 in the same way, and continue to fill and empty barrels 1 and 2 alternately. In this way barrel 3 will be kept supplied with water that has been measured in barrels 1 and 2, the net weights of which were found before the test began. Keep a separate tally of the number of times each of the barrels 1 and 2 is emptied into barrel 3. At the end of the test the number of tallies for each barrel multiplied by the weight of the water that barrel will hold will be the weight of water measured in that barrel. The sum of these weights for barrels 1 and 2 will be the weight of water used in the test.  With a three-barrel arrangement like this, water can be weighed rapidly enough to supply 300 boiler horsepower.  Before starting a test make sure that there is no chance for water to leak into or out of the boiler. See that the blow-off is tight, that there is no drip from gage cocks, and that the feed-line connections are tight, so that all the water fed to the boiler will represent accurately the amount evaporated during the test.  If a meter is used instead of the three-barrel method, make absolutely sure that the meter is correct, as the accuracy of the test depends on the accuracy with which the water measurements are made. _After a meter is installed, test it to see that it operates correctly under the plant conditions._  The water level in the boiler should be the same at the end of the test as at the beginning. As the time for stopping the test draws near, therefore, try to bring the conditions the same as at the start. Do not, however, run the feed pump rapidly in the last few minutes for the test in order to obtain the same water level. If there is a slight difference in level, calculate the weight of water it represents and make the necessary correction to the total weight of water fed.   TEMPERATURE OF FEED WATER.  Every plant should have a thermometer on the feed line, so as to find the temperature of the feed water. Preferably, this thermometer should be of the recording type. If such a form of thermometer is used during the test, it is unnecessary to take the feed temperature at stated intervals, as the record will show the varying temperatures, and so the average feed temperature during the test can easily be found.  If there is no thermometer in the feed line, take the feed-water temperature by means of a thermometer hung in barrel 3 (figure 2) by a hook over the edge of the barrel. Read this thermometer every half hour during the test if the feed-water temperature is fairly uniform; but if it varies considerably, read the thermometer every 15 minutes. The object is to obtain the average feed-water temperature during the test period. Therefore, mark down the temperatures as read at the stated intervals. At the close of the test add the readings and divide their sum by the number of readings and you will have the average temperature of the feed water.   STEAM PRESSURE.  Every boiler is fitted with a steam gage by which the pressure is indicated. It is important that the pressure gage be accurate. What is wanted in a test is the average pressure of the steam in the boiler, therefore, observe the pressure at regular intervals, just as with the feed-water temperature, and mark down these gage readings. The sum of the readings divided by the number of readings taken will be the average steam pressure during the test.  A recording steam gage is best and makes its own readings.   WORKING UP THE TEST.  After the boiler test has been made, so as to find the weight of coal burned, weight of feed water used, feed-water temperature and steam pressure, the efficiency, the horsepower, and the economy must be obtained by calculation from the test results. The process of figuring the desired results from the test data is called \"working up the test.\"  To illustrate the method used in finding the efficiency, etc., suppose that the data obtained from the test are as follows:    Length of test                                       hours      10   Total weight of coal fired                          pounds   5,000   Total weight of water evaporated                       do.  35,000   Average temperature of feed water                       °F     180   Average steam pressure, gage        pounds per square inch     100  The efficiency of any process is always a comparison, or ratio, of the output to the input. In the case of a steam boiler the efficiency is the percentage of the heat supplied in the coal that is usefully employed in making steam. The output of the steam boiler is the heat represented by the quantity of water evaporated by a pound of coal, taking into account the feed temperature and the steam pressure, and input is the amount of heat contained in a pound of the coal used. The efficiency of the boiler is the output divided by the input.  The heat contained in a pound of coal is called the \"calorific value\" or \"heating value\" of the coal. It can be found by taking a fair average sample of the coal used during the test, as explained in connection with weighing the coal, and sending the sample to a chemist, who will make a calorimeter test to determine its heating value.  At the end of the test the sample fuel should be spread out on a clean floor and all lumps broken up, so that no pieces are larger than 2 inches maximum diameter. Then the gross sample should be very thoroughly mixed by shoveling, after which it should be spread out in the form of a square of uniform depth and quartered down until a final average sample is obtained for shipment to a competent chemist, experienced in fuel analysis. (See Bureau of Mines Technical Paper No. 133.)  About 2 quarts of the chemist's sample should be put in air-tight tins or jars for the determination of moisture; the balance of the sample (the total weight of which should be from 10 to 50 pounds, depending on the total weight of coal used in the test) may be packed in a wooden box lined with paper to prevent splinters from mingling with the sample. A duplicate coal sample should be kept at the plant to be used in case of loss of the sample sent to the chemist.  The Bureau of Mines has published a bulletin or pamphlet giving the analyses and heating values of the various kinds and grades of coal from all parts of the United States. (Bureau of Mines Bulletin No. 22.) This bulletin can be used to learn the approximate heating value of the coal. Simply find out what district the coal used in the test came from, and its grade, and then refer to the bulletin to obtain the heating value of the coal. If a chemist can be obtained to make a heat test, however, it is better to use the heating value he determines.  Suppose that during the test the coal used was run-of-mine bituminous having a heating value of 13,500 B. t. u. Every pound of coal fired, then, carried into the furnace 13,500 heat units, and this value therefore is the _input_ to be used in calculating the boiler efficiency.  During the test 5,000 pounds of coal was fired and 35,000 pounds of water was fed and evaporated. This means that 35,000 ÷ 5,000 = 7 pounds of water was evaporated per pound of coal burned. This is the \"actual evaporation,\" and the heat required to evaporate this 7 pounds of water is the output to be used in calculating the efficiency.  Every fireman knows that it takes more coal, and therefore more heat, to make steam with cold feed water than with hot feed water; also, that it is somewhat easier to make steam at a low pressure than at a high pressure. So it is plain that the heat required to evaporate 7 pounds of water into steam depends on two things, namely, (1) the temperature of the feed water and (2) the pressure of the steam in the boiler. From the data of the test, both the average feed-water temperature and the average steam pressure are known, and so it is a simple matter to find out the amount of heat needed to evaporate 7 pounds of water from the average temperature to steam at the average pressure.  A pound of water at 212° F. must have 970.4 B. t. u. added to it to become a pound of steam at 212° F., or zero gage pressure. This value, 970.4 B. t. u., is called the latent heat of steam at atmospheric pressure, or the heat \"from and at 212° F.\" It is the heat required to change a pound of water _from_ 212° F. to steam _at_ 212° F., and is used by engineers as a standard by which to compare the evaporation of different boilers.  In a boiler test the temperature of the feed water is usually something less than 212° F., and the steam pressure is commonly higher than zero, gage. In the test outlined previously, the feed-water temperature was 180° F. and the pressure was 100 pounds per square inch, gage. It must be clear, then, that the amount of heat required to change a pound of water at 180° to steam at 100 pounds gage pressure is not the same as to make a pound of steam from and at 212° F.  To make allowance for the differences in temperature and pressure, the actual evaporation must be multiplied by a number called the \"factor of evaporation.\" The factor of evaporation has a certain value corresponding to every feed-water temperature and boiler pressure, and the values of this factor are given in the accompanying table. Along the top of the table are given the gage pressures of the steam. In the columns at the sides of the table are given the "]]]
