And ever as she rose and sank upon the rolling waves, their swish and thud fell strangely on the ear of one who lay deep down in the recesses of the hull, where--among barrels of pork, and casks of tar, and cans of oil, and coils of rope, and other unsavoury stores--he consorted with rats and mice and an uneasy conscience, in thick darkness.  This was a \"stowaway.\"  He was a sturdy, bright, ruddy little fellow of fourteen. Down in that unwholesome place, with a few ship-biscuits and a bottle of water to keep him alive, he would have looked like a doubled-up overgrown hedgehog if there had been light enough to reveal him.  Thus, with its little world of hopes and fears, its cares and pleasures, and its brave, trembling, trusting, sorrowing, joyful, anxious, reckless hearts, the good ship passed from the shores of Britain, until her sails quivered like a petrel's wings on the horizon, and then vanished into the boundless bosom of the mighty sea.    CHAPTER TWO.  TELLS OF A GHOST AND AN OVERWHELMING DISASTER.  It may seem strange, nevertheless it is true, that ignorance is a misfortune which now and then results in good.  Of course we do not make this remark in commendation of ignorance, but if Baldwin Burr had not been ignorant and densely stupid, Philosopher Jack would not have had the pleasure of instructing him, and the seaman himself would not have enjoyed that close intimacy which frequently subsists between teacher and pupil.  Even Polly Samson derived benefit from Baldwin's want of knowledge, for, being remarkably intelligent for her years, and having been well taught, she took great pleasure in enlightening his darkness.  \"How is it,\" she asked one day, while sitting on the cabin skylight and looking up in the man's rugged countenance, \"how is it that you are so stupid?\"  Burr, who was steering, gave the wheel a turn, looked up at the mast-head, then round the horizon, then down at his questioner with a bland smile, and said--  \"Well now, Miss Polly, d'ee know, that's wot I can't exactly tell. P'r'aps it's 'cause of a nat'ral want of brains, or, maybe, 'cause the brains is too much imbedded in fat--for I'm a fleshy man, as you see-- or, p'r'aps it's 'cause I never went to school, my parients bein' poor, uncommon poor, though remarkably honest.  I've sometimes thought, w'en meditatin' on the subject, that my havin' bin born of a Friday may have had somethin' to do with it.\"  \"Oh, Baldwin,\" said Polly with a little laugh, \"surely you can't believe that.  Father says it's all nonsense about Friday being an unlucky day.\"  \"P'r'aps it is, an' p'r'aps it ain't,\" returned the cautious seaman.  \"I regard your father, my dear, as a deeply learned man, and would give in, if I could, to wotever he says, but facts is facts, and opinions is opinions, you can't change that, nohow you fix it.  Wot's the cap'n's opinions, now, as to ghosts?\"  \"He don't believe in 'em at all,\" was Polly's prompt answer.  \"No more do I, for father knows everything, and he's always right.\"  \"He's a lucky man to have you, Polly, and there's a lucky boy knockin' about the world somewheres lookin' out for you.  A good daughter, it's said, inwariably makes a good wife; which you don't understand just now, but you'll come to in course of time.  Hows'ever, as I wos observin', I've been of the same opinion as your father till two nights ago, when I heard a ghost right under the deck, it seemed to me, blow my hammock, where there's nothin' but ship's stores and rats.\"  \"Heard a ghost!\" exclaimed Polly, with opening eyes.  \"Ay, an' seed 'im too,\" said Burr.  \"Night before yesterday I heer'd 'im as plain as I hear myself.  He wos groanin', an' it's quite impossible that a tar-barrel, or a cask, or a rat, could groan.  The only thing that puzzled me wos that he seemed to snore; more than that he sneezed once or twice.  Now, I never heard it said that a ghost could sleep or catch cold.  Did you, Polly?\"  Polly laughed and said that she never did, and asked eagerly what the ghost was like.  \"It was wery much like an or'nary man of small size,\" said the seaman, \"but it were too dark to make out its face.  I know the figure of every soul in the ship by this time, an' I could swear before a maginstrate, or a bench of bishops, that the ghost is neither one of the crew nor a passenger.\"  \"Why didn't you speak to it?\" asked Polly.  \"So I did speak to it, but it wouldn't answer; then I made a grab at it, but it was as active as a kitten, dodged round the mainmast, flew for'ed on inwisible wings, and went slap down the fore-scuttle, head first, with a crash that would have broke the neck of anything but a ghost.\"  At this interesting point the conversation was interrupted by Edwin Jack, whose turn it was to relieve the man at the wheel.  He nodded to Polly as he came up, took his post, and received the ship's \"course\" from Burr, who thrust his hands into his pockets, and left the quarter-deck.  Edwin was by this time a considerably changed man, although but a few days at sea.  The rough blue trousers, guernsey, and pea-jacket, took as naturally to his strong limbs as if he had been born and bred a sailor; and already some huge blisters, a few scars, and not a little tar, had rendered his hands creditable.  Steering at the time was a mere matter of form, as a dead calm prevailed.  Our philosopher therefore amused himself and Polly with commentaries on the ghost-subject which Burr had raised.  Late that night, when the stars were shining in a cloudless sky, and winking at their reflections in the glassy ocean, the ghost appeared to Edwin Jack.  It was on this wise:  Jack, being one of the watch on deck, went to the port bulwarks near the foremast shrouds, leant over, and, gazing down into the reflected sky, thought sadly of past, present, and future.  Tiring at last of his meditations, he went towards a man who appeared to be skulking under the shadow of the long-boat and remarked that it was a fine night, but the man made no reply.  \"A most enjoyable night, shipmate,\" he said, going closer.  \"I'm glad you think so,\" said the ghost, \"it's anything but enjoyable to _me_.  The state of the weather hasn't much effect, either one way or another, on a fellow who is half-dead with hunger, half-choked with a cold caught among the rats and stores, and half-killed by a tumble down the fore-scuttle, or whatever may be the name of that vile ladder that leads to the regions below.\"  \"Surely,\" exclaimed Jack in surprise, seizing the ghost by the shoulders and looking close into its face, \"I have heard your voice before now, and, eh?--no, I don't know you.\"  \"Yes, Philosopher Jack, you do know me,\" returned the ghost; \"I've had the honour of playing cricket with you on the green, though you've forgotten me, and no wonder, for I've suffered much from bad air and sea-sickness of late.  My name is Walter, more familiarly Watty Wilkins.\"  \"Little Wilkins!\" exclaimed Jack, in surprise, \"well, you _are_ changed; you don't mean to say that you've run away from home?\"  \"That's just what I've done,\" said the poor lad in a tone of despondency; \"but you've no occasion to shake your head at me so solemnly, for, to all appearance, you have run away too.\"  \"No, Wilkins, you are wrong, I have walked away, being my own master, and I have done it openly, though I admit somewhat hastily--\"  Jack was interrupted at that moment by Ben Trench laying a hand on his shoulder.  \"It strikes me,\" he said, in some surprise, \"that I recognise the voice of a townsman--Mister Jack, if I mistake not?\"  \"No, sir,\" replied the philosopher, \"not _Mister_, only Edwin Jack, seaman aboard the _Lively Poll_.  You are right, however, in styling me townsman.  Allow me to introduce you to another townsman, Mr Watty Wilkins, stowaway on board of the same vessel!\"  Trench had not, in the darkness, recognised his friend.  He now seized him by both shoulders, and peering into his face, said--  \"O Watty, Watty, have you really done it?  I had thought better of you.\"  \"I _said_ I would do it, and I've _done_ it,\" returned the little youth somewhat testily; \"and now I want to know what is to be done next.\"  \"Report yourself and take the consequences,\" said Jack, promptly.  This advice being seconded by Ben Trench, Watty Wilkins went aft to the captain, who had just come on deck, touched his cap, and confessed himself.  For some moments the captain spoke not a word, but looked at the young culprit with a portentous frown.  Then, uttering something like a deep bass growl, he ordered the lad to follow him into his private cabin. When there, Captain Samson seated himself on a locker, and with a hand on each knee, glared at his prisoner so long and so fiercely from under his shaggy brows, that Watty, in spite of his recklessness, began to feel uneasy.  \"So, youngster, you've run away?\" he said at length, in deep solemnity.  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Wilkins.  \"And you think yourself a fine clever fellow, no doubt?\"  \"No, sir, I don't,\" said Watty, with much humility.  \"I knew your father, boy,\" continued the captain, assuming a softer and more serious tone, \"and I think he is a good man.\"  \"He is, sir,\" returned the boy promptly.  \"Ay, and he is a kind man; he has been kind to _you_, I think.\"  Watty hung his head.  \"He has fed you, clothed you, educated you since you was a babby; nursed you, maybe, in sickness, and prayed for you, no doubt that God would make you a good, obedient and loving son.\"  The boy's head drooped still lower.  \"And for all this,\" continued the captain, \"you have repaid him by running away.  Now, my lad, as you have made your bed you shall lie on it.  I'll clap your nose to the grindstone, and keep it there. Steward!\"  A smart little man answered to the call.  \"Take this boy for'ed, and teach him to clean up.  Don't spare him.\"  In obedience to this order the steward took little Wilkins forward and introduced him to the cook, who introduced him to the coppers and scrubbing brushes.

They haunt me often in my dreams--though, to say truth, I dream but little, save when good fellowship has led me to run supper into breakfast--they worry me during my studies, which, you know, are frequent though not prolonged; they come between me and the worthy rhapsodist when he is in the middle of the most interesting-- or least wearisome--passage of the poem, and they even intrude on me at the games.  The very last race I ran was lost, only by a few inches, because our recent talk on the future of cats caused a touch of internal laughter which checked my pace at the most critical moment.  You may rest assured that I cannot avoid granting your first request.  What is your second?\"  \"That you promise to visit me in my home in Albion.  You know that it will be impossible for me ever again to re-visit these shores, where I have been so happy.  My father, if he forgives my running away from him, will expect me to help him in the management of his affairs.  But you have nothing particular to detain you here--\"  \"You forget--the old woman,\" interrupted Dromas gravely.  \"What old woman?\" asked Bladud in surprise.  \"My mother!\" returned his friend.  The prince looked a little confused and hastened to apologise.  Dromas' mother was one of those unfortunate people who existed in the olden time as well as in modern days, though perhaps not so numerously.  She was a confirmed invalid, who rarely quitted her house, and was seldom seen by any one save her most intimate friends, so that she was apt to be forgotten--out of sight out of mind, then as now.  \"Forgive me, Dromas--,\" began Bladud, but his friend interrupted him.  \"I cannot forgive when I have nothing to forgive!  Say no more about that.  But, now I come to consider of it, I grant your second request conditionally.  If my mother agrees to accompany me to Albion, you may expect to see me some day or other--perhaps a year or two hence.  You see, since my father and brother were slain in the last fight with our neighbours, I am the only one left to comfort her, so I cannot forsake her.\"  \"Then this will be our final parting,\" returned Bladud, sadly, \"for your mother will never consent to leave home.\"  \"I don't know that,\" returned Dromas with a laugh.  \"The dear old soul is intensely adventurous, like myself, and I do believe would venture on a voyage to the Cassiterides, if the fancy were strong upon her.  You have no idea how powerfully I can work upon her feelings.  I won't say that I can make much impression on her intellect.  Indeed, I have reason to know that she does not believe in intellect except as an unavoidable doorway leading into the feelings.  The fact is, I tried her the other day with the future of cats, and do you know, instead of treating that subject with the gravity it merits, she laughed in my face and called me names--not exactly bad names, such as the gods might object to--but names that were not creditable to the intelligence of her first-born. Now,\" continued Dromas with increasing gravity, \"when I paint to her the beauty of your native land; the splendour of your father's court; the kindliness of your mother, and the exceeding beauty of your sister--fair like yourself, blue-eyed, tall--you said she was tall, I think?\"  \"Yes--rather tall.\"  \"Of course not _quite_ so tall as yourself, say six feet or so, with a slight, feminine beard--no? you shake your head; well, smooth-faced and rosy, immense breadth of shoulders--ah!  I have often pictured to myself that sister of yours--\"  \"Hilloa!\" shouted Captain Arkal in a nautical tone that might almost have been styled modern British in its character.  It was an opportune interruption, for Dromas had been running on with his jesting remarks for the sole purpose of crushing down the feelings that almost unmanned him.  With few but fervently uttered words the final farewells were at last spoken.  The oars were dipped; the vessel shot from the land, swept out upon the blue waves of the Aegean, the sail was hoisted, and thus began the long voyage to the almost unknown islands of the far North-West.  CHAPTER TWO.  TEMPORARY DELAY THROUGH ELEMENTS AND PIRATES.  But it is not our purpose to inflict the entire log of that voyage on our reader, adventurous though the voyage was.  Matter of much greater importance claims our regard.  Still it would be unjust to our voyagers to pass it over in absolute silence.  At the very commencement of it, there occurred one of those incidents to which all voyagers are more or less subject.  A gale arose the very evening of the day on which they left port, which all but swamped the little vessel, and the violence of the wind was so great that their huge sail was split from top to bottom.  In spite of the darkness and the confusion that ensued, Captain Arkal, by his prompt action and skilful management, saved the vessel from immediate destruction.  Fortunately the gale did not last long, and, during the calm that followed, the rent was repaired and the sail re-set.  Then occurred another incident that threatened to cut short the voyage even more disastrously than by swamping.  The sea over which they steered swarmed with pirates at the time we write of, as it continued to swarm during many centuries after. Merchantmen, fully aware of the fact, were in those days also men of war.  They went forth on their voyages fully armed with sword, javelin, and shield, as well as with the simple artillery of the period--bows and arrows, slings and stones.  On the afternoon of the day that followed the gale, the vessel--which her captain and owner had named the _Penelope_ in honour of his wife-- was running before a light breeze, along the coast of one of the islands with which that sea is studded.  Bladud and some of the crew were listening at the time to an account given by a small seaman named Maikar, of a recent adventure on the sea, when a galley about as large as their own was seen to shoot suddenly from the mouth of a cavern in the cliffs in which it had lain concealed. It was double-banked and full of armed men, and was rowed in such a way as to cut in advance of the _Penelope_.  The vigour with which the oars were plied, and the rapidity with which the sail was run up, left no doubt as to the nature of the craft or the intentions of those who manned it.  \"The rascals!\" growled Arkal with a dark frown, \"I more than half expected to find them here.\"  \"Pirates, I suppose?\" said Bladud.  \"Ay--and not much chance of escaping them.  Give another haul on the sail-rope, mate, and pull, men, pull, if you would save your liberty-- for these brutes have no mercy.\"  The sail was tightened up a few inches, and the vessel was put more directly before the wind.  The way in which the slaves bent to the oars showed that the poor fellows fully understood the situation.  For a few minutes Captain Arkal watched the result in stern silence. Then, with an unwonted look and tone of bitterness, he said in a low voice--  \"No--I thought as much.  She sails faster than we do.  Now, friend Bladud, you shall presently have a chance of proving whether your royal blood is better than that of other men.\"  To this remark the prince made no other reply than by a good-natured smile as he took up the bronze helmet which lay beside his sword on the thwart and placed it on his head.  Captain Arkal regarded him with a sort of grim satisfaction as he followed up the action by buckling on his sword.  The sword in question was noteworthy.  It was a single-handed weapon of iron, made in Egypt, to suit the size and strength of its owner, and was large enough to have served as a two-handed sword for most men.  \"You can throw a javelin, no doubt?\" asked the captain, as he watched the young man's leisurely preparations for the expected combat.  \"Yes, I have practised throwing the spear a good deal--both in peace and war.\"  \"Good.  I have got one here that will suit you.  It belonged to my grandfather, who was a stout man, and made powerful play with it during a neighbouring tribe's raid--when I was a baby--to the discomfort, I have been told, and surprise of his foes.  I always keep it by me for luck, and have myself used it on occasion, though I prefer a lighter one for ordinary use.  Here it is--a pretty weapon,\" he continued, drawing a javelin of gigantic proportions from under the gunwale and handing it to Bladud.  \"But we must proceed with caution in this matter.  Take off your helmet at present, and try to look frightened if you can.\"  \"I fear me that will be difficult, captain.\"  \"Not in the least.  Look here, nothing is easier when you get used to it.\"  As he spoke Arkal caused his stern visage to relax into a look of such amiable sheepishness that Bladud could not repress a sudden laugh which recalled and intensified the captain's fierce expression instantly.  \"Learn to subdue yourself, young man,\" he muttered sternly.  \"If these pirates hear laughter, do you think they can be made to believe we are afraid of them?\"  \"Forgive me, captain; if you had seen your own face, you would have joined in the laugh.  I will be more careful.  But how do you mean to proceed, and what do you wish me to do?\"  Captain Arkal, who was restored to good-humour by this compliment to his power of expression, as well as by the modesty with which the prince received his rebuke, explained his intentions--in low, earnest tones, however, for they were by that time drawing near to the piratical craft.  Having got well ahead of the _Penelope_, it had backed its sail and lay still, awaiting her coming up.  \"Creep to the bow, Bladud, with your helmet off, and show as little of your bulk as may be.  Show only your head above the bulwarks, and look as miserable as I did just now--more so if you can.  Take your sword, javelin, and shield with you.  I need say no more to a man of war.  Use them when you see your opportunity.\"  Bladud received his orders in silence, and obeyed"]]]
