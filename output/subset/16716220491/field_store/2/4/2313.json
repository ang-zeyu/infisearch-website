I'm just telling you I can't be responsible for her here much longer.\"  \"Has something happened?\" Quillan asked quickly.  \"If you mean has somebody taken another swing at her, no. But she's all wound up to start swinging herself. She isn't going to do much waiting either.\"  Quillan said thoughtfully, \"Hasn't she been that way for quite a while?\"  \"Not like she's been the last few days.\" Mihul hesitated. \"Would it be against security if you told me whether something has happened to her?\"  \"Happened to her?\" Quillan repeated cautiously.  \"To her mind.\"  \"What makes you think so?\"  Mihul frowned at the transmitter.  \"Trigger always had a temper,\" she said. \"She was always obstinate. She was always an individualist and ready to fight for her own rights and anyone else's. But she used to show good sense. She's got one of the highest I.Q.s we ever processed through this place. The way she's acting now doesn't look too rational.\"  \"How would she have acted earlier?\" Quillan asked.  Mihul considered. \"She would have been very annoyed with Commissioner Tate,\" she said. \"I don't blame her for that--I'd be, too, in the circumstances. When he got back, she'd have wanted a reasonable explanation for what has been going on. If she didn't get one that satisfied her, she'd have quit. But she _would_ have waited till he got back. Why not, after all?\"  \"You don't think she's going to wait now?\"  \"I do not,\" Mihul said. \"She's forwarded him a kind of ultimatum through Plemponi. Communicate-or-else, in effect. Frankly, I wouldn't care to guarantee she'll stay around to hear the answer.\"  \"Hm.... What do you expect she'll do?\"  \"Take off,\" Mihul said. \"One way or the other.\"  \"Ungh,\" Quillan said disgustedly. \"You make it sound like the chick's got built-in space drives. You can stop her, can't you?\"  \"Certainly I can stop her,\" Mihul said. \"If I can lock her in her room and sit on her to make sure she doesn't leave by the window. But 'unobtrusively?' You're the one who stressed she isn't to know she's being watched.\"  \"True,\" Quillan said promptly. \"I spoke like a loon, Mihul.\"  \"True, Major Quillan, sir,\" said Mihul. \"Now try again.\"  The transmitter was silent a few seconds. \"Could you guarantee her for three days?\" he asked.  \"I could not,\" said Mihul. \"I couldn't guarantee her another three hours.\"  \"As bad as that?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mihul. \"As bad as that. She was controlling herself with Plemponi. But I've been observing her in the physical workouts. I've fed it to her as heavy as I could, but there's a limit to what you can do that way. She's kept herself in very good shape.\"  \"One of the best, I've been told,\" said Quillan.  \"Condition, I meant,\" said Mihul. \"Anyway, she's trained down fine right now. Any more of it would just make her edgier. You know how it goes.\"  \"Uh-huh,\" he said. \"Fighter nerves.\"  \"Same deal,\" Mihul agreed.  There was a short pause. \"How about slapping a guard on all Colonial school exits?\" he suggested.  \"Can you send me an army?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then forget it. She was a student here, remember? Last year a bunch of our students smuggled the stuffed restructured mastodon out and left it in the back garden of the mayor of Ceyce, just for laughs. Too many exits. And Trigger was a trickier monkey than most that way, when she felt like it. She'll fade out of here whenever she wants to.\"  \"It's those damn tube portal systems!\" said Quillan, with feeling. \"Most gruesome invention that ever hit the tailing profession.\" He sighed. \"You win, Mihul! The Commissioner isn't in at the moment. But whether he gets in or not, I'll have someone over today to pick her up. Matter of fact, I'll come along myself.\"  \"Good for you, boy!\" Mihul said relievedly. \"Did you get anything out of yesterday's grabbers?\"  \"A little. 'Get her, don't harm her' were their instructions. Otherwise it was like with those other slobs. A hole in the head where the real info should be. But at least we know for sure now that someone is specifically after Argee. The price was kind of interesting.\"  \"What was it?\"  \"Flat half million credits.\"  Mihul whistled. \"Poor Trigger!\"  \"Well, nobody's very likely to earn the money.\"  \"I hope not. She's a good kid. All right, Major. Signing off now.\"  \"Hold on a minute,\" said Quillan. \"You asked a while ago if the girl had gone ta-ta.\"  \"So I did,\" Mihul said, surprised. \"You didn't say. I figured it was against security.\"  \"It probably is,\" Quillan admitted. \"Everything seems to be, right now. I've given up trying to keep up with that. Anyway--I don't know that she has. Neither does the Commissioner. But he's worried. And Argee has a date she doesn't know about with the Psychology Service, four days from now.\"  \"The eggheads?\" Mihul was startled. \"What do they want with her?\"  \"You know,\" Quillan remarked reflectively, \"that's odd! They didn't think to tell me.\"  \"Why are you letting me know?\" Mihul asked.  \"You'll find out, doll,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  The U-League guard leaning against the wall opposite the portal snapped to attention as it opened. Trigger stepped out. He gave her a fine flourish of a salute.  \"Good morning, Miss Farn.\"  \"Morning,\" Trigger said. She flashed him a smile. \"Did the mail get in?\"  \"Just twenty minutes ago.\"  She nodded, smiled again and walked past him to her office. She always got along fine with cops of almost any description, and these League boys were extraordinarily pleasant and polite. They were also, she'd noticed, a remarkably muscled group.  She locked the office door behind her--part of the Plasmoid Project's elaborate security precautions--went over to her mail file and found it empty. Which meant that whatever had come in was purely routine and already being handled by her skeleton office staff. Later in the day she might get a chance to scrawl Ruya Farn's signature on a few dozen letters and checks. Big job! Trigger sat down at her desk.  She brooded there a minute or two, tapping her teeth with her thumbnail. The Honorable Precolonial Commissioner Tate, whatever else might be said of him, undoubtedly was one of the brainiest little characters she'd ever come across. He probably saw some quite valid reason for keeping her here, isolated and uninformed. The question was what the reason could be.  Security.... Trigger wrinkled her nose. Security didn't mean a thing. Everybody and everything associated with the Old Galactic plasmoids had been wrapped up in Federation security measures since the day the plasmoid discovery was announced. And she'd been in the middle of the operations concerning them right along. Why should Holati Tate have turned secretive on her now? When even blabby old Plemponi could contact him.  It was more than a little annoying....  Trigger shrugged, reached into a desk drawer and took out a small solidopic. She set it on the desk and regarded it moodily.  The face of an almost improbably handsome young man looked back at her. Startling dark-blue eyes; a strong chin, curly brown hair. There was a gleam of white teeth behind the quick, warm smile which always awoke a responsive glow in her.  She and Brule Inger had been the nearest thing to engaged for the last two and a half years, ever since Precol sent them out together to its project on Manon Planet. They'd been dating before that, while they were both still attending the Colonial School. But now she was here, perhaps stuck here indefinitely--unless she did something about it--and Brule was on Manon Planet. By the very fastest subspace ships the Manon System was a good nine days away. For the standard Grand Commerce express freighter or the ordinary liner it was a solid two-months' run. Manon was a _long_ way away!  It was almost a month since she'd even heard from Brule. She could make up another personal tape to him today if she felt like it. He would get it in fourteen days or so via a Federation packet. But she'd already sent him three without reply. Brule wasn't at all good at long distance love-making, and she didn't blame him much. She was a little awkward herself when it came to feeding her personal feelings into a tape. And--because of security again--there was very little else she could feed into it. She couldn't even let Brule know just where she was.  She put the solido back in its drawer, reached for one of the bank of buttons on the right side of the desk and pushed it down. A desk panel slid up vertically in front of her, disclosing a news viewer switched to the index of current headlines.  Trigger glanced over the headlines, while a few items dissolved slowly here and there and were replaced by more recent developments. Under the \"Science\" heading a great deal seemed to be going on, as usual, in connection with plasmoid experiments around the Hub.  She dialed in the heading, skimmed through the first item that appeared. Essentially it was a summary of reports on Hubwide rumors that nobody could claim any worthwhile progress in determining what made the Old Galactic plasmoids tick. Which, so far as Trigger knew, was quite true. Other rumors, rather unpleasant ones, were that the five hundred or so scientific groups to whom individual plasmoids had been issued by the Federation's University League actually had gained important information, but were keeping it to themselves.  The summary plowed through a few of the learned opinions and counteropinions most recently obtained, then boiled them down to the statement that a plasmoid might be compared to an engine which appeared to lack nothing but an energy source. Or perhaps more correctly--assuming it might have an as yet unidentified energy source--a starter button. One group claimed "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21530"],["title","The Angel of Terror (#1)"],["body","of a death which had automatically cancelled George Beale's obligations. It needed only that to spur the girl to an action which was as foolish as it was generous. She had written to all the people to whom her father owed money and had assumed full responsibility for debts amounting to hundreds of pounds.  It was the Celt in her that drove her to shoulder the burden which she was ill-equipped to carry, but she had never regretted her impetuous act.  There were a few creditors who, realising what had happened, did not bother her, and there were others....  She earned a fairly good salary on the staff of the _Daily Megaphone_, which made a feature of fashion, but she would have had to have been the recipient of a cabinet minister's emoluments to have met the demands which flowed in upon her a month after she had accepted her father's obligations.  \"Are you going out to-night, miss?\" asked the woman.  Lydia roused herself from her unpleasant thoughts.  \"Yes. I'm making some drawings of the dresses in Curfew's new play. I'll be home somewhere around twelve.\"  Mrs. Morgan was half-way across the room when she turned back.  \"One of these days you'll get out of all your troubles, miss, you see if you don't! I'll bet you'll marry a rich young gentleman.\"  Lydia, sitting on the edge of the table, laughed.  \"You'd lose your money, Mrs. Morgan,\" she said, \"rich young gentlemen only marry poor working girls in the kind of stories I illustrate. If I marry it will probably be a very poor young gentleman who will become an incurable invalid and want nursing. And I shall hate him so much that I can't be happy with him, and pity him so much that I can't run away from him.\"  Mrs. Morgan sniffed her disagreement.  \"There are things that happen----\" she began.  \"Not to me--not miracles, anyway,\" said Lydia, still smiling, \"and I don't know that I want to get married. I've got to pay all these bills first, and by the time they are settled I'll be a grey-haired old lady in a mob cap.\"  Lydia had finished her tea and was standing somewhat scantily attired in the middle of her bedroom, preparing for her theatre engagement, when Mrs. Morgan returned.  \"I forgot to tell you, miss,\" she said, \"there was a gentleman and a lady called.\"  \"A gentleman and a lady? Who were they?\"  \"I don't know, Miss Beale. I was lying down at the time, and the girl answered the door. I gave her strict orders to say that you were out.\"  \"Did they leave any name?\"  \"No, miss. They just asked if Miss Beale lived here, and could they see her.\"  \"H'm!\" said Lydia with a frown. \"I wonder what we owe them!\"  She dismissed the matter from her mind, and thought no more of it until she stopped on her way to the theatre to learn from the office by telephone the number of drawings required.  The chief sub-editor answered her.  \"And, by the way,\" he added, \"there was an inquiry for you at the office to-day--I found a note of it on my desk when I came in to-night. Some old friends of yours who want to see you. Brand told them you were going to do a show at the Erving Theatre to-night, so you'll probably see them.\"  \"Who are they?\" she asked, puzzled.  She had few friends, old or new.  \"I haven't the foggiest idea,\" was the reply.  At the theatre she saw nobody she knew, though she looked round interestedly, nor was she approached in any of the _entr'actes_.  In the row ahead of her, and a little to her right, were two people who regarded her curiously as she entered. The man was about fifty, very dark and bald--the skin of his head was almost copper-coloured, though he was obviously a European, for the eyes which beamed benevolently upon her through powerful spectacles were blue, but so light a blue that by contrast with the mahogany skin of his clean-shaven face, they seemed almost white.  The girl who sat with him was fair, and to Lydia's artistic eye, singularly lovely. Her hair was a mop of fine gold. The colour was natural, Lydia was too sophisticated to make any mistake about that. Her features were regular and flawless. The young artist thought she had never seen so perfect a \"cupid\" mouth in her life. There was something so freshly, fragrantly innocent about the girl that Lydia's heart went out to her, and she could hardly keep her eyes on the stage. The unknown seemed to take almost as much interest in her, for twice Lydia surprised her backward scrutiny. She found herself wondering who she was. The girl was beautifully dressed, and about her neck was a platinum chain that must have hung to her waist--a chain which was broken every few inches by a big emerald.  It required something of an effort of concentration to bring her mind back to the stage and her work. With a book on her knee she sketched the somewhat bizarre costumes which had aroused a mild public interest in the play, and for the moment forgot her entrancing companion.  She came through the vestibule at the end of the performance, and drew her worn cloak more closely about her slender shoulders, for the night was raw, and a sou'westerly wind blew the big wet snowflakes under the protecting glass awning into the lobby itself. The favoured playgoers minced daintily through the slush to their waiting cars, then taxis came into the procession of waiting vehicles, there was a banging of cab doors, a babble of orders to the scurrying attendants, until something like order was evolved from the chaos.  \"Cab, miss?\"  Lydia shook her head. An omnibus would take her to Fleet Street, but two had passed, packed with passengers, and she was beginning to despair, when a particularly handsome taxi pulled up at the kerb.  The driver leant over the shining apron which partially protected him from the weather, and shouted:  \"Is Miss Beale there?\"  The girl started in surprise, taking a step toward the cab.  \"I am Miss Beale,\" she said.  \"Your editor has sent me for you,\" said the man briskly.  The editor of the _Megaphone_ had been guilty of many eccentric acts. He had expressed views on her drawing which she shivered to recall. He had aroused her in the middle of the night to sketch dresses at a fancy dress ball, but never before had he done anything so human as to send a taxi for her. Nevertheless, she would not look at the gift cab too closely, and she stepped into the warm interior.  The windows were veiled with the snow and the sleet which had been falling all the time she had been in the theatre. She saw blurred lights flash past, and realised that the taxi was going at a good pace. She rubbed the windows and tried to look out after a while. Then she endeavoured to lower one, but without success. Suddenly she jumped up and tapped furiously at the window to attract the driver's attention. There was no mistaking the fact that they were crossing a bridge and it was not necessary to cross a bridge to reach Fleet Street.  If the driver heard he took no notice. The speed of the car increased. She tapped at the window again furiously. She was not afraid, but she was angry. Presently fear came. It was when she tried to open the door, and found that it was fastened from the outside, that she struck a match to discover that the windows had been screwed tight--the edge of the hole where the screw had gone in was rawly new, and the screw's head was bright and shining.  She had no umbrella--she never carried one to the theatre--and nothing more substantial in the shape of a weapon than a fountain pen. She could smash the windows with her foot. She sat back in the seat, and discovered that it was not so easy an operation as she had thought. She hesitated even to make the attempt; and then the panic sense left her, and she was her own calm self again. She was not being abducted. These things did not happen in the twentieth century, except in sensational books. She frowned. She had said almost the same thing to somebody that day--to Mrs. Morgan, who had hinted at a romantic marriage. Of course, nothing was wrong. The driver had called her by name. Probably the editor wanted to see her at his home, he lived somewhere in South London, she remembered. That would explain everything. And yet her instinct told her that something unusual was happening, that some unpleasant experience was imminent.  She tried to put the thought out of her mind, but it was too vivid, too insistent.  Again she tried the door, and then, conscious of a faint reflected glow on the cloth-lined roof of the cab, she looked backward through the peep-hole. She saw two great motor-car lamps within a few yards of the cab. A car was following, she glimpsed the outline of it as they ran past a street standard.  They were in one of the roads of the outer suburbs. Looking through the window over the driver's shoulder she saw trees on one side of the road, and a long grey fence. It was while she was so looking that the car behind shot suddenly past and ahead, and she saw its tail lights moving away with a pang of hopelessness. Then, before she realised what had happened, the big car ahead slowed and swung sideways, blocking the road, and the cab came to a jerky stop that flung her against the window. She saw two figures in the dim light of the taxi's head lamps, heard somebody speak, and the door was jerked open.  \"Will you step out, Miss Beale,\" said a pleasant voice, and though her legs seemed queerly weak, she obliged. The second man was standing by the side of the driver. He wore a long raincoat, the collar of which was turned up to the tip of his nose.  \"You may go back to your friends and tell them that Miss Beale is in good hands,\" he was saying. \"You may also burn a candle or two before your favourite saint, in thanksgiving that you are alive.\"  \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said the driver sulkily. \"I'm taking this young lady to her office.\"  \"Since when has the _Daily Megaphone_ been published in the ghastly suburbs?\" asked the other politely.  He saw the girl, and raised his hat.  \"Come along, Miss Beale,\" he said. \"I promise you a"]]]
