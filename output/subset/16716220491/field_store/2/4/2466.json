It's too soft here entirely.\"  \"I'm sticking to my side of the road, just as I was expected to do,\" said Jack grimly.  The _Yellow Streak_ disappeared over the first rise, and for a few seconds was lost to view. But then the _Blue Moon_ came along, and beyond this rise found going somewhat easier. Slowly but surely they crawled up behind the other bobsled.  \"Keep to your side of the road, Glutts!\" yelled Jack, in a second warning. \"If you don't, there'll be trouble.\"  \"And you'll get the worst of it,\" added Randy.  \"I know what I'm doing,\" retorted Glutts. He had found the snow somewhat soft on his side of the road, and was now running near the center, and occasionally crowding to Jack's side.  \"We'll run into 'em sure!\" came from Spouter Powell in alarm. \"Look out, Jack!\"  \"Look out!\" echoed Fred.  \"Over on your own side, or we'll smash you, Glutts!\" yelled Jack, for the _Blue Moon_ had suddenly found going much easier and was forging forward rapidly. \"Get out of the way!\"  The call was so peremptory that Glutts felt bound to obey. He swerved to his side of the road, and with not a second to spare, for almost instantly the _Blue Moon_ shot past and continued down the slope toward the lake.  \"We win! we win!\" yelled Andy gayly.  \"But the _Yellow Streak_ is just behind us!\" cried Spouter, looking back. \"Here they come!\"  \"Yes, and on our side of the road, too!\" cried Fred, in alarm. He turned his head still further around. \"Glutts, get to your own side!\"  \"Aw, dry up!\" cried the other cadet, in disgust. \"You don't have to act as if you owned the whole road.\"  \"You know the rules of the race,\" flung back Fred.  Crossing the highway which skirted the lake was not so easy, and beyond this the snow was rather deep, and consequently the speed of the _Blue Moon_ was slackened. The _Yellow Streak_ came dangerously close, and then Bill Glutts seemed to lose his head completely. He slued around to his own side of the road, but made such a short turn that in a twinkling the long bobsled was upset and the occupants hurled in all directions.  \"There they go! They are upset!\" yelled Fred. And then he lost sight of those left behind as the _Blue Moon_ shot out on the surface of the lake and beyond the mark set for the end of the race.  \"We win! we win!\" cried Andy, leaping from the bobsled, and in the exuberance of his spirits he turned a handspring in the snow.  \"What happened to the other sled?\" asked Jack, who had been so busy steering the _Blue Moon_ he had paid little attention to what had been going on behind.  \"They had a spill,\" answered Fred. \"But before they took it they came pretty close to running into us.\"  \"It was up to them to keep to their side of the road,\" said Gif Garrison. \"Why, we might have had a terrible accident if they had run into us!\"  There were about a dozen boys on the lake who had witnessed the finish of the race, and these, along with those who had come down on the _Blue Moon_, now turned back to see what had happened to the Glutts party. They found the cadets who had been spilled picking themselves up and brushing the snow from their garments. One was nursing a bruised ankle, and another a bruised elbow, while Bill Glutts was wiping some blood from a scratch on his chin.  \"Well, we won the race,\" said Jack briefly. He had no desire to crow over his opponents.  \"Huh! you didn't win it fairly,\" growled Glutts, glaring at him.  \"Didn't win it fairly!\" exclaimed Jack. \"What do you mean by that?\"  \"I mean you got in our way so we couldn't get past you--that's what I mean!\" growled the other.  \"That is false, Glutts, and you know it,\" retorted the oldest Rover boy.  \"See here, Jack Rover! you can't talk to me in that fashion,\" roared Bill Glutts. He had been in a more or less bad humor all the afternoon, and the defeat had not improved his temper. \"I say you got in my way, and that is why I lost the race.\"  \"And I say your statement isn't true,\" returned Jack sturdily.  \"It is true! And I won't let you or anybody else say any different,\" said Bill Glutts. And then, in sudden passion, he stepped forward and gave Jack a shove which sent the oldest Rover boy flat on his back in a snowbank.     CHAPTER II  ABOUT THE ROVERS   The attack upon Jack Rover was so unexpected that he had no chance to save himself from going down into the snowbank. He went down so hard and the snow was so soft that for the moment he was almost covered and had to flounder around quite some to regain his feet.  \"See here, Bill Glutts! what do you mean by attacking my cousin?\" cried Randy, leaping forward and catching the bully by the arm.  \"He had no right to talk to me the way he did,\" retorted Glutts. \"Let go of me!\" and he shook himself free.  \"What Jack said was true,\" put in Fred quickly. \"I was on the back of our bobsled and watched you nearly all the time. You came over on our side of the road at least three different times.\"  By this time half a dozen of the cadets were speaking at once, Carncross and several others upholding Bill Glutts. In the midst of the discussion Jack managed to regain his feet, and, leaping forward, he caught Bill Glutts firmly by both wrists.  \"Glutts, you listen to me,\" said he sternly, looking the bully in the eyes. \"If I wasn't an officer at the Hall, I'd give you a sound thrashing for what you just did. As it is, I expect you to apologize or else take the consequences.\"  \"Huh! I suppose you mean by that you'll play sissy and report me,\" said the bully.  \"No, I won't report you, but I'll see to it that you get what is coming to you,\" answered Jack.  \"Knowing he is an officer and can't fight you, you took a mean advantage of Jack,\" broke in Gif Garrison. \"You ought to be thrashed for it, Glutts.\"  \"I don't think Bill meant to shove him down into the snow,\" put in Codfish, somewhat timidly.  \"He did mean to do it!\" said Jack quickly. \"And he'll either apologize for his actions or he'll take the consequences.\"  \"Well, I'll take the consequences, whatever they are,\" retorted Bill Glutts, with a sickly grin. \"I know that race wasn't a fair one. Come on, fellows, let's get back to the Hall, it's almost supper time,\" and with that he trudged away, he and his cronies pulling the _Yellow Streak_ behind them.  \"He sure is one sweet-tempered fellow,\" was Spouter's comment.  \"Jack, why didn't you pitch into him, anyway?\" questioned Andy anxiously.  \"I didn't have to,\" returned Jack briefly. \"Just the same, I won't forget the way he has acted. If it wasn't that I am captain of Company C, and am expected not to fight, I'd have given him the thrashing of his life.\"  To the many young folks who have read the former volumes in this series, the Rover boys will not need an introduction. But for the benefit of new readers a few words concerning my characters will be necessary.  In the first volume, entitled \"The Rover Boys at School,\" I related how three brothers, Dick, Tom, and Sam Rover, were sent to Putnam Hall Military Academy, where they made a great number of friends, including a cadet named Lawrence Colby.  From Putnam Hall the boys went to Brill College, and, after leaving that institution of learning, joined their father in business in New York City, with offices on Wall Street. They organized The Rover Company, of which Dick was president, Tom, secretary and general manager, and Sam, treasurer.  During their cadet days at Putnam Hall the three Rovers had become acquainted with a number of charming girls, including Dora Stanhope and her cousins, Nellie and Grace Laning. When Dick went into business he made Dora Stanhope his life partner, and a short while after this Tom married Nellie Laning and Sam married Grace. The three brothers purchased a fine plot of ground on Riverside Drive overlooking the Hudson River, and there they built three connecting houses, Dick and his wife living in the middle house, with Tom on one side and Sam on the other.  About a year after their marriage Dick and his wife became the proud parents of a little son, who was named John after Mr. Laning. This son was followed by a daughter, named Martha, after her Great-aunt Martha, of Valley Brook Farm. Little Jack, as he was commonly called, was a manly lad with many of the qualities which made his father so successful in life.  It was about this time that Tom and Nellie Rover sprang a great surprise on all the others. This surprise was in the shape of a pair of very lively boy twins, one christened Anderson, after his grandfather, and the other Randolph, after his Great-uncle Randolph of Valley Brook Farm. Andy and Randy, as the twins were always called, were decidedly active lads, taking after their father, \"who was never still a minute,\" to quote Grandpa Rover.  Shortly after the twins were born, Sam and Grace Rover came along with a beautiful girl, named Mary, after Mrs. Laning. Then, a year later, the girl was followed by a sturdy boy, who was called Fred, in honor of Sam Rover's old and well known school chum, Fred Garrison.  Residing so close together, the younger generation of Rovers were brought up very much like one big family. They usually spent their winters in New York City, and during the summers often went out to Valley Brook Farm, where their grandfather, Anderson Rover, still resided with Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha.  When the boys and girls grew old enough they were at first sent to private schools in the Metropolis. But soon the lads, led by Andy and Randy, showed a propensity for \"cutting loose\" that their parents were compelled to hold a consultation.  \"We'll have to send them to some strict boarding school--some military academy,\" said Dick Rover; and so it was decided.  Lawrence Colby, their old Putnam Hall chum, had since that time become a colonel in the state militia and had then opened a military"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22012"],["title","The Rover Boys on a Hunt; or, The Mysterious House in the Woods (#2)"],["body","called Colby Hall. To this institution, Jack, Fred and the twins were sent, as related in detail in the first volume of my second series, entitled \"The Rover Boys at Colby Hall.\"  This military school was located about half a mile from the town of Haven Point on Clearwater Lake, a beautiful sheet of water about two miles long. The school consisted of a large stone building facing the lake. It was a three-storied structure and contained the classrooms and the mess hall, and also dormitories and private rooms for the students. Besides the main building, there was a smaller structure occupied by Colonel Colby and his family and some of the professors, and also an up-to-date gymnasium and boathouses and bathing pavilions.  On arriving at the academy the younger Rovers found several of their friends awaiting them, one of these being Dick Powell, the son of Songbird Powell, a former schoolmate of their fathers. Dick was always called Spouter because of a fondness for long speeches. Another cadet was Gif Garrison, a son of Fred Garrison, after whom Fred Rover had been named. There was also Walter Baxter, a son of Dan Baxter, who, years previous, had been an enemy of the older Rovers, but who had since reformed and who was doing well.  As mentioned, Colby Hall was situated about half a mile from Haven Point. On the opposite side of the town was located Clearwater Hall, a boarding school for girls. During a panic in a moving picture theatre Jack and his cousins became acquainted with a number of these school girls, including Ruth Stevenson, May Powell, Alice Strobell and Annie Larkins. They soon found out that May was Spouter Powell's cousin, and the whole crowd of young people became friends. Later on Mary and Martha Rover became pupils at Clearwater Hall.  Ruth Stevenson had an old Uncle Barney, who in times past had had a bitter quarrel with Ruth's parents. The Rover boys, while out hunting one day, had occasion to save the old man's life. For this the old fellow was exceedingly grateful, and as a result he invited them to spend their winter holidays with him, which they did, as related in \"The Rover Boys on Snowshoe Island.\"  On this island the lads met two of their former enemies, Nappy Martell and Slugger Brown, as well as Asa Lemm, a discharged teacher of Colby Hall. The boys exposed a plot against old Uncle Barney, and in the end caused the old fellow's enemies to leave in disgust.  \"I guess we haven't seen the last of Nappy and Slugger,\" said Jack when he and his cousins had left Snowshoe Island.  And he was right. Nappy and Slugger turned up once more, as related in the volume previous to this, entitled \"The Rover Boys Under Canvas.\" In that volume I told how the cadets went into their annual encampment, this being after a spirited election for officers in which Jack Rover had been elected captain of Company C and Fred had been elected first lieutenant of the same command.  Among the cadets who wished to become a captain was one named Gabe Werner, a great chum at that time of Bill Glutts. Having failed of election, Werner did all he could to make things uncomfortable for the Rovers, and in his actions he was seconded by Glutts. But in the end Werner and Glutts were discovered in some of their nefarious doings, and, becoming alarmed, Gabe Werner left the school camp early in the morning and did not return. Glutts was brought before Captain Dale, the teacher in charge of the camp, and received a stern lecture and was deprived of many liberties he might otherwise have enjoyed. He laid his troubles at the door of the Rovers and vowed that sooner or later he would pay them back for the way he had been treated.  While the Rover boys were at Colby Hall the great war in Europe had opened and our country was now overrun with German spies and sympathizers. During their time at the encampment the boys made several surprising discoveries, and in the end helped the Secret Service officers to capture a hidden German submarine. They also rounded up the fathers of Nappy Martell and Slugger Brown. Mr. Brown and Mr. Martell were sent to prison, while Slugger and Nappy were marched off to a detention camp in the South, and that, for the time being, was the last the Rovers heard of them.  \"Well, one thing is certain--we're well rid of Slugger and Nappy and their fathers,\" remarked Jack, as this news was brought to them.  \"Yes, and I guess we're rid of Gabe Werner too,\" said Fred. \"He seems to have dropped out completely.\" But in his remark concerning Werner the young lieutenant was mistaken. Gabe Werner was destined to turn up in their path unexpectedly and cause them not a little trouble.  When the call for volunteers came, Dick Rover and Sam had lost no time in enlisting. At first Tom Rover had been unable to get away. But now the business in New York City had been left in reliable hands, and all three fathers of the boys were in the trenches in Europe doing their bit for Uncle Sam. They had been in several small engagements, and so far had come through unwounded.  \"But there is no telling if they will come through every time,\" was the way Fred expressed himself anxiously.  \"Right you are,\" answered Jack. \"Do you know, I dread to look at the lists of the killed and wounded in the newspapers for fear I'll see one of their names.\"  \"Oh, if only this awful war was over!\" put in Randy.     CHAPTER III  NEWS OF IMPORTANCE   \"Battalion attention! Shoulder arms! Forward march!\"  Boom! Boom! Boom, boom, boom! The drums beat, and away marched the three companies forming the Colby Hall battalion. They marched around the school building, as was the custom, and then marched into the place, put away their rifles, and entered the mess hall.  The roll call and brief drill and march took place less than half an hour after the encounter on the hill following the finish of the bobsled race. Captain Jack and Lieutenant Fred had lost no time in hurrying back to the school, and their chums had gone with them. Bill Glutts and his cronies had gone ahead, as already stated. And they did not show themselves until the call came to appear on the parade ground.  As captain and lieutenant, Jack and Fred were in rather a delicate position when it came to quarreling with the other cadets. In the past Colonel Colby had laid down the rule that there should be no fighting at the Hall, and this rule was particularly enforced when it came to officers. Now that the master of the military academy had joined the army and gone with the older Rovers to Europe, Captain Dale, who was in general command, was enforcing this rule with more strictness than ever before.  The afternoon spent coasting had given the Rovers and their chums good appetites, and they fell to with gusto over the ample supper provided for them. Unlike many boarding schools, the table at Colby Hall was always a bountiful one, and it is needless to say that the growing cadets always did full justice to everything that was set before them.  \"What are you going to do about Bill Glutts, Jack?\" questioned Fred, after the meal was over and the two were on their way to get several reference books from the school library.  \"I don't know yet,\" was the young captain's answer. \"He ought to have a thrashing, but you know how matters stand.\"  \"Of course. And Jack, we can't think of that with the end of the term so near. You don't want to spoil your record, and neither do I.\"  \"It's a confounded shame that Glutts didn't leave when Gabe Werner went,\" continued the oldest Rover boy. \"They were two of a kind.\"  \"Did you hear what Andy said--that he thought Glutts had a lot of German blood in him?\"  \"That might be. His face looks it, and the name sounds a little that way too.\"  \"Andy and Randy both want to pitch into him,\" continued the young lieutenant.  \"You warn them not to do it--at least, not until this term comes to an end,\" warned Jack. \"They have been cutting up so much since last September that their averages are none too high as it is. They'd be mighty sorry if Captain Dale sent home a bad report about them. It would just about break Aunt Nellie's heart, I'm sure.\"  Having procured the reference books, the two made their way upstairs to the rooms occupied by them. The Rovers had a suite of four rooms, one of which was used as a sitting room and for studying. As they walked through the upper hallway they passed Nick Carncross and Bill Glutts. Glutts looked sourly at them but did not say a word, and they refused to notice the pair.  \"I guess you've got their goat, Bill,\" remarked Carncross, as they passed on. \"That race really belonged to you, and they know it.\"  \"Of course it belonged to me,\" returned Glutts. \"If they hadn't got in my way I'd have won with ease. There isn't a bobsled anywhere around that can beat the _Yellow Streak_.\"  \"I'm glad you shoved him over in the snow, even if he is a captain,\" continued Carncross. \"He's got too big an opinion of himself.\"  \"He only got to be captain by a fluke, Nick. Gabe Werner should have had that office,\" continued Glutts.  \"Is that why Werner left?\" questioned Carncross curiously.  \"Oh, no. He left because he got sick of the discipline around here. He said there was no chance for any fun,\" answered Glutts.  \"Where is he now? Did his folks approve of his leaving school?\"  \"Oh, I guess they didn't care one way or the other. Old man Werner is pretty rich, and he didn't get his money by being educated either. So I guess he doesn't care much for education.\"  \"Does he let Gabe have much spending money?\"  \"Quite a little--but, of course, not as much as Gabe would like to have. You know Gabe is a good deal of a sport.\" Bill Glutts' face lit up with satisfaction. \"I expect we are going to have a bang-up time together during the holidays.\"  \"Then you expect to see him?\"  \"Yes; we're planning a trip together.\"  \"Gee! I'll envy you,\" returned Carncross.  Andy and Randy had not yet come upstairs. Neither could resist the temptation to have a little fun, and after"]]]
