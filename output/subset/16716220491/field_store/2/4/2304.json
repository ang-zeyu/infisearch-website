It will restore your strength faster than any food we can give you.\"  The stranger again murmured his thanks, and soon after the broth was brought, following his host's advice, he fell into a quiet slumber.  \"He'll require a visit from the doctor perhaps, though I hope that he'll do well enough now,\" observed the lieutenant, as he sat at supper with his sister and Ned that evening after he had paid all the attention necessary to his guest.  \"I wonder who he can be?\" observed Miss Sarah.  \"You say he was dressed as a gentleman, and has a considerable amount of property in his possession.\"  \"Your female curiosity will probably be gratified to-morrow, when he is able to give an account of himself,\" replied the lieutenant; \"but it matters very little as far as we are concerned.  I suspect he'll thank us for doing what it was our simple duty to do, and after he has gone his way we shall probably hear no more of him.  Had he been a seaman, without a copper in his pocket, we should have treated him in the same fashion I hope.  Remember, Ned, the meaning of having no respect for persons.  It is not that we are not to respect those above us, but that we are to treat our fellow-creatures alike, without expectation of reward, and to pull a drowning man, whether a lord or an ordinary seaman, out of the water when we can.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  The next morning Ned went off to summon the doctor from the neighbouring town, for their guest still remained in an apparently dangerous state. Several days passed before he was able to rise.  He was evidently, from his conversation and manners, a man of education; but he did not speak of himself, except to mention that his name was Farrance, and that he was on a voyage from the Mediterranean in the \"Champion\" brig, when she had been cast away; and he again also expressed his gratitude to Miss Sarah Pack for the kindness he was receiving, and to the lieutenant and his companions for preserving his life.  He made minute inquiries as to the occurrence, he only remembering that he was clinging to a portion of the wreck after she had struck, when he felt himself washed into the foaming breakers.  He appeared to be interested in Ned, whom he drew into conversation, inquiring particularly what profession he intended to follow.  \"I wish to enter the navy, as my father and uncle did,\" answered Ned; \"but my uncle says that he has no interest, and that I should have little chance of promotion.  Indeed, his means are so limited that I cannot ask him to provide the necessary funds, so I conclude I shall have to go into the merchant service.\"  \"Well, well, you are right in desiring not to be an expense to your uncle.  Every man should endeavour, as far as he can, to depend upon his own exertions; however, you have still some time to think about the matter, and you will, I hope, succeed in whatever profession you follow,\" remarked the stranger.  There was another inmate of the house who appeared to interest him even more than Edward.  A little girl of some ten or twelve years of age--a fair-haired, blue-eyed damsel, with a sweet, gentle expression of countenance, yet full of life and spirits.  Edward had told him that she was not his sister, although he loved her as much as if she were.  The first evening he came into the sitting-room the lieutenant heard him ask her name.  \"I am called Mary,\" she answered; \"Uncle John gave me my name when he first found me.\"  She shortly afterwards left the room.  The stranger watched her as she went out with a look of much surprise.  \"You may be curious to know the meaning of her remark,\" observed Miss Sarah.  \"My brother will tell you how she came into our possession; very thankful I have been to have so sprightly and sweet a young creature under our roof, though at first I confess I felt somewhat anxious when he placed her in my charge.\"  Mr Farrance turned an inquiring glance towards his host.  \"I have but a short yarn to spin about the matter,\" said the lieutenant. \"Some few years ago, after I had quitted the service, an old friend offered me the command of a ship bound on a voyage round the Cape of Good Hope and up the Red Sea.  I was not sorry to obtain employment, and was glad to have the opportunity of making a few pounds, which might assist to keep the pot boiling at home, and help Sally in her housekeeping.  Having touched at the Cape, I was steering for Aden, when we were overtaken by a heavy gale, which pretty severely tried my stout ship.  We were about to make sail in the morning, the wind having abated and the sea gone down, when an object was seen floating a short distance ahead.  On getting nearer, we saw that it was a piece of wreck with a man upon it.  Standing on, I hove the ship to, and having lowered a boat, watched with interest her approach to the raft.  The man was, I made out, a black.  He was holding what looked like a bundle of clothes with one hand, keeping it above the water, which still nearly washed over him.  His bundle contained, I had no doubt, something of value, or he would not have exerted himself as he was doing to preserve it from the sea.  It was of value, and, to my mind, the most valuable thing in creation--a young child, as I discovered when the boat returned with the rescued man, who still held fast to his treasure.  We lifted them both carefully on board.  The black sank exhausted on the deck, making signs to us, however, to take care of the child.  We thought that it was his own, but when we got a look at its countenance, greatly to our surprise we found that it was as fair as any European.  How the man had managed to preserve it during the heavy sea which had been running for some hours seemed a miracle.  We carried them both into my cabin.  The little girl, you may be sure, had plenty of nurses.  She looked frightened enough at seeing us, but appeared wonderfully little the worse for the exposure to which she had been subjected; indeed, although the shawl which had wrapped her was wet, the water was warm and the black must have contrived to keep her head well out of the sea, as her face and hair were only moistened by the spray.  \"Though she seemed almost too young to speak, she uttered several words in a lingo none of us understood.  In a very short time after we had given her some food, and she had had a quiet sleep, she seemed more happy and smiled, and lifted up her face to kiss me when I bent over her.  I thanked Heaven that I had been the means of saving the little darling.  \"It was not until evening that the black, who was pretty well exhausted by his exertions, awoke.  I was disappointed, I can tell you, when on speaking to him, he answered in a language of which I could not comprehend a word.  We tried him in all sorts of ways, and he made a variety of signs, but we could not comprehend the meaning he intended to convey.  In appearance he greatly resembled the slaves I had seen at Zanzibar, on board the Arab dhows, though better-looking.  Like most of them, he had but a clout round his waist, and his woolly hair was cropped close.  Still he evidently did not lack intelligence.  It was very tantalising to find that we could get no information out of him. The little girl was equally unable to give an account of herself, though I fancied that she understood us when we spoke English, but she could not reply intelligibly.  \"I treated the black as he deserved, for the brave way in which he had saved the child, and he showed that he was grateful for such kindness as I bestowed upon him.  \"As to the little girl, though I made inquiries at every place I touched at, I could get no information by which I could even guess where she had come from or who she was.  From her ways and tone of voice I felt sure, however, that she was of gentle birth.  The black seemed mortally afraid of the Arabs, and kept below when any came on board or any dhows hove in sight; indeed it was some time before we could make him understand that he was safe with us, and that no one would venture to take him away by force.  He soon became a great favourite with the men, who gave him the name of Tom, in addition to the one by which he called himself, which sounded like Baraka, and Tom Baraka he has been ever since.  In a short time he picked up a few words of English, with which he managed to make himself understood; but it was not until we were on the voyage home that he was able to give me an idea how he and the little girl came to be on the piece of wreck from which we rescued him.  I would call him in, and let him give his own history; but I think I can make you understand the account better if I give it in ordinary English, for I took no little trouble during several months to get the truth out of him, anxious as he was to give the information I required.  His vocabulary being somewhat limited, he accompanied his words by signs, often of so curious a description that it was with difficulty my officers and I could restrain ourselves from bursting into fits of laughter, and yet his account was sad enough.  \"I placed before him the best map I possessed of the part of Africa from which I calculated he came, and explained to him the rivers and lakes marked upon it.  He shook his head, as if he could make nothing of it, but at last fixed on a spot some way in the interior.  \"`There!' he said, making a wide circle with his finger, `There abouts was my home.  By the banks of a river which fell into a lake my people and I were happy in our way, we cultivated our fields and tended our cattle, and had abundance of food without thinking of the future.  We heard, it is true, that the cruel men who come across from the big sea had carried off not a few of the inhabitants of other districts; but it was a long, long distance away, and we hoped they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2148"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 2 (#1)"],["body","self. I fancy that I have investigated       every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible       that the paper can be concealed.”        “But is it not possible,” I suggested, “that although the letter       may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he       may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?”        “This is barely possible,” said Dupin. “The present peculiar       condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues       in which D—— is known to be involved, would render the instant       availability of the document—its susceptibility of being produced       at a moment’s notice—a point of nearly equal importance with its       possession.”        “Its susceptibility of being produced?” said I.        “That is to say, of being destroyed,” said Dupin.        “True,” I observed; “the paper is clearly then upon the premises.       As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider       that as out of the question.”        “Entirely,” said the Prefect. “He has been twice waylaid, as if       by footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own       inspection.”        “You might have spared yourself this trouble,” said Dupin. “D——,       I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have       anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course.”        “Not altogether a fool,” said G., “but then he’s a poet, which I       take to be only one remove from a fool.”        “True,” said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his       meerschaum, “although I have been guilty of certain doggrel       myself.”        “Suppose you detail,” said I, “the particulars of your search.”        “Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched _everywhere_.       I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire       building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to       each. We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We       opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a       properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is       impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a ‘secret’ drawer to       escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There       is a certain amount of bulk—of space—to be accounted for in every       cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line       could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The       cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me       employ. From the tables we removed the tops.”        “Why so?”        “Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece       of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an       article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within       the cavity, and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of       bedposts are employed in the same way.”        “But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?” I asked.        “By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient       wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we       were obliged to proceed without noise.”        “But you could not have removed—you could not have taken to       pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been       possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter       may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in       shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it       might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did       not take to pieces all the chairs?”        “Certainly not; but we did better—we examined the rungs of every       chair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every       description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful       microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we       should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of       gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple.       Any disorder in the glueing—any unusual gaping in the       joints—would have sufficed to insure detection.”        “I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the       plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as       the curtains and carpets.”        “That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every       particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house       itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we       numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each       individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two       houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.”        “The two houses adjoining!” I exclaimed; “you must have had a       great deal of trouble.”        “We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!”        “You include the grounds about the houses?”        “All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively       little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and       found it undisturbed.”        “You looked among D——‘s papers, of course, and into the books of       the library?”        “Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only       opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume,       not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the       fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the       thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate       admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of       the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled       with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should       have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the       hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with       the needles.”        “You explored the floors beneath the carpets?”        “Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards       with the microscope.”        “And the paper on the walls?”        “Yes.”        “You looked into the cellars?”        “We did.”        “Then,” I said, “you have been making a miscalculation, and the       letter is not upon the premises, as you suppose.”        “I fear you are right there,” said the Prefect. “And now, Dupin,       what would you advise me to do?”        “To make a thorough re-search of the premises.”        “That is absolutely needless,” replied G——. “I am not more sure       that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.”        “I have no better advice to give you,” said Dupin. “You have, of       course, an accurate description of the letter?”        “Oh yes!”—And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book,       proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and       especially of the external appearance of the missing document.       Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his       departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever       known the good gentleman before.        In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found       us occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and       entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said,—        “Well, but G——, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have       at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as       overreaching the Minister?”        “Confound him, say I—yes; I made the re-examination, however, as       Dupin suggested—but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would       be.”        “How much was the reward offered, did you say?” asked Dupin.        “Why, a very great deal—a very liberal reward—I don’t like to say       how much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn’t       mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any       one who could obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming       of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been       lately doubled. If it were trebled, however, I could do no more       than I have done.”        “Why, yes,” said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his       meerschaum, “I really—think, G——, you have not exerted       yourself—to the utmost in this matter. You might—do a little       more, I think, eh?”        “How?—in what way?”        “Why—puff, puff—you might—puff, puff—employ counsel in the       matter, eh?—puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell       of Abernethy?”        “No; hang Abernethy!”        “To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a       certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this       Abernethy for a medical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an       ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his       case to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual.        “‘We will suppose,’ said the miser, ‘that his symptoms are such       and such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?’        “‘Take!’ said Abernethy, ‘why, take advice, to be sure.’”        “But,” said the Prefect, a little discomposed, “I am perfectly       willing to take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give       fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.”        “In that case,” replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a       check-book, “you may as well fill me up a check for the amount       mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.”        I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely       thunder-stricken. For some minutes he remained speechless and       motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth,       and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then,       apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen,       and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up"]]]
