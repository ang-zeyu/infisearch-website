As the choruses die away, the voice of the entranced Titurel is heard from beneath the altar calling upon Amfortas, his son, to uncover the Grail, that he may find refreshment and life in the blessed vision.  Then follows a terrible struggle in the breast of Amfortas. _He_, sore stricken in sin, yet Guardian of the Grail, guilty among the guiltless, oppressed with pain, bowed down with shame, craving for restoration, overwhelmed with unworthiness, yet chosen to stand and minister before the Lord on behalf of His saints! Pathetic situation, which must in all times repeat itself in the history of the Church. The unworthiness of the minister affects not the validity of his consecrated acts. Yet what agony of mind must many a priest have suffered, himself oppressed with sin and doubt, while dispensing the means of grace, and acting as a minister and steward of the mysteries!  The marvelous piece of self-analysis in which the conscience-stricken king bewails his lot as little admits of description here as the music which embodies his emotion.  At the close of it angel voices seem floating in midair, sighing the mystic words:      \"Durch Mitleid wissend       Der reine Thor,     Harre sein       Den ich erkor.\"      [Wait for my chosen one,     Guileless and innocent,     Pity-enlightened.]  And immediately afterward the voice of Titurel, like one turning restlessly in his sleep, comes up from his living tomb beneath the altar: \"_Uncover the Grail!_\"  With trembling hands the sick king raises himself, and with a great effort staggers toward the shrine--the covering is removed--he takes the crystal cup--he raises it on high--the blood is dark--the light begins to fade in the hall--a mist and dimness come over the scene--we seem to be assisting at a shadowy ceremony in a dream--the big bells are tolling--the heavenly choirs from above the dome, which is now bathed in twilight, are heard: \"_Drink ye all of this!_\" Amfortas raises on high the crystal vase--the knights fall on their knees in prayer. Suddenly a faint tremor of light quivers in the crystal cup--then the blood grows ruby red for a moment. Amfortas waves it to and fro--the knights gaze in ecstatic adoration. Titurel's voice gathers strength in his tomb:                      \"Celestial rapture:     How streams the light upon the face of God!\"  The light fades slowly out of the crystal cup--the miracle is accomplished. The blood again grows dark--the light of common day returns to the halls of Montsalvat, and the knights resume their seats, to find each one his golden goblet filled with wine.  During the sacred repast which follows, the brotherhood join hands and embrace, singing:      \"Blessed are they that believe;     Blessed are they that love!\"  and the refrain is heard again far up in the heights, reechoed by the angelic hosts.         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration: Copyright, 1903, by Pach Bros., N. Y.  THE GREAT HALL OF THE HOLY GRAIL]  I looked round upon the silent audience while these astonishing scenes were passing before me; the whole assembly was motionless--all seemed to be awed by the august spectacle--seemed almost to share in the devout contemplation and trancelike worship of the holy knights. Every thought of the stage had vanished--nothing was further from my own thoughts than play-acting. I was sitting as I should sit at an oratorio, in devout and rapt contemplation. Before my eyes had passed a symbolic vision of prayer and ecstasy, flooding the soul with overpowering thoughts of the divine sacrifice and the mystery of unfathomable love.         *       *       *       *       *  The hall of Montsalvat empties. Gurnemanz strides excitedly up to Parsifal, who stands stupefied with what he has seen--      \"Why standest thou silent?     Knowest thou what thine eyes have seen?\"  The \"guileless one\" shakes his head. \"Nothing but a fool!\" exclaims Gurnemanz, angrily; and, seizing Parsifal by the shoulder, he pushes him roughly out of the hall, with:      \"Be off! look after thy geese,     And henceforth leave our swans in peace.\"  The Grail vision had, then, taught the \"guileless one\" nothing. He could not see his mission--he was as yet unawakened to the deeper life of the spirit; tho blameless and unsullied, he was still the \"natural man.\" Profound truth! that was not first which was spiritual, but that which was natural; before Parsifal wins a spiritual triumph, he must be spiritually tried; his inner life must be deepened and developed, else he can never read aright the message of the Grail.  The life of God in the spirit comes only when the battle for God in the heart has been fought and won.  Fare forth, thou guileless one! thou shalt yet add to the simplicity of the dove the wisdom of the serpent. Thou art innocent because ignorant; but thou shalt be weighed anon in the balance and not be found wanting; and then shalt thou reconquer the holy spear lost in Sin, rewon in Purity and Sacrifice, and be to the frail Amfortas the chosen savior for whom he waits.         *       *       *       *       *  The foregoing events occupied about an hour and a quarter. When the curtain fell the vast audience broke up in silence.  The air outside was cool and balmy. In the distance lay the city of Bayreuth, with the tower of the Alte Schloss and the old church standing up gray against the distant Bavarian hills. All around us lay the pine woods, broken by the lawns and avenues that encircle the theater and embower it in a secluded world of its own--even as the Palace of the Grail was shut off from the profane world. Here, indeed, is truly the Montsalvat of the modern drama--a spot purified and sacred to the highest aims and noblest manifestations of Art.  In about an hour the Spear motive was the signal blown on the wind instruments outside, and I took my seat for the second act.     Act II   A restless, passion-tossed prelude. The \"Grail\" subject distorted, the \"Spear\" motive thrust in discordant, the \"Faith and Love\" theme fluttering like a wounded dove in pain, fierce bursts of passion, wild shocks of uncontrolled misery, mingling with the \"carnal joy\" music of Klingsor's magic garden and the shuddering might of his alchemy.  The great magician, Klingsor, is seen alone in his dungeon palace--harsh contrast to the gorgeous halls of Montsalvat. Here all is built of the live rock, an impenetrable fastness, the home of devilish might and terrible spells.  Klingsor is aware of the coming struggle, and he means to be ready for it. He owns the sacred spear wrested from Amfortis; he even aspires to win the Grail; he knows the \"guileless one\" is on his way to wrest that spear from him. His only hope is in paralyzing the fool by his enchantments as he paralyzed Amfortis, and the same woman will serve his turn.  \"Kundry!\" The time is come, the spells are woven--blue vapors rise, and in the midst of the blue vapors the figure of the still sleeping Kundry is seen. She wakes, trembling violently; she knows she is again under the spell she abhors--the spell to do evil, the mission to corrupt. With a shuddering scream she stands before her tormentor, denying his power, loathing to return to her vile mission, yet returning, as with a bitter cry she vanishes from his presence.  Parsifal has invaded Klingsor's realm; the evil knights have fled before his prowess, wounded and in disorder. Kundry is commissioned to meet the guileless youth in the enchanted garden, and, all other allurements failing, to subdue him by her irresistible fascinations and hand him over to Klingsor.  In a moment the scenery lifts, and a garden of marvelous beauty and extent lies before us. The flowers are all of colossal dimensions--huge roses hang in tangled festoons, the cactus, the lily, the blue-bell, creepers, and orchids of enormous size and dazzling color wave in midair, and climb the aromatic trees.  On a bright hill appears Parsifal, standing bewildered by the light and loveliness around him. Beautiful girls dressed like flowers, and hardly distinguishable from them at first, rush in, bewailing their wounded and disabled knights, but, on seeing Parsifal, fall upon their new prey, and, surrounding him, sing verse after verse of the loveliest ballet music, while trying to embrace him, and quarreling with each other for the privilege.  About that wonderful chorus of flower-girls there was just a suggestive touch of the Rhine maidens' singing. It belonged to the same school of thought and feeling, but was freer, wilder--more considerable, and altogether more complex and wonderful in its changes and in the marvelous confusion in which it breaks up.  The \"guileless one\" resists these charmers, and they are just about to leave him in disgust, when the roses lift on one side, and, stretched on a mossy bank overhung with flowers, appears a woman of unearthly loveliness. It is Kundry transformed, and in the marvelous duet which follows between her and Parsifal, a perfectly new and original type of love duet is struck out--an analysis of character, unique in musical drama--a combination of sentiment and a situation absolutely novel, which could only have been conceived and carried out by a creative genius of the highest order.  First, I note that the once spellbound Kundry is devoted utterly to her task of winning Parsifal. Into this she throws all the intensity of her wild and desperate nature; but in turn she is strangely affected by the spiritual atmosphere of the \"guileless one\"--a feeling comes over her, in the midst of her witchcraft passion, that he is in some way to be her savior too; yet, womanlike, she conceives of her salvation as possible only in union with him.

These visits, these assemblies, and these balls,   Are all inventions of the evil spirit.   You never hear a word of godliness   At them--but idle cackle, nonsense, flimflam.   Our neighbour often comes in for a share,   The talk flies fast, and scandal fills the air;   It makes a sober person's head go round,   At these assemblies, just to hear the sound   Of so much gab, with not a word to say;   And as a learned man remarked one day   Most aptly, 'tis the Tower of Babylon,   Where all, beyond all limit, babble on.   And just to tell you how this point came in ...    (To Cleante)   So! Now the gentlemen must snicker, must he?   Go find fools like yourself to make you laugh   And don't ...    (To Elmire)   Daughter, good-bye; not one word more.   As for this house, I leave the half unsaid;   But I shan't soon set foot in it again,    (Cuffing Flipotte)   Come, you! What makes you dream and stand agape,   Hussy! I'll warm your ears in proper shape!   March, trollop, march!      SCENE II    CLEANTE, DORINE     CLEANTE   I won't escort her down,   For fear she might fall foul of me again;   The good old lady ...    DORINE   Bless us! What a pity   She shouldn't hear the way you speak of her!   She'd surely tell you you're too \"good\" by half,   And that she's not so \"old\" as all that, neither!    CLEANTE   How she got angry with us all for nothing!   And how she seems possessed with her Tartuffe!    DORINE   Her case is nothing, though, beside her son's!   To see him, you would say he's ten times worse!   His conduct in our late unpleasantness [1]   Had won him much esteem, and proved his courage   In service of his king; but now he's like   A man besotted, since he's been so taken   With this Tartuffe. He calls him brother, loves him   A hundred times as much as mother, son,   Daughter, and wife. He tells him all his secrets   And lets him guide his acts, and rule his conscience.   He fondles and embraces him; a sweetheart   Could not, I think, be loved more tenderly;   At table he must have the seat of honour,   While with delight our master sees him eat   As much as six men could; we must give up   The choicest tidbits to him; if he belches,   ('tis a servant speaking) [2]   Master exclaims: \"God bless you!\"--Oh, he dotes   Upon him! he's his universe, his hero;   He's lost in constant admiration, quotes him   On all occasions, takes his trifling acts   For wonders, and his words for oracles.   The fellow knows his dupe, and makes the most on't,   He fools him with a hundred masks of virtue,   Gets money from him all the time by canting,   And takes upon himself to carp at us.   Even his silly coxcomb of a lackey   Makes it his business to instruct us too;   He comes with rolling eyes to preach at us,   And throws away our ribbons, rouge, and patches.   The wretch, the other day, tore up a kerchief   That he had found, pressed in the _Golden Legend_,   Calling it a horrid crime for us to mingle   The devil's finery with holy things.    [Footnote 1: Referring to the rebellion called La Fronde, during the   minority of Louis XIV.]    [Footnote 2: Moliere's note, inserted in the text of all the old   editions. It is a curious illustration of the desire for uniformity   and dignity of style in dramatic verse of the seventeenth century,   that Moliere feels called on to apologize for a touch of realism like   this. Indeed, these lines were even omitted when the play was given.]      SCENE III    ELMIRE, MARIANE, DAMIS, CLEANTE, DORINE     ELMIRE (to Cleante)   You're very lucky to have missed the speech   She gave us at the door. I see my husband   Is home again. He hasn't seen me yet,   So I'll go up and wait till he comes in.    CLEANTE   And I, to save time, will await him here;   I'll merely say good-morning, and be gone.      SCENE IV    CLEANTE, DAMIS, DORINE    DAMIS   I wish you'd say a word to him about   My sister's marriage; I suspect Tartuffe   Opposes it, and puts my father up   To all these wretched shifts. You know, besides,   How nearly I'm concerned in it myself;   If love unites my sister and Valere,   I love his sister too; and if this marriage   Were to ...    DORINE   He's coming.      SCENE V    ORGON, CLEANTE, DORINE     ORGON   Ah! Good morning, brother.    CLEANTE   I was just going, but am glad to greet you.   Things are not far advanced yet, in the country?    ORGON   Dorine ...    (To Cleante)   Just wait a bit, please, brother-in-law.   Let me allay my first anxiety   By asking news about the family.    (To Dorine)   Has everything gone well these last two days?   What's happening? And how is everybody?    DORINE   Madam had fever, and a splitting headache   Day before yesterday, all day and evening.    ORGON   And how about Tartuffe?    DORINE   Tartuffe? He's well;   He's mighty well; stout, fat, fair, rosy-lipped.    ORGON   Poor man!    DORINE   At evening she had nausea   And couldn't touch a single thing for supper,   Her headache still was so severe.    ORGON   And how   About Tartuffe?    DORINE   He supped alone, before her,   And unctuously ate up two partridges,   As well as half a leg o' mutton, deviled.    ORGON   Poor man!    DORINE   All night she couldn't get a wink   Of sleep, the fever racked her so; and we   Had to sit up with her till daylight.    ORGON   How   About Tartuffe?    DORINE   Gently inclined to slumber,   He left the table, went into his room,   Got himself straight into a good warm bed,   And slept quite undisturbed until next morning.    ORGON   Poor man!    DORINE   At last she let us all persuade her,   And got up courage to be bled; and then   She was relieved at once.    ORGON   And how about   Tartuffe?    DORINE   He plucked up courage properly,   Bravely entrenched his soul against all evils,   And to replace the blood that she had lost,   He drank at breakfast four huge draughts of wine.    ORGON   Poor man!    DORINE   So now they both are doing well;   And I'll go straightway and inform my mistress   How pleased you are at her recovery.      SCENE VI    ORGON, CLEANTE     CLEANTE   Brother, she ridicules you to your face;   And I, though I don't want to make you angry,   Must tell you candidly that she's quite right.   Was such infatuation ever heard of?   And can a man to-day have charms to make you   Forget all else, relieve his poverty,   Give him a home, and then ... ?    ORGON   Stop there, good brother,   You do not know the man you're speaking of.    CLEANTE   Since you will have it so, I do not know him;   But after all, to tell what sort of man   He is ...    ORGON   Dear brother, you'd be charmed to know him;   Your raptures over him would have no end.   He is a man ... who ... ah! ... in fact ...a man   Whoever does his will, knows perfect peace,   And counts the whole world else, as so much dung.   His converse has transformed me quite; he weans   My heart from every friendship, teaches me   To have no love for anything on earth;   And I could see my brother, children, mother,   And wife, all die, and never care--a snap.    CLEANTE   Your feelings are humane, I must say, brother!    ORGON   Ah! If you'd seen him, as I saw him first,   You would have loved him just as much as I.   He came to church each day, with contrite mien,   Kneeled, on both knees, right opposite my place,   And drew the eyes of all the congregation,   To watch the fervour of his prayers to heaven;   With deep-drawn sighs and great ejaculations,   He humbly kissed the earth at every moment;   And when I left the church, he ran before me   To give me holy water at the door.   I learned his poverty, and who he was,   By questioning his servant, who is like him,   And gave him gifts; but in his modesty   He always wanted to return a part.   \"It is too much,\" he'd say, \"too much by half;   I am not worthy of your pity.\" Then,   When I refused to take it back, he'd go,   Before my eyes, and give it to the poor.   At length heaven bade me take him to my home,   And since that day, all seems to prosper here.   He censures everything, and for my sake   He even takes great interest in my wife;   He lets me know who ogles her, and seems   Six times as jealous as I am myself.   You'd not believe how far his zeal can go:   He calls himself a sinner just for trifles;   The merest nothing is enough to shock him;   So much so, that the other day I heard him   Accuse himself for having, while at prayer,   In too much anger caught and killed a flea.    CLEANTE   Zounds, brother, you are mad, I think! Or else   You're making sport of me, with such a speech.   What are you driving at with all this nonsense ... ?    ORGON   Brother, your language smacks of atheism;   And I suspect your soul's a little tainted   Therewith. I've preached to you a score of times   That you'll draw down some judgment on your head.    CLEANTE   That is the usual strain of all your kind;   They must have every one as blind as they.   They call you atheist if you have good eyes;   And if you don't adore their vain grimaces,   You've neither faith nor care for sacred things.   No, no; such talk can't frighten me; I know   What I am saying; heaven sees my heart.   We're not the dupes of all your canting mummers;   There are false heroes--and false devotees;   And as true heroes never are the ones   Who make much noise about their deeds of honour,   Just so true devotees, whom we should follow,   Are not the ones who make so much vain show.   What! Will you find no difference between   Hypocrisy and genuine devoutness?   And will you treat them both alike, and pay   The self-same honour both to masks and faces   Set artifice beside sincerity,   Confuse the semblance with reality,   Esteem a phantom like a living person,   And counterfeit as good as honest coin?   Men, for the most part, are strange creatures, truly!   You never find them keep the golden mean;   The limits"]]]
