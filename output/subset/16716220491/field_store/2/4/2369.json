This half-yearly interval between mails had a double effect on our minds.  In the first place, it induced a strange feeling that the great world and all its affairs were things of the past, with which we had little or nothing to do--a sort of dream--and that the little world of our outpost, with its eight or ten men and three or four Indian women, its hunting, and trapping, and firewood-cutting, and fishing, and trading, and small domestic arrangements and dissensions, was the one place of vital importance and interest, before which empires and dynasties and the trifling matter of politics sank into mere insignificance!  In the second place, it created an intense longing--a hungering and thirsting--for news of our kindred \"at home.\"  Our chief, Mr Strang, and our two selves, with another fellow-clerk who was named Spooner, as well as most of our men, were from \"the old country,\" where we had left fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters--in some cases sweethearts--behind us.  It may be conceived then with what anxiety and yearning we looked forward to the periodical break in the weary six months of total silence that had enveloped us.  Men in civilised, or even semi-civilised communities, cannot understand this. Convicts on penal servitude for long periods may have some faint notion of it, but even these have periods of literary intercourse more frequently than we had.  The reader must just take the statement on trust therefore, that our anxious yearnings were remarkably powerful. What might not have occurred in these six months of dark silence!  Who might not have been married, born, laid low by sickness, banished to the ends of the earth like ourselves, or even removed by death!  Is it surprising, then, that we caught our breath and flushed, and that our hearts leaped when we came unexpectedly upon the track of the two men who had dragged news from home for hundreds of miles over the snow? We knew the tracks well.  Our intimate acquaintance with every species of track that was possible in that particular region, rendered a mistake out of the question.  There was the step of the leader, who wore a snow-shoe the shape of which, although not unknown, was somewhat unfamiliar to us.  There was the print of the sled, or toboggan, which was different in pattern from those used at Dunregan, and there was the footprint of the man in rear, whose snow-shoe also made an unfamiliar impression.  \"The packet!\" exclaimed Lumley, opening his solemn grey eyes to their widest as he looked up from the track to me.  \"At last!\"  I returned, unconsciously betraying the prolonged state of suspense with which my mind had been afflicted.  \"Come along!\" said my companion, starting off homeward at a pace that was almost too much for me.  We soon reached the outpost, and there stood the makers of the track which had roused in us so much excitement.  Two strong men, chosen expressly for a duty which required mental endurance and perseverance as well as physical vigour.  They stood at the door of the entrance-hall, talking with Mr Strang, the one with his snow-shoes slung over his shoulder on the butt of his gun, the other using the same implements as a rest for his hands, while Spooner, in a state of great excitement, was hastily undoing the lashings of the sled, to get at the precious box which contained \"the packet.\"  \"Well, gentlemen, here it is at last,\" said our chief, with a genial smile as we came up.  \"Yes, we followed the track immediately we struck it,\" said Lumley, stooping to assist Spooner in his work.  We soon had the box carried to our chief's private room, while the two strangers were had off by our men to their own house, there to be feasted on venison, ptarmigan, salt-pork, fish, and pease-pudding to satiety, and afterwards \"pumped\" to a state of exhaustion.  I followed our chief, who had a provokingly deliberate way of opening the packet and examining its contents, while my feverish agitation and expectancy increased.  There was a humorous twinkle in his eye, I thought, which told of mischievous purpose, while he kept up a murmuring commentary.  \"Hm! as I expected--no news from Macnab.  What's this?--ah!  The Governor!  A voluminous epistle, and--hallo!  Lumley's friends must be fond of him.  His packet is the biggest in the box.  And Spooner too, not so bad for him.  Here, take these to them.  Stay--here is a bundle of letters for the men.  You'd better deliver these yourself.\"  I hesitated, while a mist of great darkness began to descend on my soul.  \"Nothing for me, sir?\"  I asked faintly.  \"There seems to be--nothing--stay! what's this?--why, I thought it was a big book, but, yes, it _is_ a packet for you, Mr Maxby--there!\"  My heart leaped into my mouth--almost out of it--as I received a thick packet wrapped in newspaper.  Hastening to what was called the clerk's winter house with these treasures I distributed them, and handed the men's packet to one of themselves, who was eagerly awaiting it.  Then I went to my room and barricaded the door to prevent interruption.  In Bachelors' Hall, as we styled our apartments, we had an inveterate habit of practical joking, which, however interesting and agreeable it might be at most times, was in some circumstances rather inconvenient. To guard against it at such times we were in the habit of retiring to our respective dens and barricading the doors, the locks being sometimes incapable of standing the strain brought to bear on them.  On this particular occasion I made my barricade stronger than usual; sat down on my bed and opened the packet from home.  But here I must let the curtain fall.  I cannot suppose that the reader, however amiable, will sympathise with the joys and sorrows of an unknown family, interesting though they were to me.  I may state, however, that before I got through the budget it was so late that I turned into bed and read the remainder there.  Then, as the fire in the hall-stove sank low, the cold obliged me to put on above my voluminous blankets (we dared not sleep in sheets out there) a thick buffalo robe, which, besides having on the outside the shaggy hair of the animal, to which it had belonged, was lined with flannel.  Thus nestled into a warm hole, I read on until a shout arrested me and brought me suddenly back from the hills of bonny Scotland to the frozen wilderness.  \"I say,\" shouted Lumley at the back of the door, which he saluted with a kick, \"my sister is married!\"  \"Poor thing!\" said I.  \"Who to?\"  \"Open the door.\"  \"I can't.  I'm in bed.\"  \"You must.\"  \"I won't.\"  \"No! then here goes.\"  He retired as he spoke, and, making a rush, launched himself against my door, which, however, withstood the shock.  \"Here, Spooner,\" I then heard him say, \"lend a hand; let us go at it together.\"  They went at it together.  The lock gave way; the chest of drawers went spinning to the other side of the room, and Lumley tumbled over Spooner as both fell headlong to the floor.  As this was by no means an unfamiliar mode of entering each other's rooms, I took no notice of it, but proceeded to inquire about the married sister; and Lumley, sitting down on my bed with Spooner, for neither of them had yet undressed, began to tell me of home and friends with as much eagerness as if I had been a member of both families. Young Spooner interrupted Lumley now and then when a touch of coincidence struck him with reference to his own family affairs, and I could not resist the pleasure of occasionally making some such remark as, \"How odd! that's very like what happened to my little brother Bob,\" etcetera, whereupon Spooner would immediately become excited and draw a parallel more or less striking in regard to his own kindred and so we went on far into the night, until we got our several families mixed up to such an extent that it became almost impossible to disentangle them; for, being three families, you know, we became inextricably confused as to which was which, though each was perfectly clear in regard to his own!  Thus, to me, Jane Lumley became confused with Janet Spooner, so that Janet Lumley and Jane Spooner were always tripping over each other in my brain, while my dear cousin Maggie Maxby became a Maggie Spooner to Lumley, and a Maggie Lumley to Spooner, and to each sometimes a Janet or a Jane respectively.  If the reader will multiply into this question two mothers and three fathers, four brothers and six sisters, besides numberless aunts, uncles, and cousins, male and female, he will easily perceive how between mental perplexity and a tendency to slumber, we at last gave the matter up in a sort of jovial despair.  We were startled suddenly from this condition by a crash and an exceedingly sharp and bitter cry.  It must be remarked here, that, in order to subdue King Frost in those northern strongholds of his, we had, besides double doors and double windows and porches, an enormous cast-iron stove from the famous Carron foundry.  It stood in the centre of our hall, so that its genial favours might be distributed with equal justice to the various sleeping-rooms that opened out of the hall all round.  From this stove an iron pipe arose, and, turning at a right angle when within a couple of feet of the ceiling, proceeded to the chimney at the upper end of the hall.  When the thermometer stood much below zero, we were accustomed to raise the stove and part of its pipe to a dull-red heat, which had the effect of partially melting the contents of the water-jugs in our bedrooms, and of partially roasting the knees of our trousers.  To keep this stove up to its work was the duty of an Indian youth, whom we styled Salamander, because he seemed to be impervious to heat.  He was equally so to cold."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21719"],["title","Blue Lights: Hot Work in the Soudan (#1)"],["body"," Redhair, \"you've got no call to do it.  The station ain't far off, and the sooner we get there the better for all parties.\"  A slight clink of metal at this point made Miles aware of the fact that Hook-nose was drawing a pair of handcuffs from one of his pockets.  The full significance of his position suddenly burst upon him.  The thought of being led home a prisoner, or conveyed to the police-station handcuffed, maddened him; and the idea of being thus unjustly checked at the very outset of his independent career made him furious.  For a few moments he stood so perfectly still and quiet that the detectives were thrown slightly off their guard.  Then there was an explosion of some sort within the breast of Miles Milton.  It expended itself in a sudden impulse, which sent Redhead flat on the table among the crockery, and drove Hook-nose into the fireplace among the fire-irons.  A fat little man chanced to be standing in the door-way.  The same impulse, modified, shot that little man into the street like a cork out of a bottle, and next moment Miles was flying along the pavement at racing speed, horrified at what he had done, but utterly reckless as to what might follow!  Hearing the shouts of pursuers behind him, and being incommoded by passers-by in the crowded thoroughfare, Miles turned sharply into a by-street, and would have easily made his escape--being uncommonly swift of foot--had he not been observed by an active little man of supple frame and presumptuous tendencies.  Unlike the mass of mankind around him--who stared and wondered--the active little man took in the situation at a glance, joined in the pursuit, kept well up, thus forming a sort of connecting-link between the fugitive and pursuers, and even took upon himself to shout \"Stop thief!\" as he ran.  Miles endeavoured to throw him off by putting on, as schoolboys have it, \"a spurt.\"  But the active little man also spurted and did not fall far behind.  Then Miles tried a second double, and got into a narrow street, which a single glance showed him was a blind alley!  Disappointment and anger hereupon took possession of him, and he turned at bay with the tiger-like resolve to run a-muck!  Fortunately for himself he observed a pot of whitewash standing near a half-whitened wall, with a dirty canvas frock and a soiled billycock lying beside it.  The owner of the property had left it inopportunely, for, quick as thought, Miles wriggled into the frock, flung on the billycock, seized the pot, and walked in a leisurely way to the head of the alley.  He reached it just as the active little man turned into it, at the rate of ten miles an hour.  A yell of \"Stop thief!\" issued from the man's presumptuous lips at the moment.  His injunction was obeyed to the letter, for the would-be thief of an honest man's character on insufficient evidence was stopped by Miles's bulky person so violently that the whitewash was scattered all about, and part of it went into the active man's eyes.  To squash the large brush into the little man's face, and thus effectually complete what his own recklessness had begun, was the work of an instant.  As he did it, Miles assumed the role of the injured party, suiting his language to his condition.  \"What d'ee mean by that, you houtrageous willain?\" he cried savagely, to the great amusement of the bystanders, who instantly formed a crowd round them.  \"Look wot a mess you've bin an' made o' my clean frock! Don't you see?\"  The poor little man could not see.  He could only cough and gasp and wipe his face with his coat-tails.  \"I'd give you in charge o' the pleece, I would, if it wasn't that you've pretty well punished yourself a'ready,\" continued Miles.  \"Take 'im to a pump some o' you, 'cause I ain't got time.  Good-day, spider-legs, an' don't go for to run into a hartist again, with a paint-pot in 'is 'and.\"  So saying, Miles pushed through the laughing crowd and sauntered away. He turned into the first street he came to, and then went forward as fast as was consistent with the idea of an artisan in a hurry.  Being utterly ignorant of the particular locality into which he had penetrated--though well enough acquainted with the main thoroughfares of the city--his only care was to put as many intricate streets and lanes as possible between himself and the detectives.  This was soon done, and thereafter, turning into a darkish passage, he got rid of the paint-pot and borrowed costume.  Fortunately he had thrust his own soft helmet-shaped cap into his breast at the time he put on the billycock, and was thus enabled to issue from the dark passage very much like his former self, with the exception of a few spots of whitewash, which were soon removed.  Feeling now pretty safe, our hero walked a considerable distance through the unknown parts of the city, before he ventured to inquire the way to thoroughfares with which he was familiar.  Once in these, he proceeded at a smart pace to one of the railway stations, intending to leave town, though as yet he had formed no definite plan of action.  In truth, his mind was much troubled and confused by the action of his conscience, for when the thought of leaving home and entering the army as a private soldier, against his father's wishes, crossed his mind, Conscience faithfully shook his head; and when softer feelings prevailed, and the question arose irresistibly, \"Shall I return home?\" the same faithful friend whispered, \"Yes.\"  In a state of indecision, Miles found himself borne along by a human stream to the booking-office.  Immediately in front of him were two soldiers,--one a sergeant, and the other a private of the line.  Both were tall handsome men, straight as arrows, and with that air of self-sufficient power which is as far removed from arrogance as it is from cowardice, and is by no means an uncommon feature in men of the British army.  Miles felt a strong, unaccountable attraction towards the young private. He had not yet heard his voice nor encountered his eye; indeed, being behind him, he had only seen his side-face, and as the expression on it was that of stern gravity, the attractive power could not have lain in that.  It might have lain in the youthful look of the lad, for albeit a goodly man in person, he was almost a boy in countenance, being apparently not yet twenty years of age.  Miles was at last roused to the necessity for prompt and decisive action by the voice of the sergeant saying in tones of authority--  \"Portsmouth--third--two--single.\"  \"That's the way to go it, lobster!\" remarked a shabby man, next in the line behind Miles.  The grave sergeant paid no more regard to this remark than if it had been the squeak of a mouse.  \"Now, then, sir, your carridge stops the way.  'Eave a'ead.  Shall I 'elp you?\" said the shabby man.  Thus admonished, Miles, scarce knowing what he said, repeated the sergeant's words--  \"Portsmouth--third--two--single.\"  \"Vy, you ain't agoin' to pay for _me_, are you?\" exclaimed the shabby man in smiling surprise.  \"Oh! beg pardon.  I mean _one_,\" said Miles to the clerk, quickly.  The clerk retracted the second ticket with stolid indifference, and Miles, hastening to the platform, sat down on a seat, deeply and uncomfortably impressed with the fact that he possessed little or no money!  This unsatisfactory state of things had suddenly burst upon him while in the act of paying for his ticket.  He now made a careful examination of his purse, and found its contents to be exactly seven shillings and sixpence, besides a few coppers in his trousers-pocket.  Again indecision assailed him.  Should he return?  It was not too late. \"Yes,\" said Conscience, with emphasis.  \"No,\" said Shame.  False pride echoed the word, and Self-will re-echoed it.  Still our hero hesitated, and there is no saying what the upshot might have been if the bell had not rung at the moment, and, \"Now, then, take your seats!\" put an end to the controversy.  Another minute, and Miles Milton was seated opposite the two soldiers, rushing towards our great southern seaport at the rate of forty miles an hour.    CHAPTER TWO.  SHOWS SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FALSE STEP, AND INTRODUCES THE READER TO PECULIAR COMPANY.  Our hero soon discovered that the sergeant was an old campaigner, having been out in Egypt at the beginning of the war, and fought at the famous battle of Tel-el-Kebir.  In his grave and undemonstrative way and quiet voice, this man related some of his experiences, so as not only to gain the attention of his companion in arms, but to fascinate all who chanced to be within earshot of him--not the least interested among whom, of course, was our friend Miles.  As the sergeant continued to expatiate on those incidents of the war which had come under his own observation, three points impressed themselves on our hero: first, that the sergeant was evidently a man of serious, if not religious, spirit; second, that while he gave all due credit to his comrades for their bravery in action, he dwelt chiefly on those incidents which brought out the higher qualities of the men, such as uncomplaining endurance, forbearance, etcetera, and he never boasted of having given \"a thorough licking\" to the Egyptians, nor spoke disparagingly of the native troops; lastly, that he seemed to lay himself out with a special view to the unflagging entertainment of his young comrade.  The reason for this last purpose he learned during a short halt at one of the stations.  Seeing the sergeant standing alone there, Miles, after accosting him with the inevitable references to the state of the weather, remarked that his comrade seemed to be almost too young for the rough work of soldiering.  \"Yes, he is young enough, but older than he looks,\" answered the sergeant.  \"Poor lad!  I'm sorry for him.\"  \"Indeed!  He does not seem to me a fit subject for pity.  Young, strong, handsome, intelligent, he seems pretty well furnished to begin the battle of life--especially in the army.\"  \"`Things are not what"]]]
