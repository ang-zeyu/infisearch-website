The grand salon, on the outer zone where the curvature of the floors was less disconcerting, was as magnificent as any but a few of the rooms of the Imperial Palace at Asgard on Odin, the floor richly carpeted and the walls alternating mirrors and paintings. The movable furniture varied according to occasion; at present, it consisted of the bare desk at which they sat, the three chairs they occupied, and the three secretary-robots, their rectangular black casts blazened with the Sun and Cogwheel of the Empire. It faced the door, at the far end of the room; on either side, a rank of spacemen, in dress uniform and under arms, stood.  In principle, annexing a planet to the Empire was simplicity itself, but like so many things simple in principle, it was apt to be complicated in practice, and to this, he suspected, the present instance would be no exception.  In principle, one simply informed the planetary government that it was now subject to the sovereignty of his Imperial Majesty, the Galactic Emperor. This information was always conveyed by a Ministerial Secretary, directly under the Prime Minister and only one more step down from the Emperor, in the present instance Jurgen, Prince Trevannion. To make sure that the announcement carried conviction, the presumedly glad tidings were accompanied by the Imperial Space Navy, at present represented by Commodore Vann Shatrak and a seven ship battle-line unit, and two thousand Imperial Landing-Troops.  When the locals had been properly convinced--with as little bloodshed as necessary, but always beyond any dispute--an Imperial Proconsul, in this case Obray, Count Erskyll, would be installed. He would by no means govern the planet. The Imperial Constitution was definite on that point; every planetary government should be sovereign as to intraplanetary affairs. The Proconsul, within certain narrow and entirely inelastic limits, would merely govern the government.  Unfortunately, Obray, Count Erskyll, appeared not to understand this completely. It was his impression that he was a torch-bearer of Imperial civilization, or something equally picturesque and metaphorical. As he conceived it, it was the duty of the Empire, as represented by himself, to make over backward planets like Aditya in the image of Odin or Marduk or Osiris or Baldur or, preferably, his own home world of Aton.  This was Obray of Erskyll's first proconsular appointment, it was due to family influence, and it was a mistake. Mistakes, of course, were inevitable in anything as large and complex as the Galactic Empire, and any institution guided by men was subject to one kind of influence or another, family influence being no worse than any other kind. In this case, the ultra-conservative Erskylls of Aton, from old Errol, Duke of Yorvoy, down, had become alarmed at the political radicalism of young Obray, and had, on his graduation from the University of Nefertiti, persuaded the Prime Minister to appoint him to a Proconsulate as far from Aton as possible, where he would not embarrass them. Just at that time, more important matters having been gotten out of the way, Aditya had come up for annexation, and Obray of Erskyll had been named Proconsul.  That had been the mistake. He should have been sent to some planet which had been under Imperial rule for some time, where the Proconsulate ran itself in a well-worn groove, and where he could at leisure learn the procedures and unlearn some of the unrealisms absorbed at the University from professors too well insulated from the realities of politics.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a stir among the guards; helmet-visors were being snapped down; feet scuffed. They stiffened to attention, the great doors at the other end of the grand salon slid open, and the guards presented arms as the Adityan delegation was ushered in.  There were fourteen of them. They all wore ankle-length gowns, and they all had shaven heads. The one in the lead carried a staff and wore a pale green gown; he was apparently a herald. Behind him came two in white gowns, their empty hands folded on their breasts; one was a huge bulk of obesity with a bulging brow, protuberant eyes and a pursey little mouth, and the other was thin and cadaverous, with a skull-like, almost fleshless face. The ones behind, in dark green and pale blue, carried portfolios and slung sound-recorder cases. There was a metallic twinkle at each throat; as they approached, he could see that they all wore large silver gorgets. They came to a halt twenty feet from the desk. The herald raised his staff.  \"I present the Admirable and Trusty Tchall Hozhet, personal chief-slave of the Lord-Master Olvir Nikkolon, Chairman of the Presidium of the Lords-Master's Convocation, and Khreggor Chmidd, chief-slave in office to the Lord-Master Rovard Javasan, Chief of Administration of Management of the Mastership,\" he said. Then he stopped, puzzled, looking from one to another of them. When his eyes fell on Vann Shatrak, he brightened.  \"Are you,\" he asked, \"the chief-slave of the chief Lord-Master of this ship?\"  Shatrak's face turned pink; the pink darkened to red. He used a word; it was a completely unprintable word. So, except for a few scattered pronouns, conjunctions and prepositions, were the next fifty words he used. The herald stiffened. The two delegates behind him were aghast. The subordinate burden-bearers in the rear began looking around apprehensively.  \"I,\" Shatrak finally managed, \"am an officer of his Imperial Majesty's Space Navy. I am in command of this battle-line unit. I am _not_\"--he reverted briefly to obscenity--\"a slave.\"  \"You mean, you are a Lord-Master, too?\" That seemed to horrify the herald even more that the things Shatrak had been calling him. \"Forgive me, Lord-Master. I did not think....\"  \"That's right; you didn't,\" Shatrak agreed. \"And don't call me Lord-Master again, or I'll....\"  \"Just a moment, Commodore.\" He waved the herald aside and addressed the two in white gowns, shifting to Lingua Terra. \"This is a ship of the Galactic Empire,\" he told them. \"In the Empire, there are no slaves. Can you understand that?\"  Evidently not. The huge one, Khreggor Chmidd, turned to the skull-faced Tchall Hozhet, saying: \"Then they must all be Lords-Master.\" He saw the objection to that at once. \"But how can one be a Lord-Master if there are no slaves?\"  The horror was not all on the visitors' side of the desk, either. Obray of Erskyll was staring at the delegation and saying, \"Slaves!\" under his breath. Obray of Erskyll had never, in his not-too-long life, seen a slave before.  \"They can't be,\" Tchall Hozhet replied. \"A Lord-Master is one who owns slaves.\" He gave that a moment's consideration. \"But if they aren't Lords-Master, they must be slaves, and....\" No. That wouldn't do, either. \"But a slave is one who belongs to a Lord-Master.\"  Rule of the Excluded Third; evidently Pre-Atomic formal logic had crept back to Aditya. Chmidd, looking around, saw the ranks of spacemen on either side, now at parade-rest.  \"But aren't they slaves?\" he asked.  \"They are spacemen of the Imperial Navy,\" Shatrak roared. \"Call one a slave to his face and you'll get a rifle-butt in yours. And I shan't lift a finger to stop it.\" He glared at Chmidd and Hozhet. \"Who had the infernal impudence to send slaves to deal with the Empire? He needs to be taught a lesson.\"  \"Why, I was sent by the Lord-Master Olvir Nikkolon, and....\"  \"Tchall!\" Chmidd hissed at him. \"We cannot speak to Lords-Master. We must speak to their chief-slaves.\"  \"But they have no slaves,\" Hozhet objected. \"Didn't you hear the ... the one with the small beard ... say so?\"  \"But that's ridiculous, Khreggor. Who does the work, and who tells them what to do? Who told these people to come here?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Our Emperor sent us. That is his picture, behind me. But we are not his slaves. He is merely the chief man among us. Do your Masters not have one among them who is chief?\"  \"That's right,\" Chmidd said to Hozhet. \"In the Convocation, your Lord-Master is chief, and in the Mastership, my Lord-Master, Rovard Javasan, is chief.\"  \"But they don't tell the other Lords-Master what to do. In Convocation, the other Lords-Master tell them....\"  \"That's what I meant about an oligarchy,\" he whispered, in Imperial, to Erskyll.  \"Suppose we tell Ravney to herd these Lords-Master onto a couple of landing-craft and bring them up here?\" Shatrak suggested. He made the suggestion in Lingua Terra Basic, and loudly.  \"I think we can manage without that.\" He raised his voice, speaking in Lingua Terra Basic:  \"It does not matter whether these slaves talk to us or not. This planet is now under the rule of his Imperial Majesty, Rodrik III. If this Mastership wants to govern the planet under the Emperor, they may do so. If not, we will make an end of them and set up a new government here.\"  He paused. Chmidd and Hozhet were looking at one another in shocked incredulity.  \"Tchall, they mean it,\" Chmidd said. \"They can do it, too.\"  \"We have nothing more to say to you slaves,\" he continued. \"Hereafter, we will speak directly to the Lords-Master.\"  \"But.... The Lords-Master never do business directly,\" Hozhet said. \"It is un-Masterly. Such discussions are between chief-slaves.\"  \"This thing they call the Convocation,\" Shatrak mentioned. \"I wonder if the members have the business done entirely through their slaves.\"  \"Oh, no!\" That shocked Chmidd into direct address. \"No slave is allowed in the Convocation Chamber.\"  He wondered how they kept the place swept out. Robots, no doubt. Or else, what happened when the Masters weren't there didn't count.  \"Very well. Your people have recorders; are they on?\"  Hozhet asked Chmidd; Chmidd asked the herald, who asked one of the menials in the rear, who asked somebody else. The reply came back through the same channels; they were.  \"Very well.

The _Countess Dorothy_ was losing speed and altitude. Now he could see it, first a blur and then distinctly. The Airlines Building, so thick as to look squat for all its height. The yellow block of the distilleries under their plume of steam. High Garden Terrace; the Mall.  Moment by moment, the stigmata of decay became more evident. Terraces empty or littered with rubbish; gardens untended and choked with wild growth; blank-staring windows, walls splotched with lichens. At first, he was horrified at what had happened to Litchfield in six years. Then he realized that the change had been in himself. He was seeing it with new eyes, as it really was.  The ship came in five hundred feet above the Mall, and he could see cracked pavements sprouting grass, statues askew on their pedestals, waterless fountains. At first he thought one of them was playing, but what he had taken for spray was dust blowing from the empty basin. There was a thing about dusty fountains, some poem he'd read at the University.  _The fountains are dusty in the Graveyard of Dreams; The hinges are rusty, they swing with tiny screams._  Was Poictesme a Graveyard of Dreams? No; Junkyard of Empire. The Terran Federation had impoverished a hundred planets, devastated a score, actually depopulated at least three, to keep the System States Alliance from seceding. It hadn't been a victory. It had only been a lesser defeat.  There was a crowd, almost a mob, on the dock; nearly everybody in topside Litchfield. He spotted old Colonel Zareff, with his white hair and plum-brown skin, and Tom Brangwyn, the town marshal, red-faced and bulking above everybody else. Kurt Fawzi, the mayor, well to the front. Then he saw his father and mother, and his sister Flora, and waved to them. They waved back, and then everybody was waving. The gangway-port opened, and the Academy band struck up, enthusiastically if inexpertly, as he descended to the dock.  His father was wearing a black suit with a long coat, cut to the same pattern as the one he had worn six years ago. Blackout curtain cloth. It was fairly new, but the coat had begun to acquire a permanent wrinkle across the right hip, over the pistol butt. His mother's dress was new, and so was Flora's, made for the occasion. He couldn't be sure just which of the Federation Armed Forces had provided the material, but his father's shirt was Med Service sterilon.  Ashamed to be noticing things like that, he clasped his father's hand, kissed his mother, embraced his sister. There were a few, but very few, gray threads in his father's mustache; a few more squint-wrinkles around the eyes. His mother's hair was all gray, now, and she was heavier. She seemed shorter, but that would be because he'd grown a few inches in the last six years. For a moment, he was surprised that Flora actually looked younger. Then he realized that to seventeen, twenty-three is practically middle age, but to twenty-three, twenty-nine is almost contemporary. He noticed the glint on her left hand and caught it to look at the ring.  \"Hey! Zarathustra sunstone! Nice,\" he said. \"Where is he, Sis?\"  He'd never met her fiance; Wade Lucas hadn't come to Litchfield to practice medicine until the year after he'd gone to Terra.  \"Oh, emergency,\" Flora said. \"Obstetrical case; that won't wait on anything. In Tramptown, of course. But he'll be at the party.... Oops, I shouldn't have said that; that's supposed to be a surprise.\"  \"Don't worry; I'll be surprised,\" he promised.  Then Kurt Fawzi was pushing forward, holding out his hand. Thinner, and grayer, but just as effusive as ever.  \"Welcome home, Conn. Judge, shake hands with him and tell him how glad we all are to see him back.... Now, Franz, put away the recorder; save the interview for the _Chronicle_ till later. Ah, Professor Kellton; one pupil Litchfield Academy can be proud of!\"  He shook hands with them: Judge Ledue, Franz Veltrin, old Professor Dolf Kellton. They were all happy; how much, he wondered, because he was Conn Maxwell, Rodney Maxwell's son, home from Terra, and how much because of what they hoped he'd tell them. Kurt Fawzi, edging him aside, was the first to speak of it.  \"Conn, what did you find out?\" he whispered. \"Do you know where it is?\"  He stammered, then saw Tom Brangwyn and Colonel Klem Zareff approaching, the older man tottering on a silver-headed cane and the younger keeping pace with him. Neither of them had been born on Poictesme. Tom Brangwyn had always been reticent about where he came from, but Hathor was a good guess. There had been political trouble on Hathor twenty years ago; the losers had had to get off-planet in a hurry to dodge firing squads. Klem Zareff never was reticent about his past. He came from Ashmodai, one of the System States planets, and he had commanded a regiment, and finally a division that had been blasted down to less than regimental strength, in the Alliance Army. He always wore a little rosette of System States black and green on his coat.  \"Hello, boy,\" he croaked, extending a hand. \"Good to see you again.\"  \"It sure is, Conn,\" the town marshal agreed, then lowered his voice. \"Find out anything definite?\"  \"We didn't have much time, Conn,\" Kurt Fawzi said, \"but we've arranged a little celebration for you. We'll start it with a dinner at Senta's.\"  \"You couldn't have done anything I'd have liked better, Mr. Fawzi. I'd have to have a meal at Senta's before I'd really feel at home.\"  \"Well, it'll be a couple of hours. Suppose we all go up to my office, in the meantime. Give the ladies a chance to fix up for the party, and have a little drink and a talk together.\"  \"You want to do that, Conn?\" his father asked. There was an odd undernote of anxiety, or reluctance, in his voice.  \"Yes, of course. I'd like that.\"  His father turned to speak to his mother and Flora. Kurt Fawzi was speaking to his wife, interrupting himself to shout instructions to some laborers who were bringing up a contragravity skid. Conn turned to Colonel Zareff.  \"Good melon crop this year?\" he asked.  The old Rebel cursed. \"Gehenna of a big crop; we're up to our necks in melons. This time next year we'll be washing our feet in brandy.\"  \"Hold onto it and age it; you ought to see what they charge for a drink of Poictesme brandy on Terra.\"  \"This isn't Terra, and we aren't selling it by the drink,\" Colonel Zareff said. \"We're selling it at Storisende Spaceport, for what the freighter captains pay us. You've been away too long, Conn. You've forgotten what it's like to live in a poor-house.\"  The cargo was coming off, now. Cask staves, and more cask staves. Zareff swore bitterly at the sight, and then they started toward the wide doors of the shipping floor, inside the Airlines Building. Outgoing cargo was beginning to come out; casks of brandy, of course, and a lot of boxes and crates, painted light blue and bearing the yellow trefoil of the Third Fleet-Army Force and the eight-pointed red star of Ordnance. Cases of rifles; square boxes of ammunition; crated auto-cannon. Conn turned to his father.  \"This our stuff?\" he asked. \"Where did you dig it?\"  Rodney Maxwell laughed. \"You know the old Tenth Army Headquarters, over back of Snagtooth, in the Calders? Everybody knows that was cleaned out years ago. Well, always take a second look at these things everybody knows. Ten to one they're not so. It always bothered me that nobody found any underground attack-shelters. I took a second look, and sure enough, I found them, right underneath, mined out of the solid rock. Conn, you'd be surprised at what I found there.\"  \"Where are you going to sell that stuff?\" he asked, pointing at a passing skid. \"There's enough combat equipment around now to outfit a private army for every man, woman and child in Poictesme.\"  \"Storisende Spaceport. The freighter captains buy it, and sell it on some of the planets that were colonized right before the War and haven't gotten industrialized yet. I'm clearing about two hundred sols a ton on it.\"  The skid at which he had pointed was loaded with cases of M504 submachine guns. Even used, one was worth fifty sols. Allowing for packing weight, his father was selling those tommy guns for less than a good cafe on Terra got for one drink of Poictesme brandy.     II   He had been in Kurt Fawzi's office before, once or twice, with his father; he remembered it as a dim, quiet place of genteel conviviality and rambling conversation. None of the lights were bright, and the walls were almost invisible in the shadows. As they entered, Tom Brangwyn went to the long table and took off his belt and holster, laying it down. One by one, the others unbuckled their weapons and added them to the pile. Klem Zareff's cane went on the table with his pistol; there was a sword inside it.  That was something else he was seeing with new eyes. He hadn't started carrying a gun when he had left for Terra, and he was wondering, now, why any of them bothered to. Why, there wouldn't be a shooting a year in Litchfield, if you didn't count the Tramptowners, and they stayed south of the docks and off the top level.  Or perhaps that was just it. Litchfield was peaceful because everybody was prepared to keep it that way. It certainly wasn't because of anything the Planetary Government did to maintain order.  Now Brangwyn was setting out glasses, filling a pitcher from a keg in the corner of the room. The last time Conn had been here, they'd given him a glass of wine, and he'd felt very grown-up because they didn't water it for him.  \"Well, gentlemen,\" Kurt Fawzi was saying, \"let's have a toast to our returned friend and new associate. Conn, we're all anxious to hear what you've found out, but even if you didn't learn anything, we're still happy to have you back with us. Gentlemen; to our friend and neighbor. Welcome home, Conn!\"  \"Well, it's wonderful to be back, Mr. Fawzi,\" he began.  \"Here, none of this mister foolishness; you're"]]]
