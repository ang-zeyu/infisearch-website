He could swim as much as he pleased and not get the least bit wet, because the water couldn't get through that new coat. And ever since that long-ago day when the world was young, the Minks have had waterproof coats and have been famous fishermen. Hello, Peter Rabbit! What under the sun are you trying to do, swelling yourself up that way?\"  \"I--I was just practising holding my breath,\" replied Peter and looked very, very foolish.  \"Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Grandfather Frog. \"You can't learn to swim by holding your breath on dry land, Peter Rabbit.\"                                      III                     HOW OLD MR. TOAD LEARNED TO SING                                      III                     HOW OLD MR. TOAD LEARNED TO SING   Peter Rabbit never will forget how he laughed the first time he heard Old Mr. Toad say that he could sing and was going to sing. Why, Peter would as soon think of singing himself, and that is something he can no more do than he can fly. Peter had known Old Mr. Toad ever since he could remember. He was rather fond of him, even if he did play jokes on him once in a while. But he always thought of Old Mr. Toad as one of the homeliest of all his friends,--slow, awkward, and too commonplace to be very interesting. So when, in the glad joyousness of the spring, Old Mr. Toad had told Jimmy Skunk that he was going down to the Smiling Pool to sing because without him the great chorus there would lack one of its sweetest voices, Peter and Jimmy had laughed till the tears came.  A few days later Peter happened over to the Smiling Pool for a call on Grandfather Frog. A mighty chorus of joy from unseen singers rose from all about the Smiling Pool. Peter knew about those singers. They were Hylas, the little cousins of Sticky-toes the Tree Toad. Peter sat very still on the edge of the bank trying to see one of them. Suddenly he became aware of a new note, one he never had noticed before and sweeter than any of the others. Indeed it was one of the sweetest of all the spring songs, as sweet as the love notes of Tommy Tit the Chickadee, than which there is none sweeter.  It seemed to come from the shallow water just in front of Peter, and he looked eagerly for the singer. Then his eyes opened until it seemed as if they would pop right out of his head, and he dropped his lower jaw foolishly. There was Old Mr. Toad with a queer bag Peter never had seen before swelled out under his chin, and as surely as Peter was sitting on that bank, it was Old Mr. Toad who was the sweet singer!  Old Mr. Toad paid no attention to Peter, not even when he was spoken to. He was so absorbed in his singing that he just didn't hear. Peter sat there a while to listen; then he called Jimmy Skunk and Unc' Billy Possum, who were also listening to the music, and they were just as surprised as Peter. Then he spied Jerry Muskrat at the other end of the Smiling Pool and hurried over there. Peter was so full of the discovery he had made that he could think of nothing else. He fairly ached to tell.  \"Jerry!\" he cried. \"Oh, Jerry Muskrat! Do you know that Old Mr. Toad can sing?\"  Jerry looked surprised that Peter should ask such a question. \"Of course I know it,\" said he. \"It would be mighty funny if I didn't know it, seeing that he is the sweetest singer in the Smiling Pool and has sung here every spring since I can remember.\"  Peter looked very much chagrined. \"I didn't know it until just how,\" he confessed. \"I didn't believe him when he told me that he could sing. I wonder how he ever learned.\"  \"He didn't learn any more than you learned how to jump,\" replied Jerry. \"It just came to him naturally. His father sang, and his grandfather, and his great grandfather, way back to the beginning of things. I thought everybody knew about that.\"  \"I don't. Tell me about it. Please do, Jerry,\" begged Peter.  \"All right, I will,\" replied Jerry good-naturedly. \"It's something you ought to know about, anyway. In the first place, Old Mr. Toad belongs to a very old and honorable family, one of the very oldest. I've heard say that it goes way back almost to the very beginning of things when there wasn't much land. Anyway, the first Toad, the great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather of Old Mr. Toad and own cousin to the great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather of Grandfather Frog, was one of the first to leave the water for the dry land.  \"Old Mother Nature met him hopping along and making hard work of it because, of course, it was so new. She looked at him sharply. 'What are you doing here?' she demanded. 'Aren't you contented with the water where you were born?'  \"Mr. Toad bowed very low. 'Yes'm,' said he very humbly. 'I'll go right back there if you say so. I thought there must be some things worth finding out on the land, and that I might be of some use in the Great World.'  \"His answer pleased Old Mother Nature. She was worried. She had planted all kinds of things on the land, and they were springing up everywhere, but she had discovered that bugs of many kinds liked the tender green things and were increasing so fast and were so greedy that they threatened to strip the land of all that she had planted. She had so many things to attend to that she hadn't time to take care of the bugs. 'If you truly want to be of some use,' said she, 'you can attend to some of those bugs.'  \"Mr. Toad went right to work, and Old Mother Nature went about some other business. Having so many other things to look after, she quite forgot about Mr. Toad, and it was several weeks before she came that way again. Right in the middle of a great bare place where the bugs had eaten everything was a beautiful green spot, and patiently hopping from plant to plant was Mr. Toad, snapping up every bug he could see. He didn't see Old Mother Nature and kept right on working. She watched him a while as he hopped from plant to plant catching bugs as fast as he could, and then she spoke.  \"'Have you stayed right here ever since I last saw you?' she asked.  \"Mr. Toad gave a start of surprise. 'Yes'm,' said he.  \"'But I thought you wanted to see the Great World and learn things,' said she.  \"Mr. Toad looked a little embarrassed. 'So I did,' he replied, 'but I wanted to be of some use, and the bugs have kept me so busy there was no time to travel. Besides, I have learned a great deal right here. I--I couldn't get around fast enough to save _all_ the plants, but I have saved what I could.'  \"Old Mother Nature was more pleased than she was willing to show, for Mr. Toad was the first of all the little people who had tried to help her, and he had done what he could willingly and faithfully.  \"'I suppose,' said she, speaking a little gruffly, 'you expect me to reward you.'  \"Mr. Toad looked surprised and a little hurt. 'I don't want any reward,' said he. 'I didn't do it for that. It will be reward enough to know that I really have helped and to be allowed to continue to help.'  \"At that Old Mother Nature's face lighted with one of her most beautiful smiles. 'Mr. Toad,' said she, 'if you could have just what you want, what would it be?'  \"Mr. Toad hesitated a few minutes and then said shyly, 'A beautiful voice.'  \"It was Old Mother Nature's turn to look surprised. 'A beautiful voice!' she exclaimed. 'Pray, why do you want a beautiful voice?'  \"'So that I can express my happiness in the most beautiful way I know of,--by singing,' replied Mr. Toad.  \"'You shall have it,' declared Old Mother Nature, 'but not all the time lest you be tempted to forget your work, which, you know, is the real source of true happiness. In the spring of each year you shall go back to your home in the water, and there for a time you shall sing to your heart's content, and there shall be no sweeter voice than yours.'  \"Sure enough, when the next spring came, Mr. Toad was filled with a great longing to go home. When he got there, he found that in his throat was a little music bag; and when he swelled it out, he had one of the sweetest voices in the world. And so it has been ever since with the Toad family. Old Mr. Toad is one of the sweetest singers in the Smiling Pool, but when it is time to go back to work he never grumbles, but is one of the most faithful workers in Mother Nature's garden,\" concluded Jerry Muskrat.  Peter sighed. \"I never could work,\" said he. \"Perhaps that is why I cannot sing.\"  \"Very likely,\" replied Jerry Muskrat, quite forgetting that he cannot sing himself although he is a great worker.                                       IV                    HOW OLD MR. CROW LOST HIS DOUBLE TONGUE                                       IV                    HOW OLD MR. CROW LOST HIS DOUBLE TONGUE   \"Caw, caw, caw, caw!\" Blacky the Crow sat in the top of a tall tree and seemed trying to see just how much noise he could make with that harsh voice of his. Peter Rabbit peered out from the dear Old Briar-patch and frowned.  \"If I had a voice as unpleasant as that, I'd forget I could talk. Yes, Sir, I'd forget I had a tongue,\" declared Peter.  Somebody laughed, and Peter turned quickly to find Jimmy Skunk. \"What are you laughing at?\" demanded Peter.  \"At the idea of you forgetting that you had a tongue,\" replied Jimmy.  \"Well, I would if I had a voice like Blacky's,\" persisted Peter, although he grinned a wee bit foolishly as he looked at Jimmy Skunk, for you know Peter is a great gossip.  \"It's lucky for you that you haven't then,\" retorted Jimmy. \"I'm afraid that you would lose your tongue just as old Mr. Crow did.\"  That sounded like a story. Right away Peter sat up and took notice. \"Did old Mr. Crow really lose his tongue? How did he lose it? Why did he lose it? When--\"  Jimmy Skunk clapped a hand over each ear and pretended that he was going to run away. Peter jumped in front of him. \"No, you don't!\" he cried. \"You've just got to tell me that story, Jimmy Skunk.\"  \"What story?\" asked Jimmy, as if he hadn't the least idea in the world what Peter was talking about, though of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21298"],["title","The Black Tor: A Tale of the Reign of James the First (#1)"],["body","a dirty hand upon his shoulder, and gripped him fast, turning the lad into a walking-staff to help him on his road.  \"Have you come far this morning?\" said Ralph, to conceal his disgust.  \"Ay, miles and miles, over stones and streams, and in and out among mines and holes.  We were benighted, too, up yonder on the mountain.\"  \"Hill,\" said Ralph; \"we have no mountains here.\"  \"Hills when you're fresh, lad; mountains when you're footsore and weary. But we stumbled upon a niche, in a bit of a slope near the top, and turned out the bats and foxes, and slept there.\"  \"Where?\" cried Ralph quickly.  \"Was there a little stream running there--warm water?\"  \"To be sure there was.  Hard stones, and warm water: those were our bed and beverage last night.\"  \"I know the place.  Darch Scarr.\"  \"Fine scar, too, lad.  Been better if it had been healed up, with a door to keep out the cold wind.  Oh! so this is where my old comrade lives,\" he added, as he came in sight of an arched gateway, with embattled top and turrets, while through the entry, a tree-shaded courtyard could be seen.  \"And a right good dwelling too.  Come on, brave boys.  Here's rest and breakfast at last.\"  \"And I hope you'll go directly after,\" thought Ralph, as he led the way into the courtyard, and paused at a second entrance, at the top of a flight of stone steps, well commanded by loopholes on either side.  Then aloud:  \"Will you wait here a minute, while I go and tell my father?\"  \"Yes: tell him his old brother-officer is here.\"  \"I did not catch your name when you spoke before,\" said Ralph.  \"Captain Pearl Ross?\"  \"Nay, nay, boy; Purlrose.  He'll know directly you speak.  Tell him, I'm waiting to grasp him by the hand.\"  Ralph nodded, and sprang up the stone flight, while the visitor's companions threw themselves down upon the steps to rest, their leader remaining standing, and placing himself by the mounting stone on one side, hand upon sword-hilt, and arranging his ragged cloak in folds with as much care as if it had been of newest velvet.    CHAPTER TWO.  SIR MORTON RECEIVES HIS GUEST.  \"Father can't be pleased,\" thought the lad, as he hurried in through a heavy oaken door, strengthened by the twisted and scrolled iron bands of the huge hinges, and studded with great-headed nails.  This yielded heavily, as, seizing a ring which moved a lever, he raised the heavy latch, and for a moment, as he passed through, he hesitated about closing the door again upon the group below.  But as he glanced at the party, he hesitated no longer.  Their appearance begat no confidence, and the great latch clicked directly.  The next minute, he was hurrying along a dark stone passage, to spring up a few more stairs, leading into a corridor with a polished oaken floor, and mullioned windows looking down upon the courtyard; and as he reached the second, a bright, handsome girl, whose features proclaimed sisterhood, started out to meet him.  \"Oh Ralph,\" she said, \"who are those dreadful-looking men you have brought up?\"  \"Don't stop me, Min,\" he said hastily.  \"Old soldiers who want to see father.  Where is he?\"  \"In his room.\"  The lad hurried on, and entered through a door way on his left, to where, in an oaken-panelled room, a stern, slightly grey, military-looking man sat poring over an old book, but looked up directly the lad entered.  \"Ah, Ralph, boy,\" he said; \"been out?\"  \"Only on the cliff, father,\" cried the lad hastily.  \"Visitors.\"  \"Visitors?  Nonsense!  I expect no visitors.  Who are they?\"  \"Captain Purlrose and his men.\"  \"Purlrose!\" cried Sir Morton, with a look of angry disgust.  \"Here?\"  \"Yes, father,\" said Ralph, watching keenly the impression made by his words.  \"Waiting at the foot of the steps.\"  \"Bah!  I thought the drunken, bullying scoundrel was dead and gone years ago.  Hung or shot, for he deserved either.\"  \"Hah!\" ejaculated the lad, with a sigh of relief.  \"Then you are not glad to see him, father?\"  \"Glad to see him?  Are you mad, boy?\"  \"No, father,\" said the lad, with a merry laugh.  \"I hope not; but he said you would be, and that you were old brothers-in-arms, and that he longed to grip you by the hand; and he tried to hug me, and shed tears, and flattered me, and said all sorts of things.\"  \"Pah! the same as of old; but you said--and his men.\"  \"Yes, about a dozen like him; ruffianly-looking, rag-bags of fellows, all armed, and looking like a gang of bullies and robbers.\"  Sir Morton frowned, rose from his seat, and walked to the side of the room, where his sword and belt lay in front of a bookcase.  \"Well, I suppose I must see the fellow.  He served under me, years ago, Ralph, and I suppose he has come begging, unless he sees a chance to steal.\"  \"Then I was not unjust, father, in thinking ill of the man and disliking him.\"  \"Unjust?  Pah!  The fellow was a disgrace to the name of soldier; and now, I suppose, that there is no war on the way, he has been discharged from the king's service, with a pack of his companions.\"  \"He said he had saved your life, father.\"  Sir Morton laughed contemptuously.  \"I have no recollection of the fact, Ralph, boy, and I don't think I should have forgotten so important a matter; but I do recollect saving his, by interceding when he was about to be shot for plundering some helpless people.  There; let him and a couple of his men come in.  The poor wretch is in a bad state, I suppose, and I will give him something to help him on his road.\"  Ralph went to the door, but turned back, hesitating.  \"Well, my boy?\" said his father.  \"Had I not better tell some of the men to arm, and be ready?\" asked the lad.  \"What!  Nonsense, boy!  I know my man.  He would not dare to be insolent.\"  \"But he has a dangerous-looking gang of fellows with him.\"  \"Of the same kind as himself, Ralph.  Have no fear of that.  If there were real danger, we could soon summon a dozen stout men to deal with him and his party.  But, as I said, let him only bring in two or three with him.\"  Ralph hurried out, and found the captain and his men forming a picturesque group about the stone steps; and as soon as he appeared, the former swung himself round, and threw his cloak over his shoulder, with a swaggering gesture.  \"Hallo, my young eagle,\" he cried.  \"What saith the parent bird, the gallant lord of the castle?\"  \"My father will see you, sir,\" replied Ralph.  \"This way.\"  \"Aha!  I knew he would,\" cried the man, giving his steel cap a cock over on one side, and displaying a large pink patch of his bald head.  \"Come on, brave boys.\"  \"Stop!\" cried Ralph quickly.  \"Three of you, only, are to accompany your leader.\"  \"Eh?  What?\" cried the captain fiercely, as a low murmur arose.  \"That is what my father said, sir.\"  \"What does this mean?\" cried the man theatrically.  \"Separate me from my brave companions-in-arms?  Does this mean treachery, young sir?\"  \"Treachery?  Why should it mean that?\" cried Ralph stoutly, as the man's words endorsed the character so lately given of him.  \"If,\" argued Ralph to himself, \"the fellow were the honest, brave soldier, why should he fear treachery from the brother-officer with whom he said he had often shared danger?\"  \"The world is full of wickedness, boy,\" replied the captain; \"and I have often been misjudged.  But there; a brave man never knows fear.  You three come with me, and if in half an hour I do not come back, boys, you know what to do.\"  There was a shout at this, and hands struck sword-hilts with a loud clang.  \"Right, brave boys, and don't leave one stone upon another until you have found your captain.\"  Ralph burst out into a fit of laughter, and then felt annoyed with himself, as the man turned round scowling.  \"What do you mean by that, boy?\"  \"That your men would have their work cut out, sir,\" said Ralph sharply. \"This way, please.\"  The captain uttered a low growl, signed to three of his men, and the party followed the lad, who, to his annoyance, once more came across his sister, hurrying along the passage.  \"Salute, brave boys, salute,\" cried the captain.  \"Youth and beauty in front--the worship of the gallant soldiers of the king.\"  He struck an attitude, which was roughly imitated by the men.  \"A sister, on my life,\" cried the captain.  \"This way,\" said Ralph shortly, and with the colour coming into his cheeks, as he felt indignant with the man for daring to notice his sister, and angry with her for being there.  The door of Sir Morton's room was thrown open, and the captain strode in, followed by his men; and, as he saw the knight, standing with his back to the fireplace, he struck a fresh attitude.  \"Ah! at last!\" he cried.  \"My old brave companion-in-arms!  Well met, once more.\"  He stretched out his hands, and swaggered forward to grasp Sir Morton's.  \"Halt!\" cried that gentleman sharply, without stirring from his position.  \"Now, Captain Purlrose, what is your business with me?\"  \"Business with you?  Is this my reception, after long years of absence? Ah, I see!  The war-worn soldier forgotten once again.  Ah, Sir Morton Darley, why humble me before my gallant men?\"  \"I have not forgotten you, Captain Purlrose.  I remember you perfectly, and you are not changed in the least.  Now, if you please, be brief, and explain your business.\"  \"My business!  I thought I was coming to an old friend and brother.\"  \"No, sir; you thought nothing of the kind.  Come, you know I understand you thoroughly.  State your business, if you please.\"  The three men laughed aloud, and Sir Morton, who had not before noticed them, turned upon them sharply, with the result that the laughter died out, and they looked uncomfortable.  \"And this before my men!  Humbled thus!  Have I fallen so low?\"  \"You are wasting words, Captain Purlrose; and, as you have found where I lived, and have evidently journeyed long, tell me at once why you have come.\"  \"I will,\" cried the captain, resuming his swaggering air.  \"I, as an old soldier, sir, came to ask favours of no man.\"  \"Then why have you come, sir, if not to ask a favour?\""]]]
