It is ours to chronicle the story of an humble expedition of this kind--the adventures of a young plant-hunter, the _employe_ of an enterprising \"seedsman\" well-known in the world's metropolis.    CHAPTER TWO.  A VIEW FROM CHUMULARI.  Our scene lies in the very heart of the Himalayas--in that district of them least explored by English travellers, though not the most distant from the Anglo-Indian capital, Calcutta.  Almost due north of this city, and in that portion of the Himalayan ranges embraced by the great bend of the Burrampooter, may be found the spot upon which our interest is to be fixed.  Literally may it be termed a spot, when compared in superficies with the vast extent of wilderness that surrounds it--a wilderness of bleak, barren ridges, of glistening glaciers, of snow-clad summits, soaring one above another, or piled incongruously together like cumuli in the sky.  In the midst of this chaos of rock, ice, and snow, Chumulari raises his majestic summit, crowned and robed in white, as becomes his sacred character.  Around are other forms, his acolytes and attendants, less in stature, but mighty mountains nevertheless, and, like him, wearing the vestment of everlasting purity.  Could you stand upon the top of Chumulari, you would have under your eye, and thousands of feet below your feet, the scene of our narrative-- the arena in which its various incidents were enacted.  Not so unlike an amphitheatre would that scene appear--only differing from one, in the small number of the _dramatis persona_, and the entire absence of spectators.  From the top of Chumulari, looking down among the foot hills of this majestic mountain, you might behold a valley of a singular character--so singular as at once to fix your attention.  You would note that it is of a regular oval shape; and that instead of being bounded by sloping declivities, it is girt by an almost vertical cliff that appears to be continuous all around it.  This cliff of dark granitic rock you might guess with your eye to rise several hundred feet sheer from the bottom of the valley.  If it were in the season of summer, you might further observe, that receding from its brow a dark-coloured declivity of the mountain rises still higher, terminating all around in peaks and ridges--which, being above the snow-line are continually covered with the pale white mantle that has fallen upon them from the heavens.  These details would be taken in at the first glance; and then your eye would wander into the valley below, and rest there--fixed by the singularity of the scene, and charmed by its soft loveliness--so strongly contrasting with the rude surroundings on which you had been hitherto gazing.  The form of the valley would suggest the existence of the grand elliptical crater of some extinct volcano.  But instead of the black sulphuric _scoria_, that you might expect to see strewed over its base, you behold a verdant landscape of smiling loveliness, park-like plains interposed with groves and copses, here and there a mound of rock-work, as if piled artificially and for ornament.  Around the cliffs appears a belt of forest of darker green; and occupying the centre a limpid lake, on whose silver surface at a certain hour of the day you might see reflected part of the snow-crowned summit on which you are standing--the cone of Chumulari itself.  With a good glass you might distinguish quadrupeds of several _species_ straying over the verdant pastures; birds of many kinds upon the wing, and others disporting themselves upon the surface of the lake.  You would be tempted to look for a grand mansion.  You would send your glance in every direction, expecting to see chimneys and turrets overtopping the trees; but in this you would be disappointed.  On one side of the valley, near to the base of its bounding cliff, you might see a white vapour ascending from the surface of the earth.  It would be an error to believe it smoke.  It is not that--only the _rime_ rising over a hot-spring bubbling out from the rocks and forming the little rivulet, that, like a silver string, connects it with the lake.  Charmed with the view of this lovely valley, you would desire to visit it.  You would descend the long slope of Chumulari, and straggling through the labyrinth of rugged foot hills that surround it, you would reach the brow of the bounding precipice; but there you must come to a halt.  No path leads downward; and if you are still determined to set foot on the shores of that smiling lake, you will have to make the descent of the cliffs by means of a rope or rope-ladder several hundred feet in length.  With comrades to help you, you may accomplish this; but once in the valley, you can only get out of it by remounting your rope-ladder: for you will find no other means of exit.  At one end of the valley you may perceive a gap in the cliffs; and fancy that through this you may make your way out to the side of the mountain. The gap may be easily reached, by going up a gentle acclivity; but having passed through it, you will discover that it only guides you into a gorge, like the valley itself, bounded on both sides by precipitous cliff's.  This gorge is half filled by a glacier; on the surface of which you may pass for a certain distance downward.  At the end of that descent you will find the glacier cut by a deep crevasse, a hundred feet in depth and a hundred in width.  Without bridging the crevasse, you can go no further; and if you did succeed in bridging it, further down you would find others deeper and wider, over which it would be impossible for you to pass.  Return then, and examine the singular valley into which you have made your way.  You will find there trees of many kinds, quadrupeds of many kinds, birds of many kinds, and insects of many kinds--you will find every form of animal life, except that of the human being.  If you find not man, however, you may discover traces of him.  Close to the hot-spring, and forming a sort of \"lean-to\" against the cliff, you may observe a rude hut built with blocks of stone, and plastered with mud from the bed of the rivulet.  Enter it.  You will find it empty, cold, untenanted by living thing.  No furniture.  Stone couches covered with sedge and grass, upon which men may have slept or lain; and two or three blocks of granite upon which they may have sat.  That is all.  Some pieces of skin hanging around the walls, and the bones of animals strewed over the ground outside, give a clue to the kind of food upon which the inhabitants of the hut may have subsisted.  Hunters they must have been.  That will be your natural conjecture.  But how did they get into this valley, and how got they out of it?  Of course, like yourself, they descended into it, and then ascended out again, by means of a rope-ladder.  That would be the explanation at which you would arrive; and it would be a satisfactory one, but for a circumstance that just now comes under your observation.  Scanning the _facade_ of the cliff, your eye is arrested by a singular appearance.  You perceive a serried line, or rather a series of serried lines, running from the base in a vertical direction.  On drawing nearer to these curious objects, you discover them to be ladders--the lowest set upon the earth, and reaching to a ledge, upon which the second is rested; this one extending to a second ledge, on which the third ladder finds support; and so on throughout a whole series of six.  At first sight, it would appear to you as if the _ci-devant_ denizens of the hut had made their exodus from the valley by means of these ladders; and such would be the natural conviction, but for a circumstance that forbids belief in this mode of exit: _the ladders do not continue to the top of the cliff_!  A long space, which would require two or three more such ladders to span it, still intervenes between the top of the highest and the brow of the precipice; and this could not have been scaled without additional ladders.  Where are they?  It is scarcely probable they had been drawn up; and had they fallen back into the valley, they would still be there.  There are none upon the ground.  But these conjectures do not require to be continued.  A short examination of the cliff suffices to convince you that the design of scaling it by ladders could not have succeeded.  The ledge against which rests the top of the highest must have been found too narrow to support another; or rather, the rocks above and projecting over would render it impossible to place a ladder upon this ledge.  It is evident that the scheme had been tried and abandoned.  The very character of the attempt proves that they who had made it must have been placed in a desperate situation--imprisoned within that cliff-girt valley, with no means of escaping from it, except such as they themselves might devise.  Moreover, after a complete exploration of the place, you can find no evidence that they ever did escape from their strange prison; and your thoughts can only shape themselves into conjectures, as to who they were that had wandered into this out-of-the-way corner of the world; how they got into, and how out of it; and, finally, whether they ever succeeded in getting out at all.  Your conjectures will come to an end, when you have read the history of the _Cliff-climbers_.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE PLANT-HUNTER AND HIS COMPANIONS.  Karl Linden, a young German student, who had taken part in the revolutionary struggles of 1848, had by the act of banishment sought an asylum in London.  Like most refugees, he was without means; but, instead of giving himself up to idle habits, he had sought and obtained employment in one of those magnificent \"nurseries\" which are to be met with in the suburbs of the world's metropolis.  His botanical knowledge soon attracted the attention of his employer, the proprietor of the nursery--one of those enterprising and spirited men who, instead of contenting themselves with merely cultivating the trees"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21239"],["title","The Cliff Climbers (#2)"],["body","flowering-plants already introduced into our gardens and greenhouses, expend large sums of money in sending emissaries to all parts of the earth, to discover and bring home other rare and beautiful kinds.  These emissaries--botanical collectors, or \"plant-hunters,\" as they may be called--in the pursuit of their calling, have explored, and are still engaged in exploring, the wildest and most remote countries of the globe--such as the deep, dark forests upon the Amazon, the Orinoco, and the Oregon in America; the hot equatorial regions of Africa; the tropical jungles of India; the rich woods of the Oriental islands; and, in short, wherever there is a prospect of discovering and obtaining new floral or sylvan beauties.  The exploration of the Sikhim Himalaya by the accomplished botanist, Hooker--recorded in a book of travels not inferior to that of the great Humboldt--had drawn attention to the rich and varied _flora_ of these mountains; and in consequence of this, the enterprising \"seedsman\" who had given Karl Linden temporary employment in his garden, promoted him to a higher and more agreeable field of labour, by sending him as a \"plant-hunter\" to the Thibetan Himalayas.  Accompanied by his brother, Caspar, the young botanist proceeded to Calcutta; and, after a short residence there, he set out for the Himalayas--taking a direction almost due north from the city of the Ganges.  He had provided himself with a guide, in the person of a celebrated Hindoo hunter or \"shikaree,\" called Ossaroo; and this individual was the sole attendant and companion of the two brothers--with the exception of a large dog, of the boar-hound species, which had been brought with them from Europe, and that answered to the name of Fritz.  The young botanist had come to India furnished with a letter of introduction to the manager of the Botanical Garden of Calcutta--an establishment of world-wide renown.  There he had been hospitably received on his arrival in the Oriental city; and during his sojourn he had spent much of his time within its boundaries.  Moreover, the authorities of the place, interested in his expedition, had given him all the information in their power as to the route he intended pursuing--though that was not much: for the portion of the Himalayas he was about to explore was at that time a _terra incognita_ to Englishmen--even in the city of Calcutta!  It is not necessary here to detail the many adventures that befel our plant-hunter and his party, during the progress of their journey towards the Himalayas, and after they had entered within the grand gorges of these mountains.  Suffice it to say, that in pursuit of a beautiful little animal--a \"musk-deer\"--they had gone up a gully filled by one of those grand glaciers so common in the higher Himalayas; that the pursuit had led them far up the ravine, and afterwards conducted them into a singular crater-like valley--the one already described; that once in this valley, they could find no way out of it, but by the ravine through which they had entered; and that on returning to make their exit, they discovered to their great consternation that a crevasse in the glacier, over which they had passed, had opened during their absence, and to such an extent as to render their exit impossible!  They had endeavoured to span this crevasse; and had spent much time in making a bridge of pine-trees for the purpose.  They had succeeded at length in getting across the chasm--but only to find others in the glacier below, which no ingenuity could enable them to get over.  They were compelled to abandon the idea, and return again to the valley; which, though lovely to the eye, had now become hateful to their thoughts: since they knew it to be their _prison_.  During their residence in the place, many adventures befel them with wild animals of various kinds.  There chanced to be a small herd of \"yaks,\" or grunting oxen, in the valley; and these formed for a time the staple article of their food.  Caspar, who, though younger than Karl, was the more skilled hunter of the two, had a very narrow escape from the old yak bull; though he succeeded at length in killing the dangerous animal.  Ossaroo was very near being eaten up by a pack of wild dogs-- every one of which he afterwards succeeded in killing; and Ossaroo was also in danger of being swallowed up by an enemy of a very different kind--that is by a _quicksand_, into which he had got his legs while engaged in taking fish out of a net!  Karl was not without _his_ hair-breadth \"'scape\"--having been chased by a bear along a ledge of the cliff, from which he was compelled to make a most perilous descent.  The bear itself took refuge in a cave, where it was afterwards pursued and killed, by all three acting in concert, materially assisted by the dog Fritz.  They had incurred great risk in this chase of the bear: for although they had succeeded in destroying the formidable animal they lost themselves in the great labyrinthine cavern, and were only able to find their way out by making a fire with the stocks of their guns, and rendering the bear's-grease available for candles--which fortunately enabled them to extricate themselves.  During the pursuit of the bear, and their subsequent endeavours to find their way out, our adventurers had been struck by the enormous dimensions of the cavern in which the animal had taken refuge; and in the hope that some of its great galleries might lead out through the mountain, and offer them a way of escape from the valley, they had made torches, and explored it from end to end.  It was all to no purpose; and becoming satisfied that there was no exit by way of the cavern, they had at length desisted from the search.  From this point shall we continue, in more circumstantial detail, the history of their attempts to escape from their mountain prison; which they were now convinced could only be done by _climbing the cliff_ that encircled it.  The Cliff Climbers--by Captain Mayne Reid    CHAPTER FOUR.  HOME TO THE HUT.  Emerging from the cave after their fruitless exploration, all three-- Karl, Caspar, and Ossaroo--sat down upon the rocks in front of the cliff, and for some time remained silent.  The looks of all betokened a deep and hopeless despair.  The same thought was passing in their minds. A painful thought it was--that they were completely cut off from all communication with the world, and might never again look on human faces, save their own!  Caspar was the first to give expression to this gloomy foreboding.  \"Oh, brother!\" groaned he, addressing himself to Karl, who sat nearest to him, \"oh! it is an awful fate!  Here must we live, here must we die, far away from home, far away from the world--alone--alone!\"  \"No,\" replied Karl, deeply moved by the distress of his brother, \"no, Caspar, not alone--God is with us.  Let Him be our world.\"  However Caspar in his conscience might have acknowledged the justice of the admonition, it failed to cheer him.  Indeed, he could not help perceiving, that Karl had uttered the speech half doubtingly, and with the design of affording consolation.  Moreover, the effort which Karl was making to look hopeful and cheerful was evidently constrained; and only the more convinced his companions that neither hope nor joy was in his breast.  To Karl's consolatory words his brother made no rejoinder.  Ossaroo, however, gave vent to his thoughts by an ambiguous shake of the head, and a brief speech characteristic of that belief in fatalism peculiar to his race.  \"Ah, sahibs,\" said he, addressing himself to both, \"if the Great Sahib in the sky will we go out from here, we go--if He no will, we no go-- nivvamore.\"  Ossaroo's speech, however compatible with a true faith, did not contribute much towards cheering the spirits of the party; and for another long interval all remained silent.  Caspar and Ossaroo appeared completely prostrated by the new disappointment.  Karl, on the other hand, seemed less disposed to view things despairingly; and as he sate, was evidently engaged in active thought.  After awhile his companions observed this; though neither made any attempt to rouse him from his reverie.  They guessed, that, whatever was passing in his mind would soon be communicated to them.  They were right in this conjecture: for in a few minutes Karl terminated the silence by addressing them.  \"Come!\" said he, speaking in a tone of encouragement, \"we are wrong in so soon yielding to despair.  Let us not give up, till we are beaten at all points.  I have told you what my object was, when I first mounted upon that ledge, and discovered the cave and its surly occupant, the bear.  I thought then, that, if we could find a series of ledges one above another, and sufficiently near each other, we might plant ladders upon them, and so reach the top.  You see that there is such a succession of ledges--just before your faces there.  Unfortunately there is one of the spaces high up yonder--where the cliff is darkest--that cannot be less than sixty or seventy feet in width.  I have ascertained that by comparing it with the height from the ground to the cave--which I had just finished measuring when I met the bear.  It would be impossible for us to make a ladder that length--or even to hoist it up there if made--so that all thought of scaling the cliff at this point must be given up.\"  \"Perhaps,\" interposed Caspar, catching at Karl's idea, \"there may be some other part of the precipice where the ledges are nearer to each other?  Did you examine it all around?\"  \"No.  I had got no further than this place, when I met Master Bruin; and, as you know, our adventures with him and our exploration of the cave have taken up our time ever since, and, indeed, driven the design of the ladders quite out of my head.  Now, however, we may return to it; and our next move will be to go all round, and see whether a better place may not be discovered.  To-night it is too late.  It already begins to darken; and we must"]]]
