He took the girl's arm gently, and without questioning she accompanied him to the car ahead, the man in the raincoat following. No word was spoken, and Lydia was too bewildered to ask questions until the car was on its way. Then the younger man chuckled.  \"Clever, Rennett!\" he said. \"I tell you, those people are super-humanly brilliant!\"  \"I'm not a great admirer of villainy,\" said the other gruffly, and the younger man, who was sitting opposite the girl, laughed.  \"You must take a detached interest, my dear chap. Personally, I admire them. I admit they gave me a fright when I realised that Miss Beale had not called the cab, but that it had been carefully planted for her, but still I can admire them.\"  \"What does it mean?\" asked the puzzled girl. \"I'm so confused--where are we going now? To the office?\"  \"I fear you will not get to the office to-night,\" said the young man calmly, \"and it is impossible to explain to you just why you were abducted.\"  \"Abducted?\" said the girl incredulously. \"Do you mean to say that man----\"  \"He was carrying you into the country,\" said the other calmly. \"He would probably have travelled all night and have left you stranded in some un-get-at-able place. I don't think he meant any harm--they never take unnecessary risks, and all they wanted was to spirit you away for the night. How they came to know that we had chosen you baffles me,\" he said. \"Can you advance any theory, Rennett?\"  \"Chosen me?\" repeated the startled girl. \"Really, I feel I'm entitled to some explanation, and if you don't mind, I would like you to take me back to my office. I have a job to keep,\" she added grimly.  \"Six pounds ten a week, and a few guineas extra for your illustrations,\" said the man in the raincoat. \"Believe me, Miss Beale, you'll never pay off your debts on that salary, not if you live to be a hundred.\"  She could only gasp.  \"You seem to know a great deal about my private affairs,\" she said, when she had recovered her breath.  \"A great deal more than you can imagine.\"  She guessed he was smiling in the darkness, and his voice was so gentle and apologetic that she could not take offence.  \"In the past twelve months you have had thirty-nine judgments recorded against you, and in the previous year, twenty-seven. You are living on exactly thirty shillings a week, and all the rest is going to your father's creditors.\"  \"You're very impertinent!\" she said hotly and, as she felt, foolishly.  \"I'm very pertinent, really. By the way, my name is Glover--John Glover, of the firm of Rennett, Glover and Simpson. The gentleman at your side is Mr. Charles Rennett, my senior partner. We are a firm of solicitors, but how long we shall remain a firm,\" he added pointedly, \"depends rather upon you.\"  \"Upon me?\" said the girl in genuine astonishment. \"Well, I can't say that I have so much love for lawyers----\"  \"That I can well understand,\" murmured Mr. Glover.  \"But I certainly do not wish to dissolve your partnership,\" she went on.  \"It is rather more serious than that,\" said Mr. Rennett, who was sitting by her side. \"The fact is, Miss Beale, we are acting in a perfectly illegal manner, and we are going to reveal to you the particulars of an act we contemplate, which, if you pass on the information to the police, will result in our professional ruin. So you see this adventure is infinitely more important to us than at present it is to you. And here we are!\" he said, interrupting the girl's question.  The car turned into a narrow drive, and proceeded some distance through an avenue of trees before it pulled up at the pillared porch of a big house.  Rennett helped her to alight and ushered her through the door, which opened almost as they stopped, into a large panelled hall.  \"This is the way, let me show you,\" said the younger man.  He opened a door and she found herself in a big drawing-room, exquisitely furnished and lit by two silver electroliers suspended from the carved roof.  To her relief an elderly woman rose to greet her.  \"This is my wife, Miss Beale,\" said Rennett. \"I need hardly explain that this is also my home.\"  \"So you found the young lady,\" said the elderly lady, smiling her welcome, \"and what does Miss Beale think of your proposition?\"  The young man Glover came in at that moment, and divested of his long raincoat and hat, he proved to be of a type that the Universities turn out by the hundred. He was good-looking too, Lydia noticed with feminine inconsequence, and there was something in his eyes that inspired trust. He nodded with a smile to Mrs. Rennett, then turned to the girl.  \"Now Miss Beale, I don't know whether I ought to explain or whether my learned and distinguished friend prefers to save me the trouble.\"  \"Not me,\" said the elder man hastily. \"My dear,\" he turned to his wife, \"I think we'll leave Jack Glover to talk to this young lady.\"  \"Doesn't she know?\" asked Mrs. Rennett in surprise, and Lydia laughed, although she was feeling far from amused.  The possible loss of her employment, the disquieting adventure of the evening, and now this further mystery all combined to set her nerves on edge.  Glover waited until the door closed on his partner and his wife and seemed inclined to wait a little longer, for he stood with his back to the fire, biting his lips and looking down thoughtfully at the carpet.  \"I don't just know how to begin, Miss Beale,\" he said. \"And having seen you, my conscience is beginning to work overtime. But I might as well start at the beginning. I suppose you have heard of the Bulford murder?\"  The girl stared at him.  \"The Bulford murder?\" she said incredulously, and he nodded.  \"Why, of course, everybody has heard of that.\"  \"Then happily it is unnecessary to explain all the circumstances,\" said Jack Glover, with a little grimace of distaste.  \"I only know,\" interrupted the girl, \"that Mr. Bulford was killed by a Mr. Meredith, who was jealous of him, and that Mr. Meredith, when he went into the witness-box, behaved disgracefully to his fianc√©e.\"  \"Exactly,\" nodded Glover with a twinkle in his eye. \"In other words, he repudiated the suggestion that he was jealous, swore that he had already told Miss Briggerland that he could not marry her, and he did not even know that Bulford was paying attention to the lady.\"  \"He did that to save his life,\" said Lydia quietly. \"Miss Briggerland swore in the witness-box that no such interview had occurred.\"  Glover nodded.  \"What you do not know, Miss Beale,\" he said gravely, \"is that Jean Briggerland was Meredith's cousin, and unless certain things happen, she will inherit the greater part of six hundred thousand pounds from Meredith's estate. Meredith, I might explain, is one of my best friends, and the fact that he is now serving out a life sentence does not make him any less a friend. I am as sure, as I am sure of your sitting there, that he no more killed Bulford than I did. I believe the whole thing was a plot to secure his death or imprisonment. My partner thinks the same. The truth is that Meredith was engaged to this girl; he discovered certain things about her and her father which are not greatly to their credit. He was never really in love with her, beautiful as she is, and he was trapped into the proposal. When he found out how things were shaping and heard some of the queer stories which were told about Briggerland and his daughter, he broke off the engagement and went that night to tell her so.\"  The girl had listened in some bewilderment to this recital.  \"I don't exactly see what all this is to do with me,\" she said, and again Jack Glover nodded.  \"I can quite understand,\" he said, \"but I will tell you yet another part of the story which is not public property. Meredith's father was an eccentric man who believed in early marriages, and it was a condition of his will that if Meredith was not married by his thirtieth birthday, the money should go to his sister, her heirs and successors. His sister was Mrs. Briggerland, who is now dead. Her heirs are her husband and Jean Briggerland.\"  There was a silence. The girl stared thoughtfully into the fire.  \"How old is Mr. Meredith?\"  \"He is thirty next Monday,\" said Glover quietly, \"and it is necessary that he should be married before next Monday.\"  \"In prison?\" she asked.  He shook his head.  \"If such things are allowed that could have been arranged, but for some reason the Home Secretary refuses to exercise his discretion in this matter, and has resolutely refused to allow such a marriage to take place. He objects on the ground of public policy, and I dare say from his point of view he is right. Meredith has a twenty-years sentence to serve.\"  \"Then how----\" began Lydia.  \"Let me tell this story more or less understandably,\" said Glover with that little smile of his. \"Believe me, Miss Beale, I'm not so keen upon the scheme as I was. If by chance,\" he spoke deliberately, \"we could get James Meredith into this house to-morrow morning, would you marry him?\"  \"Me?\" she gasped. \"Marry a man I've not seen--a murderer?\"  \"Not a murderer,\" he said gently.  \"But it is preposterous, impossible!\" she protested. \"Why me?\"  He was silent for a moment.  \"When this scheme was mooted we looked round for some one to whom such a marriage would be of advantage,\" he said, speaking slowly. \"It was Rennett's idea that we should search the County Court records of London to discover if there was a girl who was in urgent need of money. There is no surer way of unearthing financial skeletons than by searching County Court records. We found four, only one of whom was eligible and that was you. Don't interrupt me for a moment, please,\" he said, raising his hand warningly as she was about to speak. \"We have made thorough inquiries about you, too thorough in fact, because the Briggerlands have smelt a rat, and have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21555"],["title","The Mission; or Scenes in Africa (#1)"],["body"," it, and there is reason to believe that all did not perish who were accounted as dead.  If you have nothing particularly to engage you at this moment, I will enter into a detail of what did occur, and of the proofs that the fate of a large portion, among which that of your aunt Elizabeth, was never ascertained.\"  \"If it will not be too painful to you, my dear uncle, I will most gladly hear it.\"  \"I will not dwell longer upon it than is necessary, Alexander; believe me the subject is too distressing, but I wish you to know it also, and then to give me your opinion.  You are of course aware that it was on the coast of Caffraria, to the southward of Port Natal, that the _Grosvenor_ was wrecked.  She soon divided and went to pieces, but by a sudden--I know not that I can say a _fortunate_--change of wind, yet such was the will of Heaven,--the whole of the crew and passengers (with the exception of sixteen who had previously attempted to gain the shore by a hawser, and one man who was left on board in a state of intoxication) were all safely landed, even to the little children who were coming home in the vessel; among whom was my poor Elizabeth.\"  Alexander made no observation when Sir Charles paused for a while: the latter then continued:--  \"By the time that they had all gained the shore, the day was far spent; the natives, who were of the Caffre race, and who had been busy in obtaining all the iron that they could from the mainmast, which had drifted on shore, left the beach at dark.  The wretched sufferers lighted fires, and having collected some casks of beef and flour, and some live stock, they remained on the rocks daring that night.  The next morning the captain proposed that they should make their way to Cape Town, the Dutch settlement, to which they all unanimously consented; certainly a most wild proposition, and showing very little judgment.\"  \"Could they have done otherwise, my dear uncle?\"  \"Most certainly; they knew that they were in a country of lawless savages, who had already come down and taken by force everything that they could lay their hands upon.  The captain calculated that they would reach Cape Town in sixteen or seventeen days.  How far his calculation was correct, is proved by the fact that those who did reach it at last were one hundred and seventeen days on their journey.  But even admitting that the distance could have been performed in the time stated by the captain, the very idea of attempting to force their way through a country inhabited by savage people, with such a number of helpless women and children, and without any arms for their defence, was indeed an act of folly and madness, as it eventually proved.\"  \"What then should have been their plan?\"  \"Observe, Alexander, the ship was wrecked not a cable's length from the shore, firmly fixed upon a reef of rocks upon which she had been thrown; the water was smooth, and there was no difficulty in their communication.  The savages, content with plundering whatever was washed on shore, had to the time of their quitting the rocks left them uninjured.  They might have gone on board again, have procured arms to defend themselves and the means of fortifying their position against any attempt of the savages, who had no other weapons but assaguays or spears, and then might have obtained the provisions and other articles necessary for their support.  Armed as they might have been, and numerous as they were, for there were one hundred and fifty souls on board at the time of the wreck, they might have protected themselves until they had built boats or small vessels out of the timber of the wreck; for all their carpenters and blacksmiths were safely landed on shore with them.  By taking this course they might have coasted along shore, and have arrived without difficulty at the Cape.\"  \"Most certainly, sir, it would have been the most judicious plan.\"  \"The captain must have been very deficient in judgment to have acted as he did.  He had everything to his hand--the means--the men to build the boats--provisions, arms, sails, and cordage, and yet he threw all these chances away, and attempted to do what was impossible.\"  \"He was not one of those who were saved, I believe, sir?\"  \"No, he is one of those who have not been heard of;--but to proceed:-- The first day of their march from the site of the wreck ought to have been a warning to them to turn back.  The savages robbed them of everything and threw stones at them.  A Dutchman of the name of Trout, who had fled to the Caffre country for some murder he had committed in the colony, fell in with them and told them the attempt was impracticable, from the number of savage nations, the width of the rivers, the desert countries without water, and the number of wild beasts which they would encounter; but still they were not persuaded, and went on to their destruction.  They were not five miles from the wreck at that time, and might have returned to it before night.\"  \"May it not fairly be supposed that after such a dreadful shipwreck anything was considered preferable by the major portion of them, especially the passengers, to re-embarking?\"  \"It may be so; but still it was a feeling that was to be surmounted, and would have been, had they been counselled by a judicious leader; for he might fairly have pointed out to them,--without re-embarkation, how are you to arrive in England?\"  \"Very true, uncle.  Pray continue.\"  \"From the accounts given by the seamen who returned, before they had travelled a week they were attacked by a large party of natives, to whose blows and ill-treatment as they passed along they had hitherto submitted; but as in this instance the natives appeared determined to massacre them, they resisted as well as they could, and, being nearly one hundred men in force, succeeded in driving them off, not without receiving many severe wounds.  After a few days' more travelling, their provisions were all expended, and the seamen began to murmur, and resolve to take care of themselves, and not to be encumbered with women and children.  The consequence was, that forty-three of the number separated from the rest, leaving the captain and all the male and female passengers and children (my dear Elizabeth among them), to get on as they could.\"  \"How cruel!\"  \"Yes! but self-preservation is the first law of nature, and I fear it is in vain to expect that persons not under the influence of religious principles will risk their lives, or submit to much self-denial, for the sake of alleviating the miseries of others.  The reason given for this separation was, that it was impossible to procure food for so large a number, and that they would be more likely to obtain sustenance when divided.  The party who thus proceeded in advance encountered the most terrible difficulties; they coasted along the sea-shore because they had no other food than the shell-fish found on the rocks; they had continually to cross rivers from a mile to two miles wide; they were kept from their slumber by the wild beasts which prowled around them, and at length they endured so much from want of water, that their sufferings were extreme.  They again subdivided and separated, wandering they hardly knew where, exposed to a burning sun, without clothing and without food.  One by one they sat down and were left behind to die, or to be devoured by the wild beasts before they were dead.  At last they were reduced to such extremity, that they proposed to cast lots for one to be killed to support the others; they turned back on their route, that they might find the dead bodies of their companions for food. Finally, out of the whole crew, three or four, purblind and staggering from exhaustion, craving for death, arrived at the borders of the colony, where they were kindly received and gradually recovered.\"  \"You now speak of the first party who separated from the captain and the passengers, do you not, uncle?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And what became of the captain's party?\"  \"No tidings were heard of them; their fate was unknown; it was long supposed that they had all perished; for if the sufferings of the seamen, inured to toil and danger, had been so great, what chance was there for helpless women and children?  But after some years, there was a report that they had been saved, and were living with the savages.  Le Vaillant first mentioned it, and then it died away and was not credited; but since that, the reports of various travellers appear to give confirmation to what Le Vaillant asserted.  The paragraph you have now read in the newspaper has again renewed the assertion, and the parties from whom it proceeds are by all accounts worthy of credence.  You may imagine, my dear boy, what a pang it gives me when I read these reports,--when I reflect that my poor girl, who was with that party, may at this moment be alive, may have returned to a state of barbarism,--the seeds of faith long dead in her bosom,--now changed to a wild untutored savage, knowing no God.\"  \"But, my dear uncle, allowing that my aunt is alive, she was not so young at the time of the wreck as to forget entirely what she had been taught.\"  \"That is possible; but then her condition must be still more painful, or rather I should say must have been, for probably she is dead long before this, or if not dead, she must be a woman advanced in life; indeed, as you may observe in the account given by the traveller in the paragraph you have read, it speaks only of the _descendants_ of those who were lost in the _Grosvenor_.  The idea of my grandchildren having returned to a state of barbarism is painful enough; I wish it were possible that I could discover the truth, for it is the uncertainty which so much distresses me.  I have but a few years to live, Alexander; I am a very old man, as you know, and may be summoned to-morrow or to-night, for we know not what a day may bring forth.  If I were only certain that my child had died, miserable as her death must have been, it would be happiness, "]]]
