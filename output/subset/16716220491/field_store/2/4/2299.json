Sandals guarded his feet. Fifty years, probably more, had spent themselves upon him, with no other effect, apparently, than to tinge his demeanor with gravity and temper his words with forethought. The physical organization and the brightness of soul were untouched. No need to tell the student from what kindred he was sprung; if he came not himself from the groves of Athene’, his ancestry did.  When his arms fell from the Egyptian, the latter said, with a tremulous voice, “The Spirit brought me first; wherefore I know myself chosen to be the servant of my brethren. The tent is set, and the bread is ready for the breaking. Let me perform my office.”  Taking each by the hand, he led them within, and removed their sandals and washed their feet, and he poured water upon their hands, and dried them with napkins.  Then, when he had laved his own hands, he said, “Let us take care of ourselves, brethren, as our service requires, and eat, that we may be strong for what remains of the day’s duty. While we eat, we will each learn who the others are, and whence they come, and how they are called.”  He took them to the repast, and seated them so that they faced each other. Simultaneously their heads bent forward, their hands crossed upon their breasts, and, speaking together, they said aloud this simple grace:  “Father of all—God!—what we have here is of thee; take our thanks and bless us, that we may continue to do thy will.”  With the last word they raised their eyes, and looked at each other in wonder. Each had spoken in a language never before heard by the others; yet each understood perfectly what was said. Their souls thrilled with divine emotion; for by the miracle they recognized the Divine Presence.     CHAPTER III   To speak in the style of the period, the meeting just described took place in the year of Rome 747. The month was December, and winter reigned over all the regions east of the Mediterranean. Such as ride upon the desert in this season go not far until smitten with a keen appetite. The company under the little tent were not exceptions to the rule. They were hungry, and ate heartily; and, after the wine, they talked.  “To a wayfarer in a strange land nothing is so sweet as to hear his name on the tongue of a friend,” said the Egyptian, who assumed to be president of the repast. “Before us lie many days of companionship. It is time we knew each other. So, if it be agreeable, he who came last shall be first to speak.”  Then, slowly at first, like one watchful of himself, the Greek began:  “What I have to tell, my brethren, is so strange that I hardly know where to begin or what I may with propriety speak. I do not yet understand myself. The most I am sure of is that I am doing a Master’s will, and that the service is a constant ecstasy. When I think of the purpose I am sent to fulfil, there is in me a joy so inexpressible that I know the will is God’s.”  The good man paused, unable to proceed, while the others, in sympathy with his feelings, dropped their gaze.  “Far to the west of this,” he began again, “there is a land which may never be forgotten; if only because the world is too much its debtor, and because the indebtedness is for things that bring to men their purest pleasures. I will say nothing of the arts, nothing of philosophy, of eloquence, of poetry, of war: O my brethren, hers is the glory which must shine forever in perfected letters, by which He we go to find and proclaim will be made known to all the earth. The land I speak of is Greece. I am Gaspar, son of Cleanthes the Athenian.  “My people,” he continued, “were given wholly to study, and from them I derived the same passion. It happens that two of our philosophers, the very greatest of the many, teach, one the doctrine of a Soul in every man, and its Immortality; the other the doctrine of One God, infinitely just. From the multitude of subjects about which the schools were disputing, I separated them, as alone worth the labor of solution; for I thought there was a relation between God and the soul as yet unknown. On this theme the mind can reason to a point, a dead, impassable wall; arrived there, all that remains is to stand and cry aloud for help. So I did; but no voice came to me over the wall. In despair, I tore myself from the cities and the schools.”  At these words a grave smile of approval lighted the gaunt face of the Hindoo.  “In the northern part of my country—in Thessaly,” the Greek proceeded to say, “there is a mountain famous as the home of the gods, where Theus, whom my countrymen believe supreme, has his abode; Olympus is its name. Thither I betook myself. I found a cave in a hill where the mountain, coming from the west, bends to the southeast; there I dwelt, giving myself up to meditation—no, I gave myself up to waiting for what every breath was a prayer—for revelation. Believing in God, invisible yet supreme, I also believed it possible so to yearn for him with all my soul that he would take compassion and give me answer.”  “And he did—he did!” exclaimed the Hindoo, lifting his hands from the silken cloth upon his lap.  “Hear me, brethren,” said the Greek, calming himself with an effort. “The door of my hermitage looks over an arm of the sea, over the Thermaic Gulf. One day I saw a man flung overboard from a ship sailing by. He swam ashore. I received and took care of him. He was a Jew, learned in the history and laws of his people; and from him I came to know that the God of my prayers did indeed exist; and had been for ages their lawmaker, ruler, and king. What was that but the Revelation I dreamed of? My faith had not been fruitless; God answered me!”  “As he does all who cry to him with such faith,” said the Hindoo.  “But, alas!” the Egyptian added, “how few are there wise enough to know when he answers them!”  “That was not all,” the Greek continued. “The man so sent to me told me more. He said the prophets who, in the ages which followed the first revelation, walked and talked with God, declared he would come again. He gave me the names of the prophets, and from the sacred books quoted their very language. He told me, further, that the second coming was at hand—was looked for momentarily in Jerusalem.”  The Greek paused, and the brightness of his countenance faded.  “It is true,” he said, after a little—“it is true the man told me that as God and the revelation of which he spoke had been for the Jews alone, so it would be again. He that was to come should be King of the Jews. ‘Had he nothing for the rest of the world?’ I asked. ‘No,’ was the answer, given in a proud voice—‘No, we are his chosen people.’ The answer did not crush my hope. Why should such a God limit his love and benefaction to one land, and, as it were, to one family? I set my heart upon knowing. At last I broke through the man’s pride, and found that his fathers had been merely chosen servants to keep the Truth alive, that the world might at last know it and be saved. When the Jew was gone, and I was alone again, I chastened my soul with a new prayer—that I might be permitted to see the King when he was come, and worship him. One night I sat by the door of my cave trying to get nearer the mysteries of my existence, knowing which is to know God; suddenly, on the sea below me, or rather in the darkness that covered its face, I saw a star begin to burn; slowly it arose and drew nigh, and stood over the hill and above my door, so that its light shone full upon me. I fell down, and slept, and in my dream I heard a voice say:  “‘O Gaspar! Thy faith hath conquered! Blessed art thou! With two others, come from the uttermost parts of the earth, thou shalt see Him that is promised, and be a witness for him, and the occasion of testimony in his behalf. In the morning arise, and go meet them, and keep trust in the Spirit that shall guide thee.’  “And in the morning I awoke with the Spirit as a light within me surpassing that of the sun. I put off my hermit’s garb, and dressed myself as of old. From a hiding-place I took the treasure which I had brought from the city. A ship went sailing past. I hailed it, was taken aboard, and landed at Antioch. There I bought the camel and his furniture. Through the gardens and orchards that enamel the banks of the Orontes, I journeyed to Emesa, Damascus, Bostra, and Philadelphia; thence hither. And so, O brethren, you have my story. Let me now listen to you.”     CHAPTER IV   The Egyptian and the Hindoo looked at each other; the former waved his hand; the latter bowed, and began:  “Our brother has spoken well. May my words be as wise.”  He broke off, reflected a moment, then resumed:  “You may know me, brethren, by the name of Melchior. I speak to you in a language which, if not the oldest in the world, was at least the soonest to be reduced to letters—I mean the Sanscrit of India. I am a Hindoo by birth. My people were the first to walk in the fields of knowledge, first to divide them, first to make them beautiful. Whatever may hereafter befall, the four Vedas must live, for they are the primal fountains of religion and useful intelligence. From them were derived the Upa-Vedas, which, delivered by Brahma, treat of medicine, archery, architecture, music, and the four-and-sixty mechanical arts; the Ved-Angas, revealed by inspired saints, and devoted to astronomy, grammar, prosody, pronunciation, charms and incantations, religious rites and ceremonies; the Up-Angas, written by the sage Vyasa, and given to cosmogony, chronology, and geography; therein also are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, heroic poems, designed for the perpetuation of our gods and demi-gods. Such, O brethren, are the Great Shastras, or books of sacred ordinances. They are dead to me now; yet through all time they will serve to illustrate the budding genius of my race. They were promises of quick perfection. Ask you why the promises failed?

He was a great talker, and a never-ceasing boaster of what he had done, and of what he could do and would do.  As he certainly could do many of the things he talked about, it was believed that he could do everything.  Some believed in him, but others did not.  Such a person was, however, sure to have a number of followers and ardent admirers, who quoted him on all occasions,--stuck by him through thick or thin, right or wrong, and looked upon him as one of the finest fellows in existence.  Among the most constant of his followers was Robert Dawson--Bobby Dawson he was always called.  He was not a badly inclined little fellow, but he had no confidence in himself, and, consequently, wanted to lean on somebody else.  Unfortunately he chose Blackall as his supporter.  Among the smaller boys who aspired to be considered something above the common was Tommy Bouldon.  He was a determined, independent little fellow.  He was very active, and could perform more feats of activity than any other boy of his size.  He was a fair cricketer, and was sometimes chosen by some of the bigger fellows to play in their matches. This made Tommy rather cocky at times; but he was a good-natured chap, and managed to live on good terms with everybody.  Tommy, like Blackall, was rather apt to boast of what he had done, or he purposed doing; but in one respect he was different;--he never exaggerated in his descriptions of his past exploits, and seldom failed to perform whatever he undertook to do.  The boys I have described were among the many who were exercising away with all their might and main on the gymnastic poles.  Blackall was going up a ladder hand over hand, without using his feet, while Lemon was swarming up a pole.  When they reached the top, giddy as was the height, they crossed each other and descended, one by the pole and the other by the rope, head foremost; then, without stopping, each climbed on some horizontal bars.  Lemon first hung by his hands to the bar he had seized, and then he drew himself up until his chest touched the bar; then, lowering himself, he passed one of his feet through his hands, and hitched his knee over the bar; then he swung backwards, and came up sitting on the bar with one leg; it was easy enough to draw the other leg after him.  Throwing himself off, he caught the bar again by his hands, and curled his body over it.  \"That's all very fine,\" exclaimed Blackall, who had been sitting on a bar observing him; \"but, old fellow, can you do this?\"  Blackall, as he spoke, threw himself off the bar, grasping it with both hands; then he passed the left knee through the right arm, so as to let the knee rest in the elbow; then he passed the right knee over the instep of the left foot, and letting go his left hand, he grasped his right foot with it.  Thus he hung, suspended by his right hand, and coiled up like a ball.  After hanging thus for a couple of minutes, he caught the bar by his other hand, and, uncoiling himself, brought his feet between his arms and allowed them to drop till they nearly touched the ground.  Then he turned back the same way.  Once more lifting himself up, he threw his legs over the bar, and dropping straight down, hung by his bent knees, with his head towards the ground.  A little fellow passing at the moment, he called him, and lifted him off the ground; a feat which called forth the loud applause of all his admirers. This excited him to further efforts, and he was induced to continue still longer when he found that Lemon did not seem inclined to vie with him.  While the exercises I have described were going forward, the Doctor made his appearance at the door of the yard, accompanied by a boy who looked curiously round at what was taking place.  After waiting a minute or so, the Doctor led him on through the grounds.  \"I wonder who that chap is!\" observed Tommy Bouldon.  \"He looks a regular-built sawney.\"  \"Oh, don't you know?  He's the new fellow,\" answered Bobby Dawson.  \"I heard something about him from Sandon, who lives in the same county, ten or a dozen miles from his father's house.  The families visit,--that is to say, the elders go and stay at each other's houses,--but Sandon has never met this fellow himself, so he could only tell me what he had heard.  One thing he knows for certain, that he has never been at school before, so he must be a regular muff, don't you see.  His father is a sort of philosopher--brings up his children unlike anybody else; makes them learn all about insects and flowers, and birds and beasts, and astronomy, and teaches them to do all sorts of things besides, but nothing that is of any use in the world that I know of.  Now I'll wager young Hopeful has never played football or cricket in his life, and couldn't if he was to try.  Those sort of fellows, in my opinion, are only fit to keep tame rabbits and silkworms.\"  Master Bobby did not exactly define to what sort of character he alluded; and it is possible he might have been mistaken as to his opinion of the new boy.  \"Well, I agree with you,\" observed Tommy Bouldon, drawing himself up to his full height of three feet seven inches, and looking very consequential.  \"I hate those home-bred, missy, milk-and-water chaps. It is a pity they should ever come to school at all.  They are more fit to be turned into nursery-maids, and to look after their little brothers and sisters.\"  This sally of wit drew forth a shout of laughter from Bobby Dawson, who forthwith settled in his mind that he would precious soon take the shine out of the new boy.  \"But, I say, what is the fellow's name?\" asked Tommy.  \"Oh, didn't I tell you?\" answered Bobby.  \"It's Bracebridge; his Christian name is--let me see, I heard it, I know it's one of your fancy romantic mamma's pet-boy names--just what young ladies put in little children's story-books.  Oh, I have it now--Ernest--Ernest Bracebridge.\"  \"I don't see that that is so very much out of the way either,\" observed Bouldon; \"I've known two or three Ernests who were not bad sorts of fellows.  There was Ernest Hyde, who was a capital cricketer, and Ernest Eastgate, who was one of the best runners I ever met; still from what you tell me, I fully expect that this Ernest Bracebridge will turn out no great shakes.\"  While the lads were speaking, the subject of their remarks returned to the playground.  An unprejudiced person would certainly not have designated him as a muff.  He was an active, well-built boy, of between twelve and thirteen years old.  He had light-brown hair, curling slightly, with a fair complexion and a good colour.  His mouth showed a good deal of firmness, and he had clear honest eyes, with no little amount of humour in them.  He was dressed in a dark-blue jacket, white trousers, and a cloth cap.  Dawson and Bouldon eyed him narrowly.  What they thought of him, after a nearer scrutiny, they did not say.  He stood at a little distance from the gymnasium, watching with very evident interest the exercises of the boys.  He had, it seemed, when he first came in with the Doctor, been attracted with what he had seen, and had come back again as soon as he was at liberty.  He drew nearer and nearer as he gained more and more confidence, till he got close up to where Dawson and Bouldon were swinging lazily on some cross-bars. Blackall was at that moment playing off some of his most difficult feats, such as I have already described.  \"I say, young fellow, can you do anything like that?\" said Tommy, addressing Ernest, and pointing at Blackall.  \"Dawson here swears there isn't another fellow in England who can come up to him.\"  \"I beg your pardon, did you speak to me?\" asked Ernest, looking at Tommy as if he considered the question had not been put in the most civil way.  \"Yes, of course, young one, I did.  There's no one behind you, is there?\" answered Tommy.  \"What's more, too, I expect an answer.\"  \"Perhaps I might, with a little practice,\" answered the new boy carelessly.  \"I'm rather fond of athletic exercises.\"  \"I'll be content to see you get up that pole, young 'un,\" observed Tommy, putting his tongue in his cheek.  \"Take care you don't burn your fingers as you come down.\"  \"I'll try, if I may,\" replied the new boy quietly.  He advanced towards the pole, but another boy got hold of it--rather a bungler he seemed; so Ernest left him to puff and blow by himself in his vain efforts at getting up, and went on to one of the swinging ropes. He seized it well above his head, and pressing his knees and feet against it, steadily drew himself up, to the surprise of Bouldon and Dawson and several other lookers-on, till he reached the lofty cross-bar.  Was he coming down again?  No.  He sprang up and ran along the beam with fearless steps till he came to the part into which the top of the pole was fixed.  Most of the boys thought that he would come down by the ladder; but, stooping down, he swung himself on to the pole and slid down head first to the ground.  There he stood, looking as cool and unconcerned as if he had not moved from the spot.  The feat he had performed, though not difficult, was one which neither Dawson nor Bouldon had yet attempted.  It raised him wonderfully in the opinion of those young gentlemen.  \"Very well, young one,\" exclaimed Tommy in a patronising tone.  \"I did not think you'd have done it half as well.  However, I suppose it's _the_ trick you have practised.  You couldn't do, now, what that big fellow there, Blackall, is about?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Ernest quietly.  \"I can kick the bar, or swing on it, or circle it, or do the grasshopper, or hang by my legs, or make a true lover's knot, or pass through my arms, or hang by my feet.  You fancy that I am boasting, but the fact is this, my father won't let us do anything imperfectly.  If we do it at all, he says, we must do it well.\"  \"Oh, I dare say that's all right, young one,\" observed Tommy, turning away with Dawson.  \"I see how it is.  He has been coached well up in"]]]
