He put the glass in Abel's hand. \"On the sky,\" he added.  Abel lifted the glass and turned it on the heavens. There, above the little side lawn, the firmament had unclothed itself of branches and lay in a glorious nakedness to three horizons.  \"Thunder,\" Abel said, \"look at 'em look.\"  Sweeping the field with the lens, Abel spoke meanwhile.  \"Seems as if I'd kind of miss all the fuss in the store around Christmas,\" he said,--\"the extra rush and the trimming up and all.\"  \"Abel'll miss lavishin' his store with cut paper, I guess,\" said Simeon; \"he dotes on tassels.\"  \"Last year,\" Abel went on, not lowering the glass, \"I had a little kid come in the store Christmas Eve, that I'd never see before. He ask' me if he could get warm--and he set down on the edge of a chair by the stove, and he took in everything in the place. I ask' him his name, and he just smiled. I ask' him if he was glad it was Christmas, and he says, Was I. I was goin' to give him some cough drops, but when I come back from waiting on somebody he was gone. I never could find out who he was, nor see anybody that saw him. I thought mebbe this Christmas he'd come back. Lord, don't it look like a pasture of buttercups up there? Here, Simeon.\"  Simeon, talking, took the glass and lifted it to the stars.  \"Cut paper doin's is all very well,\" he said, \"but the worst nightmare of the year to the stores is Christmas. I always think it's come to be 'Peace on earth, good will to men and extravagance of women.' Quite a nice little till of gold pieces up there in the sky, ain't there? I'd kind o' like to stake a claim out up there--eh? Lay it out along about around that bright one down there--by Josh,\" he broke off, \"look at that bright one.\"  Simeon kept looking through the glass, and he leaned a little forward to try to see the better.  \"What is it?\" he repeated, \"what's that one? It's the biggest star I ever see--\"  The other two looked where he was looking, low in the east. But they saw nothing save boughs indeterminately moving and a spatter of sparkling points not more bright than those of the upper field.  \"You look,\" Simeon bade the vague presence that was his host; but through the glass, Ebenezer still saw nothing that challenged his sight.  \"I don't know the name of a star in the sky, except the dipper,\" he grumbled, \"but I don't see anything out of the ordinary, anyhow.\"  \"It is,\" Simeon protested; \"I tell you, it's the biggest star I ever saw. It's blue and purple and green and yellow--\"  Abel had the glass now, and he had looked hardly sooner than he had recognized.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"I've got it. It _is_ blue and purple and green and yellow, and it's as big as most stars put together. It twinkles--yes, sir, and it swings....\" he broke off, laughing at the mystification of the others, and laughed so that he could not go on.  \"Is it a comet, do you s'pose?\" said Simeon.  \"No,\" said Abel, \"no. It's come to stay. It's our individual private star. It's the arc light in front of the Town Hall you two are looking at.\"  They moved to where Abel stood, and from there, up the rise of ground to the east, they could see Simeon's star, shining softly and throwing long rays, it seemed, almost to where they stood: the lamp that marked the heart of the village.  \"Shucks,\" said Simeon.  \"Sold,\" said Ebenezer.  \"Why, I don't know,\" said Abel, \"I kind of like to see it through the glass. It looks like it was a bigger light than we give it credit for.\"  \"It's a big enough light,\" said Ebenezer, testily. It was his own plant at the factory that made possible the town's three arc lights, and these had been continued by him at the factory's closing.  \"No use making fun of your friends' eyesight because you're all of twenty minutes younger than them,\" Simeon grumbled. \"Come on, Abel. It must be gettin' round the clock.\"  Abel lingered.  \"A man owns the hull thing with a glass o' this stamp,\" he said. \"How much does one like that cost?\" he inquired.  \"I'll sell you this one--\" began Ebenezer; \"wait a week or two and I may sell you this one,\" he said. \"I ain't really looked through it myself yet.\"  Not much after this, the two went away and left Ebenezer in the dark yard.  He stood in the middle of his little grass plot and looked through his glass again. That night there was, so to say, nothing remote about the sky, save its distance. It had none of the reticence of clouds. It made you think of a bed of golden bells, each invisible stalk trying on its own account to help forward some Spring. As he had said, he did not know one star from another, nor a planet for a planet with a name. It had been years since he had seen the heavens so near. He moved about, looking, and passed the wall of leafless lilacs and mulberries. Stars hung in his boughs like fruit for the plucking. They patterned patches of sky. He looked away and back, and it was as if the stars repeated themselves, like the chorus of everything.  \"You beggars,\" Ebenezer said, \"awful dressed up, ain't you? It must be for something up there--it ain't for anything down here, let me tell you.\"  He went up to his dark back door. From without there he could hear Kate Kerr, his general servant, who had sufficient personality to compel the term \"housekeeper,\" setting sponge for bread, with a slapping, hollow sound and a force that implied a frown for every down stroke of the iron spoon. He knew how she would turn toward the door as he entered, with her way of arching eyebrows, in the manner of one about to recite the symptoms of a change for the worse--or at best to say \"about the same\" to everything in the universe. And when Kate Kerr spoke, she always whispered on the faintest provocation.  A sudden distaste for the entire inside of his house seized Ebenezer. He turned and wandered back down the little dark yard, looking up at the high field of the stars, with only his dim eyes.  \"There must be quite a little to know about them,\" he thought, \"if anybody was enough interested.\"  Then he remembered Simeon and Abel, and laughed again in his way.  \"I done the town a good turn for once, didn't I?\" he thought; \"I've fixed folks so's they can't spend their money fool!\"  Two steps from Ebenezer's front gate, Simeon and Abel overtook a woman. She had a long shawl over her head, and she was humming some faint air of her own making.  \"Coming to the meeting, Mary?\" Simeon asked as they passed her.  \"No,\" said Mary Chavah, \"I started for it. But it's such a nice night I'm going to walk around.\"  \"Things are going to go your way to that meeting, I guess,\" said Simeon; \"ain't you always found fault with Christmas?\"  \"They's a lot o' nonsense about it,\" Mary assented; \"I don't ever bother myself much with it. Why?\"  \"I donno but we'll all come round to your way of thinking to-night,\" said Simeon.  \"For just this year!\" Abel Ames called back, as they went on.  \"You can't do much else, I guess,\" said Mary. \"Everybody dips Christmas up out of their pocketbooks, and if there ain't nothing there, they can't dip.\"  The men laughed with her, and went on down the long street toward the town. Mary followed slowly, under the yellowing elms that made great golden shades for the dim post lamps. And high at the far end of the street down which they went, hung the blue arc light before the Town Hall, center to the constellation of the home lights and the shop lights and the street lights, all near neighbours to the stream and sweep of the stars hanging a little higher and shining as by one sun.     III   It was interesting to see how they took the proposal to drop that Christmas from the calendar there in Old Trail Town. It was so eminently a sensible thing to do, and they all knew it. Oh, every way they looked at it, it was sensible, and they admitted it. Yet, besides Mary Chavah and Ebenezer Rule, probably the only person in the town whose satisfaction in the project could be counted on to be unfeigned was little Tab Winslow. For Tab, as all the town knew, had a turkey brought up by his own hand to be the Winslows' Christmas dinner, but such had become Tab's intimacy with and fondness for the turkey that he was prepared to forego his Christmas if only that dinner were foregone, too.  \"Theophilus Thistledown is such a human turkey,\" Tab had been heard explaining patiently; \"he knows me--and he knows his name. He don't _expect_ us to eat him ... why, you _can't_ eat anything that knows its name.\"  But every one else was just merely sensible. And they had been discussing Christmas in this sensible strain at the town meeting that night, before Simeon and Abel broached their plan for standardizing their sensible leanings.  Somebody had said that Jenny Wing, and Bruce Rule, who was Ebenezer's nephew, were expected home for Christmas, and had added that it \"didn't look as if there would be much of any Christmas down to the station to meet them.\" On which Mis' Mortimer Bates had spoken out, philosophical to the point of brutality. Mis' Bates was little and brown and quick, and her clothes seemed always to curtain her off, so that her figure was no part of her presence.  \"I ain't going to do a thing for Christmas this year,\" she declared, as nearly everybody in the village had intermittently declared, \"not a living, breathing thing. I can't, and folks might just as well know it, flat foot. What's the use of buying tinsel and flim-flam when you're eating milk gravy to save butter and using salt sacks for handkerchiefs? I ain't educated up to see it.\"  Mis' Jane Moran, who had changed her chair three times to avoid a draught, sat down carefully in her fourth chair, her face twitching a little as if its muscles were connected with her joints.  \"Christmas won't be no different from any other day to our house this year,\" she said. \"We'll get up and eat our three meals and sit down and look at each other. We can't even spare a hen--sh"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20516"],["title","Christmas: A Story (#2)"],["body","might lay if we didn't eat her.\"  Mis' Abby Winslow, mother of seven under fifteen, looked up from her rocking-chair--Mis' Winslow always sat limp in chairs as if they were reaching out to rest her and, indeed, this occasional yielding to the force of gravity was almost her only luxury.  \"You ain't thinking of the children, Mis' Bates,\" she said, \"nor you either, Jane Moran, or you couldn't talk that way. We can't have no real Christmas, of course. But I'd planned some little things made out of what I had in the house: things that wouldn't be anything, and yet would seem a little something.\"  Mis' Mortimer Bates swept round at her.  \"Children,\" she said, \"ought to be showed how to do without things. Bennet and Gussie ain't expecting a sliver of nothing for Christmas--not a sliver.\"  Mis' Winslow unexpectedly flared up.  \"Whether it shows through on the outside or not,\" she said, \"I'll bet you they are.\"  \"My three,\" Mis' Emerson Morse put in pacifically, \"have been kept from popping corn and cracking nuts all Fall so's they could do both Christmas night, and it would seem like something that _was_ something.\"  \"That ain't the idea,\" Mis' Bates insisted; \"I want them learnt to do without--\" (\"They'll learn that,\" Mis' Abby Winslow said; \"they'll learn....\") \"Happening as it does to most every one of us not to have no Christmas, they won't be no distinctions drawn. None of the children can brag--and children is limbs of Satan for bragging,\" she added. (She was remembering a brief conversation overheard that day between Gussie and Pep, the minister's son:--  \"I've got a doll,\" said Gussie.  \"I've got a dollar,\" said Pep.  \"My mamma went to a tea party,\" said Gussie.  \"My mamma give one,\" said Pep.  Gussie mustered her forces. \"My papa goes to work every morning,\" she topped it.  \"My papa don't have to,\" said Pep, and closed the incident.)  \"I can't help who's a limb of Satan,\" Mis' Winslow replied doggedly, \"I can't seem to sense Christmas time without Christmas.\"  \"It won't _be_ Christmas time if you don't have any Christmas,\" Mis' Bates persisted.  \"Oh, yes it will,\" Mis' Winslow said. \"Oh, yes, it will. You can't stop that.\"  It was Mis' Bates, who, from the high-backed plush rocker, rapped with the blue glass paperweight on the red glass lamp and, in the absence of Mr. Bates, called the meeting to order. The Old Trail Town Society was organized on a platform of \"membership unlimited, dues nothing but taking turns with the entertaining, officers to consist of: President, the host of the evening (or wife, if any), and no minutes to bother with.\" And it was to a meeting so disposed on the subject of Christmas that Simeon Buck rose to present his argument.  \"Mr. President,\" he addressed the chair.  \"It's Madam President, you ninny geese,\" corrected Buff Miles, _sotto voce_.  \"It had ought to be Madam Chairman,\" objected Mis' Moran; \"she ain't the continuous president.\"  \"Well, for the land sakes, call me Mis' Bates, formal, and go ahead,\" said the lady under discussion. \"Only I bet you've forgot now what you was going to say.\"  \"Not much I did _not_,\" Simeon Buck continued composedly, and, ignoring the interruptions, let his own vocative stand. Then he presented a memorandum of a sum of money. It was not a large sum. But when he quoted it, everybody looked at everybody else, stricken. For it was a sum large enough to have required, in the earning, months of work on the part of an appalling proportion of Old Trail Town.  \"From the day after Thanksgiving to the night before Christmas last year,\" said Simeon, \"that is the amount that the three hundred souls--no, I guess it must have been bodies--in our town spent in the local stores. Now, bare living expenses aside,--which ain't very much for us all, these days,--this amount may be assumed to have been spent by the lot of us for Christmas. Of course there was those,\" continued Mr. Buck, looking intelligently about him, \"who bought most of their Christmas stuff in the City. But these--these economic traitors only make the point of what I say the more so. Without them, the town spent this truly amazing sum in keeping the holidays. Now, I ask you, frank, could the town afford that, or anything like that?\"  Buff Miles spoke out of the extremity of his reflections.  \"That's a funny crack,\" he said, \"for a merchant to make. Why not leave 'em spend and leave 'em pay?\"  \"Oh, I'll leave 'em _pay_ all right,\" rejoined Simeon, significantly, and stood silent and smiling until there were those in the room who uncomfortably shifted.  Then he told them the word he bore from Ebenezer Rule that as they had feared and half expected, the factory was not to open that Winter at all. Hardly a family represented in the rooms was not also representative of a factory employee, now idle these seven months, as they were periodically idle at the times of \"enforced\" suspension of the work.  \"What I'm getting at is this,\" Simeon summed it up, \"and Abel Ames, here, backs me up--don't you, Abel?--that hadn't we all ought to come to some joint conclusion about our Christmas this year, and roust the town up to it, like a town, and not go it blind and either get in up to our necks in debt, same as City folks, or else quit off Christmas, individual, and mebbe hurt folks's feelings? Why not move intelligent, like a town, and all agree out-and-out to leave Christmas go by this year? And have it understood, thorough?\"  It was very still in the little rooms when he had finished. There seems to be no established etiquette of revolutions. But something of the unconsciousness of the enthusiast was upon Mis' Mortimer Bates, and she spoke before she knew:--  \"So's we can be sure everybody else'll know it and not give something either and be disappointed too,\" she assented. \"Well, I bet everybody'd be real relieved.\"  \"The churches has sanctioned us doing away with Christmas this year by doing away with it themselves,\" observed Mis' Jane Moran. \"That'd ought to be enough to go by.\"  \"It don't seem to me Christmas is a thing for the churches to decide about,\" said Simeon, thoughtfully. \"It seems to me the matter is up to the merchants and the grocers and the family providers. We're the ones most concerned. Us providers have got to scratch gravel to get together any Christmas at all, if any. And speaking for us merchants, I may say, we'll lay in the stock if folks'll buy it. But if they can't afford to pay for it, we don't want the stock personally.\"  \"I guess we've all had the experience,\" observed Mis' Jane Moran, \"of announcing we wasn't going to give any gifts _this_ year, and then had somebody send something embroidered by hand, with a solid month's work on it. But if we all agree to secede from Christmas, we can lay down the law to folks so's it'll be understood: _No Christmas for nobody_.\"  \"Not to children?\" said Mis' Abby Winslow, doubtfully.  \"My idea is to teach 'em to do entirely without Christmas,\" harped Mis' Bates. \"We can't afford one. Why not let the children share in the family privation without trying to fool 'em with make-shift presents and boiled sugar?\"  Over in a corner near the window plants, whose dead leaves she had been picking off, sat Ellen Bourne--Mis' Matthew Bourne she was, but nearly everybody called her Ellen Bourne. There is some law about these things: why instinctively we call some folk by the whole name, some by their first names, some by the last, some by shortening the name, some by a name not their own. Perhaps there is a name for each of us, if only we knew where to look, and folk intuitively select the one most like that. Perhaps some of us, by the sort of miracle that is growing every day, got the name that is meant for us. Perhaps some of us struggle along with consonants that spell somebody else. And how did some names get themselves so terrifically overused unless by some strange might, say, a kind of astrological irregularity.... Ellen Bourne sat by the window and suddenly looked over her shoulder at the room.  \"If we've got the things made,\" she said, \"can't we give 'em? If it's to children?\"  \"I think if we're going to omit, we'd ought to omit,\" Mis Bates held her own; \"it can't matter to you, Ellen, with no children, so....\" She caught herself sharply up. Ellen's little boy had died a Christmas or two ago.  \"No,\" Ellen said, \"I ain't any children, of course. But--\"  \"Well, I think,\" said Mis' Jane Moran, \"that we've hit on the only way we could have hit on to chirk each other up over a hard time.\"  \"And get off delicate ourselves same time,\" said Buff Miles. From the first Buff had been advocating what he called \"an open Christmas,\" and there were those near him at the meeting to whom he had confided some plan about \"church choir Christmas carol serenades,\" which he was loath to see set at naught.  Not much afterward Simeon Buck put the motion:--  \"Mis' Chairman,\" he said, \"I move you--and all of us--that the Old Trail Town meeting do and hereby does declare itself in favour of striking Christmas celebrations from its calendar this year. And that we circulate a petition through the town to this effect, headed by our names. And that we all own up that it's for the simple and regretful reason that not a mother's son of us can afford to buy Christmas presents this year, and what's the use of scratching to keep up appearances?\"  For a breath Abel Ames hesitated; then he spoke voluntarily for the first time that evening.  \"Mr. President, I second the hull of that,\" said he, slowly, and without looking at anybody; and then sighed his vast, triple sigh.  There was apparently nobody to vote against the motion. Mis' Winslow did not vote at all. Ellen Bourne said \"No,\" but she said it so faintly that nobody heard save those nearest her, and they felt a bit embarrassed for her because she had spoken alone, and they tried to cover up the minute.  \"Carried,\" said the Chair, and slipped out in the kitchen to put on the coffee.  At the meeting there was almost nobody who,"]]]
