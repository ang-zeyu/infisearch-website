Futilely, of course; there was nothing in sight overhead. But these explosions did look like the hexynitrate stuff they put in small-arm bullets nowadays. A thirty-caliber bullet had the explosive effect of an old-style six-pound T.N.T. shell. Only, hexynitrate goes off with a crack instead of a boom. It wasn't an American plane opening up with a machine-gun.  Then the beached ship seemed to blow up. A mass of thick smoke covered her from stem to stern, and bits of plating flew heavily through the air, and there were a few lurid bursts of flame. Sergeant Walpole suddenly remembered that there ought to be survivors, only he hadn't seen anybody diving overboard to try to get ashore. He half-started forward....  Then the sea-breeze blew this smoke, too, away from the wreckage. And the tramp was gone, but there was something else left in its place--so that Sergeant Walpole took one look, and swallowed a non-existent something that came up instantly into his throat again, and remembered the urgent thing he had to do.  \"Pete,\" he said calmly, \"you hunt up the Area Officer an' tell him what you seen. Here! I'll give you a report that'll keep 'em from slammin' you in clink for bein' drunk. Grab a monocycle somewheres. It's faster than a car, the way you'll be travelin'. First telephone you come to that's workin', make Central put you in the tight beam to head-quarters. Then go on an' report, y'self. See?\"  Pete started, and automatically fumbled with his limp and useless arm. Then he carefully tucked the unmanageable hand in the pocket of his uniform blouse.  \"That don't matter now,\" he said absurdly.  He was looking at the thing left in place of the tramp, as Sergeant Walpole scribbled on one of the regulation report-forms of the Eastern Coast Observation Force. And the thing he saw was enough to upset anybody.         *       *       *       *       *  Where the tramp had been there was a single bit of bow-plating sticking up out of the surf, and a bunch of miscellaneous floating wreckage drifting sluggishly toward the beach. And there was a solid, rounded, metallic shape apparently quite as long as the original tramp had been. There was a huge armored tube across its upper part, with vision-slits in two bulbous sections at its end. There were gun-ports visible here and there, and already a monstrous protuberance was coming into view midway along its back, as if forced into position from within. Where the bow of the tramp had been there were colossal treads now visible. There was a sort of conning-tower, armored and grim. There was a ghastly steel beak. The thing was a war-machine of monstrous size. It emitted a sudden roaring sound, as of internal-combustion engines operating at full power, and lurched heavily. The steel plates of the tramp still visible above water, crumpled up like paper and were trodden under. The thing came toward the shore. It slithered through the shallow sea, with waves breaking against its bulging sides. It came out upon the beach, its wet sides glittering. It was two hundred feet long, and it looked somehow like a gigantic centipede.  It was a tank, of sorts, but like no tank ever seen on earth before. It was the great-grandfather of all tanks. It was so monstrous that for its conveyance a ship's hull and superstructure had been built about it, and its own engines had been the engines of that ship. It was so huge that it could only be landed by blasting away a beached ship from about itself, so it could run under its own power over the fragments to the shore.  Now it stopped smoothly on the sandy beach, in which its eight-foot-wide steel treads sank almost a yard. Men dropped down from ports in its swelling sides. They made swift, careful inspections of predetermined points. They darted back up the ladders again. The thing roared once more. Then it swung about, headed for the sand-dunes, and with an extraordinary smoothness and celerity disappeared inland.     PART II      \"... The Wabbly was meant for one purpose, the     undermining of civilian morale. To accomplish that     purpose it set systematically about the establishment     of a reign of terror; and so complete was its success     that half the population of a state was in headlong     flight within two hours. It was, first, mysterious;     secondly, deadly, and within a very few hours it had     built up a reputation for invincibility. Judged on the     basis of its first twelve hours' work alone, it was the     most successful experiment of the war. Its effect on     civilian morale was incalculable.\" (_Strategic Lessons     of the War of 1941-43._--U. S. War College. Pp. 80-81.)   Two of the members of Observation-Post Fourteen gaped after the retreating monster. Sergeant Walpole scribbled on the official form. Just as the monstrous thing dipped down out of sight there was a vicious, crashing report from its hinder part. Something shrieked....  Sergeant Walpole got up, spitting sand. There was blood on the report-form in his hand. He folded it painstakingly. Of the two men who had been with him, one was struggling out of the sand as Sergeant Walpole had had to do. The other was scattered over a good many square yards of sandy beach.  \"Um. They seen us,\" said Sergeant Walpole, \"an' they got Pete. You'll have to take this report. I'm goin' after the damn thing.\"  \"What for?\" asked the other man blankly.  \"To keep it in sight,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"That's tactics. If somebody springs somethin' you ain't able to fight, run away but keep it in sight an' report to the nearest commissioned officer. Remember that. Now get on. There's monocycles in the village. Get there an' beat that damn Wabbly thing with the news.\"  He saw his follower start off, sprinting. That particular soldier, by the way, was identified by his dog-tag some days later. As nearly as could be discovered, he had died of gas. But Sergeant Walpole picked up one of the two rifles, blew sand out of the breech-mechanism, and started off after the metal monster. He walked in the eight-foot track of one of its treads. As he went, he continued the cleaning of sand from the rifle in his hands. The rifle was useless against such a monster, of course, but it is quaint to reflect that in that automatic rifle, firing hexynitrate bullets, each equivalent to a six-pounder T.N.T. shell in destructiveness, Sergeant Walpole carried greater \"fire-power\" than Napoleon ever disposed in battle.  The tread of the Wabbly made a perfect roadway. Presently Sergeant Walpole looked up to find himself scrutinizing somebody's dining-room table, set for lunch. The Wabbly had crossed a house in its path without swerving. Walls, chimneys, timbers and planks, all had gone beneath its treads. But they had been pressed so smoothly flat that until Sergeant Walpole looked down at his footing, he would not have known he was walking on the wreckage of a building.  It was half an hour before he reached the village. The Wabbly had gone from end to end, backed up, and gone over the rest of it again. There was the taint of gas in the air. Sergeant Walpole halted outside the debris. His gas-mask had been blown to atoms with Observation-Post Fourteen.  \"They're tryin' to beat the news o' their comin',\" he reflected aloud, \"which is why they smashed up the village. The telephone exchange was there.... Tillie's under there somewheres....\"  He fumbled with the rifle, suddenly swearing queerly hate-distorted oaths. Tillie had not been the great love of Sergeant Walpole's life. She was merely a country telephone operator, reasonably pretty, and flattered by his uniform. But she was under a mass of splintered wood and crushed brick-work, killed while trying to connect with the tight beam to Area Headquarters to report the monster rushing upon the village. That monster had destroyed the little settlement. There was nothing left at all but wreckage and the eight-foot tracks of monster treads. Sometimes those tracks crossed each other. Between them wreckage survived to a height of as much as four feet, which was the clearance of the Wabbly's body.  Something roared low overhead. Sergeant Walpole swore bitterly, looked upward, and waited to die. But the small plane was American, and old. It was a training-plane, useless for front-line work. It dived to earth, the pilot waved impatiently, and Walpole plunged to a place beside him. Instantly thereafter the plane took off.  \"What was it?\" shouted the pilot, sliding off at panic-stricken speed across the tree-tops. \"They heard the bombs go off all the way to Philly. Sent me. What in hell was it?\"         *       *       *       *       *  A thin, high, wailing sound coming down as lightning might be imagined to descend.... The pilot dived madly and got behind a pine forest before the explosion and the concussion that followed it. Sergeant Walpole saw the pine-trees shiver. The sheer explosion-wave of that egg, if it hit an old ship like this in mid-air, would have stripped the fabric from its wings.  \"Set me down,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"They're watchin' us from aloft. I sent a man on a monocycle to report.\" But he told luridly of the thing that had come ashore, and of its destructiveness. \"Now set me down. Gimme a gas-mask an' clear out. You ain't got a burglar's chance of gettin' back.\"  The pilot set him down, and began ticking away on a code sender even as he landed. Then he climbed swiftly away from the Sergeant, headed in a weaving, crazy line to westward. Then things screamed downward and the Sergeant clapped hands over his ears once more. The ground quivered underfoot, though the eggs landed a good three-quarters of a mile away. The training-plane dropped like a plummet. The sharpness of a hexynitrate explosion carries its effect to quite incredible distances. The fabric of its wings split to ribbons. The ship landed somewhere and smoke rose from it.  \"He shouldn't ha' gone up so high,\" said Sergeant Walpole.  He struck"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20920"],["title","Morale: A Story of the War of 1941-43 (#2)"],["body","country for the treads of the Wabbly once more. He saw a school-house. The Wabbly had passed within a hundred yards of it. The school-house seemed deserted. Then the Sergeant saw the hole in its roof. Then he caught the infinitely faint taint of gas.  \"Mighty anxious,\" said Sergeant Walpole woodenly, \"not to let news get ahead of 'em. Yeah.... If it busts on places without warnin', it'll have that much easier work. I hope I'm in on the party when we get this damn thing.\"  There was no use in approaching the school-house, though he had a gas-mask now. Sergeant Walpole went on.     PART III      \"... The Wabbly made no attempt to do purely military     damage. The Enemy command realized that the destruction     of civilian morale was even more important than the     destruction of munitions factories. In this, the Enemy     displayed the same acumen that makes the war a fruitful     subject of study to the strategic student.\" (_Strategic     Lessons of the War of 1941-43._--U. S. War College.     Pp. 81-82.)   At nightfall the monster swerved suddenly and moved with greater speed. It showed no lights. It did not even make very much noise. Then the second flight of home-defense planes made their attack. Sergeant Walpole heard them droning overhead. He lit a fire instantly. A little helicopter dropped from the blackness above him and he began to heap dirt desperately on the blaze.  \"Who's there?\" demanded a voice.  \"Sergeant Walpole, Post Fourteen, Eastern Coast Observation,\" said the Sergeant in a military manner. \"Beg to report, sir, that the dinkus that brought down the other ships is housed in that big bulge on top of the Wabbly.\"  \"Get in,\" said the voice.  The Sergeant obeyed. With a purring noise the helicopter shot upward. Then something went off in mid-sky, miles ahead, where a faint humming noise had announced the flight of attack-planes. A lurid, crackling detonation lit up the sky. One of the ships of the night-flying squadron. From the helicopter they could see the rest of the flight limned clearly in the flash of the explosion. Instantly thereafter there was another such flash. Then another.  \"Three,\" said the voice beside Sergeant Walpole. Another flash. \"Four....\" The invisible operator of the screw-lifted ship was very calm about it. \"Five. Six.\" The explosions lit the sky. Presently he said grimly. \"That's all of them. I'd better report it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He was silent for a while. Sergeant Walpole saw his hand flicking a key up and down in the faint light of radio bulbs.  \"Now shoot the works,\" said the helicopter man evenly. \"All the ships that attacked this afternoon went down. One of them started to report, but didn't get but two words through. What did that damned thing use on them?\"  \"A dinkus on top, sir,\" said Sergeant Walpole formally. \"I'd found a monocycle, sir, and was trailing the thing. I'd come to the top of a hill and seen it moving through a pine-wood, crashing down the trees in front of it like they wasn't there. Then a egg came down from Gawd-knows-where up aloft. I stopped up my ears, thinkin' it was aimin' for me. Then I seen the ships. Two of 'em were fallin'. They landed, an' I heard a coupla other explosions. Little ones, they sounded like.\"  The helicopter man's wrist was flicking up and down.  \"Little ones!\" he said sardonically. \"Those ships were carrying five-hundred-pound bombs! It was those you heard going off!\"  \"Maybe,\" conceded Sergeant Walpole. \"There was twenty or thirty ships flyin' in formation, goin' hell-for-leather for the Wabbly. They were trailin' it from the air. They were comin', natural, for me, because I was between them an' it. Then my pants caught on fire--\"  \"What?\"  \"My pants caught on fire,\" said Sergeant Walpole, woodenly. \"I was sittin' on the monocycle, tryin' to figure out which way to duck. An' my pants caught on fire. The bike was gettin' hot. I climbed off it an' it blew up. My rifle was hot, too, an' I chucked it away. Then I saw a ship go down, on fire. The Wabbly'd stopped still an' it didn't fire a shot. I'll swear to that. Just my monocycle got hot an' caught on fire, an' then a ship busted out in flames an' went down. A couple more eggs come down an' three ships dropped. Didn't hit 'em. The concussion blew the fabric off 'em. Another one caught fire an' crashed. Then another one. I looked, an' saw the next one catch. Then the next. It was like a searchlight beam hittin' 'em. They flamed up, blew up, an' that was that. The last two tried to get away, but they lit up an' crashed.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The pilot's hand flicked up and down, interminably. There was the steady fierce down-beat of the slip-stream from the vertical propellers. The helicopter swept forward in a swooping dash.  \"The whole east coast's gone crazy,\" said the 'copter man drily. \"Crazy fools trying to run away. Roads jammed. Work stopped. It leaked out about the planes being wiped out to-day, and everybody in three states has heard those eggs going off. You're the only living man who's seen that crawling thing and lived to tell about it. I've sent your stuff back. What's that about the thing on top?\"  \"I hid,\" said Sergeant Walpole, woodenly. \"The Wabbly sent over gas-shells where the ships landed. Then it went on. Headin' west. It's got a crazy-lookin' dinkus on top like a searchlight. That moved, while the ships were catchin' fire an' crashin'. Just like a searchlight, it moved an' the ships went down. But the Wabbly didn't fire a shot.\"  The helicopter man's wrist flexed swiftly....  \"Gawd!\" said Sergeant Walpole in sudden agony. \"Drop! Quick!\"  The helicopter went down like a stone. A propeller shrieked away into space. Metalwork up aloft glowed dully red. Then there were whipping, lashing branches closing swiftly all around the helicopter. A jerk. A crash. Stillness. The smell of growing things all about.  \"Well?\" said the 'copter pilot.  \"They turned it on us--whatever it is,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"They near got us, too.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A match scratched. A cigarette glowed. The Sergeant fumbled for a smoke for himself.  \"I'm waiting for that metal to cool off,\" said the helicopter pilot. \"Maybe we can take off again. They located us with a loop while I was sending your stuff. Damn! I see what they've got!\"  \"What?\"  \"A way of transmitting real power in a radio beam,\" said the 'copter man. \"You've seen eddy-current stoves. Everybody cooks with 'em nowadays. A coil with a high-frequency current. You can stick your hand in it and nothing happens. But you stick an iron pan down in the coil and it gets hot and cooks things. Hysteresis. The same thing that used to make transformer-cores get hot. The same thing happens near any beam transmitter, only you have to measure the heating effect with a thermo-couple. The iron absorbs the radio waves and gets hot. The chaps in the Wabbly can probably put ten thousand horsepower in a damned beam. We can't. But any iron in the way will get hot. It blows up a ship at once. Your monocycle and your rifle too. Damn!\"  He knocked the ash off his cigarette.  \"Scientific, those chaps. I'll see if that metal's cool.\"  Something whined overhead, rising swiftly to a shriek as it descended. Sergeant Walpole cowered, with his hands to his ears. But it was not an earth-shaking concussion. It was an explosion, yes, but subtly different from the rending snap of hexynitrate.  \"Gas,\" said the Sergeant dully, and fumbled for his mask.  \"No good,\" said the 'copter man briefly. \"Vesicatory. Smell it? I guess they've got us. No sag-suits. Not even sag-paste.\"  The Sergeant lit a match. The flame bent a little from the vertical.  \"There's a wind. We got a chance.\"  \"Get going, then,\" said the 'copter man. \"Run upwind.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sergeant Walpole slid over the side and ran. A hundred yards. Two hundred. Pine-woods have little undergrowth. He heard the helicopter's engines start. The ship tried to lift. He redoubled his speed. Presently he broke out into open ploughed land.  In the starlight he saw a barn, and he raced toward that. Someone else plunged out of the woods toward him. The helicopter-engine was still roaring faintly in the distance. Then a thin whine came down from aloft....  When the echoes of the explosion died away the pilot was grinning queerly. The helicopter's engine was still.  \"I said it could be done! Pack of fat-heads at Headquarters!\"  \"Huh?\"  \"Picking up a ship by its spark-plugs, with a loop. They're doing that up aloft. There's a ship up there, forty thousand feet or so. Maybe half a dozen ships. Refueling in air, I guess, and working with the thing you call a Wabbly. When I started the 'copter's engine they got the spark-impulses and sighted on them. We'd better get away from here.\"  \"Horses in here,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"The Wabbly came by. No people left.\"  They brought the animals out. The horses reared and plunged as there were other infinitely sharp, deadly explosions of the eggs coming down eight miles through darkness.  \"Let's go. After the Wabbly?\" said the 'copter man.  \"O' course,\" said Sergeant Walpole. \"Somebody's got to find out how to lick it.\"  They went clattering through darkness. It was extraordinary what desolation, what utter lack of human life they moved through. They came to a town, and there was a taint of gas in the air. No lights burned in that town. It was dead. The Wabbly had killed it.     PART IV      \"... which panic was enhanced by the destruction of a     second flight of fighting planes. However, the     destruction of Bendsboro completed civilian     demoralization.... A newscasting company re-broadcast     a private television contact with the town at the     moment the Wabbly entered it. Practically all the     inhabitants of the Atlantic Coast heard and saw the     annihilation of the town--hearing the cries of '_Gas!_'     and the screams of the people, and"]]]
