We should have no little crickets chirping in the sunny fields or in the dark corners and cracks of our houses. There would be no katydids singing all night, no clacking of the locusts in the tall grass along dusty roads, no drowsy hum of bees. There would be no little ants and big ants digging out underground tunnels and carrying the grains of sand as far from their doorways as possible. There would be no brightly colored moths and butterflies flitting from flower to flower. We should find no sparkling fairy webs spun anew for us every morning.\"  \"But, mother, all these creatures aren't insects,\" said Jimmie.  \"Yes, they are, dear. It is hard to believe that they all belong to the same family called insecta, but they do.\"  \"Mother, what's that word mean?\"  \"It doesn't mean anything more than cut up into parts. You see, Betty, all these insect bodies are made up of separate rings joined nicely together. If you look carefully you will find that behind the head there is another distinct part. This is called the thorax, which means chest. Behind that there is a pointed part of the body, which is called the abdomen. Then, if you look again, you will see that all these little creatures are alike in that they have six jointed legs.\"  \"And are they all good, like the bee and the butterfly?\" asked Betty, who wasn't always a good little girl herself, and who thought it would be much nicer if insects were naughty sometimes.  \"Not all, dear,\" answered Mrs. Reece; \"some do us real service, but others are troublesome; insects are such hungry little fellows, and they don't have chocolate cake every day to keep them from getting hungry. They are hungry when they are babies and hungry when they grow up. Some eat all they can see--like a little boy I know--and some prefer the tender leaves and twigs. Some care only for the sweet sap flowing into the new leaves and buds. And still others like best the tender new roots of plants.\"  \"Mother, what are the baddest ones?\" asked Betty.  \"Pooh! I know,\" said Jimmie; \"the beetles are, because they eat everything. Why, they'd eat the buttons off your coat or the nose off your face or--\"  \"Jim! Jim! do tell the truth! The beetles, and bugs, too, are the most troublesome. Many of the bugs are such tiny little creatures that it is hard to realize that they can hurt a plant. But bugs have sucking beaks. With these beaks they bore into the leaves or the buds of the plant, and then by means of tiny muscles at the back of the mouth they pump up the sap. To be sure, one little pump could do no harm; but think of millions of little sucking beaks, millions of little pumps busy at work on a single plant! Do you remember the pansies mother had in the winter, and how they were all covered by green plant-lice? Well, those are bugs called aphids. You remember they were pale green, just the color of the plant, and so transparent and soft they looked most harmless. The scale insects are very troublesome, too, but mother doesn't know anything about them.\"  \"Oh, I know what _they_ are,\" announced Jimmie, \"they get into the fruit trees.\"  \"And sometimes onto shrubs, too. Mother has heard of a scale insect out in California which has been a great nuisance to fruit-growers. A certain ladybug finds this cottony-cushion scale a tender morsel, so many ladybugs were taken out there to help the owners of the fruit farms get rid of the scale.\"  \"Did they carry them all the way out, mother?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Jimmie; \"they got a Pullman car for them, and Mr. and Mrs. Ladybug and family travelled in style.\"  \"Mother, tell Jim to be still.\" Betty, not unlike other little sisters, hated to be teased by her brother.  \"And now, let me see,\" said Mrs. Reece. \"I don't know that I can tell you any more until I know more myself. Yes, I do know what baby beetles are called. They are called grubs, and they live in the ground until it is time for them to turn into grown-up beetles. While they are babies they eat as much and as fast as they can, as no baby but a beetle should. The more they eat the sooner they come out into the bright world as a June-bug or some other kind of beetle. They eat all the tender little roots they can find. This is very nice--\"  \"For Mary Ann, but rather hard on Abraham.\"  \"You horrid boy,\" said Betty, \"you don't even let me hear a story in peace! It's very nice what, mother?\"  \"It's very nice for the little grubs, but it's rather hard on the plants, for if too many roots are nibbled away the plants die. The caterpillars are great eaters, too.\"  Betty leaned over and whispered something to her mother; then they both giggled.  \"I know what you're saying,\" said Jimmie, but after that he was quieter.  \"Sometimes a caterpillar will thrive on just one kind of a plant; it may be carrot, it may be milkweed. On that it feeds until it has grown as large as possible. Then it spins itself a nice silken cocoon, or rolls itself up in a soft leaf and takes a long, long nap. And now it is time for us to take a nap, too, for we shall soon reach Bemis, and then there will be still two long lakes to cross and a carry to walk.\"     II  RANGELEY VILLAGE   The next morning great was the stir in the town, for it was known by the village children that Betty and Jimmie had come, and by the grown-ups that Mrs. Reece was there. All winter long the children had looked forward to their coming, for it meant jolly times: picnics, parties, expeditions, and games. Then, too, Ben Gile would begin to tell them wonderful things. Through the winter he had been teaching school, and it was only when the ice broke up in the big lake and the beavers decided to stop sleeping that Ben Gile came back to his guiding.  There was great excitement about Turtle Lodge. Lizzie kept flying out with rugs, and then forgetting they hadn't been brushed and flying in again. The cat was playing croquet with the balls and spools of an open work-basket, and Max had discovered an old straw hat which tasted very good to him. Only Mrs. Reece kept her head and stayed indoors, moving about quietly from room to room, putting the house in that beautiful order which little children never think about.  Out on the grass that sloped down to the street, which, in its turn, tumbled head over heels down to the lake, Betty and Jimmie were playing with their playmates. They were all so wild with joy that every time Jimmie saw another boy he shouted, \"Come over!\" when the boy was coming, anyway, just as fast as he could.  Up, up from the foot of the lake climbed an old man; up, up, up the steep street he came, his white hair shaking and shining in the brisk June breeze, his long, white beard caught every once in a while by the wind and tossed sideways.  \"Mother,\" called Jimmie, \"Ben Gile is coming!\"  Out came Mrs. Reece to greet the old man.  Then, one by one, the children spoke with Ben Gile.  \"You're having a good time before you can say Jack Robinson, aren't you?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" came in a chorus of voices. Then, \"Tell us a story; tell us a story!\"  [Illustration: _A._ A few facets of the compound eye of an insect. _B._ Brain and nerve cord of an insect.]  \"Not to-day,\" said the old man. \"Why, you want a story before you've had time to turn around.\"  Betty stuck her head out from behind her mother. \"Mother said you would tell us about crickets and moths, and everything.\"  \"Well, well, well,\" murmured the old man, \"did she? But I can't tell a story to-day. I'll tell you, though, something, so that when you come to collect the little creatures you'll know what to do. All sit down.\"  They all sat down cross-legged on the ground, the old man in the middle.  \"Here, you big Jim-boy, catch me that butterfly.\"  There was a wild rush, and the bright wings were soon caught.  \"There, you've torn off one of its legs,\" said the old man.  Jimmie looked troubled. \"I didn't mean to, sir.\"  \"Do you know how it hurts to have your leg torn off, boy? Do you know, children?\"  \"No,\" came in a chorus.  The guide took out a piece of paper and drew a picture on it. \"There, every part of that little fellow's body I've drawn has muscles, such fine muscles no naked eye could ever see them. I'll show them to you under the microscope in my cabin. Those muscles move the body, and each muscle is controlled by threads, still more fine, called nerves.\"  The old man reached out like a flash and pinched Jimmie.  \"Ouch!\" cried the boy, and there was a shout of laughter from the children.  \"You felt that?\"  \"I guess I did,\" said Jim, sulkily.  \"Well, that's because you're made something the same way this butterfly is. When anything hurts us it's because some of our nerves are hurt, and quick as a flash the news travels to the brain, and we try to get away from the thing that causes pain--a pinch, perhaps, or, still worse, the hurt of a poor leg that has been torn off.\"  \"But a butterfly hasn't any brain,\" objected Jimmie, who was still cross.  \"Hasn't it? Well, we'll see. Now, you watch my pencil.\" He pointed to the head of the butterfly. \"This little fellow has a very tiny brain there. Also running through the body, from end to end, is a little tube through which the food passes. It is in the head above this tube where the tiny brain is, and from which two little threads run down around the tube and join to form another little knot of nerve cells like that of the brain. Then, from this second one there runs a series of little knots united by fine threads the entire length of the body, one in each ring of the body. Do you understand that?\"  \"Yes,\" piped up Betty, \"mother told us an insect is made up of rings, and--and--\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21948"],["title","Little Busybodies: The Life of Crickets, Ants, Bees, Beetles, and Other (#2)"],["body"," stammered, surprised at her own boldness, \"the word means cut up into parts.\"  \"Good! Why, that's a real bright girl. Well, from each one of these knots nerves go to the muscles of the body.\"  \"It's just like a lot of beads on a string,\" said Hope Stanton.  \"So it is, child. So, you see, if we handle an insect roughly, squeezing it too hard, or breaking a leg or a wing, a message is sent to one of these little beads or knots or nerve cells, and the poor, helpless creature suffers pain.\"  \"But I didn't mean to hurt that butterfly!\"  \"No, of course you didn't. The only way to do,\" said the old man, \"is to catch them in a net. Make it of bobinet with a rounded bottom, sewing it to a wire ring and fastening it to a handle that is the right weight and length for your arm.\"  \"But then, after you caught it, how could you keep it, sir?\" asked Betty.  \"There are two merciful ways,\" said the old man, \"of killing insects, but neither way is safe for children to try. Put a few drops of chloroform on a piece of cotton under a tumbler turned upside down. Put the insect inside. It will soon fall asleep without pain. The other is a cyanide bottle. I have one down at the cabin. It must be kept tightly corked and never smelled. The cyanide in the bottle is hard and dry. Several insects may be put into the bottle at the same time. Once there they die very quickly. After large insects are killed the wings should be folded over the back, and they should be placed in a little case like this. See, I'm folding a piece of paper to form a three-cornered case. Then I bend down one edge to keep the little case closed.\"  At this moment out flew Lizzie with a curtain which she was going to shake.  \"Here, here!\" shouted the old man, \"don't shake that; catch that caterpillar on it. I want it.\"  Lizzie made a good-natured grab at the caterpillar, and then there was a cry of pain. \"Oh, begorra, begorra, I'm stung by a wasp, I am! Ow!\" But she still kept tight hold of the caterpillar as she danced about.  \"No,\" said the guide, \"you're not stung by any wasp. Bring me that! There, open your hand. You see, the caterpillar stung you.\"  \"Oh my, what a beauty!\" exclaimed the children. \"But caterpillars don't sting.\"  \"Oh yes, they do,\" continued Ben Gile, with a twinkle in his eye; \"ask Lizzie.\" Lizzie was looking at the palm of her hand, which showed how badly it had been stung.  \"Now, you see, we'll need something to pick up these little creatures with--a pair of forceps or something of that kind. At least, you must be very careful.\"  \"And what else do we need?\" asked the children.  \"A little hand lens will magnify the small parts of an insect a great deal. It will show you all the tiny hairs on the body, and the little rings and the feelers and the facets of the eyes, and many another wonderful thing.\"  \"What are we going to put the bugs in?\" inquired Jimmie.  \"Lizzie will get you a small wooden box,\" said Mrs. Reece.  Lizzie went off grumbling something about guides and bites and insects, but soon she came back with a nice box, and in a minute all the children's heads were clustered about Ben Gile as he showed them how to line the box with a layer of cork, how to steam the insects a little if they were dry, and then how to put the long, slender pins through the chest of the insect and stick it into the cork.     III  THE LITTLE ARMY   Ben Gile shook his head. As his hair was long and white, and his hands moved with his head, just as if he were a lot of dried branches moving in the wind, it was enough to frighten little Betty. \"Plagues of Egypt! Plagues of Egypt!\" he kept muttering. Now, Betty had been to school a long time--I think it must have been as much as two whole years, which is a very _long_ time for school and a very _short_ time for climbing trees--now, Betty had been to school and knew better. She crept behind a big beech-tree, but she stuck her little head out and said, in a trembling voice:  \"It was locusts, sir, wasn't it--and wild honey?\"  Betty wasn't at all certain that any kind of honey could be a plague.  \"It was locusts, child--yes, you're right,\" answered the old man. \"Locusts it was; but you eat wild honey.\"  Betty came out from behind the tree and whispered, \"You eat them _both_?\"  \"So men did in the Bible,\" said Ben Gile, and washing his sugar-pails, and putting his maple sugar camp--a very sweet place for a little girl to be when there are still piles of maple sugar packed away on the shelves--in order for the summer.  In all her short life Betty had never known another old man like him. In the winter he taught school; in spring he made maple sugar; in summer he was guiding about the ponds or looking up into the trees most of the time; and in the fall he cut wood before he went back to teaching; but what was oddest of all to Betty was that he knew the squirrels and deer and rabbits as well as he seemed to know little girls or little boys. There was a story told in those woods about his taming even a trout so that one morning it hopped out of the water and followed him everywhere he went--hop, hop, flop behind him. And in the evening, as Ben Gile and his tame trout were passing by the pond again, the trout fell in and was drowned. But, dear me, that is a fish story, and you mustn't believe any fish stories whatever except those your father tells! Still, if your grandpa is fond of fishing, you may believe his fish stories, too.  [Illustration: _A._ A locust. _B._ Cast-off skin of a young locust.]  Betty came out farther from behind the tree. \"Please, sir, do _you_ eat grasshoppers?\"  \"Not yet, my dear.\" The old man's eyes twinkled. \"I knew a little boy once\"--Betty was wondering whether this old man had ever been a little boy himself--\"I knew a little boy once who wasn't afraid to swallow even a caterpillar, but I think that little boy never thought of eating a grasshopper.\" The old man shook his head gravely. \"No, not a grasshopper.\"  \"Please, sir,\" said Betty, coming right up to the bucket he was washing in the brook--\"please, sir, do you know any stories about grasshoppers?\"  Ben Gile laid his finger along his nose and thought. Betty was sure he knew a hundred million stories, and that he could tell her something about anything she might ask for in all the world.  \"Well, once upon a time,\" the old man began, \"there was another old man who was a great deal wiser than I am, and a great deal richer, my dear, for he owned a whole kingdom and lived in a palace, and his name was--\"  \"Solomon!\" called out Betty, dancing up and down, out of pride in her own wisdom.  \"Right! And this other old man said:       \"There are four things which are little upon the earth, but      they are exceedingly wise:       \"The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their      meat in the summer;       \"The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses      in the rocks;       \"The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by      bands;       \"The spider taketh hold with her hands and is in kings'      palaces.\"  \"But that's not a story.\"  The guide shook his head. \"You don't know a story, child, when you hear one. It began, 'Once upon a time,' didn't it?\"  \"Yes, sir; but please tell me another.\"  \"Well, there are others in the Bible, my dear, about locusts and grasshoppers.\"  \"But, please, sir,\" said Betty, who was almost ready to cry, she was so teased--\"please tell me one of your _own_ stories.\"  Ben Gile began to swash his bucket up and down, up and down, in the stream until the water fairly rocked. Then he pulled the bucket out of the water, set it beside him, and reached out after a locust.  \"Here he is.\" There was a long pause. Betty thought he would never go on. \"Well, once upon a time there was a little army and all its uniforms were brown and green, and from the meanest soldier in the ranks to the lieutenant-commander this little army was made up of insects who belonged to the same tribe. Let me see--there were the grasshoppers and the locusts and the katydids and the crickets.\"  \"Please, sir, were they cousins?\"  \"I think they were, my dear. Yes, first cousins, and, unlike even my first cousins, they all have wings, and straight wings like this.\"  The guide gently spread out one of the wings.  \"Just where the back of your chest is these wings grow--two pairs of wings, my dear, and two pairs of wings mean a good deal more than two pairs of new shoes. This first pair is straight and narrow and hard, because it is meant to cover the gauzy wings underneath. Puff!\"  Away flew the locust.  \"You see, he doesn't use his first pair, but holds them out straight from his body while he spreads out the gauzy ones like a--like a--\"  \"Fan!\" shouted Betty, quite forgetting the tiny squirrel who had come up near her, and, at her shout, nearly jumped out of his little red jacket.  \"A yellow fan,\" said the old man. \"And some have a red fan. Well, I think,\" said he, reaching for his pail, \"there isn't going to be any more of this story.\"  \"Not any more? But there must be more, sir; I've seen hundreds and hundreds of them on a dusty road, and, please, they're just the color of the dirt.\"  The guide shook his head. \"Not to-day.\"  By this time Betty was so eager to have him go on that she had forgotten all about being afraid of him. \"And when they whir up from the road, sir, they say, 'Clack! clack! clack!'\"  The old man made a sound like the noise of a locust.  \"How does it make its mouth move, sir?\"  \"It doesn't make its mouth move, child. It makes the noise by striking the edges of the gauzy wings and hard wing covers together. See, this way!\" And the old man struck his arm and leg together. \"It has another fiddle, too, which it uses when it makes the long, rasping, drowsy sound of summer days. Then it rubs the rough edges of its hind leg against the edge of its wing-cover.\"  \"Please, is it happy, then?\" asked Betty.  \"Just as happy as a healthy locust, who lives in long, sweet-smelling grass and is contented with his own"]]]
