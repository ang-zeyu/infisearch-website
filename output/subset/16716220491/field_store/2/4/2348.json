It may be that relations or friends of that bear had mysteriously disappeared after the sounding of that voice.  Perhaps the animal in whose skin Rooney was encased had been a brother.  At all events, the increasing hullabaloo of the approaching Eskimo had the effect of intimidating the animal, for it retired quickly, though with evident sulkiness, from the scene.  A few seconds more, and Okiok dashed up, leaped from his vehicle, left the panting team to the control of Norrak, and ran eagerly to the prostrate figure.  Unwrapping the head so as to set it free, the Eskimo saw with intense satisfaction that the Kablunet was still alive.  He called at once to Norrak, who fetched from the sledge a platter made of a seal's shoulder-blade, on which was a mass of cooked food.  This he presented to the starving man, who, with a look of intense gratitude, but with no words, eagerly ate it up.  The Eskimo and his son meanwhile stood looking at him with an expression of mingled interest, awe, and surprise on their round faces.  When the meal was ended, Red Rooney, heaving a deep sigh of satisfaction, said, \"Thank God, and thank _you_, my friends!\"  There was reason for the increase of surprise with which this was received by the two natives, for this time the foreigner spoke to them in their own language.  \"Is the Kablunet a messenger from heaven,\" asked Okiok, with increased solemnity, \"that he speaks with the tongue of the Innuit?\"  \"No, my friend,\" replied Rooney, with a faint smile; \"I bring no message either from heaven or anywhere else.  I'm only a wrecked seaman.  But, after a fashion, you are messengers from heaven to _me_, and the message you bring is that I'm not to die just yet.  If it had not been for you, my friends, it strikes me I should have been dead by this time.  As to my speaking your lingo, it's no mystery.  I've learned it by livin' a long time wi' the traders in the south of Greenland, and I suppose I've got a sort o' talent that way; d'ye see?\"  Red Rooney delivered these remarks fluently in a curious sort of Eskimo language; but we have rendered it into that kind of English which the wrecked seaman was in the habit of using--chiefly because by so doing we shall give the reader a more correct idea of the character of the man.  \"We are very glad to see you,\" returned Okiok.  \"We have heard of you for many moons.  We have wished for you very hard.  Now you have come, we will treat you well.\"  \"Are your huts far off?\" asked the seaman anxiously.  \"Not far.  They are close to the ice-mountain--on the land.\"  \"Take me to them, then, like a good fellow, for I'm dead-beat, and stand much in need of rest.\"  The poor man was so helpless that he could not walk to the sledge when they unrolled him.  It seemed as if his power of will and energy had collapsed at the very moment of his rescue.  Up to that time the fear of death had urged him on, but now, feeling that he was, comparatively speaking, safe, he gave way to the languor which had so long oppressed him, and thus, the impulse of the will being removed, he suddenly became as helpless as an infant.  Seeing his condition, the father and son lifted him on the sledge, wrapped him in skins, and drove back to the huts at full speed.  Nuna was awaiting them outside, with eager eyes and beating heart, for the discovery of a real live Kablunet was to her an object of as solemn and anxious curiosity as the finding of a veritable living ghost might be to a civilised man.  But Nuna was not alone.  There were two other members of the household present, who had been absent when Okiok first arrived, and whom we will now introduce to the reader.  One was Nuna's only daughter, an exceedingly pretty girl--according to Eskimo notions of female beauty.  She was seventeen years of age, black-eyed, healthily-complexioned, round-faced, sweet-expressioned, comfortably stout, and unusually graceful--for an Eskimo.  Among her other charms, modesty and good-nature shone conspicuous.  She was in all respects a superior counterpart of her mother, and her name was Nunaga. Nuna was small, Nunaga was smaller.  Nuna was comparatively young, Nunaga was necessarily younger.  The former was kind, the latter was kinder.  The mother was graceful and pretty, the daughter was more graceful and prettier.  Nuna wore her hair gathered on the top of her head into a high top-knot, Nunaga wore a higher top-knot.  In regard to costume, Nuna wore sealskin boots the whole length of her legs--which were not long--and a frock or skirt reaching nearly to her knees, with a short tail in front and a long tail behind; Nunaga, being similarly clothed, had a shorter tail in front and a longer tail behind.  It may be interesting to note here that Eskimos are sometimes named because of qualities possessed, or appearance, or peculiar circumstances connected with them.  The word Nuna signifies \"land\" in Eskimo.  We cannot tell why this particular lady was named Land, unless it were that she was born on the land, and not on the ice; or perhaps because she was so nice that when any man came into her company he might have thought that he had reached the land of his hopes, and was disposed to settle down there and remain.  Certainly many of the Eskimo young men seemed to be of that mind until Okiok carried her off in triumph.  And let us tell you, reader, that a good and pretty woman is as much esteemed among the Eskimos as among ourselves.  We do not say that she is better treated; neither do we hint that she is sometimes treated worse.  The Eskimo word Nunaga signifies \"_my_ land,\" and was bestowed by Okiok on his eldest-born in a flood of tenderness at her birth.  Apologising for this philological digression, we proceed.  Besides Nuna and Nunaga there was a baby boy--a fat, oily, contented boy--without a name at that time, and without a particle of clothing of any sort, his proper condition of heat being maintained when out of doors chiefly by being carried between his mother's dress and her shoulders; also by being stuffed to repletion with blubber.  The whole family cried out vigorously with delight, in various keys, when the team came yelping home with the Kablunet.  Even the baby gave a joyous crow--in Eskimo.  But the exclamations were changed to pity when the Kablunet was assisted to rise, and staggered feebly towards the hut, even when supported by Okiok and his sons.  The sailor was not ignorant of Eskimo ways.  His residence in South Greenland had taught him many things.  He dropped, therefore, quite naturally--indeed gladly--on his hands and knees on coming to the mouth of the tunnel, and crept slowly into the hut, followed by the whole family, except Ermigit, who was left to unfasten the dogs.  The weather at the time was by no means cold, for spring was rapidly advancing; nevertheless, to one who had been so reduced in strength, the warmth of the Eskimo hut was inexpressibly grateful.  With a great sigh of relief the rescued man flung himself on the raised part of the floor on which Eskimos are wont to sit and sleep.  \"Thank God, and again I thank _you_, my friends!\" he said, repeating the phrase which he had already used, for the sudden change from despair to hope, from all but death to restored life, had filled his heart with gratitude.  \"You are weary?\" said Okiok.  \"Ay, ay--very weary; well-nigh to death,\" he replied.  \"Will the Kablunet sleep?\" asked Nuna, pointing to a couch of skins close behind the seaman.  Rooney looked round.  \"Thankee; yes, I will.\"  He crept to the couch, and dropped upon it, with his head resting on an eider-down pillow.  Like a tired infant, his eyes closed, and he was asleep almost instantaneously.  Seeing this, the Eskimos began to move about with care, and to speak in whispers, though it was needless caution, for in his condition the man would probably have continued to sleep through the wildest thunderstorm. Even when baby, tumbling headlong off the elevated floor, narrowly missed spiking himself on a walrus spear, and set up a yell that might have startled the stone deaf, the wearied Kablunet did not move.  Okiok did, however.  He moved smartly towards the infant, caught him by the throat, and almost strangled him in a fierce attempt to keep him quiet.  \"Stupid tumbler!\" he growled--referring to the child's general and awkward habit of falling--\"Can't you shut your mouth?\"  Curious similarity between the thoughts and words of civilised and savage man in similar circumstances!  And it is interesting to note the truth of what the song says:--  \"We little know what great things from little things may rise.\"  From that slight incident the Eskimo child derived his future name of \"Tumbler\"!  We forget what the precise Eskimo term is, but the English equivalent will do as well.  When supper-time arrived that night, Okiok and Nuna consulted as to whether they should waken their guest, or let him lie still--for, from the instant he lay down, he had remained without the slightest motion, save the slow, regular heaving of his broad chest.  \"Let him sleep.  He is tired,\" said Okiok.  \"But he must be hungry, and he is weak,\" said Nuna.  \"He can feed when he wakens,\" returned the man, admiring his guest as a collector might admire a foreign curiosity which he had just found.  \"Kablunets sleep sounder than Eskimos,\" remarked the woman.  \"Stupid one!  Your head is thick, like the skull of the walrus,\" said the man.  \"Don't you see that it is because he is worn-out?\"  Eskimos are singularly simple and straightforward in their speech.  They express their opinions with the utmost candour, and without the slightest intention of hurting each other's feelings.  Nuna took no offence at her husband's plain speaking, but continued to gaze with a gratified expression at the stranger.  And sooth to say Reginald Rooney was a pleasant object for contemplation, as well as a striking contrast to the men with whom Nuna had been hitherto associated.  His brow was broad;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21697"],["title","The Red Man's Revenge: A Tale of The Red River Flood (#1)"],["body","the sisters, is Louis Lambert.  The thickset youth behind him, with the shock of flaxen hair and imperceptible moustache, is Herr Winklemann, a German farmer's son, and a famed buffalo-hunter.  The ungainly man, of twenty-four apparently--or thereabouts--with the plain but kindly face, and the frame nearly as strong as that of the host himself, is Ian Macdonald. In appearance he is a rugged backwoodsman.  In reality he is the schoolmaster of that part of the widely-scattered colony.  The invitation to sit down was not accepted.  Daylight was short-lived in those regions at that season of the year.  They sallied forth to the work in hand.  \"You've had the target put up, Cora?\" asked Victor, as he went out.  \"Yes, in the old place.\"  \"Where is Tony?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Cora, looking round.  \"He was here just now, trying to scalp father.\"  \"You'll find him at the target before you, no doubt,\" said Elsie, putting away her moccasins as she rose to aid in the household preparations.  The target was placed against the bank of the river, so that the bullets might find a safe retreat.  The competitors stood at about a hundred yards' distance in front of it.  The weapons used were single-barrelled smooth-bores, with flint locks.  Percussion locks had not at that time come into fashion, and long ranges had not yet been dreamed of.  \"Come, open the ball, Lambert,\" said Victor.  The handsome youth at once stepped forward, and old Mr Ravenshaw watched him with an approving smile as he took aim.  Puff! went the powder in the pan, but no sound followed save the peal of laughter with which the miss-fire was greeted.  The touch-hole was pricked, and next time the ball sped to its mark.  It hit the target two inches above the bull's-eye.  The \"well done\" with which the shot was hailed was cut short by an appalling yell, and little Tony was seen to tumble from behind the target.  Rolling head over heels, he curled himself round in agony, sprang up with a spasmodic bound, dropped upon his haunches, turned over a complete somersault, fell on his back with a fearful shriek, and lay dead upon the snow!  The whole party rushed in consternation towards the boy, but before they had reached him he leaped up and burst into a fit of gleeful laughter, which ended in a cheer and a savage war-whoop as he scampered up the track which led to the house, and disappeared over the brow of the river's bank.  \"The imp was joking!\" exclaimed Mr Ravenshaw, as he stopped and wiped the cold perspiration from his brow.  At that moment a Red Indian appeared on the scene, in his blanket robe, paint, and feathers.  Attracted by the shot, he had come to look on. Now, the old fur-trader's nerves had received a tremendous shock, and the practical jest which the pride of his heart had perpetrated had roused the irascibility of his nature, so that an explosion became unavoidable.  In these circumstances the arrival of the Indian seemed opportune, for the old gentleman knew that this particular savage was a chief, and had visited the colony for the purpose of making inquiries into the new religion reported to be taught by certain white men in black garments; and Mr Ravenshaw, besides having very little regard for missionaries, had a very strong contempt for those Indians who became their disciples.  He therefore relieved himself on the red man.  \"What do you want here, Petawanaquat?\" he demanded sternly, in the language of the Indian.  \"The Little Wolf,\" replied the Indian, referring to himself, for such was the interpretation of his name, \"wishes to see how his white brothers shoot.\"  \"Let the Little Wolf put his tail between his legs and be gone,\" cried the angry old man.  \"He is not wanted here.  Come, be off!\"  The chief looked straight in the eyes of the trader with a dark scowl, then, turning slowly on his heel, stalked solemnly away.  There was an irrepressible laugh at this episode as the group of marksmen returned to their former position.  Mr Ravenshaw, however, soon left them and returned home.  Here he found Miss Trim in a state of considerable agitation; she had just encountered the redskin!  Miss Trim was a poor relation of Mrs Ravenshaw.  She had been invited by her brother-in-law to leave England and come to Red River to act as governess to Tony and assistant-companion in the family.  She had arrived that autumn in company with a piano, on which she was expected to exercise Elsie and Cora.  Petawanaquat, being the first \"really wild and painted savage\" she had seen, made a deep impression on her.  \"Oh, Mr Ravenshaw, I have seen _such_ an object in the garden!\" she exclaimed, in a gushing torrent--she always spoke in a torrent--\"and it was all I could do to stagger into the house without fainting.  Such eyes! with black cheeks and a red nose--at least, it looked red, but I was in such a state that I couldn't make sure whether it was the nose or the chin, and my shoe came off as I ran away, having broken the tie in the morning.  And such a yell as it gave!--the creature, not the shoe-tie--but I escaped, and peeped out of the upper window--the one in the gable, you know, with the green blind, where you can see the garden from end to end, and I found it had disappeared, though I can't understand--\"  \"Tut, tut, Miss Trim; how you do gallop!  Was it a beast?\" asked the old trader.  \"A beast?  No; a man--a savage.\"  \"Oh!  I understand; it was that scoundrel Petawanaquat,\" said Sam Ravenshaw, with a laugh; \"he's Little Wolf by name, and a big thief by practice, no doubt.  You needn't fear him, however, he's not so dangerous as he looks, and I gave him a rebuff just now that will make him shy of Willow Creek.--Ha, Tony, you rascal!  Come here, sir.\"  Tony came at once, with such a gleeful visage that his father's intended chastisement for the recent practical joke ended in a parental caress.  Bitterly did Ian Macdonald repent of his agreeing to join the shooting party that day.  Owing to some defect in his vision or nervous system, he was a remarkably bad shot, though in everything else he was an expert and stalwart backwoodsman, as well as a good scholar.  But when his friend Victor invited him he could not refuse, because it offered him an opportunity of spending some time in the society of Elsie Ravenshaw, and that to him was heaven upon earth!  Little of her society, however, did the unfortunate teacher enjoy that day, for handsome Louis Lambert engrossed not only Elsie, but the mother and father as well.  He had beaten all his competitors at the target, but, to do him justice, did not boast of that; neither did he make any reference to the fact that Ian had twice missed the target, though he did not spare the bad shooting of some of the other youths; this, no doubt, because he and Ian had been fast friends for many years.  Jealousy--at least on the part of Ian--now seemed about to interfere with the old friendship.  Moreover, Lambert had brought to Mrs Ravenshaw a gift of a collar made of the claws of a grizzly bear, shot by himself in the Rocky Mountains.  Elsie admired the collar with genuine interest, and said she would give anything to possess one like it.  Cora, with the coquettishness of sixteen, said, with a laugh and a blush, that she would not accept such a ridiculous thing if it were offered to her.  Ian Macdonald groaned in spirit, for, with his incapacity to shoot, he knew that Elsie's wish could never be gratified by _him_.  Seeing that Lambert was bent on keeping Elsie as much as possible to himself, Ian devoted himself to Cora, but Cora was cross.  Feeling it up-hill work, he soon rose to say good-bye, and left Willow Creek before the others.  \"Don't look so crestfallen, man,\" said old Mr Ravenshaw heartily, as he shook hands; \"it's nobler work to teach the young idea how to shoot than to be able to hit a bull's-eye.\"  \"True, but he who cannot hit a bull's-eye,\" returned Ian, with a smile, \"can scarcely be expected to touch a maiden's--I mean a grizzly's heart.\"  A shout of laughter from Lambert greeted him as he left the house.  His way home lay over the frozen bed of the river.  Victor accompanied him part of the way.  \"That was a strange slip for an unromantic fellow like you to make about a maiden's heart, Ian,\" said Victor, looking up at the rugged countenance of his friend.  \"`Unromantic,' eh?  Well, I suppose I am.\"  \"Of course you are,\" said Victor, with the overweening assurance of youth.  \"Come, let's sit down here for a few minutes and discuss the point.\"  He sat down on a snowdrift; Ian kicked off his snowshoes and leaned against the bank.  \"You're the most grave, sensible, good-natured, matter-of-fact, unsentimental, unselfish fellow I ever met with,\" resumed Victor.  \"If you were a romantic goose I wouldn't like you half as much as I do.\"  \"Men are sometimes romantic without being geese,\" returned Ian; \"but I have not time to discuss that point just now.  Tell me, for I am anxious about it, have you spoken to your father about selling the field with the knoll to my father?\"  \"Yes, and he flatly refused to sell it.  I'm really sorry, Ian, but you know how determined my father is.  Once he says a thing he sticks to it, even though it should be to his own disadvantage.\"  \"That's bad, Victor, very bad.  It will raise ill-blood between them, and estrange our families.  You think there's no chance?\"  \"None whatever.\"  \"One more word before we part.  Do you know much about that redskin whom your father called Petawanaquat?\"  \"Not much, except that he has come from a considerable distance to make inquiries, he says, about the Christian religion.  He has been prowling about our place for a few days, and father, who has no great love to missionaries, and has strong suspicions of converted Indians, has twice treated him rather roughly.\"  \"I'm sorry to hear that, Victor.  These fellows are sometimes very revengeful.  If you'll be advised by me you'll keep a sharp eye upon Petawanaquat.  There, I'll say no more.  You know I'm "]]]
