Can you tell me where he lives? because I still owe him the half of the money promised for permission to accompany him on this trip, and should not like to remain his debtor.\"  \"Ja, I know where he lives.  He's a bad specimen of a Dutch farmer in every respect, except as to size.  He lives quite close to our farm-- more's the pity!--and is one of those men who do their best to keep up bad feeling between the frontier-men and the Kafirs.  The evil deeds of men such as he are represented in England, by designing or foolish persons, as being characteristic of the whole class of frontier farmers, hence we are regarded as a savage set, while, in my humble opinion, we are no worse than the people of other colonies placed in similar circumstances--perhaps better than some of them.  Do you know anything of our past history?\"  \"Not much,\" replied Considine, throwing away the remnant of the stick he had been whittling, and commencing on another piece.  \"Of course I know that the Cape was first doubled by the Portuguese commander Bartholomew Diaz in, I think, 1486, and after him by Vasco de Gama, and that the Dutch formed the first settlement on it under Van Riebeek in 1652, but beyond this my knowledge of Cape history and dates is hazy and confused. I know, however, that your forefathers mismanaged the country for about a century and a half, after which it finally came into possession of the British in 1806.\"  \"Humph!\" ejaculated Hans, while a shade of displeasure flitted for a moment across his broad visage.  \"'Tis a pity your reading had not extended farther, for then you would have learned that from 1806 the colony has been mismanaged by _your_ countrymen, and the last fruit of their mismanagement has been a bloody war with the Kafirs, which has only just been concluded.  Peace has been made only this year, and the frontier is now at rest.  But who will rebuild the burned homesteads of this desolated land? who will reimburse the ruined farmers? above all, who will restore the lost lives?\"  The young Dutchman's eyes kindled, and his stern face flushed as he spoke, for although his own homestead had escaped the ruthless savage, friends and kindred had suffered deeply in the irruption referred to, which took place in 1819, and one or two of his intimate comrades had found early graves in the wild karroo.  Considine, sympathising with his companion's feelings, said, \"I doubt not that you have much to complain of, for there is no colony under the sun that escapes from the evil acts of occasional bad or incompetent Governors.  But pray do not extend your indignation to me or to my countrymen at large, for few of us know the true merits of your case. And tell me, what was the origin of the war which has just ended?\"  The young farmer's anger had passed away as quickly as it came.  Letting his bulky frame sink back into the reclining position from which he had partially risen, he replied--  \"Just the old story--self-will and stupidity.  That domineering fellow Lord Charles Somerset, intending to check the plundering of the colony by Kafirs, chose to enter into treaties with Gaika as paramount chief of Kafirland, although Gaika himself told him plainly that he was not paramount chief.  Of course the other chiefs were indignant, and refused to recognise such treaties.  They did more: they made war on Gaika, and beat him, whereupon Somerset, instead of leaving the niggers to fight their own battles, must needs send a great commando of military and burghers to `restore' Gaika to his so-called supremacy.  This was done. The chief T'slambi was driven from his villages, and no fewer than 11,000 head of cattle were handed over to Gaika.  While this was going on at the eastern frontier, the Kafirs invaded the colony at other points, drove in the small military posts, ravaged the whole land, and even attacked the military headquarters at Grahamstown, where, however, they were defeated with great slaughter.  After this a large force was sent to drive them out of their great stronghold, the Fish River bush. This was successfully accomplished, and then, at last, the right thing was done.  The Governor met the Kafir chiefs, when it was agreed that they should evacuate the country between the Great Fish River and the Keiskamma, and that the territory so evacuated should form _neutral ground_.  So matters stand at present, but I have no faith in Kafirs. It is their pride to lie, their business to make war, and their delight to plunder.\"  \"But is it not the same with _all_ savages?\" asked Considine.  \"Doubtless it is, therefore _no_ savages ought to be trusted, as civilised men are trusted, till they cease to be savages.  We trust them too much.  Time will show.--By the way, I hear that a new move is about to be attempted.  Rumour says that your Government is going to send out a strong party of emigrants to colonise the eastern frontier.  Is this true?\"  \"It is,\" replied Considine; \"I wonder that you have not heard all about it before now.\"  \"Good reasons for that.  For one thing, I have just returned from a long trip into the north-western districts, and I have not been in the way of hearing news for some time.  Besides, we have no newspapers in the colony.  Everything comes to us by word of mouth, and that slowly.  Tell me about this matter.\"  \"There is little to tell,\" returned Considine, replenishing the fire with a thick branch, which sent up a magnificent display of sparks and scared away a hyena and two jackals that had been prowling round the camp-fence.  \"The fact is that there is a great deal of distress in England just now, and a redundant population of idlers, owing to the cessation of continental wars.  This seems to have put it into the heads of some people in power to encourage emigration to the eastern part of this colony.  In the House of Commons 50,000 pounds have been voted in aid of the plan, and it seems that when the proposal was first made public, no fewer than 90,000 would-be emigrants applied for leave to come out here.  Of these I believe 4000 have been selected, and twenty-three vessels chartered to convey them out.  This is all I could learn before I left England, but I suppose we shall have more light on the subject ere many months have gone by.\"  \"A good plan,\" said the Dutchman, with a grim smile, \"but I pity the emigrants!\"  As Considine's head drooped at this point, and his eyes winked with that owlish look which indicates the approach of irresistible sleep, Hans Marais rose, and, spreading a large kaross or blanket of leopard skin on the ground, invited his companion to lie down thereon.  The youth willingly complied, stretched himself beside the Dutchman, and almost instantly fell sound asleep.  Hans spread a lighter covering over himself and his comrade, and, with his head on his saddle, lay for a long time gazing tranquilly at the stars, which shone with an intensity of lustre peculiar to that region of the southern hemisphere, while the yelling cries of jackals and the funereal moaning of spotted hyenas, with an occasional distant roar from the king of beasts, formed an appropriate lullaby.    CHAPTER TWO.  INTRODUCES A CAPE DUTCHMAN AND HIS FAMILY, AND SHOWS THE UNCERTAINTY OF HUMAN PLANS.  The break of day found Charlie Considine and Hans Marais galloping lightly over the karroo towards a range of mountains which, on the previous evening, had appeared like a faint line of blue on the horizon.  The sun was just rising in a blaze of splendour, giving promise of an oppressive day, when the horsemen topped a ridge beyond which lay the primitive buildings of a frontier farm.  Considine uttered an exclamation of surprise, and looked inquiringly at his companion.  \"My father's farm,\" said Hans, drawing rein and advancing at a foot-pace.  \"A lovely spot,\" returned his companion, \"but I cannot say much for the buildings.\"  \"They are well suited to their purpose nevertheless,\" said Hans; \"besides, would it be wise to build fine houses for Kafirs to burn?\"  \"Is being burnt by Kafirs the necessary end of all frontier farms?\" asked Considine, with a smile.  \"Not the necessary, but the probable end.  Many a one has been burnt in times gone by, and many a one will be burnt again, if the Government and people in England do not recognise and admit the two great facts, that the interest as well as the main desire of the frontier settler is _peace_, while the chief delight as well as business of the Kafir is _war_.  But I suppose that you, being an Englishman, will not believe that until conviction is forced on you by experience.--Come, I will introduce you to one of those colonists who are supposed to be such discontented fire-eaters; I think he will receive you hospitably.\"  The young farmer put spurs to his horse as he spoke, and dashed away over the plain, closely followed by his new friend, who was not sorry to drop the conversation, being almost entirely ignorant of the merits of the question raised.  The style of the group of buildings to which they drew near was not entirely unfamiliar to Considine, for he had passed one or two similar farms, belonging to Cape Dutchmen, on his trip from the sea-coast to the interior.  There were about this farm, however, a few prominent points of difference.  The cottages, being built of sun-dried bricks, were little better than mud-huts, but there were more of them than Considine had hitherto seen on such farms, and the chief dwelling, in particular, displayed some touches of taste which betokened superior refinement in the inhabitants.  The group lay in a hollow on the margin of an insignificant stream, whose course through the plain was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21702"],["title","Shifting Winds: A Tough Yarn (#1)"],["body","they charge me with mental imbecility when I suggest that things should be put right _at once_.  They counsel delay, and when the dispute reaches a certain stage they smile at me with contempt, or pity, or they storm, according to individual temperament, and usually wind up with a rasping reiteration of their original opinions, highly peppered and salted, and an assurance that I have been born at least a century before my time.  If the men of the next century are destined to do good, \"as their hands find opportunity,\" without previous delay until thousands of opportunities are lost and gone for ever; if those who put their hands to a piece of work shall carry it out with vigour in their _own_ lifetime; if those who counsel delay shall mean due time for full consideration by _themselves_, and shall _not_ mean an extended procrastination which shall free themselves from worry, and leave their work to be handed down as a legacy to their children, who shall likewise hand it down to _their_ children, and so on _ad infinitum_ until \"delay\" shall become a synonym for death and destruction to tens of thousands of better men than themselves,--if this shall be the sentiment and practice of the men of next century, then I confess that my sympathies are with them, and I really suspect that I must have got into the wrong century by mistake.  But as the position is irremediable now, I suppose I must, in an imbecile sort of fashion, go on my way rejoicing--if I can-- sorrowing if I cannot rejoice.  Mrs Bingley having more than once threatened to scratch my face when I have ventured to express the last sentiment, it may be perhaps as well to change the subject and return to Billy Gaff, the charming child, _alias_ the Bu'ster.  Billy deserves to be somewhat particularly introduced, because, besides being an actor in this tale, he was a boy of strong character.  If I were to sum him up and reduce the total to a concentrated essence, the result would be a sentence to the following effect:--Billy Gaff had a will of his own!  Perhaps I should say a very strong will of his own. For instance, he, on several different occasions, willed to screw off the spout of the family tea-pot, a pewter one, and, having willed to do it, he did it.  Again he willed, more than once, to smash a pane of glass in the solitary window of the family mansion, and he _did_ smash a pane of glass in that window; nay, more, in consequence of being heartily whacked for the deed, he immediately willed to smash, _and_ smashed, a second pane, and was proceeding to will and smash a third when he was caught up by his mother, beaten almost into the condition of a mummy, and thrust under the clothes of the family bed, which immediately creaked as if with convulsions, and tossed its blankets about in apparent agony.  On the present occasion the Bu'ster had awakened out of a sound sleep to the conviction that he was hungry.  Observing the loaf on the table, he immediately willed to have a second supper, and arising, donned his father's pea-jacket, in order to enjoy the meal more thoroughly.  It was the sudden removal of the said loaf by his mother to an unreachable shelf that induced the youthful Billy to stand in the middle of the room and howl, as already described.  He was still engaged in emulating the storm, and Mrs Gaff, utterly indifferent to him, had cast another glance at the horrified clock, and remarked to her little girl Tottie, that \"Uncle John must have found work on the shore, for he was long of coming,\" when a heavy tread was heard in the little porch outside the door.  \"Hold yer noise,\" said Mrs Gaff sternly.  Billy obeyed, not by any means in consequence of the command, but because he was curious to know who was about to enter, and meant to resume yelling immediately after his curiosity on this point should be satisfied.  The door opened, and a strong-built seaman stepped into the room, and looked at the family with a quiet smile on his sunburnt face.  His hair and garments were dripping with water, as if he had just walked out of the sea.  On beholding him the family rose and stood for a moment speechless. Billy sat down on the floor in that prompt manner which is peculiar to young children when they lose their balance; simultaneously with the shock of being seated the word \"faither\" burst from his lips.  Mrs Gaff uttered a suppressed cry, and ran into the wet man's arms.  Tottie and the Bu'ster each ran at a leg, and hugging it violently, squeezed a cataract of salt water into their respective bosoms.  \"Stephen, lad, is't you?\" said the wife, raising her head for a moment and looking up in the man's face.  \"Ay, dear lass, wrecked again; but safe home, thank God.\"  Mrs Gaff was not wont to give way to the melting mood, but she could not restrain a few tears of joy.  Tottie, observing this, cried from sympathy; and the Bu'ster, not to be outdone, willed, began, and carried into execution, a series of true British cheers, that could not have been surpassed, perhaps could not have been equalled, by any boy of his age in or out of the Royal Navy.    CHAPTER TWO.  WRECKED, RESCUED, AND RESUSCITATED--MRS. NIVEN RECEIVES A SURPRISE, ALSO THE GIFT OF A CHILD.  On the same dark tempestuous night of which I write, a little ship was wrecked on the east coast of England.  She had sailed from the antipodes, had weathered many a gale, had crossed the great ocean in safety, had sighted the lights and the cliffs of \"home,\" and was dashed to pieces at last on the rocks within two hours' sail of the port to which she was bound.  Hundreds of ships, great and small, were wrecked on the coasts of Britain during that memorable gale.  The little ship to which I refer was one of the many in regard to which the newspapers said, \"she was dashed to pieces, and all hands perished.\"  But in this particular case all hands had not perished: two lives had been spared, unknown to journalists and coastguardsmen.  It was the dead of night when the vessel struck.  The spot was lonely, at least a mile distant from human habitations.  No anxious eyes on shore saw her quiver as each successive billow lifted her up and hurled her cruelly down; no sorrowing ear heard the shriek of despair that rose above the yelling storm, when, in little more than ten minutes, the vessel broke up, and left the crew and passengers to perish within sight of their native land.  There was one man among the number who did not shriek, who did not despair.  He was not a hero of romance whose soul raised him above the fear of sudden death--no, he was only a true-hearted British tar, whose frame was very strong, whose nerves were tightly strung and used to danger.  He had made up his mind to save his life if he could; if he should fail--what then?  He never thought of \"what then,\" because, in regard to terrestrial matters, he had not been accustomed to cast his thoughts so far in advance of present exigencies.  Just before the ship broke up, this man was standing on the lee bulwark, holding by the shrouds of the mainmast, the lower part of which was still standing.  A lady and gentleman clung to each other, and to the rigging close beside him.  They were husband and wife.  Both were comparatively young, and up to that night had been full of hope and high spirits.  The husband with his right arm encircled his wife, and grasped the rigging; with his left, he pressed their little girl to his breast over which flowed the fair hair of the little one, drenched and dishevelled.  The father was a brave man and strong, but his face was very pale, for he felt that courage and strength could not avail to save both wife and child in such a raging sea.  An occasional upward glance of his eye seemed to indicate that he sought comfort from God in his extremity.  \"You'll never manage 'em both, sir; let me have the child,\" said the strong seaman, suddenly grasping the little girl, and attempting to unlock her arms which were tightly clasped round her father's neck.  The father hesitated, but a terrific wave was rushing towards the doomed ship.  Without even the comfort of a hurried kiss he resigned the child. The young mother stretched out her arms towards her, uttering a piteous cry.  At that moment the ship rose on the billow's crest as if it were no heavier than a flake of the driving foam--a crash followed--it was gone, and the crew were left struggling in the sea.  The struggle was short with most of them.  Previous exposure and anxiety had already quite exhausted all but the strongest among the men, and even these were unable to withstand the influence of the ice-cold water more than a few seconds.  Some were struck by portions of the wreck and killed at once.  Others sank without an effort to save themselves.  A few swam with unnatural vigour for a yard or two, and then went down with a gurgling cry; but in a very few minutes the work of death was complete.  All were gone except the strong seaman, who clasped the little child in his left arm and buffeted the billows with his right.  Once and again were they overwhelmed; but as often did they rise above the foam to continue the battle.  It was a terrible fight.  A piece of wreck struck the man on his back and well-nigh broke it; then a wave arched high above them, fell with a crash, and drove them nearly to the bottom, so that the child was rendered insensible, and the strong man was nearly choked before he rose again to the surface to gasp the precious air.  At last a wave broke behind them, caught them on its crest, and hurled them on a beach of sand.  To cling to this while the water retired was the fiercest part of the conflict--the turning-point in the battle.  The wave swept back and left the man on his hands and knees.  He rose and staggered forward a few paces ere the next wave rushed upon him, compelling him to fall again on hands and knees and drive his bleeding fingers deep down into the shingle.  When the water once more retired, he rose and stumbled on till"]]]
