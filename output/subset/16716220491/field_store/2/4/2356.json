As my old chum approached to greet me on the lawn before breakfast the day following, I could not help admiring his fine, tall, athletic figure.  I don't know how it is, but I have always felt, somehow, as if I looked up at him, although we were both exactly the same height--six feet one without our boots.  I suppose it must have been owing to his standing so erect, while I slouched a little.  Perhaps my looking up to him mentally had something to do with it.  \"You'll come to-day, won't you?\"  I said, referring to the experiments.  \"Of course I will, old boy; but,\" he added, with a smile, \"only on one condition.\"  \"What may that be?\"  \"That you don't bother Bella with minute details.\"  Of course I promised not to say a word unless asked for explanations, and after breakfast we all went to a part of the grounds which I wished to bring under cultivation.  It was at that time encumbered with several large trees, old roots, and a number of boulders.  \"Come along with us, Lancey,\" I said to the groom, who was also my laboratory assistant, and whom I met in the stable-yard, the scene of his memorable blowing-up.  \"I am about to try the effect of an explosive, and wish you to understand the details.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Lancey, with a respectful touch of his cap; \"I must say, sir, if you'll allow me, I never knowed any one like you, sir, for goin' into details except one, and that one--\"  \"Ah, yes, I know, that was your friend the Scotch boy,\" said I, interrupting; but Lancey was a privileged servant, and would not be interrupted.  \"Yes, sir,\" he resumed, \"the Scotch boy Sandy.  We was at school together in Edinburgh, where I got the most o' my edication, and I never did see such a boy, sir, for goin' into--\"  \"Yes, yes, Lancey, I know; but I haven't time to talk about him just now.  We are going to the bit of waste ground in the hollow; follow us there.\"  I was obliged to cut him short, because this Scotch hero of his was a subject on which he could not resist dilating on the slightest encouragement.  Arrived at the waste ground, we met the manager of a neighbouring mine, who was deeply learned in everything connected with blasting.  \"I have brought my mother and sister, you see, Mr Jones,\" said I, as we approached.  \"They don't quite believe in the giant-power which is under your control; they seem to think that it is only a little stronger than gunpowder.\"  \"We can soon change their views on that point,\" said the manager, with a slight bow to the ladies, while I introduced Nicholas as an officer of the Russian army.  \"This is one of the stones you wish to blast, is it not?\" said Mr Jones, laying his hand on an enormous boulder that weighed probably several tons.  \"It is,\" I answered.  The manager was a man of action--grave of countenance and of few words. He drew a flask from his pocket and emptied its contents, a large quantity of gunpowder, on the boulder.  Asking us to stand a little back, he applied a slow match to the heap, and retired several paces.  In a few seconds the powder went off with a violent puff and a vast cloud of smoke.  The result was a little shriek of alarm from my mother, and an exclamation from Bella.  \"Not much effect from that, you see,\" said the manager, pointing to the blackened stone, yet it was a large quantity of powder, which, if fired in a cavity inside the stone, would have blown it to pieces.  \"Here, now, is a small quantity of dynamite.\"  (He produced a cartridge about two inches in length, similar to that which I had shown to my mother at breakfast.) \"Into this cartridge I shall insert a detonator cap, which is fastened to the end of a Pickford fuse--thus.\"  As he spoke, he inserted into the cartridge the end of the fuse, to which was attached a small cap filled with fulminate of mercury, and tied it tightly up.  This done, he laid the cartridge on the top of the boulder, placed two or three similar cartridges beside it, and covered all with a small quantity of sand, leaving the other end of the fuse projecting.  \"Why the sand?\" asked Bella.  \"Because a slight amount of confinement is advantageous,\" replied Mr Jones.  \"If I were to bore a short hole in the stone, and put the dynamite therein, the result would be still more effective; but the covering I have put on it will suffice, and will serve all the better to show the great difference between this explosive and gunpowder.\"  \"But,\" said my mother, who had a tendency to become suddenly interested in things when she began to have a faint understanding of them; \"but, Mr Jones, you did not give the powder fair play.  If you had covered _it_ with sand, would not its effect have been more powerful?\"  \"Not on the stone, madam; it would only have blown off its covering with violence, that would have been all.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you will retire behind the shelter of that old beech-tree, I will light the fuse.\"  We did as we were desired.  The manager lighted the fuse, and followed us.  In a few moments there occurred an explosion so violent that the huge boulder was shattered into several pieces, which were quite small enough to be lifted and carted away.  \"Most amazing!\" exclaimed Bella, with enthusiasm.  It was quite obvious that she had no anticipation of such a thorough result.  Nicholas, too, who I may mention had no natural turn of taste for such matters, was roused to a state of inquiry.  To a question put by him, Mr Jones explained that, taking its powers into consideration, dynamite was cheaper than gunpowder, and that it saved much labour, as it would have taken two men a considerable time to have bored an ordinary blasthole in the boulder he had just broken up.  I now led the way to another part of the ground on which grew a large beech-tree, whose giant roots took a firm grasp of the ground.  It was a hundred years old at least; about twelve feet in circumference, and sixty feet high.  One similar tree I had had cut down; but the labour had been very great, and the removal of the stump excessively troublesome as well as costly.  Mr Jones now went to work at the forest-giant.  In the ground underneath the tree he ordered Lancey to make a hole with a crowbar. Into this he pressed some cartridges of dynamite with a wooden rammer. Then the cartridge, with the detonator inside of it; and the fuse, extending from its mouth, was placed in contact with the charge under the tree.  The hole was next closed up with some earth, leaving about a foot of the fuse outside.  The light was then applied, and we retired to a safe distance.  In a few moments the charge exploded.  The tree seemed to rise from its bed.  All the earth under it was blown out, and the roots were torn up and broken, with the exception of four of the largest, which were fully ten inches in diameter.  A small charge of dynamite inserted under each of these completed the work, and the old giant, slowly bowing forward, laid his venerable head upon the ground.  Another charge was next placed in the soil under some loose and decayed roots, which were easily broken to pieces, so as to permit of their removal.  Thus, in a short time and at little cost, were trees and roots and boulders torn up and shattered.  \"But is dynamite not very dangerous, Mr Jones?\" asked my mother, as we walked slowly homeward.  \"Not at all dangerous,--at least not worth speaking of,\" replied the manager; \"nitro-glycerine by itself is indeed very dangerous, being easily exploded by concussion or mere vibration; but when mixed with infusorial earth and thus converted into dynamite, it is one of the safest explosives in existence--not quite so safe, indeed, as gun-cotton, but much more so than gunpowder.  Any sort of fire will explode gunpowder, but any sort of fire will not explode dynamite; it will only cause it to burn.  It requires a detonator to explode it with violence.  Without its detonator, dynamite is a sleeping giant.\"  \"Ay, mother,\" said I, taking up the subject, \"the case stands thus: gunpowder is a big athlete, who slumbers lightly; any spark can wake him to violent action: but dynamite is a bigger athlete, who sleeps so soundly that a spark or flame can only rouse him to moderate rage; it requires a special shake to make him wide-awake, but when thus roused his fury is terrific, as you have just seen.  And now,\" I added, as we drew near the house, \"we will change the subject, because I have this morning received two letters, which demand the united consideration of our whole party.  I will therefore call up Bella and Nicholas, who have fallen behind, as usual.  Mr Jones will excuse my talking of family matters for a few minutes, as replies must be sent by return of post.\"  I then explained that one of the letters was an invitation to me and my mother and sister, with any friends who might chance to be visiting us, to go to Portsmouth to witness a variety of interesting experiments with torpedoes and such warlike things; while the other letter was an offer by a friend, of a schooner-built yacht for a moderate sum.  \"Now, Nicholas,\" said I, apologetically, \"I'm sorry to give you such an explosive reception, but it cannot be helped.  If you don't care about torpedoes, you may remain here with my mother and Bella; but if you would like to go, I shall be happy to introduce you to one or two of my naval friends.  For myself, I must go, because--\"  \"We will all go, Jeff,\" interrupted Bella; \"nothing could be more appropriate as a sequel to this morning's experiments.  A day among the torpedoes will be most interesting, won't it?\"  She looked up at Nicholas, on whose arm she leaned.  He looked down with that peculiar smile of his which seemed to lie more in his eyes than on his lips, and muttered something about a day anywhere being, etcetera, etcetera.  My mother remarked that she did not understand exactly what a torpedo was, and looked at me for an explanation."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21706"],["title","Twice Bought (#1)"],["body","tly.  After a time he began to mutter to himself in broken sentences.  \"Fred is mistaken--_must_ be mistaken.  There is no law here.  Law must be taken into one's own hands.  It cannot be wrong to rob a robber.  It is not robbery to take back one's own.  Foul means are admissible when fair--yet it _is_ a sneaking thing to do!  Ha! who said it was sneaking?\"  (He started and thrust his hands through his hair.) \"Bah! Lantry, your grog is too fiery.  It was the grog that spoke, not conscience.  Pooh!  I don't believe in conscience.  Come, Tom, don't be a fool, but go and--Mother!  What has _she_ got to do with it?  Lantry's fire-water didn't bring _her_ to my mind.  No, it _is_ Fred, confound him!  He's always suggesting what she would say in circumstances which she has never been in and could not possibly understand.  And he worries me on the plea that he promised her to stick by me through evil report and good report.  I suppose that means through thick and thin.  Well, he's a good fellow is Fred, but weak.  Yes, I've made up my mind to do it and I _will_ do it.\"  He turned hastily as he spoke, and was soon lost in the little belt of woodland that lay between the lake and the miner's camp.  It pleased Gashford to keep his gold in a huge leathern bag, which he hid in a hole in the ground within his tent during the day, and placed under his pillow during the night.  It pleased him also to dwell and work alone, partly because he was of an unsociable disposition, and partly to prevent men becoming acquainted with his secrets.  There did not seem to be much fear of the big miner's secrets being discovered, for Lynch law prevailed in the camp at that time, and it was well known that death was the usual punishment for theft.  It was also well known that Gashford was a splendid shot with the revolver, as well as a fierce, unscrupulous man.  But strong drink revealed that which might have otherwise been safe.  When in his cups Gashford sometimes became boastful, and gave hints now and then which were easily understood.  Still his gold was safe, for, apart from the danger of the attempt to rob the bully, it would have been impossible to discover the particular part of his tent-floor in which the hole was dug, and, as to venturing to touch his pillow while his shaggy head rested on it, no one was daring enough to contemplate such an act although there were men there capable of doing almost anything.  Here again, however, strong drink proved to be the big miner's foe. Occasionally, though not often, Gashford drank so deeply as to become almost helpless, and, after lying down in his bed, sank into a sleep so profound that it seemed as if he could not have been roused even with violence.  He was in this condition on the night in which his victim made up his mind to rob him.  Despair and brandy had united to render Brixton utterly reckless; so much so, that instead of creeping stealthily towards his enemy's tent, an act which would probably have aroused the suspicion of a light sleeper, he walked boldly up, entered it, raised Gashford's unconscious head with one hand, pulled out the bag of gold with the other, put it on his shoulder, and coolly marched out of the camp.  The audacity of the deed contributed largely to its success.  Great was the rage and consternation of Gashford when he awoke the following morning and found that his treasure had disappeared.  Jumping at once to the conclusion that it had been stolen by Brixton, he ran to that youth's tent and demanded to know where the thief had gone to.  \"What do you mean by the thief?\" asked Fred Westly, with misgiving at his heart.  \"I mean your chum, Tom Brixton,\" shouted the enraged miner.  \"How do you know he's a thief?\" asked Westly.  \"I didn't come here to be asked questions by you,\" said Gashford. \"Where has he gone to, I say?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"That's a lie!\" roared the miner, clenching his fist in a threatening manner.  \"Poor Tom!  I wish I did know where you have gone!\" said Fred, shaking his head sadly as he gazed on the floor, and taking no notice whatever of the threatening action of his visitor.  \"Look here now, Westly,\" said Gashford, in a low suppressed voice, shutting the curtain of the tent and drawing a revolver from his pocket, \"you know something about this matter, and you know _me_.  If you don't tell me all you know and where your chum has bolted to, I'll blow your brains out as sure as there's a God in heaven.\"  \"I thought,\" said Westly, quietly, and without the slightest symptom of alarm, \"you held the opinion that there is no God and no heaven.\"  \"Come, young fellow, none o' your religious chaff, but answer my question.\"  \"Nothing is farther from my thoughts than chaffing you,\" returned Westly, gently, \"and if the mere mention of God's name is religion, then you may claim to be one of the most religious men at the diggings, for you are constantly praying Him to curse people.  I have already answered your question, and can only repeat that I _don't know_ where my friend Brixton has gone to.  But let me ask, in turn, what has happened to _you_?\"  There was no resisting the earnest sincerity of Fred's look and tone, to say nothing of his cool courage.  Gashford felt somewhat abashed in spite of himself.  \"What has happened to me?\" he repeated, bitterly.  \"The worst that could happen has happened.  My gold has been stolen, and your chum is the man who has cribbed it.  I know that as well as if I had seen him do it. But I'll hunt him down and have it out of him with interest; with interest, mark you--if I should have to go to the ends o' the 'arth to find him.\"  Without another word Gashford thrust the revolver into his pocket, flung aside the tent curtain, and strode away.  Meanwhile Tom Brixton, with the gold in a game-bag slung across his shoulder, was speeding down the valley, or mountain gorge, at the head of which the Pine Tree Diggings lay, with all the vigour and activity of youthful strength, but with none of the exultation that might be supposed to characterise a successful thief.  On the contrary, a weight like lead seemed to lie on his heart, and the faces of his mother and his friend, Fred Westly, seemed to flit before him continually, gazing at him with sorrowful expression.  As the fumes of the liquor which he had drunk began to dissipate, the shame and depression of spirit increased, and his strength, great though it was, began to give way.  By that time, however, he had placed many a mile between him and the camp where he had committed the robbery.  The valley opened into a wide, almost boundless stretch of comparatively level land, covered here and there with forests so dense, that, once concealed in their recesses, it would be exceedingly difficult if not impossible, for white men to trace him, especially men who were so little acquainted with woodcraft as the diggers.  Besides this, the region was undulating in form, here and there, so that from the tops of many of the eminences, he could see over the whole land, and observe the approach of enemies without being himself seen.  Feeling, therefore, comparatively safe, he paused in his mad flight, and went down on hands and knees to take a long drink at a bubbling spring. Rising, refreshed, with a deep sigh, he slowly mounted to the top of a knoll which was bathed at the time in the first beams of the rising sun.  From the spot he obtained a view of intermingled forest, prairie, lake, and river, so resplendent that even _his_ mind was for a moment diverted from its gloomy introspections, and a glance of admiration shot from his eyes and chased the wrinkles from his brow; but the frown quickly returned, and the glorious landscape was forgotten as the thought of his dreadful condition returned with overwhelming power.  Up to that day Tom Brixton, with all his faults, had kept within the circle of the world's laws.  He had been well trained in boyhood, and, with the approval of his mother, had left England for the Oregon goldfields in company with a steady, well-principled friend, who had been a playmate in early childhood and at school.  The two friends had experienced during three years the varying fortune of a digger's life; sometimes working for long periods successfully, and gradually increasing their \"pile;\" at other times toiling day after day for nothing and living on their capital, but on the whole, making what men called a good thing of it until Tom took to gambling, which, almost as a matter of course, led to drinking.  The process of demoralisation had continued until, as we have seen, the boundary line was at last overstepped, and he had become a thief and an outlaw.  At that period and in those diggings Judge Lynch--in other words, off-hand and speedy \"justice\" by the community of miners--was the order of the day, and, as stealing had become exasperatingly common, the penalty appointed was death, the judges being, in most cases, the prompt executioners.  Tom Brixton knew well what his fate would be if captured, and this unquestionably filled him with anxiety, but it was not this thought that caused him, as he reclined on the sunny knoll, to spurn the bag of gold with his foot.  \"Trash!\" he exclaimed, bitterly, repeating the kick.  But the love of gold had taken deep root in the fallen youth's heart. After a brief rest he arose, slung the \"trash\" over his shoulder, and, descending the knoll, quickly disappeared in the glades of the forests.    CHAPTER TWO.  While Brixton was hurrying with a guilty conscience deeper and deeper into the dark woods which covered the spur of the mountains in the neighbourhood of Pine Tree Diggings, glancing back nervously from time to time as if he expected the pursuers to be close at his heels, an enemy was advancing to meet him in front, of whom he little dreamed.  A brown bear, either enjoying his morning walk or on the look-out for breakfast, suddenly met him face to face, and stood up on its hind legs as if to have a good look at him.  Tom "]]]
