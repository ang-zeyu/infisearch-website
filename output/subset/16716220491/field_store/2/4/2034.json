Mr. Exel, tapping his boot with the head of his inverted cane, was staring fixedly at the doctor.  “Here you are, Leroux,” said Cumberly; “drink this up, and let us arrange our facts in decent order before we--”  “Phone for the police?” concluded Exel, his gaze upon the last speaker.  Leroux drank the brandy at a gulp and put down the glass upon a little persian coffee table with a hand which he had somehow contrived to steady.  “You are keen on the official forms, Exel?” he said, with a wry smile. “Please accept my apology for my recent--er--outburst, but picture this thing happening in your place!”  “I cannot,” declared Exel, bluntly.  “You lack imagination,” said Cumberly. “Take a whisky and soda, and help me to search the flat.”  “Search the flat!”  The physician raised a forefinger, forensically.  “Since you, Exel, if not actually in the building, must certainly have been within sight of the street entrance at the moment of the crime, and since Leroux and I descended the stair and met you on the landing, it is reasonable to suppose that the assassin can only be in one place: HERE!”  “HERE!” cried Exel and Leroux, together.  “Did you see anyone leave the lower hall as you entered?”  “No one; emphatically, there was no one there!”  “Then I am right.”  “Good God!” whispered Exel, glancing about him, with a new, and keen apprehensiveness.  “Take your drink,” concluded Cumberly, “and join me in my search.”  “Thanks,” replied Exel, nervously proffering a cigar-case; “but I won't drink.”  “As you wish,” said the doctor, who thus, in his masterful way, acted the host; “and I won't smoke. But do you light up.”  “Later,” muttered Exel; “later. Let us search, first.”  Leroux stood up; Cumberly forced him back.  “Stay where you are, Leroux; it is elementary strategy to operate from a fixed base. This study shall be the base. Ready, Exel?”  Exel nodded, and the search commenced. Leroux sat rigidly upon the settee, his hands resting upon his knees, watching and listening. Save for the merry ticking of the table-clock, and the movements of the searchers from room to room, nothing disturbed the silence. From the table, and that which lay near to it, he kept his gaze obstinately averted.  Five or six minutes passed in this fashion, Leroux expecting each to bring a sudden outcry. He was disappointed. The searchers returned, Exel noticeably holding himself aloof and Cumberly very stern.  Exel, a cigar between his teeth, walked to the writing-table, carefully circling around the dreadful obstacle which lay in his path, to help himself to a match. As he stooped to do so, he perceived that in the closed right hand of the dead woman was a torn scrap of paper.  “Leroux! Cumberly!” he exclaimed; “come here!”  He pointed with the match as Cumberly hurriedly crossed to his side. Leroux, inert, remained where he sat, but watched with haggard eyes. Dr. Cumberly bent down and sought to detach the paper from the grip of the poor cold fingers, without tearing it. Finally he contrived to release the fragment, and, perceiving it to bear some written words, he spread it out beneath the lamp, on the table, and eagerly scanned it, lowering his massive gray head close to the writing.  He inhaled, sibilantly.  “Do you see, Exel?” he jerked--for Exel was bending over his shoulder.  “I do--but I don't understand.”  “What is it?” came hollowly from Leroux.  “It is the bottom part of an unfinished note,” said Cumberly, slowly. “It is written shakily in a woman's hand, and it reads:--'Your wife'”...  Leroux sprang to his feet and crossed the room in three strides.  “Wife!” he muttered. His voice seemed to be choked in his throat; “my wife! It says something about my wife?”  “It says,” resumed the doctor, quietly, “'your wife.' Then there's a piece torn out, and the two words 'Mr. King.' No stop follows, and the line is evidently incomplete.”  “My wife!” mumbled Leroux, staring unseeingly at the fragment of paper. “MY WIFE! MR. KING! Oh! God! I shall go mad!”  “Sit down!” snapped Dr. Cumberly, turning to him; “damn it, Leroux, you are worse than a woman!”  In a manner almost childlike, the novelist obeyed the will of the stronger man, throwing himself into an armchair, and burying his face in his hands.  “My wife!” he kept muttering--“my wife!”...  Exel and the doctor stood staring at one another; when suddenly, from outside the flat, came a metallic clattering, followed by a little suppressed cry. Helen Cumberly, in daintiest deshabille, appeared in the lobby, carrying, in one hand, a chafing-dish, and, in the other, the lid. As she advanced toward the study, from whence she had heard her father's voice:--  “Why, Mr. Leroux!” she cried, “I shall CERTAINLY report you to Mira, now! You have not even touched the omelette!”  “Good God! Cumberly! stop her!” muttered Exel, uneasily. “The door was not latched!”...  But it was too late. Even as the physician turned to intercept his daughter, she crossed the threshold of the study. She stopped short at perceiving Exel; then, with a woman's unerring intuition, divined a tragedy, and, in the instant of divination, sought for, and found, the hub of the tragic wheel.  One swift glance she cast at the fur-clad form, prostrate.  The chafing-dish fell from her hand, and the omelette rolled, a grotesque mass, upon the carpet. She swayed, dizzily, raising one hand to her brow, but had recovered herself even as Leroux sprang forward to support her.  “All right, Leroux!” cried Cumberly; “I will take her upstairs again. Wait for me, Exel.”  Exel nodded, lighted his cigar, and sat down in a chair, remote from the writing-table.  “Mira--my wife!” muttered Leroux, standing, looking after Dr. Cumberly and his daughter as they crossed the lobby. “She will report to--my wife.”...  In the outer doorway, Helen Cumberly looked back over her shoulder, and her glance met that of Leroux. Hers was a healing glance and a strengthening glance; it braced him up as nothing else could have done. He turned to Exel.  “For Heaven's sake, Exel!” he said, evenly, “give me your advice--give me your help; I am going to 'phone for the police.”  Exel looked up with an odd expression.  “I am entirely at your service, Leroux,” he said. “I can quite understand how this ghastly affair has shaken you up.”  “It was so sudden,” said the other, plaintively. “It is incredible that so much emotion can be crowded into so short a period of a man's life.”...  Big Ben chimed the quarter after midnight. Leroux, eyes averted, walked to the writing-table, and took up the telephone.     III  INSPECTOR DUNBAR TAKES CHARGE   Detective-Inspector Dunbar was admitted by Dr. Cumberly. He was a man of notable height, large-boned, and built gauntly and squarely. His clothes fitted him ill, and through them one seemed to perceive the massive scaffolding of his frame. He had gray hair retiring above a high brow, but worn long and untidily at the back; a wire-like straight-cut mustache, also streaked with gray, which served to accentuate the grimness of his mouth and slightly undershot jaw. A massive head, with tawny, leonine eyes; indeed, altogether a leonine face, and a frame indicative of tremendous nervous energy.  In the entrance lobby he stood for a moment.  “My name is Cumberly,” said the doctor, glancing at the card which the Scotland Yard man had proffered. “I occupy the flat above.”  “Glad to know you, Dr. Cumberly,” replied the detective in a light and not unpleasant voice--and the fierce eyes momentarily grew kindly.  “This--” continued Cumberly, drawing Dunbar forward into the study, “is my friend, Leroux--Henry Leroux, whose name you will know?”  “I have not that pleasure,” replied Dunbar.  “Well,” added Cumberly, “he is a famous novelist, and his flat, unfortunately, has been made the scene of a crime. This is Detective-Inspector Dunbar, who has come to solve our difficulties, Leroux.” He turned to where Exel stood upon the hearth-rug--toying with his monocle. “Mr. John Exel, M. P.”  “Glad to know you, gentlemen,” said Dunbar.  Leroux rose from the armchair in which he had been sitting and stared, drearily, at the newcomer. Exel screwed the monocle into his right eye, and likewise surveyed the detective. Cumberly, taking a tumbler from the bureau, said:--  “A scotch-and-soda, Inspector?”  “It is a suggestion,” said Dunbar, “that, coming from a medical man, appeals.”  Whilst the doctor poured out the whisky and squirted the soda into the glass, Inspector Dunbar, standing squarely in the middle of the room, fixed his eyes upon the still form lying in the shadow of the writing-table.  “You will have been called in, doctor,” he said, taking the proffered tumbler, “at the time of the crime?”  “Exactly!” replied Cumberly. “Mr. Leroux ran up to my flat and summoned me to see the woman.”  “What time would that be?”  “Big Ben had just struck the final stroke of twelve when I came out on to the landing.”  “Mr. Leroux would be waiting there for you?”  “He stood in my entrance-lobby whilst I slipped on my dressing-gown, and we came down together.”  “I was entering from the street,” interrupted Exel, “as they were descending from above”...  “You can enter from the street, sir, in a moment,” said Dunbar, holding up his hand. “One witness at a time, if you please.”  Exel shrugged his shoulders and turned slightly, leaning his elbow upon the mantelpiece and flicking off the ash from his cigar.  “I take it you were in bed?” questioned Dunbar, turning again to the doctor.  “I had been in bed about a quarter of an hour when I was aroused by the ringing of the door-bell. This ringing struck me as so urgent that I ran out in my pajamas, and found there Mr. Leroux, in a very disturbed state--”  “What did he say? Give his own words as nearly as you remember them.”  Leroux, who had been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20288"],["title","Edward the Second (#1)"],["body"," France. _Gav._ Saving your reverence, you must pardon me. _K. Edw._ Throw off his golden mitre, rend his stole,    And in the channel christen him anew. _Kent._ Ay, brother, lay not violent hands on him!    For he'll complain unto the see of Rome. _Gav._ Let him complain unto the see of hell:    I'll be reveng'd on him for my exile. _K. Edw._ No, spare his life, but seize upon his goods:    Be thou lord bishop, and receive his rents,    And make him serve thee as thy chaplain:    I give him thee; here, use him as thou wilt. _Gav._ He shall to prison, and there die in bolts. _K. Edw._ Ay, to the Tower, the Fleet, or where thou wilt. _Bish. of Cov._ For this offence be thou accurs'd of God! _K. Edw._ Who's there?  Convey this priest to the Tower. _Bish. of Cov._ True, true. _K. Edw._ But, in the meantime, Gaveston, away,    And take possession of his house and goods.    Come, follow me, and thou shalt have my guard    To see it done, and bring thee safe again. _Gav._ What should a priest do with so fair a house?    A prison may beseem his holiness.                           [_Exeunt._   _Enter, on one side, the elder_ MORTIMER, _and the younger_    MORTIMER; _on the other,_ WARWICK, _and_ LANCASTER.  _War._ 'Tis true, the bishop is in the Tower,    And goods and body given to Gaveston. _Lan._ What, will they tyrannise upon the church?    Ah, wicked King! accursed Gaveston!    This ground, which is corrupted with their steps,    Shall be their timeless sepulchre or mine. _Y. Mor._ Well, let that peevish Frenchman guard him sure;    Unless his breast be sword-proof, he shall die. _E. Mor._ How now! why droops the Earl of Lancaster? _Y. Mor._ Wherefore is Guy of Warwick discontent? _Lan._ That villain Gaveston is made an earl. _E. Mor._ An earl! _War._ Ay, and besides Lord-chamberlain of the realm,    And Secretary too, and Lord of Man. _E. Mor._ We may not nor we will not suffer this. _Y. Mor._ Why post we not from hence to levy men? _Lan._ \"My Lord of Cornwall\" now at every word;    And happy is the man whom he vouchsafes,    For vailing of his bonnet, one good look.    Thus, arm in arm, the king and he doth march:    Nay, more, the guard upon his lordship waits,    And all the court begins to flatter him. _War._ Thus leaning on the shoulder of the king,    He nods, and scorns, and smiles at those that pass. _E. Mor._ Doth no man take exceptions at the slave? _Lan._ All stomach him, but none dare speak a word. _Y. Mor._ Ah, that bewrays their baseness, Lancaster!    Were all the earls and barons of my mind,    We'd hale him from the bosom of the king,    And at the court-gate hang the peasant up,    Who, swoln with venom of ambitious pride,    Will be the ruin of the realm and us. _War._ Here comes my Lord of Canterbury's grace. _Lan._ His countenance bewrays he is displeas'd.       _Enter the_ ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, _and an_                      Attendant.  _Archb. of Cant._ First, were his sacred garments rent and torn;    Then laid they violent hands upon him; next,    Himself imprison'd, and his goods asseiz'd:    This certify the Pope: away, take horse.            [_Exit Attendant._ _Lan._ My lord, will you take arms against the king? _Archb. of Cant._ What need I?  God himself is up in arms    When violence is offer'd to the church. _Y. Mor._ Then will you join with us, that be his peers,    To banish or behead that Gaveston? _Archb. of Cant._ What else, my lords? for it concerns me near;    The bishoprick of Coventry is his.                     _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA.  _Y. Mor._ Madam, whither walks your majesty so fast? _Q. Isab._ Unto the forest, gentle Mortimer,    To live in grief and baleful discontent;    For now my lord the king regards me not,    But dotes upon the love of Gaveston:    He claps his cheeks, and hangs about his neck,    Smiles in his face, and whispers in his ears;    And, when I come, he frowns, as who should say,    \"Go whither thou wilt, seeing I have Gaveston.\" _E. Mor._ Is it not strange that he is thus bewitch'd? _Y. Mor._ Madam, return unto the court again:    That sly inveigling Frenchman we'll exile,    Or lose our lives; and yet, ere that day come,    The king shall lose his crown; for we have power,    And courage too, to be reveng'd at full. _Archb. of Cant._ But yet lift not your swords against the king. _Lan._ No; but we will lift Gaveston from hence. _War._ And war must be the means, or he'll stay still. _Q. Isab._ Then let him stay; for, rather than my lord    Shall be oppress'd with civil mutinies,    I will endure a melancholy life,    And let him frolic with his minion. _Archb. of Cant._ My lords, to ease all this, but hear me speak:    We and the rest, that are his counsellors,    Will meet, and with a general consent    Confirm his banishment with our hands and seals. _Lan._ What we confirm the king will frustrate. _Y. Mor._ Then may we lawfully revolt from him. _War._ But say, my lord, where shall this meeting be? _Archb. of Cant._ At the New Temple. _Y. Mor._ Content. _Archb. of Cant._ And, in the meantime, I'll entreat you all    To cross to Lambeth, and there stay with me. _Lan._ Come, then, let's away. _Y. Mor._ Madam, farewell. _Q. Isab._ Farewell, sweet Mortimer, and, for my sake,    Forbear to levy arms against the king. _Y. Mor._ Ay, if words will serve; if not, I must.             [_Exeunt._                 _Enter_ GAVESTON _and_ KENT.  _Gav._ Edmund, the mighty prince of Lancaster,    That hath more earldoms than an ass can bear,    And both the Mortimers, two goodly men,    With Guy of Warwick, that redoubted knight,    Are gone towards Lambeth: there let them remain.                 [_Exeunt._  _Enter_ LANCASTER, WARWICK, PEMBROKE, _the elder_     MORTIMER, _the younger_ MORTIMER, _the_ ARCHBISHOP     OF CANTERBURY, _and_ Attendants.  _Lan._ Here is the form of Gaveston's exile;    May it please your lordship to subscribe your name. _Archb. of Cant._ Give me the paper.                             [_He subscribes, as the others do after him._ _Lan._ Quick, quick, my lord; I long to write my name. _War._ But I long more to see him banish'd hence. _Y. Mor._ The name of Mortimer shall fright the king,    Unless he be declin'd from that base peasant.      _Enter_ KING EDWARD, GAVESTON, _and_ KENT.  _K. Edw._ What, are you mov'd that Gaveston sits here?    It is our pleasure; we will have it so. _Lan._ Your grace doth well to place him by your side,    For nowhere else the new earl is so safe. _E. Mor._ What man of noble birth can brook this sight?    _Quam male conveniunt!--_    See, what a scornful look the peasant casts! _Pem._ Can kingly lions fawn on creeping ants? _War._ Ignoble vassal, that, like Phaeton,    Aspir'st unto the guidance of the sun! _Y. Mor._ Their downfall is at hand, their forces down:    We will not thus be fac'd and over-peer'd. _K. Edw._ Lay hands on that traitor Mortimer! _E. Mor._ Lay hands on that traitor Gaveston! _Kent._ Is this the duty that you owe your king? _War._ We know our duties; let him know his peers. _K. Edw._ Whither will you bear him? stay, or ye shall die. _E. Mor._ We are no traitors; therefore threaten not. _Gav._ No, threaten not, my lord, but pay them home.    Were I a king-- _Y. Mor._ Thou, villain! wherefore talk'st thou of a king,    That hardly art a gentleman by birth? _K. Edw._ Were he a peasant, being my minion,    I'll make the proudest of you stoop to him. _Lan._ My lord--you may not thus disparage us.--    Away, I say, with hateful Gaveston! _E. Mor._ And with the Earl of Kent that favours him.                                    [_Attendants remove Gaveston and Kent._ _K. Edw._ Nay, then, lay violent hands upon your king:    Here, Mortimer, sit thou in Edward's throne;    Warwick and Lancaster, wear you my crown.    Was ever king thus over-rul'd as I? _Lan._ Learn, then, to rule us better, and the realm. _Y. Mor._ What we have done, our heart-blood shall maintain. _War._ Think you that we can brook this upstart['s] pride? _K. Edw._ Anger and wrathful fury stops my speech. _Archb. of Cant._ Why are you not mov'd? be patient, my lord,    And see what we your counsellors have done. _Y. Mor._ My lords, now let us all be resolute,    And either have our wills, or lose our lives. _K. Edw._ Meet you for this, proud over-daring peers!    Ere my sweet Gaveston shall part from me,    This isle shall fleet upon the ocean,    And wander to the unfrequented Inde. _Archb. of Cant._ You know that I am legate to the Pope:    On your allegiance to the see of Rome,    Subscribe, as we have done, to his exile. _Y. Mor._ Curse him, if he refuse; and then may we    Depose him, and elect another king. _K. Edw._ Ay, there it goes! but yet I will not yield:    Curse me, depose me, do the worst you can. _Lan._ Then linger not, my lord, but do it straight. _Archb. of Cant._ Remember how the bishop was abus'd:    Either banish him that was the cause thereof,    Or I will presently discharge these lords    Of duty and allegiance due to thee. _K. Edw._ It boots me not to threat; I must speak fair:    The legate of the Pope will be obey'd.--                     [_Aside._    My lord, you shall be Chancellor of the realm;    Thou, Lancaster, High-Admiral of our fleet;    Young Mortimer and his uncle shall be earls;    And you, Lord Warwick, President of the North;    And thou of Wales.  If this content you not,    Make several kingdoms of this monarchy,    And share it equally amongst you all,    So I may have some nook or corner left,    To frolic with my dearest Gaveston. _Archb. of Cant._ Nothing shall alter us; we are resolv'd. _Lan._ Come, come, subscribe. _Y. Mor._ Why should you love him whom the world hates so? _K. Edw._ Because he loves me more than all the world.    Ah, none but rude and savage-minded men    Would seek the ruin of my Gaveston!    You that be noble-born should pity him. _War._ You that are princely-born should shake him off:    For shame, subscribe, and let the clown depart. _E. Mor._ Urge him, my"]]]
