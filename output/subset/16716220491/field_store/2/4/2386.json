We merely tell thus much to account for her position and her partial refinement--both of which conditions she shared with Susan.  \"Now then,\" said the latter, \"I must go, granny.  Stickle and Screw are not the men to overlook faults.  If I'm a single minute late I shall have to pay for it.\"  \"And quite right, Susy, quite right.  Why should Stickle and Screw lose a minute of their people's work?  Their people would be angry enough if they were to be paid a penny short of their wages!  Besides, the firm employs over two hundred hands, and if every one of these was to be late a minute there would be two hundred minutes gone--nigh four hours, isn't it?  You should be able to count that right off, Susy, havin' been so long at the Board-school.\"  \"I don't dispute it, granny,\" said the girl with a light laugh, as she stood in front of a triangular bit of looking-glass tying on her poor but neatly made hat.  \"And I am usually three or four minutes before my time, but Stickle and Screw are hard on us in other ways, so different from Samson and Son, where Lily Hewat goes.  Now, I'm off.  I'll be sure to be back by half-past nine or soon after.\"  As the girl spoke, footsteps were heard ascending the creaky wooden stair.  Another moment and Tommy Splint entering with a theatrical air, announced--  \"A wisitor!\"  He was closely followed by Sam Blake, who no sooner beheld Susy than he seemed to become paralysed, for he stood gazing at her as if in eager but helpless amazement.  Susy was a good deal surprised at this, but feeling that if she were to wait for the clearing up of the mystery she would infallibly be late in reaching the shop of the exacting Stickle and Screw, she swept lightly past the seaman with a short laugh, and ran down-stairs.  Without a word of explanation Sam sprang after her, but, although smart enough on the shrouds and ladders of shipboard, he failed to accommodate himself to the stairs of rookeries, and went down, as he afterwards expressed it, \"by the run,\" coming to an anchor at the bottom in a sitting posture.  Of course the lithe and active Susy escaped him, and also escaped being too late by only half a minute.  \"Never mind, she'll be back again between nine and ten o'clock, unless they keep her late,\" said old Liz, after Sam had explained who he was, and found that Susy was indeed his daughter, and chimney-pot Liz the nurse who had tended his wife to her dying day, and afterwards adopted his child.  \"I never was took aback so in all my life,\" said the seaman, sitting down beside the old woman, and drawing a sigh so long that it might have been likened to a moderate breeze.  \"She's the born image o' what her dear mother was when I first met her.  _My_ Susy!  Well, it's not every poor seaman as comes off a long voyage an' finds that he's fallen heir to a property like _that_!\"  \"You may well be proud of her,\" said old Liz, \"and you'll be prouder yet when you come to know her.\"  \"I know it, and I'm proud to shake your hand, mother, an' thankee kindly for takin' such care o' my helpless lassie.  You say she'll be home about ten?\"  \"Yes, if she's not kep' late.  She always comes home about that time. Meanwhile you'll have something to eat.  Tommy, boy, fetch out the loaf and the cheese and the teapot.  You know where to find 'em.  Tommy's an orphan, Cap'n Blake, that I've lately taken in hand.  He's a good boy is Tommy, but rather wild.\"  \"Wot can you expect of a horphing?\" said the boy with a grin, for he had overheard the latter remark, though it was intended only for the visitor's ear.  \"But I say, granny, there ain't no cheese here, 'cept a bit o' rind that even a mouse would scorn to look at.\"  \"Never mind, bring out the loaf, Tommy.\"  \"An' there ain't no use,\" continued the boy, \"o' bringin' out the teapot, 'cause there ain't a grain o' tea nowheres.\"  \"Oh!  I forgot,\" returned old Liz, slightly confused; \"I've just run out o' tea, Cap'n Blake, an' I haven't a copper at _present_ to buy any, but--\"  \"Never mind that old girl; and I ain't quite captain yet, though trendin' in that direction.  You come out along wi' me, Tommy.  I'll soon putt these matters to rights.\"  Old Liz could not have remonstrated even if she had wished to do so, for her impulsive visitor was gone in a moment followed by his extremely willing little friend.  They returned in quarter of an hour.  \"There you are,\" said the seaman, taking the articles one by one from a basket carried by Tommy; \"a big loaf, pound o' butter, ditto tea, three pound o' sugar, six eggs, hunk o' cheese, paper o' salt--forgot the pepper; never mind.\"  \"You've bin an' forgot the sassengers too--but here they are,\" said Tommy, plucking the delectable viands from the bottom of the basket with a look of glee, and laying them on the table.  Chimney-pot Liz did not look surprised; she only smiled and nodded her head approvingly, for she felt that Sam Blake understood the right thing to do and did it.  Soon the celebrated teapot was going the round, full swing, while the air was redolent of fried sausage and cheese mingled with the perfume of roses and mignonette, for this meal, you must know, was eaten in the garden in the afternoon sunshine, while the cooking--done in the attic which opened on the garden--was accomplished by Sam assisted by Tommy.  \"Well, you _air_ a trump,\" said the latter to the former as he sat down, greasy and glowing, beside the seaman at the small table where old Liz presided like a humble duchess.  We need hardly say that the conversation was animated, and that it bore largely on the life-history of the absent Susy.  \"You're quite sure that she'll be here by ten?\" asked the excited father for the fiftieth time that afternoon.  \"Yes, I'm sure of it--unless she's kep' late,\" answered Liz.  But Susy did _not_ return at the usual hour, so her impatient father was forced to conclude that she _had_ been \"kep' late\"--too late.  In his anxiety he resolved to sally forth under the guidance of Tommy Splint to inquire for the missing Susy at the well-known establishment of Stickle and Screw.  Let us anticipate him in that quest.  At the usual hour that night the employes of Stickle and Screw left work and took their several ways home ward.  Susy had the company of her friend Lily Hewat as far as Chancery Lane.  Beyond that point she had to go alone.  Being summer-time, the days were long, and Susy was one of those strong-hearted and strong-nerved creatures who have a tendency to fear nothing.  She had just passed over London Bridge and turned into a labyrinth of small streets on the Surrey side of the river, when a drunken man met her in a darkish and deserted alley through which she had to pass.  The man seized her by the arm.  Susy tried to free herself.  In the struggle that ensued she fell with a loud shriek, and struck her head on the kerb-stone so violently that she was rendered insensible.  Seeing this, the man proceeded to take from her the poor trinkets she had about her, and would have succeeded in robbing her but for the sudden appearance on the scene of a lowland Scot clad in a homespun suit of shepherd's plaid--a strapping ruddy youth of powerful frame, fresh from the braes of Yarrow.    CHAPTER THREE.  A VISITOR FROM THE NORTH.  How that Lowland Scot came to the rescue just in the nick of time is soon told.  \"Mither,\" said he one evening, striding into his father's dwelling--a simple cottage on a moor--and sitting down in front of a bright old woman in a black dress, whose head was adorned with that frilled and baggy affair which is called in Scotland a mutch, \"I'm gawin' to Lun'on.\"  \"Hoots! havers, David.\"  \"It's no' havers, mither.  Times are guid.  We've saved a pickle siller. Faither can spare me for a wee while--sae I'm aff to Lun'on the morn's mornin'.\"  \"An' what for?\" demanded Mrs Laidlaw, letting her hands and the sock on which they were engaged drop on her lap, as she looked inquiringly into the grave countenance of her handsome son.  \"To seek a wife, maybe,\" replied the youth, relaxing into that very slight smile with which grave and stern-featured men sometimes betray the presence of latent fun.  Mrs Laidlaw resumed her sock and needle with no further remark than \"Hoots! ye're haverin',\" for she knew that her son was only jesting in regard to the wife.  Indeed nothing was further from that son's intention or thoughts at the time than marriage, so, allowing the ripple to pass from his naturally grave and earnest countenance, he continued--  \"Ye see, mither, I'm twunty-three noo, an' I _wad_ like to see something o' the warld afore I grow aulder an' settle doon to my wark.  As I said, faither can spare me a while, so I'll jist tak' my fit in my haund an' awa' to see the Great Bawbylon.\"  \"Ye speak o' gaun to see the warld, laddie, as if 'ee was a gentleman.\"  \"Div 'ee think, mother, that the warld was made only for _gentlemen_ to travel in?\" demanded the youth, with the gentlest touch of scorn in his tone.  To this question the good woman made no reply; indeed her stalwart son evidently expected none, for he rose a few minutes later and proceeded to pack up his slender wardrobe in a shoulder-bag of huge size, which, however, was well suited to his own proportions.  Next day David Laidlaw took the road which so many men have taken before him--for good or ill.  But, unlike most of his predecessors, he was borne towards it on the wings of steam, and found himself in Great Babylon early the following morning, with his mother's last caution ringing strangely in his ears.  \"David,\" she had said, \"I ken ye was only jokin', but dinna ye be ower sure o' yersel'.  Although thae English lassies are a kine o' waux dolls, they have a sort o' way wi' them that might be dangerous to lads like you.\"  \"H'm!\"  David had replied, in that short tone of self-sufficiency which"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21738"],["title","Hunted and Harried (#1)"],["body","it be the right kind of speech, and--\"  He stopped, for at that moment two young girls suddenly appeared at a bend of the road in front of them.  They gazed for a moment at the soldiers in evident surprise, and then turned as if to fly, but Glendinning put spurs to his horse and was beside them in a moment. Leaping to the ground, he seized the girls roughly by their arms as they clung together in alarm.  One of the two was a dark-eyed little child. The other was fair, unusually pretty, and apparently about fifteen or sixteen years of age.  The trooper proceeded to question them sharply.  \"Be gentle,\" said Will Wallace sternly, as he rode up, and, also dismounting, stood beside them.  \"No fear of their running away now.\"  The swarthy trooper pretended not to hear, but nevertheless relaxed his grip and merely rested his hand upon the fair girl's shoulder as he said to the other--  \"Now, my wee doo, ye canna be far frae hame, I's be sworn.  What's yer name?\"  \"Aggie Wilson,\" answered the child at once.  \"And yours?\"  \"Jean Black,\" replied the blonde timidly.  \"Oho! an' yer faither's name is Andrew, an' his hoose is close by, I'll be bound, so ye'll be guid eneuch to show us the way till't.  But first, my bonny lass, ye'll gie me a--\"  Slipping his arm round the waist of the terrified blonde, the trooper rudely attempted to terminate his sentence in a practical manner; but before his lips could touch her face he received a blow from his comrade that sent him staggering against a neighbouring tree.  Blazing with astonishment and wrath, Glendinning drew his sword and sprang at his companion, who, already full of indignation at the memory of what he had been so recently compelled to witness, could ill brook the indignity thus offered to the defenceless girl.  His weapon flashed from its sheath on the instant, and for a few moments the two men cut and thrust at each other with savage ferocity.  Wallace, however, was too young and unused to mortal strife to contemplate with indifference the possibility of shedding the blood of a comrade.  Quickly recovering himself, he stood entirely on the defensive, which his vigorous activity enabled him easily to do.  Burning under the insult he had received, Glendinning felt no such compunctions.  He pushed his adversary fiercely, and made a lunge at last which not only passed the sword through the left sleeve of the youth's coat, but slightly wounded his arm.  Roused to uncontrollable anger by this, Will Wallace fetched his opponent a blow so powerful that it beat down his guard, rang like a hammer on his iron headpiece, and fairly hurled the man into the ditch at the roadside.  Somewhat alarmed at this sudden result, the youth hastily pulled him out, and, kneeling beside him, anxiously examined his head.  Much to his relief he found that there was no wound at all, and that the man was only stunned.  After the examination, Wallace observed that the girls had taken advantage of the fray to make their escape.  Indignation and anger having by that time evaporated, and his judgment having become cool, Wallace began gradually to appreciate his true position, and to feel exceedingly uncomfortable.  He had recklessly expressed opinions and confessed to actions which would of themselves ensure his being disgraced and cast into prison, if not worse; he had almost killed one of his own comrades, and had helped two girls to escape who could probably have assisted in the accomplishment of the duty on which they had been despatched.  His case, he suddenly perceived, was hopeless, and he felt that he was a lost man.  Will Wallace was quick of thought and prompt in action.  Carefully disposing the limbs of his fallen comrade, and resting his head comfortably on a grassy bank, he cast a hurried glance around him.  On his left hand and behind him lay the rich belt of woodland that marked the courses of the rivers Cluden and Cairn.  In front stretched the moors and hills of the ancient district of Galloway, at that time given over to the tender mercies of Graham of Claverhouse.  Beside him stood the two patient troop-horses, gazing quietly at the prostrate man, as if in mild surprise at his unusual stillness.  Beyond this he could not see with the physical eye; but with the mental orb he saw a dark vista of ruined character, blighted hopes, and dismal prospects.  The vision sufficed to fix his decision.  Quietly, like a warrior's wraith, he sheathed his sword and betook himself to the covert of the peat-morass and the heather hill.  He was not the first good man and true who had sought the same shelter.  At the time of which we write Scotland had for many years been in a woeful plight--with tyranny draining her life-blood, cupidity grasping her wealth, hypocrisy and bigotry misconstruing her motives and falsifying her character.  Charles the Second filled the throne. Unprincipled men, alike in Church and State, made use of their position and power to gain their own ends and enslave the people.  The King, determined to root out Presbytery from Scotland, as less subservient to his despotic aims, and forcibly to impose Prelacy on her as a stepping-stone to Popery, had no difficulty in finding ecclesiastical and courtly bravos to carry out his designs; and for a long series of dismal years persecution stalked red-handed through the land.  Happily for the well-being of future generations, our covenanting forefathers stood their ground with Christian heroism, for both civil and religious liberty were involved in the struggle.  Their so-called fanaticism consisted in a refusal to give up the worship of God after the manner dictated by conscience and practised by their forefathers; in declining to attend the ministry of the ignorant, and too often vicious, curates forced upon them; and in refusing to take the oath of allegiance just referred to by Will Wallace.  Conventicles, as they were called--or the gathering together of Christians in houses and barns, or on the hillsides, to worship God-- were illegally pronounced illegal by the King and Council; and disobedience to the tyrannous law was punished with imprisonment, torture, confiscation of property, and death.  To enforce these penalties the greater part of Scotland--especially the south and west-- was overrun by troops, and treated as if it were a conquered country. The people--holding that in some matters it is incumbent to \"obey God rather than man,\" and that they were bound \"not to forsake the assembling of themselves together\"--resolved to set the intolerable law at defiance, and went armed to the hill-meetings.  They took up arms at first, however, chiefly, if not solely, to protect themselves from a licentious soldiery, who went about devastating the land, not scrupling to rob and insult helpless women and children, and to shed innocent blood.  Our Scottish forefathers, believing--in common with the lower animals and lowest savages--that it was a duty to defend their females and little ones, naturally availed themselves of the best means of doing so.  About this time a meeting, or conventicle, of considerable importance was appointed to be held among the secluded hills in the neighbourhood of Irongray; and Andrew Black, the farmer, was chosen to select the particular spot, and make the preliminary arrangements.  Now this man Black is not easily described, for his was a curiously compound character.  To a heart saturated with the milk of human kindness was united a will more inflexible, if possible, than that of a Mexican mule; a frame of Herculean mould, and a spirit in which profound gravity and reverence waged incessant warfare with a keen appreciation of the ludicrous.  Peacefully inclined in disposition, with a tendency to believe well of all men, and somewhat free and easy in the formation of his opinions, he was very unwilling to resist authority; but the love of truth and justice was stronger within him than the love of peace.  In company with his shepherd, Quentin Dick--a man of nearly his own size and build--Andrew Black proceeded to a secluded hollow in Skeoch Hill to gather and place in order the masses of rock which were to form the seats of the communicants at the contemplated religious gathering--which seats remain to this day in the position they occupied at that time, and are familiarly known in the district as \"the Communion stones of Irongray.\"  CHAPTER TWO.  THE \"FANATIC\" AND THE \"SPY.\"  The night was dark and threatening when Andrew Black and his shepherd left their cottage, and quickly but quietly made for the neighbouring hill.  The weather was well suited for deeds of secrecy, for gusts of wind, with an occasional spattering of rain, swept along the hill-face, and driving clouds obscured the moon, which was then in its first quarter.  At first the two men were obliged to walk with care, for the light was barely sufficient to enable them to distinguish the sheep-track which they followed, and the few words they found it necessary to speak were uttered in subdued tones.  Jean Black and her cousin Aggie Wilson had reported their _rencontre_ with the two dragoons, and Quentin Dick had himself seen the main body of the troops from behind a heather bush on his way back to the farm, therefore caution was advisable.  But as they climbed Skeoch Hill, and the moon shed a few feeble rays on their path, they began to converse more freely.  For a few minutes their intercourse related chiefly to sheep and the work of the farm, for both Andrew and his man were of that sedate, imperturbable nature which is not easily thrown off its balance by excitement or danger.  Then their thoughts turned to the business in hand.  \"Nae fear o' the sodgers comin' here on a nicht like this,\" remarked Andrew, as a squall nearly swept the blue bonnet off his head.  \"Maybe no,\" growled Quentin Dick sternly, \"but I've heard frae Tam Chanter that servants o' that Papist Earl o' Nithsdale, an' o' the scoondrel Sir Robert Dalziel, hae been seen pokin'"]]]
