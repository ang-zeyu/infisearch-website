Why, did it not take courage to defy me, to tell me to my face that I was a scoundrel, a blackguard? And it took more courage to defy custom, convention, propriety, to come here and tell you the same things. No, Miss Glen, Sempland only lacks opportunity. Fortune has not been kind to him. In that settlement after the war there will be a struggle I'll warrant you.\"  \"See! He can speak nobly of you,\" cried Fanny Glen, turning reproachfully to Sempland.  \"I never said he was not a gentleman, could not be a gentleman, that is, when he was--when he wished to be one, that is, as well as a brave man. He has good blood in him, but that doesn't alter the case. He isn't a fit match for you, or for any woman. I am not speaking for myself. I know my case is hopeless--\"  \"Gad!\" laughed Lacy, \"you have tried then and lost? It's my turn then. Miss Glen, you have heard the worst of me this afternoon. I have been a drunkard, a scoundrel. I have fallen low, very low. But sometimes I am a gentleman. Perhaps in your presence I might always be. I can't tell. I'm not sure. Will you take me for your lover, and in good time your husband, under such circumstances? Faith, I'm afraid it'll not be for better, but for worse.\"  Sempland said nothing. He would not interfere now. Fanny Glen must answer for herself. He clenched his teeth and strove to control himself. In spite of his efforts, however, the blood flamed into his dark face. Fanny Glen grew very white, her blue eyes shone like stars in the pallor of her face under her fair hair. She hesitated. She looked from one to the other. She could not speak. She was too conscious of that stern iron figure. Yet she would have given worlds to say \"yes\" to Lacy's plea.  \"Choose, Miss Glen,\" said Lacy, at last. It was hard for him to wait for anything. \"You stand between us, you see. I warn you if you do not take me, you will take Sempland. Look at him,--\" he smiled satirically,--\"he always gets what he wants. He is the very incarnation of bulldog tenacity and resolution. If I don't get you, he certainly will.\"  \"How dare you comment upon me?\" cried Sempland.  \"Patience, my good sir,\" said the other, coolly. \"You commented upon me in my absence. I comment upon you in your presence. The advantage is mine. As I said, Miss Glen, it is a choice between us. Do not choose me, if you should be so fatuously inclined, because I happen to have had some chances for distinction, for I assure you, on my honor, all there is left of it, that if Sempland gets half a chance he'll do better than I. Choose because you love him--or me.\"  The girl stared from one to the other in indignant bewilderment. Lacy was an ideal lover. Sempland looked like a stern master, and she hated a master. She made a half step toward the handsomer and weaker man, and a half turn toward the homelier and stronger. In her heart of hearts she found in that moment which she preferred. And, as love is wayward, in the knowledge came a surprise for her--and it brought shame. Lacy was handsome and gallant and distinguished, in spite of all, but Sempland was strong--a man indeed.  \"Oh!\" she cried, looking at him, \"if you only had done something great or--\"  \"What!\" he cried, his face alight.  But she turned instantly away. In her words Lacy, more subtile and more used to women, read her preference and his rejection. But he smiled bravely and kindly at her in spite of his knowledge.  \"Major Lacy,\" she said, giving him her hand, \"I esteem you, I honor you, I respect you. I do not believe what this--what has been said about you. But I do not love you.\" She drew away from him. \"You were mistaken. There is no choice between you, for I love neither of you. I do not love anybody. I hate you both!\" she flashed out inconsistently. \"Now go! I don't want to see either of you again.\"  She buried her face in her hands and burst into tears.  \"I will do something to deserve your praise,\" said Sempland, in his deep voice, turning away.  \"Miss Glen,\" said Lacy, most graciously,--Fanny Glen's presence seemed to call all that was good in him to the surface,--\"no one has respected me, or trusted me, or honored me as you have, for years. Sempland cannot rob me of that, even though he should win you. Good-by, and, if it be not grotesque from me, may God bless you!\"     CHAPTER III  A STRIFE IN MAGNANIMITY   \"Well, Sempland,\" said Lacy, with astonishing courtesy and forbearance under all the circumstances, as he overtook the other man plodding along the shaded street, \"you don't seem to be in much greater favor with the young lady than I.\"  \"Lacy,\" returned the other, \"you did well this evening. You are not good enough for Miss Glen, I still think. Nobody is, for that matter, but you less than others. My opinion of you, you know--\"  \"Faith, all the world may know it apparently!\"  \"That's unjust. I have never mentioned it to any one, and should not have expressed it to Miss Glen had it not been to save her. But you showed the stuff that was in you, that used to be in you, to-night. It was fine. I thank you for having said--\" he paused.  \"What?\" asked Lacy.  \"Why, that about my not having had a chance, you know.\"  \"Oh, that was a trifle.\"  \"I know. But not many men would have said it at the time.\"  \"I tell you what it is, Sempland. I like you, I always have liked you. When I--er--dropped out of the old set, you know, before the war, I didn't mind giving up any one so much as you. And I was sorry for you to-night. You hadn't had a chance. God knows I love the girl, but I am not the man for her. I would break her heart in a month. You don't know women, I take it, but I think she will be yours in the end. I give her to you.\"  \"She is not yours to give.\"  \"No, I know she isn't. But I withdraw in your favor.\"  \"I don't want that sort of a fair field. Harry,\" went on the other man, unconsciously dropping into the familiar form of boyhood, which caused Lacy's face to flush with pleasure, \"I am sure she loves you. I thought it was I, at first, but since this afternoon I have changed my mind. Why can't you be different? You are not a fit man to marry any honest woman now, and when I thought of your record I doubted that you ever would be. I was sure you would not, but--see here, old man! Throw the past aside! A fellow that's got it in him to do what you have done for the South--why can't you control yourself? Turn over a new leaf. I love her, too. She's more to me than life itself, but her happiness is more than mine. If she loves you, and wants you, make yourself worthy of her. By heaven, I'll help you, if it kills me! You thought I was harsh to-day. I swear to you if you succeed nobody will acknowledge it quicker than I!\"  \"Will you tell her so?\"  \"I will!\"  \"Rhett,\" said the other man, stretching out his hand, \"the woman I love has this day honored me, but by heaven I believe you have honored me more. I did think it was a low-down trick for you to go to Miss Glen, but I know why you did it, and you were right. It's too late. I can never be anything different. My father and grandfather both died in drunken sprees--it's in my blood. I can't help it. I've had a chance or two to do something a little out of the ordinary in this war, thank God for it, but I suppose the reason I was able to carry it through was that I cared little whether I lived or died. No, that isn't true. I'd rather die than live, but I would like to go out of existence doing something fine and noble. I--I--might get a better chance on the other side, then, you know. Life is nothing to me, and there are no possibilities in it.\"  He spoke bitterly. It was rare that any one saw him in that mood.  \"I tell you I'm cursed! I wouldn't take that girl if she did accept me. I only wanted to trouble you. Well, no, not exactly that, either. I love her, God knows, but the devil's got me in his grip and--\"  \"I can't understand it,\" said Sempland, vaguely.  \"Of course you can't. You're so strong and so self-contained--such as you never can understand such as I. But to be a drunkard, and a gambler, and a--\"  He stopped and threw up his hands, and then dropped them heavily by his side.  \"It's in my blood, I tell you! It is not all my fault. Yet there is good in me, enough good to make me go mad if I stop to think of it. I want some way to get out of this life with honor. I leave the field for you.\"  \"She doesn't love--\"  \"You're a fool, Sempland--forgive me--about that woman. I know women better than you. Not so much the good as the bad, but in some things women are alike, a woman is a woman whatever she does. That girl loves the ground you walk on.\"  \"Nonsense! It's you.\"  \"Pshaw! She is fascinated by what she's heard on one hand, and she shuts her eyes to what she has heard on the other. The war is young. We'll be beaten, of course, but not without some hard, desperate fighting. Your chance will come, and when it does--\"  \"I will master it or die!\"  \"Of course, but don't die. Master it. Leave dying to me. I've sought ways for it, and now one is at hand.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"I am going to take out the _David_ to-night.\"  \"What!\"  \"Yes. It's a dead secret, but I can tell you. There are three blockade-runners ready to sail. The _Wabash_ lies off the Main Ship Channel. Of course, all the others are blockaded, too, but General Beauregard thinks that if we can torpedo the flagship the others will hurry to her assistance and the blockade-runners can get out through the Swash Channel. Our magazines are running low, and we must have arms, powder, everything. There are two or three shiploads at Nassau. This is an attempt to get to them. If we can blow up Admiral Vernon's flagship, perhaps we can raise the blockade. At any rate it's the only chance for the blockade-runners to get out.\"  \"Did the general order you to do this?\"  \"Certainly not. I suggested it to him. They don't order any one to the _David_, you know.\"  \"I should say not,\" returned Sempland. \"She's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21687"],["title","The Youngest Girl in the Fifth: A School Story (#1)"],["body","she wished both to break the news to her old classmates and to fetch some necessary books from her former desk before the bell rang.  The other members of the Fifth lingered behind in perturbed consultation. They considered they had a just and most pressing grievance. In all the annals of the school such a case had never occurred before. It had been hitherto an inviolable though unwritten law that no one under the age of fifteen should be admitted to the Fifth Form, a law which they had believed as strict as that of the Medes and Persians, and here was the headmistress actually breaking it, and in favour of a girl only fourteen and a quarter. If Miss Roscoe had not brought her herself into the room they would not have credited it.  \"It's abominably unfair!\" broke out Rachel Hunter, a tall girl of sixteen. \"Because my birthday comes on October 4th I had to stop a whole year longer in the Lower School. Yes--though my mother came and begged Miss Roscoe to let me go up!\"  \"Well, you couldn't get moved up on your work, at any rate, Rachel!\" chirped Joan Masters. \"It would have had to be favour in your case.\"  \"That's not the point! It's a different question. If Miss Roscoe makes a rule she ought to stick to it. Why, half the girls in the Form might have come up sooner if it hadn't been for the age limit.\"  \"You're right, and I can't see why Gwen Gascoyne should be so specially noticed.\"  \"She's supposed to be clever, I believe.\"  \"She doesn't look it! Besides, what do we care whether she's clever or not? It's the injustice of the thing that makes me angry. A kid like her amongst us seniors! The idea!\"  \"Miss Roscoe may send Gwen up,\" declared Louise Mawson, \"but she can't make us accept her as one of ourselves. I vote we send her to Coventry.\"  \"We will! She's nothing but a Lower School girl, and we won't tolerate her being imposed upon us!\"  \"She'll be so conceited at finding herself a Senior!\"  \"We'll soon take her pride down, then!\"  \"She'll meet with a few snubs here, I'll undertake to say!\"  \"If Miss Roscoe is going to bring up all the rank and file like that there's no credit in being in the Fifth!\"  \"It's a positive insult to the rest of us!\"  So decided Gwen's new classmates, jealous for the prestige of their Form, and annoyed at the indignity which they considered they were made to suffer in admitting a younger girl among their number. To Gwen or her feelings they gave not a thought. If she met with an unpleasant experience all the better; it might deter Miss Roscoe from repeating the experiment. That the remove was not Gwen's fault, and therefore that it was scarcely fair to visit the headmistress's act upon her innocent head, did not enter into their calculations. Where they consider their rights are concerned schoolgirls rarely hold mercy before justice.  Meantime Gwen, who had gone to break the important tidings to the Upper Fourth, did not find her old friends as responsive as she had expected. They received her communication with marked coldness.  \"Why should you have been moved up, Gwen Gascoyne, and not Daisy, or Aileen, or I?\" enquired Alma Richardson, with a distinctly aggrieved note in her voice.  \"Miss Roscoe always favoured Gwen!\" said Eve Dawkins enviously.  \"You're six months younger than Viola Sutton, so it seems absurd you should be put above her.\"  \"You'll be so grand now, I suppose you won't care to know us!\"  \"It's not fair to the rest of the Form!\"  \"Oh dear! I'm between two fires,\" thought Gwen, as she hastily cleared her possessions from her old desk. \"The Fifth don't want me, and the Fourth are horribly jealous. You're going to have a bad time, Gwen Gascoyne, I'm afraid! I see breakers ahead! Never mind. It's a great honour to be moved up, and Father'll be glad and sympathize, if nobody else does. The work will be pretty stiff: I expect it'll be all I can do to manage it. But I mean to have a jolly good try. I'll show those girls I can do something, though I am the youngest! Oh, I say! I've only just remembered that Winnie'll be the under-mistress. I'll have to call her 'Miss Gascoyne' whenever I speak to her. How perfectly idiotic! I'm sure I shall laugh. I wonder if Miss Roscoe's told her yet? What a surprise it would be for her to come into the room and find me there!\"  \"I wish you'd be quick, Gwen Gascoyne,\" said Eve Dawkins; \"I'm to have your desk as soon as you've moved out. It's a nicer seat than mine.\"  \"Right-o!\" answered Gwen, piling her books on top of her big atlas. \"You're welcome to it, I'm sure. I think you might all have seemed a trifle more sorry to lose me! I don't see any display of pocket handkerchiefs. No, I can't say I'm shedding tears myself unless they're crocodile ones. Please to recollect in future, my dears, when you speak to me, that you're addressing a member of the Upper School! You're only little Junior girls! Ta-ta!\" and with a mock curtsy, in process of which she nearly dropped her pile of books, Gwen retired laughing from the Fourth Form to take her place and try her luck among the Seniors.     CHAPTER II  The Gascoyne Girls   At fourteen and a quarter Gwen Gascoyne was at a particularly difficult and hobbledehoy stage of her development. She was tall for her age, and rather awkward in her manners, apt at present to be slapdash and independent, and decidedly lacking in \"that repose which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere\". Gwen could never keep still for five seconds, her restless hands were always fidgeting or her feet shuffling, or she was twisting in her chair, or shaking back a loose untidy lock that had escaped from her ribbon. Gwen often did her hair without the aid of a looking-glass, but when she happened to use one the reflection of her own face gave her little cause for satisfaction.  \"I'm plain, and there's no blinking the fact,\" she confessed to herself. \"Winnie says I'm variable, and I can look nice when I smile, but I'm afraid no one would trouble to look at me twice. If only I were Lesbia now, or even Beatrice! People talk about the flower of a family--well, I expect I'm the weed, as far as appearances go! I haven't had my fair share in the way of good looks.\"  It certainly seemed hard that Nature, which had been kind to the Gascoynes in that respect, should have dowered her brothers and sisters so liberally, and have left poor Gwen out in the cold. Her bright little face had an attraction all of its own, of which she was quite unconscious, but she was entirely accustomed to stand aside while strangers noticed and admired her younger sister Lesbia. To do Gwen justice, though she might lament her own plainness, it never struck her to be jealous of the others. She was intensely proud of the family reputation for beauty, and even if she could not include herself among \"the handsome Gascoynes\", it certainly gave her a reflected satisfaction to be aware of the epithet.  \"I'm like Daddy,\" she said sometimes; \"nobody ever calls him handsome, but he's a dear all the same--the dearest dear in the world!\"  The Reverend Maurice Gascoyne was curate-in-charge of the church of St. John the Baptist in the little fishing village of Skelwick Bay, on the coast of the North Sea. He was rich in the possession of seven children, but there his luck ended, for his income, as is often the case, was in exactly inverse ratio to the size of his family.  \"The fact is, we're as poor as church mice,\" said Beatrice one day. \"Indeed, I think we're poorer, because the mouse we saw in church last Sunday, that scared Winnie so, was very fat and sleek and prosperous looking, and didn't bear out the old saying at all.\"  For the last four years, ever since pretty Mrs. Maurice Gascoyne had gently laid down the burden that had grown too heavy for her, Beatrice had been the clever, energetic \"mother\" of the establishment. She managed the house, and the children, and the one maid, and the parish, and her father, all included, with a business-like capacity far in advance of her twenty years. She was a fine-looking girl, tall and straight-limbed and ample, with blue eyes and dark brows, and a clear creamy skin, and that air of noble strength about her which the Greek sculptors gave to their statues of Artemis. Though she did her best both for home and hamlet, Beatrice often chafed against the narrowness of her limits. It was a sore point that she had been obliged to leave school at sixteen, and devote herself to domestic pursuits, and while not regretting the sacrifice, she often lamented the two years lopped off her education.  \"I'm so behind, I never could go in even for the matric. now,\" she sighed sometimes. \"If I could have realized my ambition, I'd have studied for a lady doctor.\"  Since the profession of medicine was utterly and entirely out of the question, Beatrice often consoled herself by planning that when the children were old enough to do without her, she would go as a nurse to a big London hospital, and rise to be a ward sister, or perhaps--who knew?--even a matron. In the meanwhile her talent for administration had to confine itself within the bounds of the Parsonage and the parish, where it was apt to become just a trifle dictatorial and overbearing. It is so hard for a young, keen, ardent nature, anxious to set the world right, to remember that infinite patience must go hand in hand with our best endeavours, and that the time of sowing is an utterly different season from that of harvest.  Between Gwen and Beatrice there was often friction. The former resented being ordered about by a sister of only twenty, and would prove rebellious on occasion. Really, the two girls' dispositions were much alike, but Beatrice's early position of responsibility had turned into strength of character what was at present mere manifestation of independence and often bravado in Gwen.  Winnie, a sweet-tempered, pretty girl of eighteen, had just been made an under-mistress at \"Rodenhurst\", Miss Roscoe's school, which she and Gwen and Lesbia attended daily. Teaching was not at all"]]]
