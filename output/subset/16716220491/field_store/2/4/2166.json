Or so it seemed to me; and the start of surprise and consternation which escaped the stranger when he first saw me confirmed me in the impression.  But a moment later I doubted; so natural was the posture into which the man fell, and so stupid the look of inquiry which he turned first on me and then on Maignan.  As he stood before me, shifting his feet and staring about him in vacant wonder, I began to think that I had made a mistake; and, clearly, either I had done so or this young man was possessed of talents and a power of controlling his features beyond the ordinary.  He unslung his tools, and saluting me abjectly waited in silence.  After a moment's thought, I asked him peremptorily what was his errand with the Duchess de Beaufort.  \"To show her a watch, your excellency,\" he stammered, his mouth open, his eyes staring.  I could detect no flaw in his acting.  \"What are you, then?\"  I said.  \"A clockmaker, my lord.\"  \"Has Madame sent for you?\"  \"No, my lord,\" he stuttered, trembling.  \"Do you want to sell her the watch?\"  He muttered that he did; and that he meant no harm by it.  \"Show it to me, then,\" I said curtly.  He grew red at that, and seemed for an instant not to understand. But on my repeating the order he thrust his hand into his breast, and producing a parcel began to unfasten it.  This he did so slowly that I was soon for thinking that there was no watch in it; but in the end he found one and handed it to me.  \"You did not make this,\" I said, opening it.  \"No, my lord,\" he answered; \"it is German, and old.\"  I saw that it was of excellent workmanship, and I was about to hand it back to him, almost persuaded that I had made a mistake, when in a second my doubts were solved.  Engraved on the thick end of the egg, and partly erased by wear, was a dog's head, which I knew to be the crest of the Perrots.  \"So,\" I said, preparing to return it to him, \"you are a clockmaker?\"  \"Yes, your excellency,\" he muttered.  And I thought that I caught the sound of a sigh of relief.  I gave the watch to Maignan to hand to him.  \"Very well,\" I said. \"I have need of one.  The clock in the next room--a gift from his Majesty--is out of order, and at a standstill.  You can go and attend to it; and see that you do so skilfully.  And do you, Maignan,\" I continued with meaning, \"go with him.  When he has made the clock go, let him go; and not before, or you answer for it.  You understand, sirrah?\"  Maignan saluted obsequiously, and in a moment hurried young Perrot from the room; leaving me to congratulate myself on the strange and fortuitous circumstance that had thrown him in my way, and enabled me to guard against a RENCONTRE that might have had the most embarassing consequences.  It required no great sagacity to foresee the next move; and I was not surprised when, about an hour later, I heard a clatter of hoofs outside, and a voice inquiring hurriedly for the Marquis de Rosny.  One of my people announced M. de Perrot, and I bade them admit him.  In a twinkling he came up, pale with heat, and covered with dust, his eyes almost starting from his head and his cheeks trembling with agitation. Almost before the door was shut, he cried out that we were undone.  I was willing to divert myself with him for a time, and I pretended to know nothing.  \"What?\"  I said, rising.  \"Has the King met with an accident?\"  \"Worse!  worse!\"  he cried, waving his hat with a gesture of despair. \"My son--you saw my son yesterday?\"  \"Yes,\" I said.  \"He overheard us!\"  \"Not us,\" I said drily.  \"You.  But what then, M. de Perrot?  You are master in your own house.\"  \"But he is not in my house,\" he wailed.  \"He has gone!  Fled! Decamped! I had words with him this morning, you understand.\"  \"About your niece?\"  M. de Perrot's face took a delicate shade of red, and he nodded; he could not speak.  He seemed for an instant in danger of some kind of fit.  Then he found his voice again.  \"The fool prated of love!  Of love!\"  he said with such a look--like that of a dying fowl--that I could have laughed aloud.  \"And when I bade him remember his duty he threatened me.  He, that unnatural boy, threatened to betray me, to ruin me, to go to Madame de Beaufort and tell her all--all, you understand.  And I doing so much, and making such sacrifices for him!\"  \"Yes,\" I said, \"I see that.  And what did you do?\"  \"I broke my cane on his back,\" M. de Perrot answered with unction, \"and locked him in his room.  But what is the use?  The boy has no natural feelings!\"  \"He got out through the window?\"  Perrot nodded; and being at leisure, now that he had explained his woes, to feel their full depth, shed actual tears of rage and terror; now moaning that Madame would never forgive him, and that if he escaped the Bastille he would lose all his employments and be the laughing-stock of the Court; and now striving to show that his peril was mine, and that it was to my interest to help him.  I allowed him to go on in this strain for some time, and then, having sufficiently diverted myself with his forebodings, I bade him in an altered voice to take courage.  \"For I think I know,\" I said, \"where your son is.\"  \"At Madame's?\"  he groaned.  \"No; here,\" I said.  \"MON DIEU!  Where?\"  he cried.  And he sprang up, startled out of his lamentations.  \"Here; in my lodging,\" I answered.  \"My son is here?\"  he said.  \"In the next room,\" I replied, smiling indulgently at his astonishment, which was only less amusing than his terror.  \"I have but to touch this bell, and Maignan will bring him to you.\"  Full of wonder and admiration, he implored me to ring and have him brought immediately; since until he had set eyes on him he could not feel safe.  Accordingly I rang my hand-bell, and Maignan opened the door.  \"The clockmaker,\" I said nodding.  He looked at me stupidly.  \"The clock-maker, your excellency?\"  \"Yes; bring him in,\" I said.  \"But--he has gone!\"  he exclaimed.  \"Gone?\" I cried, scarcely able to believe my ears.  \"Gone, sirrah!  and I told you to detain him!\"  \"Until he had mended the clock, my lord,\" Maignan stammered, quite out of countenance.  \"But he set it going half-an-hour ago; and I let him go, according to your order.\"  It is in the face of such CONTRETEMPS as these that the low-bred man betrays himself.  Yet such was my chagrin on this occasion, and so sudden the shock, that it was all I could do to maintain my SANGFROID, and, dismissing Maignan with a look, be content to punish M. de Perrot with a sneer.  \"I did not know that your son was a tradesman,\" I said. He wrung his hands.  \"He has low tastes,\" he cried.  \"He always had. He has amused himself that way, And now by this time he is with Madame de Beaufort and we are undone!\"  \"Not we,\" I answered curtly; \"speak for yourself, M. de Perrot.\"  But though, having no mind to appear in his eyes dependent on Madame's favour or caprice, I thus checked his familiarity, I am free to confess that my calmness was partly assumed; and that, though I knew my position to be unassailable--based as it was on solid services rendered to the King, my master, and on the familiar affection with which he honoured me through so many years--I could not view the prospect of a fresh collision with Madame without some misgiving.  Having gained the mastery in the two quarrels we had had, I was the less inclined to excite her to fresh intrigues; and as unwilling to give the King reason to think that we could not live at peace.  Accordingly, after a moment's consideration, I told Perrot that, rather than he should suffer, I would go to Madame de Beaufort myself, and give such explanations as would place another complexion on the matter.  He overwhelmed me with thanks, and, besides, to show his gratitude--for he was still on thorns, picturing her wrath and resentment he insisted on accompanying me to the Cloitre de St. Germain, where Madame had her apartment.  By the way, he asked me what I should say to her.  \"Whatever will get you out of the scrape,\" I answered curtly.  \"Then anything!\"  he cried with fervour.  \"Anything, my dear friend. Oh, that unnatural boy!\"  \"I suppose that the girl is as big a fool?\"  I said.  \"Bigger!  bigger!\"  he answered.  \"I don't know where she learned such things!\"  \"She prated of love, too, then?\"  \"To be sure,\" he groaned, \"and without a sou of DOT!\"  \"Well, well,\" I said, \"here we are.  I will do what I can.\"  Fortunately the King was not there, and Madame would receive me. I thought, indeed, that her doors flew open with suspicious speed, and that way was made for me more easily than usual; and I soon found that I was not wrong in the inference I drew from these facts.  For when I entered her chamber that remarkable woman, who, whatever her enemies may say, combined with her beauty a very uncommon degree of sense and discretion, met me with a low courtesy and a smile of derision.  \"So,\" she said, \"M. de Rosny, not satisfied with furnishing me with evidence, gives me proof.\"  \"How, Madame?\"  I said; though I well understood.  \"By his presence here,\" she answered.  \"An hour ago,\" she continued, \"the King was with me.  I had not then the slightest ground to expect this honour, or I am sure that his Majesty would have stayed to share it.  But I have since seen reason to expect it, and you observe that I am not unprepared.\"  She spoke with a sparkling eye, and an expression of the most lively resentment; so that, had M. de Perrot been in my place I think that he would have shed more tears.  I was myself somewhat dashed, though I knew the prudence that governed her in her most impetuous sallies; still, to avoid the risk of hearing things which we might both afterwards wish unsaid, I came to the point. \"I fear that I have timed my visit ill, Madame,\" I said.  \"You have some complaint against me.\"  \"Only that you are like the others,\" she answered with a fine contempt. \"You profess one thing and do"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20791"],["title","For Love of Country: A Story of Land and Sea in the Days of the Revolution (#1)"],["body","by this time, and really you know you look quite hungry.  We have been out so long; but I will have pity on you, and detain you no longer here.  Turn the boat around, Lieutenant Seymour, and put me on shore at once.  I will stand between no man and his dinner.\"  \"Hungry?  Yes, I am, but not for dinner,--for you, Mistress Katharine,\" he replied.  \"Oh, what a horrid appetite!  I don't feel safe in the boat with you. Are you very hungry?\"  \"Really, Miss Wilton, I am not jesting at all,\" he said with immense dignity.  \"Oh! oh!  He is in earnest.  Shall I scream?  No use; we are a mile from the house, at least.\"  \"Oh, Miss Wilton--Katharine,\" he replied desperately, \"I am devoured by my--\"  \"Lieutenant Seymour!\"  She drew herself up with great hauteur, letting the cloak drop about her waist.  \"Madam!\"  \"Only my friends call me Katharine.\"  \"And am I not, may I not be, one of your friends?\"  \"Well, yes--I suppose so; but you are so young.\"  \"I am just twenty-seven, madam, and you, I suppose, are--\"  \"Never be ungallant enough to suppose a young lady's age.  You may do those things in Philadelphia, if you like, but 't is not the custom here.  Besides, I mean too young a friend; you have not known me long enough, that is.\"  \"Long enough!  I have known you ever since Tuesday of last week.\"  \"And this is Friday,--just ten days, ten long days!\" she replied triumphantly.  \"Long days!\" he cried.  \"Very short ones, for me.\"  \"Long or short, sir, do you think you can know me in that period?  Is it possible I am so easily fathomed?\" she went on, smiling.  Now it is ill making love in a rowboat at best, and when one is in earnest and the other jests it is well-nigh impossible; so to these remarks Lieutenant Seymour made no further answer, save viciously to ply the oars and drive the boat rapidly toward the landing.  Miss Katharine gazed vacantly about the familiar river upon whose banks she had been born and bred, and, finally noticing the sun had gone down, closing the short day, she once more drew her cloak closely about her and resumed the neglected conversation.  \"Won't you please stop looking at me in that manner, and won't you please row harder, or is your strength all centred in your gaze?\"  \"I am rowing as fast as I can, Miss Wilton, especially with this--\"  \"Oh, I forgot your wounded shoulder!  Does it hurt?  Does it pain you? I am so sorry.  Let me row.\"  \"Thank you, no.  I think I can manage it myself.  The only pain I have is when you are unkind to me.\"  At that moment, to his great annoyance, his oar stuck fast in the oar-lock, and he straightway did that very unsailorly thing known as catching a crab.  Katharine Wilton laughed.  There was music in her voice, but this time it did not awaken a responsive chord in the young man.  Extricating his oar violently, he silently resumed his work.  \"Do you like crabs, Mr. Seymour?\" she said with apparent irrelevance.  \"I don't like catching them, Miss Wilton,\" he admitted ruefully.  \"Oh, I mean eating them!  We were talking about your appetite, were we not?  Well, Dinah devils them deliciously.  I 'll have some done for you,\" she continued with suspicious innocence.  Seymour groaned in spirit at her perversity, and for the first time in his life felt an intense sympathy with devilled crabs; but he continued his labor in silence and with great dignity.  \"What am I to infer from your silence on this important subject, sir? The subject of edibles, which everybody says is of the first importance--to men--does not appear to interest you at all!\"  He made no further reply.  The young girl gazed at his pale face at first in much amusement; but the laughter gradually died away, and finally her glance fell to the water by her side.  A few strong strokes, strong enough, in spite of a wounded shoulder, to indicate wrathful purpose and sudden determination to the astute maiden, and the little boat swung in beside the wharf. Throwing the oars inboard with easy skill, Seymour sat motionless while the boat glided swiftly down toward the landing-steps, and the silence was broken only by the soft, delicious lip, lip, lip of the water, which seemed to cling to and caress the bow of the skiff until it finally came to rest.  The man waited until the girl looked up at him. She saw in his resolute mien the outward and visible sign of his inward determination, and she realized that the game so bravely and piquantly played since she met him was lost.  They had nearly arrived at the foregone conclusion.  \"Well, Mr. Seymour,\" she said finally, \"we are here at last; for what are you waiting?\"  \"Waiting for you.\"  \"For me?\"  \"Ay, only for you.\"  \"I--I--do not understand you.\"  \"You understand nothing apparently, but I will explain.\"  He stepped out on the landing-stage, and after taking a turn or two with the painter to secure the boat, he turned toward his captive with a ceremonious bow.  \"Permit me to help you ashore.\"  \"Oh, thank you, Lieutenant Seymour; if I only could, in this little boat, I would courtesy in return for that effort,\" she answered with tremulous and transparent bravery.  But when the little palm met his own brown one, it seemed to steal away some of the bitterness of the moment.  After he had assisted her upon the shore and up the steps into the boathouse, he held her hand tight within his own, and with that promptitude which characterized him he made the plunge.  \"Oh, Miss Wilton--Katharine--it is true I have known you only a little while, but all that time--ever since I saw you, in fact, and even before, when your father showed me your picture--I have loved you. Nay, hear me out.\"  There was an unusual sternness in his voice.  My lord appeared to be in the imperative mood,--something to which she had not been accustomed.  He meant to be heard, and with beating heart perforce she listened.  \"Quiet that spirit of mockery but a moment, and attend my words, I pray you.  No, I will not release you until I have spoken.  These are troublous times.  I may leave at any moment--must leave when my orders come, and I expect them every day, and before I go I must tell you this.\"  Her downcast eyes could still see him blush and then pale a little under the sunburn and windburn of his face, as he went on speaking.  \"I have no one; never had I a sister, I can remember no mother; believe me, I entreat you, when I tell you that to no woman have I ever said what I have just said to you.  We sailors think and speak and act quickly, it is a part of our profession; but if I should wait for years I should think no differently and act in no other way.  I love you! Oh, Katharine, I love you as my soul.\"  There was a note of passion in his voice which thrilled her heart with ecstasy; the others had not made love this way.  \"You seem to me like that star I have often watched in the long hours of the night, which has shown me the way on many a trackless sea.  I know I am as far beneath you as I am beneath that star.  But though the distance is great, my love can bridge it, if you will let me try. Katharine--won't you answer me, Katharine?  Is there nothing you can say to me?  'Dost thou love me, Kate?'\" he quoted softly, taking her other hand.  How very fair, but how very far away she looked!  The color came and went in her cheek.  He could see her breast rise and fall under the mad beating of a heart which had escaped her control, though hitherto she had found no difficulty in keeping it well in hand. There was a novelty, a difference, in the situation this time, a new and unexpected element in the event.  She hesitated.  Why was it no merry quip came to the lips usually so ready with repartee?  Alas, she must answer.  \"I--I--oh, Mr. Seymour,\" she said softly and slowly, with a downcast face she fain would hide, he fain would see.  \"I--yes,\" she murmured with great reluctance; \"that is--I think so.  You see, when you defended father, in the fight with the brig, you know, and got that bullet in your shoulder you earned a title to my gratitude, my--\"  \"I don't want a title to your gratitude,\" he interrupted.  \"I want your love, I want you to love me for myself alone.\"  \"And do you think you are worthy that I should?\" she replied with a shadow of her former archness.  He gravely bent his head and kissed her hand.  \"No, Katharine, I do not.  I can lay no claim to your hand, if it is to be a reward of merit, but I love you so--that is the substance of my hope.\"  \"Oh, Mr. Seymour, Mr. Seymour, you overvalue me.  If you do that with all your possessions, you will be--  Oh, what have I said?\" she cried in sudden alarm, as he took her in his arms.  \"My possessions!  Katharine, may I then count you so?  Oh, Kate, my lovely Kate--\"  It was over, and over as she would have it; why struggle any longer?  The landing was a lonely little spot under the summer-house, at the end of the wharf; no one could see what happened. This time it was not her hand he kissed.  The day died away in twilight, but for those two a new day began.  The army might starve and die, battles be lost or won, dynasties rise and fall, kingdoms wax and wane, causes tremble in the balances,--what of that?  They looked at each other and forgot the world.     CHAPTER II  _The Country First of All_  \"Oh, what is the hour, Mr.--John?  Shall I call you Seymour?  That is your second name, is it not?  But what would people say?  I--  No, no, not again; we really must go in.  See!  I am not dressed for the evening yet.  Supper will be ready.  Now, Lieutenant Seymour, you must let me go.  What will my father think of us?  Come, then.  Your hand, sir.\"  The hill from the boat-landing was steep, but Mistress Kate had often run like a young deer to the top of it without appreciating its difficulties as she did that evening.  On every stepping-stone, each steep ascent, she lingered, in spite of her expressed desire for haste, and each time his strong and steady arm was at her service.  She tasted to the full and for the first time the sweets of loving"]]]
