I offered my arm to the old woman, who thanked me and took it.  \"What!\" whispered Peterkin, \"you don't mean me to take this great ugly gorilla in tow?\"  \"Of course,\" replied I, laughing, as I led the way.  Immediately I entered into conversation with my companion, and I heard \"the gorilla\" attempt to do so with Peterkin; but from the few sharp cross replies that reached my ear, I became aware that he was unsuccessful.  In the course of a few minutes, however, he appeared to have overcome his companion's ill-humour, for I overheard their voices growing louder and more animated as they walked behind me.  Suddenly I heard a shout, and turning hastily round, observed Peterkin struggling in the arms of the gorilla!  Amazed beyond measure at the sight, and firmly persuaded that a cowardly assault had been made upon my friend, I seized the old woman's umbrella, as the only available weapon, and flew to the rescue.  \"Jack, my boy! can it be possible?\" gasped Peterkin.  \"I believe it is,\" replied Jack, laughing.--\"Ralph, my dear old fellow, how are you?\"  I stood petrified.  I believed that I was in a dream.  I know not what occurred during the next five minutes.  All I could remember with anything like distinctness was a succession of violent screams from the little old woman, who fled shouting thieves and murder at the full pitch of her voice.  We never saw that old woman again, but I made a point of returning her umbrella to the \"white house.\"  Gradually we became collected and sane.  \"Why, Jack, how did you find us out?\" cried Peterkin, as we all hurried on to my lodgings, totally forgetful of the little old woman, whom, as I have said, we never saw again, but who, I sincerely trust, arrived at the white house in safety.  \"Find you out!  I knew you the moment I set eyes on you.  Ralph puzzled me for a second, he has grown so much stouter; but I should know your nose, Peterkin, at a mile off.\"  \"Well, Jack, I did not know you,\" retorted Peterkin, \"but I'm safe never again to forget you.  Such a great hairy Cossack as you have become! Why, what do you mean by it?\"  \"I couldn't help it, please,\" pleaded Jack; \"I grew in spite of myself; but I think I've stopped now.\"  \"It's time,\" remarked Peterkin.  Jack had indeed grown to a size that men seldom attain to without losing in grace infinitely more than they gain in bulk, but he had retained all the elegance of form and sturdy vigour of action that had characterised him as a boy.  He was fully six feet two inches in his stockings, but so perfect were his proportions that his great height did not become apparent until you came close up to him.  Full half of his handsome manly face was hid by a bushy black beard and moustache, and his curly hair had been allowed to grow luxuriantly, so that his whole aspect was more like to the descriptions we have of one of the old Scandinavian Vikings than a gentleman of the present time.  In whatever company he chanced to be he towered high above every one else, and I am satisfied that, had he walked down Whitechapel, the Horse Guards would have appeared small beside him, for he possessed not only great length of limb but immense breadth of chest and shoulders.  During our walk to my lodgings Peterkin hurriedly stated his \"plan and proposal,\" which caused Jack to laugh very much at first, but in a few minutes he became grave, and said slowly, \"That will just suit--it will do exactly.\"  \"What will do exactly?  Do be more explicit, man,\" said Peterkin, with some impatience.  \"I'll go with you, my boy.\"  \"Will you?\" cried Peterkin, seizing his hand and shaking it violently; \"I knew you would.  I said it; didn't I, Ralph?  And now we shall be sure of a gorilla, if there's one in Africa, for I'll use you as a stalking-horse.\"  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Jack.  \"Yes; I'll put a bear-skin or some sort of fur on your shoulders, and tie a lady's boa to you for a tail, and send you into the woods.  The gorillas will be sure to mistake you for a relative until you get quite close; then you'll take one pace to the left with the left foot (as the volunteers say), I'll take one to the front with the right--at fifty yards, ready--present--bang, and down goes the huge puggy with a bullet right between its two eyes!  There.  And Ralph's agreed to go too.\"  \"O Peterkin, I've done nothing of the sort.  You _proposed_ it.\"  \"Well, and isn't that the same thing?  I wonder, Ralph that you can give way to such mean-spirited prevarication.  What?  `It's not prevarication!'  Don't say that now; you know it is.  Ah! you may laugh, my boy, but you have promised to go with me and Jack to Africa, and go you shall.\"  And so, reader, it was ultimately settled, and in the course of two weeks more we three were on our way to the land of the slave, the black savage, and the gorilla.    CHAPTER TWO.  LIFE IN THE WILD WOODS.  One night, about five or six weeks after our resolution to go to Africa on a hunting expedition was formed, I put to myself the question, \"Can it be possible that we are actually here, in the midst of it?\"  \"Certainly, my boy, in the very thick of it,\" answered Peterkin, in a tone of voice which made Jack laugh, while I started and exclaimed--  \"Why, Peterkin, how did you come to guess my thoughts?\"  \"Because, Ralph, you have got into a habit of thinking aloud, which may do very well as long as you have no secrets to keep but it may prove inconvenient some day, so I warn you in time.\"  Not feeling disposed at that time to enter into a bantering conversation with my volatile companion, I made no reply, but abandoned myself again to the pleasing fancies and feelings which were called up by the singular scene in the midst of which I found myself.  It seemed as if it were but yesterday when we drove about the crowded streets of London making the necessary purchases for our intended journey, and now, as I gazed around, every object that met my eye seemed strange, and wild, and foreign, and romantic.  We three were reclining round an enormous wood fire in the midst of a great forest, the trees and plants of which were quite new to me, and totally unlike those of my native land.  Rich luxuriance of vegetation was the feature that filled my mind most.  Tall palms surrounded us, throwing their broad leaves overhead and partially concealing the starlit sky.  Thick tough limbs of creeping plants and wild vines twisted and twined round everything and over everything, giving to the woods an appearance of tangled impenetrability; but the beautiful leaves of some, and the delicate tendrils of others, half concealed the sturdy limbs of the trees, and threw over the whole a certain air of wild grace, as might a semi-transparent and beautiful robe if thrown around the form of a savage.  The effect of a strong fire in the woods at night is to give to surrounding space an appearance of ebony blackness, against which dark ground the gnarled stems and branches and pendent foliage appear as if traced out in light and lovely colours, which are suffused with a rich warm tone from the blaze.  We were now in the wilds of Africa, although, as I have said, I found it difficult to believe the fact.  Jack and I wore loose brown shooting coats and pantaloons; but we had made up our minds to give up waistcoats and neckcloths, so that our scarlet flannel shirts with turned-down collars gave to us quite a picturesque and brigand-like appearance as we encircled the blaze--Peterkin smoking vigorously, for he had acquired that bad and very absurd habit at sea.  Jack smoked too, but he was not so inveterate as Peterkin.  Jack was essentially moderate in his nature.  He did nothing violently or in a hurry; but this does not imply that he was slow or lazy.  He was leisurely in disposition, and circumstances seldom required him to be otherwise.  When Peterkin or I had to lift heavy weights, we were obliged to exert our utmost strength and agitate our whole frames; but Jack was so powerful that a comparatively slight effort was all that he was usually obliged to make.  Again, when we two were in a hurry we walked quickly, but Jack's long limbs enabled him to keep up with us without effort.  Nevertheless there were times when he was called upon to act quickly and with energy.  On those occasions he was as active as Peterkin himself, but his movements were tremendous.  It was, I may almost say, awful to behold Jack when acting under powerful excitement. He was indeed a splendid fellow, and not by any means deserving of the name of gorilla, which Peterkin had bestowed on him.  But to continue my description of our costume.  We all wore homespun grey trousers of strong material.  Peterkin and Jack wore leggings in addition, so that they seemed to have on what are now termed knickerbockers.  Peterkin, however, had no coat.  He preferred a stout grey flannel shirt hanging down to his knees and belted round his waist in the form of a tunic.  Our tastes in headdress were varied.  Jack wore a pork-pie cap; Peterkin and I had wide-awakes.  My facetious little companion said that I had selected this species of hat because I was always more than half asleep!  Being peculiar in everything, Peterkin wore his wide-awake in an unusual manner--namely, turned up at the back, down at the front, and curled very much up at the sides.  We were so filled with admiration of Jack's magnificent beard and moustache, that Peterkin and I had resolved to cultivate ours while in Africa; but I must say that, as I looked at Peterkin's face, the additional hair was not at that time an improvement, and I believe that much more could not have been said for myself.  The effect on my little comrade was to cause the lower part of his otherwise good-looking face to appear extremely dirty.  \"I wonder,\" said Peterkin, after a long silence, \"if we shall reach the niggers' village in time for the hunt to-morrow.  I fear that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21737"],["title","The Garret and the Garden; Or, Low Life High Up (#1)"],["body","may be your Lizbeth and our Susy your babby!\"  \"I'm more than half inclined to think that, my boy,\" returned the sailor, growing more excited.  \"_Is_ the old woman's name Morley?\"  \"Dun know.  Never heard nobody call her nothin' but Liz.\"  \"And how about Susan?\"  \"That's the babby?\" said the boy with a grin.  \"Yes--yes,\" said Sam anxiously.  \"Well, that babby's about five fut four now, without 'er boots.  You see 'uman creeturs are apt to grow considerable in fifteen years--ain't they?\"  \"But is her name Blake?\" demanded the seaman.  \"Not as I knows of. Susy's wot we all calls 'er--so chimley-pot Liz calls 'er, an' so she calls 'erself, an' there ain't another Susy like her for five miles round.  But come up, Sam, an' I'll introduce ee--they're both over'ead.\"  So saying the lively urchin grasped his new friend by the hand and led him by a rickety staircase to the \"rookeries\" above.    CHAPTER TWO.  FLOWERS IN THE DESERT.  Beauty and ugliness form a contrast which is presented to us every day of our lives, though, perhaps, we may not be much impressed by the fact. And this contrast is presented in ever-varying aspects.  We do not, however, draw the reader's attention to one of the striking aspects of the contrast--such as is presented by the hippopotamus and the gazelle, or the pug with the \"bashed\" nose and the Italian greyhound.  It is to one of the more delicate phases that we would point--to that phase of the contrast wherein the fight between the two qualities is seen progressing towards victory, and ugliness is not only overborne but overwhelmed by beauty.  For this purpose we convey the reader to a scene of beauty that might compare favourably with any of the most romantic spots on this fair earth--on the Riviera, or among the Brazilian wilds, or, for that matter, in fairyland itself.  It is a garden--a remarkably small garden to be sure, but one that is arranged with a degree of taste and a display of fancy that betokens the gardener a genius.  Among roses and mignonette, heliotrope, clematis and wallflower, chrysanthemums, verbenas and sweet-peas are intertwined, on rustic trellis-work, the rich green leaves of the ivy and the graceful Virginia creeper in such a manner that the surroundings of the miniature garden are completely hidden from view, and nothing but the bright blue sky is visible, save where one little opening in the foliage reveals the prospect of a grand glittering river, where leviathans of the deep and small fry of the shallows, of every shape and size, disport themselves in the blaze of a summer sun.  Beauty meets the eye wherever turned, but, let the head of the observer be extended ever so little beyond the charmed circle of that garden, and nearly all around is ugliness supreme!  For this is a garden on the roof of an old house; the grand river is the Thames, alive with the shipping of its world-wide commerce, and all around lies that interminable forest of rookery chimneys, where wild ungainly forms tell of the insane and vain efforts of man to cope with smoke; where wild beasts--in the form of cats--hold their nightly revels, imitating the yells of agonised infants, filling the dreams of sleepers with ideas of internal thunder or combustion, and driving the sleepless mad!  Susy--our Susy--is the cause of this miracle of beauty in the midst of misery; this glowing gem in a setting of ugliness.  It is her modest little head that has bent over the boxes of earth, which constitute her landed property; her pretty little fingers which have trained the stems and watered the roots and cherished the flowers until the barren house-top has been made to blossom like the rose.  And love, as usual, has done it all--love to that very ugly old woman, chimney-pot Liz, who sits on the rustic chair in the midst of the garden enjoying it all.  For Liz has been a mother to that motherless bairn from her earliest years.  She has guarded, fed, and clothed her from infancy; taught her from God's Book the old, old story of redeeming love, and led her to the feet of Jesus.  It would be strange indeed if Susy did not love the ugly old woman, until at last she came to regard the wrinkles as veritable lines of beauty; the nut-cracker nose and chin as emblems of persistent goodness; the solitary wobbling tooth as a sign of unconquerable courage; and the dark eyes--well, it required no effort of imagination to change the character of the old woman's eyes, for they had always been good, kindly, expressive eyes, and were at that date as bright and lively as when she was sweet sixteen.  But chimney-pot Liz was poor--desperately poor, else she had not been there, for if heaven was around and within her, assuredly something very like pandemonium was underneath her, and it not unfrequently appeared as if the evil spirits below were surging to and fro in a fierce endeavour to burst up the whole place, and hurl the old woman with her garden into the river.  Evil spirits indeed formed the dread foundation of the old woman's abode; for, although her own court was to some extent free from the curse, this particular pile of building, of which the garden formed the apex, had a grog-shop, opening on another court, for its foundation-stone.  From that sink of iniquity, literal and unmitigated-- though not unadulterated--spirits of evil rose like horrid fumes from the pit, and maddened the human spirits overhead.  These, descending to the foundation-den, soaked themselves in the material spirit and carried it up, until the whole tenement seemed to reek and reel under its malign influence.  But, strange to say, the riot did not rise as high as the garden on the roof--only the echoes reached that little paradise.  Now it is a curious almost unaccountable fact, which no one would ever guess, that a teapot was the cause of this--at least a secondary cause-- for a teapot was the chief instrument in checking, if not turning, the tide of evil.  Yes, chimney-pot Liz held her castle in the very midst of the enemy, almost single-handed, with no visible weapon of offence or defence but a teapot!  We say visible, because Liz did indeed possess other and very powerful weapons which were not quite so obvious--such as, the Word of God in her memory, the love of God in her heart, and the Spirit of God in her soul.  To the outside world, however, the teapot was her weapon and shield.  We have read of such a weapon before, somewhere in the glorious annals of city missions, but just now we are concerned only with the teapot of our own Liz of chimney-pot notoriety.  Seated, as we have said, in a rustic chair, gazing through the foliage at the busy Thames, and plying her knitting needles briskly, while the sun seemed to lick up and clear away the fogs and smoke of the great city, chimney-pot Liz enjoyed her thoughts until a loud clatter announced that Susy had knocked over the watering-pot.  \"Oh! granny\" (thus she styled her), \"I'm _so_ sorry!  So stupid of me! Luckily there's no water in it.\"  \"Never mind, dear,\" said the old woman in a soft voice, and with a smile which for a moment exposed the waste of gums in which the solitary fang stood, \"I've got no nerves--never had any, and hope I never may have. By the way, that reminds me--Is the tea done, Susy?\"  \"Yes, not a particle left,\" replied the girl, rising from her floral labours and thereby showing that her graceful figure matched well with her pretty young face.  It was a fair face, with golden hair divided in the middle and laid smooth over her white brow, not sticking confusedly out from it like the tangled scrub on a neglected common, or the frontal locks of a Highland bull.  \"That's bad, Susy,\" remarked old Liz, pushing the fang about with her tongue for a few seconds.  \"You see, I had made up my mind to go down to-night and have a chat with Mrs Rampy, and I wouldn't like to visit her without my teapot.  The dear old woman is so fond of a cup of tea, and she don't often get it good, poor thing.  No, I shouldn't like to go without my teapot, it would disappoint her, you know--though I've no doubt she would be glad to see me even empty-handed.\"  \"I should just think she would!\" said Susy with a laugh, as she stooped to arrange some of the fastenings of her garden, \"I should just think she would.  Indeed, I doubt if that _dear_ old woman would be alive now but for you, granny.\"  The girl emphasised the \"dear\" laughingly, for Mrs Rampy was one of those middle-aged females of the destitute class whose hearts have been so steeled against their kind by suffering and drink as to render them callous to most influences.  The proverbial \"soft spot\" in Mrs Rampy's heart was not reached until an assault had been made on it by chimney-pot Liz with her teapot.  Even then it seemed as if the softness of the spot were only of the gutta-percha type.  \"Perhaps not, perhaps not my dear,\" returned old Liz, with that pleased little smile with which she was wont to recognise a philanthropic success a smile which always had the effect of subduing the tooth, and rendering the plain face almost beautiful.  Although bordering on the lowest state of destitution--and that is a remarkably low state in London!--old Liz had an air of refinement about her tones, words, and manner which was very different from that of the poor people around her.  This was not altogether, though partly, due to her Christianity.  The fact is, the old woman had \"seen better days.\" For fifty years she had been nurse in an amiable and wealthy family, the numerous children of which seemed to have been born to bloom for a few years in the rugged garden of this world, and then be transplanted to the better land.  Only the youngest son survived.  He entered the army and went to India--that deadly maelstrom which has swallowed up so much of British youth and blood and beauty!  When the old couple became bankrupt and died, the old nurse found herself alone and almost destitute in the world.  It is not our purpose to detail here the sad"]]]
