For two weeks now Winnifred Clair had sought employment even of the humblest character. At various dress-making establishments she had offered, to no purpose, the services of her needle. They had looked at it and refused it.  In vain she had offered to various editors and publishers the use of her pen. They had examined it coldly and refused it.  She had tried fruitlessly to obtain a position of trust. The various banks and trust companies to which she had applied declined her services. In vain she had advertised in the newspapers offering to take sole charge of a little girl. No one would give her one.  Her slender stock of money which she had in her purse on leaving Mr. Bonehead's office was almost consumed.  Each night the unhappy girl returned to her lodging exhausted with disappointment and fatigue.  Yet even in her adversity she was not altogether friendless.  Each evening, on her return home, a soft tap was heard at the door.  \"Miss Clair,\" said the voice of the Landlady, \"I have brought you a fried egg. Eat it. You must keep up your strength.\"  Then one morning a terrible temptation had risen before her.  \"Miss Clair,\" said the manager of an agency to which she had applied, \"I am glad to be able at last to make you a definite offer of employment. Are you prepared to go upon the stage?\"  The stage!  A flush of shame and indignation swept over the girl. Had it come to this? Little versed in the world as Winnifred was, she knew but too well the horror, the iniquity, the depth of degradation implied in the word.  \"Yes,\" continued the agent, \"I have a letter here asking me to recommend a young lady of suitable refinement to play the part of Eliza in _Uncle Tom's Cabin._ Will you accept?\"  \"Sir,\" said Winnifred proudly, \"answer me first this question fairly. If I go upon the stage, can I, as Eliza, remain as innocent, as simple as I am now?\"  \"You can not,\" said the manager.  \"Then, sir,\" said Winnifred, rising from her chair, \"let me say this. Your offer is doubtless intended to be kind. Coming from the class you do, and inspired by the ideas you are, you no doubt mean well. But let a poor girl, friendless and alone, tell you that rather than accept such a degradation she will die.\"  \"Very good,\" said the manager.  \"I go forth,\" cried Winnifred, \"to perish.\"  \"All right,\" said the manager.  The door closed behind her. Winnifred Clair, once more upon the street, sank down upon the steps of the building in a swoon.  But at this very juncture Providence, which always watches over the innocent and defenceless, was keeping its eye direct upon Winnifred.  At that very moment when our heroine sank fainting upon the doorstep, a handsome equipage, drawn by two superb black steeds, happened to pass along the street.  Its appearance and character proclaimed it at once to be one of those vehicles in which only the superior classes of the exclusive aristocracy are privileged to ride. Its sides were emblazoned with escutcheons, insignia and other paraphernalia. The large gilt coronet that appeared up its panelling, surmounted by a bunch of huckleberries, quartered in a field of potatoes, indicated that its possessor was, at least, of the rank of marquis. A coachman and two grooms rode in front, while two footmen, seated in the boot, or box at the rear, contrived, by the immobility of their attitude and the melancholy of their faces, to inspire the scene with an exclusive and aristocratic grandeur.  The occupants of the equipage--for we refuse to count the menials as being such--were two in number, a lady and gentleman, both of advanced years. Their snow-white hair and benign countenances indicated that they belonged to that rare class of beings to whom rank and wealth are but an incentive to nobler things. A gentle philanthropy played all over their faces, and their eyes sought eagerly in the passing scene of the humble street for new objects of benefaction.  Those acquainted with the countenances of the aristocracy would have recognized at once in the occupants of the equipage the Marquis of Muddlenut and his spouse, the Marchioness.  It was the eye of the Marchioness which first detected the form of Winnifred Clair upon the doorstep.  \"Hold! pause! stop!\" she cried, in lively agitation.  The horses were at once pulled in, the brakes applied to the wheels, and with the aid of a powerful lever, operated by three of the menials, the carriage was brought to a standstill.  \"See! Look!\" cried the Marchioness. \"She has fainted. Quick, William, your flask. Let us hasten to her aid.\"  In another moment the noble lady was bending over the prostrate form of Winnifred Clair, and pouring brandy between her lips.  Winnifred opened her eyes. \"Where am I?\" she asked feebly.  \"She speaks!\" cried the Marchioness. \"Give her another flaskful.\"  After the second flask the girl sat up.  \"Tell me,\" she cried, clasping her hands, \"what has happened? Where am I?\"  \"With friends!\" answered the Marchioness. \"But do not essay to speak. Drink this. You must husband your strength. Meantime, let us drive you to your home.\"  Winnifred was lifted tenderly by the menservants into the aristocratic equipage. The brake was unset, the lever reversed, and the carriage thrown again into motion.  On the way Winnifred, at the solicitation of the Marchioness, related her story.  \"My poor child!\" exclaimed the lady, \"how you must have suffered. Thank Heaven it is over now. To-morrow we shall call for you and bring you away with us to Muddlenut Chase.\"  Alas, could she but have known it, before the morrow should dawn, worse dangers still were in store for our heroine. But what these dangers were, we must reserve for another chapter.     CHAPTER IV  A GAMBLING PARTY IN ST. JAMES'S CLOSE   We must now ask our readers to shift the scene--if they don't mind doing this for us--to the apartments of the Earl of Wynchgate in St. James's Close. The hour is nine o'clock in the evening, and the picture before us is one of revelry and dissipation so characteristic of the nobility of England. The atmosphere of the room is thick with blue Havana smoke such as is used by the nobility, while on the green baize table a litter of counters and cards, in which aces, kings, and even two spots are heaped in confusion, proclaim the reckless nature of the play.  Seated about the table are six men, dressed in the height of fashion, each with collar and white necktie and broad white shirt, their faces stamped with all, or nearly all, of the baser passions of mankind.  Lord Wynchgate--for he it was who sat at the head of the table--rose with an oath, and flung his cards upon the table.  All turned and looked at him, with an oath. \"Curse it, Dogwood,\" he exclaimed, with another oath, to the man who sat beside him. \"Take the money. I play no more to-night. My luck is out.\"  \"Ha! ha!\" laughed Lord Dogwood, with a third oath, \"your mind is not on the cards. Who is the latest young beauty, pray, who so absorbs you? I hear a whisper in town of a certain misadventure of yours----\"  \"Dogwood,\" said Wynchgate, clenching his fist, \"have a care, man, or you shall measure the length of my sword.\"  Both noblemen faced each other, their hands upon their swords.  \"My lords, my lords!\" pleaded a distinguished-looking man of more advanced years, who sat at one side of the table, and in whose features the habitu√©s of diplomatic circles would have recognized the handsome lineaments of the Marquis of Frogwater, British Ambassador to Siam, \"let us have no quarrelling. Come, Wynchgate, come, Dogwood,\" he continued, with a mild oath, \"put up your swords. It were a shame to waste time in private quarrelling. They may be needed all too soon in Cochin China, or, for the matter of that,\" he added sadly, \"in Cambodia or in Dutch Guinea.\"  \"Frogwater,\" said young Lord Dogwood, with a generous flush, \"I was wrong. Wynchgate, your hand.\"  The two noblemen shook hands.  \"My friends,\" said Lord Wynchgate, \"in asking you to abandon our game, I had an end in view. I ask your help in an affair of the heart.\"  \"Ha! excellent!\" exclaimed the five noblemen. \"We are with you heart and soul.\"  \"I propose this night,\" continued Wynchgate, \"with your help, to carry off a young girl, a female!\"  \"An abduction!\" exclaimed the Ambassador somewhat sternly. \"Wynchgate, I cannot countenance this.\"  \"Mistake me not,\" said the Earl, \"I intend to abduct her. But I propose nothing dishonourable. It is my firm resolve to offer her marriage.\"  \"Then,\" said Lord Frogwater, \"I am with you.\"  \"Gentlemen,\" concluded Wynchgate, \"all is ready. The coach is below. I have provided masks, pistols, and black cloaks. Follow me.\"  A few moments later, a coach, with the blinds drawn, in which were six noblemen armed to the teeth, might have been seen, were it not for the darkness, approaching the humble lodging in which Winnifred Clair was sheltered.  But what it did when it got there, we must leave to another chapter.     CHAPTER V  THE ABDUCTION   The hour was twenty minutes to ten on the evening described in our last chapter.  Winnifred Clair was seated, still fully dressed, at the window of the bedroom, looking out over the great city.  A light tap came at the door.  \"If it's a fried egg,\" called Winnifred softly, \"I do not need it. I ate yesterday.\"  \"No,\" said the voice of the Landlady. \"You are wanted below.\"  \"I!\" exclaimed Winnifred, \"below!\"  \"You,\" said the Landlady, \"below. A party of gentlemen have called for you.\"  \"Gentlemen,\" exclaimed Winnifred, putting her hand to her brow in perplexity, \"for me! at this late hour! Here! This evening! In this house?\"  \"Yes,\" repeated the Landlady, \"six gentlemen. They arrived in a closed coach. They are all closely masked and heavily armed. They beg you will descend at once.\"  \"Just Heaven!\" cried the Unhappy Girl. \"Is it possible that they mean to abduct me?\"  \"They do,\" said the Landlady. \"They said so!\"  \"Alas!\" cried Winnifred, \"I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20633"],["title","Winsome Winnie and other New Nonsense Novels (#2)"],["body"," am powerless. Tell them\"--she hesitated--\"tell them I will be down immediately. Let them not come up. Keep them below on any pretext. Show them an album. Let them look at the goldfish. Anything, but not here! I shall be ready in a moment.\"  Feverishly she made herself ready. As hastily as possible she removed all traces of tears from her face. She threw about her shoulders an opera cloak, and with a light Venetian scarf half concealed the beauty of her hair and features. \"Abducted!\" she murmured, \"and by six of them! I think she said six. Oh, the horror of it!\" A touch of powder to her cheeks and a slight blackening of her eyebrows, and the courageous girl was ready.  Lord Wynchgate and his companions--for they it was, that is to say, they were it--sat below in the sitting-room looking at the albums. \"Woman,\" said Lord Wynchgate to the Landlady, with an oath, \"let her hurry up. We have seen enough of these. We can wait no longer.\"  \"I am here,\" cried a clear voice upon the threshold, and Winnifred stood before them. \"My lords, for I divine who you are and wherefore you have come, take me, do your worst with me, but spare, oh, spare this humble companion of my sorrow.\"  \"Right-oh!\" said Lord Dogwood, with a brutal laugh.  \"Enough,\" exclaimed Wynchgate, and seizing Winnifred by the waist, he dragged her forth out of the house and out upon the street.  But something in the brutal violence of his behaviour seemed to kindle for the moment a spark of manly feeling, if such there were, in the breasts of his companions.  \"Wynchgate,\" cried young Lord Dogwood, \"my mind misgives me. I doubt if this is a gentlemanly thing to do. I'll have no further hand in it.\"  A chorus of approval from his companions endorsed his utterance. For a moment they hesitated.  \"Nay,\" cried Winnifred, turning to confront the masked faces that stood about her, \"go forward with your fell design. I am here. I am helpless. Let no prayers stay your hand. Go to it.\"  \"Have done with this!\" cried Wynchgate, with a brutal oath. \"Shove her in the coach.\"  But at the very moment the sound of hurrying footsteps was heard, and a clear, ringing, manly, well-toned, vibrating voice cried, \"Hold! Stop! Desist! Have a care, titled villain, or I will strike you to the earth.\"  A tall aristocratic form bounded out of the darkness.  \"Gentlemen,\" cried Wynchgate, releasing his hold upon the frightened girl, \"we are betrayed. Save yourselves. To the coach.\"  In another instant the six noblemen had leaped into the coach and disappeared down the street.  Winnifred, still half inanimate with fright, turned to her rescuer, and saw before her the form and lineaments of the Unknown Stranger, who had thus twice stood between her and disaster. Half fainting, she fell swooning into his arms.  \"Dear lady,\" he exclaimed, \"rouse yourself. You are safe. Let me restore you to your home!\"  \"That voice!\" cried Winnifred, resuming consciousness. \"It is my benefactor.\"  She would have swooned again, but the Unknown lifted her bodily up the steps of her home and leant her against the door.  \"Farewell,\" he said, in a voice resonant with gloom.  \"Oh, sir!\" cried the unhappy girl, \"let one who owes so much to one who has saved her in her hour of need at least know his name.\"  But the stranger, with a mournful gesture of farewell, had disappeared as rapidly as he had come.  But, as to why he had disappeared, we must ask our reader's patience for another chapter.     CHAPTER VI  THE UNKNOWN   The scene is now shifted, sideways and forwards, so as to put it at Muddlenut Chase, and to make it a fortnight later than the events related in the last chapter.  Winnifred is now at the Chase as the guest of the Marquis and Marchioness. There her bruised soul finds peace.  The Chase itself was one of those typical country homes which are, or were till yesterday, the glory of England. The approach to the Chase lay through twenty miles of glorious forest, filled with fallow deer and wild bulls. The house itself, dating from the time of the Plantagenets, was surrounded by a moat covered with broad lilies and floating green scum. Magnificent peacocks sunned themselves on the terraces, while from the surrounding shrubberies there rose the soft murmur of doves, pigeons, bats, owls and partridges.  Here sat Winnifred Clair day after day upon the terrace recovering her strength, under the tender solicitude of the Marchioness.  Each day the girl urged upon her noble hostess the necessity of her departure. \"Nay,\" said the Marchioness, with gentle insistence, \"stay where you are. Your soul is bruised. You must rest.\"  \"Alas,\" cried Winnifred, \"who am I that I should rest? Alone, despised, buffeted by fate, what right have I to your kindness?\"  \"Miss Clair,\" replied the noble lady, \"wait till you are stronger. There is something that I wish to say to you.\"  Then at last, one morning when Winnifred's temperature had fallen to ninety-eight point three, the Marchioness spoke.  \"Miss Clair,\" she said, in a voice which throbbed with emotion, \"Winnifred, if I may so call you, Lord Muddlenut and I have formed a plan for your future. It is our dearest wish that you should marry our son.\"  \"Alas,\" cried Winnifred, while tears rose in her eyes, \"it cannot be!\"  \"Say not so,\" cried the Marchioness. \"Our son, Lord Mordaunt Muddlenut, is young, handsome, all that a girl could desire. After months of wandering he returns to us this morning. It is our dearest wish to see him married and established. We offer you his hand.\"  \"Indeed,\" replied Winnifred, while her tears fell even more freely, \"I seem to requite but ill the kindness that you show. Alas, my heart is no longer in my keeping.\"  \"Where is it?\" cried the Marchioness.  \"It is another's. One whose very name I do not know holds it in his keeping.\"  But at this moment a blithe, gladsome step was heard upon the flagstones of the terrace. A manly, ringing voice, which sent a thrill to Winnifred's heart, cried \"Mother!\" and in another instant Lord Mordaunt Muddlenut, for he it was, had folded the Marchioness to his heart.  Winnifred rose, her heart beating wildly. One glance was enough. The newcomer, Lord Mordaunt, was none other than the Unknown, the Unaccountable, to whose protection she had twice owed her life.  With a wild cry Winnifred Clair leaped across the flagstones of the terrace and fled into the park.     CHAPTER VII  THE PROPOSAL   They stood beneath the great trees of the ancestral park, into which Lord Mordaunt had followed Winnifred at a single bound. All about them was the radiance of early June.  Lord Mordaunt knelt on one knee on the greensward, and with a touch in which respect and reverence were mingled with the deepest and manliest emotion, he took between his finger and thumb the tip of the girl's gloved hand.  \"Miss Clair,\" he uttered, in a voice suffused with the deepest yearning, yet vibrating with the most profound respect, \"Miss Clair--Winnifred--hear me, I implore!\"  \"Alas,\" cried Winnifred, struggling in vain to disengage the tip of her glove from the impetuous clasp of the young nobleman, \"alas, whither can I fly? I do not know my way through the wood, and there are bulls in all directions. I am not used to them! Lord Mordaunt, I implore you, let the tears of one but little skilled in the art of dissimulation----\"  \"Nay, Winnifred,\" said the Young Earl, \"fly not. Hear me out!\"  \"Let me fly,\" begged the unhappy girl.  \"You must not fly,\" pleaded Mordaunt. \"Let me first, here upon bended knee, convey to you the expression of a devotion, a love, as ardent and as deep as ever burned in a human heart. Winnifred, be my bride!\"  \"Oh, sir,\" sobbed Winnifred, \"if the knowledge of a gratitude, a thankfulness from one whose heart will ever treasure as its proudest memory the recollection of one who did for one all that one could have wanted done for one--if this be some poor guerdon, let it suffice. But, alas, my birth, the dark secret of my birth forbids----\"  \"Nay,\" cried Mordaunt, leaping now to his feet, \"your birth is all right. I have looked into it myself. It is as good--or nearly as good--as my own. Till I knew this, my lips were sealed by duty. While I supposed that you had a lower birth and I an upper, I was bound to silence. But come with me to the house. There is one arrived with me who will explain all.\"  Hand in hand the lovers, for such they now were, returned to the Chase. There in the great hall the Marquis and the Marchioness were standing ready to greet them.  \"My child!\" exclaimed the noble lady, as she folded Winnifred to her heart. Then she turned to her son. \"Let her know all!\" she cried.  Lord Mordaunt stepped across the room to a curtain. He drew it aside, and there stepped forth Mr. Bonehead, the old lawyer who had cast Winnifred upon the world.  \"Miss Clair,\" said the Lawyer, advancing and taking the girl's hand for a moment in a kindly clasp, \"the time has come for me to explain all. You are not, you never were, the penniless girl that you suppose. Under the terms of your father's will, I was called upon to act a part and to throw you upon the world. It was my client's wish, and I followed it. I told you, quite truthfully, that I had put part of your money into options in an oil-well. Miss Clair, that well is now producing a million gallons of gasolene a month!'  \"A million gallons!\" cried Winnifred. \"I can never use it.\"  \"Wait till you own a motor-car, Miss Winnifred,\" said the Lawyer.  \"Then I am rich!\" exclaimed the bewildered girl.  \"Rich beyond your dreams,\" answered the Lawyer. \"Miss Clair, you own in your own right about half of the State of Texas--I think it is in Texas, at any rate either Texas or Rhode Island, or one of those big states in America. More than this, I have invested your property since your father's death so wisely that even after paying the income tax and the property tax, the inheritance tax, the dog tax and the tax on amusements, you will still have one half of one per cent to spend.\""]]]
