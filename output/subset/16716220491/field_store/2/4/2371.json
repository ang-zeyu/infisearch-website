When Charlie went out, as we have said, he found that Shank had brought his sister May with him.  This troubled our hero a good deal, for he had purposed having a confidential talk with his old comrade upon future plans and prospects, to the accompaniment of the roaring sea, and a third party was destructive of such intention.  Besides, poor May, although exceedingly unselfish and sweet and good, was at that transition period of life when girlhood is least attractive--at least to young men: when bones are obtrusive, and angles too conspicuous, and the form generally is too suggestive of flatness and longitude; while shyness marks the manners, and inexperience dwarfs the mind.  We would not, however, suggest for a moment that May was ugly.  By no means, but she had indeed reached what may be styled a plain period of life--a period in which some girls become silently sheepish, and others tomboyish; May was among the former, and therefore a drag upon conversation.  But, after all, it mattered little, for the rapidly increasing gale rendered speech nearly impossible.  \"It's too wild a day for you, May,\" said Brooke, as he shook hands with her; \"I wonder you care to be out.\"  \"She _doesn't_ care to be out, but I wanted her to come, and she's a good obliging girl, so she came,\" said Shank, drawing her arm through his as they pressed forward against the blast in the direction of the shore.  Shank Leather had become a sturdy young fellow by that time, but was much shorter than his friend.  There was about him, however, an unmistakable look of dissipation--or, rather, the beginning of it--which accounted for Mrs Brooke's objection to him as a companion for her son.  We have said that the cottage lay about half-a-mile from the shore, which could be reached by a winding lane between high banks.  These effectually shut out the view of the sea until one was close to it, though, at certain times, the roar of the waves could be heard even in Sealford itself.  Such a time was the present, for the gale had lashed the sea into wildest fury, and not only did the three friends hear it, as, with bent heads, they forced their way against the wind, but they felt the foam of ocean on their faces as it was carried inland sometimes in lumps and flakes.  At last they came to the end of the lane, and the sea, lashed to its wildest condition, lay before them like a sheet of tortured foam.  \"Grand! isn't it?\" said Brooke, stopping and drawing himself up for a moment, as if with a desire to combat the opposing elements.  If May Leather could not speak, she could at all events gaze, for she had superb brown eyes, and they glittered, just then, like glowing coals, while a wealth of rippling brown hair was blown from its fastenings, and flew straight out behind her.  \"Look! look there!\" shouted her brother with a wild expression, as he pointed to a part of the rocky shore where a vessel was dimly seen through the drift.  \"She's trying to weather the point,\" exclaimed Brooke, clearing the moisture from his eyes, and endeavouring to look steadily.  \"She'll never weather it.  See! the fishermen are following her along-shore,\" cried young Leather, dropping his sister's arm, and bounding away.  \"Oh! don't leave me behind, Shank,\" pleaded May.  Shank was beyond recall, but our hero, who had also sprung forward, heard the pleading voice and turned back.  \"Here, hook on to me,\" he cried quickly, for he was in no humour to delay.  The girl grasped his arm at once, and, to say truth, she was not much of a hindrance, for, although somewhat inelegant, as we have said, she was lithe as a lizard and fleet as a young colt.  A few minutes brought them to the level shore where Brooke left May to shelter herself with some fisher-women behind a low wall, while he ran along to a spot where a crowd of fishermen and old salts, enveloped in oil-skins, were discussing the situation as they leaned against the shrieking wind.  \"Will she weather it, Grinder, think you?\" he asked of an elderly man, whose rugged features resembled mahogany, the result of having bid defiance to wind and weather for nigh half a century.  \"She may, Mr Brooke, an' she mayn't,\" answered the matter-of-fact man of the sea, in the gruff monotone with which he would have summoned all hands to close reef in a hurricane.  \"If her tackle holds she'll do it. If it don't she won't.\"  \"We've sent round for the rocket anyhow,\" said a smart young fisherman, who seemed to rejoice in opposing his broad chest to the blast, and in listening to the thunder of the waves as they rolled into the exposed bay in great battalions, chasing each other in wild tumultuous fury, as if each were bent on being first in the mad assault upon the shore.  \"Has the lifeboat coxswain been called?\" asked Charlie, after a few minutes' silence, for the voice of contending elements was too great to render converse easy or agreeable.  \"Yes, sir,\" answered the man nearest to him, \"but she's bin called to a wreck in Mussel Bay, an' that brig will be all right or in Davy Jones's locker long afore th' lifeboat 'ud fetch round here.\"  Silence again fell on the group as they gazed out to sea, pushing eagerly down the beach until they were ankle-deep in the foam of each expended wave; for the brig was by that time close on the point of rocks, staggering under more sail than she could carry with safety.  \"She'll do it!\" exclaimed the smart young fisherman, ready to cheer with enthusiastic hope.  \"Done for!  Lost!\" cried one, while something like a groan burst from the others as they saw the brig's topmasts go over the side, and one of her sails blown to ribbons.  She fell away towards the rocks at once.  Like great black teeth these rocks seemed to leap in the midst of the foam, as if longing to grasp the ill-fated vessel, which had, indeed, all but weathered the dangerous point, and all might have been well if her gear had only held; but now, as if paralysed, she drifted into the bay where certain destruction awaited her.  Just at that moment a great cheer arose, for the rocket-cart, drawn by the men of the Coast-Guard, was seen rattling over the downs towards them.  Anxiety for the fate of the doomed brig was now changed into eager hope for the rescue of her crew.  The fishermen crowded round the Coast-Guard men as they ran the cart close down to the water's edge, and some of them--specially the smart young fellow already mentioned--made eager offer of their services.  Charlie Brooke stood aloof, looking on with profound interest, for it was the first time he had ever seen the Manby rocket apparatus brought into action.  He made no hasty offer to assist, for he was a cool youth--even while burning with impatient enthusiasm-- and saw at a glance that the men of the Coast-Guard were well able to manage their own affairs and required no aid from him.  As the brig was coming straight in they could easily calculate where she would strike, so that the rocket men could set up their triangle and arrange their tackle without delay.  This was fortunate, for the wreck was carried shoreward with great rapidity.  She struck at last when within a short distance of the beach, and the faces of those on board could be distinctly seen, and their cries heard, as both masts snapped off and were swept over the side, where they tore at the shrouds like wild creatures, or charged the hulk like battering-rams.  Instantly the billows that had borne the vessel on their crests burst upon her sides, and spurted high in air over her, falling back on her deck, and sweeping off everything that was moveable.  It could be seen that only three or four men were on deck, and these kept well under the lee of the bulwarks near the stern where they were strongest.  \"No passengers, I think,\" said one of the fishermen; \"no women, anyhow.\"  \"Not likely they'd be 'lowed on deck even if there was,\" growled Grinder, in his monotone.  \"Now, then, out o' the way,\" cried the leader of the Coast-Guard men, as he laid a rocket in its place.  \"Line all clear, Fred?\"  \"All clear.\"  Next moment there was a burst of flame, a crash, and a vicious whizz as the powerful projectile leaped from its stand and sped out to sea, in grand defiance of the opposing gale, with its light line behind it.  A cheer marked its flight, but a groan told of its descent into the boiling sea, considerably to the left of the wreck.  \"_What_ a pity!\" cried Shank Leather, who had come close to his friend when the rocket-cart arrived.  \"No matter,\" said Brooke, whose compressed lips and flashing eyes told of deep but suppressed feelings.  \"There are more rockets.\"  He was right.  While he was speaking, another rocket was placed and fired.  It was well directed, but fell short.  Another, and yet another, rose and fell, but failed to reach its mark, and the remainder of the rockets refused to go off from some unknown cause--either because they had been too long in stock or had become damp.  Meantime the brig was tossed farther and farther in, until she stuck quite fast.  Then it became evident that she must soon break up, and her crew perish.  Hasty plans and eager advice were proposed and given. Then the smart young fisherman suddenly sprang forward, and threw off his oil-coat and sou'-wester.  \"Here! hold on!\" he cried, catching up the end of the rocket line, and fastening it round his waist, while he kicked off his heavy boots.  \"You can't do it, Bill,\" cried some.  \"Too far to swim,\" cried others.  \"The seas 'll knock the life out o' ye,\" said Grinder, \"afore you're clear o' the sand.\"  Despite these warnings the brave young fellow dashed into the foam, and plunged straight into the first mighty breaker that towered over his head.  But he was too much excited to act effectively.  He failed to time his plunge well.  The wave fell upon him with a roar and crushed him down.  In a few seconds he was dragged ashore almost insensible.  Example, whether good or bad, is infectious."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],["title","The Coral Island (#1)"],["body","one, \"is the most horrible headland I ever doubled. I've sailed round it twice already, and both times the ship was a'most blow'd out o' the water.\"  \"I've been round it once,\" said another; \"an' that time the sails were split, and the ropes frozen in the blocks so that they wouldn't work, and we wos all but lost.\"  \"An' I've been round it five times,\" cried a third; \"an' every time wos wuss than another, the gales wos so tree-mendous!\"  \"And I've been round it, no times at all,\" cried Peterkin with an impudent wink in his eye, \"an' that time I wos blow'd inside out!\"  Nevertheless we passed the dreaded cape without much rough weather, and in the course of a few weeks afterwards were sailing gently, before a warm tropical breeze, over the Pacific Ocean.  Thus we proceeded on our voyage--sometimes bounding merrily before a fair breeze; at other times floating calmly on the glassy wave and fishing for the curious inhabitants of the deep, all of which, although the sailors thought little of them, were strange, and interesting, and very wonderful to me.  At last we came among the Coral Islands of the Pacific; and I shall never forget the delight with which I gazed--when we chanced to pass one--at the pure white, dazzling shores, and the verdant palm-trees, which looked bright and beautiful in the sunshine.  And often did we three long to be landed on one, imagining that we should certainly find perfect happiness there!  Our wish was granted sooner than we expected.  One night, soon after we entered the tropics, an awful storm burst upon our ship.  The first squall of wind carried away two of our masts, and left only the foremast standing.  Even this, however, was more than enough, for we did not dare to hoist a rag of sail on it.  For five days the tempest raged in all its fury.  Everything was swept off the decks, except one small boat.  The steersman was lashed to the wheel lest he should be washed away, and we all gave ourselves up for lost.  The captain said that he had no idea where we were, as we had been blown far out of our course; and we feared much that we might get among the dangerous coral reefs which are so numerous in the Pacific.  At daybreak on the sixth morning of the gale we saw land ahead; it was an island encircled by a reef of coral, on which the waves broke in fury.  There was calm water within this reef, but we could see only one narrow opening into it.  For this opening we steered; but ere we reached it a tremendous wave broke on our stern, tore the rudder completely off, and left us at the mercy of the winds and waves.  \"It's all over with us now, lads!\" said the captain to the men.  \"Get the boat ready to launch; we shall be on the rocks in less than half-an-hour.\"  The men obeyed in gloomy silence, for they felt that there was little hope of so small a boat living in such a sea.  \"Come, boys,\" said Jack Martin, in a grave tone, to me and Peterkin, as we stood on the quarter-deck awaiting our fate--\"come, boys; we three shall stick together.  You see it is impossible that the little boat can reach the shore, crowded with men.  It will be sure to upset, so I mean rather to trust myself to a large oar.  I see through the telescope that the ship will strike at the tail of the reef, where the waves break into the quiet water inside; so if we manage to cling to the oar till it is driven over the breakers, we may perhaps gain the shore.  What say you? Will you join me?\"  We gladly agreed to follow Jack, for he inspired us with confidence-- although I could perceive, by the sad tone of his voice, that he had little hope; and indeed, when I looked at the white waves that lashed the reef and boiled against the rocks as if in fury, I felt that there was but a step between us and death.  My heart sank within me; but at that moment my thoughts turned to my beloved mother, and I remembered those words, which were among the last that she said to me: \"Ralph, my dearest child, always remember, in the hour of danger, to look to your Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  He alone is both able and willing to save your body and your soul.\"  So I felt much comforted when I thought thereon.  The ship was now very near the rocks.  The men were ready with the boat, and the captain beside them giving orders, when a tremendous wave came towards us.  We three ran towards the bow to lay hold of our oar, and had barely reached it when the wave fell on the deck with a crash like thunder.  At the same moment the ship struck; the foremast broke off close to the deck and went over the side, carrying the boat and men along with it.  Our oar got entangled with the wreck, and Jack seized an axe to cut it free; but owing to the motion of the ship, he missed the cordage and struck the axe deep into the oar.  Another wave, however, washed it clear of the wreck.  We all seized hold of it, and the next instant we were struggling in the wild sea.  The last thing I saw was the boat whirling in the surf, and all the sailors tossed into the foaming waves.  Then I became insensible.  On recovering from my swoon I found myself lying on a bank of soft grass, under shelter of an overhanging rock, with Peterkin on his knees by my side, tenderly bathing my temples with water, and endeavouring to stop the blood that flowed from a wound in my forehead.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE CORAL ISLAND--OUR FIRST COGITATIONS AFTER LANDING AND THE RESULT OF THEM--WE CONCLUDE THAT THE ISLAND IS UNINHABITED.  There is a strange and peculiar sensation experienced in recovering from a state of insensibility which is almost indescribable: a sort of dreamy, confused consciousness; a half-waking, half-sleeping condition, accompanied with a feeling of weariness, which, however, is by no means disagreeable.  As I slowly recovered, and heard the voice of Peterkin inquiring whether I felt better, I thought that I must have overslept myself, and should be sent to the masthead for being lazy; but before I could leap up in haste, the thought seemed to vanish suddenly away, and I fancied that I must have been ill.  Then a balmy breeze fanned my cheek; and I thought of home, and the garden at the back of my father's cottage with its luxuriant flowers, and the sweet-scented honeysuckle that my dear mother trained so carefully upon the trellised porch.  But the roaring of the surf put these delightful thoughts to flight, and I was back again at sea, watching the dolphins and the flying-fish, and reefing topsails off the wild and stormy Cape Horn.  Gradually the roar of the surf became louder and more distinct.  I thought of being wrecked far, far away from my native land, and slowly opened my eyes to meet those of my companion Jack, who, with a look of intense anxiety, was gazing into my face.  \"Speak to us, my dear Ralph!\" whispered Jack tenderly.  \"Are you better now?\"  I smiled and looked up, saying, \"Better!  Why, what do you mean, Jack? I'm quite well.\"  \"Then what are you shamming for, and frightening us in this way?\" said Peterkin, smiling through his tears; for the poor boy had been really under the impression that I was dying.  I now raised myself on my elbow, and putting my hand to my forehead, found that it had been cut pretty severely, and that I had lost a good deal of blood.  \"Come, come, Ralph,\" said Jack, pressing me gently backward, \"lie down, my boy; you're not right yet.  Wet your lips with this water; it's cool and clear as crystal.  I got it from a spring close at hand.  There, now, don't say a word--hold your tongue,\" he said, seeing me about to speak.  \"I'll tell you all about it, but you must not utter a syllable till you have rested well.\"  \"Oh, don't stop him from speaking, Jack!\" said Peterkin, who, now that his fears for my safety were removed, busied himself in erecting a shelter of broken branches in order to protect me from the wind--which, however, was almost unnecessary, for the rock beside which I had been laid completely broke the force of the gale.  \"Let him speak, Jack; it's a comfort to hear that he's alive after lying there stiff and white and sulky for a whole hour, just like an Egyptian mummy.--Never saw such a fellow as you are, Ralph--always up to mischief.  You've almost knocked out all my teeth and more than half-choked me, and now you go shamming dead!  It's very wicked of you, indeed it is.\"  While Peterkin ran on in this style my faculties became quite clear again, and I began to understand my position.  \"What do you mean by saying I half-choked you, Peterkin?\" said I.  \"What do I mean?  Is English not your mother-tongue? or do you want me to repeat it in French by way of making it clearer?  Don't you remember?\"  \"I remember nothing,\" said I, interrupting him, \"after we were thrown into the sea.\"  \"Hush, Peterkin!\" said Jack; \"you're exciting Ralph with your nonsense.--I'll explain it to you.  You recollect that, after the ship struck, we three sprang over the bow into the sea?  Well, I noticed that the oar struck your head and gave you that cut on the brow which nearly stunned you, so that you grasped Peterkin round the neck without knowing apparently what you were about.  In doing so, you pushed the telescope-- which you clung to as if it had been your life--against Peterkin's mouth--\"  \"Pushed it against his mouth!\" interrupted Peterkin; \"say crammed it down his throat!  Why, there's a distinct mark of the brass rim on the back of my gullet at this moment!\"  \"Well, well, be that as it may,\" continued Jack, \"you clung to him, Ralph, till I feared you really would choke him.  But I saw that he had a good hold of the oar; so I exerted myself to the utmost to push you towards the shore, which we luckily reached without much trouble, for the water inside the reef is quite calm.\"  \"But the captain and crew, what of them?\"  I inquired anxiously.  Jack shook his head.  \"Are they lost?\"  \"No, they are not lost, I hope; but, I fear, there is not much chance of their being saved.  The ship struck at the very tail of the island on which"]]]
