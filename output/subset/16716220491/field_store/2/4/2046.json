I am assuming that Miss Cavell did give such protection to her compatriots, for all accessible information supports this view, and if so, however commendable her motive and heroic her conduct, she certainly was guilty of an infraction of military law, which justified some punishment and possibly her forcible detention during the period of the war.  To regard her execution as an ordinary incident of war is an affront to civilization, and as it is symptomatic of the Prussian occupation of Belgium and not a sporadic incident, it acquires a significance which justifies a full recital of this black chapter of Prussianism. It illustrates the reign of terror which has existed in Belgium since the German occupation.  When the German Chancellor made his famous speech in the Reichstag on August 4th, 1914, and admitted at the bar of the world the crime which was then being initiated, he said:       \"The wrong--I speak openly--that we are committing we will endeavor      to make good as soon as our military goal has been reached.\"  Within a few weeks the military goal was reached by the seizure of practically all of Belgium and by the voluntary surrender of Brussels to the invader, and since then, for a period of fourteen months, the Belgian people have been subjected to a state of tyranny for which it would be difficult to find a parallel, unless we turned to the history of the Netherlands in the Sixteenth Century and recalled its occupation by the Duke of Alva. It must be said in candor that the Prussian occupation of Belgium has not yet caused as many victims as the \"Bloody Council\" of the Duke of Alva, for the estimated number of non-combatants, who have been shot in Belgium during the last fourteen months, is only 6,000 as against the 18,000 whom it is estimated the Duke of Alva mercilessly put to death.  It may also be the fact that the present oppression of Belgium is marked by some approach to the forms of law; but it may be doubted whether the difference is not more in appearance than in reality, for the administration of law in Belgium has been a mockery. Of this there can be no more striking or detailed proof than the protest which was presented to the German authorities on February 17th, 1915, by M. Léon Théodor, the head of the Brussels bar. The truth of this formal accusation may be fairly measured by the strong probability that the brave leader of the Brussels bar would never have ventured to have made the statements hereinafter referred to to the German Military Governor unless he was reasonably sure of his facts. What he said on behalf of the bar of Brussels was said in the shadow of possible death, and if he had consciously or deliberately maligned the Prussian administration of justice in this open and specific manner, he assuredly took his life into his hands. This brave and noble document will forever remain one of the gravest indictments of German misrule, and as it states, on the authority of one who was in a position to know, the details of the savage tyranny which masqueraded under the forms of law, it is appended, with some condensation, to this article.  After stating the fact \"that everything about the German judicial organisation in Belgium is contrary to the principles of law,\" and after showing that Belgian civilians were punished for the violations of law which had never been proclaimed and of which, therefore, they knew nothing, the distinguished President of the Order of Advocates says:       \"_This absence of certainty is not only the negation of all the      principles of law; it weighs on the mind and on the conscience; it      bewilders one, it seems to be a permanent menace for all, and the      danger is all the more real, because these courts permit neither      public nor defensive procedure, nor do they permit the accused to      receive any communication regarding his case, nor is any right of      defense assured him._       \"This is arbitrary injustice; the Judge left to himself, that is,      to his impressions, his prejudices, and his surroundings. This is      abandoning the accused in his distress, to grapple alone with his      all-powerful adversary.       \"This justice uncontrolled, and consequently without guarantee,      constitutes for us the most dangerous and oppressive of      illegalities. _We cannot conceive justice as a judicial or moral      possibility without free defense._       \"Free defense, that is, light thrown on all the elements of the      suit; public sentiment being heard in the bosom of the judgment      hall, the right to say everything in the most respectful manner,      and also the courage to dare everything, these must be put at the      service of the unfortunate one, of justice and law.       \"It is one of the greatest conquests of our history. It is the      keystone of our individual liberty.       \"_What are your sources of information?_       \"Besides the judges, the men of the Secret Service and the      denouncers (in French: 'délateurs').       \"The Secret Service men in civilian clothes, not bearing any      insignia, mixing with the crowds in the street, in the cafés, on      the platforms of street cars, listen to the conversations carried      on around them, ready to grasp any secret, on the watch not only      for acts but for intentions.       \"These denouncers of our nation are ever multiplying. _What      confidence can be placed in their declarations, inspired by hate,      spite, or low cupidity?_ Such assistants can bring to the cause of      justice no useful collaboration.       \"If we add to this total absence of control and of defense, these      preventive arrests, the long detentions, the searches in the      private domiciles, _we shall have an almost complete idea of the      moral tortures to which our aspirations, our convictions, and our      liberties are subjected at the present time_. * * *       \"Will it be said that we are living under martial law: that we are      submitting to the hard necessities of war: that all should give way      before the superior interests of your armies?       \"_I can understand martial law for armies in the field. It is the      immediate reply to an aggression against the troops, repression      without words, the summary justice of the commander of the army      responsible for his soldiers._       \"_But our armies are far away; we are no longer in the zone of      military operations. Nothing here menaces your troops, the      inhabitants are calm._       \"The people have taken up work again. You have bidden them do it.      Each one devotes himself, Magistrates, Judges, officials of the      provinces and cities, the clergy, all are at their post, united in      one outburst of national interest and brotherhood.       \"However, this calm does not mean that they have forgotten.       \"The Belgian people lived happily in their corner of the earth,      confident in their dream of independence. They saw this dream      dispelled, they saw their country ruined and devastated, its      ancient hospitable soil has been sown with thousands of tombs where      our own sleep; the war has made tears flow which no hand can dry.      _No, the murdered soul of Belgium will never forget._       \"But this nation has a profound respect for its duty. It will      always respect it.       \"Has not the hour come to consider as closed the period of invasion      and to substitute for the measures of exception the rules of      occupation as defined by international law and the treaty of The      Hague, which sets a limit to the occupying power and imposes      obligations on the country occupied?       \"Has not the hour arrived to restore the Court House to the      judiciary corps? The military occupation of the Court House is a      violation of the treaty of The Hague.       \"Among the moral forces does one exist that is superior to justice?      Justice dominates them all. _As ancient as humanity itself, eternal      as the need of man and nations to be and to feel protected, it is      the basis of all civilization._ The arts and sciences are its      tributaries. Religious creeds live and prosper in its shadow. Is it      not a religion in itself?       \"Belgium raised a magnificent temple to Justice in its capital.       \"This temple, which is our pride, has been converted into barracks      for the German soldiers. A small part of it, becoming smaller every      day, is reserved for the courts. The Magistrates and lawyers have      access to it by a small private staircase.       \"Sad as are the conditions under which they are called to      administer justice, the Judges have decided, nevertheless, to sit.      The Bar has co-operated with them. Accustomed to live in an      atmosphere of deference and of dignity, they do not recognize      themselves in this sort of guard-room, and, in fact, justice      surrounded with so little respect, is it still justice?\"  As this dignified and noble protest did not lead to any amelioration of the harsh conditions, a month later the same brave jurist, M. Léon Théodor, appeared in Brussels before the so-called \"German Court of Justice\" and, in behalf of the entire Magistracy of Belgium, addressed to the Prussian Military Judges the following poignantly pathetic and nobly dignified address, which met with the same reception as the preceding communication.  The address reads as follows:       \"I present myself at the Bar, escorted by the Counsel of the Order,      surrounded by the sympathy and the confidence of all my colleagues      of Brussels, and I might add of all the Bars of the country. The      Bars of Liège, Ghent, Charleroi, Mons, Louvain, Antwerp have sent      to that of Brussels the expression of their professional solidarity      and have declared that they adhere to the resolutions taken by the      Counsel of the Order of Brussels. * * *       \"We are not annexed.

I must modestly admit I am too diffident of my own merit to place it in unnecessary opposition to preconceived associations; I have, therefore, like a maiden knight with his white shield, assumed for my hero, WAVERLEY, an uncontaminated name, bearing with its sound little of good or evil, excepting what the reader shall hereafter be pleased to affix to it. But my second or supplemental title was a matter of much more difficult election, since that, short as it is, may be held as pledging the author to some special mode of laying his scene, drawing his characters, and managing his adventures. Had I, for example, announced in my frontispiece, 'Waverley, a Tale of other Days,' must not every novel reader have anticipated a castle scarce less than that of Udolpho, of which the eastern wing had long been uninhabited, and the keys either lost, or consigned to the care of some aged butler or housekeeper, whose trembling steps, about the middle of the second volume, were doomed to guide the hero, or heroine, to the ruinous precincts? Would not the owl have shrieked and the cricket cried in my very title-page? and could it have been possible for me, with a moderate attention to decorum, to introduce any scene more lively than might be produced by the jocularity of a clownish but faithful valet, or the garrulous narrative of the heroine's fille-de-chambre, when rehearsing the stories of blood and horror which she had heard in the servants' hall? Again, had my title borne 'Waverley, a Romance from the German,' what head so obtuse as not to image forth a profligate abbot, an oppressive duke, a secret and mysterious association of Rosycrucians and Illuminati, with all their properties of black cowls, caverns, daggers, electrical machines, trap-doors, and dark-lanterns? Or if I had rather chosen to call my work a 'Sentimental Tale,' would it not have been a sufficient presage of a heroine with a profusion of auburn hair, and a harp, the soft solace of her solitary hours, which she fortunately finds always the means of transporting from castle to cottage, although she herself be sometimes obliged to jump out of a two-pair-of-stairs window, and is more than once bewildered on her journey, alone and on foot, without any guide but a blowzy peasant girl, whose jargon she hardly can understand? Or again, if my WAVERLEY had been entitled 'A Tale of the Times,' wouldst thou not, gentle reader, have demanded from me a dashing sketch of the fashionable world, a few anecdotes of private scandal thinly veiled, and if lusciously painted, so much the better? a heroine from Grosvenor Square, and a hero from the Barouche Club or the Four-in-hand, with a set of subordinate characters from the elegantes of Queen Anne Street East, or the dashing heroes of the Bow Street Office? I could proceed in proving the importance of a title-page, and displaying at the same time my own intimate knowledge of the particular ingredients necessary to the composition of romances and novels of various descriptions: but it is enough, and I scorn to tyrannize longer over the impatience of my reader, who is doubtless already anxious to know the choice made by an author so profoundly versed in the different branches of his art.  By fixing, then, the date of my story Sixty Years before the present 1st November, 1805, I would have my readers understand, that they will meet in the following pages neither a romance of chivalry, nor a tale of modern manners; that my hero will neither have iron on his shoulders, as of yore, nor on the heels of his boots, as is the present fashion of Bond Street; and that my damsels will neither be clothed 'in purple and in pall,' like the Lady Alice of an old ballad, nor reduced to the primitive nakedness of a modern fashionable at a rout. From this my choice of an era the understanding critic may further presage, that the object of my tale is more a description of men than manners. A tale of manners, to be interesting, must either refer to antiquity so great as to have become venerable, or it must bear a vivid reflection of those scenes which are passing daily before our eyes, and are interesting from their novelty. Thus the coat-of-mail of our ancestors, and the triple-furred pelisse of our modern beaux, may, though for very different reasons, be equally fit for the array of a fictitious character; but who, meaning the costume of his hero to be impressive, would willingly attire him in the court dress of George the Second's reign, with its no collar, large sleeves, and low pocket-holes? The same may be urged, with equal truth, of the Gothic hall, which, with its darkened and tinted windows, its elevated and gloomy roof, and massive oaken table garnished with boar's-head and rosemary, pheasants and peacocks, cranes and cygnets, has an excellent effect in fictitious description. Much may also be gained by a lively display of a modern fete, such as we have daily recorded in that part of a newspaper entitled the Mirror of Fashion, if we contrast these, or either of them, with the splendid formality of an entertainment given Sixty Years since; and thus it will be readily seen how much the painter of antique or of fashionable manners gains over him who delineates those of the last generation.  Considering the disadvantages inseparable from this part of my subject, I must be understood to have resolved to avoid them as much as possible, by throwing the force of my narrative upon the characters and passions of the actors;--those passions common to men in all stages of society, and which have alike agitated the human heart, whether it throbbed under the steel corselet of the fifteenth century, the brocaded coat of the eighteenth, or the blue frock and white dimity waistcoat of the present day. [Alas! that attire, respectable and gentlemanlike in 1805, or thereabouts, is now as antiquated as the Author of Waverley has himself become since that period! The reader of fashion will please to fill up the costume with an embroidered waistcoat of purple velvet or silk, and a coat of whatever colour he pleases.] Upon these passions it is no doubt true that the state of manners and laws casts a necessary colouring; but the bearings, to use the language of heraldry, remain the same, though the tincture may be not only different, but opposed in strong contradistinction. The wrath of our ancestors, for example, was coloured GULES; it broke forth in acts of open and sanguinary violence against the objects of its fury. Our malignant feelings, which must seek gratification through more indirect channels, and undermine the obstacles which they cannot openly bear down, may be rather said to be tinctured SABLE. But the deep-ruling impulse is the same in both cases; and the proud peer who can now only ruin his neighbour according to law, by protracted suits, is the genuine descendant of the baron who wrapped the castle of his competitor in flames, and knocked him on the head as he endeavoured to escape from the conflagration. It is from the great book of Nature, the same through a thousand editions, whether of black-letter, or wire-wove and hot-pressed, that I have venturously essayed to read a chapter to the public. Some favourable opportunities of contrast have been afforded me, by the state of society in the northern part of the island at the period of my history, and may serve at once to vary and to illustrate the moral lessons, which I would willingly consider as the most important part of my plan; although I am sensible how short these will fall of their aim, if I shall be found unable to mix them with amusement,--a task not quite so easy in this critical generation as it was 'Sixty Years since.'    CHAPTER II  WAVERLEY-HONOUR---A RETROSPECT  It is, then, sixty years since Edward Waverley, the hero of the following pages, took leave of his family, to join the regiment of dragoons in which he had lately obtained a commission. It was a melancholy day at Waverley-Honour when the young officer parted with Sir Everard, the affectionate old uncle to whose title and estate he was presumptive heir.  A difference in political opinions had early separated the Baronet from his younger brother, Richard Waverley, the father of our hero. Sir Everard had inherited from his sires the whole train of Tory or High-Church predilections and prejudices, which had distinguished the house of Waverley since the Great Civil War. Richard, on the contrary, who was ten years younger, beheld himself born to the fortune of a second brother, and anticipated neither dignity nor entertainment in sustaining the character of Will Wimble. He saw early, that, to succeed in the race of life, it was necessary he should carry as little weight as possible. Painters talk of the difficulty of expressing the existence of compound passions in the same features at the same moment: it would be no less difficult for the moralist to analyse the mixed motives which unite to form the impulse of our actions. Richard Waverley read and satisfied himself, from history and sound argument, that, in the words of the old song,       Passive obedience was a jest,      And pshaw!  was non-resistance;  yet reason would have probably been unable to combat and remove hereditary prejudice, could Richard have anticipated that his elder brother, Sir Everard, taking to heart an early disappointment, would have remained a batchelor at seventy-two. The prospect of succession, however remote, might in that case have led him to endure dragging through the greater part of his life as 'Master Richard at the Hall, the baronet's brother,' in the hope that ere its conclusion he should be distinguished as Sir Richard Waverley of Waverley-Honour, successor to a princely estate, and to extended political connexions as head of the county interest in the shire where it lay. But this was a consummation of things not to be expected at Richard's outset, when"]]]
