These delicate catarrhal children should be accustomed to light clothing on their beds. Chest protectors, mufflers, cotton pads, and heavy wraps of any description should be absolutely prohibited. It is advisable to use flannel underwear winter and summer, light in summer and a medium weight in winter. During the summer months the mother should begin cold sponging of the face, throat, chest, and spine every morning and carry it into the winter. The entire process need take only a moment or two. Always dry thoroughly with a fairly rough towel. If the cold sponging is begun in the warm summer time the child will become so accustomed to it that no objection will be made when the cold weather comes.  If the child continues to be \"catarrhal,\" despite a course of this treatment, it would be well to investigate whether any adenoids or adenoid tissue exist in the naso-pharynx. If adenoids are found no treatment will be successful until they are removed.  It is a wise plan to place a flannel cap on an infant who has an acute attack of \"cold in the head\" (snuffles). This will prevent catching a fresh cold and it will aid in the speedy cure of the attack from which it is suffering when it is put on.   CHRONIC NASAL CATARRH--CHRONIC RHINITIS CHRONIC DISCHARGE FROM THE NOSE  Some children have a nasal discharge during all of their childhood. It is usually worse during the winter months. It may be a thin, watery discharge or a thick, nasty, yellow discharge.  It is a condition that is very frequently neglected even by the family physician. This is unfortunate because it may lead to serious disease, permanent damage sometimes being done to the hearing, the speech, the smell, and to the lungs of the child.  It may be caused by adenoids; disease of the bones or tissues in the nose; foreign bodies in the nose; or it may occur in children whose nutrition is bad. It may result from frequent acute attacks of \"cold in the head.\" It also occurs in other less important conditions. The foreign bodies which usually cause a chronic nasal discharge are,--buttons, peas, beans, beads, paper balls, flies and bugs, cherry-stones, small pieces of coal, or stone, cork or other material. A child gets hold of a shoe-button for example and pushes it into its nostrils. In the effort to get it out the child pushes it further in. It may or may not cause pain at the time, and it may be overlooked, but shortly the mother will notice a discharge from one nostril. This discharge becomes thick and foul and when an investigation is made the button is found embedded firmly in the nose. It is sometimes quite difficult to get the button out and this should always be done by a physician.  Treatment.--Remove the cause first then treat the catarrh. If it is a product of a constitutional disease that causes general poor health, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, or scrofula, the child will need \"building up\" and a decided change of climate. Foreign bodies must be removed, adenoids taken out, large tonsils excised, and malformations of the nasal bones operated upon. The catarrh will in many cases be cured by removing its cause; if, however, it should persist it must be treated for some time with appropriate solutions. These solutions and the directions as to the method of giving them must be given by a physician, because there is great danger of carrying the disease to deeper structures if given wrongly.   SUMMARY:--  1st.--A chronic discharge from the nose is a sign that something is wrong and should be carefully and thoroughly investigated.  2nd.--The cause can usually be found out and the proper treatment will cure it.  3rd.--If the condition is neglected it may ruin the health of the child for the whole period of its life.   NERVOUS OR PERSISTENT COUGH  Cough in an infant or growing child is usually the result of a cold and the structure affected is some part of the nose, throat or bronchi. It is a comparatively simple matter to discover just where the trouble is and to prescribe the appropriate remedy and effect a cure.  There is another type of cough, however, that is of quite a different character. This cough will begin as an ordinary cough and it will only be discovered that it is not an ordinary cough because nothing will apparently cure it. We mean that the child is given cough remedies that usually cure a cold, is kept in the house and carefully watched for a sufficiently long period to justify a cure, and yet, despite this care and attention, the cough remains the same. The child is not sick, the appetite is good, there is no fever, it plays and seems to enjoy good health, yet for weeks and frequently for months the annoying cough hangs on. It is as a rule worse at night. It begins soon after the child falls asleep and spoils the entire night's rest or a great part of it. It may be a dry, hard, hacking cough, or a croupy, harsh bark. It may come in spells with a considerable interval between them, during which time the child falls asleep, or it may be almost constant, not quite severe enough to rouse the child, but bad enough to spoil the child's rest and the rest of the mother. If this condition lasts for a long time, as it occasionally does, the health of the little patient is apt to suffer from loss of sleep.  Treatment.--These children should be taken to a good physician and thoroughly examined. Special care should be devoted to investigating the condition of the nose, throat, ear, stomach, heart, and lungs.  A very large majority of these coughs are caused by adenoid growths in the back part of the nose. The child may not look like an adenoid child, nor may it breathe through its mouth when asleep, and it may have had its adenoids removed, yet in spite of these contra-indications it may have enough loose adenoid tissue in its nose to cause this kind of persistent cough. This has been proved many times.  It is not only useless but positively harmful to give these children cough remedies. The cause of the cough must be found and treated. The cough may be indirectly caused by anemia (poor blood) or heart or stomach trouble, or it may have a number of other causes. Whatever it is it must be found by a careful physical examination or a number of careful physical examinations, because these cases are as a rule obscure and difficult to diagnose, and even the most expert examiner cannot always tell where the trouble is without seeing the child a number of times. The parents must therefore have patience and confidence in the physician and must aid him all they can by watching and reporting all the symptoms, etc., to him. (See article on Adenoids).   SUMMARY:--  Coughs that resist careful treatment are not \"ordinary coughs.\"  Coughs of this type require special medical care.  The usual cough medicines are not only useless in these coughs, but dangerous. Don't give them.   ACUTE CATARRHAL LARYNGITIS: SPASMODIC CROUP: FALSE CROUP  Croup is one of the common diseases of childhood. It usually follows a catarrhal \"cold in the head\" with a cough. Croup is most frequently associated with large tonsils and adenoids. It may come on gradually or it may occur suddenly. There is always fever with croup. One of the first symptoms is a hard, dry, croupy, barking cough, which gets worse toward night. If it occurs suddenly, the child will wake about midnight with the characteristic croupy cough. The disease may go no further than this and under the proper treatment is well in a few days. In other cases, however, there develops marked interference with breathing. Every inspiration is accompanied by a loud hissing or \"crowing\" sound. This feature of the disease is one that frightens the parents, though it seldom means anything serious. The child sits up in bed, frightened, and struggles for breath. It may clutch its throat with its hands as if something was tied round its neck. The lips may become slightly blue and the perspiration appears upon the child's brow. After some time,--it may be two or three hours,--the attack wears away and the child goes to sleep. Next morning it wakes up apparently well except for the croupy cough. The attack may repeat itself the next night and mildly on the third night.  Treatment.--The object of treatment during an acute attack, when the child is struggling for breath, is to relax quickly the spasm of the larynx which interferes with the breathing. The simplest way is to give the child a teaspoonful of the fresh syrup of ipecac. If the child does not vomit in fifteen minutes, give another teaspoonful and keep on giving it every fifteen minutes till the child vomits. One or two doses is usually enough, but it must be given till the child vomits.  If the attack comes suddenly during the night and there is no syrup of ipecac in the house, the physician should be sent for at once and informed that the child probably has croup, so he may know what to take with him. While waiting for the physician the mother should apply over the front of the neck (in the region of Adam's apple), hot applications. These are best made of flannel wrung out of quite hot water every two or three minutes: also a hot mustard foot bath. When the physician takes charge of the case he will also direct the treatment for the following day in order that the attack of the next night may be a very mild one, if it should came at all.  Children who have a tendency to frequent attacks of croup should receive the same attention as the children do who are subject to attacks of tonsilitis and acute catarrhal rhinitis.   SUMMARY:--  1st. Spasmodic Croup always requires prompt and efficient treatment.  2nd. It is called \"false\" croup, because \"true\" croup is always diphtheritic and is a very serious disease.  3rd. For that reason a physician should always be called because if it is \"true\" croup antitoxin must be given at once.  4th. Don't worry unnecessarily because, though \"spasmodic croup\" can make the child look exceedingly sick for a very short time, an uncomplicated case in a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21426"],["title","The Tale of Daddy Longlegs (#1)"],["body","nd.  At least, everybody but Mr. Crow! Mr. Crow soon found that people were asking Daddy's advice on all sorts of questions (because they thought he was very old--and therefore very wise). And Mr. Crow at once became so jealous that he didn't know what to do. He began making unkind remarks about his new rival, saying that no matter how old a person might be, if he had a small head and eight long legs it was not reasonable to believe that he could have much of a brain. Whenever anybody mentioned Daddy's name, Mr. Crow would _haw-haw_ loudly and mutter something about \"old Spindley Legs!\"  Mr. Crow had spent many summers in Pleasant Valley. And during that time he had advised thousands of his neighbors. Indeed, he often boasted that if he had a kernel of corn for every bit of advice he had given away, he never would have to wonder where he was going to get his next meal.  When some friend of Mr. Crow's repeated that speech to Daddy Longlegs, he observed that Mr. Crow must be very wise.  \"No doubt----\" he added in his thin, quavering voice--\"no doubt Mr. Crow's help would be worth a kernel of corn to anybody who was in trouble. If his advice was good, no one would object to paying for it. And if it proved to be bad, no one would miss a kernel of corn.\"  It happened that Daddy Longlegs' comment soon reached the ears of old Mr. Crow. And it made that gentleman furious.  \"This is the first time anybody has suggested that my advice is not always first-class!\" he croaked. \"Here's this long-legged upstart interfering in my affairs. I must teach him a lesson!\" Mr. Crow declared.  Well, that very afternoon he challenged Daddy Longlegs to a contest.  \"I intend to prove,\" said Mr. Crow, \"that my advice is always good; and that yours is always bad.\"  \"Very well!\" Daddy Longlegs answered. \"But I advise you to go home at once, Mr. Crow. You're very hoarse. And I'm sure you ought to be in bed.\"  Now, the old gentleman was always hoarse. And since he disliked to have anyone mention his infirmity, his eyes snapped angrily.  \"I advise you----\" he roared----\"I advise you to keep your advice to yourself.\"  Of course that was a rude speech. But Daddy Longlegs did not take offense at it. He straightway told Mr. Crow that he ought to wear rubbers. And Mr. Crow was so enraged that he couldn't speak for as much as half an hour.  It was understood that the contest between Daddy and Mr. Crow would take place the following morning. And when that time came a big crowd had gathered upon the stone wall to see the fun.     IV  THE CONTEST   \"MY cousin, Jasper Jay, has kindly consented to ask us some questions,\" Mr. Crow informed Daddy Longlegs. \"And he will decide which of us makes the wiser answers.\"  Buster Bumblebee, who was watching and listening, said:  \"That's hardly fair, it seems to me.\"  But old Mr. Crow quickly told him that he was a stupid fellow and that he'd better keep still. And since a good many other people had frequently said the same thing to that young gentleman, Buster began to think there might be some truth in it. So he said nothing more.  Meanwhile Daddy Longlegs beamed upon all the company. And Mr. Crow looked at him out of the corner of his eye. Then he said to Daddy, \"I suppose you've no objection to this plan?\"  \"It suits me very well,\" Daddy replied.  \"I thought it would,\" said old Mr. Crow with a smirk. And turning to his cousin, Jasper Jay, he remarked in a low voice that Daddy Longlegs was even duller than he had imagined.  Then Jasper Jay announced that he would put the first question. And after he had heard Mr. Crow's opinion he would listen to Daddy Longlegs'.  \"When is the best time to plant corn?\" Jasper then asked Mr. Crow, while the whole company craned their necks and strained their ears--for of course they didn't want to miss anything.  Mr. Crow made no answer for a few moments. He appeared to be thinking deeply. But at last he looked up and said:  \"The best time to plant corn is as early as possible.\"  A good many of those present exclaimed at once that that was a good answer. And a few clapped their hands.  \"What's your opinion?\" Jasper Jay then asked, turning to Daddy Longlegs.  Daddy Longlegs took off his hat, mopped his narrow forehead with his red bandanna, and then slowly nodded his head three times.  \"My answer is exactly the same as Mr. Crow's,\" he piped in his queer, thin, high voice.  At that a look of displeasure passed quickly over the faces of the two cousins. And when little Mr. Chippy called on Jasper Jay to decide which was the better answer, Jasper looked really worried.  \"It's a tie this time,\" he said somewhat sourly. And while everybody was shouting, he and Mr. Crow withdrew to one side and whispered, which some considered to be rather bad manners.  Soon Jasper and Mr. Crow returned to the eager throng. And Jasper now looked as brazen as ever.  \"I'll put the next question,\" he announced. \"And Daddy Longlegs may answer first.... How many kernels of corn make a meal!\"  There wasn't a sound--except for Buster Bumblebee's buzzing--as Daddy Longlegs moved forward a few steps and held his hand behind his ear.  \"Speak louder!\" somebody said to Jasper. \"You know he's hard of hearing.\"  So Jasper Jay repeated the question. But Daddy Longlegs only looked at him blankly.  It was quite clear that he couldn't understand a single word that Jasper said.     IV  TOO MANY QUESTIONS   \"THIS is strange!\" old Mr. Crow exclaimed, looking very hard at Daddy Longlegs. \"You heard the first question easily enough. But now you seem deaf as a post.\"  And all the time Daddy Longlegs merely smiled at Mr. Crow. He made no comment at all.  \"Don't you know what I'm saying?\" Mr. Crow bawled in his loudest tones.  \"It _is_ a pleasant day,\" said Daddy Longlegs. \"But I'm afraid there's going to be a heavy gale to-morrow.\"  \"This is certainly peculiar,\" Mr. Crow grumbled. And then little Mr. Chippy hastened to explain that Daddy Longlegs was often like that. He would appear to hear you perfectly one moment. And then--if you happened to ask him his age, or where he came from--you might find him unable to understand a single word that you said.  \"It's most unfortunate,\" said old Mr. Crow. \"I see nothing to do but reply to the question myself. And then my cousin, Jasper Jay, will decide which has given the better answer--Daddy Longlegs or I.\"  \"Ah! But you can't do that!\" cried Daddy Longlegs suddenly. \"Jasper Jay said you were not to answer this question until after I had. And you know you mustn't break the rules of the contest.\"  Old Mr. Crow's mouth fell open, he was so astonished.  \"Why, he can hear again!\" he exclaimed. And after staring at Daddy Longlegs for a while he beckoned to Jasper Jay. And again the two cousins moved a little distance away and began whispering.  When they returned both were smiling broadly. And mounting the stone wall once more, Jasper said that he would put another question to Daddy and Mr. Crow, and that they must both answer it at the same time. Then he cautioned Daddy Longlegs to speak up good and loud, because Mr. Crow had a strong voice.  \"I'd suggest----\" said Daddy Longlegs----\"I'd suggest that Mr. Crow speak as softly as possible, because my voice is weak.\"  \"That's only fair!\" all the company agreed, nodding their heads to one another. But Mr. Crow appeared peevish.  \"Everybody's against me,\" he grumbled. \"I almost believe----\" he said, turning to his cousin----\"I almost believe they're all in league with Farmer Green.\"  \"If you are not sure, why don't you ask Farmer Green himself?\" Daddy Longlegs inquired.  \"I will!\" cried Mr. Crow in a loud voice. \"I'll ask him the next time I see him.\"  \"Then you can ask him now,\" said Daddy Longlegs, \"for here he comes, with a gun on his shoulder.\"  The words were hardly out of Daddy's mouth when old Mr. Crow began to beat the air furiously with his broad wings. He rose quickly--but not too high--and made for the woods as fast as he could fly.  \"Now, that's strange!\" Daddy Longlegs quavered. \"I don't see how he's going to talk with Farmer Green when he's half a mile away from him.\"  And everybody else said the same thing.  \"He's gone off and left the contest unfinished,\" little Mr. Chippy observed. \"So there's nothing Jasper Jay can do except to declare that Daddy Longlegs is the winner--and the wisest person in Pleasant Valley.\"  \"I couldn't very well do that,\" Jasper objected. \"You're forgetting Solomon Owl.\"  \"Well, Daddy's wiser than old Mr. Crow, anyhow,\" Mr. Chippy retorted. And since almost everybody said that was true, Jasper Jay didn't quite dare object.  But it was plain that he didn't agree with the company. And he stamped his feet and clashed his bill together and shook his head as if he were much displeased.  He, too, began to believe--with his cousin, Mr. Crow--that Daddy Longlegs and all the others were on Farmer Green's side.     VI  MRS. LADYBUG'S PLAN   DADDY LONGLEGS' neighbors took an even greater interest in him, after his contest with Mr. Crow. And much to Daddy's distress they tried harder than before to pry into his private affairs.  But those curious busybodies learned very little. In fact there was only one of them who really found out anything about Daddy that was worth knowing.  Little Mrs. Ladybug, who was somewhat of a gossip, discovered in some way that Daddy Longlegs was a harvestman. And she lost no time in spreading the news far and wide. She even travelled as far as the big poplar, to tell Whiteface, the Carpenter Bee, what she had heard.  \"A harvestman, eh?\" said the Carpenter, thrusting his hands into the pockets of his apron. \"If that's so, why doesn't he go to work?\" And without waiting for an answer he dodged quickly inside his house. He was building an addition to his home; and naturally he was quite busy. He knew, too, that Mrs. Ladybug was a terrible talker.  \"I declare, I hadn't thought of that!\" Mrs. Ladybug exclaimed. And then she hastened to the stone wall to find Daddy Longlegs and learn the"]]]
