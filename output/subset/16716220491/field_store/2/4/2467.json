[Illustration]    OUR LITTLE PAT     Our little Pat   Was chasing the cat   And kicking the kittens about.   When mother said \"Quit!\"   He ran off to sit   On the top of the woodpile and pout;   But a sly little grin   Soon slid down his chin   And let all the sulkiness out.       THE ANIMAL SHOW     Father and mother and Bobbie will go   To see all the sights at the animal show.   Where lions and bears   Sit on dining room chairs,   Where a camel is able   To stand on a table,   Where monkeys and seals   All travel on wheels,   And a Zulu baboon   Rides a baby balloon.   The sooner you're ready, the sooner we'll go.   Aboard, all aboard, for the Animal Show!    [Illustration: THE ANIMAL SHOW]       TOMMY TRIMBLE     Billy be nimble,   Hurry and see   Old Tommy Trimble   Climbing a tree.   He claws with his fingers   And digs with his toes.   The longer he lingers   The slower he goes.       [Illustration]    DICKIE, DICKIE DEXTER     Dickie, Dickie Dexter   Had a wife and vexed her.   She put him in a rabbit cage   And fed him peppermint and sage--   Dickie, Dickie Dexter.       ON THE ROAD TO TATTLETOWN     On the road to Tattletown   What is this I see?   A pig upon a pedestal,   A cabbage up a tree,   A rabbit cutting capers   With a twenty dollar bill--   Now if I don't get to Tattletown   Then no one ever will.       POLLY AND PETER     Polly had some china cows   And Peter had a gun.   She turned the bossies out to browse,   And Peterkin, for fun,   Just peppered them with butter beans   And blew them all to smithereens.           *       *       *    Now what will pretty Polly do   For milk and cream and butter too?       I WENT TO TOWN ON MONDAY     I went to town on Monday   To buy myself a coat,   But on the way I met a man   Who traveled with a caravan,   And bought a billy-goat.    I went to town on Tuesday   And bought a fancy vest.   I kept the pretty bucklestraps,   Buttonholes and pocketflaps,   And threw away the rest.    [Illustration]    I went to town on Thursday   To buy a loaf of bread,   But when I got there, goodness sakes!   The town was full of rattlesnakes--   The bakers all were dead.    [Illustration]    I went to town on Saturday   To get myself a wife,   But when I saw the lady fair   I gnashed my teeth and pulled my hair   And scampered for my life.       [Illustration]    WHERE ARE YOU GOING?     Where are you going, sister Kate?   I'm going to swing on the garden gate,   And watch the fairy gypsies dance   Their tim-tam-tum on the cabbage-plants--   The great big one with the purple nose,   And the tiny tad with the pinky toes.    Where are you going, brother Ben?   I'm going to build a tiger-pen.   I'll get iron and steel and 'lectric wire   And build it a hundred feet, or higher,   And put ten tigers in it too,   And a big wildcat, and--mebbe--you.    [Illustration]    Where are you going, mother mine?   I'm going to sit by the old grapevine,   And watch the gliding swallow bring   Clay for her nest from the meadow spring--   Clay and straw and a bit of thread   To weave it into a baby's bed.    [Illustration]    Where are you going, grandma dear?   I'm going, love, where the skies are clear,   And the light winds lift the poppy flowers   And gather clouds for the summer showers,   Where the old folks and the children play   On the warm hillside through the livelong day.       CHRISTOPHER CRUMP     Christopher Crump,   All in a lump,   Sits like a toad on the top of a stump.   He stretches and sighs,   And blinks with his eyes,   Bats at the beetles and fights off the flies.       [Illustration]    PINKY, PINKY, PANG     A tortoise sat on a slippery limb   And played his pinky pang   For a dog-fish friend that called on him,   And this is what he sang:   \"Oh, the skies are blue,   And I wait for you   To come where the willows hang,   And dance all night   By the white moonlight   To my pinky, pinky, pang!\"       TICK, TOCK     Tick, tock! Tick, tock!   Forty 'leven by the clock.   Tick, tock! Tick, tock!   Put your ear to Grandpa's ticker,   Like a pancake, only thicker.   Tick, tock! Tick, tock!   Catch a squirrel in half a minute,   Grab a sack and stick him in it.   Tick, tock! Tick, tock!   Mister Bunny feeds on honey,   Tea, and taters--ain't it funny?   Tick, tock! Tick, tock!   When he goes to bed at night,   Shoves his slippers out of sight;   That is why Old Fox, the sinner,   Had to go without his dinner.   Tick, tock! Tick, tock!   So says Grandpa's clock.    [Illustration: TICK, TOCK! TICK, TOCK! FORTY 'LEVEN BY THE CLOCK]       [Illustration]    UNDER THE WILLOW     Put down your pillow under the willow,   Hang up your hat in the sun,   And lie down to snooze as long as you choose,   For the plowing and sowing are done.    Pick up your pillow from under the willow,   And clamber out into the sun.   Get a fork and a rake for goodness' sake,   For the harvest time has begun.       HIGH ON THE MANTEL     High on the mantel rose a moan--   It came from an idol carved in bone--   \"Oh, it's so lonesome here alone,   With no one near to love me!\"    A cautious smile came over the face   Of a pensive maid on a Grecian vase   \"Are you sure,\" she said, with charming grace,   \"There's no one near to love you?\"    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    BOOTS, BOOTS, BOOTS     Buster's got a popper gun,   A reg'lar one that shoots,   And Teddy's got an engine   With a whistler that toots.   But I've got something finer yet--   A pair of rubber boots.   Oh, it's boots, boots, boots,   A pair of rubber boots!   I could walk from here to China   In a pair of rubber boots.       [Illustration]    BUTTERFLY     Butterfly, butterfly,   Sit on my chin,   Your wings are like tinsel,   So yellow and thin.    Butterfly, butterfly,   Give me a kiss;   If you give me a dozen   There's nothing amiss.    Butterfly, butterfly,   Off to the flowers,--   Wee, soulless sprite   Of the long summer hours.       BEELA BY THE SEA     Catch a floater, catch an eel,   Catch a lazy whale,   Catch an oyster by the heel   And put him in a pail.    There's lots of work for Uncle Ike,   Fatty Ford and me   All day long and half the night   At Beela by the sea.    [Illustration]       A MATTER OF TASTE     \"Thank you, dear,\" said the big black ant,   \"I'd like to go home with you now, but I can't.   I have to hurry and milk my cows--   The aphid herds on the aster boughs.\"   And the ladybug said: \"No doubt it's fine,   This milk you get from your curious kine,   But you know quite well it's my belief   Your cows are best when turned to beef.\"       TOMMY, MY SON     \"Tommy, my son,\" said the old tabby cat,   \"Go catch us some mice, and be sure that they're fat.   There's one family lives in the carpenter's barn;   They've made them a nest of the old lady's yarn.   But the carpenter has a young cat of his own   That is healthy and proud and almost full grown,   And consider it, son, an eternal disgrace   To come home at night with a scratch on your face.\"    [Illustration]       OH, SAID THE WORM     \"Oh,\" said the worm,   \"I'm awfully tired of sitting in the trees;   I want to be a butterfly   And chase the bumblebees.\"       [Illustration]    BUZZY BROWN     Buzzy Brown came home from town   As crazy as a loon,   He wore a purple overcoat   And sang a Sunday tune.    Buzzy Brown came home from town   As proud as he could be,   He found three doughnuts and a bun   A-growing on a tree.       THE WIND     The wind came a-whooping, down Cranberry Hill   And stole an umbrella from, Mother Medill.    It picked up a paper on Patterson's place   And carried it clean to the Rockaby Race.    And what was more shocking and awful than that,   It blew the new feather off grandmother's hat.    [Illustration: THE WIND CAME A-WHOOPING DOWN CRANBERRY HILL]       THE HOBO BAND     The roads are good and the weather's grand,   So I'm off to play in the Hobo Band;   With a gaspipe flute and a cowhide drum   I'm going to make the music come.   With a toot, toot, toot, and a dum, dum, dum,   Just hear me make the music come!       [Illustration]    A BEETLE ON A BROOMSTRAW     A robin and a wren, as they walked along one night,   Saw a big brown beetle on a broomstraw.   Said the robin to the wren: \"What a pretty, pretty sight--   That big brown beetle on a broomstraw!\"   So they got their plates and knives,   Their children and their wives,   And gobbled up the beetle on the broomstraw.       MULE THOUGHTS     A silly little mule   Sat on a milking stool   And tried to write a letter to his father.   But he couldn't find the ink,   So he said: \"I rather think   This writing letters home is too much bother.\"    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    A CANDLE, A CANDLE     A candle, a candle   To light me to bed;   A pillow, a pillow   To tuck up my head.   The moon is as sleepy as sleepy can be,   The stars are all pointing their fingers at me,   And Missus Hop-Robin, way up in her nest,   Is rocking her tired little babies to rest.   So give me a blanket   To tuck up my toes,   And a little soft pillow   To snuggle my nose.       [Illustration]    BAXTER     Baxter had a billy-goat   Wall-eyed and double jointed.   He took him to the barber shop   And had his head anointed.       LODDY, GIN, AND ELLA ZANDER     Loddy, Gin, and Ella Zander   Rode to market on a gander;   Bought a crane for half a dollar;   Loddy led him by the collar.    Mister Crane said: \"Hi there, master,   Can't you make your legs work faster?   We can't poke along this way.\"   Then he slowly flew away.   Loddy held him fast, you bet,   And he hasn't come home yet.       AS I WAS GOING DOWN THE HILL     As I was going down the hill   In front of Missus Knapp's   I saw the little Knapperines   All in their winter wraps--   Purple mitts and mufflers   And knitted jersey caps.    As I was coming back again   In front of Missus Knapp's   I saw that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22014"],["title","The Peter Patter Book of Nursery Rhymes (#2)"],["body","lady   Give about a dozen slaps   To every little Knapperine--   I thought it was, perhaps,   Because they gathered stickers   In their knitted jersey caps.    [Illustration: GOING DOWN THE HILL IN FRONT OF MRS. KNAPP'S]       [Illustration]    A LITTLE BOY RAN TO THE END OF THE SKY     A little boy ran to the end of the sky   With a rag and a pole and a gooseberry pie.   He cried: \"Three cheers for the Fourth of July!\"   With a rag and a pole and a gooseberry pie.    He saw three little donkeys at play,   He tickled their noses to make them bray,   And he didn't come back until Christmas Day--   With a rag and a pole and a gooseberry pie.       DISCRETION     A man with a nickel,   A sword, and a sickle,   A pipe, and a paper of pins   Set out for the Niger   To capture a tiger--   And that's how my story begins.    When he saw the wide ocean,   He soon took a notion   'T would be nicer to stay with his friends.   So he traded his hat   For a tortoise-shell cat--   And that's how the chronicle ends.    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    A BEETLE ONCE SAT ON A BARBERRY TWIG     A beetle once sat on a barberry twig,   And turned at the crank of a thingum-a-jig.   Needles for hornets, nippers for ants,   For the bumblebee baby a new pair of pants,   For the grizzled old gopher a hat and a wig,   The beetle ground out of his thingum-a-jig.       [Illustration]    THE THIEVES     Tibbitts and Bibbitts and Solomon Sly   Ran off one day with a cucumber pie.   Tibbitts was tossed by a Kensington cow,   Bibbitts was hanged on a brambleweed bough,   And poor little Solomon--what do you think?   Was drowned one dark night in a bottle of ink.       UPON THE IRISH SEA     Some one told Maria Ann,   Maria Ann told me,   That kittens ride in coffee cans   Upon the Irish Sea.    From quiet caves to rolling waves,   How jolly it must be   To travel in a coffee can   Upon the Irish Sea!    But when it snows and when it blows,   How would you like to be   A kitten in a coffee can   Upon the Irish Sea?       DUCKLE, DAISY     Duckle, duckle, daisy,   Martha must be crazy,   She went and made a Christmas cake   Of olive oil and gluten-flake,   And set it in the sink to bake,   Duckle, duckle, daisy.    [Illustration: DUCKLE, DUCKLE, DAISY]       [Illustration]    I'VE GOT A NEW BOOK     I've got a new book from my Grandfather Hyde.   It's skin on the cover and paper inside,   And reads about Arabs and horses and slaves,   And tells how the Caliph of Bagdad behaves.   I'd not take a goat and a dollar beside   For the book that I got from my Grandfather Hyde.       THE CARROT AND THE RABBIT     A carrot in a garden   And a rabbit in the wood.   Said the rabbit, \"Beg your pardon,   But you're surely meant for food;   Though you've started in to harden,   You may still be very good.\"       HIPPY-HI-HOPPY     Hippy-Hi-Hoppy, the big fat toad,   Greeted his friends at a turn of the road.    Said he to the snail:   \"Here's a ring for your tail   If you'll go into town for my afternoon mail.\"    Said he to the rat:   \"I have talked with the cat;   And she'll nab you so quick you won't know where you're at.\"    Said he to the lizard:   \"I'm really no wizard,   But I'll show you a trick that will tickle your gizzard.\"    Said he to the lark:   \"When it gets fairly dark   We'll chase the mosquitoes in Peek-a-Boo Park.\"    Said he to the owl:   \"If it were not for your scowl   I'd like you as well as most any wild fowl.\"    Said he to the wren:   \"You're tiny, but then   I'll marry you quick, if you'll only say when.\"    [Illustration]       [Illustration: I'LL TREAT THE CLOWN]    UP ON THE GARDEN GATE     Set me up on the garden gate   And put on my Sunday tie;   I want to be there   With a round-eyed stare   When the circus band goes by.    Give me a bag of suckerettes   And give me a piece of gum,   Then I'll get down   And treat the clown,   And give the monkey some.       'MOST ANY CHIP     'Most any chip   Will do for a ship,   If only the cargo be   Golden sand   From the beautiful land   Of far-off Arcady.   For faith will waft   The tiny craft   O'er Fancy's shining sea.       [Illustration]    A MOON SONG     Who hung his hat on the moon?   The owl in his bubble balloon.   One bright summer night   He sailed out of sight,   And, hooting like Lucifer, hung in delight   His three-cornered hat on the moon.       WHAT MAKES YOU LAUGH?     \"What makes you laugh, my little lass,   From morning until noon?\"   \"I saw a dappled donkey   Throwing kisses at the moon.\"    [Illustration]    \"What makes you cry, my little lass,   And get your eyes so red?\"   \"I saw a cruel gardener cut   A poor old cabbage head.\"    [Illustration]    \"What makes you run, my little lass?   You're almost out of breath.\"   \"A pumpkin made a face at me,   And scared me half to death.\"       TIMMY O'TOOLE     When Timmy O'Toole   Was going to school   He picked up a package of gum.   He treated the preacher   And Sunday-school teacher,   And gave a policeman some.       A MAN CAME FROM MALDEN     A man came from Malden to buy a blue goose.   And what became of the gander?   He went and got tipsy on blackberry juice,   And that was the end of the gander.       BARON BATTEROFF     The mighty baron, Batteroff,   Raised a whale in a watering trough.   When the whale grew large and fat   He ate the baron's brindle cat.   But pussy, once inside the whale,   Began to tickle with her tail.   This the monster could not stand,   And spewed her out upon dry land.   That night, when all was fine as silk   And she had supped her bread and milk,   She grinned and told old Batteroff   How she got the whale to cough.       SIX LITTLE SALMON     I sing a funny song from away out west,   Of six little salmon with their hats on;   How they all left home--but I forget the rest--   The six little salmon with their hats on.    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    TO GARRY ON THE TOOT-TOOT     Oh, I want to go to Garry   On the toot-toot, toot-toot,   You and I together   On the toot-toot, toot-toot.   Go run and ask your mother   For some kind of cake or other,   And a bit of cotton wadding   For your ball-suit.   Get your bobber and a bat,   And be back as quick as scat,   For we've got to go to Garry   On the toot-toot.       DOUBBLEDOON     Bobbin rode a rocking-horse   'Way down to Doubbledoon,   He told his little sister   He'd be back that afternoon.   But maybe after all she didn't   Understand him right,   For he wasn't back again   Till the middle of the night.    And what did little Bobbin see   'Way down at Doubbledoon?   He saw a crazy Arab   Throwing bubbles at the moon,   A monkey making faces   And a rabbit in a rage,   A parrot shouting \"Murder!\"   From the ceiling of his cage.    At last a yellow jumping-jack,   A camel, and a coon,   Chased poor little Bobbin   All the way from Doubbledoon.    [Illustration: BOBBIN RODE A ROCKING-HORSE TO DOUBBLEDOON]       [Illustration]    THE PARTY     Billy Bluebird had a party   In an elder tree,   But the little black-eyed smarty   Didn't ask us to his party   Neither you nor me.    This is what they had for dinner,   For I peeked to see:   Apple seeds and beetle finner,   And for drink the little sinner   Gave them tansy tea.    But there came an awful clatter   From that elder tree,   When he served them on a platter   Hopper-hash and brick-dust batter   Trimmed with celery!    All the folks were hale and hearty,   Happy as could be;   And that little black-eyed smarty   Left out of his funny party   Only you and me.    [Illustration]       [Illustration]    I'VE GOT A YELLOW PUPPY     I've got a yellow puppy,   And I've got a speckled hen,   I've got a lot of little   Spotted piggies in a pen.   I've got a gun that used to shoot,   Another one that squirts,   I've got some horehound candy   And a pair of woolen shirts.   I've got a little rubber ball   They use for playing golf,   And mamma thinks that's maybe why   I've got the whooping-cough.       [Illustration: DOCTOR McSWATTLE FILLED UP A BOTTLE]    DOCTOR McSWATTLE     Doctor McSwattle   Filled up a bottle   With vinegar, varnish, and rum.   And offered a swallow   To all who would follow   The call of his trumpet and drum.   It's good, I am told,   For a cough or a cold;   It's good for a pain in your thumb.       COLUMBUS     Columbus sailed over the ocean blue   To find the United States.   In three small ships he carried his crew,   And none of the three were mates.    He found a land in the western seas,   And Indians galore,   With jabbering parrots in the trees,   And sharks along the shore.    [Illustration]    He filled his pockets with sparkling stones   And took to the mighty main,   With a couple of slaves, some nuts and cones   For the glorious king of Spain.    Now this is the tale Columbus told,   And most of the tale is true,   How he crossed the seas, a sailor bold,   In fourteen-ninety-two.       [Illustration]    TERRIBLE TIM     Haven't you heard of Terrible Tim!   Well, don't you get in the way of him.   He eats lions for breakfast   And leopards for lunch,   And gobbles them down   With one terrible crunch.   He could mix a whole city   All up in a mess,   He could drink up a sea   Or an ocean, I guess.   You'd better be watching for Terrible Tim,   And run when you first get your peepers on him.       WHAT'S THE USE?     \"What's the use,\"   Said the goose,   \"To swim like a frog,   When you go just as far   If you float on a log?\"    \"Why should I,\"   Said the fly,   \"Suck an old apple-core,   When there's sugar and fruit   In the grocery store?\"    \"It's but right,\"   Said the kite,   \"That I follow the wind.   What's a fellow to do   If he hasn't a mind?\"    \"You'll allow,\"   Said the cow,   \"That I'm really no thief,   When I turn all the clover   I steal, into beef.\"    \"Come again,\"   Said the hen,   \"On some other fine day.   Don't think 'cause I cackle   I always must lay.\"       ALL ABOARD FOR BOMBAY     All aboard for Bombay,"]]]
