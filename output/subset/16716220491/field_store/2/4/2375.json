For many minutes he stood entranced, his mind wandering in a species of calm delight over the grand scene, but incapable of fixing itself definitely on any special feature--now sweeping out to where the Scilly Isles could be seen resting on the liquid horizon, anon following the flight of circling seagulls, or busy counting the innumerable ships and boats that rested on the sea, but ever and anon recurring, as if under the influence of fascination, to that rich turmoil of foam which boiled, leaped, and churned, around, beneath, and above the mighty breakers.  Awaking at last from his trance, Oliver tore himself from the spot, and hastened away to seek the nearest strip of sand where he might throw off his clothes and plunge into the boiling surf.  He proceeded in a southerly direction, impatiently expecting at every step to discover some spot suitable for his purpose, but he had taken a long and rapid walk before he found a break in those wild cliffs which afforded him the opportunity of descending to the water's edge.  Here, on a narrow strip of sand, he undressed and leaped into the waves.  Well was it for Oliver that day that he had been trained in all manly exercises, that his \"wind\" was good, that his muscles were hard, his nerves well strung, and, above all, that in earliest youth he had learned to swim.  Misjudging, in his ignorance, the tremendous power of the surf into which he sprang, and daring to recklessness in the conscious possession of unusual strength and courage, he did not pause to look or consider, but at once struck out to sea.  He was soon beyond the influence of the breaking waves, and for some time sported in the full enjoyment of the briny Atlantic waters.  Then turning towards the shore he swam in and was speedily tossing among the breakers.  As he neared the sandy beach and felt the full power of the water on his partially exhausted frame, he experienced a slight feeling of anxiety, for the thunder of each wave as it fell and rushed up before him in seething foam, seemed to indicate a degree of force which he had not realised in his first vigorous plunge into the sea.  A moment more and a wave caught him in its curling crest, and swept him onwards.  For the first time in his life, Oliver Trembath's massive strength was of no avail to him.  He felt like a helpless infant.  In another instant the breaker fell and swept him with irresistible violence up the beach amid a turmoil of hissing foam.  No sooner did he touch the ground than he sprang to his feet, and staggered forward a few paces but the returning rush of water swept sand and stones from beneath his feet, carried his legs from under him, and hurled him back into the hollow of the succeeding wave, which again rolled him on the sand.  Although somewhat stunned, Oliver did not lose consciousness or self-possession.  He now fully realised the extreme danger of his position, and the thought flashed through his brain that, at the farthest, his fate must be decided in two or three minutes.  Acting on a brave spirit, this thought nerved him to desperate effort.  The instant he could plant his feet firmly he bounded forwards, and then, before the backward rush of water had gathered strength, fell on his knees, and dug his fingers and toes deep into the sand.  Had the grasp been on something firm he could easily have held on, but the treacherous sand crumbled out of his grasp, and a second time he was carried back into the sea.  The next time he was cast on the beach he felt that his strength was failing; he staggered forward as soon as he touched bottom, with all the energy of one who avails himself of his last chance, but the angry water was too strong for him.  Feeling that he was being overpowered, he cast his arms up in the air, and gave utterance to a loud cry.  It was not like a cry of despair, but sounded more like what one might suppose would be the shout of a brave soldier when compelled to give way-- fighting--before the might of overwhelming force.  At that moment a hand caught the young man's wrist, and held it for a few seconds in a powerful grasp.  The wave retreated, a staggering effort followed, and the next moment Oliver stood panting on the beach grasping the rough hand of his deliverer.  \"Semen to me you was pretty nigh gone, sur,\" said the man, who had come thus opportunely to the rescue, as he wrung the sea-water from his garments.  He was a man of middle height, but of extremely powerful frame, and was habited in the garb of a fisherman.  \"Truly I had been gone altogether but for your timely assistance; may God reward you for it!\" said Oliver earnestly.  \"Well, I don't think you would be so ready to thank me if you did knaw I had half made up my mind to lev 'ee go.\"  Oliver looked at the man in some surprise, for he spoke gruffly, almost angrily, and was evidently in earnest.  \"You are jesting,\" said he incredulously.  \"Jestin'; no I ain't, maister.  Do 'ee see the boat out over?\" he said, pointing to a small craft full of men which was being rowed swiftly round a point not more than half a mile distant; \"the villains are after me.  They might as well have tried to kitch a cunger by the tail as nab Jim Cuttance in one of his dens, if he hadn't bin forced by the softness of his 'art to pull a young fool out o' the say.  You'll have to help me to fight, lad, as I've saved your life.  Come, follow me to the cave.\"  \"But--my clothes--\" said Oliver, glancing round him in search of his garments.  \"They're all safe up here; come along, sur, an' look sharp.\"  At any other time, and in other circumstances, Oliver Trembath's fiery spirit would have resented the tone and manner of this man's address, but the feeling that he owed his life to him, and that in some way he appeared to be the innocent cause of bringing misfortune on him, induced him to restrain his feelings and obey without question the mandate of his rescuer.  Jim Cuttance led the way to a cave in the rugged cliffs, the low entrance to which was concealed by a huge mass of granite.  The moment they entered several voices burst forth in abuse of the fisherman for his folly in exposing himself; but the latter only replied with a sarcastic laugh, and advised his comrades to get ready for action, for he had been seen by the enemy, who would be down on them directly.  At the same time he pointed to Oliver's clothes, which lay in a recess in the side of the cavern.  The youth dressed himself rapidly, and, while thus engaged, observed that there were five men in the cavern, besides his guide, with whom they retired into the farthest recess of the place, and entered into animated and apparently angry, though low-toned, conversation.  At length their leader, for such he evidently was, swung away from them, exclaiming, with a laugh, \"Well, well, he's a good recruit, and if he should peach on we--us can--\"  He concluded the sentence with a significant grunt.  \"Now, sur,\" he said, advancing with his comrade towards Oliver, who was completing his toilet, \"they'll be here in ten minutes, an' it is expected that you will lend we a hand.  Here's a weapon for you.\"  So saying, he handed a large pistol to Oliver, who received it with some hesitation.  \"I trust that your cause is a good one,\" he said.  \"You cannot expect me to fight for you, even though I am indebted to you for my life, without knowing against whom I fight, and why.\"  At this a tall thick-set man suddenly cocked his pistol, and uttering a fierce oath swore that if the stranger would not fight, he'd shoot him through the head.  \"Silence, Joe Tonkin!\" cried Jim Cuttance, in a tone that at once subdued the man.  Oliver, whose eyes had flashed like those of a tiger, drew himself up, and said--\"Look at me, lads; I have no desire to boast of what I can or will do, but I assure you it would be as easy to turn back the rising tide as to force me to fight against my will--except, indeed, with yourselves.  As I have said, I owe my life to your leader, and apparently have been the innocent means of drawing his enemies upon him. Gratitude tells me to help him if I can, and help him will if the cause be not a bad one.\"  \"Well spoken, sur,\" said the leader, with an approving nod; \"see to the weapons, Maggot, and I'll explain it all to the gentleman.\"  So saying, he too Oliver aside, told him hurriedly that the men who ere expected to attack them were fishermen belonging to a neighbouring cove, whose mackerel nets had been accidentally cut by his boat some weeks ago, and who were bent on revenge, not believing that the thing had been done by accident.  \"But surely you don't mean to use fire-arms against them in such a quarrel?\" said Oliver.  A sort of humorous smile crossed the swarthy countenance of the man as he replied--  \"They will use pistols against we.\"  \"Be that as it may,\" said Oliver; \"I will never consent to risk taking the life of a countryman in such a cause.\"  \"But you can't fight without a weapon,\" said the man; \"and sure, if 'ee don't shut them they'll shut you.\"  \"No matter, I'll take my chance,\" said Oliver; \"my good cudgel would have served me well enough, but it seems to have been swept away by the sea.  Here, however, is a weapon that will suit me admirably,\" he added, picking up a heavy piece of driftwood that lay at his feet.  \"Well, if you scat their heads with that, they won't want powder and lead,\" observed the other with a grin, as he rose and returned to the entrance of the cave, where he warned his comrades to keep as quiet as mice.  The boat which had caused so much angry discussion among the men of the cave had by this time neared the beach, and one of the crew stood up in the bow to guide her into the narrow cove, which formed but a slight protection, even in calm weather, against the violence of that surf which never ceases to grind at the hard rocks of West Cornwall.  At length they effected a landing, and the crew,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21727"],["title","Digging for Gold: Adventures in California (#1)"],["body","in a totally new scene and under widely different circumstances--seated near a magnificent tree of which he is making a study, and clad in a white linen coat and pantaloons and a broad-brimmed straw hat.  Just the day before, the \"House\" to which he had been sent had failed. Two years had he spent in grinding at its account books, perched on a three-legged stool, and now he found himself suddenly cast loose on the world.  Of course when the stool was knocked from under him his salary was stopped, and he was told by his employers that it would be necessary for him to go elsewhere to earn a subsistence.  This was rather a startling piece of advice, and for a time Frank felt much depressed, but on returning to his lodgings, the day he received his dismissal, his eye fell on his palette and brushes, which he at once seized, and, hastening out to his favourite tree, was soon so thoroughly absorbed in the study of \"nature\" that his sorrows vanished like morning mist.  After three hours' steady work he arose refreshed in soul and comforted.  Thereafter he returned to his lodgings and sat down to think over his prospects.  His cogitations were temporarily interrupted, and afterwards materially assisted, by a short thick-set man of about thirty years of age who entered with a deferential air, and pulled his forelock.  \"Come in, Joe.  I was just thinking over my future plans, and I daresay you can assist me, being, I suppose, in the same fix with myself.\"  Joe Graddy had been a porter in the \"House\" which had failed, and was indeed in the \"same fix,\" as Frank said, with himself.  \"I've comed, sir,\" said Joe, \"to ax yer advice, an' to offer ye my sarvice, it it's of any use,\" said the porter, who was a shrewd straightforward man, and had originally been a sailor.  \"If you had come to offer me advice and ask my services,\" said Frank, \"I would have been better pleased to see you.  However, sit down and let me hear what you have to say.\"  \"Well, sir,\" said Joe; \"this is wot I've got for to say, that we are in what the Yankees call a pretty considerable fix.\"  \"I know it, Joe; but how do you think we are to get out of the fix?\"  \"That's just wot I comed for to ax,\" said the man; \"and when you've told me how, I'll lend a hand to weigh anchor an' set sail.  The fact is, I'm in want of a place, and I'm willing to engage with _you_, sir.\"  Frank Allfrey experienced a strange mingling of feelings when he heard this.  Of course he felt much gratified by the fact that a man so grave and sensible as Joe Graddy should come and deferentially offer to become his servant at a time when he possessed nothing but the remnant of a month's salary; and when he considered his own youth, he felt amazed that one so old and manly should volunteer to place himself under his orders.  The fact is that Frank was not aware that his straightforward earnest manner had commended him very strongly to those, with whom he had lately come in contact.  He was one of those attractive men whose countenances express exactly what they feel, who usually walk with a quick earnest step, if we may say so, and with a somewhat downcast contemplative look.  Frank knew well enough that he was strong and tall, unusually so for his age, and therefore did not continually _assert_ the fact by walking as if he was afraid to fall forward, which is a common practice among men who wish to look bigger than they are.  Besides, being an ardent student of nature, Frank was himself natural, as well as amiable, and these qualities had endeared him to many people without his being aware of it.  \"Why, Joe!\" he exclaimed, \"what do you mean?\"  \"I mean wot I says, sir.\"  \"Are you aware,\" said Frank, smiling, \"that I do not possess a shilling beyond the few dollars that I saved off my last month's salary?\"  \"I s'posed as much, sir.\"  \"Then if you engage with me, as you express it, how do you expect to be paid?\"  \"I don't expect to be paid, sir.\"  \"Come, Joe, explain your meaning, for I don't pretend to be a diviner of men's thoughts.\"  \"Well, sir, this is how it is.  W'en we got the sack the other day, says I to myself, says I, now you're afloat on the world without rudder, compass, or charts, but you've got a tight craft of your own,--somewhat scrubbed, no doubt, with rough usage, but sound,--so it's time for you to look out for rudder, compass, and charts, and it seems to me that thems to be found with young Mister Allfrey, so you'd better go an' git him to become skipper o' your ship without delay.  You see, sir, havin' said that to myself, I've took my own advice, so if you'll take command of me, sir, you may steer me where you please, for I'm ready to be your sarvant for love, seein' that you han't got no money.\"  \"Most obliging of you,\" said Frank, laughing, \"and by this offer I understand that you wish to become my companion.\"  \"Of coorse, in a country o' this kind,\" replied Graddy, \"it's difficult,--I might a'most say unpossible,--to be a man's sarvant without bein' his companion likewise.\"  \"But here is a great difficulty at the outset, Joe.  I have not yet made up my mind what course to pursue.\"  \"Just so, sir,\" said the ex-seaman, with a look of satisfaction, \"I know'd you wouldn't be doin' that in a hurry, so I've comed to have a talk with 'e about it.\"  \"Very good, sit down,\" said Frank, \"and let us consider it.  In the first place, I regret to say that I have not been taught any trade, so that I cannot become a blacksmith or a carpenter or anything of that sort.  A clerk's duties I can undertake, but it seems to me that clerks are not much wanted here just now.  Porterage is heavy work and rather slow.  I may be reduced to that if nothing better turns up, but it has occurred to me that I might try painting with success.  What would you say to that, Joe?\"  The man looked at Frank in surprise.  \"Well,\" said he, \"people don't look as if they wanted to paint their houses here, an' most of 'em's got no houses.\"  \"Why, man, I don't mean house-painting.  It is portrait and landscape painting that I refer to,\" said Frank, laughing.  Joe shook his head gravely.  \"Never do, Mr Frank--\"  \"Stop! if you and I are to be companions in trouble, you must not call me _Mister_ Frank, you must drop the mister.\"  \"Then I won't go with 'e, sir, that's all about it,\" said Joe firmly.  \"Very well, please yourself,\" said Frank, with a laugh; \"but if painting is so hopeless, what would you advise?\"  \"The diggin's,\" answered Joe.  \"I thought so,\" said Frank, shaking his head.  \"Most men out of work rush to the diggings.  Indeed, many men are fools enough to leave their work to go there, but I confess that I don't like the notion.  It has always appeared to me such a pitiful thing to see men, who are fit for better things, go grubbing in the mud for gold.\"  \"But what are men to do, Mr Frank, w'en they can't git no other work?\"  \"Of course it is better to dig than to idle or starve, or be a burden on one's friends; nevertheless, I don't like the notion of it.  I suppose, however, that I must try it just now, for it is quite certain that we cannot exist here without gold.  By the way, Joe, have you got any more?\"  \"Not a rap, sir.\"  \"H'm, then I doubt whether I have enough to buy tools, not to speak of provisions.\"  \"I've bin' thinkin' about that, sir,\" said Joe, \"and it seems to me that our only chance lie in settin' up a grog and provision store!\"  \"A grog and provision store!\"  \"Yes, sir, the fact is that I had laid in a stock of pipes and baccy, tea and brandy, for winter's use this year.  Now as things have turned out, I shan't want these just at this minute, so we can sell 'em off to the diggers at a large profit.  We might make a good thing of it, sir, for you've no notion wot prices they'll give for things on the road to the diggin's--\"  Frank here interrupted his friend with a hearty laugh, and at the same time declared that he would have nothing to do with the grog and provision store; that he would rather take to porterage than engage in any such enterprise.  \"Well, then, sir, we won't say no more about that, but wot coorse would ye advise the ship's head to be laid?\"  Frank was silent for a few minutes as he sat with downcast eyes, absorbed in meditation.  Then he looked up suddenly, and said, \"Joe, I'll give you a definite answer to that question to-morrow morning. To-night I will think over it and make arrangements.  Meanwhile, let it suffice that I have made up my mind to go to the diggings, and if you remain in the same mind to-morrow, come here all ready for a start.\"  The ruddy countenance of the sturdy ex-porter beamed with gratification as he rose and took his leave of Frank, who heard him, as he walked away, making sundry allusions in nautical phraseology to having his anchor tripped at last, and the sails shook out, all ready for a start with the first o' the flood-tide in the morning!    CHAPTER THREE.  A VISIT TO THE DIGGINGS RESOLVED ON.  TERRIBLE COMMENCEMENT OF THE JOURNEY.  When next morning arrived, Joe Graddy, true to his word, appeared with the first--if not of the \"flood-tide,\" at least of the morning sun, and Frank told him that, on the previous evening, he had made arrangements to go to the diggings in company with a party that was to start the following day; that he had already made purchases of the few things which they would require on the journey, and that the only thing remaining to be done was to pack up.  \"Now, Joe, you must go at once to the principal guide and make arrangements with him as to that brandy and tea on which you expect to found your future fortunes.  I told him to expect a visit from you early in the day.\"  \"Wotiver you do, do it at once,\" said Joe, putting on his straw hat with an energetic slap.  \"That's one of my mottos.  I'll go an' carry it into practice.\"  The following day saw Frank and his man set forth with a party of about thirty men, all of whom were clad in blue or red flannel shirts, straw hats, big boots, and other rough garments;"]]]
