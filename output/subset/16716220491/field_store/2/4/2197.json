Who was next to make a continental landfall, and in the more southerly latitudes, is a question which lies between Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci.  Fiske, in a very convincing argument awards the honor to Vespucci, whose first voyage (May 1497 to October 1498) carried him from the north coast of Honduras along the Gulf coast around Florida, and possibly as far north as the Chesapeake Bay, and to the Bahamas on his return.  Markham scouts this claim.  Winsor neither agrees nor dissents.  His verdict in the case is a Scottish one, \"Not proven.\"  Who shall decide when the doctors disagree?  Let every one choose for himself.  As for me, I am inclined to agree with Fiske.  If it were not Vespucci, it certainly was Columbus on his third voyage (1498-1500).  On this voyage, the chief of the navigators struck the South American shore off the mouth of the Orinoco and sailed westward along it for a short distance before turning to the northward.  There he found so many pearls that he called it the \"Pearl Coast.\"  It is interesting to note that, however the question may be decided, all the honors go to Italy.  Columbus was a Genoese.  Cabot, although born in Genoa, had lived many years in Venice and had been made a citizen there; while Vespucci was a Florentine.  The first important expedition along the northern coast of South America was that of Ojeda in 1499-1500, in company with Juan de la Cosa, next to Columbus the most expert navigator and pilot of the age, and Vespucci, perhaps his equal in nautical science as he {5} was his superior in other departments of polite learning.  There were several other explorations of the Gulf coast, and its continuations on every side, during the same year, by one of the Pizons, who had accompanied Columbus on his first voyage; by Lepe; by Cabral, a Portuguese, and by Bastidas and La Cosa, who went for the first time as far to the westward as Porto Rico on the Isthmus of Darien.  On the fourth and last voyage of Columbus, he reached Honduras and thence sailed eastward and southward to the Gulf of Darien, having not the least idea that the shore line which he called Veragua was in fact the border of the famous Isthmus of Panama.  There were a number of other voyages, including a further exploration by La Cosa and Vespucci, and a second by Ojeda in which an abortive attempt was made to found a colony; but most of the voyages were mere trading expeditions, slave-hunting enterprises or searches, generally fruitless, for gold and pearls.  Ojeda reported after one of these voyages that the English were on the coast.  Who these English were is unknown.  The news, however, was sufficiently disquieting to Ferdinand, the Catholic--and also the Crafty!--who now ruled alone in Spain, and he determined to frustrate any possible English movement by planting colonies on the Spanish Main.   II. The Don Quixote of Discoveries and His Rival  Instantly two claimants for the honor of leading such an expedition presented themselves.  The first Alonzo de Ojeda, the other Diego de Nicuesa.  Two more extraordinary characters never went knight-erranting upon the seas.  Ojeda was one of the {6} prodigious men of a time which was fertile in notable characters.  Although small in stature, he was a man of phenomenal strength and vigor.  He could stand at the foot of the Giralda in Seville and throw an orange over it, a distance of two hundred and fifty feet from the earth![1]  Wishing to show his contempt for danger, on one occasion he ran out on a narrow beam projecting some twenty feet from the top of the same tower and there, in full view of Queen Isabella and her court, performed various gymnastic exercises, such as standing on one leg, _et cetera_, for the edification of the spectators, returning calmly and composedly to the tower when he had finished the exhibition.  He was a magnificent horseman, an accomplished knight and an able soldier.  There was no limit to his daring.  He went with Columbus on his second voyage, and, single-handed, effected the capture of a powerful Indian cacique named Caonabo, by a mixture of adroitness, audacity and courage.  Professing amity, he got access to the Indian, and, exhibiting some polished manacles, which he declared were badges of royalty, he offered to put them on the fierce but unsophisticated savage and then mount the chief on his own horse to show him off like a Spanish monarch to his subjects.  The daring programme was carried out just exactly as it had been planned.  When Ojeda had got the forest king safely fettered and mounted on his horse, he sprang up behind him, held him there firmly in spite of his efforts, and galloped off to Columbus with his astonished and disgusted captive.  [Illustration: \"Ojeda Galloped Off with His Astonished Captive\"]  {7}  Neither of the voyages was successful.  With all of his personal prowess, he was an unsuccessful administrator.  He was poor, not to say penniless.  He had two powerful friends, however.  One was Bishop Fonseca, who was charged with the administration of affairs in the Indies, and the other was stout old Juan de la Cosa.  These two men made a very efficient combination at the Spanish court, especially as La Cosa had some money and was quite willing to put it up, a prime requisite for the mercenary and niggardly Ferdinand's favor.  [Illustration: \"The Indians Poured a Rain of Poisoned Arrows\"]  The other claimant for the honor of leading the colony happened to be another man small in stature, but also of great bodily strength, although he scarcely equalled his rival in that particular.  Nicuesa had made a successful voyage to the Indies with Ovando, and had ample command of means.  He was a gentleman by birth and station--Ojeda was that also--and was grand carver-in-chief to the King's uncle!  Among his other qualities for successful colonization were a beautiful voice, a masterly touch on the guitar and an exquisite skill in equitation. He had even taught his horse to keep time to music.  Whether or not he played that music himself on the back of the performing steed is not recorded.  Ferdinand was unable to decide between the rival claimants.  Finally he determined to send out two expeditions.  The Gulf of Uraba, now called the Gulf of Darien, was to be the dividing line between the two allotments of territory.  Ojeda was to have that portion extending from the Gulf to the Cape de la Vela, which is just west of the Gulf of Venezuela.  This territory was named new Andalusia.  Nicuesa was to take that between the Gulf and the Cape Gracias á Dios off {8} Honduras.  This section was denominated Golden Castile.  Each governor was to fit out his expedition at his own charges.  Jamaica was given to both in common as a point of departure and a base of supplies.  The resources of Ojeda were small, but when he arrived at Santo Domingo with what he had been able to secure in the way of ships and men, he succeeded in inducing a lawyer named Encisco, commonly called the Bachelor[2] Encisco, to embark his fortune of several thousand gold castellanos, which he had gained in successful pleadings in the court in the litigious West Indies, in the enterprise.  In it he was given a high position, something like that of District Judge.  With this reënforcement, Ojeda and La Cosa equipped two small ships and two brigantines containing three hundred men and twelve horses.[3]  They were greatly chagrined when the imposing armada of Nicuesa, comprising four ships of different sizes, but much larger than any of Ojeda's, and two brigantines carrying seven hundred and fifty men, sailed into the harbor of Santo Domingo.  The two governors immediately began to quarrel.  Ojeda finally challenged Nicuesa to a duel which should determine the whole affair. Nicuesa, who had everything to lose and nothing to gain by fighting, but who could not well decline the challenge, said that he was willing to fight him if Ojeda would put up what would popularly be known to-day in the pugilistic {9} circles as \"a side bet\" of five thousand castellanos to make the fight worth while.[4]  Poor Ojeda could not raise another maravedi, and as nobody would stake him, the duel was off.  Diego Columbus, governor of Hispaniola, also interfered in the game to a certain extent by declaring that the Island of Jamaica was his, and that he would not allow anybody to make use of it.  He sent there one Juan de Esquivel, with a party of men to take possession of it.  Whereupon Ojeda stoutly declared that when he had time he would stop at that island and if Esquivel were there, he would cut off his head.  Finally on the 10th of November, 1509, Ojeda set sail, leaving Encisco to bring after him another ship with needed supplies.  With Ojeda was Francisco Pizarro, a middle-aged soldier of fortune, who had not hitherto distinguished himself in any way.  Hernando Cortez was to have gone along also, but fortunately for him, an inflammation of the knee kept him at home.  Ojeda was in such a hurry to get to El Dorado--for it was in the territory to the southward of his allotment, that the mysterious city was supposed to be located--that he did not stop at Jamaica to take off Esquivel's head--a good thing for him, as it subsequently turned out.  Nicuesa would have followed Ojeda immediately, but his prodigal generosity had exhausted even his large resources, and he was detained by clamorous creditors, the law of the island being that no one could leave it in debt.  The gallant little meat-carver labored with success to settle various suits pending, and thought {10} he had everything compounded; but just as he was about to sail he was arrested for another debt of five hundred ducats.  A friend at last advanced the money for him and he got away ten days after Ojeda.  It would have been a good thing if no friend had ever interfered and he had been detained indefinitely at Hispaniola.   III. The Adventures of Ojeda  Ojeda "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],["title","South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#2)"],["body","a landfall at what is known now as Cartagena.  It was not a particularly good place for a settlement.  There was no reason on earth why they should stay there at all.  La Cosa, who had been along the coast several times and knew it thoroughly, warned his youthful captain--to whom he was blindly and devotedly attached, by the way--that the place was extremely dangerous; that the inhabitants were fierce, brave and warlike, and that they had a weapon almost as effectual as the Spanish guns.  That was the poisoned arrow.  Ojeda thought he knew everything and he turned a deaf ear to all remonstrances.  He hoped he might chance upon an opportunity of surprising an Indian village and capturing a lot of inoffensive inhabitants for slaves, already a very profitable part of voyaging to the Indies.  He landed without much difficulty, assembled the natives and read to them a perfectly absurd manifesto, which had been prepared in Spain for use in similar contingencies, summoning them to change their religion and to acknowledge the supremacy of Spain.  Not one word of this did the natives understand and to it they responded with a volley of poisoned arrows.  The Spanish considered this paper a most {11} valuable document, and always went through the formality of having the publication of it attested by a notary public.  Ojeda seized some seventy-five captives, male and female, as slaves. They were sent on board the ships.  The Indian warriors, infuriated beyond measure, now attacked in earnest the shore party, comprising seventy men, among whom were Ojeda and La Cosa.  The latter, unable to prevent him, had considered it proper to go ashore with the hot-headed governor to restrain him so far as was possible.  Ojeda impetuously attacked the Indians and, with part of his men, pursued them several miles inland to their town, of which he took possession.  The savages, in constantly increasing numbers, clustered around the town and attacked the Spaniards with terrible persistence.  Ojeda and his followers took refuge in huts and enclosures and fought valiantly. Finally all were killed, or fatally wounded by the envenomed darts except Ojeda himself and a few men, who retreated to a small palisaded enclosure.  Into this improvised fort the Indians poured a rain of poisoned arrows which soon struck down every one but the governor himself.  Being small of stature and extremely agile, and being provided with a large target or shield, he was able successfully to fend off the deadly arrows from his person.  It was only a question of time before the Indians would get him and he would die in the frightful agony which his men experienced after being infected with the poison upon the arrow-points.  In his extremity, he was rescued by La Cosa who had kept in hand a moiety of the shore party.  The advent of La Cosa saved Ojeda.  Infuriated at the slaughter of his men, Ojeda rashly and {12} intemperately threw himself upon the savages, at once disappearing from the view of La Cosa and his men, who were soon surrounded and engaged in a desperate battle on their own account.  They, too, took refuge in the building, from which they were forced to tear away the thatched roof that might have shielded them from the poisoned arrows, in fear lest the Indians might set it on fire.  And they in turn were also reduced to the direst of straits. One after another was killed, and finally La Cosa himself, who had been desperately wounded before, received a mortal hurt; while but one man remained on his feet.  Possibly thinking that they had killed the whole party, and withdrawing to turn their attention to Ojeda, furiously ranging the forest alone, the Indians left the two surviving Spaniards unmolested, whereupon the dying La Cosa bade his comrade leave him, and if possible get word to Ojeda of the fate which had overtaken him.  This man succeeded in getting back to the shore and apprised the men there of the frightful disaster.  The ships cruised along the shore, sending parties into the bay at different points looking for Ojeda and any others who might have survived.  A day or two after the battle they came across their unfortunate commander.  He was lying on his back in a grove of mangroves, upheld from the water by the gnarled and twisted roots of one of the huge trees.  He had his naked sword in his hand and his target on his arm, but he was completely prostrated and speechless. The men took him to a fire, revived him and finally brought him back to the ship.  Marvelous to relate, he had not a single wound upon him!  {13}  Great was the grief of the little squadron at this dolorous state of affairs.  In the middle of it, the ships of Nicuesa hove in sight. Mindful of their previous quarrels, Ojeda decided to stay ashore until he found out what were Nicuesa's intentions toward him.  Cautiously his men broke the news to Nicuesa.  With magnanimity and courtesy delightful to contemplate, he at once declared that he had forgotten the quarrel and offered every assistance to Ojeda to enable him to avenge himself.  Ojeda thereupon rejoined the squadron, and the two rivals embraced with many protestations of friendship amid the acclaim of their followers.  The next night, four hundred men were secretly assembled.  They landed and marched to the Indian town, surrounded it and put it to the flames. The defenders fought with their usual resolution, and many of the Spaniards were killed by the poisonous arrows, but to no avail.  The Indians were doomed, and the whole village perished then and there.  Nicuesa had landed some of his horses, and such was the terror inspired by those remarkable and unknown animals that several of the women who had escaped from the fire, when they caught sight of the frightful monsters, rushed back into the flames, preferring this horrible death rather than to meet the horses.  The value of the plunder amounted to eighteen thousand dollars in modern money, the most of which Nicuesa took.  The two adventurers separated, Nicuesa bidding Ojeda farewell and striking boldly across the Caribbean for Veragua, which was the name Columbus had given to the Isthmian coast below Honduras; while Ojeda crept along the shore seeking a convenient {14} spot to plant his colony.  Finally he established himself at a place which he named San Sebastian.  One of his ships was wrecked and many of his men were lost. Another was sent back to Santo Domingo with what little treasure they had gathered and with an appeal to Encisco to hurry up.  They made a rude fort on the shore, from which to prosecute their search for gold and slaves.  The Indians, who also belonged to the poisoned-arrow fraternity, kept the fort in constant anxiety.  Many were the conflicts between the Spaniards and the savages, and terrible were the losses inflicted by the invaders; but there seemed to be no limit to the number of Indians, while every Spaniard killed was a serious drain upon the little party.  Man after man succumbed to the effects of the dreadful poison.  Ojeda, who never spared himself in any way, never received a wound.  From their constant fighting, the savages got to recognize him as the leader and they used all their skill to compass destruction.  Finally, they succeeded in decoying him into an ambush where four of their best men had been posted.  Recklessly exposing themselves, the Indians at close range opened fire upon their prisoner with arrows.  Three of the arrows he caught on his buckler, but the fourth pierced his thigh.  It is surmised that Ojeda attended to the four Indians before taking cognizance of his wound.  The arrow, of course, was poisoned, and unless something could be done, it meant death.  He resorted to a truly heroic expedient.  He caused two iron plates to be heated white-hot and then directed the surgeon to apply the plates to the wound, one at the entrance and the other at the exit of the arrow.  {15} The surgeon, appalled by the idea of such torture, refused to do so, and it was not until Ojeda threatened to hang him with his own hands that he consented.  Ojeda bore the frightful agony without a murmur or a quiver, such was his extraordinary endurance.  It was the custom in that day to bind patients who were operated upon surgically, that their involuntary movements might not disconcert the doctors and cause them to wound where they hoped to cure.  Ojeda refused even to be bound.  The remedy was efficacious, although the heat of the iron, in the language of the ancient chronicler, so entered his system that they used a barrel of vinegar to cool him off.  Ojeda was very much dejected by the fact that he had been wounded.  It seemed to him that the Virgin, his patron, had deserted him.  The little band, by this time reduced to less than one hundred people, was in desperate straits.  Starvation stared it in the face when fortunately assistance came.  One Bernardino de Talavera, with seventy congenial cut-throats, absconding debtors and escaped criminals, from Hispaniola, had seized a Genoese trading-ship loaded with provisions and had luckily reached San Sebastian in her.  They sold these provisions to Ojeda and his men at exorbitant prices, for some of the hard-earned treasure which they had amassed with their great expenditure of life and health.  There was no place else for Talavera and his gang to go, so they stayed at San Sebastian.  The supply of provisions was soon exhausted, and finally it was evident that, as Encisco had not appeared with any reënforcements or supplies, some one must go back to Hispaniola to bring rescue to the party.  Ojeda offered to do this himself.  Giving the charge of affairs at {16} San Sebastian to Francisco Pizarro, who promised to remain there for fifty days for the expected help, he embarked with Talavera.  Naturally Ojeda considered himself in charge of the ship; naturally Talavera did not.  Ojeda, endeavoring to direct things, was seized and put in chains by the crew.  He promptly challenged the whole "]]]
