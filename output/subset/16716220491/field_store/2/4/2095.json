GEOFFROY ST. HILAIRE                                   212     LAMARCK, THE FOUNDER OF EVOLUTION. HIS LIFE AND WORK     CHAPTER I  BIRTH, FAMILY, YOUTH, AND MILITARY CAREER   The life of Lamarck is the old, old story of a man of genius who lived far in advance of his age, and who died comparatively unappreciated and neglected. But his original and philosophic views, based as they were on broad conceptions of nature, and touching on the burning questions of our day, have, after the lapse of a hundred years, gained fresh interest and appreciation, and give promise of permanent acceptance.  The author of the _Flore Française_ will never be forgotten by his countrymen, who called him the French Linné; and he who wrote the _Animaux sans Vertèbres_ at once took the highest rank as the leading zoölogist of his period. But Lamarck was more than a systematic biologist of the first order. Besides rare experience and judgment in the classification of plants and of animals, he had an unusually active, inquiring, and philosophical mind, with an originality and boldness in speculation, and soundness in reasoning and in dealing with such biological facts as were known in his time, which have caused his views as to the method of organic evolution to again come to the front.  As a zoölogical philosopher no one of his time approached Lamarck. The period, however, in which he lived was not ripe for the hearty and general adoption of the theory of descent. As in the organic world we behold here and there prophetic types, anticipating, in their generalized synthetic nature, the incoming, ages after, of more specialized types, so Lamarck anticipated by more than half a century the principles underlying the present evolutionary theories.  So numerous are now the adherents, in some form, of Lamarck's views, that at the present time evolutionists are divided into Darwinians and Lamarckians or Neolamarckians. The factors of organic evolution as stated by Lamarck, it is now claimed by many, really comprise the primary or foundation principles or initiative causes of the origin of life-forms. Hence not only do many of the leading biologists of his native country, but some of those of Germany, of the United States, and of England, justly regard him as the founder of the theory of organic evolution.  Besides this, Lamarck lived in a transition period. He prepared the way for the scientific renascence in France. Moreover, his simple, unselfish character was a rare one. He led a retired life. His youth was tinged with romance, and during the last decade of his life he was blind. He manfully and patiently bore adverse criticisms, ridicule, forgetfulness, and inappreciation, while, so far from renouncing his theoretical views, he tenaciously clung to them to his dying day.  The biography of such a character is replete with interest, and the memory of his unselfish and fruitful devotion to science should be forever cherished. His life was also notable for the fact that after his fiftieth year he took up and mastered a new science; and at a period when many students of literature and science cease to be productive and rest from their labors, he accomplished the best work of his life--work which has given him lasting fame as a systematist and as a philosophic biologist. Moreover, Lamarckism comprises the fundamental principles of evolution, and will always have to be taken into consideration in accounting for the origin, not only of species, but especially of the higher groups, such as orders, classes, and phyla.  This striking personage in the history of biological science, who has made such an ineffaceable impression on the philosophy of biology, certainly demands more than a brief _éloge_ to keep alive his memory.         ~       ~       ~       ~       ~  Jean-Baptiste-Pierre-Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck, was born August 1, 1744, at Bazentin-le-Petit. This little village is situated in Picardy, or what is now the Department of the Somme, in the Arrondissement de Péronne, Canton d'Albert, a little more than four miles from Albert, between this town and Bapaume, and near Longueval, the nearest post-office to Bazentin. The village of Bazentin-le-Grand, composed of a few more houses than its sister hamlet, is seen half a mile to the southeast, shaded by the little forest such as borders nearly every town and village in this region. The two hamlets are pleasantly situated in a richly cultivated country, on the chalk uplands or downs of Picardy, amid broad acres of wheat and barley variegated with poppies and the purple cornflower, and with roadsides shaded by tall poplars.  The peasants to the number of 251 compose the diminishing population. There were 356 in 1880, or about that date. The silence of the single little street, with its one-storied, thatched or tiled cottages, is at infrequent intervals broken by an elderly dame in her _sabots_, or by a creaking, rickety village cart driven by a farmer-boy in blouse and hob-nailed shoes. The largest inhabited building is the _mairie_, a modern structure, at one end of which is the village school, where fifteen or twenty urchins enjoy the instructions of the worthy teacher. A stone church, built in 1774, and somewhat larger than the needs of the hamlet at present require, raises its tower over the quiet scene.  Our pilgrimage to Bazentin had for its object the discovery of the birthplace of Lamarck, of which we could obtain no information in Paris. Our guide from Albert took us to the _mairie_, and it was with no little satisfaction that we learned from the excellent village teacher, M. Duval, that the house in which the great naturalist was born was still standing, and but a few steps away, in the rear of the church and of the _mairie_. With much kindness he left his duties in the schoolroom, and accompanied us to the ancient structure.  [Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF LAMARCK, FRONT VIEW]  [Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF LAMARCK]  The modest _château_ stands a few rods to the westward of the little village, and was evidently the seat of the leading family of the place. It faces east and is a two-storied house of the shape seen everywhere in France, with its high, incurved roof; the walls, nearly a foot and a half thick, built of brick; the corners and windows of blocks of white limestone. It is about fifty feet long and twenty-five feet wide. Above the roof formerly rose a small tower. There is no porch over the front door. Within, a rather narrow hall passes through the centre, and opens into a large room on each side. What was evidently the drawing-room or _salon_ was a spacious apartment with a low white wainscot and a heavy cornice. Over the large, roomy fireplace is a painting on the wood panel, representing a rural scene, in which a shepherdess and her lover are engaged in other occupations than the care of the flock of sheep visible in the distance. Over the doorway is a smaller but quaint painting of the same description. The house is uninhabited, and perhaps uninhabitable--indeed almost a ruin--and is used as a storeroom for wood and rubbish by the peasants in the adjoining house to the left, on the south.  The ground in front was cultivated with vegetables, not laid down to a lawn, and the land stretched back for perhaps three hundred to four hundred feet between the old garden walls.  Here, amid these rural scenes, even now so beautiful and tranquil, the subject of our sketch was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],["title","Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#2)"],["body","and lived through his infancy and early boyhood.[1]  If his parents did not possess an ample fortune, they were blessed with a numerous progeny, for Lamarck was the eleventh and youngest child, and seems to have survived all the others. Biographers have differed as to the date of the birth of Lamarck.[2] Happily the exact date had been ascertained through the researches of M. Philippe Salmon; and M. Duval kindly showed us in the thin volume of records, with its tattered and torn leaves, the register of the _Acte de Naissance_, and made a copy of it, as follows:    _Extrait du Registre aux Actes de Baptême de la Commune de Bazentin,   pour l'Année 1744._    L'an mil sept cent quarante-quatre, le premier août est né en   légitime mariage et le lendemain a été baptisé par moy curé   soussigné Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine, fils de Messire Jacques   Philippe de Monet, chevalier de Lamarck, seigneur des Bazentin grand   et petit et de haute et puissante Dame Marie Françoise de Fontaine   demeurant en leur château de Bazentin le petit, son parrain a été   Messire Jean Baptiste de Fossé, prêtre-chanoine de l'église   collégiale de St. Farcy de Péronne, y demeurant, sa marraine Dame   Antoinette Françoise de Bucy, nièce de Messire Louis Joseph   Michelet, chevalier, ancien commissaire de l'artillerie de France   demeurante au château de Guillemont, qui ont signé avec mon dit   sieur de Bazentin et nous.    Ont signé: De Fossé, De Bucy Michelet, Bazentin. Cozette, curé.  [Illustration: ACT OF BIRTH]  Of Lamarck's parentage and ancestry there are fortunately some traces. In the _Registre aux Actes de Baptême pour l'Année 1702_, still preserved in the _mairie_ of Bazentin-le-Petit, the record shows that his father was born in February, 1702, at Bazentin. The infant was baptised February 16, 1702, the permission to the _curé_ by Henry, Bishop of Amiens, having been signed February 3, 1702. Lamarck's grandparents were, according to this certificate of baptism, Messire Philippe de Monet de Lamarck, Ecuyer, Seigneur des Bazentin, and Dame Magdeleine de Lyonne.  The family of Lamarck, as stated by H. Masson,[3] notwithstanding his northern and almost Germanic name of Chevalier de Lamarck, originated in the southwest of France. Though born at Bazentin, in old Picardy, it is not less true that he descended on the paternal side from an ancient house of Béarn, whose patrimony was very modest. This house was that of Monet.  Another genealogist, Baron C. de Cauna,[4] tells us that there is no doubt that the family of Monet in Bigorre[5] was divided. One of its representatives formed a branch in Picardy in the reign of Louis XIV. or later.  Lamarck's grandfather, Philippe de Monet, \"seigneur de Bazentin et autres lieux,\" was also \"chevalier de l'ordre royal et militaire de Saint-Louis, commandant pour le roi en la ville et château de Dinan, pensionnaire de sa majesté.\"  The descendants of Philippe de Lamarck were, adds de Cauna, thus thrown into two branches, or at least two offshoots or stems (_brisures_), near Péronne. But the actual posterity of the Monet of Picardy was reduced to a single family, claiming back, with good reason, to a southern origin. One of its scions in the maternal line was a brilliant officer of the military marine and also son-in-law of a very distinguished naval officer.  The family of Monet was represented among the French nobility of 1789 by Messires de Monet de Caixon and de Monet de Saint-Martin. By marriage their grandson was connected with an honorable family of Montant, near Saint-Sever-Cap.  Another authority, the Abbé J. Dulac, has thrown additional light on the genealogy of the de Lamarck family, which, it may be seen, was for at least three centuries a military one.[6] The family of Monet, Seigneur de Saint-Martin et de Sombran, was maintained as a noble one by order of the Royal Council of State of June 20, 1678. He descended (I) from Bernard de Monet, esquire, captain of the château of Lourdes, who had as a son (II) Étienne de Monet, esquire, who, by contract dated August 15, 1543, married Marguerite de Sacaze. He was the father of (III) Pierre de Monet, esquire, \"Seigneur d'Ast, en Béarn, guidon des gendarmes de la compagnie du roi de Navarre.\" From him descended (IV) Étienne de Monet, esquire, second of the name, \"Seigneur d'Ast et Lamarque, de Julos.\" He was a captain by rank, and bought the estate of Saint-Martin in 1592. He married, in 1612, Jeanne de Lamarque, daughter of William de Lamarck, \"Seigneur de Lamarque et de Bretaigne.\" They had three children, the third of whom was Philippe, \"chevalier de Saint-Louis, commandant du château de Dinan, Seigneur de Bazentin, en Picardy,\" who, as we have already seen, was the father of the naturalist Lamarck, who lived from 1744 to 1829. The abbé relates that Philippe, the father of the naturalist, was born at Saint-Martin, in the midst of Bigorre, \"_in pleine Bigorre_,\" and he very neatly adds that \"the Bigorrais have the right to claim for their land of flowers one of the glories of botany.\"[7]  The name was at first variously spelled de Lamarque, de la Marck, or de Lamarck. He himself signed his name, when acting as secretary of the Assembly of Professors-administrative of the Museum of Natural History during the years of the First Republic, as plain Lamarck.  The inquiry arises how, being the eleventh child, he acquired the title of chevalier, which would naturally have become extinct with the death of the oldest son. The Abbé Dulac suggests that the ten older of the children had died, or that by some family arrangement he was allowed to add the domanial name to the patronymic one. Certainly he never tarnished the family name, which, had it not been for him, would have remained in obscurity.  As to his father's tastes and disposition, what influence his mother had in shaping his character, his home environment, as the youngest of eleven children, the nature of his education in infancy and boyhood, there are no sources of information. But several of his brothers entered the army, and the domestic atmosphere was apparently a military one.  Philippe de Lamarck, with his large family, had endowed his first-born son so that he could maintain the family name and title, and had found situations for several of the others in the army. Jean Lamarck did not manifest any taste for the clerical profession. He lived in a martial atmosphere. For centuries his ancestors had borne arms. His eldest brother had been killed in the breach at the siege of Berg-op-Zoom; two others were still in the service, and in the troublous times at the beginning of the war in 1756, a young man of high spirit and courage would naturally not like to relinquish the prospect of renown and promotion. But, yielding to the wishes of his father, he entered as a student at the college of the Jesuits at Amiens.[8]  His father dying in 1760, nothing could induce the incipient abbé, then seventeen years of age, to longer wear his bands. Immediately on returning home he bought himself a wretched horse, for want of means to buy a better one, and, accompanied by a poor lad of his village, he rode across the country to join the French army, then campaigning in Germany.

Paris le 5 pluviose an dix  Lamarck]  He carried with him a letter of recommendation from one of his neighbors on an adjoining estate in the country, Madame de Lameth, to M. de Lastic, colonel of the regiment of Beaujolais.[9]    \"We can imagine [says Cuvier] the feelings of this officer on thus   finding himself hampered with a boy whose puny appearance made him   seem still younger than he was. However, he sent him to his   quarters, and then busied himself with his duties. The period indeed   was a critical one. It was the 16th of July, 1761. The Marshal   de Broglie had just united his army with that of the Prince   de Soubise, and the next day was to attack the allied army commanded   by the Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. At the break of day M.   de Lastic rode along the front of his corps, and the first man that   met his gaze was the new recruit, who, without saying anything to   him, had placed himself in the front rank of a company of   grenadiers, and nothing could induce him to quit his post.    \"It is a matter of history that this battle, which bears the name of   the little village of Fissingshausen, between Ham and Lippstadt, in   Westphalia, was lost by the French, and that the two generals,   mutually accusing each other of this defeat, immediately separated,   and abandoned the campaign.    \"During the movement of the battle, de Lamarck's company was   stationed in a position exposed to the direct fire of the enemy's   artillery. In the confusion of the retreat he was forgotten. Already   all the officers and non-commissioned officers had been killed;   there remained only fourteen men, when the oldest grenadier, seeing   that there were no more of the French troops in sight, proposed to   the young volunteer, become so promptly commander, to withdraw his   little troop. 'But we are assigned to this post,' said the boy, 'and   we should not withdraw from it until we are relieved.' And he made   them remain there until the colonel, seeing that the squad did not   rally, sent him an orderly, who crept by all sorts of covered ways   to reach him. This bold stand having been reported to the marshal,   he promoted him on the field to the rank of an officer, although his   order had prescribed that he should be very chary of these kinds of   promotions.\"  His physical courage shown at this age was paralleled by his moral courage in later years. The staying power he showed in immovably adhering to his views on evolution through many years, and under the direct and raking fire of harsh and"]]]
