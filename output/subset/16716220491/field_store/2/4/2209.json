As Joseph was a-walking,     He heard an angel sing:   \"This night shall be born     Our Heavenly King;    \"He neither shall be born     In housen nor in hall,   Nor in the place of Paradise,     But in an ox's stall;    \"He neither shall be clothéd     In purple nor in pall,   But all in fair linen,     As we were babies all.    \"He neither shall be rocked     In silver nor in gold,   But in a wooden cradle     That rocks on the mould.    \"He neither shall be christened     In white wine nor in red,   But with fair spring-water     With which we were christenéd.\"     THE MATCHLESS MAIDEN.     I sing of a maiden     That is makeless;[F]   King of all kings     To her son she ches;[G]    He came also[H] still     There His mother was,   As dew in April     That falleth on the grass.    He came also still     To His mother's bower,   As dew in April     That falleth on the flower.    He came also still     There His mother lay,   As dew in April     That falleth on the spray.    Mother and maiden     Was never none but she;   Well may such a lady     God's mother be.                      _Wright's Songs and Carols._   FOOTNOTES:  [F] Matchless.  [G] Chose.  [H] As.     REMEMBER, O THOU MAN.     Remember, O thou Man,   O thou Man, O thou Man;   Remember, O thou Man,     Thy time is spent.   Remember, O thou Man,   How thou earnest to me then,   And I did what I can,     Therefore repent.    Remember Adam's fall,   O thou Man, O thou Man;   Remember Adam's fall     From Heaven to Hell.   Remember Adam's fall,   How we were condemnéd all   To Hell perpetual,     There for to dwell.    Remember God's goodness,   O thou Man, O thou Man;   Remember God's goodness     And promise made.   Remember God's goodness,   How His only Son He sent   Our sins for to redress,     Be not afraid.    The Angels all did sing,   O thou Man, O thou Man;   The Angels all did sing     On Sion hill.   The Angels all did sing   Praises to our heavenly king,   And peace to man living,     With right good-will.    The Shepherds amazed was,   O thou Man, O thou Man;   The Shepherds amazed was     To hear the angels sing.   The Shepherds amazed was   How this should come to pass,   That Christ our Messias     Should be our King.    To Bethlehem did they go,   O thou Man, O thou Man;   To Bethlehem did they go     This thing to see.   To Bethlehem did they go   To see whether it was so,   Whether Christ was born or no,     To set us free.    As the Angels before did say,   O thou Man, O thou Man;   As the Angels before did say,     So it came to pass.   As the Angels before did say,   They found Him wrapt in hay   In a manger where He lay,     So poor He was.    In Bethlehem was He born,   O thou Man, O thou Man;   In Bethlehem was He born     For mankind dear.   In Bethlehem was He born   For us that were forlorn,   And therefore took no scorn     Our sins to bear.    In a manger laid He was,   O thou Man, O thou Man;   In a manger laid He was     At this time present.   In a manger laid He was   Between an ox and an ass,   And all for our trespass,     Therefore repent.    Give thanks to God always,   O thou Man, O thou Man;   Give thanks to God always     With hearts most jolly.   Give thanks to God always   Upon this blessed day,   Let all men sing and say,     Holy, Holy.                      _Ravenscroft's Melismata, A.D. 1611._     THE SINGERS IN THE SNOW.     God bless the master of this house     And all that are therein,   And to begin this Christmas tide     With mirth now let us sing.   For the Saviour of all people     Upon this time was born,   Who did from death deliver us.     When we were left forlorn.    Then let us all most merry be,     And sing with cheerful voice,   For we have good occasion now     This time for to rejoice.                               For, etc.    Then put away contention all,     And fall no more at strife,   Let every man with cheerfulness     Embrace his loving wife.                               For, etc.    With plenteous food your houses store,     Provide some wholesome cheer,   And call your friends together     That live both far and near.                               For, etc.    Then let us all most merry be,     Since that we are come here,   And we do hope before we part     To taste some of your beer.                               For, etc.    Your beer, your beer, your Christmas beer,     That seems to be so strong;   And we do wish that Christmas-tide     Was twenty times so long.                               For, etc.    Then sing with voices cheerfully,     For Christ this time was born,   Who did from death deliver us,     When we were left forlorn.                               For, etc.     A CHRISTMAS CHORUS.     Here is joy for every age--   Every generation;   Prince and peasant, chief and sage,   Every tongue and nation,   Every tongue and nation,   Every rank and station,   Hath to-day salvation.         Alleluia!    When the world drew near its close,   Came our Lord and leader;   From the lily came the rose,   From the bush the cedar,   From the bush the cedar,   From the judge the pleader,   From the saint the feeder.         Alleluia!    God, that came on earth this morn,   In a manger lying,   Hallow'd birth by being born,   Vanquished death by dying,   Vanquished death by dying,   Rallied back the flying,   Ended sin and sighing.         Alleluia!     THREE SHIPS.     I saw three ships come sailing in,     On Christmas day, on Christmas day;   I saw three ships come sailing in,     On Christmas day in the morning.    And what was in those ships all three,     On Christmas day, on Christmas day?   And what was in those ships all three,     On Christmas day in the morning?    Our Saviour Christ and His lady,     On Christmas day, on Christmas day;   Our Saviour Christ and His lady,     On Christmas day in the morning.    Pray whither sailed those ships all three,     On Christmas day, on Christmas day?   Pray whither sailed those ships all three,     On Christmas day in the morning?    O they sailed into Bethlehem,     On Christmas day, on Christmas day,   O they sailed into Bethlehem,     On Christmas day in the morning.    And all the bells on earth shall ring,     On Christmas day, on Christmas day;   And all the bells on earth shall ring,     On Christmas day in the morning.    And all the angels in heaven shall sing,     On Christmas day, on Christmas day;   And all the angels in heaven shall sing,     On Christmas day in the morning.    And all the souls on earth shall sing,     On Christmas day, on Christmas day;   And all the souls on earth shall sing,     On Christmas day in the morning.    Then let us all rejoice amain,     On Christmas day, on Christmas day;   Then let us all rejoice amain,     On Christmas day in the morning.     JACOB'S LADDER.     As Jacob with travel was weary one day,   At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;   He saw in a vision a ladder so high   That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.     Hallelujah to Jesus, who died on the tree,     And hath rais'd up a ladder of mercy for me.    This ladder is high, it is strong and well made,   Hath stood hundreds of years and is not yet decayed;   Many millions have climbed it and reached Zion's hill,   And thousands, by faith, are climbing it still.                                 Hallelujah, etc.    Come, let us ascend, all may climb it who will,   For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still;   And remember each step that by faith we pass o'er,   Some prophet or martyr hath trod it before.                                 Hallelujah, etc.    And when we arrive at the haven of rest,   We shall hear the glad word: Come up hither, ye blest!   Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss,   Oh, who would not climb such a ladder as this?                                 Hallelujah, etc.     SAINT STEPHEN, THE CLERK.     Saint Stephen was a clerk     In King Herod's hall,   And servéd him of bread and cloth     As ever king befall.    Stephen out of kitchen came     With boar's head on hand,   He saw a star was fair and bright     Over Bethlehem stand.    He kist adown the boar's head     And went into the hall:   \"I forsake thee, King Herod,     And thy workés all.    \"I forsake thee, King Herod,     And thy workés all;   There is a child in Bethlehem born     Is better than we all.\"    \"What aileth thee, Stephen?     What is thee befall?   Lacketh thee either meat or drink     In King Herod's hall?\"    \"Lacketh me neither meat ne drink     In King Herod's hall;   There is a child in Bethlehem born     Is better than we all.\"    \"What aileth thee, Stephen?     Art thou wode,[I] or thou ginnest to breed?[J]   Lacketh thee either gold or fee,     Or any rich weed?\"[K]    \"Lacketh me neither gold nor fee,     Ne none rich weed;   There is a child in Bethlehem born     Shall helpen us at our need.\"    \"That is also sooth,[L] Stephen,     Also sooth i-wis   As this capon crowé shall     That lieth here in my dish.\"    That word was not so soon said,     That word in that hall,   The capon crew _Christus natus est_     Among the lordés all.    \"Riseth up, my tormentors,     By two and all by one,   And leadeth Stephen out of this town,     And stoneth him with stone."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20956"],["title","In The Yule-Log Glow, Book IV (#2)"],["body","\"    Tooken they Stephen     And stoned him in the way,   And therefore is his even     On Christés own day.   FOOTNOTES:  [I] Mad.  [J] Scold.  [K] Dress.  [L] As true.     THE CARNAL AND THE CRANE.     As I pass'd by a riverside,     And there as I did reign,[M]   In argument I chanced to hear     A Carnal[N] and a Crane.    The Carnal said unto the Crane,     If all the world should turn,   Before we had the Father,     But now we have the Son!    From whence does the Son come?     From where and from what place?   He said, In a manger,     Between an ox and ass!    I pray thee, said the Carnal,     Tell me before thou go,   Was not the mother of Jesus     Conceived by the Holy Ghost?    She was the purest Virgin,     And the cleanest from sin;   She was the handmaid of our Lord,     And mother of our King.    Where is the golden cradle     That Christ was rockéd in?   Where are the silken sheets     That Jesus was wrapt in?    A manger was the cradle     That Christ was rockéd in;   The provender the asses left     So sweetly He slept on.    There was a star in the West-land,     So bright did it appear   Into King Herod's chamber,     And where King Herod were.    The Wise Men soon espied it,     And told the king on high,   A princely babe was born that night     No king could e'er destroy.    If this be true, King Herod said,     As thou tellest unto me,   This roasted cock that lies in the dish     Shall crow full fences[O] three.    The cock soon freshly feathered was     By the work of God's own hand,   And then three fences crowéd he     In the dish where he did stand.    Rise up, rise up, you merry men all,     See that you ready be,   All children under two years old     Now slain they all shall be.    Then Jesus, ah! and Joseph,     And Mary that was so pure,   They travelled into Egypt,     As you shall find it sure.    And when they came to Egypt's land,     Amongst those fierce wild beasts,   Mary, she being weary,     Must needs sit down to rest.    Come sit thee down, says Jesus,     Come sit thee down by me,   And thou shalt see how these wild beasts     Do come and worship me.    First came the lovely lion,     Which Jesu's grace did spring,   And of the wild beasts in the field,     The lion shall be the king.    We'll choose our virtuous princes,     Of birth and high degree,   In every sundry nation,     Where'er we come and see.    Then Jesus, ah! and Joseph,     And Mary, that was unknown,   They travelled by a husbandman,     Just while his seed was sown.    God speed thee, man! said Jesus,     Go fetch thy ox and wain,   And carry home thy corn again     Which thou this day hast sown.    The husbandman fell on his knees,     Even before his face;   Long time hast Thou been looked for,     But now Thou art come at last.    And I myself do now believe     Thy name is Jesus called;   Redeemer of mankind Thou art,     Though undeserving all.    The truth, man, thou hast spoken,     Of it thou may'st be sure,   For I must lose my precious blood     For thee and thousands more.    If any one should come this way,     And inquire for me alone,   Tell them that Jesus passed by,     As thou thy seed did sow.    After that there came King Herod,     With his train so furiously,   Inquiring of the husbandman,     Whether Jesus passed by.    Why, the truth it must be spoke,     And the truth it must be known,   For Jesus passéd by this way     When my seed was sown.    But now I have it reapen,     And some laid on my wain,   Ready to fetch and carry     Into my barn again.    Turn back, says the captain,     Your labor and mine's in vain,   It's full three-quarters of a year     Since he his seed sown.    So Herod was deceivéd     By the work of God's own hand,   And further he proceeded     Into the Holy Land.    There's thousands of children young,     Which for His sake did die;   Do not forbid those little ones,     And do not them deny.    The truth now I have spoken,     And the truth now I have shown,   Even the blessed Virgin,     She's now brought forth a Son.   FOOTNOTES:  [M] Run.  [N] Crow.  [O] Rounds.     THE HOLY WELL.     As it fell out one May morning,     And upon one bright holiday,   Sweet Jesus asked of His dear mother,     If He might go to play.    To play, to play, sweet Jesus shall go,     And to play pray get you gone;   And let me hear of no complaint     At night when you come home.    Sweet Jesus went down to yonder town     As far as the Holy Well,   And there did see as fine children     As any tongue can tell.    He said, God bless you every one,     And your bodies Christ save and see:   Little children, shall I play with you,     And you shall play with me?    But they made answer to Him, No:     They were lords' and ladies' sons;   And He, the meanest of them all,     Was but a maiden's child, born in an ox's stall.    Sweet Jesus turned Him around,     And He neither laughed nor smiled,   But the tears came trickling from His eyes     Like water from the skies.    Sweet Jesus turned Him about,     To His mother's dear home went He,   And said, I have been in yonder town,     As far as you can see.    I have been down in yonder town     As far as the Holy Well,   There did I meet as fine children     As any tongue can tell.    I bid God bless them every one,     And their bodies Christ save and see:   Little children, shall I play with you,     And you shall play with me?    But they made answer to me, No:     They were lords' and ladies' sons;   And I, the meanest of them all,     Was but a maiden's child, born in an ox's stall.    Though you are but a maiden's child,     Born in an ox's stall,   Thou art the Christ, the King of heaven,     And the Saviour of them all.    Sweet Jesus, go down to yonder town     As far as the Holy Well,   And take away those sinful souls,     And dip them deep in hell.    Nay, nay, sweet Jesus said,     Nay, nay, that may not be;   For there are too many sinful souls     Crying out for the help of me.     THE HOLLY AND THE IVY.     The Holly and the Ivy,   Now both are full well grown;   Of all the trees that spring in wood,   The holly bears the crown.   The holly bears a blossom   As white as a lily flow'r;   And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ   To be our sweet Saviour.    The holly bears a berry   As red as any blood,   And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ   To do poor sinners good.   The holly bears a prickle   As sharp as any thorn,   And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ   On Christmas Day in the morn.    The holly bears a bark   As bitter as any gall,   And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ   For to redeem us all.   The holly and the ivy   Now are both well grown;   Of all the trees that are in the wood,   The holly bears the crown.     THE CONTEST OF THE VINES.     Nay, ivy, nay,     It shall not be, I wis;   Let holly have the mastery,     As the manner is.    Holly stand in the hall,     Fair to behold;   Ivy stand without the door,     She is full sore a-cold.                       Nay, ivy, nay, etc.    Holly and his merry men     They dancen and they sing;   Ivy and her maidens     They weepen and they wring.                       Nay, ivy, nay, etc.    Ivy hath a kybe,[P]     She caught it with the cold;   So mot they all have ae,[Q]     That with ivy hold.                       Nay, ivy, nay, etc.    Holly hath berries     As red as any rose,   The forester and the hunters     Keep them from the does.                       Nay, ivy, nay, etc.    Ivy hath berries     As black as any sloe;   There come the owl     And eat him as she go.                       Nay, ivy, nay, etc.    Holly hath birdés     A full fair flock,   The nightingale, the popinjay,     The gentle laverock.                       Nay, ivy, nay, etc.    Good ivy,     What birdés hast thou?   None but the howlet     That krey[R] \"How, how.\"    Nay, ivy, nay,     It shall not be, I wis;   Let holly have the mastery,     As the manner is.   FOOTNOTES:  [P] Chapped skin.

I come from hevin to tell   The best nowellis that ever befell;   To you this tythinges trew I bring,   And I will of them say and sing:    This day to yow is borne ane childe   Of Marie meike and Virgine mylde,   That blessit barne, bining and kynde,   Sall yow rejoyce baith heart and mynd.

But I sall praise Thee evermoir   With sangs sweit unto Thy gloir,   The knees of my hert sall I bow,   And sing that right Balululow.     CHRISTMAS MINSTRELSY.     The minstrels played their Christmas tune   To-night beneath my cottage eaves;   While smitten by a lofty moon,   The encircling laurels thick with leaves,   Gave back a rich and dazzling sheen,   That overpowered their natural green.    Through hill and valley every breeze   Had sunk to rest with folded wings:   Keen was the air, but could not freeze   Nor check the music of the strings;   So stout and hardy were the band   That scraped the chords with strenuous hand.    And who but listened?--till was paid   Respect to every inmate's claim,   The greeting given, the music played   In honor of each household name,   Duly pronounced with lusty call,   And a merry Christmas wished to all.    O Brother! I revere the choice   That took thee from thy native hills;   And it is given thee to rejoice:   Though public care full often tills   (Heaven only witness of the toil)   A barren and ungrateful soil.    Yet would that thou, with me and mine,   Hadst heard this never-failing rite;   And seen on other faces shine   A true revival of "]]]
