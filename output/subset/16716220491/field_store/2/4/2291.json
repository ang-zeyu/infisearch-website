The chapel had a chapter-house attached, and seems to have been a well-cared-for building. There were several chantry chapels and a high altar dedicated to St. Giles. St. Giles's in the earlier charters is spoken of as a village, not a parish, but there is little doubt that after the establishment of the hospital its chapel was used as a parish church by the villagers. There was probably a wall screening off the lepers. The first church of which any illustration is preserved has a curious tower, capped by a round dome. The view of this church, dated 1560, is taken after the dissolution of the hospital, when it had become entirely parochial. In 1617 the quaint old tower was taken down, and replaced by another, but only six years after the whole church was rebuilt. A view of this in 1718 gives a very long battlemented body in two stories, with a square tower surmounted by an open belfry and vane. It possessed remarkably fine stained-glass windows and a handsome screen presented by the Duchess of Dudley.  This second church did not last very long, for in Queen Anne's reign the parishioners petitioned that it should be rebuilt as one of the fifty new churches, being then in a state of decay. The present church, which is very solid, and has dignity of outline, was the work of Flitcroft, and was opened April 14, 1734. The steeple is 160 feet high, with a rustic pedestal, a Doric story, an octagonal tower, and spire. The basement is of rusticated Portland stone, of which the church is built, and quoins of the same material decorate the windows and angles within. It follows the lines of the period, with hardly any chancel, wide galleries on three sides standing on piers, from which columns rise to the elliptical ceiling. The part of the roof over the galleries is bayed at right angles to the curve of the central part. Monuments hang on the walls and columns, and occupy every available space. By far the most striking of these is the full-length figure of a woman in repose which is set on a broad window-seat. This is the monument of Lady Frances Kniveton, daughter of Alice Leigh, Duchess of Dudley. The daughter's tomb remains a memorial of her mother's benefactions to the parish. The monument of Andrew Marvell, a plain black marble slab, is on the north wall. Marvell was buried in the church \"under the pews in the south side,\" but the present monument was not erected until 1764, eighty-six years after his death, owing to the opposition of the incumbent of the church. The inscription on it slightly varies from that intended for the original monument. Besides a handsome brass cross on the chancel floor to the Rector, Canon Nisbett, a tomb in form of a Roman altar, designed by Inigo Jones, and commemorating George Chapman, the translator of Homer, and a touching monument in the lobby to \"John Belayse,\" put up by his two daughters, there is nothing further worth seeing.  The graveyard which surrounds the church is supposed to have been the ancient interment-ground of the hospital. The first mention of it in the parish books is in 1628, when three cottages were pulled down to increase its size. It was enlarged again in 1666. Part of the old hospital wall enclosing it remained until 1630, when it fell down, and after the lapse of some time a new wall was built. In St. Giles's Churchyard were buried Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Shirley, Roger L'Estrange, Andrew Marvell, and Richard Pendrell, who assisted in Charles II.'s escape; his altar-tomb is easily seen near the east end of the church. By 1718 the graveyard had risen 8 feet, so that the church stood in a pit or well. The further burial-ground at St. Pancras was taken in 1805, and after that burials at St. Giles's were not very frequent. Pennant was one of the first to draw attention to the disgraceful overcrowding of the old graveyard. There seem to have been several gates into the churchyard with the right of private entry, one of which was used by the Duchess of Dudley. The most remarkable gate, however, was at the principal entrance to the churchyard, and was known as the Resurrection Gate, from an alto-relievo of the Last Day. This was erected about 1687, and was of red and brown brick. The composition of the relievo is said to have been borrowed, with alterations, from Michael Angelo's work on the same subject. In 1765 the north wall of the churchyard was taken down, and replaced by the present railing and coping. In 1800 the gate was removed, and replaced by the present Tuscan gate, in which the sculpture has been refixed. This stood at first on the site of the old one on the north of the churchyard, but was removed to the west side, where it at present stands in an unnoticeable and obscure position. It was probably placed there in the idea that the new road, Charing Cross Road, would run past.  Denmark Street \"fronts St. Giles Church and falls into Hog Lane, a fair broad street, with good houses well inhabited by gentry\" (Strype).  This description is no longer applicable. Denmark Place was once Dudley Court, and the house here with a garden was given by the Duchess of Dudley as a rectory for the parish. The Court or Row was built on the site of the house previous to 1722.  Broad Street is one of the most ancient streets in the parish, and there were a few houses standing on the north side when the rest of the district was open ground. It was the main route westward for many centuries, until New Oxford Street was made.  The procession from Newgate to Tyburn used to pass along Broad Street, and halt at the great gate of the hospital, in order that the condemned man might take his last draught of ale on earth. An enterprising publican set up a tavern near here in 1623, and called it the Bowl. He provided the ale free, and no doubt made much profit by the patronage he received thereby. The exact site of the tavern was in Bowl Yard, which ran into Broad Street near where Endell Street now is. Among Cruikshank's well-known drawings is a series illustrating Jack Sheppard's progress to the gallows.  The parish almshouses were built in the wide part of Broad Street on ground granted by Lord Southampton, but were removed as an impediment to traffic in 1783 to the Coal Yard, near the north of Drury Lane. A row of little alleys--Salutation, Lamb's, Crown, and Cock--formerly extended southward over the present workhouse site. There are still one or two small entries both north and south. The immense yard of a well-known brewery fills up a large part of the south side, and a large iron and hardware manufactory on the north gives a certain manufacturing aspect to the street. The Holborn Municipal Baths are in a fine new building on the south side.  About High Street, which joins Broad Street at its west end, there is surely less to say than of any other High Street in London. In 1413 the gallows were set up at the corner where it meets Tottenham Court Road. But even previously to this executions had taken place at Tyburn, and soon Tyburn became the recognised place of execution. Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, is the most notable name among the victims who suffered at St. Giles. He was hung in chains and roasted to death over a slow fire at this spot as a Lollard.  After they had been removed from the end of Broad Street, to make way for the almshouses, the parish pound and cage stood on the site of the gallows until 1765. There was here also a large circular stone, where the charity boys were whipped to make them remember the parish bounds.  The space to the north of the High and Broad Streets was previously a notorious rookery. Dyott Street, which still exists, though cut in half, had a most unenviable reputation. The Maidenhead Inn, which stood at the south-east corner of this, was a favourite resort for mealmen and country waggoners. There was in this street also a tavern called the Turk's Head, where Haggart Hoggarty planned the murder of Mr. Steele on Hounslow Heath in 1802. Walford mentions also Rat's Castle, a rendezvous for all the riff-raff of the neighbourhood. Dyott Street was named after an influential parishioner of Charles II.'s time, who had a house here. It was later called George Street, but has reverted to the original name.  South of Great Russell Street there were formerly Bannister's Alley and Eagle and Child Yard running northwards. From the former of these continued Church Lane, to which Maynard Lane ran parallel. Bainbridge, Buckridge, and Church Streets ran east and westward. Of these Bainbridge remains, a long, narrow alley bounded by the brewery wall. Mayhew says that here \"were found some of the most intricate and dangerous places in this low locality.\"  The part of the parish lying to the north, including Bedford Square, must be for the present left (see p. 98), while we turn southwards.  New Compton Street is within the former precincts of the hospital. When first made it was called Stiddolph Street, after Sir Richard Stiddolph, and the later name was taken from that of Sir Frances Compton. Strype says, \"All this part was very meanly built ... and greatly inhabited by French, and of the poorer sort,\" a character it retains to this day.  Shaftesbury Avenue, opened in 1885, has obliterated Monmouth Street, named after the Duke of Monmouth, whose house was in Soho Square (see _The Strand_, this series). Monmouth Street was notorious for its old-clothes shops, and is the subject of one of the \"Sketches by Boz.\" Further back still it was called Le Lane, and is under that name mentioned among the hospital possessions.  The north end of Shaftesbury Avenue is in the adjoining parish of St. George's, Bloomsbury, but must for sequence' sake be described here. A French Protestant chapel, consecrated 1845, which is the lineal descendant of the French Church of the Savoy, stands on the west side. Near at hand is a French girls' school. Further north is a Baptist chapel, with two noticeable pointed towers and a central wheel window."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21412"],["title","The Tale of Bobby Bobolink (#1)"],["body"," with still another.\"  Mr. Meadowlark looked a bit troubled.  \"I liked the black one--the black one with the white and buff trimmings,\" he remarked. \"It was very becoming to Bobby Bobolink. I was hoping he'd wear one like it this summer.\"  \"Wait!\" was Mr. Red-winged Blackbird's mysterious answer. \"Wait! And I promise you won't be disappointed.\"  \"Anyhow, he sings as well as ever,\" Mr. Meadowlark declared.     IV  SINGING FOR SOME ONE   THE first few days of early May had passed and with them had flitted--somewhere--most of the jolly company in which Bobby Bobolink had journeyed from the South. But a few of those merrymakers had stayed--as Bobby did--in Farmer Green's meadow. They had made up their minds to spend the summer in Pleasant Valley.  Even old Mr. Crow, who was no lover of music, had to admit that he had never heard such bursts of song during all the summers he had spent in the neighborhood. It seemed as if Bobby Bobolink and his companions were trying their best to out-sing one another, though nobody knew why they should do that.  But at last somebody discovered the reason. That rowdy of the woods, Jasper Jay, spied upon the harum-scarum singers one day, when they were all but bursting themselves in a frenzy of song. And he saw that they were giving what Jasper called \"a serenade.\"  They were singing not for themselves but for a dull, yellowish-brown lady of their own sort, who had not arrived from the South until Bobby and his friends had been frolicking about the meadow almost a week.  She seemed a shy creature--this young person--preferring to stay on the ground during the serenade. But Bobby Bobolink and his companions were bold as brass. Often they alighted on the ground near her, as if they thought she could not hear their songs well enough when they skimmed through the air over the grassy meadow. Amid such a jingling and tinkling of notes it was no wonder that the little lady acted somewhat confused.  Jasper Jay, who was almost as great a gossip as Mr. Crow, told everybody in the neighborhood that he had never heard such a hubbub. But then, like his cousin Mr. Crow, Jasper was not a lover of music. And it was true that sprightly Bobby Bobolink and his dashing friends made no attempt to sing together. To be sure, they sang all at the same time; but each one of them sang his own song in his own way, just as if his was the only one that was being sung.  They never tired of entertaining the lady. And whether the yellowish-brown person decided that Bobby Bobolink sang louder than the others, or whether she thought his singing was sweeter or gayer than that of his friends, nobody ever found out. Perhaps he managed to say something--in his song--that especially pleased her. Anyhow, it was only a short time before Bobby Bobolink was making such remarks as these to everybody in the meadow:  \"My wife says I have the quickest eye for a caterpillar that she ever saw!\" and \"Mrs. Bobolink and I expect to begin to build a new house at once!\"  Now, you might think that Bobby's friends, after all their singing for the little lady, would have felt quite glum. But they were not in the least downcast. Of course, Bobby Bobolink would not let them serenade his wife. Indeed he promptly chased them away as soon as he knew that he had won her.  But they were so light-hearted that they started right away to sing for another lady in another part of the meadow.  She was as like the first one as two peas in a pod. And Jasper Jay chuckled when he found out what was going on.  He said he didn't believe they knew the difference.     V  AN INVITATION   MR. MEADOWLARK was a great admirer of Bobby Bobolink. Much as he liked to sing himself, he often remained silent when Bobby's joyous music tinkled over the grass-tops in Farmer Green's meadow. And as Mr. Meadowlark was listening to one of Bobby's best songs one day an idea popped suddenly into his head. He liked this notion so well that he flew straight across the meadow to a thicket on the edge of the woods. And there in the undergrowth he found Buddy Brown Thrasher, who was exactly the person he was looking for.  \"I've come over to tell you about an idea of mine,\" Mr. Meadowlark announced. \"It's about Bobby Bobolink. You know he has come back to spend the summer here in Pleasant Valley. It seems to me he's in better voice than ever. And now that he is quite grown up--you know he has a wife--it seems to me that we couldn't do better than invite him to join the Pleasant Valley Singing Society.\"  Mr. Meadowlark had explained all this in a most eager manner. And he couldn't help being a bit disappointed over the way Buddy Brown Thrasher received it. He did not seem at all excited. To tell the truth, he was a suspicious chap. He never fell in quickly with a new plan, no matter what it might be. And more than once he had made matters somewhat difficult for the Pleasant Valley Singing Society. He was hard to please. Being a very brilliant singer himself, he was never what you might call keen to take in a new member.  When Mr. Meadowlark had told him about his idea Buddy Brown Thrasher gave a sharp whistle, \"Wheeu!\" That was the only remark he made.  \"What's the matter?\" Mr. Meadowlark inquired. \"Don't you like my scheme?\"  \"Oh! It's worth looking into, no doubt,\" Buddy told him. \"But I can't say offhand whether it's a good one or not.... Of course Bobby Bobolink would have to pass the test before we take him into the Singing Society.\"  \"If that's all that's troubling you, cheer up!\" Mr. Meadowlark cried. \"For Bobby Bobolink can pass the singing test as easily as flying.\"  \"I hope so,\" Buddy Brown Thrasher retorted. \"I promise you that I'll be present when Bobby sings before the Society. And if his singing isn't what it ought to be, you can depend on me to know it.\"  Well, Mr. Meadowlark couldn't object to that. So he told Buddy Brown Thrasher that his promise was fair enough. And then Mr. Meadowlark hurried away to call on other members of the Pleasant Valley Singing Society and tell them about his plan.  After he had seen and talked with every one, Mr. Meadowlark took it upon himself to go back to the meadow, where he found Bobby Bobolink still singing merrily. And for once Mr. Meadowlark couldn't wait for him to finish. For there was no knowing when Bobby would stop.  \"You're invited,\" said Mr. Meadowlark, \"to sing before the Pleasant Valley Singing Society. And if you can pass the test you'll become a member.\"  Bobby Bobolink was somewhat doubtful as he listened to Mr. Meadowlark's speech.  \"I'm afraid it will be difficult,\" he said.  \"Oh, no!\" Mr. Meadowlark assured him. \"You can pass the test easily enough.\"  But Bobby Bobolink told him that that wasn't what he meant.  \"I'm afraid,\" he explained, \"my wife may not consent!\"     VI  MRS. BOBOLINK CONSENTS   IT had never occurred to Mr. Meadowlark that Bobby Bobolink's wife might object to her husband's joining the Singing Society. But Bobby seemed doubtful.  \"I'll have to ask her,\" he said. \"You see, we're just about to build ourselves a house. And she may think I ought not to belong to any societies at present.\"  Just then little, yellowish-brown Mrs. Bobolink came skimming over the meadow and dropped down beside them.  \"Would you mind, my love, if I joined the Pleasant Valley Singing Society?\" Bobby asked her.  \"Perhaps you'd like to become a member yourself,\" Mr. Meadowlark suggested nervously.  But Mrs. Bobolink hastened to say that she wasn't musical. \"Of course I enjoy _hearing_ songs,\" she told him; \"but I'm not much of a singer myself.\"  \"Your husband is one of the best,\" Mr. Meadowlark told her hopefully.  \"Yes!\" she replied. \"And sometimes I think he spends almost too much of his time practicing.\"  \"Oh, I can sing and work at the same time,\" Bobby Bobolink declared. \"When we begin work on our new house I shall be singing most of the time.\"  \"How often does your Society meet?\" Mrs. Bobolink asked Mr. Meadowlark.  \"We have a little sing almost every fine day,\" he informed her. \"But your husband needn't come to every meeting--if he's too busy. And if necessary he can leave before our sings are finished--except when he takes the test.\"  \"The test!\" Mrs. Bobolink echoed. \"What's that?\"  Mr. Meadowlark explained that before becoming a member everybody had to sing before the Society. \"Those that don't sing well enough don't get in,\" he added. \"For instance, there's old Mr. Crow. His voice is too hoarse. So he doesn't belong to the Society.\"  Well, the moment she heard that, Mrs. Bobolink made up her mind at once.  \"My husband can pass any singing test that you can give him!\" she exclaimed. \"The idea of mentioning him and Mr. Crow in the same breath!\"  \"Pardon me!\" Mr. Meadowlark said hastily. \"I took several breaths just before I spoke about Mr. Crow.\" He hoped that he hadn't offended Bobby Bobolink's wife.  She wasn't really angry. But she was proud of her husband's voice. And she wanted Mr. Meadowlark to know it.  \"I wouldn't think of such a thing as not letting Bobby join your Society,\" she declared. \"And as soon as we've finished our new house he can go to every meeting you have, and stay till the end, too.\"  All this time Bobby Bobolink had been listening anxiously. And when he heard his wife's last remark he was so overjoyed that he sprang into the air and began to sing the happiest song he knew, while he darted back and forth above the heads of his wife and their caller.  \"Just listen to him!\" Mrs. Bobolink cried, with an air of pride. \"Can you beat that?\"  Mr. Meadowlark made a modest reply. He said that in his opinion Bobby Bobolink was the finest singer that had ever come to Pleasant Valley.  And Mrs. Bobolink was so pleased that she confessed she hoped her husband could take his test just as soon as possible.  \"He shall take it to-morrow!\" Mr. Meadowlark promised.     VII  PASSING THE TEST   THE time had come for Bobby Bobolink to sing before the Pleasant Valley Singing Society. Mr. Meadowlark brought Bobby to the "]]]
