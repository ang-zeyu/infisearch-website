If you want to find Grandfather Mole you must look beneath the surface.\"  The cat was greatly disappointed when she heard that.  \"You don't mean to say that he went into a hole, do you?\" she asked.  \"I do,\" Mr. Crow declared.  \"I don't see one anywhere,\" she said.  \"If I had I'd have been more careful how I let him run about.\"  \"Ah!\" said Mr. Crow. \"I see you don't know that Grandfather Mole always carries a hole around with him, wherever he goes. He believes in having one handy, in case of sudden need.\"  \"I didn't see it,\" the cat told him angrily.  \"Of course not!\" Mr. Crow agreed. \"How could you see a hole until it's put in a certain place, ready to use?\"  Well, the cat was puzzled. Somehow she couldn't quite understand Mr. Crow's remarks. And yet there seemed some sense in them, too. But she pretended that she understood, because she didn't want him to think she was stupid. And without thanking him for his explanation (for she was still angry) she turned and went off towards the meadow.  The whole affair amused Mr. Crow greatly. It kept him in a good humor all that day. And he went about telling everybody how Grandfather Mole had dug himself out of sight in the garden, almost under the cat's nose.  For that was exactly what had happened.     IV  A NEW WAY OF TAKING A STROLL   GRANDFATHER MOLE was digging a new gallery under the garden, leading out from his house into a field of corn, where he expected to find a good many fine grubs.  His work was half done, and he was under the cabbage-patch, when he found himself in the open air. Farmer Green's hired man's hoe had left a small hollow between two heads of cabbage; and as luck had it, Grandfather Mole's gallery led straight into it. So the first thing he knew, there he was right out in the light of early morning! And somebody called out in a cheery sort of voice, \"How-dy-do, Grandfather Mole! It's a pleasure to see you! And isn't this a beautiful day?\"  Grandfather Mole knew at once that he had nothing to fear, for he recognized Jimmy Rabbit's voice. And he knew, too, without being told, that he was in the cabbage-patch. For Jimmy Rabbit could be nowhere else at breakfast time.  \"Good morning!\" said Grandfather Mole. \"I hope you are enjoying your breakfast.\"  \"I am,\" Jimmy Rabbit answered. \"And as soon as I've finished this leaf I'm eating now, I'm going to take a stroll. Won't you join me?\"  \"I don't care if I do,\" said Grandfather Mole--meaning that he'd be glad to walk with Jimmy. And in about half a minute Jimmy Rabbit said he was ready.  \"Very well!\" Grandfather Mole told him. \"Let's be on our way! I'll see you at the edge of the duck-pond.\" And to Jimmy Rabbit's amazement he stuck his nose straight down into the loose dirt, thrust out his strong fore-feet, and was out of sight before Jimmy Rabbit could speak.  The duck-pond was just beyond the garden fence. And since Grandfather Mole had accepted Jimmy's invitation there was nothing for Jimmy Rabbit to do but to go to the edge of the pond and wait.  He grew very restless, for it was a long time before Grandfather Mole appeared. But at last the old gentleman's head came popping up out of the ground, and the owner of the head cried, \"Here I am! And I'm glad to see you haven't kept me waiting, young man. I dug so fast I was afraid I'd get here before you did.\"  Really, he had made astonishing speed for one who had tunnelled his way underground. And being a polite person, Jimmy Rabbit could only tell Grandfather Mole that he had been very quick.  \"And now we're this far,\" Grandfather Mole remarked, \"I'd like to stroll over in the meadow--if that suits you.\"  Jimmy Rabbit said that it did. There was clover in the meadow. And he had waited so long for Grandfather Mole that he had begun to feel hungry again. A luncheon of clover-tops! It would be exactly what he needed.  \"Then let's be on our way!\" Grandfather Mole cried again. \"I'll join you on the other side of the duck-pond!\"     V  JIMMY RABBIT CAN'T WAIT   AFTER telling Jimmy Rabbit that he would meet him on the other side of the duck-pond, Grandfather Mole waded into the water and started to swim across.  Why he did that, instead of walking around on the shore, Jimmy Rabbit couldn't understand. He was so amazed that he stood still and stared at Grandfather Mole.  One thing was certain: Grandfather Mole could travel much faster through the water than he could underground. His strong legs and his broad, spade-like feet helped to make him a fine swimmer. And Jimmy Rabbit had noticed for the first time that Grandfather Mole's hind feet were webbed. It was no wonder that he felt quite at home in the duck-pond, which was made for web-footed folk.  Jimmy Rabbit was so interested in watching Grandfather Mole swim that he didn't start to run around the pond until the swimmer had almost reached the other side. Then Jimmy remembered suddenly that he had to meet Grandfather Mole over there. So he raced along the edge of the duck-pond at top speed. And since he was a very fast runner--for short distances--he met Grandfather Mole just as the old chap was crawling up the bank.  \"There!\" Grandfather Mole exclaimed. \"I almost beat you this time, young man! If you're going to take a morning stroll with me you'll have to step lively.\"  Of course Jimmy Rabbit was too polite to explain that he had waited a long time while Grandfather Mole was tunnelling his way from the garden to the pond, and that he hadn't begun to run around the pond until Grandfather Mole had swum almost across it. He merely smiled and replied that he would do his best to keep up, for he shouldn't like to make Grandfather Mole wait, especially since he had invited Grandfather Mole to go walking with him.  \"You don't mind staying here in the sunshine, I hope, while my coat dries?\" Grandfather Mole inquired. \"As soon as it's dry we'll start for the meadow.\"  Though Jimmy Rabbit was in a great hurry to reach the place where the clover grew he said that he would be glad to wait with Grandfather Mole. \"The sun feels good on this cool morning,\" he observed. \"And it's cheerful, too.\"  \"Do you really think so?\" Grandfather Mole asked him. And when Jimmy Rabbit assured him that he did, Grandfather Mole muttered that it was the strangest thing he ever heard of. As for him, he much preferred the darkness of his cool, damp galleries under the ground. And the only reason why he wanted his coat to dry was so that the dirt wouldn't stick to it.  It seemed to Jimmy Rabbit that Grandfather Mole's coat would never get dry enough to suit the old gentleman. But at last he announced that he was ready to stroll on. And when Jimmy Rabbit cried that he was ready, too, Grandfather Mole said, \"Then let's be on our way! And I'll meet you----\"  \"Where the clover grows!\" Jimmy interrupted.  Grandfather Mole had already buried his nose in the sand and was fast digging himself out of sight. And Jimmy thought that if he must wait for him again he would wait in a pleasant place.  So Jimmy Rabbit hurried to the meadow. And as he lunched on luscious clover-tops he reflected that Grandfather Mole had a queer notion of taking a stroll with a friend. He made up his mind then and there that he would never again invite Grandfather Mole to walk with him.     VI  A HEARTY EATER   A GREAT eater was Grandfather Mole. And having an enormous appetite he was fortunate in being expert at finding angleworms.  To be sure, he had one advantage that the birds, for instance, didn't enjoy: he was able to prowl about his galleries through the ground and find the angleworms right where they lived. He didn't need to wait--as the birds did--until an angleworm stuck his head above ground.  Mrs. Jolly Robin had often wished--when she was trying to feed a rapidly-growing family--that she could hunt for angleworms as Grandfather Mole did. And this summer it seemed to her that she never would be able to take proper care of her nestful of children.  There was one of her family in particular that was especially greedy. Mrs. Robin had begun to suspect that he was no child of hers, but a young Cowbird. Almost as soon as she had finished building her nest she had discovered a strange-looking egg there. It had been the first to hatch. And now the youngster that came from it was just enough older than the rest of her children to jostle them, and to grab the biggest worms for himself.  It was no wonder that Mrs. Robin needed help. And seeing Grandfather Mole one morning, she explained her difficulty to him, asking if he wouldn't be so kind as to capture angleworms for her.  \"Why, certainly! Certainly!\" said Grandfather Mole.  And Mrs. Robin breathed a sigh of relief. She felt that her troubles were ended.  \"Will you begin to help me at once?\" she asked Grandfather Mole.  \"I'm sorry that I can't do that,\" he told her. \"You see, I haven't had my breakfast yet. So of course I must catch a few angleworms for myself.\"  Mrs. Robin was a bit disappointed. But she told Grandfather Mole that it was all right--that she knew a person of his age ought not to go without his breakfast.  So Grandfather Mole went back into the hole through which he had lately come up, first saying however that he would return after he had breakfasted.  Mrs. Robin then set to work herself, to find what she could to feed her clamoring family. Though she hurried as fast as she could, by the time the morning was almost half gone her children were still hungry; and to Mrs. Robin's distress Grandfather Mole had not yet showed himself again.  Mrs. Robin had been watching for him. And she had about given him up in despair when all at once he rose out of the ground.  \"Good!\" she cried. \"Now you can help me, for you must have had your breakfast by this time.\"  \"Yes, I have!\" said Grandfather Mole. \"I've just finished. But I always begin my luncheon at this hour. So if you don't mind I'll go down into my galleries and hunt for a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21203"],["title","The Tale of Grandfather Mole (#2)"],["body","angleworms; and when I've had a good meal I'll come back here.\"  Well, what could Mrs. Robin say? She nodded her head; and she hoped, as Grandfather Mole vanished, that perhaps he would eat only a light luncheon.  But he never reappeared until mid-afternoon. And since he announced then that he was ready to begin his dinner Mrs. Jolly Robin saw that she could expect no help from him whatsoever.  She was terribly upset. But there was nothing she could do except to tell her husband that he would have to spend all his time catching angleworms for the family. And since he was glad enough to do that, Mrs. Robin managed to feed her children all they needed. Even the young Cowbird in her nest had all he wanted.  And Mrs. Robin remarked that it was lucky her husband hadn't such a terrible appetite as some people's--meaning Grandfather Mole's, of course.     VII  TWO WORM-EATERS   THERE was one special reason--among others--why Grandfather Mole didn't like to show himself above ground in the daytime. This reason was--hawks! And there was something else that made him dislike to appear at night, too. This something else was--owls!  But of the two, Grandfather Mole disliked hawks the more, because they could see so far, while he (poor old fellow!) couldn't even see the end of his own nose, though goodness knows it was long enough! Since Henry Hawk could sit in a great elm far up the road and see him the moment he stuck his head out of the ground, while Grandfather Mole couldn't even see the tree, it was not surprising that Grandfather Mole preferred to stay below while Henry Hawk was awake and on watch.  Down in his galleries and chambers where it was dark as a pocket Grandfather Mole enjoyed himself thoroughly. It was lucky he was fond of worms and grubs. If he hadn't been it would be hard to say what he could have found to eat--unless it was dirt. There was plenty of that where he spent his time. But luckily he didn't have to eat it. He did enjoy digging in it, however. So it is easy to see that the way he lived suited him perfectly.  Not every one, of course, would have felt as Grandfather Mole did about angleworms, and grubs and dirt, or dampness, or the dark. Many of his bird neighbors, for instance, liked the same things to eat that he did. But most of them--except such odd ones as Solomon Owl, and Mr. Nighthawk, and Willie Whip-poor-will--loved the bright sunshine.  Spending a summer in Pleasant Valley was a small gentleman of the well known Warbler family, who had so great a liking for worms that he was known as the Worm-eating Warbler. This tiny person spent little or none of his time in the tree-tops, but chose to stay near the ground. And more than once he had seen Grandfather Mole in Farmer Green's garden. He had heard somehow of Grandfather Mole's tastes and habits. And he was inclined to believe that it was Grandfather Mole that was to blame for the scarcity of worms in the neighborhood. It must be confessed that he felt none too kindly towards Grandfather Mole. He thought that it would be a good thing if somebody could persuade that odd, old chap to stay on top of the ground, instead of lurking most of the time down below where he could catch the worms right where they lived.  And one day the Worm-eating Warbler spoke to Grandfather Mole when he happened to see him come out of a hole.  \"Why don't you live up here where you can get plenty of fresh air and sunshine?\" he asked. \"Don't you know they'd be good for your health?\"  Grandfather Mole turned his head toward the speaker. That was as near as he could come to staring at him, since he couldn't see him. Grandfather Mole did not like the Worm-eating Warbler's remarks in the least!  \"Why don't you\"--he inquired--\"why don't you come down into the ground and enjoy the close, damp air and the darkness? They'd be good for your health. I've thrived down below all my life; and I'm considerably older than you, young sir!\"  Grandfather Mole's retort struck the Worm-eating Warbler dumb. He could think of nothing more to say. So he flew off and hid in some raspberry bushes. And he couldn't help saying to himself what a strange world it was and what strange persons there were in it.     VIII  LOSING HIS BEARINGS   IT often happened, when Grandfather Mole came up from his home under Farmer Green's garden, that he turned straight around and went back again. Sometimes, to be sure, he ran about a bit in a bewildered way, before he disappeared. For he never felt at home in the world above; and he was always uneasy until he felt the darkness closing in around him.  So nobody thought it strange when Grandfather Mole came tumbling up amongst the turnips one day and began running blindly around the garden, zig-zagging in every direction. Nobody that saw him paid much attention to him. But at last Rusty Wren, who had come to the garden to look for worms, noticed that Grandfather Mole was quite upset over something. He didn't seem to have any notion of going back into the ground, but kept twisting this way and that, with his long nose turning here and turning there, in a manner that was unmistakably inquiring.  \"What's the matter?\" Rusty Wren finally asked him, for his curiosity soon got the better of him.  But Grandfather Mole didn't appear to hear. Perhaps he didn't want to answer the question.  \"Have you lost something?\" Rusty Wren cried.  But Grandfather Mole never stopped to reply. He never stopped running to and fro. And Rusty Wren became more curious than ever. It was plain, to him, that something unusual was afoot. And he wanted to know what it was. \"Can't I help you?\" he asked in his shrillest tones, flying close to Grandfather Mole and speaking almost in his ear--only Grandfather Mole had no ears, so far as Rusty Wren could see. \"Can't I help you?\"  \"Yes, you can!\" Grandfather Mole answered at last. \"If you wish to help me, for pity's sake go away and keep still! I don't want the whole neighborhood to come a-running. The cat will be here the first thing we know.\"  Rusty Wren felt sure, then, that Grandfather Mole was in trouble. And if he was worried about Farmer Green's cat, why didn't he dig a hole for himself at once, and get out of harm's way?  Since Rusty Wren didn't know, he asked Grandfather Mole--in little more than a whisper. But Grandfather Mole only shook his head impatiently, as if to say that digging a hole wouldn't help him this time.  Meanwhile some of Rusty Wren's friends had come up to see what was going on. And talking in low tones, so that they wouldn't attract the cat's attention, they agreed with him that there was some mystery about Grandfather Mole. But not one of them knew what it could be.  \"He's lost something!\" Rusty Wren declared.  \"There's no doubt of that,\" Jolly Robin chimed in.  \"What can it be?\" little Mr. Chippy piped in his thin voice.  \"I know!\" Rusty Wren exclaimed abruptly. \"It's his bearings! Grandfather Mole has lost his bearings!\"     IX  GOOD NEWS FROM BELOW   WHEN Rusty Wren decided that Grandfather Mole had lost his bearings and that that was the reason why he was running about the garden in a most peculiar fashion, the rest of the birds began to wonder whether they oughtn't to help Grandfather Mole find them, since he was blind.  The Worm-eating Warbler, however, who was none too friendly towards Grandfather Mole, said that he had his doubts as to Grandfather Mole's blindness.  \"If he can find angleworms in the dark he certainly ought to be able to find his bearings in broad daylight,\" he sneered.  But Rusty Wren pointed out that nobody could _see_ bearings, anyhow--a remark that puzzled the Worm-eating Warbler more than a little. To tell the truth, he had no idea what bearings were. And at last he admitted that he didn't know.  \"What are bearings, anyhow?\" he asked Rusty Wren. \"I don't understand what you mean.\"  \"Oh, I mean that Grandfather Mole has lost his way,\" Rusty Wren explained. \"He doesn't know how to get home.\"  The Worm-eating Warbler asked why Grandfather Mole didn't dig a new hole for himself, if he had lost the one he used when he came up in the garden. And when he saw that Rusty Wren couldn't answer his question the Worm-eating Warbler said he had his doubts as to Rusty Wren's ideas about Grandfather Mole.  \"It's my opinion,\" he went on, \"that Grandfather Mole has eaten all the worms that lived in the ground; and now he's hoping to find some in the air.\"  Although everybody laughed at such a notion, the Worm-eating Warbler declared that he had a right to his own belief. And when he added that he hadn't seen an angleworm for two days there were a few of his bird companions that began to think perhaps there was some reason in his remarks, after all.  But Rusty Wren declined to change his opinion.  \"There's only one way to be sure; and that's to ask Grandfather Mole!\" little Mr. Chippy cried.  \"It wouldn't do any good,\" Rusty told him. \"Grandfather Mole won't answer any questions. But he's in some sort of trouble. There's no doubt of that.\"  They looked down at Grandfather Mole, who was still scurrying frantically about the garden. If he heard their talk he did nothing to let them know it. And they had begun to think that they would never know his secret when a person who looked somewhat like Grandfather Mole thrust her head and shoulders out of a hole in the ground.  \"That\"--Rusty Wren whispered--\"that is Grandfather Mole's daughter. I know, for I've seen her before.\" And listening sharply, the bird people heard her say, \"Don't worry, Father! I've found them.\"  Grandfather Mole didn't wait for anything more. He didn't even wait until he had found the opening in which his daughter had appeared. He began to dig right where he stood. And he was out of sight in short order.  Although the bird people didn't know it, he was anxious to reach his grandchildren. He had them out for a stroll through his underground galleries; and walking behind him they had taken a wrong turn when Grandfather Mole didn't know it."]]]
