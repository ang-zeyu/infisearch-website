At last towards the afternoon of that day, while performing a furious charge round the room with baby on his head, he overturned the wash-tub, which filled the baby with delirious joy, and Gertie with pleasurable alarm.  As for Mrs Marrot, she was too happy to have her husband at home for a whole day to care much about trifles, nevertheless she felt it her duty to reprove him, lest the children should learn a bad lesson.  \"There now, John, I knew you'd do it at last.  You're much too violent, and you shouldn't ought to risk the baby's neck in that way.  Such a mess!  How _can_ you expect me to keep things tidy if you go on so?\"  John was very penitent.  He did not reply at first, but putting baby into the crib--where it instantly drowned with a great yell the shriek of a passing train--he went down on his knees and began to \"swab\" up the water with a jack-towel.  Loo ran laughingly from the corner where she had been sewing, and insisted on doing it for him.  \"You'll hurt your leg, father, if you bend it so, and I'm sure it must be swelled and pained enough already with so much romping.\"  \"Not a bit, Loo,\" objected John.  \"It was me as caused the mess, an' justice requires that I should swab it up.  There, go sew that sentiment into a sampler an' hang it up over yer bed.\"  But Loo would not give in.  While they were still engaged in the controversy the door opened, and young Bob Marrot stood before them with his eyes wide open and his hair straight up on end, as if he had recently seen a ghost.  This aspect, however, was no sign of alarm, being his normal condition.  \"Ha! seems to me, somehow, that somebody's bin up to somethin'.\"  \"Right Bob,\" replied his father, rising from his knees and throwing the jack-towel at him.  The lad easily evaded the shot, being well accustomed to elude much more deadly missiles, and, picking up the towel, quietly set to work to perform the duty in dispute.  \"You're wanted,\" he said, looking up at his father while he wrung the towel over a tin basin.  \"Eh!  Where?\"  \"Up at the shed.\"  \"I'm on sick leave,\" said John.  \"Can't help that.  The 6:30 p.m. passenger train must be drove, and there's nobody left but you to drive it.  Jones is away with a goods train owin' to Maxwell having sprained his ankle, and Long Thompson is down with small-pox, so you'll have to do it.  I offered 'em my services, but the manager he said that intelligent lads couldn't be spared for such menial work, and told me to go and fetch you.\"  \"Maxwell had no business to sprain his ankle,\" said John Marrot. \"Hows'ever,\" he added cheerfully, \"I've had a rare good holiday, an' the leg's all but right again, so, Molly, let's have an early tea; I'll give it a good rest for another half-hour and then be ready for the 6:30 p.m-ers.  Cut off your steam, will you?\"  This last observation was made to the baby, and was accompanied by a shake and a toss towards the ceiling which caused him to obey instantly, under the impression, no doubt that the fun was to be renewed.  Being, however, consigned to the care of Gertie he again let on the steam and kept it up during the whole time the family were at tea--which meal they enjoyed thoroughly, quite regardless of the storm.  He was asleep when his father rose at last and buttoned his heavy coat up to the chin, while Mrs Marrot stood on tiptoe to arrange more carefully the woollen shawl round his neck.  \"Now, don't stand more than you can help on your hurt leg, John.\"  \"Certainly not, duckie,\" said John, stooping to kiss the upturned face; \"I'll sit on the rail as much as I can, like a 'Merican racoon.  By the way,\" he added, turning suddenly to Loo, \"you delivered that note from young Mr Tipps to his mother?\"  \"Yes, immediately after I got it from you; and I waited to see if there was an answer, but she said there wasn't.  It must have contained bad news, I fear, for she turned pale while she read it.\"  \"H'm, well,\" said John, putting on his cap, \"don't know nothin' about what was in it, so it's no bizzness o' mine.\"  With a hearty good-evening to all, and a special embrace to Gertie, the engine-driver left his home, accompanied by Bob his hopeful son.  \"Mr Sharp,\" said Bob, as they walked along, \"has bin makin' oncommon partikler inquiries among us about some o' the porters.  I raither think they're a bad lot.\"  \"Not at all,\" replied his father severely.  \"They're no more a bad lot than the drivers, or, for the matter of that, than the clerks or the directors, or the lamp-boys.  You ought to be gittin' old enough by this time, Bob, to know that every lot o' fish in this world, however good, has got a few bad uns among 'em.  As a rule railway directors and railway clerks, and railway porters and railway officials of all sorts are good--more or less--the same may be said of banks an' insurances, an' all sorts of things--but, do what ye may, a black sheep or two _will_ git in among 'em, and, of course, the bigger the consarn, the more numerous the black sheep.  Even the clergy ain't free from that uniwersal law of natur.  But what's Mr Sharp bin inquiring arter?\"  \"Ah--wot indeed!\" replied Bob; \"'ow should I know?  Mr Sharp ain't the man to go about the line with a ticket on his back tellin' wot he's arter.  By no means.  P'lice superintendents ain't usually given to that; but he's arter _somethin'_ partickler.\"  \"Well, that ain't no bizzness of ours, Bob, so we don't need to trouble our heads about it.  There's nothin' like mindin' yer own bizzness. Same time,\" added John after a short pause, \"that's no reason why, as a sea-farin' friend o' mine used to say, a man shouldn't keep his weather-eye open, d'ye see?\"  Bob intimated that he did see, by winking with the eye that chanced to be next his parent; but further converse between father and son was interrupted at a turn in the road, where they were joined by a stout, broad-shouldered young man, whose green velveteen jacket vest, and trousers bespoke him a railway porter.  \"Evenin', Sam,\" said our driver with a friendly nod; \"goin' on night dooty, eh?\"  \"Yes, worse luck,\" replied Sam, thrusting his powerful hands into his pockets.  \"Why so, Sam, you ain't used to mind night dooty?\"  \"No more I do,\" said Sam testily, \"but my missus is took bad, and there's no one to look after her properly--for that old 'ooman we got ain't to be trusted.  'Tis a hard thing to have to go on night dooty when a higher dooty bids me stay at home.\"  There was a touch of deep feeling in the tone in which the latter part of Sam Natly's remark was uttered.  His young wife, to whom he had been only a year married, had fallen into bad health, and latterly the doctors had given him little encouragement to hope for her recovery.  \"Sam,\" said John Marrot stopping, \"I'll go an' send a friend, as I knows of, to look after yer wife.\"  \"A friend?\" said Sam; \"you can't mean any o' your own family, John, for you haven't got time to go back that length now, and--\"  \"Well, never mind, I've got time to go where I'm agoin'.  You run on to the shed, Bob, and tell Garvie that I'll be there in fifteen minutes.\"  The engine-driver turned off abruptly, and, increasing his pace to a smart walk, soon stood before the door of one of those uncommonly small neat suburban villas which the irrigating influence of the Grand National Trunk Railway had caused to spring up like mushrooms around the noisy, smoky, bustling town of Clatterby--to the unspeakable advantage of that class of gentlefolk who possess extremely limited incomes, but who, nevertheless, prefer fresh air to smoke.  \"Is your missus at 'ome?\" he inquired of the stout elderly woman who answered to his modest summons--for although John was wont to clatter and bang through the greater part of his daily and nightly career, he was tender of touch and act when out of his usual professional beat.  \"Yes; do you wish to see her?\"  \"I does, my dear.  Sorry I 'aven't got a card with me, but if you'll just say that it's John Marrot, the engine-driver, I dessay that'll do for a free pass.\"  The elderly woman went off with a smile, but returned quickly with an anxious look, and bade the man follow her.  He was ushered into a small and poorly furnished but extremely neat and clean parlour, where sat a thin little old lady in an easy-chair, looking very pale.  \"Ev'nin', ma'am,\" said John, bowing and looking rougher and bigger than usual in such a small apartment.  \"You--you--don't bring bad news, I hope!--my son Joseph--\"  \"Oh no, Mrs Tipps, not by no means,\" said Marrot, hasting to relieve the timid old lady's feelings, \"Mr Joseph is all right--nothing wotiver wrong with him--nor likely to be, ma'am.  Leastwise he wos all right w'en I seed 'im last.\"  \"And when might that be?\" asked the timid old lady with a sigh of relief as she clasped her hands tightly together.  \"W'y, let me see,\" said John, touching his forehead, \"it was yesterday evenin' w'en I came up with the northern express.\"  \"But many accidents might have happened since yesterday evening,\" said Mrs Tipps, still in an anxious tone.  \"That's true, ma'am.  All the engines on the Grand Trunk from the Pentland Firth to the Channel might have bu'sted their bilers since that time--but it ain't likely,\" replied John, with a bland smile.  \"And--and what was my son doing when you passed him?  Did you speak to him?\"  \"Speak to him!  Bless your heart, ma'am,\" said John, with another benignant smile, \"I went past Langrye station at sixty mile an hour, so we hadn't much chance to speak to each other.  It would have been as much as we could have managed, if we'd tried it, to exchange winks.\"  \"Dreadful!\" exclaimed Mrs Tipps in a low tone.  \"Is that the usual rate of travelling on your railway?\"  \"Oh dear no, ma'am.  It's only _my_ express train as goes at that rate. Other expresses run between forty and fifty miles, an' or'nary"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21741"],["title","The Island Queen (#1)"],["body"," by that time.  He restrained himself, however, after a few minutes.  \"Hold!  We must not indulge too freely.  It will hurt us after fasting so long.  Besides, this supply is very small, and must be made to last as long as possible.  No, my boy, you must eat no more at this time, but you may drink a little.\"  About a table-spoonful of water was measured out to each, and then the remainder of the food was carefully wrapped up and put away.  \"Do you think that this supply was hidden by one of the poor fellows who left us this morning?\" asked Pauline.  \"I think so; and no doubt his motive was a good one.  You know he was very fond of his messmate.  I should think he saved up his allowance to help him; but, whatever the motive, it has proved a blessing to us--\"  He ceased speaking, for both sister and little brother had drooped their weary heads, and were again in a heavy slumber.  Dominick himself felt intensely the desire to follow their example, but he resisted it, feeling that it was his duty to watch for the long-expected sail that never appeared.  At first his efforts were successful, but by degrees the tendency to sleep became so overpowering that his struggles were unavailing.  Sense of duty and every other motive gave way before it; his head finally dropped forward, and, with a heavy sigh of contentment, he followed his brother and sister to the land of Nod.  Profound, prolonged, and refreshing was that sweet slumber, after the first good meal these poor castaways had eaten for many days.  The weather fortunately continued bright and warm, so that they did not suffer so much from exposure as on previous days, and the gentle rocking of the boat tended to deepen and prolong their repose.  Thus they floated peacefully during the greater part of that day--the one solitary speck on the surface of the great ocean, for the albatross seemed to have finally forsaken them.  Towards noon a light westerly breeze sprang up.  It was not sufficient to raise a sea or disturb the sleepers, but, in conjunction with ocean currents, it drifted them to the south-east at a considerable rate, so that in the evening, without the aid of oar or sail, they were far from the spot upon the sea where we introduced them to the reader.  At last Dominick awoke with a long-drawn sigh, and, raising his head, looked over the side of the boat.  An exclamation of surprise and joy broke from him, for there, like a speck, where something like a heavy bank of clouds rested on the horizon, was the long-expected sail.  His first impulse was to awaken the sleepers, but he checked himself. He would look more carefully.  His eyes might be deceiving him, and the disappointment, if he should be mistaken, would be overwhelming.  He would spare them that.  Rising to his feet he shaded his eyes with one hand, and gazed long and earnestly.  The longer he looked, however, and the more he rubbed his eyes, the more convinced was he that a vessel was really in sight.  \"Pauline,\" he said at length, with suppressed emotion, as he gently shook her arm, \"see, God _has_ answered our prayers: a vessel is in sight!\"  The poor girl raised herself quickly, with an exclamation of thankfulness, and gazed intently in the direction pointed out.  \"It is, surely it is a ship,\" she said, \"but--but--don't you think there is something curious about its appearance?\"  \"I have indeed been puzzled during the last few minutes,\" replied Dominick.  \"It seems as if there were something strange under her, and her position, too, is rather odd.--Ho!  Otto, rouse up, my boy, and look at the vessel coming to save us.  Your eyes are sharp!  Say, d'you see anything strange about her?\"  Thus appealed to, Otto, who felt greatly refreshed by his good meal and long sleep, sat up and also gazed at the vessel in question.  \"No, Dom,\" he said at length; \"I don't see much the matter with her, except that she leans over on one side a good deal, and there's something black under and around her.\"  \"Can it be a squall that has struck her?\" said Pauline.  \"Squalls, you know, make ships lie over very much at times, and cause the sea round them to look very dark.\"  \"It may be so,\" returned Dominick doubtfully.  \"But we shall soon see, for a squall won't take very long to bring her down to us.\"  They watched the approaching vessel with intense eagerness, but did not again speak for a considerable time.  Anxiety and doubt kept them silent.  There was the danger that the vessel might fail to observe them, and as their oars had been washed away they had no means of hoisting a flag of distress.  Then there was the unaccountable something about the vessel's appearance, which puzzled and filled them with uncertainty.  At last they drew so near that Dominick became all too well aware of what it was, and a sinking of the heart kept him still silent for a time.  \"Brother,\" said Pauline at last in a sad voice, as she turned her dark eyes on Dominick, \"I fear it is only a wreck.\"  \"You are right,\" he replied gloomily; \"a wreck on a barren shore, too. Not a scrap of vegetation on it, as far as I can see--a mere sandbank. Currents are carrying us towards it, and have led us to fancy that the vessel was moving.\"  He spoke with bitterness, for the disappointment was very great, and physical weakness had rendered him less able to bear it than he might otherwise have been.  \"Don't get grumpy, Dom,\" said Otto, with a slightly humorous look that was peculiar to him--a look which had not lighted up his eyes for many days past.  \"I _won't_ get grumpy,\" returned Dominick with sudden energy, patting the boy's head.  \"It is quite clear that a good feed and a long rest were all you required to set up your plucky little spirit again.\"  \"Dom,\" said Pauline, who had been looking intently at the wreck, \"is there not something like a line of white close to the wreck?\"  \"Ay, there is,\" replied Dominick, his countenance again becoming grave; \"it is a line of breakers, through which it will be very difficult to steer our little boat.\"  \"Steer, Dom,\" exclaimed Otto, with a look of surprise; \"how can you talk of steering at all, without oar or helm?\"  \"I must make one of the floor-planks do for both,\" returned Dominick.  \"I say,\" continued the boy, \"I'm horribly hungry.  Mayn't I have just a bite or two more?\"  \"Stay, I'm thinking,\" replied the other.  \"Think fast then, please, for the wolf inside of me is howling.\"  The result of Dominick's thinking was that he resolved to consume as much of their stock of provisions as possible in one meal, in order to secure all the strength that was available by such means, and thus fit them for the coming struggle with the surf.  \"For,\" said he, \"if we get capsized far from the shore, we have no chance of reaching it by swimming in our present weak condition.  Our only plan is to get up all the strength we can by means of food.  So here goes!\"  He untied the bundle as he spoke, and spread the contents on his knees. Otto--who was, indeed, a plucky little fellow, and either did not realise or did not fear the danger that lay before him--commenced to eat with almost jovial avidity.  Indeed, all three showed that they had benefited greatly by what they had already eaten, and now, for the first time during many days, consumed what they considered a full and satisfactory meal, while they drifted slowly, but steadily, towards the land.  As they neared it, the heavy mass on the horizon, which they had taken for a bank of clouds, became more distinct.  A light haze cleared away and showed it to be an island, to which the sandbank formed a barrier reef; but any interest that might have been aroused by this discovery was absorbed by present anxiety, for the white and gleaming surf warned them that a serious and critical moment in their lives was fast approaching.  Pauline was awed into silence, and even Otto's countenance became gradually solemnised.    CHAPTER TWO.  WRECKED ON A REEF.  The coral reefs, which in various shapes and sizes stud the Southern seas, are sometimes rendered almost unapproachable by the immense waves which fall upon them.  Even in the calmest weather these huge breakers may be seen falling with prolonged roar on the beach.  The lightest undulation on the sea, which might almost escape observation away from land, takes the form of a grand, quiet billow as it draws near to an islet or reef, and finally, coming majestically on, like a wall of rolling crystal, breaks the silence suddenly by its thunderous fall, and gives to the sands a temporary fringe of pure white foam.  To ride in on the crest of one such roller on a piece of board and leap upon the shore, is a feat peculiar to South Sea islanders, who are trained to the water from earliest infancy.  To do the same thing in a small boat, without oars, without strength, without experience, almost without courage, is a feat that no South Sea islander would attempt, and the necessity for performing which might cause the hair of any islander's head to stand on end.  That Dominick Rigonda's hair did not stand on end, as he sat there with pale cheeks and compressed lips, was probably due to the fact that he had thrust his straw hat tightly down on his brows.  As the boat drew nearer to the reef, both Pauline and Otto had risen, in the strength of their hearty meal, and were now seated on the thwarts of the boat.  Their brother had selected the thickest floor-plank, and cut it roughly into the form of an oar with a clasp-knife.  He now sat with it over the stern, sculling gently--very gently, however, for he reserved the little strength that remained to him for the critical moment.  The undulations of the sea, which had rocked them hitherto so softly, had by that time assumed a decided form and force, so that the boat rose on the oily back of each billow that passed under it, and slid back into a watery hollow, to be relifted by each successive wave.  \"You look very anxious,\" said Pauline, clasping her hands on her knee, and gazing earnestly in"]]]
