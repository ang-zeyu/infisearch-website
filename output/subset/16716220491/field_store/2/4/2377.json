Inconsiderate recklessness was one of his chief characteristics, so that his comrades were rather afraid of him on the war-trail or in the hunt, where caution, and frequently _soundless_ motion, were essential to success or safety.  But when Henri had a comrade at his side to check him he was safe enough, being humble-minded and obedient.  Men used to say he must have been born under a lucky star, for, notwithstanding his natural inaptitude for all sorts of backwoods life, he managed to scramble through everything with safety, often with success, and sometimes with credit.  To see Henri stalk a deer was worth a long day's journey.  Joe Blunt used to say he was \"all jints together, from the top of his head to the sole of his moccasin.\"  He threw his immense form into the most inconceivable contortions, and slowly wound his way, sometimes on hands and knees, sometimes flat, through bush and brake, as if there was not a bone in his body, and without the slightest noise.  This sort of work was so much against his plunging nature, that he took long to learn it, but when, through hard practice and the loss of many a fine deer, he came at length to break himself in to it, he gradually progressed to perfection, and ultimately became the best stalker in the valley.  This, and this alone, enabled him to procure game, for, being short-sighted, he could hit nothing beyond fifty yards, except a buffalo or a barn door.  Yet that same lithe body, which seemed as though totally unhinged, could no more be bent, when the muscles were strung, than an iron post.  No one wrestled with Henri unless he wished to have his back broken.  Few could equal and none could beat him at running or leaping except Dick Varley.  When Henri ran a race even Joe Blunt laughed outright, for arms and legs went like independent flails.  When he leaped, he hurled himself into space with a degree of violence that seemed to insure a somersault--yet he always came down with a crash on his feet.  Plunging was Henri's forte.  He generally lounged about the settlement, when unoccupied, with his hands behind his back, apparently in a reverie, and when called on to act, he seemed to fancy he must have lost time, and could only make up for it by _plunging_.  This habit got him into many awkward scrapes, but his herculean power as often got him out of them. He was a French-Canadian, and a particularly bad speaker of the English language.  We offer no apology for this elaborate introduction of Henri, for he was as good-hearted a fellow as ever lived, and deserves special notice.  But to return.  The sort of rifle practice called \"driving the nail,\" by which this match was to be decided, was, and we believe still is, common among the hunters of the far west.  It consisted in this,--an ordinary large-headed nail was driven a short way into a plank or a tree, and the hunters, standing at a distance of fifty yards or so, fired at it until they succeeded in driving it home.  On the present occasion the major resolved to test their shooting by making the distance seventy yards.  Some of the older men shook their heads.  \"It's too far,\" said one; \"ye might as well try to snuff the nose o' a mosquito.\"  \"Jim Scraggs is the only man as'll hit that,\" said another.  The man referred to was a long, lank, lantern-jawed fellow with a cross-grained expression of countenance.  He used the long, heavy, Kentucky rifle, which, from the ball being little larger than a pea, was called a pea-rifle.  Jim was no favourite, and had been named Scraggs by his companions on account of his appearance.  In a few minutes the lots were drawn, and the shooting began.  Each hunter wiped out the barrel of his piece with his ramrod as he stepped forward; then, placing a ball in the palm of his left hand, he drew the stopper of his powder-horn with his teeth, and poured out as much powder as sufficed to cover the bullet.  This was the regular _measure_ among them.  Little time was lost in firing, for these men did not \"hang\" on their aim.  The point of the rifle was slowly raised to the object, and, the instant the sight covered it, the ball sped to its mark.  In a few minutes the nail was encircled by bullet-holes, scarcely two of which were more than an inch distant from the mark, and one--fired by Joe Blunt--entered the tree close beside it.  \"Ah, Joe!\" said the major, \"I thought you would have carried off the prize.\"  \"So did not I, sir,\" returned Blunt, with a shake of his head.  \"Had it a-bin a half-dollar at a hundred yards, I'd ha' done better, but I never _could_ hit the nail.  It's too small to _see_.\"  \"That's cos ye've got no eyes,\" remarked Jim Scraggs, with a sneer, as he stepped forward.  All tongues were now hushed, for the expected champion was about to fire.  The sharp crack of the rifle was followed by a shout, for Jim had hit the nail-head on the edge, and part of the bullet stuck to it.  \"That wins if there's no better,\" said the major, scarce able to conceal his disappointment.  \"Who comes next?\"  To this question Henri answered by stepping up to the line, straddling his legs, and executing preliminary movements with his rifle, that seemed to indicate an intention on his part to throw the weapon bodily at the mark.  He was received with a shout of mingled laughter and applause.  After gazing steadily at the mark for a few seconds, a broad grin overspread his countenance, and, looking round at his companions, he said--\"Ha! mes boys, I cannot behold de nail at all!\"  \"Can ye `behold' the _tree_?\" shouted a voice, when the laugh that followed this announcement had somewhat abated.  \"Oh! oui,\" replied Henri quite coolly; \"I can see _him_, an' a goot small bit of de forest beyond.\"  \"Fire at it, then.  If ye hit the tree ye desarve the rifle--leastwise ye ought to get the pup.\"  Henri grinned again, and fired instantly, without taking aim.  The shot was followed by an exclamation of surprise, for the bullet was found close beside the nail!  \"It's more be good luck than good shootin',\" remarked Jim Scraggs.  \"Possiblement,\" answered Henri modestly, as he retreated to the rear and wiped out his rifle; \"mais I have kill most of my deer by dat same goot luck.\"  \"Bravo!  Henri,\" said Major Hope as he passed; \"you _deserve_ to win, anyhow.  Who's next?\"  \"Dick Varley,\" cried several voices; \"where's Varley?  Come on, youngster, an' take yer shot.\"  The youth came forward with evident reluctance.  \"It's of no manner o' use,\" he whispered to Joe Blunt as he passed, \"I can't depend on my old gun.\"  \"Never give in,\" whispered Blunt encouragingly.  Poor Varley's want of confidence in his rifle was merited, for, on pulling the trigger, the faithless lock missed fire.  \"Lend him another gun,\" cried several voices.  \"'Gainst rules laid down by Major Hope,\" said Scraggs.  \"Well, so it is; try again.\"  Varley did try again, and so successfully, too, that the ball hit the nail on the head, leaving a portion of the lead sticking to its edge.  Of course this was greeted with a cheer, and a loud dispute began as to which was the better shot of the two.  \"There are others to shoot yet,\" cried the major.  \"Make way.  Look out.\"  The men fell back, and the few hunters who had not yet fired took their shots, but without coming nearer the mark.  It was now agreed that Jim Scraggs and Dick Varley, being the two best shots, should try over again; and it was also agreed that Dick should have the use of Blunt's rifle.  Lots were again drawn for the first shot, and it fell to Dick, who immediately stepped out, aimed somewhat hastily, and fired.  \"Hit again!\" shouted those who had run forward to examine the mark. \"_Half_ the bullet cut off by the nail-head!\"  Some of the more enthusiastic of Dick's friends cheered lustily, but the most of the hunters were grave and silent, for they knew Jim's powers, and felt that he would certainly do his best.  Jim now stepped up to the line, and, looking earnestly at the mark, threw forward his rifle.  At that moment our friend Crusoe--tired of tormenting his mother-- waddled stupidly and innocently into the midst of the crowd of men, and, in so doing, received Henri's heel and the full weight of his elephantine body on its fore-paw.  The horrible and electric yell that instantly issued from his agonised throat could only be compared, as Joe Blunt expressed it, \"to the last dyin' screech o' a bustin' steam biler!\"  We cannot say that the effect was startling, for these backwoodsmen had been born and bred in the midst of alarms, and were so used to them that a \"bustin' steam biler\" itself, unless it had blown them fairly off their legs, would not have startled them.  But the effect, such as it was, was sufficient to disconcert the aim of Jim Scraggs, who fired at the same instant, and missed the nail by a hair's-breadth.  Turning round in towering wrath, Scraggs aimed a kick at the poor pup, which, had it taken effect, would certainly have terminated the innocent existence of that remarkable dog on the spot, but quick as lightning Henri interposed the butt of his rifle, and Jim's shin met it with a violence that caused him to howl with rage and pain.  \"Oh! pardon me, broder,\" cried Henri, shrinking back, with the drollest expression of mingled pity and glee.  Jim's discretion, on this occasion, was superior to his valour; he turned away with a coarse expression of anger and left the ground.  Meanwhile the major handed the silver rifle to young Varley.  \"It couldn't have fallen into better hands,\" he said.  \"You'll do it credit, lad, I know that full well, and let me assure you it will never play you false.  Only keep it clean, don't overcharge it, aim true, and it will never miss the mark.\"  While the hunters crowded round Dick to congratulate him and examine the piece, he stood with a mingled feeling of bashfulness and delight at his unexpected good fortune.  Recovering himself suddenly he seized his old rifle, and, dropping quietly to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21729"],["title","Dusty Diamonds Cut and Polished: A Tale of City Arab Life and Adventure (#1)"],["body"," imperturbable serenity.  When, however, he suddenly beheld the street boy falling, and his daughter standing up in her wickerwork chariot, holding on to the brown pony like an Amazon warrior of ancient times, his maxim somehow evaporated.  His serenity vanished.  So did his hat as he bounded from beneath it, and left it far behind in his mad and hopeless career after the runaway.  A policeman, coming up just as Sir Richard disappeared, went to the assistance of the street boy.  \"Not much hurt, youngster,\" he said kindly, as he observed that the boy was very pale, and seemed to be struggling hard to repress his feelings.  \"Vell, p'raps I is an' p'raps I ain't, Bobby,\" replied the boy with an unsuccessful attempt at a smile, for he felt safe to chaff or insult his foe in the circumstances, \"but vether hurt or not it vont much matter to you, vill it?\"  He fainted as he spoke, and the look of half-humorous impudence, as well as that of pain, gave place to an expression of infantine repose.  The policeman was so struck by the unusual sight of a street boy looking innocent and unconscious, that he stooped and raised him quite tenderly in his arms.  \"You'd better carry him in here,\" said Sir Richard Brandon's butler, who had come out.  \"I saw it 'appen, and suspect he must be a good deal damaged.\"  Sir Richard's footman backing the invitation, the boy was carried into the house accordingly, laid on the housemaid's bed, and attended to by the cook, while the policeman went out to look after the runaways.  \"Oh! what ever shall we do?\" exclaimed the cook, as the boy showed symptoms of returning consciousness.  \"Send for the doctor,\" suggested the housemaid.  \"No,\" said the butler, \"send for a cab, and 'ave the boy sent home.  I fear that master will blame me for givin' way to my feelin's, and won't thank me for bringin' 'im in here.  You know he is rather averse to the lower orders.  Besides, the poor boy will be better attended to at 'ome, no doubt.  I dare say you'd like to go 'ome, wouldn't you?\" he said, observing that the boy was looking at him with a rather curious expression.  \"I dessay I should, if I could,\" he answered, with a mingled glance of mischief and pain, \"but if you'll undertake to carry me, old cock, I'll be 'appy to go.\"  \"I'll send you in a cab, my poor boy,\" returned the butler, \"and git a cabman as I'm acquainted with to take care of you.\"  \"All right! go a'ead, ye cripples,\" returned the boy, as the cook approached him with a cup of warm soup.  \"Oh! ain't it prime!\" he said, opening his eyes very wide indeed, and smacking his lips.  \"I think I'll go in for a smashed pin every day o' my life for a drop o' that stuff.  Surely it must be wot they drinks in 'eaven!  Have 'ee got much more o' the same on 'and?\"  \"Never mind, but you drink away while you've got the chance,\" replied the amiable cook; \"there's the cab coming, so you've no time to lose.\"  \"Vell, I _am_ sorry I ain't able to 'old more, an' my pockets wont 'old it neither, bein' the wuss for wear.  Thankee, missus.\"  He managed, by a strong effort, to dispose of a little more soup before the cab drew up.  \"Where do you live?\" asked the butler, as he placed the boy carefully in the bottom of the cab with his unkempt head resting on a hassock, which he gave him to understand was a parting gift from the housemaid.  \"Vere do I live?\" he repeated.  \"Vy, mostly in the streets; my last 'ome was a sugar barrel, the one before was a donkey-cart, but I do sometimes condescend to wisit my parents in their mansion 'ouse in Vitechapel.\"  \"And what is your name?  Sir Richard may wish to inquire for you-- perhaps.\"  \"May he?  Oh!  I'm sorry I ain't got my card to leave, but you just tell him, John--is it, or Thomas?--Ah!  Thomas.  I knowed it couldn't 'elp to be one or t'other;--you just tell your master that my name is Robert, better known as Bobby, Frog.  But I've lots of aliases, if that name don't please 'im.  Good-bye, Thomas.  Farewell, and if for ever, then-- you know the rest o' the quotation, if your eddication's not bin neglected, w'ich is probable it was.  Oh! by the way.  This 'assik is the gift of the 'ouse-maid?  You observe the answer, cabby, in case you and I may differ about it 'ereafter.\"  \"Yes,\" said the amused butler, \"a gift from Jessie.\"  \"Ah!--jus' so.  An' she's tender-'earted an' on'y fifteen.  Wots 'er tother name?  Summers, eh?  Vell, it's prettier than Vinters.  Tell 'er I'll not forget 'er.  Now, cabman--'ome!\"  A few minutes more, and Bobby Frog was on his way to the mansion in Whitechapel, highly delighted with his recent feast, but suffering extremely from his broken limb.  Meanwhile, the brown pony--having passed a bold costermonger, who stood shouting defiance at it, and waving both arms till it was close on him, when he stepped quickly out of its way--eluded a dray-man, and entered on a fine sweep of street, where there seemed to be no obstruction worth mentioning.  By that time it had left the agonised father far behind.  The day was fine; the air bracing.  The utmost strength of poor little Diana, and she applied it well, made no impression whatever on the pony's tough mouth.  Influences of every kind were favourable.  On the illogical principle, probably, that being \"in for a penny\" justified being \"in for a pound,\" the pony laid himself out for a glorious run. He warmed to his work, caused the dust to fly, and the clothes-basket to advance with irregular bounds and swayings as he scampered along, driving many little dogs wild with delight, and two or three cats mad with fear.  Gradually he drew towards the more populous streets, and here, of course, the efforts on the part of the public to arrest him became more frequent, also more decided, though not more successful.  At last an inanimate object effected what man and boy had failed to accomplish.  In a wild effort to elude a demonstrative cabman near the corner of one of the main thoroughfares, the brown pony brought the wheels of the vehicle into collision with a lamp-post.  That lamp-post went down before the shock like a tall head of grain before the sickle.  The front wheels doubled up into a sudden embrace, broke loose, and went across the road, one into a greengrocer's shop, the other into a chemist's window.  Thus diversely end many careers that begin on a footing of equality!  The hind-wheels went careering along the road like a new species of bicycle, until brought up by a donkey-cart, while the basket chariot rolled itself violently round the lamp-post, like a shattered remnant, as if resolved, before perishing, to strangle the author of all the mischief.  As to the pony, it stopped, and seemed surprised at first by the unexpected finale, but the look quickly changed--or appeared to change--to one of calm contentment as it surveyed the ruin.  But what of the fair little charioteer?  Truly, in regard to her, a miracle, or something little short of one, had occurred.  The doctrine that extremes meet contains much truth in it--truth which is illustrated and exemplified more frequently, we think, than is generally supposed. A tremendous accident is often much less damaging to the person who experiences it than a slight one.  In little Diana's case, the extremes had met, and the result was absolute safety.  She was shot out of her basket carriage after the manner of a sky-rocket, but the impulse was so effective that, instead of causing her to fall on her head and break her pretty little neck, it made her perform a complete somersault, and alight upon her feet.  Moreover, the spot on which she alighted was opportune, as well as admirably suited to the circumstances.  At the moment, ignorant of what was about to happen, police-constable Number 666--we are not quite sure of what division--in all the plenitude of power, and blue, and six-feet-two, approached the end of a street entering at right angles to the one down which our little heroine had flown.  He was a superb specimen of humanity, this constable, with a chest and shoulders like Hercules, and the figure of Apollo.  He turned the corner just as the child had completed her somersault, and received her two little feet fairly in the centre of his broad breast, driving him flat on his back more effectively than could have been done by the best prize-fighter in England!  Number 666 proved a most effectual buffer, for Di, after planting her blow on his chest, sat plump down on his stomach, off which she sprang in an agony of consternation, exclaiming--  \"Oh!  I have killed him!  I've killed him!\" and burst into tears.  \"No, my little lady,\" said Number 666, as he rose with one or two coughs and replaced his helmet, \"you've not quite done for me, though you've come nearer the mark than any _man_ has ever yet accomplished.  Come, now, what can I do for you?  You're not hurt, I hope?\"  This sally was received with a laugh, almost amounting to a cheer, by the half-horrified crowd which had quickly assembled to witness, as it expected, a fatal accident.  \"Hurt? oh! no, I'm not hurt,\" exclaimed Di, while tears still converted her eyes into blue lakelets as she looked anxiously up in the face of Number 666; \"but I'm quite sure you must be hurt--awfully.  I'm _so_ sorry!  Indeed I am, for I didn't mean to knock you down.\"  This also was received by the crowd with a hearty laugh, while Number 666 sought to comfort the child by earnestly assuring her that he was not hurt in the least--only a little stunned at first, but that was quite gone.  \"Wot does she mean by knockin' of 'im down?\" asked a small butcher's boy, who had come on the scene just too late, of a small baker's boy who had, happily, been there from the beginning.  \"She means wot she says,\" replied the small baker's boy with the dignified reticence of superior knowledge, \"she knocked the constable down.\"  \"Wot! a leetle gurl knock a six-foot bobby down?--walk-_er_!\"  \"Very good; you've no call to b'lieve it unless you like,\" replied the baker's boy, with a"]]]
