But he had another assistant-- Hugot.  Who was Hugot?  I shall describe Hugot for your benefit.  Hugot was a Frenchman--a very small Frenchman, indeed--not over five feet four inches in height.  He was dapper and tidy--had a large aquiline nose, and, notwithstanding his limited stature, a pair of tremendous moustachios, that curved over his mouth so as almost to hide it.  These gave him a somewhat fierce aspect, which, combined with his upright carriage, and brisk mechanical-like movements, told you at once what Hugot had been--a French soldier.  He was, in fact, a _ci-devant_ corporal of chasseurs.  Landi had been his colonel.  The rest you will easily guess.  He had followed his old leader to America, and was now his man for everything.  It was not often that you could see the naturalist without also seeing Hugot's great moustachios close by his elbow.  It would have killed Hugot to have been separated for any length of time from his old colonel.  Of course Hugot accompanied his master in all his hunting expeditions. So, too, did the boys, as soon as they were able to sit upon a horse. On these occasions the house would be shut up, for there was no housekeeper nor any other domestic about the establishment.  It would remain thus for days, sometimes for weeks together--for the naturalist with his party often made distant excursions into the surrounding forests.  They would return laden with spoils--skins of birds and beasts, plants, and rare geological specimens.  Then whole days would be spent in the arrangement of these new acquisitions.  Thus did Landi and his family pass their time.  Hugot was cook, valet, groom, butler, and errand boy.  I have already stated that no other domestic, male or female, lived in the house: Hugot, therefore, was chambermaid as well.  His manifold occupations, however, were not so difficult to fulfil as might at first appear.  The Colonel was a man of simple habits.  He had learned these when a soldier, and he brought up his sons to live like himself.  He ate plain food, drank only water, and slept upon a camp-bed with a buffalo-robe and a blanket.  A laundress in Point Coupee kept the linen clean; and Hugot was not near so busy with house affairs as you might suppose.  He made daily journeys to the village--to the market, and the post-office, from which he often brought letters, many of them with large seals, and the arms of a prince upon them!  Sometimes, too, after a steamer had called at the landing, parcels arrived containing books--scientific books they were--or curious instruments.  Notwithstanding all this, there was nothing mysterious about the life of the hunter-naturalist. He was no misanthrope.  He often visited the village, and would gossip with old hunters and others who lived there.  The villagers knew him as the \"old Colonel,\" and respected him.  They only wondered at his tastes as a naturalist, which to them seemed strange.  They wondered, too, how he managed to keep house without a maid-servant.  But the Colonel did not trouble his head about their conjectures.  He only laughed at their curious inquiries, and remained on as good terms as ever.  His boys, too, as they grew up became great favourites with all.  They were the best shots of their age, could ride a horse with any, could swim the Mississippi, paddle a canoe, fling a lasso, or spear a catfish, as though they had been full-grown men.  They were, in fact, boy-men; and as such were regarded by the simple villagers, who instinctively felt the superiority which education and training had given to these youths over their own uneducated minds.  The boys, notwithstanding these advantages, were affable with the villagers; hence the respect in which they were universally held.  None of his neighbours ever visited the Colonel, except on matters of business.  Indeed he had no visitors of any sort, if we except one or two of his former military associates, who lived at New Orleans, and came up to his house about once a-year to talk over old times, and taste his venison.  On such occasions \"Napoleon le Grand\" was of course the main subject of conversation.  Like all old soldiers of the Empire, Landi worshipped Napoleon; but there was one of the Bonaparte family for whom the naturalist entertained a still higher feeling of regard, amounting in fact to sincere friendship.  This was Charles Lucien, prince of Musignano.  Not all the Bonapartes have been bad.  Some of the members of that remarkable family have given evidence to the world that they were the possessors of noble virtue.  The quiet researches of the Prince of Musignano as a student of natural history, may be looked upon as so many conquests in the kingdom of Nature; and though they have been eclipsed by the more brilliant and sanguinary triumphs of the Emperor, yet do they far more entitle him to the gratitude and respect of men.  He was the true hero of the hunter-naturalist Landi.  For many years did Colonel Landi lead the life we have described.  An event at length happened that was near proving fatal to him.  He had been wounded in the leg during his campaigns in the Peninsula.  A fall from his horse reopened this wound, and amputation became necessary. This saved his life, but he could no longer partake of the amusements of the chase, although still able to indulge in the more delicate pursuits of the naturalist.  With his wooden leg he was able to hobble about the house and lawn, prune the trees, and attend to his pets that had grown to be quite numerous, while Hugot at all times followed him about like his shadow.  The boys, however, went abroad on hunting expeditions, and collected specimens as formerly; and the life of all went on pretty much as usual.  Thus it was when I first became acquainted with the naturalist, his man Hugot, and his three sons--the _Boy Hunters_, the heroes of our little book.  Young reader, permit me to introduce you to a more intimate acquaintance with them.  I fancy you will like them--all three--and be happy for some time in their society.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE PRINCE'S LETTER.  It is a lovely morning in Spring as we approach their dwelling.  We enter the lawn by a side-gate.  We need not go into the house, for there is no one within doors.  The weather is too fine for that, but they are all at home notwithstanding.  They are in the lawn in front, and the verandah.  They are differently occupied.  The Colonel himself is engaged feeding his pets.  Hugot is helping him, and carries the basket containing their food.  You would call the Colonel a fine-looking man.  His hair is as white as bleached flax.  So, too, are his moustaches.  He wears no beard.  His face is cleanly shaved, showing a complexion bronzed and somewhat ruddy. The expression of his countenance is mild, though firm.  He is much thinner than he has been in his time, on account of the amputation of his leg, which often produces this effect.  His dress is simple.  A jacket of yellow nankeen, a striped cotton shirt, with loose cottonade trousers of bright sky colour.  A Panama hat, with very broad brim, shades his eyes from the sun, and his shirt is open at the throat, for the day is warm.  Thus is the Colonel attired.  Hugot is dressed after a somewhat similar fashion; but the material of his jacket and trousers is coarser, and his hat is of the common palmetto leaf.  Look at Basil, the oldest of the boys.  He is at work fixing some straps to a hunting-saddle, that lies on the grass beside him.  Basil is exactly seventeen years of age.  He is a fine-looking lad, though not what you might call handsome.  His face has a courageous expression, and his form betokens strength.  His hair is straight, and black as jet.  He is more like an Italian than either of his brothers.  He is, in fact, the son of his father--a true Corsican.  Basil is a \"mighty hunter.\"  He is more fond of the chase than of aught else.  He loves hunting for itself, and delights in its dangers.  He has got beyond the age of bird-catching and squirrel shooting.  His ambition is not now to be satisfied with anything less exciting than a panther, bear, or buffalo hunt.  How very unlike him is Lucien, the second in age!  Unlike in almost everything.  Lucien is delicately formed, with a light complexion and very fair hair.  He is more like what his mother was, for she was fair-haired and _blonde_, as are many of her people--the Basques. Lucien is passionately fond of books and study.  He is busy with a book just now in the verandah.  He is a student of natural history in general, but botany and geology are his favourite sciences, and he has made considerable progress in both.  He accompanies Basil on all hunting expeditions; but, in the midst of the most exciting chase, Lucien would leap down from his horse if a rare plant or flower, or an odd-looking rock, was to fall under his eye.  Lucien talks but little--not half so much as most boys--but although habitually silent he possesses a rare good sense; and when he offers his advice upon any question, it is usually received with respect by the others.  Such is the secret influence of intellect and education.  Next and last, we have Francois, a quick-witted, curly-haired urchin-- merry to madness--cheerful at all times--changeable in his tastes and likings--versatile in talents--in short, more of a Frenchman than any of them.  Francois is a great bird-catcher.  He is at this moment engaged in repairing his nets; and his double-barrel shot gun, which he has just finished cleaning, rests beside him.  Francois is a favourite with everybody, but a great pest to Hugot, upon whom he plays numerous tricks.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  While the naturalist and his family were thus engaged, a loud booming noise was heard at some distance off, down the river.  It somewhat resembled the regular firing of great guns, though "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21236"],["title","The Boy Hunters (#2)"],["body","explosions sounded softer and more hollow.  \"A steamboat!\" cried Francois, whose ear first caught the sounds.  \"Yes,\" muttered Basil, \"from New Orleans, I expect, and bound to Saint Louis.\"  \"No, brother,\" said Lucien, quietly raising himself from his book.  \"She is an Ohio boat.\"  \"How can you tell that, Luce?\" inquired Francois.  \"From the sound of her 'scape, of course.  I can distinguish the boat. She is the `Buck-eye'--mail-boat for Cincinnati.\"  In a short time the white cloud of steam was seen ascending over the trees; and then the huge vessel came \"bulging\" around a bend of the river, cleaving the brown current as she went.  She was soon opposite the lawn; and, sure enough, proved to be what Lucien had said she was-- the mail-steamer \"Buck-eye.\"  This was a triumph for Lucien, although he bore it with characteristic modesty.  The boat had not passed many minutes, when the loud screeching of her steam was heard in the direction of Point Coupee.  They could tell from this that she was putting in at the landing.  \"Hugot!\" cried the Colonel, \"their may be something for us.  Go and see.\"  Without waiting for further orders, Hugot started on his errand.  He was a brisk walker, Hugot; and was back again in a trice.  He brought with him a letter of goodly size and appearance.  \"From Prince Lucien!\" cried Francois, who was sure to have the first word in everything.  \"It is from the Prince, papa; I know the seal.\"  \"Quiet, Francois! quiet!\" said his father, reprovingly; at the same time hobbling into the verandah, and calling for his spectacles.  The letter was soon opened, and perused.  \"Hugot!\" cried the Colonel, after he had finished reading it.  Hugot made no reply, but threw himself in front of his master, with his hand raised to his eyebrows _a la militaire_.  \"Hugot, you must go to Saint Louis.\"  \"_Bien, mon Colonel_!\"  \"You must start by the first boat.\"  \"_Tres-bien, mon Colonel_!\"  \"You must procure for me the skin of a _white buffalo_.\"  \"That will not be difficult, monsieur.\"  \"More difficult than you imagine, I fear.\"  \"With money, monsieur?\"  \"Ay, even with money, Hugot.  Look you!  It is a _skin_ I want--not a robe--but a perfect skin with the head, feet, and all complete, and fit for stuffing.\"  \"Ah! mon Colonel! that is different.\"  \"Ah! you may say so.  I fear it will be difficult, indeed,\" soliloquised the Colonel, with a thoughtful air.  \"I very much doubt whether we can get it at all; but it must be had, cost _what it may_--ay, _cost what it may_.\"  \"I will do my best, Colonel.\"  \"Try at every fur-store in Saint Louis,--inquire among the hunters and trappers--you know where to find them.  If these fail you, put an advertisement in the newspapers--advertise both in English and French. Go to Monsieur Choteau--anywhere.  Spare no expense, but get me the skin.\"  \"_Restez tranquille, mon Colonel_; I shall do all that.\"  \"Make ready, then, to start.  There may be a steamer going up before night.  Hush!  I hear one this very moment.  It may be a Saint Louis boat.\"  All stood for a moment silent and listening.  The 'scape of another boat coming up the river could be heard plain enough.  \"It is a Saint Louis boat,\" said Lucien.  \"It is the `Belle of the West.'\"  Lucien, who had a quick talent in that way, could tell, by the sound of their steam-pipe, almost every boat that plied upon the Mississippi.  In half-an-hour the steamer hove in sight, and it was seen that he had again guessed correctly.  It was a Saint Louis boat, and the \"Belle of the West,\" too!  Hugot had not many preparations to make; and before the boat had arrived opposite to the house, he had arranged everything--received some further instructions, with a purse of money, from his master--and was off to Point Coupee, to meet the steamer at the landing.    CHAPTER FOUR.  GOING ON A GREAT HUNT.  It was full three weeks before Hugot returned.  They were a long three weeks to the old Colonel,--who was troubled with apprehensions that Hugot would not succeed in his errand.  He had written in reply to the letter of Prince Bonaparte.  He had written promising to procure--_if possible_--a white buffalo-skin--for this was what the Prince's letter was about;--and not for half what he was worth would the Colonel have failed to accomplish this object.  No wonder, then, he was impatient and uneasy during Hugot's absence.  Hugot returned at length, after night.  The Colonel did not wait until he entered the house, but met him at the door, candle in hand.  He need not have put any question, as Hugot's face answered that question before it was asked.  The moment the light fell upon it, any one could have told that Hugot had come back _without the skin_.  He looked quite crest-fallen; and his great moustachios appeared bleached and drooping.  \"You have not got it?\" interrogated the Colonel, in a faltering voice.  \"No, Colonel,\" muttered Hugot, in reply.  \"You tried everywhere?\"  \"Everywhere.\"  \"You advertised in the papers?\"  \"In all the papers, monsieur.\"  \"You offered a high price?\"  \"I did.  It was to no purpose.  I could not have procured a white buffalo's skin if I had offered ten times as much.  I could not have got it for a thousand dollars.\"  \"I would give five thousand!\"  \"It would have been all the same, monsieur.  It is not to be had in Saint Louis.\"  \"What says Monsieur Choteau?\"  \"That there is but little chance of finding what you want.  A man, he says, may travel all over the prairies without meeting with a _white_ buffalo.  The Indians prize them beyond anything, and never let one escape when they chance to fall in with it.  I found two or three among the fur packs of the traders; but they were not what you desire, monsieur.  They were robes; and even for them a large sum was asked.\"  \"They would be of no use.  It is wanted for a different purpose--for a _great museum_.  Ah!  I fear I cannot obtain it.  If not to be had in Saint Louis, where else?\"  \"Where else, papa?\" interrupted Francois, who, with his brothers, had stood listening to the above dialogue.  \"Where else, but _on the prairies_?\"  \"On the prairies!\" mechanically echoed his father.  \"Yes, papa.  Send Basil, and Lucien, and myself.  We'll find you a white buffalo, I warrant you.\"  \"Hurrah, Francois!\" cried Basil; \"you're right, brother.  I was going to propose the same myself.\"  \"No, no, my lads; you've heard what Monsieur Choteau says.  You need not think of such a thing.  It cannot be had.  And I have written to the Prince, too.  I have as good as promised him!\"  As the old Colonel uttered these words, his countenance and gestures expressed disappointment and chagrin.  Lucien, who had observed this with a feeling of pain, now interposed.  \"Papa,\" he said, \"it is true that Monsieur Choteau has great experience in the fur-trade; but the facts do not correspond with what he has stated,\"--(Lucien, you will observe, was a keen reasoner).  \"Hugot has seen two or three of these skins in Saint Louis.  Some one must have found the animals to which these belonged.  Moreover, I have heard, as Monsieur Choteau asserts, that they are highly prized by the Indian chiefs, who wear them as robes; and that they are often seen among the tribes.  This, then, proves that there _are_ white buffaloes upon the prairies; and why should _we_ not happen upon them as well as others?  I say with Francois and Basil, let us go in search of them.\"  \"Come in, my lads; come in!\" said their father, evidently pleased, and to some extent comforted, with the proposal of his boys.  \"Come in to the house--we can talk over it better when we have had our suppers.\"  And so saying, the old Colonel hobbled back into the house followed by his three boys; while Hugot, looking very jaded and feeling very hungry, brought up the rear.  During the supper, and after it, the subject was discussed in all its bearings.  The father was more than half inclined to consent to the proposal of his sons from the first; while they, but particularly Basil and Francois, were enthusiastic in proving its practicability.  I need hardly tell you the result.  The Colonel at length gave his consent--the _expedition was agreed upon_.  The naturalist was greatly influenced by the desire he felt to gratify his friend the Prince.  He was influenced, too, by another feeling.  He felt secretly pleased at the bold and enterprising character thus exhibited in his children, and he was not the man to throw cold water upon any enterprise they might design.  Indeed, he often boasted to his neighbours and friends how he had trained them up to be men, calling them his \"boy-men,\" and his \"_jeunes chasseurs_.\"  And truly had he trained them to a complete self-reliance, as far as lay in his power. He had taught them to ride, to swim, to dive deep rivers, to fling the lasso, to climb tall trees, and scale steep cliffs, to bring down birds upon the wing, or beasts upon the run, with the arrow and the unerring rifle.  He had trained them to sleep in the open air--in the dark forest--on the unsheltered prairie--along the white snow-wreath-- anywhere--with but a blanket or a buffalo-robe for their beds.  He had taught them to live upon the simplest food; and the knowledge of practical botany which he had imparted to them--more particularly to Lucien--would enable them, in case of need, to draw sustenance from plants and trees, from roots and fruits--to find resources where ignorant men might starve.  They knew how to kindle a fire without either flint, steel, or detonating powder.  They could discover their direction without a compass--from the rocks, and the trees, and the signs of the heavens; and, in addition to all, they had been taught, as far as was then known, the geography of that vast wilderness that stretched from their own home to the far shores of the Pacific Ocean.  The Colonel knew that he might safely trust them upon the prairies; and, in truth, it was with a feeling of pride, rather than anxiety, that he consented to the expedition.  But"]]]
