But what right, Colonel Miranda, have you to interfere?\"  \"The right, first of humanity, second of hospitality, and third that I am your superior officer.\"  \"Bah!  You mistake yourself.  Remember, senor coronel, you are not in your own district.  If it was in Albuquerque, I might take commands from you.  This is the city of Chihuahua.\"  \"Chihuahua or not, you shall be made answerable for this outrage.  Don't imagine that your patron, Santa Anna, is now Dictator, with power to endorse such base conduct as yours.  You seem to forget, Captain Uraga, that you carry your commission under a new regime--one that holds itself responsible, not only to fixed laws, but to the code of decency-- responsible also for international courtesy to the great Republic of which, I believe, this gentleman is a citizen.\"  \"Bah!\" once more exclaimed the bedizened bully.  \"Preach your _palabras_ to ears that have time to listen to them.  I shan't stop the procession for either you or your Yankee protege.  So you can both go to the devil.\"  With this benevolent permission the captain of lancers struck the spurs into his horse, and once more placed himself at the head of his troop. The crowd collected by the exciting episode soon scattered away--the sooner that the strange gentleman, along with his generous defender, had disappeared from the portico, having gone inside the inn.  The procession was still passing, and its irresistible attractions swept the loiterers along in its current--most of them soon forgetting a scene which, in that land, where \"law secures not life,\" is of too frequent occurrence to be either much thought of or for long remembered.    CHAPTER TWO.  A FRIEND IN NEED.  The young Kentuckian was half frenzied by the insult he had received. The proud blood of his republican citizenship was boiling within his veins.  What was he to do?  In the agony of his dilemma he put the question to the gentleman who, beyond all doubt, had restrained him from committing manslaughter.  The latter was an entire stranger to him--never seen him before.  He was a man of less than thirty years of age, wearing a broad-brimmed hat upon his head, a cloth jacket, slashed _calzoneras_, and a red crape scarf around his waist--in short, the _ranchero_ costume of the country. Still, there was a military bearing about him that corresponded to the title by which the lancer captain had addressed him.  \"Caballero,\" he said in reply, \"if your own safety be of any consequence to you I should advise you to take no further notice of the incident that has arisen, however much it may have exasperated you, as no doubt it has done.\"  \"Pardon me, senor; but not for all the world would I follow your advice--not for my life.  I am an American--a Kentuckian.  We do not take blows without giving something of the same in return.  I must have redress.\"  \"If you seek it by the law I may as well warn you, you won't have much chance of finding it.\"  \"I know that.  The law!  I did not think of such a thing.  I am a gentleman; I suppose this Captain Uraga supposes himself to be the same, and will not refuse to give me the usual satisfaction.\"  \"He may refuse, and very likely will, on the plea of your being a stranger--only a barbarian, a _Tejano_ or _gringo_, as he has put it.\"  \"I am alone here--what am I to do?\"  The Kentuckian spoke half in soliloquy, his countenance expressing extreme chagrin.  \"_Fuez, senor_!\" responded the Mexican colonel, \"if you're determined on a _desafio_ I think I might arrange it.  I feel that I am myself a little compromised by my interference; and if you'll accept of me for your second, I think I can answer for it that Captain Uraga will not dare to deny us.\"  \"Colonel Miranda--your name, I believe--need I attempt to express my thanks for so much generosity?  I cannot--I could not.  You have removed the very difficulty that was in my way; for I am not only a stranger to you, but to every one around.  I arrived at Chihuahua but yesterday, and do not know a soul in the place.\"  \"Enough; you shall not be disappointed in your duel for the want of a second.  As a preliminary, may I ask if you are skilled in the use of the sword?\"  \"Sufficiently to stake my life upon it.\"  \"I put the question, because that is the weapon your adversary will be certain to choose.  You being the challenger, of course he has the choice; and he will insist upon it, for a reason that may perhaps amuse you.  It is that we Mexican gentlemen believe you Americans somewhat _gauche_ in the handling of the rapier, though we know you to be adepts in the use of the pistol.  I take Captain Gil Uraga to be as thorough a poltroon as ever wore epaulettes, but he will have to meet you on my account; and he would perhaps have done so anyhow--trusting to the probability of your being a bad swordsman.\"  \"In that he may find himself disappointed.\"  \"I am glad to hear it; and now it only needs to receive your instructions.  I am ready to act.\"  The instructions were given, and within two hours' time Captain Gil Uraga, of the Zacatecas Lancers, was in receipt of a challenge from the Kentuckian--Colonel Miranda being its bearer.  With such a voucher the lancer officer could not do otherwise than accept, which he did with cooler confidence for the very reason Miranda had made known.  A _Tejano_, was his reflection--what should he know of the sword?  And swords were the weapons chosen.  Had the captain of Zacatecas Lancers been told that his intended adversary had spent a portion of his life among the Creoles of New Orleans, he would have been less reliant on the chances likely to turn up in his favour.  We need not describe the duel, which, if different from other encounters of the kind, was by being on both sides bitter, and of deadly intent. Suffice it to say, that the young Kentuckian displayed a skill in swordsmanship sufficient to disarrange several of Gil Uraga's front teeth, and make an ugly gash in his cheek.  He had barely left to him sufficient command of his mouth to cry \"Basta!\" and so the affair ended.  \"Senor Hamersley,\" said the man who had so effectively befriended him, after they had returned from the encounter, and were drinking a bottle of Paso wine in the posada, \"may I ask where you intend going when you leave Chihuahua?\"  \"To Santa Fe, in New Mexico; thence to the United States, along with one of the return caravans.\"  \"When do you propose starting?\"  \"As to that, I am not tied to time.  The train with which I am to cross the plains will not be going for six months to come.  I can get to Santa Fe by a month's travel, I suppose?\"  \"Less than that.  It is not a question of how soon you may arrive there, but when you leave here.  I advise you to start at once.  I admit that two days is but a short time to see the sights of even so small a place as Chihuahua.  But you have witnessed one of them--enough, I should say. If you take my advice you will let it content you, and kick the Chihuahua-ense dust from your feet before another twenty-four hours have passed over your head.\"  \"But why, Colonel Miranda?\"  \"Because so long as you remain here you will be in danger of losing your life.  You don't know the character of the man with whom you have crossed swords.  I do.  Although wearing the uniform of an officer in our army, he is simply a _salteador_.  A coward, as I told you, too.  He would never have met you if he had thought I would have given him a chance to get out of it.  Perhaps he might have been tempted by the hopes of an easy conquest from your supposed want of skill.  It would have given him something to boast about among the dames of Chihuahua, for Captain Gil deems himself no little of a lady-killer.  You have spoilt his physiognomy for life; and, depend upon it, as long as life lasts, he will neither forget nor forgive that.  I shall also come in for a share of his spite, and it behoves both of us to beware of him.\"  \"But what can he do to us?\"  \"Caballero, that question shows you have not been very long in this country, and are yet ignorant of its customs.  In Mexico we have some callings not congenial to your people.  Know that stilettoes can here be purchased cheaply, with the arms of assassins to use them.  Do you understand me?\"  \"I do.  But how do you counsel me to act?\"  \"As I intend acting myself--take departure from Chihuahua this very day. Our roads are the same as far as Albuquerque, where you will be out of reach of this little danger.  I am returning thither from the city of Mexico, where I've had business with the Government.  I have an escort; and if you choose to avail yourself of it you'll be welcome to its protection.\"  \"Colonel Miranda, again I know not how to thank you.  I accept your friendly offer.\"  \"Reserve your thanks till I have done you some service beyond the simple duty of a gentleman, who sees another gentleman in a dilemma he had no hand in creating.  But enough, senor; we have no time to spend in talking.  Even now there may be a couple of poignards preparing for us. Get your things ready at once, as I start two hours before sunset.  In this sultry weather we are accustomed to travel in the cool of the evening.\"  \"I shall be ready.\"  That same afternoon, two hours before the going down of the sun, a party of horsemen, wearing the uniform of Mexican dragoons of the line, issued from the _garita_ of Chihuahua, and took the northern road leading to Santa Fe, by El Paso del Norte.  Colonel Miranda, his ranchero dress changed for the fatigue uniform of a cavalry officer, was at its head, and by his side the stranger, whose cause he had so generously and gallantly espoused.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE COLONEL COMMANDANT.  Six weeks have elapsed since the day of the duel at Chihuahua.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21240"],["title","The Lone Ranche (#2)"],["body","men are standing on the _azotea_ of a large mansion-like house close to the town of Albuquerque, whose church spire is just visible through the foliage of trees that shade and surround the dwelling.  They are Colonel Miranda and the young Kentuckian, who has been for some time his guest; for the hospitality of the generous Mexican had not terminated with the journey from Chihuahua.  After three weeks of toilsome travel, including the traverse of the famed \"Dead Man's Journey,\" he was continuing to extend it in his own house and his own district, of which last he was the military commandant, Albuquerque being at the time occupied by a body of troops, stationed there for defence against Indian incursions.  The house on whose roof the two men stood was that in which Colonel Miranda had been born--the patrimonial mansion of a large estate that extended along the Rio del Norte, and back towards the Sierra Blanca, into territories almost unknown.  Besides being an officer in the Mexican army, the colonel was one of the _ricos_ of the country.  The house, as already said, was a large, massive structure, having, like all Mexican dwellings of its class, a terraced roof, or _azotea_.  What is also common enough in that country, it was surmounted by a _mirador_, or \"belvedere.\"  Standing less than half a mile distant from the soldier's _cuartel_, the commandant found it convenient to make use of it as his headquarters.  A small guard in the _saguan_, or covered entrance below, with a sentinel stationed outside the gate in front, indicated this.  There was no family inside, wife, woman, or child; for the colonel, still a young man, was a bachelor.  Only _peons_ in the field, grooms and other servants around the stables, with domestics in the dwelling-- all, male and female, being Indians of the race known as \"Indios mansos\"--brown-skinned and obedient.  But though at this time there was no living lady to make her soft footsteps heard within the walls of the commandant's dwelling, the portrait of a lovely girl hung against the side of the main _sola_, and on this his American guest had more than once gazed in silent admiration.  It showed signs of having been recently painted, which was not strange, since it was the likeness of Colonel Miranda's sister, a few years younger than himself--at the time on a visit to some relatives in a distant part of the Republic.  Frank Hamersley's eyes never rested on it without his wishing the original at home.  The two gentlemen upon the housetop were leisuring away the time in the indulgence of a cigar, watching the water-fowl that swam and plunged on the bosom of the broad shallow stream, listening to the hoarse croakings of pelicans and the shriller screams of the _guaya_ cranes.  It was the hour of evening, when these birds become especially stridulent.  \"And so you must go to-morrow, Senor Francisco?\" said his host, taking the cigaritto from between his teeth, and looking inquiringly into the face of the Kentuckian.  \"There is no help for it, colonel.  The caravan with which I came out will be leaving Santa Fe the day after to-morrow, and there's just time for me to get there.  Unless I go along with it, there may be no other opportunity for months to come, and one cannot cross the plains alone.\"  \"Well, I suppose I must lose you.  I am sorry, and selfishly, too, for, as you see, I am somewhat lonely here.  There's not one of my officers, with the exception of our old _medico_, exactly of the sort to be companionable.  True, I have enough occupation, as you may have by this time discovered, in looking after our neighbours, the _Indios bravos_, who, knowing the skeleton of a regiment I've got, are growing saucier every day.  I only wish I had a score or two of your stalwart trappers, who now and then pay a visit to Albuquerque.  Well, my sister will soon be here, and she, brave girl, has plenty of life in her, though she be but young.  What a joyous creature she is, wild as a mustang filly fresh caught.  I wish, Don Francisco, you could have stayed to make her acquaintance.  I am sure you would be delighted with her.\"  If the portrait on the wall was anything of a faithful likeness, Hamersley could not have been otherwise.  This was his reflection, though, for certain reasons, he did not in speech declare it.  \"It is to be hoped we shall meet again, Colonel Miranda,\" was his ingenious rejoinder.  \"If I did not have this hope, I should now be parting from you with greater regret.  Indeed, I have more than a presentiment we shall meet again; since I've made up my mind on a certain thing.\"  \"On what, Don Francisco?\"  \"On returning to New Mexico.\"  \"To settle in the country?\"  \"Not exactly that; only for a time--long enough to enable me to dispose of a cargo of merchandise in exchange for a bag of your big Mexican dollars.\"  \"Ah! you intend to become one of the prairie merchants, then?\"  \"I do.  That intention has been the cause of my visiting your country. I am old enough to think of some calling, and have always had a fancy for the adventurous life of the prairie trader.  As I have sufficient means to stock a small caravan for myself, I think now of trying it.  My present trip has been merely one of experiment and exploration.  I am satisfied with the result, and, if no accident arise, you may see me back on the Del Norte before either of us be twelve months older.\"  \"Then, indeed, is there a hope of our meeting again.  I am rejoiced at it.  But, Senor Don Francisco,\" continued his host, changing to a serious tone, \"a word lest I might forget it--a word of counsel, or warning, I may call it.  I have observed that you are too unsuspicious, too regardless of danger.  It does not all lie upon the prairies, or among red-skinned savages.  There is as much of it here, amid the abodes of our so-called civilisation.  When you are travelling through this country bear your late antagonist in mind, and should you at any time meet, beware of him.  I have given you some hints about the character of Gil Uraga.  I have not told you all.  He is worse than you can even imagine.  I know him well.  Do you see that little house, out yonder on the other side of the river?\"  Hamersley nodded assent.  \"In that hovel he was born.  His father was what we call a _pelado_--a poor devil, with scarce a coat to his back.  Himself the same, but something worse.  He has left in his native place a record of crimes well known, with others more than suspected.  In short, he is, as I have told you, a robber.  No doubt you wonder that such a man should be an officer in our army.  That is because you are ignorant of the state of our service--our society as well.  It is but the result of constantly recurring changes in our political system.  Still you may feel surprise at his holding this commission, with the patriotic party--the pure one-- in power, as it now is.  That might be inexplicable even to myself, since I know that he will be traitor to our cause when convenient to him.  But I also know the explanation.  There is a power, even when the party exercising it is not in the ascendant--an influence that works by sap and secrecy.  It is that of our hierarchy.  Gil Uraga is one of its tools, since it exactly suits his low instincts and treacherous training.  Whenever the day is ripe for a fresh _pronunciamento_ against our liberties--if we are so unfortunate as to have one--he will be amongst the foremost of the traitors.  _Carrai_!  I can think of him only with disgust and loathing.  Would you believe it, senor, that this fellow, now that epaulettes have been set on his shoulders--placed there for some vile service--has the audacity to aspire to the hand of my sister?  Adela Miranda standing in bridal robes by the side of Gil Uraga!  I would rather see her in her shroud!\"  Hamersley's bosom heaved up as he listened to the last words, and with emotion almost equalling that which excited his host.  He had just been thinking about the portrait upon the wall, and how beautiful the original must be.  Now hearing her name coupled with that of the ruffian whose blow he had felt, and whose blood he had spilled, he almost regretted not having ended that duel by killing his adversary outright.  \"But surely, Colonel Miranda,\" he said at length, \"there could be no danger of such an event as that you speak of?\"  \"Never, so long as I live.  But, amigo, as you have learnt, this is a strange land--a country of quick changes.  I am here to-day, commanding in this district, with power, I may almost say, over the lives of all around me.  To-morrow I may be a fugitive, or dead.  If the latter, where is she, my poor sister, going to find the arm that could protect her?\"  Again the breast of Hamersley heaved in a convulsive manner.  Strange as it might appear, the words of his newly-made friend seemed like an appeal to him.  And it is just possible some such thought was in the mind of the Mexican colonel.  In the strong man by his side he saw the type of a race who can protect; just such an oak as he would wish to see his sister extend her arms tendril-like around, and cling on to for life.  Hamersley could not help having vague and varied misgivings; yet among them was one purpose he had already spoken of--a determination to return to Albuquerque.  \"I am sure to be back here,\" he said, as if the promise was meant to tranquillise the apprehensions of the colonel.  Then, changing to a more careless tone, he added,--  \"I cannot come by the spring caravans; there would not be time enough to make my arrangements.  But there is a more southern route, lately discovered, that can be travelled at any season.  Perhaps I may try that.  In any case, I shall write you by the trains leaving the States in the spring, so that you may know when to expect me.  And if, Colonel Miranda,\" he added, after a short reflective pause, in which his countenance assumed a new and graver form of expression, \"if any political trouble, such as you speak of, should"]]]
