For most princes apply themselves more to affairs of war than to the useful arts of peace; and in these I neither have any knowledge, nor do I much desire it; they are generally more set on acquiring new kingdoms, right or wrong, than on governing well those they possess: and, among the ministers of princes, there are none that are not so wise as to need no assistance, or at least, that do not think themselves so wise that they imagine they need none; and if they court any, it is only those for whom the prince has much personal favour, whom by their fawning and flatteries they endeavour to fix to their own interests; and, indeed, nature has so made us, that we all love to be flattered and to please ourselves with our own notions: the old crow loves his young, and the ape her cubs. Now if in such a court, made up of persons who envy all others and only admire themselves, a person should but propose anything that he had either read in history or observed in his travels, the rest would think that the reputation of their wisdom would sink, and that their interests would be much depressed if they could not run it down: and, if all other things failed, then they would fly to this, that such or such things pleased our ancestors, and it were well for us if we could but match them. They would set up their rest on such an answer, as a sufficient confutation of all that could be said, as if it were a great misfortune that any should be found wiser than his ancestors. But though they willingly let go all the good things that were among those of former ages, yet, if better things are proposed, they cover themselves obstinately with this excuse of reverence to past times. I have met with these proud, morose, and absurd judgments of things in many places, particularly once in England.” “Were you ever there?” said I. “Yes, I was,” answered he, “and stayed some months there, not long after the rebellion in the West was suppressed, with a great slaughter of the poor people that were engaged in it.  “I was then much obliged to that reverend prelate, John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal, and Chancellor of England; a man,” said he, “Peter (for Mr. More knows well what he was), that was not less venerable for his wisdom and virtues than for the high character he bore: he was of a middle stature, not broken with age; his looks begot reverence rather than fear; his conversation was easy, but serious and grave; he sometimes took pleasure to try the force of those that came as suitors to him upon business by speaking sharply, though decently, to them, and by that he discovered their spirit and presence of mind; with which he was much delighted when it did not grow up to impudence, as bearing a great resemblance to his own temper, and he looked on such persons as the fittest men for affairs. He spoke both gracefully and weightily; he was eminently skilled in the law, had a vast understanding, and a prodigious memory; and those excellent talents with which nature had furnished him were improved by study and experience. When I was in England the King depended much on his counsels, and the Government seemed to be chiefly supported by him; for from his youth he had been all along practised in affairs; and, having passed through many traverses of fortune, he had, with great cost, acquired a vast stock of wisdom, which is not soon lost when it is purchased so dear. One day, when I was dining with him, there happened to be at table one of the English lawyers, who took occasion to run out in a high commendation of the severe execution of justice upon thieves, ‘who,’ as he said, ‘were then hanged so fast that there were sometimes twenty on one gibbet!’ and, upon that, he said, ‘he could not wonder enough how it came to pass that, since so few escaped, there were yet so many thieves left, who were still robbing in all places.’ Upon this, I (who took the boldness to speak freely before the Cardinal) said, ‘There was no reason to wonder at the matter, since this way of punishing thieves was neither just in itself nor good for the public; for, as the severity was too great, so the remedy was not effectual; simple theft not being so great a crime that it ought to cost a man his life; no punishment, how severe soever, being able to restrain those from robbing who can find out no other way of livelihood. In this,’ said I, ‘not only you in England, but a great part of the world, imitate some ill masters, that are readier to chastise their scholars than to teach them. There are dreadful punishments enacted against thieves, but it were much better to make such good provisions by which every man might be put in a method how to live, and so be preserved from the fatal necessity of stealing and of dying for it.’ ‘There has been care enough taken for that,’ said he; ‘there are many handicrafts, and there is husbandry, by which they may make a shift to live, unless they have a greater mind to follow ill courses.’ ‘That will not serve your turn,’ said I, ‘for many lose their limbs in civil or foreign wars, as lately in the Cornish rebellion, and some time ago in your wars with France, who, being thus mutilated in the service of their king and country, can no more follow their old trades, and are too old to learn new ones; but since wars are only accidental things, and have intervals, let us consider those things that fall out every day. There is a great number of noblemen among you that are themselves as idle as drones, that subsist on other men’s labour, on the labour of their tenants, whom, to raise their revenues, they pare to the quick. This, indeed, is the only instance of their frugality, for in all other things they are prodigal, even to the beggaring of themselves; but, besides this, they carry about with them a great number of idle fellows, who never learned any art by which they may gain their living; and these, as soon as either their lord dies, or they themselves fall sick, are turned out of doors; for your lords are readier to feed idle people than to take care of the sick; and often the heir is not able to keep together so great a family as his predecessor did. Now, when the stomachs of those that are thus turned out of doors grow keen, they rob no less keenly; and what else can they do? For when, by wandering about, they have worn out both their health and their clothes, and are tattered, and look ghastly, men of quality will not entertain them, and poor men dare not do it, knowing that one who has been bred up in idleness and pleasure, and who was used to walk about with his sword and buckler, despising all the neighbourhood with an insolent scorn as far below him, is not fit for the spade and mattock; nor will he serve a poor man for so small a hire and in so low a diet as he can afford to give him.’ To this he answered, ‘This sort of men ought to be particularly cherished, for in them consists the force of the armies for which we have occasion; since their birth inspires them with a nobler sense of honour than is to be found among tradesmen or ploughmen.’ ‘You may as well say,’ replied I, ‘that you must cherish thieves on the account of wars, for you will never want the one as long as you have the other; and as robbers prove sometimes gallant soldiers, so soldiers often prove brave robbers, so near an alliance there is between those two sorts of life. But this bad custom, so common among you, of keeping many servants, is not peculiar to this nation. In France there is yet a more pestiferous sort of people, for the whole country is full of soldiers, still kept up in time of peace (if such a state of a nation can be called a peace); and these are kept in pay upon the same account that you plead for those idle retainers about noblemen: this being a maxim of those pretended statesmen, that it is necessary for the public safety to have a good body of veteran soldiers ever in readiness. They think raw men are not to be depended on, and they sometimes seek occasions for making war, that they may train up their soldiers in the art of cutting throats, or, as Sallust observed, “for keeping their hands in use, that they may not grow dull by too long an intermission.” But France has learned to its cost how dangerous it is to feed such beasts. The fate of the Romans, Carthaginians, and Syrians, and many other nations and cities, which were both overturned and quite ruined by those standing armies, should make others wiser; and the folly of this maxim of the French appears plainly even from this, that their trained soldiers often find your raw men prove too hard for them, of which I will not say much, lest you may think I flatter the English. Every day’s experience shows that the mechanics in the towns or the clowns in the country are not afraid of fighting with those idle gentlemen, if they are not disabled by some misfortune in their body or dispirited by extreme want; so that you need not fear that those well-shaped and strong men (for it is only such that noblemen love to keep about them till they spoil them), who now grow feeble with ease and are softened with their effeminate manner of life, would be less fit for action if they were well bred and well employed. And it seems very unreasonable that, for the prospect of a war, which you need never have but when you please, you should maintain so many idle men, as will always disturb you in time of peace, which is ever to be more considered than war. But I do not think that this necessity of stealing arises only from hence; there is another cause of it, more peculiar to England.’ ‘What is that?’ said the Cardinal: ‘The increase of pasture,’ said I, ‘by which your sheep, which are naturally mild, and easily kept in order,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21302"],["title","Charge! A Story of Briton and Boer (#1)"],["body","time, when Aunt Jenny called us, and the Dutchman came and sat with us, while the great Kaffir carried his portion away, and sat under the wagon to munch.  After the meal the Boer lit his pipe, sat down on a piece of rock, and smoked and looked on till midday, by which time the fruit-trees were all planted, and the big Kaffir had trotted to and fro with a couple of buckets, bringing water to fill up the saucer-like depressions placed about each tree.  Then Aunt Jenny called us to dinner, and after that the Boer said it was time to inspan and begin the journey back.  Oh, how well I remember it all!--seeing my father opening a wash-leather bag and paying the Boer the sum that had been agreed upon, and that he wasn't satisfied, but asked for another dollar for the work done by his man.  Then father laughed and said he ought to charge for the meals that had been eaten; but he gave the Boer the money all the same; and Aunt Jenny uttered a deep grunt, and said afterwards in her old-fashioned way, \"Oh John, what a foolish boy you are!\"  Then he kissed her and said, \"Yes, Jen.  I always was.  You didn't half-teach me when I was young.\"  This was after we had watched the wagon grow smaller and smaller in the distance on its way back, and after the great black had stood and looked down at me and laughed in his big, noisy way.  Then once more we were alone in the great desert, father looking proudly down at his little orchard, and Bob walking up and down touching every tree, and counting them over again.  \"Begins to look homely now, Val,\" he said; \"but we must work, boy-- work.\"  We did work hard to make that place the home it grew to.  \"It's for you, boys,\" he said, \"when I'm dead and gone;\" and it was about that time I began to think and understand more fully how father was doing it all for the sake of us boys, and to try and ease his heart-ache.  Aunt Jenny set me thinking by her words, and at last I fully grasped how it all was.  \"I believe he'd have died broken-hearted, Val,\" she said to me, \"if I hadn't come to him.  It was after your poor dear mother passed away.  I told him he was not acting like a man and a father to give up like that, and it roused him; and one day--you remember, it was when I had come to keep house for him--he turned to me and said, `I shall never be happy in England again; and I've been thinking it would be a good thing to take those boys out to the Cape and settle there.  They'll grow up well and strong in the new land, and I shall try to make a home for them yonder.' `Yes, John,' I said, `that's the very thing you ought to do.'  `Ah,' he said, `but it means leaving you behind, Jenny, dear, and you'll perhaps never set eyes upon them again.'  `Oh, yes, I shall, John,' I said, `for I've come to stay.'  `What!' he cried; `would you go with us, sis?' `Yes,' I said, `to the very end of the world.'  So we came here, Val, where there's plenty of room, and no neighbours to find fault with our ways.\"  That's how it was; and now I can admire and think of how Aunt Jenny, the prim maiden lady, gave up all her own old ways to set to and work and drudge for us all, living in a wagon and then in a tent, and smiling pleasantly at the trees we planted, and bringing us lunch where we were working away, dragging down stones for the house which progressed so slowly, though father's ideas wore modest.  \"For,\" said he, \"we'll build one big stone room, Val, and make it into two with part of the tent.  Then by-and-by we'll build another room against it, and then another and another till we get it into a house.\"  Yes, it was hard work getting the stones, and we were busy enough one day in the hot sunshine, about a month after the wagon had been with the trees and stores, when Bob suddenly stood shading his eyes, and cried:  \"Some one's coming!\"  We looked up, and there, far in the distance, I saw a black figure striding along under a great, broad matting-hat.  \"Why, it looks like that great Kaffir, father,\" I said.  \"Nonsense, boy,\" he replied; \"the Kaffirs all look alike at a distance.\"  \"But it is, father,\" I cried excitedly.  \"Look; he's waving his big hat because he sees us.\"  I waved mine in answer; and directly after he began to run, coming up laughing merrily, and ending by throwing down three assagais and the bundle he carried, as he cried:  \"Come back, boss.\"  We gave him something to eat, and the next minute he was lifting and carrying stones, working like a slave; and at night he told me in his way that he was going to stop along with old boss and young boss and little boss and old gal, and never go away no more.    CHAPTER TWO.  OUR UGLY VISITOR.  The black fellow's arrival at such a time was most welcome; but my father put no faith in his declaration.  \"They're all alike, Val,\" he said.  \"He's a quick worker, and as willing and good-tempered as a man can be; but he'll only stay with us till he has earned wages enough to buy himself some bright-coloured blankets and handkerchiefs, and then he'll be off back to his tribe.\"  \"Think so, father?\"  I said.  \"He seems to like us all here.  He says it's better than being with the Boers.  He always says he means to stay.\"  \"He does mean it, of course,\" said my father; \"but these black fellows are like big children, and are easily led away by some new attraction. We shall wake up some morning and find him gone.\"  But seven years glided away, during which apprenticeshiplike time Joeboy, as we called him--for he would not be content with Joe when he had heard the \"boy\" after it once or twice, \"Joeboy\" quite taking his fancy--worked for us constantly, and became the most useful of fellows upon our farm, ready to do anything and do it well, as his strength became tempered with education.  In fact, it grew to be a favourite saying with my father, \"I don't know what we should have done without Joeboy.\"  One of the first persons I saw that morning, when I trotted towards the house after being called by my brother, was the great black hurrying out to meet us; and as we got closer it was to see his face puckered up and his eyes flashing, as he said to me hoarsely:  \"Won't go, Boss Val; won't go.  You tell the Boss I've run up into the hills.  Won't go.\"  \"Here, what do you mean?\"  I said.  \"Boss Boers come to fetch up go and fight.  Won't go.\"  \"Nonsense,\" I said.  \"I dare say they've only come to buy bullocks.\"  \"No,\" said the black, shaking his head fiercely.  \"Come to fetch Joeboy.\"  \"Here, don't run away.\"  \"On'y go up in kopje,\" he said.  \"Hide dar.\"  He rushed away, and I was sure I knew where he would hide himself.  Then I walked on with my brother, to find my father and Aunt Jenny by the door.  \"What's it all about, father?\"  I asked.  \"I don't know yet, my boy; but we soon shall.  There's about a score of the Boers, well mounted and armed.  Yonder they are, coming at a walk. There were only twelve; but another party have caught up to them, and maybe there are more.\"  \"Joeboy has run off in a fright,\" I said.  \"He thinks they've come to fetch him.\"  \"Oh no; it isn't that, my boy,\" said my father.  \"I fear it's something worse.\"  \"What?\"  I said wonderingly.    CHAPTER THREE.  MY FIRST REAL TROUBLE.  Before my father could reply a body of horsemen cantered up, every man well mounted, rifle in hand, and carrying a cross-belt over his left shoulder fitted with cartridges, bandolier fashion.  Their leader, a big, heavily-bearded, fierce-looking fellow, dropped from his saddle, threw the rein to one of his companions, and then swaggered up to us, scanning us with his eyes half-closed, and with a haughty, contemptuous expression in his countenance.  \"Ye're John Moray, I suppose?\" he said, turning to my father, after looking me up and down in a way I, a hot-blooded and independent lad of eighteen, did not at all like.  \"Yes,\" said my father quietly, \"I'm John Moray.  Do you want some refreshment for your men and horses?\"  \"Yes, of course,\" said our visitor; and I wondered why such a big-bearded, broad-shouldered fellow should speak in so high-pitched a tone.  That he was Irish he proved directly; but that excited no surprise, for we were accustomed to offer hospitality to men of various nationalities from time to time--Scots, Finns, Germans, Swedes, and Norwegians--trekking up-country in search of a place to settle on.  \"Will you dismount and tie up, then?\" said my father; \"and we'll see what we can do.--Val, my lad, you will see to the horses having a feed?\"  \"Yes, father,\" was on my lips, when the Irish leader turned upon me sharply with:  \"Oh, ye're Val--are ye?\"  \"Yes,\" I said, rather sharply, for the man's aggressive manner nettled me; \"my name is Valentine.\"  \"And is it, now?\" he said, with a mocking laugh.  \"Ye're a penny plain and tuppence coloured, I suppose?  Coloured, bedad!  Look at his face!\"  \"I don't see the joke,\" I said sharply.  \"Don't ye, now?  Then ye soon will, my fine chap.  Let's see, now; how old are ye?\"  I made no reply, and my father replied gravely:  \"My son is eighteen.\"  \"Is he, now?  And ye're forty, I suppose?\"  \"I am sorry to say I am over fifty,\" replied my father, as I stood chafing at the man's insolent, bullying tone.  \"Then ye don't look it, sor.  But there, we'll leave ye alone for a bit. I dare say we can do without ye this time, and take the bhoy.\"  \"What for--where?\" said my father quickly.  \"What for--where?\" cried the man.  \"For the commando, of course.\"  \"The commando?\" said my father, while I felt staggered, only half-grasping the import of his words.  \"Yes, sor, the commando.  D'ye suppose ye are to have the protection of the State, and do nothing again' your counthry's inimies?  If ye do ye're greatly mistaken.  Every man must take his turn to difind the counthry, and ye may feel preciously contented that ye don't have to join yerself.\"  \"But I have heard of no rising,\" said my father, looking at me anxiously.  \"The blacks all about here are peaceable and friendly.\"  \"Not the blackest blacks, sor,\" said the man, drawing"]]]
