The little girls would \"bob\" in old-fashioned style, and the boys would pull off their caps, and Rhoda would toss her flaxen mane and acknowledge their salutations with a gracious smile and a wave of the little gloved hand.  The children thought she looked like a fairy princess, and no more dreamt that she was of the same flesh and blood as themselves than did Miss Rhoda herself.  Then came lunch, and more often than not some excuse for getting off the hour's lessons with Fraulein before the \"visiting professors\" arrived.  Music master, drawing master, French master--they each came in their turn, and Rhoda exerted herself to do her best, as she invariably did, given the stimulus of an audience, and was praised and flattered to her heart's desire.  It was a happy life, and most satisfactory from the girl's point of view; so that it seemed most annoying that it should be interrupted, and by Fraulein too, who had always been so meek and tractable!  Who could have imagined when she went home for the summer holidays that an old love would appear and insist upon marrying her out of hand?  \"But what am _I_ to do?\" cried Rhoda, when the news was first received; and then, in stern disapproval, \"I'm _surprised_ at Fraulein!  At her age she should know better.  She always professed to be so devoted.  I can't understand how she could make up her mind to leave me.\"  \"It must have been a terrible trial to her, dearest,\" said Mrs Chester soothingly, and she meant what she said.  How could any one prefer a fat, long-haired, spectacled lover (all Germans were fat, long-haired, and spectacled!) to her beautiful, clever daughter?  She sighed, once for Rhoda's disappointment, and once again, and with an added stab, for herself.  Several times lately Mr Chester had hinted that Rhoda was getting too much for Fraulein, and should be sent to school, while Harold had treacherously seconded his father with remarks of such brotherly candour as made his mother hot with indignation.  Jim was mercifully away from home, but even so it was two against one, and she instinctively felt that Fraulein's defection would be seized upon by the enemy and the attack pressed home upon the first opportunity.  And now it had come, and there sat the poor, dear soul, shedding tears of anguish on her lace-edged handkerchief, as she vainly tried to oppose the inevitable.  \"I cannot, and will not, part from my child!\"  \"Nonsense, mother, you parted from me, and I shall take it as a personal insult if you insinuate that you would feel Rhoda's absence more than you did mine.  Remember how delighted you were when I came back! Remember the holidays, how happy you were, how interested in all I had to tell!\"  Harold Chester crossed the room, and laid his hand on his mother's shoulder with a kindly gesture.  He looked as if he were made on the same principle as the other objects of _vertu_ in the room, and if Mrs Chester had desired to possess \"the most superfine specimen of sons and heirs,\" she had certainly got her wish, so far as appearances were concerned.  Harold was tall and fair, with aquiline features and a manly carriage.  His hair would have curled if it had not been cropped so close to his head; his clothes were of immaculate cut.  At twenty-five he was known as one of the most daring sportsmen in the county, and if he had not distinguished himself at college, he had, at least, scrambled through with the crowd.  His mother declared with pride that he had never given her an hour's anxiety since he had had the measles, and thanked Heaven for her mercies every time she saw him ride off to the hunt in his beautiful pink coat.  Harold was her first-born darling, but Rhoda was the baby, and she could not bring herself to believe that her baby was growing up.  \"The child will fret and break her heart.  I don't care about myself, but I will not have her made unhappy.  She has such a sensitive heart!\" She sobbed as she spoke, and Harold laughed.  \"You trust me, mater; Rhoda is as well able to take care of herself as any girl can be.  You will regret it all your life long if you keep her at home now.  School is what she needs, and school she must have, if she is to make a woman worth having.  She is a jolly little soul, and I'm proud of her; but her eyes are so taken up admiring Miss Rhoda Chester that she has no attention left for anything else.  Let her go, mother, and find out that there are other girls in the world beside herself!\"  \"But the other girls will b-b-bully her.  They will make fun of her and laugh at her little ways--\"  \"And a good--\" Harold checked himself and said cheerily: \"Rhoda won't let herself be bullied without knowing the reason why, mother.  Whatever faults she may have, no one can accuse her of lack of spirit.  I believe she would like to go.  She has very few girl friends, and would enjoy the new experience.\"  \"We will tell her about it, and see what she says,\" said Mr Chester; and at that very moment the door opened and Rhoda walked into the room.    CHAPTER TWO.  WHAT RHODA THOUGHT.  Father, mother, and brother looked at Rhoda, and felt a pardonable pride in her appearance.  Her white evening frock showed off the fair complexion and golden locks, and she carried herself with an erect, fearless mien which made a pleasant contrast to the stooping backs and shambling gait of most growing girls.  If she were not regularly pretty, her air of assurance forced onlookers to think her so, despite their better judgment, and there was about her a breezy atmosphere of health and youth.  She looked from one to the other of the watching faces, and smiled in a good-humoured, tolerant manner, which showed a dimple in the round cheek.  \"Hatching mischief!\" she cried, nodding her head sagely.  \"The way in which your voices ceased as I entered the room was highly suspicious. Never mind--I'll go to bed soon, and then you can talk at your ease.  It _is_ awkward when birthdays are drawing near! ...  Chain bracelets are very nice, with turquoises set here and there, and I rather like that new edition of Shakespeare with a lot of dear little books fitted into a case.  I don't object to brooches either, or ornaments for my room--\"  \"But, strange to say, we were not thinking of giving you anything!  We were talking of a much more serious consideration than a birthday.  We were talking of your Future Education,\" said Mr Chester, solemnly.  He spoke so impressively, and with such very large capitals to the last two words, that Rhoda was startled into attention, and turned her eyes upon him in wonder.  \"My--future--education?  Why, what do you--what am I going to do?\"  \"We have been considering the advisability of sending you to school. You are nearly sixteen, and have been educated at home all your life, and now that Fraulein cannot return I feel strongly that it would be for your good to spend a couple of years at school among girls of your own age.  Your mother naturally dreads the parting, and fears that you would be unhappy, but Harold thinks that you would enjoy the experience.  What is your own impression?  Do you dislike the idea, or feel inclined towards it?\"  Rhoda meditated, and her mother watched her with wistful eyes.  At the first mention of the word \"school\" the girl had started with surprise, and her eyes had looked wide and puzzled, but now as she stood deliberating, it was not dismay, but rather pleasure and excitement, that showed in her face.  The eyes gleamed complacently, the dimple dipped, the fair head tilted itself, and Rhoda said slowly--  \"I think I should--_like_ it!  It would be a--change!\"  Alas for Mrs Chester, and alas for every mother in that sharp moment when she realises that the nestling which she has been keeping so safe and warm is already beginning to find the nest too narrow for its ambitions, and is longing to fly away into the big, wide world!  Two salt tears splashed on to the satin gown, but no one saw them, for the girl was engrossed in her own feelings, while Mr Chester was saying brightly--  \"That's my brave girl!  I knew you would be no coward.\"  Harold watched his sister with mingled pity and amusement.  \"They'll take it out of her!  They'll take it out of her!  Poor little Ro!  Won't she hate it, and won't it do her good!\" he said to himself, shrewdly.  \"And, after the first, I shouldn't wonder if she became a prime favourite!\"  Rhoda seated herself on a crimson plush chair, and folded her hands on her knees, in an attitude of expectation.  She was an impetuous young person, and could brook no delay when once her interest was aroused. School having been mentioned as a possibility of the future, it became imperative to settle the matter off-hand.  Which school?  When?  Who would take her?  What would she have to buy? What were the rules?  When were the holidays?  How long would they be? Where would she spend them?--One question succeeded another in breathless succession, making Mr Chester smile with indulgent amusement.  \"My dear child, how can I tell?  So far it is only a suggestion. Nothing is settled.  We have not even thought of one school before another--\"  \"If she goes at all, I should like her to go to Miss Moorby's, at Bournemouth,\" said Mrs Chester quickly.  \"She only takes ten girls, and I'm told it is just like a home--hot bottles in all the beds, and beef- tea at eleven--\"  \"Mother!\" cried Rhoda, in a tone of deep reproach.  Her eyes flashed, and she drew herself up proudly.  \"No, indeed!  If I go at all, I will do the thing properly, and go to a real school, and not a hot-house.  I don't want their old beef-tea and bottles.  I want to go to a nice, big, sporty school, where they treat you like boys, and not young ladies, and put you on your honour, and don't bind you down by a hundred sickening little rules.  I want to go to,\"--she drew a long breath, and glanced at her mother, as if bracing herself to meet opposition--\"to Hurst Manor! There!  I've read about it in magazines, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],["title","Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#2)"],["body","Mason had a cousin who had been there, and she said it was--simply mag.!  She was Head Girl, and ruled the house, and came out first in the games, and she said she never had such sport in her life, and found the holidays quite fearfully flat and stale in comparison.\"  \"You don't become Head Girl all at once,\" interposed Harold, drily; while Mrs Chester gave another sob at the idea that home could ever be looked upon in so sad a light.  \"Hurst Manor?\" she repeated vaguely.  \"That's a strange name.  I never heard of the place before.  What do you know about it that makes you want to go, darling?  Are you quite sure it is nice, and what is the Head Mistress like, and how many young la-- girls does she take?  Not too many, I hope, for I can't see how they can be properly looked after when there are more than twenty or thirty.  I've heard terrible stories of delicacy for life arising from neglect.  You remember poor, dear Evie Vane!  Her glands swelled, and nobody noticed, and--\"  \"My glands never swell.  They know better.  Over two hundred girls, mother; but they are divided into different houses, with a staff of teachers in charge of each, so there's no fear of being neglected; and it's much more fun living in a crowd.  I'm tired of talking to the same people over and over again, and should love a variety.  Among the hundred girls, one would be sure to find one or two whom one could really like.\"  Harold laughed again, a sleepy laugh, which brought a flash into his sister's eyes.  That was the worst of Harold; he was so superior!  He never argued, nor contradicted, but he had a way of smiling to himself, of throwing back his head and half shutting his eyes, which made Rhoda feel as if throwing cushions at him would be the only adequate relief to her feelings.  She glared at him for a moment, and then turned her back on him in a marked manner and addressed herself to her father.  \"You will write to Miss Bruce at once, won't you, father, and arrange for me to go at the beginning of the term?\"  \"I will write for particulars, or, better still, your mother and I will go down to see the place for ourselves.  I should like you to go to the school you fancy, if it can be arranged, and I suppose this is as good as any.\"  \"Better!\"  Rhoda declared rapturously, \"a thousand times better!  Ella Mason said so; and she knows, because her cousin's sisters have all been at different schools--one at Cheltenham, one at Saint Andrew's, one at Wycombe, and she declares that Hurst beats them all.  It must be so, since it has adopted all the good ideas and abandoned the bad.\"  She went on with a rambling statement which seemed to imply that Miss Bruce had been in turn sole proprietor of each of these well-known schools before abandoning them in favour of her new establishment; that Hurst Manor buildings had been recently erected, at vast expense, to provide every possible convenience for the pupils, and at the same time was a nobleman's seat of venerable interest; that sports and games formed the chief interest of the pupils, lessons being relegated to an appropriate secondary position; while, astonishing to relate, the honours in all University examinations fell to \"Hurst girls,\" and every woman who had made a name for herself had graduated from its ranks!  She detailed these interesting items of information with sublime assurance; and, when Harold mildly pointed out inconsistencies, retorted scornfully that she supposed she might be allowed to know, since Ella's cousin had _said_ so, and she had been there, and seen for herself!  Mrs Chester supported her by murmurs of assent, and little warning frowns to her son, which in dumb language signified that he was to be a good boy, and not aggravate his sister; and Mr Chester put his arm round her waist, and looked down at her, half smiling, half pitiful.  The pitiful expression grew, and became so marked that the girl gazed at him in surprise.  Why did he look so sorry?  Was he already feeling the blank which her absence would leave?  Did he fear that she would be home-sick, and regret her hasty decision?  She stared into his face with her bright blue eyes, and her father gazed back, noting the firm chin, the arched brows, the characteristic tilt of the head.  This overweening confidence of youth--he was asking himself earnestly--was it altogether a misfortune, or but raw material out of which great things were to be made in the future?  Was it not better to go forth to meet life's battle with a light heart and fearless tread than trembling and full of doubt? Surely it was better, and yet his heart was sore for the girl, as the heart of a leader must be sore when he sends his soldiers to the front, knowing that no victory is won without a cost, no fight without a scar. Something very like a tear glittered in the father's eye, and at the sight Rhoda's face softened into a charming tenderness.  She snuggled her head into his neck, and rubbed her soft cheeks against his, murmuring absurd little sentences of endearment, as to a child of two years old.  \"Whose pet is it, then?  Whose own precious?  The nicest old sweet in the world.\"  Mr Chester pushed the girl aside, and put on a frown of portentous ferocity to conceal the delight with which her demonstration had, in reality, filled him.  He loved to feel the sweep of the crisp locks, the touch of the soft cheek; he even appreciated, if the truth must be told, being addressed as a \"precious,\" but wild horses would not have induced him to confess as much, and he made haste to leave the room with Harold lest perchance any sign of his real feelings might betray themselves to the sharp feminine eye.  Left alone with her mother, Rhoda clasped her hands behind her back, and paced slowly up and down.  It was a relief, after all, to be rid of the men, and be able to talk things over with a feminine hearer who never brought forward inconvenient quibbles, who accepted statements as facts, as of course they were, and agreed to propositions in a quiet, reasonable manner.  Rhoda thought out several important matters in that march to and fro, and announced the result in a decisive manner.  \"I must have a complete new outfit!  I don't believe in taking half-worn things.  You can send them away to that poor clergyman in Ireland, with the five daughters.  Geraldine, isn't it, who `fits' my clothes?  Well, Geraldine shall have my blue silk, and the fawn jacket, and the blouses, and the grey dress.  If the arm-holes stick into her as much as they do into me, she will wish I had never been invented.  She can have my best hat, too, if she wants it.  I hate it, and at `Hurst' you never wear anything but sailors', with the school colours.  There is a blue house, and a pink, and a green, and a yellow, and a red; that's the way they arrange in all big schools, and I only hope and pray it won't be my fate to be yellow, or _what_ an image I'll look!  Other things being equal, Mum dear, kindly say you think the blue house would be best for my health and morals.  I want to live _in_, you understand, not _out_-- that's one point I have quite decided.\"  \"In what, dearest?  Out of what?  I don't understand what you mean.\"  \"In school itself.  There are three houses in the school building and three in the grounds, and, of course, if you live `out' you have ten minutes' walk over to classes, whatever the weather may be.  I should object to shivering across the first thing in the morning in rain and snow and getting all splashed and blown.  No one can call me a coddle, but I _do_ like comfort, and it would be a dreadful fag--\"  \"I should think so, indeed; most risky!  I wouldn't hear of it for you. If you go at all you must live in, and have a comfortable room, with a fire in cold weather.\"  \"Oh, well; I don't know if you can expect that.  We mustn't be too exacting.  You will look after my clothes at once, mother, won't you? for there will be so much to get.  I want things nice, you know!  I should like the girls to see that I had decent belongings.  I love having all the _little_ things complete and dainty.  I think girls ought to be particular about them.  It's a sign of refinement.  I can't endure shabby things round me.\"  \"Of course not, darling; and there's no reason why you should.  Write down a list of what you want, so that we shan't forget anything when we are in town.  You shall have all you need; but, oh! dear me, I don't know how shall I live when you have gone.  I shall break my heart without you!\"  And Mrs Chester's tears once more rolled down her cheeks.  It seemed to her at this moment that the greatest trouble which her happy life had known was this projected parting from her beloved daughter.    CHAPTER THREE.  ANTICIPATIONS.  Two days later Mr and Mrs Chester started on their tour of inspection, and Rhoda reflected that she could not employ herself better during their absence than by preparing, so far as might be, for the life ahead. She went upstairs to her own sitting-room, and made a sweeping survey of her treasures.  The books in the hanging cases must, of course, be left behind, since they were too numerous to carry.  She looked lovingly at their bright gold and leather backs, and took down a special favourite here and there, to dip into its contents.  The Waverley novels ran in a long, yellow line across one shelf; Dickens, clad in red, came immediately beneath; and a whole row of poets on the bottom shelf. Wordsworth was a prize from Fraulein, but his pages were still stiff and unread; Longfellow opened of himself at \"Hiawatha\"; while Tennyson, most beloved of all, held half a dozen markers at favourite passages.  His portrait hung close at hand, a copy of that wonderful portrait by Watts, which seems to have immortalised all the power and beauty of the strange, sad face.  Rhoda nicked a grain of dust from the glass surface, and carefully straightened the frame against the wall, for this picture was one of her greatest treasures, and respected"]]]
