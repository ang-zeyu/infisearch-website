Go and fetch the big fir-pole that we laid across to begin the dam.  If that's laid down here Father Swythe can pull himself out.\"  \"Fetch it yourself!\" cried Bald angrily.  \"We're not your serfs.\"  \"I'm going to stop with Father Swythe,\" cried Alfred.  \"Good boy! good boy!\" whispered the monk.  \"And look here,\" cried Alfred angrily: \"it's cruel and wicked not to help him, and if you don't go I shall tell mother, and father will have you all punished severely.\"  \"Tell, if you dare!\" cried Bald, wringing out some of the water from the front of his tunic-like gown.  \"Come along, boys, and we'll get the fish without him.\"  Bald started off back to the stream, and the others followed him, the monk watching with piteous eyes till they were out of sight, when he turned his doleful, wrinkled face to his young companion, to tell him what he already knew.  \"They're gone,\" he said sadly.  \"Yes,\" said Alfred, laughing; \"but only to fetch the fir-pole.\"  \"Do you think so?\" sighed the monk.  \"Yes; they're afraid of my telling mother and making her angry.  She doesn't like us to do cruel things: she'd tell us we were like the Danes.  They'll come back soon with the pole, and then if you hold one end we can pull the other and draw you out.  But I say, Father Swythe, you're big and strong.  Don't you think if you were to try, you could get out on to the grass?  Try and struggle out before they come back.\"  \"But if I began to sink--\"  \"Then I should run and shout to the shepherds to come and pull you out.\"  \"But I shouldn't like you to leave me to sink alone, my boy.\"  \"It would be a long, long time before you were regularly mired,\" said the boy.  \"Now, you try!  Give me both hands.\"  Father Swythe did as he was told, and, while his young companion threw himself back and dragged, the monk kicked and struggled bravely, and with such good effect that, to the surprise of both, he glided slowly through the reeds, and in less than a minute he sat up panting on the short grass, with the water streaming from the front of his gown.  \"That was very brave and nice of you, my boy,\" he said, as he rose to his feet, \"and I shall never forget it.\"  \"Oh, it was easy enough!\" said Fred, laughing.  \"There, let's go over the hill, and when the boys come back they'll begin poking the pole about down among the reeds, and think we're both smothered.  No: here they come.  Look, they're bringing the pole.\"  Surely enough they were; but the monk did not stop.  He began trudging up hill through the hot sunshine so as to get back to take off his wet cassock and put on an old one that was dry, Fred choosing to stay with him and to talk about the bees and birds and flowers they passed, of which the monk could talk in an interesting way, even though it was a thousand years ago.  As for the three others, they threw down the pole as soon as they saw that the monk was safe, and then followed at a distance to the big castle-like house--the palace in which the King dwelt; but there was very little reading that afternoon; for there was too much to say about the fresh attack made by the Danes, who had come up the river and landed, to ravage the country.  Ethelwulf, who was not a very warlike King, was very anxious as to the result of the fight, and was busy getting more men together by means of his jarls or chiefs, so as to go to the help of those who had already set out.  In fact, instead of studying Latin and learning to write, the boys stood about learning something of the art of war, and what was to be done to defend their country when an invading enemy was ravaging the land.    CHAPTER THREE.  FRED IS LEFT BEHIND.  Time went on, and King Ethelwulf gathered and led off to the assistance of Jarl Cerda all the fighting-men he could assemble, as a wounded messenger had arrived from that noble, asking the King for more help, for he was sore pressed by the enemy.  The Danes, he sent word, were in great force, and more and more of their war-galleys kept coming up the river, the occupants slaying and destroying wherever they landed.  It was an anxious time for Queen Osburga, whose eyes often looked red as if she had been weeping, while her cheeks grew white and thin, and she shut herself up a great deal, so that no one should see her.  The men-folk had nearly all departed from the place, and there was no one to exercise authority, so, as soon as the four boys had recovered from their disappointment at not being allowed to go with the little army their father led, they began to look upon it as a free and jovial time in which they could do whatever pleased them most, and this they did to such an extent that poor Swythe's face became full of lines, and after trying in vain to make his pupils continue their studies, and putting up with a great amount of disobedience on their part, he began to reproach them in his mild way.  He was one of the gentlest and most amiable of men, but the wilfulness of the boys had at length compelled him to protest.  \"It seems so shocking,\" he said, rather piteously.  \"I only beg and pray of you all, now that the King is at the war and our dear lady the Queen in such sorrow and trouble, to try your best to get on with your lessons, so that the King may feel proud of his sons when he returns. Ethelbald laughs and mocks at me; Ethelbert says he will not study; Ethelred follows his example; and Alfred, of whom I expected better things, has just told me he does not mind a bit what I say, and that he will do just as he likes.\"  \"And so he shall!\" said Bald boldly.  \"That is, he shall do as I like. Father has gone to fight the Danes, and while he's away, as I am the eldest, I shall act in his place, and shall expect everyone to obey me as if I were King.\"  \"Oh, no, no, no,\" cried Swythe, looking shocked.  \"Our dear lady Osburga is Queen, and everyone must obey her.\"  \"Do not speak of that to me!\" cried Ethelbald.  \"She is only a woman, and cannot manage the men.  Why, if father should be killed--\"  \"Which Heaven forbid!\" cried Swythe, with a look of horror on his face. \"Oh, dear me, Ethelbald, what a thing for you to say!  Shocking, my dear boy.\"  \"I don't want him to be killed,\" cried Bald.  \"Of course not.  But if he should be killed I shall become King directly, and I shall order everybody to do what I like, and no one will dare to say a word.  The first thing I shall do,\" he continued, with a laugh, \"will be to send old Swythe away, so that there will be no more learning Latin, boys, and no crabbing fingers up to hold tens.\"  The three brothers said something with a shout which in those days answered to \"Hooray!\" and then Alfred, who had shouted the loudest, being the youngest and ready to think brother Bald's words very brave and fine, suddenly began to feel uncomfortable; for he had a certain amount of fear of the monk his master, and felt a kind of shrinking from rebelling against his authority.  He glanced sidewise at Father Swythe and saw that his eyes glimmered in a peculiar way as if water was rising in them.  Directly afterwards his heart felt a little sore, and a sense of shame began to trouble him, for there was no mistake: Father Swythe's eyes were wet and his voice sounded hoarse and strange as he said sadly:  \"You would not send me away, Ethelbald?  I have always tried to do my duty to the young sons of my lord the King and have tried to make them grow into scholarly princes fit to rule the land.\"  \"Bah!  We do not want to be scholarly!\" cried Bald scornfully.  \"We want to learn to be brave soldiers, so that we can go forth and beat the Danes.\"  \"Yes,\" said the monk sadly; \"but, my boys, the warrior who's a scholar as well is more brave and noble and merciful, and his name is one that lives longer in the land.  Ah, well, you have made me very sad.  I had hoped that I had done something to make the sons of my dear lady the Queen love me; but if they do not it would be better perhaps that I should go back to my cell at the old abbey, where I could be happy with my parchments and my pens.\"  The old monk sighed and turned away; he appeared to have received a shock which had broken his heart.  The three elder boys were laughing and joking about the matter, and suddenly Ethelbald cried out:  \"Come along, boys!  Bows and arrows.  I saw a roebuck feeding outside the oak wood.  Here, we'll take spears with us too to-day.  Let old Swythe teach the swineherds' boys to read Latin instead of minding the little pigs hunting for acorns.\"  \"No spears left!\" said Bert.  \"The men took them all when they went away!\" said Red.  \"Then let's go without!\" said Bald.  Alfred said nothing; he was watching the monk going slowly and sadly away, and somehow the little figure did not look comic to him then, even if it was short and plump and round.  \"Where's Fred?\" cried Bald the next minute, when the boys were getting their bows and quivers.  His brothers could not tell him where Alfred was; so after a few moments pause, Ethelbald said:  \"Never mind: let's go without him.  Hers too young and weak to do what we do.  Let him stay behind and learn Latin with old Swythe.\"  \"He did go out after him,\" said Bert.  \"Yes, I saw him.  I remember now,\" cried Red.  His last words were almost smothered by his eldest brother, who raised to his lips a curling cow-horn tipped with a copper mouthpiece and strengthened with a ring at the head end.  He proceeded to blow into it, but failed to produce anything more huntsman-like than a kind of bray such as might be uttered by a jackass suffering from a sore-throat.  But it was good enough to send all the dogs about the place frantic, and away the three boys went, followed by a pack of hounds, some of which would have been as ready to tackle wolf or boar as to dash after the lordly stag or the big-eyed, prong-horned, graceful roes of which there were many about the forest lands which surrounded the King's home.

Mike Bannock stood with his hands clasping the handle of the crane winch against which he leaned without moving, but his eyes were hard at work.  He followed Don with them till he had disappeared through the low dark doorway, then glanced at the closed gate leading into the busy street, and then at the open office door, a few yards away.  All was still, save the buzzing of the flies about the casks on that hot midsummer's day, and without the trace of a limp, the man stepped rapidly into the office, but only to dart back again in alarm, for, all at once, there was a loud rattling noise of straps, chains, and heavy harness.  There was no cause for alarm.  It was only the fat, sleepy horse in the trolly shafts, who, at the same time that he gave his nosebag a toss, shook himself violently to get rid of the flies which preferred his juices to the sugar oozing from many a hogshead's seams.  Mike darted into the office again; the flies buzzed; the horse munched oats; the faint sound of Don's voice in converse with Jem Wimble could he heard; then there was a faint click as if a desk had been shut down softly, and Mike stepped out again, gave a hasty glance round, and the next moment was standing dreamily with his eyes half-closed, grasping the handle of the crane winch as Don returned, closely followed by Jem Wimble.  \"Now, Mas' Don, I'll just mark another,\" said Jem, \"and we'll have him out.\"  He took a lump of chalk from a ledge close by, and ascended a step ladder to a door about six feet above the spot where Mike stood, and Don stood with his book under his arm, his brow rugged, and a thoughtful look in his eyes.  Just then the small door in the yard gate was opened, and a sturdy-looking grey-haired man in snuff-coloured coat and cocked hat, drab breeches and gaiters, entered unseen by the pair, who had their backs to him.  \"I 'member, Mas' Don, when I were out in the _Mary Anne_ five year ago. We'd got to Pannymah, when the skipper stood with his glass to his eye, looking at a strange kind o' hobjick ashore, and he says to me, `Mike, my lad--'\"  \"You idle scoundrel!  How many more times am I to tell you that I will not have my time wasted over those lying stories of yours?  Lindon, am I ever to be able to trust you when business takes me away?\"  The words came in short sharp tones, and the speaker's dark eyes seemed to flash.  The effect was marvellous.  Mike began to turn the handle at a rapid rate, winding up the rope till the pair of hooks used for grasping the great hogsheads rattled with their chains against the pulley wheels of the crane, and a shout came from the warehouse,--  \"Whatcher doing of?  Hold hard!\"  \"Stop, sir!\" cried the stern-looking man to Mike, just as Jem appeared at the upper doorway and looked down.  \"Oh!\" he ejaculated.  \"Didn't know as you was there, sir.\"  \"It is disgraceful, Lindon.  The moment my back is turned you leave your desk to come and waste the men's time.  I am ashamed of you.\"  Lindon's forehead grew more wrinkled as Josiah Christmas, merchant of Bristol city, and his maternal uncle, walked into the office, whither the lad followed slowly, looking stubborn and ill-used, for Mike Bannock's poison was at work, and in his youthful ignorance and folly, he felt too angry to attempt a frank explanation.  In fact, just then one idea pervaded his mind--two ideas--that his uncle was a tyrant, and that he ought to strike against his tyranny and be free.    CHAPTER TWO.  BLIND AS BATS.  That same evening Don Lavington did not walk home with his uncle, but hung back to see Jem Wimble lock-up, and then sauntered slowly with him toward the little low house by the entrance gates, where the yard-man, as he was called, lived in charge.  Jem had been in the West India merchant's service from a boy, and no one was more surprised than he when on the death of old Topley, Josiah Christmas said to him one morning,--  \"Wimble, you had better take poor old Topley's place.\"  \"And--and take charge of the yard, sir?\"  \"Yes.  I can trust you, can't I?\"  \"Oh, yes, sir; but--\"  \"Ah!  Yes.  You have no wife to put in the cottage.\"  Jem began to look foolish, and examine the lining of his hat.  \"Well, sir, if it comes to that,\" he faltered; and there was a weak comical aspect in his countenance which made Don burst out laughing.  \"I know, uncle,\" he cried, \"he has got a sweetheart.\"  \"Well, Master Don,\" said the young man, colouring up; \"and nothing to be ashamed on neither.\"  \"Certainly not,\" said the merchant quietly.  \"You had better get married, Wimble, and you can have the cottage.  I will buy and lend you old Topley's furniture.\"  Wimble begged pardon afterwards, for on hearing all this astounding news, he rushed out of the office, pulled off his leather apron, put on his coat as he ran, and disappeared for an hour, at the end of which time he returned, went mysteriously up to Don and whispered,--  \"It's all right, sir; she says she will.\"  The result was that Jem Wimble looked twice as important, and cocked his cocked hat on one side, for he had ten shillings a week more, and the furnished cottage, kept the keys, kept the men's time, and married a wife who bore a most extraordinary likeness to a pretty little bantam hen.  This was three months before the scene just described, but though Jem spoke in authoritative tones to the men, it was with bated breath to his little wife, who was standing in the doorway looking as fierce as a kitten, when Jem walked up in company with his young master.  \"Which I will not find fault before Master Lindon, Jem,\" she said; \"but you know I do like you to be home punctual to tea.\"  \"Yes, my dear, of course, of course,\" said Jem, apologetically.  \"Not much past time, and had to shut up first.\"  \"That's what you always say when you're late.  You don't know, Master Don, what a life he leads me.\"  \"'Tain't true, Master Don,\" cried Jem.  \"She's always a-wherritting me.\"  \"Now I appeal to Master Don: was it me, sir, as was late?  There's the tea ready, and the bread and butter cut, and the watercresses turning limp, and the flies getting at the s'rimps.  It arn't your fault, sir, I know, and I'm not grumbling, but there never was such a place as this for flies.\"  \"It's the sugar, Sally,\" said Don, who had sauntered aimlessly in with Jem, and as he stared round the neat little kitchen with the pleasant meal all ready, he felt as if he should like to stay to tea instead of going home.  \"Yes, it's the sugar, sir, I know; and you'd think it would sweeten some people's temper, but it don't.\"  \"Which if it's me you mean, and you're thinking of this morning--\"  \"Which I am, Jem, and you ought to be ashamed.  You grumbled over your breakfast, and you reg'larly worried your dinner, and all on account of a button.\"  \"Well, then, you should sew one on.  When a man's married he does expect to find buttons on his clean shirts.\"  \"Yes, and badly enough you want 'em, making 'em that sticky as you do.\"  \"I can't help that; it's only sugar.\"  \"Only sugar indeed!  And if it was my last words I'd say it--there _was_ a button on the neck.\"  \"Well, I know that,\" cried Jem; \"and what's the good of a button being on, if it comes off directly you touch it?  Is it any good, Mas' Don?\"  \"Oh, don't ask me,\" cried the lad, half-amused, half annoyed, and wishing they'd ask him to tea.  \"He dragged it off, Master Don.\"  \"I didn't.\"  \"You did, Jem, and you know you did, just to aggravate me.\"  \"Wasn't half sewn on.\"  \"It was.  I can't sew your buttons on with copper wire.\"  \"You two are just like a girl and boy,\" cried Don.  \"Here you have everything comfortable about you, and a good place, and you're always quarrelling.\"  \"Well, it's his fault, sir.\"  \"No, sir, it's her'n.\"  \"It's both your faults, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.\"  \"I'm not,\" said Sally; \"and I wish I'd never seen him.\"  \"And I'm sure I wish the same,\" said Jem despondently.  \"I never see such a temper.\"  \"There, Master Don,\" cried the droll-looking little Dutch doll of a woman.  \"That's how he is always going on.\"  \"There, Jem, now you've made your poor little wife cry.  You are the most discontented fellow I ever saw.\"  \"Come, I like that, Master Don; you've a deal to brag about, you have. Why, you're all at sixes and sevens at home.\"  This was such a home thrust that Don turned angrily and walked out of the place.  \"There!\" cried Sally.  \"I always knew how it would be.  Master Don was the best friend we had, and now you've offended him, and driven him away.\"  \"Shouldn't ha' said nasty things then,\" grumbled Jem, sitting down and attacking his tea.  \"Now he'll go straight to his uncle and tell him what a man you are.\"  \"Let him,\" said Jem, with his mouth full of bread and butter.  \"And of course you'll lose your place, and we shall be turned out into the street to starve.\"  \"Will you be quiet, Sally?  How's a man to eat his tea with you going on like that?\"  \"Turned out into the world without a chance of getting another place. Oh!  It's too bad.  Why did I ever marry such a man as you?\"  \"'Cause you were glad of the chance,\" grumbled Jem, raising his hand to pour out some tea, but it was pushed aside indignantly, and the little woman busily, but with a great show of indignation, filled and sweetened her husband's cup, which she dabbed down before him, talking all the while, and finishing with,--  \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Jem.\"  \"I am,\" he grumbled.  \"Ashamed that I was ever such a stupid as to marry a girl who's always dissatisfied.  Nice home you make me.\"  \"And a nice home you make me, sir; and don't eat your victuals so fast. It's like being at the wild beast show.\"  \"That's right; go on,\" grumbled Jem, doubling his rate of consumption. \"Grudge me my meals now.  Good job if we could undo it all, and be as we was.\"  \"I wish we could,\" cried the little woman, whose eyes seemed to say that her lips were"]]]
