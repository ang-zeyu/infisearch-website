Why are you not correcting course and acceleration?\"  \"Doctor Stevens is computing us and has full control of course and acceleration,\" replied Breckenridge. \"He will answer you.\"  \"I am changing neither course nor acceleration because you are not in position,\" declared Stevens, crisply, \"Please give me your present supposed location, and your latest precision goniometer bearings on the sun, the moon, Mars, Venus, and your Tellurian reference limb, with exact time of observations, gyroscope zero-planes, and goniometer factors!\"  \"Correct at once or I shall report you to the Observatory,\" E2 answered loftily, paying no attention to the demand for proof of position.  \"Be sure you do that, guy--and while you're at it report that your station hasn't taken a precision bearing in a month. Report that you've been muddling along on radio loop bearings, and that you don't know where you are, within seven thousand kilometers. And speaking of reporting--I know already that a lot of you astronomical guessers have only the faintest possible idea of where you really are, _plus_, _minus_, or lateral; and if you don't get yourselves straightened out before we get to W41, I'm going to make a report on my own account that will jar some of you birds loose from your upper teeth!\" He unplugged with a vicious jerk, and turned to the pilot with a grin.  \"Guess that'll hold him for a while, won't it?\"  \"He'll report us, sure,\" remonstrated Breckenridge. The older man was plainly ill at ease at this open defiance of the supposedly infallible check-stations.  \"Not that baby,\" returned the computer confidently. \"I'll bet you a small farm against a plugged nickel that right now he's working his goniometer so hard that it's pivots are getting hot. He'll sneak back into position as soon as he can calculate his results, and pretend he's always been there.\"  \"The others will be all right, then, probably, by the time we get to them?\"  \"Gosh, no--you're unusually dumb today, Breck. He won't tell anybody anything--he doesn't want to be the only goat, does he?\"  \"Oh, I see. How could you dope this out, with only the recorder charts?\"  \"Because I know the kind of stuff you pilots are--and those humps are altogether too big to be accounted for by anything I know about you. Another thing--the next station, P6, I think is keeping himself all x. If so, when you corrected for E2, which was wrong, it'd throw you all off on P6, which was right, and so on--a bad hump at almost every check-station. See?\"         *       *       *       *       *  True to prediction, the pilot ray of P6 came in almost upon the exact center of the micrometer screen, and Breckenridge smiled in relief as he began really to enjoy the trip.  \"How do we check on chronometers?\" asked P6 when Stevens had been introduced. \"By my time you seem to be about two and a half seconds _plus_?\"  \"All x--two points four seconds plus--we're riding on 981.286 centimeters, to allow for the reversal and for minor detours. Bye.\"  \"All this may have been coincidence, Breck, but we'll find out pretty quick now,\" the computer remarked when the flying vessel was nearing the third check-station. \"Unless I'm all out of control we'll check in almost fourteen seconds minus on W41, and we may not even find him on the center block of the screen.\"  When he plugged in W41 was on the block, but was in the extreme upper right corner. They checked in thirteen and eight-tenths seconds minus on the station, and a fiery dialogue ensued when the computer questioned the accuracy of the location of the station and refused point-blank to correct his course.  \"Well, Breck, old onion, that tears it,\" Stevens declared as he unplugged. \"No use going any further on these bum reference points. I'm going to report to Newton--he'll rock the Observatory on its foundations!\" He plugged into the telegraph room. \"Have you got a free high-power wave?... Please put me on Newton, in the main office.\"  Moving lights flashed and flickered for an instant upon the communicator screen, settling down into a white glow which soon resolved itself into the likeness of a keen-eyed, gray-haired man, seated at his desk in the remote office of the Interplanetary Corporation. Newton smiled as he recognized the likeness of Stevens upon his own screen, and greeted him cordially.  \"Have you started your investigation, Doctor Stevens?\"  \"Started it? I've finished it!\" and Stevens tersely reported what he had learned, concluding: \"So you see, you don't need special computers on these ships any more than a hen needs teeth. You've got all the computers you need, in the observatories--all you've got to do is make them work at their trade.\"  \"The piloting was all x, then?\"  \"Absolutely--our curve so far is exactly flat ever since we cut off the starting power. Of course, all the pilots can't be as good as Breckenridge, but give them good computation and good check points and you shouldn't get any humps higher than about half a centimeter.\"  \"They'll get both, from now on,\" the director assured him. \"Thanks. If your work for the trip is done, you might show my little girl, Nadia, around the _Arcturus_. She's never been out before, and will be interested. Would you mind?\"  \"Glad to, Mr. Newton--I'll be a regular uncle to her.\"  \"Thanks again, Operator, I'll speak to Captain King, please.\"  \"Pipe down that guff, you unlicked cub, or I'll crown you with a proof-bar!\" the chief pilot growled, as soon as Stevens had unplugged.  \"You and who else?\" retorted the computer, cheerfully. \"Pipe down yourself, guy--if you weren't so darn dumb and didn't have such a complex, you'd know that you're the crack pilot of the outfit and wouldn't care who else knew it.\" Stevens carefully covered and put away the calculating machine and other apparatus he had been using and turned again to the pilot.  \"I didn't know Newton had any kids, especially little ones, or I'd have got acquainted with them long ago. Of course I don't know him very well, since I never was around the office much, but the old tiger goes over big with me.\"  \"Hm--m. Think you'll enjoy playing nursemaid all the rest of the trip?\" Breckenridge asked caustically, but with an enigmatic smile.  \"Think so? I _know_ so!\" replied Stevens, positively. \"I always did like kids, and they always did like me--we fall for each other like ten thousand bricks falling down a well. Why, a kid--_any_ kid--and I team up just like grace and poise.... What's gnawing on you anyway, to make you turn Cheshire cat all of a sudden? By the looks of that grin I'd say you had swallowed a canary of mine some way or other; but darned if I know that I've lost any,\" and he stared at his friend suspiciously.  \"To borrow your own phrase, Steve, 'You'd be surprised,'\" and Breckenridge, though making no effort to conceal his amusement, would say no more.  In a few minutes the door opened, and through it there stepped a grizzled four-striper. Almost hidden behind his massive form there was a girl, who ran up to Breckenridge and seized both his hands, her eyes sparkling.  \"Hi, Breckie, you old darling! I knew that if we both kept after him long enough Dad would let me ride with you sometime. Isn't this _gorgeous_?\"  Stevens was glad indeed that the girl's enthusiastic greeting of the pilot was giving him time to recover from his shock, for Director Newton's \"little girl, Nadia\" was not precisely what he had led himself to expect. Little she might be, particularly when compared with the giant frame of Captain King, or with Steve's own five-feet-eleven of stature and the hundred and ninety pounds of rawhide and whalebone that was his body, but child she certainly was not. Her thick, fair hair, cut in the square bob that was the mode of the moment, indicated that Nature had intended her to be a creamy blonde, but as she turned to be introduced to him, Stevens received another surprise--for she was one of those rare, but exceedingly attractive beings, a natural blonde with brown eyes and black eyebrows. Sun and wind had tanned her satin skin to a smooth and even shade of brown, and every movement of her lithe and supple body bespoke to the discerning mind a rigidly-trained physique.  \"Doctor Stevens, you haven't met Miss Newton, I hear,\" the captain introduced them informally. \"All the officers who are not actually tied down at their posts are anxious to do the honors of the vessel, but as I have received direct orders from the owners, I am turning her over to you--you are to show her around.\"  \"Thanks, Captain, I won't mutiny a bit against such an order. I'm mighty glad to know you, Miss Newton.\"  \"I've heard a lot about you, Doctor. Dad and Breckie here are always talking about the Big Three--what you have done and what you are going to do. I want to meet Doctor Brandon and Doctor Westfall, too,\" and her hand met his in a firm and friendly clasp. She turned to the captain, and Stevens, noticing that the pilot, with a quizzical expression, was about to say something, silenced him with a fierce aside.  \"Clam it, ape, or I'll climb up you like a squirrel!\" he hissed, and the grinning Breckenridge nodded assent to this demand for silence concerning children and nursemaids.  \"Since you've never been out, Miss Newton, you'll want to see the whole works,\" Stevens addressed the girl. \"Where do you want to begin? Shall we start at the top and work down?\"  \"All right with me,\" she agreed, and fell into step beside him. She was dressed in dove-gray from head to foot--toque, blouse, breeches, heavy stockings, and shoes were of the one shade of smooth, lustrous silk; and as they strolled together down the passage-way, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20859"],["title","Wandl the Invader (#1)"],["body","he wants me, too?\" I put in.  \"Yes. You and Venza. We've got to get into his office secretly, by the vacuum cylinders. We're to meet a man from his office at the Eighth Postal switch-station.\"  \"Venza?\" Anita said sharply. \"What in the universe can he want with Venza? If she's going, I'm going too!\"  Snap gazed at her and grinned. \"That sounds like a logical deduction. Naturally he must want you; that's why he said Venza.\"  \"I'm going,\" Anita insisted.  We left half an hour before midnight. The girls were both in gray, with long capes. We took the public monorail into the mid-Manhattan section under the city roof of the business district, and into the Eighth Postal switch-station where the sleek bronze cylinders came tumbling out of the vacuum ports to be re-routed and dispatched again.  A man was on the lookout for us. \"Daniel Dean and party?\"  \"Yes. We were ordered here.\"  The detective gazed at the girls and at me. \"It was three, Dean.\"  \"And now it's four,\" said Snap cheerfully. \"The extra one is Miss Anita Prince. Ever heard of her?\"  He had indeed. \"All right,\" he said. \"If you and Haljan say so.\"  We were put into one of the oversized mail cylinders and routed through the tubes like sacks of recorded letters; in ten minutes, with a thump that knocked the breath out of all of us, we were in the switch-rack of Halsey's outer office.  We clambered from the cylinder. Our guide led us down one of the gloomy metal corridors. It echoed with our tread.  A door lifted.  \"Daniel Dean and party.\"  The guard stood aside. \"Come in.\"  The door slid down behind us. We advanced into the small blue-lit apartment, steel-lined like a vault.     2   Colonel Halsey sat at his desk, with a few papers before him and a bank of instrument controls at his elbow. He pushed his audiphone and mirror-grid to one side.  \"Sit down, please.\" He gave us each the benefit of a welcoming smile, and his gaze finished upon Anita.  \"I came because you sent for Venza,\" Anita said quickly. \"Please, Colonel Halsey, let me stay. I thought, whatever you want her for, you might need me, too.\"  \"Quite so, Miss Prince. Perhaps I shall.\" It seemed that in his mind were many of the thoughts thronging my own, for he added: \"Haljan, I recall I sent for you like this once before. I hope this may be a more auspicious occasion.\"  \"So do I, sir.\"  Snap said, \"We've been afraid hardly to do more than a whisper. But you're insulated here, and we're mighty curious.\"  Halsey nodded. \"I can talk freely to you, and yet I cannot.\" His gaze went to Venza. \"It is you in whom I am most interested.\"  \"Me? You flatter me, Colonel Halsey.\" She sat gracefully reclining in the metal chair before his desk, seeming small as a child between its big, broad arms. Her long gray skirt had parted to display her shapely, gray-satined legs. She had thrown off the hood of her cloak. Her thick black hair was coiled in a knot low at the back of her neck; her carmine lips bore an alluring smile. It was all instinctive. To this girl from Venus it came as naturally as she breathed.  Halsey's gray eyes twinkled. \"Do not look at me quite like that, Miss Venza, or I shall forget what I have to say. You would get the better of me; I'm glad you're not a criminal.\"  \"So am I,\" she declared. \"What can I do for you, Colonel Halsey?\"  His smile faded at once. His glance included us all. \"Just this. There is a man here in Greater New York, a Martian whom they call _Set_ Molo. He has a younger sister, _Setta_ Meka. Have any of you heard of them?\"  We had not. Halsey went on, slowly now, apparently choosing his words with the greatest care. \"There are things that I can tell you and there are things that I cannot.\"  \"Why not?\" asked Venza.  \"My dear, for one thing, if you are going to help me you can do it best by not knowing too much. For another, I have my orders; this thing concerns the very highest authorities, not only of the U.S.W., but in Ferrok-Shahn and Grebhar too.\"  He paused, but none of us spoke. Then Halsey said quietly, \"Well, this Martian and his sister are here now in Greater New York. They have some secret. They are engaged in some activity, and I want to find out what it is. I have picked up only little parts of it.\"  He stopped; and out of the silence Snap said, \"If you don't mind, Colonel Halsey, it seems to me you are mostly talking in code.\"  \"I'm not, but I'm trying to tell you as little as possible. You, Miss Venza, need only understand this: the Martian, Molo, must be induced to give you some idea of what he is doing here.\"  \"And I am to induce him?\" Venza asked calmly.  \"That is my idea.\" The faint shadow of a smile swept Halsey's thin, intent face. \"My dear, you are a girl of Venus. More than that, you have far more than your normal share of wits and brains.\"  It did not make Venza smile. She sat tense now, with her dark-eyed gaze fastened on Halsey's face. Anita, equally breathless, reached over and gripped her hand.  Then Venza said slowly, \"I realize, Colonel Halsey, that this is something vital.\"  \"As vital, my child, as it could be.\" He drew a long breath. \"I want you to understand I am doing my duty. Doing, what seems the best thing, not for you, perhaps, but for the world.\"  I seemed to see into his mind at that moment. He might have been a father, sending a daughter into danger.  \"I need not disguise the danger. I have lost a dozen men.\" He lighted a cigarette. \"I don't seem to be able to frighten you?\"  \"No,\" she said. And I heard Anita murmur, \"Oh, Venza!\"  \"But you frighten me,\" said Snap. \"Colonel, look here; you know I'm going to marry this girl very soon.\"  \"Yes, I know. You'll have to consider this a sacrifice, a voluntary descent into danger, for a great cause in a great crisis. You four have just come out of a very considerable danger. We know of what stuff you are made, all of you.\"  He smiled again. \"Perhaps that prominence is unfortunate for you, but let me settle it now. Is there any one of you who will not take my orders and trust my judgement of what is best? And do it, if need be, blindly? Will you offer yourselves to me?\"  We gazed at each other. Both the girls instantly murmured, \"Yes.\"  \"Yes,\" I said at last. It was not too hard for me, for I thought I was yielding him Venza, not Anita.  Snap was very pale. He stared from one to the other of us.  \"Yes,\" he said finally. \"But Colonel, surely you can tell us more.\"  Halsey tossed his cigarette away. \"I will tell you as much as I think best. These Martians, Molo and his sister, do not know of Venza; at least, I think that they do not. They apparently have not been here very long. How they got here, we don't know. There was no passenger or freight ship. In Ferrok-Shahn, they have a dubious reputation at best; but I won't go into that.  \"Venza, I will show you these Martians and the rest depends upon you. There is a mystery; you will find out what it is.\"  He reached for his inter-office audiphone. \"I want to locate the Martian _Set_ Molo. Francis, Staff X2, has it in charge.\"  The audible connection came in a moment. \"Francis?\"  We could hear the answering microphonic voice, \"Yes Colonel.\"  \"Is the fellow in a public place by any chance?\"  \"In the Red Spark Cafe, Colonel. With his sister and a party.\"  \"Good enough. The Red Spark has an image-finder. Have you visual connection?\"  \"Yes, the whole room; they have a dozen finders.\"  \"Use a magnifier. Get me the closest view you can.\"  \"It's done, Colonel. I did it just in case you called.\"  \"Connect it.\"  In a moment our mirror-grid was glowing with the two-foot square image of the interior of the Red Spark Cafe. I knew the place by reputation: a fashionable, more or less disreputable eating, drinking and dancing restaurant, where money and alcholite flowed freely. The patrons were successful criminals of the three worlds, intermingled with thrilled, respectable tourists who hoped they would see something really evil.  The Red Spark was not far from Halsey's office; it was perched high in a break of the city roof, almost directly over Park-Circle 29.  \"There he is,\" said Halsey.  We crowded around his desk. The image showed the interior of a large oval room, balconied and terraced; a dais dance-floor, raised high in the center with three professional couples gyrating there; and beneath them the public dance-grid, slowly rotating on its central axis. A hundred or so couples were dancing. The lower floor was crowded with dining tables; others were upon the little catwalk balconies, and still others in the terraced nooks and side niches, half-enshrouded, half-revealed by colored draperies.  The image now was silent, for Halsey was not bothering with audio connection. But it was a riot of color, flashing colored floodlights bathing the dancers in vivid tints; and there were twinkling spots of colored tube-lights on all the tables. I saw, too, the blank rectangles of darkness against the walls which marked the private dining rooms, insulated against sight and sound. Here one might go for frivolous indiscretion, or for conspiracy, perhaps, and be as secure from interruption as we were, here in Halsey's office.  Venza asked eagerly, \"Which is he?\"  \"Over there on the third terrace to the left. That table. There seem to be six of them in the party.\"  We heard Francis' voice; he was in Halsey's lower Manhattan office, with this same image before him. \"We'll get a closer view.\"  The table in question was no more than a square inch on our image. We could see an apparently gay party of men and women. One of the couples was gigantic, a Martian man and woman, obviously. The others seemed to be Earth or Venus people.  Francis' voice added: \"I've got an audio magnifier on them. Foley's been listening for an hour. Nice, clear English. Much good it does us; this fellow is as cautious as a director of the lower air-lane. Here's your near-look.\"  Our image shifted to another view. The lens-eye with which we were connected now gave us a view directly over the Martian's "]]]
