[Illustration: BANK OF CORTEZ.]  Notice the bonds Nos. 18 and 27. Do you notice the listening attitude of No. 18? He is listening to the accumulating interest. Note the aged and haggard look of No. 27. He has just begun to notice that he is maturing.  Cast your eye on the prone form of No. 31. He has just fallen due, and in doing so has hurt his crazy-bone (see Appendix).  Be good enough to study the gold-bearing bond behind the screen. See the look of anguish. Some one has cut off a coupon probably. Cortez was that kind of a man. He would clip the ear of an Inca and make him scream with pain, so that his friends would come in and redeem him. Once the bank examiner came to examine the Cortez bank. He imparted a pleasing flavor on the following day to the soup.  Spain owned at the close of the sixteenth century the West Indies, Yucatan, Mexico, and Florida, besides unlimited water facilities and the Peruvian preserves.  North Carolina was discovered by the French navigator Verrazani, thirty years later than Cabot did, but as Cabot did not record his claim at the court-house in Wilmington the Frenchman jumped the claim in 1524, and the property remained about the same till again discovered by George W. Vanderbilt in the latter part of the present century.  Montreal was discovered in 1535 by Cartier, also a Frenchman.  Ribaut discovered South Carolina, and left thirty men to hold it. They were at that time the only white men from-Mexico to the North Pole, and a keen business man could have bought the whole thing, Indians and all, for a good team and a jug of nepenthe. But why repine?  The Jesuit missionaries about the middle of the seventeenth century pushed their way to the North Mississippi and sought to convert the Indians. The Jesuits deserve great credit for their patience, endurance, and industry, but they were shocked to find the Indian averse to work. They also advanced slowly in church work, and would often avoid early mass that they might catch a mess of trout or violate the game law by killing a Dakotah in May.  [Illustration: CONVERTING INDIANS.]  Father Marquette discovered the Upper Mississippi not far from a large piece of suburban property owned by the author, north of Minneapolis. The ground has not been disturbed since discovered by Father Marquette.  The English also discovered America from time to time, the Cabots finding Labrador while endeavoring to go to Asia via the North, and Frobisher discovered Baffin Bay in 1576 while on a like mission. The Spanish discovered the water mostly, and England the ice belonging to North America.  Sir Francis Drake also discovered the Pacific Ocean, and afterward sailed an English ship on its waters, discovering Oregon.  Sir Walter Raleigh, with the endorsement of his half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, regarding the idea of colonization of America, and being a great friend of Queen Elizabeth, got out a patent on Virginia.  He planted a colony and a patch of tobacco on Roanoke Island, but the colonists did not care for agriculture, preferring to hunt for gold and pearls. In this way they soon ran out of food, and were constantly harassed by Indians.  [Illustration: COULD NOT REACH THEM.]  It was an odd sight to witness a colonist coming home after a long hard day hunting for pearls as he asked his wife if she would be good enough to pull an arrow out of some place which he could not reach himself.  Raleigh spent two hundred thousand dollars in his efforts to colonize Virginia, and then, disgusted, divided up his patent and sold county rights to it at a pound apiece. This was in 1589. Raleigh learned the use of smoking tobacco at this time.  [Illustration: RALEIGH'S ASTONISHMENT.]  He was astonished when he tried it first, and threatened to change his boarding-place or take his meals out, but soon enjoyed it, and before he had been home a week Queen Elizabeth thought it to be an excellent thing for her house plants. It is now extensively used in the best narcotic circles.  [Illustration: RALEIGH'S ENJOYMENT.]  Several other efforts were made by the English to establish colonies in this country, but the Indians thought that these English people bathed too much, and invited perspiration between baths.  One can see readily that the Englishman with his portable bath-tub has been a flag of defiance from the earliest discoveries till this day.  This chapter brings us to the time when settlements were made as follows:    The French at Port Royal, N.S.,  1605.   The English at Jamestown         1607.   The French at Quebec             1608.   The Dutch at New York            1613.   The English at Plymouth          1620.         *       *       *       *       *       The author's thanks are due to the following books of reference,      which, added to his retentive memory, have made the foregoing      statements accurate yet pleasing:       A Summer in England with H.

This chapter is given up almost wholly to facts. It deals largely with the beginning of the thirteen original colonies from which sprang the Republic, the operation of which now gives so many thousands of men in-door employment four years at a time, thus relieving the penitentiaries and throwing more kindergarten statesmen to the front.  [Illustration: SAMPLE PURITAN.]  It was during this epoch that the Cavaliers landed in Virginia and the Puritans in Massachusetts; the latter lived on maple sugar and armed prayer, while the former saluted his cow, and, with bared head, milked her with his hat in one hand and his life in the other.  Immigration now began to increase along the coast. The Mayflower began to bring over vast quantities of antique furniture, mostly hall-clocks for future sales. Hanging them on spars and masts during rough weather easily accounts for the fact that none of them have ever been known to go.  [Illustration]  The Puritans now began to barter with the Indians, swapping square black bottles of liquid hell for farms in Massachusetts and additions to log towns. Dried apples and schools began to make their appearance. The low retreating forehead of the codfish began to be seen at the stores, and virtue began to break out among the Indians after death.  Virginia, however, deserves mention here on the start. This colony was poorly prepared to tote wood and sleep out-of-doors, as the people were all gents by birth. They had no families, but came to Virginia to obtain fortunes and return to the city of New York in September. The climate was unhealthy, and before the first autumn, says Sir William Kronk, from whom I quote, \"ye greater numberr of them hade perished of a great Miserrie in the Side and for lacke of Food, for at thatte time the Crosse betweene the wilde hyena and the common hogge of the Holy Lande, and since called the Razor Backe Hogge, had not been made, and so many of the courtiers dyede.\"  John Smith saved the colony. He was one of the best Smiths that ever came to this country, which is as large an encomium as a man cares to travel with. He would have saved the life of Pocahontas, an Indian girl who also belonged to the gentry of their tribe, but she saw at once that it would be a point for her to save him, so after a month's rehearsal with her father as villain, with Smith's part taken by a chunk of blue-gum wood, they succeeded in getting this little curtain-raiser to perfection.  Pocahontas was afterwards married, if the author's memory does not fail him, to John Rolfe. Pocahontas was not beautiful, but many good people sprang from her. She never touched them. Her husband sprang from her also just in time. The way she jumped from a clay-eating crowd into the bosom of the English aristocracy by this dramatic ruse was worthy of a greater recognition than merely to figure among the makers of smoking-tobacco with fancy wrappers, when she never had a fancy wrapper in her life.  Smith was captured once by the Indians, and, instead of telling them that he was by birth a gent, he gave them a course of lectures on the use of the compass and how to learn where one is at. Thus one after another the Indians went away. I often wonder why the lecture is not used more as a means of escape from hostile people.  [Illustration: THE REHEARSAL.]  By writing a letter and getting a reply to it, he made another hit. He now became a great man among the Indians; and to kill a dog and fail to invite Smith to the symposium was considered as vulgar as it is now to rest the arctic overshoe on the corner of the dining-table while buckling or unbuckling it.  Afterward Smith fell into the hands of Powhatan, the Croker of his time, and narrowly saved his life, as we have seen, through the intervention of Pocahontas.  Smith was now required in England to preside at a dinner given by the Savage Club, and to tell a few stories of life in the Far West.  While he was gone the settlement became a prey to disease and famine. Some were killed by the Indians while returning from their club at evening; some became pirates.  The colony decreased from four hundred and ninety to sixty people, and at last it was moved and seconded that they do now adjourn. They started away from Jamestown without a tear, or hardly anything else, having experienced a very dull time there, funerals being the only relaxation whatever.  But moving down the bay they met Lord Delaware, the new Governor, with a lot of Christmas-presents and groceries. Jamestown was once more saved, though property still continued low. The company, by the terms of its new "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21448"],["title","The African Trader; Or, The Adventures of Harry Bayford (#1)"],["body","a tall good-looking man, in the dress of a merchantman's captain, step out of a boat which had apparently come from a black rakish looking brigantine lying a short distance out in the stream.  I looked at him hard, for suddenly it occurred to me that I remembered his features.  Yes, I was certain.  He had been junior mate of the \"Fair Rosomond,\" in which vessel we had come home from Jamaica, and a great chum of mine.  \"Mr Willis,\" I said, \"do you remember me?  I am Harry Bayford.\"  \"Not by looks, but by your voice and eyes I do, my boy,\" he answered, grasping my hand and shaking it heartily.  \"But what has happened?  I see you are in mourning.\"  I told him of my father's misfortunes and death; and as we walked along frankly opened out on my views and plans.  \"You will have no chance in the navy without means or friends, Harry,\" he answered.  \"There's no use thinking about the matter; but if your mind is set on going to sea I'll take you, and do my best to make a sailor of you.  I have command of the `Chieftain,' an African trader, the brigantine you see off in the stream there.  Though we do not profess to take midshipmen, I'll give you a berth in my cabin, and I don't see that in the long run you will run more risk than you would have to go through on board vessels trading to other parts of the world.\"  \"Thank you, Captain Willis, very much,\" I exclaimed, \"I little expected so soon to go to sea.\"  \"Don't talk of thanks, Harry,\" he answered, \"your poor father was very kind to me, and I am glad to serve you.  I had intended calling on him before sailing; and if your sisters will allow me, I'll pay them a visit, and answer any objections they may make to your going.\"  After dining with the captain at an inn, I hurried home with, what I considered, this good news.  My sisters, however, were very unwilling to sanction my going.  They had heard so much of the deadly climate of the African coast, and of dangers from slavers and pirates, that they dreaded the risk I should run.  Captain Willis, according to his promise, called the next day, and not without difficulty quieted their apprehensions.  Mammy, though unwilling to part with me, still could not help feeling a deep interest in my undertaking, as she thought that I was going to visit her own still-loved country; and while assisting my sisters to prepare my outfit she entertained me with an account of its beauties and wonders, while I promised to bring her back from it all sorts of things which I expected to collect.  \"And suppose, Mammy, I was to fall in with your little piccaniny, shall I bring him back to you?\"  I asked, with the thoughtlessness of a boy--certainly not intending to hurt her feelings.  She dropped her work, gazing at me with a tearful eye.  \"He fine little black boy, big as you when four year old,\" she said, and stopped as if in thought, and then added, \"Ah, Massa Harry, he no little boy now though, him great big man like him fader, you no know him, I no know him.\"  \"But what is his name, Mammy?  That would be of use,\" I said.  \"Him called Cheebo,\" she answered, heaving a deep sigh.  \"But Africa great big country--tousands and tousands of people; you no find Cheebo among dem; God only find him.  His eye everywhere.  He hears Mammy's prayers, dat great comfort.\"  \"That it is, indeed,\" said Jane, fearing that my careless remarks had needlessly grieved poor Mammy, by raising long dormant feelings in her heart.  \"And oh, my dear Harry, if you are brought into danger, and inclined to despair--and I fear you will have many dangers to go through--recollect that those who love you at home are earnestly praying for you; and at the same time never forget to pray for yourself, and to feel assured that God will hear our united prayers, and preserve you in the way He thinks best.\"  \"I will try to remember,\" I said, \"but do not fancy, Jane, that I am going to run my head into all sorts of dangers.  I daresay we shall have a very pleasant voyage out, and be back again in a few months with a full cargo of palm oil, ivory, gold-dust, and all sorts of precious things, such as I understand Captain Willis is going to trade for.\"  \"You will not forget Cheebo though, Massa Harry,\" said Mammy, in a low voice.  The idea that I might meet her son was evidently taking strong possession of her mind.  \"That I will not,\" I answered.  \"I'll ask his name of every black fellow I meet, and if I find him I'll tell him that I know his mother Mammy, and ask him to come with me to see you.\"  \"Oh, but he not know dat name,\" exclaimed Mammy.  \"Me called Ambah in Africa; him fader called Quamino.  You no forget dat.\"  \"I hope not; but I'll put them in my pocketbook,\" I said, writing down the names, though I confess that I did so without any serious thoughts about the matter, but merely for the sake of pleasing old Mammy.  When I told Captain Willis afterwards, he was highly amused with the notion, and said that I might just as well try to find a needle in a bundle of hay as to look for the old woman's son on the coast of Africa.  The day of parting from my poor sisters and our noble-hearted nurse arrived.  I did not expect to feel it so much as I did, and I could then understand how much grief it caused them.  \"Cheer up, Harry,\" said Captain Willis, as the \"Chieftain,\" under all sail, was standing down the Mersey.  \"You must not let thoughts of home get the better of you.  We shall soon be in blue water, and you must turn to and learn to be a sailor.  By the time you have made another voyage or so I expect to have you as one of my mates, and, perhaps, before you are many years older, you will become the commander of a fine craft like this.\"  I followed the captain's advice, and by the time we had crossed the line I could take my trick at the helm, and was as active aloft as many of the elder seamen on board.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE \"CHIEFTAIN\" ARRIVES OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA, AND WE CARRY ON A BRISK TRADE WITH THE NATIVES, WHO COME OFF TO US THROUGH THE SURF.--AT LENGTH CAPTAIN WILLIS PROPOSES TO RUN UP THE RIVER BONNY TO COMPLETE OUR CARGO. NOT FORGETFUL OF MY PROMISE TO MAMMY, I MAKE INQUIRIES FOR HER SON CHEEBO.  It was my morning watch.  I was indulging in the pleasure particularly enjoyable after sweltering in the close hot atmosphere of the cabin, of paddling about with bare feet on the wet deck, over which I and some of the men were heaving buckets of water, while others were lustily using holy-stones and scrubbing brushes, under the superintendence of Mr Wesbey, the first mate.  The black cook was lighting his fire in the caboose, from whence a wreath of smoke ascended almost perpendicularly in the clear atmosphere.  The sea was smooth as glass, but every now and then a slowly heaving swell lifted the vessel, and caused her sails, which hung down against the masts, to give a loud flap, while here and there the surface was broken by the fin or snout of some monster of the deep swimming round us.  Our monkey, Quako, who had been turned out of his usual resting-place, was exhibiting more than his ordinary agility-- springing about the rigging, and chattering loudly, now making his way aloft, whence he looked eastwards, and now returning to the caboose, as if to communicate his ideas to his sable friend.  \"What makes Quako so frisky this morning?\"  I asked of Dick Radforth, the boatswain, a sturdy broad shouldered man of iron frame, who, with trousers tucked up, and bare arms brawny as those of Hercules, was standing, bucket in hand, near me, deluging the deck with water.  \"He smells his native land, Harry,\" he answered, \"and thinks he is going to pay a visit to his kith and kindred.  We shall have to keep him moored pretty fast, or he will be off into the woods to find them.  I have a notion you will get a sight of it before long, when the sea breeze sets in and sends the old barky through the water.\"  \"What! the coast of Africa!\"  I exclaimed, and thoughts of that wonderful region, with its unexplored rivers, its gloomy forests, and its black skinned inhabitants, with their barbarous customs and superstitious rites, rose in my mind.  \"Aye, sure and it will be a pleasant day when we take our departure from the land, and see the last of it,\" observed Dick.  \"If those niggers would trade like other people we might make quick work of it, and be away home again in a few weeks, but we may thank our stars if we get a full cargo by this time next year, without leaving some of our number behind.\"  \"What?  I should not fancy that any of our fellows were likely to desert,\" I observed.  \"No; but they are likely to get pressed by a chap who won't let go his gripe of them again,\" answered Dick.  \"Who is that?\"  I asked.  \"Yellow-fingered Jack we call him sometimes, the coast fever,\" said Dick.  \"If they would but take better care of themselves and not drink those poisonous spirits and sleep on shore at night, they might keep out of his clutches.  I give this as a hint to you, Harry.  I have been there a score of times, and am pretty well seasoned, but I have felt his gripe, though I do not fear him now.\"  I thanked the boatswain for his advice.  It was given, I suspected, for others' benefit as well as mine.  As the bright hot red sun rose in the sky, casting his beams down on our heads, and making the pitch bubble up from the seams in the deck--as it had done not unfrequently during the voyage--a few cats' paws were seen playing over the mirror-like deep.  The sails bulged out occasionally, again to hang down as before; then once more they swelled out with the gentle breeze, and the brigantine glided through the water, gradually increasing her speed.  I was eagerly looking out for the coast; at length it came in sight--its distant outline rendered indistinct by the misty pall which hung over it.  As we drew nearer, its forest covered heights had a particularly gloomy and sombre appearance, which made me think of the cruelties I had heard were practised on those shores, of the barbarous"]]]
