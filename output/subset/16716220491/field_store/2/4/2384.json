In less than an hour the keen-eyed man re-appeared on deck, bade the mate an abrupt good-bye, nodded to the men who held the ropes for him, descended into the boat, and took his departure for the shore whence he had come.  By this time the sun was beginning to approach the horizon.  The mate of the floating light took one or two turns on the deck, at which he gazed earnestly, as if his future destiny were written there.  He then glanced at the compass and at the vessel's bow, after which he leant over the side of the red-dragon, and looked down inquiringly at the flow of the tide.  Presently his attention was fixed on the shore, behind which the sun was about to set, and, after a time, he directed a stern look towards the sky, as if he were about to pick a quarrel with that part of the universe, but thinking better of it, apparently, he unbent his brows, let his eyes fall again on the deck, and muttered to himself, \"H'm!  I expected as much.\"  What it was that he expected, Mr John Welton never told from that day to this, so it cannot be recorded here, but, after stating the fact, he crossed his arms on his broad chest, and, leaning against the stern of his vessel, gazed placidly along the deck, as if he were taking a complacent survey of the vast domain over which he ruled.  It was an interesting kingdom in detail.  Leaving out of view all that which was behind him, and which, of course, he could not see, we may remark that, just before him stood the binnacle and compass, and the cabin skylight.  On his right and left the territory of the quarter-deck was seriously circumscribed, and the promenade much interfered with, by the ship's boats, which, like their parent, were painted red, and which did not hang at the davits, but, like young lobsters of the kangaroo type, found shelter within their mother, when not at sea on their own account.  Near to them were two signal-carronades.  Beyond the skylight rose the bright brass funnel of the cabin chimney, and the winch, by means of which the lantern was hoisted.  Then came another skylight, and the companion-hatch about the centre of the deck.  Just beyond this stood the most important part of the vessel--the lantern-house.  This was a circular wooden structure, above six feet in diameter, with a door and small windows.  Inside was the lantern--the beautiful piece of costly mechanism for which the light-ship, its crew, and its appurtenances were maintained.  Right through the centre of this house rose the thick unyielding mast of the vessel.  The lantern, which was just a little less than its house, surrounded this mast and travelled upon it.  Beyond this the capital of the kingdom, the eye of the monarch was arrested by another bright brass funnel, which was the chimney of the galley-fire, and indicated the exact position of the abode of the crew, or--to continue our metaphor--the populace, who, however, required no such indicator to tell of their existence or locality, for the chorus of a \"nigger\" melody burst from them, ever and anon, through every opening in the decks, with jovial violence, as they sat, busily engaged on various pieces of work below.  The more remote parts of this landscape--or light-scape, if we may be allowed the expression--were filled up with the galley-skylight, the bitts, and the windlass, above which towered the gong, and around which twined the two enormous chain cables.  Only one of these, however, was in use--that, with a single mushroom-anchor, being sufficient to hold the ship securely against tide and tempest.  In reference to this we may remark in passing that the cable of a floating light is frequently renewed, and that the chafing of the links at the hawse-hole is distributed by the occasional paying out or hauling in of a few yards of chain--a process which is styled \"easing the nip.\"  \"Horroo! me hearty, ye're as clain as a lady's watch,\" exclaimed a man of rugged form but pleasant countenance, as he issued from the small doorway of the lantern-house with a bundle of waste in one hand and an oil-can in the other.  This was one of the lamplighters of the light-ship--Jerry MacGowl--a man whose whole soul was, so to speak, in that lantern.  It was his duty to clip and trim the wicks, and fill the lamps, and polish the reflectors and brasses, and oil the joints and wheels (for this was a revolving--in other words a flashing light), and clean the glasses and windows.  As there were nine lights to attend to, and get ready for nightly service, it may be easily understood that the lamplighter's duty was no sinecure.  The shout of Jerry recalled the king from his contemplation of things in general to the lantern in particular.  \"All ready to hoist, Jerry?\" inquired Mr Welton, going forward.  \"All ready, sir,\" exclaimed the man, looking at his handiwork with admiration, and carefully removing a speck of dust that had escaped his notice from one of the plate-glass windows; \"An't she a purty thing now?--baits the best Ginaiva watch as iver was made.  Ye might ait yer supper off her floor and shave in the reflictors.\"  \"That's a fact, Jerry, with no end of oil to your salad too,\" said Mr Welton, surveying the work of the lamplighter with a critical eye.  \"True for ye,\" replied Jerry, \"an' as much cotton waste as ye like without sinful extravagance.\"  \"The sun will be down in a few minutes,\" said the mate, turning round and once more surveying the western horizon.  Jerry admitted that, judging from past experience, there was reason to believe in the probability of that event; and then, being of a poetical temperament, he proceeded to expatiate upon the beauty of the evening, which was calm and serene.  \"D'ye know, sir,\" he said, gazing towards the shore, between which and the floating light a magnificent fleet of merchantmen lay at anchor waiting for a breeze--each vessel reflected clearly in the water along with the dazzling clouds of gold that towered above the setting sun--\"D'ye know, sir, I niver sees a sky like that but it minds me o' the blissid green hills an' purty lakes of owld Ireland, an' fills me buzzum wid a sort of inspiration till it feels fit a'most to bust.\"  \"You should have been a poet, Jerry,\" observed the mate, in a contemplative tone, as he surveyed the shipping through his telescope.  \"Just what I've often thought mesilf, sir,\" replied Jerry, wiping his forehead with the bunch of waste--\"many a time I've said to mesilf, in a thoughtful mood--    \"Wan little knows what dirty clo'es   May kiver up a poet;   What fires may burn an' flout an' skurn,   An' no wan iver know it.\"  \"That's splendid, Jerry; but what's the meanin' of `skurn?'\"  \"Sorrow wan of me knows, sir, but it conveys the idee somehow; don't it, now?\"  \"I'm not quite sure that it does,\" said the mate, walking aft and consulting his chronometer for the last time, after which he put his head down the hatchway and shouted, \"Up lights!\" in a deep sonorous voice.  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" came the ready response from below, followed by the prompt appearance of the other lamplighter and the four seamen who composed the crew of the vessel Jerry turned on his heel, murmuring, in a tone of pity, that the mate, poor man, \"had no soul for poethry.\"  Five of the crew manned the winch; the mate and Jerry went to a block-tackle which was also connected with the lifting apparatus.  Then the order to hoist was given, and immediately after, just as the sun went down, the floating light went up,--a modest yet all-important luminary of the night.  Slowly it rose, for the lantern containing it weighed full half a ton, and caused the hoisting chain and pulleys to groan complainingly.  At last it reached its destination at the head of the thick part of the mast, but about ten or fifteen feet beneath the ball.  As it neared the top, Jerry sprang up the chain-ladder to connect the lantern with the rod and pinion by means of which, with clockwork beneath, it was made to revolve and \"flash\" once every third of a minute.  Simultaneously with the ascent of the Gull light there arose out of the sea three bright stars on the nor'-eastern horizon, and another star in the south-west.  The first were the three fixed lights of the lightship that marked the North sandhead; the latter was the fixed light that guarded the South sandhead.  The Goodwin sentinels were now placed for the night, and the commerce of the world might come and go, and pass those dreaded shoals, in absolute security.  Ere long the lights of the shipping in the Downs were hung out, and one by one the lamps on shore shone forth--those which marked the entrance of Ramsgate harbour being conspicuous for colour and brilliancy--until the water, which was so calm as to reflect them all, seemed alive with perpendicular streams of liquid fire; land and sea appearing to be the subjects of one grand illumination.  A much less poetical soul than that of the enthusiastic lamp-lighter might have felt a touch of unwonted inspiration on such a night, and in such a scene.  The effect on the mind was irresistibly tranquillising.  While contemplating the multitudes of vessels that lay idle and almost motionless on the glassy water, the thought naturally arose that each black hull en-shrouded human beings who were gradually sinking into rest--relaxing after the energies of the past day--while the sable cloak of night descended, slowly and soothingly, as if God were spreading His hand gently over all to allay the fever of man's busy day-life and calm him into needful rest.  The watch of the floating light having been set, namely, two men to perambulate the deck--a strict watch being kept on board night and day-- the rest of the crew went below to resume work, amuse themselves, or turn in as they felt inclined.  While they were thus engaged, and darkness was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],["title","The Gorilla Hunters (#1)"],["body"," my boy; more of him in a few minutes.  First let us return to the point.  What was it?  Oh! a--about my being a celebrated hunter.  A very Nimrod--at least a miniature copy.  Well, Ralph, since we last met I have been all over the world, right round and round it. I'm a lieutenant in the navy now--at least I was a week ago.  I've been fighting with the Kaffirs and the Chinamen, and been punishing the rascally sepoys in India, and been hunting elephants in Ceylon and tiger-shooting in the jungles, and harpooning whales in the polar seas, and shooting lions at the Cape; oh, you've no notion where all I've been.  It's a perfect marvel I've turned up here alive.  But there's one beast I've not yet seen, and I'm resolved to see him and shoot him too--\"  \"But,\" said I, interrupting, \"what mean you by saying that you were a lieutenant in the navy a week ago?\"  \"I mean that I've given it up.  I'm tired of the sea.  I only value it as a means of getting from one country to another.  The land, the land for me!  You must know that an old uncle, a rich old uncle of mine, whom I never saw, died lately and left me his whole fortune.  Of course he died in India.  All old uncles who die suddenly and leave unexpected fortunes to unsuspecting nephews are old Indian uncles, and mine was no exception to the general rule.  So I'm independent, like you, Ralph, only I've got three or four thousand a year instead of hundreds, I believe; but I'm not sure and don't care--and I'm determined now to go on a long hunting expedition.  What think ye of all that, my boy?\"  \"In truth,\" said I, \"it would puzzle me to say what I think, I am so filled with surprise by all you tell me.  But you forget that you have not yet told me to which part of the world you mean to go, and what sort of beast it is you are so determined to see and shoot if you can.\"  \"If I can!\" echoed Peterkin, with a contemptuous curl of the lip.  \"Did not I tell you that I was a _celebrated_ hunter?  Without meaning to boast, I may tell you that there is no peradventure in my shooting.  If I only get there and see the brute within long range, I'll--ha! won't I!\"  \"Get _where_, and see _what_?\"  \"Get to Africa and see the gorilla!\" cried Peterkin, while a glow of enthusiasm lighted up his eyes.  \"You've heard of the gorilla, Ralph, of course--the great ape--the enormous puggy--the huge baboon--the man monkey, that we've been hearing so much of for some years back, and that the niggers on the African coast used to dilate about till they caused the very hair of my head to stand upon end?  I'm determined to shoot a gorilla, or prove him to be a myth.  And I mean you to come and help me, Ralph; he's quite in your way.  A bit of natural history, I suppose, although he seems by all accounts to be a very unnatural monster.  And Jack shall go too--I'm resolved on that; and we three shall roam the wild woods again, as we did in days of yore, and--\"  \"Hold, Peterkin,\" said I, interrupting.  \"How do you know that Jack will go?\"  \"How do I know?  Intuitively, of course.  I shall write to him to-night; the post does not leave till ten.  He'll get it to-morrow at breakfast, and will catch the forenoon coach, which will bring him down here by two o'clock, and then we'll begin our preparations at once, and talk the matter over at dinner.  So you see it's all cut and dry.  Give me a sheet of paper and I'll write at once.  Ah! here's a bit; now a pen. Bless me, Ralph, haven't you got a quill?  Who ever heard of a philosophical naturalist writing with steel.  Now, then, here goes:--`B'luv'd Jack,'--will that do to begin with, eh?  I'm afraid it's too affectionate; he'll think it's from a lady friend.  But it can't be altered,--`Here I am, and here's Ralph--Ralph Rover!!!!!! think of that,' (I say, Ralph, I've put six marks of admiration there); `I've found him out.  Do come to see us.  Excruciatingly important business. Ever thine--Peterkin Gay.'  Will that bring him, d'ye think?\"  \"I think it will,\" said I, laughing.  \"Then off with it, Ralph,\" cried my volatile friend, jumping up and looking hastily round for the bell-rope.  Not being able to find it, my bell-pull being an unobtrusive knob and not a rope, he rushed to the door, unlocked it, darted out, and uttered a tremendous roar, which was followed by a clatter and a scream from old Agnes, whom he had upset and tumbled over.  It was curious to note the sudden change that took place in Peterkin's face, voice, and manner, as he lifted the poor old woman, who was very thin and light, in his arms, and carrying her into the room, placed her in my easy-chair.  Real anxiety was depicted in his countenance, and he set her down with a degree of care and tenderness that quite amazed me. I was myself very much alarmed at first.  \"My poor dear old _woman_,\" said Peterkin, supporting my landlady's head; \"my stupid haste I fear you are hurt.\"  \"Hech! it's nae hurt--it's deed I am, fair deed; killed be a whaumlskamerin' young blagyird.  Oh, ma puir heed!\"  The manner and tone in which this was said convinced me that old Agnes was more frightened than injured.  In a few minutes the soothing tones and kind manner of my friend had such an effect upon her that she declared she was better, and believed after all that she was only a \"wee bit frichtened.\"  Nay, so completely was she conciliated, that she insisted on conveying the note to the post-office, despite Peterkin's assurance that he would not hear of it.  Finally she hobbled out of the room with the letter in her hand.  It is interesting to note how that, in most of the affairs of humanity, things turn out very different, often totally different, from what we had expected or imagined.  During the remainder of that evening Peterkin and I talked frequently and much of our old friend Jack Martin.  We recalled his manly yet youthful countenance, his bold, lion-like courage, his broad shoulders and winning gentle smile, and although we knew that six years must have made an immense difference in his personal appearance--for he was not much more than eighteen when we last parted-- we could not think of him except as a hearty, strapping sailor-boy.  We planned, too, how we would meet him at the coach; how we would stand aside in the crowd until he began to look about for us in surprise, and then one of us would step forward and ask if he wished to be directed to any particular part of the town, and so lead him on and talk to him as a stranger for some time before revealing who we were.  And much more to the same effect.  But when next day came our plans and our conceptions were utterly upset.  A little before two we sauntered down to the coach-office, and waited impatiently for nearly twenty minutes.  Of course the coach was late; it always is on such occasions.  \"Suppose he does not come,\" said I.  \"What a fellow you are,\" cried Peterkin, \"to make uncomfortable suppositions!  Let us rather suppose that he does come.\"  \"Oh, then, it would be all right; but if he does not come, what then?\"  \"Why, then, it would be all wrong, and we should have to return home and eat our dinner in the sulks, that's all.\"  As my companion spoke we observed the coach come sweeping round the turn of the road about half a mile distant.  In a few seconds it dashed into the town at full gallop, and finally drew up abruptly opposite the door of the inn, where were assembled the usual group of hostlers and waiters and people who expected friends by the coach.  \"He's not there,\" whispered Peterkin, in deep disappointment--\"at least he's not on the outside, and Jack would never travel inside of a coach even in bad weather, much less in fine.  That's not him on the back-seat beside the fat old woman with the blue bundle, surely!  It's very like him, but too young, much too young.  There's a great giant of a man on the box-seat with a beard like a grenadier's shako, and a stout old gentleman behind him with gold spectacles.  That's all, except two boys farther aft, and three ladies in the cabin.  Oh, _what_ a bore!\"  Although deeply disappointed at the non-arrival of Jack, I could with difficulty refrain from smiling at the rueful and woe-begone countenance of my poor companion.  It was evident that he could not bear disappointment with equanimity, and I was on the point of offering some consolatory remarks, when my attention was attracted by the little old woman with the blue bundle, who went up to the gigantic man with the black beard, and in the gentlest possible tone of voice asked if he could direct her to the white house.  \"No, madam,\" replied the big man hastily; \"I'm a stranger here.\"  The little old woman was startled by his abrupt answer.  \"Deary me, sir, no offence, I hope.\"  She then turned to Peterkin and put the same question, possibly under a vague sort of impression that if a gigantic frame betokened a gruff nature, diminutive stature must necessarily imply extreme amiability. If so, she must have been much surprised as well as disappointed, for Peterkin, rendered irascible by disappointment, turned short round and said sharply, \"Why, madam, how can _I_ tell you where the white house is, unless you say which white house you want?  Half the houses of the town are white--at least they're _dirty_ white,\" he added bitterly, as he turned away.  \"I think I can direct you, ma'am,\" said I, stepping quickly up with a bland smile, in order to counteract, if possible, my companion's rudeness.  \"Thank you, sir, kindly,\" said the little old woman; \"I'm glad to find _some_ little civility in the town.\"  \"Come with me, ma'am; I am going past the white house, and will show you the way.\"  \"And pray, sir,\" said the big stranger, stepping up to me as I was about to move away, \"can you recommend me to a good hotel?\"  I replied that I could; that there was one in the immediate vicinity of the white house, and that if he would accompany me I would show him the way.  All this I did purposely in a very affable and obliging tone and manner; for I"]]]
