His most enthusiastic eulogists are compelled merely to echo the remarks of his earliest and greatest critic, himself. Yet with all this, none of the later critics, not the most cavalier nor the dullest, has dared to call him vain. His estimate of himself, offered as simple fact, has been accepted in the same spirit, and one abyss of ineptitude still yawns for the heroic folly, or the clownish courage, of the New Criticism.     CHAPTER I JOHN MILTON   John Milton, the son of a middle-aged scrivener, was born on Friday, December the 9th, 1608, at his father's house in Bread Street, Cheapside; and died on Sunday, November the 8th, 1674, in a small house, with but one room on a floor, in Artillery Walk, Bunhill Fields, London. Of his father the records that remain show him to have been a convinced member of the Puritan party in the Church, a man of liberal culture and intelligence, a lover of music (which taste Milton inherited), a wise and generous friend to the son who became a poet. We owe it to his wisdom rather than to his prosperity that Milton was allowed to live at home without any ostensible profession until he was thirty years of age and more.  For the first sixteen years of his life Milton was educated partly at home, by a Presbyterian tutor called Thomas Young, partly at St. Paul's School, which he attended for some years as a day-scholar. From his twelfth year onward he was an omnivorous reader, and before he left school had written some boyish verses, void of merit. The next fourteen years of his life, after leaving school, were spent at Cambridge, in Buckinghamshire, and in foreign travel, so that he was thirty years old before he lived continuously in London again.  We know pretty well how he spent his time at Cambridge and at Horton, sedulously turning over the Greek and Latin classics, dreaming of immortality. We know less about his early years in London, where there were wider and better opportunities of gaining an insight into \"all seemly and generous arts and affairs.\" London was a great centre of traffic, a motley crowd of adventurers and traders even in those days, and the boy Milton must often have wandered down to the river below London Bridge to see the ships come in. His poems are singularly full of figures drawn from ships and shipping, some of them bookish in their origin, others which may have been suggested by the sight of ships. Now it is Satan, who, after his fateful journey through chaos, nears the world,    And like a weather-beaten vessel holds   Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn.  Now it is Dalila, whom the Chorus behold approaching.    Like a stately ship   Of Tarsus, bound for the isles   Of Javan or Gadire,   With all her bravery on, and tackle trim,   Sails filled, and streamers waving,   Courted by all the winds that hold them play.  Or, again, it is Samson reproaching himself,    Who, like a foolish pilot, have shipwracked   My vessel trusted to me from above,   Gloriously rigged.  The bulk of Satan is compared to the great sea-beast Leviathan, beheld off the coast of Norway by    The pilot of some small night-founder'd skiff.  In his approach to the happy garden the Adversary is likened to                        them who sail   Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past   Mozambic, off at sea north-east winds blow   Sabaean odours from the spicy shore   Of Araby the Blest, with such delay   Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league   Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles;   So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend.  And when he draws near to Eve in the rose-thicket,                    sidelong he works his way,   As when a ship, by skilful steersman wrought,   Nigh river's mouth, or foreland, where the wind   Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail.  There is nothing here that is not within the reach of any inland reader, but Milton's choice of nautical similitudes may serve to remind us how much of the interest of Old London centred round its port. Here were to be heard those tales of far-sought adventure and peril which gave even to the boisterous life of Elizabethan London an air of triviality and security. Hereby came in \"the variety of fashions and foreign stuffs,\" which Fynes Moryson, writing in Milton's childhood, compares to the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea for number. All sorts of characters, nationalities, and costumes were daily to be seen in Paul's Walk, adjoining Milton's school. One sort interests us pre-eminently. \"In the general pride of England,\" says Fynes Moryson, \"there is no fit difference made of degrees; for very Bankrupts, Players, and Cutpurses go apparelled like gentlemen.\" Shakespeare was alive during the first seven years of Milton's life, and was no doubt sometimes a visitor to the Mermaid, a stone's throw from the scrivener's house. Perhaps his cloak brushed the child Milton in the street. Milton was born in the golden age of the drama, and a score of masterpieces were put upon the London stage while he was in his cradle. But the golden age passed rapidly; the quality of the drama degenerated and the opposition to it grew strong before he was of years to attend a play. Perhaps he never saw a play by the masters during his boyhood, and his visits            to the well-trod stage anon,   If Jonson's learned sock be on,   Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,   Warble his native woodnotes wild,  were either excursions of the imagination or belong to his later occasional sojourns in London. In his _Eikonoklastes_ he quotes certain lines from _Richard III._, and here and there in his prose, as well as in his verse, there are possibly some faint reminiscences of Shakespearian phrases. So, for instance, in _The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce_, he seems to echo a famous speech of Macbeth, while he claims that his remedy of free divorce \"hath the virtue to soften and dispel rooted and knotty sorrows, and without enchantment.\" But these are doubtless the memories of reading. In the _Apology for Smectymnuus_, when he has to reply to the charge that he \"haunted playhouses\" during his college days, he retorts the charge, it is true, rather than denies it. Yet the retort bespeaks a certain severity and preciseness in judging of plays and their actors, which can hardly have found gratification in the licenses and exuberances of the contemporary drama. It was not difficult, he remarks, to see plays, \"when in the Colleges so many of the young divines, and those in next aptitude to divinity, have been seen so often upon the stage, writhing and unboning their clergy limbs to all the antic and dishonest gestures of Trinculoes, buffoons, and bawds.\" \"If it be unlawful,\" he continues, \"to sit and behold a mercenary comedian personating that which is least unseemly for a hireling to do, how much more blameful is it to endure the sight of as vile things acted by persons either entered, or presently to enter into the ministry; and how much more foul and ignominious for them to be the actors!\"  It was, at least, a happy chance that the first of Milton's verses to appear in print should have been _An Epitaph on the Admirable Dramatick Poet, W. Shakespeare_, contributed to the Second Folio in 1632. The main interests of the household at the Spread Eagle in Bread Street must have been far enough remote from the doings of the companies of players. John Milton the elder would probably have agreed with Sir Thomas Bodley, who called plays \"riffe-raffes,\" and declared that they should never come into his library. The Hampton Court Conference, the Synod of Dort, the ever-widening divisions in the Church, between Arminian and Calvinist, between Prelatist and Puritan, were probably subjects of a nearer interest, even to the poet in his youth, than the production of new or old plays upon the stage. Milton's childhood was spent in the very twilight of the Elizabethan age; it was greatly fortunate for him, and for us, that he caught the after-glow of the sunset upon his face. He read Spenser while Spenser was still the dominant influence in English poetry. \"He hath confessed to me,\" said Dryden, \"that Spenser was his original,\"--an incredible statement unless we understand \"original\" in the sense of his earliest admiration, his poetic godfather who first won him to poetry. He read Shakespeare and Jonson in the first editions. He read Sylvester's translation of _Du Bartas, His Divine Weekes and Workes_; and perhaps thence conceived the first vague idea of a poem on a kindred subject. It is necessary to insist on his English masters, because, although the greater part of his time and study was devoted to the classics, the instrument that he was to use was learned in a native school. His metre, his magnificent vocabulary, his unerring phraseology, took learning and practice. He attached a high value to his study of English poetry. When he spoke of \"our sage and serious Spenser (whom I dare be known to think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas),\" he was conscious that he was maintaining what seemed a bold paradox in an age when scholasticism still controlled education. It is pleasant to think of Milton during these early years, whether in London or at Christ's College, in his \"calm and pleasing solitariness, fed with cheerful and confident thoughts,\" before ever he had a hint that he must perforce \"embark in a troubled sea of noises and hoarse disputes, put from beholding the bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still air of delightful studies.\" From the first, we may be sure, he read the poets as one poet reads another, and apprenticed himself to them for their craft. He was never drawn out of the highroad of art by the minuter and more entangling allurements of scholarship. In one of his Divorce pamphlets he tells, with the inevitable touch of pride, how he never could delight in long citations,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21681"],["title","A Little Traitor to the South (#1)"],["body","marks the relative quality of her affections. Which one she loved the better until the moment at which the story opens she could not have told.  Nobody knew anything about Fanny Glen. At least there were only two facts concerning her in possession of the general public. These, however, were sufficient. One was that she was good. The men in the hospital called her an angel. The other was that she was beautiful. The women of the city could not exactly see why the men thought so, which was confirmation strong as proofs of Holy Writ!  She had come to Charleston at the outbreak of the war accompanied by an elderly woman of unexceptional manner and appearance who called herself Miss Lucy Glen, and described herself as Miss Fanny Glen's aunt. They had taken a house in the fashionable quarter of the city--they were not poor at any rate--and had installed themselves therein with their slaves.  They made no attempt to enter into the social life of the town and only became prominent when Charleston began to feel acutely the hardships of the war which it had done more to promote than any other place in the land.  Then Fanny Glen showed her quality. A vast hospital was established, and the young women of the city volunteered their services.  The corps of nurses was in a state of constant fluxion. Individuals came and went. Some of them married patients, some of them died with them, but Fanny Glen neither married nor died--she abided!  Not merely because she stayed while others did not, but perhaps on account of her innate capacity, as well as her tactful tenderness, she became the chief of the women attached to the hospital. Many a sick soldier lived to love her. Many another, more sorely stricken, died blessing her.  In Charleston she was regarded as next in importance to the general who commanded the troops and who, with his ships, his forts, his guns, and his men, had been for two years fighting off the tremendous assaults that were hurled upon the city from the Union ironclads and ships far out to sea. It was a point of honor to take, or to hold, Charleston, and the Confederates held it till 1865!  Fanny Glen was a privileged character, therefore, and could go anywhere and do anything, within the lines.  Under other circumstances there would have been a thorough inquiry by the careful inhabitants of the proud, strict Southern city into her family relationships; but the war was a great leveller, people were taken at their real value when trouble demonstrated it, and few questions were asked. Those that were asked about Fanny Glen were not answered. It made little difference, then.  Toward the close of 1863, however, there was an eclipse in the general hospital, for Fanny Glen fell ill.  She was not completely recovered, early in 1864, when she had the famous interview with Rhett Sempland, but there was not the slightest evidence of invalidism about her as she confronted him that afternoon in February.  Wounded pride, outraged dignity, burning indignation, supplied strength and spirit enough for a regiment of convalescents.  The difference between the two culminated in a disturbance which might aptly be called cyclonic, for Sempland on nearly the first occasion that he had been permitted to leave the hospital had repaired to Fanny Glen's house and there had repeated, standing erect and looking down upon her bended head, what he had said so often with his eyes and once at least with his lips, from his bed in the ward: that he loved her and wanted her for his wife.  Pleasant thing it was for her to hear, too, she could not but admit.  Yet if Fanny Glen had not rejected him, neither had she accepted him.  She had pleaded for time, she had hesitated, and would have been lost, had Sempland been as wise as he was brave. Perhaps he wasn't quite master of himself on account of his experience in war, and his lack of it in women, for he instantly conceived that her hesitation was due to some other cause than maidenly incertitude, and that Harry Lacy, of whom he had grown mightily jealous, was at the bottom of it.  He hated and envied Lacy. More, he despised him for his weaknesses and their consequences. The two had been great friends once, but a year or two before the outbreak of the war they had drifted apart.  Sempland did not envy Lacy any talents that he might possess, for he was quite confident that the only thing he himself lacked had been opportunity--Fate had not been kind to him, but the war was not yet over. Consequently when he jumped to the conclusion that Fanny Glen preferred Lacy, he fell into further error, and made the frightful mistake of depreciating his rival.  Assuming with masculine inconsistency that the half acceptance she had given him entitled him to decide her future, he actually referred to Lacy's well-known habits and bade her have nothing to do with him.     CHAPTER II  SHE HATES THEM BOTH   \"You are,\" he said at last, \"a lonely, unprotected young girl. Where you come from or what you have been doesn't matter to me. I know what you are. And that is why I love you. You have no father or brother to advise you. I must do it and I will, much as it pains me. If you won't take my affection, you must my counsel,\"--he called it counsel, but only an expert could have distinguished it from command--\"you do not know this man Lacy. He is a dissolute, abandoned--\"  \"Stop!\" cried the girl. \"To me he is always a gentleman--a hero.\"  \"The man is brave enough, I'll admit. And he has done some fine things.\"  \"Yes, while other men have escaped dangers by being made prisoners.\"  By that unkind remark she lost a large part of her advantage.  \"As you say,\" he returned, wincing under her cruel thrust, but persistent, \"but we are not discussing me now, but Lacy.\"  \"Speaking of wickedness, you would better discuss yourself, I think, than him.\"  \"I will not be put off in this way, Miss Fan--\"  \"Miss Glen, please,\" she interrupted, but he paid no attention.  \"Lacy is well enough as a soldier. There is much to commend in him. He has the manner of a gentleman when he wishes to exhibit it, but nevertheless he is not a fit person to be entrusted with the future of a lovely, pure, innocent young girl like you.\"  \"Shame! Shame!\" cried the girl.  \"You may cry 'shame' upon me,\" he went on calmly, \"and I realize, of course, that I am censurable in speaking thus of my rival.\"  \"You flatter yourself.\"  \"How is that?\"  \"You are no rival of Major Lacy's.\"  \"No? Well, then, as a friend.\"  \"Of his?\"  \"Of yours.\"  \"Nor are you a friend of mine.\"  \"Well, then, as an enemy, a fool, anything! I want to tell you that nothing but unhappiness awaits you if you encourage him. I know him, I tell you. I know what sort of a man he is. Unstable as water, fickle, dissipated--\"  \"I'll hear no more!\" cried the girl, passionately, turning her head and attempting to leave the room.  \"Excuse me,\" said the man, coolly, preventing her by occupying the doorway. \"You shall hear me! And hear this first of all. I am not saying anything about Major Lacy which is not a matter of public knowledge and which I have not said to him directly, and which I would not repeat in his presence.\"  \"You tell me that--\"  \"You do not believe me?\"  \"No.\"  \"I beg to assure you, Miss Glen, upon my word of honor--and it has not been questioned heretofore--that I told him these very things not longer than half an hour ago. And I informed him that I intended to tell you.\"  \"What did he say?\" she asked, her curiosity getting the better of her for the moment.  \"He laughed. Said that the South had a present and pressing need for such as I,\" he replied with sturdy honesty, \"but that he would take great pleasure in killing me when the war was over if we were both spared.\"  \"Well, sir, was not that a fine reply?\"  \"It was. It was a gentleman's answer. I admired him for it and told him so. At the same time I told him that he must cease his attentions to you.\"  \"By what right did you dare--\" cried the girl, almost choking with sudden and indignant protest.  \"No right. Unless my love for you, with a desire to serve you, greater than everything save my devotion to that flag yonder, can excuse me.\"  \"And that cannot. Unless love be returned, it entails no rights whatsoever.\"  \"And you do not love me?\"  \"Love you!\" cried the girl, scornfully.  \"I know you don't, but won't you?\" he pleaded.  \"I won't!\"  \"Won't you try?\"  \"No!\"  \"You do not dislike me?\"  \"I hate you!\"  \"Do you love Lacy?\"  \"I will not allow you to question me!\"  \"You must answer me!\" said the man, taking her almost savagely by the arm, and in spite of herself she thrilled at his touch.  \"You hurt me,\" said the girl.  \"Nonsense! You hurt me more than I do you. Do you love this man?\"  \"Why not? He has his failings, his weaknesses, but he fights against them, he tries to overcome them. The whole South knows him, loves him for his deeds, pities him for his failings. And I--\"  \"Yes? You what?\"  \"You shall see. Meanwhile before you depreciate a brother soldier, why don't you do something yourself? You are not in the same class.\"  \"I wouldn't say that, Miss Glen, if I were you,\" exclaimed Major Lacy, quietly entering the room through one of the long windows opening on the veranda. \"Ah, Sempland, have you told your little tale?\"  [Illustration: \"'Ah, Sempland, have you told your little tale?'\"]  \"Yes.\"  \"Exposed me to this young lady?\"  \"I have.\"  \"And condemned me as an utter scoundrel, a blackguard?\"  \"Not quite. I told the truth,\" returned Sempland, calmly, \"just as I said to you I would, and for that I am ready to answer in any way to please you. We can settle the matter when the war is over.\"  \"Very well. What did you say, Miss Glen?\" continued Lacy, turning to that young woman.  \"I told him it wasn't true!\" burst out the girl, impetuously.  \"Ah, but it is,\" said Lacy, softly. \"I am all that he says, and more, too.\"  \"But look at what you have done.\"  \"But little, after all. I heard you reproaching Sempland for what he had not done"]]]
