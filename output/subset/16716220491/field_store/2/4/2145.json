My hyperspatial astrogator, Guatt Kirbey, composes music; he tries to express the mathematics of hyperspatial theory in musical terms. I don't care much for it, myself,\" he admitted. \"I study history. You know, it's odd; practically everything that's happened on any of the inhabited planets happened on Terra before the first spaceship.\"  The garden immediately around them was quiet, now; everybody was over by the landing-stage escalators. Harkaman would have said more, but at that moment he saw half a dozen of Sesar Karvall's uniformed guardsmen run past. They were helmeted and in bullet-proofs; one of them had an auto-rifle, and the rest carried knobbed plastic truncheons. The Space Viking set down his drink.  \"Let's go,\" he said. \"Our host is calling up his troops; I think the guests ought to find battle-stations, too.\"     III   The gaily-dressed crowd formed a semicircle facing the landing-stage escalators; everybody was staring in embarrassed curiosity, those behind craning over the shoulders of those in front. The ladies had drawn up their shawls in frigid formality; many had even covered their heads. There were four news-service cars hovering above; whatever was going on was getting a planetwide screen showing. The Karvall guardsmen were trying to get through; their sergeant was saying, over and over, \"Please, ladies and gentlemen; your pardon, noble sir,\" and getting nowhere.  Otto Harkaman swore disgustedly and shoved the sergeant aside. \"Make way, here!\" he bellowed. \"Let these guards pass.\" With that, he almost hurled a gaily-dressed gentleman aside on either hand; they both turned to glare angrily, then got hastily out of his way. Meditating briefly on the uses of bad manners in an emergency, Trask followed, with the others; the big Space Viking plowed to the front, where Sesar Karvall and Rovard Grauffis and several others were standing.  Facing them, four men in black cloaks stood with their backs to the escalators. Two were commonfolk retainers; hired gunmen, to be precise. They were at pains to keep their hands plainly in sight, and seemed to be wishing themselves elsewhere. The man in front wore a diamond sunburst jewel on his beret, and his cloak was lined with pale blue silk. His thin, pointed face was deeply lined about the mouth and penciled with a thin black mustache. His eyes showed white all around the irises, and now and then his mouth would twitch in an involuntary grimace. Andray Dunnan; Trask wondered briefly how soon he would have to look at him from twenty-five meters over the sights of a pistol. The face of the slightly taller man who stood at his shoulder was paper-white, expressionless, with a black beard. His name was Nevil Ormm, nobody was quite sure whence he had come, and he was Dunnan's henchman and constant companion.  \"You lie!\" Dunnan was shouting. \"You lie damnably, in your stinking teeth, all of you! You've intercepted every message she's tried to send me.\"  \"My daughter has sent you no messages, Lord Dunnan,\" Sesar Karvall said, with forced patience. \"None but the one I just gave you, that she wants nothing whatever to do with you.\"  \"You think I believe that? You're holding her a prisoner; Satan only knows how you've been torturing her to force her into this abominable marriage--\"  There was a stir among the bystanders; that was more than well-mannered restraint could stand. Out of the murmur of incredulous voices, one woman's was quite audible:  \"Well, really! He actually _is_ crazy!\"  Dunnan, like everybody else, heard it. \"Crazy, am I?\" he blazed. \"Because I can see through this hypocritical sham? Here's Lucas Trask, he wants an interest in Karvall mills, and here's Sesar Karvall, he wants access to iron deposits on Traskon land. And my loving uncle, he wants the help of both of them in stealing Omfray of Glaspyth's duchy. And here's this loan-shark of a Ffayle, trying to claw my lands away from me, and Rovard Grauffis, the fetchdog of my uncle who won't lift a finger to save his kinsman from ruin, and this foreigner Harkaman who's swindled me out of command of the _Enterprise_. You're all plotting against me--\"  \"Sir Nevil,\" Grauffis said, \"you can see that Lord Dunnan's not himself. If you're a good friend to him, you'll get him out of here before Duke Angus arrives.\"  Ormm leaned forward and spoke urgently in Dunnan's ear. Dunnan pushed him angrily away.  \"Great Satan, are you against me, too?\" he demanded.  Ormm caught his arm. \"You fool, do you want to ruin everything, now--\" He lowered his voice; the rest was inaudible.  \"No, curse you, I won't go till I've spoken to her, face to face--\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was another stir among the spectators; the crowd was parting, and Elaine was coming through, followed by her mother and Lady Sandrasan and five or six other matrons. They all had their shawls over their heads, right ends over left shoulders; they all stopped except Elaine, who took a few steps forward and confronted Andray Dunnan. He had never seen her look more beautiful, but it was the icy beauty of a honed dagger.  \"Lord Dunnan, what do you wish to say to me?\" she asked. \"Say it quickly and then go; you are not welcome here.\"  \"Elaine!\" Dunnan cried, taking a step forward. \"Why do you cover your head; why do you speak to me as a stranger? I am Andray, who loves you. Why are you letting them force you into this wicked marriage?\"  \"No one is forcing me; I am marrying Lord Trask willingly and happily, because I love him. Now, please, go and make no more trouble at my wedding.\"  \"That's a lie! They're making you say that! You don't have to marry him; they can't make you. Come with me now. They won't dare stop you. I'll take you away from all these cruel, greedy people. You love me, you've always loved me. You've told me you loved me, again and again--\"  Yes, in his own private dream-world, a world of fantasy that had now become Andray Dunnan's reality, in which an Elaine Karvall whom his imagination had created existed only to love him. Confronted by the real Elaine, he simply rejected the reality.  \"I never loved you, Lord Dunnan, and I never told you so. I never hated you, either, but you are making it very hard for me not to. Now go, and never let me see you again.\"  With that, she turned and started back through the crowd, which parted in front of her. Her mother and her aunt and the other ladies followed.  \"You lied to me!\" Dunnan shrieked after her. \"You lied all the time. You're as bad as the rest of them, all scheming and plotting against me, betraying me. I know what it's about; you all want to cheat me of my rights, and keep my usurping uncle on the ducal throne. And you, you false-hearted harlot, you're the worst of them all!\"  Sir Nevil Ormm caught his shoulder and spun him around, propelling him toward the escalators. Dunnan struggled, screaming inarticulately like a wounded wolf. Ormm was cursing furiously.  \"You two!\" he shouted. \"Help me, here. Get hold of him.\"  Dunnan was still howling as they forced him onto the escalator, the backs of the two retainers' cloaks, badged with the Dunnan crescent, light blue on black, hiding him. After a little, an aircar with the blue crescent blazonry lifted and sped away.  \"Lucas, he's crazy,\" Sesar Karvall was insisting. \"Elaine hasn't spoken fifty words to him since he came back from his last voyage--\"  He laughed and put a hand on Karvall's shoulder. \"I know that, Sesar. You don't think, do you, that I need assurance of it?\"  \"Crazy, I'll say he's crazy,\" Rovard Grauffis put in. \"Did you hear what he said about his rights? Wait till his Grace hears about that.\"  \"Does he lay claim to the ducal throne, Sir Rovard?\" Otto Harkaman asked, sharply and seriously.  \"Oh, he claims that his mother was born a year and a half before Duke Angus and the true date of her birth falsified to give Angus the succession. Why, his present Grace was three years old when she was born. I was old Duke Fergus' esquire; I carried Angus on my shoulder when Andray Dunnan's mother was presented to the lords and barons the day after she was born.\"  \"Of course he's crazy,\" Alex Gorram agreed. \"I don't know why the Duke doesn't have him put under psychiatric treatment.\"  \"I'd put him under treatment,\" Harkaman said, drawing a finger across under his beard. \"Crazy men who pretend to thrones are bombs that ought to be deactivated, before they blow things up.\"  \"We couldn't do that,\" Grauffis said. \"After all, he's Duke Angus' nephew--\"  \"I could do it,\" Harkaman said. \"He only has three hundred men in this company of his. Why you people ever let him recruit them Satan only knows,\" he parenthesized. \"I have eight hundred; five hundred ground-fighters. I'd like to see how they shape up in combat, before we space out. I can have them ready for action in two hours, and it'd be all over before midnight.\"  \"No, Captain Harkaman; his Grace would never permit it,\" Grauffis vetoed. \"You have no idea of the political harm that would do among the independent lords on whom we're counting for support. You weren't here on Gram when Duke Ridgerd of Didreksburg had his sister Sancia's second husband poisoned--\"     IV   They halted under the colonnade; beyond, the lower main terrace was crowded, and a medley of old love songs was wafting from the sound outlets, for the sixth or eighth time around. He looked at his watch; it was ninety seconds later than the last time he had done so. Give it fifteen more minutes to get started, and another fifteen to get away after the marriage toasts and the felicitations. And no marriage, however pompous, lasted more than half an hour. An hour, then, till he and Elaine would be in the aircar, bulleting toward Traskon.  The love songs stopped abruptly; after a momentary silence, a trumpet, considerably amplified, blared; the \"Ducal Salute.\" The crowd stopped"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20729"],["title","At the Point of the Bayonet: A Tale of the Mahratta War (#1)"],["body","ad, controlled by two civilians; and moving at a rate which, in itself, testifies to divided councils and utter incompetency on the part of its commander. It is almost impossible even to hope for success, under such conditions.\"  \"The lookout is certainly bad,\" the younger officer agreed. \"However, before now the fighting powers of the British soldier have made up for the blunders of his commanders; and we may hope that this will be the case, now.\"  \"If a disaster happen,\" the major said, \"we shall have the Mahrattas down at the gates of Bombay; and as soon as I hear a rumour of it--and news travels wonderfully fast among the natives--I shall return to the city.\"  \"Oh, I don't think you need fear anything of that sort, Major! Besides, this is not on the direct line between the Ghauts and the city. And even if they find they cannot push on, I should say our force would be able to secure their retreat. The Mahratta horse will never be able to break our squares; but of course, in that case we should have to abandon all our baggage and baggage animals.\"  \"I agree with you that the Mahrattas would doubtless hang on the skirts of our force, and follow them down the Bhore Ghaut, and so would not come anywhere near us; but they might detach flying parties to burn and plunder, as is their custom. Brave as they are, the Mahrattas do not fight for the love of fighting, but simply from the hope of plunder and of enlarging their territories.  \"Well, we may hope, in a day or two, to hear that a battle has been fought, and that a victory has been won. Not that one victory would settle the matter, for the Mahratta force consists almost entirely of cavalry and, as we have only a handful, they would, if beaten, simply ride off and be ready to fight again, another day. If we had pushed on and occupied Poona, directly we landed--which should have been easy enough, if the baggage train had been left behind, for it is but forty miles from Panwell to the Mahratta capital--the position would have been altogether different. The Mahrattas would not have had time to collect their forces, and we should probably have met with no opposition and, once in Poona, could have held it against the whole Mahratta force. Besides, it is certain that some of the chiefs, seeing that Rugoba was likely to be made Peishwa, would have come to the conclusion that it would be best for them to side with him.  \"Of course, the baggage should all have been left at Panwell and, in that case, the force could have entered Poona three days after landing, instead of delaying from the 25th of November until today, the 7th of January; and even now, at their present rate of advance, they may be another fortnight before they arrive at Poona. I don't think there has been so disgraceful a business since we first put foot in India.  \"At any rate, I shall send Mary and the child down to Bombay, tomorrow. It is all very well to have her with me, when everything is peaceable; but although I do not think there is any actual risk, it is as well that, in turbulent times like these, with nothing but a force under such incompetent leading between us and a powerful and active enemy, she should be safe at Bombay.\"  Just before daybreak, next morning, there was a sudden shout from one of the sentries; who had for the first time been posted round the camp. The warning was followed by a fierce rush, and a large body of horse and foot charged into the camp. The escort were, for the most part, killed as they issued from their tents. The major and his friend were shot down as they sallied out, sword in hand. The same fate befell Mrs. Lindsay.  Then the Mahrattas proceeded to loot the camp. The ayah had thrust the child underneath the wall of the tent, at the first alarm. A Mahratta seized her, and would have cut her down, had she not recognized him by the light of the lamp which hung from the tent ridge.  \"Why, cousin Sufder,\" she exclaimed, \"do you not know me?\"  He loosed his hold, and stood back and gazed at her.  \"Why, Soyera,\" he exclaimed, \"is it you? It is more than ten years since I saw you!  \"It is my cousin,\" he said to some of his companions who were standing round, \"my mother's sister's child.\"  \"Don't be alarmed,\" he went on, to the woman, \"no one will harm you. I am one of the captains of this party.\"  \"I must speak to you alone, Sufder.\"  She went outside the tent with him.  \"You have nothing to fear,\" he said. \"You shall go back with us to Jooneer. I have a house there, and you can stay with my wife. Besides, there are many of your people still alive.\"  \"But that is not all, Sufder. I was ayah to the major and his wife--whom your people have just killed, and whom I loved dearly--and in my charge is their child. He is but a few months old, and I must take him with me.\"  \"It is impossible,\" Sufder replied. \"No white man, woman, or child would be safe in the Deccan, at present.\"  \"No one would see his face,\" the woman said. \"I would wrap him up, and will give out that he is my own child. As soon as we get up the Ghauts I would stain his face and skin, and no one would know that he was white. If you will not let me do it, tell your men to cut me down. I should not care to live, if the child were gone as well as his father and mother. You cannot tell how kind they were to me. You would not have me ungrateful, would you, Sufder?\"  \"Well, well,\" the man said good naturedly, though somewhat impatiently, \"do as you like; but if any harm comes of it, mind it is not my fault.\"  Thankful for the permission, Soyera hurried round to the back of the tent, picked up the child and wrapped it in her robe; and then when, after firing the place, the Mahrattas retired, she fell in behind them, and followed them in the toilsome climb up the mountains, keeping so far behind that none questioned her. Once or twice Sufder dropped back to speak to her.  \"It is a foolish trick of yours,\" he said, \"and I fear that trouble will come of it.\"  \"I don't see why it should,\" she replied. \"The child will come to speak Mahratta and, when he is stained, none will guess that he is English. In time, I may be able to restore him to his own people.\"  The other shook his head.  \"That is not likely,\" he said, \"for before many weeks, we shall have driven them into the sea.\"  \"Then he must remain a Mahratta,\" she said, \"until he is able to make his way to join the English in Madras or Calcutta.\"  \"You are an obstinate woman, and always have been so; else you would not have left your people to go to be servant among the whites. However, I will do what I can for you, for the sake of my mother's sister and of our kinship.\"  On the way up the hills Soyera stopped, several times, to pick berries. When they halted she went aside and pounded them, and then boiled them in some water in a lota--a copper vessel--Sufder lent her for the purpose, and dyed the child's head and body with it, producing a colour corresponding to her own.  The party, which was composed of men from several towns and villages, broke up the next morning.  \"Have you money?\" Sufder asked her, as she was about to start alone on her journey.  \"Yes; my savings were all lodged for me, by Major Lindsay, with some merchants at Bombay; but I have twenty rupees sewn up in my garments.\"  \"As to your savings, Soyera, you are not likely to see them again, for we shall make a clean sweep of Bombay. However, twenty rupees will be useful to you, and would keep you for three or four months, if you needed but, as you are going to my wife, you will not want them.  \"Take this dagger. When you show it to her, she will know that you come from me; but mind, she is, like most women, given to gossip; therefore I warn you not to let her into the secret of this child's birth, for if you did so, half the town would know it in the course of a day or two.  \"Now, I must go back with my men to join a party who are on their way to fight the English. I should have gone there direct, but met the others starting on this marauding expedition, which was so much to the taste of my men that I could not restrain them from joining. I shall see you at Jooneer, as soon as matters are finished with the English; then I shall, after staying a few days there, rejoin Scindia, in whose service I am.\"  Soyera started on her way. At the villages through which she passed, she was questioned as to where she came from; and replied that she had been living down near Bombay but, now that the English were going to fight the Mahrattas, she was coming home, having lost her husband a few months before.  As the road to Jooneer diverged widely from that to Poona, she was asked no questions about the war. All were confident that the defeat of the English was certain, now that Scindia and Holkar and the government of the Peishwa had laid aside their mutual jealousies, and had joined for the purpose of crushing the whites.  On arriving, after two days' journey, at Jooneer, she went to the address that Sufder had given her; but was coldly received by his wife.  \"As it is Sufder's order, of course I must take you in,\" she said, \"but when he returns, I shall tell him that I do not want another woman and child in the house. Why do you not go to your own people? As you are Sufder's cousin, you must be the sister of Ramdass. Why should you not go to him?\"  \"I will gladly do so, if you will tell me where he lives.\"  \"He has a small farm. You must have passed it, as you came along. It is about a mile from here.\"  \"I will go to him at once,\" Soyera said.  \"No, no,\" the woman exclaimed; \"that will never do. You must stop a day or two here. Sufder would be angry, indeed, were he to find that you did not remain here; and would blame me for it. I should be willing enough for you to stay a week, or a month; that is a different thing from becoming an inmate of the house.\"  \"I will wait till tomorrow, for I have made a long two days' journey from the top of the Ghauts and, as I am not accustomed to walking, my feet are sore.
