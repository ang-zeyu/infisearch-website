We carried fine grasses and soft feathers.  We found mosses and rabbits' fur to make it soft.  \"Those were indeed happy days for us.  They were also exciting days. We were very careful to let no one know what we were about.  \"Once, as I flew home with a bit of moss, I saw a boy lying on the grass not far from our fence-post.  It would never do to let him know our secret.  Boys are not to be trusted.  \"I perched upon the fence and pretended that I had never a thought of nest building.  \"In a moment Mrs. Chickadee came flying home with a soft, downy feather.  When I called out warningly she at once flew to me.  \"Then the boy called softly to his little sister.  \"'Come quick,' he said, 'if you want to watch these birds build their nest.'  \"A little dark-eyed girl crept up beside the boy.  We scarcely knew what to do.  Soon a bright idea occurred to me.  I began to sing my very best.  I also performed my most wonderful tricks.  I whirled round and round.  I darted between the rails.  I spun about.  \"The children became so interested in my performance that they forgot to watch Mrs. Chickadee.  When they were not looking her way, she flew to the nest and arranged the feather.  \"When she returned she took my place on the fence.  Now my wife and I look very much alike, and though she cannot perform quite as nimbly as I, the children did not know when we changed places.  \"While the children watched her I flew to the nest with my bit of moss.  \"'What a pity!' said the little girl, as we flew away laughing to ourselves.  'They stopped to play and they lost the bits of moss and feathers with which they meant to make their nest!'  \"'Chick-a-dee!  Chick-a-dee!  Chick-a-dee!' called back my wife happily.\"  All this time Phyllis's eyes were growing rounder and bigger.  \"Why,\" said she, \"I never knew there was but one bird performing on the fence.  I thought the other flew away!\"  \"That was because Mrs. Chickadee and I look so much alike,\" replied Mr. Chickadee.  \"But we did find your nest a few days later,\" said Phyllis.  \"In it were six small white eggs covered with tiny red specks.  We went to look at the nest every day until the eggs hatched.  Then we went several times a day until the baby birds learned to fly and left the nest empty.  \"But you did not disturb us,\" said the chickadee, \"though we were dreadfully frightened at first.\"  At that moment a great soft snowball went plump! against Phyllis's red cap.  \"Jack!\" she cried, scrambling off the fence and running after the boy with the scratch on his nose.  \"Jack, take me for a ride on your sled!\"  Then she looked back.  The chickadee now sat in the tree-top.  \"Tell Mrs. Chickadee,\" called Phyllis, \"that I shall spread some more crumbs and seeds on the white table-cloth this afternoon.  We'll hang another bone in the cedar-tree, too!\"  \"Chick-a-dee-dee-dee!\" cried the little bird in a flutter of delight.     TWENTY LITTLE CHICKADEES    Twenty little chickadees,     Sitting in a row;   Twenty pairs of naked feet     Buried in the snow.   I should think you'd fly away     Where the weather's warm,   Then you wouldn't have to be     Out there in the storm.    Sorry little chickadees,     Don't you know the way?   Can't you find the road to go     Where 'tis always May?   Robins all have found it out,     Wrens and bluebirds too,   Don't you wish you'd thought to ask     Ere away they flew?     THE SNOWBIRD'S SONG[1]    The ground was all covered with snow, one day,   And two little sisters were busy at play--   A snowbird was sitting close by on a tree,   And merrily singing his chick-a-de-dee!    He had not been singing that tune very long,   When Emily heard him, so loud was his song.   \"Oh, sister, look out of the window!\" said she,   \"Here's a dear little bird, singing chick-a-de-dee!    \"Poor fellow! he walks in the snow and the sleet   And has neither stockings nor shoes on his feet,   I wonder what makes him so full of his glee,   And why he keeps singing, his chick-a-de-dee.    \"If I were a barefooted snowbird, I know,   I would not stay out in the cold and the snow.   I pity him so!  Oh, how cold he must be,   And yet he keeps singing his chick-a-de-dee.    \"Oh, mother, do get him some stockings and shoes,   And a nice little frock, and a hat, let him choose.   I wish he'd come into the parlour, and see   How warm we would make him, poor chick-a-de-dee!\"    The bird had flown down for some sweet crumbs of bread,   And heard every word little Emily said.   \"How funny I'd look in that costume!\" thought he,   And he laughed, as he warbled his chick-a-de-dee.    \"I am grateful,\" said he, \"for the wish you express,   But I have no occasion for such a fine dress.   I'd rather remain with my little limbs free,   Than to hobble about singing chick-a-de-dee.    \"There is One, my dear child, though I cannot tell who,   Has clothed me already, and warm enough, too.   Good morning!  Oh, who are so happy as we?\"   And away he flew, singing his chick-a-de-dee.    [1] From \"The Second Reader--of the Rational Method In Reading.\"     HOW THE BIRDS GOT THEIR FEATHERS  (IROQUOIS MYTH)  That evening, as the family sat beside the hearth, Phyllis thought of the brave little chickadees out in the fir-trees.  \"I wonder if they are really warm enough,\" she said.  \"Do feathers make a warm dress, mother?  Why do birds have feathers instead of fur?\"  \"I have heard the story that the Indians tell of how the birds got their feathers,\" said mother.  \"Bring your chairs closer and I will tell the story to you.\"  So the children drew their chairs up into the firelight, and listened to this little Indian story:  \"Once some little Indian children,\" began the mother, \"gathered about the fire inside their deerskin wigwam and begged their mother for a story.  \"Each little Indian was wrapped in a bright coloured blanket.  Each little Indian wore long turkey buzzard feathers in his hair.  \"The Indian mother looked at her baby braves proudly.  She thought of the time when each of the children was a tiny papoose and swung in a deerskin cradle like a bird in its nest.  \"'There was a time,' said the Indian squaw, 'when the birds had no feathers.  \"'Being naked, they remained hidden among the leaves.  Being ashamed they were silent, and no bird-note sweetened the stillness of the forest.  \"'At last with faint chirpings the mother birds prayed the Great Spirit for blankets in which to wrap their little ones.  \"'Then the Great Spirit, seeing their sorry plight, sent a messenger to the birds, who told them that even now coverings were ready for every bird.  \"'The messenger said that hereafter each family of birds should dress in uniform, so that the forest people, seeing a bird, might know at once, by its dress, to what bird family it belonged.  \"'But alas! the messenger also said that the uniforms were a great way off.  He himself could not bring them to the forest.  The birds must choose one who was strong of wing and able to endure great hardships, to go back with him and bring the uniforms home.  \"'The poor featherless birds looked about for one who was brave and fearless and untiring.  A council was held to induce some bird to go on this long journey.  \"'But one and all pleaded some excuse.  Some must remain to care for the babes still in the nest.  Some were too old to undertake the journey.  Some were too young to find the way.  \"'Some had been ill and were still too weak to travel.  Indeed, the birds seemed to be in as sad a plight as before.  \"'At last there stepped forth a bird, who, truth to tell, was not a general favourite among his fellows.  His name was turkey buzzard.  \"'The bird agreed to undertake the long journey and bring back the feathery uniforms, if he could choose the most beautiful coat of feathers for himself and his family for ever.  \"'To this the other birds consented, and the featherless turkey buzzard flew away.  \"'It was indeed a long and a dangerous journey.  Sometimes the poor bird nearly dropped from weariness and hunger.  Sometimes, so hungry was he, that he was forced to make a meal off from some dead animal which lay in the way.  Indeed so often did he do this that in time he came to like this food.  \"'It came to pass, after many days, that the turkey buzzard, being directed by the Great Spirit, found the feathery uniforms.  \"'He at once began to look them over.  He intended to choose the most beautiful coat of feathers for himself and his family.  \"'Soon he found a suit of most gorgeous colours.  He tried it on, and looked at his own reflection in the water.  The dress was very beautiful.  Well pleased with himself and his dress the turkey buzzard gathered up the remaining uniforms and started for home.  \"'But alas! the new dress, although so beautiful, did not fit comfortably.  The poor bird found that he could not fly well in his new dress.  He tried another and still another bright coloured dress, but in none of them was he comfortable.  \"'At length, quite discouraged, he slipped into a quiet, dark uniform. Although this suit was the least beautiful it fitted comfortably and gracefully.  In it the turkey buzzard flew away home, and in such uniform have his family ever since been content to dress.  \"'The turkey buzzards are quite willing to leave the more gorgeous dresses for those birds who cannot fly so far nor so gracefully as they.'\"     CHILLY LITTLE CHICKADEES[1]    Chilly little chickadees,   Sitting in a row,   Chilly little chickadees,   Buried in the snow,   Don't you find it very cold   For your little feet?

Does not go south in winter.  Song--two or three clear long whistles and the chirping of his own name, \"chickadee.\"  A gay, curious little bird.  Black head and throat--sides of head and neck white--breast grayish buff--wings and tail darker shade edged with white--larger feathers of shoulders white.  Food--seeds and dormant insects or larval eggs.--Valuable as an insect destroyer.  Builds in hollow places--usually deserted woodpeckers' or squirrels' nests--sometimes hollows place for itself.  Six white eggs speckled with red--young birds, male and female much alike in colouring.     ROBIN REDBREAST  MERRY ROBIN REDBREAST    \"Robin, robin redbreast,     Singing on the bough,   Come and get your breakfast,     We will feed you now.   Robin likes the golden grain,   Nods his head and sings again:     'Chirping, chirping cheerily,   Here I come so merrily,     Thank you, children dear!'\"  Thus sang Phyllis one morning during the second week in March.  In the topmost bough of the old apple-tree sat Robin Redbreast, looking altogether doubtful as to whether he liked the little girl's song.  But when he saw the grains of wheat which the child was scattering on the ground for his breakfast, he thought better of his doubt.  He hopped lower on the branches.  He turned his little head on one side and looked at Phyllis in a very friendly fashion.  \"Come on down!\" Phyllis begged.  \"I am so glad that you have returned. I am so glad that you came to this very apple-tree and sang so strong and loud and clear!\"  \"Chirp!  Chirp!\" and the robin hopped again nearer.  \"You see,\" Phyllis went on, in her coaxing little voice, \"my brother Jack, being a boy, said he would be the one to see the first robin this year.  \"But I made up my mind that if watchful eyes and careful ears could help a little girl, I would get ahead of Jack.  \"Sure enough, the first thing I heard this morning was your sweet song. When did you arrive?  Aren't you rather early?\"  By this time the robin was on the ground, pecking away at the grain. As he ate his breakfast he told his story.  [Illustration: \"By this time the robin was on the ground\" (missing from book)]  \"I have been south all winter long,\" he said.  \"It is very lovely in the southland.  Food is plenty, the days are long, and the sunshine is golden, bright, and warm.  \"But as soon as the spring days came I grew restless.  I knew the snow was beginning to melt and the grass to grow green in my old home country.  I wanted to start north at once.  \"I spoke to my little mate about it, and found her to be as homesick as I.  So we flew north a little earlier than usual this year, and arrived ahead of the others.  We are now quite anxious to get to housekeeping, and are already looking for a suitable place for a nest.\"  \"If you will build near us,\" said Phyllis, \"I will help you care for your little ones.  I will give you all the crumbs that you can eat.\"  \"Oh! oh!\" chirped the robin; \"you are very kind, Phyllis, but I hardly think you would know how to feed bird babies.  \"You see our babies are so fond of bugs and worms and all sorts of insects, that they do not care for crumbs when they can have nice fat worms.  \"We sometimes feed berries and cherries to our babies.  We older birds often eat fruit, but really we like worms and bugs better.\"  \"The robins ate all the cherries from the top of our cherry-tree last year,\" said Phyllis.  \"Yes, we did eat some of your cherries,\" admitted the robin.  \"They were very sweet and juicy.  \"There are people who say that we robins are a nuisance, and that we destroy so much fruit that they wish we would never come near them. The fact is, we do more good than harm to your orchards and berry patches.  Just think how many insects we destroy!  If it were not for us I think much more fruit would be destroyed by insects.  And worms and caterpillars would be crawling everywhere.  \"A robin is a very greedy fellow.  He eats nearly all the time.  I could not begin to tell you how many insects I have eaten during my life.  \"There are cutworms, too, which live underground.  During the night they come out for food.  We robins are early risers, and often catch the slow worms before they can get back to their underground homes.\"  \"Ah,\" laughed Phyllis, \"that must be the reason that we say that the early bird catches the worm.\"  \"When our babies come,\" said the robin, \"we are very busy, indeed. Those young mouths seem always to be open, begging for more food.  \"My mother says that when I was a baby robin she was kept busy all day long.  \"There were four baby birds in the nest.  I myself ate about seventy worms in a day.  My brother and sisters had as good appetites as I.\"  \"Will you build here in the apple-tree?\" asked Phyllis.  \"I should so like to watch you.  Besides, there is a garden just beneath with millions of bugs and insects there.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" replied the robin.  \"We shall surely build there.  You will find that robins like to build near your home.  We have a very friendly feeling towards people.  That is the reason that we hop about your lawn so much and that we waken you by singing near your window in the early morning.\"  \"I have heard that robins are not very good nest-builders,\" said Phyllis.  \"I was told that a great number of robins' nests were blown down by every hard storm.\"  \"More are destroyed than I like to think about,\" said the robin.  \"But my father and mother raised three families of birds in their nest last season.  \"Early in the spring they were very busy about their nest-building. First they brought sticks, straw, weeds, and roots.  With these they laid the foundation in what seemed a very careless fashion, among the boughs.  \"Then here on this foundation they wove the round nest of straws and weeds.  They plastered it with mud.  They lined it with soft grasses and moss.  \"In this nest my mother laid four beautiful greenish-blue eggs.  From the first egg that cracked open I crept out.  From the three other eggs came my brother and sisters.  \"We were not handsome babies.  I don't believe bird babies ever are beautiful at first.  We had no feathers, and our mouths were so big and yellow.  \"We were always hungry, for we were growing very fast.  Our mouths flew open at every little noise.  We thought every sound was the flutter of our parents' wings.  They always brought such fine food for us.\"  The robin pecked away at his breakfast for some time before he spoke again.  Then he again took up the story of his life.  \"How well I remember being taught to fly,\" he said.  \"How our mother coaxed us to try our wings.  How timid and feeble we were One of my sisters fell to the ground and a great gray cat caught her.  \"Our wings were very weak then and our feathers were still short.  I then had no beautiful red breast.  It was just a rusty looking white spotted with black.  \"My mother's breast was not so red as my father's.  She was of a paler colour and she sang much less than he.  She was a very happy little mother, however, and she chirped very sweetly to her babies.  \"After we flew from the nest, and were able to look out for ourselves, my mother laid four more greenish-blue eggs in the same nest.  By and bye four more young robins were chirping about in the garden.  \"Quite late in the season my parents were again nesting.  But it was rather unfortunate that they did so.  A great storm came up and a branch broke from the tree and destroyed the four blue eggs.  \"It was shortly after this mishap that the robins flew south for the winter.  \"My brother, who was always a brave, cheery fellow, thought he would rather stay here.  I wonder how he fared.  I have not yet seen him.\"  \"I have not seen him lately, but he was here during the winter,\" said Phyllis.  \"I dare say you will find him soon.\"  \"Well,\" said the robin, picking up the last grain of wheat, \"I thank you, Phyllis, for this fine breakfast.  \"I will only say 'good morning.'  I think you will see me again. Perhaps I will show you where we build our nest.\"  \"I am grateful to you,\" replied Phyllis.  \"You see the cherry-tree grows beside Jack's window.  You might have sung your morning song there.\"     THE ROBIN'S RED BREAST[1]  It was very cold in the north country.  The ice was thick and the snow was deep.  The seal and the white bear were happy.  They liked the ice, the snow, and the cutting north wind, for their fur was thick and warm.  One night the great white bear climbed to the top of an immense iceberg.  He looked far across the country.  The fields of snow and the beautiful northern lights made the night almost as light as day.  The white bear saw no living thing save a few fur-clad animals and a little gray robin chirping cheerily as it picked away at an old bone.  Again the white bear looked down.  Almost at the foot of the iceberg crouched a hunter and his little son.  Between the two a tiny fire was blazing.  When the white bear saw the hunter and the boy guarding the fire he growled terribly.  He leaped across from one iceberg to another.  He went into his icy cave still growling.  \"It is the only fire in the whole north country,\" growled the white bear to himself.  \"If I could only put out that fire the land of ice and snow would be mine.  \"Neither the hunter nor the hunter's son could live, without fire.  I will watch my chance.  Perhaps some day I shall be so lucky as to put the fire out.\"  Now the Eskimo night is weeks long.  All through the long night the hunter kept"]]]
