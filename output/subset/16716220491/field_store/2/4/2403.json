When the tempest is lashing the surface of the sea into a state of the most violent and tremendous agitation, the caverns of the deep are wrapped in perfect repose.  This has been ascertained from the fact that in many places the bottom of the sea, as shown by the specimens brought up by Brooke's apparatus, and more recently by Professor Thompson's deep-sea dredge, is composed of exceedingly minute shells of marine insects.  These shells, when examined by the microscope, are found to be unbroken and perfect, though so fragile that they must certainly have been broken to pieces had they ever been subjected to the influence of currents, or to the pulverising violence of waves.  Hence the conclusion that the bottom of the sea is in a state of perpetual rest and placidity.  Indeed, when we think of it, we are led to conclude that this must necessarily be the case.  There are, as we shall presently show, currents of vast size and enormous power constantly flowing through the ocean; and when we think of the tremendous power of running water to cut through the solid rock, as exemplified in the case of Niagara, and many other rivers, what would be the result of the action of currents in the sea, compared with which Niagara is but a tiny rivulet?  Ocean currents, then, flow on a bed of still water, that protects the bottom of the sea from forces which, by calculation, we know would long ago have torn up the foundations of the deep, and would probably have destroyed the whole economy of nature, had not this beautiful arrangement been provided by the all-wise Creator.    CHAPTER THREE.  WAVES--SYSTEM IN ALL THINGS--VALUE OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE--ILLUSTRATIVE ANECDOTE--HEIGHT OF WAVES--DR. SCORESBY--SIZE, VELOCITY, AND AWFUL POWER OF WAVES--ANECDOTES REGARDING THEM--TIDES.  When a man stands on the deck of some tight-built ship, holding on to the weather bulwarks, and gazing with unphilosophic eye through the blinding spray at the fury of the tempest--by which the billows are made to roll around him like liquid mountains, and the ship is tossed beneath him like a mere chip, the sport and plaything of the raging waters--he is apt to think, should his thoughts turn in that direction at all, that all is unmitigated confusion; that the winds, which blew west yesterday and blow east to-day,--shifting, it may be, with gusty squalls, now here, now there, in chaotic fury,--are actuated by no laws, governed by no directing power.  Yet no thought could be more unphilosophical than this.  Apart altogether from divine revelation, by which we are informed that \"all deeps, fire, and hail, snow, and vapour, and stormy wind,\" are \"fulfilling God's word\" (which information we are bound to receive as a matter of faith if we be Christians, and as a matter of necessity if we be men of common sense, because it is mere absurdity to suppose that the \"stormy winds,\" etcetera, are _not_ fulfilling God's word--or will), we now know, to a great extent from practical experience and scientific investigation, that the winds blow and the waters of the ocean flow in grand, regular, uninterrupted currents.  Amongst these there are numberless eddies, which, perhaps, have tended to fill our minds with the idea of irregularity and confusion; but which, nevertheless, as well as the grand currents themselves, are subject to law, and are utterly devoid of caprice.  In regard to these matters there is much about which we are still in ignorance.  But the investigations of late years--especially those conducted under the superintendence of Captain Maury of the American Navy, and Doctors Carpenter and Thompson of England--have shown that our atmosphere and our ocean act in accordance with a systematic arrangement, many facts regarding which have been discovered, and turned, in some cases, to practical account.  See Note 1.  A very interesting instance of the practical use to which scientific inquiry can be turned, even in its beginnings, is given by Maury.  After telling us of the existence and nature of a current in the ocean called the Gulf Stream, he gives the following account of the manner in which upon one occasion be made use of his theoretical knowledge.  In the month of December 1853, the fine steam-ship _San Francisco_ sailed from New York with a regiment of United States troops on board, bound for California by way of Cape Horn.  She was overtaken, while crossing the Gulf Stream, by a gale of wind, in which she was dreadfully crippled.  Her decks were swept, and, by one single blow of those terrible seas that the storms raise in the Gulf Stream, more than in any other part of the Atlantic, one hundred and seventy-nine souls, officers and soldiers, were washed overboard and drowned.  The day after this disaster she was seen by one vessel, and again, the next day, December 26th, by another; but neither of them could render her any assistance.  When these two vessels arrived in the United States and reported what they had seen, the most painful apprehensions were entertained by friends for the safety of those on board the steamer.  Vessels were sent out to search for and relieve her.  But where should these vessels go? Where should they look?  An appeal was made to know what light the system of researches carried on at the National Observatory concerning winds and currents could throw upon the subject.  The materials they had been discussing were examined, and a chart was prepared to show the course of the Gulf Stream at that season of the year.  Two revenue cutters were then appointed to proceed to sea in search of the steamer, and Maury was requested to \"furnish them with instructions.\"  It will be observed here that the gentleman thus appealed to was at the time engaged in his study at Washington, utterly ignorant of all that had occurred within the previous few weeks on the stormy Atlantic, except through the reports brought thence by ships.  These reports furnished him with meagre data to proceed upon--simply that a crippled steamer had been seen in a certain latitude and longitude on a particular day.  But this information was sufficient for the practical man of science. Proceeding upon the supposition that the steamer had been completely disabled, he drew two lines on the chart to define the limits of her drift.  This his previous knowledge of the flow of the Gulf Stream at all seasons of the year enabled him to do.  Between these two lines, he said, the steamer, if she could neither steam nor sail after the gale, had drifted.  And that she could neither steam nor sail he had good reason to suppose from the account of her brought in by the vessels above mentioned.  A certain point was marked on the chart as being the spot where the searching vessels might expect to fall in with the wreck.  While these preparations were being made, two ships fell in with the wreck and relieved the crew.  This, however, was not known at the time by the anxious friends on shore.  The cutters sailed on their mission, and reached the indicated spot in the sea, where, of course, their assistance was now unnecessary.  But when the vessels that had relieved the crew of the wreck arrived in harbour and reported where the wreck had been last seen, it was found to be within a few miles of the spot indicated by Maury!  Thus, upon very slight data, a man of science and observation was enabled, while seated in his study, to follow the drift of a wrecked vessel over the pathless deep, and to indicate to a rescue party, not only the exact course they ought to steer, but the precise spot where the wreck should be found.  The waves of the ocean are by no means so high as people imagine.  Their appearance in the Atlantic or Pacific, when raised by a violent storm, is indeed very awful, and men have come to speak of them as being \"mountains of water.\"  But their sublime aspect and their tumultuous state of agitation have contributed much to deceive superficial observers as to their real height.  Scientific men have measured the height of the waves.  Not many years ago a vessel, while crossing the Atlantic, was overtaken by a violent storm.  The sea rose in its might; the good ship reeled under the combined influence of wind and waves.  While the majority of the passengers sought refuge from the driving spray in the cabin, one eccentric old gentleman was seen skipping about the deck with unwonted activity--now on the bulwarks, now on the quarter-deck, and anon in the rigging; utterly regardless of the drenching sea and the howling wind, and seeming as though he were a species of human stormy petrel.  This was the celebrated Dr Scoresby; a man who had spent his youth and manhood in the whale-fishing; who, late in life, entered the Church, and, until the day of his death, took a special delight in directing the attention of sailors to Him whose word stilled the tempest and bade the angry waves be calm.  Being an enthusiast in scientific research, Dr Scoresby was availing himself of the opportunity afforded by this storm to _measure the waves_!  Others have made similar measurements, and the result goes to prove that waves seldom or never rise much more than ten feet above the sea-level.  The corresponding depression sinks to the same depth, thus giving the entire height of the largest waves an elevation of somewhere between twenty and thirty feet.  When it is considered that sometimes the waves of the sea (especially those off the Cape of Good Hope) are so broad that only a few of them occupy the space of a mile, and that they travel at the rate of about forty miles an hour, we may have some slight idea of the grandeur as well as the power of the ocean billows.  The forms represented in our illustration are only wavelets on the backs of these monster waves.  Waves travel at a rate which increases in proportion to their size and the depth of water in which they are formed.

Immediately after, Polly ducked her head, and thus escaped being blown away, like a Hindoo mutineer from a cannon's mouth, as the captain went off in another fit.  \"Oh! father,\" said Polly, quite solemnly, as she descended and looked up from a comparatively safe distance, \"isn't it awful?\"  \"Yes, Poll, it's about the wust 'un I've had since I came from Barbadoes; but the last panful has mollified it, I think, and your nor'-wester has Pollyfied it, so, turn into your bunk, old girl, an' take a nap.  You've much need of it, poor thing.\"  \"No, father, if I get into my crib I'll sleep so heavy that you won't be able to wake me.  I'll just lie down where I was before.\"  \"Well, well--among the rubbish if ye prefer it; no matter s'long as you have a snooze,\" growled the captain as he turned over, while the fairy disappeared into the dark recess from which she had risen.  Just then a tap was heard at the door.  \"Come in,\" roared the captain. A tall, broad-shouldered, nautical-looking man entered, took off his hat, and stood before the hammock, whence the captain gave him a stern, searching glance, and opened fire on him with his pipe.  \"Forgive me if I intrude, Captain Samson,\" said the stranger; \"I know you, although you don't know me.  You start to-morrow or next day, I understand, for Melbourne?\"  \"Wind and weather permittin',\" growled the captain.  \"Well, what then?\"  \"Have you completed your crew?\" asked the stranger.  \"Nearly.  What then?\" replied the captain with a touch of ferocity, for he felt sensations of an approaching paroxysm.  \"Will you engage _me_?\" asked Philosopher Jack, for it was he.  \"In what capacity?\" demanded the captain somewhat sarcastically.  \"As an ordinary seaman--or a boy if you will,\" replied Edwin, with a smile.  \"No,\" growled Samson, decisively, \"I won't engage you; men with kid gloves and white hands don't suit me.\"  From the mere force of habit the young student had pulled on his gloves on leaving his lodging, and had only removed that of the right hand on entering the captain's dwelling.  He now inserted a finger at the wrist of the left-hand glove, ripped it off, and flung it with its fellow under the grate.  Thereafter he gathered some ashes and soot from the fireplace, with which he put his hands on a footing with those of a coal-heaver.  \"Will you take me now, captain?\" he said, returning to the hammock, and spreading out his hands.  The captain gave vent to a short laugh, which brought on a tremendous fit, at the conclusion of which he gasped, \"Yes, my lad, p'r'aps I will; but first I must know something about you.\"  \"Certainly,\" said the philosopher, and at once gave the captain a brief outline of his circumstances.  \"Well, you know your own affairs best\" said Captain Samson when he had finished; \"I'm no judge of such a case, but as you're willin' to ship, I'm willin' to ship you.  Come here before ten to-morrow.  Good night. There, it's a-comin'--hash--k--!\"  In the midst of another furious paroxysm Edwin Jack retired.  Not long after, the captain raised himself on one elbow, listened intently for a few seconds, and, having satisfied himself that Polly was asleep, slipped from his hammock--as only seamen know how--and proceeded to dress with the utmost caution.  He was evidently afraid of the little sleeper among the rubbish.  It was quite interesting to observe the quiet speed with which he thrust his great limbs into his ample garments, gazing anxiously all the time at Polly's corner.  Issuing from his own door with the step of an elephantine mouse, the captain went rapidly through several streets to the house of an intimate friend, whom he found at supper with his wife and family.  \"Evenin', Bailie Trench; how are 'ee, Mrs T? how's everybody?\" said the captain, in a hearty rasping voice, as he shook hands right and left, while one of his huge legs was taken possession of, and embraced, by the bailie's only daughter, a pretty little girl of six.  \"Why, Samson,\" exclaimed the bailie, after quiet had been restored, and his friend had been thrust into a chair with little Susan on his knee, \"I thought you were laid up with influenza--eh?\"  \"So I was, bailie, an' so I am,\" replied the captain; \"leastwise I'm still on the sick-list, and was in my hammock till about half an hour ago, but I'm gettin' round fast.  The night air seems to do me a world o' good--contrariwise to doctor's expectations.\"  \"Have some supper?\" said Mrs Trench, who was a weakish lady with watery eyes.  \"No supper, Mrs T, thank 'ee; the fact is, I've come on business.  I should be on my beam-ends by rights.  I'm absent without leave, an' have only a few minutes to spare.  The passenger I spoke of has changed his mind and his berth is free, so I'm glad to be able to take your son Ben after all.  But he'll have to get ready quick, for the _Lively Poll_ sails the day after to-morrow or next day--all bein' well.\"  The eyes of young Benjamin Trench sparkled.  He was a tall, thin, rather quiet lad of eighteen.  \"I can be ready to-night if you wish it, Captain Samson,\" he said, with a flush on his usually pale face.  Beside Mrs Trench there sat a sturdy little boy.  He was the bosom friend of Ben--a bright ruddy fellow of fourteen, overflowing with animal spirits, and with energy enough for three lads of his size.  This youth's countenance fell so visibly when Ben spoke of going away, that Mrs Trench could not help noticing it.  \"Why, what's the matter, Wilkins?\" she asked.  \"Oh, nothing!\" returned the boy, \"only I don't like to hear Ben speak of leaving us all and going to Australia.  And I would give all the world to go with him.  Won't you take me as a cabin boy, Captain Samson?\"  \"Sorry I can't, lad,\" said the captain, with a grin, \"got a cabin boy already.\"  \"Besides, your father would not let you,\" said Mrs Trench, \"and it would never do to go without his leave.  Only misfortune could come of that.\"  \"Humph! it's very hard,\" pouted the boy.  \"I wanted him to get me into the navy, and he wouldn't; and now I want him to get me into the merchant service, and he won't.  But I'll go in spite of him.\"  \"No, you won't, Watty,\" said Ben, laying his hand on his friend's shoulder.  \"Yes, Ben, I will,\" returned little Wilkins, with such an air of determination that every one except Ben laughed.  \"Now, bailie,\" said the captain, rising, \"I'm off.  The truth is, I wouldn't have come if it had not been important to let you know at once to get your boy ready; but I had no one to send except Polly, and I wouldn't send her out at night by herself for all the wealth of Indy. Moreover, _she_ wouldn't have let me out to-night for any consideration whatever.  She's very strict with me, is my little keeper.  I wouldn't for the world she should wake and find me gone.  So, good-night all.\"  Ten minutes more, and the guilty man entered his dwelling on tiptoe.  In order to get into his hammock with extreme caution he forsook his ancient method of a spring, and mounted on an empty cask.  The cask was not equal to the emergency.  He went through the head of it with a hideous crash!  Spurning it from him, he had just time to plunge into his place of repose and haul the clothes over him, when Polly emerged from her lair with wondering eyes.  \"What ever was that, father?\"  \"Nothin', my dear, nothin' in partickler--only a cask I kicked over. Now, then, Poll, since you're keepin' me awake in this fashion, it's your dooty to soothe me with an extra panful, and another nor'-wester-- so, up wi' the pyramid; and after you've done it you must turn into your crib.  I'll not want you again to-night; the cough's much better. There--thank 'ee.  Pollyfy me now--that's right.  Good-night.\"  Oh, base mariner! little did you merit such a pleasant termination to your evening's work; but you are not the only wicked man in this world who receives more than he deserves.  Two days after the incidents just related a noble ship spread her canvas to a favouring breeze, and bowing farewell to her port of departure, commenced the long long voyage to the Antipodes.  She was not a passenger ship, but a trader; nevertheless there were a few passengers on her quarter-deck, and among these towered the colossal figure of Captain Samson.  Beside him, holding his hand, stood a fairy-like little creature with brown curls and pretty blue eyes.  Not far from her, leaning over the bulwarks, Benjamin Trench frantically waved a handkerchief and wiped his eyes.  The signal was responded to, with equal feeling, by the bailie, his wife, and little Susan.  A good number of people, young and old, assembled at the pier-head, among whom many waved handkerchiefs, and hands, and scarfs, and hats to the crew.  Among the sailors who gazed wistfully towards the pier was one who made no farewell signal, and received no parting wave.  Philosopher Jack had concealed his intention of going to sea from all his college chums, and a bitter feeling of loneliness oppressed his heart as he thought of his old father and mother, and the lowly cottage on the Border hills.  He had not, indeed, acted in direct opposition to the wishes of his parents, but he had disobeyed the well-known Scripture command to do them \"honour,\" for he had resolved on his course of action without consulting them, or asking their advice.  He felt that he had very selfishly forsaken them in their old age; in the hour of their sore distress, and at a time when they stood woefully in need of his strong muscles, buoyant spirit, and energetic brain.  In short, Edwin Jack began to feel that he required all his philosophy, and something more, to enable him to face the future with the unflinching courage of a man.  So the ship moved slowly on, revealing on her stern the \"_Lively Poll_\" in letters of burnished gold--past the pier-head, down the broad river, out upon the widening firth, beyond lighthouse, buoy, and beacon, until at last the fresh Atlantic breezes filled her "]]]
