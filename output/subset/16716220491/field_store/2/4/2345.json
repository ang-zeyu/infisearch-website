Now isn't that good luck, my turnin' up just in the nick o' time to see you home?  Here, catch hold of my arm.  The wind's fit to tear the lamp-posts up by the roots.\"  \"But this is not the way home,\" objected the girl.  \"That's true, Miss May, it ain't, but I'm only goin' round a bit by St. Paul's Churchyard.  There's a shop there where they sell the sausages my old 'ooman's so fond of.  It don't add more than a few yards to the road home.\"  The old 'ooman to whom Solomon Flint referred was his grandmother. Flint himself had spent the greater part of his life in the service of the Post-Office, and was now a widower, well stricken in years.  His grandmother was one of those almost indestructible specimens of humanity who live on until the visage becomes deeply corrugated, contemporaries have become extinct, and age has become a matter of uncertainty.  Flint had always been a good grandson, but when his wife died the love he had borne to her seemed to have been transferred with additional vehemence to the \"old 'ooman.\"  \"There's a present for you, old 'ooman,\" said Flint, placing the paper of sausages on the table on entering his humble abode, and proceeding to divest himself of his waterproof cape; \"just let me catch hold of a fryin'-pan and I'll give you to understand what a blow-out means.\"  \"You're a good laddie, Sol,\" said the old woman, rousing herself and speaking in a voice that sounded as if it had begun its career far back in the previous century.  Mrs Flint was Scotch, and, although she had lived from early womanhood in London, had retained something of the tone and much of the pronunciation of the land o' cakes.  \"Ye'll be wat, lassie,\" she said to May, who was putting off her bonnet and shawl in a corner.  \"No, Grannie,\" returned the girl, using a term which the old woman had begged her to adopt, \"I'm not wet, only a little damp.\"  \"Change your feet, lassie, direc'ly, or you'll tak' cauld,\" said Mrs Flint in a peremptory tone.  May laughed gently and retired to her private boudoir to change her shoes.  The boudoir was not more than eight feet by ten in size, and very poorly furnished, but its neat, methodical arrangements betokened in its owner a refined and orderly mind.  There were a few books in a stand on the table, and a flower-pot on the window-sill.  Among the pegs and garments on the walls was a square piece of cardboard, on which was emblazoned in scarlet silk, the text, \"God is love.\"  This hung at the foot of the bed, so as to be the first object to greet the girl's eyes on awaking each morning.  Below it hung a row of photographs, embracing the late Reverend James Maylands, his widow, his son Philip, his distant relative Madge, and the baby.  These were so arranged as to catch the faint gleam of light that penetrated the window; but as there was a twenty-foot brick wall in front of the window at a distance of two yards, the gleam, even on a summer noon, was not intense.  In winter it was barely sufficient to render darkness visible.  Poor May Maylands!  It was a tremendous change to her from the free air and green fields of Ireland to a small back street in the heart of London; but necessity had required the change.  Her mother's income could not comfortably support the family.  Her own salary, besides supporting herself, was devoted to the enlargement of that income, and as it amounted to only 50 pounds a year, there was not much left to pay for lodgings, etcetera.  It is true Miss Lillycrop would have gladly furnished May with board and lodging free, but her house was in the neighbourhood of Pimlico, and May's duties made it necessary that she should live within a short distance of the General Post-Office.  Miss Lillycrop had heard of the Flints as being good-hearted and trusty people, and advised her cousin to board with them, at least until some better arrangement could be made for her.  Meanwhile May was to go and spend part of every Sunday with Miss Lillycrop at Number 9 Purr Street.  \"Well, Grannie,\" said May, returning to the front room, where the sausages were already hissing deliciously, \"what news have you for me to-night?\"  She sat down beside the old woman, took her hand and spoke in that cheery, cosy, confidential way which renders some women so attractive.  \"Deed, May, there's little but the auld story--Mercies, mornin', noon, and night.  But, oo ay, I was maist forgettin'; Miss Lillycrap was here, an left ye a message o' some sort.\"  \"And what was the message, Grannie?\"  \"She's gone and forgot it,\" said Solomon Flint, putting the sausages on the table, which had already been spread for supper by a stout little girl who was the sole domestic of the house and attendant on Mrs Flint. \"You've no chance of getting it now, Miss May, for I've noticed that when the old 'ooman once forgets a thing it don't come back to her-- except, p'r'aps, a week or two afterwards.  Come now, draw in and go to work.  But, p'r'aps, Dollops may have heard the message.  Hallo! Dollops! come here, and bring the kettle with you.\"  Dollops--the little girl above referred to--was particularly small and shy, ineffably stupid, and remarkably fat.  It was the last quality which induced Solomon to call her Dollops.  Her hair and garments stuck out from her in wild dishevelment, but she was not dirty.  Nothing belonging to Mrs Flint was allowed to become dirty.  \"Did you see Miss Lillycrop, Dollops?\" asked Solomon, as the child emerged from some sort of back kitchen.  \"Yes, sir, I did; I saw'd 'er a-goin' hout.\"  \"Did you hear her leave a message?\"  \"Yes, sir, I did.  I 'eard 'er say to missis, `Be sure that you give May Maylands my love, an tell 'er wotever she do to keep 'er feet dry, an' don't forgit the message, an' say I'm so glad about it, though it's not much to speak of arter all!'\"  \"What was she so glad about?\" demanded Solomon.  \"I dun know, sir.  She said no more in my 'earin' than that.  I only comed in w'en she was a-goin' hout.  P'r'aps it was about the findin' of 'er gloves in 'er pocket w'en she was a talkin' to missis, which she thought she'd lost, though they wasn't wuth pickin' up out of the--\"  \"Pooh! be off to your pots an' pans, child,\" said Flint, turning to his grandmother, who sat staring at the sausages with a blank expression. \"You can't remember it, I s'pose, eh?\"  Mrs Flint shook her head and began to eat.  \"That's right, old 'ooman,\" said her grandson, patting her shoulder; \"heap up the coals, mayhap it'll revive the memory.\"  But Mrs Flint's memory was not so easily revived.  She became more abstracted than usual in her efforts to recover it.  Supper passed and was cleared away.  The old woman was placed in her easy chair in front of the fire with the cat--her chief evening amusement--on her knee; the letter-carrier went out for his evening walk; Dollops proceeded miscellaneously to clean up and smash the crockery, and May sat down to indite an epistle to the inmates of Rocky Cottage.  Suddenly Mrs Flint uttered an exclamation.  \"May!\" she cried, and hit the cat an involuntary slap on the face which sent it with a caterwaul of indignant surprise from her knee, \"it wasn't a message, it was a letter!\"  Having thus unburdened her mind the old woman relapsed into the previous century, from which she could not be recalled.  May, therefore, made a diligent search for the letter, and found it at last under a cracked teapot on the mantelpiece, where Mrs Flint had told Miss Lillycrop to place it for safety.  It was short but satisfactory, and ran thus:--  \"DEAREST MAY,--I've been to see my friend `in power,' and he says it's `all right,' that you've only to get your brother over as soon as possible, and he'll see to getting him a situation.  The enclosed paper is for his and your guidance.  Excuse haste.--Your affectionate coz, SARAH LILLYCROP.\"  It need hardly be said that May Maylands finished her letter with increased satisfaction, and posted it that night.  Next morning she wrote out a telegram as follows:--\"Let Phil come here _at once_.  The application has been successful.  Never mind clothes. Everything arranged.  Best love to all.\"  The last clause was added in order to get the full value for her money. She naturally underscored the words \"at once,\" forgetting for the moment that, in telegraphy, a word underlined counts as two words.  She was therefore compelled to forego the emphasis.  This message she did not transmit through her own professional instrument, but gave it in at the nearest district office.  It was at once shot bodily, with a bundle of other telegrams, through a pneumatic tube, and thus reached St. Martin's-le-Grand in one minute thirty-five seconds, or about twenty minutes before herself.  Chancing to be the uppermost message, it was flashed off without delay, crossed the Irish Channel, and entered the office at Cork in about six minutes.  Here there was a short delay of half-an-hour, owing to other telegrams which had prior claim to attention.  Then it was flashed to the west coast, which it reached long before the letter posted on the previous night, and not long after May had seated herself at her own three-keyed instrument.  But there, telegraphic speed was thwarted by unavoidable circumstances, the post-runner having already started on his morning rounds, and it was afternoon before the telegram was delivered at Rocky Cottage.  This was the telegram which had caused Philip Maylands so much anxiety. He read it at last with great relief, and at the same time with some degree of sadness, when he thought of leaving his mother \"unprotected\" in her lonely cottage by the sea.    CHAPTER THREE.  BRILLIANT PROSPECTS.  Madge--whose proper name was Marjory Stevens--was absent when May's letter arrived the following day.  On her return to the cottage she was taken into the committee which sat upon the subject of Phil's appointment.  \"It's not a very grand appointment,\" said Mrs Maylands, with a sigh.  \"Sure it'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21694"],["title","The Prairie Chief (#1)"],["body"," thought he, \"I know it.\"  \"Little Tim will go with me?\" asked the Indian, as they turned into the hollow where the horses had been left.  \"Ay, Whitewing,\" answered the trapper, with a touch of enthusiasm; \"Little Tim will stick to you through thick and thin, as long as--\"  An exclamation from the Indian at that moment stopped him, for it was discovered that the horses were not there.  The place was so open that concealment was not possible.  The steeds of both men had somehow got rid of their hobbles and galloped away.  A feeling of despair came over the Indian at this discovery.  It was quickly followed by a stern resolve.  He was famed as being the fleetest and most enduring brave of his tribe.  He would _run_ home.  Without saying a word to his friend, he tightened his belt, and started off like a hound loosed from the leash.  Little Tim ran a few hundred yards after him at top speed, but suddenly pulled up.  \"Pooh!  It's useless,\" he exclaimed.  \"I might as well run after a streak o' greased lightnin'.  Well, well, women have much to answer for! Who'd iver have thowt to see Whitewing shook off his balance like that? It strikes me I'll sarve him best by lookin' after the nags.\"  While the trapper soliloquised thus he ran back to the camp to get one of the Indian horses, wherewith to go off in search of his own and that of his friend.  He found the Indians busy making preparations to ride to the rescue of their Bald Eagle allies; but quick though these sons of the prairie were, they proved too slow for Little Tim, who leaped on the first horse he could lay hold of, and galloped away.  Meanwhile Whitewing ran with the fleet, untiring step of a trained runner whose heart is in his work; but the way was long, and as evening advanced even his superior powers began to fail a little.  Still he held on, greatly overtaxing his strength.  Nothing could have been more injudicious in a prolonged race.  He began to suspect that it was unwise, when he came to a stretch of broken ground, which in the distance was traversed by a range of low hills.  As he reached these he reduced the pace a little, but while he was clambering up the face of a rather precipitous cliff, the thought of the Blackfoot band and of the much-loved one came into his mind; prudence went to the winds, and in a moment he was on the summit of the cliff, panting vehemently--so much so, indeed, that he felt it absolutely necessary to sit down for a few moments to rest.  While resting thus, with his back against a rock, in the attitude of one utterly worn out, part of the missionary's text flashed into his mind: \"the race that is set before us.\"  \"Surely,\" he murmured, looking up, \"this race is set before me.  The object is good.  It is my duty as well as my desire.\"  The thought gave an impulse to his feelings; the impulse sent his young blood careering, and, springing up, he continued to run as if the race had only just begun.  But ere long the pace again began to tell, producing a sinking of the heart, which tended to increase the evil. Hour after hour had passed without his making any perceptible abatement in the pace, and the night was now closing in.  This however mattered not, for the full moon was sailing in a clear sky, ready to relieve guard with the sun.  Again the thought recurred that he acted unwisely in thus pressing on beyond his powers, and once more he stopped and sat down.  This time the text could not be said to flash into his mind, for while running, it had never left him.  He now deliberately set himself to consider it, and the word \"patience\" arrested his attention.  \"Let us run with patience,\" he thought.  \"I have not been patient.  But the white man did not mean this kind of race at all; he said it was the whole race of life.  Well, if so, _this_ is part of that race, and it _is_ set before me.  Patience! patience!  I will try.\"  With childlike simplicity the red man rose and began to run slowly.  For some time he kept it up, but as his mind reverted to the object of his race his patience began to ooze out.  He could calculate pretty well the rate at which the Blackfoot foes would probably travel, and knowing the exact distance, perceived that it would be impossible for him to reach the camp before them, unless he ran all the way at full speed.  The very thought of this induced him to put on a spurt, which broke him down altogether.  Stumbling over a piece of rough ground, he fell with such violence that for a moment or two he lay stunned.  Soon, however, he was on his legs again, and tried to resume his headlong career, but felt that the attempt was useless.  With a deep irrepressible groan, he sank upon the turf.  It was in this hour of his extremity that the latter part of the preacher's text came to his mind: \"looking unto Jesus.\"  Poor Whitewing looked upwards, as if he half expected to see the Saviour with the bodily eye, and a mist seemed to be creeping over him.  He was roused from this semi-conscious state by the clattering of horses' hoofs.  The Blackfoot band at once occurred to his mind.  Starting up, he hid behind a piece of rock.  The sounds drew nearer, and presently he saw horsemen passing him at a considerable distance.  How many he could not make out.  There seemed to be very few.  The thought that it might be his friend the trapper occurred, but if he were to shout, and it should turn out to be foes, not only would his own fate but that of his tribe be sealed.  The case was desperate; still, anything was better than remaining helplessly where he was.  He uttered a sharp cry.  It was responded to at once in the voice of Little Tim, and next moment the faithful trapper galloped towards Whitewing leading his horse by the bridle.  \"Well, now, this is good luck,\" cried the trapper, as he rode up.  \"No,\" replied the Indian gravely, \"it is not _luck_.\"  \"Well, as to that, I don't much care what you call it--but get up.  Why, what's wrong wi' you?\"  \"The run has been very long, and I pressed forward impatiently, trusting too much to my own strength.  Let my friend help me to mount.\"  \"Well, now I come to think of it,\" said the trapper, as he sprang to the ground, \"you have come a tremendous way--a most awful long way--in an uncommon short time.  A fellow don't think o' that when he's mounted, ye see.  There now,\" he added, resuming his own seat in the saddle, \"off we go.  But there's no need to overdrive the cattle; we'll be there in good time, I warrant ye, for the nags are both good and fresh.\"  Little Tim spoke the simple truth, for his own horse which he had discovered along with that of his friend some time after parting from him, was a splendid animal, much more powerful and active than the ordinary Indian horses.  The steed of Whitewing was a half-wild creature of Spanish descent, from the plains of Mexico.  Nothing more was spoken after this.  The two horsemen rode steadily on side by side, proceeding with long but not too rapid strides over the ground: now descending into the hollows, or ascending the gentle undulations of the plains; anon turning out and in to avoid the rocks and ruts and rugged places; or sweeping to right or left to keep clear of clumps of stunted wood and thickets, but never for a moment drawing rein until the goal was reached, which happened very shortly before the break of day.  The riding was absolute rest to Whitewing, who recovered strength rapidly as they advanced.  \"There is neither sight nor sound of the foe here,\" murmured the Indian.  \"No, all safe!\" replied the trapper in a tone of satisfaction, as they cantered to the summit of one of the prairie waves, and beheld the wigwams of Bald Eagle shining peacefully in the moonlight on the plain below.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE SURPRISE AND COMBAT.  How frequently that \"slip 'twixt the cup and the lip\" is observed in the affairs of this life!  Little Tim, the trapper, had barely pronounced the words \"All safe,\" when an appalling yell rent the air, and a cloud of dark forms was seen to rush over the open space that lay between the wigwams of the old chief Bald Eagle and a thicket that grew on its westward side.  The Blackfoot band had taken the slumbering Indians completely by surprise, and Whitewing had the mortification of finding that he had arrived just a few minutes too late to warn his friends.  Although Bald Eagle was thus caught unprepared, he was not slow to meet the enemy. Before the latter had reached the village, all the fighting men were up, and armed with bows, scalping-knives, and tomahawks.  They had even time to rush towards the foe, and thus prevent the fight from commencing in the midst of the village.  The world is all too familiar with the scenes that ensued.  It is not our purpose to describe them.  We detest war, regarding it in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred as unnecessary.  Sufficient to say here that the overwhelming numbers of the Blackfoot Indians were too much for their enemies.  They soon began to overpower and drive them back towards the wigwams, where the poor women and children were huddled together in terror.  Before this point had arrived, however, Whitewing and Little Tim were galloping to the rescue.  The former knew at a glance that resistance on the part of his friends would be hopeless.  He did not therefore gallop straight down to the field of battle to join them, but, turning sharply aside with his friend, swept along one of the bottoms or hollows between the undulations of the plain, where their motions could not be seen as they sped along.  Whitewing looked anxiously at Little Tim, who, observing the look, said:--  \"I'm with 'ee, Whitewing, niver fear.\"  \"Does my brother know that we ride to death?\" asked the Indian in an earnest tone.  \"Yer brother don't know nothin' o' the sort,\" replied the trapper, \"and, considerin' your natur', I'd have expected ye to think that Manitou might have some hand in the matter.\"  \"The white man speaks wisely,\" returned the chief, accepting the reproof with a"]]]
