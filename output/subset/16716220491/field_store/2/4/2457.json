Jane looked up at her husband. There was no touch of envy or discontent in his voice. She was about to speak but checked herself.  \"Which is yours, John?\" she asked a moment later, returning to his first remark.  \"I am sure I could not tell,\" he said with a laugh. \"Babies are mostly pretty much alike, and as these two are just the same age, and just the same size, and have both got gray eyes and light coloured hair--if you can call it hair,--and no noses to speak of, I don't see a pin's point of difference.\"  A month later a small party were assembled in Captain Clinton's bungalow. Mrs. Humphreys was standing with a baby in each arm. Mrs. Clinton was lying upon a sofa crying bitterly. Captain Clinton was walking up and down the room, hot and angry. The surgeon of the regiment was standing grave and sympathetic by Mrs. Clinton. Sergeant Humphreys was in the attitude of attention by the door, with an anxious troubled expression on his face.  \"What in the world is to be done, doctor?\" Captain Clinton asked. \"I never heard of such a thing, it is a most serious business.\"  \"I can quite see that,\" the doctor replied. \"When Mrs. Humphreys came to me and asked me to break the news to you, I told her at once that it was a terrible business. I own that I do not see that she is altogether to blame, but it is a most unfortunate occurrence. As I have just told you, she had, when she put the children to bed, put your child in one of her baby's night-gowns, as it happened there were none of your child's clean. In the morning she took them out and laid them on a rug on the ground before beginning to wash and dress them. She went out to the canteen to get something for her husband's breakfast, and when she returned she could not remember the order in which she had taken them out of bed and laid them down, and could not distinguish her own child from yours.\"  \"You must remember, Mrs. Humphreys,\" Captain Clinton broke in; \"think it over, woman. You must remember how you laid them down.\"  \"Indeed, I do not, sir; I have been thinking all the morning. I had nursed them two or three times during the night, and of course had changed their position then. I never thought about their having the same night-gowns on. If I had, of course I should have been more careful, for I have said to my husband over and over again that it was only by their clothes that I should know them apart, for if they had been twins they could not be more alike.  \"This is downright maddening!\" Captain Clinton exclaimed, pacing up and down the room. \"And is there no mark nor anything by which they can be recognized? Why, bless me, woman, surely you as a mother ought to know your own child!\"  Mrs. Humphreys shook her head. \"I have nursed them both, sir, and which is mine and which is yours I could not say to save my life.\"  \"Well, put the children down on that sofa,\" Captain Clinton said, \"and take yourself off for the present; you have done mischief enough for a lifetime. I will let you know what we decide upon later on.\"  \"Well, doctor, what on earth is to be done?\" he asked after the door had closed upon the sergeant and his wife. \"What do you think had best be done, Lucy?\"  But Mrs. Clinton, who was but just recovering from her illness, was too prostrated by this terrible blow to be able to offer any suggestion.  \"It is a terrible business indeed, Clinton,\" the doctor said, \"and I feel for you most deeply. Of course the possibility of such a thing never entered my mind when I recommended you to let Mrs. Humphreys act as its foster-mother. It seemed at the time quite a providential circumstance that she too should be just confined, and in a position to take to your baby. The only possible suggestion I can offer is that you should for a time bring up both boys as your own. At present they are certainly wonderfully alike, but it is probable that as they grow up you will see in one or other of them a likeness to yourself or your wife, and that the other will take after its own parents. Of course these likenesses do not always exist, but in nine cases out of ten some resemblance can be traced between a boy and one or other of his parents.\"  \"That certainly seems feasible,\" Captain Clinton said in a tone of relief. \"What do you say, dear? It is only bringing up the two children for a time till we are able to be certain which is our own. The other will have had the advantage of a good education and so on, and of course it will be our business to give him a good start in life.\"  \"It will be awful having the two children, and not knowing which is our own.\"  \"It will be very unpleasant,\" Captain Clinton said soothingly; \"but, you see, in time you will come to care for them both just as if they had been twins.\"  \"That will be almost as bad,\" Mrs. Clinton cried feebly. \"And suppose one gets to love the wrong one best?\"  \"We won't suppose that, dear; but if we love them both equally, we will, when we find out which is ours, treat the other as an adopted child and complete his education, and start him in life as if he were so. Fortunately the expense will be nothing to us.\"  \"But this woman has a right to one of them.\"  \"She does not deserve to have one,\" Captain Clinton said angrily; \"but of course we must make some arrangement with her. She is bound to do her best to repair the terrible mischief her carelessness has caused. Well, doctor, we will think it over for an hour or two, but certainly your suggestion seems by far the best for us to adopt.\"  \"The hussy!\" the doctor said as he walked away to his quarters. \"I am more than half inclined to believe that she has done it on purpose. I never liked the jade before she married, though I own that she has turned out better than I expected. But I always thought her a designing and artful young woman, and gave her credit for plenty of brains, and what could suit her purpose better than this change of children? She would see that in the first place she would get her own boy well brought up, and perhaps provided for, with all sorts of chances of making money out of the affair. It may have been an accident, of course, but if so, it was a wonderfully fortunate one for her.\"  Such was the opinion among the women of the regiment when the news became known, and Jane Humphreys was speedily made aware of the fact by the change in their manner towards her. They had, however, but small opportunity for demonstrating their opinion, for Mrs. Humphreys remained shut up as much as possible in her room, and the one or two women who were inclined to take a favourable view of the matter and so called upon her, reported that she was completely prostrated by the occurrence. Among the officers and their families the greatest commiseration was felt for Captain Clinton and his wife, and the matter was discussed at tiffin that day with great animation.  \"Don't you think, doctor, that a woman must know her own child?\" a young ensign asked.  \"Not at all, Arbuthnot; that is to say, not if you mean that she would know it by any sort of maternal instinct. There is no such thing. She has no more means of telling her own infant out of a dozen others of similar complexion, age, and appearance, than she would have of picking out her own pocket-handkerchief out of a dozen others of similar pattern if they were all unmarked.\"  \"But a sheep can pick out his own lamb among a hundred, doctor, and I am sure they are alike as so many peas. Surely that must be maternal instinct?\"  \"Not in the smallest degree, Arbuthnot. The sheep and other animals possess in a very high degree a sense which is comparatively rudimentary in human beings. I mean, of course, the sense of smell. A sheep knows her lamb, and a cow knows her calf, neither by the sense of hearing or by that of sight. She recognizes it solely and wholly by her sense of smell, just as a dog can track its master's footsteps out of a thousand by the same sense. The two babies are as alike as twins; and I am not surprised that, if they really got mixed, this woman should not be able to detect one from the other.\"  \"It is an awful thing for Clinton,\" the major said. \"Here he has got a splendid estate, and he will never be certain whether his own son or a stranger is going to inherit it after him. It is enough to make a man go out of his mind.\"  \"I don't see that that would be likely to mend matters,\" the doctor said dryly; \"in fact it would lessen the one chance that exists of ever setting the matter straight. As I have told him, though these children are very much alike at present--and indeed most babies are--it is probable that as they grow up there will no longer be any resemblance whatever, and that his own child will develop a likeness either to him or Mrs. Clinton, while the other child will resemble the sergeant or his wife.\"  \"We must hope it will be so,\" the major said, \"though there are lots of fellows who don't resemble in the least either of their parents. But what is Clinton going to do about it?\"  \"He has not settled yet. His wife was in no condition to discuss the matter, poor lady! My suggestion was that he should bring up both the children as if they were his own, until one or other of them develops this likeness that I was speaking of.\"  \"I suppose that is the best thing they can do, doctor; but it will be an awful business if, as they grow up, no likeness to anybody can be detected in either of them.\"  \"Well, major, although at present it does seem an awful thing, it won't seem so bad at the end, say, of twenty years. They will naturally by that time be as fond of one as the other."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21986"],["title","The Dash for Khartoum: A Tale of the Nile Expedition (#2)"],["body"," boys, in fact, will be like twins; and I suppose the property can be divided in some such way as it would be were they really in that relation to each other.\"  \"But, you see, doctor,\" one of the captains said, \"Mrs. Humphreys has to be considered to a certain extent too. It is hard on Mrs. Clinton; but if she gets both boys she is certain at any rate that one of them is her son, and Mrs. Humphreys will, by that arrangement, have to lose her child altogether. That seems to me pretty rough on her.\"  \"Well, she brought it on herself,\" the doctor replied. \"The whole thing has arisen from her carelessness.\"  \"Do you think it was carelessness, doctor?\" the major asked.  \"That is a matter on which I will give no opinion, major. It is one upon which one man can form a judgment as well as another. The thing may very well have happened in the way she describes; and again it may be a very cunningly devised plot on her part. It is evident she had everything to gain by such an accident. She would get her child taken off her hands, educated, and provided for. She would calculate no doubt that she would be their nurse, and would expect, in return for giving up her claim to one or other of them, some very distinct monetary advantages. I do not at all say that the affair was not an accident. Upon the contrary, I admit that it was an accident which might very well happen under the circumstances. What I do say is, nothing could have turned out better for her.\"  Just as tiffin was finished, Captain Clinton's soldier-servant came into the mess-room with the request that Dr. Parker should go across to his master's bungalow. \"Well, doctor,\" Captain Clinton said as he entered, \"in the first place I want you to go up and see my wife, and give her a sedative or something, for she is terribly upset over this affair; and in the next place I want to tell you that we have agreed to take your advice in the matter, and to bring up the two children as our own until we can make out which of the two is our child; then I want your advice as to whether they can be weaned without any damage to their health. My wife is determined upon that point. They shall not be brought up by Mrs. Humphreys. There is no other woman, is there, in the regiment with a young baby?\"  The doctor shook his head. \"There are one or two with babies, but not with babies young enough for her to take to these. It would certainly be far better that they should have the natural nourishment, but I do not say that they would necessarily suffer from being weaned. Still, you see, Clinton, there is a question whether this woman will consent to part with both the children.\"  \"I quite see that, doctor, and of course I shall be ready to make any money arrangements that will content her.\"  \"I would see the husband, if I were you,\" the doctor said. \"He is a steady, well-conducted young fellow, and however this matter has come about, I quite acquit him of having any share in it. I think you will find it more easy to deal with him than his wife. Unfortunately, you see, there is always a difficulty with adopted children. A father cannot sell away his rights; he may agree to do so, but if he changes his mind afterwards he can back out of his agreement. However he may bind himself never to interfere with it, the fact remains that he has a legal right to the custody of his child. And though Sergeant Humphreys might keep any agreement he might make, the mother might give you no end of trouble afterwards.\"  \"I see all that, doctor, but of the two evils I think the one we propose is the least. My wife says she could not bear to see this woman about the children, and I have a good deal of the same feeling myself. At any rate in her present state of health I wish to spare her all trouble and anxiety as much as I can, and therefore it is better to buy this woman off for the present, even though we may have to run the risk of trouble with her afterwards. Anyhow, something must be done at once. The children have both been squalling for the last hour, though I believe that they have had some milk or something given to them. So I had better send across for Humphreys, the sooner the matter is got over the better.\"  The young sergeant presently appeared.  \"Sit down, sergeant. I want to have a talk with you over this terribly painful business. In one respect I quite understand that it is as painful for you and Mrs. Humphreys as it is for us, but in other respects you are much better off than I am. Not only do I not know which is my child, but I do not know which is heir to my estate; which is, as you will understand, a most serious matter.\"  \"I can quite understand that, sir,\" the sergeant said quietly.  \"The only plan that I can see,\" Captain Clinton went on, \"is that for the present I shall adopt both children, and shall bring them up as my own. Probably in time one of them will grow up with some resemblance to myself or Mrs. Clinton, and the other will show a likeness to you or your wife. In that case I should propose to finish the education of your boy, and then to provide for him by putting him into the army, or such other profession as he may choose; for it would be very unfair after bringing him up and educating him as my own to turn him adrift. Thus, you see, in any case my adoption of him would be greatly to his benefit. I can, of course, thoroughly understand that it will be very hard for you and Mrs. Humphreys to give up your child. Very hard. And I am quite ready to make any pecuniary arrangement with you and her that you may think right. I may say that I do not think that it would be desirable that Mrs. Humphreys should continue as their nurse. I want to consider the boys as my own, and her presence would be constantly bringing up unpleasant remembrances. In the second place I think that it would be better for her that she should not act as their nurse. She would know that one of them is her own, and the separation when it came would be very much more painful than it would be at present. Of course I do not expect an answer from you just at this moment. You will naturally wish to talk it over with her, but I shall be glad if you will let us have an answer as soon as you can, as it is necessary that we should obtain another nurse without loss of time.\"  \"What you say seems to me very fair, Captain Clinton,\" the sergeant said. \"I would give anything, sir, that this shouldn't have happened. I would rather have shot myself first. I can answer for myself, sir, that I accept your offer. Of course, I am sorry to lose the child; but a baby is not much to a man till it gets to know him and begins to talk, and it will be a satisfaction to know that he is in good hands, with a far better look-out than I could have given him. I will see my wife, sir, and let you know in half an hour.\"  \"Do you think that she will consent, Humphreys?\"  \"I am sure she will,\" the sergeant said briefly, and then added, \"There is nothing else she could do,\" and saluting he went out of the room.  \"He suspects his wife of having done it on purpose,\" Dr. Parker said, speaking for the first time since the sergeant had entered the room. \"I don't say he knows it, but he suspects it. Did you notice how decidedly he said that she would consent? And I fancy up to now she has had her own way in everything.\"  \"Well, what do they say?\" Mrs. Humphreys asked as her husband entered the door. He told her shortly the offer that had been made. She laughed scornfully. \"A likely thing that! So they are to have both children, and I am not to be allowed even to see them; and they are to pick and choose as to which they like to say is theirs, and we are to be shouldered out of it altogether! It is just as bad for me not to know which is my boy as it is for that woman; but they are to take the whole settlement of things in their hands, my feelings to go for nothing. Of course you told them that you would not let them do such a thing?\"  \"I did not tell them anything of the sort. I told them that I accepted their proposal, and that I could answer for your accepting it too.\"  \"Then you were never more wrong in your life, John Humphreys!\" she said angrily; \"I won't consent to anything of the sort. Luck has thrown a good thing in our hands, and I mean to make the most of it. We ought to get enough out of this to make us comfortable for life if we work it well. I did not think that you were such a soft!\"  \"Soft or not soft, it is going to be done as they propose,\" her husband said doggedly. \"It is burden enough as it is--we have lost our child. Not that I care so very much about that; there will be time enough for more, and children do not add to the comfort of close little quarters like these. But whether we like it or not, we have lost the child. In the next place we shall never hear the end of it in the regiment, and I shall see if I cannot manage to get transferred to another. There will be no standing the talk there will be.\"  \"Let them talk!\" his wife said scornfully. \"What do we care about their talk!\"  \"I care a great deal,\" he said. \"And I tell you why, because I know what they will say is true.\"  \"What do you mean?\" she asked quickly.  \"I mean, Jane, that I know you mixed up those children on purpose.\"  \"How dare you say so!\" she exclaimed making a step forward as if she would strike him.  \"I will tell you why I say so. Because I went to the drawer this morning before going to parade, and I saw some of Mrs. Clinton's baby's night-gowns in it. Yes, I see they are all in the wash-tub now; but they were there this morning, and when I heard you say you had put the child into one of our baby's night-gowns because it had no clean ones of its own, I knew that you were lying, and that you had done this on purpose.\"  The woman was silent a moment and then burst out, \"You are a greater fool than ever I thought you! I did tell a lie when I gave that reason for putting the child into our baby's gown. When I took the two clean ones out of the drawer I did"]]]
