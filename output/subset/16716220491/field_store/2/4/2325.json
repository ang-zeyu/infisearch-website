The sagacious brute seemed to understand how frail the tenure was that held them all suspended over eternity; for he did nothing more than rest the top of his paw on the precious raft.     CHAPTER IV.  A PASSENGER.   By this time our friends were a quarter of a mile in the rear of the burning steamer. The furious pulsations of the engines had stopped, and from stern to stern the great ship was one mass of soothing flame. The light threw a glare upon the clouds above, and made it so bright where our friends were floating in the water that they could have read the pages of a printed book. The illumination must have been seen for many and many a mile in every direction upon the Pacific.  \"Yes, the steamer has stopped,\" said Howard; \"the fire has reached the engines, and now they must do as we have done.\"  \"But they have boats and may escape.\"  \"Not half enough of them; and then what they have got will be seized by the crew, as they always do at such times.\"  \"Look! you can see them jumping over. The poor wretches hang fast till they are so scorched that they have to let go.\"  \"It's mighty lucky yees are here,\" said Tim, \"for every mother's son that can swim will be hugged by a half-dozen that can't, which would be bad for me.\"  \"Why so; can't you swim?\"  \"Not a bit of it.\"  \"And nothing but this bench to keep us from sinking.\"  \"And be the same towken isn't that good enough, if it only kaaps us afloat? Can't ye be satisfied?\"  \"Look! how grand!\"  It was indeed a fearful sight, the steamer being one pyramid of roaring, blazing fire, sweeping upward in great fan-like rifts, then blowing outward, horizontally across the deep, as if greedy for the poor beings who had sprung in agony from its embrace. Millions of sparks were floating and drifting overhead and falling all around. The shrieks of the despairing passengers, as with their clothes all aflame they sprung blindly into the ocean, could be heard by our friends, and must indeed have extended a far greater distance.  For an hour the conflagration raged with apparently unabated violence, the wreck drifting quite rapidly; but the fire soon tired of its work, large pieces of burning timber could be seen floating in the water, and finally the charred hull made a plunge downward into the sea, and our friends were left alone upon their frail support.  \"Now, it's time to decide what we are going to do,\" said Howard.  \"You are right, and what shall it be? Shall we drift about here until morning, when some vessel will pick us up? I have no doubt this fire has drawn a half-dozen toward it.\"  \"No; let's make for shore.\"  \"That is the best plan,\" said Tim.  \"But it is a good way off,\" remarked Howard; \"and I have little hope of reaching it.\"  \"Never mind; it, will keep us busy, and that will make the time pass faster than if we do nothing but float.\"  \"We may need our strength; but it is the best plan.\"  \"But do we know the direction?\"  \"I can tell you that,\" said Elwood; \"for the moon was directly over the shore; so all we've got to do is to aim for the moon.\"  \"Begorrah! we can walk and talk, as the owld lady said when her husband stopped on the way to the gallows to bid her good-by. So paddle away!\"  It being a warm summer night, the water was quite pleasant, although our friends were sure to get enough of it long before they could hope to place their feet upon the earth. Having now an object, they began working with a will, the boys swimming as lustily as possible straight for the shore, while Tim assisted materially in pushing forward the craft.  The intelligent Newfoundland appeared to comprehend what was wanted, and contributed not a little to the momentum.  \"Do you think we are making any progress----\"  \"O, save me! save me! I'm drowning!\"  The voice sounded close by them, and caused an involuntary start from all three.  \"Where is he?\" asked Howard, in a terrified whisper.  \"There!\"  At that moment they caught sight of a man fiercely buffeting the waves, as he rose on an immense swell, and then sunk down again in the trough of the sea.  \"Can we do anything for him?\" asked Elwood. \"It's too bad to see the poor fellow sink when we may save him.\"  \"I'm afeared the owld bench won't bear another hand on it.\"  But Terror had heard that cry and anticipated the wishes of his friends. Leaving them with their raft, he struck powerfully out toward the drowning man, and they both went down in the vast sea chasm together. When they came in view again upon the crest of the swell, the Newfoundland had the hair of the man's head in his teeth and had begun his return. A moment later the gasping man threw out his hands and caught the settee with such eagerness that it instantly sunk.  \"Be careful!\" admonished Howard, \"or you'll drown us all. One of us can't swim!\"  \"Won't your raft bear us?\"  \"Yes, if you keep only your head above water and bear very lightly upon it. Don't attempt to rise up.\"  \"All right!\"  The buoyant raft came to the surface, and was instantly grasped firmly but carefully by all. Poor Tim O'Rooney had come very near drowning. A man when suddenly cast into the water for the first time has been known to swim long and well; and the Irishman, by the most furious effort, had saved himself from strangling and sinking, although he had swallowed a good deal of the nauseating sea-water, and was now ejecting it.  \"Worrah! I took an overdose that time, and it wouldn't sthay on my stomach!\" he said. \"I'm thinking there'll be no necessity of me swallowing any salts for some time to coom, be the towken that I've enough to last me me life-time.\"  \"We are all right now!\" said the stranger. \"I can swim, but I was just about used up when your dog took me in tow. May I inquire who my friends are?\"  Howard gave their names and destination, and he instantly said:  \"My name is Manuel Yard, and my place of business is next door to that of your fathers.\"  \"You know them then.\"  \"I have known them both very well for years, and now that you have given me your names I remember you both.\"  After a few more words, our friends recognized him as a tall, pale-looking man, with whom they had exchanged greetings more than once on their passage from Panama.  \"I've been down to the Isthmus,\" he added, \"and was on my way home when the steamer took fire.\"  \"Where were you when you heard the alarm?\"  \"Sound asleep in my berth; I had no time even to put on my clothes; but, thank God, if I can escape in any way.\"  \"Stick to us, and help shove this craft, and I'm in hopes we'll fetch up somewhere by morning.\"     CHAPTER V.  LAND.   Under the united propulsion of three men and a large Newfoundland dog, the small raft moved shoreward with no insignificant speed. It was found amply sufficient to preserve them all from drowning had none known how to swim, provided they managed the matter prudently. There is so little difference in the quantity of water and the human body, that a slight effort, if properly made, will keep it afloat. The trouble with new beginners is that when they first go beyond their depth their blind struggles tend to carry them downward more than upward.  \"This is rather pleasant,\" remarked Mr. Yard. \"There is little doubt, I think, of reaching land. There is only one thing that makes the shivers run over me.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"The thought of _sharks_!\"  \"Ugh! Why did you spake of them?\" asked Tim, with a strong expression of disgust. \"I've been thinking of 'em ever since I've been in the water, but I didn't want to skeer the boys.\"  \"They never once entered my head,\" said Howard.  \"Nor mine either,\" added Elwood. \"Are they in this part of the ocean?\"  \"You will find them in almost every part of the sea, I was going to say. They abound off the coast of California.\"  \"But it is night, and they will not be apt to see!\"  \"This fire and the numbers of drowning people will draw hundreds of the finny inhabitants toward us. You know a fire at night is sure to attract fish.\"  \"You seem determined to frighten us,\" said Howard, \"but I shall continue to think that God who has so mercifully saved us intends to save us to the end.\"  \"Perhaps so, too, but it does no harm to understand all the dangers to which we are subject.\"  \"I believe with Howard,\" said Elwood. \"I ain't afraid of sharks, but for all that, they are ugly creatures. They swim under you and the first thing you know clip goes one of your legs off, just the same as a pair of snuffers would clip off a piece of wick.\"  \"They are the hyenas of the sea,\" said Howard, \"although I believe some kinds are stupid and harmless. I think I have heard them called that by somebody, I don't remember who. They will snap up anything that is thrown to them.\"  \"Wouldn't it make their eyes water to come this way then? Jis' to think of their saaing four pair of legs dancing over their hids, not to spake of the dog that could come in by way of dessart.\"  \"O Tim! keep still, it is too dreadful!\"  \"Worrah! it wasn't meself that introduced the subject, but as yez have got started, I've no objection to continue the same.\"  \"Let us try and talk about something more pleasant----\"  \"A shark! a shark!\" suddenly screamed Elwood, springing half his length out of the water in his excitement.  \"Where?\" demanded Mr. Yard, while the others were speechless with terror.  \"He has hold of my leg! O, save me, for he is pulling me under!\"  There was danger for a moment that all would go to the bottom, but Mr. Yard displayed a remarkable coolness that saved them all.  \"It is not a shark,\" said he, \"or he would have had your leg off before this.\"  \"What is it then? What can it be?\"  \"It is a drowning man that has caught your foot as he was going down. You must kick him off or he will drown you. Has he one foot or both?\"  \"My left ankle is grasped by something.\"  \"That is good; if he had hold of both feet it would be bad for you. Use your free foot and force his grasp loose.\"  Elwood did so with such vigor"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21630"],["title","Bibliomania in the Middle Ages (#1)"],["body","to the illuminator, who painted it. The ornamentation of a mediæval book of the first class is beyond description by words or by wood cuts. Every inch of space was used. Its broad margins were filled with quaint ornaments, sometimes of high merit, admirably painted in vivid colors. Grotesque initials, which, with their flourishes, often spanned the full height of the page, or broad bands of floriated tracery that occupied its entire width, were the only indications of changes of chapter or subject. In printer's phrase the composition was \"close-up and solid\" to the extreme degree of compactness. The uncommonly free use of red ink for the smaller initials was not altogether a matter of taste; if the page had been written entirely in black ink it would have been unreadable through its blackness. This nicety in writing consumed much time, but the mediæval copyist was seldom governed by considerations of time or expense. It was of little consequence whether the book he transcribed would be finished in one or in ten years. It was required only that he should keep at his work steadily and do his best. His skill is more to be commended than his taste. Many of his initials and borders were outrageously inappropriate for the text for which they were designed. The gravest truths were hedged in the most childish conceits. Angels, butterflies, goblins, clowns, birds, snails and monkeys, sometimes in artistic, but much oftener in grotesque and sometimes in highly offensive positions are to be found in the illuminated borders of copies of the gospels and writings of the fathers.  \"The book was bound by the forwarder, who sewed the leaves and put them in a cover of leather or velvet; by the finisher, who ornamented the cover with gilding and enamel. The illustration of book binding, published by Amman in his Book of Trades, puts before us many of the implements still in use. The forwarder, with his customary apron of leather, is in the foreground, making use of a plow-knife for trimming the edges of a book. The lying press, which rests obliquely against the block before him, contains a book that has received the operation of backing-up from a queer shaped hammer lying upon the floor. The workman at the end of the room is sewing together the sections of a book, for sewing was properly regarded as a man's work, and a scientific operation altogether beyond the capacity of the raw seamstress. The work of the finisher is not represented, but the brushes, the burnishers, the sprinklers and the wheel-shaped gilding tools hanging against the wall leave us no doubt as to their use. There is an air of antiquity about everything connected with this bookbindery which suggests the thought that its tools and usages are much older than those of printing. Chevillier says that seventeen professional bookbinders found regular employment in making up books for the University of Paris, as early as 1292. Wherever books were produced in quantities, bookbinding was set apart as a business distinct from that of copying.  \"The poor students who copied books for their own use were also obliged to bind them, which they did in a simple but efficient manner by sewing together the folded sheets, attaching them to narrow parchment bands, the ends of which were made to pass through a cover of stout parchment at the joint near the back. The ends of the bands were then pasted down under the stiffening sheet of the cover, and the book was pressed. Sometimes the cover was made flexible by the omission of the stiffening sheet; sometimes the edges of the leaves were protected by flexible and overhanging flaps which were made to project over the covers; or by the insertion in the covers of stout leather strings with which the two covers were tied together. Ornamentation was entirely neglected, for a book of this character was made for use and not for show. These methods of binding were mostly applied to small books intended for the pocket; the workmanship was rough, but the binding was strong and serviceable.\"  The book of Mr. Merryweather, here reprinted, is thought worthy of preservation in a series designed for the library of the booklover. Its publication followed shortly after that of the works of Digby and Maitland, but shows much original research and familiarity with early authorities; and it is much more than either of these, or of any book with which we are acquainted, a plea in defense of bibliomania in the middle ages. Indeed the charm of the book may be said to rest largely upon the earnestness with which he takes up his self-imposed task. One may fancy that after all he found it not an easy one; in fact his \"Conclusion\" is a kind of apology for not having made out a better case. But this he believes he has proven, \"that with all their superstition, with all their ignorance, their blindness to philosophic light--the monks of old were hearty lovers of books; that they encouraged learning, fostered it, and transcribed repeatedly the books which they had rescued from the destruction of war and time; and so kindly cherished and husbanded them as intellectual food for posterity. Such being the case, let our hearts look charitably upon them; and whilst we pity them for their superstition, or blame them for their pious frauds, love them as brother men and workers in the mines of literature.\"  Of the author himself little can be learned. A diligent search revealed little more than the entry in the London directory which, in various years from 1840 to 1850, gives his occupation as that of bookseller, at 14 King Street, Holborn. Indeed this is shown by the imprint of the title-page of _Bibliomania_, which was published in 1849. He published during the same year _Dies Dominicæ_, and in 1850 _Glimmerings in the Dark_, and _Lives and Anecdotes of Misers_. The latter has been immortalized by Charles Dickens as one of the books bought at the bookseller's shop by Boffin, the Golden Dustman, and which was read to him by the redoubtable Silas Wegg during Sunday evenings at \"Boffin's Bower.\"[6]  FOOTNOTES:  [1] Hallam, Henry. \"Introduction to the Literature of Europe.\" 4     vols.

CHAPTER I.       _Introductory Remarks--Monachism--Book Destroyers--Effects of the      Reformation on Monkish Learning, etc._   In recent times, in spite of all those outcries which have been so repeatedly raised against the illiterate state of the dark ages, many and valuable efforts have been made towards a just elucidation of those monkish days. These labors have produced evidence of what few anticipated, and some even now deny, viz., that here and there great glimmerings of learning are perceivable; and although debased, and often barbarous too, they were not quite so bad as historians have usually proclaimed them. It may surprise some, however, that an attempt should be made to prove that, in the olden time in \"merrie Englande,\" a passion which Dibdin has christened Bibliomania, existed then, and that there were many cloistered bibliophiles as warm and enthusiastic in book collecting as the Doctor himself. But I must here crave the patience of the reader, and ask him to refrain from denouncing what he may deem a rash and futile attempt, till he has perused the volume and thought well upon the many facts contained therein. I am aware that many of these facts are known to all, but some, I believe, are familiar only to the antiquary--the lover of musty parchments and the cobwebbed chronicles of a monastic age. I have endeavored to bring these facts together--to connect and string them into a continuous narrative, and to extract from them some light to guide us in forming an opinion on the state of literature in those ages of darkness and obscurity; and here let it be understood that I merely wish to give a fact as history records it. I will not commence by saying the Middle Ages were dark and miserably ignorant, and search for some poor isolated circumstance to prove it; I will not affirm that this was pre-eminently the age in which real piety flourished and literature was fondly cherished, and strive to find all those facts which show its learning, purposely neglecting those which display its unlettered ignorance: nor let it be deemed ostentation when I say that the literary anecdotes and bookish memoranda now submitted to the reader have been taken, where such a course was practicable, from the original sources, and the references to the authorities from whence they are derived have been personally consulted and compared.  That the learning of the Middle Ages has been carelessly represented there can be little doubt: our finest writers in the paths of history have employed their pens in denouncing it; some have allowed difference of opinion as regards ecclesiastical policy to influence their conclusions; and because the poor scribes were monks, the most licentious principles, the most dismal ignorance and the most repulsive crimes have been attributed to them. If the monks deserved such reproaches from posterity, they have received no quarter; if they possessed virtues as christians, and honorable sentiments as men,"]]]
