M. Collin de Plancy says that this “palace mayor” of France was not called “Martel” because he _martelé_ (“hammered”) the Saracens under Abd-el-Rahman in 732, but because his patron saint was _Martellus_ (or _St. Martin_).--_Bibliothèque des Légendes._  Thomas Delf, in his translation of Chevreuil’s _Principles of Harmony, etc., of Colors_ (1847), signs himself “Charles Martel.”   =Martext= (_Sir Oliver_), a vicar in Shakespeare’s comedy of _As You Like It_ (1600).   =Martha:=      “Yea, Lord!

Scott, _Redgauntlet_ (time, George III.).  _Martin_ (_Sarah_), the prison reformer of Great Yarmouth. This young woman, though but a poor dressmaker, conceived a device for the reformation of prisoners in her native town, and continued for twenty-four years her earnest and useful labor of love, acting as schoolmistress, chaplain and industrial superintendent. In 1835, Captain Williams, inspector of prisons, brought her plans before the Government, under the conviction that the nation at large might be benefitted by their practical good sense (1791-1843).   =Martin Weldeck=, the miner.

Carker, manager in the firm of Dombey and Son, seduced her, and both she and her mother determined on revenge.

A man with two healthy, functioning hearts.\"  \"All right,\" Rhoda asked wonderingly. \"What do we do about it?\"  \"We go home for the time being, baby--to your nice, private, wonderful apartment.\"  \"And ...?\"  \"We make love,\" he said absently.         *       *       *       *       *  Les King, the free-lance news photographer, surveyed his night's work and was not happy. It had been singularly unproductive. A couple of sneak necking shots he'd snapped during a stroll through Central Park had come through a little too pornographic to be of value. Les threw them into the wastebasket. A shot of a man leaning out of a thirtieth-floor window came to nothing because the man had pulled his head in and closed the window. He hadn't jumped. There was a picture of a girl dodging a taxi. He'd caught her with both feet off the ground and a look of surprise on her face, but with her body arced backward and both hands on her rump as though she'd just been thoroughly and expertly goosed. Too vulgar. He put the pic aside.  And the Park Avenue hit? Here it was, a shot of a guy lying where he'd dropped, with the pigeon's rocketing away. Not bad, but it lacked an angle. All that intern had found on him was a name. William Matson. No address. The hell with it.  Les sighed and dropped the pic into his file case. Then he stopped. His face went blank. He pulled the pic out and looked at it again. He felt as if some nagging thought were trying to come to the surface, but nothing clicked, so he dropped the pic back into the file and went to the cooler where he opened an early-morning can of beer before sacking out. A hell of a life, he thought, wandering through nighttime Manhattan watching for people to take their mental pants down so he could get shots of their naked inner backsides.  He finished the beer and went in to take a shower.  Funny about that hit case. The guy had the damnedest expression on his face. Kind of like he was thinking, _Okay, so what do I do now?_  Fifteen minutes later, Les was asleep.         *       *       *       *       *  There was always a certain tension involved in Frank Corson's visits to Rhoda Kane's apartment, with Rhoda usually slightly on edge, waiting for one of Frank's outbursts.  An outburst consisted of his suddenly springing to his feet with a scowl and announcing: \"Goddamn it, I don't belong here!\"  Rhoda always followed the same script at the beginning of these traumas by inevitably asking, \"Why, darling? Why must you say that?\"  \"Oh, hell, Rhoda! I don't want to hurt you but--\"  \"Darling, you know I'll go to your room with you if you'd be more comfortable there.\"  He strode to the window angrily and, for Rhoda, there was that indescribably sweet and exciting reaction she always got from his nakedness. _Like a Greek god standing there, she thought_, and it thrilled her even though she knew she was being a little subjective about it.  She smiled with tender, understanding amusement as she realized Frank's pattern never varied. His outbursts never came until the first fierce need of her had been assuaged; this was to her liking because her need was as great.  Reacting according to current, \"broad-minded\" thinking and Manhattan sophistication, she regarded herself and Frank as having a \"good physical relationship.\" Which individual need was the greatest, she had never been able to say. But there certainly was something extraordinary about it. In analyzing it, she'd arrived at the conclusion that they'd been able, on the basis of personal rapport, to function in a completely uninhibited manner; thus, some of their love-making, when lifted out of context and surveyed objectively, might have been called abnormal. Rhoda did not think so, however; or, if she did, she blocked the idea successfully by telling herself that whatever she and Frank did together was all right because _they_ did it. She told herself it was good for them because they looked at it with a healthy attitude.  She could, of course, have gotten this opinion, or one in complete opposition to it, from two different psychologists, but she preferred to play it as she saw it.  She had wondered at times just how important the sex relation was in her attachment to Frank. It was of major importance, of that she was sure, but was it the key? If they drifted apart physically, would the other aspects of the relationship vanish? She thought not, but she certainly would not have been willing to put it to the test.  Frank Corson was through looking out the window now and he began pacing nervously. \"Sure--so it's fine to be a doctor. It's the sure-fire answer for later in life. But what about now? What about this crawling up the ladder inch by inch?\" He turned on her defiantly.  \"Living on your money!\"  \"You aren't!\"  \"All right. Maybe not technically.\" He looked around the room resentfully. \"Using your apartment for--\"  \"Frank! When I have guests, do they hesitate because my apartment is nicer than--?\"  She knew she'd hurt him even before his head came around and his eyes narrowed. \"So that's what it really is to you!\"  She'd said the wrong thing, but even as she sprang up from the bed she felt that it made no difference because he would have found something else. \"I didn't mean it that way. You know I didn't.\"  She ran to him and laid her hands on his chest; his eyes traveled down her naked body and his mind struggled. His expression said it was a little unfair of her to come so close and stand that way, nude and beautiful and eager, in front of him, especially when he had a point to make.  \"I'm a pauper trying to keep up with the rich.\"  She knew how to break his mood now. She smiled and pressed against him lightly and said, \"Uh-huh, but what a pauper. And darling, money wouldn't change that part of it a bit.\"  He drew her to him violently. The impact of their bodies hurt her ribs but she gloried in the pain. She let her knees weaken and sank to the thickly carpeted floor, bringing him down with her.  She knew Frank's outburst was over--at least for that day.  Later, on the bed, he opened his eyes sleepily. \"What time is it?\"  \"A little after ten.\"  \"That gives us almost two more hours.\" He looked out over the East River. \"It's beautiful.\"  \"_Isn't_ it?\"  \"If I went right into research--took a job somewhere--I could afford to give this to you.\"  She thought of saying, _But, darling, I've got it already_, and decided a change of subject would be more judicious and said, \"You _were_ kidding last night, weren't you?\"  \"Kidding?\"  \"About the man with two hearts.\"  Frank grinned a little sheepishly. He was extremely handsome and totally unconscious of it, and when he grinned that way it made him look like a little boy caught stealing jam, and Rhoda always wanted to hug him. But she forebore as he said, \"It does seem a little silly, doesn't it?\"  \"You'd know more about that than I do. Is it silly?\"  \"Let's say the chances of such a thing happening are rather remote.\"  \"You only used your stethoscope last night?\"  \"That was all. I went by what I heard.\"  \"What will you do now? X-ray?\"  \"I'm not sure I'll do anything. The idea is so preposterous.\"  She regarded him thoughtfully. \"It's not like you to lose interest in anything until you know the answer.\"  He snubbed out his cigarette. \"Let's forget Park Hill and funny anatomies, baby. Let's sit on the terrace and bathe ourselves in luxury the way the TV ad says.\"  And that was the way things stayed for two hours. The time passed swiftly, and when Frank was finally dressed and ready for the street, he refused Rhoda's offer to drive him to the hospital because she was very late, too. He kissed her good-bye, went down the twelve floors in the elevator, and hurried out of the building.  There was no cab in sight and he began to walk. Half a block later he turned a corner and stopped dead. He was facing a man who was coming in the other direction. He stared. The man stared back. Frank automatically stepped aside, but the man did exactly the same thing, at the same time, and they did a little dance there on the sidewalk. Then the man veered around him and moved on up the street. Frank turned and stared after him, then walked slowly in his own direction.  It was the same man. It was the Park Avenue hit. It was the man he'd left in Ward Five with a broken leg. It wasn't a brother or a cousin or a chance resemblance. It was the man himself or an exact double. And what were the percentages against attending a patient one night and meeting his exact double on the street the next morning?  They were fantastic. Like hitting the Irish sweeps.  It was the man. It had to be.  Except that he wasn't broken-legged now. He was walking across the Upper East Side, wearing that same look that was as good as anyone else's, except that you got the impression of an emptiness behind his eyes.     2   Those in the know in Washington, D.C., upon seeing Brent Taber rush to a taxi or dodge a pedestrian on Pennsylvania Avenue, could well say, \"There walks power.\" But there were few indeed who possessed enough knowledge of the Washington inner structure to be able to make this observation.  Brent looked more like a coal heaver than a public servant with a well-oiled escalator into the White House. He appeared more able to direct a gang of dock workers than to jockey a delicate issue through the bloody jungle of national politics. Many of the people who accepted this deception did so at their peril and were not around any more. To others not so foolish, Brent Taber symbolized a completely necessary facet of a working democracy--secret government. This necessity sprang from the realization that even an open society must maintain areas of privacy or it is doomed.  Such was the man, and such was his mission of the moment--an"]]]
