There is an interesting remark about \"the creature called carcinium\" (hermit-crab), that it \"resembles both the Malacostraca and the Testacea, for this in its nature is similar to the animals that are like carabi, and it is born naked\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 85). In the last phrase we may perhaps read the first recognition of the embryological criterion.  With the recognition of unity of plan within each group necessarily goes the recognition of what later morphology calls the homology of parts. The parts of a horse can be compared one by one with the parts of another viviparous quadruped; in all the animals belonging to the same class the parts are the same, only they differ in excess or defect--these remarks are placed in the forefront of the _Historia Animalium_. Generally speaking, parts which bear the same name are for Aristotle homologous throughout the class. But he goes further and notes the essential resemblance underlying the differences of certain parts. He classes together nails and claws, the spines of the hedgehog, and hair, as being homologous structures. He says that teeth are allied to bones, whereas horns are more nearly allied to skin (_Hist. Anim._, iii.). This is an astonishingly happy guess, considering that all he had to go upon was the observation that in black animals the horns are black but the teeth white. One cannot but admire the way in which Aristotle fixes upon apparently trivial and commonplace facts, and draws from them far-reaching consequences. He often goes wrong, it is true, but he always errs in the grand manner.  While Aristotle certainly recognised the existence of homologies, and even had a feeling for them, he did not clearly distinguish homology from analogy. He comes pretty near the distinction in the following passage. After explaining that in animals belonging to the same class the parts are the same, differing only in excess or defect, he says, \"But some animals agree with each other in their parts neither in form nor in excess and defect, but have only an analogous likeness, such as a bone bears to a spine, a nail to a hoof, a hand to a crab's claw, the scale of a fish to the feather of a bird, for that which is a feather in the bird is a scale in the fish\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 2). One of these comparisons is, however, a homology not an analogy, and the last phrase throws a little doubt upon the whole question, for it is not made clear whether it is position or function that determines what are equivalent organs.  In the _De Partibus Animalium_ there occurs the following passage:--\"Groups that only differ in degree, and in the more or less of an identical element that they possess, are aggregated under a single class; groups whose attributes are not identical but analogous are separated. For instance, bird differs from bird by gradation, or by excess and defect; some birds have long feathers, others short ones, but all are feathered. Bird and Fish are more remote and only agree in having analogous organs; for what in the bird is feather, in the fish is scale. Such analogies can scarcely, however, serve universally as indications for the formation of groups, for almost all animals present analogies in their corresponding parts.\"[8] It is thus similarity in form and structure which determines the formation of the main groups. Within each group the parts differ only in degree, in largeness or smallness, softness and hardness, smoothness or roughness, and the like (_loc. cit._, i., 4, 644^b). These passages show that Aristotle had some conception of homology as distinct from analogy. He did not, however, develop the idea. What Aristotle sought in the variety of animal structure, and what he found, were not homologies, but rather communities of function, parts with the same attributes. His interest was all in _organs_, in functioning parts, not in the mere spatial relationship of parts.  This comes out clearly in his treatise _On the Parts of Animals_, which is subsequent to, and the complement of, his _History of Animals_. The latter is a description of the variety of animal form, the former is a treatise on the functions of the parts. He describes the plan of the _De Partibus Animalium_ as follows:--\"We have, then, first to describe the common functions, common, that is, to the whole animal kingdom, or to certain large groups, or to members of a species. In other words, we have to describe the attributes common to all animals, or to assemblages, like the class of Birds, of closely allied groups differentiated by gradation, or to groups like Man not differentiated into subordinate groups. In the first case the common attributes may be called analogous, in the second generic, in the third specific\" (i, 5, 645^b, trans. Ogle). The alimentary canal is a good example of a part which is \"analogous\" throughout the animal kingdom, for \"all animals possess in common those parts by which they take in food, and into which they receive it\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 6).  The _De Partibus Animalium_ becomes in form a comparative organography, but the emphasis is always on function and community of function. Thus he treats of bone, \"fish-spine,\" and cartilage together (_De Partibus_, ii., 9, 655^a), because they have the same function, though he says elsewhere that they are only analogous structures (ii., 8, 653^b). In the same connection he describes also the supporting tissues of Invertebrates--the hard exoskeleton of Crustacea and Insects, the shell of Testacea, the \"bone\" of _Sepia_ (ii., 8, 654^a). Aristotle took much more interest in analogies, in organs of similar function, than in homologies. He did recognise the existence of homologies, but rather _malgré lui_, because the facts forced it upon him.  His only excursion into the realm of \"transcendental anatomy\" is his comparison of a Cephalopod to a doubled-up Vertebrate whose legs have become adherent to its head, whose alimentary canal has doubled upon itself in such a way as to bring the anus near the mouth (_De Partibus_, iv., 9, 684^b). It is clear, however, that Aristotle did not seek to establish by this comparison any true homologies of parts, but merely analogies, thus avoiding the error into which Meyranx and Laurencet fell more than two thousand years later in their paper communicated to the Académie des Sciences, which formed the starting-point of the famous controversy between Cuvier and E. Geoffroy St Hilaire (see Chap. V., below).  Moreover, Aristotle did not so much compare a Cephalopod with a doubled-up Vertebrate as contrast Cephalopods (and also Testacea) with all other animals. Other animals have their organs in a straight line; Cephalopods and Testacea alone show this peculiar doubling up of the body.  (4) Aristotle was much struck with certain facts of correlation, of the interdependence of two organs which are not apparently in functional dependence on one another. Such correlation may be positive or negative; the presence of one organ may either entail the presence of the other, or it may entail its absence. Aristotle has various ways of explaining facts of correlation. He observed that no animal has both tusks and horns, but this fact could easily be explained on the principle that Nature never makes anything superfluous or in vain. If an animal is protected by the possession of tusks it does not require horns, and _vice versa_. The correlation of a multiple stomach with deficient development of the teeth (as in Ruminants) is accounted for by saying that the animal needs its complex stomach to make up for the shortcomings of its teeth! (_De Partibus_, iii., 14, 674^b.) Other examples of correlation were not susceptible of this explanation in terms of final causes. He lays stress on the fact, in the main true, of the inverse development of horns and front teeth in the upper jaw, exemplified in Ruminants. He explains the fact in this way. Teeth and horns are formed from earthy matter in the body and there is not enough to form both teeth and horns, so \"Nature by subtracting from the teeth adds to the horns; the nutriment which in most animals goes to the former being here spent on the augmentation of the latter\" (_De Partibus_, iii., 2, 664^a, trans. Ogle). A similar kind of explanation is offered of the fact that Selachia have cartilage instead of bone, \"in these Selachia Nature has used all the earthy matter on the skin [_i.e._, on the placoid scales]; and she is unable to allot to many different parts one and the same superfluity of material\" (_De Partibus_, ii., 9, 655^a, trans. Ogle). Speaking generally, \"Nature invariably gives to one part what she subtracts from another\" (_loc. cit._, ii., 14, 658^a).  This thought reappears again in the 19th century in E. Geoffroy St Hilaire's _loi de balancement_ and also in Goethe's writings on morphology. For Aristotle it meant that Nature was limited by the nature of her means, that finality was limited by necessity. Thus in the larger animals there is an excess of earthy matter, as a necessary result of the material nature of the animal; this excess is turned by Nature to good account, but there is not enough to serve both for teeth and for horns (_loc. cit._, iii., 2, 663^b).  But there are other instances of correlation which seem to have taxed even Aristotle's ingenuity beyond its powers. Thus he knew that all animals (meaning viviparous quadrupeds) with no front teeth in the upper jaw have cotyledons on their foetal membranes, and that most animals which have front teeth in both jaws and no horns have no cotyledons (_De Generatione_, ii., 7). He offers no explanation of this, but accepts it as a fact.  We may conveniently refer here to one or two other ideas of Aristotle regarding the causes of form. He makes the profound remark that the possible range of form of an organ is limited to some extent by its existing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20432"],["title","Young Captain Jack; Or, The Son of a Soldier (#1)"],["body","getting the worst of the fighting lately. I wonder what would happen if the South should be beaten in this struggle?\"  Ten minutes passed, when a merry whistle was heard on the road and another boy appeared, of about Jack's age.  \"Hullo, Darcy!\" cried Jack. \"Come to help me fish?\"  \"I didn't know you were fishing,\" answered Darcy Gilbert, a youth who lived on the plantation next to Jack. \"Are you having good luck?\"  \"First-rate. I was getting ready to go home, but now you have come I'll stay a while longer.\"  \"Do, Jack; I hate to fish alone. But I say, Jack----\" And then Darcy broke off short.  \"What were you going to say?\"  \"Oh, nothing!\"  There was a minute of silence, during which Darcy baited his hook and threw it in.  \"You look as if you had something on your mind. Darcy,\" went on Jack, after his friend had brought in a fine haul apparently without appreciating the sport. \"Did you meet a Confederate surgeon on the road?\"  \"No, I came across the plantation. What of him?\"  \"He came this way, and we got into a regular row because I wouldn't clear right out and give him the whole of the bridge.\"  \"He didn't hit you, did he?\"  \"Not much! If he had I would have pitched into him, I can tell you, big as he was!\" And Jack's eyes flashed in a way that proved he meant what he said.  \"No, I didn't meet him, but I met St. John Ruthven, your cousin. Jack, do you know that that young man is a regular bully, even if he is a dandy?\"  \"Yes, I know it, Darcy.\"  \"And he is down on you.\"  \"I know that too. But why he dislikes me I don't know, excepting that I don't like to see him paying his addresses to my sister Marion. Marion is too good for such a man.\"  \"Is he paying his addresses to her?\"  \"Well, he is with her every chance he can get.\"  \"Does Marion like him?\"  \"Oh! I reckon she does in a way. He is always so nice to her--much nicer than he has ever been to me.\"  \"Has he ever spoken to you about yourself?\" went on Darcy Gilbert, with a peculiar look at Jack.  \"Oh, yes! often.\"  \"I mean about--well, about your past?\" went on Darcy, with some confusion.  \"My past, Darcy? What is wrong about my past?\"  \"Nothing, I hope. But I didn't like what St. John Ruthven said about you.\"  \"But what did he say?\"  \"I don't know as I ought to tell you. I didn't believe him.\"  \"But I want to know what he did say?\" demanded Jack, throwing down his fishing pole and coming up close to his friend.  \"Well, if you must know, Jack, he said you were a nobody, that you didn't belong to the Ruthven family at all, and that you would have to go away some day,\" was the answer, which filled Jack with consternation.     CHAPTER II.  DARCY GILBERT'S STORY.   \"He said I didn't belong to the Ruthven family?\" said Jack slowly, when he felt able to speak.  \"He did, and I told him I didn't believe him.\"  \"But--but--I don't understand you, Darcy. Am I not Jack Ruthven, the son of the late Colonel Martin Ruthven?\"  \"He says not.\"  \"What! Does he mean to say that my mother isn't my mother at all?\" ejaculated Jack, with wide-open eyes.  \"That's it exactly, and he added that Marion wasn't your sister.\"  \"I'll--I'll punch his head for that!\" was the quick return.  \"I felt like doing that, too, Jack, even though he is so much older than either of us. I told him he was a mean fellow and that I wouldn't believe him under oath.\"  \"But how did it all come about?\"  \"Oh, it started at the boathouse back of Old Ben's place. He wanted to bully me, and I told him I wouldn't let him lord it over me any more than you let him bully you. That got him started, for it seems he was sore over the fact that you took Marion out for a boatride one afternoon when he wanted her to go along with him on horseback. One word brought on another, and at last he said he reckoned you would have to clear out some day--that you were only a low upstart anyway, with no real claim on the Ruthvens.\"  \"He said that, did he?\" Jack drew a long breath and set his teeth hard. \"Did he try to prove his words?\"  \"I didn't give him a chance. I was so upset I merely told him I didn't believe him, and came away.\"  \"And where did he go?\"  \"He started off toward town.\"  \"When he comes back I'm going to find out the truth of this matter.\"  \"I don't believe his story, Jack, and I wouldn't worry myself about it.\"  \"But supposing it were true, Darcy--that I was a--a--nobody, as he says?\"  \"I should think just as much of you,\" answered the other lad quickly.  \"Thank you for that.\"  \"St. John always talks too much--don't mind him.\"  \"But I shall. If he tells the truth I want to know it--and, if not, I shall take steps to make him take back the stories he is circulating.\"  \"It's a wonder he hasn't gone to the war. Why doesn't he enlist, like the rest of the young men in this neighborhood?\"  \"He says he must stay with his mother. But the real reason is, I think, that he is a coward.\"  \"Perhaps you are right. I remember once, when there was a cry of mad dog in the town, he hid in a warehouse and was almost scared to death.\"  \"Yes, I remember that, and I remember, too, when Big Bill, the slave, ran away and threatened to kill the first white man he met, St. John hid in the mansion and didn't come outside the door for a week.\"  \"Such a coward wouldn't be above circulating falsehoods.\"  \"I wish I knew just where to find him. I would have it out with him in short order,\" concluded Jack.  The youth was in no humor for further fishing and soon wound up his line and started for home.  As he passed along over the plantation road his thoughts were busy. Could there be any truth in what St. John Ruthven had said? Was he really a nobody, with no claim upon the lady he called mother and the girl he looked upon as his sister? A chill passed down his backbone, and, as he came in sight of the stately old mansion that he called home, he paused to wipe the cold perspiration from his forehead.  \"I will go to mother and ask her the truth,\" he told himself. \"I can't wait to find out in any other way.\" Yet the thought of facing that kind-hearted lady was not a pleasant one. How should he begin to tell her of what was in his mind?  \"Is my mother in?\" he asked of the maid whom he met in the hallway.  \"No, Massah Jack, she dun went to town,\" was the answer of the colored girl.  \"Did she say when she would be back?\"  \"No, sah.\"  \"Do you know if my sister is around?\"  \"She dun gone off not five minutes ago, Massah Jack.\"  \"Where to?\"  \"I heard her say she was gwine down to Ole Ben's boathouse. I 'spect she dun t'ought yo' was dar.\"  Jack said no more, but giving the colored girl the fish, to take around to the cook, he ran upstairs, washed and brushed up, and sallied forth to find Marion.  The boathouse which had been mentioned was an old affair, standing upon the shore of a wide bay overlooking the Atlantic ocean. It belonged to a colored man called \"Old Ben,\" a fellow who had once been a slave on the Ruthven plantation.  As Jack approached it he saw Marion sitting on a bench in the shade, with a book in her lap. Instead of reading, however, the girl was gazing out to sea in a meditative way.  \"Marion, I was looking for you.\"  \"Oh, Jack! is that you? I thought you had gone fishing for the day.\"  \"I just got home, after catching a pretty good mess. Want to go rowing with me?\"  \"Yes, I'd like that very much. I was wishing you or Old Ben would come.\"  \"Or, perhaps, St. John?\" said Jack inquiringly.  \"No; I didn't wish for him, you tease.\"  \"I am glad of it, Marion. I don't want you to give me up for St. John.\"  \"I do not intend to, Jack. But why are you looking so serious. Have you anything on your mind? I never saw you look so thoughtful before.\"  \"Yes, I have a lot on my mind, Marion. Come, I'll tell you when we are out on the bay.\"  A rowboat was handy and oars were in the rack in the boathouse, and soon the pair were out on the water. Although but a boy, Jack took to the water naturally and handled the oars as skillfully as the average sailor.  When they were about halfway across the bay he ceased rowing and looked earnestly at the girl before him.  \"Marion, I want to find out--that is, I've got some questions to ask,\" he blurted out. \"I don't know how to go at it.\"  \"Why, what in the world is the matter, Jack? You were red a moment ago. Now you are as pale as a sheet.\"  \"I want to know about something awfully important.\"  \"I'm sure I cannot imagine what it is.\"  \"Marion, aren't we real sister and brother?\"  The question was out at last, and as he asked it his eyes dropped, for he had not the courage to look into her face. He felt her start and give a shiver.  \"Oh, Jack! what put that in your head,\" she said slowly.  \"Never mind that. Tell me, are we real sister and brother or not?\"  \"Jack, we are not.\"  \"Oh, Marion!\" The words almost choked him, and for the moment he could say no more.  \"We are not real sister and brother, Jack, but to me you will always be as a real brother,\" and Marion caught his hand and held it tightly.  \"And--and mother isn't my--my real mother?\" he faltered.  \"No, Jack; she is only your foster mother. But she thinks just as much of you as if you were her real son. She has told me that over and over again.\"  \"You are sure of this?\"  \"Yes, Jack.\"  \"Sure I am a--a nobody.\" His voice sunk to a mere whisper.  \"Yon are not a nobody, Jack. When you were a mere boy of three or four my father and mother adopted you, and you are now John Ruthven, my own brother,\" and she gave his brown hand another tight squeeze.  He was too confused and bewildered to answer at once. The dreadful news was true, he was not really a Ruthven. He was a nobody--no, he must be _somebody_. But who was he?     CHAPTER III.  A MYSTERY OF THE PAST.   \"I do not know that I have done just right by telling you this,\" went on Marion. \"Mother may not approve of it.\"  \"I am glad you told me. I was bound to find out about it, sooner or later.\"  \"That is true, Jack. But both mother and I dreaded that time. We were afraid you might turn from us. And we both love "]]]
