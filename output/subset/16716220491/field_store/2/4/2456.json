My groom shall drive you over to Hunston.\"  Captain Ripon returned with his groom to Netherwood, and set all the children searching the gorse, copses, and hedges near the common, by the promise of ten shillings reward, if they found the missing fowls. Half an hour later, the gypsies struck their tents, loaded the van, and went off.  Late that afternoon, the ten missing fowls were discovered in a small copse by the wayside, half a mile from the common, on the road to Captain Ripon's park.  \"I cannot bring your fowls back to life, Emma,\" that gentleman said, when he returned home, \"but I have got the thief. It was one of the gypsies on Netherwood Common. We found two of the fowls in their pot. No doubt they thought that they would have plenty of time to get their dinner before anyone came, even if suspicion fell on them; and they have hidden the rest away somewhere, but I expect that we shall find them.  \"They had burnt all the feathers, as they thought; but I found a breast feather of a Spangled Dorking, and that was enough for me to give them in custody. Then, when it came to the question of boots, the thief found it no good to deny it, any longer.\"  That evening, Captain Ripen was told that a woman wished to speak to him and, on going out into the hall, he saw a gypsy of some thirty years of age.  \"I have come, sir, to beg you not to appear against my husband.\"  \"But, my good woman, I see no reason why I should not do so. If he had only stolen a couple of common fowls, for a sick wife or child, I might have been inclined to overlook it--for I am not fond of sending men to prison--but to steal a dozen valuable fowls, for the pot, is a little too much. Besides, the matter has gone too far, now, for me to retract, even if I wished to--which I certainly do not.\"  \"He is a good husband, sir.\"  \"He may be,\" Captain Ripon said, \"though that black eye you have got does not speak in his favor But that has nothing to do with it. Matters must take their course.\"  The woman changed her tone.  \"I have asked you fairly, sir; and it will be better for you if you don't prosecute Reuben.\"  \"Oh, nonsense, my good woman! Don't let me have any threats, or it will be worse for you.\"  \"I tell you,\" the woman exclaimed, fiercely, \"it will be the worse for you, if you appear against my Reuben.\"  \"There, go out,\" Captain Ripon said, opening the front door of the hall. \"As if I cared for your ridiculous threats! Your husband will get what he deserves--five years, if I am not mistaken.\"  \"You will repent this,\" the gypsy said, as she passed out.  Captain Ripon closed the door after her, without a word.  \"Well, who was it?\" his wife inquired, when he returned to the drawing room.  \"An insolent gypsy woman, wife of the man who stole the fowls. She had the impudence to threaten me, if I appeared against him.\"  \"Oh, Robert!\" the young wife exclaimed, apprehensively, \"what could she do? Perhaps you had better not appear.\"  \"Nonsense, my dear!\" her husband laughed. \"Not appear, because an impudent gypsy woman has threatened me? A nice magistrate I should be! Why, half the fellows who are committed swear that they will pay off the magistrate, some day; but nothing ever comes of it. Here, we have been married six months, and you are wanting me to neglect my duty; especially when it is your pet fowls which have been stolen.  \"Why, at the worst, my dear,\" he went on, seeing that his wife still looked pale, \"they could burn down a tick or two, on a windy night in winter and, to satisfy you, I will have an extra sharp lookout kept in that direction, and have a watchdog chained up near them.  \"Come, my love, it is not worth giving a second thought about; and I shall not tell you about my work on the bench, if you are going to take matters to heart like this.\"  The winter came and went, and the ricks were untouched, and Captain Ripon forgot all about the gypsy's threats. At the assizes a previous conviction was proved against her husband, and he got five years penal servitude and, after the trial was over, the matter passed out of the minds of both husband and wife.  They had, indeed, other matters to think about for, soon after Christmas, a baby boy was born, and monopolized the greater portion of his mother's thoughts. When, in due time, he was taken out for walks, the old women of the village--perhaps with an eye to presents from the Park--were unanimous in declaring that he was the finest boy ever seen, and the image both of his father and mother.  He certainly was a fine baby; and his mother lamented sorely over the fact that he had a dark blood mark, about the size of a three-penny piece, upon his shoulder. Her husband, however, consoled her by pointing out that--as it was a boy--the mark did not matter in the slightest; whereas--had it been a girl--the mark would have been a disfigurement, when she attained to the dignified age at which low dresses are worn.  \"Yes, of course, that would have been dreadful, Robert. Still, you know, it is a pity.\"  \"I really cannot see that it is even a pity, little woman; and it would have made no great difference if he had been spotted all over, like a leopard, so that his face and arms were free. The only drawback would have been he would have got some nickname or other, such as 'the Leopard,' or 'Spotty,' or something of that sort, when he went to bathe with his school fellows. But this little spot does not matter, in the slightest.  \"Some day or other Tom will laugh, when I tell him what a fuss you made over it.\"  Mrs. Ripon was silenced but, although she said nothing more about it, she was grieved in her heart at this little blemish on her boy; and lamented that it would spoil his appearance, when he began to run about in little short frocks; and she determined, at once, that he should wear long curls, until he got into jackets.  Summer, autumn, and winter came and passed. In the spring, Tom Ripon was toddling about; but he had not yet begun to talk, although his mother declared that certain incoherent sounds, which he made, were quite plain and distinct words; but her husband, while willing to allow that they might be perfectly intelligible to her, insisted that--to the male ear--they in no way resembled words.  \"But he ought to begin to talk, Robert,\" his wife urged. \"He is sixteen months old, now, and can run about quite well. He really ought to begin to talk.\"  \"He will talk, before long,\" her husband said, carelessly. \"Many children do not talk till they are eighteen months old, some not till they are two years. Besides, you say he does begin, already.\"  \"Yes, Robert, but not quite plainly.\"  \"No, indeed, not plainly at all,\" her husband laughed. \"Don't trouble, my dear, he will talk soon enough; and if he only talks as loud as he roars, sometimes, you will regret the hurry you have been in about it.\"  \"Oh, Robert, how can you talk so? I am sure he does not cry more than other children. Nurse says he is the best child she ever knew.\"  \"Of course she does, my dear; nurses always do. But I don't say he roars more than other children. I only say he roars, and that loudly; so you need not be afraid of there being anything the matter with his tongue, or his lungs.  \"What fidgets you young mothers are, to be sure!\"  \"And what heartless things you young fathers are, to be sure!\" his wife retorted, laughing. \"Men don't deserve to have children. They do not appreciate them, one bit.\"  \"We appreciate them, in our way, little woman; but it is not a fussy way. We are content with them as they are, and are not in any hurry for them to run, or to walk, or to cut their first teeth. Tom is a fine little chap, and I am very fond of him, in his way--principally, perhaps, because he is your Tom--but I cannot see that he is a prodigy.\"  \"He is a prodigy,\" Mrs. Ripon said, with a little toss of her head, \"and I shall go up to the nursery, to admire him.\"  So saying, she walked off with dignity; and Captain Ripon went out to look at his horses, and thought to himself what a wonderful dispensation of providence it was, that mothers were so fond of their babies.  \"I don't know what the poor little beggars would do,\" he muttered, \"if they had only their fathers to look after them; but I suppose we should take to it, just as the old goose in the yard has taken to that brood of chickens, whose mother was carried off by the fox.  \"By the way, I must order some wire netting. I forgot to write for it, yesterday.\"  Another two months. It was June, and now even Captain Ripon allowed that Tom could say \"Pa,\" and \"Ma,\" with tolerable distinctness; but as yet he had got no farther. He could now run about sturdily and, as the season was warm and bright, and Mrs. Ripon believed in fresh air, the child spent a considerable portion of his time in the garden.  One day his mother was out with him, and he had been running about for some time. Mrs. Ripon was picking flowers, for she had a dinner party that evening, and she enjoyed getting her flowers, and arranging her vases, herself. Presently she looked round, but Tom was missing. There were many clumps of ornamental shrubs on the lawn, and Mrs. Ripon thought nothing of his disappearance.  \"Tom,\" she called, \"come to mamma, she wants you,\" and went on with her work.  A minute or two passed.  \"Where is that little pickle?\" she said. \"Hiding, I suppose,\" and she went off in search.  Nowhere was Tom to be seen. She called loudly, and searched in the bushes.  \"He must have gone up to the house.  \"Oh, here comes nurse. Nurse, have you seen Master Tom? He has just run away,\" she called.  \"No, ma'am, I have seen nothing of him.\"  \"He must be about the garden then, somewhere. Look about, nurse. Where can the child have hidden itself?\"  Nurse and mother ran about, calling loudly the name of the missing child. Five minutes later Mrs. Ripon ran into the study, where her husband was going through his farm accounts.  \"Oh, Robert,\" she said, \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21979"],["title","For Name and Fame; Or, Through Afghan Passes (#2)"],["body","can't find Tom!\" and she burst into tears.  \"Not find Tom?\" her husband said, rising in surprise. \"Why, how long have you missed him?\"  \"He was out in the garden with me. I was picking flowers for the dinner table and, when I looked round, he was gone. Nurse and I have been looking everywhere, and calling, but we cannot find him.\"  \"Oh, he is all right,\" Captain Ripon said, cheerfully. \"Do not alarm yourself, little woman. He must have wandered into the shrubbery. We shall hear him howling, directly. But I will come and look for him.\"  No better success attended Captain Ripon's search than that which his wife had met with. He looked anxious, now. The gardeners and servants were called, and soon every place in the garden was ransacked.  \"He must have got through the gate, somehow, into the park,\" Captain Ripon said, hurrying in that direction. \"He certainly is not in the garden, or in any of the hothouses.\"  Some of the men had already gone in that direction. Presently Captain Ripon met one, running back.  \"I have been down to the gate, sir, and can see nothing of Master Tom; but in the middle of the drive, just by the clump of laurels by the gate, this boot was lying--just as if it had been put there on purpose, to be seen.\"  \"Nonsense!\" Captain Ripon said. \"What can that have to do with it?\"  Nevertheless he took the boot, and looked at it. It was a roughly-made, heavy boot, such as would be worn by a laboring man. He was about to throw it carelessly aside, and to proceed on his search, when he happened to turn it over. Then he started, as if struck.  \"Good Heaven!\" he exclaimed, \"it is the gypsy's.\"  Yes, he remembered it now. The man had pleaded not guilty, when brought up at the assizes, and the boot had been produced as evidence. He remembered it particularly because, after the man was sentenced, his wife had provoked a smile by asking that the boots might be given up to her; in exchange for a better pair for her husband to put on, when discharged from prison.  Yes, it was clear. The gypsy woman had kept her word, and had taken her revenge. She had stolen the child, and had placed the boot where it would attract attention, in order that the parents might know the hand that struck them.  Instantly Captain Ripon ran to the stable, ordered the groom to mount at once, and scour every road and lane; while he himself rode off to Hunston to give notice to the police, and offer a large reward for the child's recovery. He charged the man who had brought the boot to carry it away, and put it in a place of safety till it was required; and on no account to mention to a soul where he put it.  Before riding off he ran in to his wife, who was half wild with grief, to tell her that he was going to search outside the park; and that she must keep up her spirits for, no doubt, Tom would turn up all right, in no time.  He admitted to himself, however, as he galloped away, that he was not altogether sure that Tom would be so speedily recovered. The woman would never have dared to place the boot on the road, and so give a clue against herself, unless she felt very confident that she could get away, or conceal herself.  \"She has probably some hiding place, close by the park,\" he said to himself, \"where she will lie hid till night, and will then make across country.\"  He paused at the village, and set the whole population at work, by telling them that his child was missing--and had, he believed, been carried off by a gypsy woman--and that he would give fifty pounds to anyone who would find him. She could not be far off, as it was only about half an hour since the child had been missed.  Then he galloped to Hunston, set the police at work and, going to a printer, told him instantly to set up and strike off placards, offering five hundred pounds reward for the recovery of the child. This was to be done in an hour or two, and then taken to the police station for distribution throughout the country round. Having now done all in his power, Captain Ripon rode back as rapidly as he had come, in hopes that the child might already have been found.  No news had, however, been obtained of him, nor had anyone seen any strange woman in the neighborhood.  On reaching the house, he found his wife prostrated with grief and, in answer to her questions, he thought it better to tell her about the discovery of the boot.  \"We may be some little time, before we find the boy,\" he said; \"but we shall find him, sooner or later. I have got placards out already, offering five hundred pounds reward; and this evening I will send advertisements to all the papers in this and the neighboring counties.  \"Do not fret, darling. The woman has done it out of spite, no doubt; but she will not risk putting her neck in a noose, by harming the child. It is a terrible grief, but it will only be for a time. We are sure to find him before long.\"  Later in the evening, when Mrs. Ripon had somewhat recovered her composure, she said to her husband:  \"How strange are God's ways, Robert. How wicked and wrong in us to grumble! I was foolish enough to fret over that mark on the darling's neck, and now the thought of it is my greatest comfort. If it should be God's will that months or years should pass over, before we find him, there is a sign by which we shall always know him. No other child can be palmed off upon us, as our own. When we find Tom we shall know him, however changed he may be!\"  \"Yes, dear,\" her husband said, \"God is very good, and this trial may be sent us for the best. As you say, we can take comfort, now, from what we were disposed to think, at the time, a little cross. After that, dear, we may surely trust in God. That mark was placed there that we might know our boy again and, were it not decreed that we should again see him, that mark would have been useless.\"  The thought, for a time, greatly cheered Mrs. Ripon but, gradually, the hope that she should ever see her boy again faded away; and Captain Ripon became much alarmed at the manifest change in her health.  In spite of all Captain Ripon could do, no news was obtained of the gypsy, or Tom. For weeks he rode about the country, asking questions in every village; or hurried away to distant parts of England, where the police thought they had a clue.  It was all in vain. Every gypsy encampment in the kingdom was searched, but without avail; and even the police, sharp eyed as they are, could not guess that the decent-looking Irishwoman, speaking--when she did speak, which was seldom, for she was a taciturn woman--with a strong brogue, working in a laundry in a small street in the Potteries, Notting Hill, was the gypsy they were looking for; or that the little boy, whose father she said was at sea, was the child for whose discovery a thousand pounds was continually advertised.    Chapter 2: The Foundling.   It was a bitterly cold night in January. The wind was roaring across the flats and fens of Cambridgeshire, driving tiny flakes of snow before it. But few people had been about all day, and those whose business compelled them to face the weather had hurried along, muffled up to the chin. It was ten at night; and the porter and his wife at the workhouse, at Ely, had just gone to bed, when the woman exclaimed:  \"Sam, I hear a child crying.\"  \"Oh, nonsense!\" the man replied, drawing the bedclothes higher over his head. \"It is the wind; it's been whistling all day.\"  The woman was silent, but not convinced. Presently she sat up in bed.  \"I tell you, Sam, it's a child; don't you hear it, man? It's a child, outside the gate. On such a night as this, too. Get up, man, and see; if you won't, I will go myself.\"  \"Lie still, woman. It's all thy fancy.\"  \"You are a fool, Sam Dickson,\" his wife said, sharply. \"Do you think I have lived to the age of forty-five, and don't know a child's cry, when I hear it? Now are you going to get up, or am I?\"  With much grumbling, the porter turned out of bed, slipped on a pair of trousers and a greatcoat, took down the key from the wall, lighted a lantern, and went out. He opened the gate, and looked out. There was nothing to be seen; and he was about to close the gate again, with a curse on his wife's fancies, when a fresh cry broke on his ears. He hurried out now and, directed by the voice, found lying near the gate a child, wrapped in a dark-colored shawl, which had prevented him from seeing it at his first glance. There was no one else in sight.  Illustration: Sam Dickson finds little Willie Gale.  The man lifted his lantern above his head, and gave a shout. There was no answer. Then he raised the child and carried it in; locked the door, and entered the lodge.  \"You are right, for once,\" he said. \"Here is a child, and a pretty heavy one, too. It has been deserted by someone; and a heartless creature she must have been, for in another half hour it would have been frozen to death, if you had not heard it.\"  The woman was out of bed now.  \"It is a boy,\" she said, opening the shawl, \"about two years old, I should say.  \"Don't cry, my boy--don't cry.  \"It's half frozen, Sam. The best thing will be to put it into our bed, that has just got warm. I will warm it up a little milk. It's no use taking it into the ward, tonight.\"  Ten minutes later the child was sound asleep; the porter--who was a good-natured man--having gone over to sleep in an empty bed in the house, leaving the child to share his wife's bed.  In the morning the foundling opened its eyes and looked round. Seeing everything strange, it began to cry.  \"Don't cry, dear,\" the woman said. \"I will get you some nice breakfast, directly.\"  The kindness of tone at once pacified the child. It looked round.  \"Where's mother?\" he asked.  \"I don't know, dear. We shall find her soon enough, no doubt; don't you fret.\"  The child did not seem inclined to fret. On the contrary, he brightened up visibly.  \"Will she beat Billy, when she comes back?\"  \"No, my dear, she sha'n't beat you. Does she often beat you?\"  The child nodded its"]]]
