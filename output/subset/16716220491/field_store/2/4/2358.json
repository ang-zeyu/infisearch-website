Suddenly I seed two o' them carry Peter down to the beach, an' I saw, as they passed me, that he was quite dead.  In less time than I can count a hundred they took the skin off him, cut off his head, sewed up the hole, tied his arms and legs in a knot, blew him full o' wind till he was fit to bu'st, an' then hung him up to dry in the sun!  In fact, they made a _dan_ of him!\"  A loud shout of laughter greeted this startling conclusion.  In truth, we must do Massan the justice to say, that although he was much in the habit of amusing his companions by entertaining them with anecdotes which originated entirely in his own teeming fancy, he never actually _deceived_ them, but invariably, either by a sly glance or by the astounding nature of his communication, gave them to understand that he was dealing not with fact but fiction.  \"But seriously, lads,\" said Francois, whose intelligence, added to a grave, manly countenance and a tall, muscular frame, caused him to be regarded by his comrades as a sort of leader both in action and in council, \"what do you think of our bourgeois' plan?  For my part, I'm willing enough to go to any reasonable part o' the country where there are furs and Indians; but as for this Ungava, from what Massan says, there's neither Indians, nor furs, nor victuals--nothin' but rocks, and mountains, and eternal winter; and if we do get the Huskies about us, they'll very likely serve us as they did the last expedition to Richmond Gulf.\"  \"Ay, ay,\" cried one of the others, \"you may say that, Francois.  Nothin' but frost and starvation, and nobody to bury us when we're dead.\"  \"Except the Huskies,\" broke in another, \"who would save themselves the trouble by converting us all into dans!\"  \"Tush, man! stop your clapper,\" cried Francois, impatiently; \"let us settle this business.  You know that Monsieur Stanley said he would expect us to be ready with an answer to-night.--What think you, Gaspard? Shall we go, or shall we mutiny?\"  The individual addressed was a fine specimen of an animal, but not by any means a good specimen of a man.  He was of gigantic proportions, straight and tall as a poplar, and endowed with the strength of a Hercules.  His glittering dark eyes and long black hair, together with the hue of his skin, bespoke him of half-breed extraction.  But his countenance did not correspond to his fine physical proportions.  True, his features were good, but they wore habitually a scowling, sulky expression, even when the man was pleased, and there was more of sarcasm than joviality in the sound when Gaspard condescended to laugh.  \"I'll be shot if I go to such a hole for the best bourgeois in the country,\" said he in reply to Francois' question.  \"You'll be dismissed the service if you don't,\" remarked Massan with a smile.  To this Gaspard vouchsafed no reply save a growl that, to say the best of it, did not sound amiable.  \"Well, I think that we're all pretty much of one mind on the point,\" continued Francois; \"and yet I feel half ashamed to refuse after all, especially when I see the good will with which Messieurs Stanley and Morton agree to go.\"  \"I suppose _you_ expect to be a bourgeois too some day,\" growled Gaspard with a sneer.  \"Eh, tu gros chien!\" cried Francois, as with flashing eyes and clinched fists he strode up to his ill-tempered comrade.  \"Come, come, Francois; don't quarrel for nothing,\" said Massan, interposing his broad shoulders and pushing him vigorously back.  At that moment an exclamation from one of the men diverted the attention of the others.  \"Voila! the canoe.\"  \"Ay, it's Monsieur Stanley's canoe.  I saw him and Monsieur Morton start for the swamp this morning.\"  \"I wonder what Dick Prince would have done in this business had he been here,\" said Francois to Massan in a low tone, as they stood watching the approach of their bourgeois' canoe.  \"Can't say.  I half think he would have gone.\"  \"There's no chance of him coming back in time, I fear.\"  \"None; unless he prevails on some goose to lend him a pair of wings for a day or two.  He won't be back from the hunt for three weeks good.\"  In a few minutes more the canoe skimmed up to the wharf.  \"Here, lads,\" cried Mr Stanley, as he leaped ashore and dragged the canoe out of the water; \"one of you come and lift this canoe up the bank, and take these geese to the kitchen.\"  Two of the men instantly hastened to obey, and Stanley, with the gun and paddles under his arm, proceeded towards the gateway of the fort.  As he passed the group assembled on the wharf, he turned and said--  \"You'll come to the hall in an hour, lads; I shall expect you to be ready with an answer by that time.\"  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" replied several of the men.  \"But we won't go for all your expectations,\" said one in an undertone to a comrade.  \"I should think not,\" whispered another.  \"I'll be hanged, and burnt, and frozen if _I_ do,\" said a third.  In the meantime Mr Stanley walked briskly towards his dwelling, and left the men to grumble over their troubles and continue their debate as to whether they should or should not agree to go on the pending expedition to the distant regions of Ungava.    CHAPTER THREE.  SHOWS HOW STANLEY DEIGNED TO CONSULT WITH WOMANKIND--THE OPINIONS OF A CHILD DEVELOPED--PERSUASION FAILS--EXAMPLE TRIUMPHS--THE FIRST VOLUNTEERS TO UNGAVA.  On reaching his apartment, which was in an angle of the principal edifice in the fort, Mr Stanley flung down his gun and paddles, and drawing a chair close to his wife, who was working with her needle near a window, took her hand in his and heaved a deep sigh.  \"Why, George, that's what you used to say to me when you were at a loss for words in the days of our courtship.\"  \"True, Jessie,\" he replied, patting her shoulder with a hand that rough service had rendered hard and long exposure had burnt brown.  \"But the producing cause then was different from what it is now.  _Then_ it was love; _now_ it is perplexity.\"  Stanley's wife was the daughter of English parents, who had settled many years ago in the fur countries.  Being quite beyond the reach of any school, they had been obliged to undertake the instruction of their only child, Jessie, as they best could.  At first this was an easy matter, but as years flew by, and little Jessie's mind expanded, it was found to be a difficult matter to carry on her education in a country in most parts of which books were not to be had and schoolmasters did not exist. When the difficulty first presented itself, they talked of sending their little one to England to finish her education; but being unable to bring themselves to part with her, they resolved to have a choice selection of books sent out to them.  Jessie's mother was a clever, accomplished, and lady-like woman, and decidedly pious, so that the little flower, which was indeed born to blush unseen, grew up to be a gentle, affectionate woman--one who was a lady in all her thoughts and actions, yet had never seen polite society, save that of her father and mother.  In process of time Jessie became Mrs Stanley, and the mother of a little girl whose voice was, at the time her father entered, ringing cheerfully in an adjoining room.  Mrs Stanley's nature was an earnest one, and she no sooner observed that her husband was worried about something, than she instantly dropped the light tone in which she at first addressed him.  \"And what perplexes you now, dear George?\" she said, laying down her work and looking up in his face with that straightforward, earnest gaze that in days of yore had set the stout backwoodsman's heart on fire, and still kept it in a perennial blaze.  \"Nothing very serious,\" he replied with a smile; \"only these fellows have taken it into their stupid heads that Ungava is worse than the land beyond the Styx; and so, after the tough battle that I had with you this morning in order to prevail on you to remain here for a winter without me, I've had to fight another battle with them in order to get them to go on this expedition.\"  \"Have you been victorious?\" inquired Mrs Stanley.  \"No, not yet.\"  \"Do you really mean to say they are _afraid_ to go?  Has Prince refused? are Francois, Gaspard, and Massan cowards?\" she inquired, her eye kindling with indignation.  \"Nay, my wife, not so.  These men are not cowards; nevertheless they don't feel inclined to go; and as for Dick Prince, he has been off hunting for a week, and I don't expect him back for three weeks at least, by which time we shall be off.\"  Mrs Stanley sighed, as if she felt the utter helplessness of woman in such affairs.  \"Why, Jessie, that's what you used to say to me when you were at a loss for words in the days of our courtship,\" said Stanley, smiling.  \"Ah, George, like you I may say that the cause is now perplexity; for what can _I_ do to help you in your present difficulty?\"  \"Truly not much.  But I like to tell you of my troubles, and to make more of them than they deserve, for the sake of drawing forth your sympathy.  Bless your heart!\" he said, in a sudden burst of enthusiasm, \"I would gladly undergo any amount of trouble every day, if by so doing I should secure that earnest, loving, anxious gaze of your sweet blue eyes as a reward!\"  Stanley imprinted a hearty kiss on his wife's cheek as he made this lover-like speech, and then rose to place his fowling-piece on the pegs from which it usually hung over the fireplace.  At that moment the door opened, and a little girl, with bright eyes and flaxen hair, bounded into the room.  \"O mamma, mamma!\" she said, holding up a sheet of paper, while a look of intense satisfaction beamed on her animated countenance, \"see, I have drawn Chimo's portrait.  Is it like, mamma?  Do you think it like?\"  \"Come here, Eda, my darling, come to me,\" said Stanley, seating himself on a chair and extending his arms.  Edith instantly left the portrait of the dog "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21708"],["title","Up in the Clouds: Balloon Voyages (#1)"],["body","attached to the hands and arms.  The legs might also be brought into play a little.  It is obvious, however, that such wings would require to be mounted only in calm weather, for a breeze of wind would infallibly sweep the flyer off the face of the earth!  We would only observe, in conclusion, that, however ridiculous this method of flying may appear in your eyes, this at least may be said in its favour, that whereas all other plans that have been tried have signally failed, _this_ plan has never failed--never having been tried!  We throw the idea before a discriminating public, in the hope that some aspiring enthusiast, with plenty of means and nerve, and no family to mourn his loss, may one day prove, to the confusion of the incredulous, that our plan is not a mere flight of imagination!\"  When men began to find that wings refused in any circumstances to waft them to the realms of ether, they set about inventing aerial machines in which to ascend through the clouds and navigate the skies.  In the fourteenth century a glimmering of the true principles on which a balloon could be constructed was entertained by Albert of Saxony, a monk of the order of Saint Augustin, but he never carried his theories into practice.  His opinion was that, since fire is more attenuated than air, and floats above the region of our atmosphere, all that was necessary would be to enclose a portion of such ethereal substance in a light hollow globe which would thus be raised to a certain height, and kept suspended in the sky, and that by introducing a portion of air into the globe it would be rendered heavier than before, and might thus be made to descend.  This was in fact the statement of the principles on which fire-balloons were afterwards constructed and successfully sent up, excepting that air heated by fire, instead of fire itself, was used.  Others who came after Albert of Saxony held the same theory, but they all failed to reduce it to practice, and most of these men coupled with their correct notions on the subject, the very erroneous idea that by means of masts, sails, and a rudder, a balloon might be made to sail through the air as a ship sails upon the sea.  In this they seem to have confounded two things which are dissimilar, namely, a vessel driven through water, and a vessel floating in air.  The fallacy here may be easily pointed out.  A ship is driven through water by a body in motion, namely, wind, while its rudder is dragged through a body comparatively at rest, namely, water; hence the rudder slides against or is pushed against the water, and according as it is _turned_ to one side or the other, it is _pushed_ to one side or the other, the stern of the ship going along with it, and the bow, of course, making a corresponding motion in the opposite direction.  Thus the ship is turned or \"steered,\" but it is manifest that if the ship were at rest there would be no pushing of the rudder by the water--no steering.  On the other hand, if, though the ship were in motion, the sea was also flowing at the _same rate_ with the wind, there would be no flowing of water past the ship, the rudder would not be acted on, and the vessel could not be steered.  Now a balloon, carried by the wind, cannot be steered by a rudder, because it does not, like the ship, rest half in one medium which is in motion, and half in another medium which is at rest.  There is no sliding of any substance past its side, no possibility therefore of pushing a rudder against anything.  All floats along _with_ the wind.  If, however, the balloon could be made to go _faster_ than the wind, then steering would at once become possible; but sails cannot accomplish this, because, although wind can drive a ship faster than water flows, wind cannot drive a substance faster than itself flows.  The men of old did not, however, seem to take these points into consideration.  It yet remains to be seen whether steam shall ever be successfully applied to aerial machines, but this may certainly be assumed in the meantime, that, until by some means a balloon is propelled _faster than the wind_ through the atmosphere, sails will be useless, and steering, or giving direction, impossible.  It was believed, in those early times, when scientific knowledge was slender, that the dew which falls during the night is of celestial origin, shed by the stars, and drawn by the sun, in the heat of the day, back to its native skies.  Many people even went the length of asserting that an egg, filled with the morning dew, would, as the day advanced, rise spontaneously into the air.  Indeed one man, named Father Laurus, speaks of this as an observed fact, and gravely gives directions how it is to be accomplished.  \"Take,\" says he, \"a goose's egg, and having filled it with dew gathered fresh in the morning, expose it to the sun during the hottest part of the day, and it will ascend and rest suspended for a few moments.\"  Father Laurus must surely have omitted to add that a goose's brains in the head of the operator was an element essential to the success of the experiment!  But this man, although very ignorant in regard to the nature of the substances, with which he wrought, had some quaint notions in his head. He thought, for instance, that if he were to cram the cavity of an artificial dove with highly condensed air, the imprisoned fluid would impel the machine in the same manner as wind impels a sail.  If this should not be found to act effectively, he proposed to apply fire to it in some way or other, and, to prevent the machine from being spirited away altogether by that volatile element, asbestos, or some incombustible material, was to be used as a lining.  To feed and support this fire steadily, he suggested a compound of butter, salts, and orpiment, lodged in metallic tubes, which, he imagined, would at the same time heighten the whole effect by emitting a variety of musical tones like an organ!  Another man, still more sanguine than the lest in his aerial flights of fancy, proposed that an ascent should be attempted by the application of fire as in a rocket to an aerial machine.  We are not, however, told that this daring spirit ever ventured to try thus to invade the sky.  There can be no doubt that much ingenuity, as well as absurdity, has been displayed in the various suggestions that have been made from time to time, and occasionally carried into practice.  One man went the length of describing a huge apparatus, consisting of very long tin pipes, in which air was to be compressed by the vehement action of fire below.  In a boat suspended from the machine a man was to sit and direct the whole by the opening and shutting of valves.  Another scheme, more ingenious but not less fallacious, was propounded in 1670 by Francis Lana, a Jesuit, for navigating the air.  This plan was to make four copper balls of very large dimensions, yet so extremely thin that, after the air had been extracted, they should become, in a considerable degree, specifically lighter than the surrounding medium. Each of his copper balls was to be about 25 feet in diameter, with the thickness of only the 225th part of an inch, the metal weighing 365 pounds avoirdupois, while the weight of the air which it should contain would be about 670 pounds, leaving, after a vacuum had been formed, an excess of 305 pounds for the power of ascension.  The four balls would therefore, it was thought, rise into the air with a combined force of 1220 pounds, which was deemed by Lana to be sufficient to transport a boat completely furnished with masts, sails, oars, and rudders, and carrying several passengers.  The method by which the vacuum was to be obtained was by connecting each globe, fitted with a stop-cock, to a tube of at least thirty-five feet long; the whole being filled with water; when raised to the vertical position the water would run out, the stop-cocks would be closed at the proper time, and the vacuum secured. It does not seem to have entered the head of this philosopher that the weight of the surrounding atmosphere would crush and destroy his thin exhausted receivers, but he seems to have been alarmed at the idea of his supposed discovery being applied to improper uses, such as the passing of desperadoes over fortified cities, on which they might rain down fire and destruction from the clouds!  Perhaps the grandest of all the fanciful ideas that have been promulgated on this subject was that of Galien, a Dominican friar, who proposed to collect the fine diffused air of the higher regions, where hail is formed, above the summit of the loftiest mountains, and to enclose it in a cubical bag of enormous dimensions--extending more than a mile every way!  This vast machine was to be composed of the thickest and strongest sail-cloth, and was expected to be capable of transporting through the air a whole army with all their munitions of war!  There were many other devices which men hit upon, some of which embraced a certain modicum of truth mixed with a large proportion of fallacy. Ignorance, more or less complete, as to the principles and powers with which they dealt, was, in days gone by, the cause of many of the errors and absurdities into which men were led in their efforts to mount the atmosphere.  Our space, however, forbids further consideration of this subject, which is undoubtedly one of considerable interest, and encircled with a good deal of romance.  Turning away from all those early and fanciful speculations, we now come to that period in the history of balloon voyaging, or aeronautics, when true theories began to be philosophically applied, and ascending into the skies became an accomplished fact.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE FIRST BALLOONS.  The germ of the invention of the balloon lies in the discovery of Mr Cavendish, made in 1766, that hydrogen gas, called inflammable air, is at least seven times lighter than atmospheric air.  Founding on this fact, Dr Black of Edinburgh proved by experiment that a very"]]]
