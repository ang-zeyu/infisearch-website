He did not know how long he had sat thus, nor was he, perhaps, altogether conscious of his motive in failing to pay the aged senator the honour of accompanying him, at least so far as the gates of the Temple of Concord.  Sounds came to his ears from the apartments above: the trampling of feet and bustle of preparation that told of Velo's delivery of his patron's commands.  Then a woman's laugh rang through the passage that led back to the garden of the peristyle.  Sergius rose and turned, just as a girl sprang out into the atrium, looking back with a laughing challenge to some one who seemed to pursue her, but who hesitated to issue from the protecting darkness.  \"What do you fear, Minutia,\" she cried.  \"My father and Caius have gone, and there is no one--oh!\"  Suddenly she became conscious of Sergius' presence, and her olive cheeks flushed to a rich crimson.  Then she faced him with an air of pretty defiance and went on:--  \"No one here but Lucius Sergius Fidenas, who should have business elsewhere.\"  Sergius said nothing, but continued to stand with eyes fixed thoughtfully upon her face.  Her figure was tall, slender, and very graceful, her hair and eyes were dark, and her features delicate and perfectly moulded.  Over all was now an expression of hoydenish mirth that bespoke the complete forgetfulness of serious things that only comes to young girls.  His attentive silence seemed at last to disturb her.  An annoyed look drove the smile from her lips, and, with an almost imperceptible side motion of her small head, she went on:--  \"Surely Lucius Sergius Fidenas has not allowed my father to go to the Senate House with only Caius to attend him!  Lucius respects my father too much for that--and too disinterestedly.  It is an even more serious omission than his failure to attend the consul at Trasimenus--\"  Sergius' eyes blazed at the taunt, and, struggling with the answer that rose to his lips, he said nothing for fear he might say too much.  The girl watched him closely.  Her mirth returned a little at the sight of his confusion, and, with her mirth, came something of mercy.  \"Oh, to be sure, his wound.  I almost forgot that.  Tell me, my brave Lucius, did the Gauls bite hard when they caught you in the woods and drove you and my brave uncle to Tanes?  How funny for naked Gauls to ambush Roman legionaries and chase them home!  Father has not spoken to Uncle Cneus since.  He says it was his duty to have remained on the field, and I suppose he thinks it was yours, too, instead of running away like a fox to be shut up in his hole.\"  Sergius had recovered his composure now, but his brow was clouded.  \"You are as cruel as ever, Marcia,\" he said.  \"And yet I know you have heard that it was the men of my maniple who carried me away, senseless from the blow of a dead man.\"  \"Oh, you _did_ kill him.  I remember now,\" she resumed, with some display of interest.  \"You had run him through, had you not? and he just let his big sword drop on your head.  I got Caius to show me about it, and I was the Gaul.  Caius did not stab me, but I let the stick fall pretty hard, and Caius had a sore head for two days.  I meant it for you, because you are trying to make an old woman of me when I am hardly a girl.\"  \"Marcia--\" began Lucius; but she raised her hand warningly and went on:--  \"Do you want me to tell you why my father will not let you marry me now?  There are two reasons.  One because I don't want him to, and another because he thinks you must do something great to wipe out the stain of a Roman centurion's even being _carried_ away before the Gauls.\"  \"That will be an easy task, judging by the news we receive each day.  I wish I felt as certain of the safety of the Republic as I am that my honour shall be satisfactorily vindicated.\"  He spoke bitterly, but she went on without taking note of his meaning.  \"These are auspicious words, my Lucius.  You will regain your honour; father will once more receive you into his favour, and, by that time, I shall doubtless be old enough to marry,--perhaps too old,--but, no, I must not wait so long as that.  Perhaps I shall have married some one else by the time you are worthy of my favour.\"  \"More probably I shall have ceased to care for the favour of living men and women.\"  \"Truly?  And you think you will have to die?  Perhaps you will be a Decius Mus, and stand on the javelin and wear the Cincture Gabinus; and then I shall mourn for you and hang so many garlands on your tomb that all the shades of your friends will be mad with jealousy--\"  \"Marcia, is it possible for you to be serious?\"  He was pale with suppressed passion, and, as he spoke, he stepped forward and laid his hand upon her wrist.  She sprang back and half raised a light staff she carried, while her face flushed crimson.  \"I will be more serious than will please you,\" she said, \"if you please me as little as you do now.  Learn, I am not your wife that you should seek to restrain me, and it is quite possible that I never shall be.\"  \"You speak truly,\" he said; \"it is quite possible that no woman shall be a new mother to the house of Fidenas--that our name shall die in me. So be it; and may the gods only avert the evils that threaten the Republic, nor look upon one of the race of the Trojan Segestes as an unworthy offering.\"  Bending his head in respectful salutation, he turned toward the entrance hall.  Marcia stood silent beside the fountain, and her face clouded with thought.  The sound of her lover's footsteps grew fainter and fainter. She started forward as if to follow him.  Then she stopped and listened.  The noise of the street had drowned their echoes; the door had creaked twice on its pivots.  He was gone.  Then she called, \"Lucius!\" but there was no answer.  Her eyes drooped with a little frown of regret, but in a moment she turned away laughing.  \"Never mind.  He cannot do anything very desperate yet, and I will treat him better next time--perhaps.\"     III.  PARTING.  The ensuing days were pregnant with rumour and action.  The waves of terror and despair that lashed over the city, as blow after blow fell, had now receded.  The white banner, that was always lowered at the approach of an enemy, still spread its undulating folds above Janiculum; the crops and fruit trees and vines smiled upon the hillsides; the flocks and herds browsed peacefully along the Campagna with never a Numidian pillager to disturb their serenity; and, amid all, there was no rumour of allied gates opened to receive the invader, no welcome from the Italians whom he had striven to conciliate. Courage returned, and with courage firmness, and with firmness confidence to endure and dare and do, so long as invaders presumed to set foot upon the heritage of Rome.  How far this new confidence was born of the news that the Carthaginian was turning aside to the west, through Umbria and Picenum, how far by the rumour that Spoletum had closed her gates and repulsed his vanguard, or how far by wrath at the tales of ravage and the numberless murders of Roman citizens that marked his line of march, it would be difficult to apportion.  However these, the city was now seething with energetic preparation. The Senate sat daily and into each night.  No word of peace was uttered--all was war and revenge.  Quintus Fabius Maximus was elected pro-dictator by a vote of the Comitia--not dictator, because that could only be done through appointment by the surviving consul, then absent in Gaul--or none knew where.  By the same power, and in order to appease the commons irritated by criticisms of Flaminius, Marcus Minutius Rufus was elected master of the horse.  Nor were the gods neglected.  Their stimulating influence was invoked by the dictator to inspire the people with confidence, while he soothed them with the intimation that Flaminius had failed rather through overcourage and neglect of divine things than through mere plebeian temerity and ignorance.  Fabius took care to impress it upon all that he himself would take full warning from the lesson.  He moved that the Sibylline books should be consulted, and the Senate promptly acted upon the motion.  These directed that a holy spring be proclaimed forthwith; that every animal fit for sacrifice, and born between the Kalends of March and May throughout all Italy, should be offered to Jupiter. Votive games were decided upon, couches were set by the judges, whereon the twelve gods should feast in splendour, temples were vowed, to Venus Erycina by the dictator himself, to Mens by Titus Otacilius, the praetor.  But with all, and, as Fabius put it, that the immortal gods should not be overburdened with the petty affairs of mortals, every care that human prudence and warcraft could suggest was taken.  Walls and towers were strengthened, and bridges were broken down; the inhabitants of open towns were driven into places of security, and their houses and crops destroyed.  Amid all, the rumour came that Servilius was hastening back from Gaul; then, that he was close at hand, and, finally, Fabius set out to meet him, sending orders in advance that the consul should come without lictors, so that the dignity of the dictatorship might stand high before the people.  And when Servilius had come, in all respects as commanded, then he, the consul, after first delivering up his legions which he had left at Ariminum, was ordered to Ostia and the fleet to keep watch and ward over the Italian coast and to protect the corn ships.  So all the armies of the Republic went to the pro-dictator, together with authority to raise such more as he should consider needful; two new legions in the place of those dead on the shores of Trasimenus, and some thousands of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],["title","The Mind and Its Education (#1)"],["body","and thinking. 2.

It is easy to understand how we may investigate the great world of material things about us; for we can see it, touch it, weigh it, or measure it. But how are we to discover the nature of the mind, or come to know the processes by which consciousness works? For mind is intangible; we cannot see it, feel it, taste it, or handle it. Mind belongs not to the realm of matter which is known to the senses, but to the realm of _spirit_, which the senses can never grasp. And yet the mind can be known and studied as truly and as scientifically as can the world of matter. Let us first of all see how this can be done.   1. HOW MIND IS TO BE KNOWN  THE PERSONAL CHARACTER OF CONSCIOUSNESS.--Mind can be observed and known. But each one can know directly only his own mind, and not another's. You and I may look into each other's face and there guess the meaning that lies back of the smile or frown or flash of the eye, and so read something of the mind's activity. But neither directly meets the other's mind. I may learn to recognize your features, know your voice, respond to the clasp of your hand; but the mind, the consciousness, which does your thinking and feels your joys and sorrows, I can never know completely. Indeed I can never know your mind at all except through your bodily acts and expressions. Nor is there any way in which you can reveal your mind, your spiritual self, to me except through these means.  It follows therefore that only _you_ can ever know _you_ and only _I_ can ever know _I_ in any first-hand and immediate way. Between your consciousness and mine there exists a wide gap that cannot be bridged. Each of us lives apart. We are like ships that pass and hail each other in passing but do not touch. We may work together, live together, come to love or hate each other, and yet our inmost selves forever stand alone. They must live their own lives, think their own thoughts, and arrive at their "]]]
