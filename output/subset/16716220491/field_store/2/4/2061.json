He was reining in his steed--no easy task on that steep greasy pavement--so as to present some front to a score or so of ragged knaves who were following close at his heels, hooting and throwing mud and pebbles at him.  The man had drawn his sword, and his oaths came up to us, mingled with shrill cries of \"VIVE LA MESSE!\"  and half drowned by the clattering of the horse's hoofs.  We saw a stone strike him in the face, and draw blood, and heard him swear louder than before.  \"Oh!\"  cried Catherine, clasping her hands with a sudden shriek of indignation, \"my letter!  They will get my letter!\"  \"Death!\"  exclaimed Croisette, \"She is right!  It is M. de Pavannes' courier!  This must be stopped!  We cannot stand this, Anne!\"  \"They shall pay dearly for it, by our Lady!\"  I cried swearing myself. \"And in peace time too--the villains!  Gil!  Francis!\" I shouted, \"where are you?\"  And I looked round for my fowling piece, while Croisette jumped on the wall, and forming a trumpet with his hands, shrieked at the top of his voice, \"Back!  he bears a letter from the Vicomte!\"  But the device did not succeed, and I could not find my gun.  For a moment we were helpless, and before I could have fetched the gun from the house, the horseman and the hooting rabble at his heels, had turned a corner and were hidden by the roofs.  Another turn however would bring them out in front of the gateway, and seeing this we hurried down the ramp to meet them. I stayed a moment to tell Gil to collect the servants, and, this keeping me, Croisette reached the narrow street outside before me.  As I followed him I was nearly knocked down by the rider, whose face was covered with, dirt and blood, while fright had rendered his horse unmanageable.  Darting aside I let him pass--he was blinded and could not see me--and then found that Croisette--brave lad!  had collared the foremost of the ruffians, and was beating him with his sheathed sword, while the rest of the rabble stood back, ashamed, yet sullen, and with anger in their eyes. A dangerous crew, I thought; not townsmen, most of them.  \"Down with the Huguenots!\"  cried one, as I appeared, one bolder than the rest.  \"Down with the CANAILLE!\"  I retorted, sternly eyeing the ill-looking ring.  \"Will you set yourselves above the king's peace, dirt that you are?  Go back to your kennels!\"  The words were scarcely out of my mouth, before I saw that the fellow whom Croisette was punishing had got hold of a dagger.  I shouted a warning, but it came too late.  The blade fell, and--thanks to God--striking the buckle of the lad's belt, glanced off harmless.  I saw the steel flash up again--saw the spite in the man's eyes:  but this time I was a step nearer, and before the weapon fell, I passed my sword clean through the wretch's body. He went down like a log, Croisette falling with him, held fast by his stiffening fingers.  I had never killed a man before, nor seen a man die; and if I had stayed to think about it, I should have fallen sick perhaps.  But it was no time for thought; no time for sickness.  The crowd were close upon us, a line of flushed threatening faces from wall to wall.  A single glance downwards told me that the man was dead, and I set my foot upon his neck.  \"Hounds!  Beasts!\"  I cried, not loudly this time, for though I was like one possessed with rage, it was inward rage, \"go to your kennels!  Will you dare to raise a hand against a Caylus? Go--or when the Vicomte returns, a dozen of you shall hang in the market-place!\"  I suppose I looked fierce enough--I know I felt no fear, only a strange exaltation--for they slunk away.  Unwillingly, but with little delay the group melted, Bezers' following--of whom I knew the dead man was one--the last to go.  While I still glared at them, lo!  the street was empty; the last had disappeared round the bend.  I turned to find Gil and half-a-dozen servants standing with pale faces at my back. Croisette seized my hand with a sob.  \"Oh, my lord,\" cried Gil, quaveringly.  But I shook one off, I frowned at the other.  \"Take up this carrion!\"  I said, touching it with my foot, \"And hang it from the justice-elm.  And then close the gates!  See to it, knaves, and lose no time.\"    CHAPTER II.  THE VIDAME'S THREAT.  Croisette used to tell a story, of the facts of which I have no remembrance, save as a bad dream.  He would have it that I left my pallet that night--I had one to myself in the summer, being the eldest, while he and Marie slept on another in the same room--and came to him and awoke him, sobbing and shaking and clutching him; and begging him in a fit of terror not to let me go.  And that so I slept in his arms until morning.  But as I have said, I do not remember anything of this, only that I had an ugly dream that night, and that when I awoke I was lying with him and Marie; so I cannot say whether it really happened.  At any rate, if I had any feeling of the kind it did not last long; on the contrary--it would be idle to deny it--I was flattered by the sudden respect, Gil and the servants showed me. What Catherine thought of the matter I could not tell.  She had her letter and apparently found it satisfactory.  At any rate we saw nothing of her.  Madame Claude was busy boiling simples, and tending the messenger's hurts. And it seemed natural that I should take command.  There could be no doubt--at any rate we had none that the assault on the courier had taken place at the Vidame's instance.  The only wonder was that he had not simply cut his throat and taken the letter.  But looking back now it seems to me that grown men mingled some childishness with their cruelty in those days--days when the religious wars had aroused our worst passions.  It was not enough to kill an enemy.  It pleased people to make--I speak literally--a football of his head, to throw his heart to the dogs.  And no doubt it had fallen in with the Vidame's grim humour that the bearer of Pavannes' first love letter should enter his mistress's presence, bleeding and plaistered with mud. And that the riff-raff about our own gates should have part in the insult.  Bezers' wrath would be little abated by the issue of the affair, or the justice I had done on one of his men.  So we looked well to bolts, and bars, and windows, although the castle is well-nigh impregnable, the smooth rock falling twenty feet at least on every side from the base of the walls.  The gatehouse, Pavannes had shown us, might be blown up with gunpowder indeed, but we prepared to close the iron grating which barred the way half-way up the ramp.  This done, even if the enemy should succeed in forcing an entrance he would only find himself caught in a trap--in a steep, narrow way exposed to a fire from the top of the flanking walls, as well as from the front.  We had a couple of culverins, which the Vicomte had got twenty years before, at the time of the battle of St. Quentin.  We fixed one of these at the head of the ramp, and placed the other on the terrace, where by moving it a few paces forward we could train it on Bezers' house, which thus lay at our mercy.  Not that we really expected an attack.  But we did not know what to expect or what to fear.  We had not ten servants, the Vicomte having taken a score of the sturdiest lackeys and keepers to attend him at Bayonne.  And we felt immensely responsible.  Our main hope was that the Vidame would at once go on to Paris, and postpone his vengeance. So again and again we cast longing glances at the House of the Wolf hoping that each symptom of bustle heralded his departure.  Consequently it was a shock to me, and a great downfall of hopes, when Gil with a grave face came to me on the terrace and announced that M. le Vidame was at the gate, asking to see Mademoiselle.  \"It is out of the question that he should see her,\" the old servant added, scratching his head in grave perplexity.  \"Most certainly.  I will see him instead,\" I answered stoutly. \"Do you leave Francis and another at the gate, Gil.  Marie, keep within sight, lad.  And let Croisette stay with me.\"  These preparations made--and they took up scarcely a moment--I met the Vidame at the head of the ramp.  \"Mademoiselle de Caylus,\" I said, bowing, \"is, I regret to say, indisposed to-day, Vidame.\"  \"She will not see me?\"  he asked, eyeing me very unpleasantly.  \"Her indisposition deprives her of the pleasure,\" I answered with an effort.  He was certainly a wonderful man, for at sight of him, three-fourths of my courage, and all my importance, oozed out at the heels of my boots.  \"She will not see me.  Very well,\" he replied, as if I had not spoken. And the simple words sounded like a sentence of death. \"Then, M. Anne, I have a crow to pick with you.  What compensation do you propose to make for the death of my servant? A decent, quiet fellow, whom you killed yesterday, poor man, because his enthusiasm for the true faith carried him away a little.\"  \"Whom I killed because he drew a dagger on M. St. Croix de Caylus at the Vicomte's gate,\" I answered steadily.  I had thought about this of course and was ready for it.  \"You are aware, M. de Bezers,\" I continued, \"that the Vicomte has jurisdiction extending to life and death over all persons within the valley?\"  \"My household excepted,\" he rejoined quietly.  \"Precisely; while they are within the curtilage of your house,\" I retorted.  \"However as the punishment was summary, and the man had no time to confess himself, I am willing to--\"  \"Well?\"  \"To pay Father Pierre to say ten masses for his soul.\"  The way the Vidame received this surprised me.  He broke into boisterous laughter.  \"By our Lady, my friend,\" he cried with rough merriment, \"but you are a joker!  You are indeed.  Masses? Why the man was a Protestant!\"  And that startled me more than anything which had gone before; more indeed than I can explain.  For it seemed to prove that this man, laughing his unholy laugh"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20411"],["title","The Witch-cult in Western Europe: A Study in Anthropology (#1)"],["body","sources, i.e. the legal records of the trials, pamphlets giving accounts of individual witches, and the works of Inquisitors and other writers. I have omitted the opinions of the authors, and have examined only the recorded facts, without however including the stories of ghosts and other 'occult' phenomena with which all the commentators confuse the subject. I have also, for the reason given below, omitted all reference to charms and spells when performed by one witch alone, and have confined myself to those statements only which show the beliefs, organization, and ritual of a hitherto unrecognized cult.  In order to clear the ground I make a sharp distinction between Operative Witchcraft and Ritual Witchcraft. Under Operative Witchcraft I class all charms and spells, whether used by a professed witch or by a professed Christian, whether intended for good or for evil, for killing or for curing. Such charms and spells are common to every nation and country, and are practised by the priests and people of every religion. They are part of the common heritage of the human race and are therefore of no practical value in the study of any one particular cult.  Ritual Witchcraft—or, as I propose to call it, the Dianic cult—embraces the religious beliefs and ritual of the people known in late mediaeval times as 'Witches'. The evidence proves that underlying the Christian religion was a cult practised by many classes of the community, chiefly, however, by the more ignorant or those in the less thickly inhabited parts of the country. It can be traced back to pre-Christian times, and appears to be the ancient religion of Western Europe. The god, anthropomorphic or theriomorphic, was worshipped in well-defined rites; the organization was highly developed; and the ritual is analogous to many other ancient rituals. The dates of the chief festivals suggest that the religion belonged to a race which had not reached the agricultural stage; and the evidence shows that various modifications were introduced, probably by invading peoples who brought in their own beliefs. I have not attempted to disentangle the various cults; I am content merely to point out that it was a definite religion with beliefs, ritual, and organization as highly developed as that of any other cult in the world.  The deity of this cult was incarnate in a man, a woman, or an animal; the animal form being apparently earlier than the human, for the god was often spoken of as wearing the skin or attributes of an animal. At the same time, however, there was another form of the god in the shape of a man with two faces. Such a god is found in Italy (where he was called Janus or Dianus), in Southern France (see pp. 62, 129), and in the English Midlands. The feminine form of the name, Diana, is found throughout Western Europe as the name of the female deity or leader of the so-called Witches, and it is for this reason that I have called this ancient religion the Dianic cult. The geographical distribution of the two-faced god suggests that the race or races, who carried the cult, either did not remain in every country which they entered, or that in many places they and their religion were overwhelmed by subsequent invaders.  The dates of the two chief festivals, May Eve and November Eve, indicate the use of a calendar which is generally acknowledged to be pre-agricultural and earlier than the solstitial division of the year. The fertility rites of the cult bear out this indication, as they were for promoting the increase of animals and only rarely for the benefit of the crops. The cross-quarter-days, February 2 and August 1, which were also kept as festivals, were probably of later date, as, though classed among the great festivals, they were not of so high an importance as the May and November Eves. To February 2, Candlemas Day, probably belongs the sun-charm of the burning wheel, formed by the whirling dancers, each carrying a blazing torch; but no special ceremony seems to be assigned to August 1, Lammas Day, a fact suggestive of a later introduction of this festival.  The organization of the hierarchy was the same throughout Western Europe, with the slight local differences which always occur in any organization. The same organization, when carried to America, caused Cotton Mather to say, 'The witches are organized like Congregational Churches.' This gives the clue at once. In each Congregational Church there is a body of elders who manage the affairs of the Church, and the minister who conducts the religious services and is the chief person in religious matters; and there may also be a specially appointed person to conduct the services in the minister's absence; each Church is an independent entity and not necessarily connected with any other. In the same way there was among the witches a body of elders—the Coven—which managed the local affairs of the cult, and a man who, like the minister, held the chief place, though as God that place was infinitely higher in the eyes of the congregation than any held by a mere human being. In some of the larger congregations there was a person, inferior to the Chief, who took charge in the Chief's absence. In Southern France, however, there seems to have been a Grand Master who was supreme over several districts.  The position of the chief woman in the cult is still somewhat obscure. Professor Pearson sees in her the Mother-Goddess worshipped chiefly by women. This is very probable, but at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female, and it is only on rare occasions that the God appears in female form to receive the homage of the worshippers. As a general rule the woman's position, when divine, is that of the familiar or substitute for the male god. There remains, however, the curious fact that the chief woman was often identified with the Queen of Faerie, or the Elfin Queen as she is sometimes called.  This connexion of the witches and fairies opens up a very wide field; at present it is little more than speculation that the two are identical, but there is promise that the theory may be proved at some later date when the subject is more fully worked out. It is now a commonplace of anthropology that the tales of fairies and elves preserve the tradition of a dwarf race which once inhabited Northern and Western Europe. Successive invasions drove them to the less fertile parts of each country which they inhabited, some betook themselves to the inhospitable north or the equally inhospitable mountains; some, however, remained in the open heaths and moors, living as mound-dwellers, venturing out chiefly at night and coming in contact with the ruling races only on rare occasions. As the conqueror always regards the religion of the conquered as superior to his own in the arts of evil magic, the dwarf race obtained the reputation of wizards and magicians, and their god was identified by the conquerors with the Principle of Evil. The identification of the witches with the dwarf or fairy race would give us a clear insight into much of the civilization of the early European peoples, especially as regards their religious ideas.  The religious rites varied according to circumstances and the requirements of the people. The greater number of the ceremonies appear to have been practised for the purpose of securing fertility. Of these the sexual ritual has been given an overwhelming and quite unwarranted importance in the trials, for it became an obsession with the Christian judges and recorders to investigate the smallest and most minute details of the rite. Though in late examples the ceremony had possibly degenerated into a Bacchanalian orgy, there is evidence to prove that, like the same rite in other countries, it was originally a ceremonial magic to ensure fertility. There is at present nothing to show how much of the Witches' Mass (in which the bread, the wine, and the candles were black) derived from the Christian ritual and how much belonged to the Dianic cult; it is, however, possible that the witches' service was the earlier form and influenced the Christian. The admission ceremonies were often elaborate, and it is here that the changes in the religion are most clearly marked; certain ceremonies must have been introduced when another cult was superimposed and became paramount, such as the specific renunciation of a previous religion which was obligatory on all new candidates, and the payment to the member who brought a new recruit into the fold. The other rites—the feasts and dances—show that it was a joyous religion; and as such it must have been quite incomprehensible to the gloomy Inquisitors and Reformers who suppressed it.  Much stress has always been laid by the sceptical writers on the undoubted fact that in many cases the witch confused dreams with reality and believed that she had visited the Sabbath when credible witnesses could prove that she had slept in her bed all the time. Yet such visions are known in other religions; Christians have met their Lord in dreams of the night and have been accounted saints for that very reason; Mahomed, though not released from the body, had interviews with Allah; Moses talked with God; the Egyptian Pharaohs record similar experiences. To the devotee of a certain temperament such visions occur, and it is only to be expected that in every case the vision should take the form required by the religion of the worshipper. Hence the Christian sees Christ and enters heaven; Mahomed was caught up to the Paradise of the true believers; the anthropomorphic Jehovah permitted only a back view to His votary; the Egyptian Pharaohs beheld their gods alive and moving on the earth. The witch also met her god at the actual Sabbath and again in her dreams, for that earthly Sabbath was to her the true Paradise, where there was more pleasure than she could express, and she believed also that the joy which she took in it was but the prelude"]]]
