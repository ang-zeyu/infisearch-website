He thought that they were more hungry for bejeweled verbiage than for the Bread of Life.  He thought they were thirsting more for a stream of eloquence than for the Water of Life.  But he was mistaken.  And once he came into the pulpit to find a card lying before him on which was written this word: \"Sir, we would know Jesus.\"  At first it angered him a bit and then it made him think.  And then it sent him to his knees.  And then it sent him into the pulpit with a new message.  And one day he came again into his pulpit to find a second card before him.  Picking it up, he read these words: \"Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.\"  Of course they were.  Their gladness was the gladness of the ten that met in the Upper Room.  Their gladness was the gladness that might have been experienced by Thomas. It was intended for him, for he was the saddest and most wretched man in Jerusalem.  But Thomas was not there.  Thomas missed also the gift of peace.  Jesus said to those present, \"Peace be unto you.\"  And how Thomas needed that gift!  Thomas was in a fever of restlessness and wretchedness.  He was whipped by a veritable tempest of doubt and utter unbelief.  And all the while he might have had the peace that passeth understanding.  He might have had the vision of Him who stood then, and still stands, the central figure of the ages, saying, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\"  Those present that day were blessed with the gift of peace.  They had \"fervor without fever.\"  They had motion without friction.  But Thomas missed it because \"he was not with them when Jesus came.\"  The disciples who were there were re-commissioned that day.  Jesus said to them, \"As the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.\"  With His death everything seemed at an end.  The great program that He had given them seemed to have lapsed forever.  A man said a few years ago, \"Life doesn't seem worth living since I found that Christianity is not true.\" It was so with these men.  They were men without a goal.  But Jesus came and recommissioned them, laid upon them again the high task of conquering the world.  And Thomas missed that great blessing because he was not there.  Last of all, Jesus breathed upon them and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\"  These men were not only recommissioned.  They received the Holy Ghost.  \"He breathed on them.\"  How close they came to Him that day!  How their hearts were warmed!  How their hopes were revived!  \"He breathed on them and said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\"  And poor Thomas missed also this benediction because he was not with them when Jesus came.  It may be that you were once active in the church.  It may be that you were once a live and enthusiastic Christian.  But little by little you have slipped back.  You have moved to strange places.  Your life has been thrown in great cities.  And you have missed the fellowships of yesterday out of your life.  It may be that to-day you are no longer found regularly among the worshipers in God's House.  You are missing something.  Don't deceive yourself.  As the saints of God meet together Jesus still manifests Himself.  And seeing Him, there comes to us a new joy and peace, a new sense of the purpose and worthfulness of life. Seeing Him there comes to us a new power for battle and for conquest.  But if we have missed Him, whatever else we have won, we have missed about all that is worth while.  Oh, there is one thing of which I am absolutely sure, and that is that if I have Jesus, if His presence is a gladsome reality to my heart, nothing else matters much.  But if I miss Him everything goes wrong and everything is disappointing.  Darius is in the palace and Daniel in the den of lions, but there is restlessness and wretchedness in the palace and peace and joy in the lions' den.  It is the presence of God that makes the difference.  Thomas, because he missed receiving, also missed the privilege of giving.  When the other disciples came from that meeting, how radiant were their faces!  What a spring they had in their step!  What joy bringers they were!  What a marvelously thrilling story they had to tell!  Freely had they received and freely did they give.  But Thomas.  He had received nothing, therefore he had nothing to give. He was a disappointment to his Master.  For a whole week he went doubting Him, mistrusting Him, when it was his privilege to have walked into His fellowship and been as sure of His reality and of His nearness as he was of his own existence.  In the second place, he missed the privilege of helping his fellow disciples.  What an encouragement he might have been to them!  How it would have strengthened the faith of those Christians who had not yet seen the vision of their risen Lord to have seen the light even upon the gloomy face of Thomas!  But Thomas missed the privilege of giving. I cannot rob myself without robbing you.  I cannot starve myself spiritually without helping to starve you.  I cannot sin alone.  If I do that which lowers my spiritual vitality, by that very act I help to lower yours also.  \"Thomas was not with them when Jesus came,\" and he missed a double blessing, the privilege of receiving and the privilege of giving.  But Thomas, in spite of his failure, succeeded in the end.  Tradition tells us that he died a martyr for his love and devotion to his Lord. How was he saved?  How was he brought to the joy and usefulness that are born of certainty?  Thomas, you know, was a doubter.  A very thoroughgoing doubter he was.  How then, in spite of his doubts, did he find his way into the fulness of the Light?  First, Thomas was not proud of his doubts.  He did not look upon them as blessings or as treasures.  There is a type of doubter to-day who does.  I have heard men speak of \"my doubts\" as if they were very priceless things.  But no man is of necessity the richer for his doubts.  I know that doubt may become a doorway to a larger faith. Still, I repeat, no man is of necessity the richer for them.  For instance, no man is the richer because of his social doubts.  The man who does not believe in his fellow man is poor indeed.  The man who has doubts about the inmates of his home suffers something of the pangs of hell.  And the man who doubts God can hardly consider himself the possessor of a prize to be coveted.  Thomas doubted, but he was not proud of his doubts.  Thomas was not only not proud of his doubts, but was thoroughly wretched on account of them.  And being thoroughly wretched because of them, he was willing to be set right.  He wanted to believe.  It seems to me that any man would.  Thomas was eager to be made sure that the Christ he loved was really alive.  He yearned for certainty.  Thomas was not only willing, but Thomas was reasonable.  When he sought to be sure of Jesus he put himself in the best possible position to learn the truth.  When he wanted to be made sure of Christ he did not seek knowledge at the hands of the enemies of Christ.  He did not ask information of those who were confessed strangers to Christ.  So often we do.  We get in the grip of doubt and straightway we turn from the fellowship of those who know the Lord to the fellowship of those who confessedly do not know Him.  We read those books that strengthen our doubts rather than those that strengthen our faith.  But Thomas was wiser.  \"Thomas, we have seen the Lord.\"  That is what Peter and James and John and the rest said to Thomas after this wonderful service that Thomas missed.  And what was the answer of this doubter?  Did his face light up as he said, \"I am glad to hear it\"?  Not a bit of it.  He said, \"Except I see in His hand the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into His side I will not believe.\"  And what Thomas meant by this answer was simply this: \"There is nothing that you can say or do that will make me believe at all.  I simply cannot believe and cannot be made to believe that Jesus has risen.\"  Now I do not think that his fellow disciples argued With him.  Really it would have done no good.  They simply left him to his own thoughts. And I fancy that those thoughts ran something after this fashion: \"What they say is not true.  They are mistaken.  Of course they are.  They must be.  And yet they certainly believe in the truth of what they say. God grant that they are right.  There is nothing that I would not give to know.\"  Then what did this honest and earnest doubter do?  Listen!  \"And after eight days again the disciples were within and Thomas with them.\"  Yes, Thomas is a doubter.  But he is an honest and hungry-hearted doubter. He is willing to give himself every opportunity to know the truth.  He says, \"I will turn my face toward the east.  Then if there is a dawn I will see it.\"  And what happened?  The dawning came.  The sun rose, \"even the Son of righteousness with healing in His wings.\"  \"Then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.  Then saith He to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.  And Thomas answered and said unto Him, My Lord and my God.\"  Thomas became absolutely certain.  It is my firm conviction that that same certainty is your privilege and mine.  I believe that Jesus spoke the simple truth when He said, \"If any man is willing to do His will, he shall know.\"  However little you may believe at this present moment, if you will be loyal to what you do believe, if you will follow the light that you have, it will bring you into the brightness of the day.  You remember how Horace Bushnell, while a student at Yale, felt that he was in the way of a great revival that was sweeping through the University.  He did not want to stand in the way of this revival and yet he was an unbeliever.  He did not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20578"],["title","Sermons on Biblical Characters (#2)"],["body","that he could come out on the side of Jesus Christ for he did not believe in Christ.  \"What then do you believe?\" a voice within him seemed to ask.  \"I believe there is an absolute difference between right and wrong,\" was the answer.  \"Have you ever put yourself on the side of the right to follow it regardless of consequences?\" was the next question.  \"I have not,\" was the answer, \"but I will.\"  So Horace Bushnell kneeled there in his room and dedicated himself to the service of the right.  And what was the result?  After he had been a preacher of the Gospel in Hartford, Connecticut, for forty-seven years he said, \"Better than I know any man in Hartford I know Jesus Christ.\"  When I was a lad I was overtaken by darkness while some eight or ten miles from home.  The night was intensely black, so much so that I lost my way absolutely.  I found myself after some hours in a dense forest. I made up my mind to dismount from my horse and sleep on the ground, as I saw no chance of finding my way home.  But I had no sooner dismounted than the lightning began to flash and the thunder to roar and I was warned of an approaching storm.  A little later the storm burst upon me.  And I mounted and rode on through the dark, not knowing whither I went.  At last, far past midnight, I saw a speck of light in the distance.  That light did not look at all like a sunrise.  It was as small as a needle point.  And yet I followed it because it was all I could see on the black bosom of the darkness.  A little later I found that that light was shining from a window in my own home.  A little later still I found my anxious mother behind that light waiting for the home-coming of her boy.  Now, I did not have much light to begin with.  It was pathetically meager.  But as I followed it it led me home.  Thomas had but little. Bushnell had but little.  But they were willing to be true to the light that they had.  And being true to it, they found the fullness of the light.  For it was true then as it is true to-day, \"if any man is willing to do His will, he shall know.\"     II  THE GREAT REFUSAL--JONAH  _Jonah 1:1-3_  There is doubtless not another book in the literature of the world that has suffered more at the hands of men than the book of Jonah.  It has been tortured by its enemies and wounded in the house of its friends. We have been so prone to give our attention to the non-essential in the book rather than the essential.  We have had such keen eyes for the seemingly ridiculous and the bizarre.  For this reason it has come to pass that you can hardly mention the name of Jonah to a modern audience without provoking a smile.  Thus Jonah, coming to us as an evangelist, is mistaken by many for a clown.  Now this is a calamity.  It is a calamity in the first place because the book of Jonah is one of the gems of literature.  There is not another book in the Old Testament that is more fragrant with the breath of inspiration.  There is not another book more radiant with the light of the divine love.  It is a wonderful gospel in itself.  Therefore it is a great pity that we have turned from its winsome wealth to give ourselves to the unedifying task of measuring the size of a fish's throat.  Did you ever hear of the hungry men that were invited to a feast?  When they came within the banquet hall they found the table spread with the viands of a king.  But the table was a bit out of the ordinary. Therefore, there arose a discussion over the material out of which it was made.  These guests began heated arguments also over the method of its carpentry.  And they argued so long and learnedly and well that the food went utterly to waste and they went away more hungry than when they had come.  There is a story of a prince who loved a beautiful peasant girl.  In spite of his royal blood he determined to marry her.  To seal his pledge of marriage he sent her a wonderful engagement ring.  It was a gem so marvelous that it was said the stars shut their eyes in its presence and even the sun acknowledged it as a rival.  But the girl was more interested in the beautiful box in which it was packed than she was in the ring.  And when the prince came he was humiliated and disappointed to find her wearing the box tied upon her finger while the jewel had been neglected and forgotten and utterly lost.  Now there is real jewelry here.  Let us forget the rather queer casket in which this jewel comes while we examine the treasure.  \"The word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Ammittai, saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for its wickedness has come up before me.\"  \"The word of the Lord came unto Jonah.\"  There is nothing crude about that statement.  There is nothing in that to excite our ridicule.  That is one of the blessed and thrilling truths of the ages.  To this man Jonah, living some time, somewhere, God spoke.  To this man God made known His will and holy purpose.  And God is speaking still.  The word of God is coming to men and women to-day.  There is not a single soul listening to me at this moment but what at some time in your life there has come a definite and sure word from God.  You have felt the impress of His Spirit upon your own spirit.  You have felt the touch of His hand on yours.  You have seen His finger pointing to the road in which you ought to walk and to the task that He was calling upon you to perform.  How this word came to Jonah we do not know, nor do we need to know.  It may have come to him through the consciousness of another's need.  It may have come to him through a study of the Word.  It may have come to him through the call of a friend.  How it came is not the essential thing.  The one thing essential and fundamental is this, that the word did come.  That is the essential thing in your case and in mine.  God does speak to us.  God does move upon us.  God does call us, command us.  God does stir us up.  \"The word of the Lord came unto Jonah,\" and it comes this very moment to you and to me.  What was it that the Lord said to Jonah?  He gave him a strange and unwelcome command.  He said, \"Arise and go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it, for its wickedness has come up before me.\"  It was hard for Jonah to believe that he had heard aright.  Was it possible that Nineveh was a great city in spite of the fact that it was a heathen city?  Was it possible that Nineveh grieved God because of its wickedness?  Could it be possible that God really loved Nineveh, though it was outside the covenant?  Jonah did not want to believe this, but he had to believe it.  He had to realize that    \"The love of God is wider than the measure of man's mind   And the heart of the Eternal is most wonderfully kind.\"   Jonah did not want to undertake this mission.  His objection, however, did not grow out of the fear that Nineveh would refuse to repent.  His reluctance was not born of the conviction that there was nothing in the people of Nineveh to which his message would appeal.  I know we are often hampered by that conviction.  We feel that it is absolutely useless to preach to some folks.  There is no use in trying to christianize Africa.  There is no use even in trying to christianize some of our next door neighbors.  We so often forget that there is in every man an insatiable hunger and an unquenchable thirst that none but God can satisfy.  But to Jonah this call was unwelcome because he feared that Nineveh might repent.  And that he did not want Nineveh to do.  Jonah believed that God was the God of Israel only.  He believed that God blessed Israel in two ways.  First, He blessed her by giving her gifts spiritual and temporal.  And He blessed her, in the second place, by sending calamities upon her enemies.  An abundant harvest in Israel was a blessing from the Lord.  A famine in Nineveh was also a blessing from the Lord.  Jonah was firmly convinced that the prosperity of a nation other than his own meant calamity to Israel.  It is a pity that this selfish belief did not perish with Jonah.  But when we face the facts we know that it did not.  It is a very human trait in us to feel that another's advancement is in some way a blow to ourselves.  It is equally a human trait to feel that another's downfall and disgrace in some way adds a bit of luster to our own crowns.  Of course, nothing could be more utterly false, but in spite of this fact we cling to that faith through all the passing centuries.  On the whole this duty, then, that God had put upon Jonah was so distasteful that he made up his mind that whatever it might cost him he would not obey.  Therefore, we read that he \"rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.\"  Ordered to Nineveh he sets out for Tarshish.  There were two cities on his map and only two. There was Nineveh, the city to which he might go in the fellowship of God and within the circle of the will of God.  There was also Tarshish, the city that lay at the end of the rebel's road, the city whose streets, if ever he walked them at all, he would walk without the fellowship of the God whom he had disobeyed.  And there are just two cities on your map.  The Nineveh of obedience and the Tarshish of disobedience.  You are going to Nineveh or to Tarshish.  I do not claim to know where your Nineveh is.  It may be a distant city.  It may be a city across the seas whose streets you will crimson with the blood of your sacrifice.  It may be a city as near to you as the home in which you live, as the child that nestles in your arms.  But wherever it is, if you walk its streets you will walk them in the joy of the divine fellowship.  On the other hand, you may go to Tarshish.  Tarshish is the city of \"Have-Your-Own-Way.\"  It is the city of \"Do-As-You-Please.\"  It is the city of \"Take-it-Easy.\"  It is the city with no garden called Gethsemane without its gates and no rugged hill called Calvary overlooks its walls.  It is a city without a cross and yet it is a city where people seldom sing"]]]
