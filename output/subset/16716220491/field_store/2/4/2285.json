It fitted tightly and baby evidently did not approve of the ornament.  My mother took it off when the man left.  I have it now.  This man used to tell queer stories about the salt trade, and the fortunes made therein, and how they used to land salt on stormy and dark nights on the Cheshire or Lancashire borders, or into boats alongside, substituting the same weight of water as the salt taken out, so that the cargo should pass muster at the Liverpool Custom House.  The duty was payable at the works, and the cargo was re-weighed in Liverpool.  If found over weight, the merchant had to pay extra duty; and if short weight, he had to make up the deficiency in salt.  The trade required a large capital, and was, therefore, in few hands.  One house is known to have paid as much as 30,000 pounds for duty in six weeks.  My grandfather told me that in 1732 (time of William and Mary), when he was a boy, the duty on salt was levied for a term of years at first, but made perpetual in the third year of George II.  Sir R. Walpole proposed to set apart the proceeds of the impost for his majesty's use.  The Salt houses occupied the site of Orford-street (called after Mr. Blackburne's seat in Cheshire).  I have often heard my grandfather speak of them as an intolerable nuisance, causing, at times, the town to be enveloped in steam and smoke.  These Salt houses raised such an outcry at last that in 1703 they were removed to Garston, Mr. Blackburne having obtained an act of Parliament relative to them for that purpose.  The fine and coarse salts manufactured in Liverpool were in the proportion of fifteen tons of Northwich or Cheshire rock-salt to forty-five tons of seawater, to produce thirteen tons of salt.  To show how imperishable salt must be, if such testimony be needed, it is a fact that, in the yard of a warehouse occupied by a friend of mine in Orford-street, the soil was always damp previous to a change of weather, and a well therein was of no use whatever, except for cleansing purposes, so brackish was the water.  To return to the launch.  After the feasting was over my father treated our friends to the White House and Ranelagh Tea Gardens, which stood at the top of Ranelagh-street.  The site is now occupied by the Adelphi Hotel.  The gardens extended a long way back.  Warren-street is formed out of them.  These gardens were very tastefully arranged in beds and borders, radiating from a centre in which was a Chinese temple, which served as an orchestra for a band to play in.  Round the sides of the garden, in a thicket of lilacs and laburnums, the beauty of which, in early summer, was quite remarkable, were little alcoves or bowers wherein parties took tea or stronger drinks.  About half-way up the garden, the place where the Warren-street steps are now, there used to be a large pond or tank wherein were fish of various sorts.  These fish were so tame that they would come to the surface to be fed.  This fish feeding was a very favourite amusement with those who frequented the garden.  In the tank were some carp of immense size, and so fat they could hardly swim. Our servant-man used to take me to the Ranelagh Gardens every fine afternoon, as it was a favourite lounge.  Over the garden door was written--      \"You are welcome to walk here I say,     But if flower or fruit you pluck     One shilling you must pay.\"  The garden paling was carried up Copperas-hill (called after the Copperas Works, removed in 1770, after long litigation) across to Brownlow-hill, a white ropery extending behind the palings.  To show how remarkably neighbourhoods alter by time and circumstance, I recollect it was said that Lord Molyneux, while hunting, once ran a hare down Copperas-hill.  A young lady, Miss Harvey, who resided near the corner, went out to see what was the cause of the disturbance she heard, when observing the hare, she turned it back.  Miss Harvey used to say \"the gentlemen swore terribly\" at her for spoiling their sport.  This was not seventy years ago!  To return to the Ranelagh Gardens.  There was, at the close of the gala nights, as they were called, a display of fireworks.  They were let off on the terrace.  I went to see the last exhibition which took place in 1780.  There was, on that occasion, a concert in which Miss Brent, (who was, by the way, a great favourite) appeared.  Jugglers used to exhibit in the concert-room, which was very capacious, as it would hold at least 800 to 1000 persons.  This concert-room was also used as a dinner-room on great occasions, and also as a town ball-room.  Stephens gave his lecture on \"Heads\" in it very frequently.  G. A. Stephens was an actor, who, after playing about in the provincial highways and bye-ways of the dramatic world, went to London, where he was engaged at Covent Garden in second and third rate parts.  He was a man of dissipated habits, but a jovial and merry companion.  He wrote a great many very clever songs, which he sang with great humour.  He got the idea of the lectures on \"Heads\" from a working man about one of the theatres, whom he saw imitating some of the members of the corporation of the town in which he met with him.  Stephens, who was quick and ready with his pen, in a short time got up his lecture, which he delivered all through England, Scotland, Ireland, and America.  He realised upwards of 10,000 pounds, which he took care of, as he left that sum behind him at his death, in 1784.  He was at the time, a completely worn-out, imbecile old man.  Many of the leading actors of his day followed up the lecture on \"Heads,\" in which they signally failed to convey the meaning of the author.  I saw him, and was very much amused; but I do not think he would be tolerated in the present day.  The elder Mathews evidently caught the idea of his \"At Homes\" from Stephens's lecture.  Brownlow-hill was so called after Mr. Lawrence Brownlow, a gentleman who held much property thereabout.  Brownlow-hill was a very pleasant walk. There were gardens on it, as, also, on Mount Pleasant, then called Martindale's-hill, of which our friend Mr. Roscoe has sung so sweetly. Martindale's-hill was quite a country walk when I was a little boy. There was also a pleasant walk over the Moss Lake Fields to Edge Hill. Where the Eye and Ear Infirmary stands there was a stile and a foot-path to the Moss Lake Brook, across it was a wooden foot bridge.  The path afterwards diverged to Smithdown-lane.  The path-road also went on to Pembroke-place, along the present course of Crown-street.  I have heard my father speak of an attempt being made to rob him on passing over the stile which stood where now you find the King William Tavern.  He drew his sword (a weapon commonly worn by gentlemen of the time) which so frightened the thieves that they ran away, and, in their flight, went into a pit of water, into which my father also ran in the darkness which prevailed.  The thieves roared loudly for help, which my father did not stop to accord them.  He, being a good swimmer, soon got out, leaving the thieves to extricate themselves as they could.  There were several very pleasant country walks which went up to Low-hill through Brownlow-street, and by Love-lane (now Fairclough-lane).  I recollect going along Love-lane many a time with my dear wife, when we were sweethearting.  We used to go to Low-hill and thence along Everton-road (then called Everton-lane), on each side of which was a row of large trees, and we returned by Loggerhead's-lane (now Everton Crescent), and so home by Richmond-row, (called after Dr. Sylvester Richmond, a physician greatly esteemed and respected.)  I recollect very well the brook that ran along the present Byrom-street, whence the tannery on the right-hand side was supplied with water.  At the bottom of Richmond-row used to be the kennels of the Liverpool Hunt Club.  They were at one time kept on the North-shore.     CHAPTER II.   I was very sorry when the Ranelagh Gardens were broken up.  The owner, Mr. Gibson, was the brother of the Mr. Gibson who kept the Folly Gardens at the bottom of Folly-lane (now Islington) and top of Shaw's Brow (called after Mr. Alderman Shaw, the great potter, who lived in Dale-street, at the corner of Fontenoy-street--whose house is still standing).  Many a time have I played in the Folly Tea Gardens.  It was a pretty place, and great was the regret of the inhabitants of Liverpool when it was resolved to build upon it.  The Folly was closed in 1785. Mr. Philip Christian built his house, now standing at the corner of Christian-street, of the bricks of which the Tavern was constructed.  The Folly was a long two-storied house, with a tower or gazebo at one end. Gibson, it was said, was refused permission to extend the size of his house, so \"he built it upright,\" as he said \"he could not build it along.\"  The entrance to the Gardens was from Folly-lane, up a rather narrow passage.  I rather think the little passage at the back of the first house in Christian-street was a part of it.  You entered through a wooden door and went along a shrubberied path which led to the Tavern. Folly-lane (now Islington) was a narrow country lane, with fields and gardens on both sides.  I recollect there was a small gardener's cottage where the Friends' Institute now stands; and there was a lane alongside. That lane is now called \"King-street-lane, Soho.\"  I remember my mother, one Sunday, buying me a lot of apples for a penny, which were set out on a table at the gate.  There were a great many apple, pear, and damson trees in the garden.  When the Friends' Institute was building I heard of the discovery of an old cottage, which had been hidden from view as it were for many years.  I went to see it--the sight of it brought tears in my old eyes, for I recognised the place at once, and thought of my "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],["title","Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#1)"],["body"," instant.  \"Good boy now,\" cried the other.  \"Then shake hands properly,\" said Jack.  \"Give him the boot,\" cried Sepopo, as soon as his hand was untied, and he had gone through the required ceremony with his brother.  \"No, no; give him the boot,\" cried the other.  \"Hold your tongues,\" cried Jack.  \"I say, Dick, let's call them something else if they are going to stop with us, Sepopo!  Bechele! What names!\"  \"Well,\" said Dick, languidly, as he sat down in a weary fashion: \"one's going to be your boy, and the other mine.  Let's call them `Black Jack' and `Black Dick.'\"  \"But they are brown,\" said his brother.  \"Yes, they are brown certainly,\" said Dick, thoughtfully.  \"Regular coffee colour.  You might call one of them `Coffee.'\"  \"That'll do,\" said Jack, laughing, \"`Coffee!' and shorten it into `Cough.'  I say, Dick, I'll have that name, and I can tell people I've got a bad `Cough.'  But what will you call the other?\"  \"I don't know.  Stop a moment--`Chicory.'\"  \"And shorten it into `chick'.  That will do, Dick; splendid!  Cough and Chick.  Now you two, one of you is to be Cough and the other Chick; do you hear?\"  The Zulu boys nodded and laughed, though, in spite of the pretty good knowledge of the English language which they had picked up from their intercourse with the British settlers, it is doubtful whether they understood the drift.  What they did comprehend, however, was, that they should make friends; and this being settled, there was the old boot.  \"Give me boot, and show you big snake,\" cried Chicory.  \"No, no, give me; show more big snake,\" cried Coffee.  Just then Dinny came up with two old pairs of the lads' boots, which he threw down upon the sandy earth; and reading consent in their young masters' eyes, the Zulu lads pounced upon them with cries of triumph, Coffee obtaining the two rights, and Chicory the two lefts, with which they danced about, flourishing them over their heads with delight.  \"Come here, stupids!\" cried Jack; and after a little contention, the boys being exceedingly unwilling to part as they thought with their prizes, he managed to make them understand that the boots ought to go in pairs; and the exchange having been made, each boy holding on to a boot with one hand till he got a good grip of the other, they proceeded to put them on.  \"Ugh! the haythen bastes,\" said Dinny, with a look of disgust.  \"Think of the likes o' them wearing the young masthers' brogues.  Ah, Masther Dick, dear, ye'll be repinting it one of these days.\"  \"Dinny, you're a regular prophet of evil,\" said Dick, quietly.  \"Avic--prophet of avil!\" cried Dinny.  \"Well, isn't it the truth? Didn't I say avore we left the owld counthry that no good would come of it?  And avore we'd been out here two years didn't the dear misthress-- the saints make her bed in heaven--go and die right away?\"  \"Dinny! how can you!\" cried Jack, angrily, as he saw the tears start into his brother's eyes, and that in spite of the sunburning he turned haggard and pale.  \"Don't take any notice, Dick,\" he whispered, in a tender, loving way, as he laid one arm on his brother's shoulder and drew him aside.  \"Dinny don't mean any harm, Dick, but he has such a long tongue.\"  Dick looked piteously in his brother's face, and one tear stole softly down his cheek.  \"I say, Dick,\" cried Jack, imploringly, \"don't look like that.  It makes me think so of poor mamma.  You look so like her.  I say don't, or you'll make me cry too; and I won't,\" he cried, grinding his teeth.  \"I said I'd never cry again, because it's so childish; and I won't.\"  \"Then I'm childish, Jack,\" said Dick, as he rubbed the tear away with one hand.  \"No, no.  You have been so weak and delicate that you can't help it. I'm strong.  But I say, Dick, you are ever so much stronger than when we came out here.\"  \"Yes,\" said Dick, with a wistful look at his brother's muscular arms. \"I am stronger, but I do get tired so soon, Jack.\"  \"Not so soon as you did, Dick; and father says you'll be a strong man yet.  Hallo! what's the matter?  Look there.\"  The brothers turned round, and hardly knew whether to laugh or to be alarmed; for a short distance away there was Dinny dancing about, waving his arms and shouting, while Coffee and Chicory, each with his kiri, were making attacks and feints, striking at the Irishman fiercely.  \"Ah, would you, ye black baste?\" shouted Dinny, as roaring now with laughter the brothers ran back.  \"Shoo, Shoo! get out, you dirty-coloured spalpeen.  Ah, ye didn't.  Kape off wid you.  An' me widout a bit of shtick in me fist.  Masther Dick, dear!  Masther Jack! it's murthering me the two black Whiteboys are. Kape off!  Ah, would ye again!  Iv I'd me shtick I'd talk to ye both, and see if your heads weren't thick as a Tipperary boy's, I would. Masther Dick!  Masther Jack! they'll murther me avore they've done.\"  As aforesaid, the two Zulu boys had picked up a great deal of the English language, but their understanding thereof was sometimes very obscure.  In this instance they had heard Dinny talking to his young masters in a way that had made the tears come in Dick's eye, and driven him and Jack away.  This, in the estimation of the Zulu boys, must be through some act of cruelty or insult.  They did not like Dinny, who made no attempt to disguise his contempt for them as \"a pair of miserable young haythens,\" but at the same time they almost idolised the twin brothers as their superiors and masters, for whom they were almost ready to lay down their lives.  Here then was a cause for war.  Their nature was to love and fight, as dearly as the wildest Irishman who was ever born.  Dinny had offended their two \"bosses\"--as they called them, after the fashion of the Dutch Boers, and this set their blood on fire.  Hardly had the brothers walked away than, as if moved by the same spirit, they forgot the beauty of the old boots in which they had been parading--to such an extent that they kicked them off, and kiri in hand made so fierce an attack upon unarmed Dinny that, after a show of resistance, he fairly took to his heels and ran back to the house, just as the brothers came up.  \"Popo give him kiri,\" cried Chicory.  \"Bechele de boy make Boss Dinny run,\" cried the other, his eyes sparkling with delight.  \"No make de boss cry eye any more.\"  \"No make Boss Dick cry eye any more,\" repeated Chicory.  The brothers looked at each other as they comprehended the meaning of the attack.  \"Why, Jack,\" said Dick, \"what faithful true fellows they are.  They'll never leave us in a time of trouble.\"  \"No, that they won't,\" cried Jack; and just then a tall, stern, sunburnt man, with grizzled hair and saddened eyes, came up to where they stood. Laying his hand affectionately on the shoulder of Dick,--  \"Come, my boys,\" he said, \"dinner is ready.  Let's be punctual while we are leading a civilised life.\"  \"And afterwards, father, as punctual a life as we can,\" said Dick, smiling.  \"Hurray!\" cried Jack, giving his cap a wave in the air.  \"Only another week, and then, father--\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr Rogers, with a quiet, sad look, \"then, my boy, good-bye to civilisation.\"  \"Only for a time, father,\" said Dick, quietly.  \"Till you win health and strength, my boy,\" said Mr Rogers, with an affectionate glance.  \"And that we'll soon find,\" cried Jack; \"for we are off to the wilds.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  WHY THEY WENT AWAY.  It was about two years before this that Mr Edward Rogers, a gentleman holding a post of importance in the City of London, had purchased some land and come out to dwell in Natal.  For physician after physician had been consulted, seaside and health resort visited, but as the time glided on the verdict of the doctors became more and more apparent as a true saying, that unless Mrs Rogers was taken to a warmer climate her days would be few.  Even if she were removed the doctors said that she could not recover; but still her days might be prolonged.  What was more, they strongly advised such a course in favour of young Richard, who was weak and delicate to a degree.  \"Then you really consider it necessary?\" said Mr Rogers to the great physician who had been called in.  \"I do indeed.  As I have said, it will prolong your wife's days, and most probably it will turn that delicate, sickly boy into a strong man.\"  On being asked further what country he would recommend, he promptly replied,--  \"South Africa.\"  \"Natal is the place,\" he continued.  \"There you have the Drakensberg, and you can choose your own elevation, so as to get a pure, temperate climate, free from the cold of the mountains and the heat of the plains.\"  Mr Rogers was a man of prompt action, for the health of those dear to him was his first consideration.  The consequence was that after rapidly making his arrangements, and providing the necessaries for his new home, he took passage to Durban, arrived there in safety with his wife, two sons, and Dennis; then made his way to Maritzburg; and soon after he had purchased an extensive tract of land, and a pleasantly situated home, with garden in full perfection, the owner of which, having made money in the colony, wished to retire to England.  Here for a time Mrs Rogers had seemed better, and undoubtedly her life was considerably prolonged.  Gardening, farming, and a little hunting formed the occupations of the father and sons, and for a time all was happiness in the sunny far-off home.  Then the much-dreaded day came, and they were left to mourn for a tender wife and mother, whose loss was irreparable.  Richard, who partook greatly of his mother's nature, was, like his father, completely prostrated by the terrible loss; and though time somewhat assuaged his grief, he seemed to have gone back in his health, and lost the way he had made up since he left England, and he had become so weak and delicate that Mr Rogers had consulted the doctor, who from time to time visited their far-off home.  \"Medicine is of no use, my dear sir,\" he said frankly.  \"I can do him no good.  I suppose he sits"]]]
