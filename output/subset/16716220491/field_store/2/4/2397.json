I shouldn't wonder, now, if that chap was a slave-trader.\"  \"The same idea has occurred to myself, Disco,\" replied Harold, \"and I would willingly leave him if I thought there was a town or village within twenty miles of us; but we are ignorant on that point and I have heard enough of the African climate to believe that it might cost us our lives if we were obliged to spend a night in the jungle without fire, food, or covering, and with nothing on but a wet flannel shirt and pair of canvas breeches.  No, no, lad, we must not risk it.  Besides, although some Arabs are slave-traders, it does not follow that all are. This fellow may turn out better than he looks.\"  Disco Lillihammer experienced some sensations of surprise on hearing his young friend's remarks on the climate, for he knew nothing whatever about that of Africa, having sailed chiefly in the Arctic Seas as a whaler,--and laboured under the delusion that no climate under the sun could in any degree affect his hardy and well-seasoned frame.  He was too respectful, however, to let his thoughts be known.  Meanwhile the Arab returned.  \"I sail this night,\" he said, \"when moon go down.  That not far before midnight.  You mus keep by boat here--close.  If you go this way or that the niggers kill you.  They not come _here_; they know I is here.  I go look after my goods and chattels--my Black Ivory.\"  \"Mayn't we go with 'ee, mister--what's your name?\"  \"My name?--Yoosoof,\" replied the Arab, in a tone and with a look which were meant to command respect.  \"Well, Mister Yoosoof,\" continued Disco, \"if we may make bold to ax leave for to go with 'ee, we could lend 'ee a helpin' hand, d'ye see, to carry yer goods an' chattels down to the boat.\"  \"There is no need,\" said Yoosoof, waving his hand, and pointing to the hut before mentioned.  \"Go; you can rest till we sail.  Sleep; you will need it.  There is littil rice in hut--eat that, and make fire, dry youselfs.\"  So saying, the Arab left them by a path leading into the woods, along which his men, who were Portuguese half-castes, had preceded him.  \"Make fire indeed!\" exclaimed Disco, as he walked with his companion to the hut; \"one would think, from the free-and-easy way in which he tells us to make it, that he's in the habit himself of striking it out o' the point o' his own nose, or some such convenient fashion.\"  \"More likely to flash it out of his eyes, I should think,\" said Harold; \"but, see here, the fellow knew what he was talking about.  There is fire among these embers on the hearth.\"  \"That's true,\" replied Disco, going down on his knees, and blowing them carefully.  In a few minutes a spark leaped into a flame, wood was heaped on, and the flame speedily became a rousing fire, before which they dried their garments, while a pot of rice was put on to boil.  Scarcely had they proceeded thus far in their preparations, when two men, armed with muskets, were seen to approach, leading a negro girl between them.  As they drew nearer, it was observable that the girl had a brass ring round her neck, to which a rope was attached.  \"A slave!\" exclaimed Disco vehemently, while the blood rushed to his face; \"let's set her free!\"  The indignant seaman had half sprung to his legs before Harold seized and pulled him forcibly back.  \"Be quiet man,\" said Harold quickly.  \"If we _could_ free her by fighting, I would help you, but we can't.  Evidently we have got into a nest of slavers.  Rashness will only bring about our own death.  Be wise; bide your time, and we may live to do some good yet.\"  He stopped abruptly, for the new comers had reached the top of the winding path that led to the hut.  A look of intense surprise overspread the faces of the two men when they entered and saw the Englishmen sitting comfortably by the fire, and both, as if by instinct threw forward the muzzles of their muskets.  \"Oh! come in, come in, make your minds easy,\" cried Disco, in a half-savage tone, despite the warning he had received; \"we're all _friends_ here--leastwise we can't help ourselves.\"  Fortunately for our mariner the men did not understand him, and before they could make up their minds what to think of it, or how to act Harold rose, and, with a polite bow, invited them to enter.  \"Do you understand English?\" he asked.  A frown, and a decided shake of the head from both men, was the reply. The poor negro girl cowered behind her keepers, as if she feared that violence were about to ensue.  Having tried French with a like result, Harold uttered the name, \"Yoosoof,\" and pointed in the direction in which the trader had entered the woods.  The men looked intelligently at each other, and nodded.  Then Harold said \"Zanzibar,\" and pointed in the direction in which he supposed that island lay.  Again the men glanced at each other, and nodded.  Harold next said \"Boat--dhow,\" and pointed towards the creek, which remark and sign were received as before.  \"Good,\" he continued, slapping himself on the chest, and pointing to his companion, \"_I_ go to Zanzibar, _he_ goes, _she_ goes,\" (pointing to the girl), \"_you_ go, and Yoosoof goes--all in the dhow together to Zanzibar--to-night--when moon goes down.  D'ee understand?  Now then, come along and have some rice.\"  He finished up by slapping one of the men on the shoulder, and lifting the kettle off the fire, for the rice had already been cooked and only wanted warming.  The men looked once again at each other, nodded, laughed, and sat down on a log beside the fire, opposite to the Englishmen.  They were evidently much perplexed by the situation, and, not knowing what to make of it, were disposed in the meantime to be friendly.  While they were busy with the rice, Disco gazed in silent wonder, and with intense pity, at the slave-girl, who sat a little to one side of her guardians on a mat, her small hands folded together resting on one knee, her head drooping, and her eyes cast down.  The enthusiastic tar found it very difficult to restrain his feelings.  He had heard, of course, more or less about African slavery from shipmates, but he had never read about it, and had never seriously given his thoughts to it, although his native sense of freedom, justice, and fair-play had roused a feeling of indignation in his breast whenever the subject chanced to be discussed by him and his mates.  But now, for the first time in his life, suddenly and unexpectedly, he was brought face to face with slavery.  No wonder that he was deeply moved.  \"Why, Mister Seadrift,\" he said, in the confidential tone of one who imparts a new discovery, \"I do honestly confess to 'ee that I think that's a _pretty_ girl!\"  \"I quite agree with you,\" replied Harold, smiling.  \"Ay, but I mean _really_ pretty, you know.  I've always thought that all niggers had ugly flat noses an' thick blubber lips.  But look at that one: her lips are scarce a bit thicker than those of many a good-looking lass in England, and they don't stick out at all, and her nose ain't flat a bit.  It's quite as good as my Nancy's nose, an' that's sayin' a good deal, _I_ tell 'ee.  Moreover, she ain't black--she's brown.\"  It is but justice to Disco to say that he was right in his observations, and to explain that the various negro tribes in Africa differ very materially from each other; some of them, as we are told by Dr Livingstone, possessing little of what, in our eyes, seems the characteristic ugliness of the negro--such as thick lips, flat noses, protruding heels, etcetera,--but being in every sense handsome races of humanity.  The slave-girl whom Disco admired and pitied so much belonged to one of these tribes, and, as was afterwards ascertained, had been brought from the far interior.  She appeared to be very young, nevertheless there was a settled expression of meek sorrow and suffering on her face; and though handsomely formed, she was extremely thin, no doubt from prolonged hardships on the journey down to the coast.  \"Here, have somethin' to eat,\" exclaimed Disco, suddenly filling a tin plate with rice, and carrying it to the girl, who, however, shook her head without raising her eyes.  \"You're not hungry, poor thing,\" said the seaman, in a disappointed tone; \"you look as if you should be.  Come, try it,\" he added, stooping, and patting her head.  The poor child looked up as if frightened, and shrank from the seaman's touch, but on glancing a second time in his honest face, she appeared to feel confidence in him.  Nevertheless, she would not touch the rice until her guardians said something to her sternly, when she began to eat with an appetite that was eloquent.  \"Come, now, tell us what your name is, lass,\" said Disco, when she had finished the rice.  Of course the girl shook her head, but appeared to wish to understand the question, while the Portuguese laughed and seemed amused with the Englishman's eccentricities.  \"Look here, now,\" resumed the tar, slapping his own chest vigorously, \"Disco, Disco, Disco, that's me--Disco.  And this man,\" (patting his companion on the breast) \"is Harold, Harold, that's him--Harold.  Now, then,\" he added, pointing straight at the girl, \"you--what's you name, eh?\"  A gleam of intelligence shot from the girl's expressive eyes, and she displayed a double row of beautiful teeth as in a low soft voice she said--\"Azinte.\"  \"Azinte? come, that's not a bad name; why, it's a capital one.  Just suited to 'ee.  Well, Azinte, my poor girl,\" said Disco, with a fresh outburst of feeling, as he clenched his horny right hand and dashed it into the palm of his left, \"if I only knew how to set you free just now, my dear, I'd do it--ay, if I was to be roasted alive for so doin'.  I would!\"  \"You'll never set anybody free in this world,\" said Harold Seadrift, with some severity, \"if you go on talking and acting as you have done to-day.  If these men had not, by good fortune, been ignorant of our language, it's my opinion that they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21749"],["title","Man on the Ocean: A Book about Boats and Ships (#1)"],["body","know dimly from tradition, we know certainly and fully from the inspired Word of God.  The ark was built; the flood came; Noah with his family and two of every living creature entered into it; and for months the first ship floated on a sea whose shoreless waves flowed round and round the world.  What the ark's form was we cannot precisely tell; but we know its dimensions pretty accurately.  Although it was not intended for voyaging, the ark must necessarily have been a perfect model of a vessel, meant to float upon the waters.  To some extent, too, it must have been fitted to ride upon turbulent billows; for it \"went upon the face of the waters\" for upwards of seven months, and before it rested finally on the top of Mount Ararat, \"God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged.\"  In regard to its size, the most interesting way to consider it, perhaps, will be to compare it with the _Great Eastern_, the largest ship that has yet been built by man.  Assuming a cubit to be about 18 inches, the length of the ark was about 450 feet, its breadth about 75 feet, and its depth about 45 feet.  The _Great Eastern's_ length is 680 feet, its breadth 83 feet, and its depth from deck to keel 60 feet.  The ark was built of gopher-wood, which is thought by some to be pine, by others cedar.  It consisted of three stories, and had a window and a door, and was pitched within and without.  But it had neither masts nor rudder; and it is evident that, although it was man's refuge, the ark was not designed to be managed by man, for after Noah and his family had entered in, God took on himself the guidance and preservation of their vessel.  Thus our Saviour--of whom the ark was a type--specially guides and protects those who flee to him for refuge.  But although we have noticed the ark as being the first ship, we cannot with propriety place it in the front of the history of navigation. After the flood the ark seems to have been soon forgotten, or at least imperfectly remembered, and men reverted to their little canoes and clumsy boats, which sufficed for all their limited wants.  It was not until about a thousand years later in the world's history that men built ships of considerable size, and ventured on prolonged _coasting_- voyages, for the purposes of discovery and commerce.  Navigation had been practised, and the art of ship-building had made very considerable progress, long before men dared to lose sight of the shore and venture out upon the mysterious bosom of the great unknown sea.  To the ancients the Mediterranean was the ocean; and among its bays, and creeks, and islands, maritime enterprise sprang into being and rose into celebrity.  Among the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, and Hebrews, we find the earliest traces of navigation and commerce.  The first of these nations, occupying the narrow slip of land between Mount Lebanon and the Mediterranean, rose into fame as mariners between the years 1700 and 1100 before Christ--the renowned city of Sidon being their great sea-port, whence their ships put forth to trade with Cyprus and Rhodes, Greece, Sardinia, Sicily, Gaul, and Spain.  Little is known of the state of trade in those days, or of the form or size of ancient vessels. Homer tells us, in his account of the Trojan War, that the Phoenicians supplied the combatants with many articles of luxury; and from Scripture we learn that the same enterprising navigators brought gold to Solomon from Ophir in the year 1000 B.C.  A short time previous to this the Phoenicians ventured to pass through the Strait of Gibraltar, and for the first time beheld the great Atlantic Ocean.  Proceeding along the coast of Spain, they founded Cadiz; and, not long after, creeping down the western coast of Africa, established colonies there.  But their grandest feat was achieved about 600 years B.C., when they sailed down the Red Sea and the eastern coast of Africa, doubled the Cape of Good Hope, sailed up the western coast, and returned home by the Strait of Gibraltar.  Bartholomew Diaz must hide his diminished head before this fact; for, although he gets all the credit, the Phoenicians of old \"doubled the Cape\" at least twenty centuries before him!  That long voyages were made by the men of old, before authentic history began, seems highly probable.  The expedition of the _Argonauts_ to Colchis in the year 1250 B.C., in search of the \"Golden Fleece,\" is the first ancient voyage that lays claim to authenticity.  What the Golden Fleece was is uncertain; some think it was a term used to symbolise the mines of precious metals near the Black Sea.  Whatever it was, the _Argonauts_ went in search of it: whether or not they found it is unrecorded in history.  Jason, son of the King of Thessaly, was the leader of this expedition, which consisted of one ship and fifty men.  A man named _Argus_ built the ship, which from him was named the Argo, hence the name of _Argonauts_.  In treating of ancient vessels, we may as well proceed on the principle suggested by a sagacious child, who, when his mother was about to tell him a story, usually begged of her to \"bedin at the bedinning.\"  We shall begin at the beginning.    CHAPTER THREE.  RAFTS AND CANOES.  Rafts, as we have already remarked, must undoubtedly have been the beginning of navigation.  But they have not, like many other species of ancient craft, been altogether superseded by modern inventions.  True, we do not nowadays carry on war on rafts, but we still carry on trade with them in many parts of the world.  How the rafts of ancient times were formed we cannot tell precisely, though we can easily guess; but one thing we know, and that is, that the first improvement made in such craft was the thrusting of a few thick planks down into the water, to the depth of three or four feet, between the logs which composed the raft.  These acted the part of a keel, and, by pressing against the water _side-ways_ when a _side_ wind blew, prevented the raft from making much of what is called _leeway_--that is, drifting in the direction in which the wind happened to be blowing.  Some sorts of Dutch vessels use lee-boards for this purpose at the present time.  The rafts now in use on the great rivers of America are exceedingly curious in many respects.  One peculiarity of many of them is that they float _themselves_, not goods, to market--the pine logs of which they are constructed being the marketable commodity.  Some of these \"lumber-rafts,\" as they are called, are of great size; and as their navigators have often to spend many weeks on them, slowly floating down the rivers, they build huts or little cottages on them, cook their provisions on board, and, in short, spend night and day in their temporary floating-homes as comfortably as if they were on the land.  When these rafts approach a waterfall or a rapid, they unfasten the lashings and allow several logs tied together to run down at a time. After the rapid is passed, the loose logs are collected together, the raft is reconstructed, and the voyage down to the sea continued.  Of course, huts are built only on rafts which navigate the largest rivers, and are not thus liable to be taken to pieces.  When the logs reach the sea, they are shipped to various parts of the world where timber is scarce.  Large quantities are imported into Great Britain from Canada and other parts of America.  A bold thing has occasionally been done.  Instead of shipping the logs in vessels, enterprising and ingenious men built them into a _solid ship_, leaving a small space to serve as a cabin and a hold for provisions; then, erecting masts, they hoisted sail, and in this singular craft crossed the Atlantic.  On arriving at port they broke up their raft-ship and sold it.  The immense size of the rafts which are floated down some of the great rivers of the world may be gathered from the following engraving, which represents a raft on the Dwina, one of the great rivers of Russia.  Rafts, however, have not been confined to the purposes of traffic.  They have frequently been the means of saving the lives of shipwrecked mariners; but too often they have been the means only of prolonging the wretched existence of those who have ultimately perished at sea.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Turning now from the consideration of rafts, we shall describe canoes.  Canoes must, we think, have been invented after rafts.  They were formed, as we have said, out of logs, of bark and of skins stretched upon frames of wood.  Of ancient canoes we can say little.  But it is probable that they were similar in most respects to the canoes used by savage nations at the present time; for man, in his lowest or most savage condition, is necessarily the same now that he was in ancient times.  We shall, therefore, take a glance at the canoes of savage nations now existing, and thus shall form a good idea, we doubt not, of what canoes were in days of old.  Simplest among them all, perhaps, are the canoes of the North American Indians.  These are built of thin laths and ribs of wood, and are covered with the bark of the birch-tree.  The sheets of bark are not a quarter of an inch thick.  Several sheets are used in the covering of one canoe.  They are sewed together with the long pliant roots of the pine, and the seams are rendered tight with gum procured from the same tree.  So light are these canoes, that two men can carry on their shoulders one capable of holding eight or ten men, with their provisions, etcetera, for a voyage of many months.  They are of various sizes--from the hunting canoe which holds one Indian, to the largest canoe that carries fourteen.  They are propelled by short paddles instead of oars.  Many and terrible are the risks run by _voyageurs_ who travel through the lakes and rivers of North America in these canoes.  The following anecdote is related of a narrow escape made by some fur-traders while descending one of the rivers in the backwoods"]]]
