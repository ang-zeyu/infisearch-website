They were, moreover, the children of passion, sensuous,            worshipful of whatever lends itself to pleasure. How, then,            could the dramatic efforts of this primitive people, still in            the bonds of animalism, escape the note of passion? The songs            and other poetic pieces which have come down to us from the            remotest antiquity are generally inspired with a purer            sentiment and a loftier purpose than the modern; and it may            be said of them all that when they do step into the mud it is            not to tarry and wallow in it; it is rather with the            unconscious naiveté of a child thinking no evil.             On the principle of “the terminal conversion of opposites,”            which the author once heard an old philosopher expound, the            most advanced modern is better able to hark back to the            sweetness and light and music of the primeval world than the            veriest wigwam-dweller that ever chipped an arrowhead. It is            not so much what the primitive man can give us as what we can            find in him that is worth our while. The light that a Goethe,            a Thoreau, or a Kipling can project into Arcadia is mirrored            in his own nature.             If one mistakes not the temper and mind of this generation,            we are living in an age that is not content to let perish one            seed of thought or one single phase of life that can be            rescued from the drift of time. We mourn the extinction of            the buffalo of the plains and of the birds of the islands, [Page 13]  rightly thinking that life is somewhat less rich and full            without them. What of the people of the plains and of the            islands of the sea? Is their contribution so nothingless that            one can affirm that the orbit of man’s mind is complete            without it?             Comparison is unavoidable between the place held by the dance            in ancient Hawaii and that occupied by the dance in our            modern society. The ancient Hawaiians did not personally and            informally indulge in the dance for their own amusement, as            does pleasure-loving society at the present time. Like the            Shah of Persia, but for very different reasons, Hawaiians of            the old time left it to be done for them by a body of trained            and paid performers. This was not because the art and            practice of the hula were held in disrepute—quite the            reverse—but because the hula was an accomplishment requiring            special education and arduous training in both song and            dance, and more especially because it was a religious matter,            to be guarded against profanation by the observance of tabus            and the performance of priestly rites.             This fact, which we find paralleled in every form of communal            amusement, sport, and entertainment in ancient Hawaii, sheds            a strong light on the genius of the Hawaiian. We are wont to            think of the old-time Hawaiians as light-hearted children of            nature, given to spontaneous outbursts of song and dance as            the mood seized them; quite as the rustics of “merrie            England” joined hands and tripped “the light fantastic toe”            in the joyous month of May or shouted the harvest home at a            later season. The genius of the Hawaiian was different. With            him the dance was an affair of premeditation, an organized            effort, guarded by the traditions of a somber religion. And            this characteristic, with qualifications, will be found to            belong to popular Hawaiian sport and amusement of every            variety. Exception must be made, of course, of the            unorganized sports of childhood. One is almost inclined to            generalize and to say that those children of nature, as we            are wont to call them, in this regard were less free and            spontaneous than the more advanced race to which we are proud            to belong. But if the approaches to the temple of Terpsichore            with them were more guarded, we may confidently assert that            their enjoyment therein was deeper and more abandoned.  [Page 14]                     II.—THE HALAU; THE KUAHU—THEIR DECORATION                                 AND CONSECRATION                                     THE HALAU             In building a halau, or hall, in which to perform the hula a            Hawaiian of the old, old time was making a temple for his            god. In later and degenerate ages almost any structure would            serve the purpose; it might be a flimsy shed or an            extemporaneous _lanai_ such as is used to shelter that _al            fresco_ entertainment, the _luau_. But in the old times of            strict tabu and rigorous etiquette, when the chief had but to            lift his hand and the entire population of a district            ransacked plain, valley, and mountain to collect the poles,            beams, thatch, and cordstuff; when the workers were so            numerous that the structure grew and took shape in a day, we            may well believe that ambitious and punctilious patrons of            the hula, such as La’a, Liloa, or Lono-i-ka-makahiki, did not            allow the divine art of Laka to house in a barn.             The choice of a site was a matter of prime importance. A            formidable code enunciated the principles governing the            selection. But—a matter of great solicitude—there were            omens to be heeded, snares and pitfalls devised by the            superstitious mind for its own entanglement. The untimely            sneeze, the ophthalmic eye, the hunched back were omens to be            shunned.             Within historic times, since the abrogation of the tabu            system and the loosening of the old polytheistic ideas, there            has been in the hula a lowering of former standards, in some            respects a degeneration. The old gods, however, were not            entirely dethroned; the people of the hula still continued to            maintain the form of divine service and still appealed to            them for good luck; but the soul of worship had exhaled; the            main study now was to make of the hula a pecuniary success.             In an important sense the old way was in sympathy with the            thought, “Except God be with the workmen, they labor in vain            that build the house.” The means for gaining divine favor and            averting the frown of the gods were those practised by all            religionists in the infantile state of the human mind—the            observance of fasts and tabus, the offering of special            prayers and sacrifices. The ceremonial purification of the            site, or of the building if it had been used for profane            purposes, was accomplished by aspersions with sea water mixed            with turmeric or red earth. [Page 15]            When one considers the tenacious hold which all rites and            ceremonies growing out of what we are accustomed to call            superstitions had on the mind of the primitive Hawaiian, it            puzzles one to account for the entire dropping out from            modern memory of the prayers which were recited during the            erection of a hall for the shelter of an institution so            festive and so popular as the hula, while the prayers and            gloomy ritual of the temple service have survived. The            explanation may be found, perhaps, in the fact that the            priests of the temple held position by the sovereign’s            appointment; they formed a hierarchy by themselves, whereas            the position of the _kumu-hula_, who was also a priest, was            open to anyone who fitted himself for it by training and            study and by passing successfully the _ai-lolo_[2] ordeal.            After that he had the right to approach the altar of the hula            god with the prescribed offerings and to present the prayers            and petitions of the company to Laka or Kapo.             [Footnote 2: _Ai-lolo_. See pp. 32, 34, 36.]             In pleasing contrast to the worship of the _heiau_, the            service of the hula was not marred by the presence of            groaning victims and bloody sacrifices. Instead we find the            offerings to have been mostly rustic tokens, things entirely            consistent with light-heartedness, joy, and ecstasy of            devotion, as if to celebrate the fact that heaven had come            down to earth and Pan, with all the nymphs, was dancing.             During the time the halau was building the tabus and rules            that regulated conduct were enforced with the utmost            strictness. The members of the company were required to            maintain the greatest propriety of demeanor, to suppress all            rudeness of speech and manner, to abstain from all carnal            indulgence, to deny themselves specified articles of food,            and above all to avoid contact with a corpse. If anyone, even            by accident, suffered such defilement, before being received            again into fellowship or permitted to enter the halau and            take part in the exercises he must have ceremonial cleansing            (_huikala_). The _kumu_ offered up prayers, sprinkled the            offender with salt water and turmeric, commanded him to bathe            in the ocean, and he was clean. If the breach of discipline            was gross and willful, an act of outrageous violence or the            neglect of tabu, the offender could be restored only after            penitence"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/203"],["title","Uncle Tom's Cabin (#1)"],["body","an article, now! You might make your fortune on that ar gal in Orleans, any day. I’ve seen over a thousand, in my day, paid down for gals not a bit handsomer.”  “I don’t want to make my fortune on her,” said Mr. Shelby, dryly; and, seeking to turn the conversation, he uncorked a bottle of fresh wine, and asked his companion’s opinion of it.  “Capital, sir,—first chop!” said the trader; then turning, and slapping his hand familiarly on Shelby’s shoulder, he added—  “Come, how will you trade about the gal?—what shall I say for her—what’ll you take?”  “Mr. Haley, she is not to be sold,” said Shelby. “My wife would not part with her for her weight in gold.”  “Ay, ay! women always say such things, cause they ha’nt no sort of calculation. Just show ’em how many watches, feathers, and trinkets, one’s weight in gold would buy, and that alters the case, _I_ reckon.”  “I tell you, Haley, this must not be spoken of; I say no, and I mean no,” said Shelby, decidedly.  “Well, you’ll let me have the boy, though,” said the trader; “you must own I’ve come down pretty handsomely for him.”  “What on earth can you want with the child?” said Shelby.  “Why, I’ve got a friend that’s going into this yer branch of the business—wants to buy up handsome boys to raise for the market. Fancy articles entirely—sell for waiters, and so on, to rich ’uns, that can pay for handsome ’uns. It sets off one of yer great places—a real handsome boy to open door, wait, and tend. They fetch a good sum; and this little devil is such a comical, musical concern, he’s just the article!’  “I would rather not sell him,” said Mr. Shelby, thoughtfully; “the fact is, sir, I’m a humane man, and I hate to take the boy from his mother, sir.”  “O, you do?—La! yes—something of that ar natur. I understand, perfectly. It is mighty onpleasant getting on with women, sometimes, I al’ays hates these yer screechin,’ screamin’ times. They are _mighty_ onpleasant; but, as I manages business, I generally avoids ’em, sir. Now, what if you get the girl off for a day, or a week, or so; then the thing’s done quietly,—all over before she comes home. Your wife might get her some ear-rings, or a new gown, or some such truck, to make up with her.”  “I’m afraid not.”  “Lor bless ye, yes! These critters ain’t like white folks, you know; they gets over things, only manage right. Now, they say,” said Haley, assuming a candid and confidential air, “that this kind o’ trade is hardening to the feelings; but I never found it so. Fact is, I never could do things up the way some fellers manage the business. I’ve seen ’em as would pull a woman’s child out of her arms, and set him up to sell, and she screechin’ like mad all the time;—very bad policy—damages the article—makes ’em quite unfit for service sometimes. I knew a real handsome gal once, in Orleans, as was entirely ruined by this sort o’ handling. The fellow that was trading for her didn’t want her baby; and she was one of your real high sort, when her blood was up. I tell you, she squeezed up her child in her arms, and talked, and went on real awful. It kinder makes my blood run cold to think of ’t; and when they carried off the child, and locked her up, she jest went ravin’ mad, and died in a week. Clear waste, sir, of a thousand dollars, just for want of management,—there’s where ’t is. It’s always best to do the humane thing, sir; that’s been _my_ experience.” And the trader leaned back in his chair, and folded his arm, with an air of virtuous decision, apparently considering himself a second Wilberforce.  The subject appeared to interest the gentleman deeply; for while Mr. Shelby was thoughtfully peeling an orange, Haley broke out afresh, with becoming diffidence, but as if actually driven by the force of truth to say a few words more.  “It don’t look well, now, for a feller to be praisin’ himself; but I say it jest because it’s the truth. I believe I’m reckoned to bring in about the finest droves of niggers that is brought in,—at least, I’ve been told so; if I have once, I reckon I have a hundred times,—all in good case,—fat and likely, and I lose as few as any man in the business. And I lays it all to my management, sir; and humanity, sir, I may say, is the great pillar of _my_ management.”  Mr. Shelby did not know what to say, and so he said, “Indeed!”  “Now, I’ve been laughed at for my notions, sir, and I’ve been talked to. They an’t pop’lar, and they an’t common; but I stuck to ’em, sir; I’ve stuck to ’em, and realized well on ’em; yes, sir, they have paid their passage, I may say,” and the trader laughed at his joke.  There was something so piquant and original in these elucidations of humanity, that Mr. Shelby could not help laughing in company. Perhaps you laugh too, dear reader; but you know humanity comes out in a variety of strange forms now-a-days, and there is no end to the odd things that humane people will say and do.  Mr. Shelby’s laugh encouraged the trader to proceed.  “It’s strange, now, but I never could beat this into people’s heads. Now, there was Tom Loker, my old partner, down in Natchez; he was a clever fellow, Tom was, only the very devil with niggers,—on principle ’t was, you see, for a better hearted feller never broke bread; ’t was his _system_, sir. I used to talk to Tom. ‘Why, Tom,’ I used to say, ‘when your gals takes on and cry, what’s the use o’ crackin on’ ’em over the head, and knockin’ on ’em round? It’s ridiculous,’ says I, ‘and don’t do no sort o’ good. Why, I don’t see no harm in their cryin’,’ says I; ’it’s natur,’ says I, ‘and if natur can’t blow off one way, it will another. Besides, Tom,’ says I, ‘it jest spiles your gals; they get sickly, and down in the mouth; and sometimes they gets ugly,—particular yallow gals do,—and it’s the devil and all gettin’ on ’em broke in. Now,’ says I, ‘why can’t you kinder coax ’em up, and speak ’em fair? Depend on it, Tom, a little humanity, thrown in along, goes a heap further than all your jawin’ and crackin’; and it pays better,’ says I, ‘depend on ’t.’ But Tom couldn’t get the hang on ’t; and he spiled so many for me, that I had to break off with him, though he was a good-hearted fellow, and as fair a business hand as is goin’.”  “And do you find your ways of managing do the business better than Tom’s?” said Mr. Shelby.  “Why, yes, sir, I may say so. You see, when I any ways can, I takes a leetle care about the onpleasant parts, like selling young uns and that,—get the gals out of the way—out of sight, out of mind, you know,—and when it’s clean done, and can’t be helped, they naturally gets used to it. ’Tan’t, you know, as if it was white folks, that’s brought up in the way of ’spectin’ to keep their children and wives, and all that. Niggers, you know, that’s fetched up properly, ha’n’t no kind of ’spectations of no kind; so all these things comes easier.”  “I’m afraid mine are not properly brought up, then,” said Mr. Shelby.  “S’pose not; you Kentucky folks spile your niggers. You mean well by ’em, but ’tan’t no real kindness, arter all. Now, a nigger, you see, what’s got to be hacked and tumbled round the world, and sold to Tom, and Dick, and the Lord knows who, ’tan’t no kindness to be givin’ on him notions and expectations, and bringin’ on him up too well, for the rough and tumble comes all the harder on him arter. Now, I venture to say, your niggers would be quite chop-fallen in a place where some of your plantation niggers would be singing and whooping like all possessed. Every man, you know, Mr. Shelby, naturally thinks well of his own ways; and I think I treat niggers just about as well as it’s ever worth while to treat ’em.”  “It’s a happy thing to be satisfied,” said Mr. Shelby, with a slight shrug, and some perceptible feelings of a disagreeable nature.  “Well,” said Haley, after they had both silently picked their nuts for a season, “what do you say?”  “I’ll think the matter over, and talk with my wife,” said Mr. Shelby. “Meantime, Haley, if you want the matter carried on in the quiet way you speak of, you’d best not let your business in this neighborhood be known. It will get out among my boys, and it will not be a particularly quiet business getting away any of my fellows, if they know it, I’ll promise you.”  “O! certainly, by all means, mum! of course. But I’ll tell you. I’m in a devil of a hurry, and shall want to know, as soon as possible, what I may depend on,” said he, rising and putting on his overcoat.  “Well, call up this evening, between six and seven, and you shall have my answer,” said Mr. Shelby, and the trader bowed himself out of the apartment.  “I’d like to have been able to kick the fellow down the steps,” said he to himself, as he saw the door fairly closed, “with his impudent assurance; but he knows how much he has me at advantage. If anybody had ever said to me that I should sell Tom down south to one of those rascally traders, I should have said, ’Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?’ And now it must come, for aught I see. And Eliza’s child, too! I know that I shall have some fuss with wife about that; and, for that matter, about Tom, too. So much for being in debt,—heigho! The fellow sees his advantage, and means to push it.”  Perhaps the mildest form of the system of slavery is to be seen in the State of Kentucky. The general prevalence of agricultural pursuits of a quiet and gradual nature, not requiring those periodic seasons of hurry and pressure that are called for in the business of more southern districts, makes the task of the negro a more healthful and reasonable one; while the master, content with a more gradual style of acquisition, has not those temptations to hardheartedness which always overcome frail human nature when the prospect of sudden and rapid gain is weighed in the balance, with no heavier counterpoise than the interests of the helpless and unprotected.
