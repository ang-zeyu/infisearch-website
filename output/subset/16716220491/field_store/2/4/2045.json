He thought it best to keep quiet until Herbert Murray should be gone.  Chivey struggled up on to his knees.  Then he began to crawl along the sand pit.  Progress was difficult at first.  But he persevered and got along in time.  \"If these bruises would only let me think how further to act,\" he muttered to himself, as groaning, he crawled back to the town.  \"Señor Velasquez,\" he said to himself, as a happy thought crossed him. \"Señor Velasquez is my man for a million.\"  He paused to think over the ways and means, and a cunning smile deepened on his face, as he gradually made up his mind.  \"The worst of this is that I must have a confederate,\" muttered the young schemer.  \"No matter, there is only one way out of it, and I must make the best of it.\"  Señor Velasquez was an obscure notary.  Chivey had made a chatting acquaintance with the notary in the town, the Spaniard speaking English with tolerable proficiency.  \"What is the nature of the secret you hold _in terrorem_ over your master?\" demanded the notary, when Chivey at length reached his office.  Chivey smiled.  \"I said it was a secret, Mr. Velasquez,\" he answered.  \"But if you seek my advice about that,\" the notary made reply, \"I must know all the particulars of the case.\"  \"Oh, no.\"  \"Oh, yes.\"  \"Why?\"  \"How can I advise if you keep me in the dark?\"  Chivey leered at the Spanish notary and grinned.  \"Don't you try and come the old soldier over me, please,\" he said.  \"Old soldier?\" said Señor Velasquez, in surprise.  \"Yes.\"  \"What is 'old soldier?' What do you mean by that?\"  \"I mean, sir, the artful.\"  \"Is this English?\" exclaimed the notary.  \"Rather.\"  \"Well, I confess I do not understand it.\"  \"Then,\" said Chivey, getting quite cheerful as he warmed into the matter, \"I think your English education has been very seriously neglected, that's what I think.\"  \"Possibly,\" said the Spaniard. \"I only learnt your tongue as a student, and am not well grounded in slang.\"  \"More's the pity.\"  There was a spice of contempt in Chivey's tone which appeared rather to aggravate Señor Velasquez.  \"You are too clever, Mr. Chivey,\" said he, \"far too clever. Now you want to keep your secret, and I shall guess that your secret concerns----\"  He paused.  \"Who?\" asked Chivey.  \"The young man whose letters you employed me to intercept.\"  The tiger looked alarmed.  \"I mean the young Señor Jack Harkaway.\"  Chivey looked about him rather anxiously.  \"Don't be so imprudent, Señor Velasquez,\" he said. \"You are a precious dangerous party to have any thing to do with.\"  \"Not I,\" returned Señor Velasquez; \"I am easily dealt with. But those who would deal with me must not be too cunning.\"  \"You don't find nothing of that sort about me,\" said Chivey.  \"What is it you require of me?\" demanded the notary, getting vexed.  \"He's a proud old cove,\" thought the tiger.  So he drew in his horns and met the notary half way.  \"You are just right, Mr. Velasquez,\" he remarked. \"It does concern Jack Harkaway.\"  \"I knew that.\"  \"Now I want you to give me your promise not to tell what I am going to say to you, nor to make any use of it without my express permission.\"  \"I promise. Now proceed, for I am pressed for time.\"  \"I will,\" said the tiger, resolutely.  The notary produced paper and writing materials.  \"My master, Mr. Murray, has attempted my life,\" began Chivey, \"and this is because I am possessed of certain secrets.\"  \"I see.\"  \"He is at the present moment under the idea that he has killed me. Now what I want is, to make him thoroughly understand that he does not get out of his difficulty by getting me out of the way, not by any manner of means at all.\"  \"I see.\"  \"How will you do it?\"  \"I will go and see him.\"  Chivey jumped at the idea immediately.  \"Yes, sir, that's the sort; there's no letters then to tell tales against us.\"  \"None.\"  \"Get one from him, though, if you can,\" said Chivey, eagerly; \"something compromising him yet deeper, like.\"  \"I will do it,\" said Señor Velasquez. \"And what will you pay for it? Give it a price.\"  \"Thirty pounds,\" returned Chivey, in a feverish state of anxiety.  \"I'll do it,\" returned the notary, with great coolness.     CHAPTER LXII.  HOW SEÑOR VELASQUEZ PLAYED A DEEP GAME WITH CHIVEY--DOUBLE DEALING--HERBERT MURRAY'S CHANCE--\"HARKAWAY MUST BE PUT AWAY\"--A GUILTY COMPACT--CHIVEY IN DURANCE VILE--THE SICK ROOM AND THE OPIATE--AN OVERDOSE--THE NOTARY'S GUARDIAN--THE SPANISH GAROTTE--\"TALKING IN YOUR SLEEP IS A VERY BAD GAME.\"   Señor Velasquez was any thing but a fool.  Chivey was not soft, but he was not competent to cope with such a keen spirit as this Spanish notary.  Señor Velasquez walked up to the hotel in which Herbert Murray was staying, and the first person he chanced to meet was Murray himself.  \"I wish to have a word with you in private, Señor Murray,\" said the notary.  Murray looked anxiously around him, starting \"like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons.\"  The bland smile of the Spanish notary reassured him, however.  \"What can I do for Señor Velasquez?\" he asked.  \"I begged for a few words in private,\" answered Velasquez.  \"Take a seat, Señor Velasquez,\" said Herbert Murray, \"and now tell me how I can serve you,\" after entering his room.  The notary made himself comfortable in his chair.  \"I can speak in safety now?\" he said.  \"Of course.\"  \"No fear of interruption here?\"  The notary looked Murray steadily in the eyes as he said--  \"I was thinking of your officious servant.\"  Herbert Murray changed colour as he faltered--  \"Of whom?\"  \"Chivey, I think you call him--your groom, I mean.\"  \"There is no fear from him now,\" said Murray, with averted eyes; \"not the least in the world.\"  Señor Velasquez smiled significantly.  \"Your man Chivey,\" resumed the Spanish notary, \"has confided to me a secret.\"  \"Concerning me?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"The villain!\"  \"Now listen to me, Señor Murray. You have behaved very imprudently indeed. Your whole secret is with me.\"  Herbert started.  \"With you?\"  \"Yes.\"  Herbert Murray glanced anxiously at the door.  The notary followed his eyes with some inward anxiety, yet he did not betray his uneasiness at all.  \"He was speaking the truth for once, then,\" said Murray. \"He had confided his secrets to someone else.\"  \"Yes.\"  Herbert Murray walked round the room, and took up his position with his back to the door.  \"Señor Velasquez,\" he said, in a low but determined voice, \"you have made an unfortunate admission. If there is a witness, it is only one; you are that witness, and your life is in danger.\"  The notary certainly felt uncomfortable, but he was too old a stager to display it.  Herbert Murray produced a pistol, which he proceeded to examine and to cock deliberately.  \"That would not advance your purpose much, Señor Murray,\" he said, coolly; \"the noise would bring all the house trooping into the room.\"  Murray was quite calm and collected now, and therefore he was open to reason.  \"There is something in that,\" he said, \"so I have a quieter helpmate here.\"  He uncocked the pistol and put it in his breast pocket.  Then he whipped out a long Spanish stiletto.  \"There are other reasons against using that.\"  \"And they are?\"  \"Here is one,\" returned the notary, drawing a long, slender blade from his sleeve.  Murray was palpably disconcerted at this.  The Spanish notary and the young Englishman stood facing each other in silence for a considerable time.  The former was the first to break the silence.  \"Now, look you here, Señor Murray,\" said he, \"I am not a child, nor did I, knowing all I know, come here unprepared for every emergency--aye, even for violence.\"  \"Go on,\" said Murray, between his set teeth.  \"You have imprudently placed yourself in the hands of an unscrupulous young man.\"  \"I have.\"  \"And he has proved himself utterly unworthy?\"  \"Utterly.\"  \"All of that is known to me,\" said the notary, craftily. \"Now you must pay no heed to this Chivey.\"  \"I will not,\" returned Herbert Murray, significantly, \"though there is little fear of further molestation from him, señor.\"  Young Murray little dreamt of the cause of the notary's peculiar smile.  \"Your sole danger, as I take it, Señor Murray, is from your fellow countryman, Jack Harkaway.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then to him you must direct your attention. Where is he?\"  \"Gone.\"  \"Where to?\"  \"Don't know.\"  \"I do then,\" returned the notary, quietly: \"and it is to tell you that that I am here. I have all the necessary information; you must follow him.\"  \"Why?\"  \"To make sure of him,\" coldly replied the Spaniard.  \"How?\"  Velasquez spoke not.  But his meaning was just as clear as if he had put it into words.  A vicious dig with his stiletto at the air.  Nothing more.  And so they began to understand each other.                    *          *          *          *  Señor Velasquez, the notary, was playing a double game.  From Herbert Murray he carefully kept the knowledge that Chivey still lived.  And why?  That knowledge would have lessened his hold.  The cunning way in which he let Herbert Murray understand that he knew all, even to the attempt upon Chivey's life at the gravel pits, completed the mastery in which he meant to hold the young rascal.  He arranged everything for young Murray.  He discovered from him the destination of the ship in which Jack Harkaway and his friends had escaped, and he procured him a berth on a vessel sailing in the same direction.  \"Once you get within arm's length of this young Harkaway,\" he said; \"you must be firm and let your blow be sure.\"  \"I will,\" returned his pupil.  \"Once Harkaway is removed from your path, you may sleep in peace, for he alone can now punish you for forgery.\"  \"I hope so.\"  \"I know it,\" said Velasquez.  So well were the notary's plans laid, and so luckily did fortune play into his hands, that forty-eight hours after his interview with Murray, he had that young gentleman safely on board a ship outward bound.  Now Herbert Murray had passed but one night after that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20335"],["title","The Case of Edith Cavell (#1)"],["body","of the territory. The question of the guilt or innocence of each individual was a matter of no importance. Hostages were taken and not for the alleged wrongs of others.  Did not General von Bülow on August 22nd announce to the inhabitants of Liège that       \"_it is with my consent that the General in command has burned down      the place [Andenne] and shot about 100 inhabitants._\"  It was the same chivalrous and humane General who posted a proclamation at Namur on August 25th as follows:       \"Before 4 o'clock all Belgian and French soldiers are to be      delivered up as prisoners of war. Citizens who do not obey this      will be condemned to hard labor for life in Germany. At 4 o'clock a      rigorous inspection of all houses will be made. _Every soldier      found will be shot._ * * * _The streets will be held by German      guards, who will hold ten hostages for each street. These hostages      will be shot if there is any trouble in that street._ * * * A crime      against the German Army will compromise the existence of the whole      town of Namur _and every one in it_.\"  Did not Field Marshal von der Goltz issue a proclamation in Brussels, on October 5th, stating that, if any individual disturbed the telegraphic or railway communications, all the inhabitants would be \"_punished without pity, the innocent suffering with the guilty_\"?  Individual guilt being thus a matter of minor importance, Dr. Zimmermann had no occasion on the accepted theory of Prussian militarism to justify the secret trial and midnight execution of Edith Cavell. Indeed, he freely intimates that his Government will not spare women, no matter how high and noble the motive may have been which inspires any infraction of military law, and to this sweeping statement he makes but one exception, namely, that women \"in a delicate condition may not be executed.\" But why the exception? If it be permitted to destroy one life for the welfare of the military administration of Belgium, why stop at two? If the innocent living are to be sacrificed, why spare the unborn? The exception itself shows that the rigor of military law must have some limitation, and that its iron rigor must be softened by a discretion dictated by such considerations of chivalry and magnanimity as have hitherto been observed by all civilized nations. If the victim of yesterday had been an \"expectant mother,\" Dr. Zimmermann suggests that her judges and executioners would have spared her, but no such exception can be found in the Prussian military code. \"It is not so nominated in the bond,\" and the Under Secretary's recognition of one exception, based upon considerations of humanity and not the letter of the military code, destroys the whole fabric of his case, _for it clearly shows that there was a power of discretion which von Bissing could have exercised, if he had so elected_.  That her case had its claims not only to magnanimity, but even to military justice, is shown by the haste with which, in the teeth of every protest, the unfortunate woman was hurried to her end. Sentenced at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, she was executed nine hours later. Of what was General Baron von Bissing afraid? She was in his custody. Her power to help her country--save by dying--was forever at an end. The hot haste of her execution and the duplicity and secrecy which attended it betray an unmistakable fear that if her life had been spared until the world could have known of her death sentence, public opinion would have prevented this cruel and cowardly deed. The labored apology of Dr. Zimmermann and the swift action of the Kaiser in pardoning those who were condemned with Miss Cavell indicate that the Prussian officials have heard the beating of the wings of those avenging angels of history who, like the Eumenides of classic mythology, are the avengers of the innocent and the oppressed.  \"_Greatness_,\" wrote Aeschylus, \"_is no defense from utter destruction when a man insolently spurns the mighty altar of justice_.\"  This is as true to-day as when it was written more than two thousand years ago. It is but a classic echo of the old Hebraic moral axiom that \"the Lord God of recompenses shall surely requite.\"  The most powerful and self-willed ruler of modern times learned this lesson to his cost. Probably no two instances contributed so powerfully to the ultimate downfall of Napoleon as his ruthless assassination under the forms of military law of the Duke d'Enghien and the equally brutal murder of the German bookseller, Palm. The one aroused the undying enmity of Russia, and the blood that was shed in the moat of Vincennes was washed out in the icy waters of the Beresina. The fate of the poor German bookseller, whom Napoleon caused to be shot because his writing menaced the security of French occupation, developed as no other event the dormant spirit of German nationality, and the Nuremberg bookseller, shot precisely as was Miss Cavell, was finally avenged when Blücher gave Napoleon the _coup de grâce_ at Waterloo. No one more clearly felt the invisible presence of his Nemesis than did Napoleon. All his life, and even in his confinement at St. Helena, he was ceaselessly attempting to justify to the moral conscience of the world his ruthless assassination of the last Prince of the house of Condé. The terrible judgment of history was never better expressed than by Lamartine in the following language:       \"A cold curiosity carries the visitor to the battlefields of      Marengo, Austerlitz, Wagram, Leipsic, Waterloo; he wanders over      them with dry eyes, but one is shown at a corner of the wall near      the foundations of Vincennes, at the bottom of a ditch, a spot      covered with nettles and weeds. He says, 'There it is!' He utters a      cry and carries away with him undying pity for the victim and an      implacable resentment against the assassin. This resentment is      vengeance for the past and a lesson for the future. _Let the      ambitious, whether soldiers, tribunes, or kings, remember that if      they have hirelings to do their will, and flatterers to excuse      them while they reign, there yet comes afterward a human conscience      to judge them and pity to hate them. The murderer has but one hour;      the victim has eternity._\"  At the outbreak of the war Miss Cavell was living with her aged mother in England. Constrained by a noble and imperious sense of duty, she exchanged the security of her native country for her post of danger in Brussels. \"My duty is there,\" she said simply.  She reached Brussels in August, 1914, and at once commenced her humanitarian work. When the German army entered the gates of Brussels, she called upon Governor von Luttwitz and placed her staff of nurses at the services of the wounded under whatever flag they had fought. The services which she and her staff of nurses rendered many a wounded and dying German should have earned for her the generous consideration of the invader.  But early in these ministrations of mercy she was obliged by the noblest of humanitarian motives to antagonize the German invaders. Governor von Luttwitz demanded of her that all nurses should give formal undertakings, when treating wounded French or Belgian soldiers, to act as jailers to their patients, but Miss Cavell answered this unreasonable demand by simply saying: \"We are prepared to do all that we can to help wounded soldiers to recover, but to be their jailers--never.\"  On another occasion, when appealing to a German Brigadier-General on behalf of some homeless women and children, the Prussian martinet--half pedant and half poltroon--answered her with a quotation from Nietzsche to the effect that \"Pity is a waste of feeling--a moral parasite injurious to the health.\" She early felt the cruel and iron will of the invader, but, nothing daunted, she proceeded in the arduous work, supervised the work of three hospitals, gave six lectures on nursing a week and responded to many urgent appeals of individuals who were in need of immediate relief. \"Others she saved, herself she could not save.\"  When one of her associates, Miss Mary Boyle O'Reilly, who has recently contributed a moving account of Miss Cavell's work, was expelled from Belgium, she begged Miss Cavell to take the opportunity, while it presented itself, to leave that land of horror, and Miss Cavell, with characteristic bravery, replied smilingly: \"Impossible, my friend, my duty is here.\"  It was undoubtedly in connection with this humanitarian work that she violated the German military law by giving refuge to fugitive French and Belgian soldiers until such time as they could escape across the frontier to Holland. For this she suffered the penalty of death, and the validity of this sentence, even under Prussian military law, I will discuss later. It is enough to say that no instinct is so natural in every man and woman, and especially in woman with the maternal instinct characteristic of her sex, than to give a harbor of refuge to the helpless. All nations have respected this instinctive feeling as one of the redeeming traits of human nature and the history of war, at least in modern times, can be searched in vain for any instance in which anyone, especially a woman, has been condemned to death for yielding to the humanitarian impulse of giving temporary refuge to a fugitive soldier. Such an act is neither espionage nor treason, as those terms have been ordinarily understood in civilized countries.  It is true, as suggested by a few in America who sought to excuse the Cavell crime, that Mrs. Surratt was tried, condemned and executed because she had permitted the band of assassins, whose conspiracy resulted in the assassination of Lincoln and the attempted murder of Secretary Seward, to hold their meetings in her house; but the difference between this conscious participation in the assassination of the head of the State, in a period of civil war, and the humanitarian aid which Miss Cavell gave to"]]]
