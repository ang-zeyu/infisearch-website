The name \"music\" contains two ideas, both of them important in our modern use of the term: The general meaning is that of \"a pleasing modulation of sounds.\" In this sense the term is used constantly by poets, novelists and even in conversation--as when we speak of the \"music of the forest,\" the \"music of the brook\" or the \"music of nature.\" There is also a reminiscence of the etymological derivation of the term, as something derived from the \"Muses,\" the fabled retinue of the Greek god Apollo, who presided over all the higher operations of the mind and imagination. Thus the name \"music,\" when applied to an art, contains a suggestion of an inspiration, a something derived from a special inner light, or from a higher source outside the composer, as all true imagination seems to be to those who exercise it.  2. Music has to do with tones, sounds selected on account of their musical quality and relations. These tones, again, before becoming music in the artistic sense, must be so joined together, set in order, controlled by the human imagination, that they express sentiment. Every manifestation of musical art has in it these two elements: _The fit selection_ of tones; and, second, the _use of them for expressing sentiment and feeling_. Hence the practical art of music, like every other fine art, has in it two elements, an _outer_, or technical, where trained intelligence rules, and teaching and study are the principal means of progress; and an _inner_, the imagination and musical feeling, which can indeed be strengthened by judicious experience in hearing, but which when wanting cannot be supplied by the teacher, or the laws of their action reduced to satisfactory statement.  3. There is no fine art which reflects the activity of spirit more perfectly than that of music. There is something in the nature of this form of art which renders it particularly acceptable to quick and sensitive minds. If evidence of this statement were needed beyond the intuitive assent which every musical reader will immediately give, it could easily be furnished in the correspondence between the activity of mind in general and in the art of music in particular, every great period of mental strength having been accompanied by a corresponding term of activity in music. Furthermore, the development of the art of music has kept pace with the deepening of mental activity in general, so that in these later times when the general movement of mind is so much greater than in ancient times, and the operations of intellect so much more diffused throughout all classes, the art of music has come to a period of unprecedented richness and strength.   II.  4. The earlier forms of music were very simple; the range of tones employed was narrow, and the habits of mind in the people employing them apparently calm and almost inactive. As time passed on more and more tones were added to the musical scales, and more and more complicated relations recognized between them, and the music thereby became more diversified in its tonal effects, and therein better adapted for the expression of a more energetic or more sensitive action of mind and feeling. This has been the general course of the progress, from the earliest times in which there was an art of music until now.  The two-fold progress of an education in tone perception, and an increasing ability to employ elaborate combinations for the expression of feelings too high-strung for the older forms of expression, is observable in almost all stages of musical history, and in our own days has received a striking illustration in the progress made in appreciating the works of the latest of the great musical geniuses, Richard Wagner, whose music twenty-five years ago was regarded by the public generally as unmusical and atrocious; whereas now it is heard with pleasure, and takes hold of the more advanced musical minds with a firmness beyond that of any other musical production. The explanation is to be found in the development of finer tone perceptions--the ability to co-ordinate tonal combinations so distantly related that to the musical ears of a generation ago their relation was not recognized, therefore to those ears they were not music. Wagner felt these strange combinations as music. The deeper relations between tones and chords apparently remote, he felt, and employed them for the expression of his imagination. Other ears now feel them as he did. An education has taken place.  5. It is altogether likely that the education will still go on until many new combinations which to our ears would be meaningless will become a part of the ordinary vernacular of the art. Indeed, a writer quite recently (Julius Klauser, in \"The Septonnate\") points out a vast amount of musical material already contained within our tonal systems which as yet is entirely unused. The new chords and relations thus suggested are quite in line with the additions made by Wagner to the vocabulary of his day.   III.  6.

The hula, it is true, has been unfortunate in the mode and            manner of its introduction to us moderns. An institution of            divine, that is, religious, origin, the hula in modern times [Page 8]   has wandered so far and fallen so low that foreign and            critical esteem has come to associate it with the riotous and            passionate ebullitions of Polynesian kings and the amorous            posturing of their voluptuaries. We must make a just            distinction, however, between the gestures and bodily            contortions presented by the men and women, the actors in the            hula, and their uttered words. “The voice is Jacob’s voice,            but the hands are the hands of Esau.” In truth, the actors in            the hula no longer suit the action to the word. The utterance            harks back to the golden age; the gesture is trumped up by            the passion of the hour, or dictated by the master of the            hula, to whom the real meaning of the old bards is ofttimes a            sealed casket.            Whatever indelicacy attaches in modern times to some of the            gestures and contortions of the hula dancers, the old-time            hula songs in large measure were untainted with grossness. If            there ever were a Polynesian Arcadia, and if it were possible            for true reports of the doings and sayings of the Polynesians            to reach us from that happy land—reports of their joys and            sorrows, their love-makings and their jealousies, their            family spats and reconciliations, their worship of beauty and            of the gods and goddesses who walked in the garden of            beauty—we may say, I think, that such a report would be in            substantial agreement with the report that is here offered;            but, if one’s virtue will not endure the love-making of            Arcadia, let him banish the myth from his imagination and hie            to a convent or a nunnery.             If this book does nothing more than prove that savages are            only children of a younger growth than ourselves, that what            we find them to have been we ourselves—in our            ancestors—once were, the labor of making it will have been            not in vain.             For an account of the first hula we may look to the story            of Pele. On one occasion that goddess begged her sisters to            dance and sing before her, but they all excused themselves,            saying they did not know the art. At that moment in came            little Hiiaka, the youngest and the favorite. Unknown to her            sisters, the little maiden had practised the dance under the            tuition of her friend, the beautiful but ill-fated Hopoe.            When banteringly invited to dance, to the surprise of all,            Hiiaka modestly complied. The wave-beaten sand-beach was her            floor, the open air her hall. Feet and hands and swaying            form kept time to her improvisation:                  Look, Puna is a-dance in the wind;                 The palm groves of Kea-au shaken.                 Haena and the woman Hopoe dance and sing                 On the beach Nana-huki,                 A dance of purest delight,                 Down by the sea Nana-huki.             The nature of this work has made it necessary to use            occasional Hawaiian words in the technical parts. At their [Page 9]   first introduction it has seemed fitting that they should be            distinguished by italics; but, once given the entrée, it is            assumed that, as a rule, they will be granted the rights of            free speech without further explanation.             A glossary, which explains all the Hawaiian words used in the            prose text, is appended. Let no one imagine, however, that by            the use of this little crutch alone he will be enabled to            walk or stumble through the foreign ways of the simplest            Hawaiian _mele_. Notes, often copious, have been appended to            many of the mele, designed to exhaust neither the subject nor            the reader, but to answer some of the questions of the            intelligent thinker.             Thanks, many thanks, are due, first, to those native            Hawaiians who have so far broken with the old superstitious            tradition of concealment as to unearth so much of the            unwritten literary wealth stored in Hawaiian memories;            second, to those who have kindly contributed criticism,            suggestion, material at the different stages of this book’s            progress; and, lastly, to those dear friends of the author’s            youth—living or dead—whose kindness has made it possible to            send out this fledgling to the world. The author feels under            special obligations to Dr. Titus Munson Coan, of New York,            for a painstaking revision of the manuscript.             HONOLULU, HAWAII.  [Page 10][Blank]  [Page 11]                                LITERATURE OF HAWAII                             By NATHANIEL B. EMERSON                                     I.—THE HULA             One turns from the study of old genealogies, myths, and            traditions of the Hawaiians with a hungry despair at finding            in them means so small for picturing the people themselves,            their human interests and passions; but when it comes to the            hula and the whole train of feelings and sentiments that made            their entrances and exits in the _halau_ (the hall of the            hula) one perceives that in this he has found the door to the            heart of the people. So intimate and of so simple confidence            are the revelations the people make of themselves in their            songs and prattlings that when one undertakes to report what            he has heard and to translate into the terms of modern speech            what he has received in confidence, as it were, he almost            blushes, as if he had been guilty of spying on Adam and Eve            in their nuptial bower. Alas, if one could but muffle his            speech with the unconscious lisp of infancy, or veil and tone            his picture to correspond to the perspective of antiquity, he            might feel at least that, like Watteau, he had dealt            worthily, if not truly, with that ideal age which we ever            think of as the world’s garden period.             The Hawaiians, it is true, were many removes from being            primitives; their dreams, however, harked back to a period            that was close to the world’s infancy. Their remote ancestry            was, perhaps, akin to ours—Aryan, at least Asiatic—but the            orbit of their evolution seems to have led them away from the            strenuous discipline that has whipped the Anglo-Saxon branch            into fighting shape with fortune.             If one comes to the study of the hula and its songs in the            spirit of a censorious moralist he will find nothing for him;            if as a pure ethnologist, he will take pleasure in pointing            out the physical resemblances of the Hawaiian dance to the            languorous grace of the Nautch girls, of the geisha, and            other oriental dancers. But if he comes as a student and            lover of human nature, back of the sensuous posturings, in            the emotional language of the songs he will find himself            entering the playground of the human race.             The hula was a religious service, in which poetry, music,            pantomime, and the dance lent themselves, under the forms of [Page 12]  dramatic art, to the refreshment of men’s minds. Its view of            life was idyllic, and it gave itself to the celebration of            those mythical times when gods and goddesses moved on the            earth as men and women and when men and women were as gods.            As to subject-matter, its warp was spun largely from the            bowels of the old-time mythology into cords through which the            race maintained vital connection with its mysterious past.            Interwoven with these, forming the woof, were threads of a            thousand hues and of many fabrics, representing the            imaginations of the poet, the speculations of the            philosopher, the aspirations of many a thirsty soul, as well            as the ravings and flame-colored pictures of the sensualist,            the mutterings and incantations of the _kahuna_, the            mysteries and paraphernalia of Polynesian mythology, the            annals of the nation’s history—the material, in fact, which            in another nation and under different circumstances would            have gone to the making of its poetry, its drama, its opera,            its literature.             The people were superstitiously religious; one finds their            drama saturated with religious feeling, hedged about with            tabu, loaded down with prayer and sacrifice. They were            poetical; nature was full of voices for their ears; their            thoughts came to them as images; nature was to them an            allegory; all this found expression in their dramatic art.            They were musical; their drama must needs be cast in forms to            suit their ideas of"]]]
