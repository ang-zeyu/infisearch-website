The gap in the starship's side was closing, and still Bart had not seen the tall, slim, flame-haired figure of his father. The port on the other side of the ship, he knew, was for loading passengers. Bart moved carefully through the thinning crowd, almost to the foot of the stairs. One of the Lhari checking papers stopped and fixed him with an inscrutable gray stare, but finally turned away again.  Bart began really to worry. Captain Steele would never miss his ship! But he saw only one disembarking passenger who had not yet been surrounded by a group of welcoming relatives, or summoned a robotcab and gone. The man was wearing Vegan clothes, but he wasn't Bart's father. He was a fat little man, with ruddy cheeks and a fringe of curling gray hair all around his bald dome. _Maybe he'd know if there was another Vegan on the ship._  Then Bart realized that the little fat man was staring straight at him. He returned the man's smile, rather hesitantly; then blinked, for the fat man was coming straight toward him.  \"Hello, Son,\" the fat man said loudly. Then, as two of the Lhari started toward him, the strange man did an incredible thing. He reached out his two hands and grabbed Bart.  \"Well, boy, you've sure grown,\" he said, in a loud, cheerful voice, \"but you're not too grown-up to give your old Dad a good hug, are you?\" He pulled Bart roughly into his arms. Bart started to pull away and stammer that the fat man had made a mistake, but the pudgy hand gripped his wrist with unexpected strength.  \"Bart, listen to me,\" the stranger whispered, in a harsh fast voice. \"Go along with this or we're both dead. See those two Lhari watching us? Call me Dad, good and loud, if you want to live. Because, believe me, your life's in danger--right now!\"     CHAPTER TWO   For a moment, pulled off balance in the fat stranger's hug, Bart remained perfectly still, while the man repeated in that loud, jovial voice, \"How you've grown!\" He let him go, stepping away a pace or two, and whispered urgently, \"Say something. And take that stupid look off your face.\"  As he stepped back, Bart saw his eyes. In the chubby, good-natured red face, the stranger's eyes were half-mad with fear.  In a split second, Bart remembered the two Lhari and their talk of a fugitive. In that moment, Bart Steele grew up.  He stepped toward the man and took him quickly by the shoulders.  \"Dad, you sure surprised me,\" he said, trying to keep his voice from shaking. \"Been such a long time, I'd--half forgotten what you looked like. Have a good trip?\"  \"About like always.\" The fat man was breathing hard, but his voice sounded firm and cheerful. \"Can't compare with a trip on the old _Asterion_ though.\" The _Asterion_ was the flagship of Vega Interplanet, Rupert Steele's own ship. \"How's everything?\"  Beads of sweat were standing out on the man's ruddy forehead, and his grip on Bart's wrist was so hard it hurt. Bart, grasping at random for something to say, gabbled, \"Too bad you couldn't get to my graduation. I made th-third in a class of four hundred--\"  The Lhari had surrounded them and were closing in.  The fat man took a deep breath or two, said, \"Just a minute, Son,\" and turned around. \"You want something?\"  The tallest of the Lhari--the old one, whom Bart had seen on the escalator--looked long and hard at him. When they spoke Universal, their voices were sibilant, but not nearly so inhuman.  \"Could we trrrouble you to sssshow us your paperrrssss?\"  \"Certainly.\" Nonchalantly, the fat man dug them out and handed them over. Bart saw his father's name printed across the top.  The Lhari gestured to a Mentorian interpreter: \"What colorrr isss thisss man's hairrr?\"  The Mentorian said in the Lhari language, \"His hair is _gray_.\" He used the Universal word; there were, of course, no words for colors in the Lhari speech.  \"The man we sssseek has hair of _red_,\" said the Lhari. \"And he isss tall, not fat.\"  \"The boy is tall and with _red_ hair,\" the Mentorian volunteered, and the old Lhari made a gesture of disdain.  \"This boy is twenty years younger than the man whose description came to us. Why did they not give us a picture or at least a name?\" He turned to the other Lhari and said in their own shrill speech, \"I suspected this man because he was alone. And I had seen this boy on the upper mezzanine and spoken with him. We watched him, knowing sooner or later the father would seek him. Ask him.\" He gestured and the Mentorian said, \"Who is this man, you?\"  Bart gulped. For the first time he noted the energon-ray shockers at the belts of the four Lhari. He'd heard about those. They could stun--or they could kill, and quite horribly. He said, \"This is my father. You want my cards, too?\" He hauled out his identity papers. \"My name's Bart Steele.\"  The Lhari, with a gesture of disgust, handed them back. \"Go, then, father and son,\" he said, not unkindly.  \"Let's get going, Son,\" said the little bald man. His hand shook on Bart's, and Bart thought, _If we're lucky, we can get out of the port before he faints dead away._ He said \"I'll get a copter,\" and then, feeling sorry for the stranger, gave him his arm to lean on. He didn't know whether he was worried or scared. _Where was his father?_ Why did this man have his dad's papers? Was his father hiding inside the Lhari ship? He wanted to run, to burst away from the imposter, but the guy was shaking so hard Bart couldn't just leave him standing there. If the Lhari got him, he was a dead duck.  A copter swooped down, the pilot signaling. The little man said hoarsely, \"No. Robotcab.\"  Bart waved the copter away, getting a dirty look from the pilot, and punched a button at the stand for one of the unmanned robotcabs. It swung down, hovered motionless. Bart boosted the fat man in. Inside, the man collapsed on the seat, leaning back, puffing, his hand pressed hard to his chest.  \"Punch a combo for Denver,\" he said hoarsely.  Bart obeyed, automatically. Then he turned on the man.  \"It's your game, mister! Now tell me what's going on? _Where's my father?_\"  The man's eyes were half-shut. He said, gasping, \"Don't ask me any questions for a minute.\" He thumbed a tablet into his mouth, and presently his breathing quieted.  \"We're safe--for the minute. Those Lhari would have cut us down.\"  \"You, maybe. I haven't done anything. Look, you,\" Bart said in sudden rage, \"you owe me some explanations. For all I know, you're a criminal and the Lhari have every right to chase you! Why have you got my father's papers? Did you steal them to get away from the Lhari? _Where's my father?_\"  \"It's your father they were looking for, you young fool,\" said the man, gasping hard. \"Lucky they had only a description and not a name--but they've probably got that by now, uncoded. We've only confused them for a little while. But if you hadn't played along, they'd have had you watched, and when they get hold of the name Steele--they will, sooner or later, the people in the Procyon system--\"  _\"Where is my father?\"_  \"I hope I don't know,\" the fat man said. \"If he's still where I left him, he's dead. My name is Briscoe. Edmund Briscoe. Your father saved my life years ago, never mind how. The less you know, the safer you'll be for a while. His major worry just now is about you. He was afraid, if he didn't turn up here, you'd take the first ship back to Vega. So he gave me his papers and sent me to warn you--\"  Bart shook his head. \"It all sounds phony as can be. How do I know whether to believe you or not?\" His hand hovered over the robotcab controls. \"We're going straight to the police. If you're okay, they won't turn you over to the Lhari. If you're not--\"  \"You young fool,\" said the fat man, with feeble violence, \"there's no _time_ for all that! Ask me questions--I can prove I know your father!\"  \"What was my mother's name?\"  \"Oh, God,\" Briscoe said, \"I never saw her. I knew your father long before you were born. Until he told me, I never knew he'd married or had a son. I'd never have known you, except that you're the living image--\" He shook his head helplessly, and his breathing sounded hoarse.  \"Bart, I'm a sick man, I'm going to die. I want to do what I came here to do, because your father saved my life once when I was young and healthy, and gave me twenty good years before I got old and fat and sick. Win or lose, I won't live to see you hunted down like a dog, like my own son--\"  \"Don't talk like that,\" Bart said, a creepy feeling coming over him. \"If you're sick, let me take you to a doctor.\"  Briscoe did not even hear. \"Wait, there is something else. Your father said, 'Tell Bart I've gone looking for the Eighth Color. Bart will know what I mean.'\"  \"That's crazy. I don't know--\"  He broke off, for the memory had come, full-blown:  _He was very young: five, six, seven. His mother, tall and slender and very fair, was bending over a blueprint, pointing with a delicate finger at something, straightening, saying in her light musical voice:_  _\"The fuel catalyst--it's a strange color, a color you never saw anywhere. Can you_ think _of a color that isn't red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, indigo or some combination of them? It isn't any of the colors of the spectrum at all. The fuel is a real eighth color.\"_  _And his father had used the phrase, almost adopted it. \"When we know what the eighth color is, we'll have the secret of the star-drive, too!\"_  Briscoe saw his face change, nodded weakly. \"I see it means something to you. Now will you do as I tell you? Within a couple of hours, they'll be combing the planet for you, but by that time the ship I came in on will have taken off again. They only stop a short time here, for mail, passengers--no cargo. They may get under way again before all messages are cleared and decoded.\" He stopped and breathed hard. \"The Earth authorities might protect you, but you would never be able to board a Lhari ship again--and that would mean staying on Earth for the rest of your life.

From a Copy formerly belonging to Dr. Birch, and now in the library at the British Museum.  [Add. MS. 4370.]  REV. DR.  'Twas but last night I received your letter from Gloucester, having left that place three weeks since.  It revived in my mind some very melancholy thoughts I had upon my being obliged to quit those studies, that had a direct tendency to divinity, that being what I should chuse for the business of my life, it being, I think, of all other studies the most suitable to a reasonable nature.  I say my being obliged, for there is every encouragement (whether one regards interest or usefulness) now-a- days for any to enter that profession, who has not got a way of commanding his assent to received opinions without examination.  I had some thoughts, Sir, of paying you my acknowledgments in person for that surprising air of candour and affability with which you have treated me in the Letters that have passed between us.  But really I could not put on so bold a face, as to intrude into a gentleman's company with no other excuse but that of having received an obligation from him.  I have not the least prospect of ever being in a capacity of giving any more than a verbal declaration of my gratitude: so I hope you'l accept that, and believe it's with the utmost sincerity I subscribe myself,  Sir,  Your most obliged, most obedient humble servant,  J. BUTLER.  Hamlin's Coffee-house, Tuesday Morning.    II.   The original of this Letter with the answer, which is roughly written on the blank leaf, is, I believe, now in the library of Oriel College, Oxford.  I am indebted for my copy to the kindness of the Rev. J. H. Newman, D.D., formerly of that College.  REV. SIR,  I had long resisted an Inclination to desire your Thoughts upon the difficulty mentioned in my last, till I considered that the trouble in answering it would be only carrying on the general purpose of your Life, and that I might claim the same right to your Instructions with others; notwithstanding which, I should not have mentioned it to you had I not thought (which is natural when one fancies one sees a thing clearly) that I could easily express it with clearness to others.  However I should by no means have given you a second trouble upon the subject had I not had your particular leave.  I thought proper just to mention these things that you might not suspect me to take advantage from your Civility to trouble you with any thing, but only such objections as seem to me of Weight, and which I cannot get rid of any other way.  A disposition in our natures to be influenced by right motives is as absolutely necessary to render us moral Agents, as a Capacity to discern right motives is. These two are I think quite _distinct_ perceptions, the _former_ proceeding from a desire inseparable from a Conscious Being of its own happiness, the _latter_ being only our Understanding, or Faculty of seeing Truth.  Since a _disposition_ to be influenced by right motives is a _sine qua non_ to Virtuous Actions, an Indifferency to right motives must _incapacitate_ us for Virtuous Actions, or render us in that particular not moral agents.  I do indeed think that no Rational Creature is _strictly speaking Indifferent_ to Right Motives, but yet there seems to be somewhat which to all intents of the present question is the same, viz. _a stronger disposition to be influenced by contrary or wrong motives_, and this I take to be always the Case when any vice is committed.  But since it may be said, as you hint, that this stronger disposition to be influenced by Vicious Motives may have been contracted by repeated Acts of Wickedness, we will pitch upon the _first Vicious Action_ any one is guilty of.  No man would have committed this first Vicious Action if he had not had a _stronger_ (at least as strong) _disposition_ in him to be influenced by the _Motives of the Vicious Action_, than by the _motives of the contrary Virtuous Action_; from whence I infallibly conclude, that since every man has committed some first Vice, every man had, _antecedent_ to the commission of it, a _stronger disposition_ to be influenced by the _Vicious_ than the _Virtuous_ motive.  My difficulty upon this is, that a _stronger natural disposition_ to be influenced by the Vicious than the Virtuous Motive (which every one has antecedent to his first vice), seems, to all purposes of the present question, to put the Man in the same condition as though he was _indifferent to the Virtuous Motive_; and since an _indifferency to the Virtuous Motive_ would have _incapacitated_ a Man from being a _moral Agent_, or _contracting guilt_, is not a _stronger disposition_ to be influenced by the _Vicious_ Motive as great an _Incapacity_?  Suppose I have two diversions offered me, _both_ of which I could not enjoy, I like both of them, but yet have a _stronger_ inclination to one than to the other, I am not indeed strictly _indifferent_ to either, because I should be glad to _enjoy both_; but am I not exactly _in the same case_, _to all intents and purposes of acting_, as though I was _absolutely indifferent_ to that diversion which I have the _least_ inclination to?  You suppose Man to be endued naturally with a _disposition to be influenced by Virtuous Motives_, and that _this Disposition is a sine qua non to Virtuous Actions_, both which I fully believe; but then you _omit_ to consider the natural Inclination to be influenced by Vicious Motives, which, _whenever a Vice is committed_, is at least _equally strong_ with the other, and in the first Vice _is not affected by Habits_, but is as _natural_, and as much _out of a man's power_ as the other.  I am much obliged to your offer of writing to Mr. Laughton, which I shall very thankfully accept of, but am not certain when I shall go to Cambridge; however, I believe it will be about the middle of the next month.  I am, Rev. Sir, Your most obliged humble Servant,  J. BUTLER.  Oriel, Oct. the 6th.   THE ANSWER.   Your objection seems indeed very dexterous, and yet I really think that there is at bottom nothing in it.  But of this you are to judge, not from my assertion, but from the reason I shall endeavour to give to it.  I think then, that a _disposition to be influenced by right motives_ being what we call _rationality_, there cannot be on the contrary (properly speaking) any such thing naturally in rational creatures as a _disposition to be influenced by wrong motives_.  This can be nothing but mere _perverseness of will_; and whether even that can be said to amount to a disposition to be influenced by wrong motives, _formally_, and as such, may (I think) well be doubted.  Men have by nature strong inclinations to certain objects.  None of these inclinations are vicious, but vice consists in pursuing the inclination towards any object in certain circumstances, notwithstanding _reason_, or the natural disposition to be influenced by right motives, declares to the man's conscience at the same time (or would do, if he attended to it) that the object ought not to be pursued in those circumstances.  Nevertheless, where the man commits the crime, the _natural disposition_ was only towards the _object_, not formally towards the doing it upon wrong motives; and generally the very essence of the crime consists in the liberty of the will forcibly overruling the _actual disposition towards being influenced by right motives_, and not at all (as you suppose) in the man's having any _natural disposition to be influenced by wrong motives_, as such.    III.   From the original, now in the library at the British Museum.  [Add. MS. 12,101.]  REV. SIR,  I had the honour of your kind letter yesterday, and must own that I do now see a _difference_ between the nature of _that disposition which we have to be influenced by virtuous motives_, and _that contrary disposition_, (or whatever else it may _properly_ be called,) which is the _occasion_ of our committing _sin_; and hope in time to get a thorough insight into this Subject by means of those helps you have been pleased to afford me.  I find it necessary to consider such very abstruse questions at different times and in different dispositions; and have found particular use of this method upon that abstract subject of _Necessity_: for tho' I did not see the force of your argument for the _unity of the Divine Nature_ when I had done writing to you upon that subject, I am now _fully satisfied_ that it is conclusive.  I will only just add that I suppose somewhat in my last letter was not clearly expressed, for I did not at all _design_ to say, that _the essence of any crime consisted in the man's having a natural disposition to be influenced by wrong motives_.  I was fully resolved to have gone to Cambridge some time in this Term, not in the least expecting but that I might have the Terms allowed there which I have kept here, but I am informed by one who has been there that it is not at all to be depended upon; but that it's "]]]
