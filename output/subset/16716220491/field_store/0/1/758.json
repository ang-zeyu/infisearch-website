Every human being--unless dwelling alone in a cave--is a member of society of one sort or another, and therefore it is well to define what is to be understood by the term \"Best Society\" and why its authority is recognized. Best Society abroad is always the oldest aristocracy; composed not so much of persons of title, which may be new, as of those families and communities which have for the longest period of time known highest cultivation. Our own Best Society is represented by social groups which have had, since this is America, widest rather than longest association with old world cultivation. Cultivation is always the basic attribute of Best Society, much as we hear in this country of an \"Aristocracy of wealth.\"  To the general public a long purse is synonymous with high position--a theory dear to the heart of the \"yellow\" press and eagerly fostered in the preposterous social functions of screen drama. It is true that Best Society is comparatively rich; it is true that the hostess of great wealth, who constantly and lavishly entertains, will shine, at least to the readers of the press, more brilliantly than her less affluent sister. Yet the latter, through her quality of birth, her poise, her inimitable distinction, is often the jewel of deeper water in the social crown of her time.  The most advertised commodity is not always intrinsically the best, but is sometimes merely the product of a company with plenty of money to spend on advertising. In the same way, money brings certain people before the public--sometimes they are persons of \"quality,\" quite as often the so-called \"society leaders\" featured in the public press do not belong to good society at all, in spite of their many published photographs and the energies of their press-agents. Or possibly they do belong to \"smart\" society; but if too much advertised, instead of being the \"queens\" they seem, they might more accurately be classified as the court jesters of to-day.   =THE IMITATION AND THE GENUINE=  New York, more than any city in the world, unless it be Paris, loves to be amused, thrilled and surprised all at the same time; and will accept with outstretched hand any one who can perform this astounding feat. Do not underestimate the ability that can achieve it: a scintillating wit, an arresting originality, a talent for entertaining that amounts to genius, and gold poured literally like rain, are the least requirements.  Puritan America on the other hand demanding, as a ticket of admission to her Best Society, the qualifications of birth, manners and cultivation, clasps her hands tight across her slim trim waist and announces severely that New York's \"Best\" is, in her opinion, very \"bad\" indeed. But this is because Puritan America, as well as the general public, mistakes the jester for the queen.  As a matter of fact, Best Society is not at all like a court with an especial queen or king, nor is it confined to any one place or group, but might better be described as an unlimited brotherhood which spreads over the entire surface of the globe, the members of which are invariably people of cultivation and worldly knowledge, who have not only perfect manners but a perfect manner. Manners are made up of trivialities of deportment which can be easily learned if one does not happen to know them; manner is personality--the outward manifestation of one's innate character and attitude toward life. A gentleman, for instance, will never be ostentatious or overbearing any more than he will ever be servile, because these attributes never animate the impulses of a well-bred person. A man whose manners suggest the grotesque is invariably a person of imitation rather than of real position.  Etiquette must, if it is to be of more than trifling use, include ethics as well as manners. Certainly what one is, is of far greater importance than what one appears to be. A knowledge of etiquette is of course essential to one's decent behavior, just as clothing is essential to one's decent appearance; and precisely as one wears the latter without being self-conscious of having on shoes and perhaps gloves, one who has good manners is equally unself-conscious in the observance of etiquette, the precepts of which must be so thoroughly absorbed as to make their observance a matter of instinct rather than of conscious obedience.  Thus Best Society is not a fellowship of the wealthy, nor does it seek to exclude those who are not of exalted birth; but it _is_ an association of gentle-folk, of which good form in speech, charm of manner, knowledge of the social amenities, and instinctive consideration for the feelings of others, are the credentials by which society the world over recognizes its chosen members.     CHAPTER II  INTRODUCTIONS   =THE CORRECT FORM=  The word \"present\" is preferable on formal occasions to the word \"introduce.\" On informal occasions neither word is expressed, though understood, as will be shown below. The correct formal introduction is:      \"Mrs. Jones, may I present Mr. Smith?\"  or,      \"Mr. Distinguished, may I present Mr. Young?\"  The younger person is always presented to the older or more distinguished, but a gentleman is always presented to a lady, even though he is an old gentleman of great distinction and the lady a mere slip of a girl.  No lady is ever, except to the President of the United States, a cardinal, or a reigning sovereign, presented to a man. The correct introduction of either a man or woman:  To the President,  is,      \"Mr. President, I have the honor to present Mrs. Jones, of     Chicago.\"  To a Cardinal,  is,      \"Your Eminence, may I present Mrs. Jones?\"  To a King:  Much formality of presenting names on lists is gone through beforehand; at the actual presentation an \"accepted\" name is repeated from functionary to equerry and nothing is said to the King or Queen except: \"Mrs. Jones.\"  But a Foreign Ambassador is presented, \"Mr. Ambassador, may I present you to Mrs. Jones.\"  Very few people in polite society are introduced by their formal titles. A hostess says, \"Mrs. Jones, may I present the Duke of Overthere?\" or \"Lord Blank?\"; never \"his Grace\" or \"his Lordship.\" The Honorable is merely Mr. Lordson, or Mr. Holdoffice. A doctor, a judge, a bishop, are addressed and introduced by their titles. The clergy are usually Mister unless they formally hold the title of Doctor, or Dean, or Canon. A Catholic priest is \"Father Kelly.\" A senator is always introduced as Senator, whether he is still in office or not. But the President of the United States, once he is out of office, is merely \"Mr.\" and not \"Ex-president.\"   =THE PREVAILING INTRODUCTION AND INFLECTION=  In the briefer form of introduction commonly used,      \"Mrs. Worldly, Mrs. Norman,\"  if the two names are said in the same tone of voice it is not apparent who is introduced to whom; but by accentuating the more important person's name, it can be made as clear as though the words \"May I present\" had been used.  The more important name is said with a slightly rising inflection, the secondary as a mere statement of fact. For instance, suppose you say, \"Are you there?\" and then \"It is raining!\" Use the same inflection exactly and say, \"Mrs. Worldly?\"--\"Mrs. Younger!\"      Are you there?--It is raining!     Mrs. Worldly?--Mrs. Younger!  The unmarried lady is presented to the married one, unless the latter is very much the younger. As a matter of fact, in introducing two ladies to each other or one gentleman to another, no distinction is made. \"Mrs. Smith; Mrs. Norman.\" \"Mr. Brown; Mr. Green.\"  The inflection is:      I think--it's going to rain!     Mrs. Smith--Mrs. Norman!  A man is also often introduced, \"Mrs. Worldly? Mr. Norman!\" But to a very distinguished man, a mother would say:      \"Mr. Edison--My daughter, Mary!\"  To a young man, however, she should say, \"Mr. Struthers, have you met my daughter?\" If the daughter is married, she should have added, \"My daughter, Mrs. Smartlington.\" The daughter's name is omitted because it is extremely bad taste (except in the South) to call her daughter \"Miss Mary\" to any one but a servant, and on the other hand she should not present a young man to \"Mary.\" The young man can easily find out her name afterward.   =OTHER FORMS OF INTRODUCTION=  Other permissible forms of introduction are:  \"Mrs. Jones, do you know Mrs. Norman?\"  or,  \"Mrs. Jones, you know Mrs. Robinson, don't you?\" (on no account say \"Do you not?\" Best Society always says \"don't you?\")  or,  \"Mrs. Robinson, have you met Mrs. Jones?\"  or,  \"Mrs. Jones, do you know my mother?\"  or,  \"This is my daughter Ellen, Mrs. Jones.\"  These are all good form, whether gentlemen are introduced to ladies, ladies to ladies, or gentlemen to gentlemen. In introducing a gentleman to a lady, you may ask Mr. Smith if he has met Mrs. Jones, but you must not ask Mrs. Jones if she has met Mr. Smith!   =FORMS OF INTRODUCTIONS TO AVOID=  Do not say: \"Mr. Jones, shake hands with Mr. Smith,\" or \"Mrs. Jones, I want to make you acquainted with Mrs. Smith.\" Never say: \"make you acquainted with\" and do not, in introducing one person to another, call one of them \"my friend.\" You can say \"my aunt,\" or \"my sister,\" or \"my cousin\"--but to pick out a particular person as \"my friend\" is not only bad style but, unless you have only one friend, bad manners--as it implies Mrs. Smith is \"my friend\" and you are a stranger.  You may very properly say to Mr. Smith \"I want you to meet Mrs. Jones,\" but this is not a form of introduction, nor is it to be said in Mrs. Jones' hearing. Upon leading Mr. Smith up to Mrs. Jones, you say \"Mrs. Jones may I present Mr. Smith\" or \"Mrs. Jones; Mr. Smith.\" Under no circumstances whatsoever say \"Mr. Smith meet Mrs. Jones,\" or \"Mrs. Jones meet Mr. Smith.\" Either wording is equally preposterous.

I should have credited you with something more original.\"  \"Original!\" Hamar snarled. \"I defy any man to be original when he hasn't a cent, and his stomach contains nothing but air. Give me money, give me food--then, perhaps, I'll be original.\"  \"You don't mean to say you're cleared out of grub!\" Kelson and Curtis cried in chorus. \"We've come to you as our last hope. We've neither of us tasted anything since yesterday.\"  \"Then you'll taste nothing again to-day--at least as far as I'm concerned,\" Hamar jeered. \"I tell you I'm broke--haven't as much as a crumb in the room; and I've pawned everything, save the clothes you see me in!\"  \"And yet you can buy books--unless--unless you stole it!\" Curtis said, eyeing with suspicion the volume Hamar had thrown on the table.  \"Buy it! Not much!\" Hamar cried quickly. \"It's one I've had all my life. Belonged to my grandfather. I took it with me to-night to see what I could raise on it.\"  \"And no one would have it? I should guess not,\" Kelson said, drawing it towards him. \"Why it's got a new label inside--S. Leipman! I know him. He's slick even for a Jew. This looks as if it belonged to your grandfather, Leon. If I'm not real mistaken you bought the book to-night. There's something in it you thought you could make capital of. Trust you for that. Now I wonder what it was!\"  \"You're welcome to see!\" Hamar sneered. \"Perhaps you'd like some water!\"  \"Water! Why water?\"  \"Well, instead of tea or whisky to help digest the book. Besides, it's the only thing I have to offer you.\"  \"Look here, Leon,\" Curtis interrupted; \"what's the good of behaving like this? We are all in the same boat--starving--desperate. So let us lay our heads together and see if we can't think of something--some way out of it.\"  \"A Burglary Company Limited, for instance!\" Hamar sneered. \"No! I'm not having any. I've neither tools nor experience. The San Francisco police handle one roughly, so I'm told, and hard labour isn't to my liking.\"  \"There are other things besides burglary!\" Curtis said in tones of annoyance. \"We might work a fake.\"  \"If I work anything of that sort,\" Hamar said hastily, \"I work alone. Think of something else.\"  \"I tell you Matt and I are pretty well desperate,\" Curtis cried, \"and if we don't think of something soon, we shan't be able to think at all. We've tried our level best to get work--we've answered every likely and unlikely advertisement in the papers--and all to no purpose. So if Providence won't help us we must help ourselves. Robbery, burglary, fakes, anything short of murder--it's all the same to us now--we're tired of starving--dead sick of it. We would do anything, sell our very souls for a meal. My God! I never imagined how terrible it is to feel so hungry. You appear to be interested, Matt. What is it?\"  \"Why, look here, you fellows!\" Kelson said slowly. \"This book is all about a place called Atlantis that is said to have existed in the Atlantic Ocean between America and Ireland, and to have been deluged by an earthquake owing to the wickedness of its inhabitants. They practised sorcery.\"  \"Practised foolery,\" Hamar said. \"It's tosh--all tosh! Wickedness is only a matter of climate--and there's no such thing as sorcery.\"  \"So I thought,\" Kelson replied; \"but I'm not so sure now. The author of this book writes darned sensibly, and is apparently at no loss for corroborative testimony. He was a professor too. See! Thomas Henry Maitland, at one time Professor of English at the University of Basle in Switzerland. There's an asterisk against his name and a footnote in very old-fashioned handwriting--the 's's' are all 'f's,' and half the letters capitals. Listen--      \"'Thomas Maitland, despite the remonstrances of his friends,     visited Spain. By order of the Holy Inquisition he was arrested,     May 5, 1693, on a charge of practising sorcery, and burned alive     at the Auto da Fé, in the Grand Market Square, Madrid; having in     the interim been subjected to such tortures as only the subtle     brains of the hellish inquisitors could devise. On receipt of a     message from him, delivered in his supernatural body, we attended     his execution, and can readily testify that he suffered no pain,     although the torments endured by those around him were pitiable to     behold.      \"(Signed) GEORGE RICHARD POOL, Physician; and ROBERT JAMES FOX,     Merchant.      \"Citizens of Boston, Massachusetts; August 1, 1693.'\"  \"Rot!\" Hamar said savagely; \"don't waste time reading such bunkum.\"  \"It may be bunkum, but if it takes away his mind from his stomach let him go on,\" Curtis interposed. \"It's very obvious you haven't arrived at our pitch of starvation yet, Leon, or you would welcome anything that would make you forget it even for a moment. Let's hear some more, Matt! Go on, tell us something. How to make coyottes out of paraffin paint, or convert a Sunday pair of pants into a glistening harem skirt! Anything that won't remind us of food.\"  Thus encouraged Kelson slowly turned over the pages of the book. \"I see it was printed and published for--I presume that means by--A. Bettesworth and J. Batley in Pater-noster-Row, London, England, in 1690. Basle, London, Boston, Madrid! The author seems to have had wandering on the brain. By the bye, Leon, with your features you could easily work off a fake as 'the Wandering Jew.' There's money in it--people will swallow anything in that line now.\"  \"I don't see how it would profit you anyhow,\" Hamar snarled. \"Leave my features alone and go on with your reading.\"  Kelson chuckled--here was one way at least in which he could occasionally get even with Hamar. Hamar's features were Yiddish, and the Yids were none too popular in California.  \"Oh, all right!\" he said; \"if the subject is so painful I'll try and avoid it in future; but it's odd how some things--for instance, murder and noses--will out. Let me see, what have we here? 'Discovery of ancient books, manuscripts, etc., relating to Atlantis.' Apparently, Thomas Maitland, when shipwrecked on an island, called Inisturk, off Mayo, in Ireland, found a wooden chest of rare workmanship--he had seen, he says, similar ones in Egypt and Yucatan--containing some very ancient books--curiously bound, and some vellum manuscripts, which, after an infinite amount of labour, he managed to translate. The books, he says, were standard histories, biographies, and scientific works on occultism--all published in Banchicheisi, the capital of Atlantis--and the manuscripts, he affirms, had been transcribed by one Coulmenes, who believed himself to be the only survivor of a tremendous submarine earthquake that had destroyed the whole of Atlantis. The manuscripts included a diary of the events leading up to the catastrophe--even to the meals! How about this?--'Sunrise on the day of Thottirnanoge in the month of Finn-ra. Breakfasted on cornsop, fish (Semona, corresponding to salmon), fruit, and much sweet milk.'\"  \"For God's sake, don't!\" Curtis groaned. \"Skip over that part. The very mention of grub makes the gnawing pain in my stomach ten times worse.\"  \"You're different to me then!\" Hamar grinned; \"I love to think of it. My word, what wouldn't I give to be in Sadler's now. Roast beef--done to a turn, eh! As only Sadler knows how! Potatoes nice and brown and crisp! Horseradish! Greens! Boiled celery! Pudding under the meat! Beer!--What, going?\"  Curtis had risen from the table with his fingers crammed in his ears. \"There's a fat splice of the devil in you to-night, Leon!\" he panted. \"I've had enough of it. I'm off. Come on, Matt. If you want us, you know where to find us--only if we don't get something to eat soon--you'll find us dead.\"     CHAPTER II  THE BLACK ART OF ATLANTIS   For some time after Kelson and Curtis had left him, Hamar lolled back in his seat, lost in thought. Thought, as he told himself repeatedly, should be the poor man's chief recreation--it costs nothing: and if one wants a little variety, and the walls of one's rooms are tolerably thick, one can think aloud. Hamar often did, and derived much enjoyment from it.  \"I'm convinced of one thing,\" he suddenly broke out; \"I'd rather be hungry than cold. One can, in a measure, cheat one's stomach by chewing leather or sucking pebbles, but I'll be hanged if one can kid one's liver. It's cold that does me! A touch of cold on the liver! I could jog along comfortably on few dollars for food--but it's a fire, a fire I want! The temperature of this room is infernally low after sunset: and half a dozen coats and three pairs of pants don't make up for half a grateful of fuel. Hunger only makes me think of suicide--but cold--cold and a chilled liver--makes me think of crime. Yes, it's cold! Cold that would make me a criminal. I would steal--burgle--housebreak--cut the sweetest lady's throat in Christendom--for a fire!  \"There! that little outbreak has relieved me. Now let me have a look at the book.\"  He dragged the volume towards him, and despite the feeling of antagonism with which it had inspired him, and despite the cynical attitude he had, up to the present, adopted towards the supernatural, he speedily became engrossed. On a few leaves, somewhat clumsily inserted between the cover and first page of the book, Hamar read an account, presumably in the author's own penmanship, of how he, Thomas Maitland, after being shipwrecked, had remained on Inisturk Island for a fortnight before being rescued, and had spent the greater portion of that time in examining the books, etc., in the chest he had found--his only food--shell-fish and a keg of mildewy ship's biscuits.  He was taken, so the account ran, by his rescuers, on the barque _Hannah_, to London, where he lived for five years. His lodgings were in Cheapside, and it was there that he compiled his work on Atlantis, having obtained his subject matter from the Atlantean books he had managed to bring with him, and which, after an enormous amount of perseverance and labour, he had translated"]]]
