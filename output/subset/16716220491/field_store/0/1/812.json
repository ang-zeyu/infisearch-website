The priests and the generals have commanded it. It's for the fatherland. Ought she not to wed me, Mother?   _Mother:_ [_Nodding impersonally._]  Aye, it is for the fatherland they ask it.   _Hoffman:_  Of course. It is your patriotic duty, Amelia. You're funny. All the young women are tickled at the chance. But you are the one I have picked out, and I am going to have you. Now, there's a good girl--promise!  [_A hubbub of voices and a cheer are heard outside side. Enter Minna, flushed, pretty, light headed._]   _Amelia:_  Minna!   _Minna:_ [_Holding out her hand._]  Amelia, see! My wedding-ring!   _Amelia:_  Iron!   _Minna:_ [_Triumphantly._]  Yes; a war bride!   _Amelia:_  You?   _Minna:_  That's what I am. [_Whirling gaily about._]   _Hoffman:_ [_Shaking her hand._]  Good for you! Congratulations!   _Minna:_  Didn't you hear them cheer? That was for me!   _Hoffman:_  There's patriotism for you, Amelia!   _Amelia:_  When were you married, Minna?   _Minna:_  Just now. There were ten of us. We all answered in chorus. It was fun--just like a theater. Then the priest made a speech, and the burgomaster and the captain. The people cheered, and then our husbands had to go to drill for an hour. Oh, I never was so thrilled! It was grand! They told us we were the true patriots.   _Hoffman:_  Hurrah! And so you are.   _Minna:_  Our names will go down in history, honored by a whole people, they said.  [_They are all carried away by Minna's enthusiasm; even Amelia warms up._]   _Amelia:_  But whom did you marry, Minna?   _Minna:_  Heinrich Berg.   _Amelia:_ [_Dubious._]  That loafer!   _Minna:_  He's all right. He's a soldier now. Why, he may be a hero, fighting for the fatherland; and that makes a lot of difference, Amelia.   _Hoffman:_  What did I tell you?   _Minna:_  I probably wouldn't have picked him out in peace-times, but it is different now. He only asked me last night. Of course he may get killed. They said we'd have a widow's pension fund,--us and our children,--forever and ever, if the boys didn't come back. So, you see, I won't be out anything. Anyway, it's for the country. We'll be famous, as war brides. Even the name sounds glorious, doesn't it? War bride! Isn't that fine?   _Hoffman:_  Here's a little lady who will hear herself called that to-morrow. [_Takes Amelia's hand._]   _Minna:_ [_Clapping her hands._]  Amelia a war bride, too! Good!   _Hoffman:_  You'll be proud to hear her called that, won't you, Mother? Give us your blessing.   _Minna:_  I'd rather be a wife or a widow any day than be an old maid; and to be a war bride--oh!  [_Amelia is blushing and tremulous._]   _Mother:_ [_With a far-away look._]  It is for the fatherland, Amelia. Aye, aye, the masters have said so. It is the will and judgment of those higher than us. They are wise. Our country will need children. Aye. Say yes, my daughter. You will not say no when your country bids you! It is your emperor, your country, who asks, more than Hans Hoffman.   _Amelia:_ [_Impressed, and questions herself to see if her patriotism is strong enough to stand the test, while Hoffman, charmed by Amelia's gentleness, is moved by more personal feeling._]   _Hoffman:_ [_Kissing Amelia on both cheeks._]  There, it's all settled. [_A faint cheer is heard without._] To-morrow they will cheer you like that; and when I go, I shall have a bride to wave me good-by instead of--  [_Enter Hedwig._  _She stands in the doorway, looking out on the distant crowds. She is tall, well built, and carries herself proudly. Strong, intelligent features, but pale. Her eyes are large with anxiety. She has soft, wavy black hair. An inward flame seems to be consuming her.  The sounds continue in the distance, cheering, disputing mingled with far bugle-calls and marching feet._]   _Hedwig:_ [_Contemptuously._]  Ha!  [_The sound startles the others. They turn._]   _All:_  Hedwig!   _Hedwig:_  [_Still in the doorway, looking out._]  War brides!   _Minna:_ [_Pertly._]  You're a war bride yourself, Hedwig.   _Hedwig:_ [_Turns quickly, locates Minna, almost springs at her._]  Don't you dare to call me a war bride! My ring is gold. See. [_Seizes Minna's hand, and then throws it from her._] Not iron, like yours.   _Minna:_  [_Boldly taunting._]  They even call you the first war bride.   _Hedwig:_ [_Furious, towering over her, her hand on her shoulder._]  Say why, why?   _Minna:_ [_Weakening._]  Because you were the first one to be married when the war broke out.   _Hedwig:_ [_Both hands on her shoulders._]  Because the Government commanded? Because they bribed me with the promise of a widow's pension? Tell the truth.   _Minna:_ [_Faintly._]  No. Let me go.   _Hedwig:_  So! And how long had Franz and I been engaged? Now say.   _Minna:_ [_Beginning to be frightened._]  Two years.   _Hedwig:_ [_Flinging her off._]  Of course. Everybody knows it. Every village this side the river knew we were to be married this summer. We've dreamed and worked for nothing else all these months. It had nothing to do with the war--our love, our marriage. So, you see, I am no war bride. [_Walks scornfully away._] Not like you, anyway.  [_They all stare at her._]   _Hoffman:_ [_Stepping forward indignantly._]  I don't know why you should have this contempt for our war brides, and speak like that.   _Hedwig:_ [_Sits down, half turned away. She shrugs her shoulders, and her lips curl in a little smile._]   _Hoffman:_  They are coming to the rescue of their country. Saving it; else it will perish.   _Hedwig:_ [_Bitterly._]  Ha!   _Hoffman:_ [_Waxing warmer._]  They are the saviors of the future.   _Hedwig:_ [_Sadly._]  The future!   _Mother:_ [_Softly, laying her hand on Hedwig's shoulder._]  Hedwig, be more respectful. Herr Hoffman is a lieutenant.   _Hoffman:_  When we are gone,--the best of us,--what will the country do if it has no children?   _Hedwig:_  Why didn't you think of that before--before you started this wicked war?   _Hoffman:_  I tell you it is a glory to be a war bride. There!   _Hedwig:_ [_With a shrug._]  A breeding-machine! [_They all draw back._] Why not call it what it is? Speak the naked truth for once.   _Hoffman:_  You'll take that back to-morrow, when your sister stands up in the church with me.   _Hedwig:_ [_Starting up._]  Amelia? Marry you? No! Amelia, is this true?   _Amelia:_ [_Hesitating, troubled, and uncertain._]  They tell me I must--for the fatherland.   _Hedwig:_  Marry this man, whom you scarcely know, whom surely you cannot love! Why, you make a mock of marriage! It isn't that they have tempted you with the widow's pension? It is so tiny; it's next to nothing. Surely you wouldn't yield to that?   _Amelia:_ [_Frightened._]  I did want to go as a nurse, but the priests and the generals--they say we must marry--to--for the fatherland, Hedwig.   _Hoffman:_ [_To Hedwig._]  I command you to be silent!   _Hedwig:_  Not when my sister's happiness is at stake. If you come back, she will have to live with you the rest of her life.   _Hoffman:_  That isn't the question now. We are going away--the best of us--to be shot, most likely. Don't you suppose we want to send some part of ourselves into the future, since we can't live ourselves? There, that's straight; and right, too.   _Hedwig:_ [_Nodding slowly._]  What I said--to breed a soldier for the empire; to restock the land. [_Fiercely._] And for what? For food for the next generation's cannon. Oh, it is an insult to our womanhood! You violate all that makes marriage sacred! [_Agitated, she walks about the room._] Are we women never to get up out of the dust? You never asked us if we wanted this war, yet you ask us to gather in the crops, cut the wood, keep the world going, drudge and slave, and wait, and agonize, lose our all, and go on bearing more men--and more--to be shot down! If we breed the men for you, why don't you let us say what is to become of them? Do we want them shot--the very breath of our life?   _Hoffman:_  It is for the fatherland.   _Hedwig:_  You use us, and use us--dolls, beasts of burden, and you expect us to bear it forever dumbly; but I won't! I shall cry out till I die. And now you say it almost out loud, \"Go and breed for the empire.\" War brides! Pah! [_Minna gasps, beginning to be terrified. Hoffman rages. Mother gazes with anxious concern. Amelia turns pale._]   _Hoffman:_  I never would dream of speaking of Amelia like that. She is the sweetest girl I have seen for many a day.   _Hedwig:_  What will happen to Amelia? Have you thought of that? No; I warrant you haven't. Well, look. A few kisses and sweet words, the excitement of the ceremony, the cheers of the crowd, some days of living together,--I won't call it marriage, for Franz and I are the ones who know what real marriage is, and how sacred it is,--then what? Before you know it, an order to march. Amelia left to wait for her child. No husband to wait with her, to watch over her. Think of her anxiety, if she learns to love you! What kind of child will it be? Look at me. What kind of child would _I_ have, do you think? I can hardly breathe for thinking of my Franz, waiting, never knowing from minute to minute. From the way I feel, I should think my child would be born mad, I'm that wild with worrying. And then for Amelia to go through the agony alone! No husband to help her through the terrible hour. What solace can the state give then? And after that, if you don't come back, who is going to earn the bread for her child? Struggle and struggle to feed herself and her child; and the fine-sounding name you trick us with--war bride! Humph! that will all be forgotten then. Only one thing can make it worth while, and do you know what that is? Love. We'll struggle through fire and water for that; but without it--[_Gesture._]   _Hoffman:_ [_Drawing Amelia to him._]  Don't listen to her, Amelia.   _Amelia:_ [_Pushing Hoffman violently from her, runs from the room._]  No, no, I can't marry you! I won't!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14602"],["title","War Brides: A Play in One Act (#2)"],["body"," won't!  [_She shuts the door in his face._]   _Hedwig:_ [_Triumphantly._]  She will never be your war bride, Hans Hoffman!   _Hoffman:_ [_Suddenly, angrily._]  By thunder! I've made a discovery. You're the woman! You're the woman!   _Hedwig:_  What woman?   _Hoffman:_  Yesterday there were twenty war brides. The day before there were nearly thirty. To-day there were only ten. There are rumors--[_Excitedly._] I'll report you. They'll find you guilty. I myself can prove it.   _Hedwig:_  Well?   _Hoffman:_  I heard them say at the barracks that some one was talking the women out of marrying. They didn't know who; but they said if they caught her--caught any one talking as you have just now, daring to question the wisdom of the emperor and his generals, the church, too,--she'd be guilty of treason. You are working against the emperor, against the fatherland. Here you have done it right before my very eyes; you have taken Amelia right out of my arms. You're the woman who's been upsetting the others, and don't you deny it.   _Hedwig:_  Deny it? I am proud of it.   _Hoffman:_  Then the place for you is in jail. Do you know what will be the end of you?   _Hedwig:_ [_Suddenly far away._]  Yes, I know, if Franz does not come back. I know; but first [_Clenching her hands_] I must get my message to the emperor.   _Hoffman:_ [_Very angry._]  You will be shot for treason.   _Hedwig:_ [_Coming back, laughing slightly._]  Shot? Oh, no, Herr Hans, you'd never shoot me!   _Hoffman:_  Why not?   _Hedwig:_  Do I have to tell you, stupid? I am a woman: I can get in the crops; I can keep the country going while you are away fighting, and, most important, I might give you a soldier for your next army--for the kingdom. Don't you see my value? [_Laughs strangely._] Oh, no, you'd never shoot me!   _Mother:_  There, there, don't excite her, sir.   _Hedwig:_ [_Her head in her hands, on the table._]  God! I wish you would shoot me! If you don't give me back my Franz! I've no mind to bring a son into the world for this bloody thing you call war.   _Hoffman:_  I am going straight to headquarters to report you.  [_Starts to go.  Enter Arno excitedly. He is boyish and fair, in his early twenties, and looks even younger than he really is._]   _Arno:_ [_To Hoffman._]  There's an order to march at once--your regiment.   _Hoffman:_  Now?   _Arno:_  At once. You are wanted. They told me to tell you.  [Illustration: ARNO: You are wanted.]  [_Hoffman moves with military precision to the door; then turns to Hedwig._]   _Hoffman:_  I shall take the time to report you.  [_Goes._]   _Minna:_ [_To Arno._]  Does Heinrich's regiment go, too?   _Arno:_  Heinrich who?   _Minna:_  Heinrich Berg.   _Arno:_  No. To-morrow.  [_Minna, now thoroughly scared, is slinking to the door when Hedwig stops her._]   _Hedwig:_  Ha! little Minna, why do you run so fast? Heinrich does not go until to-morrow. [_Looks at her thoughtfully._] Are you going to be able to fight it through, little Minna, when the hard days come? If you do give the empire a soldier, will it be any comfort to know you are helping the falling birth-rate?   _Minna:_ [_Shivering._]  Oh, I am afraid of you!   _Hedwig:_  Afraid of the truth, you mean. You see it at last in all its brutal bareness. Poor little Minna! [_She puts her arm around Minna with sudden tenderness._] But you need not be afraid of me, little Minna. Oh, no. The trouble with me is I want no more war. Franz is at the war. I'm half mad with dreaming they have killed him. Any moment I may hear. If you loved your man as I do mine, little Minna, you'd understand.' Well, go now, and to-morrow say good-by to your husband--of a day.  [_Minna, with a frightened backward glance, runs out the door.  Arno, who has been talking in low tones to his mother, now rises._]   _Arno:_  Well, Mother, I haven't much time.  [_She clings to his hand._]   _Hedwig:_ [_Starting._]  Arno!   _Arno:_  I am going, too. Get those little things for me, Mother, will you?   _Mother:_ [_Goes to door and calls._]  Amelia! Come. Arno has been called. [_Amelia comes in. Each in turn embraces him, sadly, but bravely. Then the mother and sister gather together handkerchiefs, linen, writing-pad and pencil, and small necessaries._]   _Arno:_  I have only a few minutes.   _Hedwig:_ [_Tenderly._]  Arno, my little brother, oh, why--why must you go? You seem so young.   _Arno:_  I'm a man, like the others; don't forget that, Hedwig. Be brave--to help me to be brave.  [_They sit on the settle._]   _Hedwig:_ [_Sighing._]  Yes, it cannot be helped. Will you see my Franz, Arno? You look so like him to-day--the day I first saw him in the fields, the day of the factory picnic. It seems long ago. Tell him how happy he made me, and how I loved him. He didn't believe in this war no more than I, yet he had to go. He dreaded lest he meet his friends on the other side. You remember those two young men from across the border? They worked all one winter side by side in the factory with Franz. They went home to join their regiments when the war was let loose on us. He never could stand it, Franz couldn't, if he were ordered to drive his bayonet into them. [_Gets up, full of emotion that is past expression._] Oh, it is too monstrous! And for what--for what?   _Arno:_  It is our duty. We belong to the fatherland. I would willingly give my life for my country.   _Hedwig:_  I would willingly give mine for peace.   _Arno:_  I must go. Good-by, Hedwig.   _Hedwig:_ [_Controlling her emotion as she kisses him._]  Good-by, my brave, splendid little brother.   _Amelia:_  I may come to the front, too.  [_They embrace tenderly._]   _Mother:_ [_Strong and quiet, unable to speak, holds his head against her breast for a moment._]  Fight well, my son.   _Arno:_  Yes, Mother.  [_He tears himself away. The silent suffering of the mother is pitiful. Her hands are crossed on her breast, her lips are seen to move in prayer. It is Hedwig who takes her in her arms and comforts her._]   _Hedwig:_  And this is war--to tear our hearts out like this! Make mother some tea, Amelia, can't you?  [_Amelia prepares the cup of tea for her mother._]   _Mother:_ [_After a few moments composes herself._]  There, I am right now. I must remember--and you must help me, my daughters--it is for the fatherland.   _Hedwig:_ [_On her knees by the fire, shakes her head slowly._]  I wonder, I wonder. O Mother, I'm not patient like you. I couldn't stand it. To have a darling little baby and see him grow into a man, and then lose him like this! I'd rather never see the face of my child.   _Mother:_  We have them for a little while. I am thankful to God for what I have had.   _Hedwig:_  Then I must be very wicked.   _Mother:_  Are you sleeping better now, child?   _Hedwig:_   No; I am thinking of Franz. He may be lying there alone on the battle-field, with none to help, and I here longing to put my arms around him.  [_Buries her face on the mother's knees and sobs._]   _Mother:_  Hush, Hedwig! Be brave! Take care of yourself! We must see that Franz's child is well born.   _Hedwig:_  If Franz returns, yes; if not--I--  [_Gets up impulsively, as if to run out of the house._]   _Amelia:_  Don't you want your tea, Hedwig?  [_Hedwig throws open the door, and suddenly confronts a man who apparently was about to enter the house. He is an official, the military head of the town, known as Captain Hertz. He is well along in years, rheumatic, but tremendously self-important._]   _Hertz:_ [_Stopping Hedwig._]  Wait one moment. You are the young woman I wish to see. You don't get away from me like that.   _Hedwig:_ [_Drawing herself up, moves back a step or two._]  What is it?   _Hertz:_ [_Turning to the old mother._]  Well, Maria, another son must go--Arno. You are an honored woman, a noble example to the state. [_Turns to Amelia._] You have lost a very good husband, I understand. Well, you are a foolish girl. As for you [_Turning to Hedwig, and eyeing her critically and severely_], I hear pretty bad things. Yes, you have been talking to the women--telling them not to marry, not to multiply. In so doing you are working directly against the Government. It is the express request and command that our soldiers about to be called to the front and our young women should marry. You deliberately set yourself in opposition to that command. Are you aware that that is treason?   _Hedwig:_  Why are they asking this, Herr Captain?   _Hertz:_  Our statesmen are wise. They are thinking of the future state. The nation is fast being depopulated. We must take precautionary measures. We must have men for the future. I warn you, that to do or say anything which subverts the plan of the empire for its own welfare, especially at a time when our national existence is in peril--well, it is treason. Were it not that you are the daughter-in-law of my old friend [_Indicating the Mother_], I should not take the trouble to warn you, but pack you off to jail at once. Not another word from you, you understand?   _Hedwig:_ [_Calmly, even sweetly, but with fire in her eye._]  If I say I will keep quiet, will you promise me something in return?   _Hertz:_  What do you mean? Quiet? Of course you'll keep quiet. Quiet as a tombstone, if I have anything to say about it.   _Hedwig:_ [_Calm and tense._]  I mean what I say. Promise to see to it that if we bear you the men for your nation, there shall be no more war. See to it that they shall not go forth to murder and be murdered. That is fair. We will do our part,--we always have,--will you do yours? Promise.   _Hertz:_  I--I--ridiculous! There will always be war.   _Hedwig:_  Then one day we will stop giving you men. Look at mother. Four sons torn from her in one month, and none of you ever asked her if she wanted war. You keep us here helpless. We don't want dreadnoughts and armies and fighting, we women. You tear our husbands, our sons, from us,--you never ask us to help you find a better way,--and haven't we anything to say?   _Hertz:_  No."]]]
