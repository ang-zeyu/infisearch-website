Lloyd looked puzzled as she opened it. There was only a blank book inside, bound in Russia leather, with the word \"Record\" stamped on it in gilt.  \"I thought it would be a good idea to keep a partnership diary,\" he said. \"We can take turns in writing in it, and some day, when you are grown, and your mother and I are old and gray, it will help us to remember much of the journey that otherwise might pass out of our memories. So many things happen when one is travelling, that they are apt to crowd each other out of mind unless a record is kept of them.\"  \"We'll begin as soon as we get on the ship,\" said Lloyd. \"Mothah shall write first, then you, and then I. And let's put photographs in it, too, as Mrs. Walton did in hers. It will be like writing a real book. Package numbah two is lovely, Papa Jack.\"  It happened that Mr. Sherman was the only one who made an entry in the record for more than a week. Mrs. Sherman felt the motion of the vessel too much to be able to do more than lie out on deck in her steamer-chair. The Little Colonel, while she was not at all seasick, was afraid to attempt writing until she reached land.  \"The table jiggles so!\" she complained, when she sat down at a desk in the ship's library. \"I'm afraid that I'll spoil the page. You write it, Papa Jack.\" She put back the pen, and stood at his elbow while he wrote.  \"Put down about all the steamah lettahs that we got,\" she suggested, \"and the little Japanese stove Allison Walton sent me for my muff, and the books Rob sent. Oh, yes! And the captain's name and how long the ship is, and how many tons of things to eat they have on board. Mom Beck won't believe me when I tell her, unless I can show it to her in black and white.\"  After they had explored the vessel together, her father was ready to settle down in his deck-chair in a sheltered corner, and read aloud or sleep. But the Little Colonel grew tired of being wrapped like a mummy in her steamer rug. She did not care to read long at a time, and she grew tired of looking at nothing but water. Soon she began walking up and down the deck, looking for something to entertain her. In one place some little girls were busy with scissors and paint-boxes, making paper dolls. Farther along two boys were playing checkers, and, under the stairs, a group of children, gathered around their governess, were listening to a fairy tale. Lloyd longed to join them, for she fairly ached for some amusement. She paused an instant, with her hand on the rail, as she heard one sentence: \"And the white prince, clasping the crystal ball, waved his plumed cap to the gnome, and vanished.\"  Wondering what the story was about, Lloyd walked around to the other side of the deck, only to find another long uninteresting row of sleepy figures stretched out in steamer-chairs, and half hidden in rugs and cloaks. She turned to go back, but paused as she caught sight of a girl, about her own age, standing against the deck railing, looking over into the sea. She was not a pretty girl. Her face was too dark and thin, according to Lloyd's standard of beauty, and her mouth looked as if it were used to saying disagreeable things.  But Lloyd thought her interesting, and admired the scarlet jacket she wore, with its gilt braid and buttons, and the scarlet cap that made her long plaits of hair look black as a crow's wing by contrast. Her hair was pretty, and hung far below her waist, tied at the end with two bows of scarlet ribbon.  The girl glanced up as Lloyd passed, and although there was a cool stare in her queer black eyes, Lloyd found herself greatly interested. She wanted to make the stranger's acquaintance, and passed back and forth several times, to steal another side glance at her. As she turned for the third time to retrace her steps, she was nearly knocked off her feet by two noisy boys, who bumped against her. They were playing horse, to the annoyance of all the passengers on deck, stepping on people's toes, knocking over chairs, and stumbling against the stewards who were hurrying along with their heavy trays of beef tea and lemonade.  Lloyd had seen the boys several times before. They were little fellows of six and nine, with unusually thin legs and shrill voices, and were always eating.  Every time a deck steward passed, they grabbed a share of whatever he carried. They seemed to have discovered some secret passage to the ship's supplies. Their blouses were pouched out all around with the store of gingersnaps, nuts, and apples which they had managed to stow away as a reserve fund. Lloyd had seen the larger boy draw out six bananas, one after another, from his blouse, and then squirm and wriggle and almost stand on his head to reach the seventh, which had slipped around to his back while he was eating the others. They were munching raisins now, as they ran.  After their collision with Lloyd they stopped running, and suddenly began calling, \"Here, Fido! Here, Fido!\" Lloyd looked around eagerly, expecting to see some pet dog, and wishing that she had one of the many pet animals left behind at Locust, to amuse her now. But no dog was in sight. The girl in the scarlet jacket turned around with an angry scowl.  \"Stop calling me that, Howl Sattawhite!\" she exclaimed, crossly. \"I'll tell mamma. You know what she said she'd do to you if you called me anything but Fidelia.\"  \"And you know what she said she'd do to you if you kept calling me Howl,\" shouted the larger of the boys, making a saucy face and darting forward to give one of her long plaits of hair a sudden pull.  Quick as a flash, Fidelia turned, and catching him by the wrists, twisted them till he began to whimper with pain, and tried to set his teeth in her hand.  \"You _dare_ bite me, you little beast!\" she cried. \"You just dare, and I'll tell mamma how you spit at the waiter the morning we left the hotel.\"  Lloyd was scandalised. They were quarrelling like two little dogs, seemingly unconscious of the fact that a hundred people were within hearing. As Fidelia seemed to be getting the upper hand, the little brother joined in, calling in a high piping voice, \"And if you squeal on Howell, Fidelia Sattawhite, I'll tell mamma how you went out walking by yourself in New York when she told you not to, and took her new purse and lost it! So there, Miss Smarty!\"  \"Oh, those dreadful American children!\" said an English woman near Lloyd. \"They're all alike. At least the ones who travel. I have never seen any yet that had any manners. They are all pert and spoiled. Fancy an English child, now, making such a scene in public!\"  The Little Colonel could feel her face growing painfully red. She was indignant at being classed with such rude children, and walked quickly away. At the cabin door she met a maid, who, coming out on deck with something wrapped carefully in an embroidered shawl, sat down on one of the empty benches.  Scarcely was she seated when the two boys pounced down upon her and began pulling at the blanket. \"Oh, let me see Beauty, Fanchette,\" begged Howell. \"Make him sit up and do some tricks.\"  The maid pushed them away with a strong hand, and then carefully drew aside a corner of the covering. Lloyd gave an exclamation of pleasure, for the head that popped out was that of a bright little French poodle. She had thought many times that morning of the two Bobs, and good old Fritz, dead and gone, of Boots, the hunting-dog, and the goat and the gobbler and the parrot,--all the animals she had loved and played with at Locust, wishing she had them with her. Now as she saw the bright eyes of the poodle peeping over the blanket, she forgot that she was a stranger, and running across the deck, she stooped down beside it.  \"Oh, the darling little dog!\" she exclaimed, touching the silky hair softly. \"May I hold him for a minute?\"  The maid smiled, but shook her head. \"Ah, that the madame will not allow,\" she said.  \"It cost a thousand dollars,\" explained Howell, eagerly, \"and mamma thinks more of it than she does of us. Doesn't she, Henny?\"  The small boy nodded with a finger in his mouth.  \"Show her Beauty's bracelet, Fanchette,\" said Howell. Turning back another fold of the blanket, the maid lifted a little white paw, on which sparkled a tiny diamond bracelet. Lloyd drew a long breath of astonishment. \"Some of its teeth are filled with gold,\" continued Howell. \"We had to stay a whole week in New York while Beauty was in the dog hospital, having them filled. They could only do a little at a time. One of his tricks is to laugh so that he shows all his fillings. Laugh, Beauty!\" he commanded. \"Laugh, old fellow, and show your gold teeth!\"  He shook a dirty finger in the poodle's face, and it obediently stretched its mouth, to show all its little gold-filled teeth.  \"See!\" exclaimed Howell, much pleased. \"Do it again!\"  But the maid interfered. \"Your mother told you not to touch Beauty again. You'd have the poor little thing's mouth stretched till it had the face-ache, if you weren't watched all the time. Go away! You are a naughty boy!\"  Howell's lips shot out in a sullen pout, and the maid, not knowing what he might do next, rose with the poodle in her arms and walked to the other side of the vessel.  \"Wish't the little beast was dead!\" he muttered. \"I get scolded and punished for nothing at all whenever it is around. It and Fidelia! I haven't any use for girls and puppy-dogs!\"  After this uncivil remark he waited for the angry retort which he thought would naturally follow, but to his surprise Lloyd only laughed good-naturedly. She found him amusing, even if he was rude and cross, and she could not wonder that he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15124"],["title","The Lighthouse (#1)"],["body","of the next ledge, and lay floating securely in the deep, quiet pool within, while the men rested on their oars, and watched the chaos of the water rush harmlessly by.  In another moment they had landed and secured the boat to a projecting rock.  Few words of conversation passed between these practical men. They had gone there on particular business. Time and tide proverbially wait for no man, but at the Bell Rock they wait a much briefer period than elsewhere. Between low water and the time when it would be impossible to quit the rock without being capsized', there was only a space of two or three hours--sometimes more, frequently less--so it behoved the men to economize time.  Rocks covered with wet seaweed and rugged in form are not easy to walk over; a fact which was soon proved by Swankie staggering violently once or twice, and by Spink falling flat on his back. Neither paid attention to his comrade's misfortunes in this way. Each scrambled about actively, searching with care among the crevices of the rocks, and from time to time picking up articles which they thrust into their pockets or laid on their shoulders, according as weight and dimensions required.  In a short time they returned to their boat pretty well laden.  \"Weel, lad, what luck?\" enquired Spink, as Swankie and he met--the former with a grappling iron on his shoulder, the latter staggering under the weight of a mass of metal.  \"Not much,\" replied Swankie; \"nothin' but heavy metal this mornin', only a bit of a cookin' stove an' a cannon shot--that's all.\"  \"Never mind, try again. There must ha' bin two or three wrecks on the rock this gale,\" said Davy, as he and his friend threw their burdens into the boat, and hastened to resume the search.  At first Spink was the more successful of the two. He returned to the boat with various articles more than once, while his comrade continued his rambles unsuccessfully. At last, however, Big Swankie came to a gully or inlet where a large mass of the _débris_ of a wreck was piled up in indescribable confusion, in the midst of which lay the dead body of an old man. Swankie's first impulse was to shout to his companion, but he checked himself, and proceeded to examine the pockets of the dead man.  Raising the corpse with some difficulty he placed it on the ledge of rock. Observing a ring on the little finger of the right hand, he removed it and put it hastily in his pocket. Then he drew a red morocco case from an inner breast pocket in the dead man's coat. To his surprise and delight he found that it contained a gold watch and several gold rings and brooches, in some of which were beautiful stones. Swankie was no judge of jewellery, but he could not avoid the conviction that these things must needs be valuable. He laid the case down on the rock beside him, and eagerly searched the other pockets. In one he found a large clasp-knife and a pencil-case; in another a leather purse, which felt heavy as he drew it out. His eyes sparkled at the first glance he got of the contents, for they were sovereigns! Just as he made this discovery, Davy Spink climbed over the ledge at his back, and Swankie hastily thrust the purse underneath the body of the dead man.  \"Hallo! lad, what have ye there? Hey! watches and rings--come, we're in luck this mornin'.\"  \"_We!_\" exclaimed Swankie, somewhat sternly, \"_you_ didn't find that case.\"  \"Na, lad, but we've aye divided, an' I dinna see what for we should change our plan noo.\"  \"We've nae paction to that effec'--the case o' kickshaws is mine,\" retorted Swankie.  \"Half o't,\" suggested Spink.  \"Weel, weel,\" cried the other with affected carelessness, \"I'd scorn to be sae graspin'. For the matter o' that ye may hae it all to yersel', but I'll hae the next thing we git that's worth muckle a' to _mysel_'.\"  So saying Swankie stooped to continue his search of the body, and in a moment or two drew out the purse with an exclamation of surprise.  \"See, I'm in luck, Davy! Virtue's aye rewarded, they say. This is mine, and I doot not there'll be some siller intilt.\"  \"Goold!\" cried Davy, with dilated eyes, as his comrade emptied the contents into his large hand, and counted over thirty sovereigns.  \"Ay, lad, ye can keep the what-d'ye-ca'-ums, and I'll keep the siller.\"  \"I've seen that face before,\" observed Spink, looking intently at the body.  \"Like enough,\" said Swankie, with an air of indifference, as he put the gold into his pocket. \"I think I've seed it mysel'. It looks like auld Jamie Brand, but I didna ken him weel.\"  \"It's just him,\" said Spink, with a touch of sadness. \"Ay, ay, that'll fa' heavy on the auld woman. But, come, it'll no' do to stand haverin' this way. Let's see what else is on him.\"  They found nothing more of any value; but a piece of paper was discovered, wrapped up in oilskin, and carefully fastened with red tape, in the vest pocket of the dead man. It contained writing, and had been so securely wrapped up, that it was only a little damped. Davy Spink, who found it, tried in vain to read the writing; Davy's education had been neglected, so he was fain to confess that he could not make it out.  \"Let _me_ see't,\" said Swankie. \"What hae we here? 'The sloop is hard an--an--'\" (\"'fast,' maybe,\" suggested Spink). \"Ay, so 'tis. I canna make out the next word, but here's something about the jewel-case.\"  The man paused and gazed earnestly at the paper for a few minutes, with a look of perplexity on his rugged visage.  \"Weel, man, what is't?\" enquired Davy.  \"Hoot! I canna mak' it oot,\" said the other, testily, as if annoyed at being unable to read it. He refolded the paper, and thrust it into his bosom, saying, \"Come, we're wastin' time. Let's get on wi' our wark.\"  \"Toss for the jewels and the siller,\" said Spink, suggestively.  \"Very weel,\" replied the other, producing a copper. \"Heeds, you win the siller; tails, I win the box;--heeds it is, so the kickshaws is mine. Weel, I'm content,\" he added, as he handed the bag of gold to his comrade, and received the jewel-case in exchange.  In another hour the sea began to encroach on the rock, and the fishermen, having collected as much as time would permit of the wrecked materials, returned to their boat.  They had secured altogether above two hundredweight of old metal,--namely, a large piece of a ship's caboose, a hinge, a lock of a door, a ship's marking-iron, a soldier's bayonet, a cannon ball, a shoebuckle, and a small anchor, besides part of the cordage of the wreck, and the money and jewels before mentioned. Placing the heavier of these things in the bottom of the boat, they pushed off.  \"We better take the corp ashore,\" said Spink, suddenly.  \"What for? They may ask what was in the pockets,\" objected Swankie.  \"Let them ask,\" rejoined the other, with a grin.  Swankie made no reply, but gave a stroke with his oar which sent the boat close up to the rocks. They both re-landed in silence, and, lifting the dead body of the old man, laid it in the stern sheets of the boat. Once more they pushed off.  Too much delay had been already made. The surf was breaking over the ledges in all directions, and it was with the utmost difficulty that they succeeded in getting clear out into deep water. A breeze which had sprung up from the east, tended to raise the sea a little, but when they finally got away from the dangerous reef, the breeze befriended them. Hoisting the foresail, they quickly left the Bell Rock far behind them, and, in the course of a couple of hours, sailed into the harbour of Arbroath.    CHAPTER II  THE LOVERS AND THE PRESS-GANG  About a mile to the eastward of the ancient town of Arbroath the shore abruptly changes its character, from a flat beach to a range of, perhaps, the wildest and most picturesque cliffs on the east coast of Scotland. Inland the country is rather flat, but elevated several hundred feet above the level of the sea, towards which it slopes gently until it reaches the shore, where it terminates in abrupt, perpendicular precipices, varying from a hundred to two hundred feet in height. In many places the cliffs overhang the water, and all along the coast they have been perforated and torn up by the waves, so as to present singularly bold and picturesque outlines, with caverns, inlets, and sequestered \"coves\" of every form and size.  To the top of these cliffs, in the afternoon of the day on which our tale opens, a young girl wended her way,--slowly, as if she had no other object in view than a stroll, and sadly, as if her mind were more engaged with the thoughts within than with the magnificent prospect of land and sea without.  The girl was                   \"Fair, fair, with golden hair,\"  and apparently about twenty years of age. She sought out a quiet nook among the rocks at the top of the cliffs, near to a circular chasm, with the name of which (at that time) we are not acquainted, but which was destined ere long to acquire a new name and celebrity from an incident which shall be related in another part of this story.  Curiously enough, just about the same hour, a young man was seen to wend his way to the same cliffs, and, from no reason whatever with which we happened to be acquainted, sought out the same nook! We say \"he was seen\", advisedly, for the maid with the golden hair saw him. Any ordinary observer would have said that she had scarcely raised her eyes from the ground since sitting down on a piece of flower-studded turf near the edge of the cliff, and that she certainly had not turned her head in the direction of the town. Yet she saw him,--however absurd the statement may appear, we affirm it confidently,--and knew that he was coming. Other eyes there were that also saw the youth--eyes that would have caused him some degree of annoyance had he known they were upon him--eyes that he would have rejoiced to tinge with the colours black and blue! There were thirteen pair of them, belonging to twelve men and a lieutenant of the navy.  In those days the barbarous custom of"]]]
