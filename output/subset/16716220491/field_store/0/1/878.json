Violet, Edward, Harold and Herbert, just returned from their ride, were on the veranda.  Edward hastened to assist his mother to alight, and all gathered about her and their grandfather with morning greetings spoken in cheerful but subdued tones; no one forgetting for a moment the illness of the little pet brother and sister, but all inquiring anxiously how they and \"Mamma\" had passed the night, and what was cousin Arthur's report of their condition this morning.  \"No worse, my dears; and we will hope that they may soon be decidedly better,\" the mother answered, returning their greetings with affectionate warmth and smiling sweetly upon them. \"But you must let me go at once to the sick-room, and if all is well I shall be down presently to breakfast with grandpa and you.\"  That announcement was heard with the greater pleasure because her loved face had seldom been seen at the table for some days past.  The face was bright and hopeful as she spoke, but an unwonted expression of sadness and anxiety came over it as she turned quickly away and went swiftly through the spacious entrance hall and up the broad stairway.  No earthly eye saw that look, but the traces of tears on her mother's cheeks had not escaped Vi's keen observation.  \"Grandpa,\" she said in low, tremulous tones, following him into the library, whither he went to await the summons to breakfast, \"what has been distressing mamma so? is it that she is so anxious about Elsie and Walter? May I not know?\"  Mr. Dinsmore paused a moment before he replied. \"You shall know all about it, my dear child, before very long. Be satisfied for the present with the assurance that your mother's distress is for another's woe. You know what a tender, sympathetic heart she has. I cannot deny that our little ones are seriously ill, but their case is very far from hopeless.\"     CHAPTER II.                         \"Within her heart was his image,     Cloth'd in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him,     Only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence.\"                                             --_Longfellow_.   The sick ones ware sleeping quietly when the mother entered; the doctor had already breakfasted, and would assist Aunt Chloe and Dinah in watching beside them for the next hour, so the two Elsies--mother and daughter--went down together to the breakfast parlor.  They were a more silent party than usual at meal-time, for no one could forget the two absent members of the family, or that they were suffering upon beds of sickness; yet there was no gloom in any face or voice: their few words were spoken in cheerful tones, and each seemed unselfishly intent upon promoting the comfort and happiness of all the others; on the part of the children, especially of their grandfather and mother; each young heart was evidently full to overflowing of tenderest sympathy and love for her.  She had been closely confined to the sick-room for several days, so that it was a treat to have her with them at breakfast and at family worship, which followed directly upon the conclusion of the meal.  It surprised them a little that when the short service came to an end, she did not even then return at once to her sick little ones, but putting on a garden hat invited her eldest daughter to do likewise and come with her for a short stroll in the grounds.  \"It will do us both good,\" she said as they stepped from the veranda upon the broad, gravelled walk, \"the air is so sweet and pure at this early hour; and you have not been out in it at all, have you?\"  \"No, mamma; and what a treat it is to take it in your dear company,\" Elsie responded, gathering a lovely, sweet-scented flower and placing it in the bosom of her mother's dress.  \"Thank you, love,\" Mrs. Travilla said; then went on to speak feelingly of the beauty and fragrance that surrounded them, and the unnumbered blessings of their lot in life.  \"Mamma, you seem to have a heart always filled with love and gratitude to God, and never to be troubled with the least rebellious feeling, or any doubts or fears for the future,\" remarked Elsie, sighing slightly as she spoke.  \"Have we any right or reason to indulge repining, doubts, or fears, when we know that all is ordered for us by One who loves us with an everlasting and infinite love, and who is all-wise and all-powerful? O my darling, no! Well may we say with the Psalmist, 'I will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.' Oh what a blessed assurance! goodness and mercy while here in this world of trial--all things working together for our good, that so we may be brought at last safely to our desired haven--and then to be forever with the Lord!\"  \"Mamma, I have been so anxious and troubled about my little brother and sister, and about Lester, I needed the lesson you have just given me, and hope I shall profit by it.\"  \"My dearest child, have faith in God; try to believe with all your heart that he will never send you or any of his children one unneeded pang. I am sure you could never think I--your tender mother--would give you the slightest pain except for your certain good; and what is my love for you compared to that of your Saviour? who died that you might live!\"  \"Mamma,\" cried the young girl, pausing in her walk, laying her hand on her mother's arm and looking searchingly into the sweet, compassionate face, while her own grew deathly pale, \"what is it you are trying to prepare me for? O mamma!\"  A rustic seat stood close at hand.  \"Let us sit down here for a moment, dear daughter,\" Mrs. Travilla said, drawing Elsie to it with an arm about her waist. \"You are right, my child--I have news for you. Oh, not the worst, dearest!\" as Elsie seemed to gasp for breath. \"Lester lives, but is very ill with typhoid fever.\"  \"Mamma!\" cried Elsie, starting to her feet, \"I must go to him! go at once. O dearest mother, do not hinder me!\" and she clasped her hands in piteous entreaty, the big tears rapidly chasing each other down her pale cheeks.  \"If I could go with you,\" faltered the mother, \"or your grandfather; but I can neither leave nor take my little ones, and he would never consent to leave me, or his poor old father, who seems just tottering on the verge of the grave.\"  \"I know! I see! but, O mother, mother! how can I let him die all alone in a stranger land? Think if it had been you and my father!\"  \"What is your entreaty, daughter?\" Mr. Dinsmore asked, coming up and laying his hand affectionately upon his grandchild's shoulder.  \"To go to him--to Lester, grandpa. Oh, how can I stay away and leave him to die alone? to die for lack of the good nursing I could give him, perhaps to the saving of his life!\"  \"My poor child! my poor dear child!\" he said, caressing her; \"we will see what can be done in the way of finding a suitable escort, and if that can be obtained your mother will not, I think, withhold her consent.\"  He had been telling the news to the others, and Edward had followed him, anxious to express the sympathy for his sister with which his heart was full.  \"An escort, grandpa?\" he said. \"Would mine be sufficient? Mamma, if you will permit me, I shall gladly go to Lester, either with or without Elsie.\"  \"My dear boy!\" was all his mother said, her tones tremulous with emotion, while his grandfather turned and regarded him with doubtful scrutiny.  \"Oh, thank you, brother!\" cried Elsie. \"Mamma, surely you can trust me to him! Who loves me better? except yourself--and who would take such tender care of me?\"  \"Mamma, I would guard her with my life!\" exclaimed Edward earnestly.  \"My dear son, I do not doubt it,\" Mrs. Travilla answered, turning upon her father a half-inquiring, half-entreating look.  \"If no older or more experienced person can be found.\"  He paused, and Elsie burst out: \"O grandpa, dear grandpa, don't say that! There is no time to lose! no time to look for other escort!\"  \"That is true, my child; and we will not waste any time. Make your preparations as rapidly as you can, and if nothing better offers in the mean while, and your mother consents to Edward's proposition, you shall go with him--and Ben who travelled all over Europe with your father and myself--as your protectors.\"  She thanked him fervently through her tears, while her mother said, \"Ah yes, that is a good thought, papa! Ben shall go with them.\"  \"Better go now and at once select whatever you wish to take with you, and set some one to packing your trunks,\" he said. \"Edward, do you do likewise, and I will examine the morning papers for information in regard to trains and the sailing of the next steamer. Daughter dear,\" to Mrs. Travilla, \"you need give yourself no concern about any of these matters.\"  \"No, I shall trust everything to you, my best of fathers, and go back at once to my sick darlings,\" she said, giving him a look of grateful love.  Then passing her arm affectionately about her daughter's waist, she drew her on toward the house, her father and son accompanying them.  She parted with Elsie at the door of the sick-room, embracing her tenderly and bidding her \"'Be strong and of a good courage,' my darling, for 'the eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.'\"  \"Dearest mamma, what sweet words!\" said the weeping girl. \"Oh, how glad I am that "]]]
