As I entered, the talking ceased. I saw no face except his and that seemed blank.  \"Vaughn Steele, Ranger--come to see you, sir.\" I announced.  Did Sampson start--did his eyes show a fleeting glint--did his face almost imperceptibly blanch? I could not have sworn to either. But there was a change, maybe from surprise.  The first sure effect of my announcement came in a quick exclamation from Wright, a sibilant intake of breath, that did not seem to denote surprise so much as certainty. Wright might have emitted a curse with less force.  Sampson moved his hand significantly and the action was a voiceless command for silence as well as an assertion that he would attend to this matter. I read him clearly so far. He had authority, and again I felt his power.  \"Steele to see me. Did he state his business?\"  \"No, sir.\" I replied.  \"Russ, say I'm not at home,\" said Sampson presently, bending over to relight his pipe.  I went out. Someone slammed the door behind me.  As I strode back across the porch my mind worked swiftly; the machinery had been idle for a while and was now started.  \"Mr. Steele,\" I said, \"Colonel Sampson says he's not at home. Tell your business to his daughter.\"  Without waiting to see the effect of my taking so much upon myself, I knocked upon the parlor door. Miss Sampson opened it. She wore white. Looking at her, I thought it would be strange if Steele's well-known indifference to women did not suffer an eclipse.  \"Miss Sampson, here is Vaughn Steele to see you,\" I said.  \"Won't you come in?\" she said graciously.  Steele had to bend his head to enter the door. I went in with him, an intrusion, perhaps, that in the interest of the moment she appeared not to notice.  Steele seemed to fill the room with his giant form. His face was fine, stern, clear cut, with blue or gray eyes, strangely penetrating. He was coatless, vestless. He wore a gray flannel shirt, corduroys, a big gun swinging low, and top boots reaching to his knees.  He was the most stalwart son of Texas I had seen in many a day, but neither his great stature nor his striking face accounted for something I felt--a something spiritual, vital, compelling, that drew me.  \"Mr. Steele, I'm pleased to meet you,\" said Miss Sampson. \"This is my cousin, Sally Langdon. We just arrived--I to make this my home, she to visit me.\"  Steele smiled as he bowed to Sally. He was easy, with a kind of rude grace, and showed no sign of embarrassment or that beautiful girls were unusual to him.  \"Mr. Steele, we've heard of you in Austin,\" said Sally with her eyes misbehaving.  I hoped I would not have to be jealous of Steele. But this girl was a little minx if not altogether a flirt.  \"I did not expect to be received by ladies,\" replied Steele. \"I called upon Mr. Sampson. He would not see me. I was to tell my business to his daughter. I'm glad to know you, Miss Sampson and your cousin, but sorry you've come to Linrock now.\"  \"Why?\" queried both girls in unison.  \"Because it's--oh, pretty rough--no place for girls to walk and ride.\"  \"Ah! I see. And your business has to do with rough places,\" said Miss Sampson. \"Strange that papa would not see you. Stranger that he should want me to hear your business. Either he's joking or wants to impress me.  \"Papa tried to persuade me not to come. He tried to frighten me with tales of this--this roughness out here. He knows I'm in earnest, how I'd like to help somehow, do some little good. Pray tell me this business.\"  \"I wished to get your father's cooperation in my work.\"  \"Your work? You mean your Ranger duty--the arresting of rough characters?\"  \"That, yes. But that's only a detail. Linrock is bad internally. My job is to make it good.\"  \"A splendid and worthy task,\" replied Miss Sampson warmly. \"I wish you success. But, Mr. Steele, aren't you exaggerating Linrock's wickedness?\"  \"No,\" he answered forcibly.  \"Indeed! And papa refused to see you--presumably refused to cooperate with you?\" she asked thoughtfully.  \"I take it that way.\"  \"Mr. Steele, pray tell me what is the matter with Linrock and just what the work is you're called upon to do?\" she asked seriously. \"I heard papa say that he was the law in Linrock. Perhaps he resents interference. I know he'll not tolerate any opposition to his will. Please tell me. I may be able to influence him.\"  I listened to Steele's deep voice as he talked about Linrock. What he said was old to me, and I gave heed only to its effect.  Miss Sampson's expression, which at first had been earnest and grave, turned into one of incredulous amaze. She, and Sally too, watched Steele's face in fascinated attention.  When it came to telling what he wanted to do, the Ranger warmed to his subject; he talked beautifully, convincingly, with a certain strange, persuasive power that betrayed how he worked his way; and his fine face, losing its stern, hard lines, seemed to glow and give forth a spirit austere, yet noble, almost gentle, assuredly something vastly different from what might have been expected in the expression of a gun-fighting Ranger. I sensed that Miss Sampson felt this just as I did.  \"Papa said you were a hounder of outlaws--a man who'd rather kill than save!\" she exclaimed.  The old stern cast returned to Steele's face. It was as if he had suddenly remembered himself.  \"My name is infamous, I am sorry to say,\" he replied.  \"You have killed men?\" she asked, her dark eyes dilating.  Had any one ever dared ask Steele that before? His face became a mask. It told truth to me, but she could not see, and he did not answer.  \"Oh, you are above that. Don't--don't kill any one here!\"  \"Miss Sampson, I hope I won't.\" His voice seemed to check her. I had been right in my estimate of her character--young, untried, but all pride, fire, passion. She was white then, and certainly beautiful.  Steele watched her, could scarcely have failed to see the white gleam of her beauty, and all that evidence of a quick and noble heart.  \"Pardon me, please, Mr. Steele,\" she said, recovering her composure. \"I am--just a little overexcited. I didn't mean to be inquisitive. Thank you for your confidence. I've enjoyed your call, though your news did distress me. You may rely upon me to talk to papa.\"  That appeared to be a dismissal, and, bowing to her and Sally, the Ranger went out. I followed, not having spoken.  At the end of the porch I caught up with Steele and walked out into the moonlight beside him.  Just why I did not now reveal my identity I could not say, for certainly I was bursting with the desire to surprise him, to earn his approval. He loomed dark above me, appearing not to be aware of my presence. What a cold, strange proposition this Ranger was!  Still, remembering the earnestness of his talk to Miss Sampson, I could not think him cold. But I must have thought him so to any attraction of those charming girls.  Suddenly, as we passed under the shade of cottonwoods, he clamped a big hand down on my shoulder.  \"My God, Russ, isn't she lovely!\" he ejaculated.  In spite of my being dumbfounded I had to hug him. He knew me!  \"Thought you didn't swear!\" I gasped.  Ridiculously those were my first words to Vaughn Steele.  \"My boy, I saw you parading up and down the street looking for me,\" he said. \"I intended to help you find me to-morrow.\"  We gripped hands, and that strong feel and clasp meant much.  \"Yes, she's lovely, Steele,\" I said. \"But did you look at the cousin, the little girl with the eyes?\"  Then we laughed and loosed hands.  \"Come on, let's get out somewhere. I've a million things to tell you.\"  We went away out into the open where some stones gleamed white in the moonlight, and there, sitting in the sand, our backs against a rest, and with all quiet about us, we settled down for a long conference.  I began with Neal's urgent message to me, then told of my going to the capitol--what I had overheard when Governor Smith was in the adjutant's office; of my interview with them; of the spying on Colonel Sampson; Neal's directions, advice, and command; the ride toward San Antonio; my being engaged as cowboy by Miss Sampson; of the further ride on to Sanderson and the incident there; and finally how I had approached Sampson and then had thought it well to get his daughter into the scheme of things.  It was a long talk, even for me, and my voice sounded husky.  \"I told Neal I'd be lucky to get you,\" said Steele, after a silence.  That was the only comment on my actions, the only praise, but the quiet way he spoke it made me feel like a boy undeserving of so much.  \"Here, I forgot the money Neal sent,\" I went on, glad to be rid of the huge roll of bills.  The Ranger showed surprise. Besides, he was very glad.  \"The Captain loves the service,\" said Steele. \"He alone knows the worth of the Rangers. And the work he's given his life to--the _good_ that _service_ really does--all depends on you and me, Russ!\"  I assented, gloomily enough. Then I waited while he pondered.  The moon soared clear; there was a cool wind rustling the greasewood; a dog bayed a barking coyote; lights twinkled down in the town.  I looked back up at the dark hill and thought of Sally Langdon. Getting here to Linrock, meeting Steele had not changed my feelings toward her, only somehow they had removed me far off in thought, out of possible touch, it seemed.  \"Well, son, listen,\" began Steele. His calling me that was a joke, yet I did not feel it. \"You've made a better start than I could have figured. Neal said you were lucky. Perhaps. But you've got brains.  \"Now, here's your cue for the present. Work for Miss Sampson. Do your best for her as long as you last. I don't suppose you'll last long. You have got to get in with this gang in town. Be a flash cowboy. You don't need to get drunk, but you're to pretend it.  \"Gamble. Be a good fellow. Hang round the barrooms. I don't care how you play the part, so long as you make friends, learn the ropes.

The Pillar was brought there by one of the Rajput princes who founded in the middle of the eleventh century the first city really known to history as Delhi. There Prithvi Raja reigned, who still lives in Indian minstrelsy as the embodiment of Hindu chivalry, equally gallant and daring in love and in war--the last to make a stand in northern India against the successive waves of Mahomedan conquest which Central Asia had begun to pour in upon India in 1001, with the first of Mahmud Ghazni's seventeen raids. In the next century an Afghan wave swept down on the top of the original Turki wave, and Kutub-ed-Din, having proclaimed himself Emperor of Delhi in 1206, built the great Mosque of _Kuwwet-el-Islam_, \"The Power of Islam,\" and the lofty minaret, still known by his name, from which for six centuries the Moslem call to prayer went forth to proclaim Mahomedan domination over India.  With the monumental wreckage of those early Mahomedan dynasties, steeped in treachery and bloodshed, the plain of Delhi is still strewn. The annals of Indian history testify more scantily but not less eloquently to their infamy until the supremacy of Delhi, but not of Islam, was shaken for two centuries by Timur, who appeared out of the wild spaces of Tartary and within a year disappeared into them again like a devastating meteor. From his stock, nevertheless, was to proceed the long line of Moghul Emperors who first under Baber and then under Akbar won the Empire of Hindustan at the gates of Delhi, and for a time succeeded in bringing almost the whole of India under their sway. But their splendid marble halls in the great Fort of Delhi recall not only the magnificence of the Moghul Empire, but its slow and sure decay, until it became a suitor for the protection of the British power, which, at first a mere trading power that had once sued humbly enough for its protection, had risen to be the greatest military and political power in India. It was at Delhi at the beginning of the nineteenth century that Lord Lake rescued a Moghul Emperor from the hands of Mahratta jailers, and it was at Delhi again that in 1857 the last semblance of Moghul rulership disappeared out of history in the tempest of the Mutiny. It was on the plain of Delhi that the assumption by Queen Victoria of the imperial title was solemnly proclaimed in 1878, and, with still greater pomp, King Edward's accession in 1903. There again in 1911 King George, the first of his line to visit his Indian Empire as King-Emperor, received in person the fealty of princes and peoples and restored Delhi to her former pride of place as its imperial capital.  Where else in the world can such a procession of the ages pass before one's eyes, from the great \"Horse Sacrifice\" of the Pandavas at the dawn of history to the inauguration by a British prince in the King-Emperor's name of modern political institutions conceived in the democratic spirit of British freedom?  Yet at the very time when an Indian-elected assembly, representing as far as possible all creeds and classes and communities, and above all the Western-educated classes who are the intellectual offspring of British rule, were gathered together to hear delivered to them in English--the one language in which, as a result of British rule, and by no means the least valuable, Indians from all parts of a vast polyglot country are able to hold converse--the Royal message throwing open to the people of India the road to _Swaraj_ within the British Empire, the imperial city of Delhi went into mourning as a sign of angry protest, and the vast majority of its citizens, mostly, it must be remembered, Mahomedans, very strictly observed a complete boycott of the Royal visit in accordance with Mr. Gandhi's \"Non-co-operation\" campaign, and went out in immense crowds to greet the strange Hindu saint and leader who had come to preach to them his own very different message--a message of revolt, not indeed by violence but by \"soul force,\" against the soulless civilisation of the West.  In no other city in India would such an alliance between Hindus and Mahomedans have seemed only a few years ago more unthinkable. For nowhere else have we such a vision as in Delhi of the ruthlessness as well as of the splendour of Mahomedan domination in India. Nowhere can one measure as in Delhi the greatness of its fall, and its fall had begun before it ever came into conflict with the rising British power. It had been shaken to its foundations by the far more ancient power of Hinduism, which Islam had subdued but never destroyed. In the seventeenth century Shivaji, the hero still to-day of the Hindu revival of which Mr. Gandhi is the latest apostle, led out for the first time his Mahrattas in open rebellion against Delhi and started the continuous process of disintegration from which the Moghul Emperors were driven to purchase their only possible respite under British protection. Since India finally passed not under Mahratta, but under British rule, Hinduism has never again been subjected to the oppression which the fierce monotheism of Islam itself taught all her Mahomedan rulers, with the one noble exception of Akbar, to inflict upon an \"idolatrous\" race. British rule introduced into India not only a new reign of law and order but the principles of equal tolerance and justice for all which had struck root in our own civilisation. Nevertheless, at the very moment at which we were attempting to extend a wide and generous application of those principles to the domain of political rights and liberties, we were being confronted with unexpected forces of resistance which, even in Mahomedan Delhi, drew their chief inspiration from Hinduism.  But, it might be argued, Delhi, though restored to the primacy it had lost under British rule as the capital city of India, has continued to live on the memories of the past and has been scarcely touched by the breath of modern civilisation. For the full effect of close contact with the West, ought one not to look to the great cities that have grown up under British rule--to Calcutta, for instance, the seat until a few years ago of British Government in India, itself a creation of the British, and if not to-day a more prosperous centre of European enterprise than Bombay, a larger and more populous city, in which the Hindus are in an overwhelming majority? But in the life even of Calcutta features are not lacking to remind one how persistent are the forces of resistance to the whole spirit of the West which Mr. Gandhi mustered in Delhi to protest against the purpose of the Duke of Connaught's mission. Had not a great part of Calcutta itself also observed the _Hartal_ proclaimed by Mr. Gandhi during the Prince's visit?  On the surface it seems difficult in Calcutta to get even an occasional glimpse of the old India upon which we have superimposed a new India with results that are still in the making. In Bombay, though it proudly calls itself \"the Western Gate of India\" the glow of Hindu funeral pyres, divided only by a long wall from the fashionable drive which sweeps along Back Bay from the city, still called the Fort, to Malabar Hill, serves to remind one any evening that he is in an oriental world still largely governed as ever by the doctrine of successive rebirths, the dead being merely reborn to fresh life, in some new form according to each one's merits or demerits, out of the flames that consume the body. On Malabar Hill itself, in the very heart of the favourite residential quarter whence the Europeans are being rapidly elbowed out by Indian merchant princes, the finest site of all still encloses the Towers of Silence on which, contrary to the Hindu usage of cremation, the Parsees, holding fire too sacred to be subjected to contact with mortal corruption, expose their dead to be devoured by vultures. Calcutta has no such conspicuous landmarks of the East to disturb the illusion produced by most of one's surroundings that this is a city which, if not actually European, differs only from the European type in the complexion and dress of its oriental population and the architectural compromises imposed on European buildings by a tropical climate. The Marquess of Wellesley built Government House over a hundred years ago on the model of Kedleston, and it is still the stateliest official residence in British India. Fort William with Olive's ramparts and fosses is still almost untouched, and with an ever-expanding Walhalla of bronze or marble Governors and Viceroys and Commanders-in-Chief, and at the farther end the white marble walls and domes of the Queen Victoria Memorial Hall--the one noble monument we have built in India--at last nearing completion, the broad expanse of Calcutta's incomparable Maidan is, even more than our London parks, the green playfield and the vital lung of the whole city. Along and behind Chowringhee there are still a few of the old-time mansions of Thackeray's \"nabobs,\" with their deep, pillared verandahs standing well off from the road, each within its discreet \"compound,\" but they are all rapidly making room for \"eligible residences,\" more opulent perhaps but more closely packed, or for huge blocks of residential flats, even less adapted to the climate. The great business quarter round Dalhousie Square has been steadily rebuilt on a scale of massive magnificence scarcely surpassed in the city of London, and many of the shops compare with those of our West End. The river, too, all along the Garden Reach and far below is often almost as crowded as the Pool of London, with ocean-going steamers waiting to load or unload their cargoes as well as with lumbering native sailing ships and the ferries that ply ceaselessly between the different quarters of the city on both banks of the Hugli.
