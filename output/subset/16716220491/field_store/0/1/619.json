So far as they go, these studies are complete in themselves; their special use, as an introduction to a more comprehensive analysis of sexual phenomena, is that they bring before us, under varying aspects, a characteristic which, though often ignored, is of the first importance in obtaining a clear understanding of the facts: the tendency of the sexual impulse to appear in a spontaneous and to some extent periodic manner, affecting women differently from men. This is a tendency which, later, I hope to make still more apparent, for it has practical and social, as well as psychological, implications. Here--and more especially in the study of those spontaneous solitary manifestations which I call auto-erotic--I have attempted to clear the ground, and to indicate the main lines along which the progress of our knowledge in these fields may best be attained.  It may surprise many medical readers that in the third and longest study I have said little, save incidentally, either of treatment or prevention. The omission of such considerations at this stage is intentional. It may safely be said that in no other field of human activity is so vast an amount of strenuous didactic morality founded on so slender a basis of facts. In most other departments of life we at least make a pretence of learning before we presume to teach; in the field of sex we content ourselves with the smallest and vaguest minimum of information, often ostentatiously second-hand, usually unreliable. I wish to emphasize the fact that before we can safely talk either of curing or preventing these manifestations we must know a great deal more than we know at present regarding their distribution, etiology, and symptomatology; and we must exercise the same coolness and caution as--if our work is to be fruitful--we require in any other field of serious study. We must approach these facts as physicians, it is true, but also as psychologists, primarily concerned to find out the workings of such manifestations in fairly healthy and normal people. If we found a divorce-court judge writing a treatise on marriage we should smile. But it is equally absurd for the physician, so long as his knowledge is confined to disease, to write regarding sex at large; valuable as the facts he brings forward may be, he can never be in a position to generalize concerning them. And to me, at all events, it seems that we have had more than enough pictures of gross sexual perversity, whether furnished by the asylum or the brothel. They are only really instructive when they are seen in their proper perspective as the rare and ultimate extremes of a chain of phenomena which we may more profitably study nearer home.  Yet, although we are, on every hand, surrounded by the normal manifestations of sex, conscious or unconscious, these manifestations are extremely difficult to observe, and, in those cases in which we are best able to observe them, it frequently happens that we are unable to make any use of our knowledge. Moreover, even when we have obtained our data, the difficulties--at all events, for an English investigator--are by no means overcome. He may take for granted that any serious and precise study of the sexual instinct will not meet with general approval; his work will be misunderstood; his motives will be called in question; among those for whom he is chiefly working he will find indifference. Indeed, the pioneer in this field may well count himself happy if he meets with nothing worse than indifference. Hence it is that the present volume will not be published in England, but that, availing myself of the generous sympathy with which my work has been received in America, I have sought the wider medical and scientific audience of the United States. In matters of faith, \"liberty of prophesying\" was centuries since eloquently vindicated for Englishmen; the liberty of investigating facts is still called in question, under one pretence or another, and to seek out the most vital facts of life is still in England a perilous task.  I desire most heartily to thank the numerous friends and correspondents, some living in remote parts of the world, who have freely assisted me in my work with valuable information and personal histories. To Mr. F.H. Perry-Coste I owe an appendix which is by far the most elaborate attempt yet made to find evidence of periodicity in the spontaneous sexual manifestations of sleep; my debts to various medical and other correspondents are duly stated in the text. To many women friends and correspondents I may here express my gratitude for the manner in which they have furnished me with intimate personal records, and for the cross-examination to which they have allowed me to subject them. I may already say here, what I shall have occasion to say more emphatically in subsequent volumes, that without the assistance I have received from women of fine intelligence and high character my work would be impossible. I regret that I cannot make my thanks more specific.  HAVELOCK ELLIS.     CONTENTS.   THE EVOLUTION OF MODESTY.  I.

THE EVOLUTION OF MODESTY.  I.  The Definition of Modesty--The Significance of Modesty--Difficulties in the Way of Its Analysis--The Varying Phenomena of Modesty Among Different Peoples and in Different Ages.   Modesty, which may be provisionally defined as an almost instinctive fear prompting to concealment and usually centering around the sexual processes, while common to both sexes is more peculiarly feminine, so that it may almost be regarded as the chief secondary sexual character of women on the psychical side. The woman who is lacking in this kind of fear is lacking, also, in sexual attractiveness to the normal and average man. The apparent exceptions seem to prove the rule, for it will generally be found that the women who are, not immodest (for immodesty is more closely related to modesty than mere negative absence of the sense of modesty), but without that fear which implies the presence of a complex emotional feminine organization to defend, only make a strong sexual appeal to men who are themselves lacking in the complementary masculine qualities. As a psychical secondary sexual character of the first rank, it is necessary, before any psychology of sex can be arranged in order, to obtain a clear view of modesty.      The immense importance of feminine modesty in creating masculine     passion must be fairly obvious. I may, however, quote the     observations of two writers who have shown evidence of insight     and knowledge regarding this matter.      Casanova describes how, when at Berne, he went to the baths, and     was, according to custom, attended by a young girl, whom he     selected from a group of bath attendants. She undressed him,     proceeded to undress herself, and then entered the bath with him,     and rubbed him thoroughly all over, the operation being performed     in the most serious manner and without a word being spoken. When     all was over, however, he perceived that the girl had expected     him to make advances, and he proceeds to describe and discuss his     own feelings of indifference under such circumstances. \"Though     without gazing on the girl's figure, I had seen enough to     recognize that she had all that a man can desire to find in a     woman: a beautiful face, lively and well-formed eyes, a beautiful     mouth, with good teeth, a healthy complexion, well-developed     breasts, and everything in harmony. It is true that I had felt     that her hands could have been smoother, but I could only     attribute this to hard work; moreover, my Swiss girl was only     eighteen, and yet I remained entirely cold. What was the cause of     this? That was the question that I asked myself.\"      \"It is clear,\" wrote Stendhal, \"that three parts of modesty are     taught. This is, perhaps, the only law born of civilization which     produces nothing but happiness. It has been observed that birds     of prey hide themselves to drink, because, being obliged to     plunge their heads in the water, they are at that moment     defenceless. After having considered what passes at Otaheite, I     can see no other natural foundation for modesty. Love is the     miracle of civilization. Among savage and very barbarous races we     find nothing but physical love of a gross character. It is     modesty that gives to love the aid of imagination, and in so     doing imparts life to it. Modesty is very early taught to little     girls by their mothers, and with extreme jealousy, one might say,     by _esprit de corps_. They are watching in advance over the     happiness of the future lover. To a timid and tender woman there     ought to be no greater torture than to allow herself in the     presence of a man something which she thinks she ought to blush     at. I am convinced that a proud woman would prefer a thousand     deaths. A slight liberty taken on the tender side by the man she     loves gives a woman a moment of keen pleasure, but if he has the     air of blaming her for it, or only of not enjoying it with     transport, an awful doubt must be left in her mind. For a woman     above the vulgar level there is, then, everything to gain by very     reserved manners. The play is not equal. She hazards against a     slight pleasure, or against the advantage of appearing a little     amiable, the danger of biting remorse, and a feeling of shame     which must render even the lover less dear. An evening passed     gaily and thoughtlessly, without thinking of what comes after, is     dearly paid at this price. The sight of a lover with whom one     fears that one has had this kind of wrong must become odious for     several days. Can one be surprised at the force of a habit, the     slightest infractions of which are punished with such atrocious     shame? As to the utility of modesty, it is the mother of love. As     to the mechanism of the feeling, nothing is simpler. The mind is     absorbed in feeling shame instead of being occupied with desire.     Desires are forbidden, and desires lead to actions. It is evident     that every tender and proud woman--and these two things, being     cause and effect, naturally go together--must contract habits of     coldness which the people whom she disconcerts call prudery. The     power of modesty is so great that a tender woman betrays herself     with her lover rather by deeds than by words. The evil of     modesty is that it constantly leads to falsehood.\" (Stendhal, _De     l'Amour_, Chapter XXIV.)      It thus happens that, as Adler remarks (_Die Mangelhafte     Geschlechtsempfindung des Weibes_, p. 133), the sexual impulse in     women is fettered by an inhibition which has to be conquered. A     thin veil of reticence, shyness, and anxiety is constantly cast     anew over a woman's love, and her wooer, in every act of     courtship, has the enjoyment of conquering afresh an oft-won     woman.      An interesting testimony to the part played by modesty in     effecting the union of the sexes is furnished by the fact--to     which attention has often been called--that the special modesty     of women usually tends to diminish, though not to disappear, with     the complete gratification of the sexual impulses. This may be     noted among savage as well as among civilized women. The     comparatively evanescent character of modesty has led to the     argument (Venturi, _Degenerazioni Psico-sessuali_, pp. 92-93)     that modesty (_pudore_) is possessed by women alone, men     exhibiting, instead, a sense of decency which remains at about     the same level of persistency throughout life. Viazzi (\"Pudore     nell 'uomo e nella donna,\" _Rivista Mensile di Psichiatria     Forense_, 1898), on the contrary, following Sergi, argues that     men are, throughout, more modest than women; but the points he     brings forward, though often just, scarcely justify his     conclusion. While the young virgin, however, is more modest and     shy than the young man of the same age, the experienced married     woman is usually less so than her husband, and in a woman who is     a mother the shy reticences of virginal modesty would be rightly     felt to be ridiculous. (\"Les petites pudeurs n'existent pas pour     les mères,\" remarks Goncourt, _Journal des Goncourt_, vol. iii,     p. 5.) She has put off a sexual livery that has no longer any     important part to play in life, and would, indeed, be     inconvenient and harmful, just as a bird loses its sexual plumage     when the pairing season is over.      Madame Céline Renooz, in an elaborate study of the psychological     sexual differences between men and women (_Psychologie Comparée     de l'Homme et de la Femme_, 1898, pp. 85-87), also believes that     modesty is not really a feminine characteristic. \"Modesty,\" she     argues, \"is masculine shame attributed to women for two reasons:     first, because man believes that woman is subject to the same     laws as himself; secondly, because the course of human evolution     has reversed the psychology of the sexes, attributing to women     the psychological results of masculine sexuality. This is the     origin of the conventional lies which by a sort of social     suggestion have intimidated women. They have, in appearance at     least, accepted the rule of shame imposed on them by men, but     only custom inspires the modesty for which they are praised; it     is really an outrage to their sex. This reversal of psychological     laws has, however, only been accepted by women with a struggle.     Primitive woman, proud of her womanhood, for a long time     defended her nakedness which ancient art has always represented.     And in the actual life of the young girl to-day there is a moment     when, by a secret atavism, she feels the pride"]]]
