I thought you were unusually quiet coming home: is anything amiss with you?\"  \"Oh, no, papa! I've had a lovely time all day long. How kind you were to give us all a holiday and let me go along with the rest of you.\"  \"Good to myself as well as to you, my darlings; I could have had very little enjoyment leaving you behind.\"  \"Papa, it's so nice to have you love me so!\" she said, kissing him with ardent affection. \"Oh, I do hope I'll never, _never_ be very naughty again!\"  \"I hope not, dear child,\" he responded, returning her caresses. \"I hope you feel ready to resume your studies to-morrow, with diligence and painstaking?\"  \"Yes, papa, I think I do. It's almost a week since you have heard me recite; except the Sunday lesson yesterday.\"  \"Yes,\" he said gravely, \"it has been something of a loss to you in one way, but I trust a decided gain in another. Well to change the subject, are you pleased with the prospect of spending the holidays at Ion?\"  \"Yes, papa; I think it will be lovely; almost as nice as having a party of our own, as we did last year.\"  \"Possibly we may add that--a party here for a day or two--if Grandma Elsie does not use up all the holidays with hers,\" he said in a half jesting tone and with a pleasant laugh.  \"O papa, do you really think we may?\" she cried in delight. \"Oh you are just the kindest father!\" giving him a hug.  He laughed at that, returning the hug with interest.  \"I suppose you and Eva and the rest were laying out plans for Christmas doings this afternoon?\" he said inquiringly.  \"Yes, papa, we were talking a good deal about games and tableaux, and about the things we could buy or make for gifts to our friends, and what we would like to have given us.\"  She paused, half hoping he would ask what she wanted from him, but he did not. He sat silently caressing her hair and cheek with his hand, and seemingly lost in thought.  At length, \"Papa,\" she asked half hesitatingly, \"are you very rich?\"  \"Rich?\" he repeated, coming suddenly out of his reverie and looking smilingly down into her eyes, \"yes; I have a sound constitution, excellent health, a delightful home, a wife and five children, each one of whom I esteem worth at least a million to me; I live in a Christian land,\" he went on in a graver tone, \"I have the Bible with all its great and precious promises, the hope of a blessed eternity at God's right hand, and that all my dear ones are traveling heavenward with me; yes, I am a very rich man!\"  \"Yes, sir; but--I meant have you a great deal of money.\"  \"Enough to provide all that is necessary for the comfort of my family, and to gratify any reasonable desire on the part of my little girl. What is it you want, my darling?\"  \"Papa, I'm almost ashamed to tell you,\" she said, blushing and hanging her head; \"but if I do, and you can't afford it, won't you please say so and not feel sorry about it? because I wouldn't ever want you to spend money on me that you need for yourself or some of the others.\"  \"I am glad you are thoughtful for others as well as yourself, daughter,\" he said kindly; \"but don't hesitate to tell me all that is in your heart. Nothing pleases me better than to have you, and all my dear children do so.\"  \"Thank you, my dear, dear papa. I don't mean ever to hide anything from you,\" she returned, giving him another hug and kiss, while her eyes sparkled and her cheek flushed with pleasure. \"It's a diamond ring I'd like to have.\"  \"A diamond ring?\" he repeated in surprise. \"What would my little girl do with such a thing as that?\"  \"Wear it, papa. Maud Dinsmore has such beautiful one, that a rich aunt sent her the other day,\" she went on eagerly; \"there's a large diamond in the middle and little ones all round it, and it sparkles so, and looks just lovely on her hand! We all admired it ever so much, and I said I'd be wild with delight if I had such an one; then Sydney said, 'Why not give your father a hint that you'd like one for Christmas?' and I said I was afraid you couldn't afford to give me anything that would cost so much; but Maud said I needn't be, for you were worth millions of money. Can you really afford to give it to me, papa? I'd like it better than anything else if you can, but if you can't I don't want it,\" she concluded with a sigh, and creeping closer into his embrace.  He did not speak for a moment, but though grave and thoughtful his countenance was quite free from displeasure,--and when, at length, he spoke, his tones were very kind and affectionate.  \"If I thought it would really be for my little girl's welfare and happiness in the end,\" he said, \"I should not hesitate for a moment to gratify her in this wish of hers, but, daughter, the ornament you covet would be extremely unsuitable for one of your years, and I fear its possession would foster a love of finery that I do not wish to cultivate in you, because it is not right, and would hinder you in the race I trust you are running for the prize of eternal life.  \"The Bible tells us we can not serve both God and Mammon; can not love him and the world too.  \"'If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.' God has entrusted me with a good deal of money, but I hold it as his steward, and 'it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.'\"  \"I don't know what you mean, papa,\" she said, with look and tone of keen disappointment.  \"That I must use the Lord's money to do his work, daughter; a great deal of money is needed to help on the advancement of his cause and kingdom in the hearts of individuals, and in the world at large. There are millions of poor creatures in heathen lands who have never so much as heard of Jesus and his dying love; and even in our own favored country there are thousands who are sunk in poverty, ignorance and wretchedness. Money is needed to feed and clothe them, to send them teachers and preachers, and to build churches, schools, and colleges, where they can be educated and fitted for happiness and usefulness.  \"Suppose I had a thousand, or five thousand dollars, to spare after supplying my family with all that is necessary for health, comfort and happiness; could my dear eldest daughter be so selfish as to wish me to put it into a diamond ring for her at the expense of leaving some poor creature in want and misery? some poor heathen to die without the knowledge of Christ? some soul to be lost that Jesus died to save?\"  \"Oh no, no, papa!\" she exclaimed, tears starting to her eyes, \"I couldn't be so hard hearted. I couldn't bear to look at my ring if it had cost so much to other people.\"  \"No, I am sure you could not; and I believe you would find far more enjoyment, a far sweeter pleasure, in selecting objects for me to benefit by the money the ring might cost.\"  \"O papa, how nice, how delightful that would be if you would let me!\" she cried joyously.  \"I will,\" he said; \"I have some thousands to divide among the various religious and benevolent objects, and shall give a certain sum--perhaps as much as a thousand dollars--in the name of each of my three children who are old enough to understand these things, letting each of you select the cause, or causes, to which his or her share is to go.\"  \"Which are the causes, papa?\" she asked, her eyes sparkling with pleasure.  \"There are Home and Foreign Missions, the work among the freedmen, and for the destitute in our own neighborhood, beside very many others. We will read about these various objects and talk the matter over together, and finally decide how many we can help, and how much shall be given to each. Perhaps you may choose to support a little Indian girl in one of the Mission schools, or some child in heathen lands; or a missionary who will go and teach them the way to heaven.\"  \"Oh I should love to do that!\" she exclaimed, \"it will be better than having a ring. Papa, how good you are to me! I am so glad God gave me such a father; one who tries always to teach me how to serve Him and to help me to be the right kind of a Christian.\"  \"I want to help you in that, my darling,\" he said; \"I think I could do you no greater kindness.\"  Just then Max came into the room, and his father called him to take a seat by his side, saying, \"I am glad you have come, my son, for I was about to speak to Lulu on a subject that concerns you quite as nearly.\"  \"Yes, sir; I'll be glad to listen,\" replied Max, doing as directed.  The captain went on. \"The Bible tells us, 'If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.' If we are like Jesus in spirit, we will love others and be ready to deny ourselves to do them good; especially to save their souls; for to that end he denied himself even to the shameful and painful death of the cross.  \"He says, 'If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.... Whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.'  \"That is we cannot be his disciples without doing something to bring sinners to him that they may be saved; something that will cost us self-denial; it may be of our own ease, or of something we would like to do or have.  \"And it must be done willingly, cheerfully, from love to the dear Master and the souls he died to save, and not as the way to earn heaven for ourselves.  \"We can not merit salvation, do what we will; we must take it as God's free, undeserved gift.\"  There was a moment of thoughtful silence; then Max said, \"Papa, I think I am willing if I knew just what to do and how to do it. Can you tell me?\"  \"You have some money of your own every week; you can give what you will of that to held spread abroad the glad tidings of salvation; you can pray for others, and when a favorable opportunity offers, speak a word to lead them to Christ. Ask God to show you opportunities and give you grace and wisdom to use them. Try also, so to live, and act, and speak, that all who see and know you will, take knowledge of you that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14535"],["title","A Christmas Sermon (#1)"],["body","ts, stand in the relation of effect and cause. There was never anything less proved or less probable: our happiness is never in our own hands; we inherit our constitution; we stand buffet among friends and enemies; we may be so built as to feel a sneer or an aspersion with unusual keenness, and so circumstanced as to be unusually exposed to them; we may have nerves very sensitive to pain, and be afflicted with a disease very painful. Virtue will not help us, and it is not meant to help us. It is not even its own reward, except for the self-centred and--I had almost said--the unamiable. No man can pacify his conscience; if quiet be what he want, he shall do better to let that organ perish from disuse. And to avoid the penalties of the law, and the minor _capitis diminutio_ of social ostracism, is an affair of wisdom--of cunning, if you will--and not of virtue.  In his own life, then, a man is not to expect happiness, only to profit by it gladly when it shall arise; he is on duty here; he knows not how or why, and does not need to know; he knows not for what hire, and must not ask. Somehow or other, though he does not know what goodness is, he must try to be good; somehow or other, though he cannot tell what will do it, he must try to give happiness to others. And no doubt there comes in here a frequent clash of duties. How far is he to make his neighbour happy? How far must he respect that smiling face, so easy to cloud, so hard to brighten again? And how far, on the other side, is he bound to be his brother's keeper and the prophet of his own morality? How far must he resent evil?  The difficulty is that we have little guidance; Christ's sayings on the point being hard to reconcile with each other, and (the most of them) hard to accept. But the truth of his teaching would seem to be this: in our own person and fortune, we should be ready to accept and to pardon all; it is _our_ cheek we are to turn, _r_ coat that we are to give away to the man who has taken _our_ cloak. But when another's face is buffeted, perhaps a little of the lion will become us best. That we are to suffer others to be injured, and stand by, is not conceivable and surely not desirable. Revenge, says Bacon, is a kind of wild justice; its judgments at least are delivered by an insane judge; and in our own quarrel we can see nothing truly and do nothing wisely. But in the quarrel of our neighbour, let us be more bold. One person's happiness is as sacred as another's; when we cannot defend both, let us defend one with a stout heart. It is only in so far as we are doing this, that we have any right to interfere: the defence of B is our only ground of action against A. A has as good a right to go to the devil, as we to go to glory; and neither knows what he does.  The truth is that all these interventions and denunciations and militant mongerings of moral half-truths, though they be sometimes needful, though they are often enjoyable, do yet belong to an inferior grade of duties. Ill-temper and envy and revenge find here an arsenal of pious disguises; this is the playground of inverted lusts. With a little more patience and a little less temper, a gentler and wiser method might be found in almost every case; and the knot that we cut by some fine heady quarrel-scene in private life, or, in public affairs, by some denunciatory act against what we are pleased to call our neighbour's vices, might yet have been unwoven by the hand of sympathy.     IV   To look back upon the past year, and see how little we have striven and to what small purpose: and how often we have been cowardly and hung back, or temerarious and rushed unwisely in; and how every day and all day long we have transgressed the law of kindness;--it may seem a paradox, but in the bitterness of these discoveries, a certain consolation resides. Life is not designed to minister to a man's vanity. He goes upon his long business most of the time with a hanging head, and all the time like a blind child. Full of rewards and pleasures as it is--so that to see the day break or the moon rise, or to meet a friend, or to hear the dinner-call when he is hungry, fills him with surprising joys--this world is yet for him no abiding city. Friendships fall through, health fails, weariness assails him; year after year, he must thumb the hardly varying record of his own weakness and folly. It is a friendly process of detachment. When the time comes that he should go, there need be few illusions left about himself. _Here lies one who meant well, tried a little, failed much_:--surely that may be his epitaph, of which he need not be ashamed. Nor will he complain at the summons which calls a defeated soldier from the field: defeated, ay, if he were Paul or Marcus Aurelius!--but if there is still one inch of fight in his old spirit, undishonoured. The faith which sustained him in his life-long blindness and life-long disappointment will scarce even be required in this last formality of laying down his arms. Give him a march with his old bones; there, out of the glorious sun-coloured earth, out of the day and the dust and the ecstasy--there goes another Faithful Failure!  From a recent book of verse, where there is more than one such beautiful and manly poem, I take this memorial piece: it says better than I can, what I love to think; let it be our parting word.      \"A late lark twitters from the quiet skies;     And from the west,     Where the sun, his day's work ended,     Lingers as in content,     There falls on the old, gray city     An influence luminous and serene,     A shining peace.      \"The smoke ascends     In a rosy-and-golden haze. The spires     Shine, and are changed. In the valley     Shadows rise. The lark sings on. The sun,     Closing his benediction,     Sinks, and the darkening air     Thrills with a sense of the triumphing night--     Night, with her train of stars     And her great gift of sleep.      \"So be my passing!     My task accomplished and the long day done,     My wages taken, and in my heart     Some late lark singing,     Let me be gathered to the quiet west,     The sundown splendid and serene,     Death.\"[2]  [1888.]  [Footnote 2: From _A Book of Verses_ by William Ernest Henley.
