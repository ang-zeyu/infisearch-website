Other groups of friends, represented by the Ionides, the Prinseps, the Seniors, and the Russell Barringtons, seemed to have possessed him as their special treasure, in whose friendship he passed a great part of his life. Two great men, the titular chiefs of poetry and painting, were much impressed by him, and drew from him great admiration--Tennyson and Leighton; from the latter he learned much; in the sphere of music, of which Watts was passionately fond, there stands out Joachim the violinist.  Watts used to recall, as the happiest time in his life, his youthful days as a choral singer; and he always regretted that he had not become a musician. Besides being fond of singing he declared that he constantly heard (or felt) mystic music--symphonies, songs, and chorales. Only once did he receive a _vision_ of a picture--idea, composition and colours--that was \"Time, Death, and Judgment.\" Music, after all, is nearer to the soul of the intuitive man than any of the arts, and Watts felt this deeply. He also had considerable dramatic talent.  In 1864 some friends found for Watts a bride in the person of Miss Ellen Terry. The painter and the youthful actress were married in Kensington in February of that year, and Watts took over Little Holland House. The marriage, however, was irksome, both to the middle-aged painter and the vivacious child of sixteen, whose words, taken from her autobiography, are the best comment we possess on this incident:       \"Many inaccurate stories have been told of my brief married      life, and I have never contradicted them--they were so      manifestly absurd. Those who can imagine the surroundings into      which I, a raw girl, undeveloped in all except my training as      an actress, was thrown, can imagine the situation.... I      wondered at the new life and worshipped it because of its      beauty. When it suddenly came to an end I was thunderstruck;      and refused at first to consent to the separation which was      arranged for me in much the same way as my marriage had      been.... There were no vulgar accusations on either side, and      the words I read in the deed of separation, 'incompatibility      of temper,' more than covered the ground. Truer still would      have been 'incompatibility of _occupation_,' and the      interference of well-meaning friends.       \"'The marriage was not a happy one,' they will probably say      after my death, and I forestall them by saying that it was in      many ways very happy indeed. What bitterness there was effaced      itself in a very remarkable way.\" (_The Story of My Life_,      1908.)  In 1867, at the age of fifty, without his application or knowledge, Watts was made an Associate, and in the following year a full Member, of the Royal Academy. Younger men had preceded him in this honour, but doubtless Watts' modesty and independence secured for him a certain amount of official neglect. The old studio in Melbury Road, Kensington, was pulled down in 1868, and a new house was built suited to the painter who had chosen for himself a hermit life. The house was built in such a way as would avoid the possibility of entertaining guests, and was entirely dedicated to work. Watts continued his series of official portraits, and many of the most beautiful mythical paintings followed this change. Five years later, Watts was found at Freshwater in the Isle of Wight, and in 1876 he secured what he had so long needed, the sympathetic help and co-operation in his personal and artistic aims, in Mr. and Mrs. Russell Barrington, his neighbours.  In 1877 Watts decided, in conformity with his views on patriotic art, to give his pictures to the nation, and there followed shortly after, in 1881 and 1882, exhibitions of his works in Whitechapel and the Grosvenor Gallery. A leaflet entitled \"What should a picture say?\" issued with the approval of Watts, in connection with the Whitechapel Exhibition, has a characteristic answer to the question put to him.       \"Roughly speaking, a picture must be regarded in the same      light as written words. It must speak to the beholder and tell      him something.... If a picture is a representation only, then      regard it from that point of view only. If it treats of a      historical event, consider whether it fairly tells its tale.      Then there is another class of picture, that whose purpose is      to convey suggestion and idea. You are not to look at that      picture as an actual representation of facts, for it comes      under the same category of dream visions, aspirations, and we      have nothing very distinct except the sentiment. If the      painting is bad--the writing, the language of art, it is a      pity. The picture is then not so good as it should be, but the      thought is there, and the thought is what the artist wanted to      express, and it is or should be impressed on the spectator.\"  In 1886 his pictures were exhibited in New York, where they created a great sensation; but incidents connected with the exhibition, and criticisms upon it, caused the artist much nervous distress.  [Illustration: PLATE III.--HOPE  (At the Tate Gallery)       At the first glance it is rather strange that such a picture      should bear such a title, but the imagery is perfectly true.      The heavens are illuminated by a solitary star, and Hope bends      her ear to catch the music from the last remaining string of      her almost shattered lyre. The picture was painted in 1885 and      given to the nation in 1897. A very fine duplicate is in the      possession of Mrs. Rushton.]  It was a peculiar difficulty of his nature which led him to insist, on the occasions of the London and provincial exhibitions of his pictures, that the borrowers were to make all arrangements with his frame-maker, that he should not be called upon to act in any way, and that no personal reference should be introduced. Watts always considered himself a private person; he disliked public functions and fled from them if there were any attempt to draw attention to him. His habits of work were consistent with these unusual traits. At sunrise he was at his easel. During the hot months of summer he was hard at work in his London studio, leaving for the country only for a few weeks during foggy weather.  At the age of sixty-nine Watts married Miss Mary Fraser-Tytler, with whom he journeyed to Egypt, painting there a study of the \"Sphinx,\" one of the cleverest of his landscapes. Three years after his return, he settled at Limnerslease, Compton, in Surrey, where he took great interest in the attempt to revive industrial art among the rural population.  Twice, in 1885 and 1894, the artist refused, for private reasons, the baronetcy that other artists had accepted. He lived henceforth and died the untitled patriot and artist, George Frederick Watts.     II  THE MAN AND THE MESSENGER   Having given in the preceding pages the briefest possible outline of the life of Watts as a man amongst men, we are now able to come to closer quarters. He was essentially a messenger--a teacher, delivering to the world, in such a manner that his genius and temperament made possible, ideas which had found their place in his mind. He would have been the first to admit that without these ideas he would be less than nothing.  If it were possible to bring together all the external acts of the painter's life, his journeyings to and fro, his making and his losing friends, we should have insufficient data to enable us to understand Watts' message; his great ambitions, his constant failures, his intimate experiences, his reflections and determinations--known to none but himself--surely these, the internal life of Watts, are the real sources of his message? True, he was in the midst of the nineteenth century, breathing its atmosphere, familiar with the ideals of its great men, doubting, questioning, and hoping with the rest. To him, as to many a contemporary stoic, the world was in a certain sense an alien ground, and mortal life was to be stoically endured and made the best of. It is impossible to believe, however, that this inspiring and prophetic painter reproduced and handed on merely that which his time and society gave him. His day and his associates truly gave him much; the past and his heredity made their contributions; but we must believe that the purest gold was fired in the crucible of his inner experience, his joys and his sufferings. In him was accomplished that great discovery which the philosophers have called Pessimism; he not only saw in other men (as depicted in his memorable canvas of 1849), but he experienced in himself the transitory life's illusions. To Watts, the serious man of fifty years, Love and Death, Faith and Hope, Aspiration, Suffering, and Remorse, were not, as to the eighteenth-century rhymester, merely Greek ladies draped in flowing raiment; to him they were realities, intensely focussed in himself. Watts was giving of himself, of his knowledge and observation of what Love is and does, and how Death appears so variously; and who but a man who knew the melancholy of despair could paint that picture \"Hope\"?  Immediately after the central crisis of his personal life appeared the canvas entitled \"Fata Morgana,\" illustrative of a knight in vain pursuit of a phantom maiden; and before long there was from his brush the pictured story of a lost love, \"Orpheus and Eurydice,\" one of the saddest of all myths, but, one feels, no old myth to him.  By a more careful analysis of the artist's work we hope to learn the teaching Watts set himself to give, and to ascertain the means that he adopted; but one point needs to be made clear at this stage, namely, that although Watts was a great teacher, yet he was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13477"],["title","Watts (1817-1904) (#2)"],["body","a revolutionary. The ideals he held up were not new or strange, but old, well-tried, one might almost say conventional. They represent the ideals which, in the friction and turmoil of ages, have emerged as definite, clear, final. They are not disputed or dubious notions, but accepted truisms forgotten and neglected, waiting for the day when men shall live by them.  Furthermore, Watts was not in any sense a mystic--neither personally or as an artist. \"The Dweller in the Innermost\" is not the transcendental self known to a few rare souls, but is merely conscience, known to all. The biblical paintings have no secret meaning assigned to them. The inhabitants of Eden, the hero of the Deluge, the Hebrew patriarchs, Samson and Satan--all these are the familiar figures of the evangelical's Bible. \"Eve Repentant\" is the woman Eve, the mother of the race; \"Jacob and Esau\" are the brothers come to reconciliation; \"Jonah\" is the prophet denouncing the Nineveh of his day and the Babylon of this. The teaching--and there is teaching in every one of them--is plain and ethical. So also, with the Greek myths; they teach plainly--they hold no esoteric interpretations. Watts is no Neo-Platonist weaving mystical doctrines from the ancient hero tales; he is rather a stoic, a moralist, a teacher of earthly things.  But we must be careful to guard against the impression of Watts as a lofty philosopher consciously issuing proclamations by means of his art. Really he was not aware of being a philosopher at all; he was simply an artist, an exquisitely delicate and sensitive medium, who, when once before his canvas, suddenly filled with his idea, was compelled to say his word. If there be any synthesis about his finished work--and no one can deny this--it was not because Watts gave days and nights and years to \"thinking things out.\" His paintings are, as he used to call them, \"anthems,\" brought forth by the intuitive man, the musician. This was the fundamental Watts. Whatever unity there be, is due rather to unity of inspiration than to strength or definiteness of character and accomplishment, and this was sometimes referred to by Watts as a golden thread passing through his life--a thread of good intention--which he felt would guide him through the labyrinth of distractions, mistakes, irritations, ill health, and failures.  One of the striking incidents in the life of Watts was his offer to decorate Euston Railway Station with frescoes entitled \"The Progress of Cosmos.\" \"Chaos\" we have in the Tate Gallery, full of suggestiveness and interest. We see a deep blue sky above the distant mountains, gloriously calm and everlasting; in the middle distance to the left is a nebulous haze of light, while in the foreground the rocks are bursting open and the flames rush through. Figures of men, possessed by the energy and agony of creation, are seen wrestling with the elements of fire and earth. One of these figures, having done his work, floats away from the glow of the fire across the transparent water, while others of his creative family have quite passed the struggling stage of movement and are reclining permanent and gigantic to the right of the picture. The same idea is repeated in the chain of draped women who are emerging from the watery deep; at first they are swept along in isolation, then they fly in closer company, next they dance and finally walk in orderly procession. But Chaos, for all this, is a unity; of all material forms it is the most ancient form; Cosmos however is the long-drawn tale beginning with the day when \"The Spirit of God brooded on the face of the waters.\" Cosmos might have been Watts' synthetic pictorial philosophy; Herbert Spencer with his pen, and he with his brush, as it were, should labour side by side. But this was not to be; the Directors of the North-Western Railway declined the artist's generous offer, and he had to get his \"Cosmos\" painted by degrees. On the whole, perhaps, we should be thankful that the railway company liberated Watts from this self-imposed task. We remember that Dante in his exile set out to write \"Il Convivio,\" a Banquet of so many courses that one might tremble at the prospect of sitting down to it; the four treatises we have are interesting, though dry as dust; but if Dante had finished his Banquet, he might never have had time for his \"Divine Comedy\"; so perhaps, after all, we shall be well content to be without Watts' \"Cosmos,\" remembering what we have gained thereby. Besides, the continuous and spontaneous self-revelation of an artist or a poet is sometimes truer than a rigid predetermined plan.  [Illustration: PLATE IV.--THOMAS CARLYLE  (At the South Kensington Museum)       This canvas was painted in 1868, and is the earlier of the two      portraits of the famous historian painted by Watts. It formed      part of the Foster Bequest. It is interesting to compare this      with the painting in the National Portrait Gallery.]  A few words from the pen of the artist, appearing by way of preface to a book, \"A Plain Handicraft,\" may here be quoted to indicate the strong views Watts took on the \"Condition-of-England Question.\" His interest in art was not centred in painting, or sculpture, or himself, or his fellow artists. He believed in the sacred mission of art as applied to profane things. We see how closely he adheres to the point of view made so famous by Ruskin. Both Watts and Ruskin, one feels, belong rather to the days of Pericles, when everything was best in the state because the citizens gave themselves up to it and to each other. Writing of the necessity and utility of reviving Plain Handicrafts among the mass of the people, the painter of \"Mammon\" says:       \"... When the object is to vitalise and develop faculties--the      especial inheritance of the human race, but strangely dormant      in our time among the largest section of the community--the      claim becomes one that cannot be ignored. Looking at the      subject from a point of view commanding a wide horizon, it      seems to be nothing less than a social demand, rising into a      religious duty, to make every endeavour in the direction of      supplying all possible compensating consolation for the      routine of daily work, become so mechanical and dreary. When      home is without charm, and country without attaching bonds,      the existence of a nation is rudely shaken; dull discontent      leading to sullen discontent, may readily become active      animosity. There will not be men interested in the maintenance      of law and order, who feel that law and order bring them no      perceptible formal advantage. In the race for wealth, it has      been forgotten that wealth alone can offer neither dignity nor      permanent safety; no dignity, if the man of the population is      degraded by dull toil and disgraceful competition; no safety,      if large numbers drag on a discontented existence, while the      more active and intelligent leave our shores.       \"Whether or not our material wealth is to be increased or      diminished, it is certain that a more general well-being and      contentment must be striven for. A happy nation will be a      wealthy nation, wealthy in the best sense, in the assurance      that its children can be depended upon in case of need, wealth      above the fortune of war, and safety above the reach of      fortune. The rush of interest in the direction of what are      understood as worldly advantages, has trampled out the sense      of pleasure in the beautiful, and the need of its presence as      an element essential to the satisfaction of daily life, which      must have been unconsciously felt in ages less absorbed in      acquiring wealth for itself alone. In olden times our art      congresses would have been as needless as congresses to      impress on the general mind the advantages of money-making      would be in these.\" (_Plain Handicraft_, 1892.)  In G.F. Watts, however, we have an instance of a man who, although he sees and is attracted by abstract principles of ethics, does not perceive the manner of their final application; he is not really scientific. It might be thought that the painter of \"Greed and Toil,\" \"The Sempstress,\" \"Mammon,\" \"The Dweller of the Innermost,\" and \"Love Triumphant,\" would be able to indicate, in that sphere of social activity called \"practical politics,\" how these principles could find their expression and realisation. It is interesting, however, to know, and to have it authoritatively from his own pen, that Watts at least could not discern either the time or the application of these ethical principles to the affairs of the great world; for in 1901 there appeared from his hand a quasi-philosophical defence of the South African War, entitled \"Our Race as Pioneers.\" He said:       \"Inevitable social and political measures claim obedience,      which may be at variance with the spiritual and ethical      conscience; but there comes in the question of necessity,      apparent laws that contest with pure right and wrong; ... and      as we must live, nothing remains but commerce; and commerce      cannot be carried on without competition, and pushing the      limits of our interests. The result of competition can only be      conflict--war, unless some other outlet can be found. Commerce      will not supply this; its very activity, which is its health      and life, will produce the ambition, envy, and jarring      interests that will be fatal to peace.... The principle,      _Movement_, must have its outlet, its safety valve. This has      always been war.... The goddess Trade, the modern Pandora, has      in her box all the evils that afflict mankind.... How can      Commerce, as understood by the principles of trade, abolish      war?\"       \"The simple principles of right and wrong are easily      defined,\" and perhaps easily painted; \"but the complexity of      human affairs and legitimate interests, conducing to the"]]]
