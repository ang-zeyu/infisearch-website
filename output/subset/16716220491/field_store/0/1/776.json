She also should have a supply of sanitary cloths made of absorbent cotton fabric, or pads made of absorbent-cotton enclosed in gauze. The latter are especially convenient for the girl who is obliged to room away from home, for they may be burned, and the cost of new ones is no greater than the laundry of cloths. These pads or cloths should be changed at least twice a day. It also is necessary that one should bathe the parts in warm water with each change, as unpleasant odors can thereby be avoided. At the close of each period she should take a bath and change all clothing. One cannot be too careful about these matters, so essential to cleanliness and health.  During this period, girls naturally have a feeling of lassitude or disinclination to do any great mental or physical work, accompanied, perhaps, by a slight feeling of uneasiness in the pelvic region (the part of the body that contains the womb and ovaries). Because so many do suffer at this time, it often is considered \"natural\" and allowed to continue, but now that you know so much about the body you will understand that it is not necessary to have any pains at this period. If there is pain, it shows that we are not taking proper care of ourselves. Even our stomach will give us severe pain if we do not take proper care of it or if we overload it.  The monthly discharge varies in quantity with the individual. Usually fleshy girls flow more than thin ones, and dark complexioned girls than light ones. The discharge lasts about four days, and is the only symptom that many girls experience in menstruation. This usually is the case with those who are well and whose lives are happily employed.  I wanted you to know all these things, Violet, for sometimes when little girls do not understand what this flow means they are frightened when they see the blood. Some women even dread motherhood because they do not know what to expect at that time nor how to care for themselves. All women naturally love babies and if taught correctly would want to have them. If they do not, it usually is because they have known of other women suffering through ignorance and are afraid. If they would learn more about these wonderful bodies of ours and more about the care of little babies, they would understand how to care for themselves so as to have healthy, happy babies. Not only that but they would see it was the natural and the best thing for them to have children. In any work we undertake, in everything we do, there is a possibility of an accident. So it is in motherhood. A woman in normal health whose home life is congenial, who loves children and who desires to have one, never should have any serious trouble nor great pain. Painless childbirth is a possibility if women only understood the care of themselves.  The modern athletic girl glories in her strength. She feels it a disgrace to be a frail flower that cannot enter into the best enjoyment of life. She glories in her strong, well-trained body. She walks with free yet graceful step, holding her head high, for she knows she is queen of her kingdom--her body. Her lungs are well developed and her body well cared for, so she has no fear of disease. But the modern girl does not stop there. She wants to have healthy sexual organs with room for development of the babe, and strong muscles to perform their work in expelling the babe. So she discards clothing that restricts her organs. She wears comfortable, well-fitting clothes. The old-fashioned corsets pushed the organs out of place, but the modern ones, made to conform to nature's lines, serve only as a support. As nature did not make a waist line, the one-piece dresses are especially desirable. Besides developing every organ and muscle of her body and training her mind, the modern girl goes to a training school to prepare for the mother calling. Recently, in a few schools, a course of study has been provided for the girls in the care of children, hygiene and nursing. Even women who never become mothers themselves in this way learn general principles of psychology, hygiene and the care of the sick that they might make use of in every station of life. I hope, Violet, that after a while you will be able to learn many of these things, so that when you are a grown woman and the time comes for you to marry and have a baby you will know just how to care for it.            *       *       *       *       *    Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.

This they do by providing it with food and by carrying away the waste material. We found the body was composed of many parts or organs, each one of which had its own especial work to do. If any one organ could not perform its work, some other one would have to assist it, but, although the organs are willing to help each other, it would not be fair to make one do more than its share of work, except for a short time.  You remember, the stomach had a great deal of work to do in digesting the food or preparing it so it could be taken up by the blood and carried to the womb and all parts of the body. But the stomach does not have to do this all alone. It has several helpers. One set of helpers is the teeth, which cut and grind the food into small particles. In order to do this, they must be kept in very good condition; otherwise, they could not do their work. You know if your mother would let the kitchen knives get dull or rusty, she would be unable to cut the bread, meat and other food materials with them. The same is true of the teeth. We can keep them in good condition by brushing them. It is as important to do this as to wash the dishes. Then, too, we must be careful not to break the teeth by biting nuts and other hard things. Nothing so detracts from a girl's appearance and nothing is more conducive to indigestion than poorly cared for teeth. They should be brushed at least twice daily and the mouth afterwards rinsed with a mild antiseptic solution. The teeth should be thoroughly examined by a good dentist at least every six months.  Another assistant that the stomach has is the intestines or bowels, which not only help to digest the food but also carry off the waste material. The bowels are very good, and will tell us when they have waste material to be disposed of, but sometimes people are too busy and do not pay attention. If we neglect them many times the bowels get tired of telling us, and then their work is not done. We think they are lazy and so we try to whip them up by taking a laxative. This seems to help at first, but we soon find we have to do the same thing every day. All this time the fault was our own, for we did not understand. The best way is to have a regular time of going to the toilet, say, right after breakfast. If we always go at the same time the bowels will remember it. Then we need have no trouble with constipation nor take any horrid medicine to whip the bowels. A regular daily action of the bowels is necessary to health. Constipation often may be relieved by drinking a glass of cold water upon rising, at intervals during the day, and upon retiring. Fruit at breakfast or figs taken after meals often will relieve a tendency to constipation. Regularity in going to the toilet is one of the most important measures in treating constipation. Laxatives or cathartics should not be taken except for an occasional dose or during illness, upon the advice of a physician. So common is the practice of taking daily laxatives that it has become a \"national curse.\" People do not realize that they are slaves to this habit. So cleverly worded are the advertisements of many of the laxatives that people are led to believe that if they drink certain \"waters\" or \"teas\" they are avoiding medicine, while often these same teas and waters contain drugs more powerful and harmful than any pill.  The bowels have some one to assist them, too, for the kidneys carry off much of the waste material of the body. Indeed, they carry off so much that they sometimes are called the sewers. It often is necessary to flush the sewers of the city, that is, to send quantities of water through them to clean the system. In the same way it is necessary to flush the kidneys. We do this by drinking plenty of water. Every one should drink about two quarts of water a day.  There is another worker that helps both the kidneys and the bowels. This is the skin, which sends off waste material through the tiny pores or openings. If dirt accumulates on the skin, it clogs the pores so the skin cannot use them. So you see how necessary it is to take frequent baths to keep the pores open.  Other helpers that carry some of the waste material from the body are the lungs, which send out the impure air. The lungs also take in the pure air, which, you remember, helps to make the red coloring matter in the blood. If you want to have nice red cheeks, you must breathe in plenty of fresh air. Also you must have plenty of exercise, so as to help send the blood all over the body. You know when you run, the blood flows much faster than when you are quiet. It is a good plan to stand by an open window every morning and every evening and fill your lungs with good, pure air, taking about twenty-five deep breaths.            *       *       *       *       *    I want to help you to grow as beautiful as God meant you to be when   He thought of you first.

The Commission sat from January 19 to February 25,     1905, and its report was the means of terminating a period of     great tension in the relations of the two Powers concerned (see     _Parl. Paper_, Russia, 1905, No. 3): this letter deals also     with Arbitration, under The Hague Convention of 1899.      It may be worth while here to point out that besides direct     negotiation between the Powers concerned, four friendly methods     for the settlement of questions at issue between them are now     recognised, _viz_ (1) Good offices and mediation of third     Powers; (2) \"Special mediation\"; (3) \"International Commissions     of Enquiry\"; (4) Arbitration. All four were recommended by The     Hague Convention of 1899 \"For the Peaceful Settlement of     International Disputes\" (by which, indeed, (2) and (3) were     first suggested), as also by the amended re-issue of that     convention in 1907. It must be noticed that resort to any of     these methods is entirely discretionary, so far as any rule of     International Law is concerned; all efforts to render it     universally and unconditionally obligatory having, perhaps     fortunately, hitherto failed.      It remains to be seen how far the settlement of international     controversies has been facilitated by the establishment of a     \"League of Nations\" (to which reference is made in the     concluding letters of this chapter), and, in particular, by the     plan for the establishment of a \"Permanent Court of     International Justice,\" formulated by the League, in pursuance     of Art. 14 of the Treaty of Versailles, and submitted to its     members in December, 1920.    THE PETITION TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  Sir,--It seems that a respectably, though perhaps thoughtlessly signed petition was on Thursday presented to President McKinley, urging him to offer his good offices to bring to an end the war now being waged in South Africa. From the _New York World_ cablegram, it would appear that the President was requested to take this step \"in accordance with Art. 3 of the protocol of the Peace Conference at The Hague.\" The reference intended is doubtless to the _Convention pour le règlement pacifique des conflits internationaux_, prepared at the Conference [of 1899], Art. 3 of which is to the following effect:--        \"Les Puissances signataires jugent utile qu'une ou plusieurs       Puissances étrangères au conflit offrent de leur propre       initiative, en tant que les circonstances s'y prêtent, leurs       bons offices ou leur médiation aux États en conflit.        \"Le droit d'offrir les bons offices ou la médiation appartient       aux Puissances étrangères au conflit, même pendant le cours       des hostilités.        \"L'exercice de ce droit ne peut jamais être considéré par       l'une ou l'autre des parties en litige comme un acte peu       amical.\"  Several remarks are suggested by the presentation of this petition:--  (1) One might suppose from the glib reference here and elsewhere made to The Hague Convention, that this convention is already in force, whereas it is [1899], in the case of most, if not all, of the Powers represented at the conference, a mere unratified draft, under the consideration of the respective Governments.  (2) The article, if it were in force, would impose no duty of offering good offices, but amounts merely to the expression of opinion that an offer of good offices is a useful and unobjectionable proceeding, in suitable cases (_en tant que les circonstances s'y prêtent_). It cannot for a moment be supposed that the President would consider that an opportunity of the kind contemplated was offered by the war in South Africa.  (3) One would like to know at what date, if at all, the Prime Minister of the British colony of the Cape was pleased, as is alleged, to follow the lead of the Presidents of the two Boer Republics in bestowing his grateful approval upon the petition in question.  Your obedient servant, T. E. HOLLAND. Oxford, October 28 (1899).       _Par._ 2 (1).--The Convention of 1899 was ratified by Great     Britain, on September 4, 1900; and between that year and 1907     practically all civilised Powers ratified or acceded to it. It     is now, for almost all Powers, superseded by The Hague     Convention, No. i. of 1907, which, reproduces Art. 3 of the     older Convention, inserting, however, after the word \"utile,\"     the words \"et désirable.\"      _Ib._ (2).--On March 6, 1900, the two Boer Republics proposed     that peace should be made on terms which included the     recognition of their independence. Great Britain having, on     March 11, declared such recognition to be inadmissible, the     European Powers which were requested to use their good offices     to bring this about declined so to intervene. The President of     the United States, however, in a note delivered in London on     March 13, went so far as to \"express an earnest hope that a way     to bring about peace might be found,\" and to say that he would     aid \"in any friendly manner to bring about so happy a result.\"     Lord Salisbury, on the following day, while thanking the United     States Government, replied that \"H.M. Government does not     propose to accept the intervention of any Power in the South     African War.\" Similar replies to similar offers had been made     both by France and Prussia in 1870, and by the United States in     1898.   COMMISSIONS OF ENQUIRY AND THE HAGUE CONVENTION  Sir,--It is just now [1904] especially desirable that the purport of those provisions of The Hague Convention \"for the peaceful settlement of international controversies\" which deal with \"international commissions of enquiry\" should be clearly understood. It is probably also desirable that a more correct idea should be formed of the effect of that convention, as a whole, than seems to be generally prevalent. You may, therefore, perhaps, allow me to say a few words upon each of these topics.  Art. 9 of the convention contains an expression of opinion to the effect that recourse to an international commission of enquiry into disputed questions of fact would be useful. This recommendation is, however, restricted to \"controversies in which neither honour nor essential interests are involved,\" and is further limited by the phrase \"so far as circumstances permit.\" Two points are here deserving of notice.  In the first place, neither \"the honour and vital interests clause,\" as seems to be supposed by your correspondent Mr. Schidrowitz, nor the clause as to circumstances permitting, is in any way modified by the article which follows. Art. 10 does not enlarge the scope of Art. 9, but merely indicates the procedure to be followed by Powers desirous of acting under it. In the second place, it is wholly unimportant whether or no the scope of Art. 9 is enlarged by Art. 10. The entire liberty of the Powers to make any arrangement which may seem good to them for clearing up their differences is neither given, nor impaired, by the articles in question, to which the good sense of the Conference declined to attach any such obligatory force as had been proposed by Russia. It may well be that disputant Powers may at any time choose to agree to employ the machinery suggested by those articles, or something resembling it, in cases of a far more serious kind than those to which alone the convention ventured to make its recommendation applicable; and this is the course which seems to have been followed by the Powers interested with reference to the recent lamentable occurrence in the North Sea.  As to the convention as a whole, it is important to bear in mind that, differing in this respect from the two other conventions concluded at The Hague, it is of a non-obligatory character, except in so far as it provides for the establishment of a permanent tribunal at The Hague, to which, however, no Power is bound to resort. It resembles not so much a treaty as a collection of \"pious wishes\" (_voeux_), such as those which were also adopted at The Hague. The operative phrases of most usual occurrence in the convention are, accordingly, such as \"jugent utile\"; \"sont d'accord pour recommander\"; \"est reconnu comme le moyen le plus efficace\"; \"se réservent de conclure des accords nouveaux, en vue d'étendre l'arbitrage obligatoire à tous les cas qu'elles jugeront possible de lui soumettre.\"  It is a matter for rejoicing that, in accordance with the suggestion contained in the phrase last quoted,"]]]
