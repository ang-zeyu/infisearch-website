Presently they were in front of the beautiful Peristyle, gazing in awed admiration upon its grand Arch of Triumph, its noble colonnade and statuary, and catching glimpses here and there between its pillars of the beauties beyond.  It was impetuous Lulu who broke the silence with an exclamation of delighted admiration and an eager request that they might land at once and get a nearer view of the fairy scenes that lay before them on the farther side.  The other members of their party, old and young, seemed scarcely less eager, and in a very few moments they were all pacing that grand colonnade to and fro, and gazing out delightedly now upon the blue waters of the lake and anon upon the fairy scene--the Court of Honor--on the inner side. And soon they hurried their steps thitherward.  \"Oh, there,\" cried Lulu, \"is the statue of our great republic! Is she not magnificent?\"  \"She is, indeed!\" replied Grandma Elsie. \"See in one hand she holds a pole bearing a liberty cap, in the other a globe, an eagle with outstretched wings resting upon it; that symbolizes protection, which she has ever been ready to extend to the oppressed of all the earth.\"  \"She is a large woman,\" remarked Walter; \"as she should be to adequately represent our great country. Grandpa, do you know her size?\"  \"I saw it stated the other day,\" replied Mr. Dinsmore. \"Her face is fifteen feet long, her arms thirty feet, forefingers forty-five inches, and ten inches in diameter. Her cost was twenty-five thousand dollars; the gilding alone amounting to fourteen hundred dollars; quite an expensive dress for my lady.\"  \"But we don't grudge it to her, papa,\" remarked Grandma Elsie pleasantly.  \"No,\" he said; \"nor anything else the liberty she represents has cost--in money or in life and limb.\"  \"But what is her height, grandpa?\" asked Rosie; \"it should be very considerable to go with a face fifteen feet long.\"  \"Sixty-five feet, and the pedestal on which she stands is thirty feet above water. There is a stairway inside which you can climb one of these days if you wish.\"  All were gazing with great admiration and interest upon the beautiful statue, though seeing it somewhat dimly through the gathering shades of evening, when suddenly the electric lights blazed out from all sides, causing an exclamation of surprise and delight from almost everyone in our party and from others who witnessed the wonderful and inspiring sight; words failed them to express their sense of the loveliness of the scene; that mighty statue of the Republic dominating the eastern end of the lagoon, that grandly beautiful Macmonie's Fountain at the other, its Goddess of Liberty seated aloft in her chair on the deck of her bark, erect and beautiful, with her eight maiden gondoliers plying the oars at the sides, while old Father Time steered the vessel, his scythe fastened to the tiller, Fame as a trumpet-herald stood on the prow with her trumpet in her hand, while in the gushing waters below sported the tritons with their plunging horses, the terraced fountain still lower with its clouds of spray showing all the colors of the rainbow, as did that of the smaller ones to the right and left.  And what a ravishing sight was that of the Administration Building with its corona of light, its dome, arches, and angles outlined with those brilliant lights, as were those of the Peristyle also, and of the grand structures between--Manufactures, Electricity, and Arts on the north side, Machinery and Agriculture on the south--and the beautiful fountains throwing spray of all the colors of the rainbow.  \"What a magnificent sight!\" \"How lovely!\" \"How beautiful!\" exclaimed one and another as they moved slowly onward, gazing from side to side.  \"Let us go into the Administration Building,\" said Mr. Dinsmore.  All were willing, and they sauntered on toward it, still gazing delightedly as they went.  Reaching its doorway they paused for a few moments to look at the statue of Columbus, represented as landing with the Spanish flag in his hand, and to listen to the inspiring music of the bands; then passed on into the interior which they found as artistic and wondrously beautiful as the outside.  After feasting their eyes upon the lower part they took an elevator--of which there were six--and went up to the upper promenade, which they found also very beautiful, giving lovely views of the surrounding grounds. The vault of the dome was ornamented with allegorical paintings, some of them commemorating Columbus' discovery of America.  Looking out from the promenade under the dome they saw the Ferris Wheel, upon which they gazed with a good deal of interest.  \"I must have a ride in that,\" said Walter emphatically, \"and mamma, you will go with me, will you not?\"  \"Is it quite safe?\" she asked, looking from her father to the captain.  \"Oh, yes,\" they both replied, Mr. Dinsmore adding, \"and I think we will all want to go once if not oftener.\"  \"Go where, grandpa?\" asked a familiar voice, and turning quickly about they found Harold and Herbert close at hand.  Then there was an exchange of joyous greetings, and enquiries were made concerning some others of the family connection who had come by rail.  The answer was that some of the little ones were in bed at the hotel where boarding had been taken by the party, and in charge of the faithful attendants brought from home, while the older ones were scattered about the Court of Honor and other portions of the Fair.  \"We have been on the lookout for you,\" continued Harold, \"and only a few minutes ago discovered the _Dolphin_ lying at anchor down yonder on the lake. We had hoped you would be here sooner.\"  \"Yes, we thought we should have been here weeks ago,\" replied his mother, \"but as the delays were providential we did not fret over them.\"  \"If you had fretted, mother, it would have been truly surprising, as I never knew you to do so about anything,\" Herbert said, smiling affectionately into her eyes.  \"No, that was never one of her faults,\" remarked Mr. Dinsmore.  \"No, indeed!\" exclaimed Rosie. \"But Harold, can you take us to the others? I am sure it would be pleasanter for us all to be together.\"  \"I cannot promise certainly,\" he replied, \"but if we walk about the Court of Honor we will come across each other finally, no doubt, as they will presently discover the _Dolphin_ and look about here for you.\"  \"Yes,\" returned his mother, \"they will surely know that we could not persuade ourselves to go farther to-night than this bewitchingly beautiful Court of Honor.\"  Even as she spoke all were moving toward the elevator nearest them, and in a few moments they were again strolling along the shores of the lagoon, gazing with delighted eyes upon the fairylike scene--imposing buildings, playing fountains, the waters of the lagoon dancing in the moonbeams, and the pretty crafts gliding over them filled with excursionists whose merry voices and laughter mingled pleasantly with the music of the bands.  \"Oh, this is just delightful, delightful!\" exclaimed Lulu. \"Father, dear, I hope you will let us stay a long, long while.\"  \"I have not thought of fixing the time for departure yet,\" returned the captain, \"and if our friends intend to go home in the _Dolphin_, as they came, there will be a number of voices entitled to a vote on the question. My wife for one,\" glancing down fondly upon the beautiful, graceful lady on his arm.  \"Thank you, my dear,\" returned Violet. \"I certainly feel no desire to start for home yet, dear and lovely as I esteem it.\"  \"Oh, here they are!\" cried a familiar voice at that instant, and the two sets of relatives had found each other. Glad greetings and kind enquiries were exchanged. Then they broke up into little groups and sauntered on through the beautiful scene till it was time to seek their resting places for the night, when, after making some arrangements for the sight-seeing of the next day, they bade good-night and hied them to their several places of temporary abode.     CHAPTER III.   \"On, we have a lovely view from here!\" remarked Lulu as they reached the _Dolphin's_ deck. \"I'm not at all sleepy, papa; can't I sit here for a while?\"  Grace was saying, \"Good-night, papa.\"  He returned it with a fatherly caress, then answered Lulu's query.  \"No, daughter; it is long past your usual hour for retiring, and as I want you to feel fresh and bright for to-morrow's pleasure, you, too, may bid me good-night and go at once to your berth.\"  \"Oh, yes, sir, that will be the best, I know,\" she said, rising promptly from the seat she had taken, and with a loving look up into his face--for he was close at her side now. \"What a happy thing it is for me that I have such a kind, wise father to take care of me!\"  \"A father whose strong desire it certainly is to make you and all his children as happy as possible,\" he said, laying a hand on her head and looking fondly down into her eyes. \"Good-night, daughter, and don't hesitate to call me if anything should go wrong with you or Grace.\"  \"Am I also under orders to retire, sir?\" asked Violet with a mischievous smile up into his face, as Lulu bade good-night to the rest of the company and disappeared down the companion-way.  \"Not from me,\" he said, pleasantly taking a seat at her side as he spoke. \"Have I not told you many times that my wife does what she pleases? At least, if she fails to do so it is in consequence of no order from me.\"  \"No; you have never given me one yet, and I believe I should like you to do so for once that I may see how it feels,\" she added with a low, musical laugh, slipping her hand"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1493"],["title","The Legends of the Jews — Volume 1 (#1)"],["body"," the later learned additions. Hardly a beginning has been made in this direction. But as long as the task of distinguishing them has not been accomplished, it is impossible to write out the Biblical legends of the Jews without including the supplemental work of scholars in the products of the popular fancy.  In the present work, \"The Legends of the Jews,\" I have made the first attempt to gather from the original sources all Jewish legends, in so far as they refer to Biblical personages and events, and reproduce them with the greatest attainable completeness and accuracy. I use the expression Jewish, rather than Rabbinic, because the sources from which I have levied contributions are not limited to the Rabbinic literature. As I expect to take occasion elsewhere to enter into a description of the sources in detail, the following data must suffice for the present.  The works of the Talmudic Midrashic literature are of the first importance. Covering the period from the second to the fourteenth century, they contain the major part of the Jewish legendary material. Akin to this in content if not always in form is that derived from the Targumim, of which the oldest versions were produced not earlier than the fourth century, and the most recent not later than the tenth. The Midrashic literature has been preserved only in fragmentary form. Many Haggadot not found in our existing collections are quoted by the authors of the Middle Ages. Accordingly, a not inconsiderable number of the legends here printed are taken from medieval Bible commentators and homilists. I was fortunate in being able to avail myself also of fragments of Midrashim of which only manuscript copies are extant.  The works of the older Kabbalah are likewise treasuries of quotations from lost Midrashim, and it was among the Kabbalists, and later among the Hasidim, that new legends arose. The literatures produced in these two circles are therefore of great importance for the present purpose.  Furthermore, Jewish legends can be culled not from the writings of the Synagogue alone; they appear also in those of the Church. Certain Jewish works repudiated by the Synagogue were accepted and mothered by the Church. This is the literature usually denominated apocryphal-pseudepigraphic. From the point of view of legends, the apocryphal books are of subordinate importance, while the pseudepigrapha are of fundamental value. Even quantitatively the latter are an imposing mass. Besides the Greek writings of the Hellenist Jews, they contain Latin, Syrian, Ethiopic, Aramean, Arabic, Persian, and Old Slavic products translated directly or indirectly from Jewish works of Palestinian or Hellenistic origin. The use of these pseudepigrapha requires great caution. Nearly all of them are embellished with Christian interpolations, and in some cases the inserted portions have choked the original form so completely that it is impossible to determine at first sight whether a Jewish or a Christian legend is under examination. I believe, however, that the pseudepigraphic material made use of by me is Jewish beyond the cavil of a doubt, and therefore it could not have been left out of account in a work like the present.  However, in the appreciation of Jewish Legends, it is the Rabbinic writers that should form the point of departure, and not the pseudepigrapha. The former represent the main stream of Jewish thought and feeling, the latter only an undercurrent. If the Synagogue cast out the pseudepigrapha, and the Church adopted them with a great show of favor, these respective attitudes were not determined arbitrarily or by chance. The pseudepigrapha originated in circles that harbored the germs from which Christianity developed later on. The Church could thus appropriate them as her own with just reason.  In the use of some of the apocryphal and pseudepigraphic writings, I found it expedient to quote the English translations of them made by others, in so far as they could be brought into accord with the general style of the book, for which purpose I permitted myself the liberty of slight verbal changes. In particulars, I was guided, naturally, by my own conception of the subject, which the Notes justify in detail.  Besides the pseudepigrapha there are other Jewish sources in Christian garb. In the rich literature of the Church Fathers many a Jewish legend lies embalmed which one would seek in vain in Jewish books. It was therefore my special concern to use the writings of the Fathers to the utmost.  The luxuriant abundance of the material to be presented made it impossible to give a verbal rendition of each legend. This would have required more than three times the space at my disposal. I can therefore claim completeness for my work only as to content. In form it had to suffer curtailment. When several conflicting versions of the same legend existed, I gave only one in the text, reserving the other one, or the several others, for the Notes, or, when practicable, they were fused into one typical legend, the component parts of which are analyzed in the Notes. In other instances I resorted to the expedient of citing one version in one place and the others in other appropriate places, in furtherance of my aim, to give a smooth presentation of the matter, with as few interruptions to the course of the narrative as possible. For this reason I avoided such transitional phrases as \"Some say,\" \"It has been maintained,\" etc. That my method sometimes separates things that belong together cannot be considered a grave disadvantage, as the Index at the end of the work will present a logical rearrangement of the material for the benefit of the interested student. I also did not hesitate to treat of the same personage in different chapters, as, for instance, many of the legends bearing upon Jacob, those connected with the latter years of the Patriarch, do not appear in the chapter bearing his name, but will be found in the sections devoted to Joseph, for the reason that once the son steps upon the scene, he becomes the central figure, to which the life and deeds of the father are subordinated. Again, in consideration of lack of space the Biblical narratives underlying the legends had to be omitted—surely not a serious omission in a subject with which widespread acquaintance may be presupposed as a matter of course.  As a third consequence of the amplitude of the material, it was thought advisable to divide it into several volumes. The references, the explanations of the sources used, and the interpretations given, and, especially, numerous emendations of the text of the Midrashim and the pseudepigrapha, which determined my conception of the passages so emended, will be found in the last volume, the fourth, which will contain also an Introduction to the History of Jewish Legends, a number of Excursuses, and the Index.  As the first three volumes are in the hands of the printer almost in their entirety, I venture to express the hope that the whole work will appear within measurable time, the parts following each other at short intervals.  LOUIS GINZBERG.   NEW YORK, March 24, 1909     I THE CREATION OF THE WORLD  THE FIRST THINGS CREATED  In the beginning, two thousand years before the heaven and the earth, seven things were created: the Torah written with black fire on white fire, and lying in the lap of God; the Divine Throne, erected in the heaven which later was over the heads of the Hayyot; Paradise on the right side of God, Hell on the left side; the Celestial Sanctuary directly in front of God, having a jewel on its altar graven with the Name of the Messiah, and a Voice that cries aloud, \"Return, ye children of men.\"[1]  When God resolved upon the creation of the world, He took counsel with the Torah.[2] Her advice was this: \"O Lord, a king without an army and without courtiers and attendants hardly deserves the name of king, for none is nigh to express the homage due to him.\" The answer pleased God exceedingly. Thus did He teach all earthly kings, by His Divine example, to undertake naught without first consulting advisers.[3]  The advice of the Torah was given with some reservations. She was skeptical about the value of an earthly world, on account of the sinfulness of men, who would be sure to disregard her precepts. But God dispelled her doubts. He told her, that repentance had been created long before, and sinners would have the opportunity of mending their ways. Besides, the Temple service would be invested with atoning power, and Paradise and hell were intended to do duty as reward and punishment. Finally, the Messiah was appointed to bring salvation, which would put an end to all sinfulness.[4]  Nor is this world inhabited by man the first of things earthly created by God. He made several worlds before ours, but He destroyed them all, because He was pleased with none until He created ours.[5] But even this last world would have had no permanence, if God had executed His original plan of ruling it according to the principle of strict justice. It was only when He saw that justice by itself would undermine the world that He associated mercy with justice, and made them to rule jointly.[6] Thus, from the beginning of all things prevailed Divine goodness, without which nothing could have continued to exist. If not for it, the myriads of evil spirits had soon put an end to the generations of men. But the goodness of God has ordained, that in every Nisan, at the time of the spring equinox, the seraphim shall approach the world of spirits, and intimidate them so that they fear to do harm to men. Again, if God in His goodness had not given protection to the weak, the tame animals would have been extirpated long ago by the wild animals. In Tammuz, at the time of the summer solstice, when the strength of behemot is at its height, he roars so loud that all the animals hear it, and for a whole year they are affrighted and timid, and their acts become less ferocious than their nature is.
