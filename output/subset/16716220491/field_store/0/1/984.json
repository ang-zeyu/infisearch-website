I'm sorry that's the way yeh feel. 'Twill take yeh all yer time to make the book.\" . . . An' then Doreen sends me a wireless look.  I gets the S.O.S.; but Begg is keen.   \"My deal,\" 'e yaps. \"Wot rotten cards I get.\" Ole Missus Flood sits closer to Doreen.   \"The best,\" she whispers, \"I ain't told yeh yet.\" I strains me ears, an' leads me King uv Trumps. \"Ace 'ere!\" grins Begg. Poole throws 'is Queen--an' thumps.  \"That saves me Jack!\" 'owls Begg. \"Tough luck, ole sport.\" . . .   Sez Missus Flood, \"Jim's won a medal too For doin' somethin' brave at Bullycourt.\" . . .   \"Play on, play on,\" growls Begg. \"It's up to you.\" Then I reneges, an' trumps me partner's Ace, An' Poole gets sudden murder in 'is face.  \"I'm sick uv this 'ere game,\" 'e grunts. \"It's tame.\"   \"Righto,\" I chips. \"Suppose we toss it in?\" Begg don't say nothin'; so we sling the game.   On my wife's face I twigs a tiny grin. \"Finished?\" sez she, su'prised. \"Well, p'r'aps it's right. It looks to me like 'earts was trumps to-night.\"  An' so they was.  An', say, the game was grand.   Two hours we sat while that ole mother told About 'er Jim, 'is letter in 'er 'and,   An', on 'er face, a glowin' look that rolled The miles all up that lie 'twixt France an' 'ere, An' found 'er son, an' brought 'im very near.  A game uv Bridge it was, with 'earts for trumps.   We was the dummies, sittin' silent there. I knoo the men, like me, was feelin' chumps:   Foolin' with cards while this was in the air. It took Doreen to shove us in our place;   An' mother 'eld the lot, right from the Ace.  She told us 'ow 'e said 'e'd writ before,   An' 'ow the letters must lave gone astray; An' 'ow the stern ole father still was sore,   But looked like 'e'd be soft'nin', day by day; 'Ow pride in Jim peeps out be'ind 'is frown, An' 'ow the ole fool 'opes to 'ide it down.  \"I knoo,\" she sez. \"I never doubted Jim.   But wot could any mother say or do When pryin' folks asked wot become uv 'im,   But drop 'er eyes an' say she never knoo. Now I can lift me 'ead to that sly glance, An' say, 'Jim's fightin', with the rest, in France.'\"  An' when she's gone, us four we don't require   No gossipin' to keep us in imploy. Ole Poole sits starin' 'ard into the fire.   I guessed that 'e was thinkin' uv 'is boy, 'Oo's been right in it from the very start; An' Poole was thinkin' uv a father's part.  An' then 'e speaks: \"This war 'as turned us 'ard.   Suppose, four year ago, yeh said to me That I'd sit 'eedless, starin' at a card   While that ole mother told--Good Lord!\" sez 'e \"It takes the women for to put us wise To playin' games in war-time,\" an' 'e sighs.  An' 'ere Doren sets out to put 'im right.  \"There's games an' games,\" she sez.  \"When women starts A hand at Bridge like she 'as played to-night   It's Nature teachin' 'em to make it 'earts. The other suits are yours,\" she sez; \"but then, That's as it should be, seein' you are men.\"  \"Maybe,\" sez Poole; an' both gits up to go.   I stands beside the door when they are gone, Watchin' their lantern swingin' to an' fro,   An' 'ears Begg's voice as they goes trudgin' on: \"If you 'ad led that Queen we might 'ave made. . . .\" \"Rubbidge!\" shouts Poole.  \"You mucked it with yer Spade!\"     III. DAD   Dad   I've knowed ole Flood this last five year or more; I knoo 'im when 'is Syd went to the war.   A proud ole man 'e was. But I've watched 'im,   An' seen 'is look when people spoke uv Jim: As sour a look as most coves want to see. It made me glad that this 'ere Jim weren't me.  I sized up Flood the first day that we met-- Stubborn as blazes when 'is mind is set,   Ole-fashioned in 'is looks an' in 'is ways,   Believin' it is honesty that pays; An' still dead set, in spite uv bumps 'e's got, To keep on honest if it pays or not.  Poor ole Dad Flood, 'e is too old to fight By close on thirty year; but, if I'm right   About 'is doin's an' about 'is grit,  'E's done a fair bit over 'is fair bit. They are too old to fight, but, all the same, 'Is kind's quite young enough to play the game.  I've 'eard it called, this war--an' it's the truth-- I've 'eard it called the sacrifice uv youth.   An' all this land 'as reckernized it too,   An' gives the boys the praises that is doo. I've 'eard the cheers for ev'ry fightin' lad; But, up to now, I ain't 'eard none for Dad.  Ole Flood, an' all 'is kind throughout the land, They ain't been 'eralded with no brass band,   Or been much thought about; but, take my tip,   The war 'as found 'em with a stiffened lip, 'Umpin' a load they thought they'd dropped for good, Crackin' reel 'ardy, an'--jist sawin' wood.  Dad Flood, 'is back is bent, 'is strength is gone; 'E'd done 'is bit before this war come on.   At sixty-five 'e thought 'is work was done;  'E gave the farmin' over to 'is son, An' jist sat back in peace, with 'is ole wife, To spend content the ev'nin' uv 'is life.  Then come the war. An' when Syd 'esitates Between the ole folk an' 'is fightin' mates,   The ole man goes outside an' grabs a hoe.   Sez 'e, \"Yeh want to, an' yeh ought to go. Wot's stoppin' yeh?\" 'E straightens 'is ole frame. \"Ain't I farmed long enough to know the game?\"  There weren't no more to say. An' Syd went--West: Into the sunset with ole Aussie's best.   But no one ever 'eard no groans from Dad.   Though all 'is pride an' 'ope was in that lad 'E showed no sign excep' to grow more grim. 'Is son was gone--an' it was up to 'im.  One day last month when I was down at Flood's I seen 'im strugglin' with a bag uv spuds.  \"Look 'ere,\" I sez, \"you let me spell yeh, Dad.   You 'umpin' loads like that's a bit too bad.\" 'E gives a grunt that's more than 'arf a groan. \"Wot's up?\" 'e snaps. \"Got no work uv yer own?\"  That's 'im.  But I've been tippin' that the pace Would tell; an' when 'is wife comes to our place,   An' sez that Dad is ill an' took to bed,   Flat out with work--though that ain't wot she said-- I ain't su'prised; an' tells 'er when I'm thro' I'll come across an' see wot I can do.  I went across, an'--I come back again. Strike me! it's no use reas'nin' with some men.   Stubborn ole cows! I'm sick uv them ole fools.   The way 'e yells, \"Keep yer 'ands off my tools!\" Yeh'd think I was a thief. 'Is missus said I'd better slope, or 'e'd be out uv bed.  'E 'eard us talkin' through the open door. \"'Oo's that?\" 'e croaks, altho' 'e tries to roar.   An' when 'is wife ixplains it's only me   To 'elp a bit: \"I want no charity!\" 'E barks. \"I'll do me work meself, yeh 'ear?\" An' then 'e gits so snarky that I clear.  But 'e'll do me. I like the ole boy's nerve. We don't do nothin' that 'e don't deserve;   But me an' Peter Begg an' ole man Poole,   We fairly 'as our work cut out to fool The sly ole fox, when we sneaks down each day An' works a while to keep things under way.  We digs a bit, an' ploughs a bit, an' chops The wood, an' does the needful to 'is crops.   We does it soft, an' when 'e 'ears a row  'Is missus tells 'im it's the dog or cow. 'E sez that it's queer noises for a pup. An'--there'll be ructions when ole Flood gits up.  It ain't all overwork that's laid 'im out. Ole Pride in 'im is fightin' 'ard with Doubt.   To-day 'is wife sez, \"Somethin's strange in 'im,   For in 'is sleep sometimes 'e calls for Jim. It's six long years,\" she sez, an' stops to shake 'Er 'ead. \"But 'e don't mention 'im awake.\"  Dad Flood. I thought 'im jist a stiff-necked fool Before the war; but, as I sez to Poole,   This war 'as tested more than fightin' men.   But, say, 'e is an 'oly terror when Friends try to 'elp 'im earn a bite an' sup. Oh, there'll be 'Ell to pay when 'e gits up!     IV. DIGGER SMITH   Digger Smith  'E CALLS me Digger; that's 'ow 'e begins. 'E sez 'e's only 'arf a man; an' grins.   Judged be 'is nerve, I'd say 'e was worth two                                Uv me an' you. Then 'e digs 'arf a fag out uv 'is vest, Borrers me matches, an' I gives 'im best.  The first I 'eard about it Poole told me. \"There is a bloke called Smith at Flood's,\" sez 'e;   Come there this mornin', sez 'e's come to stay,                              An' won't go 'way. Sez 'e was sent there be a pal named Flood; An' talks uv contracts sealed with Flanders mud.  \"No matter wot they say, 'e only grins,\" Sez Poole. \"'E's rather wobbly on 'is pins.   Seems like a soldier bloke. An' Peter Begg                             'E sez one leg Works be machinery, but I dunno. I only know 'e's there an' 'e won't go.  \"'E grins,\" sez Poole, \"at ev'rything they say.   Dad Flood 'as nearly 'ad a fit to-day.    'E's cursed, an' ordered 'im clean off the place;                                But this cove's face Jist goes on grinnin', an' 'e sez, quite carm, 'E's come to do a bit around the farm.\"  The tale don't sound too good to me at all. \"If 'e's a crook,\" I sez, \"'e wants a fall.   Maybe 'e's dilly. I'll go down an' see.                        'E'll grin at me When I 'ave done, if 'e needs dealin' with.\" So I goes down to interview this Smith.  'E 'ad a fork out in the tater patch. Sez 'e, \"Why 'ello, Digger. Got a match?\"  \"Digger?\" I sez. \"Well, you ain't digger 'ere.                              You better clear. You ought to know that you can't dig them spuds. They don't belong to you; they're ole Dad Flood's.\"  \"Can't I?\" 'e grins. \"I'll do the best I can, Considerin' I'm only 'arf a man.  Give us a light. I can't get none from Flood,                             An' mine is dud.\" I parts; an' 'e stands grinnin' at me still; An' then 'e sez, \"'Ave yeh fergot me, Bill?\"  I looks, an' seen a tough bloke, short an' thin. Then, Lord! I recomembers that ole grin.  \"It's little Smith!\" I 'owls, \"uv Collin'wood.                             Lad, this is good! Last time I seen yeh, you an' Ginger Mick Was 'owling rags, out on yer final kick.\"  \"Yer on to it,\" 'e sez. \"Nex' day we sailed. Now 'arf uv me's back 'ome, an' 'arf they nailed.   An' Mick. . . . Ar, well, Fritz took me down a peg.\"           "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15524"],["title","Digger Smith (#2)"],["body","                         'E waves 'is leg. \"It ain't too bad,\" 'e sez, with 'is ole smile; \"But when I starts to dig it cramps me style.  \"But I ain't grouchin'. It was worth the fun. We 'ad some picnic stoushin' Brother 'Un--   The only fight I've 'ad that some John 'Op                         Don't come an' stop. They pulled me leg a treat, but, all the same, There's nothin' over 'ere to beat the game.  \"An' now,\" 'e sez, \"I'm 'ere to do a job I promised, if it was me luck to lob   Back 'ome before me mate,\" 'e sez, an' then,                               'E grins again. \"As clear as mud,\" I sez. \"But I can't work Me brains to 'old yer pace.  Say, wot's the lurk?\"  So then 'e puts me wise. It seems that 'im An' this 'ere Flood--I tips it must be Jim--   Was cobbers up in France, an' things occurred.                                (I got 'is word Things did occur up there). But, anyway, Seems Flood done somethin' good for 'im one day.  Then Smith 'e promised if 'e came back 'ome Before 'is cobber o'er the flamin' foam,  'E'd see the ole folks 'ere, an' 'e agreed,                           If there was need, 'E'd stay an' do a bit around the farm So long as 'e 'ad one sound, dinkum arm.  \"So, 'ere I am,\" 'e sez, an' grins again. \"A promise is a promise 'mong us men.\"   Sez I, \"You come along up to the 'ouse.                     Ole Dad won't rouse When once 'e's got yer strength, an' as for Mar, She'll kiss yeh when she finds out 'oo yeh are.\"  So we goes up, an' finds 'em both fair dazed About this little Smith; they think 'e's crazed.  I tells the tale in words they understand;                         Then it was grand To see Dad grab Smith's 'and an' pump it good, An' Mar, she kissed 'im, like I said she would.  Mar sez 'e must be starved, an' right away The kettle's on, she's busy with a tray.  An', when I left, this Digger Smith 'e looked                            Like 'e was booked For keeps, with tea an' bread an' beef inside. \"Our little Willie's 'ome,\" 'e grins, \"an' dried.\"     V. WEST   West  \"I'VE seen so much uv dirt an' grime   I'm mad to 'ave things clean. I've seen so much uv death,\" 'e said-- \"So many cobbers lyin' dead--   You won't know wot I mean; But, lad, I've 'ad so much uv strife I want things straightened in my life.  \"I've seen so much uv 'ate,\" 'e said--  \"Mad 'ate an' silly rage-- I'm yearnin' for clear thoughts,\" said 'e. \"Kindness an' love seem good to me.   I want a new, white page To start all over, clean an' good, An' live me life as reel men should.\"  We're sittin' talkin' by the fence,   The sun's jist goin' down, Paintin' the sky all gold an' pink. Said 'e, \"When it's like that, I think--\"   An' then 'e stops to frown. Said 'e, \"I think, when it's jist so, Uv . . . . God or somethin': I dunno.  \"I ain't seen much uv God,\" said 'e;  \"Not 'ere nor Over There; But, partly wot I've seen an' read, An' partly wot the padre said,   It gits me when I stare Out West when it's like that is now. There must be somethin' else--some'ow.  \"I've thought a lot,\" said Digger Smith--   \"Out There I thought a lot. I thought uv death, an' all the rest, An' uv me mates, good mates gone West;   An' it ain't much I've got; But things get movin' in me 'ead When I look over there,\" 'e said.  'E's got me beat, 'as little Smith.   I knoo 'im years ago I knoo 'im as a reel tough boy 'Oo roughed it up with 'oly joy;   But now, well, I dunno. An' when I ask Mar Flood she sighs-- An' sez 'e's got the Anzac eyes.  She sez 'e's got them soldier's eyes   That makes 'er own eyes wet. An' we must give 'im wholesome food An' lead 'is thoughts to somethin' good   An' never let 'im fret. But 'e ain't frettin', seems to me; More--puzzled, fur as I can see.  The clouds above the hills was tore   Apart, until, some'ow, It seemed like some big, shinin' gate. Said 'e, \"Why, lad, I tell yeh straight,   I feel like startin' now, An' walkin' on, an' on, an' thro', Dead game an'--Ain't it so to you?  \"I've seen enough uv pain,\" 'e said,  \"An' cursin', killin' 'ordes. I ain't the man to smooge with God To get to 'Eaven on the nod,   Or 'owl 'ymns for rewards. But this believin'?  Why--Oh, 'Struth This never 'it me in me youth.  \"They talk uv love 'twixt men,\" said 'e.   \"That sounds dead crook to you. But lately I 'ave come to see.\" . . . \"'Old on,\" I said; \"it seems to me   There's love uv women too. An you?\" 'E turns away 'is 'ead. \"I'm only 'arf a man,\" 'e said.  \"I've seen so much uv death,\" said 'e,   \"Me mind is in a whirl. I've 'ad so many thoughts uv late.\" . . . Said I, \"Now, tell me, tell me straight;   Own up; ain't there a girl?\" Said 'e, \"I've done the best I can. Wot does she want with 'arf a man?\"  It weren't no use. 'E wouldn't talk   Uv nothin' but that sky. Said 'e, \"Now, dinkum, talkin' square, When you git gazin' over there   Don't you 'arf want to cry? I wouldn't be su'prised to see An angel comin' out,\" said 'e.  \"Gone West!\" said Digger Smith. \"Ah, lad,   I've seen 'em goin' West, An' often wonder, when I look, If they 'ave 'ad it dealt 'em crook,   Or if they've got the rest They earned twice over by the spell They spent down in that dinkum 'Ell.\"  The gold was creepin' up, the sun   Was 'arf be'ind the range. It don't seem strange a man should cry To see that glory in the sky   To me it don't seem strange. \"Digger!\" said 'e. \"Look at it now! There must be somethin' else--some'ow.\"     VI. OVER THE FENCE   Over the Fence  'TAINT my idea uv argument to call a man a fool, An' I ain't lookin' round for bricks to 'eave at ole man Poole;   But when 'e gets disputin' 'e's inclined to lose 'is 'ead.   It ain't so much 'is choice uv words as 'ow the words is said.  'E's sich a coot for takin' sides, as I sez to Doreen. Sez she, \"'Ow can 'e, by 'imself ?\"  Wotever that may mean.   My wife sez little things sometimes that nearly git me riled.   I knoo she meant more than she said be that soft way she smiled.  To-day, when I was 'arrowin', Poole comes down to the fence To get the loan uv my long spade; an' uses that pretence   To 'ave a bit uv friendly talk, an' one word leads to more,   As is the way with ole man Poole, as I've remarked before.  The spade reminds 'im 'ow 'e done some diggin' in 'is day, An' diggin' brings the talk to earth, an' earth leads on to clay,   Then clay quite natural reminds a thinkin' bloke uv bricks,   An' mortar brings up mud, an' then, uv course, it's politics.  Now, Poole sticks be 'is Party, an' I don't deny 'is right; But when 'e starts abusin' mine 'e's lookin' for a fight.   So I delivers good 'ome truths about 'is crowd; then Poole   Wags 'is ole beard across the fence an' tells me I'm a fool.  Now, that's the dizzy limit; so I lays aside the reins, An' starts to prove 'e's storin' mud where most blokes keeps        their brains.  'E decorates 'is answers, an' we're goin' it ding-dong,   When this returned bloke, Digger Smith, comes sauntering along.  Poole's gripped the fence as though 'e means to tear the rails      in two, An' eyes my waggin' finger like 'e wants to 'ave a chew.   Then Digger Smith 'e grins at Poole, an' then 'e looks at me,   An' sez, quite soft an' friendly-like, \"Winnin' the war?\" sez 'e.  Now, Poole deserves it, an' I'm pleased the lad give 'im that jolt. 'E goes fair mad in argument when once 'e gets a holt.  \"Yeh make me sad,\" sez Digger Smith; \"the both uv you,\" sez 'e.  \"The both uv us!  Gawstruth!\" sez I.  \"You ain't includin' me?\"  \"Well, it takes two to make a row,\" sez little Digger Smith. \"A bloke can't argue 'less 'e 'as a bloke to argue with.   I've come 'ome from a dinkum scrap to find this land uv light   Is chasin' its own tail around an' callin' it a fight.  \"We've seen a thing or two, us blokes 'oo've fought on many fronts; An' we've 'ad time to think a bit between the fightin' stunts.   We've seen big things, an' thought big things, an' all the        silly fuss,   That used to get us rattled once, seems very small to us.  \"An' when a bloke's fought for a land an' gets laid on the shelf It pains 'im to come 'ome an' find it scrappin' with itself;   An' scrappin' all for nothin', or for things that look so       small--   To us, 'oo've been in bigger things, they don't seem reel at all.  \"P'r'aps we 'ave 'ad some skite knocked out, an' p'r'aps we see      more clear, But seems to us there's plenty cleanin'-up to do round 'ere.   We've learnt a little thing or two, an' we 'ave unlearnt 'eaps,   An' silly partisans, with us, is counted out for keeps.  \"This takin' sides jist for the sake uv takin' sides--Aw, 'Struth! I used to do them things one time, back in me foolish youth.   Out There, when I remembered things, I've kicked meself reel good.   In football days I barracked once red 'ot for Collin'wood.  \"I didn't want to see a game, nor see no justice done. It never mattered wot occurred as long as my side won.   The other side was narks an' cows an' rotters to a man;   But mine was all reel bonzer chaps.  I was a partisan.  \"It might sound like swelled-'ead,\" sez Smith.  \"But show me, if yeh can....\" \"'Old 'ard,\" sez Poole. \"Jist tell me this: wot is a partisan?\"   Then Digger Smith starts to ixplain; Poole interrupts straight out;   An' I wades in to give my views, an' 'as to nearly shout.  We battles on for one good hour. My team sleeps where it stands; An' Poole 'as tossed the spade away to talk with both 'is 'ands;   An' Smith 'as dropped the maul 'e 'ad. Then I looks round to see   Doreen quite close. She smiles at us. \"Winnin' the war?\" sez she.     VII. A DIGGER'S TALE   A Digger's Tale  MY oath!' the Duchess sez. 'You'd not ixpect   Sich things as that. Yeh don't mean kangaroos? Go hon!' she sez, or words to that effect--   (It's 'ard to imitate the speech they use) I tells 'er, 'Straight; I drives 'em four-in-'and                                   'Ome in my land.'  \"You 'ear a lot,\" sez little Digger Smith,   \"About 'ow English swells is so stand-off. Don't yeh believe it; it's a silly myth.   I've been reel cobbers with "]]]
