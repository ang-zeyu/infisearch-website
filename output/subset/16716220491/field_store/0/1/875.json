And you are not in haste to leave me?\"  \"Oh, no, no! why should I be? Please keep me a little while yet.\"  \"I intend to: it will take at least a year to get used to the thought of doing without you, and so long Travilla must be content to wait. Nor can we give you up wholly even then; your suite of rooms shall still be yours, and you must come now and then and occupy them for days or weeks at a time.  \"Now, daughter, good-night. Come to me to-morrow morning in my study, soon after breakfast, I have something more of importance to say to you.\"  \"I shall obey, and without fear,\" she answered gayly, \"though I remember once being quite frightened at a similar order; but that was when I was a silly little girl and didn't know how dearly my own papa loved me.\"  \"And when he was strangely stern to his own little child,\" he answered, with another tender caress.     CHAPTER THIRD.      \"So fair that had you beauty's picture took,      It must like her, or not like beauty look.\"                           --ALLEYN'S HENRY VII.   Elsie paused at the half-open door of her father's private room.  Mr. Dinsmore, like most men, was fond of light and air; through the wide open windows the morning breeze stole softly in, laden with sweets from garden and lawn, and the rich carpet of oak and green was flecked with gold where the sunbeams came shimmering down between the fluttering leaves of a beautiful vine that had festooned itself about the one looking to the east.  Mr. Dinsmore was seated at his desk with a pile of papers before him--legal documents in appearance; he would open one, glance over its contents, lay it aside, and take up another only to treat it in like manner.  Elsie stood but a moment watching him with loving, admiring eyes, then gliding noiselessly across the floor, dropped gracefully at his feet and laying her folded hands upon his knee looked up into his face with an arch, sweet smile.  \"Mon p√®re, I have come for my lecture, or whatever you have laid up in store for me,\" she announced with mock gravity and a slight tremble of pretended fear in her voice.  Dropping the paper he held, and passing one hand caressingly over her shining hair, \"My darling, how very, very lovely you are!\" he said, the words bursting spontaneously from his lips; \"there is no flaw in your beauty, and your face beams with happiness.\"  \"Papa turned flatterer!\" she cried, springing up and allowing him to draw her to his knee.  \"I'm waiting for the lecture,\" she said presently, \"you know I always like to have disagreeable things over as soon as possible.\"  \"Who told you there was to be a lecture?\"  \"Nobody, sir.\"  \"What have you been doing that you feel entitles you to one?\"  \"I don't remember.\"  \"Nor I either. So let us to business. Here, take this chair beside me. Do you know how much you are worth?\"  \"Not precisely, sir,\" she answered demurely, taking the chair and folding her hands pensively in her lap; \"but very little, I presume, since you have given me away for nothing.\"  \"By no means,\" he said, with a slight smile of amusement at her unwonted mood. \"It was for your own happiness, which is no trifle in my esteem. But you belong to me still.\"  She looked at him with glistening eyes. \"Thank you, dearest papa; yes, I do belong to you and always shall. Please excuse my wilful misunderstanding of your query. I do not know how much money and other property I own, but have an idea it is a million more or less.\"  \"My dear child!--it is fully three times that.\"  \"Papa! is it indeed?\"  \"Yes, it was about a million at the time of your Grandfather Grayson's death, and has increased very much during your mamma's minority and yours; which you know has been a very long one. You own several stores and a dwelling house in New Orleans, a fine plantation with between two and three hundred negroes, and I have invested largely for you in stocks of various kinds both in your own country and in England. I wish you to examine all the papers, certificates of stock, bonds, deeds, mortgages, and so forth.\"  \"Oh, papa!\" she cried, lifting her hands in dismay, \"what a task. Please excuse me. You know all about it, and is not that sufficient?\"  \"No, the property is yours; I have been only your steward, and must now render up an account to you for the way in which I have handled your property.\"  \"You render an account to _me_, my own dear father,\" she said low and tremulously, while her face flushed crimson; \"I cannot bear to hear you speak so. I am fully satisfied, and very, _very_ thankful for all your kind care of it and of me.\"  He regarded her with a smile of mingled tenderness and amusement, while softly patting and stroking the small white hand laid lovingly upon his.  \"Could I--could any father--do less for his own beloved child?\" he asked.  \"Not you, I know, papa. But may I ask you a question?\"  \"As many as you like.\"  \"How much are you worth? Ah! you needn't look so quizzical. I mean how much do you own in money, land, etc.?\"  \"Something less than a million; I cannot tell you the exact number of dollars and cents.\"  \"Hardly a third as much as I! It doesn't seem right. Papa, take half of mine.\"  \"That wouldn't balance the scales either,\" he said laughingly; \"and besides, Mr. Travilla has now some right to be consulted.\"  \"Papa, I could never love him again, if he should object to my giving you all but a few hundred thousands.\"  \"He would not. He says he will never touch a cent of your property; it must be settled entirely upon yourself, and subject to your control. And that is quite right; for he, too, is wealthy.\"  \"Papa, I don't think I deserve so much; I don't want the care of so much. I do wish you would be so good as to take half for your own, and continue to manage the other half for me as you think best.\"  \"What you deserve is not the question just now. This is one of the talents which God has given you, and I think you ought, at least for the present, to keep the principal and decide for yourself what shall be done with the interest. You are old enough now to do so, and I hope do not wish to shirk the responsibility, since God, in His good providence, has laid it upon you.\"  He spoke very gravely and Elsie's face reflected the expression of his.  \"No, I do not wish it now, papa,\" she said, in a low, sweet voice. \"I will undertake it, asking Him for wisdom and grace to do it aright.\"  They were busy for the next hour or two over the papers.  \"There!\" cried Elsie, at length, \"we have examined the last one, and I think I understand it all pretty thoroughly.\"  \"I think you do. And now another thing; ought you not to go and see for yourself your property in Louisiana?\"  Elsie assented, on condition that he would take her.  \"Certainly, my dear child, can you suppose I would ever think of permitting you to go alone?\"  \"Thank you, papa. And if poor mammy objects this time, she may take her choice of going or staying; but go I must, and see how my poor people are faring at Viamede. I have dim, dreamy recollections of it as a kind of earthly paradise. Papa, do you know why mammy has always been so distressed whenever I talked of going there?\"  \"Painful associations, no doubt. Poor creature! it was there her husband--an unruly negro belonging to a neighboring planter--was sold away from her, and there she lost her children, one by accidental drowning, the others by some epidemic disease. Your own mother, too, died there, and Chloe I think never loved one of her own children better.\"  \"No, I'm sure not. But she never told me of her husband and children, and I thought she had never had any. And now, papa, that we are done with business for the present, I have a request to make.\"  \"Well, daughter, what is it?\"  \"That you will permit me to renew my old intimacy with Lucy Carrington; or at least to call on her. You remember she was not well enough to be at the wedding; she is here at Ashlands with her baby. Mr. and Mrs. Carrington called here yesterday while you were out, and both urged me not to be ceremonious with Lucy, as she is hardly well enough to make calls and is longing to see me.\"  \"And what answer did you give them?\" he asked with some curiosity.  \"That I should do so if possible; that meant if I could obtain your permission, papa.\"  \"You have it. Lucy is in some sort taken into the family now, and you are safely engaged; to say nothing of your mature years,\" he added laughingly, as she seated herself on his knee again and thanked him with a hug and kiss.  \"You dear good papa!\"  \"Some girls of your age, heiresses in their own right, would merely have said, 'I'm going,' never asking permission.\"  \"Ah, but I like to be ruled by you. So please don't give it up. Now about Enna?\"  \"If I had any authority in the matter, I should say, you shall not give her a cent. She doesn't deserve it from you or any one.\"  \"Then I shall wait till you change your mind.\"  Mr. Dinsmore shook his head. \"Ah! my little girl, you don't realize how much some one else's opinions will soon weigh with you,\" he answered, putting an arm about her and looking with fatherly delight into the sweet face.  \"Ah, papa!\" she cried, laying her cheek to his, \"please don't talk so; it hurts me.\"  \"Then, dearest, I shall not say it again, though indeed I was not reproaching you; it is right, very right, that husband and wife should be more than all the world beside to each other.\"  Elsie's cheek crimsoned. \"It has not come to that yet, father dear,\" she murmured, half averting her blushing face; \"and--I don't know which of you I love best--or how I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],["title","Elsie's children (#1)"],["body"," parents had prepared a pleasant surprise for them, causing a small tract of barren land on the Ion estate to be turned into an artificial lake. It was this, shining in the golden beams of the morning sun, and a beautiful boat moored to the hither shore, that had called forth from the lips of the little girls those exclamations of almost incredulous wonder and delight.  \"Yes; I'll ring for Dinah,\" cried Vi, skipping across the room and putting out her hand to lay hold of the bell pull.  \"Wait, Vi, our prayers first, you know,\" said Elsie.  \"Oh, yes! I do want to thank God for being so good to us; the pretty lake and boat and all.\"  \"Dear kind parents, safe journey home, too, and oh more things than we can count,\" added Elsie, as they knelt down side by side.  This duty performed with no irreverent haste, the maid was summoned and a careful toilet made in season to afford them time for a walk before mamma would be ready to see them.  They found their father in the lower veranda talking with the overseer, while Solon stood waiting with Beppo's bridle in his hand, the horse pawing the ground with impatience.  Eddie was there, too, caressing Bruno who seemed as glad to be at home again as any of the rest. Uttering a joyous bark he left his young master and bounded to meet the little girls.  Mr. Travilla turned at the sound and with a kind fatherly smile, held out his hands.  \"O papa,\" they cried running to him, \"how good of you to have it made for us!\"  \"Good-morning, my darlings,\" he said, giving and receiving caresses, \"but what are you talking about?\"  \"Why the lake, papa; the lake and the boat.\"  \"Lake?\" exclaimed Eddie, \"why where?\"  \"Oh, you couldn't see it from your windows,\" said Elsie. \"Papa, papa, may we go now and look at it?\"  \"Yes,\" he said, taking a hand of each. \"Larkin, I'll see you again after breakfast. Come, Eddie, my son, you too, and Bruno.\"  A brisk five minutes' walk brought them to the shore of the lake, a tiny one, scarce a quarter of a mile in circumference, not very deep and the water so clear that the pebbly bottom could be distinctly seen; gold and silver fish, too, gliding hither and thither; while a pretty, gayly painted row-boat lying at the water's edge, rocked gently in the morning breeze.  Eddie hailed the scene with a shout of delight; the little girls danced about gleefully, Vi clapping her hands and asking eagerly if they might get into the boat.  Papa looked at his watch, \"Yes, there will be time for a row; one trip around the lake. Step in, all of you, and I will take the oars.\"  Vi was quite ready and Eddie gallantly handed her in, then turned and offered his hand to Elsie. She demurred. \"But mamma! shouldn't we have mamma with us the first time?\" and she looked up inquiringly into her father's face.  \"Yes, yes, of course!\" cried the others making haste to step ashore again, \"we want dear mamma with us the very first time.\"  Papa smiled approval. \"Then we will go back,\" he said, \"and after breakfast, if mamma is willing, we will all come and take a row together; the boat is large enough to carry us all at once.\"  Mamma's consent was readily obtained, for to please her children was her great delight. So shortly after breakfast they all repaired to the lake and rowed round and across it several times, a merry, happy party.  At Roselands the family were gathered about the breakfast table and the principal topic of conversation was the return of the party from Viamede. Calhoun had been to the Oaks the previous evening and learned of their safe arrival.  \"We must all go this morning and call upon them,\" said Mr. Dinsmore.  \"We'll divide our forces,\" said Cal, laughing. \"Suppose grandpa, mother and Aunt Enna, go first to the Oaks; and we younger ones to Ion?\"  \"Very well,\" replied the old gentleman, \"I shall spend an hour with my son, then ride over to see Elsie and her little flock. How many of you young folks want to go to Ion in the first division?\"  \"I!\" \"And I!\" \"And I!\" cried one and another.  \"But you can't go all at once,\" returned their grandfather, looking around upon them with an amused smile; \"the carriage is roomy, but really you are too many for it. Besides wouldn't there be some danger of overwhelming your cousins?\"  \"Well, I'm going, let who will stay at home,\" observed Molly Percival with cool decision. \"The boys can ride, I mean Cal, and Art, and Dick and Wal; they all have ponies and the two carriages will hold the rest of us if we crowd a little.\"  \"I'm not going to be bothered with Bob or Betty,\" said her mother; \"they may go with you, or wait till another time.\"  \"Then they'll wait,\" remarked Isadore Conly, \"for I shall wear my best silk suit, and I have no notion of having it tumbled.\"  \"Last year's suit is quite good enough for the occasion,\" said her mother, \"they're only cousins.\"  \"But rich ones, that can afford to dress, and I'll not go a step if I have to look shabby.\"  \"Nor I,\" chimed in her sister. \"So mamma you may as well resign yourself to the situation. It's no good finding fault or objecting,\" she added with a laugh.  \"Take your own way, then,\" returned her mother indifferently, \"but remember there'll be no more new dresses this season.\"  \"Dear me, why aren't we as rich as the Travillas?\" pouted Isadore. \"I do think things are very unequally divided in this world.\"  \"Never mind; the wheel of fortune often takes a turn,\" said her mother. \"You may have money left you some day (some of your father's relations are still rich), and you may make a grand match.\"  \"How long will it take you girls to don your finery?\" ask Cal, pulling out his watch. \"We'd better start as soon as we can: the sun will be getting hot.\"  \"I'm done,\" said Molly, jumping up, \"and I'll be ready by the time the carriage can be brought to the door. Come Isa and Virgy, you've eaten enough. Cousin Elsie will be sure to treat us to something good.\" And she ran gayly from the room.  Molly, just turned thirteen, and already as tall as her mother, was a bright, lively girl, full of fun and frolic. She was not a beauty, but had a clear complexion and fine dark eyes, and good humor and intelligence lent a charm to her face that made it more than ordinarily attractive.  Dick had always been fond of her, and was beginning to take a brotherly pride in her good looks and intellectual gifts.  Enna's feelings toward her were divided between motherly pride and affection on the one hand, and on the other the dread of being made to appear old by the side of so tall a daughter; a dread that made her jealous of Dick also.  The Conly girls, too, were growing fast, giving promise of fair, graceful womanhood, Isadore particularly of great beauty; which her mother fondly hoped would be the means of securing her a wealthy husband; for Mrs. Conly's affections were wholly set upon the things of this life; by her and her sister Enna, wealth and beauty were esteemed the highest good, and their children were trained in accordance with that view; the moral atmosphere of the house being very different from that of Ion, where the lives and conversation of the parents were such as to leave no doubt in the minds of their children, that to them the things of time and sense were as nothing in comparison with those of eternity.  Enna followed her daughter into the dressing-room they used in common.  \"Wear the very best you have, Molly,\" she said, \"I don't want you to be looked down upon as a poor relation, or to have it said that the Conlys dress better than my children.\"  \"I'm sure they don't,\" said Molly, ringing for the maid, \"though they'd like to if they could, and are always jealous when grandpa makes me a present.\"  \"Of course they are, and they manage to get more than their fair share, too,\" acquiesced the mother in a tone of irritation; \"but do you see to it that they don't get ahead of you at Ion; remember Elsie is as rich as a Jew, and likes the credit of being generous, so keep on the right side of her, if you want handsome presents.\"  \"I'm sure she is generous and doesn't give only for the credit of it,\" said Molly.  \"Don't give me any impudence,\" returned her mother sharply. \"Rachel,\" to the maid who just then came in in answer to the bell, \"dress Miss Molly first, and be quick about it.\"  Enna superintended the business in person, and in a way that sorely tried the temper and nerves of both Molly and the maid; the child's sash must be tied and retied, her hat bent this way and that, her collar and brooch changed again and again, till she was ready to cry with impatience; and when at last she started for the door, she was called back, and Rachel ordered to change her slippers for gaiter boots.  \"I don't want to wear them!\" cried Molly, fairly stamping with impatience. \"The heels are so high and narrow, I can't bear them.\"  \"They're just the style and make your foot look beautiful,\" said her mother, \"sit down and let Rachel put them on you.\"  \"Grandpa says they're dangerous, and so does Dr. Barton, too,\" grumbled Molly.  \"Put them on her, Rachel,\" commanded Enna. \"Molly, behave yourself, or you'll stay at home.\"  The child submitted rather sullenly, muttering that she would be late.  Rachel was fastening the second boot, when Isadore and Virginia were heard running down the stairs, calling out that the carriage was at the door.  \"There! I knew you'd make me too late!\" cried Molly. \"Oh, Rachel, do hurry!\"  \"Yes, Miss Molly, best I kin; dar dat's de las' button.\"  Up sprang Molly, and away in hot haste. She gained the landing, caught her heel in the carpet on the first step of the next flight, and a wild shriek rang through the house, accompanied by the sound of a heavy body tumbling and rolling down the stairs.  Echoing the scream, Enna rushed out into the upper hall.  Calhoun at the foot of the stairs, was picking Molly up.  \"Is she hurt? Is she killed?\" asked the mother, \"Molly, Molly, how did you come to be so awkward?\"  \"I wasn't! it was those heels; I knew they'd throw me down some day!\" cried"]]]
