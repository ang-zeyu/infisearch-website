They cultivated shrubs and plants.   He selected his texts with great care.   His lips grow restless, and his smile is curled half into scorn.   Wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness.   O breeze, that waftst me on my way!   Thou boast'st of what should be thy shame.   Life's fitful fever over, he rests well.   Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?   From star to star the living lightnings flash.   And glittering crowns of prostrate seraphim.   That morning, thou that slumber'd'st not before.   Habitual evils change not on a sudden.   Thou waft'd'st the rickety skiffs over the cliffs.   Thou reef'd'st the haggled, shipwrecked sails.   The honest shepherd's catarrh.   The heiress in her dishabille is humorous.   The brave chevalier behaves like a conservative.   The luscious notion of champagne and precious sugar.  III. INFLECTIONS.  Inflections are slides of the voice upward or downward. Of these, there are two: the rising inflection and the falling inflection.  The Rising Inflection is that in which the voice slides upward, and is marked thus ('); as,     Did you walk'? Did you walk.  The Falling Inflection is that in which the voice slides downward, and is marked thus ('); as,    I did not walk'. I did not walk.  Both inflections are exhibited in the following question:    Did you walk' or ride'? walk or ride.  In the following examples, the first member has the rising and the second member the falling inflection:  EXAMPLES.[1]    Is he sick', or is he well'?   Did you say valor', or value'?   Did you say statute', or statue'?   Did he act properly', or improperly'?  [Footnote 1: These questions and similar ones, with their answers, should be repeatedly pronounced with their proper  inflection, until the distinction between the rising and falling inflection is well understood and easily made by the learner. He will be assisted in this by emphasizing strongly the word which receives the inflection, thus. Did you RIDE' or did you WALK'?]  In the following examples, the inflections are used in a contrary order, the first member terminating with the falling and the second with the rising inflection:  EXAMPLES.    He is well', not sick'.   I said value', not valor'.   I said statue', not statute'.   He acted properly', not improperly'.   FALLING INFLECTIONS.  Rule VI.--The falling inflection is generally proper wherever the sense is complete.  EXAMPLES.    Truth is more wonderful than fiction'.   Men generally die as they live'.   By industry we obtain wealth'.   REMARK.--Parts of a sentence often make complete sense in themselves, and in this case, unless qualified or restrained by the succeeding clause, or unless the contrary is indicated by some other principle, the falling inflection takes place according to the rule.   EXAMPLES    Truth is wonderful', even more so than fiction'.    Men generally die as they live' and by their actions we must judge of   their character'.   Exception.--When a sentence concludes with a negative clause, or with a contrast or comparison (called also antithesis), the first member of which requires the falling inflection, it must close with the rising inflection. (See Rule XI, and paragraph 2, Note.)  EXAMPLES.  No one desires to be thought a fool'.  I come to bury' Caesar, not to praise' him.  He lives in England' not in France'.   REMARK.--In bearing testimony to the general character of a man we say:    He is too honorable' to be guilty of a vile' act.  But if he is accused of some act of baseness, a contrast is at once instituted between his character and the specified act, and we change the inflections, and say:    He is too honorable' to be guilty of such' an act.  A man may say in general terms:    I am too busy' for projects'.  But if he is urged to embark in some particular enterprise, he will change the inflections, and say:    I am too busy' for projects'.  In such cases, as the falling inflection is required in the former part by the principle of contrast and emphasis (as will hereafter be more fully explained), the sentence necessarily closes with the rising inflection. Sometimes, also, emphasis alone seems to require the rising inflection on the concluding word. See exception to Rule VII.  (5.-2.)   STRONG EMPHASIS.  RULE VII.--Language which demands strong emphasis generally requires the falling inflection.  EXAMPLES. 1. Command or urgent entreaty; as,    Begone',   Run' to your houses, fall' upon your knees,   Pray' to the Gods to intermit the plagues.    0, save' me, Hubert' save' me I My eyes are out   Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.   2. Exclamation, especially when indicating strong emotion; as,    0, ye Gods'! ye Gods'! must I endure all this?    Hark'! Hark'! the horrid sound   Hath raised up his head.   For interrogatory exclamation, see Rule X, Remark.    SERIES OF WORDS OR MEMBERS.  3. A series of words or members, whether in the beginning or middle of a sentence, if it does not conclude the sentence, is called a commencing series, and usually requires the rising inflection when not emphatic.  EXAMPLES OF COMMENCING SERIES.    Wine', beauty', music', pomp', are poor expedients to heave off the load   of an hour from the heir of eternity'.    I conjure you by that which you profess,   (Howe'er you came to know it,) answer me;   Though you untie the winds and let them fight   Against the churches'; though the yeasty waves   Confound and swallow navigation' up;   Though bladed corn be lodged, and trees blown down';   Though castles topple on their warders' heads';   Though palaces and pyramids do slope   Their heads to their foundations'; though the treasures   Of nature's germens tumble altogether',   Even till destruction sicken'; answer me   To what I ask' you.   4. A series of words or members which concludes a sentence is called a concluding series, and each member usually has the falling inflection.  EXAMPLE OF CONCLUDING SERIES.  They, through faith, subdued kingdoms', wrought righteousness' obtained promises', stopped the mouths of lions', quenched the violence of fire', escaped the edge of the sword', out of weakness were made strong', waxed valiant in fight', turned to flight the armies of the aliens'.   REMARK.--When the emphasis on these words or members is not marked, they take the rising inflection, according to Rule IX.  EXAMPLES.    They are the offspring of restlessness', vanity', and idleness'.   Love', hope', and joy' took possession of his breast.  5. When words which naturally take the rising inflection become emphatic by repetition or any other cause, they often take the falling inflection.  Exception to the Rule.--While the tendency of emphasis is decidedly to the use of the falling inflection, sometimes a word to which the falling inflection naturally belongs changes this, when it is emphatic, for the rising inflection.  EXAMPLES.    Three thousand ducats': 't is a good round sum'.   It is useless to point out the beauties of nature to one who is blind'.  Here sum and blind, according to Rule VI, would take the falling inflection, but as they are emphatic, and the object of emphasis is to draw attention to the word emphasized, this is here accomplished in part by giving an unusual inflection. Some speakers would give these words the circumflex, but it would he the rising circumflex, so that the sound would still terminate with the rising inflection.  RULE VIII.--Questions which can not be answered by yes or no, together with their answers, generally require the falling inflection.  EXAMPLES.  Where has he gone'?    Ans. To New York'. What has he done'?     Ans. Nothing'. Who did this'?         Ans. I know not'. When did he go'?       Ans. Yesterday'.   REMARK.--It these questions are repeated, the inflection is changed according to the principle stated under the Exception to Rule VII.   RISING INFLECTION.  RULE IX.--Where a pause is rendered proper by the meaning, and the sense is incomplete, the rising inflection is generally required.  EXAMPLES.  To endure slander and abuse with meekness' requires no ordinary degree of self-command',  Night coming on', both armies retired from the field of battle'.  As a dog returneth to his vomit', so a fool returneth to his folly'.  REMARK.--The person or object addressed, in ordinary conversation, comes under this head.  EXAMPLES.  Fathers'! we once again are met in council.  My lords'! and gentlemen'! we have arrived at an awful crisis.  Age'! thou art shamed.  Rome'! thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!   Exception.--Where a word which, according to this rule, requires the rising inflection, becomes emphatic, it generally has the falling inflec-tion; as, when a child addresses his father, he first says, Father'! but if he repeats it emphatically, he changes the inflection, and says, Father'! Father'! The falling inflection is also used in formal address; as, Fellow--citizens', Mr. President', etc.  EXAMPLES.  When we aim at a high standard, if we do not attain' it, we shall secure a high degree of excellence.  Those who mingle with the vicious, if they do not become depraved', will lose all delicacy of feeling.  RULE X.--Questions which may be answered by yes or no, generally require the rising, and their answers the falling inflection.  EXAMPLES.  Has he arrived'? Yes'. Will he return'? No'. Does the law condemn him'? It does not'.  Exception.--If these questions are repeated emphatically, they take the falling inflection, according to Rule VII.  EXAMPLES.  Has he arrived'? Will he return'? Does the law condemn him'?  REMARK.--When a word or sentence is repeated as a kind of interrogatory exclamation, the rising inflection is used according to the principles of this rule.  EXAMPLES.  You ask, who would venture' in such a cause! Who would venture'? Rather say, who would not' venture all things for such an object!  He is called the friend' of virtue.

He had also preserved, as materials for this branch of his subject, some scattered hints, documents, and parts of a correspondence on the state of the country. He was, however, prevented from working on them by the want of some authentic and official information, for which he had been long anxiously waiting, in order to ascertain, to the satisfaction of the public, what, with his usual sagacity, he had fully anticipated from his own personal observation, to his own private conviction. At length the reports of the different committees which had been appointed by the two Houses of Parliament amply furnished him with evidence for this purpose. Accordingly he read and considered them with attention: but for anything beyond this the season was now past. The Supreme Disposer of All, against whose inscrutable counsels it is vain as well as impious to murmur, did not permit him to enter on the execution of the task which he meditated. It was resolved, therefore, by one of his friends, after much hesitation, and under a very painful responsibility, to make such an attempt as he could at supplying the void; especially because the insufficiency of our resources for the continuance of the war was understood to have been the principal objection urged against the two former Letters on the Proposals for Peace. In performing with reverential diffidence this duty of friendship, care has been taken not to attribute to Mr. Burke any sentiment which is not most explicitly known, from repeated conversations, and from much correspondence, to have been decidedly entertained by that illustrious man. One passage of nearly three pages, containing a censure of our defensive system, is borrowed from a private letter, which he began to dictate with an intention of comprising in it the short result of his opinions, but which he afterwards abandoned, when, a little time before his death, his health appeared in some degree to amend, and he hoped that Providence might have spared him at least to complete the larger public letter, which he then proposed to resume.  In the preface to the former edition of this Letter a fourth was mentioned as being in possession of Mr. Burke's friends. It was in fact announced by the author himself, in the conclusion of the second, which it was then designed to follow. He intended, he said, to proceed next on the question of the facilities possessed by the French Republic, _from the internal state of other nations, and particularly of this_, for obtaining her ends,--and as his notions were controverted, to take notice of what, in that way, had been recommended to him. The vehicle which he had chosen for this part of his plan was an answer to a pamphlet which was supposed to come from high authority, and was circulated by ministers with great industry, at the time of its appearance, in October, 1795, immediately previous to that session of Parliament when his Majesty for the first time declared that the appearance of any disposition in the enemy to negotiate for general peace should not fail to be met with an earnest desire to give it the fullest and speediest effect. In truth, the answer, which is full of spirit and vivacity, was written the latter end of the same year, but was laid aside when the question assumed a more serious aspect, from the commencement of an actual negotiation, which gave rise to the series of printed letters. Afterwards, he began to rewrite it, with a view of accommodating it to his new purpose. The greater part, however, still remained in its original state; and several heroes of the Revolution, who are there celebrated, having in the interval passed off the public stage, a greater liberty of insertion and alteration than his friends on consideration have thought allowable would be necessary to adapt it to that place in the series for which it was ultimately designed by the author. This piece, therefore, addressed, as the title originally stood, to his noble friend, Earl Fitzwilliam, will be given the first in the supplemental volumes which will be hereafter added to complete this edition of the author's works.  The tracts, most of them in manuscript, which have been already selected as fit for this purpose, will probably furnish four or five volumes more, to be printed uniformly with this edition. The principal piece is an Essay on the History of England, from the earliest period to the conclusion of the reign of King John. It is written with much depth of antiquarian research, directed by the mind of an intelligent statesman. This alone, as far as can be conjectured, will form more than one volume. Another entire volume also, at least, will be filled with his letters to public men on public affairs, especially those of France. This supplement will be sent to the press without delay.  Mr. Burke's more familiar correspondence will be reserved as authorities to accompany a narrative of his life, which will conclude the whole. The period during which he flourished was one of the most memorable of our annals. It comprehended the acquisition of one empire in the East, the loss of another in the West, and the total subversion of the ancient system of Europe by the French Revolution, with all which events the history of his life is necessarily and intimately connected,--as indeed it also is, much more than is generally known, with the state of literature and the elegant arts. Such a subject of biography cannot be dismissed with a slight and rapid touch; nor can it be treated in a manner worthy of it, from the information, however authentic and extensive, which the industry of any one man may have accumulated. Many important communications have been received; but some materials, which relate to the pursuits of his early years, and which are known to be in existence, have been hitherto kept back, notwithstanding repeated inquiries and applications. It is, therefore, once more earnestly requested, that all persons who call themselves the friends or admirers of the late Edmund Burke will have the goodness to transmit, without delay, any notices of that or of any other kind which may happen to be in their possession or within their reach, to Messrs. Rivingtons,--a respect and kindness to his memory which will be thankfully acknowledged by those friends to whom, in dying, he committed the sacred trust of his reputation.

I.-VIII. of the edition in sixteen volumes issued by these publishers at intervals between the years 1801 and 1827.

[5] In the first half of the paragraph commencing, \"If, then, the real state of this nation,\" &c.     ADVERTISEMENT  TO THE SECOND OCTAVO EDITION.[6]   A new edition of the works of Mr. Burke having been called for by the public, the opportunity has been taken to make some slight changes, it is hoped for the better.  A different distribution of the contents, while it has made the volumes, with the exception of the first and sixth, more nearly equal in their respective bulk, has, at the same time, been fortunately found to produce a more methodical arrangement of the whole. The first and second volumes, as before, severally contain those literary and philosophical works by which Mr. Burke was known previous to the commencement of his public life as a statesman, and the political pieces which were written by him between the time of his first becoming connected with the Marquis of Rockingham and his being chosen member for Bristol. In the third are comprehended all his speeches and pamphlets from his first arrival at Bristol, as a candidate, in the year 1774, to his farewell address from the hustings of that city, in the year 1780. What he himself published relative to the affairs of India occupies the fourth volume. The remaining four comprise his works since the French Revolution, with the exception of the Letter to Lord Kenmare on the Penal Laws against Irish Catholics, which was probably inserted where it stands from its relation to the subject of the Letter addressed by him, at a later period, to Sir Hercules Langrishe. With the same exception, too, strict regard has been paid to chronological order, which, in the last edition, was in some instances broken, to insert pieces that wore not discovered till it was too late to introduce them in their proper places.  In the Appendix to the Speech on the Nabob of Arcot's Debts the references were found to be confused, and, in many places, erroneous. This probably had arisen from the circumstance that a larger and differently constructed appendix seems to have been originally designed by Mr. Burke, which, however, he afterwards abridged and altered, while the speech and the notes upon it remained as they were. The text and the documents that support it have throughout been accommodated to each other.  The orthography has been in many cases altered, and an attempt made to reduce it to some certain standard. The rule laid down for the discharge of this task was, that, whenever Mr. Burke could be"]]]
