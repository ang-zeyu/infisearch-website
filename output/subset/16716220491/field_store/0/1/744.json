Without this Master-Key, Mastery is impossible, and the student knocks in vain at the many doors of The Temple.  2.  The Principle of Correspondence      \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\"--The Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the truth that there is always a Correspondence between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of Being and Life. The old Hermetic axiom ran in these words: \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\" And the grasping of this Principle gives one the means of solving many a dark paradox, and hidden secret of Nature. There are planes beyond our knowing, but when we apply the Principle of Correspondence to them we are able to understand much that would otherwise be unknowable to us. This Principle is of universal application and manifestation, on the various planes of the material, mental, and spiritual universe--it is an Universal Law. The ancient Hermetists considered this Principle as one of the most important mental instruments by which man was able to pry aside the obstacles which hid from view the Unknown. Its use even tore aside the Veil of Isis to the extent that a glimpse of the face of the goddess might be caught. Just as a knowledge of the Principles of Geometry enables man to measure distant suns and their movements, while seated in his observatory, so a knowledge of the Principle of Correspondence enables Man to reason intelligently from the Known to the Unknown.  Studying the monad, he understands the archangel.  3.  The Principle of Vibration      \"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.\"--The     Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is in motion\"; \"everything vibrates\"; \"nothing is at rest\"; facts which Modern Science endorses, and which each new scientific discovery tends to verify.  And yet this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of years ago, by the Masters of Ancient Egypt. This Principle explains that the differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. From THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all is in vibration--the higher the vibration, the higher the position in the scale. The vibration of Spirit is at such an infinite rate of intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest--just as a rapidly moving wheel seems to be motionless. And at the other end of the scale, there are gross forms of matter whose vibrations are so low as to seem at rest. Between these poles, there are millions upon millions of varying degrees of vibration. From corpuscle and electron, atom and molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion. This is also true on the planes of energy and force (which are but varying degrees of vibration); and also on the mental planes (whose states depend upon vibrations); and even on to the spiritual planes. An understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas, enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as well as those of others. The Masters also apply this Principle to the conquering of Natural phenomena, in various ways. \"He who understands the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of power,\" says one of the old writers.  4.  The Principle of Polarity      \"Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its     pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are     identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet;     all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be     reconciled.\"--The Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is dual\"; \"everything has two poles\"; \"everything has its pair of opposites,\" all of which were old Hermetic axioms. It explains the old paradoxes, that have perplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: \"Thesis and antithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree\"; \"opposites are the same, differing only in degree\"; \"the pairs of opposites may be reconciled\"; \"extremes meet\"; \"everything is and isn't, at the same time\"; \"all truths are but half-truths\"; \"every truth is half-false\"; \"there are two sides to everything,\" etc., etc., etc. It explains that in everything there are two poles, or opposite aspects, and that \"opposites\" are really only the two extremes of the same thing, with many varying degrees between them. To illustrate:  Heat and Cold, although \"opposites,\" are really the same thing, the differences consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. Look at your thermometer and see if you can discover where \"heat\" terminates and \"cold\" begins! There is no such thing as \"absolute heat\" or \"absolute cold\"--the two terms \"heat\" and \"cold\" simply indicate varying degrees of the same thing, and that \"same thing\" which manifests as \"heat\" and \"cold\" is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. So \"heat\" and \"cold\" are simply the \"two poles\" of that which we call \"Heat\"--and the phenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of Polarity. The same Principle manifests in the case of \"Light and Darkness,\" which are the same thing, the difference consisting of varying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena. Where does \"darkness\" leave off, and \"light\" begin? What is the difference between \"Large and Small\"? Between \"Hard and Soft\"? Between \"Black and White\"? Between \"Sharp and Dull\"? Between \"Noise and Quiet\"? Between \"High and Low\"? Between \"Positive and Negative\"? The Principle of Polarity explains these paradoxes, and no other Principle can supersede it. The same Principle operates on the Mental Plane. Let us take a radical and extreme example--that of \"Love and Hate,\" two mental states apparently totally different.  And yet there are degrees of Hate and degrees of Love, and a middle point in which we use the terms \"Like or Dislike,\" which shade into each other so gradually that sometimes we are at a loss to know whether we \"like\" or \"dislike\" or \"neither.\" And all are simply degrees of the same thing, as you will see if you will but think a moment.  And, more than this (and considered of more importance by the Hermetists), it is possible to change the vibrations of Hate to the vibrations of Love, in one's own mind, and in the minds of others. Many of you, who read these lines, have had personal experiences of the involuntary rapid transition from Love to Hate, and the reverse, in your own case and that of others.  And you will therefore realize the possibility of this being accomplished by the use of the Will, by means of the Hermetic formulas. \"Good and Evil\" are but the poles of the same thing, and the Hermetist understands the art of transmuting Evil into Good, by means of an application of the Principle of Polarity. In short, the \"Art of Polarization\" becomes a phase of \"Mental Alchemy\" known and practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters.  An understanding of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as that of others, if he will devote the time and study necessary to master the art.  5.  The Principle of Rhythm      \"Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides;     all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in     everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the     measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.\"--The     Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the truth that in everything there is manifested a measured motion, to and fro; a flow and inflow; a swing backward and forward; a pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide and low-tide; between the two poles which exist in accordance with the Principle of Polarity described a moment ago. There is always an action and a reaction; an advance and a retreat; a rising and a sinking. This is in the affairs of the Universe, suns, worlds, men, animals, mind, energy, and matter.  This law is manifest in the creation and destruction of worlds; in the rise and fall of nations; in the life of all things; and finally in the mental states of Man (and it is with this latter that the Hermetists find the understanding of the Principle most important). The Hermetists have grasped this Principle, finding its universal application, and have also discovered certain means to overcome its effects in themselves by the use of the appropriate formulas and methods. They apply the Mental Law of Neutralization. They cannot annul the Principle, or cause it to cease its operation, but they have learned how to escape its effects upon themselves to a certain degree depending upon the Mastery of the Principle.  They have learned how to USE it, instead of being USED BY it. In this and similar methods, consist the Art of the Hermetists. The Master of Hermetics polarizes himself at the point at which he desires to rest, and then neutralizes the Rhythmic swing of the pendulum which would tend to carry him to the other pole.  All individuals who have attained any degree of Self-Mastery do this to a certain degree, more or less unconsciously, but the Master does this consciously, and by the use of his Will, and attains a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of belief on the part of the masses who are swung backward and forward like a pendulum. This Principle and that of Polarity have been closely studied by the Hermetists, and the methods of counteracting, neutralizing, and USING them form an important part of the Hermetic Mental Alchemy.  6.  The Principle of Cause and Effect      \"Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause;     everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name     for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation,     but nothing escapes the Law.\"--The Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the fact "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14218"],["title","The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry (#1)"],["body","corruptible elements are united in a certain substance,   their strife must sooner or later bring about its decomposition,   which is, of course, followed by putrefaction; in putrefaction,   the impure is separated from the pure; and if the pure elements   are then once more joined together by the action of natural heat,   a much nobler and higher form of life is produced.... If the   hidden central fire, which during life was in a state of   passivity, obtain the mastery, it attracts to itself all the pure   elements, which are thus separated from the impure, and form the   nucleus of a far purer form of life.\" (Michael Sendivogius.)    \"Cause that which is above to be below; that which is visible to   be invisible; that which is palpable to become impalpable. Again   let that which is below become that which is above; let the   invisible become visible, and the impalpable become palpable. Here   you see the perfection of our Art, without any defect or   diminution.\" (Basil Valentine, 15th century.)    \"Think most diligently about this; often bear in mind, observe and   comprehend, that all minerals and metals together, in the same   time, and after the same fashion, and of one and the same   principal matter, are produced and generated. That matter is no   other than a mere vapour, which is extracted from the elementary   earth by the superior stars, or by a sidereal distillation of the   macrocosm; which sidereal hot infusion, with an airy sulphurous   property, descending upon inferiors, so acts and operates as that   there is implanted, spiritually and invisibly, a certain power and   virtue in those metals and minerals; which fume, moreover,   resolves in the earth into a certain water, wherefrom all metals   are thenceforth generated and ripened to their perfection, and   thence proceeds this or that metal or mineral, according as one of   the three principles acquires dominion, and they have much or   little of sulphur and salt, or an unequal mixture of these; whence   some metals are fixed--that is, constant or stable; and some are   volatile and easily changeable, as is seen in gold, silver,   copper, iron, tin, and lead.\" (Basil Valentine.)    \"To grasp the invisible elements, to attract them by their   material correspondences, to control, purify, and transform them   by the living power of the Spirit--this is true Alchemy.\"   (Paracelsus.)    \"Destruction perfects that which is good; for the good cannot   appear on account of that which conceals it.... Each one of the   visible metals is a concealment of the other six metals.\"   (Paracelsus.)  These sayings read like sentences in a forgotten tongue.  Humboldt tells of a parrot which had lived with a tribe of American Indians, and learnt scraps of their language; the tribe totally disappeared; the parrot alone remained, and babbled words in the language which no living human being could understand.  Are the words I have quoted unintelligible, like the parrot's prating? Perhaps the language may be reconstructed; perhaps it may be found to embody something worth a hearing. Success is most likely to come by considering the growth of alchemy; by trying to find the ideas which were expressed in the strange tongue; by endeavouring to look at our surroundings as the alchemists looked at theirs.  Do what we will, we always, more or less, construct our own universe. The history of science may be described as the history of the attempts, and the failures, of men \"to see things as they are.\" \"Nothing is harder,\" said the Latin poet Lucretius, \"than to separate manifest facts from doubtful, what straightway the mind adds on of itself.\"  Observations of the changes which are constantly happening in the sky, and on the earth, must have prompted men long ago to ask whether there are any limits to the changes of things around them. And this question must have become more urgent as working in metals, making colours and dyes, preparing new kinds of food and drink, producing substances with smells and tastes unlike those of familiar objects, and other pursuits like these, made men acquainted with transformations which seemed to penetrate to the very foundations of things.  Can one thing be changed into any other thing; or, are there classes of things within each of which change is possible, while the passage from one class to another is not possible? Are all the varied substances seen, tasted, handled, smelt, composed of a limited number of essentially different things; or, is each fundamentally different from every other substance? Such questions as these must have pressed for answers long ago.  Some of the Greek philosophers who lived four or five hundred years before Christ formed a theory of the transformations of matter, which is essentially the theory held by naturalists to-day.  These philosophers taught that to understand nature we must get beneath the superficial qualities of things. \"According to convention,\" said Democritus (born 460 B.C.), \"there are a sweet and a bitter, a hot and a cold, and according to convention there is colour. In truth there are atoms and a void.\" Those investigators attempted to connect all the differences which are observed between the qualities of things with differences of size, shape, position, and movement of atoms. They said that all things are formed by the coalescence of certain unchangeable, indestructible, and impenetrable particles which they named atoms; the total number of atoms is constant; not one of them can be destroyed, nor can one be created; when a substance ceases to exist and another is formed, the process is not a destruction of matter, it is a re-arrangement of atoms.  Only fragments of the writings of the founders of the atomic theory have come to us. The views of these philosophers are preserved, and doubtless amplified and modified, in a Latin poem, _Concerning the Nature of Things_, written by Lucretius, who was born a century before the beginning of our era. Let us consider the picture given in that poem of the material universe, and the method whereby the picture was produced.[2]     [2] The quotations from Lucretius are taken from Munro's    translation (4th Edition, 1886).  All knowledge, said Lucretius, is based on \"the aspect and the law of nature.\" True knowledge can be obtained only by the use of the senses; there is no other method. \"From the senses first has proceeded the knowledge of the true, and the senses cannot be refuted. Shall reason, founded on false sense, be able to contradict [the senses], wholly founded as it is on the senses? And if they are not true, then all reason as well is rendered false.\" The first principle in nature is asserted by Lucretius to be that \"Nothing is ever gotten out of nothing.\" \"A thing never returns to nothing, but all things after disruption go back to the first bodies of matter.\" If there were not imperishable seeds of things, atoms, \"first-beginnings of solid singleness,\" then, Lucretius urges, \"infinite time gone by and lapse of days must have eaten up all things that are of mortal body.\"  The first-beginnings, or atoms, of things were thought of by Lucretius as always moving; \"there is no lowest point in the sum of the universe\" where they can rest; they meet, clash, rebound, or sometimes join together into groups of atoms which move about as wholes. Change, growth, decay, formation, disruption--these are the marks of all things. \"The war of first-beginnings waged from eternity is carried on with dubious issue: now here, now there, the life-bringing elements of things get the mastery, and are o'ermastered in turn; with the funeral wail blends the cry which babies raise when they enter the borders of light; and no night ever followed day, nor morning night, that heard not, mingling with the sickly infant's cries, the attendants' wailings on death and black funeral.\"  Lucretius pictured the atoms of things as like the things perceived by the senses; he said that atoms of different kinds have different shapes, but the number of shapes is finite, because there is a limit to the number of different things we see, smell, taste, and handle; he implies, although I do not think he definitely asserts, that all atoms of one kind are identical in every respect.  We now know that many compounds exist which are formed by the union of the same quantities by weight of the same elements, and, nevertheless, differ in properties; modern chemistry explains this fact by saying that the properties of a substance depend, not only on the kind of atoms which compose the minute particles of a compound, and the number of atoms of each kind, but also on the mode of arrangement of the atoms.[3] The same doctrine was taught by Lucretius, two thousand years ago. \"It often makes a great difference,\" he said, \"with what things, and in what positions the same first-beginnings are held in union, and what motions they mutually impart and receive.\" For instance, certain atoms may be so arranged at one time as to produce fire, and, at another time, the arrangement of the same atoms may be such that the result is a fir-tree. The differences between the colours of things are said by Lucretius to be due to differences in the arrangements and motions of atoms. As the colour of the sea when wind lashes it into foam is different from the colour when the waters are at rest, so do the colours of things change when the atoms whereof the things are composed change from one arrangement to another, or from sluggish movements to rapid and tumultuous motions.     [3] See the chapter _Molecular Architecture_ in the _Story of    the Chemical Elements_.  Lucretius pictured a solid substance as a vast number of atoms squeezed closely together, a liquid as composed of not so many atoms less tightly packed, and a gas as a comparatively small number of atoms with considerable freedom of motion. Essentially the same picture is presented by the molecular theory of to-day.  To meet the objection that atoms"]]]
