Beck in the Child Labor Tax cases. It is to be borne in mind that there are forty-eight state legislatures and only one Congress.]  The assumption of this power in the Court to declare statutes unconstitutional has been bitterly assailed, and is still denounced in some quarters, as judicial usurpation originated by John Marshall.  On the historical side this objection is not well founded. Various state courts had exercised the power to declare statutes unconstitutional before the Supreme Court came into existence.[1] The framers of the Constitution clearly intended that such a power should be exercised by the Supreme Court.[2] Moreover, a somewhat similar power appears to have been exercised long before in England,[3] though it gave place later to the present doctrine of the legal omnipotence of Parliament.  [Footnote 1: See Bryce: \"The American Commonwealth,\" Vol. I, p. 250.]  [Footnote 2: See e.g., \"Federalist,\" No. LXXVIII.]  [Footnote 3: See opinion of Lord Coke in Bonham's Case, 8 Coke's Reports, 118, decided in 1610.]  On the side of reason and logic, the argument in favor of the power formulated more than a century ago by Chief Justice Marshall has never been adequately answered and is generally accepted as final. He said:[1]       The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and      that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the      Constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited,      and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing,      if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended      to be restrained?... The Constitution is either a superior      paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a      level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other acts, is      alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it. If      the former part of the alternative be true, then a legislative      act, contrary to the Constitution, is not law: if the latter      part be true, then written constitutions are absurd attempts,      on the part of the people, to limit a power in its own nature      illimitable.  [Footnote 1: _Marbury v. Madison_, 1 Cranch, 176.]  It would seem at first blush that the power in the Court to declare legislative acts unconstitutional affords a complete safeguard against congressional encroachment on the prerogatives of the states. Such is not the fact, however. The veto power of the Court by no means covers the entire field of legislative activity. In the Convention which framed the Constitution, attempts were made to give to the judiciary, in conjunction with the executive, complete power of revision over legislative acts, but all such propositions were voted down.[1] As matters stand, there may be violations of the Constitution by Congress (or for that matter by the executive) of which the Court can take no cognizance.  [Footnote 1: See e.g., Farrand: \"Records of the Federal Convention,\" Vol. I, pp. 138 et seq.; Vol. II, p. 298.]  For one thing, the Court cannot deal with questions of a political character. The function of the Court is judicial only. Upon this ground it was decided that the question which of two rival governments in the State of Rhode Island was the legitimate one was for the determination of the political department of government rather than the courts;[1] that the question, whether the adoption by a state of the initiative and referendum violated the provision of the Federal Constitution guaranteeing to every state a republican form of government, was political and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the Court.[2] In 1867 a sovereign state sought to enjoin the President of the United States from enforcing an act of Congress alleged to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court, without determining the constitutionality of the act, declined to interfere with the exercise of the President's political discretion.[3] In the famous Dred Scott case[4] the effort of the Supreme Court to settle a political question accomplished nothing save to impair the influence and prestige of the Court.  [Footnote 1: _Luther v. Borden_, 7 Howard, 1.]  [Footnote 2: _Pacific Telephone Co. v. Oregon_, 223 U.S., 118.]  [Footnote 3: _State of Mississippi v. Andrew Johnson_, 4 Wall., 475.]  [Footnote 4: _Dred Scott v. Sandford_, 19 Howard, 393.]  The power of the Court to declare legislative acts unconstitutional is subject to another important limitation. The judicial power is limited by the Constitution to actual cases and controversies between opposing parties. The Court cannot decide moot questions or act as an adviser for other departments of the government. A striking illustration is found in the so-called Muskrat case.[1] Congress having legislated concerning the distribution of property of the Cherokee Indians, and doubts having arisen as to the constitutional validity of the legislation, Congress passed another act empowering one David Muskrat and other Cherokee citizens to file suit, naming the United States as defendant, to settle the question. The Supreme Court declined to take jurisdiction and dismissed the suit, holding that it was not a case or controversy between opposing parties within the meaning of the Constitution.  [Footnote 1: _Muskrat v. United States_, 219 U.S., 346.]  Still another limitation is encountered in cases involving abuse of legislative power rather than lack of power. If Congress passes an act within one of the powers expressly conferred upon it by the Constitution, for example the power to lay taxes or the power to regulate interstate commerce, the Supreme Court cannot interfere though the incidental effect and ulterior purpose of the legislation may be to intrude upon the field of state power. We shall have occasion to refer to this limitation more than once in later chapters.  An impression is abroad that the Supreme Court has plenary power to preserve the Constitution. Hence the tendency of groups to demand, and of legislators to enact, any kind of a law without regard to its constitutional aspect, leaving that to be taken care of by the Court.  Any such impression is erroneous and unfortunate. It puts upon the Court a burden beyond its real powers. It undermines the sense of responsibility which should exist among the elected representatives of the people. It impairs what someone has called the constitutional conscience, and weakens the vigilance of the people in preserving their liberties. Men and women need to be reminded that the duty of upholding the Constitution does not devolve upon the Supreme Court alone. It rests upon all departments of government and, in the last analysis, upon the people themselves.     III  OUR CHANGING CONSTITUTION   In a celebrated case[1] decided a few years ago the Supreme Court of the United States said:       The Constitution is a written instrument. As such its meaning      does not alter. That which it meant when adopted it means now.      Being a grant of powers to a government its language is      general, and as changes come in social and political life it      embraces in its grasp all new conditions which are within the      scope of the powers in terms conferred. In other words, while      the powers granted do not change, they apply from generation      to generation to all things to which they are in their nature      applicable. This in no manner abridges the fact of its      changeless nature and meaning. Those things which are within      its grants of power, as those grants were understood when      made, are still within them, and those things not within them      remain still excluded....       To determine the extent of the grants of power we must,      therefore, place ourselves in the position of the men who      framed and adopted the Constitution, and inquire what they      must have understood to be the meaning and scope of those      grants.  [Footnote 1: _South Carolina v. United States_, 199 U.S., 437.]  Thus speaks the voice whose word is law.  Viewed in the sense intended--as the formulation of a legal rule for the interpretation and construction of a written instrument--the statement compels assent. As a statement of historical and political fact, however, it would not be accepted so readily. An acute critic of our institutions has said that the Constitution \"has changed in the spirit with which men regard it, and therefore in its own spirit.\"[1] Men realize that the words of the Constitution, like the words of Holy Writ, have not always meant the same thing to those who regulate their conduct by its precepts; that the system of government which those words embody has in reality changed, is changing to-day.  [Footnote 1: Bryce: \"The American Commonwealth,\" Vol. I, p. 400.]  The makers of the Constitution represented the people of distinct and independent states, jealous of their rights and of each other but nevertheless impelled by experience of danger lately past and sense of other perils impending to substitute for their loose and ill-working confederation a more effective union. The most formidable obstacle, apart from mutual jealousies, was a fear of loss of liberties, state and individual, through encroachment of the central power. The instrument, drawn with this fear uppermost, was designed to limit the National Government to \"the irreducible minimum of functions absolutely needed for the national welfare.\"[1] To this end the powers granted were specifically enumerated. All other powers were by express enactment[2] \"reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"  [Footnote 1: Bryce, \"The American Commonwealth,\" Vol. I, p. 324.]  [Footnote 2: Tenth Amendment.]  The strength of the popular sentiment against any encroachment of federal power was speedily demonstrated in a striking and dramatic way.

Half amused, half vexed with himself at having without reason interrupted his music, my brother returned to the _Gagliarda_; but some impulse induced him to light the candles in the sconces, which gave an illumination more adequate to the occasion. The _Gagliarda_ and the last movement, a _Minuetto_, were finished, and John closed the book, intending, as it was now late, to seek his bed. As he shut the pages a creaking of the wicker chair again attracted his attention, and he heard distinctly sounds such as would be made by a person raising himself from a sitting posture. This time, being less surprised, he could more aptly consider the probable causes of such a circumstance, and easily arrived at the conclusion that there must be in the wicker chair osiers responsive to certain notes of the violin, as panes of glass in church windows are observed to vibrate in sympathy with certain tones of the organ. But while this argument approved itself to his reason, his imagination was but half convinced; and he could not but be impressed with the fact that the second creaking of the chair had been coincident with his shutting the music-book; and, unconsciously, pictured to himself some strange visitor waiting until the termination of the music, and then taking his departure.  His conjectures did not, however, either rob him of sleep or even disturb it with dreams, and he woke the next morning with a cooler mind and one less inclined to fantastic imagination. If the strange episode of the previous evening had not entirely vanished from his mind, it seemed at least fully accounted for by the acoustic explanation to which I have alluded above. Although he saw Mr. Gaskell in the course of the morning, he did not think it necessary to mention to him so trivial a circumstance, but made with him an appointment to sup together in his own rooms that evening, and to amuse themselves afterwards by essaying some of the Italian music.  It was shortly after nine that night when, supper being finished, Mr. Gaskell seated himself at the piano and John tuned his violin. The evening was closing in; there had been heavy thunder-rain in the afternoon, and the moist air hung now heavy and steaming, while across it there throbbed the distant vibrations of the tenor bell at Christ Church. It was tolling the customary 101 strokes, which are rung every night in term-time as a signal for closing the college gates. The two young men enjoyed themselves for some while, playing first a suite by Cesti, and then two early sonatas by Buononcini. Both of them were sufficiently expert musicians to make reading at sight a pleasure rather than an effort; and Mr. Gaskell especially was well versed in the theory of music, and in the correct rendering of the _basso continuo_. After the Buononcini Mr. Gaskell took up the oblong copy of Graziani, and turning over its leaves, proposed that they should play the same suite which John had performed by himself the previous evening. His selection was apparently perfectly fortuitous, as my brother had purposely refrained from directing his attention in any way to that piece of music. They played the _Coranto_ and the _Sarabanda_, and in the singular fascination of the music John had entirely forgotten the episode of the previous evening, when, as the bold air of the _Gagliarda_ commenced, he suddenly became aware of the same strange creaking of the wicker chair that he had noticed on the first occasion. The sound was identical, and so exact was its resemblance to that of a person sitting down that he stared at the chair, almost wondering that it still appeared empty. Beyond turning his head sharply for a moment to look round, Mr. Gaskell took no notice of the sound; and my brother, ashamed to betray any foolish interest or excitement, continued the _Gagliarda_, with its repeat. At its conclusion Mr. Gaskell stopped before proceeding to the minuet, and turning the stool on which he was sitting round towards the room, observed, \"How very strange, Johnnie,\"--for these young men were on terms of sufficient intimacy to address each other in a familiar style,--\"How very strange! I thought I heard some one sit down in that chair when we began the _Gagliarda_. I looked round quite expecting to see some one had come in. Did you hear nothing?\"  \"It was only the chair creaking,\" my brother answered, feigning an indifference which he scarcely felt. \"Certain parts of the wicker-work seem to be in accord with musical notes and respond to them; let us continue with the _Minuetto_.\"  Thus they finished the suite, Mr. Gaskell demanding a repetition of the _Gagliarda_, with the air of which he was much pleased. As the clocks had already struck eleven, they determined not to play more that night; and Mr. Gaskell rose, blew out the sconces, shut the piano, and put the music aside. My brother has often assured me that he was quite prepared for what followed, and had been almost expecting it; for as the books were put away, a creaking of the wicker chair was audible, exactly similar to that which he had heard when he stopped playing on the previous night. There was a moment's silence; the young men looked involuntarily at one another, and then Mr. Gaskell said, \"I cannot understand the creaking of that chair; it has never done so before, with all the music we have played. I am perhaps imaginative and excited with the fine airs we have heard to-night, but I have an impression that I cannot dispel that something has been sitting listening to us all this time, and that now when the concert is ended it has got up and gone.\" There was a spirit of raillery in his words, but his tone was not so light as it would ordinarily have been, and he was evidently ill at ease.  \"Let us try the _Gagliarda_ again,\" said my brother; \"it is the vibration of the opening notes which affects the wicker-work, and we shall see if the noise is repeated.\" But Mr. Gaskell excused himself from trying the experiment, and after some desultory conversation, to which it was evident that neither was giving any serious attention, he took his leave and returned to New College.     CHAPTER II   I shall not weary you, my dear Edward, by recounting similar experiences which occurred on nearly every occasion that the young men met in the evenings for music. The repetition of the phenomenon had accustomed them to expect it. Both professed to be quite satisfied that it was to be attributed to acoustical affinities of vibration between the wicker-work and certain of the piano wires, and indeed this seemed the only explanation possible. But, at the same time, the resemblance of the noises to those caused by a person sitting down in or rising from a chair was so marked, that even their frequent recurrence never failed to make a strange impression on them. They felt a reluctance to mention the matter to their friends, partly from a fear of being themselves laughed at, and partly to spare from ridicule a circumstance to which each perhaps, in spite of himself, attached some degree of importance. Experience soon convinced them that the first noise as of one sitting down never occurred unless the _Gagliarda_ of the \"Areopagita\" was played, and that this noise being once heard, the second only followed it when they ceased playing for the evening. They met every night, sitting later with the lengthening summer evenings, and every night, as by some tacit understanding, played the \"Areopagita\" suite before parting. At the opening bars of the _Gagliarda_ the creaking of the chair occurred spontaneously with the utmost regularity. They seldom spoke even to one another of the subject; but one night, when John was putting away his violin after a long evening's music without having played the \"Areopagita,\" Mr. Gaskell, who had risen from the pianoforte, sat down again as by a sudden impulse and said--  \"Johnnie, do not put away your violin yet. It is near twelve o'clock and I shall get shut out, but I cannot stop to-night without playing the _Gagliarda_. Suppose that all our theories of vibration and affinity are wrong, suppose that there really comes here night by night some strange visitant to hear us, some poor creature whose heart is bound up in that tune; would it not be unkind to send him away without the hearing of that piece which he seems most to relish? Let us not be ill-mannered, but humour his whim; let us play the _Gagliarda_.\"  They played it with more vigour and precision than usual, and the now customary sound of one taking his seat at once ensued. It was that night that my brother, looking steadfastly at the chair, saw, or thought he saw, there some slight obscuration, some penumbra, mist, or subtle vapour which, as he gazed, seemed to struggle to take human form. He ceased playing for a moment and rubbed his eyes, but as he did so all dimness vanished and he saw the chair perfectly empty. The pianist stopped also at the cessation of the violin, and asked what ailed him.  \"It is only that my eyes were dim,\" he answered.  \"We have had enough for to-night,\" said Mr. Gaskell; \"let us stop. I shall be locked out.\" He shut the piano, and as he did so the clock in New College tower struck twelve. He left the room running, but was late enough at his college door to be reported, admonished with a fine against such late hours, and confined for a week to college; for being out after midnight was considered, at that time at least, a somewhat serious offence.  Thus for some days the musical practice was compulsorily intermitted, but resumed on the first evening after Mr. Gaskell's term of confinement was expired. After they had performed several suites of Graziani, and finished as usual with the \"Areopagita,\" Mr. Gaskell sat for a time silent at the instrument, as though thinking with himself, and then said--  \"I cannot say how deeply this old-fashioned music affects me. Some would try to persuade us"]]]
