Queen Victoria, said she to me, said she, 'Now, Santa, my love, do you hurry back to fill my children's stockings before the clock strikes twelve.' Queen Vic is an excellent woman, and is left a poor widow; so I can't disappoint her, poor soul!  \"I must be a-goin'! Would like to hug and kiss you all round, but can't stop. (Kisses his hand and bows.) A Merry Christmas to you all, and a Happy New Year.\"  So saying, Santa Claus suddenly disappeared at the hall door, dropping his heavy pack upon the table.  In another minute the lively old gentleman was in the front parlor without any mask, and of course it was nobody but cousin Percy \"with his face off.\"  Then they all fell to work sorting out presents. Prudy seized her fur tippet, and put it on at once.  \"O, how pretty I look,\" said she; \"just like a little cat! _Ain't_ I cunning?\"  But nobody could pause to attend to Prudy, though she chatted very fast, without commas or periods, and held up to view a large wax doll which \"would be alive if it could talk.\" They all had gifts as well as Prudy, and wished to talk rather than to listen. They asked questions without waiting for answers, and did not mind interrupting one another, and talking all at once, like a party of school children.  All this was hardly polite, it is true; but people are sometimes surprised out of their good manners on Christmas evenings, and must be forgiven for it, as such a good time happens but once a year.  Percy broke in with an old song, and went through with a whole stanza of it, although no one listened to a word:--      \"Good luck unto old Christmas,       And long life let us sing,     For he doeth more good unto the poor       Than many a crown√©d king.\"  \"My beautiful books!\" cried aunt Madge; \"Russia morocco.\"  \"My writing-desk,--has any one looked at it?\" said Mrs. Parlin; \"rose-wood, inlaid with brass.\"  \"My skates!\" broke in Susy, at the top of her voice.  \"Hush!\" screamed cousin Percy; \"won't anybody please notice my drum? If you won't look, then look out for a drum in each ear!\"  And as nobody would look or pay the slightest attention, they all had to hear \"Dixie\" pounded out in true martial style, till they held on to their ears.  \"Rattlety bang!\" went the drum. \"Tweet, tweet,\" whistled the little musical instruments which the children were blowing.  \"Have pity on us!\" cried aunt Madge; \"I am bewildered; my head is floating like a Chinese garden.\"  \"Order!\" shouted Mr. Parlin, laughing.  \"O, yes, sir,\" said Percy, seizing Susy and whirling her round. \"Children, why don't you try to preserve order? My nerves are strung up like violin-strings! I've got a pound of headache to every ounce of brains. Susy Parlin, do try to keep still!\"  \"Thee needn't pretend it is all Susan,\" said grandma Read, smiling. \"Thee and little Prudence are the noisiest of the whole!\"  In fact, they raised such a din, that after a while poor grandma Read smoothed the Quaker cap over her smiling face, and stole off into her own chamber, where she could \"settle down into quietness.\" Much noise always confused grandma Read.  But in a very few moments, when the excitement began to die out, there was a season of overwhelming gratitude. Everybody had to thank everybody else; and Mr. Parlin, who had a beautiful dressing-gown to be grateful for, nevertheless found time to tell Susy, over and over again, how delighted he was with her book-mark, made, by her own fingers, of three wide strips of velvet ribbon; on the ends of which were fastened a cross, a star, and an anchor, of card-board.  \"Papa, one ribbon is to keep your place in the Old Testament,\" said Susy; \"one is to stay in the middle, at the births and marriages; and the other one is for our chapter in the New Testament, you know.\"  \"I think my lamp-mat is very pretty,\" said aunt Madge, kissing Susy; \"every bit as pretty as if Prudy hadn't 'been and told.'\"  Prudy had bought a shawl-pin for her mother, a fierce little wooden soldier for aunt Madge, and something for everybody else but Susy. Not that she forgot Susy. O, no! but one's money does not always hold out, even at Christmas time.  \"Why,\" said Mr. Parlin, \"what is this sticking fast to the sole of my new slipper? Molasses candy, I do believe.\"  \"Yes sir; that's for Susy,\" cried Prudy, suddenly remembering how she had tucked it in at the last moment, when she could not stop to find any wrapping-paper. \"It isn't so big as it was, but it's the biggest piece I had in this world. I saved it last night. Susy likes 'lasses candy, and I couldn't think of nothin' else.\"  It was a wonder that Prudy's candy had not spoiled some of the nice presents.  Susy received several pretty things; and though she did not talk quite so much as Prudy, she was just as happy. For one thing, she had what she had not dreamed was possible for a little girl--a bottle of otto of rose; \"just like a young lady.\"  This was a real delight to Susy: but Prudy, sniffing at it, said, coolly, \"O, ho! it smells 's if it didn't cost more'n a cent! 'Tisn't half so sweet as pep'mint!\"  Before Dotty could be put to bed, she had contrived to break several toys, all of which happened to be Susy's--a sugar temple, a glass pitcher, and a small vase.  This was an evening long to be remembered; but the most remarkable event of all was to come.  \"Susy, my daughter,\" said Mr. Parlin, \"have you been wondering why you don't see a present from me?\"  Susy blushed. She had certainly expected something handsome this year from her father.  \"I haven't forgotten you, my dear; but the present I have chosen wouldn't sit very well on the shoulders of such a little fellow as Santa Claus.\"  Percy laughed. \"Wouldn't it have been a load, uncle?\"  \"Hush!\" whispered aunt Madge; \"she isn't to know till morning.\"  \"But, papa,\" said Susy, her eyes shining with excitement, \"why couldn't you bring it in here now?\"  \"It is better off out of doors. Indeed, to tell the truth, my child, it is hardly suitable for the parlor.\"  \"Now, Miss Susy,\" said Percy, measuring off his words on the tips of his fingers, \"I'm authorized to tell you it's something you mustn't take in your lap, mustn't hang on a nail; if you do, you'll lose it. I'm sure 'twill please you, Susy, because it's a mute, and can't speak. You--\"  \"O, hush talking about dumb people! I shouldn't think you'd make sport of Freddy Jackson! If _you_ was a little _deaf-and-dumber_ than you are now, I'd like you better!  \"O, dear, dear!\" cried she, dancing about the room; \"what can it be? I can't wait!\"  \"Only think; all night before I'll know,\" thought she, as she touched her pillow. \"O, Prudy, to-morrow morning! Only think of to-morrow morning I All my other presents are just nothing at all. Anything is _so_ much nicer when you don't know what it is!\"     CHAPTER IV.  SUSY'S WINGS.   Susy awoke next morning very much surprised to find the sun so high. Prudy was lying beside her, talking to herself.  \"I don't feel very well,\" said the child; \"but I'm pleasant; I mean to be good all day.\"  \"Why didn't you speak to me?\" cried Susy, springing out of bed, \"when you knew how I couldn't wait to see my present?\"  \"I would have woke you up, Susy, but I ain't well; I'm sick in my knees.\"  And Prudy limped about the room to show her sister how lame she was. But Susy was in too great a hurry to pay much attention to her, or to help her dress.  \"Good morning, papa!\" she exclaimed, the moment she entered the parlor; \"now may I see the present?\"  \"Do you suppose you could wait till after breakfast, Susy?\"  Aunt Madge smiled as she looked at the little eager face.  \"I see you are going on with your lessons,\" said she.  \"What lessons, auntie? Why, it is the holidays!\"  \"Lessons in patience, my dear. Isn't something always happening which you have to be patient about?\"  Susy thought of Prudy's habit of disclosing secrets, Dotty's trying way of destroying playthings; and now this long delay about her present. She began to think there were a great many vexations in the world, and that she bore them remarkably well for such a little girl.  \"Yes, thee must let patience have her perfect work, Susan,\" said grandma Read, after the \"silent blessing\" had been asked at the table.  \"Mayn't I go, too?\" said Prudy, when she saw her father, her auntie, and Susy leaving the house just after breakfast.  And she went, as a matter of course; but the pavements were a little slippery from sleet; and Prudy, who was never a famous walker, had as much as she could do, even with the help of her father's hand, to keep from falling.  \"Why, Prudy,\" said Mr. Parlin, \"what ails you this morning? You limp so much that I believe you need crutches.\"  \"I'm sick in my knee,\" replied Prudy, delighted to see that her lameness was observed. \"If _you_ had my knee, and it hurt, you'd know how it feels!\"  By this time they had reached a livery stable; and, to Susy's surprise, her father stopped short, and said to a man who stood by the door, \"Mr. Hill, my daughter has come to look at her pony.\"  Prudy was in a great fright at sight of so many horses, and needed all her auntie's attention; but Susy had no fear, and Mr. Parlin led her along to a stall where stood a beautiful black pony, as gentle-looking as a Newfoundland dog.  \"How do you like him, Susy? Stroke his face, and talk to him.\"  \"But, O, papa, you don't mean, you can't mean, he's my very own! A whole pony all to myself!\"  \"See what you think of his saddle, miss,\" said Mr. Hill, laughing at Susy's eagerness; and he led pony out, and threw over his back a handsome side-saddle.  \"Why, it seems as if I could just jump on without anybody touching me,\" cried Susy.  \"Not afraid a bit?\" said Mr. Hill, as Mr. Parlin seated Susy in the saddle, and gave her the reins. \"Ponies throw people, sometimes.\"  \"O, but my papa would never give me a bad pony,\" answered Susy, with perfect confidence.  Mr. Hill laughed again. He was a rough man; but he thought a child's faith in a parent was a beautiful thing.  He did not know many passages "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],["title","The Kybalion (#1)"],["body","ays. He was known as Hermes Trismegistus. He was the father of the Occult Wisdom; the founder of Astrology; the discoverer of Alchemy. The details of his life story are lost to history, owing to the lapse of the years, though several of the ancient countries disputed with each other in their claims to the honor of having furnished his birthplace--and this thousands of years ago. The date of his sojourn in Egypt, in that his last incarnation on this planet, is not now known, but it has been fixed at the early days of the oldest dynasties of Egypt--long before the days of Moses. The best authorities regard him as a contemporary of Abraham, and some of the Jewish traditions go so far as to claim that Abraham acquired a portion of his mystic knowledge from Hermes himself.  As the years rolled by after his passing from this plane of life (tradition recording that he lived three hundred years in the flesh), the Egyptians deified Hermes, and made him one of their gods, under the name of Thoth. Years after, the people of Ancient Greece also made him one of their many gods--calling him \"Hermes, the god of Wisdom.\" The Egyptians revered his memory for many centuries-yes, tens of centuries-- calling him \"the Scribe of the Gods,\" and bestowing upon him, distinctively, his ancient title, \"Trismegistus,\" which means \"the thrice-great\"; \"the great-great\"; \"the greatest-great\"; etc. In all the ancient lands, the name of Hermes Trismegistus was revered, the name being synonymous with the \"Fount of Wisdom.\"  Even to this day, we use the term \"hermetic\" in the sense of \"secret\"; \"sealed so that nothing can escape\"; etc., and this by reason of the fact that the followers of Hermes always observed the principle of secrecy in their teachings. They did not believe in \"casting pearls before swine,\" but rather held to the teaching \"milk for babes\"; \"meat for strong men,\" both of which maxims are familiar to readers of the Christian scriptures, but both of which had been used by the Egyptians for centuries before the Christian era.  And this policy of careful dissemination of the truth has always characterized the Hermetics, even unto the present day. The Hermetic Teachings are to be found in all lands, among all religions, but never identified with any particular country, nor with any particular religious sect. This because of the warning of the ancient teachers against allowing the Secret Doctrine to become crystallized into a creed. The wisdom of this caution is apparent to all students of history. The ancient occultism of India and Persia degenerated, and was largely lost, owing to the fact that the teachers became priests, and so mixed theology with the philosophy, the result being that the occultism of India and Persia has been gradually lost amidst the mass of religious superstition, cults, creeds and \"gods.\" So it was with Ancient Greece and Rome. So it was with the Hermetic Teachings of the Gnostics and Early Christians, which were lost at the time of Constantine, whose iron hand smothered philosophy with the blanket of theology, losing to the Christian Church that which was its very essence and spirit, and causing it to grope throughout several centuries before it found the way back to its ancient faith, the indications apparent to all careful observers in this Twentieth Century being that the Church is now struggling to get back to its ancient mystic teachings.  But there were always a few faithful souls who kept alive the Flame, tending it carefully, and not allowing its light to become extinguished. And thanks to these staunch hearts, and fearless minds, we have the truth still with us.  But it is not found in books, to any great extent. It has been passed along from Master to Student; from Initiate to Hierophant; from lip to ear. When it was written down at all, its meaning was veiled in terms of alchemy and astrology so that only those possessing the key could read it aright. This was made necessary in order to avoid the persecutions of the theologians of the Middle Ages, who fought the Secret Doctrine with fire and sword; stake, gibbet and cross. Even to this day there will be found but few reliable books on the Hermetic Philosophy, although there are countless references to it in many books written on various phases of Occultism. And yet, the Hermetic Philosophy is the only Master Key which will open all the doors of the Occult Teachings!  In the early days, there was a compilation of certain Basic Hermetic Doctrines, passed on from teacher to student, which was known as \"THE KYBALION,\" the exact significance and meaning of the term having been lost for several centuries. This teaching, however, is known to many to whom it has descended, from mouth to ear, on and on throughout the centuries. Its precepts have never been written down, or printed, so far as we know. It was merely a collection of maxims, axioms, and precepts, which were non-understandable to outsiders, but which were readily understood by students, after the axioms, maxims, and precepts had been explained and exemplified by the Hermetic Initiates to their Neophytes. These teachings really constituted the basic principles of \"The Art of Hermetic Alchemy,\" which, contrary to the general belief, dealt in the mastery of Mental Forces, rather than Material Elements-the Transmutation of one kind of Mental Vibrations into others, instead of the changing of one kind of metal into another. The legends of the \"Philosopher's Stone\" which would turn base metal into Gold, was an allegory relating to Hermetic Philosophy, readily understood by all students of true Hermeticism.  In this little book, of which this is the First Lesson, we invite our students to examine into the Hermetic Teachings, as set forth in THE KYBALION, and as explained by ourselves, humble students of the Teachings, who, while bearing the title of Initiates, are still students at the feet of HERMES, the Master. We herein give you many of the maxims, axioms and precepts of THE KYBALION, accompanied by explanations and illustrations which we deem likely to render the teachings more easily comprehended by the modern student, particularly as the original text is purposely veiled in obscure terms.  The original maxims, axioms, and precepts of THE KYBALION are printed herein, in italics, the proper credit being given. Our own work is printed in the regular way, in the body of the work. We trust that the many students to whom we now offer this little work will derive as much benefit from the study of its pages as have the many who have gone on before, treading the same Path to Mastery throughout the centuries that have passed since the times of HERMES TRISMEGISTUS--the Master of Masters--the Great-Great. In the words of \"THE KYBALION\":      \"Where fall the footsteps of the Master, the ears of those     ready for his Teaching open wide.\"--The Kybalion.      \"When the ears of the student are ready to hear, then cometh     the lips to fill them with Wisdom.\"--The Kybalion.  So that according to the Teachings, the passage of this book to those ready for the instruction will attract the attention of such as are prepared to receive the Teaching. And, likewise, when the pupil is ready to receive the truth, then will this little book come to him, or her. Such is The Law. The Hermetic Principle of Cause and Effect, in its aspect of The Law of Attraction, will bring lips and ear together--pupil and book in company. So mote it be!    CHAPTER II  THE SEVEN HERMETIC PRINCIPLES      \"The Principles of Truth are Seven; he who knows these,     understandingly, possesses the Magic Key before whose     touch all the Doors of the Temple fly open.\"--The Kybalion.  The Seven Hermetic Principles, upon which the entire Hermetic Philosophy is based, are as follows:      1. The Principle of Mentalism.     2. The Principle of Correspondence.     3. The Principle of Vibration.     4. The Principle of Polarity.     5. The Principle of Rhythm.     6. The Principle of Cause and Effect.     7. The Principle of Gender.  These Seven Principles will be discussed and explained as we proceed with these lessons. A short explanation of each, however, may as well be given at this point.  1.  The Principle of Mentalism      \"THE ALL IS MIND; The Universe is Mental.\"--The Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the truth that \"All is Mind.\" It explains that THE ALL (which is the Substantial Reality underlying all the outward manifestations and appearances which we know under the terms of \"The Material Universe\"; the \"Phenomena of Life\"; \"Matter\"; \"Energy\"; and, in short, all that is apparent to our material senses) is SPIRIT which in itself is UNKNOWABLE and UNDEFINABLE, but which may be considered and thought of as AN UNIVERSAL, INFINITE, LIVING MIND. It also explains that all the phenomenal world or universe is simply a Mental Creation of THE ALL, subject to the Laws of Created Things, and that the universe, as a whole, and in its parts or units, has its existence in the Mind of THE ALL, in which Mind we \"live and move and have our being.\" This Principle, by establishing the Mental Nature of the Universe, easily explains all of the varied mental and psychic phenomena that occupy such a large portion of the public attention, and which, without such explanation, are non-understandable and defy scientific treatment. An understanding of this great Hermetic Principle of Mentalism enables the individual to readily grasp the laws of the Mental Universe, and to apply the same to his well-being and advancement. The Hermetic Student is enabled to apply intelligently the great Mental Laws, instead of using them in a haphazard manner. With the Master-Key in his possession, the student may unlock the many doors of the mental and psychic temple of knowledge, and enter the same freely and intelligently. This Principle explains the true nature of \"Energy,\" \"Power,\" and \"Matter,\" and why and how all these are subordinate to the Mastery of Mind. One of the old"]]]
