I guess this is the end of my adventures,\" thought the rabbit. \"I should have been more careful. Well, I wish I could see Sammie and Susie before he eats me, but I'm afraid I can't. I shouldn't have jumped down here.\"  But as Uncle Wiggily happened to think of Sammie Littletail, the boy rabbit, he also thought of something else. And this was that Sammie had put something in the old gentleman rabbit's valise that morning, before his uncle had started off.  \"If you ever get into trouble, Uncle Wiggily,\" Sammie had said, \"this may come in useful for you.\" Uncle Wiggily didn't look at the time to see what it was that his nephew put in the valise, but he made up his mind he would do so now. So he opened his satchel, and there, among other things, was a long piece of thin, but strong rope. And pinned to it was a note which read:  \"Dear Uncle Wiggily. This is good to help you get out of a window, in case of fire.\"  \"My goodness!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, \"that's fine. There the bear is making a fire to cook me, and with this rope I can get away from it. Now if there's only a window in this closet I'm all right.\"  So he looked, and sure enough there was a window. And with his crutch Uncle Wiggily raised it. Then he threw out his satchel, and he tied the rope to a hook on the window sill, and, being a strong old gentleman, he crawled out of the window, and slid down the cord.  And Uncle Wiggily got out just as the bear opened the closet door to grab him, and put him in the pot, and when the savage black creature saw his fine rabbit dinner getting away he was as angry as anything, really he was.  \"Here! Come back here!\" cried the bear, but of course Uncle Wiggily knew better than to come back. He slid down the rope to the ground, and then he cut off as much of the rope as he could, and put it in his pocket, for he didn't know when he might need it again. Then, catching up his valise, he ran on and on, before the bear could get to him.  It was still quite a dark place in which Uncle Wiggily was, for you see he was underground, down by the roots of the stump. But he looked ahead and he saw a little glimmer of light, and then he knew he could get out.  Limping on his crutch, and carrying his valise, he went on and on, and pretty soon he came out of a dark cave and found himself on the bank of a nice little brook, that was running over mossy, green stones.  \"Ha! This is better than being in a bear's den!\" exclaimed the old gentleman rabbit. \"My, I was so frightened that I forgot about my rheumatism hurting me. That was an adventure all right, and Sammie was a good boy to think of that strong cord. Now what shall I do next?\"  Well, Uncle Wiggily sat down on the bank of the brook, and he looked in the water. Then he happened to see a fish jump up to catch a bug, so he said to himself:  \"I guess I will go fishing, just for fun. But if I do happen to catch any fish I'll put them right back in the water again. For I don't need any fish, as I have some lettuce and cabbage sandwiches, and some peanut-butter cakes, that Susie's mamma put up in a cracker-box for me.\"  Well, Uncle Wiggily looked in his valise, to make sure his lunch was safe, and then, taking a bent pin from under his vest, he fastened it to a part of the string Sammie had given him. Then he fastened the string to a pole, and he was ready to fish, but he needed something to make the fishes bite--that is, bite the pinhook, not bite him, you know.  \"Oh, I guess they'll like a bit of sweet cracker,\" Uncle Wiggily thought; so he put some on the end of the pin-hook, and threw it toward the water.  It fell in with a splash, and made a lot of little circles, like ring-around the rosies, and the rabbit sat there looking at them, sort of nodding, and half asleep and wondering what adventure would happen to him next, and where he would stay that night. All of a sudden he felt something tugging at the hook and line.  \"Oh, I've got a fish! I've got a fish!\" he cried, as he lifted up the pole. Up out of the water with a sizzling rush flew the string and the sweet cracker bait, and the next minute out leaped the big, savage alligator that had escaped from a circus.  \"Oh, ho! So you tried to catch me, eh?\" the alligator shouted at Uncle Wiggily.  \"No--no, if you please,\" said the rabbit. \"I was after fish.\"  \"And I'm after you!\" cried the alligator, and, scrambling up the bank, he made a jump for Uncle Wiggily, and with one sweep of his kinky, scaly tail he flopped and he threw the old gentleman rabbit and his crutch and valise right up into a big tree that grew near the brook.  \"There you'll stay until I get ready to eat you!\" exclaimed the alligator, as he stood up on the end of his tail under the tree, and opened his mouth as wide as he could so that if Uncle Wiggily fell down he'd fall into it, just like down a funnel, you know.  Well, the poor gentleman rabbit clung to the topmost tree branch, wondering how in the world he was going to escape from the alligator. Oh, it was a dreadful position to be in!  But please don't worry or stay awake over it, for I'll find a way to get him down safely. And in the story after this, if the milkman doesn't leave us sour cream for our lemonade, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the black crow.     STORY III  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BLACK CROW   Let me see, where did I leave off in the last story? Oh! I remember. It was about Uncle Wiggily Longears being up in the top of the tall tree, and the alligator keeping guard down below, ready to eat him.  Well, the old gentleman rabbit was wondering how he could ever escape, and he felt quite badly about it.  \"I guess this is the end of my adventures,\" he said to himself. \"It would have been much better had I stayed at home with Sammie and Susie.\" And as he thought of the two rabbit children he felt still sadder, and very lonely.  \"I wonder if Susie could have put anything in my satchel with which to scare an alligator,\" thought Uncle Wiggily. \"I guess I'll look.\" So he looked, and what should he find but a bottle of toothache drops. Yes, there it was, and wrapped ground it was a little note Susie had written.  \"Dear Uncle Wiggily,\" she said in the note, \"if you ever get the toothache on your travels, this will stop it.\"  \"Ha! That is very kind of Susie, I'm sure,\" said the rabbit, \"but I don't see how that is going to make the alligator go away. And, even if he does go, I wonder how I'm to get down out of this tall tree, with my crutch, my valise and my rheumatism?\"  Well, just then the alligator got tired of standing on the end of his tail, with his mouth open, and he began crawling around. Then he thought of what a good supper he was going to have of Uncle Wiggily, and that alligator said:  \"I guess I'll sharpen my teeth so I can eat him better,\" and with that the savage and unpleasant creature began to gnaw on a stone, to sharpen his teeth. Then he stood up on the end of his tail once more, under the tree, and opened his mouth as wide as he could.  \"Come on now!\" he called to Uncle Wiggily. \"Jump down and have it over with.\"  \"Oh, but I don't want to,\" objected the rabbit.  \"You'll have to, whether you want to or not,\" went on the alligator. \"If you don't come down, I'll take my scaly, naily tail, and I'll saw down the tree, and then you'll fall.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"What shall I do?\"  Then he happened to think of the bottle of toothache medicine that he held in his hand, and, taking out the cork, he dropped the bottle, medicine and all, right into the open mouth of the alligator, who was again up on his tail.  And the alligator thought it was Uncle Wiggily falling into his jaws, and he shut them quickly like a steel trap and chewed on that bottle of hot toothache drops before he knew what it was.  Well, you can just imagine what happened. The medicine was as hot as pepper and mustard and vinegar and cloves and horse radish all made into one! My! how it did burn that alligator's mouth.  \"Oh my! I'm shot! I'm poisoned! I'm bitten by a mosquito! I'm stabbed! I'm all scrambled up\" cried the alligator. \"Water, water, quick! I must have water!\"  Then he gave a big jump, and, with his kinkery-scalery tail, he leaped into a big puddle of water, and went away down in under, out of sight, to cool off his mouth.  \"Oh, now is my chance! If I could only get down out of the tree!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"But with my rheumatism I'm afraid I'll fall. Oh dear! What shall I do?\"  \"Don't be afraid, I'll help you!\" exclaimed a kind voice, and then the voice went on: \"Caw! Caw! Caw!\" and Uncle Wiggily, looking up, saw a big black crow perched on a limb over his head.  \"Oh, how do you do!\" spoke Uncle Wiggily, making a bow as well as he could. \"Can you really help me down?'  \"Yes,\" said the crow, \"I can. Wait until I get my market basket. I was just going to the grocery, but I'm in no hurry. I'll save you first.\"  So that crow flew off, and in a moment he came back with a big basket in its bill.  \"Hop in!\" the black crow called to Uncle Wiggily, \"and I'll fly down to the ground with you, and you can run off before the alligator comes out of the water. I saw what you did to him with those toothache drops, and it served him right. Come on, hop in the basket.\"  So Uncle Wiggily got in the basket, and the crow, taking the handle in his strong beak, flew safely to the ground with him. And that's how the old gentleman rabbit got down out of the tree, just as I told you he would.  So he and the crow walked on some distance through the woods together, after Uncle Wiggily had picked up his crutch and valise, which had fallen out of the basket, and they got safely away before the alligator came out of the water. And wasn't he the provoked old beastie, though, when he saw that his rabbit supper was gone?  \"Where are you going?\" asked the crow "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15281"],["title","Uncle Wiggily's Adventures (#2)"],["body","Uncle Wiggily, after a bit, when they got to a nice big stone, and sat down for a rest.  \"I am seeking my fortune,\" replied the old gentleman rabbit, \"and trying to get better of my rheumatism. Dr. Possum told me to travel, and have adventures, and I've had quite a few already.\"  \"Well, I hope you find your fortune and that it turns out to be a very good one,\" said the kind crow. \"But it is coming on night now. Have you any place to stay?\"  \"No,\" replied the rabbit, \"I haven't. I never thought about that. What shall I do?\"  \"Oh, don't worry,\" said the crow. \"I'd let you stay in my nest, but it is up a high tree, and you would have trouble climbing in and out. But near my nest-house is an old hollow stump, and you can stay in that very nicely.\"  \"Are there any bears in it?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, careful-like.  \"Oh, no; not a one. It is very safe.\"  So the crow showed Uncle Wiggily where the hollow stump was, and he slept there all night, on a soft bed of leaves. And when he awakened in the morning he had breakfast with the crow and once more started off to seek his fortune.  Well, pretty soon, in a short while, not so very long, he came to a little house made of bark, standing in the middle of a deep, dark, dismal woods. And on the door of the house was a sign which read:  \"If you want to be surprised, open this door and come in.\"  \"Perhaps I can find my fortune in there, and get rid of the rheumatism,\" thought Uncle Wiggily, so he hopped forward. And just as he did so he heard a voice calling to him:  \"Don't go in! Don't go in there, Uncle Wiggily!\"  The rabbit looked up, and saw Johnnie Bushytail, the squirrel boy, waving his paws at him. Well, Uncle Wiggily started to jump back away from the door of the little house, but it was too late. Out came a scraggily-raggily claw, which grabbed him, while a voice cried out:  \"Ah, ha! Now I have you! Come right in!\"  And then, before you could shake a stick at a bad dog, the door was slammed shut and locked, and there Uncle Wiggily was inside the house, and Johnnie Bushytail was crying outside.  \"That's the end of poor Uncle Wiggily!\" said Johnnie. But it wasn't. For I'll not leave the old gentleman rabbit alone in the house with that clawy creature. And in the next story, providing our wash lady doesn't put my new straw hat in the soap suds, and take all the color out of the ribbon, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and Fido Flip-Flop.     STORY IV  UNCLE WIGGILY AND FIDO FLIP-FLOP   Well, as soon as Uncle Wiggily found himself inside the bear's den--oh, just listen to me! That was in the other story, wasn't it? Yes, we left him in the funny little house in the woods, with the clawy creature grabbing him.  Now, what do you suppose that clawy creature was? Why, a great, big owl, to be sure, with round, staring, yellow eyes, and he had grabbed Uncle Wiggily in his claws, and pulled him inside the house.  \"Now, I've got you!\" cried the owl. \"I was just wishing some one would come along, and you did. Some of my friends are coming to tea this afternoon, and you'll do very nicely made up into sandwiches.\"  Wasn't that a perfectly dreadful way to talk about our Uncle Wiggily? Well, I guess yes!  \"Now you're here, make yourself at home,\" went on the owl, sarcastic-like, as he locked the front door and put the key in his pocket. \"Did you see the sign?\"  \"Yes,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"I did. But I don't call it fair. I thought I would find my fortune in here.\"  \"The sign says you'll be surprised, and I guess you are surprised, aren't you?\" asked the owl.  \"Yes,\" answered the rabbit, \"very much so. But I'd rather have a nice surprise party, with peanuts and lemonade, than this.\"  \"No matter,\" said the owl, snapping his beak like a pair of shears, \"here you are and here you'll stay! My friends will soon arrive. I'll now put the kettle on, to boil for tea.\"  Well, poor Uncle Wiggily didn't know what to do. He couldn't look in his valise to see if there was anything in it by which he might escape, for he had dropped the satchel outside when the owl grabbed him, and he only had his barber-pole crutch.  \"Oh, this is worse and worse!\" thought the poor old rabbit.  But listen, Johnnie Bushytail is outside the owl's house, and he's going to do a wonderful trick.  As soon as he saw the door shut on Uncle Wiggily, that brave squirrel boy began to plan how he could save him, and the first thing he did was to gather up a lot of acorns.  Then he perched himself in a tree, right in front of the owl's door, and Johnnie began throwing acorns at it. \"Rat-a-tat-tat!\" went the acorns on the wooden panels.  \"Ha! Those must be my friends!\" exclaimed the bad owl, opening the door a little crack so he could peek out, but taking care to stand in front of it, so that Uncle Wiggily couldn't slip out. But, of course, the owl saw no one. \"It must have been the wind,\" he said as he shut the door.  Then Johnnie Bushytail threw some more acorns at the door. \"Pitter-patter-patter-pit!\" they went, like hailstones in an ice cream can.  \"Ah, there are my friends, sure, this time!\" thought the owl, and once more he peered out, but no one was there. \"It must have been a tree branch hitting against the door,\" said the owl, as he sharpened a big knife with which to make the sandwiches. Then Johnnie threw some more acorns, and the owl now thought positively his friends were there, and when he opened it and saw no one he was real mad.  \"Some one is playing tricks on me!\" exclaimed the savage bird. \"I'll catch them next time!\"  Now this was just what Johnnie Bushytail wanted, so he threw a whole double handful of acorns at the door, and when the owl heard them pattering against the wood he rushed out.  \"Now, I've got you!\" he cried, but he hadn't, for Johnnie was up a tree. And, for the moment, the owl forgot about Uncle Wiggily, and there the door was wide open.  \"Run out, Uncle Wiggily! Run out!\" cried Johnnie, and out the old gentleman rabbit hopped, catching up his valise, and away into the woods he ran, with Johnnie scurrying along in the tree tops above him, and laughing at the owl, who flew back to his house, but too late to catch the bunny.  \"That's what you get for fooling people so they'll come into your house,\" called the squirrel boy. \"It serves you right, Mr. Owl. Come on, Uncle Wiggily, we'll get away from here.\"  So they went on together until it was time for Johnnie to go home, and he said he'd tell Uncle Wiggily's friends that he had met the old gentleman rabbit, and that he hadn't found his fortune yet, but that he was looking for it every minute, and had had many adventures.  Well, Uncle Wiggily went on some more, for quite a distance, until it was noon time, and then he sat down in the cool, green woods, where there were some jacks-in-the-pulpit growing near some ferns, and there Uncle Wiggily ate his lunch of lettuce sandwiches, with carrot butter on them, and gnawed on a bit of potato. Just as he was almost through, he heard a rustling in the bushes, and a voice exclaimed:  \"Oh, dear!\"  \"Why, what's the matter?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, thinking perhaps an adventure was going to happen to him. \"Who are you?\"  \"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed the voice again.  Then, before the old rabbit could jump up and run away, even if he had wanted to, out from under a big bush came a little white poodle dog, with curly, silky hair. He walked right up to Uncle Wiggily, that dog did, and the rabbit wasn't a bit afraid, for the dog wasn't much bigger than he was, and looked very kind.  \"What do you want, doggie?\" gently asked Uncle Wiggily.  The dog didn't answer, but he gave a little short bark, and then he began turning somersaults. Over and over he went, sometimes backward and sometimes frontward, and sometimes sideways. And when he was finished, he made a low bow, and walked around on his two hind legs, just to show he wasn't proud or stuck up.  \"There!\" exclaimed the poodle doggie. \"Is that worth something to eat, Mr. Rabbit?\"  \"Indeed it is,\" answered Uncle Wiggily, \"but I would have given you something to eat without you doing all those tricks, though I enjoyed them very much. Where did you learn to do them?\"  \"Oh, in the circus where I used to be, I always had to do tricks for my dinner,\" said the doggie.  \"What is your name?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.  \"Fido Flip-Flop,\" was the answer. \"You see they call me that because I turn so many flip-flops,\" and then Uncle Wiggily gave him some lunch, and told the dog about how he, himself, was traveling all over in search of his fortune.  \"Why, that's just what I'm doing, too,\" exclaimed Fido Flip-Flop. \"Suppose we travel together? and maybe we'll each find a fortune.\"  \"That's just what we'll do,\" agreed Uncle Wiggily.  And then, all of a sudden, before you could open your eyes and shut them again, two savage foxes jumped out from behind a big stump.  \"You grab the dog and I'll grab the rabbit,\" called the biggest fox, and right at Uncle Wiggily and Fido they sprang, gnashing their teeth.  But don't worry. I'll find a way to save them, and if the canary bird doesn't take my lead pencil and stick it in his seed dish I'll tell you in the following story about Uncle Wiggily doing some tricks.     STORY V  UNCLE WIGGILY DOES SOME TRICKS   When those two savage ducks--oh, I mean foxes--when those two savage foxes jumped out of the bushes at Uncle Wiggily Longears and Fido Flip-Flop, as I told you in the other story, the rabbit and the poodle doggie didn't know what in the world to do.  \"Run this way!\" called Fido, starting off to the left.  \"No, hop this way!\" said Uncle Wiggily, hopping to the right.  \"Stand right where you are!\" ordered the two foxes together. And with that one made a grab for Uncle Wiggily. But what did that brave rabbit gentleman do but stick his red-white-and-blue crutch out in front of him, and the fox bit on that instead of on Uncle Wiggily. Right into the crutch the fox's teeth sank, and for a moment Uncle Wiggily was safe. But not for long.  \"Ah, you fooled me "]]]
