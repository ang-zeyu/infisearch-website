The savage and barbarian are scarcely conscious of the \"I.\" They are but a little above the animal in point of consciousness, and their \"I\" is almost entirely a matter of the consciousness of the wants of the body; the satisfaction of the appetites; the gratification of the passions; the securing of personal comfort; the expression of lust, savage power, etc. In the savage the lower part of the Instinctive Mind is the seat of the \"I.\" (See \"Fourteen Lessons\" for explanation of the several mental planes of man.) If the savage could analyze his thoughts he would say that the \"I\" was the physical body, the said body having certain \"feelings,\" \"wants\" and \"desires.\" The \"I\" of such a man is a physical \"I,\" the body representing its form and substance. Not only is this true of the savage, but even among so-called \"civilized\" men of to-day we find many in this stage. They have developed powers of thinking and reasoning, but they do not \"live in their minds\" as do some of their brothers. They use their thinking powers for the gratification of their bodily desires and cravings, and really live on the plane of the Instinctive Mind. Such a person may speak of \"my mind,\" or \"my soul,\" not from a high position where he looks upon these things from the standpoint of a Master who realizes his Real Self, but from below, from the point-of-view of the man who lives on the plane of the Instinctive Mind and who sees above _himself_ the higher attributes. To such people the body is the \"I.\" Their \"I\" is bound up with the senses, and that which comes to them through the senses. Of course, as Man advances in \"culture\" and \"civilization,\" his senses become educated, and are satisfied only with more refined things, while the less cultivated man is perfectly satisfied with the more material and gross sense gratifications. Much that we call \"cultivation\" and \"culture\" is naught but a cultivation of a more refined form of sense gratification, instead of a real advance in consciousness and unfoldment. It is true that the advanced student and Master is possessed of highly developed senses, often far surpassing those of the ordinary man, but in such cases the senses have been cultivated under the mastery of the Will, and are made servants of the Ego instead of things hindering the progress of the soul--they are made servants instead of masters.  As Man advances in the scale, he begins to have a somewhat higher conception of the \"I.\" He begins to use his mind and reason, and he passes on to the Mental Plane--his mind begins to manifest upon the plane of Intellect. He finds that there is something within him that is higher than the body. He finds that his mind seems more _real_ to him than does the physical part of him, and in times of deep thought and study he is able almost to forget the existence of the body.  In this second stage, Man soon becomes perplexed. He finds problems that demand an answer, but as soon as he thinks he has answered them the problems present themselves in a new phase, and he is called upon to \"explain his explanation.\" The mind, even although not controlled and directed by the Will, has a wonderful range, but, nevertheless, Man finds himself traveling around and around in a circle, and realizes that he is confronted continually by the Unknown. This disturbs him, and the higher the stage of \"book learning\" he attains, the more disturbed does he become. The man of but little knowledge does not see the existence of many problems that force themselves before the attention of the man of more knowledge, and demand an explanation from him. The tortures of the man who has attained the mental growth that enables him to see the new problems and the impossibility of their answer, cannot be imagined by one who has not advanced to that stage.  The man in this stage of consciousness thinks of his \"I\" as a mental thing, having a lower companion, the body. He feels that he has advanced, but yet his \"I\" does not give him the answer to the riddles and questions that perplex him. And he becomes most unhappy. Such men often develop into Pessimists, and consider the whole of life as utterly evil and disappointing--a curse rather than a blessing. Pessimism belongs to this plane, for neither the Physical Plane man or the Spiritual Plane man have this curse of Pessimism. The former man has no such disquieting thoughts, for he is almost entirely absorbed in gratifying his animal nature, while the latter man recognizes his mind as an instrument of himself, rather than as _himself_, and knows it to be imperfect in its present stage of growth. He knows that he has in himself the key to all knowledge--locked up in the Ego--and which the trained mind, cultivated, developed and guided by the awakened Will, may grasp as it unfolds. Knowing this the advanced man no longer despairs, and, recognizing his real nature, and his possibilities, as he awakens into a consciousness of his powers and capabilities, he laughs at the old despondent, pessimistic ideas, and discards them like a worn-out garment. Man on the Mental Plane of consciousness is like a huge elephant who knows not his own strength. He could break down barriers and assert himself over nearly any condition or environment, but in his ignorance of his real condition and power he may be mastered by a puny driver, or frightened by the rustling of a piece of paper.  When the Candidate becomes an Initiate--when he passes from the purely Mental Plane on to the Spiritual Plane--he realizes that the \"I,\" the Real Self--is something higher than either body or mind, and that both of the latter may be used as tools and instruments by the Ego or \"I.\" This knowledge is not reached by purely intellectual reasoning, although such efforts of the mind are often necessary to help in the unfoldment, and the Masters so use it. The real knowledge, however, comes as a special form of consciousness. The Candidate becomes \"aware\" of the real \"I,\" and this consciousness being attained, he passes to the rank of the Initiates. When the Initiate passes the second degree of consciousness, and begins to grow into a realization of his relationship to the Whole--when he begins to manifest the Expansion of Self--then is he on the road to Mastership.  In the present lesson we shall endeavor to point out to the Candidate the methods of developing or increasing the realization of this \"I\" consciousness--this first degree work. We give the following exercises or development drills for the Candidate to practice. He will find that a careful and conscientious following of these directions will tend to unfold in him a sufficient degree of the \"I\" consciousness, to enable him to enter into higher stages of development and power. All that is necessary is for the Candidate to feel within himself the dawn of the awakening consciousness, or awareness of the Real Self. The higher stages of the \"I\" consciousness come gradually, for once on the Path there is no retrogression or going backward. There may be pauses on the journey, but there is no such thing as actually losing that which is once gained on The Path.  This \"I\" consciousness, even in its highest stages, is but a preliminary step toward what is called \"Illumination,\" and which signifies the awakening of the Initiate to a realization of his actual connection with and relation to the Whole. The full sight of the glory of the \"I,\" is but a faint reflected glow of \"Illumination.\" The Candidate, once that he enters fully into the \"I\" consciousness, becomes an \"Initiate.\" And the Initiate who enters into the dawn of Illumination takes his first step upon the road to Mastery. The Initiation is the awakening of the soul to a knowledge of its real existence--the Illumination is the revelation of the real nature of the soul, and of its relationship with the Whole. After the first dawn of the \"I\" consciousness has been attained, the Candidate is more able to grasp the means of developing the consciousness to a still higher degree--is more able to use the powers latent within him; to control his own mental states; to manifest a Centre of Consciousness and Influence that will radiate into the outer world which is always striving and hunting for such centres around which it may revolve.  Man must master himself before he can hope to exert an influence beyond himself. There is no royal road to unfoldment and power--each step must be taken in turn, and each Candidate must take the step himself, and by his own effort. But he may, and will, be aided by the helping hand of the teachers who have traveled The Path before him, and who know just when that helping hand is needed to lift the Candidate over the rough places.  We bid the Candidate to pay strict attention to the following instruction, as it is all important. Do not slight any part of it, for we are giving you only what is necessary, and are stating it as briefly as possible. Pay attention, and follow the instruction closely. This lesson must be mastered before you progress. And it must be practiced not only now, but at many stages of the journey, until full Initiation and Illumination is yours.   RULES AND EXERCISES DESIGNED TO AID THE CANDIDATE IN HIS INITIATION.  The first instruction along the line of Initiation is designed to awaken the mind to a full realization and consciousness of the individuality of the \"I.\" The Candidate is taught to relax his body, and to calm his mind and to meditate upon the \"I\" until it is presented clearly and sharply before the consciousness. We herewith give directions for producing the desired physical and mental condition, in which meditation and concentration are more readily practiced. This state of Meditation will be referred to in subsequent exercises, so the Candidate is advised to acquaint himself thoroughly with it.  STATE OF MEDITATION. If possible, retire to a quiet place "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13656"],["title","A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga (#2)"],["body","room, where you do not fear interruption, so that your mind may feel secure and at rest. Of course, the ideal condition cannot always be obtained, in which case you must do the best you can. The idea is that you should be able to abstract yourself, so far as is possible, from distracting impressions, and you should be alone with yourself--in communion with your Real Self.  It is well to place yourself in an easy chair, or on a couch, so that you may relax the muscles and free the tension of your nerves. You should be able to \"let go\" all over, allowing every muscle to become limp, until a feeling of perfect peace and restful calm permeates every particle of your being. Rest the body and calm the mind. This condition is best in the earlier stages of the practice, although after the Candidate has acquired a degree of mastery he will be able to obtain the physical relaxation and mental calm whenever and wherever he desires.  But he must guard against acquiring a \"dreamy\" way of going around, wrapped in meditation when he should be attending to the affairs of life. _Remember this_, the State of Meditation should be entirely under the control of the Will, and should be entered into only deliberately and at the proper times. The Will must be master of this, as well as of every other mental state. The Initiates are not \"day dreamers,\" but men and women having full control of themselves and their moods. The \"I\" consciousness while developed by meditation and consciousness, soon becomes a fixed item of consciousness, and does not have to be produced by meditation. In time of trial, doubt, or trouble, the consciousness may be brightened by an effort of the Will (as we shall explain in subsequent lessons) without going into the State of Meditation.  THE REALIZATION OF THE \"I.\" The Candidate must first acquaint himself with the reality of the \"I,\" before he will be able to learn its real nature. This is the first step. Let the Candidate place himself in the State of Meditation, as heretofore described. Then let him concentrate his entire attention upon his Individual Self, shutting out all thought of the outside world, and other persons. Let him form in his mind the idea of himself as a _real_ thing--an actual being--an individual entity--a Sun around which revolves the world. He must see himself as the Centre around which the whole world revolves. Let not a false modesty, or sense of depreciation interfere with this idea, for you are not denying the right of others to also consider themselves centres. You are, in fact, a centre of consciousness--made so by the Absolute--and you are awakening to the fact. Until the Ego recognizes itself as a Centre of Thought, Influence and Power, it will not be able to _manifest_ these qualities. And in proportion as it recognizes its position as a centre, so will it be able to manifest its qualities. It is not necessary that you should compare yourself with others, or imagine yourself greater or higher than them. In fact, such comparisons are to be regretted, and are unworthy of the advanced Ego, being a mark and indication of a lack of development, rather than the reverse. In the Meditation simply ignore all consideration of the respective qualities of others, and endeavor to realize the fact that YOU are a great Centre of Consciousness--a Centre of Power--a Centre of Influence--a Centre of Thought. And that like the planets circling around the sun, so does your world revolve around YOU who are its centre. It will not be necessary for you to argue out this matter, or to convince yourself of its truth by intellectual reasoning. The knowledge does not come in that way. It comes in the shape of a realization of the truth gradually dawning upon your consciousness through meditation and concentration. Carry this thought of yourself as a \"Centre of Consciousness--Influence--Power\" with you, _for it is an occult truth,_ and in the proportion that you are able, to realize it so will be your ability to manifest the qualities named.  No matter how humble may be your position--no matter how hard may be your lot--no matter how deficient in educational advantages you may be--still you would not change your \"I\" with the most fortunate, wisest and highest man or woman in the world. You may doubt this, but think for a moment and you will see that we are right. When you say that you \"would like to be\" this person or that, you really mean that _you_ would like to have their degree of intelligence, power, wealth, position, or what not. What you want is something that is theirs, or something akin to it. But you would not for a moment wish to merge your _identity_ with theirs, or to exchange _selves_. Think of this for a moment To _be_ the other person you would have to let _yourself_ die, and instead of _yourself_ you would be the other person. The real _you_ would be wiped out of existence, and you would not be _you_ at all, but would be _he_.  If you can but grasp this idea you will see that not for a moment would you be willing for such an exchange. Of course such an exchange is impossible. The \"I\" of you cannot be wiped out. It is eternal, and will go on, and on, and on, to higher and higher states--but it always will be the same \"I.\" Just as you, although a far different sort of person from your childhood self, still you recognize that the same \"I\" is there, and always has been there. And although you will attain knowledge, experience, power and wisdom in the coming years, the same \"I\" will be there. The \"I\" is the Divine Spark and cannot be extinguished.  The majority of people in the present stage of the race development have but a faint conception of the reality of the \"I.\" They accept the statement of its existence, and are conscious of themselves as an eating, sleeping, living creature--something like a higher form of animal. But they have not awakened to an \"awareness\" or realization of the \"I,\" which must come to all who become real centres of Influence and Power. Some men have stumbled into this consciousness, or a degree of it, without understanding the matter. They have \"felt\" the truth of it, and they have stepped out from the ranks of the commonplace people of the world, and have become powers for good or bad. This is unfortunate to some extent, as this \"awareness\" without the knowledge that should accompany it may bring pain to the individual and others.  The Candidate must meditate upon the \"I,\" and recognize it--_feel_ it--to be a Centre. This is his first task. Impress upon your mind the word \"I,\" in this sense and understanding, and let it sink deep down into your consciousness, so that it will become a part of you. And when you say \"I,\" you must accompany the word with the picture of your Ego as a Centre of Consciousness, and Thought, and Power, and Influence. See yourself thus, surrounded by your world. Wherever you go, there goes the Centre of your world. YOU are the Centre, and all outside of you revolves around that Centre. This is the first great lesson on the road to Initiation. Learn it!  The Yogi Masters teach the Candidates that their realization of the \"I\" as a Centre may be hastened by going into the Silence, or State of Meditation, and repeating their first name over slowly, deliberately and solemnly a number of times. This exercise tends to cause the mind to centre upon the \"I,\" and many cases of dawning Initiation have resulted from this practice. Many original thinkers have stumbled upon this method, without having been taught it. A noted example is that of Lord Tennyson, who has written that he attained a degree of Initiation in this way. He would repeat his own name, over and over, and the same time meditating upon his identity, and he reports that he would become conscious and \"aware\" of his reality and immortality--in short would recognize himself as a _real_ center of consciousness.  We think we have given you the key to the first stage of meditation and concentration. Before passing on, let us quote from one of the old Hindu Masters. He says, regarding this matter: \"When the soul sees itself as a Centre surrounded by its circumference--when the Sun knows that it is a Sun, and is surrounded by its whirling planets--then is it ready for the Wisdom and Power of the Masters.\"  THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE \"I\" FROM THE BODY. Many of the Candidates find themselves prevented from a full realization of the \"I\" (even after they have begun to grasp it) by the confusing of the reality of the \"I\" with the sense of the physical body. This is a stumbling block that is easily overcome by meditation and concentration, the independence of the \"I\" often becoming manifest to the Candidate in a flash, upon the proper thought being used as the subject of meditation.  The exercise is given as follows: Place yourself in the State of Meditation, and think of YOURSELF--the Real \"I\"--as being independent of the body, but using the body as a covering and an instrument. Think of the body as you might of a suit of clothes. Realize that you are able to leave the body, and still be the same \"I.\" Picture yourself as doing this, and looking down upon your body. Think of the body as a shell from which you may emerge without affecting your identity. Think of yourself as mastering and controlling the body that you occupy, and using it to the best advantage, making it healthy, strong and vigorous, but still being merely a shell or covering for the real \"You.\" Think of the body as composed of atoms and cells which are constantly changing, but which are held together by the force of your Ego, and which you can improve at Will. Realize that you are merely inhabiting the body, and using it for your convenience, just as you might use a house.  In meditating further, ignore the body entirely, and place your thought upon the Real \"I\" that you are beginning to feel to be \"you,\" and you will find that your identity--your \"I\"--is something entirely apart from the body. You may now say \"my"]]]
