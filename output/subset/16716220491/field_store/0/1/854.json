I tell you, I could hardly hold him.  Nurse Mary, _says_ POLLY, won't you sing us \"The Carol of the Friendly Beasts\" now?  In my old cracked voice? _says_ NURSE MARY. Well, if you will both help me, I'll try.  _So the three of them together sing_:   THE CAROL OF THE FRIENDLY BEASTS[1]    Jesus our brother, strong and good,   Was humbly born in a stable rude,   And the friendly beasts around him stood.    I, said the cow, all white and red,   I gave him my manger for his bed,   I gave him my hay to pillow his head.    I, said the camel, yellow and black,   Over the desert, upon my back,   I brought him a gift in the wise man's pack.    I, said the donkey, shaggy and brown,   I carried his mother uphill and down,   I carried her safely to Bethlehem town.    I, said the sheep, with the curly horn,   I gave him my wool for his blanket warm,   He wore my coat on Christmas morn.    I, said the dove, from my rafter high,   Cooed him to sleep that he should not cry,   We cooed him to sleep my mate and I.    And every beast, by some good spell   In the stable dark, was glad to tell   Of the gift he gave Immanuel.   [Footnote 1: By Robert Davis.]   _When the carol is finished_, NURSE MARY _looks at the clock, and says_, My dears, it is time we were all in bed, or Santa Claus when he comes, will find us awake, and that would never do. So I must be going home.  But how do you feel? _asks_ POLLY. Has the medicine done your back good?  My back? _says_ NURSE MARY. Why, I had forgotten all about my back--not an ache in it.  And your joints? _asks_ JACK.  I wouldn't know I had any joints, _answers_ NURSE MARY. I declare, I believe I could dance the Highland Fling. But where is my cloak?  _Then Polly gets the cloak and hood, and helps her put them on, and as Nurse Mary goes out at the door_,  Good-night, Nurse Mary, _cry_ JACK _and_ POLLY.  Good-night, my dears, NURSE MARY _answers. And the door closes behind her_.  _Now while the children had their backs turned, a funny thing happened, for out of the fire-place there stepped, without making a sound, a little man dressed all in green. Jack and Polly, when they turn about, see him standing there._  Why, who are you? _asks_ JACK, _standing still, but very bravely keeping in front of Polly._  _The little green man says never a word, but after waiting a moment with his finger on his lips, he beckons to them to come forward, and slowly, for they are a little frightened, they obey him. When they are quite close, he looks cautiously around, and then draws a large white letter out of his pocket, and hands it to Jack. Jack looks at it, and shows it to Polly. Then he looks at the little green man, who nods his head with a funny little jerk._  Shall I open it? _asks_ JACK. _And the little green man nods again. So Jack opens it._  Shall I read it? _asks_ JACK. _And the little green man nods again. So Jacks begins to read:_ \"My dear Children all over the world, I, who write you this letter, am your old friend Santa Claus, and how shall I tell you the sad news, for tonight is the night when I ought to get into my reindeer sleigh and go about filling your precious stockings with Christmas gifts, and I cannot do it because I am sick. My back aches like a tooth ache, and every joint in my whole body is so stiff that I can hardly move. Old Father Time, who pretends to be something of a doctor, says the trouble is that I am growing old--the idea of it! I sent him packing about his business, I can tell you. But all the same I do feel mighty queer, and that's a fact. And the worst of it is that this is Christmas Eve, and here I am shut up indoors in my house at the North Pole, and every stocking in the world is hanging empty. I cannot bear to have Christmas come and go without any word at all from me, so I have gotten my good little friends the gnomes and fairies and elves to help me out. They had some old fairy toys, that are almost as good as new, and these they are going to carry about to all the children; and although these gifts are rather different from what you usually receive from me, I hope they will at least keep you from forgetting poor old Santa Claus.\"  _Jack and Polly look sadly at one another, and then at the little green man. He reaches out his hand, takes the letter, folds it up, replaces it in the envelope, and tucks it away in his pocket. Then he brings out two little packages, all in green paper, tied with green string, and gives one to Polly and one to Jack. Then, quick as a flash, he has disappeared in the fire-place._  Where did he go to? _asks_ POLLY, _after a moment of surprise._  Up the chimney, _says_ JACK.  But what has he given to us? _says_ POLLY, _looking at the little green package in her hand._  Let's open them, _says_ JACK.  _So the two children untie the strings, and open the papers, and soon hold up the things they have found inside. Jack has a pair of spectacles with large round glasses and black rims. Polly has a curious little brown cap. They look at them in perplexity._  Oh, there is some writing fastened to mine, _says_ POLLY.  And to mine, too, _adds_ JACK.  POLLY _reads:_    \"A fairy wishing-cap am I;   So put me on, and away you fly.   Wherever you wish, 'tis there you'll be,   And quicker than saying three-times-three.\"   _Polly puts the cap on her head. Then_ JACK _reads_:    \"Fairy spectacles are we;   Put us on, and you shall see   Things you never saw before,   Easy as saying four-times-four.\"   _Jack puts the spectacles on his nose, and begins to go about the room looking at everything through them_.  Oh, Polly, _he exclaims_, I can see all sorts of queer things. I can see what is in the table drawer without opening it, and I can see the pictures in the books right through the covers. And oh, Polly, look here. _He is looking into the fire-place, when he says this_. I can see now how the little green man went up the chimney, for there are steps in the side, all the way up. Look at them.  POLLY _looks. Then she says_, I don't see any steps, Jack.  It's the fairy spectacles, Polly, _cries_ JACK. Isn't it wonderful?  Jack! _says_ POLLY _suddenly_, do you know what we must do? We must go to Santa Claus, and carry him the medicine that cured Nurse Mary's back and joints. You will go first up the chimney, and I will go after, stepping just where I see you step, and then at the top I will take tight hold of your hand, and with my wishing cap on I will wish to be at Santa Claus' house at the North Pole.  Splendid! Let's start this minute, _cries_ JACK.  _Polly takes the spoon, and Jack takes the medicine bottle, and one after the other they go up the chimney._  _A moment later_ MOTHER _comes in._ Children, _she begins, looking about; but then she continues_, Oh, I see: they have gone to bed. _She goes across to the other door and listens. Then she says_: Not a sound! They are fast asleep already.  _So she takes the lamp from the table, and carries it out with her, leaving the room all in black darkness._  _And that is the end of the First Scene._         *       *       *       *       *     Interlude   _While the curtain is closed_, MOTHER GOOSE _comes out, and this is what she says:_  Children, did you see Jack and Polly go up that chimney? Well, as soon as they got to the top, Polly took fast hold of Jack's hand and wished to be at the North Pole, and away they went flying through the air. They have gotten there already, I think. Hark! Yes, they are just going in at the gate that leads up to Santa Claus's house, and soon they will be knocking at his door. Then you will see them come in, for you will be there before they are; and when the curtain opens, as it will in just a moment, you will see the inside of the house where Santa Claus lives. You must be very quiet for Santa Claus is sick, remember, and a noise might make his head ache. Hush! It is going to begin.         *       *       *       *       *     The Second Scene   _When the Curtain opens, you again see a room, but quite different from the first one. There is a door on one side, and at the back is a sort of tall box with closed doors in the front of it, a kind of cupboard. On shelves at the sides of the room are some toys and packages, and a bag, nearly full, leans against the wall. There are two people in the room. One of them, of course, is Santa Claus, but oh, how sick he looks. The other person is a woman, you will see, and she must be Mrs. Santa Claus. There are two other figures that look a good deal like people, but they are only big toys that Santa Claus and his wife have been making, a soldier on one side, and a doll on the other._  SANTA CLAUS, _who is sitting, wrapped up in a great blanket wrapper, and is leaning his head on his hand, while he holds a cane in the other is saying_, What is the use of working any longer, for if I can't carry the presents to the children, what is the good of finishing them?  But you might feel better at the last moment, _says_ MRS. SANTA CLAUS, _who is tieing a sash on the big doll that stands beside her._  That's true, _says_ SANTA CLAUS. Well, I believe I'll finish this soldier, then. He's the last one I need to make, and he's all done except to have his cheeks painted. I'll get my paint out and finish him.  _So Santa Claus rises up very stiffly and painfully, and hobbles across the room to get his paint and paintbrush. Then he sits down again in front of the big toy soldier, and paints both its cheeks a fine bright red. Just as he is finishing, there comes a knock at the door._  Come in, _says_ MRS. SANTA CLAUS. _And in walk Jack and Polly, hand in hand, wearing the fairy spectacles and the wishing cap, one holding the bottle and the other the spoon._  Donner and Blitzen! _exclaims_ SANTA CLAUS, _laying down his brush,_ if it isn't Polly and Jack!  Oh, Santa,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14786"],["title","Up the Chimney (#2)"],["body","POLLY, we got your letter and the wishing-cap--  And the fairy spectacles, says JACK.  And we've brought you some of father's medicine, _continues_ POLLY, because it made Nurse Mary quite well--her back, you know.  And her joints, _adds_ JACK.  And you have to take it from children, POLLY _goes on._ One of them holds the spoon--_Here_ POLLY _holds out the spoon._  And the other pours out the medicine, _says_ JACK, _and with that he pours it out._ It's very bitter, _he adds, as Polly holds it out for Santa Claus to take._  _Then Santa Claus opens his mouth, and swallows the dose, with a wry face and a shudder._  Is it horrid? _asks_ POLLY.  Horrid! _says_ SANTA CLAUS.  But it will make you well, you know, _says_ POLLY _encouragingly._ Only you have to wait a little for the medicine to work.  And you came all the way to the North Pole, to bring me this medicine? _says_ SANTA CLAUS, _looking from Polly to Jack and back to Polly again_. How did you get here?  First, we went up the chimney, _says_ JACK, I saw the steps with the fairy spectacles, you know.  And then, _says_ POLLY, I held fast hold of his hand, and wished. I had the wishing-cap, you see.  But weren't you afraid? _asks_ SANTA CLAUS. When you climbed up the black chimney, and when you stood on the top, in the black night under the stars, and when you came flying through the air, weren't you frightened?  Well, it wasn't much fun, _says_ POLLY, but we didn't know how else to get here.  And we knew you were sick, _says_ JACK.  But, _asks_ SANTA CLAUS, what difference did it make to you children whether an old man like me was sick or not?  Why, Santa Claus, _answers_ POLLY, we all just love you, you know.  Well, well, _says_ SANTA CLAUS. _Then he lays down his cane on the floor, and stretches himself, and stands up, and walks across the room without hobbling at all._  How do you feel now? _asks_ JACK.  Feel? _answers_ SANTA CLAUS, _moving more and more briskly_. I feel as young as a snow flake; I feel as strong as a northeast blizzard. Quick, Mrs. Santa Claus, bring me my fur cap and gloves. There's time yet to fill the children's stockings.  _While Mrs. Santa Claus is out of the room_, JACK _says_: Santa, I didn't even know there was a Mrs. Santa Claus.  Have you ever been very sick? _asks_ SANTA CLAUS.  We've had chicken pox, _answers_ JACK.  Oh, that doesn't count, _says_ SANTA CLAUS, but some times, when children are very sick indeed--or, for days and days--and when they are very good and patient, and take their medicine, and never kick the bed clothes off, then Mrs. Santa Claus comes in the night, and brings them a present, and when they wake up, they find it beside the bed.  Oh, _says_ POLLY, I think she must be almost as good as you, Santa Claus.  And besides that, _says_ SANTA CLAUS, who do you suppose dresses all the dolls that I put into the stockings? She does, of course. Look here at this fine one that she has just finished. To be sure, I make the doll part myself, and this one here is a very fine one, if I do say it: it can talk. Would you like to hear it, Polly? Just pull that string there.  _Polly pulls the string and the_ DOLL, _in a very squeaky voice, says_, Ma-ma.  And, by the way, SANTA CLAUS _goes on_, I must put this doll and that soldier into the shrinking-machine.  Why, what is that, Santa Claus? _asks_ JACK.  The shrinking-machine? _says_ SANTA CLAUS. That is it, over there. _He points to the tall cupboardy thing at the back. Then he goes on_. You see it's easier to make toys big, but I couldn't carry them that way, for the sleigh wouldn't hold them, and besides they wouldn't go into the stockings. So after they are made, I put them into the machine, and shrink them. Open the doors, Polly, and we will shrink these two.  _So Polly opens the doors, and at a signal from Santa Claus the doll and the soldier walk in; but they move in a funny stiff way, because they haven't any joints at their knees or elbows._  _Then_ SANTA CLAUS _shuts the doors_. Jack, _say he,_ you may turn the crank, if you want. _So Jack turns the crank._  _After a little_ SANTA CLAUS _says_: Stop! _Then he opens the door and out walk, in the same funny stiff way, the doll and the soldier, only now they are about half as big as they were before. They walk down to the front._ SANTA CLAUS _looks at them, shakes his head, and says,_ No, you must be much smaller than that. Go back into the machine.  _So back the doll and soldier go; and Jack again turns the crank and this time, when_ SANTA CLAUS _cries,_ Stop, _and the doors are opened, the toys have grown very small indeed, as you can see, when Santa Claus holds them up. He puts the soldier into a box, and then puts the box and the doll into his bag._  _And now Mrs. Santa Claus comes in with the cap and gloves; and Santa Claus puts them on. At the same time sleighbells are heard outside, and a stamping of hoofs._  We're off! _cries_ SANTA CLAUS, _taking up his pack._ Come, Polly! Come, Jack! I'll stow you away as warm as toast down under the buffalo robe.  Good-bye, _cries_ MRS. SANTA CLAUS as _they go out at the door._  Good-bye, good-bye, _they_ ALL _call back._  _Then there is more stamping of hoofs outside, and a great jingling of sleighbells, which grow fainter and fainter, as they drive away._  _And that is the end of the Second Scene._         *       *       *       *       *     Interlude   _Again while the curtain is closed_ MOTHER GOOSE _comes out, and this is what she says:_  My dears, we must hurry back to the house where Jack and Polly live, for Santa Claus's sleigh is going so fast through the sky, that it will be there before us, unless we are quick about it. It is still dark night there, and nothing has happened since we were there before, except that Dr. John has come home from seeing sick old Mrs. Cavendish, and he has let himself in with his key, and has felt his way in the dark to his own door, and has gone to bed. He and Mother are both fast asleep, and they haven't an idea but that Jack and Polly are fast asleep in their beds too. But you and I know that they are in the reindeer sleigh with Santa Claus. And all the time they are coming nearer and nearer. Listen for the sleighbells, for now it is going to begin.         *       *       *       *       *     The Third Scene   _When the curtain opens you can see nothing at all at first, for the room is all dark, just as Mother left it, you remember, when she went out and took the light with her. But after a moment you can hear something--the sleighbells far away. Nearer and nearer they come; then there is a stamping sound on the roof; then a sort of scrambling sound in the place where you know the chimney is; and then Santa Claus, who by this time is crouching down in the fire-place, turns the light of his lantern into the room. He steps out carrying his pack, and then down the chimney come Jack and Polly._  Hush! _says_ SANTA CLAUS, _with his finger at his lips._ Off to bed with you both! And don't you dare to open your eyes until the day-light comes. It won't be long.  _On tiptoes Polly and Jack go out at the door. Then Santa Claus turns to his work. First he reads Polly's letter by the light of his lantern, and fills Polly's stocking and Mother's; then he reads Jack's letter and fills Jack's stocking and Father's; then he puts out the light so that the room is all dark again. You hear him climbing up the chimney, then there is a jingling of sleighbells on the roof, which grows fainter and fainter, and then all is still once more._  _After a little while you notice that you can see faintly through the window at the back, because it is beginning to be daylight. Very, very slowly it grows brighter. Then the door, that Jack and Polly went out by, opens, and in come the two children in their wrappers._  Is it daylight now? _asks_ JACK, _but he is looking toward the fire-place instead of toward the window._  Yes, I think it is, _says_ POLLY, _and she is looking in the same direction._  _Then they go on tiptoe to the door of the other room, where Father and Mother sleep; they open the door and shout:_  Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!  _Two rather sleepy voices, from_ MOTHER _first and then from_ FATHER, _answer:_ Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. _And_ MOTHER _continues,_ All right, children; we'll be there in a moment, as soon as we have put our wrappers on.  _The children go over to the fire-place, and feel the lumpy stockings; and then in come Father and Mother in wrappers and nightcaps._  Oh, _says_ FATHER, old Santa Claus hasn't forgotten us, has he? And candy canes are still in fashion, I see; I'm glad of that. Bring Mother her stocking, Polly; and Jack, get mine for me. We'll sit down and take our time about it.  No fair, Jack, _cries_ POLLY. You're peeking into your stocking. I've only felt of mine.  But my thing is in a box, _says_ JACK, so that I can't see anything anyway. Oh, let's begin quick.  All right, _says_ FATHER, and ladies first. Mother, you lead off.  Shall I? _says_ MOTHER, _feeling her stocking_. Oh, I know what this round thing is: it's an orange. No, it isn't either: it's a ball of knitting cotton. Just what I want, and the very kind I use. Now, Polly, it's your turn to see what is in the top of yours.  I'm sure I know what mine is, _says_ POLLY, _and then as she draws it out._ Yes, it is: it's a doll.  Why, Polly, _cries_ JACK, it's the very same doll that we--  Hush! _says_ POLLY _quickly_. Yes, it's the very same kind of a doll I asked for. See, Mother, she has a pink sash. Isn't she lovely?  Now, Jack, _says_ FATHER, I think it is your turn next. What is in that box of yours? Slate pencils, probably.  Slate pencils! _says_ JACK, _indignantly_. You know I didn't want slate pencils.  But are you sure you will get just what you want? _asks_ FATHER.  Yes, indeed I am, _answers_ JACK, _pulling out the box and opening it_, and there it is--a soldier. I knew it would be that, because I saw it when--  Hush! _says_ POLLY"]]]
