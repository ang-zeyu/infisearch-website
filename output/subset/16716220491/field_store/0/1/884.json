I'll never do it again,\" Max said in a broken voice.  The captain sighed deeply. \"Max,\" he said, \"dearly as I love my only son, I would sooner lay him under the sod, knowing that his soul was in heaven, than have him live to be a profane swearer. Bring me that Bible from the table yonder.\"  The boy obeyed.  \"Now turn to the twenty-fourth chapter of Leviticus, and read the sixteenth verse.\"  Max read in a trembling voice, \"'And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him; as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.'\"  \"Now the twenty-third,\" said his father.  \"'And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones; and the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses.'\"  Max had some difficulty in finishing the verse, and at the end quite broke down.  \"Papa,\" he sobbed, \"I didn't know that was in the Bible. I never thought about its being so dreadfully wicked to say bad words.\"  \"What do you now think a boy deserves who has done it again and again? say as often as Max Raymond has?\" asked his father.  \"I suppose to be stoned to death like that man. But nobody is ever put to death for swearing nowadays?\" the boy said, half inquiringly, not daring to look at his father as he spoke.  \"No, Max, fortunately for you and many others. But suppose you were my father and I a boy of your age, and that I had been swearing, what would you think you ought to do about it?\"  \"Give you a sound flogging,\" he answered, in a low, reluctant tone.  \"Well, Max, that is just what I shall have to do, if I ever know you to use a profane word again,\" said his father, in a grave, sad tone. \"I should do it now, but for the hope that you are sorry enough for the past to carefully avoid that sin in the future.\"  \"Indeed I will, papa,\" he said, very humbly.  \"And, Max,\" resumed his father, \"you are never to make a companion of, or go at all with anybody who uses such language, and never to read a book or story that has in it anything of that kind. And you are not to say by George or by anything. Our Saviour says, 'Let your communication be Yea, yea, Nay, nay, for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.' My son, have you asked God to forgive you for taking His holy name in vain?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Then go at once to your room and do it.\"  \"I did, papa,\" Max said, when he came down again to find his father waiting for him.  \"I trust the petition came from your heart, my son,\" was the grave but kind rejoinder. \"I must have a little more talk with you on this subject, but not now, for it is time we followed the others into the next house, if we would not keep Grandma Rose's tea waiting.\"     CHAPTER III.      \"A kingdom is a nest of families, and a family is a small     kingdom.\"--Tupper.   It was a bright and cheerful scene that greeted the eyes of Captain Raymond and his son as they entered the parlor of the adjacent cottage.  It was strictly a family gathering, yet the room was quite full. Mr. Dinsmore was there with his wife, his daughter Elsie and her children, Edward and Zoe, Elsie Leland with her husband and babe, Violet Raymond with her husband's two little girls, Lulu and Grace, and lastly Rosie and Walter.  Everybody had a kindly greeting for the captain, and Violet's bright face grew still brighter as she made room for him on the sofa by her side.  \"We were beginning to wonder what was keeping you,\" she said.  \"Yes, I'm afraid I am rather behind time,\" he returned. \"I hope you have not delayed your tea for me, Mrs. Dinsmore.\"  \"No; it is but just ready,\" she said. \"Ah, there's the bell. Please, all of you walk out.\"  When the meal was over all returned to the parlor, where they spent the next hour in desultory chat.  Gracie claimed a seat on her father's knee. Lulu took possession of an ottoman and pushed it up as close to his side as she could; then seating herself on it leaned up against him.  He smiled and stroked her hair, then glanced about the room in search of Max.  The boy was sitting silently in a corner, but reading an invitation in his father's eyes, he rose and came to his other side.  The ladies were talking of the purchases they wished to make in Boston, New York or Philadelphia, on their homeward route.  \"I must get winter hats for Lulu and Gracie,\" said Violet.  \"I want a bird on mine, Mamma Vi,\" said Lulu; \"a pretty one with gay feathers.\"  \"Do you know, Lulu, that they skin the poor little birds alive in order to preserve the brilliancy of their plumage?\" Violet said with a troubled look. \"I will not wear them on that account, and as you are a kind-hearted little girl, I think you will not wish to do so either.\"  \"But I do,\" persisted Lulu. \"Of course I wouldn't have a bird killed on purpose, but after they are killed I might just as well have one.\"  \"But do you not see,\" said Grandma Elsie, \"that if every one would refuse to buy them, the cruel business of killing them would soon cease? and that it will go on as long as people continue to buy and wear them?\"  \"I don't care, I want one,\" pouted Lulu. \"Papa, can't I have it?\"  \"No, you cannot,\" he said with grave displeasure. \"I am sorry to see that you can be so heartless. You can have just whatever Grandma Elsie and Mamma Vi think best for you, and with that you must be content.\"  Lulu was silenced, but for the rest of the evening her face wore an ugly scowl.  \"My little girl is growing sleepy,\" the captain said presently to Gracie. \"Papa will carry you over home and put you to bed. Lulu, you may come too.\"  \"I don't want to, papa, I----\" she began; but he silenced her with a look.  \"Bid good-night to our friends and come,\" he said. \"You also, Max.\"  Max, though surprised at the order, obeyed with cheerful alacrity in strong contrast to Lulu's sullen and reluctant compliance, which said as plainly as words that she would rebel if she dared.  \"I don't see why papa makes us come away so soon,\" she grumbled to her brother in an undertone, as they passed from one cottage to the other, their father a little in advance.  \"He must have some good reason,\" said Max, \"and I for one am willing enough to obey him, seeing it's such a little while I'll have the chance.\"  They had now reached the veranda of their own cottage.  \"Come in quickly out of this cold wind, children,\" their father said; then as he closed the outer door after them, \"Run into the parlor and get thoroughly warm before going up to your rooms.\"  He sat down by the stove with Grace on his knee, and bade the other two draw up close to it and him, one on each side. And when they had done so, \"My three dear children,\" he said in tender tones, glancing from one to another, \"no words can tell how much I love you. Will you all think very often of papa and follow him with your prayers when he is far away on the sea?\"  \"Oh, yes, yes, papa!\" they all said with tears in their eyes, while Gracie put her small arms round his neck. Lulu rested her head on his shoulder, and Max took a hand and pressed it in both of his.  \"Papa, you will think of us, too?\" he said inquiringly.  \"Yes, indeed, my darlings; you will never be long out of my mind, and nothing will make me happier than to hear that you are well and doing your duty faithfully.\"  \"I shall try very hard, papa,\" Max said, with affectionate look and tone, \"if it is only to please you and make your heart glad.\"  \"Thank you, my son,\" his father replied, \"but I hope a still stronger motive will be that you may please God and honor Him. Never forget, my children, that though your earthly father may be far away and know nothing of your conduct, God's all-seeing eye is ever upon you.\"  A half hour had passed very quickly and delightfully to the children, when at length, seeing Gracie's eyelids begin to droop, their father said it was time for him to carry her up to bed.  \"Shall we stay here till you come down again, papa?\" asked Max.  \"No; you and Lulu may go to bed now.\"  \"Then good-night, papa.\"  \"No, you need not bid me good-night yet,\" the captain said. \"I shall see you both in your rooms before you are asleep.\"  \"Well, Lu, are you sorry now that papa made you come home so soon?\" asked Max, as they went up-stairs together.  \"No, indeed! Haven't we had a nice time, Max? Oh, if only we could keep papa all the time!\"  \"I wish we could,\" said Max. \"But we won't have so hard a time as we've had for the last two years whenever he was away.\"  They had reached the door of Lulu's room. \"Max,\" she said, turning to him as with a sudden thought, \"what do you suppose papa is coming to our rooms for?\"  \"What do _you_ suppose? have you done anything you ought to be punished for?\" asked Max, a little mischievously. \"I thought you looked very cross and rebellious about the hat and about having to come home so soon. I'm very sure, from what I've heard of Grandpa Dinsmore's strictness, that if you were his child you'd get a whipping for it.\"  Lulu looked frightened.  \"But, Max, you don't think papa means to punish me for that, do you? He has been so kind and pleasant since,\" she said, with a slight tremble in her voice.  \"You'll find out when he comes,\" laughed Max. \"Good-night,\" and he hastened away to his own room.  A guilty conscience made Lulu very uneasy as she hurried through her preparations for bed, and as she heard her father's step approach the door she grew quite frightened.  He came in and closed it after him. Lulu was standing in her night-dress, just ready for bed. He caught up a heavy shawl, wrapped it about her, and seating himself lifted her to his knee.  \"Why, how you are trembling!\" he exclaimed. \"Wha"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14910"],["title","Elsie at the World's Fair (#1)"],["body"," and papa said there was nothing too good for you, and so we all thought, Maxie,\" said Grace, Lulu adding, \"Indeed we do all think so.\"  \"Indeed, I'm afraid it is,\" returned Max, gazing admiringly at the beautiful carpet, the lace curtains looped back with wreaths of flowers, the fine engravings on the walls, the easy chairs, tasteful mantel ornaments, and the many other articles of adornment and convenience.  \"Your mamma and I have made some changes, improvements, as we thought,\" the captain said in gratified and affectionate tones, \"hoping you would be pleased with then; and I rather think you are.\"  \"Pleased, papa? I'm delighted!\" cried Max. \"The only drawback to my pleasure is the thought of the very short time I can stay to enjoy all this beauty and luxury.\"  \"Yet I am sure my boy does not want to settle down here to a life of inglorious ease,\" remarked the captain in a tone of mingled assertion and enquiry. \"I rejoice in the firm conviction that his great desire is to serve God and his country to the best of his ability.\"  \"Yes, father, it is,\" said Max earnestly. \"But,\" he added with a smile, \"if you don't want me to love to be with you in this sweet home you should not make it so attractive and be so very kind and affectionate to me.\"  \"My boy,\" the captain said with emotion and laying a hand affectionately on his son's shoulder, \"there is never a day when I do not thank my heavenly Father for his gift to me of so good and dutiful a son.\"  \"I don't know how any fellow could help being dutiful and affectionate to such a father as mine, sir,\" returned Max, his eyes shining.  By his own desire Max's vacation was spent at home and in its vicinity, with the occasional variety of a short voyage in his father's yacht, the _Dolphin_, which gave the lad opportunities for the display of the seafaring knowledge gained in the past two years, and adding to it from his father's store of the same, under that father's instruction.  They were generally accompanied by the whole Woodburn family, always by Lulu and Grace, Grandma Elsie, Rose, Walter, and Evelyn Leland.  Thus the weeks flew by very enjoyably and on swift wings, and the time came for Max's return to Annapolis. So the _Dolphin_ was headed for that port and presently steamed away again, leaving the lad behind with a rather sad heart at the thought that years must pass before he could again spend even a brief season under his father's roof.     CHAPTER II.   It is summer again, the summer of 1893, for two years have passed away since the occurrence of the events related in our former chapter. There have been few changes among our friends at Ion, Woodburn, and the other plantations belonging to the family connection, except such as time brings to all. The elder ones seem scarcely any older, but the younger ones are growing up. Elsie's sons, Harold and Herbert, are now practising physicians, still making their home at Ion, but having an office in a neighboring village; Rosie has attained her twentieth year and entered society; but Walter is still one of Captain Raymond's pupils, as are Lulu and Grace, now blooming girls of fifteen and seventeen, their father's joy and pride and as devotedly attached to him as ever.  Max is still a cadet in the Naval Academy, pursuing his course there in a manner altogether satisfactory to his father and friends. The captain thinks no man ever had a brighter, better son than his first-born, or one more likely to do good service to his country in his chosen profession. It seems hard at times, a sad thing to have to do without his boy, yet he never really regrets that Max has made choice of the naval service as his life work. He did, however, regret that Max would not be able to go to Chicago to visit the World's Fair, in which they were all much interested.  Some of the connection had attended the dedication ceremonies of the previous autumn, and nearly all talked of going to the formal opening, appointed for the first of May; among them Grandma Elsie, her father and his wife, Captain Raymond and his wife and family. The captain's plan was to go by water--in his yacht--up along the coast to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, through that up the river of the same name, through the Welland Canal and round Michigan by the great lakes to Chicago, and he invited as many as his vessel could well accommodate--including, of course, his wife's mother and grandparents--to be his guests for the trip.  The younger gentlemen and their wives all preferred going by rail as the speedier way, but Mr. Dinsmore, having no longer any business to attend to, and both he and his wife being fond of the sea and desirous of keeping with his eldest daughter, accepted the invitation promptly and with pleasure.  Mr. Ronald Lilburn, too, having a like taste as to his mode of travel, and no business engagements to hurry him, availed himself of the opportunity to make the journey by water. The other passengers were Evelyn Leland and Rosie and Walter Travilla.  Something, however, occurred to change their plans, and it was the latter part of June when they left home for their trip to the North. They had a pleasant voyage, making few pauses by the way, and reached their destination on Monday, the second day of July.  It was early in the evening when the _Dolphin_ neared the White City; the little ones were already in bed and sweetly sleeping, but all the others had gathered on deck to catch the first glimpse of the fairy-like scene. They had passed the mouth of the Chicago River and were steaming on down the lake.  \"Oh, papa, what is that?\" asked Grace, pointing to a bright light in the water.  \"A lighted buoy,\" he replied; \"a spar buoy with an incandescent lamp of one hundred candle power. It is a wrought-iron cage at the end of a spar which is held in place by a heavy cast-iron anchor. You will see another presently, for there are thirteen between the river and the White City.\"  \"To warn vessels to keep off shoals?\" she asked.  \"Yes,\" he said, and went on to explain how the electrical current was supplied, winding up with a promise to take her, and anyone else who wished to go, to the Electrical Building to gaze upon its wonders, and also for a ride in the electric launches. \"But,\" he added, \"I think there is nothing you will enjoy more than the sight of the electric lights which you will get presently in the Peristyle and the Court of Honor.\"  \"Oh, I am very eager to see it all, papa!\" she exclaimed.  \"As we all are,\" said Lulu.  \"Well, my dears, I think we can all go there at once and spend an hour or two; all but the little ones, who can be left in the care of their nurse.\" He turned enquiringly toward his wife and her mother as he spoke.  \"Oh, yes,\" said Violet; \"they will not be likely to wake, and Agnes will take good care of them.\"  \"I think we are all probably ready to accept your invitation with pleasure, captain,\" Elsie said. \"Surely none of us are fatigued--unless with lack of exercise.\"  \"No, surely not,\" remarked Mr. Dinsmore, \"and I, as well as Grace, am eager to see the beauties of that much talked of Court of Honor.\"  \"I think we will find some other objects worthy of our attention before we reach even the Peristyle,\" remarked Captain Raymond.  \"Oh, yes!\" exclaimed Lulu, \"there is another of those lights.\"  \"I am so glad you brought us in the yacht, captain,\" said Evelyn; \"for we can start out at once to see the sights--not being in the least fatigued with our long journey.\"  \"And we have already a beautiful view of water and sky,\" remarked Grandma Elsie; \"those sunset clouds are certainly lovelier than any work of man's hands.\"  \"Yes, mamma; and they are beautifully reflected in the water,\" said Violet.  \"But such things can be seen at home,\" Rosie remarked in a sprightly tone, \"and I propose to give my particular attention to such as are to be found only in this part of the world and at the present time.\"  \"What will there be worth looking at before we reach the Peristyle?\" asked Walter, apparently addressing his query to no one in particular.  It was Captain Raymond who replied, \"I hope to be able to point out to you presently some exhibits worthy of your attention,\" he said.  \"Oh, yes; the battleship _Illinois_ for one, I suppose.\"  \"Yes; she will come into sight presently and we will have an outside view of her. Some day I hope to take all of you who may desire to go on board to have a look at her internal arrangements.\"  \"You may put my name into that list, captain,\" said Mr. Lilburn. \"I'm a bit too auld to take part in a fight, even in a righteous cause, but not for taking an interest in the means provided for ither folk.\"  \"And I want to see it, too, though I hardly expect to ever make one of the crew of such a vessel,\" said Walter.  \"And we girls will want to visit her also,\" laughed Rosie, \"though I am very sure no one of us will ever form part of such a crew.\"  \"Well, as my father has and my brother expects to, I shall be very much interested,\" said Grace.  \"Especially as we shall have a retired officer to explain everything to us,\" added Lulu with a smiling look up into her father's face.  He returned the smile, then pointing southward, \"Yonder it is,\" he said, \"still too distant for a critical survey, but a better view will be afforded us presently, as we pass it.\"  As he spoke all eyes turned in that direction.  \"Oh, what a big vessel she is!\" exclaimed Grace, as they drew near enough to obtain a good idea of her size.  \"Yes,\" returned the captain, \"she is a full sized model, above water line, of our coast line battleships _Oregon_, _Massachusetts_, _Indiana_.\"  \"Not a real ship, papa?\"  \"No; only a model: she is built of brick, on the bottom of the lake, and merely simulates a man-of-war.\"  \"Only a model!\" repeated Walter. \"And how about her guns, sir? are they real?\"  \"Some of them are wood; but there are enough genuine machines on board to destroy almost anything of ordinary resisting power within three miles range. But I expect to go"]]]
