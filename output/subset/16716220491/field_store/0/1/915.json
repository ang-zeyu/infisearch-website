If you give up I'll tell you.\"  \"I don't give up,\" cried Kitty; \"what color is it?\"  \"Red,\" answered her father.  \"Ho!\" cried Kitty, with a sudden flash of inspiration, \"it's an automobile!\"  \"Right you are, Kitsie,\" said her father, \"though I don't know why you guessed it so quick.\"  \"Well, nothing else is red and big. But why do you call it a pet? And how does it purr?\"  \"You're so practical, Kitty, it's difficult to make you understand; but I feel quite sure we'll all make a pet of it, and when you once hear it purr, you'll think it a prettier sound than any kitten ever made.\"  \"Is it really an automobile, Father? And have you bought it? And shall we ride in it? Where is it? Where are you going to keep it? When will it come? How many will it hold? Where shall we ride first?\"  These queries were flung at Mr. Maynard by the breathless children without waiting for answers, and as Mrs. Maynard came in just then, Mr. Maynard told the story of his new acquisition.  \"I've been looking at them for some time, as you know, Helen,\" he said, looking at his wife, \"and to-day I decided upon the purchase. It's a big touring car, and will comfortably accommodate the whole Maynard family and a chauffeur beside. It will arrive day after to-morrow, that's Monday, and after a few short spins around this neighborhood, I think by Thursday we may be able to start for an Ourday trip in it.\"  \"A whole Ourday in an automobile!\" cried Marjorie; \"how gorgeous and grand! Oh, King, isn't it just splendiferous!\"  Marjorie sprang to her feet, and grasped her brother round the neck, and they flew round the room in a sort of a wild Indian war-dance that went far to express their joy and delight at the prospect.  \"Two Ourdays, you know, Father,\" said Kitty, nestling quietly to her father's side as her madcap brother and sister whirled round the room. But they brought up with a round turn, though a little dishevelled-looking, to hear Mr. Maynard's reply to Kitty's remark.  \"Yes, two Ourdays at once!\" Marjorie cried, affectionately pulling King's hair as she spoke. He returned the caress by pinching her ear, and said, \"Will it be two Ourdays together, Father, or one at a time?\"  \"If you two young tornadoes will sit down quietly for a moment, you may hear of something to your advantage,\" said Mr. Maynard, smiling at his two eldest children who were rather red-faced and breathless from their recent exertions.  \"Sure we will!\" cried King, and drawing Marjorie down with him, they fell in a heap on the floor, and sat there awaiting further disclosures.  \"You see,\" Mr. Maynard began, \"as Marjorie says, Maytime is,--what?\"  \"Playtime,\" supplemented Marjorie, quickly.  \"Well, then, if Maytime is playtime for the Maynards, why shouldn't we play all through the month of May?\"  \"Play every day, All the month of May, All the Maynards may Play all day! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!\"  sang Marjorie who often improvised her songs as she went along. This was not a difficult one to learn, and King and Kitty took up the refrain, and they sang it over and over with great gusto, until Mrs. Maynard begged for a respite.  \"But of course you don't mean anything like that?\" said Kitty, when the song had ceased.  \"But that's just exactly what I do mean. What do you think of the plan of the Maynards going a-Maying in their own motor car, and taking the whole month of May for it?\"  Marjorie's eyes opened wide. \"I know what you mean!\" she exclaimed; \"you mean a tour--a tour through the country in an automobile! I've heard of such things!\"  \"Wise child!\" said her father; \"well, that's exactly what I do mean. A tour through the country in our own motor, and in our own Maytime. How does it strike you?\"  \"It strikes me all of a heap!\" cried Marjorie, throwing herself into her father's arms; \"tell me more, quick! Seems as if I can't believe it!\"  \"I can't believe it, either,\" said Kitty, slowly; \"but I 'spect I can by the time we get ready to start. When are we going, Father?\"  \"On Thursday, if Mother can be ready.\"  \"Oh, yes, I can be ready. I've only to get a few things for the children and myself to wear on the journey.\"  \"Yes, we must all have up-to-date motor togs, I'm sure,\" and Mr. Maynard looked about as happy over the projected trip, as any of his children.  \"But, Father,\" said Marjorie, \"how can you take so much time away from your business? You said you couldn't take two Ourdays together because you were busy.\"  \"I didn't say exactly that, dearie, and anyway I was only joking, because I knew I was going to spring this surprise on you in a few minutes. I have arranged, of course, to be away from my business for nearly a month, and have planned to spend the greater part of May taking this motor trip. We will go to Grandma Sherwood's first, and stay a few days,--\"  \"To Grandma Sherwood's? Oh, glorious!\" And again Marjorie was seized with a paroxysm of joy, and this time she caught Kitty, and led her off for a mad dance round the room. \"Just think of it, Kit,\" she cried, \"we'll be at Grandma Sherwood's together, and you can see the lovely room she fixed up for me, and the house in the tree, and everything. Oh, Kitty!\"  \"But I'm going to be there all summer, anyway,\" said Kitty, as she finally induced Marjorie to tumble on the divan amid a heap of sofa pillows.  \"Yes, I know; but that's different. But what fun for us all to be there together for a few days! Did you say a few days, Father?\"  \"Yes, I did; but if you're so turbulent, and excitable, and noisy I think a few hours'll be enough for Grandma and Uncle Steve.\"  \"It may be enough for Grandma, but it won't for Uncle Steve,\" declared Marjorie; \"he loves rackety-packety children!\"  \"Well, he'll get his desires fulfilled when you get there,\" said Mrs. Maynard, smiling; \"but perhaps the trip there will calm you down a little bit.\"  \"No, it won't! It just makes me more and more crazy all the time I think of it! Oh, Father, won't we have a lot of our Ourdays all at once!\"  \"Indeed we will, enough to last for several years ahead. For if you debit me with last month's deficiency, of course you must credit me in the future.\"  \"Oh, no, this rule doesn't work both ways! We'll just take all the Ourdays that we can get whenever we can get them. But what are we going to do after we leave Grandma's?\"  \"Well, if you all agree, I thought we might go over to New York and see your other grandma.\"  \"Go to Grandma Maynard's, too! Oh, what fun we will have!\" and Marjorie looked as if her cup of bliss were full and running over.  \"And after that,\" said Mrs. Maynard, \"if none of you object too seriously, we thought perhaps a little run up through New England would prove attractive.\"  \"Mother,\" said King, looking at her twinkling eyes, \"you planned all this out before? It's no surprise to you!\"  \"Very true, King; your father and I planned it while we were on our Southern trip. We had such a delightful outing, it seemed only fair that we should take you children for a trip also. And your father has been thinking for some time about buying an automobile, and as he can take the time now, it all works in beautifully.\"  \"Beautiful! I should think it was!\" cried Marjorie; \"and Mother, will we all have motor coats and goggles, and all those queer things that they wear in automobiles?\"  \"You won't have any queer things, and I doubt if you'll need goggles; but you and Kitty shall have pretty motor coats, and pretty hoods and veils. We'll go on Monday to buy them.\"  \"Oh,\" sighed Marjorie, \"it just does seem too good to be true! It's like a fairy dream, and I 'spect I'll wake up every minute. What about lessons, Mother?\"  \"We've thought of that; but as your lessons would stop the first of June anyway, you'll only lose a few weeks, and so we're going to take you all out of school for that time. For this year, at any rate, Maytime shall be playtime for the Maynards.\"  \"I'm so glad I'm a Maynard, and live in the Maynard family,\" said Kitty, with a deep sigh of satisfaction.  \"So'm I,\" declared Marjorie; \"there never was such a nice family, with such a bee-yootiful father and mother!\"  And as if this were a signal for a general onslaught, the three young Maynards made a dash for the two older Maynards, and nearly choked them with well-meant but rather athletic embraces, which was their fashion of expressing approval and appreciation.     CHAPTER III  A TRIAL TRIP   Owing to some unexpected delay, the automobile didn't arrive until Wednesday. But when at last it came whirring up the drive, the assembled Maynards on the veranda greeted it with shouts of approval.  \"Did you ever see such a beauty!\" cried Marjorie, as she danced around the new car, and clambering up on the farther side, jumped over the closed door, and fell plump into one of the cushioned seats.  \"Oh, Mopsy!\" cried her father, \"that isn't the way to get in.\"  \"I don't care,--I am in! And it's just great in here! Why, there's room enough for a whole party.\"  The chauffeur who brought the car seemed a little surprised at the antics of the children, for he was a stolid Englishman, and not much accustomed to American exuberance.  Mr. Maynard had engaged him on the best recommendations, and felt sure that he was a trust-worthy and capable man. His name was Pompton, and he was large and muscular, with a face that was grave but not ill-natured.  Kingdon made friends with him at once, and climbing up into the seat beside him, asked innumerable questions about the various parts of the machine.  \"Suppose we go at once for a trial spin,\" proposed Mr. Maynard, and almost before he had completed his sentence, a chorus of assent rose in response.  \"Oh, do, Father,\" cried King; \"and let me stay here in front, so I can see how it works.\"  \"Some other time you may do that, King, but this time I want to sit in front myself, so hop out, and take one of the orchestra chairs.\"  \"All right, sir,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15097"],["title","A Grammar of the English Tongue (#1)"],["body","the sound neither of or nor ur, but a sound between     them, if not compounded of both; besides that they are probably derived     to us from the French nouns in eur, as honeur, faveur.  U.  U is long in ūse, confūsion; or short, as ŭs, concŭssion.  It coalesces with a, e, i, o; but has rather in these combinations the force of the w consonant, as quaff, quest, quit, quite, languish; sometimes in ui the i loses its sound, as in juice. It is sometimes mute before a, e, i, y, as guard, guest, guise, buy.      U is followed by e in virtue, but the e has no sound.      Ue is sometimes mute at the end of a word, in imitation of the French,     as prorogue, synagogue, plague, vague, harangue.  Y.  Y is a vowel, which, as Quintilian observes of one of the Roman letters, we might want without inconvenience, but that we have it. It supplies the place of i at the end of words, as thy, before an i, as dying; and is commonly retained in derivative words where it was part of a diphthong, in the primitive; as, destroy, destroyer; betray, betrayed, betrayer; pray, prayer; say, sayer; day, days.      Y being the Saxon vowel y, which was commonly used where i is now put,     occurs very frequently in all old books.  GENERAL RULES.  A vowel in the beginning or middle syllable, before two consonants, is commonly short, as ŏppŏrtunity.  In monosyllables a single vowel before a single consonant is short; as stag, frog.      Many is pronounced as if it were written manny.         *       *       *       *       *  OF CONSONANTS.  B.  B has one unvaried sound, such as it obtains in other languages.  It is mute in debt, debtor, subtle, doubt, lamb, limb, dumb, thumb, climb, comb, womb.      It is used before l and r, as black, brown.  C.  C has before e and i the sound of s; as sincerely, centrick, century, circular, cistern, city, siccity: before a, o, and u, it sounds like k, as calm, concavity, copper, incorporate, curiosity, concupiscence.      C might be omitted in the language without loss, since one of its     sounds might be supplied by, s, and the other by k, but that it     preserves to the eye the etymology of words, as face from facies,     captive from captivus.  Ch has a sound which is analyzed into tsh, as church, chin, crutch. It is the same sound which the Italians give to the c simple before i and e, as citta, cerro.  Ch is sounded like k in words derived from the Greek, as chymist, scheme, choler. Arch is commonly sounded ark before a vowel, as archangel, and with the English sound of ch before a consonant, as archbishop.      Ch, in some French words not yet assimilated, sounds like sh, as     machine, chaise.      C, according to English orthography, never ends a word; therefore we     write stick, block, which were originally, sticke, blocke. In such     words c is now mute.      It is used before l and r, as clock, cross.  D.  Is uniform in its sound, as death, diligent.      It is used before r, as draw, dross; and w as dwell.  F.  F, though having a name beginning with a vowel, is numbered by the grammarians among the semivowels, yet has this quality of a mute, that it is commodiously sounded before a liquid, as flask, fry, freckle. It has an unvariable sound, except that of is sometimes spoken nearly as ov.  G.  G has two sounds; one hard, as in gay, go, gun; the other soft, as in gem, giant.  At the end of a word it is always hard, as ring, snug, song, frog.  Before e and i the sound is uncertain.  G before e is soft, as gem, generation, except in gear, geld, geese, get, gewgaw, and derivatives from words ending in g, as singing, stronger, and generally before er at the ends of words, as finger.  G is mute before n, as gnash, sign, foreign.  G before i is hard, as give, except in giant, gigantick, gibbet, gibe, giblets, Giles, gill, gilliflower, gin, ginger, gingle, to which may be added Egypt and gypsy.  Gh in the beginning of a word has the sound of the hard g, as ghostly; in the middle, and sometimes at the end, it is quite silent, as though, right, sought, spoken tho', rite, soute.  It has often at the end the sound of f, as laugh; whence laughter retains the same sound in the middle; cough, trough, sough, tough, enough, slough.      It is not to be doubted, but that in the original pronunciation gh has     the force of a consonant deeply guttural, which is still continued     among the Scotch.      G is used before h, l, and r.  H.  H is a note of aspiration, and shows that the following vowel must be pronounced with a strong emission of breath, as hat, horse.  It seldom begins any but the first syllable, in which it is always sounded with a full breath, except in heir, herb, hostler, honour, humble, honest, humour and their derivatives.      It sometimes begins middle or final syllables in words compounded, as     blockhead; or derived from the Latin, as comprehend.  J.  J consonant sounds uniformly like the soft g, and is therefore a letter useless, except in etymology, as ejaculation, jester, jocund, juice.  K.  K has the sound of hard c, and is used before e and i, where, according to English analogy, c would be soft, as kept, king, skirt, skeptick, for so it should be written, not sceptick, because sc is sounded like s, as in scene.      It is used before n, as knell, knot, but totally loses its sound in     modern pronunciation.  K is never doubled; but c is used before it to shorten the vowel by a double consonant, as cockle, pickle.  L.  L has in English the same liquid sound as in other languages.      The custom is to double the l at the end of monosyllables, as kill,     will, full. These words were originally written kille, wille, fulle;     and when the e first grew silent, and was afterward omitted, the ll was     retained, to give force, according to the analogy of our language, to     the foregoing vowel.  L, is sometimes mute, as in calf, half, halves, calves, could, would, should, psalm, talk, salmon, falcon.      The Saxons, who delighted in guttural sounds, sometimes aspirated the l     at the beginning of words, as hlaf, a loaf, or bread; hlaford, a lord;     but this pronunciation is now disused.  Le at the end of words is pronounced like a weak el, in which the e is almost mute, as table, shuttle.  M.  M has always the same sound, as murmur, monumental.  N.  N has always, the same sound, as noble, manners.  N is sometimes mute after m, as damn, condemn, hymn.  P.  P has always the same sound which the Welsh and Germans confound with b.  P is sometimes mute, as in psalm, and between m and t, as tempt.  Ph is used for f in words derived from the Greek, as philosopher, philanthropy, Philip.  Q.  Q, as in other languages, is always followed by u, and has a sound which our Saxon ancestors well expressed by cw, as quadrant, queen, equestrian, quilt, inquiry, quire, quotidian. Qu is never followed by u.  Qu is sometimes sounded, in words derived from the French, like k, as conquer, liquor, risque, chequer.  R.  R has the same rough snarling sound as in the other tongues.      The Saxons used often to put h before it, as before l at the beginning     of words.      Rh is used in words derived from the Greek, as myrrh, myrrhine,     catarrhous, rheum, rheumatick, rhyme.  Re, at the end of some words derived from the Latin or French, is pronounced like a weak er, as theatre, sepulchre.  S.  S has a hissing sound, as sibilation, sister.      A single s seldom ends any word, except in the third person of verbs,     as loves, grows; and the plurals of nouns, as trees, bushes,     distresses; the pronouns this, his, ours, yours, us; the adverb thus;     and words derived from Latin, as rebus, surplus; the close being always     either in se, as house, horse, or in ss, as grass, dress, bliss, less,     anciently grasse, dresse.  S, single at the end of words, has a grosser sound, like that of z, as trees, eyes, except this, thus, us, rebus, surplus.  It sounds like z before ion, if a vowel goes before it, as intrusion; and like s, if it follows a consonant, as conversion.  It sounds like z before e mute, as refuse, and before y final, as rosy; and in those words, bosom, desire, wisdom, prison, prisoner, present, present, damsel, casement.      It is the peculiar quality of s, that it may be sounded before all     consonants, except x and z, in which s is comprised, x being only ks,     and z a hard or gross s. This s is therefore termed by grammarians suæ     potestatis litera; the reason of which the learned Dr. Clarke     erroneously supposed to be, that in some words it might be doubled at     pleasure. Thus we find in several languages.  Σβεννυμι, scatter, sdegno, sdrucciolo, sfavellare, σφιγξ, sgombrare, sgranare, shake, slumber, smell, snipe, space, splendour, spring, squeeze, shrew, step, strength, stramen, stripe, sventura, swell.  S is mute in isle, island, demesne, viscount.  T.  T has its customary sound; as take, temptation.  Ti before a vowel has the sound of si as salvation, except an s goes before, as question; excepting likewise derivatives from words ending in ty, as mighty, mightier.  Th has two sounds; the one soft, as thus, whether; the other hard, as thing, think. The sound is soft in these words, then, thence, and there, with their derivatives and compounds, and in that, these, thou, thee, thy, thine, their, they, this, those, them, though, thus; and in all words between two vowels, as, father, whether; and between r and a vowel, as burthen.  In other words it is hard, as thick, thunder, faith, faithful. Where it is softened at the end of a word, an e silent must be added, as breath, breathe; cloth, clothe.  V.  V has a sound of near affinity to that of f, as vain, vanity.      From f in the Islandick alphabet, v is only distinguished by a     diacritical point.  W.  Of w, which in diphthongs is often an undoubted vowel, some grammarians have doubted whether it ever be a consonant; and not rather as it is called a double u, or ou, as water may be resolved into"]]]
