I was robbed while I was sick, and only for a tambourine queen I got acquainted with, I guess I'd 'a' died. They're treacherous as hell, though.  Long as she thought I had money--oh, well, they's no use expecting kindness in this world.  Or gratitude.  I'm always helpin' folks out and gittin' kicked and cussed for my pay.  Lookit the way I lived with snakes and lizards--lived in a cave, like a coyote!--to help you git this plane in shape.  You was to take me to Los for pay--but I ain't there yet.  I'm stuck here, sick and hungry--I ain't et a mouthful since last night, and then I only had a dish of sour beans that damn' Mex. hussy handed out to me through a window!  Me, Bland Halliday, a flyer that has made his hundreds doing exhibition work; that has had his picture on the front page of big city papers, and folks followin' him down the street just to get a look at him!  Me--why, a yellow dawg has got the edge on me for luck!  I might better be dead--\"  His loose lips quivered.  Tears of self-pity welled up into his pale blue eyes.  He turned away and stared across the barren calf lot that Johnny used for a flying field.  Johnny began to have premonitory qualms of a sympathy which he knew was undeserved.  Bland Halliday had got a square deal--more than a square deal; for Sudden, Johnny knew, had paid him generously for repairing the plane while Johnny was sick.  Bland had undoubtedly squandered the money in one long debauch, and there was no doubt in Johnny's mind of Bland's reason for missing his train.  He was a bum by nature and he would double-cross his own mother, Johnny firmly believed.  Yet, there was Johnny's boyish sympathy that never failed sundry stray dogs and cats that came in his way.  It impelled him now to befriend Bland Halliday.  \"Well, since the cat's come back, I suppose it must have its saucer of milk,\" he grinned, by way of hiding the fact that the lip-quiver had touched him.  \"I haven't taken any nourishment myself for quite some time.  Come on and eat.\"  He started back toward town, and Bland Halliday followed him like a lonesome pup.  On the way, Johnny took stock of Bland in little quick glances from the corner of his eyes.  Bland had been shabby when Johnny discovered him one day on the depot platform of a tiny town farther down the line.  He had been shabbier after three weeks in Johnny's camp, working on the airplane in hope of a free trip to the Coast.  But his shabbiness now surpassed anything Johnny had known, because Bland had evidently made pitiful attempts to hide it.  That, Johnny guessed, was because of the hussy Bland had mentioned.  Bland's shoes were worn through on the sides, and he had blackened his ragged socks to hide the holes.  Somewhere he had got a blue serge coat, from which the lining sagged in frayed wrinkles.  His pockets were torn down at the corners; buttons were gone, grease spots and beer stains patterned the cloth.  Under the coat he wore a pink-and-white silk shirt, much soiled and with the neck frankly open, imitating sport style because of missing buttons.  He looked what he was by nature; what he was by training,--a really skilful birdman,--did not show at all.  He begged a smoke from Johnny and slouched along, with an aimless garrulity talking of his hard luck, now curiously shot with hope. Which irritated Johnny vaguely, since instinct told him whence that hope had sprung.  Still, sympathy made him kind to Bland just because Bland was so worthless and so miserable.  At a dingy, fly-infested place called \"Red's Quick Lunch\" whither Johnny, mindful of his low finances, piloted him, Bland ordered largely and complained because his \"T bone\" was too rare, and afterwards because it was tough.  Johnny dined on \"coffee and sinkers\" so that he could afford Bland's steak and \"French fried\" and hot biscuits and pie and two cups of coffee.  The cat, he told himself grimly, was not content with a saucer of milk.  It was on the top shelf of the pantry, lapping all the cream off the pan!  Afterwards he took Bland to the hotel where his room was paid for until the end of the week, led him up there, produced an old suit of clothes that had not seemed to wear a sufficiently prosperous air for the owner of an airplane, and suggestively opened the door to the bathroom.  Bland took the clothes and went in, mumbling a fear that he would do himself mortal injury if he took a bath right after a meal.  \"If you die, you'll die clean, anyway,\" Johnny told him grimly.  So Bland took a bath and emerged looking almost respectable.  Johnny had brought his second-best shoes out, and Bland put them on, pursing his loose lips because the shoes were a size too small.  But Johnny had thrown Bland's shoes out of the window, so Bland had to bear the pinching.  Johnny sat on the edge of the dresser smoking and fanning the smoke away from his round, meditative eyes while he looked Bland over.  Bland caught the look, and in spite of the shoes he grinned amiably.  \"I take it back, bo, what I said about gratitude.  You got it, after all.\"  \"Huh!\" Johnny grunted.  \"Gratitude, huh?\"  \"I knowed you wouldn't throw down a friend, old top.  I was in the dumps.  A feller'll talk most any way when he's feeling the after effects, and is hungry and broke.  Now I'm my own man again.  What next?  Name it, bo--I'm game.\"  \"Next,\" said Johnny, \"is bed, I guess.  You're clean, now--you can sleep here.\"  Bland showed that he could feel the sentiment called compunction.  \"Much obliged, bo--but I don't want to crowd you--\"  \"You won't crowd me,\" said Johnny drily, \"I aim to sleep with the plane.\"  Bland may have read Johnny's reason for sleeping with his airplane, but beyond one quick look he made no sign.  \"Still nuts over it--I'll say you are,\" he grunted.  \"You wait till you've been in the game long as I have, bo.\"  With a blanket and pillow bought on his way through the town, Johnny disposed himself for the night under the nose of the plane with the wheels of the landing gear at his back.  He was not by nature a suspicious young man, but he knew Bland Halliday; and to know Bland was to distrust him.  He felt that he was taking a necessary precaution, now that he knew Bland was in Tucson.  With the landing gear behind him, no one could move the airplane in the night without first moving him.  Now that he thought of it, Bland had been left fifty miles farther down the line, to catch his train.  Tucson was a perfectly illogical place for him to be in, even for the purpose of carousing.  One would certainly expect him to hurry to the city of his desires and take his pleasure there.  Johnny decided that Bland must still have an eye on the plane.  That he was secretly envious of Bland as an aviator did not add to his mental comfort.  Bland could speak with slighting familiarity of \"the game,\" and assume a boredom not altogether a pose.  Bland had drunk deep and satisfyingly of the cup which Johnny, to save his honor, must put away from him after a tantalising sip or two.  Not until Bland had said, \"Wait till you've been in the game as long as I have,\" had Johnny realized to the full just what it would mean to him to part with his airplane without being accepted by the government as an aviator.  At the Rolling R, when his conscience debt to Sudden pressed so heavily, he had figured very nicely and had found the answer to his problem without much trouble.  To enlist as an aviator with his airplane, or to sell the plane in Tucson, turn the proceeds over to Sudden to pay his debt and enlist as an aviator without the machine, had seemed perfectly simple.  Either way would be making good the mistakes of his past and paving the way for future achievements. Parting with the plane had not promised to so wrench the very heart out of him when he fully expected to fly faster and farther in airplanes owned by the government; faster and farther toward the goal of all red-blooded young males: glory or wealth, the hero's wreath of laurel or the smile of dame Fortune.  Mary V stood on the heights waiting for him, as Johnny had planned and dreamed.  He would come back to her a captain, maybe--perhaps even a major, in these hot times of swift achievement.  They would all be proud to shake his hand, those jeering ones who called him Skyrider for a joke.  Captain Jewel would not have sounded bad at all.  But--  There is no dodging the finality of Uncle Sam's no.  They had not wanted Johnny Jewel to fly for fame and his country's honor.  And if he sold his own airplane, how then would he fly?  How could he ever hope to be in the game as long as Bland had been?  How could he do anything but go back meekly to the Rolling R Ranch and ride bronks for Mary V's father, and be hailed as Skyrider still, who had no more any hope of riding the sky?  Gloom at last plumbed the depths of Johnny's soul, and showed him where grew the root of his unalterable determination to combat Mary V's plan to have him at the ranch.  Much as he loved Mary V he would hate going back to the dull routine of ranch life.  (And after all, a youth like Johnny loves nothing quite so much as his air castles.)  As a rider of bronks he was spoiled, he who had ridden triumphant the high air lanes. He had talked of paying his debt to Sudden, he had talked of his self-respect and his honesty and his pride--but above and beyond them all he was fighting to save his castle in the air.  Debt or no debt, he could never go back to the Rolling R and be a rancher.  Lying there under his airplane and staring up at the starred purple of the night he knew that he could not go back.  Yet he knew too that once he had sold his airplane he would be almost as helpless financially as Bland Halliday, unless he returned to the only trade he knew, the trade of riding bronks and performing the various other duties that would be his portion at the Rolling R.  Johnny pictured himself back at the Rolling R; pictured"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14488"],["title","Elsie's Kith and Kin (#1)"],["body","hands, and toss it aside, saying she was trying her eyes by such constant use; and, besides, he wanted her undivided attention.  And she would resign herself to her fate, nothing loath to be drawn close to his side, or to a seat upon his knee, to be petted and caressed like a child, which, indeed, he persisted in calling her.  This was when they were alone: but very frequently they had company to spend the day, afternoon, or evening; for Ion had always been noted for its hospitality; and scarcely a week passed in which they did not pay a visit to the Oaks, the Laurels, the Pines, or Roselands.  Also a brisk correspondence was carried on with the absent members of the family. And Zoe's housekeeping cares and duties were just enough to be an agreeable variety in her occupations: every day, too, when the weather permitted, she walked or rode out with her husband.  And so the time passed quite delightfully for the first two months after the departure of the Viamede party.  It was a disappointment that Edward found himself too busy to make the hoped-for trip to Viamede at Christmas-time; yet Zoe did not fret over it, and really enjoyed the holidays extremely, giving and receiving numerous handsome presents, and, with Edward's assistance, making it a merry and happy time for the servants and other dependants, as well as for the relatives and friends still in the neighborhood.  The necessary shopping, with Edward to help her, and the packing and sending off of the Christmas-boxes to Viamede, to the college-boys,--Herbert and Harold,--and numerous other relatives and friends far and near, Zoe thought altogether the most delightful business she had ever taken in hand.  A very merry, happy little woman she was through all those weeks and months, Edward as devoted as any lover, and as gay and light-hearted as herself.  \"Zoe, darling,\" Edward said one day at dinner, \"I must drive over into our little village of Union--by the way, do you know that we have more than a hundred towns of that name in these United States?\"  \"No, I did not know, or suspect, that we had nearly so many,\" she interrupted, laughing: \"no wonder letters go astray when people are not particular to give the names of both county and State. But what were you going to say about driving over there?\"  \"I must see a gentleman on business, who will be there to meet the five-o'clock train, and leave on it; and, in order to be certain of seeing him, I must be there at least fifteen or twenty minutes before it is due. Shall I have the pleasure of my wife's company in the carriage? I have ordered it to be at the door by fifteen or twenty minutes past four, which will give us plenty of time, as it is an easy matter to drive from here to Union in ten minutes.\"  \"Thank you,\" she said. \"I accept the invitation with pleasure, and promise to be ready at the minute.\"  \"You are the best little woman about that,\" he returned, with an appreciative look and smile. \"I don't remember that you have ever yet kept me waiting, when told beforehand at what time I intended to start.\"  \"Of course not,\" she said, with a pleased laugh; \"because I was afraid, if I did, I shouldn't be invited so often: and I'm always so glad to go with you.\"  \"Not gladder than I am to have you,\" he said, with a very lover-like glance and smile. \"I always enjoy your society, and am always proud to show my friends and acquaintances what a dear little wife I have. I dare say I'm looked upon as a very fortunate fellow in that respect, and sometimes envied on account of having drawn such a prize in the matrimonial lottery.\"  They had left the table while he spoke, and with the last words he passed his arm round her waist.  \"Dear me, Ned, what a gallant speech!\" she said, flushing with delight; \"you deserve a reward:\" and she held up her face for a kiss.  \"I am overpaid,\" he said, when he had bestowed it.  \"In spite of the coin being such as you have a right to help yourself to whenever you will?\" she returned with a merry laugh. \"O Ned, my lover-husband!\" she added, laying her head on his breast, \"I am so happy in belonging to you, and I can never love you enough for all your goodness to me!\"  \"Darling, are you not equally good and loving to me?\" he asked in tender tones, and holding her close.  \"But I owe every thing to you,\" she responded with emotion. \"If you had not come to my aid when my dear father was taken from me, what would have become of me, a mere child, without a near relative in the world, alone and destitute in a foreign land?\"  \"But I loved you, dearest. I sought my own happiness, as well as yours, in asking you to be my wife. So you need never feel burdened by the idea that you are under any special obligation to me, to whom you are the very sunshine of life.\"  \"Dear Ned, how very kind in you to say so,\" she responded, gazing with ardent affection into his eyes; \"but it isn't burdensome to be under obligation to you, any more than it is a trial to be ruled by you,\" she added, with playful tenderness; \"and I love to think of all your goodness to me.\"  It was five minutes past four by Zoe's watch, and she just about to go to her dressing-room to put on her hat and cloak, when visitors were announced,--some ladies who always made a lengthened call at Ion; so she at once resigned herself to the loss of her anticipated drive with her husband.  \"O Ned!\" she whispered in a hasty, vexed aside, \"you'll have to go alone.\"  \"Yes, dear,\" he returned; \"but I'll try to get back in time to take you a drive in the other direction.\"  They stepped forward, and greeted their guests with hospitable cordiality.  They were friends whose visits were prized and enjoyed, though their coming just at this time was causing Zoe a real disappointment. However, Edward's promise of a drive with him at a later hour so far made amends for it, that she could truthfully express pleasure in seeing her guests.  Edward chatted with them for a few moments, then, excusing himself on the plea of business that could not be deferred, left them to be entertained by Zoe, while he entered his waiting carriage, and went on his way to the village, where he expected to meet his business acquaintance.     CHAPTER II.  \"The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness.\"--SHAKSPEARE.   Edward had met and held his desired interview with his business acquaintance, seen him aboard his train, and was standing watching it as it steamed away and disappeared in the distance, when a feminine voice, close at hand, suddenly accosted him.  \"O Mr. Travilla! how are you? I consider myself very fortunate in finding you here.\"  He turned toward the speaker, and was not too greatly pleased at sight of her.  \"Ah! good-evening, Miss Deane,\" he said, taking her offered hand, and speaking with gentlemanly courtesy. \"In what can I be of service to you?\"  \"By inviting me to Ion to spend the night,\" she returned laughingly. \"I've missed my train, and was quite in despair at the thought of staying alone over night in one of the miserable little hotels of this miserable little village. So I was delighted to see your carriage standing there, and you yourself beside it; for, knowing you to be one of the most hospitable of men, I am sure you will be moved to pity, and take me home with you.\"  Edward's heart sank at thought of Zoe, but, seeing no way out of the dilemma, \"Certainly,\" he said, and helped his self-invited guest to a seat in his carriage, placed himself by her side, and bade the coachman drive on to Ion.  \"Now, really, this is very good in you, Mr. Travilla,\" remarked Miss Deane: \"there is no place I like better to visit than Ion, and I begin to think it was rather a fortunate mishap--missing my train.\"  \"Very unfortunate for me, I fear,\" sighed Edward to himself. \"The loss of her drive will be a great disappointment to Zoe, and the sight of such a guest far from making it up to her. I am thankful the visit is to be for only a night.\"  Aloud he said, \"I fear you will find it less pleasant than on former occasions,--in fact, rather lonely; as all the family are absent--spending the winter at Viamede, my mother's Louisiana plantation--except my wife and myself.\"  \"Ah! but your wife is a charming little girl,--I never can think of her as a woman, you know,--and you are a host in yourself,\" returned the lady laughingly.  Zoe's callers had left; and she, having donned hat and cloak, not to keep her husband a single moment, was at the window watching for his coming, when the carriage came driving up the avenue, and drew up at the door.  She hurried out, expecting to find no one there but himself, and to be at once handed to a seat in the vehicle, and the next minute be speeding away with him, enjoying her drive all the more for the little disappointment that had preceded it.  What, then, was her chagrin to see a visitor handed out, and that visitor the woman for whom she had conceived the most violent antipathy!  \"Miss Deane, my dear,\" Edward said, with an entreating look at Zoe, which she did not see, her eyes being at that instant fixed upon the face of her uninvited and unwelcome guest.  \"How do you do, my dear Mrs. Travilla? I hope you are glad to see me?\" laughed the intruder, holding out a delicately gloved hand, \"your husband has played the Good Samaritan to me to-night--saving me from having to stay in one of those wretched little hotels in the village till two o'clock to-morrow morning.\"  \"I am in usual health, thank you. Will you walk in?\" returned Zoe in a freezing tone, and utterly ignoring the offered hand. \"Will you step into the parlor? or would you prefer being shown to your room first?\"  \"The latter, if you please,\" Miss Deane answered sweetly, apparently quite unaware that Zoe's manner was in the least ungracious.  \"Dinah,\" said Zoe, to a maid-in-waiting, \"show Miss Deane to the room she occupied on her last visit. Carry up her satchel, and see that she has every thing she wants.\"  Having given the order, Zoe stepped out to the veranda where"]]]
