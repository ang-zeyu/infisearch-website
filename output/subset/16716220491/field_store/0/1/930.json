It is a path, like all those stairs and ways that go down to the River, which began when human footsteps first outlined London with rough tracks.  It is a path by which the descendants of those primitives went out of London, when projecting the original enterprise of their forbears from Wapping to the Guinea Coast and Manitoba.  Why should we believe it is different today?  The sea does not change, and seamen are what they were if their ships are not those we admired many years ago in the India Docks.  It is impossible for those who know them to see those moody streets of Dockland, indeterminate, for they follow the River, which run from Tooley Street by the Hole-in-the-Wall to the Deptford docks, and from Tower Hill along Wapping High Street to Limehouse and the Isle of Dogs, as strangers would see them.  What could they be to strangers?  Mud, taverns, pawnshops, neglected and obscure churches, and houses that might know nothing but ill-fortune.  So they are; but those ways hold more than the visible shades.  The warehouses of that meandering chasm which is Wapping High Street are like weathered and unequal cliffs.  It is hard to believe sunlight ever falls there.  It could not get down.  It is not easy to believe the River is near.  It seldom shows.  You think at times you hear the distant call of a ship.  But what would that be?  Something in the mind.  It happened long ago.  You, too, are a ghost left by the vanished past.  There is a man above at a high loophole, the topmost cave of a warehouse which you can see has been exposed to commerce and the elements for ages; he pulls in a bale pendulous from the cable of a derrick.  Below him one of the horses of a van tosses its nose-bag. There is no other movement.  A carman leans against an iron post, and cuts bread and cheese with a clasp-knife.  It was curious to hear that steamer call, but we knew what it was.  It was from a ship that went down, we have lately heard, in the War, and her spectre reminds us, from a voyage which is over, of men we shall see no more.  But the call comes again just where the Stairs, like a shining wedge of day, hold the black warehouses asunder, and give us the light of the River and a release to the outer world.  And there, moving swiftly across the brightness, goes a steamer outward bound.  That was what we wanted to know.  She confirms it, and her signal, to whomever it was made, carries farther than she would guess.  It is understood.  The past for some of us now is our only populous and habitable world, invisible to others, but alive with whispers for us. Yet the sea still moves daily along the old foreshore, and ships still come and go, and do not, like us, run aground on what now is not there.     II. A Midnight Voyage  Our voyage was to begin at midnight from near Limehouse Hole.  The hour and the place have been less promising in the beginning of many a strange adventure.  Where the voyage would end could not be said, except that it would be in Bugsby's Reach, and at some time or other. It was now ten o'clock, getting towards sailing time, and the way to the foreshore was unlighted and devious.  Yet it was somewhere near. This area of still and empty night railed off from the glare of the Commercial Road would be Limehouse Church.  It is foolish to suppose you know the Tower Hamlets because you have seen them by day.  They change.  They are like those uncanny folk of the fables.  At night, wonderfully, they become something else, take another form, which has never been more than glimpsed, and another character, so fabulous and secret that it will support the tales of the wildest romanticist, who rightly feels that if such yarns were told of 'Frisco or Timbuctoo they might get found out.  Was this the church?  Three Chinamen were disputing by its gate.  Perhaps they were in disagreement as to where the church would be in daylight.  At a corner where the broad main channel of electric light ended, and perplexity began, a policeman stood, and directed me into chaos. \"Anywhere,\" he explained, \"anywhere down there will do.\"  I saw a narrow alley in the darkness, which had one gas lamp and many cobbled stones.  At the bottom of the lane were three iron posts.  Beyond the posts a bracket lamp showed a brick wall, and in the wall was an arch so full of gloom that it seemed impassable, except to a steady draught of cold air that might have been the midnight itself entering Limehouse from its own place.  At the far end of that opening in the wall was nothing.  I stood on an invisible wooden platform and looked into nothing with no belief that a voyage could begin from there.  Before me then should have been the Thames, at the top of the flood tide.  It was not seen.  There was only a black void dividing some clusters of brilliant but remote and diminished lights.  There were odd stars which detached themselves from the fixed clusters, and moved in the void, sounding the profundity of the chasm beneath them with lines of trembling fire.  Such a wandering comet drifted near where I stood on the verge of nothing, and then it was plain that its trail of quivering light did not sound, but floated and undulated on a travelling road--that chasm before me was black because it was filled with fluid night.  Night, I discovered suddenly, was in irresistible movement.  It was swift and heavy.  It was unconfined.  It was welling higher to douse our feeble glims and to founder London, built of shadows on its boundary.  It moved with frightful quietness.  It seemed confident of its power.  It swirled and eddied by the piles of the wharf, and there it found a voice, though that was muffled; yet now and then it broke into levity for a moment, as at some shrouded and alien jest.  There were sounds which reached me at last from the opposite shore, faint with distance and terror.  The warning from an unseen steamer going out was as if a soul, crossing this Styx, now knew all.  There is no London on the Thames, after sundown.  Most of us know very little of the River by day.  It might then be no more native to our capital than the Orientals who stand under the Limehouse gas lamps at night.  It surprises us.  We turn and look at it from our seat in a tram, and watch a barge going down on the ebb--it luckily misses the piers of Blackfriars Bridge--as if a door had unexpectedly opened on a mystery, revealing another world in London, and another sort of life than ours. It is as uncanny as if we had sensed another dimension of space.  The tram gets among the buildings again, and we are reassured by the confined and arid life we know.  But what a light and width had that surprising world where we saw a barge drifting as leisurely as though the narrow limits which we call reality were there unknown!  But after dark there is not only no River, when you stand where by day is its foreshore; there is no London.  Then, looking out from Limehouse, you might be the only surviving memory of a city that has vanished.  You might be solitary among the unsubstantial shades, for about you are only comets passing through space, and inscrutable shapes; your neighbours are Cassiopeia and the Great Bear.  But where was our barge, the _Lizzie_?  I became aware abruptly of the skipper of this ship for our midnight voyage among the stars.  He had his coat-collar raised.  The _Lizzie_, he said, was now free of the mud, and he was going to push off.  Sitting on a bollard, and pulling out his tobacco-pouch, he said he hadn't had her out before.  Sorry he'd got to do it now.  She was a bitch.  She bucked her other man overboard three days ago.  They hadn't found him yet.  They found her down by Gallions Reach.  Jack Jones was the other chap.  Old Rarzo they called him.  Took more than a little to give him that colour.  But he was All Right.  They were going to give a benefit concert for his wife and kids.  Jack's brother was going to sing; good as Harry Lauder, he is.  Below us a swirl of water broke into mirth, instantly suppressed.  We could see the _Lizzie_ now.  The ripples slipped round her to the tune of they-'avn't-found-'im-yet, they-'avn't-found-'im-yet-they 'avn't. The skipper and crew rose, fumbling at his feet for a rope.  There did not seem to be much of the _Lizzie_.  She was but a little raft to drift out on those tides which move among the stars.  \"Now's your chance,\" said her crew, and I took it, on all fours.  The last remnant of London was then pushed from us with a pole.  We were launched on night, which had begun its ebb towards morning.  The punt sidled away obliquely for mid-stream.  I stood at one end of it.  The figure of Charon could be seen at the other, of long acquaintance with this passage, using his sweep with the indifference of habitude.  Perhaps it was not Charon.  Yet there was some obstruction to the belief that we were bound for no more than the steamer _Aldebaran_, anchored in Bugsby's Reach.  From the low deck of the barge it was surprising that the River, whose name was Night, was content with the height to which it had risen.  Perhaps it was taking its time.  It might soon receive an influx from space, rise then in a silent upheaval, and those low shadows that were London, even now half foundered, would at once go.  This darkness was an irresponsible power. It was the same flood which had sunk Knossos and Memphis.  It was tranquil, indifferent, knowing us not, reckoning us all one with the Sumerians.  They were below it.  It had risen above them.  Now the time had come when it was laving the base of London.  The crew cried out to us that over there was the entrance to the West India Dock.  We knew that place in another life.  But should Charon joke with us?  We saw only chaos, in which the beams from a reputed city glimmered without purpose.  The shadow of the master of our black barge pulled at his sweep with a slow confidence that was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15168"],["title","Bowser the Hound (#1)"],["body","in sight, his nose in the trail Old Man Coyote had left. Into Bowser's voice crept a new note of eagerness as his nose picked up the scent stronger than ever. Straight on he raced and it seemed as if he had gained new strength. His whole thought was on just one thing--catching Old Man Coyote, and Old Man Coyote knew it.  Bowser didn't see that he was coming to a steep bank. He didn't see it at all until he reached the edge of it, and then he was going so fast that he couldn't stop. Over he went with a frightened yelp! Down, down he fell, and landed with a thump on the ice below. He landed so hard that he broke the ice, and went through into the cold, black water.  Old Man Coyote crept to the edge of the bank and peeped over. Poor Bowser was having a terrible time. You see, the cold water had taken what little breath his fall had not knocked out of him. He doesn't like to go in water anyway. You know the hair of his coat is short and doesn't protect him as it would if it were long. Old Man Coyote grinned wickedly as he watched Bowser struggling feebly to climb out on the ice. Each time he tried he slipped back, and all the time he was whimpering.  Old Man Coyote grinned more wickedly than ever. I suspect that he hoped that Bowser would not be able to get out. But after a little Bowser did manage to crawl out, and stood on the ice, shivering shaking. Once more Old Man Coyote grinned, then, turning, he trotted back towards Farmer Brown's.     CHAPTER IV  POOR BOWSER      Follow a crooked trail and you will find a scamp at the end.      _Bowser the Hound._   Poor Bowser! He stood shivering and shaking on the ice of the strange river to which Old Man Coyote had led him, and he knew not which way to turn. Not only was he shivering and shaking from his cold bath, but he was bruised by his fall from the top of the steep bank, and he was so tired by his long run after Old Man Coyote that he could hardly stand.  Old Man Coyote had stayed only long enough to see that Bowser had managed to get out of the water, then had turned back towards the Old Pasture, the Green Meadows and the Green Forest near Farmer Brown's. You see, Old Man Coyote knew the way back. He would take his time about getting there, for it really made no particular difference to him when he reached home. He felt sure he would be able to find something to eat on the way.  But with Bowser it was very different. Poor Bowser didn't know where he was. It would have been bad enough under any circumstances to have been lost, but to be lost and at the same time tired almost to death, bruised and lame, wet and chilled through, was almost too much to bear. He hadn't the least idea which way to turn. He couldn't climb up the bank to find his own trail and follow it back home if he wanted to. You see, that bank was very steep for some distance in each direction, and so it was impossible for Bowser to climb it.  For a few minutes he stood shivering, shaking and whimpering, not knowing which way to turn. Then he started down the river on the ice, for he knew he would freeze if he continued to stand still. He limped badly because one leg had been hurt in his fall. After a while he came to a place where he could get up on the bank. It was in the midst of deep woods and a very, very lonely place. Hard crusted snow covered the ground, but it was better than walking on the ice and for this Bowser was thankful.  Which way should he turn? Where should he go? Night was coming on; he was wet, cold and hungry, and as utterly lost as ever a dog was. Poor Bowser! For a minute or two he sat down and howled from sheer lonesomeness and discouragement. How he did wish he had left Old Man Coyote alone! How he did long for his snug, warm, little house in Farmer Brown's dooryard, and for the good meal he knew was awaiting him there. Now that the excitement of the hunt was over, he realized how very, very hungry he was, and he began to wonder where he would be able to get anything to eat. Do you wonder that he howled?  Old Man Coyote, trotting along on his way home, heard that howl and understood it. Again he grinned that wicked grin of his, and stopped to listen. \"I don't think he'll hunt me again in a hurry,\" he muttered, then trotted on. Poor Bowser! Hunting for anything but his home was farthest from his thoughts.     CHAPTER V  BOWSER SPENDS A BAD NIGHT      There's nothing like just sticking to     The thing you undertake to do.     There'll be no cause then, though you fail,     To hang your head or drop your tail.      _Bowser the Hound._   Bowser was lost, utterly lost. He hadn't the least idea in which direction Farmer Brown's house was. In fact he hadn't the least idea which way to turn to find any house. It was the most lonely kind of a lonely place to which Old Man Coyote had led him and there played the trick on him which had caused him to tumble into the strange river.  But Bowser couldn't stand still for long. Already jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was going to bed behind the Purple Hills, and Bowser knew that cold as had been the day, the night would be still colder. He must keep moving until he found a shelter. If he didn't he would freeze. So whimpering and whining, Bowser limped along.  Bowser was not afraid to be out at night as some folks are. Goodness, no! In fact, on many a moonlight night Bowser had hunted Reddy Fox or Granny Fox all night long. Never once had he felt lonesome then. But now it was very, very different. You see, on those nights when he had hunted he always had known where he was. He had known that at any time he could go straight home if he wanted to. That made all the difference in the world.  It would have been bad enough, being lost this way, had he been feeling at his best. Being lost always makes one feel terribly lonesome. Lonesomeness is one of the worst parts of the feeling of being lost. But added to this was the fact that Bowser was really not in fit condition to be out at all. He was wet, tired, lame and hungry. Do you wonder that he whimpered and whined as he limped along over the hard snow, and hadn't the least idea whether he was headed towards home or deeper into the great woods?  For a long time he kept on until it seemed to him he couldn't drag one foot after another. Then quite suddenly something big and dark loomed up in front of him. It really wasn't as big as it seemed. It was a little house, a sugar camp, just such a one as Farmer Brown has near his home. Bowser crept to the door. It was closed. Bowser sniffed and sniffed and his heart sank, for there was no scent of human beings. Then he knew that that little house was deserted and empty. Still he whined and scratched at the door. By and by the door opened ever so little, for it had not been locked.  Bowser crept in. In one corner he found some hay, and in this he curled up. It was cold, very cold, but not nearly as cold as outside that little house. So Bowser curled up in the hay and shivered and shook and slept a little and wished with all his might that he never had found the tracks of Old Man Coyote.     CHAPTER VI  THE SURPRISE OF BLACKY THE CROW      The harder it is to follow a trail     The greater the reason you should not fail.      _Bowser the Hound._   At all seasons of the year Blacky the Crow is something of a traveler. But in winter he is much more of a traveler than in summer. You see, in winter it is not nearly so easy to pick up a living. Food is quite as scarce for Blacky the Crow in winter as for any of the other little people who neither sleep the winter away nor go south. All of the feathered folks have to work and work hard to find food enough to keep them warm. You know it is food that makes heat in the body.  So in the winter Blacky is in the habit of flying long distances in search of food. He often goes some miles from the thick hemlock-tree in the Green Forest where he spends his nights. You may see him starting out early in the morning and returning late in the afternoon.  Now Blacky knew all about that river into which Bowser the Hound had fallen. There was a certain place on that river where Jack Frost never did succeed in making ice. Sometimes things good to eat would be washed up along the edge of this open place. Blacky visited it regularly. He was on the way there now, flying low over the tree-tops.  Presently he came to a little opening among the trees. In the middle of it was a little house, a rough little house. Blacky knew all about it. It was a sugar camp. He knew that only in the spring of the year was he likely to find anybody about there. All the rest of the year it was shut up. Every time he passed that way Blacky flew over it. Blacky's eyes are very sharp indeed, as everybody knows. Now, as he drew near, he noticed right away that the door was partly open. It hadn't been that way the last time he passed.  \"Ho!\" exclaimed Blacky. \"I wonder if the wind blew that open, or if there is some one inside. I think I'll watch a while.\"  So Blacky flew to the top of a tall tree from which he could look all over the little clearing and could watch the door of the little house.  For a long time he sat there as silent as the trees themselves. Nothing happened. He began to grow tired. Rather, he began to grow so hungry that he became impatient. \"If there is anybody in there he must be asleep,\" muttered Blacky to himself. \"I'll see if I can wake him up. Caw, caw, ca-a-w, caw, caw!\"  Blacky waited a few minutes, then repeated his cry. He did this three times and had just made up his mind that there was nobody inside that little house when a head appeared in the doorway. Blacky was so surprised that he nearly fell from his perch.  \"As I live,\" he muttered, \"that is Bowser the Hound! It certainly is. Now what is he doing way over here? I've never known him to go so far from home before.\"     CHAPTER VII  BLACKY THE CROW TAKES PITY ON BOWSER      Beneath a coat of ebon hue     May beat a heart that's kind and true.
