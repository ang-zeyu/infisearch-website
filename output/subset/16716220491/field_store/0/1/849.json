Do stop him!\" cried the lady.  \"Whoa!\" said Bobby, in gentle tones, as he patted the trembling horse on his neck.  \"Whoa, good horse!  Be quiet!  Whoa!\"  The animal, in his terror, kept running backward and forward; but Bobby persevered in his gentle treatment, and finally soothed him, so that he stood quiet enough for the lady to get out of the chaise.  \"What a miracle that I am alive!\" exclaimed she when she realized that she stood once more upon the firm earth.  \"Yes, ma'am, it is lucky he didn't break the chaise.  Whoa!  Good horse!  Stand quiet!\"  \"What a brave little fellow you are!\" said the lady, as soon as she could recover her breath so as to express her admiration of Bobby's bold act.  \"O, I don't mind it,\" replied he, blushing like a rose in June.  \"Did he run away with you?\"  \"No; my father left me in the chaise for a moment while he went into a store in the village, and a teamster who was passing by snapped his whip, which frightened Kate so that she started off at the top of her speed.  I was so terrified, that I screamed with all my might, which frightened her the more.  The more I screamed, the faster she ran.\"  \"I dare say.  Good horse!  Whoa, Kate!\"  \"She is a splendid creature; she never did such a thing before.  My father will think I am killed.\"  By this time, Kate had become quite reasonable, and seemed very much obliged to Bobby for preventing her from doing mischief to her mistress; for she looked at the lady with a glance of satisfaction, which her deliverer interpreted as a promise to behave better in future.  He relaxed his grasp upon the bridle, patted her upon the neck, and said sundry pleasant things to encourage her in her assumed purpose of doing better.  Kate appeared to understand Bobby's kind words, and declared as plainly as a horse could declare that she would be sober and tractable.  \"Now, ma'am, if you will get into the chaise again, I think Kate will let me drive her down to the village.\"  \"O, dear!  I should not dare to do so.\"  \"Then, if you please, I will drive down alone, so as to let your father know that you are safe.\"  \"Do.\"  \"I am sure he must feel very bad, and I may save him a great deal of pain, for a man can suffer a great deal in a very short time.\"  \"You are a little philosopher, as well as a hero, and if you are not afraid of Kate, you may do as you wish.\"  \"She seems very gentle now;\" and Bobby turned her round, and got into the chaise.  \"Be very careful,\" said the lady.  \"I will.\"  Bobby took the reins, and Kate, true to the promise she had virtually made, started off at a round pace towards the village.  He had not gone more than a quarter of a mile of the distance when he met a wagon containing three men, one of whom was the lady's father. The gestures which he made assured Bobby he had found the person whom he sought, and he stopped.  \"My daughter!  Where is she?\" gasped the gentleman, as he leaped from the wagon.  \"She is safe, sir,\" replied Bobby, with all the enthusiasm of his warm nature.  \"Thank God!\" added the gentleman, devoutly as he placed himself in the chaise by the side of Bobby.     CHAPTER II.  IN WHICH BOBBY BLUSHES SEVERAL TIMES, AND DOES A SUM IN ARITHMETIC.  Mr. Bayard, the owner of the horse, and the father of the lady whom Bobby had saved from impending death, was too much agitated to say much, even to the bold youth who had rendered him such a signal service.  He could scarcely believe the intelligence which the boy brought him; it seemed too good to be true.  He had assured himself that Ellen--for that was the young lady's name--was killed, or dreadfully injured.  Kate was driven at the top of her speed, and in a few moments reached the bridge, where Ellen was awaiting his arrival.  \"Here I am, father, alive and unhurt!\" cried Ellen, as Mr. Bayard stopped the horse.  \"Thank Heaven my child!\" replied the glad father, embracing his daughter.  \"I was sure you were killed.\"  \"No, father; thanks to this bold youth, I am uninjured.\"  \"I am under very great obligations to you, young man,\" continued Mr. Bayard, grasping Bobby's hand.  \"O, never mind, sir;\" and Bobby blushed just as he had blushed when the young lady spoke to him.  \"We shall never forget you--shall we, father?\" added Ellen.  \"No, my child; and I shall endeavor to repay, to some slight extent, our indebtedness to him.  But you have not yet told me how you were saved.\"  \"O, I merely stopped the horse; that's all,\" answered Bobby, modestly.  \"Yes, father, but he placed himself right before Kate when she was almost flying over the ground.  When I saw him, I was certain that he would lose his life, or be horribly mangled for his boldness,\" interposed Ellen.  \"It was a daring deed, young man, to place yourself before an affrighted horse in that manner,\" said Mr. Bayard.  \"I didn't mind it, sir.\"  \"And then he flourished a big club, almost as big as he is himself, in the air, which made Kate pause in her mad career, when my deliverer here grasped her by the bit and held her.\"  \"It was well and bravely done.\"  \"That it was, father; not many men would have been bold enough to do what he did,\" added Ellen, with enthusiasm.  \"Very true; and I feel, that I am indebted to him for your safety. What is your name, young man?\"  \"Robert Bright, sir.\"  Mr. Bayard took from his pocket several pieces of gold, which he offered to Bobby.  \"No, I thank you, sir,\" replied Bobby, blushing.  \"What! as proud as you are bold?\"  \"I don't like to be paid for doing my duty.\"  \"Bravo!  You are a noble little fellow!  But you must take this money, not as a reward for what you have done, but as a testimonial of my gratitude.\"  \"I would rather not, sir.\"  \"Do take it, Robert,\" added Ellen.  \"I don't like to take it.  It looks mean to take money for doing one's duty.\"  \"Take it, Robert, to please me;\" and the young lady smiled so sweetly that Bobby's resolution began to give way.  \"Only to please me, Robert.\"  \"I will, to please you; but I don't feel right about it.\"  \"You must not be too proud, Robert,\" said Mr. Bayard, as he put the gold pieces into his hand.  \"I am not proud, sir; only I don't like to be paid for doing my duty.\"  \"Not paid, my young friend.  Consider that you have placed me under an obligation to you for life.  This money is only an expression of my own and my daughter's feelings.  It is but a small sum, but I hope you will permit me to do something more for you, when you need it.  You will regard me as your friend as long as you live.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  \"When you want any assistance of any kind, come to me.  I live in Boston; here is my business card.\"  Mr. Bayard handed him a card, on which Bobby read, \"F. Bayard & Co., Booksellers and Publishers, No. ---- Washington Street, Boston.\"  \"You are very kind, sir.\"  \"I want you should come to Boston and see us too,\" interposed Ellen. \"I should be delighted to show you the city, to take you to the Athenaeum and the Museum.\"  \"Thank you.\"  Mr. Bayard inquired of Bobby about his parents, where he lived, and about the circumstances of his family.  He then took out his memorandum book, in which he wrote the boy's name and residence.  \"I am sorry to leave you now, Robert, but I have over twenty miles to ride to-day.  I should be glad to visit your mother, and next time I come to Riverdale, I shall certainly do so.\"  \"Thank you, sir; my mother is a very poor woman, but she will be glad to see you.\"  \"Now, good by, Robert.\"  \"Good by,\" repeated Ellen.  \"Good by.\"  Mr. Bayard drove off, leaving Bobby standing on the bridge with the gold pieces in his hand.  \"Here's luck!\" said Bobby, shaking the coin.  \"Won't mother's eyes stick out when she sees these shiners?  There are no such shiners in the river as these.\"  Bobby was astonished, and the more he gazed at the gold pieces, the more bewildered he became.  He had never held so much money in his hand before.  There were three large coins and one smaller one.  He turned them over and over, and finally ascertained that the large coins were ten dollar pieces, and the smaller one a five dollar piece.  Bobby was not a great scholar, but he knew enough of arithmetic to calculate the value of his treasure.  He was so excited, however, that he did not arrive at the conclusion half so quick as most of my young readers would have done.  \"Thirty-five dollars!\" exclaimed Bobby, when the problem was solved. \"Gracious!\"  \"Hallo, Bob!\" shouted Tom Spicer, who had got tired of fishing; besides, the village clock was just striking twelve, and it was time for him to go home.  Bobby made no answer, but hastily tying the gold pieces up in the corner of his handkerchief, he threw the broken rail he had used in stopping the horse where it belonged, and started for the place where he had left his fishing apparatus.  \"Hallo, Bob!\"  \"Well, Tom?\"  \"Stopped him--didn't you?\"  \"I did.\"  \"You were a fool; he might have killed you.\"  \"So he might; but I didn't stop to think of that.  The lady's life was in danger.\"  \"What of that?\"  \"Every thing, I should say.\"  \"Did he give you any thing?\"  \"Yes;\" and Bobby continued his walk down to the river's side.  \"I say, what did he give you, Bobby?\" persisted Tom, following him.  \"O, he gave me a good deal of money.\"  \"How much?\"  \"I want to get my fish line now; I will tell you all about it some other time,\" replied Bobby, who rather suspected the intentions of his companion.  \"Tell me now; how much was it?\"  \"Never mind it now.\"  \"Humph!  Do you think I mean to rob you?\"  \"No.\"  \"Ain't you going halveses?\"  \"Why should I?\"  \"Wasn't I with you?\"  \"Were you?\"  \"Wasn't I fishing with you?\"  \"You did not do any thing about stopping the horse.\"  \"I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14762"],["title","Now or Never; Or, The Adventures of Bobby Bright: A Story for Young Folks (#2)"],["body",", if I hadn't been afraid to go up to the road.\"  \"Afraid?\"  \"Somebody might have seen me, and they would have known that I was hooking jack.\"  \"Then you ought not to share the money.\"  \"Yes, I had.  When a fellow is with you, he ought to have half.  It is mean not to give him half.\"  \"If you had done any thing to help stop the horse, I would have shared with you.  But you didn't.\"  \"What of that?\"  Bobby was particularly sensitive in regard to the charge of meanness. His soul was a great deal bigger than his body, and he was always generous, even to his own injury, among his companions.  It was evident to him that Tom had no claim to any part of the reward; but he could not endure the thought even of being accused of meanness.  \"I'll tell you what I will do, if you think I ought to share with you. I will leave it out to Squire Lee; and if he thinks you ought to have half, or any part of the money, I will give it to you.\"  \"No, you don't; you want to get me into a scrape for hooking jack.  I see what you are up to.\"  \"I will state the case to him without telling him who the boys are.\"  \"No, you don't!  You want to be mean about it.  Come, hand over half the money.\"  \"I will not,\" replied Bobby, who, when it became a matter of compulsion, could stand his ground at any peril.  \"How much have you got?\"  \"Thirty-five dollars.\"  \"By jolly!  And you mean to keep it all yourself?\"  \"I mean to give it to my mother.\"  \"No, you won't!  If you are going to be mean about it, I'll smash your head!\"  This was a favorite expression with Tom Spicer, who was a noted bully among the boys of Riverdale.  The young ruffian now placed himself in front of Bobby, and shook his clinched fist in his face.  \"Hand over.\"  \"No, I won't.  You have no claim to any part at the money; at least, I think you have not.  If you have a mind to leave it out to Squire Lee, I will do what is right about it.\"  \"Not I; hand over, or I'll smash your head!\"  \"Smash away,\" replied Bobby, placing himself on the defensive.  \"Do you think you can lick me?\" asked Tom, not a little embarrassed by this exhibition of resolution on the part of his companion.  \"I don't think any thing about it; but you don't bully me in that kind of style.\"  \"Won't I?\"  \"No.\"  But Tom did not immediately put his threat in execution, and Bobby would not be the aggressor; so he stepped one side to pass his assailant.  Tom took this as an evidence of the other's desire to escape, and struck him a heavy blow on the side of the head The next instant the bully was floundering in the soft mud of a ditch; Bobby's reply was more than Tom had bargained for, and while he was dragging himself out of the ditch, our hero ran down to the river, and got his fish pole and basket.  \"You'll catch it for that!\" growled Tom.  \"I'm all ready, whenever it suits your convenience,\" replied Bobby.  \"Just come out here and take it in fair fight,\" continued Tom, who could not help bullying, even in the midst of his misfortune.  \"No, I thank you; I don't want to fight with any fellow.  I will not fight if I can help it.\"  \"What did you hit me for, then?\"  \"In self-defence.\"  \"Just come out here, and try it fair?\"  \"No;\" and Bobby hurried home, leaving the bully astonished, and discomfited by the winding up of the morning's sport.     CHAPTER III.  IN WHICH THE LITTLE BLACK HOUSE IS BOUGHT BUT NOT PAID FOR.  Probably my young readers have by this time come to the conclusion that Bobby Bright was a very clever fellow--one whose acquaintance they would be happy to cultivate.  Perhaps by this time they have become so far interested in him as to desire to know who his parents were, what they did, and in what kind of a house he lived.  I hope none of my young friends will think any less of him when I inform them that Bobby lived in an old black house which had never been painted, which had no flower garden in front of it, and which, in a word, was quite far from being a palace.  A great many very nice city folks would not have considered it fit to live in, would have turned up their noses at it, and wondered that any human beings could be so degraded as to live in such a miserable house.  But the widow Bright, Bobby's mother, thought it was a very comfortable house, and considered herself very fortunate in being able to get so good a dwelling.  She had never lived in a fine house, knew nothing about velvet carpets, mirrors seven feet high, damask chairs and lounges, or any of the smart things which very rich and very proud city people consider absolutely necessary for their comfort.  Her father had been a poor man, her husband had died a poor man, and her own life had been a struggle to keep the demons of poverty and want from invading her humble abode.  Mr. Bright, her deceased husband, had been a day laborer in Riverdale. He never got more than a dollar a day, which was then considered very good wages in the country.  He was a very honest, industrious man, and while he lived, his family did very well.  Mrs. Bright was a careful, prudent woman, and helped him support the family.  They never knew what it was to want for any thing.  Poor people, as well as rich, have an ambition to be something which they are not, or to have something which they have not.  Every person, who has an energy of character, desires to get ahead in the world. Some merchants, who own big ships and big warehouses by the dozen, desire to be what they consider rich.  But their idea of wealth is very grand.  They wish to count it in millions of dollars, in whole blocks of warehouses; and they are even more discontented than the day laborer who has to earn his dinner before he can eat it.  Bobby's father and mother had just such an ambition, only it was so modest that the merchant would have laughed at it.  They wanted to own the little black house in which they resided, so that they could not only be sure of a home while they lived, but have the satisfaction of living in their own house.  This was a very reasonable ideal, compared with that of the rich merchants I have mentioned; but it was even more difficult for them to reach it, for the wages were small, and they had many mouths to feed.  Mr. Bright had saved up fifty dollars; and he thought a great deal more of this sum than many people do of a thousand dollars.  He had had to work very hard and be very prudent in order to accumulate this sum, which made him value it all the more highly.  With this sum of fifty dollars at his command, John Bright felt rich; and then, more than ever before, he wanted to own the little black house.  He felt as grand as a lord; and as soon as the forty-nine dollars had become fifty, he waited upon Mr. Hardhand, a little crusty old man, who owned the little black house, and proposed to purchase it.  The landlord was a hard man.  Every body in Riverdale said he was mean and stingy.  Any generous-hearted man would have been willing to make an easy bargain with an honest, industrious, poor man, like John Bright, who wished to own the house in which he lived; but Mr. Hardhand, although he was rich, only thought how he could make more money.  He asked the poor man four hundred dollars for the old house and the little lot of land on which it stood.  It was a matter of great concern to John Bright.  Four hundred dollars was a \"mint of money,\" and he could not see how he should ever be able to save so much from his daily earnings.  So he talked with Squire Lee about it, who told him that three hundred was all it was worth.  John offered this for it, and after a month's hesitation, Mr. Hardhand accepted the offer, agreeing to take fifty dollars down and the rest in semi-annual payments of twenty-five dollars each, until the whole was paid.  I am thus particular in telling my readers about the bargain, because this debt which his father contracted was the means of making a man of Bobby, as will be seen in his subsequent history.  John Bright paid the first fifty dollars; but before the next instalment became due, the poor man was laid in his cold and silent grave.  A malignant disease carried him off, and the hopes of the Bright family seemed to be blasted.  Four children were left to the widow.  The youngest was only three years old, and Bobby, the oldest, was nine, when his father died. Squire Lee, who had always been a good friend of John Bright, told the widow that she had better go to the poorhouse, and not attempt to struggle along with such a fearful odds against her.  But the widow nobly refused to become a pauper, and to make paupers of her children, whom she loved quite as much as though she and they had been born in a ducal palace.  She told the squire that she had two hands, and as long as she had her health, the town need not trouble itself about her support.  Squire Lee was filled with surprise and admiration at the noble resolution of the poor woman; and when he returned to his house, he immediately sent her a cord of wood, ten bushels of potatoes, two bags of meal, and a firkin of salt pork.  The widow was very grateful for these articles, and no false pride prevented her from accepting the gift of her rich and kind-hearted neighbor.  Riverdale centre was largely engaged in the manufacturing of boots and shoes, and this business gave employment to a large number of men and women.  Mrs. Bright had for several years \"closed\" shoes--which, my readers who do not live in \"shoe towns\" may not know, means sewing or stitching them.  To this business she applied herself with renewed energy.  There was a large hotel in Riverdale centre, where several families from Boston spent the summer.  By the aid of Squire Lee, she obtained the washing of these families, which was more profitable than closing shoes.  By these means she not only supported her family very comfortably, but was able to save a little money towards paying for the house.  Mr. Hardhand, by the persuasions of Squire Lee, had consented to let the widow keep the house, and pay for it as she could.  John "]]]
