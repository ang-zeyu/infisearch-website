By his natural temper he was quick of resentment; but by his established and habitual practice, he was gentle, modest, and inoffensive. His tenderness appeared in his attention to children, and to the poor. To the poor, while he lived in the family of his friend, he allowed the third part of his annual revenue, though the whole was not a hundred a year; and for children, he condescended to lay aside the scholar, the philosopher, and the wit, to write little poems of devotion, and systems of instruction adapted to their wants and capacities, from the dawn of reason through its gradations of advance in the morning of life. Every man, acquainted with the common principles of human action, will look with veneration on the writer who is at one time combating Locke, and at another making a catechism for children in their fourth year. A voluntary descent from the dignity of science is perhaps the hardest lesson that humility can teach.  As his mind was capacious, his curiosity excursive, and his industry continual, his writings are very numerous, and his subjects various. With his theological works I am only enough acquainted to admire his meekness of opposition, and his mildness of censure. It was not only in his book but in his mind that _orthodoxy_ was _united_ with _charity_.  Of his philosophical pieces, his Logic has been received into the universities, and therefore wants no private recommendation: if he owes part of it to Le Clerc, it must he considered that no man who undertakes merely to methodize or illustrate a system, pretends to be its author.  In his metaphysical disquisitions, it was observed by the late learned Dr. Dyer, that he confounded the idea of _space_ with that of _empty space_, and did not consider that though space might be without matter, yet matter being extended, could not be without space.  Few books have been perused by me with greater pleasure than his _Improvement of the Mind_, of which the radical principles may indeed be found in _Locke's Conduct of the Understanding_, but they are so expanded and ramified by Watts, as to confer upon him the merit of a work in the highest degree useful and pleasing. Whoever has the care of instructing others, may be charged with deficience in his duty if this book is not recommended.  I have mentioned his treatises of Theology as distinct from his other productions: but the truth is, that whatever he took in hand was, by his incessant solicitude for souls, converted to Theology. As piety predominated in his mind, it is diffused over his works: under his direction it may be truly said, _Theologiae Philosophia ancillatur_, philosophy is subservient to evangelical instruction; it is difficult to read a page without learning, or at least wishing to be better. The attention is caught by indirect instruction, and he that sat down only to reason, is on a sudden compelled to pray.  It was therefore with great propriety that, in 1728, he received From Edinburgh and Aberdeen an unsolicited diploma, by which he became a Doctor of Divinity. Academical honours would have more value, if they were always bestowed with equal judgement.  He continued many years to study and to preach, and to do good by His instruction and example: till at last the infirmities of age disabled him from the more laborious part of his ministerial functions, and being no longer capable of public duty, he offered to remit the salary appendant to it; but his congregation would not accept the resignation.  By degrees his weakness increased, and at last confined him to his chamber and his bed; where he was worn gradually away without pain, till he expired, Nov. 25, 1748, in the seventy-fifth year of his age.  Few men have left behind such purity of character, or such monuments of laborious piety. He has provided instruction for all ages, from those who are lisping their first lessons, to the enlightened readers of Malbranche and Locke; he has left neither corporeal nor spiritual nature unexamined; he has taught the art of reasoning, and the science of the stars.  His character, therefore, must be formed from the multiplicity and diversity of his attainments, rather than from any single performance; for it would not be safe to claim for him the highest rank in any single denomination of literary dignity; yet perhaps there was nothing in which he would not have excelled, if he had not divided his powers to different pursuits.  As a poet, had he been only a poet, he would probably have stood high among the authors with whom he is now associated. For his judgement was exact, and he noted beauties and faults with very nice discernment; his imagination, as the _Dacian Battle_ proves, was vigorous and active, and the stores of knowledge were large by which his fancy was to be supplied. His ear was well-tuned, and his diction was elegant and copious. But his devotional poetry is, like that of others, unsatisfactory. The paucity of its topics enforces perpetual repetition, and the sanctity of the matter rejects the ornaments of figurative diction. It is sufficient for Watts to have done better than others what no man has done well.  His poems on other subjects seldom rise higher than might be expected from the amusements of a Man of Letters, and have different degrees of value as they are more or less laboured, or as the occasion was more or less favourable to invention.  He writes too often without regular measures, and too often in blank verse; the rhymes are not always sufficiently correspondent. He is particularly unhappy in coining names expressive of characters. His lines are commonly smooth and easy, and his thoughts always religiously pure; but who is there that, to so much piety and innocence, does not wish for a greater measure of sprightliness and vigour? He is at least one of the few poets with whom youth and ignorance may be safely pleased; and happy will be that reader whose mind is disposed by his verses, or his prose, to imitate him in all but his non-conformity, to copy his benevolence to man, and his reverence to God.    PREFACE.  THE following extract from the Doctor's Preface, as it contains the plan of his version of the Psalms, may be found useful:  \"I come therefore to explain my own design, which is this, To accommodate the book of Psalms to Christian worship. And in order to do this, it is necessary to divest David and Asaph, &c. of every other character but that of a psalmist and a saint, and to make them always speak the common sense, and language of a Christian.  \"Attempting the work with this view, I have entirely omitted several whole psalms, and large pieces of many others; and have chosen out of all of them, such parts only as might easily and naturally be accommodated to the various occasions of the Christian life, or at least might afford us some beautiful allusion to Christian affairs. These I have copied and explained in the general style of the gospel; nor have I confined my expressions to any particular party or opinion; that in words prepared for public worship, and for the lips of multitudes, there might not be a syllable offensive to sincere Christians, whose judgments may differ in the lesser matters of religion.  \"Where the Psalmist uses sharp invectives against his personal enemies, I have endeavoured to turn the edge of them against our spiritual adversaries, sin, Satan, and temptation. Where the flights of his faith and love are sublime, I have often sunk the expressions within the reach of an ordinary Christian: where the words imply some peculiar wants or distresses, joys, or blessings, I have used words of greater latitude and comprehension, suited to the general circumstances of men.  \"Where the original runs in the form of prophecy concerning Christ and his salvation, I have given an historical turn to the sense: there is no necessity that we should always sing in the obscure and doubtful style of prediction, when the things foretold are brought into open light by a full accomplishment. Where the writers of the New Testament have cited or alluded to any part the Psalms, I have often indulged the liberty of paraphrase, according to the words of Christ, or his Apostles. And surely this may be esteemed the word of God still, though borrowed from several parts of the Holy Scripture. Where the Psalmist describes religion by the fear of God, I have often joined faith and love to it. Where he speaks of the pardon of sin, through the mercies of God, I have added the merits of a Saviour. Where he talks of sacrificing goats or bullocks, I rather chuse to mention the sacrifice of Christ, the Lamb of God. When he attends the ark with shouting into Zion, I sing the ascension of my Saviour into heaven, or his presence in his church on earth. Where he promises abundance of wealth, honour, and long life, I have changed some of these typical blessings for grace, glory, and life eternal, which are brought to light by the gospel, and promised in the New Testament. And I am fully satisfied, that more honor is done to our blessed Saviour, by speaking his name, his graces, and actions, in his own language, according to the brighter discoveries he hath now made, than by going back again to the Jewish forms of worship, and the language of types and figures.\"   Of chusing or finding the Psalm.  By consulting the Index at the end, any one may find hymns very proper for many occasions of the Christian life and worship; though no copy of David's Psalter can provide for all, as I have shewn in the Preface to the large edition.  Or, if he remembers the first line of any Psalm, the Table of the first lines will direct where to find it.

Of dividing the Psalms.  If the Psalm be too long for the time or custom of singing, there are pauses in many of them at which you may properly rest; or you may leave out those verses which are inclued with crotchets [ ], without disturbing the sense: or, in some places you may begin to sing at the pause.     THE Psalms of David, In Metre.   Psalm 1:1. Common Metre, The way and end of the righteous and the wicked.  1 Blest is the man who shuns the place Where sinners love to meet; Who fears to tread their wicked ways, And hates the scoffer's seat:  2 But in the statutes of the Lord Has plac'd his chief delight; By day he reads or hears the word, And meditates by night.  3 [He like a plant of generous kind, By living waters set, Safe from the storms and blasting wind, Enjoys a peaceful state.]  4 Green as the leaf and ever fair Shall his profession shine, While fruits of holiness appear Like clusters on the vine.  5 Not so the impious and unjust; What vain designs they form! Their hopes are blown away like dust, Or chaff before the storm.  6 Sinners in judgment shall not stand Amongst the sons of grace, When Christ the Judge, at his right hand, Appoints his saints a place.  7 His eye beholds the path they tread, His heart approves it well; But crooked ways of sinners lead Down to the gates of hell.   Psalm 1:2. S. M. The saint happy, the sinner miserable.  1 The man is ever blest Who shuns the sinner's ways, Among their counsels never stands, Nor takes the scorner's place;  2 But makes the Law of God His study and delight, Amidst the labours of the day, And watches of the night.  3 He like a tree shall thrive, With waters near the root: Fresh as the leaf his name shall live, His works are heavenly fruit.  4 Not so th' ungodly race, They no such blessings find; Their hopes shall flee like empty chaff Before the driving wind.  5 How will they bear to stand Before that judgment-seat, Where all the saints at Christ's right hand In full assembly meet?  6 He knows, and he approves The way the righteous go; But sinners and their works shall meet A dreadful overthrow.   Psalm 1:3. L. M. The difference between the righteous and the wicked.  1 Happy the man whose cautious feet Shun the broad way that sinners go, Who hates the place where atheists meet, And fears to talk as scoffers do.  2 He loves t' employ his morning light Amongst the statutes of the Lord: And spends the wakeful hours at night, With pleasure pondering o'er the word.  3 He like a plant by gentle streams, Shall flourish in immortal green; And heaven will shine with kindest beams On every work his hands begin.  4 But sinners find their counsels crost; As chaff before the tempest flies, So shall their hopes be blown and lost, When the last trumpet shakes the skies.  5 In vain the rebel seeks to stand In judgment with the pious race; The dreadful Judge with stern command Divides him to a different place.  6 \"Straight is the way my saints have trod, \"I blest the path and drew it plain; \"But you would choose the crooked road, \"And down it leads to endless pain.   Psalm 2:1. S. M. Translated according to the divine pattern, Acts iv. 24 &c.  Christ dying, rising, interceding, and reigning.  1 [Maker and sovereign Lord Of heaven, and earth, and seas, Thy providence confirms thy word, And answers thy decrees.  2 The things so long foretold By David are fulfill'd, When Jews and Gentiles join to slay Jesus, thine holy child.]  3 Why did the Gentiles rage, And Jews with one accord Bend all their counsels to destroy Th' anointed of the Lord?  4 Rulers and kings agree To form a vain design; Against the Lord their powers unite, Against his Christ they join.  5 The Lord derides their rage, And will support his throne; He that hath rais'd him from the dead Hath own'd him for his Son.  PAUSE.  6 Now he's ascended high, And asks to rule the earth; The merit of his blood be pleads, And pleads his heavenly birth.  7 He asks, and God bestows A large inheritance; Far as the world's remotest ends His kingdom shall advance.  8 The nations that rebel Must feel his iron rod; He'll vindicate those honours well Which he receiv'd from God.  9 [Be wise, ye rulers, now, And worship at his throne; With trembling joy, ye people, bow To God's exalted Son.  10 If once his wrath arise, Ye perish on the place; Then blessed is the soul that flies For refuge to his grace.]  Psalm 2:2. C. M. The same.  1 Why did the nations join to slay The Lord's anointed Son? Why did they cast his laws away, And tread his gospel down?  2 The Lord that sits above the skies, Derides their rage below, He speaks with vengeance in his eyes, And strikes their spirits thro'.  3 \"I call him my Eternal Son, \"And raise him from the dead; \"I make my holy hill his throne, \"And wide his kingdom spread.  4 \"Ask me, my Son, and then enjoy \"The utmost heathen lands: \"Thy rod of iron shall destroy \"The rebel that withstands.\"  5 Be wise, ye rulers of the earth, Obey th' anointed Lord, Adore the king of heavenly birth, And tremble at his word.  6 With humble love address his throne, For if he frown ye die; Those are secure, and those alone, Who on his grace rely.   Psalm 2:3. L. M. Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension.  1 Why did the Jews proclaim their rage? The Romans why their swords employ? Against the Lord their powers engage His dear anointed to destroy?  2 \"Come, let us break his bands,\" they say, \"This man shall never give us laws ;\" And thus they cast his yoke away, And nail'd the monarch to the cross.  3 But God, who high in glory reigns, Laughs at their pride, their rage controls; He'll vex their hearts with inward pains, And speak in thunder to their souls.  4 \"I will maintain the King I made \"On Zion's everlasting hill, \"My hand shall bring him from the dead, \"And he shall stand your sovereign still.\"  5 [His wondrous rising from the earth Makes his eternal Godhead known! The Lord declares his heavenly birth, \"This day have I begot my Son.  6 \"Ascend, my Son, to my right hand, \"There thou shalt ask, and I bestow \"The utmost bounds of heathen lands; \"To thee the northern isles shall bow.\"]  7 But nations that resist his grace Shall fall beneath his iron stroke; His rod shall crush his foes with ease As potters' earthen work is broke.  PAUSE.  8 Now, ye that sit on earthly thrones, Be wise, and serve the Lord, the Lamb; at his feet submit your crowns, Rejoice and tremble at his name.  9 With humble love address the Son, Lest he grow angry and ye die; His wrath will burn to worlds unknown If ye provoke his jealousy.  10 His storms shall drive you quick to hell: He is a God, and ye but dust: Happy the souls that know him well, And make his grace their only trust.   Psalm 3:1. C. M. Doubts and fears supprest; or, God our defence from sin and Satan.  1 My God, how many are my fears! How fast my foes increase! Conspiring my eternal death, They break my present peace.  2 The lying tempter would persuade There's no relief in heaven; And all my swelling sins appear Too big to be forgiven.  3 But thou, my glory and my strength, Shalt on the tempter tread, Shalt silence all my threatening guilt, And raise my drooping head.  4 [I cry'd, and from his holy hill He bow'd a listening ear, I call'd my Father, and my God, And he subdu'd my fear.  5 He shed soft slumbers on mine eyes, In spite of all my foes; I woke, and wonder'd at the grace That guarded my repose.]  6 What though the hosts of death and hell All arm'd against me stood, Terrors no more shall shake my soul, My refuge is my God.  7 Arise, O Lord, fulfil thy grace, While I thy glory sing: My God has broke the serpent's teeth, And death has lost his sting.  8 Salvation to the Lord belongs, His arm alone can save; Blessings attend thy people here, And reach beyond the grave.   Psalm 3:2. 1 2 3 4 5 8. L. M. A morning Psalm.  1 O Lord, how many are my foes, In this weak state of flesh and blood! My peace they daily discompose, But my defence and hope is God.  2 Tir'd with the burdens of the day, To thee I rais'd an evening cry; Thou heardst when I began to pray, And thine almighty help was nigh.  3 Supported by thine heavenly aid, I laid me down and slept secure; Not death should make my heart afraid, Tho' I should wake and rise no more.  4 But God sustain'd me all the night; Salvation doth to God belong; He rais'd my head to see the light, And make his praise my morning song.   Psalm 4:1. 1 2 3 5 6 7. L. M. Hearing prayer; or, God our portion, and Christ our hope.  1 O God of grace and righteousness, Hear and attend when I complain; Thou hast enlarg'd me in distress, Bow down a gracious ear again.  2 Ye sons of men, in vain ye try To turn my glory into shame; How long will scoffers love to lie, And dare reproach my Saviour's name!  3 Know that the Lord divides his saints From all the tribes of men beside; He hears the cry of penitents For the dear sake of Christ that dy'd.  4 When our obedient hands have done A thousand works of righteousness, We put our trust in God alone, And glory in his pardoning grace.  5 Let the unthinking many say, \"Who will bestow some earthly good?\" But, Lord, thy light and love we pray, Our souls desire this heavenly food.  6 Then shall my cheerful powers rejoice At grace and favour so divine; Nor will I change my happy choice For all their corn and all their wine.   Psalm 4:2. 3 4 5 8. C. M. An evening Psalm.  1 Lord, thou wilt hear me when I pray I am for ever thine: I fear before thee all the day, Nor would I dare to sin.  2 And while I rest my weary head From cares and business free, 'Tis sweet conversing on my bed With my own heart and thee.  3 I pay this evening sacrifice; And when my work is done, Great God, my faith and hope relies Upon thy grace alone.  4 Thus with my thoughts compos'd to peace I'll give mine eyes to sleep; Thy hand in safety keeps my days, And will my slumbers keep.   Psalm 5. For the Lord's day morning.  1 Lord, "]]]
