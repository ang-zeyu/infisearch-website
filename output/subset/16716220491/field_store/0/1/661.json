The thought came to him at once:  \"She cannot live.\"  He found it difficult to repress a rising sob, but he did so for his mother's sake. He thought that it might affect her injuriously if he should display emotion.  His mother smiled faintly as he approached the bed.  \"Mother,\" said Frank, kneeling by the bedside, \"are you very weak?\"  \"Yes, Frank,\" she answered, almost in a whisper. \"I think I am going to leave you.\"  \"Oh, don't say that, mother!\" burst forth in anguish from Frank's lips. \"Try to live for my sake.\"  \"I should like to live, my dear boy,\" whispered his mother; \"but if it is God's will that I should die, I must be reconciled. I leave you in his care.\"  Here Mr. Manning entered the room.  \"You will be kind to my boy?\" said the dying mother.  \"Can you doubt it, my dear?\" replied her husband, in the soft tones Frank so much disliked. \"I will care for him as if he were my own.\"  \"Thank you. Then I shall die easy.\"  \"Don't speak any more, mother. It will tire you, and perhaps bring on another hemorrhage.\"  \"Frank is right, my dear. You had better not exert yourself any more at present.\"  \"Didn't Mark come with you?\" asked Mr. Manning of Frank.  \"No, sir.\"  \"I am surprised that he should not have done so. I sent for him as well as you.\"  \"I believe he is coming by the next train,\" said Frank, indifferently. \"He thought he could not get ready in time for my train.\"  \"He should not have left you to come at such a time.\"  \"I didn't wish him to inconvenience himself, Mr. Manning. If it had been his mother, it would have been different.\"  Mr. Manning did not reply. He understood very well that there was no love lost between Mark and his stepson.     CHAPTER III  FRANK'S BEREAVEMENT   Early in the evening Mark made his appearance. Supper had been over for an hour, and everything was cold. In a house where there is sickness, the regular course of things is necessarily interrupted, and, because he could not have his wants attended to immediately, Mark saw fit to grumble and scold the servants. He was not a favorite with them, and they did not choose to be bullied.  Deborah, who had been in the house for ten years, and so assumed the independence of an old servant, sharply reprimanded the spoiled boy.  \"You ought to be ashamed, Mr. Mark,\" she said, \"of making such a fuss when my poor mistress lies upstairs at the point of death.\"  \"Do you know who you are talking to?\" demanded Mark, imperiously, for he could, when speaking with those whom he regarded as inferiors, exchange his soft tones for a voice of authority.  \"I ought to know by this time,\" answered Deborah, contemptuously. \"There is no other in the house like you, I am glad to say.\"  \"You are very impertinent. You forget that you are nothing but a servant.\"  \"A servant has the right to be decently treated, Mr. Mark.\"  \"If you don't look out,\" said Mark, in a blustering tone, \"I will report you to my father, and have you kicked out of the house.\"  Deborah was naturally incensed at this rude speech, but she was spared the trouble of replying. Frank entered the room at this moment in time to hear Mark's last speech.  \"What is this about being kicked out of the house?\" he asked, looking from Mark to Deborah, in a tone of unconscious authority, which displeased his stepbrother.  \"That is my business,\" replied Mark, shortly.  \"Mr. Mark has threatened to have me kicked out of the house because he has to wait for his supper,\" said Deborah.  \"It wasn't for that. It was because you were impertinent. All the same, I think it is shameful that I can't get anything to eat.\"  \"I regret, Mark,\" said Frank, with cool sarcasm, \"that you should be inconvenienced about your meals. Perhaps you will excuse it, as my poor mother is so sick that she requires extra attention from the servants. Deborah, if possible, don't let Mark wait much longer. It seems to be very important that he should have his supper.\"  \"He shall have it,\" assured Deborah, rather enjoying the way in which Mark was put down; \"that is, if he don't get me kicked out of the house.\"  \"You had better not make any such threats in the future, Mark,\" said Frank, significantly.  \"Who's to hinder?\" blustered Mark.  \"I am,\" answered Frank, pointedly.  \"You are nothing but a boy like me,\" retorted Mark.  \"My mother is mistress here, and I represent her.\"  \"Things may change soon,\" muttered Mark; but Frank had left the room and did not hear him.  Mark did not trouble himself even to inquire for his stepmother, but went out to the stable and lounged about until bedtime. He seemed very much bored, and so expressed himself.  Frank wished to sit up all night with his mother, but, as she had a professional nurse, it was thought best that he should obtain his regular rest, the nurse promising to call the family if any change should be apparent in her patient's condition.  About half-past four in the morning there was a summons.  \"Mrs. Manning is worse,\" said the nurse. \"I don't think she can last long.\"  One last glance of love--though she could no longer speak--assured Frank that she knew him and loved him to the last.  The memory of that look often came back to him in the years that followed, and he would not have parted with it for anything that earth could give.  Just as the clock struck five, his mother breathed her last. The boy gazed upon the inanimate form, but he was dazed, and could not realize that his mother had left him, never to return.  \"She is gone,\" said Mr. Manning, softly.  \"Dead!\" ejaculated Frank.  \"Yes, her sufferings are over. Let us hope she is better off. My boy, I think you had better return to your bed. You can do nothing for your mother now.\"  \"I would rather stay here,\" said Frank, sadly. \"I can at least look at her, and soon I shall lose even that comfort.\"  The thought was too much for the poor boy, and he burst into tears.  \"Do as you please, Frank,\" assented Mr. Manning. \"I feel for you, and I share in your grief. I will go and tell Mark of our sad loss.\"  He made his way to Mark's chamber and entered. He touched Mark, who was in a doze, and he started up.  \"What's the matter?\" he asked, crossly.  \"Your poor mother is dead, Mark.\"  \"Well, there was no need to wake me for that,\" said the boy, irritably. \"I can't help it, can I?\"  \"I think, my son, you might speak with more feeling. Death is a solemn thing.\"  \"There's nobody here but me,\" said Mark, sneering.  \"I don't catch your meaning,\" said his father, showing some annoyance, for it is not pleasant to be seen through.  \"Why should you care so much?\" continued Mark. \"I suppose you will be well provided for. Do you know how she has left the property? How much of it goes to Frank?\"  \"I can't say,\" said Mr. Manning. \"I never asked my wife.\"  \"Do you mean to say, father, that you don't know how the property is left?\" asked Mark, with a sharp glance at his father.  \"I may have my conjectures,\" said Mr. Manning, softly. \"I don't think my dear wife would leave me without some evidences of her affection. Probably the bulk of the estate goes to your brother, and something to me. Doubtless we shall continue to live here, as I shall naturally be your brother's guardian.\"  \"Don't call him my brother,\" said Mark.  \"Why not? True, he is only your stepbrother; but you have lived under the same roof, and been to school together, and this ought to strengthen the tie between you.\"  \"I don't like Frank,\" said Mark. \"He puts on altogether too many airs.\"  \"I had not observed that,\" said his father.  \"Well, I have. Only this evening he saw fit to speak impudently to me.\"  \"Indeed! I am really amazed to hear it,\" said Mr. Manning, softly.  \"Oh, he thinks he is the master of the house, or will be,\" said Mark, \"and he presumes on that.\"  \"He is unwise,\" said Mr. Manning. \"Even if the whole property descends to him, which I can hardly believe possible, I, as his guardian, will have the right to control him.\"  \"I hope you'll do it, father. At any rate, don't let him boss over me, for I won't stand it.\"  \"I don't think he will boss over you,\" answered his father, in a slow, measured voice, betraying, however, neither anger nor excitement. \"Of course, I should not permit that.\"  Mark regarded his father fixedly.  \"I guess the old man knows what's in the will,\" he said to himself. \"He knows how to feather his own nest. I hope he's feathered mine, too.\"  Mr. Manning passed from his son's chamber and went softly upstairs, looking thoughtful.  Anyone who could read the impassive face would have read trouble in store for Frank.     CHAPTER IV  MRS. MANNING'S WILL   During the preparations for the funeral Frank was left pretty much to himself.  Mr. Manning's manner was so soft, and to him had been so deferential, that he did not understand the man. It didn't occur to him that it was assumed for a purpose.  That manner was not yet laid aside. His stepfather offered to comfort him, but Frank listened in silence. Nothing that Mr. Manning could say had the power to lighten his load of grief. So far as words could console him, the sympathy of Deborah and the coachman, both old servants, whom his mother trusted, had more effect, for he knew that it was sincere, and that they were really attached to his mother.  Of Mr. Manning he felt a profound distrust, which no words of his could remove.  Meanwhile, Mr. Manning was looking from an upper window down the fine avenue, and his eye ranged from left to right over the ample estate with a glance of self-complacent triumph.  \"All mine at last!\" he said to himself, exultingly. \"What I have been working for has come to pass. Three years ago I was well-nigh penniless, and now I am a rich man. I shall leave Mark the master of a great fortune. I have played my cards well. No one will suspect anything wrong. My wife and I have lived in harmony. There will be little wonder that she has left all to me. There would be, perhaps, but for the manner in which I have taken"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13803"],["title","Making His Way; Or, Frank Courtney's Struggle Upward (#2)"],["body","he shall be mentioned in the will--I mean, of course, in the will I have made for her.\"  He paused, and, touching a spring in the wall, a small door flew open, revealing a shallow recess.  In this recess was a folded paper, tied with a red ribbon.  Mr. Manning opened it, and his eyes glanced rapidly down the page.  \"This is the true will,\" he said to himself. \"I wish I could summon courage to burn it. It would be best out of the way. That, if found out, would make me amenable to the law, and I must run no risk. In this secret recess it will never be found. I will replace it, and the document which I have had prepared will take its place, and no one will be the wiser.\"  On the day after the funeral, the family solicitor and a few intimate friends, who had been invited by Mr. Manning, assembled in the drawing room of the mansion to hear the will read.  Mr. Manning himself notified Frank of the gathering and its object.  He found our hero lying on the bed in his chamber, sad and depressed.  \"I don't like to intrude upon your grief, my dear boy,\" said his stepfather, softly, \"but it is necessary. The last will of your dear mother and my beloved wife is about to be read, and your presence is necessary.\"  \"Couldn't it be put off?\" asked Frank, sadly. \"It seems too soon to think of such things.\"  \"Pardon me, my dear Frank, but it is quite needful that there should be an immediate knowledge of the contents of the will, in order that the right person may look after the business interests of the estate. I assure you that it is the invariable custom to read the will immediately after the funeral.\"  \"If that is the custom, and it is necessary, I have nothing to say. When is the will to be read?\"  \"At three o'clock, and it is now two.\"  \"Very well, sir; I will come down in time.\"  \"Of course there can't be much doubt as to the contents of the will,\" pursued Mr. Manning. \"You are doubtless the heir, and as you are a minor, I am probably your guardian. Should such be the case, I hope that the relations between us may be altogether friendly.\"  \"I hope so,\" said Frank, gravely.  At three o'clock the members of the family, with a few outside friends, gathered in the drawing room. The family solicitor, Mr, Ferret, held in his hand what purported to be the last will of Mrs. Manning.  The widowed husband had directed the lawyer to the bureau of the deceased lady as likely to contain her will. It was found without trouble in the topmost drawer.  Deborah and the coachman had speculated as to whether they would be invited to attend at the reading of the will.  Their doubts were set at rest by an invitation from Mr. Manning himself.  \"You were so long in the service of my dear wife,\" he said, \"that it is fitting that you be present at the reading of her will, in which it is quite probable that you may be personally interested.\"  \"He is uncommonly polite, I am sure,\" thought Deborah, disposed for the moment to think more favorably of the man whom she had never been able to like.  \"My friends,\" said the lawyer, after a preliminary cough, \"you are assembled to listen to the will of Mrs. Manning, just deceased. The document which I hold in my hand I believe to be such an instrument. I will now open if for the first time.\"  He untied the ribbon, and began reading the will.  It commenced with the usual formula, and proceeded to a few bequests of trifling amount.  Deborah and Richard Green were each left two hundred dollars, \"as a slight acknowledgment of their faithful service.\"  One or two friends of the family were remembered, but to an inconsiderable extent. Then came the important clause:  \"All the rest and residue of the property of which I may die possessed I leave to my beloved husband, James Manning, whose devoted affection has made happy the last years of my life. Having implicit confidence in his good judgment and kindness of heart, I request him to make proper provision for my dear son Frank, whose happiness I earnestly desire. I hope that he will consent to be guided by the wisdom and experience of his stepfather, who, I am sure, will study his interests and counsel him wisely. In my sorrow at parting with my dear son, it is an unspeakable comfort to me to feel that he will have such a guardian and protector.\"  Frank listened with amazement, which was shared by all present.  Practically, he was disinherited, and left wholly dependent upon his stepfather.     CHAPTER V  DISINHERITED   The contents of the will created general astonishment. There was not one in the room who didn't know the devotion of Mrs. Manning to her son Frank, yet, while speaking of him affectionately, she had treated him, as they considered, most cruelly. Why should she have left such a dangerous power in her husband's hands?  And how was Mr. Manning affected?  He summoned to his face an expression of bewilderment and surprise, and, feeling that all eyes were fixed upon, him, he turned toward the lawyer.  \"Mr. Ferret,\" he said, \"I need hardly say that this will surprises me very much, as I see that it does the friends who are present. Are you sure that there is no codicil?\"  \"I have been unable to discover any, Mr. Manning,\" said the lawyer, gravely, as he scanned the face of the widower keenly.  Mr. Manning applied his handkerchief to his eyes, and seemed overcome by emotion.  \"I knew my dear wife's confidence in me,\" he said, in a tremulous voice, \"but I was not prepared for such a striking manifestation of it.\"  \"Nor I,\" said Mr. Ferret, dryly.  \"Knowing her strong attachment to Frank,\" paused Mr. Manning, \"I feel the full extent and significance of that confidence when she leaves him so unreservedly to my care and guidance. I hope that I may be found worthy of the trust.\"  \"I hope so, sir,\" said Mr. Ferret, who, sharp lawyer as he was, doubted whether all was right, and was willing that Mr. Manning should be made aware of his feeling. \"It is certainly a remarkable proviso, considering the affection which your wife entertained for her son.\"  \"Precisely, Mr. Ferret. It shows how much confidence the dear departed felt in me.\"  \"So far as I can see, the boy is left wholly dependent upon you.\"  \"He shall not regret it!\" said Mr. Manning, fervently. \"I consecrate my life to this sacred trust.\"  \"You acquiesce in the arrangement, then, Mr. Manning?\"  \"I cannot do otherwise, can I?\"  \"There is nothing to prevent your settling the property, or any part of it, on the natural heir, Mr. Manning. You must pardon me for saying that it would have been wiser had your wife so stipulated by will.\"  \"I cannot consent to reverse, or in any way annul, the last wishes of my dear wife,\" said Mr. Manning, hastily. \"It was her arrangement solely, and I hold it sacred. She has put upon me a serious responsibility, from which I shrink, indeed, but which I cannot decline. I will do all in my power to carry out the wishes of my late wife.\"  Mr. Ferret shrugged his shoulders.  \"I am not surprised at your decision, sir,\" he said, coldly. \"Few men would resist the temptation. My duty is discharged with the reading of the will, and I will bid you good-afternoon!\"  Mr. Manning was a crafty man. He knew that the strange will would be discussed, and he thought it best that the discussion should come at once, that it might be the sooner finished.  Deborah, faithful old servant, was in a blaze of indignation.  She went up quickly to Frank, and said:  \"It's a shame, Mr. Frank, so it is!\"  \"If my mother made that will, it is all right,\" said Frank, gravely.  \"But she didn't, Mr. Frank! I know she would never do such a thing. She loved you as the apple of her eye, and she would not cheat you out of your rightful inheritance.\"  \"No more she would, Mr. Frank,\" said the coachman, chiming in.  \"I don't know what to think,\" said Frank. \"It has surprised me very much.\"  \"Surprised you!\" exclaimed Deborah. \"You may well say that. You might have knocked me down with a feather when I heard the property left away from you. Depend upon it, that man knows all about it.\"  \"You mean Mr. Manning?\"  \"To be sure I mean him! Oh, he's managed artfully! I say that for him. He's got it all into his own hands, and you haven't a cent.\"  \"If it was my mother's will I wouldn't complain of that, Deborah. It was hers to do with as she liked, and I know, at any rate, that she loved me.\"  \"There's one thing surprises me,\" said Richard Green. \"If so be as the will isn't genuine, how does it happen that you and I come in for a legacy, Deborah?\"  \"It's meant for a blind,\" answered Deborah. \"Oh, he's the artfulest man!\"  \"You may be right, Deborah. I must say the will sounded all right.\"  \"Maybe it was copied from the mistress' will.\"  This conversation took place in one corner of the room.  It ceased as Mr. Ferret advanced toward the disinherited boy.  \"Frank,\" said he, in a tone of sympathy, \"I am very sorry for the provisions of the will.\"  \"So am I, sir,\" answered our hero. \"It isn't pleasant to be dependent on Mr. Manning.\"  \"Particularly when the whole estate should be yours.\"  \"I wouldn't have minded if half had been left to him, provided I had been left independent of him.\"  \"I appreciate your feelings, Frank. I knew your father, and I am proud to say that he was my friend. I knew your mother well, and I esteemed her highly. I hope you will let me regard myself as your friend also.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Ferret!\" said Frank. \"I am likely to need a friend. I shall remember your kind proposal. I want to ask you one question.\"  \"Ask, and I shall answer.\"  \"Did my mother consult with you about making this will?\"  \"No, Frank.\"  \"Did she ever say anything that would lead you to think she would leave the property as it is left in this will?\"  \"Not a word.\"  \"Was there another will?\"  \"Yes. I wrote her will at her direction more than a year ago. This will is dated only three months since, and, of course, takes precedence of it, even if the other is in existence.\"  \"Can you tell me what were the provisions of the other will?\"  \"A"]]]
