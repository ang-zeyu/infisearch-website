The vendors were of the colours of the rainbow, and were heavily hung with long necklaces of coral or amber, with scarves, with strings of silver coins, with sequinned veils and silks, girt with many dirks and knives, furnished out in concealed pockets with scarabs, bracelets, sandalwood boxes or anything else under the broad canopy of heaven one might or might not desire. Their voices were soft and pleasing, their eyes had the beseeching quality of a good dog's, their anxious and deprecating faces were ready at the slightest encouragement to break out into the friendliest and most intimate of smiles. Wherever we went we were accompanied by a retinue straight out of the Arabian Nights, patiently awaiting the moment when we should tire; should seek out the table of a sidewalk caf√©; and should, in our relaxed mood, be ready to unbend to our royal purchases.  At that moment we were too much interested in the town itself. The tiny shops, with their smiling and insinuating Oriental keepers, were fascinating in their displays of carved woods, jewellery, perfumes, silks, tapestries, silversmiths' work, ostrich feathers, and the like. To either side the main street lay long narrow dark alleys, in which flared single lights, across which flitted mysterious long-robed figures, from which floated stray snatches of music either palpitatingly barbaric or ridiculously modern. There the authority of the straight, soldierly-looking Soudanese policemen ceased, and it was not safe to wander unarmed or alone.  Besides these motley variegations of the East and West, the main feature of the town was the street car. It was an open-air structure of spacious dimensions, as though benches and a canopy had been erected rather haphazard on a small dancing platform. The track is absurdly narrow in gauge; and as a consequence the edifice swayed and swung from side to side. A single mule was attached to it loosely by about ten feet of rope. It was driven by a gaudy ragamuffin in a turban. Various other gaudy ragamuffins lounged largely and picturesquely on the widely spaced benches. Whence it came or whither it went I do not know. Its orbit swung into the main street, turned a corner, and disappeared. Apparently Europeans did not patronize this picturesque wreck, but drove elegantly but mysteriously in small open cabs conducted by totally incongruous turbaned drivers.  We ended finally at an imposing corner hotel, where we dined by an open window just above the level of the street. A dozen upturned faces besought us silently during the meal. At a glance of even the mildest interest a dozen long brown arms thrust the spoils of the East upon our consideration. With us sat a large benign Swedish professor whose erudition was encyclopaedic, but whose kindly humanity was greater. Uttering deep, cavernous chuckles, the professor bargained. A red coral necklace for the moment was the matter of interest. The professor inspected it carefully, and handed it back.  \"I doubt if id iss coral,\" said he simply.  The present owner of the beads went frantic with rapid-fire proof and vociferation. With the swiftness and precision of much repetition he fished out a match, struck it, applied the flame to the alleged coral, and blew out the match; cast the necklace on the pavement, produced mysteriously a small hammer, and with it proceeded frantically to pound the beads. Evidently he was accustomed to being doubted, and carried his materials for proof around with him. Then, in one motion, the hammer disappeared, the beads were snatched up, and again offered, unharmed, for inspection.  \"Are those good tests for genuineness?\" we asked the professor, aside.  \"As to that,\" he replied regretfully, \"I do not know. I know of coral only that is the hard calcareous skeleton of the marine coelenterate polyps; and that this red coral iss called of a sclerobasic group; and other facts of the kind; but I do not know if it iss supposed to resist impact and heat. Possibly,\" he ended shrewdly, \"it is the common imitation which does _not_ resist impact and heat. At any rate they are pretty. How much?\" he demanded of the vendor, a bright-eyed Egyptian waiting patiently until our conference should cease.  \"Twenty shillings,\" he replied promptly.  The professor shook with one of his cavernous chuckles.  \"Too much,\" he observed, and handed the necklace back through the window.  The Egyptian would by no means receive it.  \"Keep! keep!\" he implored, thrusting the mass of red upon the professor with both hands. \"How much you give?\"  \"One shilling,\" announced the professor firmly.  The coral necklace lay on the edge of the table throughout most of our leisurely meal. The vendor argued, pleaded, gave it up, disappeared in the crowd, returned dramatically after an interval. The professor ate calmly, chuckled much, and from time to time repeated firmly the words, \"One shilling.\" Finally, at the cheese, he reached out, swept the coral into his pocket, and laid down two shillings. The Egyptian deftly gathered the coin, smiled cheerfully, and produced a glittering veil, in which he tried in vain to enlist Billy's interest.  For coffee and cigars we moved to the terrace outside. Here an orchestra played, the peoples of many nations sat at little tables, the peddlers, fakirs, jugglers, and fortune-tellers swarmed. A half-dozen postal cards seemed sufficient to set a small boy up in trade, and to imbue him with all the importance and insistence of a merchant with jewels. Other ten-year-old ragamuffins tried to call our attention to some sort of sleight-of-hand with poor downy little chickens. Grave, turbaned, and polite Indians squatted cross-legged at our feet, begging to give us a look into the future by means of the only genuine hall-marked Yogi-ism; a troupe of acrobats went energetically and hopefully through quite a meritorious performance a few feet away; a deftly triumphant juggler did very easily, and directly beneath our watchful eyes, some really wonderful tricks. A butterfly-gorgeous swarm of insinuating smiling peddlers of small things dangled and spread their wares where they thought themselves most sure of attention. Beyond our own little group we saw slowly passing in the lighted street outside the portico the variegated and picturesque loungers. Across the way a phonograph bawled; our stringed orchestra played \"The Dollar Princess;\" from somewhere over in the dark and mysterious alleyways came the regular beating of a tom-tom. The magnificent and picturesque town car with its gaudy ragamuffins swayed by in train of its diminutive mule.  Suddenly our persistent and amusing _entourage_ vanished in all directions. Standing idly at the portico was a very straight, black Soudanese. On his head was the usual red fez; his clothing was of trim khaki; his knees and feet were bare, with blue puttees between; and around his middle was drawn close and smooth a blood-red sash at least a foot and a half in breadth. He made a fine upstanding Egyptian figure, and was armed with pride, a short sheathed club, and a great scorn. No word spoke he, nor command; but merely jerked a thumb towards the darkness, and into the darkness our many-hued horde melted away. We were left feeling rather lonesome!  Near midnight we sauntered down the street to the quay, whence we were rowed to the ship by another turbaned, long-robed figure, who sweetly begged just a copper or so \"for poor boatman.\"  We found the ship in the process of coaling, every porthole and doorway closed, and heavy canvas hung to protect as far as possible the clean decks. Two barges were moored alongside. Two blazing braziers lighted them with weird red and flickering flames. In their depths, cast in black and red shadows, toiled half-guessed figures; from their depths, mounting a single steep plank, came an unbroken procession of natives, naked save for a wisp of cloth around the loins. They trod closely on each other's heels, carrying each his basket atop his head or on one shoulder, mounted a gang-plank, discharged their loads into the side of the ship, and descended again to the depths by way of another plank. The lights flickered across their dark faces, their gleaming teeth and eyes. Somehow the work demanded a heap of screeching, shouting, and gesticulation; but somehow also it went forward rapidly. Dozens of unattached natives lounged about the gunwales with apparently nothing to do but to look picturesque. Shore boats moved into the narrow circle of light, drifted to our gangway, and discharged huge crates of vegetables, sacks of unknown stuffs, and returning passengers. A vigilant police boat hovered near to settle disputes, generally with the blade of an oar. For a long time we leaned over the rail watching them, and the various reflected lights in the water, and the very clear, unwavering stars. Then, the coaling finished, and the portholes once more opened, we turned in.     IV.  SUEZ.   Some time during the night we must have started, but so gently had we slid along it fractional speed that until I raised my head and looked out I had not realized the fact. I saw a high sandbank. This glided monotonously by until I grew tired of looking at it and got up.  After breakfast, however, I found that the sandbank had various attractions all of its own. Three camels laden with stone and in convoy of white-clad figures shuffled down the slope at a picturesque angle. Two cowled women in black, veiled to the eyes in gauze heavily sewn with sequins, barefooted, with massive silver anklets, watched us pass. Hindu workmen in turban and loin-cloth furnished a picturesque note, but did not seem to be injuring themselves by over-exertion. Naked small boys raced us for a short distance. The banks glided by very slowly and very evenly, the wash sucked after us like water in a slough after a duck boat, and the sky above the yellow sand looked extremely blue.  At short and regular intervals, half-way up the miniature sandhills, heavy "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14456"],["title","The Uphill Climb (#1)"],["body","pronounce you man and wife,'\" Ford confessed miserably, his face in his hands again. \"I guess I must have done it, all right.\"  Sandy was kind enough when not otherwise engaged. He got up and put a basin of water on the stove to warm, that Ford might bathe his hurts, and he made him a very creditable drink with lemon and whisky and not too much water.  \"The way I heard it,\" he explained further, \"this lady come to town looking for Frank Ford Cameron, and seen you, and said you was him. So--\"  \"I ain't,\" Ford interrupted indignantly. \"My name's Ford Campbell and I'll lick any darned son-of-a-gun--\"  \"Likely she made a mistake,\" Sandy soothed. \"Frank Ford Cameron, she had you down for, and you went ahead and married her willing enough. Seems like there was some hurry-up reason that she explained to you private. She had the license all made out and brought a preacher down from Garbin. Bill Wright said he overheard you tellin' her you'd do anything to oblige a lady--\"  \"That's the worst of it; I'm always too damned polite when I'm drunk!\" grumbled Ford.  Sandy, looking upon his bruised and distorted countenance and recalling, perhaps, the process by which Ford reached that lamentable condition, made a sound like a diplomatically disguised laugh. \"Not always,\" he qualified mildly.  \"Anyway,\" he went on, \"you sure married her. That's straight goods. Bill Wright and Rock was the witnesses. And if you don't know why you done it--\" Sandy waved his hands to indicate his inability to enlighten Ford. \"Right afterwards you went out to the bar and had another drink--all this takin' place in the hotel dining-room, and Mother McGrew down with neuralagy and not bein' present--and one drink leads to another, you know. I come in then, and the bunch was drinkin' luck to you fast as Sam could push the bottles along. Then you went back to the lady--and if you don't know what took place you can search me--and pretty soon Bill said you'd took her and her grip to the depot. Anyway, when you come back, you wasn't troubled with no attack of politeness!  \"You went in the air with Bill, first,\" continued Sandy, testing with his finger the temperature of the water in the basin, \"and bawled him out something fierce for standing by and seeing you make a break like that without doing something. You licked him--and then Rock bought in because some of your remarks kinda included him too. I d' know,\" said Sandy, scratching his unshaven jaw reflectively, \"just how the fight did go between you 'n' Rock. You was both using the whole room, I know. Near as I could make out, you--or maybe it was Rock--tromped on Big Jim's bunion. This cold spell's hard on bunions--and Big Jim went after you both with blood in his eye.  \"After that\"--Sandy spread his arms largely--\"it was go-as-you-please. Sam and me was the only ones that kept out, near as I can recollect, and when it thinned up a bit, you had Aleck down and was pounding the liver outa him, and Big Jim was whanging away at you, and Rock was clawin' Jim in the back of the neck, and you was all kickin' like bay steers in brandin' time. I reached in under the pile and dragged you out by one leg and left the rest of 'em fighting. They never seemed to miss you none.\" He grinned. \"Jim commenced to bump Aleck's head up and down on the floor instead of you--and I knew he didn't have nothing against Aleck.\"  \"Bill--\"  \"Bill, he'd quit right in the start.\" Sandy's grin became a laugh. \"Seems like pore old Bill always gits in bad when you commence on your third pint. You wasn't through, though, seems like. You was going to start in at the beginning and en-core the whole performance, and you started out after Bill. Bill, he was lookin' for a hole big enough to crawl into by that time. But you run into the preacher. And you licked him to a fare-you-well and had him crying real tears before I or anybody else could stop you.\"  \"What'd I lick him for?\" Ford inquired in a tone of deep discouragement.  Sandy's indeterminate, blue-gray eyes rounded with puzzlement.  \"Search me,\" he repeated automatically. But later he inadvertently shed enlightenment. He laughed, bending double, and slapping his thigh at the irresistible urge of a mental picture.  \"Thought I'd die,\" he gasped. \"Me and Sam was watching from the door. You had the preacher by the collar, shakin' him, and once in awhile liftin' him clean off the ground on the toe of your boot; and you kept saying: 'A sober man, and a preacher--and you'd marry that girl to a fellow like me!' And then biff! And he'd let out a squawk. 'A drinkin', fightin', gamblin' son-of-a-gun like me, you swine!' you'd tell him. And when we finally pulled you loose, he picked up his hat and made a run for it.\"  Ford meditated gloomily. \"I'll lick him again, and lick him when I'm sober, by thunder!\" he promised grimly. \"Who was he, do you know?\"  \"No, I don't. Little, dried-up geezer with a nose like a kit-fox's and a whine to his voice. He won't come around here no more.\"  The door opened gustily and a big fellow with a skinned nose and a whimsical pair of eyes looked in, hesitated while he stared hard at Ford, and then entered and shut the door by the simple method of throwing his shoulders back against it.  \"Hello, old sport--how you comin'?\" he cried cheerfully. \"Kinda wet for makin' calls, but when a man's loaded down with a guilty conscience--\" He sighed somewhat ostentatiously and pulled forward a chair rejuvenated with baling-wire braces between the legs, and a cowhide seat. \"What's that cookin'--coffee, or sheep-dip?\" he inquired facetiously of Sandy, though his eyes dwelt solicitously upon Ford's bowed head. He leaned forward and slapped Ford in friendly fashion upon the shoulder.  \"Buck up--'the worst is yet to come,'\" he shouted, and laughed with an exaggeration of cheerfulness. \"You can't ever tell when death or matrimony's goin' to get a man. By hokey, seems like there's no dodgin' either one.\"  Ford lifted a bloodshot eye to the other. \"And I always counted you for a friend, Bill,\" he reproached heavily. \"Sandy says I licked you good and plenty. Well, looks to me like you had it coming, all right.\"  \"Well--I got it, didn't I?\" snorted Bill, his hand lifting involuntarily to his nose. \"And I ain't bellering, am I?\" His mouth took an abused, downward droop. \"I ain't holdin' any grudge, am I? Why, Sandy here can tell you that I held one side of you up whilst he was leadin' the other side of you home! And I am sorry I stood there and seen you get married off and never lifted a finger; I'm darned sorry. I shoulda hollered misdeal, all right. I know it now.\" He pulled remorsefully at his wet mustache, which very much resembled a worn-out sharing brush.  Ford straightened up, dropped a hand upon his thigh, and thereby discovered another sore spot, which he caressed gently with his palm.  \"Say, Bill, you were there, and you saw her. On the square now--what's she like? And what made me marry her?\"  Bill pulled so hard upon his mustache that his teeth showed; his breath became unpleasantly audible with the stress of emotion. \"So help me, I can't tell you what she's like, Ford,\" he confessed. \"I don't remember nothing about her looks, except she looked good to me, and I never seen her before, and her hair wasn't red--I always remember red hair when I see it, drunk or sober. You see,\" he added as an extenuation, \"I was pretty well jagged myself. I musta been. I recollect I was real put out because my name wasn't Frank Ford--By hokey!\" He laid an impressive forefinger upon Ford's knee and tapped several times. \"I never knew your name was rightly Frank Ford Cameron. I always--\"  \"It ain't.\" Ford winced and drew away from the tapping process, as if his knee also was sensitive that morning.  \"You told her it was. I mind that perfectly, because I was so su'prised I swore right out loud and was so damned ashamed I couldn't apologize. And say! She musta been a real lady or I wouldn't uh felt that way about it!\" Bill glanced triumphantly from one to the other. \"Take it from me, you married a lady, Ford. Drunk or sober, I always make it a point to speak proper before the ladies--t'other kind don't count--and when I make a break, you betcher life I remember it. She's a real lady--I'd swear to that on a stack uh bibles ten feet high!\" He settled back and unbuttoned his steaming coat with the air of a man who has established beyond question the vital point of an argument.  \"Did I tell her so myself, or did I just let it go that way?\" Ford, as his brain cleared, stuck close to his groping for the essential facts.  \"Well, now--I ain't dead sure as to that. Maybe Rock'll remember. Kinda seems to me now, that she asked you if you was really Frank Ford Cameron, and you said: 'I sure am,' or something like that. The preacher'd know, maybe. He musta been the only sober one in the bunch--except the girl. But you done chased him off, so--\"  \"Sandy, I wish you'd go hunt Rock up and tell him I want to see him.\" Ford spoke with more of his natural spirit than he had shown since waking.  \"Rock's gone on out to Riley's camp,\" volunteered Bill. \"Left this morning, before the rain started in.\"  \"What was her name--do you know?\" Ford went back to the mystery.  \"Ida--or was it Jenny? Some darned name--I heard it, when the preacher was marrying you.\" Bill was floundering hopelessly in mental fog, but he persisted. \"And I seen it wrote in the paper I signed my name to. I mind she rolled up the paper afterwards and put it--well, I dunno where, but she took it away with her, and says to you: 'That's safe, now'--or 'You're safe,' or 'I'm safe,'--anyway, some darned thing was safe. And I was goin' to kiss the bride--mebbe I did kiss her--only I'd likely remember it if I had, drunk or sober! And--oh, now I got it!\" Bill's voice was full of elation. \"You was goin' to kiss the bride--that was it, it was you goin' to kiss her, and she slap--no, by hokey, she didn't slap you, she just--or was it Rock, now?\" Doubt filled his "]]]
