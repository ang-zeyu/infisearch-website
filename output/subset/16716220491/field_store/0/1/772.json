I must pray for him, I must pray!”  Then he thought--“Where am I going to?” and he prayed desperately.  “Ah! this is not right at all,” little Em said, peeping between the stones, and finding him in a very curious posture. “What are you doing Waldo? It is not the play, you know. You should run out when we come to the white stone. Ah, you do not play nicely.”  “I--I will play nicely now,” said the boy, coming out and standing sheepishly before them; “I--I only forgot; I will play now.”  “He has been to sleep,” said freckled Em.  “No,” said beautiful little Lyndall, looking curiously at him: “he has been crying.”  She never made a mistake.  *****   The Confession.  One night, two years after, the boy sat alone on the kopje. He had crept softly from his father’s room and come there. He often did, because, when he prayed or cried aloud, his father might awake and hear him; and none knew his great sorrow, and none knew his grief, but he himself, and he buried them deep in his heart.  He turned up the brim of his great hat and looked at the moon, but most at the leaves of the prickly pear that grew just before him. They glinted, and glinted, and glinted, just like his own heart--cold, so hard, and very wicked. His physical heart had pain also; it seemed full of little bits of glass, that hurt. He had sat there for half an hour, and he dared not go back to the close house.  He felt horribly lonely. There was not one thing so wicked as he in all the world, and he knew it. He folded his arms and began to cry--not aloud; he sobbed without making any sound, and his tears left scorched marks where they fell. He could not pray; he had prayed night and day for so many months; and tonight he could not pray. When he left off crying, he held his aching head with his brown hands. If one might have gone up to him and touched him kindly; poor, ugly little thing! Perhaps his heart was almost broken.  With his swollen eyes he sat there on a flat stone at the very top of the kopje; and the tree, with every one of its wicked leaves, blinked, and blinked, and blinked at him. Presently he began to cry again, and then stopped his crying to look at it. He was quiet for a long while, then he knelt up slowly and bent forward. There was a secret he had carried in his heart for a year. He had not dared to look at it; he had not whispered it to himself, but for a year he had carried it. “I hate God!” he said. The wind took the words and ran away with them, among the stones, and through the leaves of the prickly pear. He thought it died away half down the kopje. He had told it now!  “I love Jesus Christ, but I hate God.”  The wind carried away that sound as it had done the first. Then he got up and buttoned his old coat about him. He knew he was certainly lost now; he did not care. If half the world were to be lost, why not he too? He would not pray for mercy any more. Better so--better to know certainly. It was ended now. Better so.  He began scrambling down the sides of the kopje to go home.  Better so! But oh, the loneliness, the agonized pain! for that night, and for nights on nights to come! The anguish that sleeps all day on the heart like a heavy worm, and wakes up at night to feed!  There are some of us who in after years say to Fate, “Now deal us your hardest blow, give us what you will; but let us never again suffer as we suffered when we were children.”  The barb in the arrow of childhood’s suffering is this: its intense loneliness, its intense agony.     Chapter 1.II. Plans and Bushman Paintings.  At last came the year of the great drought, the year of eighteen-sixty-two. From end to end of the land the earth cried for water. Man and beast turned their eyes to the pitiless sky, that like the roof of some brazen oven arched overhead. On the farm, day after day, month after month, the water in the dams fell lower and lower; the sheep died in the fields; the cattle, scarcely able to crawl, tottered as they moved from spot to spot in search of food. Week after week, month after month, the sun looked down from the cloudless sky, till the karoo-bushes were leafless sticks, broken into the earth, and the earth itself was naked and bare; and only the milk-bushes, like old hags, pointed their shrivelled fingers heavenward, praying for the rain that never came.  *****  It was on an afternoon of a long day in that thirsty summer, that on the side of the kopje furthest from the homestead the two girls sat. They were somewhat grown since the days when they played hide-and-seek there, but they were mere children still.  Their dress was of dark, coarse stuff; their common blue pinafores reached to their ankles, and on their feet they wore home-made velschoen.  They sat under a shelving rock, on the surface of which were still visible some old Bushman paintings, their red and black pigments having been preserved through long years from wind and rain by the overhanging ledge; grotesque oxen, elephants, rhinoceroses, and a one-horned beast, such as no man ever has seen or ever shall.  The girls sat with their backs to the paintings. In their laps were a few fern and ice-plant leaves, which by dint of much searching they had gathered under the rocks.  Em took off her big brown kapje and began vigorously to fan her red face with it; but her companion bent low over the leaves in her lap, and at last took up an ice-plant leaf and fastened it on to the front of her blue pinafore with a pin.  “Diamonds must look as these drops do,” she said, carefully bending over the leaf, and crushing one crystal drop with her delicate little nail. “When I,” she said, “am grown up, I shall wear real diamonds, exactly like these in my hair.”  Her companion opened her eyes and wrinkled her low forehead.  “Where will you find them, Lyndall? The stones are only crystals that we picked up yesterday. Old Otto says so.”  “And you think that I am going to stay here always?”  The lip trembled scornfully.  “Ah, no,” said her companion. “I suppose some day we shall go somewhere; but now we are only twelve, and we cannot marry till we are seventeen. Four years, five--that is a long time to wait. And we might not have diamonds if we did marry.”  “And you think that I am going to stay here till then?”  “Well, where are you going?” asked her companion.  The girl crushed an ice-plant leaf between her fingers.  “Tant Sannie is a miserable old woman,” she said. “Your father married her when he was dying, because he thought she would take better care of the farm, and of us, than an English woman. He said we should be taught and sent to school. Now she saves every farthing for herself, buys us not even one old book. She does not ill-use us--why? Because she is afraid of your father’s ghost. Only this morning she told her Hottentot that she would have beaten you for breaking the plate, but that three nights ago she heard a rustling and a grunting behind the pantry door, and knew it was your father coming to spook her. She is a miserable old woman,” said the girl, throwing the leaf from her; “but I intend to go to school.”  “And if she won’t let you?”  “I shall make her.”  “How?”  The child took not the slightest notice of the last question, and folded her small arms across her knees.  “But why do you want to go, Lyndall?”  “There is nothing helps in this world,” said the child slowly, “but to be very wise, and to know everything--to be clever.”  “But I should not like to go to school!” persisted the small freckled face.  “And you do not need to. When you are seventeen this Boer-woman will go; you will have this farm and everything that is upon it for your own; but I,” said Lyndall, “will have nothing. I must learn.”  “Oh, Lyndall! I will give you some of my sheep,” said Em, with a sudden burst of pitying generosity.  “I do not want your sheep,” said the girl slowly; “I want things of my own. When I am grown up,” she added, the flush on her delicate features deepening at every word, “there will be nothing that I do not know. I shall be rich, very rich; and I shall wear not only for best, but every day, a pure white silk, and little rose-buds, like the lady in Tant Sannie’s bedroom, and my petticoats will be embroidered, not only at the bottom, but all through.”  The lady in Tant Sannie’s bedroom was a gorgeous creature from a fashion-sheet, which the Boer-woman, somewhere obtaining, had pasted up at the foot of her bed, to be profoundly admired by the children.  “It would be very nice,” said Em; but it seemed a dream of quite too transcendent a glory ever to be realized.  At this instant there appeared at the foot of the kopje two figures--the one, a dog, white and sleek, one yellow ear hanging down over his left eye; the other, his master, a lad of fourteen, and no other than the boy Waldo, grown into a heavy, slouching youth of fourteen. The dog mounted the kopje quickly, his master followed slowly. He wore an aged jacket much too large for him, and rolled up at the wrists, and, as of old, a pair of dilapidated velschoens and a felt hat. He stood before the two girls at last.  “What have you been doing today?” asked Lyndall, lifting her eyes to his face.  “Looking after ewes and lambs below the dam. Here!” he said, holding out his hand awkwardly, “I brought them for you.”  There were a few green blades of tender grass.  “Where did you find them?”  “On the dam wall.”  She fastened them beside the leaf on her blue pinafore.  “They look nice there,” said the boy, awkwardly rubbing his great hands and watching her.  “Yes; but the pinafore spoils it all; it is not pretty.”  He looked at it closely.  “Yes, the squares are ugly; but it looks nice upon you--beautiful.”  He now stood silent before them, his great hands hanging loosely at either side.  “Some one has come today,” he mumbled out suddenly, when the idea struck him.  “Who?” asked both girls.  “An Englishman on foot.”  “What does he look like?” asked Em.  “I did not notice; but he has a very large nose,” said the boy slowly.

He asks you to give your life to him. He has a special work for you to do. You have heard of Wendell Phillips who did so much to make slavery unlawful in America! Once, when Wendell was a boy fourteen years of age, he heard Lyman Beecher preach. In the course of his sermon the preacher said, \"You belong to God.\" The boy Wendell thought that the preacher looked straight at him when he said that. He went to his home at the close of the service, climbed the stairs to his room, shut the door, knelt in prayer, saying, \"O God, I belong to thee, take what is thine own.\" He heard and answered God's call.  Many, many years before Wendell Phillips lived there was another boy. He worked in the temple. He was a youthful assistant to the minister. I suppose he ran errands for him, and performed any and every service about the temple the minister desired. One night, as usual, the boy went to bed and fell asleep. As he slept he heard a voice calling him. Now he was an obedient boy, and though it was hard for him to rouse himself from a sound sleep and leave his comfortable bed he did so. He ran to the minister saying, \"Here I am, you called me, what do you want?\" The minister said, \"No, my boy, I did not call you, go back to bed.\" The boy returned to his bed and again went to sleep. A second time, and even a third time he was called. Each time the faithful, obedient lad leaped from his couch and ran to the minister. The third time it dawned on the mind of the minister that the voice the lad heard was the voice of God, calling him to himself and to his special service. Being a wise and loving man he said to the boy, \"Return to your bed, and if you hear the call again, say, 'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.'\" The boy did as instructed and that night was forever memorable in his life, for that was the night God called Samuel and Samuel answered.  MEMORY VERSE, _I Samuel_ 3: 10      \"And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times,     Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak, for thy servant     heareth.\"  MEMORY HYMN [674]      _\"Hushed was the evening hymn.\"_     A HAPPY HOME   This morning, the first thing, my boy said to me, \"Tell me a story.\" This is the story I told him. Once upon a time, it was a long, long time ago, so long ago that we can scarcely realize how long, more than twenty-five hundred years ago. Well, once upon a time there was a home--homes then were quite the same in most ways as homes are now--there were children in that home. They played and were happy. And too, I suppose they had their misunderstandings, and sometimes the children quarreled. One day the children heard music. Looking up the street they saw a great company of men marching right toward them. They were soldiers. There were thirty thousand of them. In the center of the marching army were some oxen. The oxen were harnessed to a fine, new cart. On the cart was a chest, most beautifully carved and decorated. On the soldiers came. What was the amazement of the boys and girls when they stopped right in front of their house! Then the king, majestic in his bearing and gorgeously arrayed, came to their father and said, \"I want to leave this chest here in your house. Take good care of it.\" The king's men brought the wonderful chest within, set it down, went out, and the army marched away. From that hour the home was a different home. There was joy, and peace, and an utter absence of quarreling. Three months passed by. Then one day the king came again and took the chest away. But peace and happiness did not depart with the chest. The home was as happy and peaceful and free from bickering through all the coming months as through the three when the wonderful chest was in the house. What was the chest? It was not the king's chest; it was the ark of God. You will find this true story in Second Samuel, the sixth chapter.  Memory Verse, _II Samuel_ 6: 11      \"And the ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obededom the     Gittite three months; and the Lord blessed him, and all his     household.\"  MEMORY HYMN [671]      _\"O happy home, where thou art loved the dearest.\"_     SYSTEM   Here are three books. I put them down like this, one beside the other, that is system. I throw them down carelessly, that is not system, it is not orderly.  Here is a little box. Inside are letters, such as you see on the sign in front of the Church. Each letter has a space all its own. Now if A were put down at M, M at Z, and E at X, what a task it would be to pick out the letters and make a sign!  One day I visited a Chinese school. Such lack of system, such disorderliness I never did see! Such noise I never did hear! They were all studying at the tops of their voices, sitting around in all sorts of ways, each trying to out-shout the other. Another day I went into a school here in our city. I saw the desks arranged in systematic fashion, each child with a desk all his own. In front I saw a platform, with a larger desk, for the teacher. All was quiet and orderly.  Here I have a package of envelopes. There are fifty-two envelopes, one for each Sunday in the year. Each envelope is divided in the center. On one side I read, \"For others.\" On the other half I read, \"For ourselves.\" I need not tell you that these are church envelopes. In this way, this systematic way, we support our local church and pay to missions. We like to have the girls and boys, as well as older people, use these envelopes. The financial secretary of your church is just as willing to keep the records of young people who give but five cents in each side of the envelope as he is to keep the account of the man or woman who places five dollars in each side of the envelope every Sunday. You see we want you to grow up systematic and orderly in all your religious life. Our Master is pleased when we do our religious duties \"decently and in order.\"  MEMORY VERSE, _I Corinthians_ 16: 2      \"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in     store, as God hath prospered him.\"  MEMORY HYMN [631]      _\"Jesus shall reign where'er the sun.\"_     A BOY FROM THE COUNTRY   Once upon a time there was a boy who lived in the country. It was said of him that he was \"ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to.\" I think that description fits a country lad. Well, this boy had brothers who were away from home in the army, fighting. One day the boy's father said to him, \"I wish you would go down and see how your brothers are getting along, and take with you this present.\" The boy started on his journey. Now when he came to the place where the soldiers were encamped he saw a strange sight. A giant, from the opposing army, came out, blustering and issuing his challenge to any one who would dare come against him. All seemed afraid of him. Even the big, strong soldiers would not do battle with him. Therefore this youth from the country volunteered saying, \"I will go out and fight him.\" They tried to dissuade him, but he insisted. Now he was a perfect shot with the sling. He chose five smooth stones from the brook. With one of these he prevailed over the giant.  This lad, however, had some other things which stood him in better stead even than the sling and the stones. What were they? First, he had courage. He possessed what all the others lacked. Second, he had the ability to do one thing and do that one thing well. He could use a sling with the utmost accuracy. Third, he had confidence in himself and faith in God. He was not conceited, no, we do not like that. Rather he had self-confidence. Above all was this--\"I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts.\" So said the lad from the country as he went to fight the giant. What was his name? It is a good name--David.  MEMORY VERSE, _I Samuel_ 17: 45      \"Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a     shield; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts.\"  MEMORY HYMN [416]      _\"Faith of our fathers.\"_     THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WORLD   The most beautiful thing in the world! Now what is it? If you will lift your eyes just a little you will see the flowers on the table, but lift them higher than the flowers, higher than this pulpit, higher than the pipes of the organ, above the lights, above the arch, you will see the most beautiful thing in the world. Do you see it? It is the Cross.  Do you know, girls and boys, that long ago the cross was the most repulsive thing in the world? It was odious. It had none of the charm and beauty that is now woven about it. But from the day that Jesus was crucified on the cross it took on new meaning, and it has grown in charm and power until I think we all agree that it is the most beautiful sight in the world.  Out in Colorado, high up the side of a mountain, where the snow never melts in the crevices, may be seen two long ravines, one straight up and down, the other straight across. The snow is packed into those ravines all through the year, and lifting the eyes one may see upon the lofty mountain side the Holy Cross.  In the summer seas, one of the things that mariners are guided by and that tourists look for, is the Southern Cross. There it is, fashioned by the position of the stars in the clear skies of the tropics.  There are many men who wear a cross as a watch fob. There are women who wear a cross as a pendant about the neck. This is an outward sign of an inner devotion. The"]]]
