In another instant Charles was standing in the door, and seeing Patrolman Peter J. Lamb, he drew his gun, and Lamb fell dead. Two other officers, Sergeant Aucoin and Officer Trenchard, who were in the squad, seeing their comrades, Day and Lamb, fall dead, concluded to raise the siege, and both disappeared into an adjoining house, where they blew out their lights so that their cowardly carcasses could be safe from Charles's deadly aim. The calibre of their courage is well shown by the fact that they concluded to save themselves from any harm by remaining prisoners in that dark room until daybreak, out of reach of Charles's deadly rifle. Sergeant Aucoin, who had been so brave a few hours before when seeing the two colored men sitting on the steps, talking together on Dryades Street, and supposing that neither was armed, now showed his true calibre. Now he knew that Charles had a gun and was brave enough to use it, so he hid himself in a room two hours while Charles deliberately walked out of his room and into the street after killing both Lamb and Day. It is also shown, as further evidence of the bravery of some of New Orleans' \"finest,\" that one of them, seeing Capt. Day fall, ran seven blocks before he stopped, afterwards giving the excuse that he was hunting for a patrol box.  At daybreak the officers felt safe to renew the attack upon Charles, so they broke into his room, only to find that--what they probably very well knew--he had gone. It appears that he made his escape by crawling through a hole in the ceiling to a little attic in his house. Here he found that he could not escape except by a window which led into an alley, which had no opening on 4th Street. He scaled the fence and was soon out of reach.  It was now 5 o'clock Tuesday morning, and a general alarm was given. Sergeant Aucoin and Corporal Trenchard, having received a new supply of courage by returning daylight, renewed their effort to capture the man that they had allowed to escape in the darkness. Citizens were called upon to participate in the man hunt and New Orleans was soon the scene of terrible excitement. Officers were present everywhere, and colored men were arrested on all sides upon the pretext that they were impertinent and \"game niggers.\" An instance is mentioned in the _Times-Democrat_ of the twenty-fifth and shows the treatment which unoffending colored men received at the hands of some of the officers. This instance shows Corporal Trenchard, who displayed such remarkable bravery on Monday night in dodging Charles's revolver, in his true light. It shows how brave a white man is when he has a gun attacking a Negro who is a helpless prisoner. The account is as follows:    The police made some arrests in the neighborhood of the killing of the   two officers. Mobs of young darkies gathered everywhere. These Negroes   talked and joked about the affair, and many of them were for starting a   race war on the spot. It was not until several of these little gangs   amalgamated and started demonstrations that the police commenced to   act. Nearly a dozen arrests were made within an hour, and everybody in   the vicinity was in a tremor of excitement.    It was about 1 o'clock that the Negroes on Fourth Street became very   noisy, and George Meyers, who lives on Sixth Street, near Rampart,   appeared to be one of the prime movers in a little riot that was rapidly   developing. Policeman Exnicios and Sheridan placed him under arrest, and   owing to the fact that the patrol wagon had just left with a number of   prisoners, they walked him toward St. Charles Avenue in order to get a   conveyance to take him to the Sixth Precinct station.    A huge crowd of Negroes followed the officers and their prisoners.   Between Dryades and Baronne, on Sixth, Corporal Trenchard met the trio.   He had his pistol in his hand and he came on them running. The Negroes   in the wake of the officers, and prisoner took to flight immediately.   Some disappeared through gates and some over fences and into yards, for   Trenchard, visibly excited, was waving his revolver in the air and was   threatening to shoot. He joined the officers in their walk toward St.   Charles Street, and the way he acted led the white people who were   witnessing the affair to believe that his prisoner was the wanted Negro.   At every step he would punch him or hit him with the barrel of his   pistol, and the onlookers cried, \"Lynch him!\" \"Kill him!\" and other   expressions until the spectators were thoroughly wrought up. At St.   Charles Street Trenchard desisted, and, calling an empty ice wagon,   threw the Negro into the body of the vehicle and ordered Officer   Exnicios to take him to the Sixth Precinct station.    The ride to the station was a wild one. Exnicios had all he could do to   watch his prisoner. A gang climbed into the wagon and administered a   terrible thrashing to the black en route. It took a half hour to reach   the police station, for the mule that was drawing the wagon was not   overly fast. When the station was reached a mob of nearly 200 howling   white youths was awaiting it. The noise they made was something   terrible. Meyers was howling for mercy before he reached the ground. The   mob dragged him from the wagon, the officer with him. Then began a   torrent of abuse for the unfortunate prisoner.    The station door was but thirty feet away, but it took Exnicios nearly   five minutes to fight his way through the mob to the door. There were no   other officers present, and the station seemed to be deserted. Neither   the doorman nor the clerk paid any attention to the noise on the   outside. As the result, the maddened crowd wrought their vengeance on   the Negro. He was punched, kicked, bruised and torn. The clothes were   ripped from his back, while his face after that few minutes was   unrecognizable.  This was the treatment accorded and permitted to a helpless prisoner because he was black. All day Wednesday the man hunt continued. The excitement caused by the deaths of Day and Lamb became intense. The officers of the law knew they were trailing a man whose aim was deadly and whose courage they had never seen surpassed. Commenting upon the marksmanship of the man which the paper styled a fiend, the _Times-Democrat_ of Wednesday said:    One of the extraordinary features of the tragedy was the marksmanship   displayed by the Negro desperado. His aim was deadly and his coolness   must have been something phenomenal. The two shots that killed Captain   Day and Patrolman Lamb struck their victims in the head, a circumstance   remarkable enough in itself, considering the suddenness and fury of the   onslaught and the darkness that reigned in the alley way.    Later on Charles fired at Corporal Perrier, who was standing at least   seventy-five yards away. The murderer appeared at the gate, took   lightning aim along the side of the house, and sent a bullet whizzing   past the officer's ear. It was a close shave, and a few inches'   deflection would no doubt have added a fourth victim to the list.    At the time of the affray there is good reason to believe that Charles   was seriously wounded, and at any event he had lost quantities of blood.   His situation was as critical as it is possible to imagine, yet he shot   like an expert in a target range. The circumstance shows the desperate   character of the fiend, and his terrible dexterity with weapons makes   him one of the most formidable monsters that has ever been loose upon   the community.  Wednesday New Orleans was in the hands of a mob. Charles, still sought for and still defending himself, had killed four policemen, and everybody knew that he intended to die fighting. Unable to vent its vindictiveness and bloodthirsty vengeance upon Charles, the mob turned its attention to other colored men who happened to get in the path of its fury. Even colored women, as has happened many times before, were assaulted and beaten and killed by the brutal hoodlums who thronged the streets. The reign of absolute lawlessness began about 8 o'clock Wednesday night. The mob gathered near the Lee statue and was soon making its way to the place where the officers had been shot by Charles. Describing the mob, the _Times-Democrat_ of Thursday morning says:    The gathering in the square, which numbered about 700, eventually became   in a measure quiet, and a large, lean individual, in poor attire and   with unshaven face, leaped upon a box that had been brought for the   purpose, and in a voice that under no circumstances could be heard at a   very great distance, shouted: \"Gentlemen, I am the Mayor of Kenner.\" He   did not get a chance for some minutes to further declare himself, for   the voice of the rabble swung over his like a huge wave over a sinking   craft. He stood there, however, wildly waving his arms and demanded a   hearing, which was given him when the uneasiness of the mob was quieted   for a moment or so.    \"I am from Kenner, gentlemen, and I have come down to New Orleans   tonight to assist you in teaching the blacks a lesson. I have killed a   Negro before, and in revenge of the wrong wrought upon you and yours, I   am willing to kill again. The only way that you can teach these Niggers   a lesson and put them in their place is to go out and lynch a few of   them as an object lesson. String up a few of them, and the others will   trouble you no more. That is the only thing to do--kill them, string   them up, lynch them! I will lead you, if you will but follow. On to the   Parish Prison and lynch Pierce!\"    They bore down on the Parish Prison like an avalanche, but the avalanche   split harmlessly on the blank walls of the jail, and Remy Klock sent out   a brief message: \"You can't have Pierce, and you can't get in.\" Up to   that time the mob had had no opposition, but Klock's answer chilled them   considerably."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14977"],["title","The Red Record (#1)"],["body","the pale of human sympathy. With such unanimity, earnestness and apparent candor was this charge made and reiterated that the world has accepted the story that the Negro is a monster which the Southern white man has painted him. And today, the Christian world feels, that while lynching is a crime, and lawlessness and anarchy the certain precursors of a nation's fall, it can not by word or deed, extend sympathy or help to a race of outlaws, who might mistake their plea for justice and deem it an excuse for their continued wrongs.  The Negro has suffered much and is willing to suffer more. He recognizes that the wrongs of two centuries can not be righted in a day, and he tries to bear his burden with patience for today and be hopeful for tomorrow. But there comes a time when the veriest worm will turn, and the Negro feels today that after all the work he has done, all the sacrifices he has made, and all the suffering he has endured, if he did not, now, defend his name and manhood from this vile accusation, he would be unworthy even of the contempt of mankind. It is to this charge he now feels he must make answer.  If the Southern people in defense of their lawlessness, would tell the truth and admit that colored men and women are lynched for almost any offense, from murder to a misdemeanor, there would not now be the necessity for this defense. But when they intentionally, maliciously and constantly belie the record and bolster up these falsehoods by the words of legislators, preachers, governors and bishops, then the Negro must give to the world his side of the awful story.  A word as to the charge itself. In considering the third reason assigned by the Southern white people for the butchery of blacks, the question must be asked, what the white man means when he charges the black man with rape. Does he mean the crime which the statutes of the civilized states describe as such? Not by any means. With the Southern white man, any mesalliance existing between a white woman and a colored man is a sufficient foundation for the charge of rape. The Southern white man says that it is impossible for a voluntary alliance to exist between a white woman and a colored man, and therefore, the fact of an alliance is a proof of force. In numerous instances where colored men have have been lynched on the charge of rape, it was positively known at the time of lynching, and indisputably proven after the victim's death, that the relationship sustained between the man and woman was voluntary and clandestine, and that in no court of law could even the charge of assault have been successfully maintained.  It was for the assertion of this fact, in the defense of her own race, that the writer hereof became an exile; her property destroyed and her return to her home forbidden under penalty of death, for writing the following editorial which was printed in her paper, the _Free Speech,_ in Memphis, Tenn., May 21,1892:    Eight Negroes lynched since last issue of the _Free Speech_ one at   Little Rock, Ark., last Saturday morning where the citizens broke(?)   into the penitentiary and got their man; three near Anniston, Ala., one   near New Orleans; and three at Clarksville, Ga., the last three for   killing a white man, and five on the same old racket--the new alarm   about raping white women. The same programme of hanging, then shooting   bullets into the lifeless bodies was carried out to the letter. Nobody   in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that   Negro men rape white women. If Southern white men are not careful, they   will overreach themselves and public sentiment will have a reaction; a   conclusion will then be reached which will be very damaging to the moral   reputation of their women.  But threats cannot suppress the truth, and while the Negro suffers the soul deformity, resultant from two and a half centuries of slavery, he is no more guilty of this vilest of all vile charges than the white man who would blacken his name.  During all the years of slavery, no such charge was ever made, not even during the dark days of the rebellion, when the white man, following the fortunes of war went to do battle for the maintenance of slavery. While the master was away fighting to forge the fetters upon the slave, he left his wife and children with no protectors save the Negroes themselves. And yet during those years of trust and peril, no Negro proved recreant to his trust and no white man returned to a home that had been dispoiled.  Likewise during the period of alleged \"insurrection,\" and alarming \"race riots,\" it never occurred to the white man, that his wife and children were in danger of assault. Nor in the Reconstruction era, when the hue and cry was against \"Negro Domination,\" was there ever a thought that the domination would ever contaminate a fireside or strike to death the virtue of womanhood. It must appear strange indeed, to every thoughtful and candid man, that more than a quarter of a century elapsed before the Negro began to show signs of such infamous degeneration.  In his remarkable apology for lynching, Bishop Haygood, of Georgia, says: \"No race, not the most savage, tolerates the rape of woman, but it may be said without reflection upon any other people that the Southern people are now and always have been most sensitive concerning the honor of their women--their mothers, wives, sisters and daughters.\" It is not the purpose of this defense to say one word against the white women of the South. Such need not be said, but it is their misfortune that the chivalrous white men of that section, in order to escape the deserved execration of the civilized world, should shield themselves by their cowardly and infamously false excuse, and call into question that very honor about which their distinguished priestly apologist claims they are most sensitive. To justify their own barbarism they assume a chivalry which they do not possess. True chivalry respects all womanhood, and no one who reads the record, as it is written in the faces of the million mulattoes in the South, will for a minute conceive that the southern white man had a very chivalrous regard for the honor due the women of his own race or respect for the womanhood which circumstances placed in his power. That chivalry which is \"most sensitive concerning the honor of women\" can hope for but little respect from the civilized world, when it confines itself entirely to the women who happen to be white. Virtue knows no color line, and the chivalry which depends upon complexion of skin and texture of hair can command no honest respect.  When emancipation came to the Negroes, there arose in the northern part of the United States an almost divine sentiment among the noblest, purest and best white women of the North, who felt called to a mission to educate and Christianize the millions of southern exslaves. From every nook and corner of the North, brave young white women answered that call and left their cultured homes, their happy associations and their lives of ease, and with heroic determination went to the South to carry light and truth to the benighted blacks. It was a heroism no less than that which calls for volunteers for India, Africa and the Isles of the sea. To educate their unfortunate charges; to teach them the Christian virtues and to inspire in them the moral sentiments manifest in their own lives, these young women braved dangers whose record reads more like fiction than fact. They became social outlaws in the South. The peculiar sensitiveness of the southern white men for women, never shed its protecting influence about them. No friendly word from their own race cheered them in their work; no hospitable doors gave them the companionship like that from which they had come. No chivalrous white man doffed his hat in honor or respect. They were \"Nigger teachers\"--unpardonable offenders in the social ethics of the South, and were insulted, persecuted and ostracised, not by Negroes, but by the white manhood which boasts of its chivalry toward women.  And yet these northern women worked on, year after year, unselfishly, with a heroism which amounted almost to martyrdom. Threading their way through dense forests, working in schoolhouse, in the cabin and in the church, thrown at all times and in all places among the unfortunate and lowly Negroes, whom they had come to find and to serve, these northern women, thousands and thousands of them, have spent more than a quarter of a century in giving to the colored people their splendid lessons for home and heart and soul. Without protection, save that which innocence gives to every good woman, they went about their work, fearing no assault and suffering none. Their chivalrous protectors were hundreds of miles away in their northern homes, and yet they never feared any \"great dark-faced mobs,\" they dared night or day to \"go beyond their own roof trees.\" They never complained of assaults, and no mob was ever called into existence to avenge crimes against them. Before the world adjudges the Negro a moral monster, a vicious assailant of womanhood and a menace to the sacred precincts of home, the colored people ask the consideration of the silent record of gratitude, respect, protection and devotion of the millions of the race in the South, to the thousands of northern white women who have served as teachers and missionaries since the war.  The Negro may not have known what chivalry was, but he knew enough to preserve inviolate the womanhood of the South which was entrusted to his hands during the war. The finer sensibilities of his soul may have been crushed out by years of slavery, but his heart was full of gratitude to the white women of the North, who blessed his home and inspired his soul in all these years of freedom. Faithful to his trust in both of these instances, he should now have the impartial ear of the civilized world, when he dares to speak for himself as against the infamy wherewith"]]]
