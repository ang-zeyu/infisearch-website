I hope somebody will come in for the evening, and share with us the infliction of her society,\" Zoe said, concluding with a forlorn attempt at a laugh.  \"Won't you take off that very becoming hat and cloak, Mrs. Travilla, and spend the evening?\" asked Edward playfully.  \"Thank you. I believe I will, if you will accompany me to the dressing-room,\" she returned, with a smiling look up into his face.  \"That I will with pleasure,\" he said, \"provided you will reward me with some assistance with my toilet.\"  \"Such as brushing your hair, and tying your cravat? Yes, sir, I will: it's a bargain.\"  And so, laughing and chatting, they went up to their own private apartments.  Halt an hour later they came down again together, to find Miss Deane in the parlor, seated by a window overlooking the avenue.  \"There's a carriage just drawing up before your front entrance,\" she remarked: \"the Roselands family carriage, I think it is.\"  Zoe gave her husband a bright, pleased look. It seemed her wish for an addition to their party for the evening had been granted.  The next moment the room-door was thrown, open, and Dr. Conly and Miss Ella were announced.  They were cordially welcomed, asked to tea, and staid the evening, greatly relieving Zoe in the matter of entertaining her unwelcome guest, who devoted herself to the doctor, and left Edward to his wife and cousin, a condition of things decidedly agreeable to Zoe.  A little after nine the Roselands carriage was announced; and the doctor and Ella took their departure, Edward and Zoe accompanying them to the outer door.  The sky was black with clouds, and the wind roaring through the trees on the lawn.  \"We are going to have a heavy storm. I think,\" remarked Arthur, glancing upward: \"there is not a star to be seen, and the wind blows almost a gale. I hope no patient of mine will want the doctor very badly to-night,\" he added with a slight laugh. \"Step in out of the wind, cousin Zoe, or you may be the very one to send for me.\"  Doing as directed, \"No, indeed,\" she said: \"I'm sure I couldn't have the heart to call anybody up out of a warm bed to face such a cutting wind as this.\"  \"No, no; never hesitate when there is a real necessity,\" he returned, speaking from his seat in the carriage, where he had already taken his place beside his sister, whom Edward had handed in. \"Good-night, and hurry in, both of you, for my sake if not for your own.\"  But they lingered a moment till the carriage turned, and drove swiftly down the avenue.  \"I am so glad they came,\" remarked Zoe, as Edward shut the door and locked it for the night.  \"Yes,\" he said: \"they added a good deal to the pleasure of the evening. As we couldn't be alone together, three guests were more acceptable than one.\"  \"Decidedly; and that one was delighted, I'm sure, to have an opportunity to exercise her conversational gifts for the benefit of a single man instead of a married one.\"  \"Zoe, love, don't allow yourself to grow bitter and sarcastic,\" Edward said, turning toward her, laying a hand lightly, affectionately, upon her shoulder, and gazing down into her eyes with a look of grave concern.  She colored under it, and turned away with a pout that almost spoiled the beauty of her fair face. She was more than ever impatient to be rid of their self-invited guest.  \"She always sets Ned to scolding me,\" was the bitter thought in her heart as she went slowly back to the parlor, where they had left Miss Deane, Edward following, sighing inwardly at the change in his darling always wrought by that unwelcome presence in the house.  \"How the wind roars down the chimney!\" Miss Deane remarked as her host and hostess re-entered the room, where she was comfortably seated in an easy-chair beside the glowing grate. \"I fear to-morrow will prove a stormy day; but in that case I shall feel all the more delighted with my comfortable quarters here,--all the more grateful to you, Mr. Travilla, for saving me from a long detention in one of those miserable little country taverns, where I should have died of _ennui_.\"  \"You seem kindly disposed, my dear madam, to make a great deal of a small service,\" returned Edward gallantly.  But Zoe said not a word. She stood gazing into the fire, apparently lost in thought; but the color deepened on her cheek, and a slight frown contracted her brows.  Presently she turned to her guest, saying courteously, \"You must be weary with your journey, Miss Deane: would you like to retire?\"  \"Thank you, I should,\" was the reply; and thereupon the good-nights were said, and they sought their respective rooms.  \"You are not displeased with me, dear?\" Zoe asked, lifting her eyes inquiringly to her husband's face as she stood before their dressing-room fire with his arm about her waist: \"you are looking so very grave.\"  \"No, dearest, I am not disposed to find fault with you,\" he said, softly caressing her hair and cheek with his disengaged hand; \"though I should be glad if you could be a trifle more cordial to our uninvited guest.\"  \"It's my nature to act just as I feel; and, if there's a creature on earth I thoroughly detest, it is she!\" returned the child-wife with almost passionate vehemence. \"I know she hates me,--for all her purring manner and sweet tones and words,--and that she likes nothing better than to make trouble between my husband and me.\"  \"My dear child, you really must try not to be so uncharitable and suspicious,\" Edward said in a slightly reproving tone. \"I do not perceive any such designs or any hypocrisy in her conduct toward you.\"  \"No: men are as blind as a bat in their intercourse with such women; never can see through their designs; always take them to be as sweet and amiable as they pretend to be. It takes a woman to understand her own sex.\"  \"Maybe so,\" he said soothingly; \"but we will leave the disagreeable subject for to-night at least, shall we not?\"  \"Yes; and, oh, I do hope the weather to-morrow will not be such as to afford her an excuse for prolonging her stay!\"  \"I hope not, indeed, love,\" he responded; \"but let us resolve, that, if it does, we will try to bear the infliction patiently, and give our self-invited guest no right to accuse us of a lack of hospitality toward her. Let us not forget or disobey the Bible injunction, to 'use hospitality one to another without grudging.'\"  \"I'll try not to. I'll be as good to her as I can, without feeling that I am acting insincerely.\"  \"And that is all I ask, love. Your perfect freedom from any thing approaching to deceit is one of your greatest charms, in your husband's eyes,\" he said, tenderly caressing her. \"It would, I am sure, be quite impossible for me to love a wife in whose absolute truth and sincerity I had not entire confidence.\"  \"And you do love me, your foolish, faulty little wife?\" she said, in a tone that was a mixture of assertion and inquiry, while her lovely eyes gazed searchingly into his.  \"Dearly, dearly, my sweet!\" he said, smiling fondly down upon her. \"And now to bed, lest these bright eyes and rosy cheeks should lose something of their brilliance and beauty.\"  \"Suppose they should,\" she said, turning slightly pale, as with sudden pain. \"O Ned! if I live, I must some day grow old and gray and wrinkled, my eyes dim and sunken: shall you love me then, darling?\"  \"Better than ever, love,\" he whispered, holding her closer to his heart; \"for how long we shall have lived and loved together! We shall have come to be as one indeed, each with hardly a thought or feeling unshared by the other.\"     CHAPTER III.  \"One woman reads another's character, without the tedious trouble of deciphering.\"--JONSON.   Zoe's sleep that night was profound and refreshing, and she woke in perfect health and vigor of body and mind; but the first sound that smote upon her ear--the dashing of sleet against the window-pane--sent a pang of disappointment and dismay to her heart.  She sprang from her bed, and, running to the window, drew aside "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14499"],["title","The Religions of India (#1)"],["body","e, but he gives no notion of the number or elaborate character of these interesting ceremonies.  The sources to which we shall have occasion to refer will be, then, the two most important collections of Vedic hymns--the Rig Veda and the Atharva Veda; the Brahmanic literature, with the supplementary Upanishads, and the S[=u]tras or mnemonic abridgments of religious and ceremonial rules; the legal texts, and the religious and theological portions of the epic; and the later sectarian writings, called Pur[=a]nas. The great heresies, again, have their own special writings. Thus far we shall draw on the native literature. Only for some of the modern sects, and for the religions of the wild tribes which have no literature, shall we have to depend on the accounts of European writers.   DATES.  For none of the native religious works has one a certain date. Nor is there for any one of the earlier compositions the certainty that it belongs, as a whole, to any one time. The Rig Veda was composed by successive generations; the Atharvan represents different ages; each Br[=a]hmana appears to belong in part to one era, in part to another; the earliest S[=u]tras (manuals of law, etc.) have been interpolated; the earliest metrical code is a composite; the great epic is the work of centuries; and not only do the Upanishads and Pur[=a]nas represent collectively many different periods, but exactly to which period each individually is to be assigned remains always doubtful. Only in the case of the Buddhistic writings is there a satisfactorily approximate terminus a quo, and even here approximate means merely within the limit of centuries.  Nevertheless, criteria fortunately are not lacking to enable one to assign the general bulk of any one work to a certain period in the literary development; and as these periods are, if not sharply, yet plainly distinguishable, one is not in so desperate a case as he might have expected to be, considering that it is impossible to date with certainty any Hindu book or writer before the Christian era. For, first, there exists a difference in language, demarcating the most important periods; and, secondly, the development of the literature has been upon such lines that it is easy to say, from content and method of treatment, whether a given class of writings is a product of the Vedic, early Brahmanic, or late Brahmanic epochs. Usually, indeed, one is unable to tell whether a later Upanishad was made first in the early or late Brahmanic period, but it is known that the Upanishads, as a whole, _i.e._, the literary form and philosophical material which characterize Upanishads, were earlier than the latest Brahmanic period and subsequent to the early Brahmanic period; that they arose at the close of the latter and before the rise of the former. So the Br[=a]hmanas, as a whole, are subsequent to the Vedic age, although some of the Vedic hymns appear to have been made up in the same period with that of the early Br[=a]hmanas. Again, the Pur[=a]nas can be placed with safety after the late Brahmanic age; and, consequently, subsequent to the Upanishads, although it is probable that many Upanishads were written after the first Pur[=a]nas. The general compass of this enormous literature is from an indefinite antiquity to about 1500 A.D. A liberal margin of possible error must be allowed in the assumption of any specific dates. The received opinion is that the Rig Veda goes back to about 2000 B.C., yet are some scholars inclined rather to accept 3000 B.C. as the time that represents this era. Weber, in his _Lectures on Sanskrit Literature_ (p. 7), rightly says that to seek for an exact date is fruitless labor; while Whitney compares Hindu dates to ninepins--set up only to be bowled down again. Schroeder, in his _Indiens Literatur und Cultur_, suggests that the prior limit may be \"a few centuries earlier than 1500,\" agreeing with Weber's preferred reckoning; but Whitney, Grassmann, and Benfey provisionally assume 2000 B.C. as the starting point of Hindu literature. The lowest possible limit for this event Müller now places at about 1500, which is recognized as a very cautious view; most scholars thinking that Müller's estimate gives too little time for the development of the literary periods, which, in their opinion, require, linguistically and otherwise, a greater number of years. Brunnhofer more recently has suggested 2800 B.C. as the terminus; while the last writers on the subject (Tilak and Jacobi) claim to have discovered that the period from 3500 to 2500 represents the Vedic age. Their conclusions, however, are not very convincing, and have been disputed vigorously.[4] Without the hope of persuading such scholars as are wedded to a terminus of three or four thousand years ago that we are right, we add, in all deference to others, our own opinion on this vexed question. Buddhism gives the first semblance of a date in Hindu literature. Buddha lived in the sixth century, and died probably about 480, possibly (Westergaard's extreme opinion) as late as 368.[5] Before this time arise the S[=u]tras, back of which lie the earliest Upanishads, the bulk of the Br[=a]hmanas, and all the Vedic poems. Now it is probable that the Brahmanic literature itself extends to the time of Buddha and perhaps beyond it. For the rest of pre-Buddhistic literature it seems to us incredible that it is necessary to require, either from the point of view of linguistic or of social and religious development, the enormous period of two thousand years. There are no other grounds on which to base a reckoning except those of Jacobi and his Hindu rival, who build on Vedic data results that hardly support the superstructure they have erected. Jacobi's starting-point is from a mock-serious hymn, which appears to be late and does not establish, to whatever date it be assigned, the point of departure from which proceeds his whole argument, as Whitney has shown very well. One is driven back to the needs of a literature in respect of time sufficient for it to mature. What changes take place in language, even with a written literature, in the space of a few centuries, may be seen in Persian, Greek, Latin, and German. No two thousand years are required to bridge the linguistic extremes of the Vedic and classical Sanskrit language.[6] But in content it will be seen that the flower of the later literature is budding already in the Vedic age. We are unable to admit that either in language or social development, or in literary or religious growth, more than a few centuries are necessary to account for the whole development of Hindu literature (meaning thereby compositions, whether written or not) up to the time of Buddha. Moreover, if one compare the period at which arise the earliest forms of literature among other Aryan peoples, it will seem very strange that, whereas in the case of the Romans, Greeks, and Persians, one thousand years B.C. is the extreme limit of such literary activity as has produced durable works, the Hindus two or three thousand years B.C. were creating poetry so finished, so refined, and, from a metaphysical point of view, so advanced as is that of the Rig Veda. If, as is generally assumed, the (prospective) Hindus and Persians were last to leave the common Aryan habitat, and came together to the south-east, the difficulty is increased; especially in the light of modern opinion in regard to the fictitious antiquity of Persian (Iranian) literature. For if Darmesteter be correct in holding the time of the latter to be at most a century before our era, the incongruity between that oldest date of Persian literature and the \"two or three thousand years before Christ,\" which are claimed in the case of the Rig Veda, becomes so great as to make the latter assumption more dubious than ever.  We think in a word, without wishing to be dogmatic, that the date of the Rig Veda is about on a par, historically, with that of 'Homer,' that is to say, the Collection[7] represents a long period, which was completed perhaps two hundred years after 1000 B.C, while again its earliest beginnings precede that date possibly by five centuries; but we would assign the bulk of the Rig Veda to about 1000 B.C. With conscious imitation of older speech a good deal of archaic linguistic effect doubtless was produced by the latest poets, who really belong to the Brahmanic age. The Brahmanic age in turn ends, as we opine, about 500 B.C., overlapping the S[=u]tra period as well as that of the first Upanishads. The former class of writings (after 500 B.C. one may talk of writings) is represented by dates that reach from circa 600-500 B.C. nearly to our era. Buddhism's _floruit_ is from 500 B.C. to 500 A.D., and epic Hinduism covers nearly the same centuries. From 500 to 1000 Buddhism is in a state of decadence; and through this time extend the dramatic and older Puranic writings; while other Pur[=a]nas are as late as 1500, at which time arises the great modern reforming sect of the Sikhs. In the matter of the earlier termini a century may be added or subtracted here and there, but these convenient divisions of five hundreds will be found on the whole to be sufficiently accurate.[8]   METHODS OF INTERPRETATION.  At the outset of his undertaking a double problem presents itself to one that would give, even in compact form, a view of Hindu religions. This problem consists in explaining, and, in so far as is possible, reconciling opposed opinions in regard not only to the nature of these religions but also to the method of interpreting the Vedic hymns.  That the Vedic religion was naturalistic and mytho-poetic is doubted by few. The Vedic hymns laud the powers of nature and natural phenomena as personified gods, or even as impersonal phenomena. They praise also as distinct powers the departed fathers. In the Rig Veda I. 168, occur some verses in honor of the storm-gods called Maruts: \"Self-yoked are they come lightly from the sky.
