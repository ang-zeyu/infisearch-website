What is the unpardonable sin, I wonder? Is it to be persistently       and forever unkind? Does it mean perhaps the absolute refusal to       accept the principle of love which is indeed creation’s final       law? The lessons of the Christmastide are so many; the appeals       that now may be made to humanity crowd to the lips from full       minds and fuller hearts. Might we not reduce them all to the       explication of the underlying principle of God’s purpose to us,       as expressed in those themic words of love with which angels and       men greeted the advent of the Child on the first Christmas       morning, “Good will toward men?”        Let us then show our good will toward men by doing good and       bringing happiness to someone—if not to everyone—at this       Christmas season. Put aside the memories of disappointments, of       sorrows that have not vanished, of cares that still burden, and       do good in spite of them because you would not dim the brightness       of the present for any human heart with the shadows of old       regrets. Do good because of a future which opens possibilities       before you, for others, if not for yourselves.        Brethren, friends, all, let us make up our minds that we will be       kindly affectioned one to another in our homes and out of them,       on this approaching Christmas day. That the old debate, the       ancient strife, the rankling recollection, the sharp contention,       shall be put aside, that “envy, hatred, and malice, and all       uncharitableness” shall be done away with. Let us forgive and       forget; but if we cannot forget let us at least forgive. And so       let there be peace between man and man at Christmas—a truce of       God.        Let us pray that Love shall come as a little child to our       households. That He shall be in our hearts and shall find His       expression in all that we do or say on this birthday of goodness       and cheer for the world. Then let us resolve that the spirit of       the day shall be carried out through our lives, that as Christ       did not come for an hour, but for a lifetime, we would fain       become as little children on this day of days that we may begin a       new life of good will to men.        Let us make this a new birthday of kindness and love that shall       endure. That is a Christmas hope, a Christmas wish. Let us give       to it the gracious expression of life among men.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  FROM A FAR COUNTRY        _Being a New Variation of an Ancient Theme_        A STORY FOR GROWN-UPS         I        “_A certain man had two sons_”—so begins the best and most famous       story in the world’s literature. Use of the absolute superlative       is always dangerous, but none will gainsay that statement, I am       sure. This story, which follows that familiar tale afar off,       indeed, begins in the same way. And the parallelism between the       two is exact up to a certain point. What difference a little       point doth make; like the little fire, behold, how great a matter       it kindleth! Indeed, lacking that one detail the older story       would have had no value; it would not have been told; without its       addition this would have been a repetition of the other.        When the modern young prodigal came to himself, when he found       himself no longer able to endure the husks of the swine like his       ancient exemplar, when he rose and returned to his father because       of that distaste, he found no father watching and waiting for him       at the end of the road! Upon that change the action of this story       hangs. It was a pity, too, because the elder brother was there       and in a mood not unlike that of his famous prototype.        Indeed, there was added to that elder brother’s natural       resentment at the younger’s course the blinding power of a great       sorrow, for the father of the two sons was dead. He had died of a       broken heart. Possessed of no omniscience of mind or vision, he       had been unable to foresee the long delayed turning point in the       career of his younger son and death came too swiftly to enable       them to meet again. So long as he had strength, that father had       stood, as it were, at the top of the hill looking down the road       watching and hoping.        And but the day before the tardy prodigal’s return he had been       laid away with his own fathers in the God’s acre around the       village church in the Pennsylvania hills. Therefore there was no       fatted calf ready for the disillusioned youth whose waywardness       had killed his father. It will be remembered that the original       elder brother objected seriously to fatted calves on such       occasions. Indeed, the funeral baked meats would coldly furnish       forth a welcoming meal if any such were called for.        For all his waywardness, for all his self-will, the younger son       had loved his father well, and it was a terrible shock to him       (having come to his senses) to find that he had returned too       late. And for all his hardness and narrowness the eldest son also       had loved his father well—strong tribute to the quality of the       dead parent—and when he found himself bereft he naturally visited       wrath upon the head of him who he believed rightly was the cause       of the untimely death of the old man.        As he sat in the study, if such it might be called, of the       departed, before the old-fashioned desk with its household and       farm and business accounts, which in their order and method and       long use were eloquent of his provident and farseeing father, his       heart was hot within his breast. Grief and resentment alike       gnawed at his vitals. They had received vivid reports, even in       the little town in which they dwelt, of the wild doings of the       wanderer, but they had enjoyed no direct communication with him.       After a while even rumour ceased to busy itself with the doings       of the youth. He had dropped out of their lives utterly after he       passed over the hills and far away.        The father had failed slowly for a time, only to break suddenly       and swiftly in the end. And the hurried frantic search for the       missing had brought no results. Ironically the god of chance had       led the young man’s repentant footsteps to the door too late.        “Where’s father?” cried John Carstairs to the startled woman who       stared at him as if she had seen a ghost as, at his knock, she       opened the door which he had found locked, not against him, but       the hour was late and it was the usual nightly precaution:        “Your brother is in your father’s study, sir,” faltered the       servant at last.        “Umph! Will,” said the man, his face changing. “I’d rather see       father first.”        “I think you had better see Mr. William, sir.”        “What’s the matter, Janet?” asked young Carstairs anxiously. “Is       father ill?”        “Yes, sir! indeed I think you had bettor see Mr. William at once,       Mr. John.”        Strangely moved by the obvious agitation of the ancient servitor       of the house who had known him from childhood, John Carstairs       hurried down the long hall to the door of his father’s study.       Always a scapegrace, generally in difficulties, full of mischief,       he had approached that door many times in fear of well merited       punishment which was sure to be meted out to him. And he came to       it with the old familiar apprehension that night, if from a       different cause. He never dreamed that his father was anything       but ill. He must see his brother. He stood in no little awe of       that brother, who was his exact antithesis in almost everything.       They had not got along particularly well. If his father had been       inside the door he would have hesitated with his hand on the       knob. If his father had not been ill he would not have attempted       to face his brother. But his anxiety, which was increased by a       sudden foreboding, for Janet, the maid, had looked at him so       strangely, moved him to quick action. He threw the door open       instantly. What he saw did not reassure him. William was clad in       funeral black. He wore a long frock coat instead of the usual       knockabout suit he affected on the farm. His face was white and       haggard. There was an instant interchange of names.        “John!”        “William!”        And then—        “Is father ill?” burst out the younger.        “Janet said—”        “Dead!” interposed William harshly, all his indignation flaming       into speech and action as he confronted the cause of the       disaster.        “Dead! Good God!”        “God had nothing to do with it.”        “You mean?”        “You did it.”        “I?”        “Yes. Your drunken revelry, your reckless extravagance, your       dissipation with women, your unfeeling silence, your—”        “Stop!” cried the younger. “I have come to my senses, I can’t       bear it.”        “I’ll say it if it kills you. You did it, I repeat. He longed and       prayed and waited and you didn’t come. You didn’t write. We could       hear nothing. The best father on earth.”        The younger man sank down in a chair and covered his face with       his hands.        “When?” he gasped out finally.        “Three days ago.”        “And have you—”        “He is buried beside mother in the churchyard yonder. Now that       you are here I thank God that he didn’t live to see what you have       become.”        The respectable elder brother’s glance took in the disreputable       younger, his once handsome face marred—one doesn’t foregather       with swine in the sty without acquiring marks of the       association—his clothing in rags. Thus errant youth, that was       "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15343"],["title","A Little Book for Christmas (#2)"],["body","no longer, came back from that far country. Under such       circumstances one generally has to walk most of the way. He had       often heard the chimes at midnight, sleeping coldly in the straw       stack of the fields, and the dust of the road clung to his       person. Through his broken shoes his bare feet showed, and he       trembled visibly as the other confronted him, partly from hunger       and weakness and shattered nerves, and partly from shame and       horror and for what reason God only knew.        The tall, handsome man in the long black coat, who towered over       him so grimly stern, was two years older than he, yet to the       casual observer the balance of time was against the prodigal by       at least a dozen years. However, he was but faintly conscious of       his older brother. One word and one sentence rang in his ear.       Indeed, they beat upon his consciousness until he blanched and       quivered beneath their onslaught.        “Dead—you did it!”        Yes, it was just. No mercy seasoned that justice in the heart of       either man. The weaker, self-accusing, sat silent with bowed       head, his conscience seconding the words of the stronger. The       voice of the elder ran on with growing, terrifying intensity.        “Please stop,” interposed the younger. He rose to his feet. “You       are right, Will. You were always right and I was always wrong. I       did kill him. But you need not have told me with such bitterness.       I realized it the minute you said he was dead. It’s true. And yet       I was honestly sorry. I came back to tell him so, to ask his       forgiveness.”        “When your money was gone.”        “You can say that, too,” answered the other, wincing under the       savage thrust. “It’s as true as the rest probably, but sometimes       a man has to get down very low before he looks up. It was that       way with me. Well, I’ve had my share and I’ve had my fling. I’ve       no business here. Good-bye.” He turned abruptly away.        “Don’t add more folly to what you have already done,” returned       William Carstairs, and with the beginnings of a belated pity, he       added, “stay here with me, there will be enough for us both and—”        “I can’t.”        “Well, then,” he drew out of his pocket a roll of bills, “take       these and when you want more—”        “Damn your money,” burst out John Carstairs, passionately. He       struck the other’s outstretched hand, and in his surprise,       William Carstairs let the bills scatter upon the floor. “I don’t       want it—blood money. Father is dead. I’ve had mine. I’ll trouble       you no more.”        He turned and staggered out of the room. Now William Carstairs       was a proud man and John Carstairs had offended him deeply. He       believed all that he had said to his brother, yet there had been       developing a feeling of pity for him in his heart, and in his       cold way he had sought to express it. His magnanimity had been       rejected with scorn. He looked down at the scattered bills on the       floor. Characteristically—for he inherited his father’s business       ability without his heart—he stooped over and picked them slowly       up, thinking hard the while. He finally decided that he would       give his brother yet another chance for his father’s sake. After       all, they were brethren. But the decision came too late. John       Carstairs had stood not on the order of his going, but had gone       at once, none staying him.        William Carstairs stood in the outer door, the light from the       hall behind him streaming out into the night. He could see       nothing. He called aloud, but there was no answer. He had no idea       where his younger brother had gone. If he had been a man of finer       feeling or quicker perception, perhaps if the positions of the       two had been reversed and he had been his younger brother, he       might have guessed that John might have been found beside the       newest mound in the churchyard, had one sought him there. But       that idea did not come to William, and after staring into the       blackness for a long time, he reluctantly closed the door.       Perhaps the vagrant could be found in the morning.        No, there had been no father waiting for the prodigal at the end       of the road, and what a difference it had made to that wanderer       and vagabond!         II        We leave a blank line on the page and denote thereby that ten       years have passed. It was Christmas Eve, that is, it had been       Christmas Eve when the little children had gone to bed. Now       midnight had passed and it was already Christmas morning. In one       of the greatest and most splendid houses on the avenue two little       children were nestled all snug in their beds in a nursery. In an       adjoining room sound sleep had quieted the nerves of the usually       vigilant and watchful nurse. But the little children were       wakeful. As always, visions of Santa Claus danced in their heads.        They were fearless children by nature and had been trained       without the use of bugaboos to keep them in the paths wherein       they should go. On this night of nights they had left the doors       of their nursery open. The older, a little girl of six, was       startled, but not alarmed, as she lay watchfully waiting, by a       creaking sound as of an opened door in the library below. She       listened with a beating heart under the coverlet; cause of       agitation not fear, but hope. It might be, it must be Santa       Claus, she decided. Brother, aged four, was close at hand in his       own small crib. She got out of her bed softly so as not to       disturb Santa Claus, or—more important at the time—the nurse. She       had an idea that Saint Nicholas might not welcome a nurse, but       she had no fear at all that he would not be glad to see her.        Need for a decision confronted her. Should she reserve the       pleasure she expected to derive from the interview for herself or       should she share it with little brother? There was a certain risk       in arousing brother. He was apt to awaken clamant, vociferous.       Still, she resolved to try it. For one thing, it seemed so       selfish to see Santa Claus alone, and for another the adventure       would be a little less timorous taken together.        Slipping her feet into her bedroom slippers and covering her       nightgown with a little blanket wrap, she tip-toed over to       brother’s bed. Fortunately, he too was sleeping lightly, and for       a like reason. For a wonder she succeeded in arousing him without       any outcry on his part. He was instantly keenly, if quietly,       alive to the situation and its fascinating possibilities.        “You must be very quiet, John,” she whispered. “But I think Santa       Claus is down in the library. We’ll go down and catch him.”        Brother, as became the hardier male, disdained further protection       of his small but valiant person. Clad only in his pajamas and his       slippers, he followed sister out the door and down the stair.       They went hand in hand, greatly excited by the desperate       adventure.        What proportion of the millions who dwelt in the great city were       children of tender years only statisticians can say, but       doubtless there were thousands of little hearts beating with       anticipation as the hearts of those children beat, and perhaps       there may have been others who were softly creeping downstairs to       catch Santa Claus unawares at that very moment.        One man at least was keenly conscious of one little soul who,       with absolutely nothing to warrant the expectation, nothing       reasonable on which to base joyous anticipation, had gone to bed       thinking of Santa Claus and hoping that, amidst equally deserving       hundreds of thousands of obscure children, this little mite in       her cold, cheerless garret might not be overlooked by the       generous dispenser of joy. With the sublime trust of childhood       she had insisted upon hanging up her ragged stocking. Santa Claus       would have to be very careful indeed lest things should drop       through and clatter upon the floor. Her heart had beaten, too,       although she descended no stair in the great house. She, too, lay       wakeful, uneasy, watching, sleeping, drowsing, hoping. We may       have some doubts about the eternal springing of hope in the human       breast save in the case of childhood—thank God it is always       verdant there!         III        Now few people get so low that they do not love somebody, and I       dare say that no people get so low that somebody does not love       them.        “Crackerjack,” so called because of his super-excellence in his       chosen profession, was, or had been, a burglar and thief; a very       ancient and highly placed calling indeed. You doubtless remember       that two thieves comprised the sole companions and attendants of       the Greatest King upon the most famous throne in history. His       sole court at the culmination of His career. “Crackerjack” was no       exception to the general rule about loving and being beloved set       forth above.        He loved the little lady whose tattered stocking swung in the       breeze from the cracked window. Also he loved the wretched woman       who with himself shared the honours of parentage to the poor but       hopeful mite who was also dreaming of Christmas and the morning.       And his love inspired him to action. Singular into what devious       courses, utterly unjustifiable, even so exalted and holy an       emotion may lead fallible man. Love—burglary! They do not belong       naturally in association, yet slip cold, need, and hunger in       between and we may have explanation even if there be no       justification. Oh, Love, how many crimes are"]]]
