S. C. could do anything it set out to do, but that there would be countless odds and ends that would occupy us all summer long--\"  \"Like making a continuous stream of furniture!\"  \"And going marketing and doing errands.\"  \"And mowing the grass.\"  \"And playing games with the kids.\"  \"O, a thousand things would crop up; we never could be idle; and so she thought we'd better have a responsible woman as housekeeper.  What's more she said she'd pay her.\"  \"It wouldn't be polite for me to say about a lady what you said about Mr. Watkins,\" said James--  \"For which I apologize,\" declared Roger parenthetically.  \"--but I'd like to remark that she's one of the most reliable grandmothers I ever had anything to do with!\"  They all laughed again.  \"Where we'll get these two women I don't know,\" said Roger.  \"My researches stopped there.  But I suppose it wouldn't be difficult.\"  \"I've heard Mother say that the 'responsible woman' was the hardest person on earth to find,\" said Helen, thoughtfully.  \"But we can all hunt.\"  \"I know some one who might do if she'd be willing--and I don't know why she wouldn't,\" said Ethel Brown.  \"Who?  Who?  Some one in Rosemont?\"  \"Right here in Rosemont.  Mrs. Schuler.\"  \"Mrs. Schuler?\"  There was a cry of wonder, for Mrs. Schuler was the teacher of German in the high school.  She had been engaged to Mr. Schuler, who taught singing in the Rosemont schools, before the war broke out.  Mr. Schuler was called to the colors and lost a leg in the early part of the war. Since he could no longer be useful as a fighter he had been allowed to return to America, and his betrothed had married him at once so that she and her mother, Mrs. Hindenburg, might nurse him back to health. He had been slowly regaining his strength through the winter, and was now fairly well and as cheerful as his crippled state would permit.  \"You know I've been to see Mrs. Hindenburg a good deal ever since we got her to go to the Home to teach the old ladies how to knit,\" said Ethel Brown.  \"I know her pretty well now.  The other day she told me she had had an application from a family who wanted to board with her this summer, and she was so sorry to have to turn them away because she didn't have enough rooms for them.\"  \"I don't see how that helps us any.\"  \"You know Mr. Schuler hasn't been able to take many pupils this winter and I shouldn't wonder if Mrs. Schuler would be glad to have something to do this summer when school is closed.  Now if they would go to our Fresh Air house and take charge there for the summer it would leave Mrs. Hindenburg with enough space to take in her boarders.  She'd be glad, and I should think the Schulers would be glad.\"  \"And we'd be glad!  Why, Fraulein is the grandest housekeeper,\" cried Helen, using the name that Mrs. Schuler's old pupils never remembered to change to \"Frau.\"  \"German housekeepers are thrifty and neat and careful--why, she's exactly the person we want.  How _great_ of you to think of her, Ethel Brown!\"  \"You know she wanted to adopt our Belgian baby, so I guess she's interested in poor children,\" volunteered Ethel Blue.  \"Are our plans far enough along for us to ask her?\" inquired Margaret.  \"We ought to ask her as soon as we can, because Mrs. Hindenburg's plans will be affected by the Schulers' decision,\" Helen reminded them.  \"I think we are far enough along,\" decided Roger.  \"You see, the idea is new to you, but I've been working at it for a good many months now, and if we all pull together to do our share I know we can depend on the grown-ups to do theirs.\"  \"Shall we appoint Ethel Brown to call on Mrs. Schuler and talk it over with her?  She knows her better than the rest of us because she's seen her at home oftener.\"  \"Madam President, I move that Ethel Brown be appointed a committee of one to see our Teutonic friends and work up their sympathies over the women and children we want to help so that they just can't resist helping too.  Is your eloquence equal to that strain, Ethel?\"  Ethel thought it was, and promised to go the very next afternoon.  The discussion turned to the next step to take.  \"Grandfather's superintendent is going to move into the new cottage next week,\" was Roger's news, \"so then we can go over the old house and see how it is arranged and decide how we'd like to change it.\"  \"And also find out just what furniture is left and draw up a list of what furniture we shall need.\"  \"Had we better appoint committees for making the different investigations?\" inquired Tom, who was accustomed to the methods of a city church.  \"Later, perhaps,\" decided Helen.  \"At first I think we all want to know the whole situation and then we can make our plans to fit, and special people can volunteer for special work if we think it can be done best that way.\"  \"It's a great old plan you have there, Roger,\" cried Tom, thumping his friend affectionately on the shoulder.  \"I bow to your giant intellect. We'll do our best to make it a success.\"     CHAPTER II  MOYA AND SHEILA  Elisabeth of Belgium was walking sturdily now on the legs that had been too weak to uphold her when she first came to Rosemont in November. Her increasing strength was an increasing delight to all the people who loved her--and there was no one who knew her who did not love her--but her activity obliged her caretakers to be incessantly on the alert. Miss Merriam, the skilled young woman from the School of Mothercraft, who had pulled her through her period of greatest feebleness, now found herself sometimes quite outdone by the energy of her little charge.  The Ethels were always glad to relieve her of her responsibilities for an hour or two, and it was the afternoon of the day after Roger had reported his plan to the Club that found the cousins strolling down Church Street, \"Ayleesabet\" between them, clinging to a finger of each, not to help her stand upright but to serve as a pair of supports from which she might swing herself off the ground.  \"See!  She lifted her whole weight then!\" exclaimed Ethel Blue.  \"We shall have to give up calling her 'baby' soon.  She's becoming an acrobat!\"  \"It's all due to Miss Merriam.  I wish she didn't look so tired the last few days.\"  Ethel Blue made no reply.  She guessed something of the reason that had made Miss Gertrude appear distressed and silent.  A certain note that she herself had placed in a May basket and hung on Miss Merriam's door might have something to do with her appearance of anxiety.  She changed the subject as a measure of precaution, for she had been in the confidence of Dr. Watkins, the elder brother of Tom and Delia and a warm admirer of Miss Merriam's, and she did not want the conversation to run into channels where she might have to answer inconvenient questions.  \"This scheme of Roger's is pretty tremendous,\" she began by way of introducing a theme in which Ethel Brown would be sure to be interested.  \"We--the Club, I mean--never has 'fallen down' yet on anything, even some of our 'shows' that we didn't have much time to get up, so we ought to have confidence in ourselves as a Club.\"  \"With this next undertaking, though, we don't really know how the thing is done.\"  \"How to make over the house, you mean?\"  \"How to make over the house and how to run the Fresh Air settlement when the house is made over.\"  \"There's no doubt we'll know more at the end of the summer than we know now!  We've got to get information from every source we can.\"  \"The way Roger has up to now.\"  \"We must think of every one we know who has made over a house, and Dr. Watkins ought to be able to tell us of some people who have had Fresh Air children staying with them, so we can get some idea about what they need and how a house is managed.\"  \"Come, come.\"  A chirp rose from near the ground.  Ayleesabet was tired of being disregarded for so long.  \"You blessed Lamb!\" cried Ethel Blue.  \"Did you say, 'Come, come,' just because you heard it?  Did you think we were talking very learnedly about things we didn't know much about!  Never mind, ducky daddles, we'll know a lot about them six months from now!\"  \"Just the way we've learned a lot about babies in the last six months from this little teacher!\" added Ethel Brown.  \"Come, come.  Home, home,\" remarked Elisabeth insistently.  \"What's the matter?  Are your leggies tired?  Want the Ethels to carry you?\"  Elisabeth made it known that she would like some such method of transportation, and sat joyfully on a \"chair\" which the two girls made by interclasping their wrists.  Not for long did this please her ladyship.  \"Down, down,\" she demanded in a few minutes.  \"We might as well go home if she's too tired to walk and too restless to ride,\" decided Ethel Brown, and they turned about, to the evident pleasure of the baby.  As they were returning along Church Street but were still at a distance from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15550"],["title","Ethel Morton at Rose House (#2)"],["body","y's house Elisabeth suddenly gave a chirrup of delight.  The Ethels looked about to see the cause of this unexpected expression of joy.  Crawling out through a hedge on to the sidewalk was a child of about Elizabeth's age, but a thin and dirty little mite, with a face that betrayed her race as Irish.  \"What's this morsel doing here all by herself!\" exclaimed Ethel Blue.  \"She must have run away; or perhaps she isn't alone.  Let's look about for her mother.\"  Up and down the street they looked while Elisabeth scraped acquaintance with the sudden arrival upon her path.  \"It doesn't seem as if she could be far off.\"  In truth she was not far off, for as the girls wondered and exclaimed a weak voice made itself heard from the other side of the hedge.  \"Don't take her away,\" it said.  Leaving the children to entertain each other on the sidewalk they enlarged the hole from which the new baby had crawled, and pushed their way through it.  On the ground behind the hedge, and hidden from the sidewalk by its thick twigs lay a young woman, so pale that she frightened the girls.  \"Don't take the baby away.  I'll feel better in a little while.  She crept off from me.\"  \"How did you get here?\" asked Ethel Brown.  \"I came out from New York to look for work in the country.  I felt so sick I lay down here.\"  \"Did you get any work?\"  A slight movement of the head indicated that she had not.  The Ethels consulted each other by disturbed glances.  There was no hospital nearer than Glen Point, and indeed, the woman seemed so ill that they did not see how she could reach the hospital even in the trolley.  As they stood silent and perplexed the honk of a motor roused the almost unconscious woman.  \"Is the baby in the street?\" she inquired frantically.  Ethel Brown crushed her way through the hedge, and found that the children were still on the sidewalk, but were so near its edge that the driver of the car had tooted to warn them back.  To her delight she saw that the driver was Grandfather Emerson.  She waved her hand to stop him.  \"You're a great caretaker!\" he cried.  \"Why do you leave Elisabeth to look after herself in this fashion?  And who's her friend?\"  Ethel climbed into the machine beside him and told of the discovery that the girls had just made.  Mr. Emerson drew the car alongside the curb and jumped out with anxiety written on his face.  The hole in the hedge was too small for him to push through so he ran around the end, and approached the prostrate form of the woman.  Her eyes were closed and she lay so still that Ethel Blue, who was rubbing her hands, shook her head as she glanced up gratefully at the new arrival.  \"What's this, what's this?\" asked Mr. Emerson in his full, rich voice. Its mere sound seemed to carry comfort to the poor creature lying at his feet.  He knelt beside her.  \"Hungry, eh?\" he asked.  \"We'll see about that right off.  Can you eat these cookies?\"  He took a thin tin box out of his pocket and opened it.  \"I have a little granddaughter named Ethel Brown who insists on my keeping cookies in my pocket all the time so that I can eat them when I'm driving.  See if you can take a bite of this.\"  A fluttering hand took the cooky and put it between the pale lips.  Helped by the girls the woman struggled to her feet and stood wavering before she tried to take a step.  She was a young woman with very black hair and gray-blue eyes and a face that was meant to be unlined and pretty and not gaunt with hunger and furrowed by anxiety.  \"You're very good,\" she whispered feebly.  Supported on each side she managed to reach the sidewalk, where she looked about wildly for her baby.  An expression that was sad but infinitely relieved came over her features when she saw the two children sitting in the gravel of the walk filling their tiny hands with pebbles.  \"A cooky won't hurt the baby either,\" decided Mr. Emerson, and he gave one to each of the children.   The Ethels had no chance to ask him what he meant to do without their discovery hearing them, so they helped the woman into the machine, put in the two children and climbed in themselves.  To their great interest Mr. Emerson turned the car about and headed it for his own home.  \"I wonder what Grandmother will say,\" murmured Ethel Brown to Ethel Blue, who was steadying the ill woman's head as it lay against the back of the seat.  Ethel Blue lifted her eyebrows to indicate that she could not guess; but both girls knew in their hearts that Mrs. Emerson would do what was wisest and for the best good of the strays.  She came to the door in answer to the sound of the horn.  \"How did you get back so soon?\" she began to inquire of her husband when her eyes fell on the passengers in the car.  \"An accident?\" she asked anxiously as she ran down the steps.  \"The girls found this woman and her child part way over here and I thought I'd better bring her on and get your opinion about her.  I think she'd like something to eat,\" and the kind old gentleman smiled in friendly fashion as the woman opened frightened eyes at the sound of a new voice.  Among them they succeeded in getting her into the house and into a cool room, where she lay exhausted on the bed, her hand holding tight to the little hand of her baby, lying wearily beside her.  \"Sunstroke?\" asked Grandmother.  \"Hunger,\" replied Mr. Emerson, and he and Ethel Brown went down stairs at once in search of food, while Mrs. Emerson and Ethel Blue managed to undress their patient and put her into a fresh nightdress and bathe her face and hands.  By the time they had done this and were undressing the baby, Ethel Brown and Mrs. Emerson's cook were at the door with jellied broth, milk, gruel and a cooling drink.  Ethel Blue fed the woman, spoonful by spoonful, and Ethel Brown gave the baby alternate spoonfuls of gruel and milk.  \"Sleepy now?\" asked Mrs. Emerson when the dark head sank back on the pillow.  \"Take a nap, then.  See, the baby is right here where you can lay your hand on her.  We'll look in now and then and just as soon as you wake up you must take some more food.\"  \"Must!\" repeated the girl, for she was hardly older than Miss Merriam they saw when her hair was pushed back from her face.  \"Must!  'Tis _glad_ I'll be to be doing it!\" and a ghost of a smile fluttered her lips.  Outside of the bedroom door Mrs. Emerson asked for an explanation and the others for her advice.  \"I don't see how we can tell what we can do until we pull her through this trouble and find out what the poor soul wants to do herself.\"  \"She said she came out from New York to look for work in the country.\"  \"Then we must find her work in the country.  But the first thing for us to attend to is to get her poor body into such a condition that she can work.  She's a sweet looking young woman.  I'm glad you brought her home, Father,\" and between Mr. and Mrs. Emerson there passed a smile of such understanding as makes beautiful the lives of people long and happily married.     CHAPTER III  THE FARMHOUSE  It took a long time to bring Moya Murphy and little Sheila back to health and strength, but it was only a day or two before Moya was able to tell her story to Mrs. Emerson.  She was twenty-five, she said, and she had come to America with her father and mother five years before.  The New World had not given a warm welcome to the new arrivals, for both of the parents had fallen ill with pneumonia only a few weeks after they landed, and both died within a few days of each other.  Moya, left alone and grieving, had soon after married Patrick Murphy, a lad she had known in the old country.  A happy life they led, especially after little Sheila came to bless them.  When the declaration of war in Europe upset business conditions in America, Patrick lost his \"job\" and all summer long he walked the streets, working for a day now and then, but never securing a permanent position, and always growing weaker and less able to work because he was underfed.  The little three-room flat that had been such a joy to them, had long been given up and they lived and ate and slept in one room, and thanked their stars that they had a landlord who did not insist on being paid regularly, as did some they knew about who put their tenants out on the street if the rent was not forthcoming promptly.  \"Somehow it's the sudden things that happens to me,\" said Moya to Mrs. Emerson.  She was sitting on the latticed back porch of the Emersons' house, her fingers busy shelling peas for Kate, the old cook who had lived with Mrs. Emerson ever since she was married.  \"Patrick was crossing the street--'tis only six weeks ago, but it seems years!  An automobile with one of the shrieking horns screamed at him.  'Twas the policeman on the crossing told me.  Patrick was light on his feet always, but that was when he had enough to eat ivery day.  He thried to jump back and his foot slipped and he fell under the car and it killed him.\"  She sobbed and Mrs. Emerson and Kate wiped their eyes.  \"Two days it was before I knew it; there was nothing on his clothes to tell who he was, and I only found out when he didn't come home and I went to the police and they took me to the Morgue and there he lay. They gave me twenty dollars--the policemen did.  They collected it among themselves.\"  \"Didn't they arrest the driver of the car?\"  \"'Twas a light car and it sped away before any one saw the number.\"  Kate Flanigan gave a grunt of disgust at the brutality of the driver.  \"I gave the landlord half the money the policemen gave me.  I owed it for the rint.  Then I set out to hunt work.  Ivery day I walked and walked and ivery day I carried the baby, for where could I leave her? Nobody wanted a girl who wasn't trained to do anything, and even if I had been able to do something well they wanted no baby.  There's no room for babies when you have to work,\" she said bitterly.  \"I want you to feel that you are safe here, you and Sheila,\" said Mrs. Emerson gently.  \"Mrs. Morton and Mrs. Smith and I have been"]]]
