There was a silent affectionate embrace, and with their arms about each other they sought Elsie's dressing-room.  \"Grandpa and Edward have told me,\" Violet said, \"and you will let me help you, my poor dear sister? help in thinking and selecting what you will want to carry with you.\"  \"Gladly, thankfully, for oh, I seem scarcely able to collect my thoughts! How can I leave mamma and all of you? and the darling little brother and sister so ill! and yet how can I stay away from Lester when he is sick and alone in a strange land, with not a friend to speak a cheering word, smooth his pillow, give his medicine, or see that he has proper food? O Vi, can I help going to him, even at the sacrifice of leaving all other near and dear ones?\"  \"I think our mother would have done it for papa,\" Violet answered, kissing Elsie's cheek.  Mr. Dinsmore having first seen Ben, and found him more than willing to go with the children of the master he had loved as his own soul, went to the library, looked over the papers, and had just found the information he sought, when the sound of horses' hoofs on the avenue drew his attention, and glancing from the window he saw the Roselands carriage drive up with his sister, Mrs. Conly, inside.  He hastened out to assist her to alight.  \"Good-morning, Horace,\" she said. \"Is my son Arthur here?\"  \"Yes, Louise, he has spent the last hour or more in attendance upon our sick little ones. Ah, here he is to speak for himself!\" as the young doctor stepped from the open doorway. \"But won't you come in?\"  She demurred. \"Is there any danger, Arthur?\"  \"Danger of what, mother?\"  \"You certainly understood me,\" she said half angrily; \"danger of contagion, of course.\"  \"None for you, surely, mother, and none you could carry home unless you came in personal contact with the sick children.\"  \"I shall sit here for a moment, then,\" she said, stepping from the carriage and taking a chair upon the veranda. \"How are they to-day?\"  \"The sick little ones? The disease has not yet reached its crisis.\"  \"I hope they'll get safely over it: it's a good thing to have over. How soon can you be spared from here, Arthur?\"  \"Now, mother, if I am needed elsewhere, I shall not be needed here--at least am not likely to be--for some hours.\"  \"Then I wish you'd come home directly to see what you can do for your grandfather. He doesn't seem at all well to-day.\"  \"My father ill?\" Mr. Dinsmore exclaimed in a tone of alarm and concern.  \"It hardly amounts to that, I presume,\" Mrs. Conly answered coldly; \"but he is not well; didn't eat a mouthful of breakfast.\"  \"Grandpa, did you find what you wanted in the morning paper?\" queried Edward, joining them at this moment. \"Ah, Aunt Louise, how d'ye do?\"  She nodded indifferently, listening with some curiosity for her brother's reply.  \"Yes,\" he said; \"and I think you should leave to-night; for by so doing you will reach New York in time to take the next steamer, if you meet with no great detention on the way. Do you think you can both be ready?\"  \"I certainly can, sir, and have no doubt Elsie will also.\"  \"What is it? off to Europe?\" asked Mrs. Conly in surprise. \"What should call you two children there at this time?\"  Mr. Dinsmore briefly stated the facts, giving the news of the morning, Elsie's wish, and Edward's offer to be her escort to Italy.  \"If she were a daughter of mine, I should consider a female companion an absolute necessity,\" was Mrs. Conly's comment.  \"She will take her maid of course,\" said Mr. Dinsmore and Edward, both speaking at once.  \"Pooh! a maid! I mean a lady relative or friend. I said a companion, and that a maid could not be.\"  \"I should be extremely glad if such could be found in the few hours that we have for our preparations,\" said her brother, \"but I know of none; the Fairview family are absent, Violet is too young----\"  \"Of course,\" interrupted Mrs. Conly; \"but there are other relatives. I would go myself if my means would warrant the expense.\"  \"If you are in earnest, Louise, you need not hesitate for a moment on that score; it shall not cost you a penny,\" her brother said, looking at her in pleased but half-incredulous surprise.  \"I was never more in earnest,\" she answered. \"I don't think you give me much credit for affection for your grandchildren, yet I certainly care too much for the one in question to willingly see her undertake such a journey without the support of female companionship. And I can be spared from home if you and Arthur will look after father; I have no young child now, and Aunt Maria is fully capable of taking charge of all household matters. If you wish me to go you have only to say so and guarantee my expenses, and I shall go home, oversee the packing of my trunks, and be ready as soon as the young people are.\"  \"Your offer is a most kind one, Louise, and I accept it even without waiting to consult with my daughter,\" Mr. Dinsmore said.  \"Then I must go home at once, and set about my preparations immediately,\" she said, rising to take leave.  Arthur Conly as well as Edward Travilla had been a surprised but silent listener to the short dialogue.  \"Can you spare your mother, Arthur?\" his uncle asked.  \"We must, sir, if it pleases her to go, and for the sake of my two sweet cousins--Elsie senior and Elsie junior--I willingly consent. You take the night train I understand?\" turning to Edward.  \"Yes; to-night.\"  \"I shall see that my mother is at the dep√¥t in season;\" and with that they took their departure, Mr. Dinsmore saying, as he bade them adieu, that he should ride over presently to see his father.  Turning toward Edward, he saw that the lad's eyes were following the Roselands' carriage down the avenue, his face wearing a rueful look.  \"Grandpa,\" he said with a sigh, \"I see no necessity for Aunt Louise's company, and, indeed, should very much prefer to be without it.\"  \"You forget that you are speaking to your grandfather of his sister,\" Mr. Dinsmore answered, with a touch of sternness in his tone.  \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" returned Edward. \"She is so unlike you that I am apt to forget the relationship.\"  \"I know you do not always find your aunt's company agreeable,\" remarked Mr. Dinsmore, \"and I do not blame you on that account, yet I think it will be an advantage to you, and especially to your sister, to have with you a woman of her age and knowledge of the world. I wish I could go with you myself, but I cannot think of leaving either my old father or your mother in this time of trial.\"  \"No, sir, oh no! Delightful as it would be to both of us for you to make one of our little party, we would not for the world deprive dear mamma of the support and comfort of your presence here; nor our dear old grandfather either.\"     CHAPTER III.                            \"Filial ingratitude?     Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand     For lifting food to 't?\"    --_Shaks. Lear_.   \"This is a very sudden resolve of yours, mother, isn't it?\" Dr. Conly asked, as they drove through the great gates at Ion, into the highway.  \"It is, Arthur, for I had not dreamed of such a wild scheme on the part of those two silly children until I heard of it from their grandfather's lips; nor could have believed he would sanction such folly. They ought to make Elsie stay where she is, and if young Leland dies it will but rid the family of a prospective plebeian alliance.\"  \"Very possibly of the sweet girl also,\" was Arthur's grave response.  \"Nonsense! it is only in novels that girls die of broken hearts.\"  \"Granting that for argument's sake, it must be very hard to live with one.\"  \"Well; it seems she is to be allowed to go, and my offer removes the most serious objection; yet I have no idea that the sacrifice on my part will be at all appreciated.\"  \"Then why make it, mother? I can readily find a substitute; there is Mrs. Foster, whose health would be greatly benefited by a long sea voyage. She, I feel certain, would think it a great boon to be allowed this opportunity of going without expense and in the company of two young people of whom she is very fond. And you know, mother, that though poor now she was formerly wealthy, is a perfect lady, and her having been to Europe once or twice would make her all the more valuable companion to them.\"  \"You are quite too late with your suggestion, Arthur,\" was the coldly spoken reply. \"I have passed my word and shall not break it.\"  Her son gave her a look of keen scrutiny, then turned his face from her with a scarcely audible sigh. He read her motives and feelings far more clearly than she suspected.  The truth was she was weary of the dulness of home now that the shadow of bereavement was upon it, and the etiquette of mourning forbade her attendance upon public assemblages of whatever kind, except church, and did not allow even so much as a formal call upon strangers or acquaintance. The society of her now old, feeble, and depressed father was wearisome to her also.  Beside she had long had a hankering after a European tour, and this was too good an opportunity to let slip. Also it would give her a chance to see for herself what was the trouble with Virginia, whose letters of late had been of a very disquieting kind; full of reproaches and vague hints of unhappiness and disappointment in her new life.  There would probably be a few hours between their arrival in New York and the sailing of the steamer, in which she could call to see Virginia and learn with certainty exactly how she was situated.  Mrs. Travilla received the news of her aunt's offer with a gratitude which it by no means merited, and the younger Elsie, though not fond of her Aunt Louise's society, felt that her presence might prove a comfort and support when she and Edward should find themselves strangers in a foreign land.  The mother sought this dear eldest child with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14884"],["title","Famous Violinists of To-day and Yesterday (#1)"],["body","his Fingers to the end of the Fingerboard of the Violin, and run them back insensibly, and all with alacrity, and in very good tune, which he nor any in England saw the like before.\"  At the Restoration Baltzar was appointed leader of the king's celebrated band of twenty-four violins, but, sad to relate, \"Being much admired by all lovers of musick, his company was therefore desired; and company, especially musical company, delighting in drinking, made him drink more than ordinary, which brought him to his grave.\" And he was buried in the cloister of Westminster Abbey.  John Banister was taught music by his father, one of the _waits_ of the parish of St. Giles, and acquiring great proficiency on the violin was noticed by King Charles II., who sent him to France for improvement. On his return he was appointed chief of the king's violins. King Charles was an admirer of everything French, and he appears, according to Pepys, to have aroused the wrath of Banister by giving prominence to a French fiddler named Grabu, who is said to have been an \"impudent pretender.\" Banister lost his place for saying, either to or in the hearing of the king, that English performers on the violin were superior to those of France.  John Banister lived in times when fiddle playing was not highly esteemed, if we may judge by the following ordinance, made in 1658: \"And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that if any person or persons, commonly called Fiddlers, or minstrels, shall at any time after the said first day of July be taken playing, Fiddling, or making music in any inn, alehouse, or tavern or shall be proffering themselves, or desiring, or entreating any person or persons to hear them play ... shall be adjudged ... rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars.\"  John Banister seems to have been a somewhat \"sturdy beggar,\" though not exactly in the sense meant by the ordinance, for he established regular concerts at his house, \"now called the Musick-school, over against the George Tavern in Whitefriars.\" These concerts began in 1672, and continued till near his death, which occurred in 1679. He too, was buried in the cloister of Westminster Abbey. His son, also, was an excellent performer on the violin, and played first violin in the Italian opera when it was first introduced into England. He was one of the musicians of Charles II., James II., William and Mary, and of Queen Anne.  Henry Eccles, who lived about the end of the seventeenth century, went to France, where he became a member of the king's band, and William Corbett, who went to Italy to study the violin in 1710, was a player of much ability; but one of the most eminent of English violinists was Matthew Dubourg, born 1703, who played at a concert when he was so small that he was placed on a stool in order that he might be seen. At eleven years of age he was placed under Geminiani, who had recently established himself in London. Dubourg was appointed, in 1728, Master and Composer of State-Music in Ireland, and on the death of Festing, in 1752, he became leader of the king's band in London, and held both posts until his death in 1767.  An amusing incident is related of Dubourg and Handel. The latter visited Dublin and presided at a performance of the \"Messiah.\" A few evenings later, Dubourg, who was leader of the band at the Theatre, had to improvise a \"close,\" and wandered about in a fit of abstract modulation for so long that he forgot the original key. At last, however, after a protracted shake, he landed safely on the key-note, when Handel called out in a voice loud enough to be heard in the remotest parts of the theatre, \"Welcome home, welcome home, Mr. Dubourg.\"  Dubourg's name is the first on record in connection with the performance of a concerto in an English theatre.  John Clegg, a pupil of Dubourg, was a violinist of great ability, whom Handel placed at the head of the opera band, but his faculties became deranged by intense study and practice, and he died at a comparatively early age, in 1742, an inmate of Bedlam.  Another very promising young English violinist was Thomas Linley, who exhibited great musical powers, and performed a concerto in public when eight years old. He was sent to Italy to study under Nardini, and through the mediation of that artist he became acquainted with Mozart, who was about the same age. Linley's career was prematurely closed, for at the age of twenty-two he was drowned through the capsizing of a pleasure-boat.  This completes the list of English violinists of note who were born previous to the nineteenth century. The later ones we shall find in their place in succeeding chapters, but there have been very few violinists of English birth who have followed the career of the \"virtuoso.\" Even Antonio James Oury, who made a series of concert tours lasting nine years, during which he occasionally appeared in conjunction with De B√©riot and Malibran, is hardly known as a \"virtuoso,\" and was not all English. But there are pathetic circumstances in regard to the career of Oury. He was the son of an Italian of noble descent, who had served as an officer in the army of Napoleon, and had been taken prisoner by the English. Making the best of his misfortunes the elder Oury settled in England, married a Miss Hughes, and became a professor of dancing and music.  The son, Antonio, began to learn the violin at the age of three, in which he was a year or two ahead of the average virtuoso, and he made great progress. By and by he heard Spohr, and after that his diligence increased, for he practised, during seven months, not less than fourteen hours a day. Even Paganini used to sink exhausted after ten hours' practice. In 1820, we are told, he went to Paris and studied under Baillot, Kreutzer, and Lafont, receiving from each two lessons a week for several successive winters. With such an imposing array of talent at his service much might be expected of Mr. Oury, and he actually made his d√©but at the Philharmonic concerts in London.  There was another unfortunate officer of Napoleon who became tutor to the Princesses of Bavaria. His name was Belleville. Mr. Oury met his daughter, and, there being naturally a bond of sympathy between them, they married. She was an amiable and accomplished pianist, and together they made the nine years' concert tour.  During the period in which the art of violin playing was being perfected on the Continent, the English were too fully occupied with commercial pursuits to foster and develop the art. Up to the present day the most eminent virtuoso is commonly spoken of as a \"fiddler.\" Even Joachim, when he went to a barber's shop in High Street, Kensington, and declined to accept the advice of the tonsorial artist, and have his hair cropped short, was warned that \"he'd look like one o' them there fiddler chaps.\" The barber apparently had no greater estimation of the violinist's art than the latter had of the tonsorial profession, and the situation was sufficiently ludicrous to form the subject of a picture in _Punch_, and thus the matter assumed a serious aspect.  England has not been the home of any particular school of violin playing, but has received her stimulus from Continental schools, to which her sons have gone to study, and from which many eminent violinists have been imported.  The word \"school,\" so frequently used in connection with the art of violin playing, seems to lead to confusion. The Italian school, established by Corelli, appears to have been the only original school. Its pupils scattered to various parts of Europe, and there established other schools. To illustrate this statement, we will follow in a direct line from Corelli, according to the table given in Grove's Dictionary.  The pupils of Corelli were Somis, Locatelli, Geminiani (Italians), and An√™t (a Frenchman), whose pupil Senaill√© was also French. The greatest pupil of Somis was Pugnani, an Italian, and his greatest pupil was Viotti, a Piedmontese, who founded the French school, and from him came Roberrechts, his pupil De B√©riot and his pupil Vieuxtemps, the two latter Belgians, also Baillot, etc., down to Marsick and Sarasate, a Spaniard, while through Rode, a Frenchman, we have B√∂hm (school of Vienna) and his pupil Joachim, a Hungarian (school of Berlin).  Several violinists are found under two schools, as for instance, Pugnani, who was first a pupil of Tartini and later of Somis, and Teresa Milanollo, pupil of Lafont and of De B√©riot, who appear under different schools.  The only conclusion to be drawn is that the greatest violinists were really independent of any school, and, by their own genius, broke loose from tradition and established schools of their own. Some of them, on the other hand, had but few pupils, as for instance, Paganini, who had but two, and Sarasate. Many also were teachers rather than performers. We have to deal chiefly with the virtuosi.     CHAPTER II.  1650 TO 1750.   Arcangelo Corelli, whose name is recognised as one of the greatest in the history of violin playing and composition, and who laid the foundation for all future development of technique, was born in 1653, at Fusignano, near Imola, in the territory of Bologna.  He showed an early propensity for the violin, and studied under Bassani, a man of extensive knowledge and capabilities, while Mattei Simonelli was his instructor in counterpoint.  Corelli at one time sought fame away from home, and he is said to have visited Paris, where Lulli, the chief violinist of that city, exhibited such jealousy and violence that the mild-tempered Corelli withdrew. In 1680 he went to Germany, where he was well received, and entered the service of the Elector of Bavaria, but he soon returned to Rome. His proficiency had now become so great that his fame extended throughout Europe, and pupils flocked to him. His playing was characterised by refined taste and elegance, and by a firm and even tone.
