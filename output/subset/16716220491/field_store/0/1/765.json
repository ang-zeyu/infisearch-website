Here, deer with dappled fawn bound o'er the grass,[6]   And sacred herds, and sheep with skipping lambs;   There, great white elephants in quiet nooks;   While high on cliffs framed in with living green   Goats climb and seem to hang and feed in air--   Sweet spot, with all to please and nothing to offend.    Here on a hill the royal palace stood,   A gem of art; and near, another hill,   Its top crowned by an aged banyan tree,   Its sides clad in strange jyotismati grass,[7]   By day a sober brown, but in the night   Glowing as if the hill were all aflame--   Twin wonders to the dwellers in the plain,   Their guides and landmarks day and night,   This glittering palace and this glowing hill.   Within, above the palace rose a tower,   Which memory knew but as the ancient tower,   Foursquare and high, an altar and a shrine   On its broad top, where burned perpetual fire,   Emblem of boundless and eternal love   And truth that knows no night, no cloud, no change,   Long since gone out, with that most ancient faith   In one great Father, source of life and light.[8]   Still round this ancient tower, strange hopes and fears,   And memories handed down from sire to son,   Were clustered thick.  An army, old men say,   Once camped against the city, when strange lights   Burst from this tower, blinding their dazzled eyes.   They fled amazed, nor dared to look behind.   The people bloody war and cruel bondage saw   On every side, and they at peace and free,   And thought a power to save dwelt in that tower.   And now strange prophecies and sayings old   Were everywhere rehearsed, that from this hill   Should come a king or savior of the world.   Even the poor dwellers in the distant plain   Looked up; they too had heard that hence should come   One quick to hear the poor and strong to save.   And who shall dare to chide their simple faith?   This humble reverence for the great unknown   Brings men near God, and opens unseen worlds,   Whence comes all life, and where all power doth dwell.    Morning and evening on this tower the king,   Before the rising and the setting sun,   Blindly, but in his father's faith, bowed down.   Then he would rise and on his kingdom gaze.   East, west, hills beyond hills stretched far away,   Wooded, terraced, or bleak and bald and bare,   Till in dim distance all were leveled lost.   One rich and varied carpet spread far south,   Of fields, of groves, of busy cities wrought,   With mighty rivers seeming silver threads;   And to the north the Himalayan chain,   Peak beyond peak, a wall of crest and crag,   Ice bound, snow capped, backed by intensest blue,   Untrod, immense, that, like a crystal wall.   In myriad varied tints the glorious light   Of rising and of setting sun reflects;   His noble city lying at his feet,   And his broad park, tinged by the sun's slant rays   A thousand softly rich and varied shades.    Still on this scene of grandeur, plenty, peace   And ever-varying beauty, he would gaze   With sadness.  He had heard these prophecies,   And felt the unrest in that great world within,   Hid from our blinded eyes, yet ever near,   The very soul and life of this dead world,   Which seers and prophets open-eyed have seen,   On which the dying often raptured gaze,   And where they live when they are mourned as dead.   This world was now astir, foretelling day.   \"A king shall come, they say, to rule the world,   If he will rule; but whence this mighty king?   My years decline apace, and yet no son   Of mine to rule or light my funeral pile.\"    One night Queen Maya, sleeping by her lord,   Dreamed a strange dream; she dreamed she saw a star   Gliding from heaven and resting over her;   She dreamed she heard strange music, soft and sweet,   So distant \"joy and peace\" was all she heard.   In joy and peace she wakes, and waits to know   What this strange dream might mean, and whence it came.    Drums, shells and trumpets sound for joy, not war;   The streets are swept and sprinkled with perfumes,   And myriad lamps shine from each house and tree,   And myriad flags flutter in every breeze,   And children crowned with flowers dance in the streets,   And all keep universal holiday   With shows and games, and laugh and dance and song,   For to the gentle queen a son is born,   To King Suddhodana the good an heir.    But scarcely had these myriad lamps gone out,   The sounds of revelry had scarcely died,   When coming from the palace in hot haste,   One cried, \"Maya, the gentle queen, is dead.\"   Then mirth was changed to sadness, joy to grief,   For all had learned to love the gentle queen--   But at Siddartha's birth this was foretold.    Among the strangers bringing gifts from far,   There came an ancient sage--whence, no one knew--   Age-bowed, head like the snow, eyes filmed and white,   So deaf the thunder scarcely startled him,   Who met them, as they said, three journeys back,   And all his talk was of a new-born king,   Just born, to rule the world if he would rule.   He was so gentle, seemed so wondrous wise,   They followed him, he following, he said,   A light they could not see; and when encamped,   Morn, noon and night devoutly would he pray,   And then would talk for hours, as friend to friend,   With questionings about this new-born king,   Gazing intently at the tent's blank wall,   With nods and smiles, as if he saw and heard,   While they sit lost in wonder, as one sits   Who never saw a telephone, but hears   Unanswered questions, laughter at unheard jests,   And sees one bid a little box good-by.   And when they came before the king, they saw,   Laughing and cooing on its mother's knee,   Picture of innocence, a sweet young child;   He saw a mighty prophet, and bowed down   Eight times in reverence to the very ground,   And rising said, \"Thrice happy house, all hail!   This child would rule the world, if he would rule,   But he, too good to rule, is born to save;   But Maya's work is done, the devas wait.\"   But when they sought for him, the sage was gone,   Whence come or whither gone none ever knew.   Then gentle Maya understood her dream.   The music nearer, clearer sounds; she sleeps.   But when the funeral pile was raised for her,   Of aloe, sandal, and all fragrant woods,   And decked with flowers and rich with rare perfumes,   And when the queen was gently laid thereon,   As in sweet sleep, and the pile set aflame,   The king cried out in anguish; when the sage   Again appeared, and gently said, \"Weep not!   Seek not, O king, the living with the dead!   'Tis but her cast-off garment, not herself,   That now dissolves in air.  Thy loved one lives,   Become thy deva,[9] who was erst thy queen.\"   This said, he vanished, and was no more seen.    Now other hands take up that mother's task.   Another breast nurses that sweet young child   With growing love; for who can nurse a child,   Feel its warm breath, and little dimpled hands,   Kiss its soft lips, look in its laughing eyes,   Hear its low-cooing love-notes soft and sweet,   And not feel something of that miracle,   A mother's love--so old yet ever new,   Stronger than death, bravest among the brave,   Gentle as brave, watchful both night and day,   That never changes, never tires nor sleeps.   Whence comes this wondrous and undying love?   Whence can it come, unless it comes from heaven,   Whose life is love--eternal, perfect love!    From babe to boy, from boy to youth he grew,   But more in grace and knowledge than in years.   At play his joyous laugh rang loud and clear,   His foot was fleetest in all boyish games,   And strong his arm, and steady nerve and eye,   To whirl the quoit and send the arrow home;   Yet seeming oft to strive, he'd check his speed   And miss his mark to let a comrade win.   In fullness of young life he climbed the cliffs   Where human foot had never trod before.   He led the chase, but when soft-eyed gazelles   Or bounding deer, or any harmless thing,   Came in the range of his unerring dart,   He let them pass; for why, thought he, should men   In wantonness make war on innocence?    One day the Prince Siddartha saw the grooms   Gathered about a stallion, snowy white,   Descended from that great Nisaean stock   His fathers brought from Iran's distant plain,   Named Kantaka.  Some held him fast with chains   Till one could mount.  He, like a lion snared,   Frantic with rage and fear, did fiercely bound.   They cut his tender mouth with bloody bit,   Beating his foaming sides until the Prince,   Sterner than was his wont, bade them desist,   While he spoke soothingly, patted his head   And stroked his neck, and dropped those galling chains,   When Kantaka's fierce"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14369"],["title","The Young Engineers on the Gulf (#1)"],["body"," \"_High School Boys Series_\". Here their really brilliant work Boys Series athletes was stirringly chronicled, as along with scores of non-athletic adventures that befell them.  At the close of the high school course Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes secured appointments as cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point.  All that befell them there is duly set forth in the \"_West Point Series_.\"  Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell were fortunate enough to secure appointments as midshipmen in the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, and their doings there are set forth in the \"_Annapolis Series_.\"  Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, on the other hand, had felt no call to military glory.  For their work in life they longed to become part of the great constructive force wielded by modern civil engineers.  During the latter part of their high school work they had studied hard with ambition to become surveyors and civil engineers.  In their school vacations they had sought training and experience in the offices of an engineering firm in their home town of Gridley.  After being graduated from the Gridley High School, Tom and Harry had done more work in the same offices.  Then, in a sudden desire for advancement, and possessed by the longing for a wider field of endeavor, Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton had secured positions as \"cub engineers\" on the construction work that was being done to rush a new railway, system over the Rocky Mountains in Colorado.  The stern, hard work that lay before them, the many adventures in a rough wilderness, and the chain of circumstances that at last placed Tom Reade in charge of the railroad building, with Harry as first assistant engineer, are all told in the first volume of this present series, \"_The Young Engineers In Colorado_.\"  That great feat finished satisfactorily, the ambition of our young engineers led them further afield, as told in \"_The Young Engineers in Arizona_.\"  A great, man-killing quicksand had to be filled in and effectively stopped from shifting.  Reade & Hazelton undertook the task. Incidentally Tom came into serious, dangerous conflict with gamblers and other human birds-of-prey, who had heretofore fattened on the earnings of the railway laborers.  It was a tremendously exciting time that the young engineers had in Arizona, but they at last got away with their lives and were at the same time immensely successful in their undertaking.  In \"_The Young Engineers In Nevada_\" we found our young friends under changed conditions.  While at work in Colorado and in Arizona Tom and Harry had studied the occurrence of precious ores, and also the methods of assaying and extracting ores.  Having their time wholly to themselves after finishing in Arizona the dauntless young pair went to Nevada, there to study mining at first hand.  In time they located a mining claim, though there were other claimants, and around this latter fact hung an extremely exciting story.  Both young engineers nearly lost their lives in Nevada, and met with many strenuous situations.  Their sole idea in pushing their mine forward to success was that the money so earned would enable them to further their greatest ambition; they longed to have their own engineering offices.  In the end, their mine, which the young engineers had named \"The Ambition,\" proved a success.  Thereupon they left their mining partner, Jim Ferrers, in charge and went east to open their offices.  We next found the young engineers engaged to the south of the United States border.  These adventures were fully set forth in the preceding volume in this series, entitled \"_The Young Engineers in Mexico_.\"  Tom and Harry, engaged to solve some problems in a great Mexican mine, found themselves the intended tools of a pair of mine swindlers of wealth and influence. From their first realization of the swindle Tom and Harry, even in the face of threats of assured death, held out for an honest course.  How they struggled to save a syndicate of American investors from being swindled out of millions of dollars was splendidly told in that fourth volume.  And now we find our young friends down at the gulf coast town of Blixton, Alabama.  Here they are engaged in a kind of engineering work wholly unlike any they had hitherto undertaken.  The owners of the Melliston Steamship Line, with a fleet of twenty-two freight steamships engaged in the West Indian and Central American trade, had looked in vain for suitable dock accommodations for their vessels, worth a total of more than six million dollars.  In their efforts to improve their service the Melliston owners had found at Blixton a harbor that would have suited them excellently, but for one objection.  The bay at Blixton was too open to shelter vessels from the severity of some of the winter gales.  Up to the present time Blixton had not been used for harbor purposes.  But the Melliston owners had conceived the idea that a great breakwater could be so built as to shelter the waters of the bay.  They had quietly bought up most of the shore front of the little town, which had railway connection.  Then they had searched about for engineers capable of building the needed breakwater.  Reade & Hazelton, hearing of the project, had applied for the work.  As the young men furnished most excellent recommendations from former employers they had finally secured the opportunity.  By no means was the task an easy one, as will presently be shown.  It was a work that would have to be carried on in the very teeth of jealous Nature.  Tom and Harry were fully aware of the great difficulties that lay before them.  What they did not know was that they would presently have to contend, also, with forces set loose by wicked human minds.  What started these untoward forces in operation, and how the forces worked out, will soon be seen.  Captain of a queer crew was Tom Reade, and Harry was his lieutenant.  Of the laborers, seven hundred in number, some four hundred were negroes; there were also two hundred Italians and about a hundred Portuguese.  Many, of each race, were skilled masons; others were but unskilled laborers. There were six foremen, all Americans, and a superintendent, also American. There were a few more Americans and two or three Scotchmen, employed as stationary engineers and in similar lines of work.  A touch of the old Arizona trouble had invaded the camp.  There had recently been a pay-day, and gamblers had descended upon the camp of tents and shanties.  Once more Reade had driven off the gamblers, though this time with less trouble than in Arizona.  At Blixton, Tom had merely sent for the four peace officers in the town of Blixton, and had had the gamblers warned out of camp.  They had gone, but there had been wrathful mutterings among many of the workmen.  The camp was a half mile back from the water's edge, on a low hillside. Here the men of the outfit were settled.  There had been mutinous mutterings among some of the men, but so far there had been no open revolt.  Tom, however, who had had considerable experience in such matters, looked for some form of trouble before the smouldering excitement quieted.  So did Harry.  On this dark night Tom had proposed that he and his chum take a stroll down to the shore front to see whether all were well there.  Soon after leaving camp behind, the young engineers had started on a jog-trot.  Just before they reached the water's edge the wind had borne to their ears the faint report of what must have been an explosion out over the waters of the gulf.  \"Trouble!\" Tom whispered in his chum's ear.  \"Most likely some of the rascals that we drove out of camp have been trying to set back our work with dynamite.  If they have done so we'll teach 'em a lesson if we can catch them!\"  So the young engineers had started out over their narrow retaining wall. We have seen how they had walked most of the distance when Harry had had his sudden warning of the hostile arm uplifted over his head.  \"What could it have been?\" demanded Tom in a low voice, as he continued to cast the light from his flash lamp out over the waters on either side of the wall.  \"It must have been my nervous imagination,\" admitted Harry.  \"Whew!  But it _did_ seem mighty real for the moment.\"  \"Then you're inclined, now, to believe that it was purely imagination?\" pursued Tom.  \"Ye---e---es, it must have been,\" assented Harry reluctantly.  Tom made some final casts with the light.  While they were conversing, well past the short radius of the flash lamp's glare, a massive black head bobbed up and down with the waves.  Out there the huge negro who had swiftly vanished from the wall, and who had swum under water for a long distance, was indolently treading water.  Wholly at home in the gulf, the man's black head blended with the darkness of the water and the blackness of the night.  \"Oh, then,\" suggested Reade, \"we may as well go along on our way.  Plainly there's nothing human around here to look at but ourselves.\"  So they started slowly forward over the wall.  Leisurely the black man swam to the wall, taking up the dogged trail again in the darkness behind the pair of young engineers.  Several minutes more of cautious walking brought Tom Reade to a startled halt.  \"Look there, Harry!\" uttered Reade, stopping and throwing the light ahead.  Out beyond them, not far from the end of the wall, some hundred feet of the top had been torn away.  For all the young engineers could see, the foundations might have gone with the superstructure.  \"Dynamite!\" Tom muttered grimly.  \"So this is the way our newly-found enemies will fight us?\"  \"It won't be such a big job to repair this gap,\" muttered Harry calmly.  \"No; but it'll take a good many dollars to pay the bills,\" retorted Tom.  \"Well, the expense can't be charged to us, anyway,\" maintained Harry.  \"We didn't do this vandal's work, and we didn't authorize its being done.\"  \"No; but you know why it was done, Harry,\"  Tom continued.  \"It was because we drove the "]]]
