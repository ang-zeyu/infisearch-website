For a time he took up his quarters in Darmstadt; but he missed the attractions of Frankfort; so throughout his term he travelled on the railroad twice daily between the two towns. In addition to his regular work at the Conservatory, he undertook private lessons, going by train once a week to the Erbach-Fürstenau castle at Erbach-Fürstenau, a wearisome three-hour journey. The castle was a mediæval _Schloss_, with a drawbridge and moat. There his pupils were little counts and countesses, discouragingly dull and sleepy children who spoke only German and Latin, and who had the smallest interest in music. MacDowell gave them lessons in harmony as well as piano-playing, and one day, in the middle of an elaborately simplified exposition of some rudimentary point, he heard a gentle noise, looked around from the piano, and discovered his noble young pupils with their heads on their arms, fast asleep. MacDowell could never remember their different titles, and ended by addressing them simply as \"mademoiselle\" and \"monsieur,\" to the annoyance of the stern and ceremonious old châtelaine, the Baroness of Rodenberg.  The twelve hours a week which he spent in railway travelling were not, though, wholly unprofitable, for he was able to compose on the train the greater part of his second \"Modern Suite\" for piano (op. 14). This was the second of his compositions which he considered worthy of preservation, its predecessor being the \"First Modern Suite,\" written the year before in Frankfort. Much other music had already found its way upon paper, had been tried in the unsparing fire of his criticism, which was even then vigorous and searching, and had been marked for destruction--a symphony, among other efforts. His reading at this time was of engrossing interest to him. He was absorbed in the German poets; Goethe and Heine, whom he was now able to read with ease in the original German, he knew by heart--a devotion which was to find expression a few years later in his \"Idyls\" and \"Poems\" (op. 28 and 31). He had begun also to read the English poets. He devoured Byron and Shelley; and in Tennyson's \"Idyls of the King\" he found the spark which kindled his especial love for mediæval lore and poetry. Yet while he was enamored of the imaginative records of the Middle Ages, he had little interest, oddly enough, in their tangible remains. He liked, for example, to summon a vision of the valley of the Rhone, with its slow-moving human streams flowing between Italy and the North, and with Sion still looking down from its heights, where the bishops had been lords rather than priests. But this was for him a purely imaginative enchantment. He cared little about exploring the actual and visible memorials of the past: to confront them as crumbling ruins gave him no pleasure, and, as he used to say, he \"hated the smells.\" It was this instinct which, in his visits to the cathedrals, prompted him to stand as far back as possible while the Mass was being said. To see in the dim distance the white, pontifical figures moving gravely through the ritual, to hear the low tones, enthralled and stirred him; but he shrank from entering the sacristy, with its loud-voiced priests describing perfunctorily the relics: that was a disillusionment not to be borne with.  [Illustration: A SKETCH OF LISZT BY MACDOWELL DRAWN IN 1883]  Having found that his labours at Darmstadt were telling upon his health, MacDowell resigned his position there and returned to Frankfort. Here he divided his time between his private teaching and his composition. He was ambitious also to secure some profitable concert engagements as a pianist. He had made occasional appearances at orchestral concerts in Wiesbaden, Frankfort, Darmstadt, but these had yielded him no return save an increase of reputation.  At Raff's instigation he visited Liszt at Weimar in the spring of 1882, armed with his first piano concerto (op. 15). This work he had just composed under amusing circumstances. One day while he was sitting aimlessly before his piano there came a knock at his door, and in walked, to his startled confusion, his master, Raff, of whom MacDowell stood in unmitigated awe. \"The honor,\" he relates, \"simply overwhelmed me. He looked rather quizzically around at my untidy room, and said something about the English translation of his _Welt-Ende_ oratorio (I found out after, alas, that he had wanted me to copy it in his score for him; but with his inexplicable shyness he only hinted at it, and I on my side was too utterly and idiotically overpowered to catch his meaning); then he abruptly asked me what I had been writing. I, scarcely realising what I was saying, stammered out that I had a concerto. He walked out on the landing and turned back, telling me to bring it to him the next Sunday. In desperation, not having the remotest idea how I was to accomplish such a task, I worked like a beaver, evolving the music from some ideas upon which I had planned at some time to base a concerto. Sunday came, and I had only the first movement composed. I wrote him a note making some wretched excuse, and he put it off until the Sunday after. Something happened then, and he put it off two days more; by that time I had the concerto ready.\" Except for three lines of passage work in the first part, the concerto remains to-day precisely as MacDowell finished it then.  In the event, the visit to Liszt, which he had dreaded, was a gratifying surprise. That beneficent but formidable personage received him with kindly courtesy, and had Eugen D'Albert, who was present, play the orchestral part of the concerto which MacDowell had brought with him in manuscript, arranged for two pianos. Liszt listened attentively as the two young musicians played it through,--not too effectively,--and when they had finished he commended it in warm terms. \"You must bestir yourself,\" he warned D'Albert, \"if you do not wish to be outdone by our young American\"; and he praised the boldness and originality of certain passages in the music, especially their harmonic treatment.  What was at that time even more cheering to MacDowell, who had not yet come to regard himself as paramountly a composer, was Liszt's praise of his piano playing. He returned to Frankfort greatly encouraged, and he was still further elated to receive soon after a letter from Liszt in which, referring to the first \"Modern Suite,\" which MacDowell had sent to him, the Abbé wrote:      \"... Since the foundation of the General Society of German     Musicians, the definitive making up of the programs is entrusted     to me, and I shall be very glad to recommend the execution of     your work.      \"Will you be good enough to give to your master, my old friend,     J. Raff, the assurance of my highest esteem and admiration.      \"F. LISZT.      \"Budapest. April 13, 1882.\"  [Illustration: FACSIMILE OF A LETTER FROM LISZT TO MACDOWELL (SEE PAGE 18)]  The nineteenth annual convention of the _Allgemeiner Deutscher Musik-Verein_ was held that year at Zürich, from the 9th to the 12th of July; and at the fifth concert of the series, on July 11, MacDowell played his first piano suite. Both the music and his performance of it were praised. A contemporaneous account speaks of the composer as \"an earnest and modest musician, free from all mannerisms,\" who \"carried his modesty so far that he played with his notes before him, though he cannot have felt any particular necessity for having them there.\" He \"was recalled enthusiastically, and with many bravos, and may be proud of the success he has achieved.\" Until then, as MacDowell confessed, with engaging candour, to Mr. Henry T. Finck, he \"had never waked up to the idea\" that his music could be worth actual study or memorising. \"I would not have changed a note in one of them for untold gold, and _inside_ I had the greatest love for them; but the idea that any one else might take them seriously had never occurred to me.\" A year later, upon Liszt's recommendation, the suite and its successor, the \"Second Modern Suite,\" op. 14, were published at Leipzig by the famous house of Breitkopf and Härtel. \"Your two pianoforte suites,\" wrote Liszt from Budapest, in February of that year, \"are admirable. I accept the dedication of your concerto with sincere pleasure and thanks.\" The suites were the first of MacDowell's works to appear in print.[1]  [1] The \"Two Old Songs,\" which bear an earlier opus number,--9,--were composed at a much later period--a fact which is betrayed by their style.  The death of Raff on June 25, 1882, brought to MacDowell his first profound sorrow. There was a deep attachment between pupil and master, and MacDowell felt in Raff's death the loss of a sincere friend, and, as he later came to appreciate, a powerful ally. The influential part which Raff bore in turning MacDowell's aims definitely and permanently toward creative rather than pianistic activity could scarcely be overestimated. When he first went to Paris, and during the later years in Germany, there had been little serious thought on his part, or on the part of his family, concerning his composition; his evident talent for piano-playing had persistently overshadowed his creative gifts, and had made it seem that his inevitable career was that of a virtuoso. As he wrote in after years: \"I had acquired from early boyhood the idea that it was expected of me to become a pianist, and every moment spent in 'scribbling' seemed to be stolen from the more legitimate work of piano practice.\" It was Raff--Raff, who said to him once: \"Your music will be played when mine is forgotten\"--who opened his eyes.  The two following years,--from the summer of 1882 till the summer of 1884--were increasingly given over to composition, though MacDowell continued his private teaching and made a few appearances in concert. He continued to try his hand at orchestral writing, and in this pursuit he was greatly favoured by the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14110"],["title","Kernel Cob And Little Miss Sweetclover (#1)"],["body","rnoon, and, try as he would, Kernel Cob could not get it to stop.  \"I wonder what the fairies are sending us up here for?\" shouted Kernel Cob.  \"Maybe they're in Heaven,\" said Sweetclover, and just then the parasol went skimming through a beautiful white cloud, and the sun was dancing on it, making it look like pink eiderdown.  And soon they came out of the cloud and were in the blue sky again.  And up and up they sailed. And the sun dipped down in the sea, and its light went out, and the stars came out and began to peep through the sky like little fire-flies, and the moon came up, too, to see what was going on, and it grew bigger and bigger till it was nearly as big as the old Earth.  And then they came to the Moon and could see little people running around the edge waving their hands excitedly, and they were all dressed in silver clothing, and when Kernel Cob and Sweetclover were landed the Moonpeople ran to them and wondered.  And everything about them was silver. Churches and houses and rocks and rivers and trees and everything.  And the Moonpeople ran ahead in great confusion to show them the way.  And Kernel Cob formed them into line and put himself at the head of the column, as a general does, and they marched in step and everything until they came to the Palace of the King, which was of silver with turrets and spires of diamonds, and glittered so you could scarcely see.  And the King and the Queen were sitting on thrones, and when the King saw how Kernel Cob had formed his people in order, he was greatly pleased and said to himself, \"Here is a fine General. I will put him at the head of all my armies.\"  And Kernel Cobb and Sweetclover were invited to a great banquet, as splendid as ever you could imagine.  And when they were seated, Sweetclover saw some flowers on the banquet table which were very beautiful, white with silver calyx, and they were called Silverfloss, and Sweetclover whispered to Silverfloss:  \"Do you understand Earth talk?\"  \"Ting-a-ling,\" answered Silverfloss, and it sounded like the tinkling of a little silver bell.  \"What did she say?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"It must be Moonflower talk,\" said Sweetclover, and she looked about and saw some Edelweiss and she was very glad and said: \"Edelweiss, Edelweiss, how came you here?\"  Now you must know the Edelweiss is a little white flower that grows away up in the snow of the mountains of Switzerland.  \"One night I was blown up here in a great snow storm and I've been here ever since,\" said Edelweiss.  \"Can you speak Moonflower talk?\" asked Sweetclover.  \"Yes,\" said Edelweiss.  \"Very well,\" said Kernel Cob, \"we are trying to find Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather and we came all the way from the Earth on a parasol to do so. Maybe you can help us.\"  \"I would if I could,\" replied Edelweiss. \"But I am afraid they are not here. I've been here over four seasons and I've never seen a human being, and even if they were here they couldn't live here because it's too cold.\"  \"You bet it is,\" said Kernel Cob, and he shivered till the medals on his coat rattled.  \"Maybe they could be here in some other part of the Moon!\" said Sweetclover. \"Would you mind looking?\"  \"I would be glad to look,\" said Edelweiss, for he was a very polite little flower and had very pretty manners.  And turning to Silverfloss he asked her if she had seen two earth-people on the Moon.  \"Ting-a-ling,\" answered Silverfloss and you would have thought it was two bells tinkling.  \"She says there never was a human being on the Moon,\" said Edelweiss.  \"Well if they are not here,\" said Kernel Cob, \"we had better go before we freeze to death,\" and his teeth chattered.  \"How'll we get off?\" asked Sweetclover.  \"I'll tell Silverfloss to weave you a strand of silver,\" and he turned to Silverfloss and said some tinkling words to her.  \"She's doing it,\" he said. \"It's a thread of silver so thin that it can't be seen and yet it is so strong that it can easily bear your weight.\"  \"But I can't climb all the way down,\" said Kernel Cob.  \"You won't have to,\" said Edelweiss. \"All you have to do is to catch hold of the end of the silver thread and hang on to it, and, as Silverfloss weaves the thread it gets longer and longer, until you have reached the Earth. You'd better start now, if you are going.\"  So Kernel Cob wound the silver thread around his waist, and, lifting Sweetclover, was ready to start. \"Good-bye,\" said Kernel Cob. \"Good-bye,\" said Sweetclover.  \"Good-bye,\" said Edelweiss, \"Hold on tight!\"  \"All right,\" said Kernel Cob.  \"Thank you very much,\" cried Sweetclover.  And down they went, Kernel Cob hanging to the silver thread and Sweetclover snuggled close against his jacket.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  CHAPTER IV   Kernel Cob and Sweetclover went down and down and down through the sky from the Moon.  And after they had gone down and down and down a long time Sweetclover suddenly cried:  \"What's that?\" and pointed below. \"It's like a great ball turning round and round.\"  \"It looks like another Moon with the lights out.\"  \"It's the Earth!\" cried Sweetclover with delight, for she could now see the tops of trees as the sun began to show his golden head above the hills in the East. And little by little, as Kernel Cob and Sweetclover neared the Earth, they could see rivers and lakes and steeples and houses and after awhile, people and horses in the fields.  And down, down, down they came, getting nearer and nearer and nearer until they saw, beneath their very feet, a great tall house with sails on it going round and round at a rapid rate, and, before you could say, \"Look out!\" Kernel Cob was caught in one of the sails and dashed to the ground.  \"Are you hurt?\" asked Sweetclover sitting on the ground where she had been thrown.  \"No,\" said Kernel Cob, for a soldier must bear pain without complaint and pretend he isn't hurt even if he is.  And a number of people who were working in the fields ran out to see what had happened, and you may be sure that they were surprised to see these strange dolls. And they spoke a strange language which neither Kernel Cob nor Sweetclover could make out.  \"I wonder where we are,\" said Sweetclover, \"and who these people can be?\"  \"They're very funny,\" laughed Kernel Cob, \"I never saw shoes like those before. They look like boats.\"  \"They're made of wood,\" said Sweetclover.  And just then a little Dutch girl--for you have guessed that they were in Holland--came over and picked them up and carried them off into her house.  And little Antje, for that was her name, played with them all day, and, when night was come, she put them to sleep in a chair before the fireplace where it was nice and warm and cosy.  And, in the middle of the night, a cricket came out on the hearth stone and began to chirp.  \"Chirp, chirp, chirp,\" sang the cricket, and Kernel Cob woke up and rubbed his eyes and listened.  \"Hello, Mister Cricket,\" shouted Kernel Cob peering over the side of the chair.  And the Cricket hopped over to where Kernel Cob was lying.  \"Who are you?\" he chirped.  \"I'm Kernel Cob. And Sweetclover and I are looking for Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather,\" said Kernel Cob, \"Have you seen them?\"  \"Never heard of them,\" chirped the Cricket. \"What's their names?\"  \"Just Jackie and Peggs' motheranfather; that's all.\"  And just then Sweetclover woke up and sat on the side of the chair.  \"I'm sure that there isn't anybody by that name,\" chirped the Cricket, \"but I'll soon find out.\"  \"How?\" asked Kernel Cob.  \"I'll send a chirp to all the crickets in this house and garden, and they'll send a chirp to all the crickets in the next house and garden, and so on, and so on, and so on, all through this country, and in a little while I'll be able to tell you if they're here or not.\"  \"How'll you ever get the message back?\" asked Sweetclover.  \"I'm the King of all the Crickets,\" chirped he, \"and when I give an order you may be assured that it will be obeyed,\" and he stretched himself with so much pride that you could have heard his jacket crackle.  \"I'm sure you are very kind,\" said Sweetclover, \"and Kernel Cob and I are very much obliged to you,\" and she said this so very sweetly and so prettily that the Cricket lost no time in sending the message.  \"Crick-a-crick-a-crick,\" he chirped, and it sounded just like a telegraph instrument. \"Crick-a-crick-a-crick. There,\" he chirped, \"I've told them to make a search and we'll soon have an answer.\"  And while they waited, the cricket told them of the strange country they were in and all about the canals and the windmills and the skating in the winter and the curious wooden shoes that the people wore. And when he had done, Kernel Cob and Sweetclover told him about Jackie and Peggs, their wonderful visit to the Moon, and how they came down in the field and were picked up by little Antje.  \"Hush!\" said Kernel Cob, \"I hear the chirping of a Cricket,\" for his ears were quicker to hear than either Sweetclover's or the Cricket's. And sure enough you could now hear the chirping....  \"Crick-a-crick-a-crick,\" and the Cricket pricked up his ears and held up a foot to warn them to keep silence.  \"I'm sorry to tell you,\" he said as the chirping stopped, \"that they are not here.\"  \"Too bad,\" said Sweetclover, and the dew began to come into her eyes.  \"Come,\" chirped the Cricket. \"We must be quick, for if little Antje wakes up, you'll not get away so easily again,\" and they followed him as he hopped toward the window, upon which he leaped and was soon outside.  Kernel Cob climbed upon a chair, lifted Sweetclover in his arms and was soon outside, following quickly on the heels of the nimble Cricket who led them down to the waterside, where they found an old wooden shoe.  Into this Kernel Cob lifted Sweetclover and, after he had put up a stick to serve as a mast and had fastened a piece of cloth to it for a sail, he shook hands with the Cricket and climbed in. The cricket gave the shoe a push off with one of his feet and they were afloat on the sea.  \"Good-bye"]]]
