[33--all Northern men.]       [Fifteen Southern Representatives did not vote.]  DANIEL WEBSTER was not a member of the Senate when the vote on the Fugitive Slave Bill was taken. He had been made Secretary of State, a short time previous. All, however, will remember the powerful aid which he gave to the new compromise measures, and among them to the Fugitive Slave Bill, in his notorious Seventh of March Speech, [1850.] A few extracts from that Speech will show how heavily the responsibility of the existence of this law rests upon DANIEL WEBSTER:--       \"I suppose there is to be found no injunction against      that relation [Slavery] between man and man, in the      teachings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or of any of his      Apostles.\"--_Webster's 7th March Speech_, (_Authorized      Edition_,) p. 9.       \"One complaint of the South has, in my opinion, just      foundation; and that is, that there has been found at      the North, among individuals and among legislators, a      disinclination to perform, fully, their Constitutional duties      in regard to the return of persons bound to service, who have      escaped into the free States. In that respect, it is my      judgment that the South is right, and the North is wrong.\"      * * * * \"My friend at the head of the Judiciary Committee      [Mr. MASON of Virginia] has a bill on the subject now before      the Senate, with some amendments to it, WHICH I PROPOSE      TO SUPPORT, WITH ALL ITS PROVISIONS, _to the fullest      extent_.\"--_Idem._ p. 29.       He proceeded to assure the Senate that the North would, on      due consideration, fulfil \"their constitutional obligations\"      \"_with alacrity_.\" \"Therefore, I repeat, sir, that here is a      ground of complaint against the North well founded, which      ought to be removed, which it is now in the power of the      different departments of this Government to remove; which      calls for the enactment of proper laws authorizing the      judicature of this Government, in the several States, to do      all that is necessary for the recapture of fugitive slaves,      and for the restoration of them to those who claim them      Wherever I go, and whenever I speak on the subject, and when      I speak here, I desire to speak to the whole North, I say      that the South has been injured in this respect, and has a      right to complain; and the North has been too careless of      what, I think, the Constitution peremptorily and emphatically      enjoins upon her as a duty.\"--_Idem._ p. 30.  In a speech in the United States Senate, July 17, 1850, made with an evident view to calm that Northern feeling which had been aroused and excited by his 7th of March speech, beyond the power of priest or politician wholly to subdue, Mr. WEBSTER said there were various misapprehensions respecting the working of the proposed Fugitive Slave Bill:--       \"The first of these misapprehensions,\" he said, \"is an      exaggerated sense of the actual evil of the reclamation of      fugitive slaves, felt by Massachusetts and the other New      England States. What produced that? The cases do not exist.      There has not been a case within the knowledge of this      generation, in which a man has been taken back from      Massachusetts into slavery by process of law, not one.\"      * * * * \"Not only has there been no case, so far as I can      learn, of the reclamation of a slave by his master, which      ended in taking him back to slavery, in this generation, but      I will add, that, as far as I have been able to go back in my      researches, as far as I have been able to hear and learn, in      all that region there has been no one case of false claim.      * * * _There is no danger of any such violation being      perpetrated.\"[A]--Webster's Speech on the Compromise Bill, in      the United States Senate, 17th of July, 1850, edition of      Gideon & Co., Washington_, pp. 23-25.       [Footnote A: See also Mr. Webster's letter to the Citizens of      Newburyport, dated May 15th, 1850, wherein he urges the same      point, with great pains of argument.]  With such words did Mr. Webster endeavor to allay Northern alarm, and to create the impression (which was created and which prevailed extensively with his friends) that the Fugitive Law was only a concession to Southern feeling, and that few or no attempts to enforce it were likely to be made.  But when a few months had proved him a false prophet, and the Southern chase after fugitive men, women, and children had become hot and fierce, and in one or two instances the hunter had been foiled in his attempts and had lost his prey, Mr. Webster changed his tone, as follows:--       In May, 1851, at Syracuse, N.Y., he said: \"Depend upon it,      the Law [the Fugitive Slave Law] will be executed in its      spirit and to its letter. It will be executed in all the      great cities--here in Syracuse, in the midst of the next      Anti-Slavery Convention, if the occasion shall arise.\"  Certainly, so far as in Mr. Webster lay, so far as was in the power of Mr. Fillmore, and the officers of the United States Government generally, and of the still larger crowd of _expectants_ of office, nothing was left undone to introduce the tactics, discipline, and customs of the Southern plantation into our Northern cities and towns, in order to enforce the Fugitive Law.         *       *       *       *       *  The remainder of this Tract will be devoted to a record, as complete as circumstances enable us to make, of the VICTIMS OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW. It is a terrible record, which the people of this country should never allow to sleep in oblivion, until the disgraceful and bloody system of Slavery is swept from our land, and with it, all Compromise Bills, all Constitutional Guarantees to Slavery, all Fugitive Slave Laws. The established and accredited newspapers of the day, without reference to party distinctions, are the authorities relied upon in making up this record, and the _dates_ being given with each case, the reader is enabled to verify the same, and the few particulars which the compass of the Tract allows to be given with each. With all the effort which has been made to secure a good degree of completeness and exactness, the present record must of necessity be an imperfect one, and fall short of exhibiting all the enormities of the Act in question.       JAMES HAMLET, _of New York, September, 1850_, was the first      victim. He was surrendered by United States Commissioner      Gardiner to the agent of one Mary Brown, of Baltimore, who      claimed him as her slave. He was taken to Baltimore. An      effort was immediately made to purchase his freedom, and in      the existing state of the public feeling, the sum demanded by      his mistress, $800, was quickly raised. Hamlet was brought      back to New York with great rejoicings.       _Near Bedford, Penn., October 1._ Ten fugitives, from      Virginia, were attacked in Pennsylvania--one mortally      wounded, another dangerously. Next morning, both were      captured. Five others entered a mountain hut, and begged      relief. The woman supplied their wants. Her husband went out,      procured assistance, captured the slaves, and received a      reward of $255.       _Harrisburg, Penn., October._ Some slaves, number not      stated, were brought before Commissioner M'Allister, when      \"the property was proven, and they were delivered to their      masters, who took them back to Virginia, by railroad, without      molestation.\"       _Detroit, 8th October._ A negro was arrested under the new      law, and sent to jail for a week, to await evidence. Great      numbers of colored people armed themselves to rescue him.      Result not known.       HENRY GARNETT, _Philadelphia_, arrested as the slave of      Thomas P. Jones, of Cecil County, Maryland, and taken before      Judge Grier, of the United States Supreme Court, October 18,      1850, who declared his determination to execute the law as he      found it. The Judge said that the claimant had not taken the      course prescribed by the fugitive act, and proceeded to      explain, in a detailed manner, what the course should be in      such cases. As the claimant thus failed to make out his case,      the prisoner was ordered to be discharged.       _Boston, about 25th October._ Attempt to seize WILLIAM and      ELLEN CRAFT. William Craft armed himself, and kept within      his shop. Ellen was concealed in the house of a friend.      Their claimants, named Hughes & Knight, were indicted for      defamation of character, in calling W.C. a slave, and brought      before a magistrate. The feeling excited against them was so      great, that they at length fled from the city. Shortly after,      it being considered hazardous for Mr. and Mrs. Craft to      remain in the country, they were enabled to escape to      England.       [In a letter, dated Macon, Georgia, Nov. 11, John Knight      gives a particular account of the proceedings and experiences      of himself and his friend Hughes, on their then recent visit      to Boston for the purpose, to quote his own language, \"of      re-capturing William and Ellen Craft, the negroes belonging      to Dr. Collins and Ira Taylor.\" Willis H. Hughes also      published his statement.]       _New Albany, Indiana._ A woman and boy given up, and taken to      Louisville. They were so white that, even in Kentucky, a   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13990"],["title","The Fugitive Slave Law and Its Victims (#2)"],["body","   strong feeling arose in their favor on that ground. They were      finally bought for $600, and set free.       ADAM GIBSON, _Philadelphia, December 21, 1850_. Surrendered      by Edward D. Ingraham, United States Commissioner. The case      was hurried through in indecent haste, testimony being      admitted against him of the most groundless character. One      witness swore that Gibson's name was Emery Rice. He was taken      to Elkton, Maryland. There, Mr. William S. Knight, his      supposed owner, refused to receive Gibson, saying he was not      the man, and he was taken back to Philadelphia.  What compensation has the United States Government ever made to Adam Gibson, for the injurious act of its agent, Ingraham? Had not the Slaveholder been more honorable than the Commissioner or the makers of the Fugitive Law, Gibson would have been in Slavery for life.       HENRY LONG, _New York, December, 1850_. Brought before      Commissioner Charles M. Hall, claimed as the fugitive slave      of John T. Smith of Russell County, Virginia. After five or      six days' proceedings, there being some doubt of the      Commissioner's legal right to act, the alleged fugitive,      Long, was taken before Judge Judson, District Judge of the      United States. The Castle Garden Union Safety Committee      retained Mr. George Wood in this case, as counsel for the      slave claimant. Long was surrendered by Judge Judson, and      taken to Richmond, Virginia. Judge J. was complimented by the      _Washington Union_ as \"a clear-headed, competent, and      independent officer, who has borne himself with equal      discretion, liberality, and firmness. Such judges as he,\"      continues the _Union_, \"are invaluable in these times of      turmoil and agitation.\" At Richmond, Long was advertised to      be sold at public auction. On Saturday, January 18th, he was      sold, amid the jeers and scoffs of the spectators, for $750,      to David Clapton, of Georgia. The auctioneers (Pullam &      Slade), in commencing, said there was one condition of the      sale. Bonds must be given by the purchaser that this man      shall be carried South, and that he shall be kept South, and      sold, if sold again, to go South; and they declared their      intention to see the terms fully complied with. Long was      subsequently advertised for sale at Atlanta, Georgia.       _Near Coatsville, Chester County, Penn._ On a writ issued by      Commissioner Ingraham, Deputy Marshal Halzell and other      officers, with the claimant of an alleged fugitive, at night,      knocked at the door of a colored family, and asked for a      light to enable them to mend their broken harness. The door      being opened for this purpose, the marshal's party rushed in,      and said they came to arrest a fugitive slave. Resistance was      made by the occupant of the house and others, and the      marshal's party finally driven off--the slave owner advising      that course, and saying, \"Well, if this is a specimen of the      pluck of Pennsylvania negroes, I don't want my slaves back.\"      The master of the house was severely wounded in the arm by a      pistol shot; still he maintained his ground, declaring the      marshal's party should not pass except by first taking his      life.       _Marion, Williamson County, Ill., about December 10, 1850._      Mr. O'Havre, of the city police, Memphis, Tennessee, arrested      and took back to Memphis a fugitive slave, belonging to Dr.      Young. He did so, as the Memphis paper states, only \"after      much difficulty and heavy expense, being strongly opposed by      the Free Soilers and Abolitionists, but was assisted by Mr.      W. Allen, member of Congress, and other gentlemen.\"       _Philadelphia, about January 10, 1851._ G.F. Alberti and      others seized, under the Fugitive Slave Law, a free colored      boy, named JOEL THOMPSON, alleging that he was a slave. The      boy was saved.       STEPHEN BENNETT, _Columbia, Penn._, arrested as the slave of      Edward B. Gallup, of Baltimore. Taken before Commissioner      Ingraham; thence, by _habeas corpus_, before Judge Kane. He      was saved only by his freedom being purchased by his friends.       _The Huntsville (Ala.) Advocate_, of January 1, 1851, said      that Messrs. Markwood & Chester had brought back \"_seven of      their Slaves_\" from Michigan.       _The Memphis (Tenn.) Eagle_, of a later date, says that      within a few weeks \"at least five fugitive slaves have been      brought back to this city, from free States, with as little      trouble as would be had in recovering stray cows.\" The same      paper adds, \"We occasionally receive letters notifying us      that a slave, said to be the property of some one in this      vicinity, has been lodged in jail in Illinois or Indiana, for      his owner, who will please call, pay charges, and take him      away.\"       _In Boston, end of January, 1851._ A colored man, lately from      North Carolina, was sought by officers, under Marshal Devens,      aided by a lawyer, named Spencer, provided by the New York      Union Safety Committee. The arrest was not attempted. It was      found that the colored man was too strongly guarded and      protected.       Mrs. TAMOR, or EUPHEMIA WILLIAMS, _Philadelphia, February,      1851_, mother of six children, arrested and brought before      Commissioner Ingraham, as the slave Mahala, belonging to      William T.J. Purnell, of Worcester County, Maryland, admitted      to have been absent since 1829--twenty-two years. Children      all born in Pennsylvania; oldest about seventeen--a girl. Her      husband also in custody, and alleged to be the slave of      another man. Under writ of _habeas corpus_, Mrs. Williams was      taken before Judge Kane, of the United States Circuit Court.      After a full hearing, she was discharged, as not being the      woman alleged.       SHADRACH, _in Boston, February 15, 1851_. Arrested in Taft's      Cornhill Coffee House, by deputies of United States Marshal      Devens, on a warrant issued by George T. Curtis, United      States Commissioner, on the complaint of John Caphart,      attorney of John De Bree, of Norfolk, Va. Seth J. Thomas      appeared as counsel for Caphart. After a brief hearing before      G.T. Curtis, Commissioner, the case was adjourned to the      following Tuesday. Shortly after the adjournment, the      court-room was entered by a body of men, who bore away the      prisoner, Shadrach. After which he was heard of in Montreal,      Canada, having successfully, with the aid of many friends,      escaped the snares of all kidnappers, in and out of Boston.      The acting President, MILLARD FILLMORE, issued his      proclamation, countersigned by DANIEL WEBSTER, Secretary of      State, requiring prosecutions to be commenced against all who      participated in the rescue.       _Shawneetown, Illinois._ A woman was claimed by Mr. Haley,      of Georgia, as his slave; and was delivered up to him by two      Justices of the Peace, (early in 1851.)       _Madison, Indiana._ George W. Mason, of Davies County,      Kentucky, arrested a colored man, named MITCHUM, who, with      his wife and children, lived near Vernon. The case was tried      before a Justice of the Peace, named Basnett, who was      satisfied that Mitchum was Davis's slave, and had left his      service _nineteen years before_. The slave was accordingly      delivered up, and was taken to Kentucky, (Feb. 1851.)       _Clearfield County, Penn., about 20th January, 1851._ A      boy was kidnapped and taken into slavery.--_Mercer (Pa.)      Presbyterian_.       _Near Ripley, Ohio._ A fugitive slave, about January 20,      killed his pursuer. He was afterwards taken and carried back      to slavery.       _Burlington, Lawrence County, Ohio, near the end of February,      1851_, four liberated slaves were kidnapped, re-enslaved, and      sold. Efforts were made to bring the perpetrators of this      nefarious act to punishment, and restore the victims to      freedom.       _At Philadelphia, early in March, 1851_, occurred the case of      the colored woman HELEN or HANNAH, and her son, a child of      tender years. She was taken before a Commissioner, and      thence, by writ of _habeas corpus_, before Judge Kane. An      additional question arose from the fact that the woman would      soon become the mother of another child. Judge Kane decided      that she was the property of John Perdu, of Baltimore,      together with her son, and her unborn child, and they were      all surrendered accordingly, and taken into slavery.       _Pittsburg, March 13, 1851._ RICHARD GARDINER was arrested in      Bridgewater, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, claimed as the      property of Miss R. Byers, of Louisville, Kentucky. Judge      Irwin, of the United States District Court, \"remanded the      fugitive back to his owner.\" He was afterwards bought for      $600, and brought into a free State.       _The Wilmington (Del.) Journal_, in March, 1851, says      kidnapping has become quite frequent in that State; and      speaks of a negro kidnapped in that city, on the previous      Wednesday night, by a man who had been one of the city      watchmen.       THOMAS SIMS, arrested in _Boston_, April 4, 1851, at first on      pretence of a charge of theft. But when he understood it was      as a fugitive from slavery, he drew a knife and wounded one      of the officers. He was taken before Commissioner George T.      Curtis. To guard against a repetition of the Shadrach rescue,      the United States Marshal, Devens, aided by the Mayor (John      P. Bigelow) and City Marshal (Francis Tukey) of Boston,      surrounded the Court House, in Boston, with heavy chains,      guarded it by a strong extra force of police officers, with a      strong body of guards also within the building, where the      fugitive was imprisoned as well as tried.
