Towards the end of the year 1835 I was apprised that the governor of New South Wales was desirous of having the survey of the Darling completed with the least possible delay. His excellency proposed that I should return for this purpose to the extreme point on the Darling where my last journey terminated and that, after having traced the Darling into the Murray, I should embark on the latter river and, passing the carts and oxen to the left bank at the first convenient opportunity, proceed upwards by water as far as practicable and regain the colony somewhere about Yass Plains.  EQUIPMENT.  The preparations for this journey were made, as on the former occasion, chiefly in the lumber-yard at Parramatta, and under the superintendence of the same officer, Mr. Simpson. Much of the equipment used for the last expedition was available for this occasion. The boats and boat-carriage were as serviceable as ever, with the advantage of being better seasoned; and we could now, having had so much experience, prepare with less difficulty for such an undertaking.  In consequence of a long-continued drought serviceable horses and bullocks were at that time scarce, and could only be obtained at high prices; but no expense was spared by the government in providing the animals required.  The party having preceded me by some weeks on the road, I at length overtook it on the 15th of March in a valley near the Canobolas which I had fixed as the place of rendezvous, and where, from the great elevation, I hoped still to find some grass. How we were to proceed however without water was the question I was frequently asked; and I was informed at Bathurst that even the Lachlan was dried up.  On the following day I organised the party, and armed the men. I distributed to each a suit of new clothing; consisting of grey trousers and a red woollen shirt, the latter article, when crossed by white braces, giving the men somewhat of a military appearance.  Their names and designation were as follows:  LIST OF THE MEN.  LIST OF THE PARTY PROCEEDING TO THE DARLING IN MARCH 1836.*  (*Footnote. The men whose names are printed in uppercase had obtained their freedom as a reward for past services in the interior. The asterisks distinguish the names of men who had been with me on one or both the former expeditions. Those to whose names the letter T is also prefixed having previously obtained a ticket of leave releasing them from a state of servitude. Each man was also furnished with a small case containing six cartridges which he was ordered always to wear about his waist.)  COLUMN 1: NAMES. COLUMN 2: OCCUPATION IN THE EXPLORING PARTY.

Now isn't that     the rudest way A Goop could answer?     I should say!  [Illustration: Saying \"I won't\"]   JUMBO RAY  No children ever     like to play With such a Goop     as Jumbo Ray. For he will snatch     and grab the toys Of all the little     girls and boys. Though Jumbo loves     to fuss and fight, _You_ know, of course,     it isn't right.  [Illustration: Snatching Toys]   ANNIE F. R. RIFF  Annie Fanny     Ruffle Riff; Hear her snuffle!     Hear her sniff! Hear her sniffle!     Hear her snuff!-- See her--well,     I've said enough. _You_ have seen her,     I suppose, The Goop who seldom     blows her nose?  [Illustration: Snuffling and Sniffling]   FELICIA ROPPS  Funny, how     Felicia Ropps Always handles     things in shops! Always pinching,     always poking, Alwyas feeling,     always stroking Things she has     no right to touch! Goops like that     annoy me much!  [Illustration: Handling Things]   PERCIVAL B. SLOOP  Just look at     Percival B. Sloop, A most unpleasant     sort of Goop; He pokes his fingers     in his nose And wipes his hands     upon his clothes; He does a lot     of things that you, I know, would never,     never do!

[Illustration: Blaming Others]   SPERRY SPROOKS  Have you ever     chanced to look At a torn and     dirty book? At a book that's     ragged, soiled, Inked and finger-     marked and spoiled? Who has done it?     Sperry Sprooks! He's the Goop     that spoils the books!  [Illustration: Tearing Books]   URIAH STEAD  I never saw     Uriah Stead When he was glad     to go to bed. There always was     _one_ thing to do Before he could     take off a shoe! The little Goop     was always late; I hope _you_ don't     pro-cras-ti-nate!  [Illustration: Not Going to Bed]   ROSIE L.
