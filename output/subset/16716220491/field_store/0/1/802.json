But come in, papa, I want to consult you about one or two little matters; Edward and I rely very much upon your taste and judgment.\"  \"To Roselands first,\" was Mr. Travilla's order to the coachman.  The old home of the Dinsmores, though shorn of the glory of its grand old trees, was again a beautiful place: the new house was in every respect a finer one than its predecessor, of a higher style of architecture, more conveniently arranged, more tastefully and handsomely furnished; lawns, gardens and fields had become neat and trim as in the days before the war, and a double row of young, thrifty trees bordered the avenue.  Old Mr. Dinsmore now resided there and gave a home to his two widowed and impoverished daughters--Mrs. Louise Conly, and Mrs. Enna Johnson--and their families.  These two aunts loved Elsie no better than in earlier years: it was gall and wormwood to them to know that they owed all these comforts to her generosity; nor could they forgive her that she was more wealthy, beautiful, lovely and beloved than themselves. Enna was the more bitter and outspoken of the two, but even Louise seldom treated her niece to anything better than the most distant and frigid politeness.  In a truly Christian spirit Elsie returned them pity and compassion, because of their widowhood and straitened circumstances, invited them to her house, and when they came received them with kindness and cordiality.  Her grandfather had grown very fond of her and her children, was often at Ion, and for his sake she occasionally visited Roselands. Adelaide's presence had drawn her there more frequently of late. The invitation Mr. Travilla carried was to the grandfather, three aunts and all their children.  Adelaide and Enna were in the drawing-room when the Ion carriage drew up at the door.  \"There's Travilla, the old scalawag: how I hate him! Elsie too, I presume,\" exclaimed the latter, glancing from the window; \"I'll leave you to entertain them,\" and she hastily left the room.  Adelaide flashed an indignant look after her, and hurried out to meet and welcome the callers. Mr. Travilla had alighted and was coming up the steps of the veranda.  \"How d'ye do. I'm _very_ glad to see you,\" cried Adelaide, extending her hand, \"but where is Elsie?\"  \"Left at home for once,\" he answered gayly, \"but I come this morning merely as her ladyship's messenger.\"  \"But won't you come in; you and the children?\"  \"Thanks, no, if you will permit me just to deliver my message and go; for I am in haste.\"  Mrs. Allison accepted the invitation for herself and children with evident pleasure, engaged that her sisters would do the same; then went to the carriage window for a moment's chat with the little ones, each of whom held a large place in her warm heart. \"Aunt Addie,\" said Elsie in an undertone, \"mamma's going to wear her wedding dress to-night, veil and all.\"  \"Is she? why that's an excellent idea. But don't tell it anywhere else that you go; it will be such a nice surprise to the rest if we can keep it a secret.\"  \"That was a good suggestion of Aunt Addie's,\" Mr. Travilla remarked as they drove down the avenue. \"Suppose we carry it out. How many of you can refrain from telling what mamma is to wear to-night? how many can I trust to keep a secret?\"  \"All of us, papa!\" \"Me, papa, me, I won't tell,\" cried the little voices in chorus.  \"Yes, I believe I can trust you all,\" he answered in his bright cheery way. \"Now on to the Oaks, Solon, then to Pinegrove, Springbrook, and Ashlands. That will be the last place, children, and as our hurry will then be over, you shall get out of the carriage and have a little time to rest before we start for home.\"  Re-entering the house Mrs. Allison went to the family sitting-room where she found both her sisters and several of the younger members of the household. \"So they have asked for us?\" exclaimed Louise in a tone of vexation, \"at such an unreasonable hour too. Well,\" with a sigh of resignation, \"I suppose we must show ourselves or papa will be displeased: so wonderfully fond of Elsie as he has grown of late.\"  \"As well he may,\" returned Adelaide pointedly; \"but Elsie is not here nor has any one inquired for you.\"  \"No, I presume not,\" interrupted Enna with a sneer, \"we are not worth inquiring for.\"  Indignation kept Adelaide silent for a moment, she was sorely tempted to administer a severe and cutting rebuke. But Enna was no longer a child, and controlling herself she calmly delivered Mr. Travilla's message.  \"Oh, delightful! Cousin Elsie always does give such splendid parties, such elegant refreshments!\" cried Virginia and Isadore Conly, girls of ten and twelve, \"mamma, you'll never think of declining?\"  \"No, your grandfather wouldn't like it,\" said Louise, as anxious as her daughters to enjoy the entertainment, yet glad to save her pride, by putting her acceptance on the score of pleasing her father.  \"And you'll go too, and take us, mamma, won't you?\" anxiously queried Molly Percival, who was between her cousins in age.  \"Of course I'll go; we all want our share of the good things, and the pleasure of seeing and being seen,\" answered Enna, scorning Louise's subterfuge; \"and if you and Dick will promise to make me no trouble, I'll take you along. But Bob and Betty may stay at home, I'm not going to be bothered with them,--babies of five and three. But what shall we wear, Lu? I do say it's real mean in them to give us so short a notice. But of course Elsie enjoys making me feel my changed circumstances. I've no such stock of jewels, silks and laces as she, nor the full purse that makes it an easy matter for her to order a fresh supply at a moment's warning.\"  \"You have all, and more than the occasion calls for,\" remarked Adelaide quietly; \"it is to be only a family gathering.\"     Chapter Second.  \"Though fools spurn Hymen's gentle powers, We, who improve his golden hours, By sweet experience know That marriage, rightly understood, Gives to the tender and the good A paradise below.\" --Cotton   Mr. Allison had fully kept his promise to Sophie, and Ashlands was again the fine old place it had been prior to the war. The family, consisting of the elder Mrs. Carrington, a young man, named George Boyd, a nephew of hers who had taken charge of the plantation, Sophie and her four children, had now been in possession for over a year.  Sophie, still an almost inconsolable mourner for the husband of her youth, lived a very retired life, devoting herself to his mother and his orphaned little ones.  Mrs. Ross, expecting to spend the fall and winter with them, had brought all her children and a governess, Miss Fisk, who undertook the tuition of the little Carringtons also during her stay at Ashlands, thus leaving the mothers more at liberty for the enjoyment of each other's society.  It was in the midst of school-hours that the Ion carriage came driving up the avenue, and Philip Ross, lifting his head from the slate over which he had been bending for the last half hour, rose hastily, threw down his pencil and hurried from the room, paying no attention to Miss Fisk's query, \"Where are you going, Philip?\" or her command, \"Come back instantly: it is quite contrary to rules for pupils to leave the school-room during the hours of recitation, without permission.\" Indeed he had reached the foot of the staircase before the last word had left her lips; she being very slow and precise in speech and action, while his movements were of the quickest.  \"What now is to be done in this emergency?\" soliloquized the governess, unconsciously thinking aloud. \"Miss Gertrude Ross,\" turning to a girl of nine whose merry blue eyes were twinkling with fun, \"follow your brother at once and inform him that I cannot permit any such act of insubordination; and he must return instantly to the performance of his duties.\"  \"Yes ma'am,\" and Gertrude vanished; glad enough of the opportunity to see for herself who were the new arrivals. \"Phil,\" she said, entering the drawing-room where the guests were already seated, \"Miss Fisk says you're an insubordination and must come back instantly.\"  \"Gertude,\" said her mother, laughing \"come and speak to Mr. Travilla and your little friends. Why yes, Phil, to be sure; how came you here when you ought to be at your lessons?\"  \"Because I wanted to see Elsie Travilla,\" he answered nonchalantly.  \"Yes, but you should have asked for permission. I ought to send you back.\"  \"But you won't, ma, you know that as well as I do. I'll not go back a step while Elsie stays.\"  \"Well, well, it seems you are bound to have your own way, as usual,\" Lucy answered, half laughing, half sighing, then resumed her talk with Mr. Travilla.  Seeing that the little Travillas had listened to this colloquy in blank amazement, she felt much mortified at Phil's behavior, and on receiving the invitation threatened to leave him at home as a punishment. But this only made matters worse: he insisted that go he would, and if she refused permission he should never, never love her again as long as he lived. And she weakly yielded.  \"Lucy,\" said her mother, when the guests were gone, and the children had left the room, \"you are ruining that boy.\"  \"Well, I don't see how I can help it, mamma how could I bear to lose his affection?\"  \"You are taking the very course to bring that about; it is the weakly indulged, not the wisely controlled, children who lose, first respect, and then affection for their parents. Look at Elsie's little family for instance; where can you find children ruled with a firmer hand, or more devotedly attached to their parents?\"  Eddie was at that moment saying to his father, \"Papa, isn't Phil Ross a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14566"],["title","Elsie's Motherhood (#2)"],["body",", _very_ naughty boy, to be so saucy and disobedient to his mamma?\"  \"My son,\" answered Mr. Travilla with gentle gravity, \"when you have corrected all Eddie Travilla's faults it will be time enough to attend to those of others.\" And the child hung his head and blushed for shame.  It was Mr. and Mrs. Horace Dinsmore who did the honors at Ion early in the evening, receiving and welcoming each bevy of guests, and replying to the oft repeated inquiry for the master and mistress of the establishment, that they would make their appearance shortly.  Elsie's children, most sweetly and becomingly dressed, had gathered about \"Aunt Rosie,\" in a corner of the drawing-room, and seemed to be waiting with a sort of intense but quiet eagerness for the coming of some expected event.  At length every invited guest had arrived. All being so thoroughly acquainted, nearly all related, there was an entire absence of stiffness and constraint, and much lively chat had been carried on; but a sudden hush fell upon them, and every eye turned toward the doors opening into the hall, expecting--they knew not what.  There were soft foot-falls, a slight rustle of silk, and Adelaide entered followed by Mr. Travilla with Elsie on his arm, in bridal attire. The shimmering satin, rich, soft lace and orange blossoms became her well; and never, even on that memorable night ten years ago, had she looked lovelier or more bride-like; never had her husband bent a prouder, fonder look upon her fair face than now as he led her to the centre of the room, where they paused in front of their pastor.  A low murmur of surprise and delight ran round the room, but was suddenly stilled, as the venerable man rose and began to speak.  \"Ten years ago to-night, dear friends, I united you in marriage. Edward Travilla, you then vowed to love, honor and cherish till life's end the woman whom you now hold by the hand. Have you repented of that vow? and would you be released?\"  \"Not for worlds: there has been no repentance, but my love has grown deeper and stronger day by day.\"  \"And you, Elsie Dinsmore Travilla, also vowed to love, honor and obey the man you hold by the hand. Have you repented?\"  \"Never, sir; never for one moment.\" The accents were low, sweet, clear, and full of pleasure.  \"I pronounce you a faithful man and wife: and may God, in his good providence, grant you many returns of this happy anniversary.\"  Old Mr. Dinsmore stepped up, kissed the bride and shook hands with the groom. \"Blessings on you for making her so happy,\" he said in quivering tones.  His son followed, then the others in their turn, and a merry scene ensued.  \"Mamma, it was so pretty, _so_ pretty,\" little Elsie said, clasping her arms about her mother's neck, \"and now I just feel as if I'd been to your wedding. Thank you, dear mamma and papa.\"  \"Mamma, you are so beautiful, I'll just marry you myself, when I'm a man,\" remarked Eddie, giving her a hearty kiss, then gazing into her face with his great dark eyes full of love and admiration.  \"I too,\" chimed in Violet. \"No, no, I forget, I shall be a lady myself: so I'll have to marry papa.\"  \"No, Vi, oo tan't have my papa; he's dus' my papa always,\" objected Harold, climbing his father's knee.  \"What a splendid idea, Elsie,\" Lucy Ross was saying to her friend, \"you have made me regret, for the first time, not having kept my wedding dress; for I believe my Phil and I could go through that catechism quite as well as you and Mr. Travilla. The whole thing, I suppose, was quite original?\"  \"Among us: my namesake daughter proposed the wearing of the dress: and the ceremony,\" turning to the minister, \"was your idea, Mr. Wood, was it not?\"  \"Partly, Mrs. Travilla; your father, Mrs. Dinsmore, and I planned it together.\"  \"Your dress is as perfect a fit as when made, but I presume you had it altered,\" observed Lucy, making a critical examination of her friend's toilet.  \"No, not in the least,\" answered Elsie, smiling.  The banquet to which the guests were presently summoned, though gotten up so hastily, more than fulfilled the expectation of the Misses Conly, who as well as their mother and Aunt Enna did it ample justice; there was a good deal of gormandizing done by the spoiled children present, spite of feeble protests from their parents; but Elsie's well trained little ones ate contentedly what was given them, nor even asked for the rich dainties on which others were feasting; knowing that papa and mamma loved them too dearly to deny them any real good.  \"Holloa, Neddie and Vi, why you've been overlooked!\" said Philip Ross, coming toward the two little ones with a plate heaped up with rich viands, \"you've nothing but ice cream and plain sugar biscuit; here, take some of this pound cake and these bonbons. They're delicious, I tell you!\"  \"No, no, thank you: mamma says pound cake is much too rich for us, and would make us sick,\" said Eddie.  \"'Specially at night,\" added Vi, \"and we're to have some bonbons to-morrow.\"  \"Goodest little tots ever I saw,\" returned Philip laughing. \"Ma wanted me to let 'em alone, but I told her I'd risk the getting sick,\" he added with a pompous grown-up air.  \"Phil, you certainly are an insubordination, as Miss Fisk said,\" remarked his sister Gertrude, standing near, \"I believe you think you're 'most a man, but it's a great mistake.\"  \"Pooh, Ger! people that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. I heard you telling ma you wouldn't wear the dress she'd laid out for you. Elsie Travilla, allow me the pleasure of refilling your saucer.\"  \"No, thank you, Phil, I've had all mamma thinks good for me.\"  \"Time to go to bed, chillens,\" said mammy, approaching the little group, \"de clock jes gwine strike nine. Here, Uncle Joe, take dese empty saucers.\"  Promptly and without a murmur the four little folks prepared to obey the summons, but cast wistful longing glances toward mamma, who was gayly chatting with her guests on the other side of the room. Just then the clock on the mantel struck, and excusing herself she came quickly toward them. \"That is right, dears; come and say good-night to papa and our friends; then go with mammy and mamma will follow in a few moments.\"  \"What dear sweet creatures they are! perfect little ladies and gentlemen,\" remarked Mrs. Wood, as, after a courteous good-night to all, they went cheerfully away with their mammy.  \"I wish mine were half as good,\" said Mrs. Ross.  \"Now ma, don't expose us,\" cried Phil. \"I've often heard you say Mrs. Travilla was a far better little girl than you; so of course her children ought to be better than yours.\"  \"Some children keep their good behavior for company,\" sneered Enna, \"and I've no doubt these little paragons have their naughty fits as well as ours.\"  \"It is quite true that they are not always good,\" Elsie said with patient sweetness. \"And now I beg you will all excuse me for a few moments, as they never feel quite comfortable going to bed without a last word or two with mamma.\"  \"Before I'd make myself such a slave to my children!\" muttered Enna, looking after her as she glided from the room. \"If they couldn't be content to be put to bed by their mammies, they might stay up all night.\"  \"I think Mrs. Travilla is right,\" observed the pastor; \"the responsibilities of parents are very great. God says to each one, 'Take this child and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.'\"     Chapter Third.  \"Delightful task! to rear the tender thought, To teach the young idea how to shoot, To pour the fresh instruction o'er the mind, To breathe the enlivening spirit and to fix The generous purpose in the glowing breast!\" --THOMSON'S SEASONS.   The Ion little folks were allowed an extra nap the next morning, their parents wisely considering plenty of sleep necessary to the healthful development of their mental and physical powers. They themselves, however, felt no necessity for a like indulgence, their guests having departed in season to admit of their retiring at the usual hour, and were early in the saddle, keenly enjoying a brisk canter of several miles before breakfast.  On their return Elsie went to the nursery, Mr. Travilla to the field where his men were at work. Half an hour later they and their children met at the breakfast table.  Solon came in for orders.  \"You may leave Beppo saddled, Solon,\" said Mr. Travilla, \"and have Prince and Princess at the door also, immediately after prayers.\"  The last named were a pair of pretty little grey ponies belonging respectively to Eddie and his sister Elsie. They were gentle and well trained for both saddle and harness.  Nearly every day the children rode them, one on each side of their father, mounted on Beppo, his beautiful bay; and occasionally they drove behind them in the phaeton with their mother or some older person; and one or the other of the children would often be allowed to hold the reins when on a straight and level road; for their father wished them to learn to both ride and drive with ease and skill.  Little Elsie's great ambition was \"to be like mamma\" in the ease and grace with which she sat her horse, as well as in every thing else; while Eddie was equally anxious to copy his father.  Violet and Harold ran out to the veranda to watch them mount and ride away.  \"Papa,\" said Vi, \"shall we, too, have ponies and ride with you, when we're as big as Elsie and Eddie?\"  \"I intend you shall, little daughter, and if you and Harold will be here with your hats on, all ready to start at once when we come back, I will give you each a short ride before the ponies are put away.\"  \"Oh, thank you, papa! we'll be sure to be ready,\" they answered, and ran in to their mother to tell her of papa's kind promise, and to have their hats put on.  Elsie, who was in the sitting-room with Herbert on her lap, rejoiced in their joy, and bade Dinah prepare them at once for their ride.  \"Bress dere little hearts! dey grows hansomer ebery day,\" exclaimed an elderly negress, who had just come in with a basket on her arm.  \"Don't"]]]
