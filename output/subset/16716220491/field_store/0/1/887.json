In his later dealings with this brother Simon, Joseph showed all the forgiving charitableness of his nature. When Simon was held in durance in Egypt as a hostage, Joseph, so far from bearing him a grudge, ordered crammed poultry to be set before him at all his meals.[42]  Not satisfied with exposing Joseph to the snakes and scorpions, his brethren had stripped him bare before they flung him into the pit. They took off his coat of many colors, his upper garment, his breeches, and his shirt.[43] However, the reptiles could do him no harm. God heard his cry of distress, and kept them in hiding in the clefts and the holes, and they could not come near him. From the depths of the pit Joseph appealed to his brethren, saying: \"O my brethren, what have I done unto you, and what is my transgression? Why are you not afraid before God on account of your treatment of me? Am I not flesh of your flesh, and bone of your bone? Jacob your father, is he not also my father? Why do you act thus toward me? And how will you be able to lift up your countenance before Jacob? O Judah, Reuben, Simon, Levi, my brethren, deliver me, I pray you, from the dark place into which you have cast me. Though I committed a trespass against you, yet are ye children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were compassionate with the orphan, gave food to the hungry, and clothed the naked. How, then, can ye withhold your pity from your own brother, your own flesh and bone? And though I sinned against you, yet you will hearken unto my petition for the sake of my father. O that my father knew what my brethren are doing unto me, and what they spake unto me!\"  To avoid hearing Joseph's weeping and cries of distress, his brethren passed on from the pit, and stood at a bow- shot's distance.[44] The only one among them that manifested pity was Zebulon. For two days and two nights no food passed his lips on account of his grief over the fate of Joseph, who had to spend three days and three nights in the pit before he was sold. During this period Zebulon was charged by his brethren to keep watch at the pit. He was chosen to stand guard because he took no part in the meals. Part of the time Judah also refrained from eating with the rest, and took turns at watching, because he feared Simon and Gad might jump down into the pit and put an end to Joseph's life.[45]  While Joseph was languishing thus, his brethren determined to kill him. They would finish their meal first, they said, and then they would fetch him forth and slay him. When they had done eating, they attempted to say grace, but Judah remonstrated with them: \"We are about to take the life of a human being, and yet would bless God? That is not a blessing, that is contemning the Lord.[46] What profit is it if we slay our brother? Rather will the punishment of God descend upon us. I have good counsel to give you. Yonder passeth by a travelling company of Ishmaelites on their way to Egypt. Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him. The Ishmaelites will take him with them upon their journeyings, and he will be lost among the peoples of the earth.[47] Let us follow the custom of former days, for Canaan, too, the son of Ham, was made a slave for his evil deeds, and so will we do with our brother Joseph.\"[48]     THE SALE   While the brethren of Joseph were deliberating upon his fate, seven Midianitish merchantmen passed near the pit in which he lay. They noticed that many birds were circling above it, whence they assumed that there must be water therein, and, being thirsty, they made a halt in order to refresh themselves. When they came close, they heard Joseph screaming and wailing, and they looked down into the pit and saw a youth of beautiful figure and comely appearance. They called to him, saying: \"Who art thou? Who brought thee hither, and who cast thee into this pit in the wilderness?\" They all joined together and dragged him up, and took him along with them when they continued on their journey. They had to pass his brethren, who called out to the Midianites: \"Why have you done such a thing, to steal our slave and carry him away with you? We threw the lad into the pit, because he was disobedient. Now, then, return our slave to us.\" The Midianites replied: \"What, this lad, you say, is your slave, your servant? More likely is it that you all are slaves unto him, for in beauty of form, in pleasant looks, and fair appearance, he excelleth you all. Why, then, will you speak lies unto us? We will not give ear unto your words, nor believe you, for we found the lad in the wilderness, in a pit, and we took him out, and we will carry him away with us on our journey.\" But the sons of Jacob insisted, \"Restore our slave to us, lest you meet death at the edge of the sword.\"  Unaffrighted, the Midianites drew their weapons, and, amid war whoops, they prepared to enter into a combat with the sons of Jacob. Then Simon rose up, and with bared sword he sprang upon the Midianites, at the same time uttering a cry that made the earth reverberate. The Midianites fell down in great consternation, and he said: \"I am Simon, the son of the Hebrew Jacob, who destroyed the city of Shechem alone and unaided, and together with my brethren I destroyed the cities of the Amorites. God do so and more also, if it be not true that all the Midianites, your brethren, united with all the Canaanite kings to fight with me, cannot hold out against me. Now restore the boy you took from us, else will I give your flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field.\"  The Midianites were greatly afraid of Simon, and, terrified and abashed, they spake to the sons of Jacob with little courage: \"Said ye not that ye cast this lad into the pit because he was of a rebellious spirit? What, now, will ye do with an insubordinate slave? Rather sell him to us, we are ready to pay any price you desire.\" This speech was part of the purpose of God. He had put it into the heart of the Midianites to insist upon possessing Joseph, that he might not remain with his brethren, and be slain by them.[49] The brethren assented, and Joseph was sold as a slave while they sat over their meal. God spake, saying: \"Over a meal did ye sell your brother, and thus shall Ahasuerus sell your descendants to Haman over a meal, and because ye have sold Joseph to be a slave, therefore shall ye say year after year, Slaves were we unto Pharaoh in Egypt.\"[50]  The price paid for Joseph by the Midianites was twenty pieces of silver, enough for a pair of shoes for each of his brethren. Thus \"they sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes.\" For so handsome a youth as Joseph the sum paid was too low by far, but his appearance had been greatly changed by the horrible anguish he bad endured in the pit with the snakes and the scorpions. He had lost his ruddy complexion, and he looked sallow and sickly, and the Midianites were justified in paying a small sum for him.[51]  The merchantmen had come upon Joseph naked in the pit, for his brethren had stripped him of all his clothes. That he might not appear before men in an unseemly condition, God sent Gabriel down to him, and the angel enlarged the amulet banging from Joseph's neck until it was a garment that covered him entirely. Joseph's brethren were looking after him as he departed with the Midianites, and when they saw him with clothes upon him, they cried after them, \"Give us his raiment! We sold him naked, without clothes.\" His owners refused to yield to their demand, but they agreed to reimburse the brethren with four pairs of shoes, and Joseph kept his garment, the same in which he was arrayed when he arrived in Egypt and was sold to Potiphar, the same in which he was locked up in prison and appeared before Pharaoh, and the same he wore when he was ruler over Egypt.[52]  As an atonement for the twenty pieces of silver taken by his brethren in exchange for Joseph, God commanded that every first-born son shall be redeemed by the priest with an equal amount, and, also, every Israelite must pay annually to the sanctuary as much as fell to each of the brethren as his share of the price.[53]  The brethren of Joseph bought shoes for the money, for they said: \"We will not eat it, because it is the price for the blood of our brother, but we will tread upon him, for that he spake, he would have dominion over us, and we will see what will become of his dreams.\" And for this reason the ordinance has been commanded, that he who refuseth to raise up a name in Israel unto his brother that hath died without having a son, shall have his shoe loosed from off his foot, and his face shall be spat upon. Joseph's brethren refused to do aught to preserve his life, and therefore the Lord loosed their shoes from off their feet, for, when they went down to Egypt, the slaves of Joseph took their shoes off their feet as they entered the gates, and they prostrated themselves before Joseph as before a Pharaoh, and, as they lay prostrate, they were spat upon, and put to shame before the Egyptians.[54]  The Midianites pursued their journey to Gilead, but they soon regretted the purchase they had made. They feared that Joseph had been stolen in the land of the Hebrews, though sold to them as a slave, and if his kinsmen should find him with them, death would be inflicted upon them for the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14946"],["title","The Blossoming Rod (#1)"],["body","for your Christmas present--lost the money for dear father's present; and all because she took it with her to buy a five-cent pencil--a green pencil with purple glass in the end of it; to buy something for _herself_ before Christmas!\" Clytie paused tragically. \"Of course, if she hadn't taken her money out to spend it on herself she wouldn't have lost it!\"  \"I don't care!\" burst out the culprit, her big dark eyes, just like her mother's, flashing from under her brown curls, and her red lips set defiantly. \"It was my own money, anyhow, if I did lose it. I earned it all myself. It wasn't yours!\"  \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" interposed the father in gentle reproof. \"Little girls mustn't talk like that to dear mother. Come, get up here on father's knee--so.\" He took off the red cap, tucked the brown curly head in the bend of his arm, his chin resting on the top of it as he went on, with the child's small hands clutching at his. \"Mary must always do what mother says; but, so far as this money is concerned, you can make me something that I would like far better than anything you could buy. Why don't you make me another pincushion, for instance? The one you gave me last year is quite worn out.\"  \"A pink one?\" asked Mary faintly.  \"Yes. What's the matter now?\" The child had suddenly wriggled to a kneeling posture in his hold and had her little strangling arms round his neck in a tempest of sobs.  \"I don't want to give you a pi-ink pincushion--I don't want to! I want my dollar! I want my dollar--to spend! I want--Father, I want my dollar--my do-o-ol-lar! I want my--\"  \"What did I tell you, Mary Langshaw?\" cried Clytie. She appealed to her husband. \"It's just the way I knew she'd act. Now I suppose you'll have to give it to her. Mary, be still a moment--her head is so hot!\"  \"There, there!\" said Langshaw soothingly. \"She shall have her money this minute.\"  \"Of course she doesn't deserve it,\" said Clytie, but with a tone of relief in her voice that seemed oddly greater than the occasion warranted. Mary had wound herself round him passionately; her sobs were dying away happily in long, deep breaths at intervals. Baby, being undressed on her mother's lap, was laughing over some pieces of gilt paper. In the heart of this domesticity it was as if the father and mother were embarked with this little company on a full and swelling river of love, of which they felt the exquisite soothing ripples.  Langshaw put his hand into his pocket.  \"No, I can't give you the dollar this minute, little girl; father has only a ten-dollar bill. I'll get it changed right after dinner. Isn't dinner 'most ready, Clytie?\"  \"We'll go down just as soon as I get Baby in bed,\" said the mother peacefully. \"I don't see why George isn't here. Goodness! There he is now,\" she added as a tremendous slam of the front door announced the fact. The next moment a small boy, roguishly blue-eyed and yellow-haired like Baby, with an extremely dirty face and a gray sweater half covered with mud, hurled himself into the room, surreptitiously tickling one of Baby's bare feet and pulling Mary's curls on his way to greet his father.  \"What have you been doing to get so dirty?\"  \"Playing cops and robbers,\" said the boy, serenely. His dimples appeared suddenly; his eyes lit up. \"Say, mother\"--he turned to her irresolutely--\"shall I tell father now?\"  \"Not until after dinner,\" returned the mother inexorably. \"Go and make yourself clean!\"  \"May I put on my white silk tie?\" George's white tie was the banner of festivity.  \"Yes.\"  \"You rouse my curiosity. This seems to be a great occasion,\" said Langshaw.  \"Oh, it is!\" agreed the mother happily. She murmured in his ear as they went downstairs: \"I hope you'll show that you're pleased, dear. You know sometimes when you really are pleased you don't show it at once--and George has been trying so hard. If you'll only show that you're pleased--\"  \"Yes--all right!\" returned the husband a little impatiently. Clytie had a sensitive consideration for her son's feelings which struck him at times as exaggerated. He thought of the delightful secret back in his own mind; there was no reason for talking any more about the rod until he bought it; he would manage to replace the dollar abstracted from the reserve fund.  If he gave absent answers during the meal Clytie seemed to be preoccupied also. Little Mary, who sat by him, tucked her hand into his as she prattled.  \"Now, George!\" said his mother at last suddenly when the rice pudding had been finished. George rose, clean and red-cheeked, looking more than ever like a large edition of Baby, in spite of his jacket and knickerbockers, as he stepped over to his father with a new dignity and handed him a folded sheet of paper.  \"What's this?\" asked Langshaw genially opening it. He read aloud the words within, written laboriously in a round, boyish hand:       To George Brander Langshaw, from father.        You Oh me five dolars.                           Reseived paiment.  \"Hello! Hello! What does this mean?\" asked Langshaw slowly, with an unpleasant startled sensation that any such sum in connection with George was out of all reason.  \"It means a bill for you from me!\" announced George. His cheeks grew redder, his blue eyes looked squarely at his father. \"It's for this!\" He pulled from his pocket a school report card divided into tiny ruled squares, filled with figures for half its length, and flung it down proudly on the table before his parent.  \"It's the Deportment--since September. You said when Miss Skinner sent that last note home about me that if I could get a hundred in Deportment for every month up to Christmas you'd be willing to pay me five dollars. You can see there for yourself, father, the three one hundreds--no, not that line--that's only fifty-five for spelling; nobody ever knows their spelling! Here is the place to look--in the Deportment column. I've tried awful hard to be good, father, to surprise you.\"  \"The way that child has tried!\" burst forth Clytie, her dark eyes drowned in sparkles. \"And they're so unfair at school--giving you a mark if you squeak your chair, or speak, or look at anybody; as if any child could be expected to sit like a stone all the time! I'm sure I love to hear children laughing--and you know yourself how hard it is for George to be quiet! We had a little talk about it together, he and I; and now you see! It's been such work keeping his card from you each month when you asked for it. One day he thought he had a bad mark and he couldn't eat any dinner--you thought he was ill; but he went to Miss Skinner the next day and she took it off because he had been trying so hard to be good. Joe, why don't you speak?\"  \"George, I'm proud of you!\" said Langshaw simply. There was a slight huskiness in his voice; the round face and guileless blue eyes of his little boy, who had tried \"awful hard to be good,\" seemed to have acquired a new dignity. The father saw in him the grown-up son who could be depended upon to look after his mother if need were. Langshaw held out his hand as man to man; the two pairs of eyes met squarely. \"Nothing you could have done would have pleased me more than this, George. I value it more than any Christmas present I could have.\"  \"Mother said you'd like it,\" said the beaming George, ducking his head suddenly and kicking out his legs from behind.  \"And you'll pay the five dollars?\" supplemented Clytie anxiously.  \"Surely!\" said Langshaw. The glances of the parents met in one of the highest pleasures that life affords: the approval together of the good action of their dear child. \"George can go out and get this ten-dollar bill changed.\"  \"If you can't spare it, father--\" suggested the boy with some new sense of manliness, hanging back.  \"I'm glad to be able to spare it,\" said the father soberly. \"It's a good deal of money,\" he added. \"I suppose, of course, you'll put it in the bank, George?\"  \"Now you mustn't ask what he's going to do with it,\" said Clytie.  \"Oh, isn't it much!\" cried little Mary.  \"Dear me, there's the doorbell,\" said Clytie. \"Who can it be at this hour? Run, George, and see!\"  \"It's a letter for you, mother,\" announced George, reappearing. \"There's a man in the hall, waiting for an answer.\"  \"It looks like a bill,\" said Clytie nervously, tearing open the envelope; \"but I don't owe any bill. Why, it's two and a quarter, from the tailor, for fixing over my old suit last fall! I'm positive I paid it weeks ago. There's some mistake.\"  \"He says he's been here three times, but you were out.\"  \"Have you any money for it, Clytie?\" asked her husband.  Clytie looked as if a thunderbolt had struck her.  \"Yes, I have; but--oh, I don't want to take it for that! I need every penny I've got.\"  \"Well, there's no need of feeling so badly about it,\" said Langshaw resignedly.  \"Give the ten-dollar bill to the man, George, and see if he can change it.\" He couldn't resist a slight masculine touch of severity at her incapacity. \"I wish you'd tend to these things at the time, Clytie, or let me know about them.\" He took the money when George returned. \"Here's your dollar now, Mary--don't lose it again!--and your five, George. You might as well take another dollar yourself, Clytie, for extras.\"  He pocketed the remainder of the change carelessly. After his first pang at the encroachment on the reserve fund the rod had sunk so far out of sight that it was almost as if it had never been. He had, of course, known all along that he would not buy it. Even the sting of the \"Amount due\" quickly evaporated.  Little Mary gave a jump that bumped her brown curly head against him.  \"You don't know what I'm going to give you for Christmas!\" she cried joyously.     II   Langshaw was one of those men who have an inherited capacity for enjoying Christmas. He lent it his attention with zest, choosing the turkey himself with critical care as he went through the big market in town, from whence he brought also wreaths and branches of holly that seemed to have larger and"]]]
