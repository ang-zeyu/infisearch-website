ALI  He that taketh this crystal, so, in his hand, at night, and wishes, saying \"At a certain hour let it be\"; the hour comes and he will go back eight, ten, even twelve years if he will, into the past, and do a thing again, or act otherwise than he did. The day passes; the ten years are accomplished once again; he is here once more; but he is what he might have become had he done that one thing otherwise.  MARY  John!  JOHN  I--I don't understand.  ALI  To-night you wish. All to-morrow you live the last ten years; a new way, master, a new way, how you please. To-morrow night you are here, what those years have made you.  JOHN  By Jove!  MARY  Have nothing to do with it, John.  JOHN  All right, Mary, I'm not going to. But, do you mean one could go back ten years?   ALI  Even so.   JOHN  Well, it seems odd, but I'll take your word for it. But look here, you can't live ten years in a day, you know.  ALI  My master has power over time.  MARY  John, don't have anything to do with him.  JOHN  All right, Mary. But who is your master?  ALI  He is carved of one piece of jade, a god in the greenest mountains. The years are his dreams. This crystal is his treasure. Guard it safely, for his power is in this more than in all the peaks of his native hills. See what I give you, master.  JOHN  Well, really, it's very good of you.  MARY  Good night, Mr. Ali. We are very much obliged for your kind offer, which we are so sorry we can't avail ourselves of.  JOHN  One moment, Mary. Do you mean that I can go back ten years, and live till--till now again, and only be away a day?  ALI  Start early and you will be here before midnight.  JOHN  Would eight o'clock do!  ALI  You could be back by eleven that evening.  JOHN  I don't quite see how ten years could go in a single day.  ALI  They will go as dreams go.  JOHN  Even so, it seems rather unusual, doesn't it?  ALI  Time is the slave of my master  MARY  John!  JOHN  All right, Mary. [In a lower voice.] I'm only trying to see what he'll say.  MARY  All right, John, only...  ALI  Is there no step that you would wish untrodden, nor stride that you would make where once you faltered?  JOHN  I say, why don't you use it yourself?  ALI  I? I am afraid of the past. But you Engleesh, and the great firm of Briggs, Cater, and Beal; you are afraid of nothing.  JOHN  Ha, ha. Well--I wouldn't go quite as far as that, but--well, give me the crystal.  MARY  Don't take it, John! Don't take it.  JOHN  Why, Mary? It won't hurt me.  MARY  If it can do all that--if it can do all that...  JOHN  Well?  MARY  Why, you might never have met me.  JOHN  Never have met you? I never thought of that.  MARY  Leave the past alone, John.  JOHN  All right, Mary. I needn't use it. But I want to hear about it, it's so odd, it's so what-you-might-call queer; I don't think I ever----- [To ALI.] You mean if I work hard for ten years, which will only be all to-morrow, I may be Governor of the Bank of England to-morrow night.  ALI  Even so.  MARY  O, don't do it, John.  JOHN  But you said--I'll be back here before midnight to-morrow.  ALI  It is so.  JOHN  But the Governor of the Bank of England would live in the City, and he'd have a much bigger house anyway. He wouldn't live in Lewisham.  ALI  The crystal will bring you to this house when the hour is accomplished, even tomorrow night. If you be the great banker you will perhaps come to chastise one of your slaves who will dwell in this house. If you be head of Briggs and Cater you will come to give an edict to one of your firm. Perchance this street will be yours and you will come to show your power unto it. But you will come.  JOHN  And if the house is not mine?  MARY  John! John! Don't.  ALI  Still you will come.  JOHN  Shall I remember?  ALI  No.  JOHN  If I want to do anything different to what I did, how shall I remember when I get back there?  MARY  Don't. Don't do anything different, John.  JOHN  All right.  ALI  Choose just before the hour of the step you desire to change. Memory lingers a little at first, and fades away slowly.  JOHN  Five minutes?  ALI  Even ten.  JOHN  Then I can change one thing. After that I forget.  ALI  Even so. One thing. And the rest follows.  JOHN  Well, it's very good of you to make me this nice present, I'm sure.  ALI  Sell it not. Give it, as I gave it, if the heart impels. So shall it come back one day to the hills that are brighter than grass, made richer by the gratitude of many men. And my master shall smile thereat and the vale shall be glad.  JOHN  It's very good of you, I'm sure.  MARY  I don't like it, John. I don't like tampering with what's gone.  ALI  My master's power is in your hands. Farewell.  [Exit.]  JOHN  I say, he's gone.  MARY  O, he's a dreadful man.  JOHN  I never really meant to take it.  MARY  O, John, I wish you hadn't  JOHN  Why? I'm not going to use it.  MARY  Not going to use it, John?  JOHN  No, no. Not if you don't want me to.  MARY  O, I'm so glad.  JOHN  And besides, I don't want things different. I've got fond of this little house. And Briggs is a good old sort, you know. Cater's a bit of an ass, but there's no harm in him. In fact, I'm contented, Mary. I wouldn't even change Aunt Martha now.  [Points at frowning framed photograph centrally hung.]  You remember when she first came and you said \"Where shall we hang her?\" I said the cellar. You said we couldn't. So she had to go there. But I wouldn't change her now. I suppose there are old watch-dogs like her in every family. I wouldn't change anything.  MARY  O, John, wouldn't you really?  JOHN  No, I'm contented. Grim old soul, I wouldn't even change Aunt Martha.  MARY  I'm glad of that, John. I was frightened. I couldn't bear to tamper with the past. You don't know what it is, it's what's gone. But if it really isn't gone at all, if it can be dug up like that, why you don't know what mightn't happen! I don't mind the future, but if the past can come back like that.... O, don't, don't, John. Don't think of it. It isn't canny. There's the children, John.  JOHN  Yes, yes, that's all right. It's only a little ornament. I won't use it. And I tell you I'm content. [Happily] It's no use to me.  MARY  I'm so glad you're content, John. Are you really? Is there nothing that you'd have had different? I sometimes thought you'd rather that Jane had been a boy.  JOHN  Not a bit of it. Well, I may have at the time, but Arthur's good enough for me.  MARY  I'm so glad. And there's nothing you ever regret at all?  JOHN  Nothing. And you? Is there nothing you regret, Mary?  MARY  Me? Oh, no. I still think that sofa would have been better green, but you would have it red.  JOHN  Yes, so I would. No, there's nothing I regret.  MARY  I don't suppose there's many men can say that.  JOHN  No, I don't suppose they can. They're not all married to you. I don't suppose many of them can.  [MARY smiles.]  MARY  I should think that very few could say that they regretted nothing... very few in the whole world.  JOHN  Well, I won't say nothing.  MARY  What is it you regret, John?  JOHN  Well, there is one thing.  MARY  And what is that?  JOHN  One thing has rankled a bit.  MARY  Yes, John?  JOHN  O, it's nothing, it's nothing worth mentioning. But it rankled for years.  MARY  What was it, John?  JOHN  O, it seems silly to mention it. It was nothing.  MARY  But what?  JOHN  O, well, if you want to know, it was once when I missed a train. I don't mind missing a train, but it was the way the porter pushed me out of the way. He pushed me by the face. I couldn't hit back, because, well, you know what lawyers make of it; I might have been ruined. So it just rankled. It was years ago before we married.  MARY  Pushed you by the face. Good gracious!  JOHN  Yes, I'd like to have caught that train in spite of him. I sometimes think of it still. Silly of me, isn't it?  MARY  What a brute of a man.  JOHN  O, I suppose he was doing his silly duty. But it rankled.  MARY  He'd no right to do any such thing! He'd no right to touch you!  JOHN  O, well, never mind.  MARY  I should like to have been there... I'd have...  JOHN  O, well, it can't be helped now; but I'd like to have caught it in sp... [An idea seizes him.]  MARY  What is it?  JOHN  Can't be helped, I said. It's the very thing that can be helped.  MARY  Can be helped, John? Whatever do you mean?  JOHN  I mean he'd no right to stop me catching that train. I've got the crystal, and I'll catch it yet!  MARY  O, John, that's what you said you wouldn't do.  JOHN  No. I said I'd do nothing to alter the past. And I won't. I'm too content, Mary. But this can't alter it. This is nothing.  MARY  What were you going to catch the train for, John?  JOHN  For London. I wasn't at the office then. It was a business appointment. There was a man who had promised to get me a job, and I was going up to...  MARY  John, it may alter your whole life!  JOHN  Now do listen, Mary, do listen. He never turned up. I got a letter from him apologising to me before I posted mine to him. It turned out he never meant to help me, mere meaningless affabilities. He never came to London that day at all. I should have taken the next train back. That can't affect the future.  MARY  N-no, John. Still, I don't like it.  JOHN  What difference could it make?  MARY  N-n-no.  JOHN  Think how we met. We met at ARCHIE's wedding. I take it one has to go to one's brother's wedding. It would take a pretty big change to alter that. And. you were her bridesmaid. We were bound to meet. And having once met, well, there you are. If we'd met by chance, in a train, or anything like that, well, then I admit some little change might alter it. But when we met at ARCHIE's wedding and you were her bridesmaid, why, Mary, it's a cert. Besides, I believe in predestination. It was our fate; we couldn't have missed it.  MARY  No, I suppose not; still..  JOHN  Well, what?  MARY  I don't like it.  JOHN  O, Mary, I have so longed to catch"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1311"],["title","If: A Play in Four Acts (#2)"],["body","infernal train. Just think of it, annoyed on and off for ten years by the eight-fifteen.  MARY  I'd rather you didn't, John.  JOHN  But why?  MARY  O, John, suppose there's a railway accident? You might be killed, and we should never meet.  JOHN  There wasn't.  MARY  There wasn't, John? What do you mean?  JOHN  There wasn't an accident to the eight-fifteen. It got safely to London just ten years ago.  MARY  Why, nor there was.  JOHN  You see how groundless your fears are. I shall catch that train, and all the rest will happen the same as before. Just think Mary, all those old days again. I wish I could take you with me. But you soon will be. But just think of the old days coming back again. Hampton Court again and Kew, and Richmond Park again with all the May. And that bun you bought, and the corked ginger-beer, and those birds singing and the 'bus past Isleworth. O, Mary, you wouldn't grudge me that?  MARY  Well, well then all right, John.  JOHN  And you will remember there wasn't an accident, won't you?  MARY [resignedly, sadly]  O, yes, John. And you won't try to get rich or do anything silly, will you?  JOHN  No, Mary. I only want to catch that train. I'm content with the rest. The same things must happen, and they must lead me the same way, to you, Mary. Good night, now, dear.  MARY  Good night?  JOHN  I shall stay here on the sofa holding the crystal and thinking. Then I'll have a biscuit and start at seven.  MARY  Thinking, John? What about?  JOHN  Getting it clear in my mind what I want to do. That one thing and the rest the same. There must be no mistakes.  MARY [sadly]  Good night, John.  JOHN  Have supper ready at eleven.  MARY  Very well, John. [Exit.]  JOHN [on the sofa, after a moment or two]  I'll catch that infernal train in spite of him.  [He takes the crystal and closes it up in the palm of his left hand.]  I wish to go back ten years, two weeks and a day, at, at--8.10 a.m. to-morrow; 8.10 a.m. to-morrow, 8.10.  [Re-enter MARY in doorway.]  MARY  John! John! You are sure he did get his fifty pounds?  JOHN  Yes. Didn't he come to thank me for the money?  MARY  You are sure it wasn't ten shillings?  JOHN  Cater paid him, I didn't.  MARY  Are you sure that Cater didn't give him ten shillings?  JOHN  It's the sort of silly thing Cater would have done!  MARY  O, John!  JOHN  Hmm.   Curtain    SCENE 3  Scene: As in Act I, Scene 1. Time. Ten years ago.  BERT  'Ow goes it, Bill?  BILL  Goes it? 'Ow d'yer think it goes?  BERT  I don't know, Bill. 'Ow is it?  BILL  Bloody.  BERT  Why, what's wrong?  BILL  Wrong? Nothing ain't wrong.  BERT  What's up, then?  BILL  Nothing ain't right.  BERT  Why, wot's the worry?  BILL  Wot's the worry? They don't give you better wages nor a dog, and then they thinks they can talk at yer and talk at yer, and say wot they likes, like.  BERT  Why? You been on the carpet, Bill?  BILL  Ain't I! Proper.  BERT  Why? Wot about, Bill?  BILL  Wot about? I'll tell yer. Just coz I let a lidy get into a train. That's wot about. Said I ought to 'av stopped 'er. Thought the train was moving. Thought it was dangerous. Thought I tried to murder 'er, I suppose.  BERT  Wot? The other day?  BILL  Yes.  BERT?  Tuesday?  BILL  Yes.  BERT  Why? The one that dropped her bag?  BILL  Yes. Drops 'er bag. Writes to the company. They writes back she shouldn't 'av got in. She writes back she should. Then they gets on to me. Any more of it and I'll...  BERT  I wouldn't, Bill; don't you.  BILL  I will.  BERT  Don't you, Bill. You've got your family to consider.  BILL  Well, anyway, I won't let any more of them passengers go jumping into trains any more, not when they're moving, I won't. When the train gets in, doors shut. That's the rule, and they'll have to abide by it.  [Enter JOHN BEAL.]  BILL [touching his hat] Good morning, sir.  [JOHN does not answer, but walks to the door between them.]  Carry your bag, sir?  JOHN  Go to hell!  [Exit through door.]  BILL  Ullo.  BERT  Somebody's been getting at 'im.  BILL  Well, I never did. Why, I knows the young feller.  BERT  Pleasant spoken, ain't 'e, as a rule?  BILL  Never knew 'im like this.  BERT  You ain't bin sayin' nothing to 'im, 'ave yer?  BILL  Never in my life.  BERT  Well, I never.  BILL  'Ad some trouble o' some kind.  BERT  Must 'ave.  [Train is heard.]  BILL  Ah, 'ere she is. Well, as I was saying...  Curtain  SCENE 4  In a second-class railway carriage.  Time: Same morning as Scene 1, Act I.  Noise, and a scene drawn past the windows. The scene, showing a momentary glimpse of fair English hills, is almost entirely placards, \"GIVE HER BOVRIL,\" \"GIVE HER OXO,\" alternately, for ever.  Occupants, JOHN BEAL, a girl, a man.  All sit in stoical silence like the two images near Luxor. The man has the window seat, and therefore the right of control over the window.  MIRALDA CLEMENT  Would you mind having the window open?  THE MAN IN THE CORNER [shrugging his shoulders in a shivery way]  Er--certainly. [Meaning he does not mind. He opens the window.]  MIRALDA CLEMENT  Thank you so much.  MAN IN THE CORNER  Not at all. [He does not mean to contradict her. Stoical silence again.]  MIRALDA CLEMENT  Would you mind having it shut now? I think it is rather cold.  MAN IN THE CORNER  Certainly.  [He shuts it. Silence again.]  MIRALDA CLEMENT  I think I'd like the window open again now for a bit. It is rather stuffy, isn't it?  MAN IN THE CORNER  Well, I think it's very cold.  MIRALDA CLEMENT  O, do you? But would you mind opening it for me?  MAN IN THE CORNER  I'd much rather it was shut, if you don't mind.  [She sighs, moves her hands slightly, and her pretty face expresses the resignation of the Christian martyr in the presence of lions. This for the benefit of John.]  JOHN  Allow me, madam.  [He leans across the window's rightful owner, a bigger man than he, and opens his window.  MAN IN THE CORNER shrugs his shoulders and, quite sensibly, turns to his paper.]  MIRALDA  O, thank you so much.  JOHN  Don't mention it.  [Silence again.]  VOICES OF PORTERS [Off]  Fan Kar, Fan Kar.  [MAN IN THE CORNER gets out.]  MIRALDA  Could you tell me where this is?  JOHN  Yes. Elephant and Castle.  MIRALDA  Thank you so much. It was kind of you to protect me from that horrid man. He wanted to suffocate me.  JOHN  O, very glad to assist you, I'm sure. Very glad.  MIRALDA  I should have been afraid to have done it in spite of him. It was splendid of you.  JOHN  O, that was nothing.  MIRALDA  O, it was, really.  JOHN  Only too glad to help you in any little way.  MIRALDA  It was so kind of you.  JOHN  O, not at all.  [Silence for a bit.]  MIRALDA  I've nobody to help me.  JOHN  Er, er, haven't you really?  MIRALDA  No, nobody.  JOHN  I'd be very glad to help you in any little way.  MIRALDA  I wonder if you could advise me.  JOHN  I--I'd do my best.  MIRALDA  You see, I have nobody to advise me.  JOHN  No, of course not.  MIRALDA  I live with my aunt, and she doesn't understand. I've no father or mother.  JOHN  O, er, er, really?  MIRALDA  No. And an uncle died and he left me a hundred thousand pounds.  JOHN  Really?  MIRALDA  Yes. He didn't like me. I think he did it out of contrariness as much as anything. He was always like that to me.  JOHN  Was he? Was he really?  MIRALDA  Yes. It was invested at twenty-five per cent. He never liked me. Thought I was too--I don't know what.  JOHN  No.  MIRALDA  That was five years ago, and I've never got a penny of it.  JOHN  Really. But, but that's not right.  MIRALDA [sadly]  No.  JOHN  Where's it invested?  MIRALDA  In Al Shaldomir.  JOHN  Where's that?  MIRALDA  I don't quite know. I never was good at geography. I never quite knew where Persia ends.  JOHN  And what kind of an investment was it?  MIRALDA  There's a pass in some mountains that they can get camels over, and a huge toll is levied on everything that goes by; that is the custom of the tribe that lives there, and I believe the toll is regularly collected.  JOHN  And who gets it?  MIRALDA  The chief of the tribe. He is called Ben Hussein. But my uncle lent him all this money, and the toll on the camels was what they call the security. They always carry gold and turquoise, you know.  JOHN  Do they?  MIRALDA  Yes, they get it from the rivers.  JOHN  I see.  MIRALDA  It does seem a shame his not paying, doesn't it?  JOHN  A shame? I should think it is. An awful shame. Why, it's a crying shame. He ought to go to prison.  MIRALDA  Yes, he ought. But you see it's so hard to find him. It isn't as if it was this side of Persia. It's being on the other side that is such a pity. If only it was in a country like, like...  JOHN  I'd soon find him. I'd... Why, a man like that deserves anything.  MIRALDA  It is good of you to say that.  JOHN  Why, I'd... And you say you never got a penny?  MIRALDA  No.  JOHN  Well, that is a shame. I call that a downright shame.  MIRALDA  Now, what ought I to do?  JOHN  Do? Well, now, you know in business there's nothing like being on the spot. When you're on the spot you can--but then, of course, it's so far.  MIRALDA  It is, isn't it?  JOHN  Still, I think you should go if you could. If only I could offer to help you in any way, I would gladly, but of course...  MIRALDA  What would you do?  JOHN  I'd go and find that Hussein fellow; and then...  MIRALDA  Yes?  JOHN  Why, I'd tell him a bit about the law, and make him see that you didn't keep all that money that belonged to someone else.  MIRALDA  Would you really?  JOHN  Nothing would please me better.  MIRALDA  Would you really? Would you go all that way?  JOHN  It's just the sort of thing that I should like, apart from the crying shame. The man ought to be...  MIRALDA  We're getting into Holborn. Would you come and lunch somewhere with me and talk it over?  JOHN  Gladly. I'd be glad to help. I've got to see a man on business first. I've come up to see him. And then after that, after that there was something I wanted to do after that. I can't think what it was. But something I wanted to do after"]]]
