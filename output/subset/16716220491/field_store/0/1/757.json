Mrs. Conway had just made breakfast when Ralph came in with a letter in his hand.  \"Here is a letter for you, mother; but please don't open it until you have given me my breakfast. I am very late now, and shall barely have time to get through with it and be there before the gates close.\"  \"Your porridge is quite ready for you, Ralph; so if you are late it will be your own fault not mine. The eggs will be in before you have eaten it. However, I won't open the letter until you have gone, because you will only waste time by asking questions about it.\"  Ralph began his bread and milk, and Mrs. Conway, stretching out her hand, took the letter he had laid beside his plate, and turning it over glanced at the direction to ascertain from which of her few correspondents it came. For a moment she looked puzzled, then, with a little start, she laid it down by the side of her plate. She had recognized the handwriting once so familiar to her.  \"What is it, mother? You look quite startled. Who is it from?\"  \"It is from no one you know, Ralph. I think it is from a person I have not heard from for some years. At any rate it will keep until you are off to school.\"  \"It's nothing unpleasant, I hope, mother. Your color has quite gone, and you look downright pale.\"  \"What should be the matter, you silly boy?\" Mrs. Conway said, with an attempt to smile. \"What could there be unpleasant in a letter from a person I have not heard from for years? There, go on with your breakfast. I expect you will hear some news when you get down into the town, for the guns in the castle have been firing, and I suppose there is news of a victory. They said yesterday that a great battle was expected to be fought against Napoleon somewhere near Leipzig.\"  \"Yes; I heard the guns, mother, and I expect there has been a victory. I hope not.\"  \"Why do you hope not, Ralph?\"  \"Why, of course, mother, I don't want the French to be beaten--not regularly beaten, till I am old enough to have a share in it. Just fancy what a nuisance it would be if peace was made just as I get my commission.\"  \"There will be plenty of time for you, Ralph,\" his mother said smiling. \"Peace has been patched up once or twice, but it never lasts long; and after fighting for the last twenty years it is hardly probable that the world is going to grow peaceful all at once. But there, it is time for you to be off; it only wants ten minutes to nine and you will have to run fast all the way to be in time.\"  When Mrs. Conway was alone she took up the letter, and turned it over several times before opening it.  What could Herbert Penfold have written about after all these years? Mrs. Conway was but thirty-six years old now, and was still a pretty woman, and a sudden thought sent a flush of color to her face. \"Never!\" she said decidedly. \"After the way in which he treated me he cannot suppose that now--\" and then she stopped. \"I know I did love him once, dearly, and it nearly broke my heart; but that was years and years ago. Well, let us see what he says for himself,\" and she broke open the letter. She glanced through it quickly, and then read it again more carefully. She was very pale now, and her lips trembled as she laid down the letter.  \"So,\" she said to herself in a low tone, \"it is to him after all I owe all this,\" and she looked round her pretty room; \"and I never once really suspected it. I am glad now,\" she went on after a pause, \"that I did not; for, of course, it would have been impossible to have taken it, and how different the last twelve years of my life would have been. Poor Herbert! And so he really suffered too, and he has thought of me all this time.\"  For fully half an hour she sat without moving, her thoughts busy with the past, then she again took up the letter and reread it several times. Its contents were as follows:      \"Dear Mrs. Conway: You will be doubtless surprised at seeing my     handwriting, and your first impulse will naturally be to put this     letter into the fire. I am not writing to ask you to forgive my     conduct in the old days. I am but too well aware how completely I     have forfeited all right to your esteem or consideration. Believe     me that I have suffered for my fault, and that my life has been a     ruined one. I attempt to make no excuses. I am conscious that     while others were to blame I was most of all, and that it is to my     own weakness of will and lack of energy that the breach between us     was due. However, all this is of the past and can now interest you     but little. You have had your own sorrows and trials, at which,     believe me, I sincerely grieved. And now to my object in writing     to you. Although still comparatively a young man, I have not many     years to live. When last in London I consulted two of the first     physicians, and they agreed that, as I had already suspected, I     was suffering from heart disease, or rather, perhaps, from an     enfeebled state of my heart, which may at any moment cease to do     its work.      \"Naturally then, I have turned my thoughts as to whom I should     leave my property. My sisters are amply provided for. I have no     other near relatives, and therefore consider myself free to leave     it as I choose. I have long fixed my thoughts upon the daughter of     a dear friend, the rector of Bilston; she is now thirteen years     old, and half my property is left her. I have left the other half     to your son. The whole subject to an annuity to yourself; which     you will not, I trust, refuse to accept. I have never thought of     any woman but you, and I hope that you will not allow your just     resentment against me to deprive me of the poor satisfaction of     making what atonement lies in my power for the cruel wrong I     formerly did you.      \"Were I strong and in health I can well imagine that you would     indignantly refuse to receive any benefits from my hands, but     knowing your kindness of heart, I feel sure that you will not     sadden the last days of a doomed man by the knowledge that even     after his death his hopes of insuring the comfort of the one woman     on earth he cared for are to be disappointed.      \"I should like to know your son. Would it be too much to ask you     to spare him for a while from time to time so long as I live? I     have a double motive, I say frankly, in thus asking him to come     here. I wish him and my little pet, Mabel Withers, to come to like     each other. I wish to divide my property between them, and yet I     should be glad if the whole estate could remain intact.      \"I should not be so foolish as to make a proviso that two persons     who are as yet so young, and who may not in any way be suitable to     each other, should marry, but nothing would please me so much as     that they should take a fancy to each other; and thrown together     as they would be here, for Mabel is constantly at the house, it is     just possible that one of those boy and girl affections, which do     sometimes, although perhaps rarely, culminate in marriage, might     spring up between them. Whether that may be so in the present case     I must leave to fate, but I should at any rate like to pave the     way for such an arrangement by bringing the young people together.     I need not say that it will be best that neither of them should     have the slightest idea of what is in my mind, for this would be     almost certain to defeat my object.      \"If the proposal is agreeable to you, I hope that you will let     Ralph come to me at the beginning of his holidays; which must, I     fancy, be now near at hand. I think it will be as well that he     should not know of my intention as to the disposal of my property,     for it is better he should think that he will have to work for his     living; but at the same time there would be no harm in his knowing     that it is probable I shall help him on in life. This will make     him bear better what would otherwise be a dull visit. But I leave     this matter entirely in your hands. You know the boy and I do not,     and you can therefore better judge what will be best for him to     know. And now, dear Mary, if you will pardon my once again calling     you so,      \"I remain,      \"Your affectionate friend,      \"HERBERT PENFOLD.\"  It was characteristic of Mrs. Conway that at the first reading of this letter she thought rather of the writer than of the bright prospects which his offer opened to her son. She thought rather of Herbert Penfold, her first love, now ill, if not dying, of the days of their engagement and its rupture, than of the fact that her son was to inherit half the Penfold estates. She had been sorely hurt at the time; and even after all these years it was a pleasure to her to know that the quarrel was not as she had often thought at the time, a mere pretext for breaking off the engagement, but that Herbert had really loved her, had cared for her all these years, and had been the mysterious friend whose kindness had so lightened her cares.  \"I did not throw away my love after all,\" she said to herself, as with her eyes full of tears she stood at the window and looked out towards the sea. \"He cared for me enough to be faithful all this time and to think of me constantly, while I had almost forgotten the past. I ought to have known all the time that he was acting under the influence of others--those sisters of his, of course. I was always certain they hated me--hated the thought of my becoming mistress of Penfold Hall. I knew the influence they had over him. Herbert had no will of his own--it was the only fault I ever saw in him--and they could twist him round their little fingers. And now he is going to make Ralph his heir, or at least his heir with the girl he speaks of. It is a grand thing for Ralph; for the estates were worth, he told papa, eight thousand a year, and if Herbert's little romance comes off Ralph"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],["title","Etiquette (#1)"],["body","knowledge, perhaps no other writer has done so much to bring disrepute on the \"manners and graces\" as Lord Chesterfield, and this, it is charged, because he debased them so heavily by considering them merely as the machinery of a successful career. To the moralists, the fact that the moral standards of society in Lord Chesterfield's day were very different from those of the present era rather adds to the odium that has become associated with his attitude. His severest critics, however, do concede that he is candid and outspoken, and many admit that his social strategy is widely practised even in these days.  But the aims of the world in which he moved were routed by the onrush of the ideals of democratic equality, fraternity, and liberty. With the prosperity of the newer shibboleths, the old-time notion of aristocracy, gentility, and high breeding became more and more a curio to be framed suitably in gold and kept in the glass case of an art museum. The crashing advance of the industrial age of gold thrust all courts and their sinuous graces aside for the unmistakable ledger balance of the counting-house. This new order of things had been a long time in process, when, in the first year of this century, a distinguished English social historian, the late The Right Honorable G.W.E. Russell, wrote: \"Probably in all ages of history men have liked money, but a hundred years ago they did not talk about it in society.... Birth, breeding, rank, accomplishments, eminence in literature, eminence in art, eminence in public service--all these things still count for something in society. But when combined they are only as the dust of the balance when weighed against the all-prevalent power of money. The worship of the Golden Calf is the characteristic cult of modern society.\" In the Elizabethan Age of mighty glory, three hundred years before this was said, Ben Jonson had railed against money as \"a thin membrane of honor,\" groaning: \"How hath all true reputation fallen since money began to have any!\" Now the very fact that the debasing effect of money on the social organism has been so constantly reprehended, from Scriptural days onward, proves the instinctive yearning of mankind for a system of life regulated by good taste, high intelligence and sound affections. But, it remains true that, in the succession of great commercial epochs, coincident with the progress of modern science and invention, _almost_ everything can be bought and sold, and so _almost_ everything is rated by the standard of money.  Yet, this standard is precisely not the ultimate test of the Christianity on which we have been pluming ourselves through the centuries. Still, no one can get along without money; and few of us get along very well with what we have. At least we think so--because everybody else seems to think that way. We Americans are members of the nation which, materially, is the richest, most prosperous and most promising in the world. This idea is dinned into our heads continually by foreign observers, and publicly we \"own the soft impeachment.\" Privately, each individual American seems driven with the decision that he must live up to the general conception of the nation as a whole. And he does, but in less strenuous moments he might profitably ponder the counsel of Gladstone to his countrymen: \"Let us respect the ancient manners and recollect that, if the true soul of chivalry has died among us, with it all that is good in society has died. Let us cherish a sober mind; take for granted that in our best performances there are latent many errors which in their own time will come to light.\"  America, too, has her ancient manners to remember and respect; but, in the rapid assimilation of new peoples into her economic and social organism, more pressing concerns take up nearly all her time. The perfection of manners by intensive cultivation of good taste, some believe, would be the greatest aid possible to the moralists who are alarmed over the decadence of the younger generation. Good taste may not make men or women really virtuous, but it will often save them from what theologians call \"occasions of sin.\" We may note, too, that grossness in manners forms a large proportion of the offenses that fanatical reformers foam about. Besides grossness, there is also the meaner selfishness. Selfishness is at the polar remove from the worldly manners of the old school, according to which, as Dr. Pusey wrote, others were preferred to self, pain was given to no one, no one was neglected, deference was shown to the weak and the aged, and unconscious courtesy extended to all inferiors. Such was the \"beauty\" of the old manners, which he felt consisted in \"acting upon Christian principle, and if in any case it became soulless, as apart from Christianity, the beautiful form was there, into which the real life might re-enter.\"  As a study of all that is admirable in American manners, and as a guide to behavior in the simplest as well as the most complex requirements of life day by day, whether we are at home or away from it, there can be no happier choice than the present volume. It is conceived in the belief that etiquette in its broader sense means the technique of human conduct under all circumstances in life. Yet all minutiæ of correct manners are included and no detail is too small to be explained, from the selection of a visiting card to the mystery of eating corn on the cob. Matters of clothes for men and women are treated with the same fullness of information and accuracy of taste as are questions of the furnishing of their houses and the training of their minds to social intercourse. But there is no exaggeration of the minor details at the expense of the more important spirit of personal conduct and attitude of mind. To dwell on formal trivialities, the author holds, is like \"measuring the letters of the sign-boards by the roadside instead of profiting by the directions they offer.\" She would have us know also that \"it is not the people who make small technical mistakes or even blunders, who are barred from the paths of good society, but those of sham and pretense whose veneered vulgarity at every step tramples the flowers in the gardens of cultivation.\" To her mind the structure of etiquette is comparable to that of a house, of which the foundation is ethics and the rest good taste, correct speech, quiet, unassuming behavior, and a proper pride of dignity.  To such as entertain the mistaken notion that politeness implies all give and little or no return, it is well to recall Coleridge's definition of a gentleman: \"We feel the gentlemanly character present with us,\" he said, \"whenever, under all circumstances of social intercourse, the trivial, not less than the important, through the whole detail of his manners and deportment, and with the ease of a habit, a person shows respect to others in such a way as at the same time implies, in his own feelings, and habitually, an assured anticipation of reciprocal respect from them to himself. In short, the gentlemanly character arises out of the feeling of equality acting as a habit, yet flexible to the varieties of rank, and modified without being disturbed or superseded by them.\" Definitions of a gentleman are numerous, and some of them famous; but we do not find such copiousness for choice in definitions of a lady. Perhaps it has been understood all along that the admirable and just characteristics of a gentleman should of necessity be those also of a lady, with the charm of womanhood combined. And, in these days, with the added responsibility of the vote.  Besides the significance of this volume as an indubitable authority on manners, it should be pointed out that as a social document, it is without precedent in American literature. In order that we may better realize the behavior and environment of well-bred people, the distinguished author has introduced actual persons and places in fictional guise. They are the persons and the places of her own world; and whether we can or can not penetrate the incognito of the Worldlys, the Gildings, the Kindharts, the Oldnames, and the others, is of no importance. Fictionally, they are real enough for us to be interested and instructed in their way of living. That they happen to move in what is known as Society is incidental, for, as the author declares at the very outset: \"Best Society is not a fellowship of the wealthy, nor does it seek to exclude those who are not of exalted birth; but it is an association of gentlefolk, of which good form in speech, charm of manner, knowledge of the social amenities, and instinctive consideration for the feelings of others, are the credentials by which society the world over recognizes its chosen members.\"  The immediate fact is that the characters of this book are thoroughbred Americans, representative of various sections of the country and free from the slightest tinge of snobbery. Not all of them are even well-to-do, in the postwar sense; and their devices of economy in household outlay, dress and entertainment are a revelation in the science of ways and means. There are parents, children, relatives and friends all passing before us in the pageant of life from the cradle to the grave. No circumstance, from an introduction to a wedding, is overlooked in this panorama and the spectator has beside him a cicerone in the person of the author who clears every doubt and answers every question. In course, the conviction grows upon him that etiquette is no flummery of poseurs \"aping the manners of their betters,\" nor a code of snobs, who divide their time between licking the boots of those above them and kicking at those below, but a system of rules of conduct based on respect of self coupled with respect of others. Meanwhile, to guard against conceit in his new knowledge, he may at odd moments recall Ben Jonson's lines:      \"Nor stand so much on your gentility,     Which is an airy, and mere borrowed thing,     From dead men's"]]]
