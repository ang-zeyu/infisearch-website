I believed it before your father died, but now--\"  \"Don't you believe it now?\" repeated the first child.  \"How can I believe it? You're old enough to understand. That's the last scuttle of coal we got. We ate the last bit of bread for supper to-night.\"  \"They say,\" put in the little boy, \"that if you hang up your stockings, Santa Claus'll fill 'em, 'cause of the Christ Child.\"  \"Don't you believe it, Sonny,\" said the mother desperately.  \"I'm going to hang up mine and see,\" said the littlest girl.  \"He's got too many other children to look after,\" said the woman, \"to care for the likes of us, I'm afraid, and--\"  \"But my Sunday-school teacher said He came to poor people special. He was awful poor Himself. Why, He was born in a stable. That's awful poor, ain't it?\" asked the boy.  \"When I was a girl,\" answered the mother, \"I lived on a farm and we had a stable there that was a palace to this hole we live in now. No, you'd better not hang up your stockings, none of you.\"  \"And you don't believe in Him, Mommy?\"  \"No. What would be the use if you hung 'em up and didn't find anything in 'em in the morning?\"  \"It'd be awful, but I believe in Him,\" said the littlest girl. \"I don't think God has forgot us, really. I'm going to try.\"  \"I tell you 'tain't no use.\"  \"Oh, yes, it is.\"  \"I'm sure it ain't. But have it your own way,\" said the woman. \"If someone would fill your stockings with milk and bread and--\"  \"I want a turkey,\" said the oldest girl.  \"And cranberry sauce,\" added the boy.  \"I want a doll-baby in mine,\" said the littlest girl.  The mother hid her face and groaned aloud.  \"You ain't sick, are you, Mommy?\"  \"I guess so. Come, you'd better say your prayers and go to bed. We don't have to keep the fire going so hard when you're all covered up.\"  It did not take long for the three little youngsters to divest themselves of the rags of clothing they wore. They slept in what passed for their underclothes, so there was no donning of white gowns for the night.  \"Here are our stockings, Mommy,\" said the oldest, handing three ragged, almost footless, black stockings to the woman.  \"It's no use, I tell you. I can't do it.\"  \"It won't do any harm, Mommy,\" urged the girl.  \"Do you believe in it, too?\" asked the mother, and the girl shook her head. \"You won't be disappointed in the morning if there's nothing in 'em?\"  \"No, I suppose it will be because Santa Claus was too busy.\"  With nervous fingers the woman hung the three stockings near the window. She was hungry, she was cold, she was broken, she was a mother. She could scarcely keep from crying.  \"Maybe you'll be glad you did it,\" said the littlest girl drowsily.  \"Ain't you comin' to bed, too, Mommy?\" asked the oldest, beneath the covers over the mattress on the floor.  \"In a little while.\"  \"And you won't forget to say your prayers?\"  \"I ain't said 'em for months, ever since your father was killed, and we got so poor.\"  \"But you'll say 'em to-night 'cause it's Christmas eve?\"  \"Yes, to-night,\" said the mother; \"now you go to sleep.\"  \"Are you waitin' for him to come, Mommy?\" asked the littlest girl, who was very sleepy.  \"Yes,\" said the mother.  Presently, as she sat in the dark, having turned out the light, the deep breathing of the children told her they were asleep. She rose quietly, stepped to the window, and stood looking at the three shapeless, tattered stockings. She was high up in the tenement and the moonlight came softly over the house roofs of the city into the bare, cold, cheerless room. She stared at the stockings and tears streamed down her wasted cheeks. She had hung them low at the suggestion of the littlest girl so the children could easily get at them in the morning.  [Illustration: She pressed them against her face.]  After a time she fell down on her knees. She pressed them against her face. She did not say anything. She could scarcely think anything. She just knelt there until something gently drew her head around. She dropped the stockings. She put her right hand on the window-ledge to steady herself and looked backward.  No sound save the breathing of the children and her own stifled sobs had broken the silence; the door was shut, but a man was there, a man of strange vesture seen dimly in the moon's radiance, yet there was a kind of light about his face. She could see his features. They were those of a man in middle years. They were lined with care. He had seen life on its seamy side. The woman felt that he had known poverty and loneliness. She stared up at him.  \"I didn't believe,\" she whispered; \"it cannot be. I thought we were forgotten.\"  The man slowly raised his hand. The moonlight struck fair upon it. She saw that it was calloused, the hand of a man who toiled. It was extended over her head. There was no bodily touch, but her head bent low down until she rested it upon her hands upon the floor. When she looked up, the room was empty. There was no sound save the breathing of the children and the throb of her own heart which beat wildly in the fearful hollow of her ear.  She heard a sound of strange footsteps outside the door. There was a crackle as of paper, the soft sound of things laid upon the floor, a gentle rapping on the panels, a light laugh, a rustle of draperies, footsteps moving away. As in a dream she got to her feet, she knew not how. She opened the door.  The hall was dimly illuminated. Her feet struck a little heap of joy-bringing parcels. She leaned back against the door-jamb, her hand to her heart, trembling. What could it mean?  A tiny voice broke the silence. It was the littlest girl turning over in her sleep, murmuring incoherently and then clearly:  \"If you only believe, that's enough; if you only believe.\"     IV  The Workman  \"IS NOT THIS THE CARPENTER?\"     IV  The Workman   In the mean squalid room back of the saloon half a score of men were assembled. They were all young in years, in other things not youthful. Some of them lounged against the wall. Some sat at tables. All were drinking. The air was foul with smoke and reeked with the odor of vile liquor.  \"We've got two jobs on hand to-night,\" said the leader of the gang. \"There's a crib to be cracked an' a guy to be croaked. Red, you an' Gypsie an' the Gunney will crack the crib. It's dead easy. Only an old man an' his wife. The servants are out except one an' he's fixed. I'll give you the layout presently. The other job's harder. Kid, I'll put you in charge, an' as it's got to be done early to-night I'll give you the orders now. He'll be at The Montmorency at ten o'clock. Someone will call him out to the street.\"  \"Who?\"  \"Never mind who. You'll be there in the car.\"  \"Whose car?\"  \"Never mind whose. Why're you askin' so many questions? It'll take you an' the four to The Montmorency at ten o'clock. When he comes out every one of you let go, the whole bunch, understand. If they don't find five bullets in him there'll be trouble to-morrow.\"  \"What do we get out of it?\"  \"A hundred apiece fer you an' a hundred an' fifty fer me fer engineerin' the job. Christmas money! You get me?\"  \"Of course. How'll we know who we've got to shoot?\"  \"I'll be there myself on the sidewalk. I'll point him out to you.\"  \"The police?\"  \"They're fixed.\"  \"Easy enough,\" said the Kid, the youngest of the gang.  \"Well, you guys,\" said the leader pointing out four of the men, \"will go with the Kid. The car'll be at the door in half an hour.\"  \"Now, gimme my orders,\" said Red.  The gang leader scribbled something on a bit of paper.  \"You go to that number with these two guys between midnight an' two in the mornin'. You'll find a back winder open. Here's the combination of the safe. The silver'll be in that.\"  \"Jewels?\"  \"In a wall cabinet upstairs. It'll be unlocked.\"  \"An' if they make any noise?\"  \"Croak 'em, of course. But don't make no noise doin' it. Better use a blackjack. We're not sure about the cop on that beat.\"  \"I understand.\"  \"Well, git your gats and make ready. Before we go, the drinks'll be on me. Fill up, men,\" he added, first pouring himself a liberal glassful, \"an' here's to bringin' it off easy.\"  With deep relish the toast was drunk by all save Red and the Kid. Red set his glass down on the table. The Kid dropped his to the floor.  \"There's somebody else in the room,\" whispered Red.  \"Yes, yonder by the door,\" said the Kid. \"You c'n jest see him.\"  \"Don't be a fool,\" said the gang leader. \"There's nobody here but us.\"  \"He's wearin' strange clothes,\" said Red.  \"He looks like a carpenter by his kit o' tools,\" said the Kid.  \"Here, pull yourselves together, men,\" said the gang leader; \"you're dippy, there's nobody here. Where's your nerve?\"  But Red made no move to obey. He thrust his glass from him and rose and leaned over the table staring. The other men shrank back glancing at the two figures, for the Kid had also dashed the proffered glass aside.  \"I see him,\" he said, \"he's lookin' at me, he's lookin' through me.\"  In his excitement he took a step forward and the table went over with a crash. The two men passed their hands over their eyes in bewilderment.  \"Why, there ain't nobody here,\" said the Kid.  \"But I seen him I tell you,\" persisted Red.  \"And so did I.\"  \"Well, he's gone, whoever he was, accordin' to your own showin',\" said the gang leader contemptuously. \"Now brace up. Take your liquor. Get a move on youse.\"  \"Not me,\" exclaimed Red suddenly.  \"Nor me,\" said the Kid.  \"What d'ye mean?\"  \"I won't do it.\"  \"Neither will I.\"  Both men moved to the door. The gang leader sprang to intercept them, his arms upraised, his hands clenched.  \"Lemme pass,\" said Red.  \"Are you goin'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14606"],["title","And Thus He Came: A Christmas Fantasy (#2)"],["body"," give us away?\"  \"No,\" answered Red. \"But you don't rob no house, an' you don't kill no man to-night.\"  \"You all know what that means,\" cried the leader. \"Here you men grab 'em.\"  But the rest of the gang hung back.  \"Mebbe they did see somethin',\" said one.  \"You cowardly dogs,\" cried the leader.  \"We won't mention no names to nobody,\" said the Kid, \"but you can't pull them jobs off. We'll jest warn 'em.\"  \"You swore you'd be true to the gang, that you'd obey orders an' follow directions.\"  \"We won't give ye away but I'm goin' to quit the gang an' go to work,\" said Red.  \"Me too,\" said the Kid.  \"Work! Hell!\" exclaimed the gang leader, but they shoved him out of the way and went out of the door.     V  Comforter     \"NEITHER DO I CONDEMN THEE\"     V  The Comforter   She was a daughter of shame. Even inexperience could see that as she wandered up and down the streets of the town, desperate, impelled to go on by a force too strong for her to resist. She trod the pavement, yet loathed the necessity and hated herself for her compliance. She had only to look forward to the jail or the hospital; yet there was always the river. Had it come to that? Was there nothing else?  She lifted her eyes from the stone walk as hard as the heart of the world, and found herself opposite a brightly lighted building. She leaned against the door. From within came the sound of music, the strains of a hymn, words of prayer. The light streamed about her face from the stained window. This was a Church of God. Stained window, stained woman, confronting each other in the night!  There was no God for her. There might have been once, but she had committed the unpardonable sin against society and society was God. There was no place for her anywhere, save the jail or the hospital or the river. That last was the best. The street was deserted. She had thought it not a good place in which to ply her trade! She made a step forward and stopped.  In her pathway stood a figure seen dimly in the darkness. It stood in the shadow beyond the broad light from the painted window. There was something strangely familiar about it. She glanced up at that window. Had the figure there stepped down and embodied itself vaguely on the walk before her?  [Illustration: She laid her hand upon the knob of the church door.]  What was this strange figure? Who was he? As she stared, the outline drew nearer. A man vested in long white draperies confronted her. He was bareheaded and appeared insensible to the cold in which she shivered. She put out her hand and something folded it back upon her breast. She opened her lips and something sealed them.  As she watched, the figure slowly moved. It bent forward and went slowly down on its knees on the sidewalk. The white hand began to trace strange, mysterious, unknown, incomprehensible characters upon the pavement. She watched with bated breath, some memory of another sinful woman of whom she had heard in childhood coming back to her prostrate mind. Yes, and there behind the figure stood others, hateful and hating, very violent, passionate men. She stared from the handwriting in the dust to these others and they faded away. She was alone with the kneeling figure and, as she looked, it too vanished in the chill air.  She bent over the pavement. There was nothing there, yet she had received a message. After a last glance she turned away, new courage, new life, new hope in her heart.  She mounted the steps, she laid her hand upon the knob of the church door, she turned it and went bravely within.     VI  The Burden Bearer  \"HE, BEARING HIS CROSS, WENT FORTH\"     VI  The Burden Bearer   The sound of the running feet of the man smashing through the burned stubble ceased abruptly. He stopped at the threshold of the door. No friendly bark of dog welcomed him. From the barn there came no gentle lowing of cattle, no homely clucking of chickens. Like the house the byre too had been ruined, gutted with flame.  The soldier whose march had brought him back to his own village that night stood in the entrance of what had been his home and stared at the smoking walls, the charred roof gaping to the sky, the empty casements. The enemy had been there. He whispered his young wife's name, he called softly to the baby, as if they might be sleeping somewhere within the devastated house. He listened for a reply but none came. Perhaps he would have been thankful even for a groan or a cry of agony, anything that meant life. But all was silence within, without.  Yonder on the winding road at the foot of the hill he could hear the trampling of men, the groaning of wheels, the clank of iron cavalrymen, the jingling of bits and swords, sharp words of command. The army was advancing. He could delay no longer. He must get back to his place in the ranks. Summoning his courage he crossed the threshold and stepped into the vacant emptiness of the house. Everything was gone but the four stone walls. There were unrecognizable heaps of ashes here and there. He bent over them fearfully in the twilight wondering whether the shapeless, formless masses were--  Something caught his eye. The one thing intact apparently. He stooped over it. It was the baby's shoe--white, it had been originally. He remembered it. Now it was stained with blood. That was all that was left--a little baby's shoe, blood spotted. He pressed it to his heart and groaned aloud. A spasm of mortal anguish shook his frame. He lifted his clenched hand toward the sky overshadowing the roofless walls.  Now he suddenly became aware that he was not alone. There was someone else in the room. He saw vaguely, indistinctly, a figure strangely clad, staggering on with bended back as if under some crushing load. He stared in the twilight striving to concentrate his faculties. The figure passed by. On its back was a shadowy something--beams of wood roughly crossed, he decided. It raised its head and looked at him. The face was somehow lighter than the rest.  The man's arm fell. The room was empty after all. He stared at the little shoe. Was it somewhere well with the child, with its mother? Unbuttoning his tunic he thrust the little shoe within, over his heart. He straightened up. Away off on the road a bugle call rang out above the tumult. He turned away, seized his rifle, shouldered it, stepped rapidly toward his regiment and his duty.     VII  The Thorn Crowned  \"THE SOLDIERS PLATTED A CROWN OF THORNS AND PUT IT ON HIS HEAD\"     VII  The Thorn Crowned   It was ghastly cold in the ruined church. It had been warm enough there during the day, but the fire that had gutted it had died like the young acolyte, like the aged sacristan, the venerable mother, the sweet young novice, the women who had sought shelter there in vain. Neither the dignity of age nor the sweetness of maidenhood nor the innocence of youth nor the sanctity of profession had availed.  The old priest was glad they were dead. Life after what they had suffered had been unthinkable. He thanked God for that oblivion. He wished that he, too, might die in that violated shrine where he had peacefully ministered for so long a time. They had taken the flock, the shepherd must follow. He should have led.  He had fought, oh, he had played the man for the honor of the poor lambs committed to him. Had he done right? Should he not have stood dumb before the shearers? They had shot him and stabbed him and beaten him into insensibility. The last thing he had heard was the shriek of one woman, the piteous appeal of another. They thought he was dead, but he was living. Why had he not died?  How could God be so cruel? This was war. This ruined sanctuary, these broken men and women who had sought only to serve Him! Was there a God indeed? Faith, hope, what were they? Assurance, trust? Words, words! Ah, how he suffered.  [Illustration: \"It is He,\" whispered the priest. \"His sorrow was greater than mine.\"]  It was bitter cold and yet he burned with fever. The tremors of pain so exquisite that they might almost be counted pleasure shot through his ruined, torn, broken figure, yet he recked little of these. It was the shame, the shame. He had been zealous for the Lord of Hosts. There was no God. Men were not made in any image save that of hell. He could not move hand or foot, but he could see. He could speak. He could curse God and die.  As his lips framed that anathema he saw vaguely the figure of a stranger; a slender, wasted body, dark stains upon it in the moonlight. It wore some kind of curious headgear. The man stared. The light was reflected from the sharp points of long thorns. A cloth was fastened about the loins. The figure stood very straight in the desecrated Holy of Holies. A light seemed to come from its face. Its eyes looked at the man with great pity. Slowly the figure raised its arms. Slowly the arms extended themselves; there were blood-stains in the palms of the hands.  \"It is He,\" whispered the priest. \"His sorrow was greater than mine. Lord, I believe.\"  He knew nothing more save that a great peace had suddenly stolen around him.     VIII  The Broken Hearted     \"ONE OF THE SOLDIERS WITH A SPEAR PIERCED HIS SIDE\"     VIII  The Broken Hearted   \"I'll get that man if I die for it,\" said the soldier. \"He's found the one position in the lines from which he can fire into our trenches.\"  \"It's easier said than done,\" remarked his comrade, \"and the minute you cross that spot you come within his range. He'll put a bullet through you before you can level a rifle or press a trigger.\"  \"I'll not go that way,\" said the man.  \"What is your plan?\"  \"You know that salient yonder on the right? I'm going out of the trench there.\"  \"When?\"  \"Now. I'll wrap myself in white. That little run of coppice will cover me until I get within a few feet of him, then I'll have to chance it.\"  \"Wish I could help you, old man. I'd like to get that man. He's shot six of the best fellows in the company and--\"  \"You can help me by making a diversion to attract his attention. Keep"]]]
