Then he could come back the next day and there would be more of that wonderful water all ready and waiting for him to drink up.     IV  CUFFY LEARNS SOMETHING   After leaving the wonderful spring Cuffy Bear was so long getting home that he decided he would not say anything to his father and mother about what he had found. You see--he was afraid they would tell him not to go so far away from home again. But Cuffy had not been long in the snug little house before he had a terrible stomach-ache. He stood the pain as long as he could without saying anything. But he simply _had_ to hang onto his little fat stomach with both his front paws. And at last he began to cry softly. Then Mrs. Bear asked him what he had been doing; and before Cuffy knew it he had told all about finding the delicious, sweet water.  \"How much did you drink?\" asked his mother.  \"Oh--only a little,\" Cuffy answered faintly.  Then Mrs. Bear nodded her head three times. She was very wise--was Mrs. Bear. And she knew quite well that Cuffy had drunk a great deal too much of that nice-tasting water. So she made Cuffy lie down and gave him some peppermint leaves to chew. In a little while he began to feel so much better that before he knew it he had fallen asleep.  When Cuffy waked up he found that his father had come home. And soon Mr. Bear had Cuffy on one knee, and Silkie on the other, and he was telling them all about maple-sugar. For of course you knew all the time that what Cuffy had found was not a spring at all--but a sugar-maple tree, which Farmer Green had tapped so that he might gather the sap and boil it until it turned to maple-sugar. If Cuffy had gone further down the mountainside he would have found a great many other trees, each--like the one he discovered--with a tin bucket hanging on it to catch the sweet sap.  \"So you see there are many things for little bears to learn,\" Mr. Bear said, when he had finished. \"And the one _big_ lesson you must learn is to keep away from men. Farmer Green visits those trees every day to gather the sap. So you must not go down there again.\"  A cold shiver went up and down Cuffy's back at these words. Farmer Green! Cuffy had heard a great deal about Farmer Green and he certainly did not want to meet him all alone and far from home. But as soon as the tickle of that shiver stopped, Cuffy forgot all about his fright.  \"This maple-sugar--does it taste as good as the sweet sap?\" he asked his father.  \"Yes, my son--a hundred times better!\" Mr. Bear replied. \"I ate some once And I shall never forget it.\"  _A hundred times better!_ After he had gone to bed that night the words kept ringing in Cuffy's ears. _A hundred times better! A hundred times better!... A hundred_--And now Cuffy was fast asleep and--I am sorry to say it--sucking one of his paws for all the world as if it was a piece of Farmer Green's maple-sugar.     V  CUFFY AND THE MAPLE-SUGAR   Another day had come and all the morning long Cuffy Bear and his sister Silkie played and played as hard as they could. They played that they were making maple-sugar. And they pretended to hang buckets on all the trees near Mr. Bear's house. There were no maple trees about Cuffy's home--only pine and hemlock and spruce--but if you are just _pretending_ to make maple-sugar any sort of tree will do.  While they were playing Cuffy kept wishing for some _real_ maple-sugar. After all, the little cakes of snow that he and Silkie made and _called_ maple-sugar seemed very tasteless, no matter how much Cuffy pretended. And later, when Silkie was taking her nap, and Cuffy had no one to play with, he became so angry with the make-believe sugar that he struck the little pats of snow as hard as he could and spoiled them. And then, after one look toward the door of his father's house--to make sure that his mother did not see him--Cuffy started on a trot down the mountainside.  What do you suppose he was going to do?  To tell the truth, Cuffy himself did not quite know. When he came to the tree that he had found the day before he stopped and drank some of the sap once more; and he tried to imagine how sugar would taste _a hundred times sweeter_. Then Cuffy went on down the mountainside.  At last he spied a little house in a clearing. From its chimney a stream of smoke rose, and as Cuffy peeped from behind a tree he saw a man come out and pick up an armful of wood from the woodpile nearby. While Cuffy watched, the man carried in several loads. Soon the smoke began fairly to pour out of the chimney; and then the man came out once more, picked up an axe near the woodpile, and started off toward the other side of the clearing.  Cuffy was trembling with excitement. The wind blew right in his face and brought to him two odors that were quite different. One was the man-scent, which Cuffy did not like at all, and which made his legs want to run away. The other smell was most delightfully sweet. And it made his nose want to go forward.  Which do you think won--Cuffy's nose or his legs?... Yes! His nose won! Pretty soon Cuffy slipped from behind the tree and scampered as fast as he could run to the door of the sugar-house--for that was what he had found. He stuck his head inside and oh, joy! there was no one there.  Just inside the door stood a tub full of something brown. One sniff told Cuffy that it was maple-sugar and he began to gulp great mouthfuls of it. Yes! his father was right. It certainly was a hundred times sweeter than the sap.  In the middle of the room was a big pan which gave off clouds of steam. Cuffy wanted to see it. And with his mouth full of sugar he walked up to the pan and looked into it. He saw a golden liquid, and Cuffy felt that he simply _must_ taste that too. So he dipped both his front paws right into the bubbling syrup.     VI  CUFFY MEETS A MAN   And then how Cuffy Bear did roar--just one second after he had stuck his paws into the steaming pan. You see--he was so greedy that he had never once stopped to think that the syrup was boiling hot.  Now, usually if you pick up anything hot you can drop it at once. But it is not so with hot maple syrup. Cuffy's paws were covered with the sticky brown stuff. He rubbed them upon his trousers, and he roared again when he saw what he had done.  Then Cuffy had a happy thought. He would go out and shove his paws into a snowbank. That would surely cool them. So out of the sugar-house he dashed and across the clearing he ran, screaming _\"Ough! ough! ough!\"_ at the top of his voice, for the hot syrup made his paws smart terribly. In his haste Cuffy did not notice that he was headed in the direction in which the man had disappeared.  Now it happened that the man who tended the sugar-house fire had gone only to the edge of the clearing; and when he heard Cuffy's shrieks he looked around in great surprise. He and Cuffy saw each other at the same time. And like a flash Cuffy turned and fairly flew the other way.  The man ran after him for a few steps. But he soon saw that he could never catch Cuffy. So he stood still and watched the little bear bob into the woods and vanish.  Poor Cuffy's heart was beating as if it would burst. He was so frightened that he forgot all about his burned paws and he ran and ran and ran up the steep mountainside. He did not mind the climb; he was used to that. But to his great alarm the snow clung to his sticky paws until each was just a great, round lump. They looked like the hands of a snow-man.  Cuffy found it very hard to run with his paws like that. But he kept on and on, until at last he came in sight of his father's house. Then he stopped and sat down, right behind a knoll, where his mother could not see him. He was very tired. And though he was no longer afraid that the man would catch him, he began to be afraid of something else.... A punishing? No--no! He had not thought of that. Cuffy was afraid that he could never get rid of those big heavy lumps. He was afraid his paws would always be covered with those hard balls of snow. You must remember that he was a very _young_ little bear.  Well! After he had got his breath again Cuffy began to nibble at his snow mittens. And little by little--to his delight--he removed them. And still he kept on nibbling at his paws, and--yes! he actually put them right inside his mouth and sucked them. He forgot all about his _manners_, for underneath the snow he found the most beautiful, waxy maple-sugar you can imagine. Each paw was just one big lollypop! And though his burns still hurt him, Cuffy did not care very much. For those lollypops were _two hundred times_ sweeter than anything he had ever tasted in all his life!     VII  THE ICE GOES OUT OF THE RIVER   Farmer Green had taken his sap-buckets off the maple trees and _that_ meant the spring was fast going. At least, that was what Mr. Bear said. And Cuffy noticed that every day there was a little less snow than there had been the day before.  \"The ice will soon go out,\" Mr. Bear said to Cuffy's mother at breakfast one morning, \"and then when I cross Pleasant Valley I shall have to swim the river.\"  Cuffy knew that his father meant Swift River. In summer Cuffy could look down from Blue Mountain and see the stream as it flashed through the valley.  \"Will the ice go out of the river to-day?\" Cuffy asked.  \"Well, now--\" Mr. Bear said, \"it might. And then again, it might not.\" Mr. Bear never said a thing was _so_ unless he was sure of it.  Now, Cuffy thought it would be great fun to go down into the valley and find out for himself if the ice really did go out. He had an idea that it caused a terrific splitting and crashing and thundering noise and he thought that perhaps some fish would be tossed up on the bank and then he would have a good lunch.  When Mr. Bear had gone off down the mountain, \"to see a bear,\" as he explained to his wife, little Cuffy sneaked away from the house. His mother was making the beds, and Silkie was pretending to help her. Now,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15528"],["title","The Tale of Cuffy Bear (#2)"],["body","_sneaks_ unless he knows he is doing something wrong. Cuffy knew that his parents would not let him go down into the valley alone, so he went without asking. And when he did at last come to the river there was ice along both banks; but between them ran a broad stream of swift water.  \"The ice must have gone out in the night,\" Cuffy said to himself. And he looked about in the hope of finding some fish on the banks. But not one fish could he find.  He was disappointed. And he crept out onto the ice as far as he could go and peeped over the edge into the water. He thought maybe he could at least catch a fish with his paw.  Cuffy lay quite still for a long time. And then at last to his delight he saw a fish right before him. He made a quick reach for it. And then there was a sharp _crack!_ The ice tipped and Cuffy clung to it with all his claws to keep from falling into the river. He backed away from the edge and looked around. The bank was moving past him. He had never seen such a thing and he was surprised.  Then he gave a cry which sounded in his throat like _\"Oug!\"_ and ended with _\"I-s-s-s!\"_ through his nose. It meant that Cuffy was frightened. For he saw that the ice he was on had broken away and was floating rapidly down the stream.  He had not caught the fish, either. But he forgot all about that now.     VIII  CUFFY LEARNS TO SWIM   Yes! Cuffy Bear was floating down the river on a cake of ice! How he wished he had been a good little bear and stayed at home, instead of running away to the river all alone! He was huddled up in a little black heap in the center of the cake, and crying as if his heart would break. For Cuffy thought he would never see his mother and father and Silkie again. If only he knew how to swim, like his father! But he didn't; and there he was, being swept away down the valley, right toward Farmer Green's house. It certainly was enough to make anybody weep.  When Cuffy thought about Farmer Green he was more frightened than ever and he began to scream. He remembered all the dreadful things he had heard about men and the things they do to little bears.  Pretty soon Cuffy saw something move up on the bank ahead of him. And he stopped screaming. He was afraid that it was Farmer Green himself and he thought he had better keep still. Then perhaps Farmer Green wouldn't see him. But to his dismay the big black thing began to slide down the steep bank right toward the river.  Cuffy's heart seemed to stand still. He shut his eyes tight and tried to make himself as small as he could. And he hardly breathed.  Then somebody called his name. Cuffy was so surprised that he looked up, and there was his father standing on the edge of the stream. Cuffy was _so_ glad to see him!  Mr. Bear seemed very cross, but Cuffy did not mind that, he was _so_ glad to see his father.  \"Oh, Father! What shall I do?\" Cuffy cried.  Mr. Bear said just one word. It was _\"Jump!\"_  Cuffy could hardly believe his ears.  _\"Jump!\"_ said Mr. Bear again.  \"I don't know how to swim,\" Cuffy whined.  _\"Jump, jump, jump!\"_ Mr. Bear repeated very sternly.  Still Cuffy did not jump. He was so afraid of that rushing water!  Then Mr. Bear became very, very angry. He gave a great roar and plunged into the icy water. With a few strong strokes--for Mr. Bear was a fine swimmer--he reached the middle of the river. And as he swam close up to Cuffy he reached out and gave that naughty, frightened little bear a shove that sent him flying into the stream.  Cuffy started to scream. But his shriek was cut off short as he sank, head and all, into the cold, cold river. In another moment his nose came up out of the water. It was only an instant, but to Cuffy it seemed a long, long time before he could breathe again. And now, to his great surprise, he found that he was swimming as well as his father.  Now, little bears are different from little boys and girls. They don't have to _learn_ to swim. Cuffy didn't know it. But his father did. That was why Mr. Bear told him to jump. He knew that as soon as Cuffy found himself in the water he could swim as well as anybody.  In another minute Cuffy and his father were safe on the bank, and in another second after that they were running toward home as fast as Cuffy could go, so they wouldn't take cold, you know.  Cuffy had to go to bed for the rest of the day, as a punishment. And as he lay on his little bed he could hear his father and mother laughing in the next room. He didn't see how they could laugh. But you know, Cuffy didn't realize how funny he had looked, floating down the river on the cake of ice.     IX  A SURPRISE   One day Cuffy Bear and his little sister Silkie had been making sand pies. And now, having grown tired of that, they were squatting down on the ground and had covered their legs with the clean white sand. Perhaps they would have heaped the sand all over themselves, if Silkie had not spied her father as he came climbing up the mountain. When they noticed that he was carrying something they both sprang up and ran to see what Mr. Bear was bringing home.  Mr. Bear's mouth was stretched quite wide in what Silkie and Cuffy knew to be his most agreeable smile. You and I might not have felt so comfortable if we had looked past Mr. Bear's great white teeth into his big red mouth. But it was different with Cuffy and Silkie. They saw at once that their father was feeling very pleasant.  \"What's that?\" Silkie asked. As for Cuffy, he had not stopped to ask any questions. He was already smelling of the small white animal his father had, and he poked it gently with his paw. He had not forgotten about the porcupine. But this strange animal seemed quite harmless. It was covered with things that looked a little bit like quills, only they were ever so much shorter and smaller. And Cuffy found that they were much softer, too, for they did not prick him at all.  \"What is it?\" This time it was Cuffy who asked.  \"You'll see,\" Mr. Bear said again.  \"Is it a new kind of rabbit?\" Silkie inquired.  \"Huh! A rabbit!\" Cuffy laughed. \"Of course it isn't a rabbit,\" he said.  \"Well--it's white, and its tail is short--\" Silkie began, \"and--\"  \"Its ears are too small,\" Cuffy told her, \"and its tail is all curled up.\"  \"You'll see, children,\" Mr. Bear said again. \"It's a surprise.\"  \"A surprise!\" Cuffy and Silkie both shouted. They thought that was the name of the--oh! I almost told what the little animal really was.  Well! As Mr. Bear walked on toward his house, Cuffy and Silkie ran ahead and burst in upon their mother, both of them shouting at the top of their voices, \"A surprise! A surprise! Father's bringing home a surprise!\"  \"Why, Ephraim Bear!\" Mrs. Bear exclaimed, as soon as she saw her husband. \"Wherever did you get that lovely little pig?\"  There--now you know what it was that Mr. Bear had.  \"It came from Farmer Green's, my dear,\" Mr. Bear said. \"I remembered that this was your birthday, and so I thought I would bring home something 'specially nice, so that we could have a real feast.\"  Cuffy and Silkie had never eaten any pig before. And when there was nothing left of the surprise except a few bones, Cuffy couldn't help wishing that every day could be a birthday.     X  CUFFY CLIMBS BLUE MOUNTAIN   Cuffy Bear had never been very far up Blue Mountain beyond the place where his father's house nestled among the evergreens. You know, the summer before he had been a very small little bear indeed, and the higher one goes up Blue Mountain the harder the climbing becomes. But now Cuffy was growing very fast; and he was able to scramble up places he could never have even crept a year ago. Each day now Cuffy climbed a little nearer the top of Blue Mountain. And at last the day came when he reached the very top. It was so high that the trees did not grow there. He found nothing but rocks everywhere, with just a little earth to fill the cracks.  Cuffy thought it great fun to clamber about all by himself and look down at the hills and valleys that stretched away in all directions. Indeed, he hated to leave that delightful spot. But he noticed that the sun was getting low in the west and he knew that he must hurry home. So Cuffy started down the mountainside.  He did not pick out the easiest way to go. Oh, no! He chose the very steepest places to slide down. And as he went slipping down the steepest cliff of all he came upon something that gave him a great surprise. For he saw, built right in the crack of a ledge, a big bird's nest made of sticks. It was the biggest bird's nest Cuffy had ever seen; and in it were two great white eggs. They were the greatest white eggs Cuffy had ever seen, too.  How lucky! At least, that was what Cuffy thought then. For he was very fond of birds' eggs, and his climb had made him even hungrier than usual. He stopped then and there and with one rap of the paw he broke one of the eggs and began to eat it.  Cuffy was enjoying his lunch very much. He had almost finished the first egg and was just about to turn to the other when he heard a deafening scream.  Cuffy looked all around. He thought that perhaps there was a pig up there on the mountain. But no! He couldn't see a thing. Then came that cry again. This time it was louder. And it seemed to come from right over Cuffy's head. He looked up then. And there was an enormous bird dropping right down on top of him! It seemed to Cuffy that its wings stretched as wide as the branches of the great pine tree in his father's front-yard. He never even dreamed that there could be as big a bird in the whole world. And during that one instant that Cuffy's little beady bright eyes were turned upwards he saw that the great bird had a wicked, hooked beak and claws that were as sharp as his own, and ever so much longer.  One look was enough for Cuffy. He turned and tumbled down the steep cliff, head over heels, with the eagle following him.     XI  MRS. EAGLE IS ANGRY   Yes!
