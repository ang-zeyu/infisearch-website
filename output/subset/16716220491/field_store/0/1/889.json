Of course he did, for his legs are long and made for running, but Striped Chipmunk was not far behind. Johnny Chuck took his time, for he knew that he could not keep up with the others. Besides he was so fat that to run made him puff and blow. Grandfather Frog sat just as usual on his big green lily-pad, and he grinned when he saw who his visitors were, for he guessed right away what they had come for.  \"Chug-a-rum! What is it you want to know now?\" he demanded, before Peter could fairly get his breath.  \"If you please, Grandfather Frog, we want to know why it is that Unc' Billy Possum plays dead,\" replied Peter as politely as he knew how.  Grandfather Frog chuckled. \"Just to fool people, stupid!\" said he.  \"Of course we know that,\" replied Striped Chipmunk, \"but what we want to know is how he ever found out that he could fool people that way, and how he knows that he will fool them.\"  \"I suspect that his mammy taught him,\" said Grandfather Frog, with another chuckle way down deep in his throat.  \"But who taught his mammy?\" persisted Striped Chipmunk.  Grandfather Frog snapped at a foolish green fly, and when it was safely tucked away inside his white and yellow waistcoat, he turned once more to his three little visitors, and there was a twinkle in his big, goggly eyes.  \"I see,\" said he, \"that you _will_ have a story, and I suppose that the sooner I tell it to you, the sooner you will leave me in peace. Unc' Billy Possum's grandfather a thousand times removed was--\"  \"Was this way back in the days when the world was young?\" interrupted Peter.  Grandfather Frog scowled at Peter. \"If I have any more interruptions, there will be no story to-day\" said he severely.  Peter looked ashamed and promised that he would hold his tongue right between his teeth until Grandfather Frog was through. Grandfather Frog cleared his throat and began again.  \"Unc' Billy Possum's grandfather a thousand times removed was very much as Unc' Billy is now, only he was a little more spry and knew better than to stuff himself so full that he couldn't run. He was always very sly, and he played a great many tricks on his neighbors, and sometimes he got them into trouble. But when he did, he always managed to keep out of their way until they had forgotten all about their anger.  \"One morning the very imp of mischief seemed to get into old Mr. Possum's head. Yes, Sir, it certainly did seem that way. And when you see Mischief trotting along the Lone Little Path, if you look sharp enough, you'll see Trouble following at his heels like a shadow. I never knew it to fail. It's just as sure as a stomach-ache is to follow overeating.\"  Just here Grandfather Frog paused and looked very hard at Peter Rabbit. But Peter pretended not to notice, and after slowly winking one of his big, goggly eyes at Johnny Chuck, Grandfather Frog continued:  \"Anyway, as I said before, the imp of mischief seemed to be in old Mr. Possum's head that morning, for he began to play tricks on his neighbors as soon as they were out of bed. He hid Old King Bear's breakfast, while the latter had his head turned, and then pretended that he had just come along. He was very polite and offered to help Old King Bear hunt for his lost breakfast. Then, whenever Old King Bear came near the place where it was hidden, old Mr. Possum would hide it somewhere else. Old King Bear was hungry, and he worked himself up into a terrible rage, for he was in a hurry for his breakfast. Old Mr. Possum was very sympathetic and seemed to be doing his very best to find the lost meal. At last Old King Bear turned his head suddenly and caught sight of old Mr. Possum hiding that breakfast in a new place. My, my, but his temper did boil over! It certainly did. And if he could have laid hands on old Mr. Possum that minute, it surely would have been the end of him.  \"But old Mr. Possum was mighty spry, and he went off through the Green Forest laughing fit to kill himself. Pretty soon he met Mr. Panther. He was very polite to Mr. Panther. He told him that he had just come from a call on Old King Bear, and hinted that Old King Bear was then enjoying a feast and that there might be enough for Mr. Panther, if he hurried up there at once.  \"Now, Mr. Panther was hungry, for he had found nothing for his breakfast that morning. So he thanked old Mr. Possum and hurried away to find Old King Bear and share in the good things old Mr. Possum had told about.  \"Old Mr. Possum himself hurried on, chuckling as he thought of the way Mr. Panther was likely to be received, with Old King Bear in such a temper. Pretty soon along came Mr. Lynx. Old Mr. Possum told him the same story he had told Mr. Panther, and Mr. Lynx went bounding off in a terrible hurry, for fear that he would not be in time to share in that good breakfast. It was such a good joke that old Mr. Possum tried it on Mr. Wolf and Mr. Fisher and Mr. Fox. In fact, he hunted up every one he could think of and sent them to call on Old King Bear, and without really telling them so, he made each one think that he would get a share in that breakfast.\"  \"Now, there wasn't any more breakfast than Old King Bear wanted himself, and by the time Mr. Panther arrived, there wasn't so much as a crumb left. Then, one after another, the others came dropping in, each licking his chops, and all very polite to Old King Bear. At first he didn't know what to make of it, but pretty soon Mr. Fox delicately hinted that they had come in response to the invitation sent by Mr. Possum, and that as they were all very hungry, they would like to know when the feast would be ready. Right away Old King Bear knew that old Mr. Possum had been up to some of his tricks, and he told his visitors that they were the victims of a practical joke.  [Illustration: \"As they were all very hungry, they would like to know when the feast would be ready.\"]  \"My, my, my, how angry everybody grew! With Old King Bear at their head, they started out to hunt for old Mr. Possum. When he saw them coming, he realized that what he had thought was a joke had become no longer a laughing matter for him. He was too frightened to run, so he scrambled up a tree. He quite forgot that Mr. Panther and Mr. Lynx could climb just as fast as he. Up the tree after him they scrambled, and he crept as far out as he could get on one of the branches. Mr. Panther didn't dare go out there, so he just shook the branch. He shook and shook and shook and shook, and the first thing old Mr. Possum knew, he was flying through the air down to where the others were all ready to pounce on him.  \"Old Mr. Possum was frightened almost to death. He shut his eyes, and then he landed with a thump that knocked all the wind from his body. When he got his breath again, he still kept his eyes closed, for he couldn't bear the thought of looking at the cruel teeth and claws of Old King Bear and the others. Presently, while he was wondering why they didn't jump on him and tear him to pieces, Old King Bear spoke:  \"'I guess Mr. Possum won't play any more jokes, Mr. Panther,' said he. 'You just knocked the life out of him when you shook him off that branch.'  \"Mr. Panther came over and sniffed at Mr. Possum and turned him over with one paw. All the time Mr. Possum lay just as if he were dead, because he was too frightened to move. 'I didn't mean to kill him,' said Mr. Panther. 'We certainly will miss him. What will we do with him?'  \"'Leave him here as a warning to others,' growled Old King Bear.  \"Each in turn came up and sniffed of Mr. Possum, and then they all went about their business. He waited long enough to make sure that they were out of sight, and then took the shortest way home. When he got there and thought it all over, he thought that the best joke of all was the way he had made everybody think that he was dead. And then a bright idea struck him: he would try the same trick whenever he was caught. So the next time he got in trouble, instead of running away, he tried playing dead. It was such a success that he taught his children how to do it, and they taught their children, and so on down to Unc' Billy, whom you know. Unc' Billy says it is a lot easier than running away, and safer, too. Besides, it is always such a joke. Now, don't bother me any more, for I want to take a nap,\" concluded Grandfather Frog.  \"Thank you!\" cried Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk, and started off to hunt up Unc' Billy Possum.     IV  WHY REDDY FOX WEARS RED   Peter Rabbit sat in the middle of the dear Old Briar-patch making faces and laughing at Reddy Fox. Of course that wasn't a nice thing to do, not a bit nice. But Peter had just had a narrow escape, a very narrow escape, for Reddy Fox had sprung out from behind a bush as Peter came down the Lone Little Path, and had so nearly caught Peter that he had actually pulled some fur out of Peter's coat. Now Peter was safe in the dear Old Briar-patch. He was a little out of breath, because he had had to use his long legs as fast as he knew how, but he was safe. You see, Reddy Fox wouldn't run the risk of tearing his handsome red coat on the brambles. Besides, they scratched terribly.  \"Never mind, Peter Rabbit, I'll get you yet!\" snarled Reddy, as he gave up and started back for the Green Forest.      \"Reddy Fox is very sly!      Reddy Fox is very spry!      But sly and spry, 'tis vain to try      To be as sly and spry as I.\"  When Peter Rabbit shouted this, Reddy looked back and showed all his teeth, but Peter only laughed, and Reddy trotted on. Peter watched him out of sight.  \"My! I wish I had such a handsome coat,\" he said, with a long sigh, for you know Peter's coat is very plain, very plain, indeed.  \"You wouldn't, if you had to wear it for the same reason that Reddy Fox has to wear his. A good heart and honest ways are better than fine clothes, Peter Rabbit.\"  Peter looked up. There was saucy, pert, little Jenny Wren fussing around in one of the old bramble bushes.  \"Hello, Jenny!\" said Peter. \"Why does"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],["title","The Hymns of Prudentius (#1)"],["body","within his breast.    Nor ever reckless word he said   Thereafter, by his tongue betrayed,   But at the cock's familiar cry   Humbled he turned from vanity.    Therefore it is we hold to-day   That, as the world in stillness lay,   What hour the cock doth greet the skies,   Christ from deep Hades did arise.    Lo! then the bands of death were burst,   Shattered the sway of hell accurst:   Then did the Day's superior might   Swiftly dispel the hosts of Night.    Now let base deeds to silence fall,   Black thoughts be stilled beyond recall:   Now let sin's opiate spell retire   To that deep sleep it doth inspire.    For all the hours that still remain   Until the dark his goal attain,   Alert for duty's stern command   Let every soul a sentry stand.    With sober prayer on Jesus call;   Let tears with our strong crying fall;   Sleep cannot on the pure soul steal   That supplicates with fervent zeal.    Too long did dull oblivion cloud   Our motions and our senses shroud:   Lulled by her numbing touch, we stray   In dreamland's ineffectual way.    Bound by the dazzling world's soft chain   'Tis false and fleeting gauds we gain,   Like those who in deep slumbers lie:--   Let us awake! the truth is nigh.    Gold, honours, pleasure, wealth and ease,   And all the joys that mortals please,   Joys with a fatal glamour fraught--   When morning comes, lo! all are nought.    But thou, O Christ, put sleep to flight   And break the iron bands of night,   Free us from burden of past sin   And shed Thy morning rays within.                               II. HYMNUS MATUTINUS       Nox et tenebrae et nubila,   confusa mundi et turbida,   lux intrat, albescit polus,   Christus venit, discedite.      Caligo terrae scinditur          5   percussa solis spiculo,   rebusque iam color redit   vultu nitentis sideris.      Sic nostra mox obscuritas   fraudisque pectus conscium        10   ruptis retectum nubibus   regnante pallescit Deo.      Tunc non licebit claudere   quod quisque fuscum cogitat,   sed mane clarescent novo          15   secreta mentis prodita.      Fur ante lucem squalido   inpune peccat tempore,   sed lux dolis contraria   latere furtum non sinit.          20      Versuta fraus et callida   amat tenebris obtegi,   aptamque noctem turpibus   adulter occultus fovet.      Sol ecce surgit igneus,         25   piget, pudescit, paenitet,   nec teste quisquam lumine   peccare constanter potest.      Quis mane sumptis nequiter   non erubescit poculis,            30   cum fit libido temperans   castumque nugator sapit?      Nunc, nunc severum vivitur,   nunc nemo tentat ludicrum,   inepta nunc omnes sua             35   vultu colorant serio.      Haec hora cunctis utilis,   qua quisque, quod studet, gerat,   miles, togatus, navita,   opifex, arator, institor.         40      Illum forensis gloria,   hunc triste raptat classicum,   mercator hinc ac rusticus   avara suspirant lucra.      At nos lucelli ac faenoris      45   fandique prorsus nescii,   nec arte fortes bellica,   te, Christe, solum novimus.      Te mente pura et simplici,   te voce, te cantu pio             50   rogare curvato genu   flendo et canendo discimus.      His nos lucramur quaestibus,   hac arte tantum vivimus,   haec inchoamus munera,            55   cum sol resurgens emicat.      Intende nostris sensibus,   vitamque totam dispice,   sunt multa fucis inlita,   quae luce purgentur tua.          60      Durare nos tales iube,   quales, remotis sordibus   nitere pridem iusseras,   Iordane tinctos flumine.      Quodcumque nox mundi dehinc     65   infecit atris nubibus,   tu, rex Eoi sideris,   vultu sereno inlumina.      Tu sancte, qui taetram picem   candore tingis lacteo             70   ebenoque crystallum facis,   delicta terge livida.      Sub nocte Iacob caerula   luctator audax angeli,   eo usque dum lux surgeret,        75   sudavit inpar praelium.      Sed cum iubar claresceret,   lapsante claudus poplite   femurque victus debile   culpae vigorem perdidit.          80      Nutabat inguen saucium,   quae corporis pars vilior   longeque sub cordis loco   diram fovet libidinem.      Hae nos docent imagines,        85   hominem tenebris obsitum,   si forte non cedat Deo,   vires rebellis perdere.      Erit tamen beatior,   intemperans membrum cui           90   luctando claudum et tabidum   dies oborta invenerit.      Tandem facessat caecitas,   quae nosmet in praeceps diu   lapsos sinistris gressibus        95   errore traxit devio.      Haec lux serenum conferat   purosque nos praestet sibi:   nihil loquamur subdolum,   volvamus obscurum nihil.         100      Sic tota decurrat dies,   ne lingua mendax, ne manus,   oculive peccent lubrici,   ne noxa corpus inquinet.      Speculator adstat desuper,     105   qui nos diebus omnibus   actusque nostros prospicit   a luce prima in vesperum.      Hic testis, hic est arbiter,   his intuetur quidquid est,       110   humana quod mens concipit;   hunc nemo fallit iudicem.                                II. MORNING HYMN     Ye clouds and darkness, hosts of night   That breed confusion and affright,   Begone! o'erhead the dawn shines clear,   The light breaks in and Christ is here.    Earth's gloom flees broken and dispersed,   By the sun's piercing shafts coerced:   The daystar's eyes rain influence bright   And colours glimmer back to sight.    So shall our guilty midnight fade,   The sin-stained heart's gross dusky shade:   So shall the King's All-radiant Face   Sudden unveil our deep disgrace.    No longer then may we disguise   Our dark intents from those clear eyes:   Yea, at the dayspring's advent blest   Our inmost thoughts will stand confest.    The thief his hidden traffic plies   Unmarked before the dawn doth rise:   But light, the foe of guile concealed,   Lets no ill craft lie unrevealed.    Fraud and Deceit love only night,   Their wiles they practise out of sight;   Curtained by dark, Adultery too   Doth his foul treachery pursue,    But slinks abashed and shamed away   Soon as the sun rekindles day,   For none can damning light resist   And 'neath its rays in sin persist.    Who doth not blush o'ertook by morn   And his long night's carousal scorn?   For day subdues the lustful soul,   And doth all foul desires control.    Now each to earnest life awakes,   Now each his wanton sport forsakes;   Now foolish things are put away   And gravity resumes her sway.    It is the hour for duty's deeds,   The path to which our labour leads,   Be it the forum, army, sea,   The mart or field or factory.    One seeks the plaudits of the bar,   One the stern trumpet calls to war:   Those bent on trade and husbandry   At greed's behest for lucre sigh.    Mine is no rhetorician's fame,   No petty usury I claim;   Nor am I skilled to face the foe:   'Tis Thou, O Christ, alone I know.    Yea, I have learnt to wait on Thee   With heart and lips of purity,   Humbly my knees in prayer to bend,   And tears with songs of praise to blend.    These are the gains I hold in view   And these the arts that I pursue:   These are the offices I ply   When the bright sun mounts up the sky.    Prove Thou my heart, my every thought,   Search into all that I have wrought:   Though I be stained with blots within,   Thy quickening rays shall purge my sin.    O may I ever spotless be   As when my stains were cleansed by Thee,   Who bad'st me 'neath the Jordan's wave   Of yore my soilëd spirit lave.    If e'er since then the world's gross night   Hath cast its curtain o'er my sight,   Dispel the cloud, O King of grace,   Star of the East! with thy pure face.    Since Thou canst change, O holy Light,   The blackest hue to milky white,   Ebon to clearness crystalline,   Wash my foul stains and make me clean.    'Twas 'neath the lonely star-blue night   That Jacob waged the unequal fight,   Stoutly he wrestled with the Man   In darkness, till the day began.    And when the sun rose in the sky   He halted on his shrivelled thigh:   His natural might had ebbed away,   Vanquished in that tremendous fray.    Not wounded he in nobler part   Nor smitten in life's fount, the heart:   But lust was shaken from his throne   And his foul empire overthrown.    Whereby we clearly learn aright   That man is whelmed by deadly night,   Unless he own God conqueror   And strive against His will no more.    Yet happier he whom rising morn   Shall find of nature's strength forlorn,   Whose warring flesh hath shrunk away,   Palsied by virtue's puissant sway.    And then at length let darkness flee,   Which all too long held us in fee,   'Mid wildering shadows made us stray   And led in devious tracks our way.    We pray Thee, Rising Light serene,   E'en as Thyself our hearts make clean:   Let no deceit our lips defile   Nor let our souls be vexed by guile.    O keep us, as the hours proceed,   From lying word and evil deed,   Our roving eyes from sin set free,   Our body from impurity.    For thou dost from above survey   The converse of each fleeting day:   Thou dost foresee from morning light   Our every deed, until the night.    Justice and judgment dwell with Thee,   Whatever is, Thine eye doth see:   Thou know'st what human hearts conceive   And none Thy wisdom may deceive.                             III.
