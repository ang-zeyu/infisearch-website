For twenty minutes the Coldwater bucked the great seas with her three engines. I doubt if she advanced a foot; but it was enough to keep her nose in the wind, and, at least, we were not drifting toward thirty.  Johnson and Alvarez were at my side when, without warning, the bow swung swiftly around and the ship fell into the trough of the sea.  “The other three have gone,” I said, and I happened to be looking at Johnson as I spoke. Was it the shadow of a satisfied smile that crossed his thin lips? I do not know; but at least he did not weep.  “You always have been curious, sir, about the great unknown beyond thirty,” he said. “You are in a good way to have your curiosity satisfied.” And then I could not mistake the slight sneer that curved his upper lip. There must have been a trace of disrespect in his tone or manner which escaped me, for Alvarez turned upon him like a flash.  “When Lieutenant Turck crosses thirty,” he said, “we shall all cross with him, and God help the officer or the man who reproaches him!”  “I shall not be a party to high treason,” snapped Johnson. “The regulations are explicit, and if the Coldwater crosses thirty it devolves upon you to place Lieutenant Turck under arrest and immediately exert every endeavor to bring the ship back into Pan-American waters.”  “I shall not know,” replied Alvarez, “that the Coldwater passes thirty; nor shall any other man aboard know it,” and, with his words, he drew a revolver from his pocket, and before either I or Johnson could prevent it had put a bullet into every instrument upon the bridge, ruining them beyond repair.  And then he saluted me, and strode from the bridge, a martyr to loyalty and friendship, for, though no man might know that Lieutenant Jefferson Turck had taken his ship across thirty, every man aboard would know that the first officer had committed a crime that was punishable by both degradation and death. Johnson turned and eyed me narrowly.  “Shall I place him under arrest?” he asked.  “You shall not,” I replied. “Nor shall anyone else.”  “You become a party to his crime!” he cried angrily.  “You may go below, Mr. Johnson,” I said, “and attend to the work of unpacking the extra instruments and having them properly set upon the bridge.”  He saluted, and left me, and for some time I stood, gazing out upon the angry waters, my mind filled with unhappy reflections upon the unjust fate that had overtaken me, and the sorrow and disgrace that I had unwittingly brought down upon my house.  I rejoiced that I should leave neither wife nor child to bear the burden of my shame throughout their lives.  As I thought upon my misfortune, I considered more clearly than ever before the unrighteousness of the regulation which was to prove my doom, and in the natural revolt against its injustice my anger rose, and there mounted within me a feeling which I imagine must have paralleled that spirit that once was prevalent among the ancients called anarchy.  For the first time in my life I found my sentiments arraying themselves against custom, tradition, and even government. The wave of rebellion swept over me in an instant, beginning with an heretical doubt as to the sanctity of the established order of things—that fetish which has ruled Pan-Americans for two centuries, and which is based upon a blind faith in the infallibility of the prescience of the long-dead framers of the articles of Pan-American federation—and ending in an adamantine determination to defend my honor and my life to the last ditch against the blind and senseless regulation which assumed the synonymity of misfortune and treason.  I would replace the destroyed instruments upon the bridge; every officer and man should know when we crossed thirty. But then I should assert the spirit which dominated me, I should resist arrest, and insist upon bringing my ship back across the dead line, remaining at my post until we had reached New York. Then I should make a full report, and with it a demand upon public opinion that the dead lines be wiped forever from the seas.  I knew that I was right. I knew that no more loyal officer wore the uniform of the navy. I knew that I was a good officer and sailor, and I didn’t propose submitting to degradation and discharge because a lot of old, preglacial fossils had declared over two hundred years before that no man should cross thirty.  Even while these thoughts were passing through my mind I was busy with the details of my duties. I had seen to it that a sea anchor was rigged, and even now the men had completed their task, and the Coldwater was swinging around rapidly, her nose pointing once more into the wind, and the frightful rolling consequent upon her wallowing in the trough was happily diminishing.  It was then that Johnson came hurrying to the bridge. One of his eyes was swollen and already darkening, and his lip was cut and bleeding. Without even the formality of a salute, he burst upon me, white with fury.  “Lieutenant Alvarez attacked me!” he cried. “I demand that he be placed under arrest. I found him in the act of destroying the reserve instruments, and when I would have interfered to protect them he fell upon me and beat me. I demand that you arrest him!”  “You forget yourself, Mr. Johnson,” I said. “You are not in command of the ship. I deplore the action of Lieutenant Alvarez, but I cannot expunge from my mind the loyalty and self-sacrificing friendship which has prompted him to his acts. Were I you, sir, I should profit by the example he has set. Further, Mr. Johnson, I intend retaining command of the ship, even though she crosses thirty, and I shall demand implicit obedience from every officer and man aboard until I am properly relieved from duty by a superior officer in the port of New York.”  “You mean to say that you will cross thirty without submitting to arrest?” he almost shouted.  “I do, sir,” I replied. “And now you may go below, and, when again you find it necessary to address me, you will please be so good as to bear in mind the fact that I am your commanding officer, and as such entitled to a salute.”  He flushed, hesitated a moment, and then, saluting, turned upon his heel and left the bridge. Shortly after, Alvarez appeared. He was pale, and seemed to have aged ten years in the few brief minutes since I last had seen him. Saluting, he told me very simply what he had done, and asked that I place him under arrest.  I put my hand on his shoulder, and I guess that my voice trembled a trifle as, while reproving him for his act, I made it plain to him that my gratitude was no less potent a force than his loyalty to me. Then it was that I outlined to him my purpose to defy the regulation that had raised the dead lines, and to take my ship back to New York myself.  I did not ask him to share the responsibility with me. I merely stated that I should refuse to submit to arrest, and that I should demand of him and every other officer and man implicit obedience to my every command until we docked at home.  His face brightened at my words, and he assured me that I would find him as ready to acknowledge my command upon the wrong side of thirty as upon the right, an assurance which I hastened to tell him I did not need.  The storm continued to rage for three days, and as far as the wind scarce varied a point during all that time, I knew that we must be far beyond thirty, drifting rapidly east by south. All this time it had been impossible to work upon the damaged engines or the gravity-screen generators; but we had a full set of instruments upon the bridge, for Alvarez, after discovering my intentions, had fetched the reserve instruments from his own cabin, where he had hidden them. Those which Johnson had seen him destroy had been a third set which only Alvarez had known was aboard the Coldwater.  We waited impatiently for the sun, that we might determine our exact location, and upon the fourth day our vigil was rewarded a few minutes before noon.  Every officer and man aboard was tense with nervous excitement as we awaited the result of the reading. The crew had known almost as soon as I that we were doomed to cross thirty, and I am inclined to believe that every man jack of them was tickled to death, for the spirits of adventure and romance still live in the hearts of men of the twenty-second century, even though there be little for them to feed upon between thirty and one hundred seventy-five.  The men carried none of the burdens of responsibility. They might cross thirty with impunity, and doubtless they would return to be heroes at home; but how different the home-coming of their commanding officer!  The wind had dropped to a steady blow, still from west by north, and the sea had gone down correspondingly. The crew, with the exception of those whose duties kept them below, were ranged on deck below the bridge. When our position was definitely fixed I personally announced it to the eager, waiting men.  “Men,” I said, stepping forward to the handrail and looking down into their upturned, bronzed faces, “you are anxiously awaiting information as to the shipl’s position. It has been determined at latitude fifty degrees seven minutes north, longitude twenty degrees sixteen minutes west.”  I paused and a buzz of animated comment ran through the massed men beneath me. “Beyond thirty. But there will be no change in commanding officers, in routine or in discipline, until after we have docked again in New York.”  As I ceased speaking and stepped back from the rail there was a roar of applause from the deck such as I never before had heard aboard a ship of peace. It recalled to my mind tales that I had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14909"],["title","Elsie's New Relations (#1)"],["body","from me. So I shall not punish him. But I am pleased that you should plead for him. I am very glad that my children all love one another.\"  \"Yes, indeed we do, papa!\" she said, \"And we all love you, and you love Max and Gracie very much, and----\"  \"And Lulu also,\" he said, putting his arm about her and drawing her closer to his side, as she paused with quivering lip and downcast eyes.  \"As much as you do Max and Gracie?\" she asked brokenly, hiding her face on his shoulder. \"You said just now I was naughtier than both of them put together.\"  \"Yet you are my own dear child, and it is precisely because I love you so dearly that I am so distressed over your quick temper and wilfulness. I fear that if not conquered they will cause great unhappiness to yourself as well as to your friends. I want you to promise me, daughter, that you will try to conquer them, asking God to help you.\"  \"I will, papa,\" she said, with unwonted humility; \"but, oh, I wish you were going to stay with us! It's easier to be good with you than with anybody else.\"  \"I am sorry, indeed, that I cannot,\" he said, rising and taking her hand. \"Come, we must go back to the house now.\"  They moved along in silence for a little, then Lulu said, with an affectionate look up into her father's face, \"Papa, I do so like to walk this way!\"  \"How do you mean?\" he asked, smiling kindly upon her.  \"With my hand in yours, papa. You know I haven't often had the chance.\"  \"No, my poor child,\" he sighed, \"that is one of the deprivations to which a seaman and his family have to submit.\"  \"Well,\" said the little girl, lifting his hand to her lips, \"I'd rather have you for my father than anybody else, for all that.\"  At that he bent down and kissed her with a smile full of pleasure and fatherly affection.     CHAPTER II.      \"By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou     shalt be condemned.\"--_Matt._ 12:37.   As they drew near the house Max came to meet them.  \"I've been to the post-office since the mail came in, papa,\" he said, \"and there is no government letter for you yet. I'm so glad! I hope they're going to let us keep you a good deal longer.\"  \"I'm not sorry to prolong my stay with wife and children,\" the captain responded, \"but cannot hope to be permitted to do so very much longer.\"  \"Grandpa Dinsmore has come back from taking Harold and Herbert to college,\" pursued Max, \"and we're all to take tea in there, Mamma Vi says; because grandpa wants us all about him this first evening.\"  \"That is kind,\" said the captain, opening the gate and looking smilingly at Violet, who, with little Grace, was waiting for him on the veranda. He stopped there to speak with them, while Lulu hurried on into the house and up to her own room, Max following.  \"Where's my book, Lu?\" he asked.  \"O Max, I couldn't help it--but papa caught me reading it and took it away from me. And he told me when you asked me for it I should send you to him.\"  Max's face expressed both vexation and alarm. \"I sha'n't do that,\" he said, \"if I never get it. But was he very angry, Lu?\"  \"No; and you needn't be afraid to go to him, for he won't punish you; I asked him not to, and he said he wouldn't. But he threw the book into the sea, and said neither you nor I should ever read such poisonous stuff with his knowledge or consent.\"  \"Then, where would be the use of my going to him for it? I'll not say a word about it.\"  He went out, closed the door and stood irresolutely in the hall, debating with himself whether to go up-stairs or down. Up-stairs in his room was another dime novel which he had been reading that afternoon; he had not quite finished it, and was eager to do so; he wanted very much to know how the story ended, and had meant to read the few remaining pages now before the call to tea. But his father's words, reported to him by Lulu, made it disobedience.  \"It's a very little sin,\" whispered the tempter; \"as having read so much, you might as well read the rest.\"  \"But it will be disobeying wilfully the kind father who forgave a heedless act of disobedience not very long ago,\" said conscience; \"the dear father who must soon leave you to be gone no one knows how long, perhaps never to come back.\"  Just then the captain came quickly up the stairs. \"Ah, Max, are you there?\" he said, in a cheery tone, then laying his hand affectionately on the boy's shoulder. \"Come in here with me, my son, I want to have a little talk with you while I make my toilet.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Max, following him into the dressing-room.  \"What have you been reading to-day?\" asked the captain, throwing off his coat, pouring water into the basin from the pitcher, and beginning his ablutions.  Max hung his head in silence till the question was repeated, then stammered out the title of the book, the perusal of which he was so desirous to finish.  \"Where did you get it?\" asked his father.  \"I bought it at a news-stand, papa.\"  \"You must not buy anything more of that kind, Max; you must not read any such trash.\"  \"I will not again, papa; I should not this time if you had ever forbidden me before.\"  \"No, I don't believe you would be guilty of wilful disobedience to any positive command of your father,\" the captain said in a grave but kindly tone; \"and yet I think you suspected I would not approve, else why were you so unwilling to tell me what you had been reading?\"  He was standing before the bureau now, hairbrush in hand, and as he spoke he paused in his work, and gazed searchingly at his son.  Max's face flushed hotly, and his eyes drooped for a moment, then looking up into his father's face he said frankly, \"Yes, papa, I believe I was afraid you would take the book from me if you saw it. I deserve that you should be angry with me for that and for lending one to Lu.\"  \"I am displeased with you on both accounts,\" the captain replied, \"but I shall overlook it this time, my son, hoping there will be no repetition of either offence. Now go to your room, gather up all the doubtful reading matter you have, and bring it here to me. I shall not go with you, but trust to your honor to keep nothing back.\"  \"Oh, thank you, papa, for trusting me!\" cried Max, his countenance brightening wonderfully, and he hastened away to do his father's bidding.  \"Just the dearest, kindest father that ever was!\" he said to himself, as he bounded up the stairs. \"I'll never do anything again to vex him, if I can help it.\"  He was down again in a moment with two dime novels and a story-paper of the same stamp.  The captain had finished his toilet. Seating himself he took what Max had brought, and glancing hastily over it, \"How much of this trash have you read, Max?\" he asked.  \"The paper and most of one book, papa. I'll not read any more such, since you've forbidden me; but they're very interesting, papa.\"  \"I dare say, to a boy of your age. But you don't think I would want to deprive you of any innocent pleasure, Max?\"  \"No, sir; oh, no! But may I know why you won't let me read such stories?\"  \"Yes; it is because they give false views of life, and thus lead to wrong and foolish actions. Why, Max, some boys have been made burglars and highwaymen by such stories. I want you to be a reader, but of good and wholesome literature; books that will give you useful information and good moral teachings; above all things, my son, I would have you a student of the Bible, 'the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith which is in Jesus Christ.' Do you read it often, Max?\"  \"Not very, papa. But you know I hear you read it every morning and evening.\"  \"Yes; but I have sometimes been grieved to see that you paid very little attention.\"  Max colored at that. \"Papa, I will try to do better,\" he said.  \"I hope you will,\" said his father. \"You will enjoy the same religious advantages at Ion, and, my boy, try to profit by them, remembering that we shall have to render an account at last of the use or abuse of all our privileges. I want you to promise me that you will read a few verses of the Bible every day, and commit at least one to memory.\"  \"I will, papa. And what else shall I read? You will let me have some story-books, won't you?\" Max said, entreatingly.  \"Yes,\" said his father, \"I have no objection to stories of the right sort. There are some very beautiful stories in the Bible; there are entertaining stories in history; and there are fictitious stories that will do you good and not harm. I shall take care in future that you have plenty of wholesome mental food, so that you will have no excuse for craving such stuff as this,\" he added, with a glance of disgust at what he held in his hand. \"It may go into the kitchen fire.\"  \"Mrs. Scrimp never burns the least little bit of paper, papa,\" said Max.  \"Indeed! Why not?\" asked his father, with an amused smile.  \"She says it is wicked waste, because it is better than rags for the paper-makers.\"  \"Ah! well, then, we will tear these into bits and let them go to the paper-makers.\"  Max was standing by his father's side. \"Papa,\" he said, with a roguish look into his father's face, \"don't you think you would enjoy reading them first?\"  The captain laughed. \"No, my son,\" he said; \"I have not the slightest inclination to read them. Bring me that waste basket and you may help me tear them up.\"  They began the work of destruction, Max taking the paper, the captain the book his son had been reading. Presently something in it attracted his attention; he paused and glanced over several pages one after the other, till Max began to think he had become interested in the story. But no; at that instant he turned from it to him, and Max was half frightened at the sternness of his look.  \"My son,\" he said, \"I am astonished and deeply grieved that you could read and enjoy anything like this, for it is full of profanity; and reading or hearing such expressions is very likely to lead to the use of them. Max, do you ever say such words?\"  Max trembled and grew red and pale by turns, but"]]]
