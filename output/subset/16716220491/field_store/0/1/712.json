If, however, we have tabulated the inflections of the language, and stated what syntax is the most used in certain troublesome places, there is still much for the grammarian to do.  [Sidenote: _A broader view_.]  Surely our noble language, with its enormous vocabulary, its peculiar and abundant idioms, its numerous periphrastic forms to express every possible shade of meaning, is worthy of serious study, apart from the mere memorizing of inflections and formulation of rules.  [Sidenote: _Mental training. An æsthetic benefit._]  Grammar is eminently a means of mental training; and while it will train the student in subtle and acute reasoning, it will at the same time, if rightly presented, lay the foundation of a keen observation and a correct literary taste. The continued contact with the highest thoughts of the best minds will create a thirst for the \"well of English undefiled.\"  [Sidenote: _What grammar is_.]  Coming back, then, from the question, _What ground should grammar cover?_ we come to answer the question, _What should grammar teach?_ and we give as an answer the definition,--  _English grammar is the science which treats of the nature of words, their forms, and their uses and relations in the sentence_.  [Sidenote: _The work it will cover._]  This will take in the usual divisions, \"The Parts of Speech\" (with their inflections), \"Analysis,\" and \"Syntax.\" It will also require a discussion of any points that will clear up difficulties, assist the classification of kindred expressions, or draw the attention of the student to everyday idioms and phrases, and thus incite his observation.  [Sidenote: _Authority as a basis_.]  A few words here as to the _authority_ upon which grammar rests.  [Sidenote: _Literary English_.]  The statements given will be substantiated by quotations from the leading or \"standard\" literature of modern times; that is, from the eighteenth century on. This _literary English_ is considered the foundation on which grammar must rest.  [Sidenote: _Spoken English_.]  Here and there also will be quoted words and phrases from _spoken_ or _colloquial English_, by which is meant the free, unstudied expressions of ordinary conversation and communication among intelligent people.  These quotations will often throw light on obscure constructions, since they preserve turns of expressions that have long since perished from the literary or standard English.  [Sidenote: _Vulgar English_.]  Occasionally, too, reference will be made to _vulgar English,_--the speech of the uneducated and ignorant,--which will serve to illustrate points of syntax once correct, or standard, but now undoubtedly bad grammar.  The following pages will cover, then, three divisions:--  Part I. The Parts of Speech, and Inflections.  Part II. Analysis of Sentences.  Part III. The Uses of Words, or Syntax.      PART I.  _THE PARTS OF SPEECH_.     NOUNS.   1. In the more simple _state_ of the _Arabs_, the _nation_ is free, because each of her _sons_ disdains a base _submission_ to the _will_ of a _master_.--GIBBON.  [Sidenote: _Name words_]  By examining this sentence we notice several words used as names. The plainest name is _Arabs_, which belongs to a people; but, besides this one, the words _sons_ and _master_ name objects, and may belong to any of those objects. The words _state, submission,_ and _will_ are evidently names of a different kind, as they stand for ideas, not objects; and the word _nation_ stands for a whole group.  When the meaning of each of these words has once been understood, the word naming it will always call up the thing or idea itself. Such words are called nouns.   [Sidenote: _Definition_.]  2. A noun is a name word, representing directly to the mind an object, substance, or idea.   [Sidenote: _Classes of nouns_.]  3. Nouns are classified as follows:--  (1) Proper.  (2) Common.     (a) CLASS NAMES:  i.  Individual.                                   ii. Collective.                 (b) MATERIAL.  (3) Abstract.   (a) ATTRIBUTE.                 (b) VERBAL   [Sidenote: _Names for special objects._]  4. A proper noun is a name applied to a particular object, whether person, place, or thing.  It specializes or limits the thing to which it is applied, reducing it to a narrow application. Thus, _city_ is a word applied to any one of its kind; but _Chicago_ names one city, and fixes the attention upon that particular city. _King_ may be applied to any ruler of a kingdom, but _Alfred the Great_ is the name of one king only.  The word _proper_ is from a Latin word meaning _limited, belonging to one_. This does not imply, however, that a proper name can be applied to only one object, but that each time such a name is applied it is fixed or proper to that object. Even if there are several Bostons or Manchesters, the name of each is an individual or proper name.   [Sidenote: _Name for any individual of a class._]  5. A common noun is a name possessed by _any_ one of a class of persons, animals, or things.  _Common_, as here used, is from a Latin word which means _general, possessed by all_.  For instance, _road_ is a word that names _any_ highway outside of cities; _wagon_ is a term that names _any_ vehicle of a certain kind used for hauling: the words are of the widest application. We may say, _the man here_, or _the man in front of you_, but the word _man_ is here hedged in by other words or word groups: the name itself is of general application.  [Sidenote: _Name for a group or collection of objects._]  Besides considering persons, animals, and things separately, we may think of them in groups, and appropriate names to the groups.  Thus, men in groups may be called a _crowd_, or a _mob_, a _committee_, or a _council_, or a _congress_, etc.  These are called COLLECTIVE NOUNS. They properly belong under common nouns, because each group is considered as a unit, and the name applied to it belongs to any group of its class.   [Sidenote: _Names for things thought of in mass._]  6. The definition given for common nouns applies more strictly to class nouns. It may, however, be correctly used for another group of nouns detailed below; for they are common nouns in the sense that the names apply to _every particle of similar substance_, instead of to each individual or separate object.  They are called MATERIAL NOUNS. Such are _glass_, _iron_, _clay_, _frost_, _rain_, _snow_, _wheat_, _wine_, _tea_, _sugar_, etc.  They may be placed in groups as follows:--  (1) The metals: _iron_, _gold_, _platinum_, etc.  (2) Products spoken of in bulk: _tea_, _sugar_, _rice_, _wheat_, etc.  (3) Geological bodies: _mud_, _sand_, _granite_, _rock_, _stone_, etc.  (4) Natural phenomena: _rain_, _dew_, _cloud_, _frost_, _mist_, etc.  (5) Various manufactures: _cloth_ (and the different kinds of cloth), _potash_, _soap_, _rubber_, _paint_, _celluloid_, etc.  7. NOTE.--There are some nouns, such as _sun_, _moon_, _earth_, which seem to be the names of particular individual objects, but which are not called proper names.  [Sidenote: _Words naturally of limited application not proper._]  The reason is, that in proper names the intention is _to exclude_ all other individuals of the same class, and fasten a special name to the object considered, as in calling a city _Cincinnati_; but in the words _sun_, _earth_, etc., there is no such intention. If several bodies like the center of our solar system are known, they also are called _suns_ by a natural extension of the term: so with the words _earth_, _world_, etc. They remain common class names.   [Sidenote: _Names of ideas, not things._]  8. Abstract nouns are names of qualities, conditions, or actions, considered abstractly, or apart from their natural connection.  When we speak of a _wise man_, we recognize in him an attribute or quality. If we wish to think simply of that quality without describing the person, we speak of the _wisdom_ of the man. The quality is still there as much as before, but it is taken merely as a name. So _poverty_ would express the condition of a poor person; _proof_ means the act of proving, or that which shows a thing has been proved; and so on.  Again, we may say, \"_Painting_ is a fine art,\" \"_Learning_ is hard to acquire,\" \"a man of _understanding_.\"   9. There are two chief divisions of abstract nouns:--  (1) ATTRIBUTE NOUNS, expressing attributes or qualities.  (2) VERBAL NOUNS, expressing state, condition, or action.   [Sidenote: _Attribute abstract nouns._]  10. The ATTRIBUTE ABSTRACT NOUNS are derived from adjectives and from common nouns. Thus, (1) _prudence_ from _prudent_, _height_ from _high_, _redness_ from _red_, _stupidity_ from _stupid_, etc.; (2) _peerage_ from _peer_, _childhood_ from _child_, _mastery_ from _master_, _kingship_ from _king_, etc.    [Sidenote: _Verbal abstract nouns._]  II. The VERBAL ABSTRACT NOUNS Originate in verbs, as their name implies. They may be--  (1) Of the same form as the simple verb. The verb, by altering its function, is used as a noun; as in the expressions, \"a long _run_\" \"a bold _move_,\" \"a brisk _walk_.\"  (2) Derived from verbs by changing the ending or adding a suffix: _motion_ from _move_, _speech_ from _speak_, _theft_ from _thieve_, _action_ from _act_, _service_ from _serve_.  [Sidenote: _Caution._]  (3) Derived from verbs by adding _-ing_ to the simple verb. It must be remembered that these words are _free from any verbal function_. They cannot govern a word, and they cannot _express_ action, but are merely _names_ of actions. They are only the husks of verbs, and are to be rigidly distinguished from _gerunds_ (Secs. 272, 273).  To avoid difficulty, study carefully these examples:  The best thoughts and _sayings_ of the Greeks; the moon caused fearful _forebodings_; in the _beginning_ of his life; he spread his _blessings_ over the land; the great Puritan _awakening_; our birth is but a sleep and a _forgetting_; a _wedding_ or a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14006"],["title","An English Grammar (#2)"],["body","stival; the rude _drawings_ of the book; masterpieces of the Socratic _reasoning_; the _teachings_ of the High Spirit; those opinions and _feelings_; there is time for such _reasonings_; the _well-being_ of her subjects; her _longing_ for their favor; _feelings_ which their original _meaning_ will by no means justify; the main _bearings_ of this matter.   [Sidenote: _Underived abstract nouns._]  12. Some abstract nouns were not derived from any other part of speech, but were framed directly for the expression of certain ideas or phenomena. Such are _beauty_, _joy_, _hope_, _ease_, _energy_; _day_, _night_, _summer_, _winter_; _shadow_, _lightning_, _thunder_, etc.  The adjectives or verbs corresponding to these are either themselves derived from the nouns or are totally different words; as _glad_--_joy_, _hopeful_--_hope_, etc.    Exercises.  1. From your reading bring up sentences containing ten common nouns, five proper, five abstract.  --NOTE.--Remember that all sentences are to be _selected_ from standard literature.  2. Under what class of nouns would you place (_a_) the names of diseases, as _pneumonia_, _pleurisy_, _catarrh_, _typhus_, _diphtheria_; (_b_) branches of knowledge, as _physics_, _algebra_, _geology_, _mathematics_?  3. Mention collective nouns that will embrace groups of each of the following individual nouns:--    man   horse   bird   fish   partridge   pupil   bee   soldier   book   sailor   child   sheep   ship   ruffian  4. Using a dictionary, tell from what word each of these abstract nouns is derived:--    sight   speech   motion   pleasure   patience   friendship   deceit   bravery   height   width   wisdom   regularity   advice   seizure   nobility   relief   death   raid   honesty   judgment   belief   occupation   justice   service   trail   feeling   choice   simplicity   SPECIAL USES OF NOUNS.   [Sidenote: _Nouns change by use._]  13. By being used so as to vary their usual meaning, nouns of one class may be made to approach another class, or to go over to it entirely. Since words alter their meaning so rapidly by a widening or narrowing of their application, we shall find numerous examples of this shifting from class to class; but most of them are in the following groups. For further discussion see the remarks on articles (p. 119).   [Sidenote: _Proper names transferred to common use._]  14. Proper nouns are used as common in either of two ways:--  (1) _The origin of a thing is used for the thing itself_: that is, the name of the inventor may be applied to the thing invented, as a _davy_, meaning the miner's lamp invented by Sir Humphry Davy; the _guillotine_, from the name of Dr. Guillotin, who was its inventor. Or the name of the country or city from which an article is derived is used for the article: as _china_, from China; _arras_, from a town in France; _port_ (wine), from Oporto, in Portugal; _levant_ and _morocco_ (leather).  Some of this class have become worn by use so that at present we can scarcely discover the derivation from the form of the word; for example, the word _port_, above. Others of similar character are _calico_, from Calicut; _damask_, from Damascus; _currants_, from Corinth; etc.  (2) _The name of a person or place noted for certain qualities is transferred to any person or place possessing those qualities_; thus,--       Hercules and Samson were noted for their strength, and we call a      very strong man _a Hercules_ or _a Samson_. Sodom was famous for      wickedness, and a similar place is called _a Sodom_ of sin.       _A Daniel_ come to judgment!--SHAKESPEARE.       If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power, _a Locke_, _a      Lavoisier_, _a Hutton_, _a Bentham_, _a Fourier_, it imposes its      classification on other men, and lo! a new system.--EMERSON.   [Sidenote: _Names for things in bulk altered for separate portions._]  15. Material nouns may be used as class names. Instead of considering the whole body of material of which certain uses are made, one can speak of particular uses or phases of the substance; as--  (1) _Of individual objects_ made from metals or other substances capable of being wrought into various shapes. We know a number of objects made of iron. The material _iron_ embraces the metal contained in them all; but we may say, \"The cook made the _irons_ hot,\" referring to flat-irons; or, \"The sailor was put in _irons_\" meaning chains of iron. So also we may speak of _a glass_ to drink from or to look into; _a steel_ to whet a knife on; _a rubber_ for erasing marks; and so on.  (2) _Of classes_ or _kinds_ of the same substance. These are the same in material, but differ in strength, purity, etc. Hence it shortens speech to make the nouns plural, and say _teas_, _tobaccos_, _paints_, _oils_, _candies_, _clays_, _coals_.  (3) _By poetical use_, of certain words necessarily singular in idea, which are made plural, or used as class nouns, as in the following:--       The lone and level _sands_ stretch far away.--SHELLEY.                            From all around--      Earth and her _waters_, and the depths of air--      Comes a still voice.--BRYANT.                            Their airy ears      _The winds_ have stationed on the mountain peaks.      --PERCIVAL.  (4) _Of detached portions_ of matter used as class names; as _stones_, _slates_, _papers_, _tins_, _clouds_, _mists_, etc.   [Sidenote: _Personification of abstract ideas._]  16. Abstract nouns are frequently used as proper names by being personified; that is, the ideas are spoken of as residing in living beings. This is a poetic usage, though not confined to verse.       Next _Anger_ rushed; his eyes, on fire,       In lightnings owned his secret stings.--COLLINS.       _Freedom's_ fame finds wings on every wind.--BYRON.       _Death_, his mask melting like a nightmare dream, smiled.--HAYNE.       _Traffic_ has lain down to rest; and only _Vice_ and _Misery_, to      prowl or to moan like night birds, are abroad.--CARLYLE.   [Sidenote: _A halfway class of words. Class nouns in use, abstract in meaning._]  17. Abstract nouns are made half abstract by being spoken of in the plural.  They are not then pure abstract nouns, nor are they common class nouns. For example, examine this:--       The _arts_ differ from the _sciences_ in this, that their power      is founded not merely on _facts_ which can be communicated, but      on _dispositions_ which require to be created.--RUSKIN.  When it is said that _art_ differs from _science_, that the power of art is founded on _fact_, that _disposition_ is the thing to be created, the words italicized are pure abstract nouns; but in case _an art_ or _a science_, or _the arts_ and _sciences_, be spoken of, the abstract idea is partly lost. The words preceded by the article _a_, or made plural, are still names of abstract ideas, not material things; but they widen the application to separate kinds of _art_ or different branches of _science_. They are neither class nouns nor pure abstract nouns: they are more properly called _half abstract_.  Test this in the following sentences:--       Let us, if we must have great _actions_, make our own      so.--EMERSON.       And still, as each repeated _pleasure_ tired, Succeeding _sports_      the mirthful band inspired.--GOLDSMITH.       But ah! those _pleasures_, _loves_, and _joys_         Which I too keenly taste,      The Solitary can despise.--BURNS.       All these, however, were mere _terrors_ of the night.--IRVING.   [Sidenote: _By ellipses, nouns used to modify._]  18. Nouns used as descriptive terms. Sometimes a noun is attached to another noun to add to its meaning, or describe it; for example, \"a _family_ quarrel,\" \"a _New York_ bank,\" \"the _State Bank Tax_ bill,\" \"a _morning_ walk.\"  It is evident that these approach very near to the function of adjectives. But it is better to consider them as nouns, for these reasons: they do not give up their identity as nouns; they do not express quality; they cannot be compared, as descriptive adjectives are.  They are more like the possessive noun, which belongs to another word, but is still a noun. They may be regarded as elliptical expressions, meaning a walk _in the morning_, a bank _in New York_, a bill _as to tax on the banks_, etc.  NOTE.--If the descriptive word be a _material_ noun, it may be regarded as changed to an adjective. The term \"_gold_ pen\" conveys the same idea as \"_golden_ pen,\" which contains a pure adjective.   WORDS AND WORD GROUPS USED AS NOUNS.  [Sidenote: _The noun may borrow from any part of speech, or from any expression._]  19. Owing to the scarcity of distinctive forms, and to the consequent flexibility of English speech, words which are usually other parts of speech are often used as nouns; and various word groups may take the place of nouns by being used as nouns.  [Sidenote: _Adjectives, Conjunctions, Adverbs._]  (1) _Other parts of speech_ used as nouns:--       _The great_, _the wealthy_, fear thy blow.--BURNS.       Every _why_ hath a _wherefore_.--SHAKESPEARE.       When I was young? Ah, woeful _When_!      Ah! for the change 'twixt _Now_ and _Then_!      --COLERIDGE.  (2) _Certain word groups_ used like single nouns:--       _Too swift_ arrives as tardy as _too slow_.--SHAKESPEARE.       Then comes the \"_Why, sir_!\" and the \"_What then, sir_?\" and the      \"_No, sir_!\" and the \"_You don't see your way through the      question, sir_!\"--MACAULAY  (3) Any part of speech may be considered merely as a word, without reference to its function in the sentence; also titles of books are treated as simple nouns.       The _it_, at the beginning, is ambiguous, whether it mean the sun      or the cold.--Dr BLAIR       In this definition, is the word \"_just_,\" or \"_legal_,\" finally      to stand?--RUSKIN.       There was also a book of Defoe's called an \"_Essay on Projects_,\"      and another of Dr. Mather's called \"_Essays to do Good_.\"--B.      FRANKLIN.   [Sidenote: _Caution._]  20.
