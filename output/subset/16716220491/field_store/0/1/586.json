In her esteem he had already distanced all competitors; no one else could plan a house so well for comfort, convenience, and beauty combined. Also he was to her the very embodiment of all that was unselfish, good, and noble.  She thought, and truly, that her mother failed to appreciate him.  While Evelyn waited the doctor subjected his patient to a thorough examination, not only feeling his pulse, listening to the beating of his heart, sounding his lungs and looking at his tongue, but cross-questioning him closely, his face growing graver with every reply elicited.  \"You have told me everything?\" he inquired at length.  \"Yes, I think so; every symptom that I can recall at this moment. And now, doctor, I want you to be equally frank with me; tell me exactly what you think of my case.\"  \"I cannot hold out any hope of recovery,\" was the unwilling reply; \"but there is little, if any, immediate danger.\"  \"You but confirm my own impressions,\" said Mr. Leland quietly. \"But I would have a clearer understanding of your verdict; do you mean that I may have years of invalidism before me, or that a few weeks or months must bring the end?\"  \"You really desire to know the worst, my dear sir?\" returned the physician inquiringly, a look of deep sympathy on his kindly face.  \"I do,\" was the calmly resolute reply; \"let me know the worst and face it in the strength God gives to His children according to their day.\"  \"Then, my dear sir, I will be plain with you; but bear in mind that I lay no claim to infallibility; I may err in judgment, but I see no reason to hope that your life on earth will be prolonged for more than three months at the farthest, and I much fear the end may come in less than half that time.\"  The doctor could not at first judge of the full effect of his words, for Mr. Leland sat with his face half hidden in his hand.  For a moment a deathlike stillness reigned in the room; then Dr. Taylor said, low and feelingly, \"You are a Christian, my dear sir, and for you dying will be but going home to a brighter and better world.\"  \"Yes,\" was the reply, \"and your tidings would have no terrors for me were it not--for those who must be left behind; but oh, the parting from helpless dear ones for whom my care and protection seems so necessary!--that is the bitterness of death!\"  \"'Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in Me,'\" quoted the physician in sympathizing tones.  \"Yes, yes; thank God for that precious promise!\" exclaimed Mr. Leland. \"And you, doctor, for reminding me of it,\" he added, stretching out a hand to his kind comforter.  It was taken in a warm grasp and held for a moment while other of the many sweet and comforting promises of God's Word were recalled to the mind of the sufferer, to his great consolation.  \"I would it were in my power,\" the doctor said at length, \"to hold out to you any hope of restoration to health. I cannot do that, but will write you a prescription which will, I trust, by God's blessing, give relief to some of the most distressing symptoms.\"  \"Even partial relief will be most welcome,\" sighed the patient. \"Ah, if I can but find strength for promised work!\"  \"Better let it alone and take what rest and ease you can,\" was the parting advice of the physician.  \"What a long, long visit the doctor is paying!\" Evelyn had said to herself several times before her eyes were gladdened with the sight of his carriage rolling away down the drive.  \"At last!\" she cried, springing to her feet and hurrying back to the house.  She found her father lying on a sofa, his face very pale, his eyes closed.  She drew near on tiptoe, thinking he might have fallen asleep; but as she reached the side of his couch he opened his eyes, and taking her hand drew her down to his breast.  \"My darling, my beloved child!\" he whispered, putting his arm about her and holding her fast with tender caresses.  \"What did the doctor say, papa?\" she asked, nestling closer to him and laying her cheek to his. \"Does he hope to make you well very soon?\"  For a moment there was no reply, and Evelyn, startled at her father's silence, suddenly raised her head and gazed earnestly, inquiringly into his face.  He smiled, a little sadly, and gently smoothing her hair back from her forehead, \"I was thinking,\" he said, \"of a text in the psalm we read together this morning--'My soul, wait thou only upon God, for my expectation is from him.' He and He only can make me well, daughter.\"  \"Then why send for the doctor, papa?\"  \"Because God works by means; it pleases Him so to do, though it would be no more difficult to Him to accomplish His designs without. He has provided remedies, and I think it is His will that we should use them, at the same time asking His blessing upon them, feeling that without it they will be of no avail.\"  \"Then you are to have some medicine, I suppose?\"  \"Yes; and to be out a good deal in the open air.\"  \"Oh, then, won't you come out to the summer-house and lie in the hammock there, with me close beside you to wait on you?\"  \"Presently; but I must write a letter first,\" he said, putting her gently aside and resuming his seat at the writing-table.  \"Can't it wait till to-morrow, papa?\" she asked. \"You may feel stronger by then.\"  \"It is to be only a few lines, to your Uncle Lester; and I want it to go by this afternoon's mail, that, if possible, it may reach Fairview before they have arranged their plans for the summer. I want them to come here to spend the hot months. Should you like it?\"  \"Yes, indeed, papa! I've always been fond of Uncle Lester, as you know, and I quite fell in love with Aunt Elsie and the baby when he brought them to see us on their return from Europe.\"     CHAPTER II.  \"How sudden do our prospects vary here!\"   It was the breakfast-hour at Fairview. The young husband and wife chatted pleasantly over their coffee, omelet and rolls, strawberries and cream, the principal subject of discourse being the expected trip to Nantucket in company with her mother, grandparents, and the rest of the family at Ion.  Lester and his Elsie had been there the previous evening, helping to celebrate the first anniversary of the marriage of Edward and Zoe, and had readily fallen in with the plans for the summer outing proposed by Captain Raymond.  \"You will go with us, of course, Elsie?\" their mother had said, several of the others eagerly echoing her words, and they had answered that they knew of nothing to hinder, and should be delighted to do so.  So that question seemed fully settled, and now their talk was of needful preparations and arrangements for so long an absence from home; of the anticipated pleasures of the voyage and the proposed lengthened sojourn upon Nantucket Island, including the sketching of the most attractive features of its scenery.  Young, healthy, in easy circumstances, entirely congenial in opinions and tastes, they were a very happy couple.  Lester was meeting with marked success in his chosen profession--had received only yesterday a large price for one of his paintings; and as Elsie and he were essentially one in all their interests, her joy was fully equal to his, if not greater.  In consequence they were unusually gay this morning, and life seemed very bright and beautiful before them.  They lingered over their meal, and were just leaving the table when a servant came in with the morning's mail.  There were several newspapers and magazines; only one letter.  \"From Eric, dear old boy! I was intending to write to him to-day,\" remarked Lester, as he examined the superscription.  \"How nice, then, that his came just in time for you to answer it in yours,\" said Elsie. \"I'll leave you to the enjoyment of it while I give my orders for the day,\" she added, turning from him toward the rear of the house, as they left the breakfast-room together.  \"Yes, my dear, and when you have a spare moment to bestow upon your unworthy husband, you will find him on the veranda,\" he answered lightly, bending his steps in that direction.  Only a few minutes had passed when she sought him there; but what a change had come over him! All his gayety had forsaken him, his face was pale, and his eyes, as he turned them upon her, were full of anguish.  \"Oh Lester, my dear, dear husband! what is it?\" she cried, hastening to him and laying a hand tenderly upon his shoulder.  \"Read,\" he said hoarsely, holding out the open letter to her,--Eric's letter, whose sad tidings seemed for the time to have driven away all the joy and brightness of life.  Glancing down the page, Elsie read:  \"My dear brother, will you come to me? I have sore need of you. For a year past I have felt my strength failing; for the last few months matters have grown worse, till my days and nights are filled with pain and unrest; and today I have learned that the time has come for me to set my house in order, for I am to 'die, and not live.' Nay, not so: I am to pass from the land of the dying to that blest world where death can never enter.  \"My physician tells me it may possibly be three months ere I reach 'that bourne whence no traveller returns,' but that in all probability I shall arrive there in less than half that time.  \"And there is much I would say to you, my brother; much in which I need your kind help. You will be coming North for the hot season; I would gladly have you, your sweet wife and baby-boy spend it here with us; and to me it seems that there are few pleasanter places than this little home-nest of ours high up on the rocky banks of the grand old Hudson River. We have pure air and magnificent scenery, and it will be most comforting to me to have your loved companionship as I go down into the valley of the shadow of death.  \"Thank God, it is only the shadow, and I shall go down into it leaning on the strong arm of my beloved. Jesus will be with me to the very end.  \"But I may be asking too"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13379"],["title","The Two Elsies (#2)"],["body","of my sweet sister Elsie; you and she have, perchance, formed other plans more congenial to your tastes and wishes. If so, let me not interfere with them; consider my request withdrawn. Yet, shall I not have at least a sight of your loved faces ere I go hence to return no more?  \"Lovingly, ERIC.\"  Elsie could scarce see the signature from the fast-falling tears.  \"The dear brother!\" she sobbed. \"But, oh, Lester, be comforted! His troubles and trials are almost over, the battle nearly ended, the victory well-nigh won; and we know he will come off more than conqueror through Him that loved him!\"  \"Yes, I know, I know it; but he has been a dear brother to me, and, oh, how can I learn to live without him!\" he answered, in tones quivering with emotion.  \"'Twill only be for a time, love, and then you will be restored to each other, never to part any more forever,\" Elsie said softly, with her arm about her husband's neck, while her tears mingled with his, and her sweet lips were pressed again and again to his cheek.  He folded her in a close embrace.  \"My dear, sweet, precious comforter,\" he said, \"I can never be unhappy while God spares me my wife.\"  \"Nor I, while I have you, dearest,\" she responded, with an added caress. \"And we will go to poor Eric instead of with mamma and the rest to Nantucket.\"  \"My sweet one, I could not ask so great a sacrifice from you,\" he said.  \"I can hardly feel it to be such when I think of your poor brother--our brother; for is he not mine also? We will go to him instead, and I know it will be with mamma's approval, grandpa's also. Ah, here they both come!\" she exclaimed, in a tone of satisfaction, as the Ion family carriage was seen approaching through the avenue.  In another moment it had drawn up before the entrance, and Mr. Dinsmore and his daughter alighted. With the quick eye of affection the mother at once noted the sadness of her daughter's countenance, of Lester's also, and scarcely had she exchanged the morning greetings with them ere she inquired the cause.  Lester silently handed her Eric's open letter.  Tears trembled in the soft brown eyes as she read.  In compliance with a mute request from Lester, she passed it on to her father.  There was a moment of silence after Mr. Dinsmore had finished reading, then the elder Elsie said in low, sympathizing tones,  \"My dears, you will go to him? Delightful as it would be to have you with us, I could not wish you to refuse such a request from one so near and dear.\"  \"No, mamma dear, nor could we think of refusing,\" answered her daughter, quickly, glancing tenderly at her husband as she spoke, and receiving a grateful, loving look in return.  \"Certainly not,\" said Mr. Dinsmore; \"but I see no reason why you should not accompany us on our voyage, spend a few days at Nantucket, and then go on to New York. Do you, Lester?\"  \"No, sir; and if my little wife approves of that plan, we will adopt it,\"  He turned inquiringly to her.  \"I should like it very much,\" she said. \"If you are quite sure it will not delay us too long,\" she added as an after-thought.  \"No, scarcely at all, I think,\" returned Lester; \"so we will consider that settled.\"  \"Ah, I am glad that we shall not lose your company altogether,\" Mrs. Travilla said. \"And do not despair for your brother, Lester, for many very sick people have recovered, even after being given up by the doctors. We know, too, that with God nothing is impossible, and that He is the hearer and answerer of prayer. We will unite our petitions in behalf of Eric, and if it shall be for God's glory and his good, he will be restored to health.\"  \"Yes, mother; I have not a doubt of that,\" returned Mr. Leland, \"nor of my dear brother's safety in any case. He is one who has lived the life of a Christian for years, and I am sure dying grace will be given him for dying time--whenever that shall come.\"  \"And well may you be,\" said Mrs. Travilla, \"for not one of all God's promises ever fails, and to each of His children He has said, 'As thy days, so shall thy strength be.'\"  \"If you want to answer your letter by return of mail, Lester, do not let us hinder you,\" said Mr. Dinsmore. \"We are going to the village presently, and will mail it for you, if you like.\"  \"Thank you; then I shall write at once,\" Lester replied, as he rose and left them.  \"This change of plan will involve some change in your intended preparations, will it not, Elsie?\" asked Mrs. Travilla.  \"Not very much, mamma, as we are not likely to take part in any gayeties. I shall not need to have any new dresses made; indeed, I think I have already a full supply of everything necessary or desirable, in the way of dress, for both baby and myself.\"  \"Then you will be ready for the trip as soon as any of us?\" her grandfather said inquiringly.  \"Yes, sir; I could pack to-day and start this evening if desired to do so,\" she answered with a smile.  \"We will not put you to the test,\" he said, \"but we hope to sail next Tuesday.\"     CHAPTER III.  \"We all do fade as a leaf.\" (Is. lxiv. 6.)   A fortnight had passed since the day of the reader's introduction to the dwellers in Crag Cottage; the June roses were blooming about it in even richer profusion than before; tree, and shrub and vine were laden with denser foliage; the place looked a very bower of beauty to the eyes of Lester and his Elsie as the hack which had brought them from the nearest steamboat-landing slowly wound its way up the hill on which the cottage stood.  On the vine-covered porch Eric lay in a hammock, his little daughter, as usual, by his side.  Though losing flesh and strength day by day, he still persevered with his work; had spent some hours over it this morning, but was resting now, his cheek fanned by the pure, sweet air from the mountain and river, his eyes now feasting upon the beauties of the surrounding scenery, and anon turning with fond, fatherly affection upon the face of the child he loved so well.  She was proving herself an excellent nurse for one of her age; never weary of waiting upon her loved patient, always striving to anticipate his every want, and doing her best to entertain him and make him forget his pain.  She was talking of their expected guests.  \"I am so glad they are coming, papa,\" she said, \"for I hope it will cheer you and do you much good to see your brother.\"  \"And sister,\" he added with a faint smile; \"your Aunt Elsie is a very lovely and interesting woman.\"  \"Yes, but I hope they will let me have my father to myself sometimes,\" she said, laying her cheek lovingly against the hand that was clasping hers. \"I'm hardly willing to share you even with Uncle Lester.\"  \"No, not all the time,\" he responded; \"we must have an hour alone together now and then. I should not like to be deprived of it any more than you.\"  She had lifted her head, and was gazing toward the river. \"Papa, I think they are here!\" she exclaimed. \"There is a carriage coming up the drive.\"  \"Ah, I hope so,\" he said, his pale cheek flushing with pleasure; and excitement lending him momentary strength, he hastily stepped from the hammock, and with Evelyn went forward to greet and welcome the travellers as they alighted, the hack having now drawn up before the entrance.  Both Lester and Elsie were much moved at sight of their brother--so sadly changed from the vigorous man from whom they parted less than a year before.  Elsie had much ado to hide her emotion, and even Lester's voice was husky and tremulous as he returned Eric's greeting and made inquiries regarding his health.  \"It is much the same as when I wrote you,\" Eric answered, holding fast to his brother's hand, and gazing with a look of strong affection into his face. \"And you are quite well?\"  \"Quite, thank you; but about yourself, Eric? Would it not be well to have other advice?\"  \"I believe there is none better than I have had, brother,\" Eric said. Then turning to caress the little one in its nurse's arms, \"What a fine little fellow! a truly beautiful child, Sister Elsie. Ah, Lester I rejoice that you have a son to keep up the family name. May he live to be a great blessing to you both!\"  \"How sweet and pretty he is!\" Evelyn said, caressing him in her turn. \"Aunt Elsie, shall I show you to your room?\"  \"If you please, dear.\" And they passed on into the house together, while Eric dropped exhausted into an easy-chair, and Lester took possession of another close at his side.  \"You are very weak, Eric,\" he remarked, in a tone of mingled affection and concern; \"and I fear suffer a great deal of pain.\"  \"Yes, a good deal at times; but,\" he added with a joyous smile, \"I shall soon be in that land where there shall be no more pain, and the inhabitants shall not say 'I am sick.'\"  \"Don't speak of it,\" said Lester hoarsely; \"I must hope there are yet years of life in this world before you.\"  \"What a very pleasant room; what a delightful prospect from that window looking toward the river!\" Elsie exclaimed, as Evelyn led the way into the spacious, airy apartment set apart for the occupation of herself and husband during their stay.  \"I think it is,\" Evelyn returned in a quiet tone; \"that was the reason papa and I selected it for you. We have two other spare rooms, but this is the largest and has the loveliest views from its windows.\"  \"Thank you, dear. Is your mamma well?\"  \"I suppose so; she was when we heard last, a day or two ago. She is at Newport, Aunt Elsie; she found herself so worn out, she said, with attending to the claims of society, that a trip to the seashore was quite a necessity. Do you put the claims of society before everything else, Aunt Elsie?\"  \"Indeed no,\" returned Elsie, with a happy laugh. \"I'm afraid I put them last on my list: husband, baby, mother, grandpa, brothers and sisters, all come before society with me.\"  \"So they shall with me when I'm a woman,\" said Evelyn with decision; \"and papa shall always, _always_ be first. I don't know how mamma can bear to be away from him so much; especially now when he is so weak and"]]]
