But somebody put out a foot and the tormented boy stumbled headlong, at which the crowd set up another shout, and then sang louder than ever,       \"Rub-a-dub-dub!     One man in a tub!\"   \"I say, who tripped me up!\" gasped Tubbs, as soon as he could scramble up. \"Tell me who did it, and I'll soon settle with him.\"  \"Who rolled over the buttertub?\" asked Tom solemnly. \"One peanut reward for the first correct answer to this absorbing puzzle. Please don't all raise your hands at once.\"  \"I believe you did it, Tom Rover!\" bellowed the rich youth.  \"I? Never, Tubby, my dear boy. I never rolled over a buttertub in my life. You've got the wrong number. Kindly ring the bell next door.\"  \"Then it was Sam, and I'll fix him for it, see if I don't!\"  \"No, it wasn't Sam. He never touched a washtub in his life.\"  \"I say it was Sam,\" cried Tubbs, who was almost beside himself with rage. \"And I'm going to teach him a lesson. There, Sam Rover, how do you like that?\"  As the rich youth finished, he caught the youngest Rover by the shoulder with his left hand and with his right gave Sam a slanting blow on the cheek.  \"Stop! I didn't trip you!\" exclaimed Sam; and then as Tubbs aimed another blow at him he ducked and broke loose and hit out in return. His blow was harder and more truly aimed than he had anticipated, and it took Tubbs directly on the nose. A spurt of blood followed, accompanied by a yell of pain, and the rich youth fell back.  \"Oh! oh! My nose!\"  \"You brought it on yourself,\" retorted Sam. \"I didn't----\"  \"Stop! stop! Boys, what does this mean?\" came in a sudden stern voice, and in a moment more the two combatants found themselves confronted by Jasper Grinder, a new teacher. \"Fighting, eh? How often, must you be told that such disgraceful conduct is not allowed here? You come with me, and I'll make an example of both of you.\"  And in a moment more the two lads found themselves prisoners in Jasper Grinder's strong grasp and being marched out of the gymnasium toward the school building proper.     CHAPTER II.  A GLIMPSE AT THE PAST.   As old readers of this series of books know, the Rover boys were three in number, Dick being the oldest, fun-loving Tom next, and small but sturdy Sam bringing up the rear of a trio of as bright and up-to-date a set of American lads as could be found anywhere.  The home of the lads was with their father, Anderson Rover, and their Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha, on a beautiful farm at Valley Brook, in the heart of New York State. From this farm they had been sent to Putnam Hall, a semi-military institute of learning situated near Cedarville, on Cayuga Lake. This was while their father had mysteriously disappeared while on an exploring tour into the heart of Africa.  At Putnam Hall the Rover boys made a number of friends, some of whom have already been mentioned in these pages, and they likewise made several enemies. Chief among the enemies were Josiah Crabtree, a dictatorial teacher, and Dan Baxter, a bully who had done his best to make them \"knuckle under\" to him.  Since those first days at school many changes had taken place; so many, in fact, that but a few can be noted here. Crabtree had been discharged, and was now in prison for trying to hypnotize a lady into marrying him. This lady was Mrs. Stanhope, the mother of Dora Stanhope, who lived in the vicinity of Putnam Hall, and a girl of whom Dick Rover thought a good deal.  It had not taken the Rover boys long to discover that not only the dictatorial old teacher, but also the bully, Dan Baxter, were rascals, and, what was more, that Arnold Baxter, the father of Dan, was an old enemy to their father. Following this had come a journey to Africa and into the jungle in search of Mr. Rover, and this mission accomplished, the Rover boys had gone West to establish a mining claim in which their father was interested. This claim was disputed by the Baxters, and when the Rovers won out and went for a pleasure trip on the Great Lakes, the Baxters did their best to bring Dick, Tom, and Sam to grief. But instead of accomplishing their purpose they failed once more, and Arnold Baxter was returned to the prison from which he had escaped some months before. What had become of Dan Baxter nobody knew, but the Rover boys were soon to learn, as we will see in the chapters which follow.  After their stirring adventures on the Great Lakes, and especially on Needle Point Island in Lake Huron, the Rover boys were glad enough to get back to dear old Putnam Hall and to their studies, even though the latter were something of a \"grind,\" as Tom declared. They all loved Captain Victor Putnam, the owner of the institution, and it may be added here that the captain thought as much of the Rovers as he did of any of the scholars under him, and that was a good deal.  The coming of Jasper Grinder as a new under-teacher was a shock to many of the boys at the school. The principal teacher under Captain Putnam was Professor George Strong, who was stern but fair, and almost as well liked as the captain himself, and there were now several others, all of whom were on a good footing with the scholars. What had induced the captain to take in such a dictatorial and harsh master as Jasper Grinder was a mystery which nobody could explain.  As a matter of fact, Grinder had come into the Hall under a misrepresentation. He was from the Northwest, and claimed to have been a professor at a well-known California college. It was true he had once taught at this college, but his record was far from being as satisfactory as Captain Putnam had been led to believe. It was true he was a learned man,--quite the opposite of Josiah Crabtree, who had been wise only in looks,--but it was also true that he was a high-strung, passionate man, given to strange fits of anger, and that he was a miser, never spending a cent that was not absolutely required of him.  \"I say, let me go!\" cried Sam, as Jasper Grinder almost dragged him across the parade ground between the gymnasium and the school building. \"I am not to blame for this row.\"  \"Silence! I won't listen to a word until we are in the office,\" commanded the irate teacher.  \"He started the whole thing,\" came from Tubbs. \"He called me Tubby, and got the crowd to singing a song about me.\"  \"I had nothing to do with the song, and all the boys have called you Tubby since you came here,\" went on Sam.  \"Be quiet, I tell you!\" cried Jasper Grinder, and clutched the arm of each so tightly that Tubbs set up a yell of pain. \"I am master here, and I will show you how to mind.\"  At these words Sam's heart gave a sudden drop. It was Friday afternoon, and the next day would be, as usual, a holiday. Taking advantage of this fact Professor Strong had gone to Buffalo to visit a sick relative residing there, and only an hour before Captain Putnam had been driven away behind his team to visit an old army friend living at Fordview, twelve miles away. Professor Strong would not return until Monday morning, and it was more than likely the captain would remain away over night. During this interval Jasper Grinder would be in absolute charge of the academy and the pupils.  In a few minutes the teacher had led the way into Captain Putnam's office, and with a final pinch of their arms, which made Tubbs cry out once more with pain, he flung the pair away from him.  \"Don't you know it is disgraceful to fight?\" he thundered.  \"We weren't fighting--that is, not exactly,\" said Tubbs meekly.  \"Silence! I saw the whole affair. Why, your nose is still bleeding.\"  \"I don't care. It was Rover's fault, Mr. Grinder. He started the boys, and they all began to make fun of me. He wouldn't stop----\"  \"And then you fought like a pair of young tigers. Disgraceful! I will have to make an example of both of you.\"  \"I'd like to see Captain Putnam about the matter,\" said Sam boldly.  At these words Jasper Grinder fairly trembled with suppressed anger. \"The captain is not here, and I shall deal with you as you deserve,\" he said.  Tubbs sank down on a chair and began to attend to his nose with his handkerchief. Sam remained standing, but his whole manner showed that he did not consider he was being treated fairly.  \"What both of you boys deserve is a good thrashing,\" said the teacher, after a pause.  At this Sam looked his surprise. Thrashing was not permitted at the Hall. The worst that could happen to a student was to place him in solitary confinement over night, after a supper of bread and water.  \"As I am not permitted by the rules to thrash you, I shall put you in the stone cell over night,\" went on Jasper Grinder.  \"Together?\" questioned Tubbs, from behind his blood-stained handkerchief.  \"No. You shall go to the cell; and Rover shall be placed in the empty storeroom next to it.\"  \"The cell is ice cold, and so is the storeroom,\" protested Sam.  \"It is not my fault that you must be placed there, and you will have to put up with the cold,\" was the curt answer.  \"I shan't stay in a cold room!\" cried Sam. \"It's not fair.\"  \"You shall, and I'll put you there myself!\" ejaculated Jasper Grinder. \"Tubbs, don't dare to stir until I return.\"  So speaking, the unreasonable teacher caught hold of Sam once more, and despite the youngest Rover's struggles hustled him out of the office and through a long hallway, at the end of which was located the storeroom he had mentioned. The key to the room was in the lock.  \"Now stay there until you are willing to behave yourself,\" said Jasper Grinder, and shoved Sam into the apartment. \"For your impudence to me you shall go without your supper to-night.\"  \"That remains to be seen,\" replied Sam, but in such a low voice that the teacher did not hear. Then the door was closed and locked, and Jasper Grinder hurried away with the key in his pocket, to make poor Tubbs a prisoner in the stone cell.  \"Here's a pretty mess, and no mistake,\" thought Sam, as he sank on a bench, the only article of furniture the room contained. \"I'm being treated worse"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13455"],["title","The Rover Boys In The Mountains; Or, A Hunt for Fun and Fortune (#2)"],["body","Tom was treated by old Crabtree when first we came to the Hall. And all because I called Tubby by his nickname! If this keeps on a fellow won't dare to breathe out loud when Grinder is around. What a passionate fellow he is at times! He glares at a fellow as if he was going to eat you up!\"  While Sam remained on the bench he heard footsteps in the hallway and a howling protest from Tubbs. Then he heard the rich youth thrown into the stone cell next to the storeroom and left to his fate.  It was nipping cold, and, even with the window tightly closed and nailed over with slats, Sam could not endure it to remain on the bench long. Leaping up he began to stamp his feet and slap his arms across his chest to get them warm. Soon he heard Tubbs doing the same thing.  \"I guess he's worse off than I am,\" thought the youngest Rover. \"That stone cell hasn't any bench in it any more, and it must be twice as cold and damp as this room. It's a shame to put anyone there in this freezing weather. I don't believe Captain Putnam would stand for it if he was here.\"  He tried to speak to Tubbs, but the wall between was too thick, and he soon gave up the idea. Then he continued to stamp his feet and slap his arms, and even went through an imaginary prize fight, in order to warm up. It was now growing dark, and with the darkness the atmosphere of the storeroom became colder and colder.     CHAPTER III.  TOM ON A TOUR OF DISCOVERY.   Poor Sam was removed from the gymnasium so quickly that neither Dick nor Tom had time to protest, and when they reached the main door of the school building they found it shut and locked in their faces.  \"Say, this is an outrage,\" burst out Tom. \"Sam wasn't to blame for that fight. He didn't trip Tubby up.\"  \"I know he didn't,\" put in Fred Garrison, who had come up also. \"It was Larry Mason. But I shan't give Larry away.\"  \"Neither will I.\"  \"Mr. Grinder always carries matters with a high hand when the captain is away,\" put in Dick. \"And he gets red-hot at the least little thing.\"  \"He doesn't deserve to be a teacher here,\" came from George Granbury, who had followed the others. \"To my way of thinking, he's worse than old Crabtree was, even though he is perhaps better educated.\"  \"I'd like to know what he is going to do with Sam,\" said Dick, with a serious look on his face. \"Sam has made such a good record this term I hate to see it broken.\"  \"He'll do something to punish 'em both,\" came from Fred. \"It will be too bad, though, if he puts 'em in the stone cell. They'll freeze to death such a night as this is going to be.\"  \"I won't allow it,\" ejaculated Dick. \"Why, that would be inhuman!\"  \"I'm going in by the back way and find out what's going on,\" said Tom, and promptly disappeared around the corner of the Hall. He was soon inside the building, but to his chagrin found every door leading to Captain Putnam's private apartments and to the stone cell and the storeroom locked. Having gone through the mess-rooms and through several of the classrooms, he rejoined the others, who had gathered around the fire in what was called the students' general living room,--an apartment set aside during cold weather solely for the boys' comfort, where they might read, study, play quiet games, or do similar things in order to make themselves feel at home.  \"How did you make out?\" was the question immediately put.  \"Made out, and that's all,\" said Tom gloomily.  \"What do you mean?\" came from Dick.  \"Every blessed door is locked, and so are the windows. I can't get within two rooms of the office.\"  \"Did you hear anything?\" asked George.  \"Yes; I heard a noise like somebody stamping.\"  \"Where did it come from?\"  \"I think it came from the stone cell. But it sounded like somebody stamping on wood.\"  \"Perhaps it came from the empty storeroom,\" cried Dick. \"More than likely Mr. Grinder has placed Sam and Tubby there. I wish he'd come here. I'd question him.\"  \"Your wish is gratified,\" whispered George. \"Here he comes now!\"  The door at the far end of the room had opened, and now Jasper Grinder came forth in a hurry. He was about to pass to another room at the rear of the school when Dick stopped him.  \"Mr. Grinder, may I ask what you have done with Sam?\" he asked.  \"I have placed him in confinement until Captain Putnam returns,\" was the snappy answer.  \"Did you put him in the stone cell?\"  \"It is not for you to question me, Rover.\"  \"In this cold weather it isn't fit for anybody to be in that stone cell. Sam may catch his death of cold.\"  \"I am the best judge of my own actions, Rover, and need no advice from you. Your brother has broken the rules of this school, and must suffer for so doing.\"  \"It's inhuman to make a fellow freeze,\" burst out Tom. \"I don't believe Captain Putnam would do that.\"  \"Not another word from either of you,\" came sharply from the teacher. \"Your brother will not freeze to death, but the cold may teach him a useful lesson.\"  \"If he gets sick, I'll get my father to hold you legally responsible,\" went on Tom.  At these words the teacher turned slightly pale, a vision of a lawsuit with damages to pay floating across his miserly mind.  \"To ease your mind Rover, let me say I'll see to it that he doesn't get sick,\" he said, and before Tom or Dick could question him further he passed out of the room.  \"If he isn't the worst yet!\" burst out Fred, who had listened with interest to what was said.  \"I shan't stand it,\" returned Tom. \"Will you, Dick?\"  Dick, older and more thoughtful, mused for a moment.  \"I'd certainly like to help Sam,\" he said. \"But we must be careful and not get into trouble with Captain Putnam.\"  \"I'm going to find my way to the door of the cell somehow,\" went on Tom.  \"Old Grinder left that door unlocked when he came out,\" said George, who had joined them.  \"Good! I'm going through before he comes back.\"  As good as his word, Tom slipped past the various tables at which the students were sitting, until he reached the door which connected with Captain Putnam's private apartments.  Usually this portion of the Hall was forbidden ground to the scholars. But Tom had been inside the rooms a number of times, so knew the way well. Passing through a private sitting room and a small library, he came to a narrow hall connecting with the main hall, at the end of which were the stone cell and the empty storeroom.  He was just about to step into the main hall when he heard somebody coming down from the floor above. The party was Mrs. Green, the housekeeper, a good-natured lady upon whom Tom had played many a joke in the past.  \"Gosh! I mustn't be discovered!\" he muttered, and looked around for some place to hide. Under the staircase was a recess containing a number of hooks with cloaks and overcoats, and into this he crowded, drawing one of the overcoats so as to completely cover the upper portion of his body.  Hardly had he gained the hiding place when Mrs. Green reached the lower hallway. Tom heard her pause at the foot of the stairs, strike a match, and light the big swinging lamp hanging from overhead.  \"I might as well mend that overcoat now, while the captain is away,\" Tom heard her murmur to herself. \"It's only a buttonhole that's torn out, and a tailor would charge him four times what it's worth--and he always so good at Christmas-time!\"  \"She's looking out for her present,\" thought Tom, with a grin. \"But that's none of my affair. If only she isn't after this overcoat!\"  He heard the housekeeper approach the recess and pause for a moment in front of it. He hardly dared to breathe, fearing that he would surely be discovered.  \"Well, I declare, if he hasn't gone and worn the very overcoat itself!\" he heard Mrs. Green cry. \"Just like him, and two good coats a-hanging here. Well, I suppose it's the warmest he's got, and he'll have a cold ride back, especially if he returns to-night.\" And so speaking Mrs. Green hurried away.  \"A narrow shave, and no mistake,\" murmured Tom to himself, and listened until he heard a distant door close. Then all was quiet, save the distant murmur of the student's voices, coming from the sitting room.  Without losing more time, Tom left the recess and hurried to the door of the stone cell.  \"Sam!\" he called out softly. \"Are you in there?\"  \"No; _I'm_ in here,\" came in the voice of Tubbs. \"And--I'm almost frozen to--to--death.\" The last words with a chattering of teeth that told only too plainly how the rich youth was suffering.  \"Sorry for you, Tubby, really I am. But where is Sam?\"  \"In the--the storeroom. Oh, Rover, won't you please ask Mr. Grinder to let me out? I'll freeze to death here, I know I will!\"  \"I'll do what I can. But he won't let you out. He isn't that kind of a fellow.\"  \"You might buy him off, Rover. I've heard he's a regular miser, and I'll give you five dollars of my Christmas money if he'll let me go.\"  \"I'll see what I can do after I've talked to Sam.\" And so speaking Tom hurried to the door of the storeroom.  \"Tom, is it really you?\" cried the youngest Rover joyfully.  \"Yes. How are you making out?\"  \"Horribly. I believe my feet and ears are already frozen!\"  \"Grinder is a beast to put you in here, Sam.\"  \"I know that well enough. He won't give me any supper, I'm afraid.\"  \"Then I'll try to get some supper to you.\"  \"Is the key of this door on a hook outside?\"  \"No. If it was I'd have the door open long ago.\"  Sam gave a deep sigh, and then began to dance around once more to keep warm.  \"Perhaps I can find a key to fit this lock,\" went on Tom. \"I know there are keys in some of the other doors.\"  He ran off and soon returned with four keys, which he tried, one after another. The third was a fair fit, and with an effort the bolt of the lock was forced back.  \"Hurrah! the door's open!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Now you can go where you please.\"  \"Then you wouldn't stay here?\" questioned Sam anxiously.  \"Not much! I'd hide in one of the dormitories, and I wouldn't show myself until Captain Putnam gets back. I'll see to it that you get something to eat, and when"]]]
