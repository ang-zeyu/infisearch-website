Twinkle, twinkle, little star;    How I wonder what you are,    Up above the world so high,    Like a diamond in the sky!  2. When the blazing sun is set,    And the grass with dew is wet,    Then you show your little light;    Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.  3. Then, if I were in the dark,    I would thank you for your spark.    I could not see which way to go,    If you did not twinkle so.  4. And when I am sound asleep,    Oft you through my window peep;    For you never shut your eye,    Till the sun is in the sky.

James White has two dogs. One is a Newfoundland dog, and the other is a Scotch terrier.  2. The Newfoundland is a large, noble fellow. He is black, with a white spot, and with long, shaggy hair. His name is Sport.  3. Sport is a good watchdog, and a kind playfellow. Every night he guards the house while James and his father are asleep.  4. In the daytime, James often uses Sport for his horse. He has a little wagon, and a set of small harness which just fits the dog.  5. He hitches Sport to this wagon, and drives over the country. In this way, he can go almost as fast as his father with the old family horse.  6. The name of James's Scotch terrier is Dodger. He is called Dodger because he jumps about so friskily. He is up on a chair, under the table, behind the door, down cellar, and out in the yard,--all in a minute.  7. Dodger has very bright eyes, and he does many funny things. He likes to put his paws up on the crib, and watch the baby.  8. The other day he took baby's red stocking, and had great fun with it; but he spoiled it in his play, and James had to scold him.  9. Everyone likes to see James White with his two dogs. They always seem very happy together.

But Willie did not stir. \"Willie!\" said mamma. She thought he had not heard.  3.  \"I'm afraid,\" said Willie.  4.  \"Afraid of what?\"  5.  \"It's dark up there.\"  6.  \"What is the dark?\" asked mamma. \"See! It is nothing but a shadow.\" And she held her hand between the lamp and the workbasket on the table.  [Illustration: Mother, seated in rocking chair, kerosene lamp on table, boy standing, examining his shadow on the wall.]  7. \"Now it is dark in the basket; but as soon as I take my hand away, it is light.\"  8. \"Come and stand between the lamp and the wall, Willie. See! There is your shadow on the wall. Can your shadow hurt you?\"  9. \"Oh no, mamma! I am sure it can not hurt me.\"  10. \"Well, the dark is only a big shadow over everything.\"  11. \"What makes the big shadow, mamma?\"  12. \"I will tell you all about that, Willie, when you are a little older. But now, I wish you would find me a brave boy who is not afraid of shadows, to run upstairs and get my needlebook.\"  13. \"I am bravo, mamma. I will go. --Here it is.\"  14. \"Thank you, my brave little man. You see the dark didn't hurt you.\"  SLATE WORK.

Puss, with her three kittens, had lived in the coal cellar; but one day she thought she would carry them to the attic.  2. The servant thought that was not the proper place for them; so she carried them back to the cellar.  3. Puss was certain that she wanted them in the attic; so she carried them there again and again, five, six, seven, --yes, a dozen times; for each time the servant took them back to the cellar.  4. Poor puss was nearly tired out, and could carry them no longer.  5. Suddenly she went away. Where do you think she went?  6. She was gone a long time. When she returned, she had a strange cat with her that we had never seen before.  7. She seemed to tell him all about her great trouble, and he listened to her story.  8. Then the strange cat took the little kittens, one by one, and carried them to the attic. After this he went away, and we have never seen him since.  9. The servant then left the kittens in the attic, for she saw how anxious puss was to have them stay there.  10. Was not the strange cat kind to puss? This lesson should teach children to be ever ready to help one another.

Once there was a little kitty,      White as the snow;    In a barn he used to frolic,      Long time ago.  2. In the barn a little mousie      Ran to and fro;    For she heard the little kitty,      Long time ago.  3. Two black eyes had little kitty,      Black as a crow;    And they spied the little mousie,      Long time ago.  4. Four soft paws had little kitty,      Paws soft as snow;    And they caught the little mousie,      Long time ago.  5. Nine pearl teeth had little kitty,      All in a row;    And they bit the little mousie,      Long time ago.  6. When the teeth bit little mousie,      Mousie cried out \"Oh!\"    But she slipped away from kitty,      Long time ago.

After play, we should be glad to work.  2. I knew a boy who liked a good game very much. He could run, swim, jump, and play ball; and was always merry when out of school.  3. But he knew that time is not all for play; that our minutes, hours, and days are very precious.  4. At the end of his play, he would go home. After he had washed his face and hands, and brushed his hair, he would help his mother, or read in his book, or write upon his slate.  5. He used to say, \"One thing at a time.\" When he had done with work, he would play; but he did not try to play and to work at the same time.

Why do you lock your rosy feet      So closely round the spray?    Twit-twit, twit-twit, twit-tweet!      That was all he would say.  3. Why on the topmost bough do you get,      Little bird so gray?    Twit-twit-twee! twit-twit-twit!      That was all he would say.  4. Where is your mate? come, answer me,      Little bird so gray.

[Illustration: Older girls playing with younger girl. Three children standing in background.]  2. Her grandfather first gave her this name, and it seemed to fit the little girl so nicely that soon it took the place of her own.  3. Even when a baby, Susie laughed and crowed from morning till night. No one ever heard her cry unless she was sick or hurt.  4. When she had learned to walk, she loved to go about the house and get things for her mother, and in this way save her as many steps as she could.  5. She would sit by her mother's side for an hour at a time, and ask her ever so many questions, or she would take her new book and read.  6.

She never used an unkind word, but tried to do whatever would please her playmates best.  7. One day, a poor little girl with a very ragged dress was going by and Susie heard some children teasing her and making fun of her.  8. She at once ran out to the gate, and asked the poor little girl to come in. \"What are you crying for?\" Susie asked.  9. \"Because they all laugh at me,\" she said.  10. Then Susie took the little girl into the house. She cheered her up with kind words, and gave her a nice dress and a pair of shoes.  11. This brought real joy and gladness to the poor child, and she, too, thought that Susie was rightly called Sunbeam.

Henry was a kind, good boy. His father was dead, and his mother was very poor. He had a little sister about two years old.  2. He wanted to help his mother, for she could not always earn enough to buy food for her little family.  3. One day, a man gave him a dollar for finding a pocketbook which he had lost.  4. Henry might have kept all the money, for no one saw him when he found it. But his mother had taught him to be honest, and never to keep what did not belong, to him.  5. With the dollar he bought a box, three brushes, and some blacking. He then went to the corner of the street, and said to every one whose boots did not look nice, \"Black your boots, sir, please?\"  6. He was so polite that gentlemen soon began to notice him, and to let him black their boots. The first day he brought home fifty cents, which he gave to his mother to buy food with.  7. When he gave her the money, she said, as she dropped a tear of joy, \"You are a dear, good boy, Henry. I did not know how I could earn enough to buy bread with, but now I think we can manage to get along quite well,\"  8. Henry worked all the day, and went to school in the evening. He earned almost enough to support his mother and his little sister.    LESSON XV.  tread     whis'per     soft'ly     talk     cheer ful'     care'ful   DON'T WAKE THE BABY.

A boy was once sent from home to take a basket of things to his grandmother.  2. The basket was so full that it was very heavy. So his little brother went with him, to help carry the load.  3. They put a pole under the handle of the basket, and each then took hold of an end of the pole. In this way they could carry the basket very nicely.  4. Now the older boy thought, \"My brother Tom does not know about this pole.  5. \"If I slip the basket near him, his side will be heavy, and mine light; but if the basket is in the middle of the pole, it will be as heavy for me as it is for him.  6. \"Tom does not know this as I do. But I will not do it. It would be wrong, and I will not do what is wrong.\"  7. Then he slipped the basket quite near his own end of the pole. His load was now heavier than that of his little brother.  8. Yet he was happy; for he felt that he had done right. Had he deceived his brother, he would not have felt at all happy.

The kingbird is not bigger than a robin.  2. He eats flies, and worms, and bugs, and berries.  3. He builds his nest in a tree, near some house.  4. When there are young ones in the nest, he sits on the top of a tree near them.  5. He watches to see that no bird comes to hurt them or their mother.  6. If a hawk, a crow, or even an eagle comes near, he makes a dash at it.  7. Though he is so small, he is brave, and he is also very active.  8. He never fails to drive off other birds from his nest.  9. He flies around and around the eagle, and suddenly strikes him with his sharp bill.  10. He strikes at his eye, and then darts away before the eagle can catch him.  11. Or he strikes from behind, and is off again before the eagle can turn round.  12. In a short time, the great eagle is tired of such hard blows, and flies away. He is very glad to get rid of his foe.  13. Is not the little fellow a brave bird?  14. Because he can drive off all other birds, he is called the KINGBIRD.

Under a great tree in the woods, two boys saw a fine, large nut, and both ran to get it.  2. James got to it first, and picked it up.  3. \"It is mine,\" said John, \"for I was the first to see it.\"  4. \"No, it is mine\" said James, \"for I was the first to pick it up.\"  [Illustration: Three boys standing by a fence, one older than the others.]  5. Thus, they at once began to quarrel about the nut.  6. As they could not agree whose it should be, they called an older boy, and asked him.  7. The older boy said, \"I will settle this quarrel.\"  8. He took the nut, and broke the shell. He then took out the kernel, and divided the shell into two parts, as nearly equal as he could.  9. \"This half of the shell,\" said he, \"belongs to the boy who first saw the nut.  10. \"And this half belongs to the boy who picked it up.  11. \"The kernel of the nut, I shall keep as my pay for settling the quarrel.  12. \"This is the way,\" said he, laughing, \"in which quarrels are very apt to end.\"    LESSON XXI.  crea'tures    drones     in'side    hive     i'dle  de fense'     driv'en    killed     cells    size  work'ers      queen      stings     shape    wax   THE BEE.  1. Bees live in a house that is called a hive. They are of three kinds,--workers, drones, and queens.  2. Only one queen can live in each hive. If she is lost or dead, the other bees will stop their work.  [Illustration: Three bee-hives; wooden boxes about two feet square and four feet high, with a sloped roof.]  3. They are very wise and busy little creatures. They all join together to build cells of wax for their honey.  4. Each bee takes its proper place, and does its own work. Some go out and gather honey from the flowers; others stay at home and work inside the hive.  5. The cells which they build, are all of one shape and size, and no room is left between them.  6. The cells are not round, but have six sides. 7. Did you ever look into a glass hive to see the bees while at work? It is pleasant to see how busy they always are.  8. But the drones do not work. Before winter comes, all the drones are driven from the hive or killed, that they may not eat the honey which they did not gather.  9. It is not quite safe for children to handle bees. They have sharp stings that they know well how to use in their defense.    SLATE WORK.  [Illustration: Script Exercise:  How doth the little busy bee   Improve each shining hour.
