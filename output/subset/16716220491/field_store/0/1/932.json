Only it was a great deal finer, for Mary's dress had three ruffles and Sue's had only two! And, then, there was the lace from England!     THE PLAID DRESS   \"I want a warm plaid dress,\" said a little girl. \"The days are colder, and the frost will soon be here. But how can I get it? Mother says that she cannot buy one for me.\"  The old white sheep in the meadow heard her, and he bleated to the shepherd, \"The little girl wants a warm plaid dress. I will give my wool. Who else will help?\"  The kind shepherd said, \"I will.\" Then he led the old white sheep to the brook and washed its wool. When it was clean and white, he said, \"The little girl wants a warm plaid dress. The sheep has given his wool, and I have washed it clean and white. Who else will help?\"  \"We will,\" said the shearers. \"We will bring our shears and cut off the wool.\"  The shearers cut the soft wool from the old sheep, and then they called, \"The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The shepherd has washed it; and we have sheared it. Who else will help?\"  [Illustration: Shearer shearing the sheep]  \"We will,\" cried the carders. \"We will comb it out straight and smooth.\"  Soon they held up the wool, carded straight and smooth, and they cried, \"The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The shepherd has washed the wool. The shearers have cut it, and we have carded it. Who else will help?\"  \"We will,\" said the spinners. \"We will spin it into thread.\"  \"Whirr, whirr!\" How fast the spinning wheels turned, singing all the time.  Soon the spinners said, \"The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The shepherd has washed the wool. The shearers have cut it. The carders have carded it, and we have spun it into thread. Who else will help?\"  \"We will,\" said the dyers. \"We will dye it with beautiful colors.\"  Then they dipped the woven threads into bright dye, red and blue and green and brown.  As they spread the wool out to dry, the dyers called: \"The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The shepherd has washed the wool. The shearers have cut it. The carders have carded it. The spinners have spun it, and we have dyed it with bright beautiful colors. Who else will help?\"  \"We will,\" said the weavers. \"We will make it into cloth.\"  [Illustration: Weaver at loom]  \"Clickety-clack! clickety-clack!\" went the loom, as the colored thread was woven over and under over and under. Before long it was made into beautiful plaid cloth.  Then the little girl's mother cut and made the dress. It was a beautiful plaid dress, and the little girl loved to wear it. Every time she put it on, she thought of her friends who had helped her,--the sheep, the shearers, the carders, the spinners, the dyers, the weavers, and her own dear mother.     THE GODDESS OF THE SILKWORM   Hoangti was the emperor of China. He had a beautiful wife whose name was Si-ling. The emperor and his wife loved their people and always thought of their happiness.  In those days the Chinese people wore clothes made of skins. By and by animals grew scarce, and the people did not know what they should wear. The emperor and empress tried in vain to find some other way of clothing them.  One morning Hoangti and his wife were in the beautiful palace garden. They walked up and down, up and down, talking of their people.  Suddenly the emperor said, \"Look at those worms on the mulberry trees, Si-ling. They seem to be spinning.\"  Si-ling looked, and sure enough, the worms were spinning. A long thread was coming from the mouth of each, and each little worm was winding this thread around its body.  Si-ling and the emperor stood still and watched the worms. \"How wonderful!\" said Si-ling.  The next morning Hoangti and the empress walked under the trees again. They found some worms still winding thread. Others had already spun their cocoons and were fast asleep. In a few days all of the worms had spun cocoons.  \"This is indeed a wonderful, wonderful thing!\" said Si-ling. \"Why, each worm has a thread on its body long enough to make a house for itself!\"  Si-ling thought of this day after day. One morning as she and the emperor walked under the trees, she said, \"I believe I could find a way to weave those long threads into cloth.\"  \"But how could you unwind the threads?\" asked the emperor.  [Illustration: Hoangti and Si-ling walking among the trees]  \"I'll find a way,\" Si-ling said. And she did; but she had to try many, many times.  She put the cocoons in a hot place, and the little sleepers soon died. Then the cocoons were thrown into boiling water to make the threads soft. After that the long threads could be easily unwound.  Now Si-ling had to think of something else; she had to find a way to weave the threads into cloth. After many trials, she made a loom--the first that was ever made. She taught others to weave, and soon hundreds of people were making cloth from the threads of the silkworm.  The people ever afterward called Si-ling \"The Goddess of the Silkworm.\" And whenever the emperor walked with her in the garden, they liked to watch the silkworms spinning threads for the good of their people.     THE FLAX  I   It was spring. The flax was in full bloom, and it had dainty little blue flowers that nodded in the breeze.  \"People say that I look very well,\" said the flax. \"They say that I am fine and long and that I shall make a beautiful piece of linen. How happy I am! No one in the world can be happier.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said the fence post, \"you may grow and be happy, and you may sing, but you do not know the world as I do. Why, I have knots in me.\" And it creaked;    \"Snip, snap, snurre,   Basse, lurre,   The song is ended.\"  \"No, it is not ended,\" said the flax. \"The sun will shine, and the rain will fall, and I shall grow and grow. No, no, the song is not ended.\"  One day some men came with sharp reap hooks. They took the flax by the head and cut it off at the roots. This was very painful, you may be sure.  Then the flax was laid in water and was nearly drowned. After that it was put on a fire and nearly roasted. All this was frightful. But the flax only said, \"One cannot be happy always. By having bad times as well as good, we become wise.\"  After the flax had been cut and steeped and roasted, it was put on a spinning wheel. \"Whir-r-r, whir-rr-r,\" went the spinning wheel; it went so fast that the flax could hardly think.  \"I have been very happy in the sunshine and the rain,\" it said. \"If I am in pain now, I must be contented.\"  At last the flax was put in the loom. Soon it became a beautiful piece of white linen.  \"This is very wonderful,\" said the flax. \"How foolish the fence post was with its song of--    'Snip, snap, snurre,   Basse, lurre,   The song is ended.'  The song is not ended, I am sure. It has only just begun.  \"After all that I have suffered, I am at last made into beautiful linen. How strong and fine I am, and how long and white! This is even better than being a plant bearing flowers. I have never been happier than I am now.\"  After some time the linen was cut into pieces and sewed with needles. That was not pleasant; but at last there were twelve pretty white aprons.  \"See,\" said the flax, \"I have been made into something. Now I shall be of some use in the world. That is the only way to be happy.\"   II   Years passed by, and the linen was so worn that it could hardly hold together.  \"The end must come soon,\" said the flax.  At last the linen did fall into rags and tatters; it was torn into shreds and boiled in water. The flax thought the end had come.  But no, the end was not yet. After being made into pulp and dried, the flax became beautiful white paper.  \"This is a surprise, a glorious surprise,\" it said. \"I am finer than ever, and I shall have fine things written on me. How happy I am!\"  And sure enough, the most beautiful stories and verses were written upon it. People read the stories and verses, and they were made wiser and better. Their children and their children's children read them, too, and so the song was not ended.  --HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN.  [Illustration: Girl reading a book]     THE WONDERFUL WORLD     Great, wide, beautiful, wonderful World,   With the wonderful water round you curled,   And the wonderful grass upon your breast,   World, you are beautifully drest.    The wonderful air is over me,   And the wonderful wind is shaking the tree--   It walks on the water, and whirls the mills,   And talks to itself on the top of the hills.    You friendly Earth, how far do you go,   With the wheat-fields that nod and the rivers that flow,   With cities and gardens, and cliffs and isles,   And people upon you for thousands of miles?    Ah! you are so great, and I am so small,   I hardly can think of you, World, at all;   And yet, when I said my prayers to-day,   A whisper within me seemed to say,   \"You are more than the Earth, though you are such a dot!   You can love and think, and the Earth cannot!\"  --William Brighty Rands.     [Illustration: The Hillman at the housewife's door]  THE HILLMAN AND THE HOUSEWIFE   As every one knows, fairies are always just. They are kind to others, and in return they expect others to be kind to them. In some countries across the sea there are fairies called Hillmen.  Now, there once lived a certain housewife who liked to make bargains. She gave away only those things for which she had no use, and then expected always to get something in return.  One day a Hillman knocked at her door.  \"Can you lend us a saucepan?\" he asked. \"There's a wedding on the hill, and all the pots are in use.\"  \"Is he to have one?\" whispered the servant who opened the door.  \"Aye, to be sure,\" answered the housewife; \"one must be neighborly. Get the saucepan for him, lass.\"  The maid turned to take a good saucepan from the shelf, but the housewife stopped her.  \"Not that, not that,\" she whispered. \"Get the old one out of the cupboard.

When you say the Shema twice a day, as every good Jew is expected to do, you read in it that God commanded us, through Moses, to wear a fringe on our garment--the tsitsith, a visible sign to remind us of His Commandments, just in the same way as a table, spread ready for a meal, reminds us of our meals. Our religion is not a thing to be kept only for the Sabbath and the Holy Days, and left out of our minds on all other days. Our religion must be a living influence, always with us, so the tsitsith is a very simple kind of symbol to be ever worn to remind a Jew of his God, his duty to Him and to his neighbour. It is not only we Jews who have religious symbols; every other religion has them. Now imagine if you were to go up to a Christian boy and mock him and say nasty words to him for wearing a cross, or crucifix, he would turn round and fight you, and he would be right in doing so, for no one has a right to insult another for wearing or doing what he believes to be holy. Instead of being ashamed when you were mocked and laughed at by Christian boys for wearing your tsitsith, you should have asked them to hear you explain the reason for wearing it. I am sure they would not have laughed at you any more. They would respect you for trying to be true and to live up to your convictions.  \"We Jews have, in the past, made a great mistake in not letting the outside world know more of the deeper spiritual meaning of each of our symbols. Had we not done this, we should have been better understood by non-Jews, and our children would not have suffered as you and many others also have done, through the ignorant mocking of your Christian schoolmates.  \"I know that in Palestine the Jews, whether old or young, greatly love to wear their tsitsith, and take a pride in letting them be seen, so that the Arabs and the Turks look upon the tsitsith as a sacred garment.\"  [Illustration: THE FATHER TEACHING THE CHILD THE MEANING OF THE TSITSITH (SACRED GARMENT)]   UNCLE'S LETTER  \"How do you know this, Father?\" said Benjamin.  By this time all in the room had dropped their papers and books, and were listening to their father.  \"Well, this is how I know: nearly thirty years ago my uncle and his family went to live in Jerusalem, and for many years one of my cousins used to write to me about once a month. His letters were most interesting. When his letters came I could almost imagine, when reading them, that I was living in Bible times.  \"Have you any of his letters still, Father?\" they all exclaimed.  \"Yes,\" said the father, \"I have many of them.\"  \"Oh, do read some of them to us!\" they pleaded. \"All right, I will; and I will first try to find the one about the tsitsith.\"  The father went up to his bedroom, and soon came down with a bundle of letters wrapped in a newspaper. He started looking through them while all the family stood around him, watching as eagerly as if he were searching for an heirloom.  \"I will choose a very short one,\" said the father, \"for it is on the subject I have spoken to Benjamin about; but if you like I will make it a rule every Friday evening, after our Sabbath meal, to read some of the letters to you.\"   THE HOLY CITY  When all were quietly and comfortably seated, their father started reading:  \"My dear Cousin,--After a great many adventures and suffering (which I will write to you about another time) we arrived safely in Jerusalem. To me, it seemed rather dull after London, but both father and mother shed tears of joy when they at last arrived in the Holy City. Some people met us a little way out, for father had written telling them we were coming. We were almost royally received and heartily welcomed, for very few Jews come here with their young families.  \"We must have looked a sight--you in London could not imagine anything like our cavalcade! First went Father riding on a mule, with Mother following on another mule. Mother's saddle was made with pillows, for it is impossible for a woman to ride for sixteen or eighteen hours without a soft, comfortable seat.  \"You go up high hills, and then down again, imagining every time you go down that you will topple over and fall over the precipice and be killed. In fact, your heart is in your mouth every five minutes, so that by the time you arrive in Jerusalem (which is surrounded by hills) you are almost too weak to rejoice at the beauty that greets your sight, for nowhere in the world can, I think, anything be seen more beautiful than a sunrise over the mountains around Jerusalem.  \"Oh, I forgot to tell you that we youngsters were put into baskets on a camel's back, and how we were shaken! I felt as if I were praying and shaking all the time, for it seemed as if we could never get to Jerusalem alive in this way.\"   THE PROUD BOYS OF JERUSALEM  \"At last we entered the Holy City, and arrived at Father's friend's house, where we were made very welcome and treated most kindly. I soon made friends with the boys, for, you know, I can speak yiddish quite well.  \"They are funny little chaps. They look like old men, with long kaftans (coats) and side ear-locks of hair, carrying their prayer book or Bible to Shule. The first thing I noticed was the tsitsith. They wear really long ones, with long fringes hanging down about a quarter of a yard or more. They wear them as we do a waistcoat, so that they can be seen by everyone, not as we wear them in England, tucked away out of sight. Here young and old, even little boys who can only just walk and lisp their prayers, wear them, and, what is more, take a real pleasure in wearing them. I asked some of them why they wore them so openly, and they answered: 'Because when we look at them we always remember that our chief duty in life is to try to obey God's commands, and if we had them tucked away out of sight we should forget to be obedient.' 'Besides,' they said, 'we are commanded in the Torah to do so openly.' Then I told them if we wore them so openly in Europe we should perhaps be laughed at by some people and made fun of. They said: 'Why should doing so make us be laughed at by other nations? Do we laugh at the symbols and charms that many of them wear? Every nation,' they said, 'has its tokens and symbols, and we Jews have ours, and we should rejoice in wearing ours when they are to help us to feel that God is near us when we think and act rightly.' All this made me think very seriously, and in a way I had never thought before. I began to realize that they were more in the right than we Jews are in England.  \"So now I have decided to wear my tsitsith, too, on the outside, as the Jerusalem boys do. The boys never play except on the quiet, just now and then, for their parents think that their only duty in life is to study and do as many Mitzvoth as they can. Really, the boys are as full of fun and pranks as we English boys, and they just love a bit of play and larking when they can get it.  \"I must now end this letter, but I have a lot more to tell you, and I will keep my promise and write you by degrees of all I see. Meanwhile, I send you the greeting of Zion and Sabbath. Rachael wanted to put a letter into my envelope to your sister, but she says she has not finished it yet, although she has already written ten pages. So I will wait no longer, in case I miss the post, as it goes only once a week from here, and sometimes only once a month.\"  Thus ended the first letter, and Benjamin's brothers and sisters were so pleased with it that they were delighted that one of the bundle of letters should be read aloud after the Sabbath meal on every Friday evening.  Benjamin was quite happy now, for, although he had done a thing which was not right, now that he had repented good would come out of it, for there was a chance of their now having pleasanter and more instructive Sabbath evenings than they had ever had before. Besides, he now made up his mind always to wear his tsitsith.     THE WELCOME    On the following Friday, after the Sabbath evening meal, the boys asked their father to read them another letter from his cousin in Jerusalem. He was pleased at their eagerness, and, while Upstairs getting the letter, some of the boys' friends came in and settled comfortably down, for all were eager to hear the letter read.  Mr Jacob said: \"This time I will read a letter from your Cousin Dora to my sister which will certainly interest you, my dear,\" turning to his daughter, \"but at the same time, I think it will interest you all.\"  \"My dear Milly,--Isaac must have written to Jacob all about our arrival, so I will begin by giving you some idea of our life here and my impressions. The people, who so kindly asked us to stay with them till Father finds a dwelling, have a few rooms in a house, which has a marble paved courtyard. Six other families also have two or three rooms each. All the work is done in the courtyard, even the cooking; for each family uses tiny stoves, made of mud, into which they put a little lighted charcoal and cook just outside or near their own doors; for there are no kitchens or fireplaces in any of the rooms, and thus we see what each family cooks. The Sephardim (Jews who have lived here for years) eat their meals in the courtyard. They lay a mat on the marble tiles, on which they place a small low table, and they sit on the mat and eat. Two Sephardim families have rooms in the house and they speak Arabic and Spanish, and their ways of living are more like those of the Turks, just as the Jews in England live more like the English.  \"Everyone seems most interested in us. Many people have come to visit us, to see the new arrivals!  \"The evening of the day on which we arrived was Friday; there was a clear moonlight such as you would not often see in England, and it was very warm, too; so we and our visitors sat in the courtyard. All eagerly asked us many questions, till quite late; and thus the evening passed very quickly and pleasantly.  \"After prayers on Sabbath some people sent a bottle of "]]]
