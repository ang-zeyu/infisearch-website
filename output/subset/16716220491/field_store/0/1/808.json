The present work, though written upon strictly vegetarian principles, is by no means addressed to vegetarians only. On the contrary, we hope that the following pages of recipes will be read by that enormous class throughout the country who during the last few years have been gradually changing their mode of living by eating far _less_ meat, and taking vegetables and farinaceous food as a substitute.  Where there are thousands who are vegetarians from choice, there are tens of thousands who are virtually vegetarians from necessity. Again, there is another large class who from time to time adopt a vegetarian course of diet on the ground of health, and as a means of escaping from the pains attendant on gout, liver complaint, or dyspepsia.  The class we most wish to reach, however, is that one, increasing we fear, whose whole life is one continual struggle not merely to live, but to live decently.  It may seem a strong statement, but we believe it to be a true one, that only those who have tried a strictly vegetarian course of diet know what real _economy_ means. Should the present work be the means of enabling even one family to become not only better in health but richer in pocket, it will not have been written in vain.  A.G.

Patented in France, 1889. N. S. Wales, 1889. Victoria, 1889. Other Foreign Rights reserved.  CHELSEA TABLE JELLIES,  The Inventor and Patentee, in introducing this high-class article of food, begs to warn the Public that the great success and enormous demand the CHELSEA TABLE JELLIES have obtained in Great Britain has brought many imitators on the Market. A few Stores and Grocers are offering same to the Public, no doubt for the purpose of wishing to appear cheaper, or for making extra profit. The favour for the CHELSEA TABLE JELLY has been obtained solely upon the merits of the article, and it is held to be the greatest invention of the kind, bringing within the reach of all classes this hitherto almost unobtainable luxury. This has been fully endorsed by the unsolicited testimony of high-class British journals.  The article is put up in cardboard boxes, in quantities to make 1/2-pints, pints, and quarts of jelly, and the following are some of the flavours: Lemon, Orange, Vanilla, Calves' Feet, Noyeau, Raspberry, Punch, and Madeira. It should not be confounded with the ordinary fruit Jelly, which is a totally different article, _this being a pure Calves' Feet jelly_, superseding the use of gelatine in packets for jelly purposes--this latter, as will easily be seen, being now a thing of the past. On each box is printed a public analyst's report, also full directions for use.  _The following advantages are claimed over all other Calves Feet jellies_:--  1. It is less than one-third of the price of bottled jellies, and superior in quality.  2. It never gets mildewed or corky.  3. It never fails to set or jellify.  4. Its extreme simpleness of preparation, only requiring to be melted by the addition of hot water, no flavouring or other matter being required.  5. It will keep good for any time until made up, when it will keep good longer than other jellies.  6. The largest quantity can be made in a few minutes.  For persons suffering from dyspepsia or any other ailment, it will also be found to be a great boon, as it can be cut and eaten in the solidified state with great satisfaction. On sea voyages and excursions of any kind it will be found invaluable.  _BEWARE OF SPURIOUS IMITATIONS, and ask only for the_ WALTER ROBERTSON CHELSEA TABLE JELLY.

Received 1888.  _I certify that the following are the results of the analysis of the above samples_:  I have examined a sample of Chelsea Table jelly, and find it to be a mixture of Calves' Feet jelly and sugar; it is undoubtedly nutritious and wholesome.  It is superior to other samples that I have analysed, as it in much firmer and keeps well.  It is clear and bright, and has evidently been carefully manufactured from pure materials.  It has a pleasant flavour, and is of excellent quality.  _(Signed)_ R. H. HARLAND, F.I,C., F.C.S.  Laboratory, Plough Court, 37, Lombard Street. _Public Analyst_.

GENTLEMEN,--I may inform you that I have tried other makers of jellies, but have found none to equal yours in excellence of quality. I have mentioned this fact frequently to Mr. Seymour Mead and to my friends. I am also deeply indebted to you from the fact that a little niece of mine was fed almost exclusively on your Calves' Feet Jelly for a period of three months, and who, when she refused to take other things, always took most willingly to your jellies.

We wish it to be distinctly understood at starting, that the present work is purely a cookery-book, written on the principles generally adopted by vegetarians; and as, until quite recently, there seemed to be in the minds of many some doubt as to the definition of vegetarianism, we will quote the following explanation from the head of the report of the London Vegetarian Society:--\"The aims of the London Vegetarian Society are to advocate the total disuse of the flesh of animals (fish, flesh, and fowl) as food, and to promote a more extensive use of pulse, grains, fruits, nuts, and other products of the vegetable kingdom, thus propagating a principle tending essentially to true civilisation, to universal humaneness, and to the increase of happiness generally.\"  We have no intention of writing a treatise on vegetarianism, but we consider a few words of explanation necessary. Years back"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14594"],["title","Cassell's Vegetarian Cookery: A Manual of Cheap and Wholesome Diet (#2)"],["body","persons were under the impression that by vegetarianism was meant simply an abstention from flesh-meat, but that fish was allowed. Such, however, is not the case, according to the rules of most of the Vegetarian Societies of the day. On the other hand, strictly speaking, real vegetarians would not be allowed the use of eggs and milk; but it appears that many use these, though there are a considerable number of persons who abstain. There is no doubt that the vegetable kingdom, without either milk or eggs, contains every requisite for the support of the human body. In speaking on this subject, Sir Henry Thompson observes:--\"The vegetable kingdom comprehends the cereals, legumes, roots, starches, sugar, herbs, and fruits. Persons who style themselves vegetarians often consume milk, eggs, butter, and lard, which are choice foods from the animal kingdom. There are other persons, of course, who are strictly vegetarian eaters, and such alone have any right to the title of vegetarians.\"  In the following pages will be found ample recipes for the benefit of parties who take either view. In questions of this kind there will always be found conflicting views. We have no wish or desire to give opinions, but consider it will be more advisable, and probably render the book far more useful, if we confine ourselves as much as possible to facts.  The origin of vegetarianism is as old as the history of the world itself, and probably from time immemorial there have been sects which have practised vegetarianism, either as a religious duty, or under the belief that they would render the body more capable of performing religious duties. In the year 1098, or two years prior to the date of Henry I., there was a strictly vegetarian society formed in connection with the Christian Church, which lived entirely on herbs and roots, and the society has lasted to the present day. Again, there have been many sects who, not so strict, have allowed themselves the use of fish.  Again, there are those who adopt a vegetarian course of diet on the ground of health. Many maintain that diseases like gout and dyspepsia would disappear were vegetarian diet strictly adhered to. On the other hand, we have physicians who maintain that the great cause of indigestion is not eating enough. An American physician, some years ago, alleged he had discovered the cause, his argument being that the more work the stomach had to do the stronger it would become, on the same principle that the arm of a blacksmith is more powerful in consequence of hard work. Of one thing we are certain, and that is, there will always be rival physicians and rival sects; but the present work will simply be a guide to _those who require, from whatever cause, a light form of diet_. Perhaps the greatest benefit vegetarians can do their cause--and there are many who think very strongly on the subject--is to endeavour to take a dispassionate view. Rome was not built in a day; and if we look back at the past history of this country, during the last half-century, in regard to food, we shall see that there have been many natural changes at work. Waves of thought take place backwards and forwards, but still the tide may flow. Some fifty years ago there was, undoubtedly, a strong impression (with a large number of right-minded people) that plenty of meat, beer, and wine were good for all, even for young children. The medical profession are very apt to run in flocks, and follow some well-known leader. At the period to which we refer, numbers of anxious mothers would have regarded the advice to bring up their children as vegetarians and teetotallers as positive cruelty. This old-fashioned idea has passed away.  One great motive for adopting a course of vegetarian diet is economy; and here we feel that we stand on firm ground, without danger of offending sincere opinions, which are often wrongly called prejudices. To a great extent, the majority of the human race are virtually vegetarians from necessity. Nor do we find feebleness either of mind or body necessarily ensues. We believe there are tens of thousands of families who would give vegetarianism a trial were it not for fear. Persons are too apt to think that bodily strength depends upon the nature of the food we eat. In India we have a feeble race, living chiefly on rice. On the other hand, in China, for bodily strength, few can compare with the Coolies. For many years in Scotland the majority lived on oatmeal, while in Ireland they lived on potatoes. We do not wish to argue anything from these points, but to bring them forward for consideration. Probably, strength of body and mind, as a general rule, depends upon breed, and this argument tells two ways--it does not follow that vegetarians will be necessarily strong, and will cease to be cruel; nor does it follow that those who have been accustomed all their lives to eat meat will cease to be strong should they become vegetarians. As we have said, the great motive that induces many to give vegetarianism a trial is economy; and if persons would once get rid of the idea that they risk their health by making a trial, much would be done to advance the cause.  Another great reason for persons hesitating to make a trial is the revolution it would create in their households. Here again we are beset by difficulties, and these difficulties can only disappear gradually, after long years of patience. We believe the progress towards vegetarianism must of necessity be a very slow one. No large West End tradesman could possibly insist upon his whole establishment becoming vegetarians because he becomes one himself. We believe and hope that the present work will benefit those who are undergoing a slow but gradual change in their mode of living. This is easiest in small households, where no servants are kept at all, where the mistress is both cook and mother. It is in such households that the change is possible, and very often most desirable. In many cases trial will be made gradually. The great difficulty to contend with is prejudice, or, rather, we may say, habit. There are many housekeepers who feel that their bill of fare would instantly become extremely limited were they to adopt vegetarian ideas. There are few better dinners--especially for children--than a good basin of soup, with plenty of bread; yet, as a rule, there are few housekeepers who would know how to make vegetarian soup at all. In our present work we have given a list of sixty-four soups. At any rate, here is no lack of variety, as small housekeepers in this country are not famed for their knowledge of soup making, even with gravy-beef at their disposal.  On looking down this list it will be observed that in many cases cream--or, at any rate, milk--is recommended. We can well imagine the housekeeper exclaiming, \"I don't call this economy.\"  This is one point about which we consider a few words of explanation necessary. We will suppose a family of eight, who have been accustomed to live in the ordinary way, are going to have a vegetarian dinner by way of trial. Some soup has to be made, and one or two vegetables from the garden or the greengrocer's, as the case may be, are going to be cooked on a new method, and the housekeeper is horrified at the amount of butter she finds recommended for the sauce. People must, however, bear in mind that changes are gradual, and that often, at first starting, a degree of richness, or what they would consider extravagance, is advisable if they wish to _reconcile others_ to the change. In our dinner for eight we would first ask them how much meat would they have allowed a head?  At the very lowest computation, it could not have been decently done under a quarter of a pound each, even if the dish of meat took the economical form of an Irish stew; and had a joint, such as a leg of mutton, been placed upon the table, it would probably have been considerably more than double. Supposing, however, instead of the meat, we have three vegetables--say haricot beans, potatoes, and a cabbage. With the assistance of some really good butter sauce, these vegetables, eaten with bread, make an agreeable meal, which, especially in hot weather, would probably be a pleasant change. Supposing, for the sake of argument, you use half a pound of butter in making the butter sauce. This sounds, to ordinary cooks, very extravagant, even supposing butter to be only one shilling per pound. Suppose, however, this half a pound of butter is used as a means of going without a leg of mutton?  That is the chief point to be borne in mind in a variety of recipes to follow. The cream, butter, and eggs are often recommended in what will appear as wholesale quantities, but, as a set-off against this, you have no butcher's bill at all. We do not maintain that this apparently unlimited use of butter, eggs, and occasionally cream, is necessary; but we believe that there are many families who will be only able to make the change by substituting \"_nice_\" dishes, at any rate at first starting, to make up for the loss of the meat. It is only by substituting a pleasant kind of food, that many will be induced even to attempt to change. Gradually the living will become cheaper and cheaper; but it is unwise to attempt, in a family, to do too much at once.  There are many soups we have given in which cream is recommended; for instance, artichoke soup, bean soup, cauliflower soup, and celery soup. After partaking of a well-made basin of one of these soups, followed by one or two vegetables and a fruit pie or stewed fruit, there are many persons who would voluntarily remark, \"I don't seem to care for any meat.\"  On the other hand, were the vegetables served in the old-fashioned style, but without any meat, there are many who would feel that they were undergoing a species of privation, even if they did not say so--we refer to a dish of plain-boiled potatoes and dry bread, or even the ordinary cabbage served in the usual way. Supposing, however, a nice"]]]
