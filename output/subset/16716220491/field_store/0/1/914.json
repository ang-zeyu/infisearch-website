Determine normal weight by rule.  2. Multiply normal weight by number of calories needed per pound per day.  For example, say you weigh 220 or 125 lbs., but by the rule for your height your weight should be 150 lbs.; then 150 would be the number you would use.  [Sidenote: _Work Out Your Requirements_]  By the rule I have given, adults require 15-20 Calories per pound per day, depending upon activity. For example, if you have no physical activities, then take the lowest figure, 15. 150x15--2250. Therefore your requirement, if your weight should be 150, is 2250 Calories per day.  Now, if you want to lose, cut down 500-1000 Calories per day from that.  Five hundred Calories equal approximately 2 ounces of fat. Two ounces per day would be about 4 pounds per month, or 48 pounds per year. Cutting out 1000 Calories per day would equal a reduction of approximately 8 pounds per month, or 96 pounds per year. These pounds you can absolutely lose by having a knowledge of food values (calories) and regulating your intake accordingly. You can now see the importance of a knowledge of calories.

Discuss.     3  Review and More Definitions   [Sidenote: _This Is Dry but Important_]  FOOD: That which taken into the body builds and repairs tissue and yields energy in heat and muscular power.  [Sidenote: _Approx. %'s if Normal_]  CLASSES OF FOOD:       1. Protein, 18% of body weight.      2. Fats, 16% of body weight.      3. Carbohydrates, 1% of body weight.      4. Mineral matter, 5% of body weight.      5. Vitamines.      6. Water, 60% of body weight.  [Sidenote: _Nitrogenous Food Compounds_]  PROTEIN: Builds tissue, repairs waste, yields energy, and may help store fat. One-half, at least, of your protein should be from the vegetable kingdom.  A large percentage of protein is contained in       Eggs      Meat      Fowl   Fish   Nuts      Milk      Cheese     Gluten of Wheat      Legumes (beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, etc.)  [Sidenote: _Protein 113 C. Per Oz._]  There is about one-fourth ounce protein in       1 egg      1 glass milk (skim, butter, or whole)      1-1/2 oz. lean meat, or fish or fowl      1 oz. (1-1/5 cu. in.) whole milk cheese      2 slices of bread, 3-1/2 x 3-1/2 x 1/2        (white, whole wheat, corn, etc.)      3 heaping tablespoonfuls canned baked beans or lima beans      17 peanuts  [Sidenote: _255 C. Per Oz._]  FATS: Yield energy and are stored as fat.  Animal Fat: Cream, Butter, Lard  Oils: Cottonseed, Olive Almonds, Peanuts, Walnuts Chocolate, etc.  [Sidenote: _113 C. Per Oz._]  CARBOHYDRATES: Yield energy and are stored as fat.  Sugars (candy, honey, syrup, sweet fruits)  Starches (breads, cereals, potatoes, corn, legumes, nuts)  Vegetable fibre, or cellulose  MINERAL MATTER: Shares in forming bones and teeth, and is necessary for proper functioning.       Carbon   Lime  Sodium      Potassium,      Sulphur  Iron  Phosphorus  Etc.  [Sidenote: _Whole Grain Products Not Devitalized_]  These elements are contained largely in the outer coatings of grains, fruits, and vegetables, and in animal foods and their products. Do not pare potatoes before cooking. Cook vegetables in a small amount of water, saving the water for soups and sauces.  WATER: The universal solvent, absolutely necessary for life.  Contained in purest form in all vegetables and fruits. The average person needs, in addition, from three to five pints taken as a drink. If not sure of the purity, boil. Do not drink while food is in the mouth.  [Sidenote: _Absolutely Necessary for Growth_]  VITAMINES: Health preservers. Vital substances necessary for growth. The chemistry of these products is at present not thoroughly understood, but their importance has been demonstrated by experiments (not torture) on animals. By this work we know that diseases like beri-beri, scurvy, rickets, and probably pellagra, are due to a lack of these vital elements in the food, and from that fact these are called \"deficiency\" diseases.  [Sidenote: _Guinea Pigs vs. Babies_]  Of course I realize that nations can be saved from horrible diseases, and hundreds and thousands of babies saved from death, through this experimentation on a few guinea pigs and other animals; but what is the life of a baby compared with the happiness of a guinea pig? Down with animal experimentation! Let us do everything in our power to hamper scientific work of this kind. We are giving up our husbands, fathers, sons, perhaps to die, for the cause of humanity, but a guinea pig! Horrors!  It has been found that the vitamines, like the minerals, are most abundant in the outer coverings and the germ of grains, and in fruits and vegetables. They are also present in fresh milk, butter, meat and eggs. Babies fed pasteurized or boiled milk should have fruit juices and vegetable purees early. Begin with one-half teaspoonful, well diluted, and gradually increase the feeding to an ounce or more between meals once or twice daily.  Most animal fats have the vitamines, but vegetable fats are deficient in them. That is the reason cod liver oil is better for some therapeutic uses than olive oil.  [Sidenote: _Balanced Diet_]  BALANCED DIET: Should contain       10-15% Protein              (children may need more)      25-30% Fat      60-65% Carbohydrates  [Sidenote: _To Get the Elements Necessary for Health_]  For example, suppose you are a fairly active woman and need 2500 calories per day. Then for a balanced diet you would need:       10% Protein, or               250 C.      25% Fat, or                   625 C.      65% Carbohydrates            1625 C.                                   -------                                   2500 C.         250 C. of P. = 2-1/5 oz. dry protein          (250 รท 113 = 2-1/5, approximately)        625 C. of F. = 2-1/2 oz. of fat          (625 รท 255 = 2-1/2, approximately)      1625 C. of CH. = 14-1/2 oz. dry carbohydrates         (1625 รท 113 = 14-1/2, approximately)  Two and one-fifth ounces dry protein equals the approximate amount of protein in 10 ounces lean meat, fish, or fowl, or 9 ounces cheese, or 9 eggs. (You should not take all of your proteins in any of these single forms.) Two and one-half ounces fat equals approximately 5 pats of butter.  [Sidenote: _If Appetite Not Perverted_]  But listen! You don't have to bother with all this fussy stuff. _Be careful not to over-or under-eat of the proteins_, and your tastes will be a fair standard for the rest. You should remember that a balanced diet contains some of all these foods, in about the proportions given, and that, while _watery vegetables and fruits contain very few calories, they contain very important mineral salts, vitamines, and cellulose._ The latter is good for the daily scrub of the intestinal tract.  [Sidenote: _A Pretty Nearly Universal Error_]  CONSTIPATION is many times caused by a too concentrated diet, or one containing too little roughage. It has also been discovered that some individuals who are troubled with faulty elimination digest this cellulose, and only the more resistant, like bran, is not absorbed. For those, the Japanese seaweed called agaragar in the laboratory, but more familiarly known as agar by the layman, is excellent. The most industrious digestive tract apparently can not digest that. It has the further property of absorbing a large amount of water, thus increasing its bulk.  [Sidenote: _C.S._]  [Sidenote: _Have Enough Water, Else You'll Choke to Death. I Did Once_]  Mineral oils (refined paraffine) also are not absorbable, and they act with benefit in some cases. About the worst thing to do, in general, is to take physics constantly. These are not physics, however; they act mechanically. Even the C.S. (common-sense?) individual can take these. The agar may be taken two or three heaping teaspoonfuls in a large glass of water before retiring, or in the morning before breakfast, or in lieu of 4 o'clock tea. Drink it down rapidly--for goodness' sake, don't try to chew it.  Mineral oil will make fine mayonnaise dressing. It has little or no food value, so the constipated overweight individual may indulge freely. For faulty elimination, then--  1. Correct diet.  2. Exercise--especially brisk walking.  3. Regularity of habit.  4. Possibly the addition of bran, agar, or mineral oils.  5. Sweet disposition. Mean people are always constipated.   _Review_  1.

I thank you for choosing me to be your queen, and my rule shall be a happy one. My only law is, for everybody to do just what they want to, and so I pronounce the Coronation Ceremonies over.\"  Delight bowed, and sat down on her throne, while the audience applauded heartily.  Then the two Queens came down from their bowers, and Royalty gave way to the members of the Jinks Club.  \"Now, let's cut up jinks!\" cried King, capering about in his long Court robes, and looking like a very merry Monarch, indeed. \"First the May-pole dance, that'll limber us up some.\"  A May-pole had been erected near by, and from its top depended long ribbons of various colors. Each of the party took one of these ribbons, and under the direction of Miss Hart, they danced round the May-pole, weaving the ribbons in and out. It was a complicated matter at first, but they soon learned how, and wove and unwove the ribbons many times without getting tangled once. As they danced, they sang a little May song that Miss Hart had taught them, and as they danced faster and faster it became a frolic rather than a dignified rite.  At last, all out of breath they dropped on the grass, and begged Miss Hart to tell them a story.  \"I'll tell you of the origin of the May-day celebrations,\" she said. \"May-day has been a festival since very ancient times. Its reason for being is the natural feeling that comes to every one at the glad spring time. When Nature breaks out into new life and beauty, our hearts feel a sympathetic gladness, and a celebration of the spring is the natural outcome. The most primitive people felt this inclination, and they used to gather the flowers that bloomed in profusion about them, set them up, and to pay them a sort of homage, expressed in dance and song. The old Romans had what they called Floralia, or Floral Games, which began on the twenty-eighth of April, and lasted several days. Later in England, and especially in the Middle Ages, it was the custom for people of all ranks, even the Court itself, to go out early in the morning on the first of May and gather flowers. Especially did they gather hawthorn, and huge branches of this flower were brought home about sunrise, with accompaniments of pipe and tabor, and much joy and merriment. Then the people decorated their houses with the flowers they had brought. And because of this, they called this ceremony bringing Home the May, or going A-Maying, and so the hawthorn bloom itself acquired the name of May, and is often spoken of by that name. In those early days, the fairest maid of the village was crowned with flowers, and called the Queen of May; she sat in state in a little bower or arbor while her youthful courtiers danced and sang around her. But the custom of having a May Queen really dates back to the old Roman celebration when they especially worshipped the goddess Flora. Another feature of May-day was the May-pole, which was erected in all English towns and villages, and round which the people danced all day long. But these merry customs were stopped when the Puritans put an end to all such jollifications. They were revived somewhat after the restoration, but they are rarely seen nowadays except among children. But they are all pretty customs, and the whole subject will well repay reading and study. I won't continue this lecture now, but before the month of May is over, we will study in school hours some of its characteristics, and we will read the poem of the May Queen, by Lord Tennyson.\"  \"I wish you had boys in your school, Miss Hart,\" said Flip Henderson; \"you do teach the nicest way I ever heard of.\"  \"Indeed she does,\" agreed Marjorie; \"going to school to Miss Hart was like going to a party every day.\"  And then came the crowning glory of the May party. This was the feast, which was served out of doors on a table prettily decorated with vines and flowers. Dainty sandwiches were tied up with pink ribbons, and little glass cups held delicious pink lemonade. The cakes were iced with pink, the ice cream was pink, and there were pink bon-bons of various sorts. At each plate was a little pink box of candies to take home; and a souvenir for each guest in the shape of a pink fan for the girls, and pink balloons for the boys. The big balloons made much fun as they bobbed about in the air, and when the feast was over, the guests went away declaring that the Jinks Club had never had a prettier party.     CHAPTER II  A NEW PET   When Mr. Maynard came home that night he was treated to an account of the whole affair, but as two or three of the little Maynards often talked at once, the effect was sometimes unintelligible.  \"It was the loveliest party, Father,\" said Marjorie, as she hung over one arm of his chair, and arranged a somewhat large bunch of blossoms in his buttonhole.  \"Yes, it was,\" agreed Kitty, who hung on the other arm of the chair, and investigated his coat pockets in the hope of finding a box of candy or other interesting booty.  \"It sure was!\" declared King, who was sitting on a footstool near, and hugging one knee with apparently intense affection.  \"And what made it so especially delightful?\" asked Mr. Maynard, as he balanced Rosy Posy on his knee; \"you tell me, Baby.\"  \"It was a bootiful party,\" said Rosy Posy, with decision, \"because we had pink ice cream.\"  \"That _was_ about the best part,\" said Kitty, reminiscently.  \"Well, the pink ice cream part sounds delightful, I'm sure; but what was the rest of the party about?\"  \"Oh, it was a May party,\" exclaimed Marjorie, \"and we had May Queens, and a May King, and May Princesses, and everything! I do love May, don't you, Father? Everything is so bright and bloomy and Maysy. I think it is the loveliest month in the year.\"  \"Yes, it is a lovely month, Mopsy, and a good month to be out of doors. Maytime is playtime.\"  \"Yes, I know it; I made a song this morning about that. I'll sing it to you.\" And Marjorie sang for her father the little verse she had mad about Marjorie Maynard's May.  \"Huh!\" said King, \"'tisn't your May, any more than anybody else's, Midget Maynard.\"  \"No, I know it; but I like to think the May just belongs to us Maynards. Anyway we have it all. It is our May even if other people use it, too.\"  \"I don't begrudge them the use of it,\" said Kitty; \"of course, it's just as much theirs as ours.\"  \"Yes, of course,\" assented Marjorie; \"I'm only just sort of imagining, you know.\"  \"Let me help you imagine. Midget,\" said her father. \"How would you like to imagine a whole May time that was all playtime?\"  \"For all of us?\" rejoined Marjorie, her eyes dancing. \"Oh, that would be a lovely imagination! It would be like an Ourday all the time! And by the way, Father, you owe us an extra Ourday. You know we skipped one when you and Mother were down South, and it's time for another anyway. Shall we have two together?\"  \"Two together!\" cried King; \"what fun that would be! We could go off on a trip or something.\"  \"Where could we stay all night?\" asked Kitty, who was the practical one.  \"Oh, trips always have places to stay all night,\" declared King; \"let's do it, Father. What do you say?\"  \"I don't get a chance to say much of anything, among all you chatter-boxes. Rosy Posy, what do you say?\"  But the littlest Maynard was so nearly asleep that she had no voice in the matter under consideration, and at her father's suggestion, Nurse Nannie came and took her away to bed.  \"Now,\" said Mr. Maynard, \"what's all this about Ourday? And two of them together! When do you think I'm going to get my business done?\"  \"Well, but, Father, you owe them to us,\" said Marjorie, patting his cheek in her wheedlesome way. \"And you're not the kind of a business man who doesn't pay his debts, are you?\"  \"I hope not; that would be a terrible state of affairs! And so I owe you two Ourdays, do I?\"  \"Yes, one for April, and one for May.\"  It was the custom in the Maynard household to have an Ourday each month. On these occasions both Mr. and Mrs. Maynard devoted themselves all day long to the entertainment of the four children, and the four took turns in deciding what the nature of the entertainment should be. Much of the previous month their parents had been away, and the children looked forward to the celebration of the belated Ourday in connection with the one that belonged to the month of May.  \"Before we discuss the question further,\" said Mr. Maynard, \"I must tell you of something I did to-day. I adopted a new pet.\"  \"Oh, Father, what is it--a dog?\" cried Marjorie.  \"No, it isn't a dog; guess again.\"  \"A cat!\" Kitty guessed, while King said, \"A goat?\"  \"Wrong, all of you,\" said Mr. Maynard; \"now see if you can't guess it by asking twenty questions.\"  \"All right,\" said Marjorie, who was always ready for a game. \"Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?\"  \"All three; that is, it belongs to all three kingdoms.\"  \"Is it a house?\" asked Kitty.  \"No, it is not as big as a house.\"  \"Is it useful or ornamental?\" asked King.  \"Both; but its principal use is to give pleasure.\"  \"How lovely!\" cried Marjorie. \"I guess it's a fountain! Oh, Father, where are you going to put it--on the side lawn? And will it have goldfish in it, and shiny stones, and green water plants growing in it?\"  \"Wait a minute, Mops; don't go so fast! You see, it isn't a fountain, and if you should put water and goldfish in it, you'd spoil it entirely.\"  \"And any way, Father,\" said King, \"you said it was a pet, didn't you?\"  \"Yes, my boy, a sort of pet.\"  \"Can it talk?\"  \"No, it can't talk.\"  \"Oh, I made sure it was a talking machine. What kind of a sound does it make?\"  \"Well, it purrs sometimes.\"  \"Then it is a kitten after all,\" cried Kitty.  \"No, it isn't a kitten. It's bigger than a kitten.\"  \"An old cat!\" said Marjorie, scornfully.  \"Pooh,\" said King, \"we'll never get at it this way. Of course it isn't a cat! Father wouldn't make so much fuss over just a cat.\"  \"But "]]]
