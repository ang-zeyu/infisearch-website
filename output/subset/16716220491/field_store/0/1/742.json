It was some sort of a large bag, of an ancient frieze-like material, and when unfolded it occupied the greater part of the small kitchen floor. In shape it was an irregular, a very irregular, triangle, and it had a couple of wide flaps, with the remains of straps and buckles. The patch that had been uppermost in the folding was of a faded yellowish brown; but the rest of it was of shades of crimson that varied according to the exposure of the parts of it.  \"Now whatever can that have been?\" Oleron mused as he stood surveying it.... \"I give it up. Whatever it is, it's settled my work for today, I'm afraid--\"  He folded the object up carelessly and thrust it into a corner of the kitchen; then, taking pans and brushes and an old knife, he returned to the sitting-room and began to scrape and to wash and to line with paper his newly discovered receptacles. When he had finished, he put his spare boots and books and papers into them; and he closed the lids again, amused with his little adventure, but also a little anxious for the hour to come when he should settle fairly down to his work again.   III  It piqued Oleron a little that his friend, Miss Bengough, should dismiss with a glance the place he himself had found so singularly winning. Indeed she scarcely lifted her eyes to it. But then she had always been more or less like that--a little indifferent to the graces of life, careless of appearances, and perhaps a shade more herself when she ate biscuits from a paper bag than when she dined with greater observance of the convenances. She was an unattached journalist of thirty-four, large, showy, fair as butter, pink as a dog-rose, reminding one of a florist's picked specimen bloom, and given to sudden and ample movements and moist and explosive utterances. She \"pulled a better living out of the pool\" (as she expressed it) than Oleron did; and by cunningly disguised puffs of drapers and haberdashers she \"pulled\" also the greater part of her very varied wardrobe. She left small whirlwinds of air behind her when she moved, in which her veils and scarves fluttered and spun.  Oleron heard the flurry of her skirts on his staircase and her single loud knock at his door when he had been a month in his new abode. Her garments brought in the outer air, and she flung a bundle of ladies' journals down on a chair.  \"Don't knock off for me,\" she said across a mouthful of large-headed hatpins as she removed her hat and veil. \"I didn't know whether you were straight yet, so I've brought some sandwiches for lunch. You've got coffee, I suppose?--No, don't get up--I'll find the kitchen--\"  \"Oh, that's all right, I'll clear these things away. To tell the truth, I'm rather glad to be interrupted,\" said Oleron.  He gathered his work together and put it away. She was already in the kitchen; he heard the running of water into the kettle. He joined her, and ten minutes later followed her back to the sitting-room with the coffee and sandwiches on a tray. They sat down, with the tray on a small table between them.  \"Well, what do you think of the new place?\" Oleron asked as she poured out coffee.  \"Hm!... Anybody'd think you were going to get married, Paul.\"  He laughed.  \"Oh no. But it's an improvement on some of them, isn't it?\"  \"Is it? I suppose it is; I don't know. I liked the last place, in spite of the black ceiling and no watertap. How's _Romilly_?\"  Oleron thumbed his chin.  \"Hm! I'm rather ashamed to tell you. The fact is, I've not got on very well with it. But it will be all right on the night, as you used to say.\"  \"Stuck?\"  \"Rather stuck.\"  \"Got any of it you care to read to me?...\"  Oleron had long been in the habit of reading portions of his work to Miss Bengough occasionally. Her comments were always quick and practical, sometimes directly useful, sometimes indirectly suggestive. She, in return for his confidence, always kept all mention of her own work sedulously from him. His, she said, was \"real work\"; hers merely filled space, not always even grammatically.  \"I'm afraid there isn't,\" Oleron replied, still meditatively dry-shaving his chin. Then he added, with a little burst of candour, \"The fact is, Elsie, I've not written--not actually written--very much more of it--_any_ more of it, in fact. But, of course, that doesn't mean I haven't progressed. I've progressed, in one sense, rather alarmingly. I'm now thinking of reconstructing the whole thing.\"  Miss Bengough gave a gasp. \"Reconstructing!\"  \"Making Romilly herself a different type of woman. Somehow, I've begun to feel that I'm not getting the most out of her. As she stands, I've certainly lost interest in her to some extent.\"  \"But--but--\" Miss Bengough protested, \"you had her so real, so _living_, Paul!\"  Oleron smiled faintly. He had been quite prepared for Miss Bengough's disapproval. He wasn't surprised that she liked Romilly as she at present existed; she would. Whether she realised it or not, there was much of herself in his fictitious creation. Naturally Romilly would seem \"real,\" \"living,\" to her....  \"But are you really serious, Paul?\" Miss Bengough asked presently, with a round-eyed stare.  \"Quite serious.\"  \"You're really going to scrap those fifteen chapters?\"  \"I didn't exactly say that.\"  \"That fine, rich love-scene?\"  \"I should only do it reluctantly, and for the sake of something I thought better.\"  \"And that beautiful, _beau_tiful description of Romilly on the shore?\"  \"It wouldn't necessarily be wasted,\" he said a little uneasily.  But Miss Bengough made a large and windy gesture, and then let him have it.  \"Really, you are _too_ trying!\" she broke out. \"I do wish sometimes you'd remember you're human, and live in a world! You know I'd be the _last_ to wish you to lower your standard one inch, but it wouldn't be lowering it to bring it within human comprehension. Oh, you're sometimes altogether too godlike!... Why, it would be a wicked, criminal waste of your powers to destroy those fifteen chapters! Look at it reasonably, now. You've been working for nearly twenty years; you've now got what you've been working for almost within your grasp; your affairs are at a most critical stage (oh, don't tell me; I know you're about at the end of your money); and here you are, deliberately proposing to withdraw a thing that will probably make your name, and to substitute for it something that ten to one nobody on earth will ever want to read--and small blame to them! Really, you try my patience!\"  Oleron had shaken his head slowly as she had talked. It was an old story between them. The noisy, able, practical journalist was an admirable friend--up to a certain point; beyond that ... well, each of us knows that point beyond which we stand alone. Elsie Bengough sometimes said that had she had one-tenth part of Oleron's genius there were few things she could not have done--thus making that genius a quantitatively divisible thing, a sort of ingredient, to be added to or subtracted from in the admixture of his work. That it was a qualitative thing, essential, indivisible, informing, passed her comprehension. Their spirits parted company at that point. Oleron knew it. She did not appear to know it.  \"Yes, yes, yes,\" he said a little wearily, by-and-by, \"practically you're quite right, entirely right, and I haven't a word to say. If I could only turn _Romilly_ over to you you'd make an enormous success of her. But that can't be, and I, for my part, am seriously doubting whether she's worth my while. You know what that means.\"  \"What does it mean?\" she demanded bluntly.  \"Well,\" he said, smiling wanly, \"what _does_ it mean when you're convinced a thing isn't worth doing? You simply don't do it.\"  Miss Bengough's eyes swept the ceiling for assistance against this impossible man.  \"What utter rubbish!\" she broke out at last. \"Why, when I saw you last you were simply oozing _Romilly_; you were turning her off at the rate of four chapters a week; if you hadn't moved you'd have had her three-parts done by now. What on earth possessed you to move right in the middle of your most important work?\"  Oleron tried to put her off with a recital of inconveniences, but she wouldn't have it. Perhaps in her heart she partly suspected the reason. He was simply mortally weary of the narrow circumstances of his life. He had had twenty years of it--twenty years of garrets and roof-chambers and dingy flats and shabby lodgings, and he was tired of dinginess and shabbiness. The reward was as far off as ever--or if it was not, he no longer cared as once he would have cared to put out his hand and take it. It is all very well to tell a man who is at the point of exhaustion that only another effort is required of him; if he cannot make it he is as far off as ever....  \"Anyway,\" Oleron summed up, \"I'm happier here than I've been for a long time. That's some sort of a justification.\"  \"And doing no work,\" said Miss Bengough pointedly.  At that a trifling petulance that had been gathering in Oleron came to a head.  \"And why should I do nothing but work?\" he demanded. \"How much happier am I for it? I don't say I don't love my work--when it's done; but I hate doing it. Sometimes it's an intolerable burden that I simply long to be rid of. Once in many weeks it has a moment, one moment, of glow and thrill for me; I remember the days when it was all glow and thrill; and now I'm forty-four, and it's becoming drudgery. Nobody wants it; I'm ceasing to want it myself; and if any ordinary sensible man were to ask me whether I didn't think I was a fool to go on, I think I should agree that I was.\"  Miss Bengough's comely pink face was serious.  \"But you knew all that, many, many years ago, Paul--and still you chose it,\" she said in a low voice.  \"Well, and how should I have known?\" he demanded. \"I didn't know. I was told so. My heart, if you like, told me so, and I thought I knew.

When they had reached the back-stairs Susy whispered, \"O, Norah is up and gone down. I hear her in the kitchen. 'Sh! 'Sh!\"  Susy thought there was no time to be lost, and she would have rushed down stairs, two steps at a time, but her little sister was exactly in the way.  \"Somebody has been and tugged my little chair up here,\" said Prudy, \"and I must tug it back again.\"  So in the dim light the two children groped their way down stairs, Prudy going first with the chair.  \"O, what a little snail! Hurry--can't you?\" said Susy, impatiently; \"Norah'll be gone! What's the use of our waking up in the night if we can't say Merry Christmas to anybody?\"  \"Well, _ain't_ I a-hurryin' now?\" exclaimed Prudy, plunging forward and falling, chair and all, the whole length of the stairs.  All the house was awake now, for Prudy screamed lustily. Grandma Read called out from the passage-way,--  \"O, little Prudence, has thee broken thy neck?\"  Mrs. Parlin rushed out, too frightened to speak, and Mr. Parlin ran down stairs, and took Prudy up in his arms.  \"It was--you--did it--Susy Parlin,\" sobbed the child. \"I shouldn't--have--fell, if you--hadn't--have--screamed.\"  The poor little girl spoke slowly and with difficulty, as if she dropped a bucket into her full heart, and drew up the words one at a time.  \"O, mother, I know it was me,\" said Susy meekly; \"and I was careless, and it was all in the dark. I'm sure I hope Prudy'll forgive me.\"  \"No, it wasn't you, neither,\" said Prudy, whose good humor was restored the moment Susy had made what she considered due confession. \"You never touched me, Susy! It was the _chair_; and I love you just as dearly as ever I did.\"  Prudy lay on the sofa for some time, looking quite pale by the gas-light, while her mother rubbed her side, and the rest of the family stood looking at her with anxious faces.  It was quite an important occasion for Prudy, who always liked to be the centre of attraction.  \"O, mamma,\" said she, closing her eyes languidly, \"when the room makes believe whirl round, does it _truly_ whirl round?\"  The truth was, she felt faint and dizzy, though only for a short time.  \"I wish,\" said she, \"it had been somebody else that fell down stairs, and not me, for I didn't go down easy! The _prongs_ of the chair pushed right into my side.\"  But it did not appear that Prudy was much injured, after all. In a few minutes she was skipping about the room almost as nimbly as ever, only stopping to groan every now and then, when she happened to think of it.  \"It is a wonder,\" said Mr. Parlin, \"that more children are not lamed for life by such accidents.\"  \"I have often thought of it,\" said aunt Madge. \"Some little ones seem to be making hair-breadth escapes almost every day of their lives. I believe Prudy would have been in her grave long ago, if it had not been for her guardian angel.\"  The long-expected Christmas had come at last, and Prudy had stumbled into it, as she stumbled into everything else. But it is an ill wind which blows no good to anybody; and it so happened that in all this confusion Susy was able to \"wish a Merry Christmas\" to Norah, and to the whole family besides.  When Mrs. Parlin found that the children were too thoroughly awake to go to sleep again that morning, she told them they might dress themselves in the parlor if they would keep as quiet as possible, and let the rest of the household take another nap.  It all seemed very strange and delightful to the little girls. It was like another sort of life, this new arrangement of stealing about the house in the silent hours before daybreak. Susy thought she should like to sit up all night, and sleep all day, if the mayor would only hush the streets; it would be so odd!  \"O, how dark the clouds are!\" said Prudy, peeping out of the window; \"it _fogs_ so I can't see a single thing. Susy, I'm going to keep _at watch_ of the sky. Don't you s'pose, though, 'twill be Christmas all the same, if there's a snow storm?\"  \"There's been snow,\" said Susy, \"all in the night. Look down at the pavement. Don't you wish that was frosted cake?\"  \"O, the snow came in the night, so not to wake us up,\" cried Prudy, clapping her hands; \"but it wouldn't have waked us, you know, even in the night, for it came so still.\"  \"But why don't the clouds go off?\" she added, sadly.  \"I don't know,\" replied Susy; \"perhaps they are waiting till the sun comes and smiles them away.\"  Such happy children as these were, as they sat peeping out of the window at the dull gray sky!  They did not know that a great mischief was begun that morning--a mischief which was no larger yet than \"a midge's wing.\" They were watching the clouds for a snow storm; but they never dreamed of such things as clouds of _trouble_, which grow darker and darker, and which even the beautiful Christmas sun cannot \"smile away.\"     CHAPTER III.  SUSY'S CHRISTMAS.   It was bright and beautiful all day, and then, when no one could possibly wait any longer, it was Christmas evening. The coal glowed in the grate with a splendid blaze: all the gas-burners were lighted, and so were everybody's eyes. If one had listened, one might have heard, from out of doors, a joyful tinkling of sleigh-bells; yet I fancy nobody could have told whether the streets were still or noisy, or whether the sky had a moon in it or not; for nobody was quiet long enough to notice.  But by and by, when the right time had come, the folding-doors were opened, just like the two covers to a Christmas fairy book. Then, in a second, it was so still you might have heard a pin drop.  Such a funny little old gentleman had arrived: his face alive with dimples, and smiles, and wrinkles. His cheeks were as red and round as winter apples, and where there wasn't a wrinkle there was a dimple; and no doubt there was a dimple in his chin, and his chin maybe was double, only you couldn't tell, for it was hidden ever so deep under a beard as white as a snow-drift.  He walked along, tottering under the weight of a huge pack full of presents. He extended his small arms towards the audience most affectionately, and you could see that his antiquated coat-sleeves were bristling with toys and glistening with ornaments. His eyes twinkled with fun, and his mouth, which seemed nearly worn out with laughing, grew bigger every minute.  It took the dear old gentleman some time to clear his throat; but when he had found his voice, which at first was as fine as a knitting-needle, and all of a tremble, he made  THE SPEECH OF SANTA CLAUS.  \"How do, my darlings? How do, all round? Bless your little hearts, how do you all do? Did they tell ye Santa wasn't a-comin', my dears? Did your grandpas and grandmas say, 'Humph! there isn't any such a person.' My love to the good old people. I know they mean all right; but tell them they'll have to give it up now!\"  (Here Santa Claus made a low bow. Everybody laughed and clapped; but Prudy whispered, \"O, don't he look old all over? What has he done with his _teeth_? O, dear, has anybody pulled 'em out?\")  \"Yes, my dears,\" continued the old gentleman, encouraged by the applause,--\"yes, my dears, here I am, as jolly as ever! But bless your sweet little hearts, I've had a terrible time getting here! The wind has been blowin' me up as fierce as you please, and I've been shook round as if I wasn't of more account than a kernel of corn in a popper!  \"O, O, I've been ducked up to the chin in some awful deep snow-drifts, up there by the North Pole! This is the very first time the storms have come so heavy as to cover over the end of the North Pole! But this year they had to dig three days before they could find it. O, ho!  \"I was a-wanderin' round all last night; a real shivery night, too! Got so _broke up_, there's nothing left of me but small pieces. O, hum!  \"Such a time as I had in some of those chimneys, you haven't any idee! Why, if you'll believe me, over there in Iceland somebody forgot to clear out the chimney, and there I stuck fast, like a fish-bone in your throat; couldn't be picked out, couldn't be swallowed!  \"The funniest time that was! How I laughed! And then the children's mother woke up, and, 'O, dear,' said she; 'hear the wind sigh down the chimney!' 'Only me,' says I; 'and I've caught you napping this time!' She helped me out, and when I had caught my breath, I climbed out the window; but, deary me, I shouldn't wonder if that very woman went to sleep again, and thought it was all a dream! Heigh-ho! that's the way they always treat poor Santa Claus nowadays.\"  (Here the children laughed, and Susy said, \"I guess he must have bumped his nose against that chimney: see what a hump!\")  \"O, O, don't you make sport of me, children! My nose is big, to be sure, but I'm going to keep it and make the best of it! If you love Santa as he loves you, you wouldn't mind the looks. I _was_ going to change my coat and dickey; but then, thinks I, I'll come just as I am! I patted myself on the shoulder, and says I, 'Santa Claus, don't you fret if you _are_ growin' old! You may look a little dried up, but your heart isn't wrinkled; O no!' You see father Adam and me was very near of an age, but somehow I never growed up! I always thought big folks did very well in their place; but for my part, give me the children. Hurrah for the children!\"  (Great clapping and laughing.)  \"I tell you, darlings, I haven't forgot a single one of you. My pockets are running over. I've been preparing presents for you ever since last fall, when the birds broke up housekeeping.  \"Here's a tippet for the Prudy girl, and she may have it for nothing; and they are cheaper 'n that, if you take 'em by the quantity.  \"I'm a walkin' book-case. Why, I've brought stories and histories enough to set up a store! I've got more nuts than you can shake a hammer at; but I think there's more bark to 'em than there is bite. O, O, I find I can't crack 'em with my teeth, as I used to a hundred years ago!  \"But my dear, sweet, cunning little hearers, I must be a-goin"]]]
