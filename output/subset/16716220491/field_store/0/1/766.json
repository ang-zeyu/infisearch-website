Big corporations are all right on enforcing morality until it hits their dividends too hard.  Then you'll find that the directors will be urging us to let gambling go on again if the laborers insist on having it.\"  \"Well, we won't have gambling in the camp, anyway,\" Harry retorted stubbornly.  \"We're simply looking after the interests of the men themselves.  I wonder why they can't see it, and act like men, not fools.\"  \"We're going to stop the gambling, and keep it stopped,\" Tom went on, his jaws setting firmly together.  \"But, Harry, we're going to have a big row on our hands, and various attempts against the company's property will be made.\"  \"If the company's officers order us to let up on the gambling,\" proposed Harry, \"we can resign and get out of this business altogether.\"  \"We won't resign, and we won't knuckle down to any lot of swindlers either, Harry!\" cried Tom.  \"Some one is fighting us, and this wreck of a sea-wall is the first proof.  All right!  If any one wants to fight us he shall find that we know how to fight back, and that we can hit hard.  Harry, from this minute on we're after those crooks, and we'll make them realize that there's some sting to us!\"  \"Good enough!\" cheered Hazelton.  \"I like that old-time fight talk!  But are you going to do anything to protect the wall to-night, Tom?\"  \"I am,\" announced the young chief engineer.  \"What's the plan?\"  \"Let me think,\" urged Reade.  \"Now, I believe, I have it.  We'll send one of the motor boats out here, with a foreman and four laborers.  They can arm themselves with clubs and patrol the water on both sides of the wall. The 'Thomas Morton' has a small search-light on her that will be of use in keeping a close eye over the wall.\"  \"That ought to stop the nonsense,\" Harry nodded.  \"But I don't imagine that any further efforts to destroy the wall will be made tonight, anyway.\"  \"We'll have the night patrol out _every_ night after this,\" Tom declared. \"But I'm not so sure either, that another effort won't be made to-night, if we don't put a watch on to stop this wicked business.  Harry, do you mind remaining out here while I run back and get the boat out?\"  \"Why should I mind?\" Hazelton wanted to know.  \"Well, I didn't know whether you would, or not---after seeing that imaginary something behind you.\"  \"Don't laugh at me!  I may have had a start, but you ought to be the first to know, Tom, that I haven't frozen feet.\"  \"I do know it, Harry.  You've been through too many perils to be suspected of cowardice.  Well, then, I'll run back.\"  Tom Reade had really intended to leave the flash lamp with his chum, but he forgot to do so, and, as he jogged steadily along over the wall he threw the light ahead of him.  As he got nearer shore Tom increased his jog to a brisk run.  Once, on the way, he passed the prowling negro without knowing it.  That huge fellow, seeing the ray of light come steadily near him, hesitated for a few moments, then took to the water, swimming well out.  After Reade had passed, the fellow swam in toward the wall.  Up on the wall climbed the negro.  For a few minutes he crouched there, shaking the water from his garments.  Then, cautiously, he began to crawl forward.  \"Boss Reade, he done gone in,\" muttered the prowler.  \"Boss Hazelton, Ah reckon he's mah poultry!\"  Harry, keeping his lone vigil away out on the narrow retaining wall, was growing sleepy.  He had nearly forgotten his scare.  Indeed, he was inclined to look upon it as a trick of his own brain.     CHAPTER II  THE CALL OF ONE IN TROUBLE   Once Tom Reade reached the solid land he let his long legs out into a brisk run.  With his years of practice on the Gridley High School athletic team he was not one to lose his wind readily.  So he made his way at the same speed all the way up to the camp.  \"Who dar?\" called a negro watchman, as Tom raced up to the outskirts of the camp.  \"Reade, chief engineer,\" Tom called, then wheeled and made off to the right, where the more substantial barracks of the foremen stood. Superintendent Renshaw lived in a two-story barrack still farther to the right, as the guest of the young engineers.  \"_Quien vive_?\" (who's there?) hailed another voice, between the two barracks buildings.  \"So, Nicolas, you rascal, you haven't gone to bed?\" demanded Tom, halting. \"What did I tell you about earlier hours?\"  Nicolas was the young Mexican servant whom Tom and Harry had brought back with them from Mexico.  Readers of the previous volume know all about this faithful fellow.  \"You and Senor Hazelton, you waire not in bed,\" replied Nicolas stolidly.  \"You're not expected to stay up and watch over us as if we were babies, Nicolas,\" spoke Tom, in a gentler voice.  \"You'd better turn in now.\"  \"Senor Hazelton, where is he?\" insisted Nicolas, anxiously.  \"Oh, bother!  Never mind where he is,\" Tom rejoined.  \"We won't either of us be in for a little while yet.  But you turn in now---at once---instanter!\"  Then Tom bounded over to the little porch before the foremen's barracks, where he pounded lustily on the door.  \"Who's there?  What's wanted?\" demanded a sleepy voice from the inside.  \"Is that you, Evarts?\" called Reade.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Get on your duds and turn out as quickly as you can.\"  \"You want me?\" yawned Evarts.  \"Now, see here, my man, if I didn't want you why on earth would I call you out in the middle of the night?\"  \"It's late,\" complained Evarts.  \"I know it.  That's why I want you to get behind yourself and push yourself,\" retorted the young chief engineer energetically.  \"Hustle!\"  Twice, while he waited impatiently, Tom kicked the toe of one boot against the door to emphasize the need of haste.  Other drowsy voices remonstrated.  \"Hang a man who has to sleep _all_ the time!\" grunted Tom Reade.  After several minutes the door opened, and a lanky, loose-jointed, lantern-jawed man of some forty-odd years stepped out.  \"Well, what's up, Mr. Reade?\" questioned the foreman, hiding a yawn behind a bony, hairy hand.  \"You are, at last, thank goodness!\" Tom exclaimed.  \"Evarts, I want you to rout out four good men.  Lift 'em to their feet and begin to throw the clothes on 'em!\"  \"It's pretty late to call men out of their beds, sir,\" mildly objected the foreman.  \"No---it's early, but it can't be helped,\" Tom Reade retorted.  \"Hustle 'em out!\"  \"Black or white?\" sleepily inquired Evarts.  \"White, and Americans at that,\" Tom retorted.  \"Put none but Americans on guard tonight, Evarts!  What do you suppose has happened?\"  \"Can't guess.\"  \"No!  You're still too sleepy.  Evarts, some scoundrels have blown out a good part of our wall yonder.\"  \"Are you joking, Mr. Reade?\"  \"No, sir; I am not.  Dynamite must have been used.  Hazelton and I heard the noise of the blast, but of course we got out there too late to catch any miscreant at the job.\"  Evarts, at first, was inclined to regard the news with mild disbelief, but he soon realized that something must have happened very nearly as the young chief engineer had described.  \"Well, what are you standing there for?\" Tom demanded, impatiently.  \"Are you going to wait for daylight?  Get the four men out---all Americans, mind you.  _Hustle_, man!\"  Evarts started away; toward the camp over to the left of them.  As he did so Tom darted in another direction.  Two minutes later Tom was back, piloting by one arm a man who was still engaged in rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.  This was Conlon, engineer of the motor boat, \"Morton.\"  \"Where's Evarts?\" Reade queried, impatiently.  \"Oh, Evarts!  Where are you, and what are you doing?\"  \"Trying to get four men awake,\" bawled back the voice of the foreman, from the distance.  \"As soon as I get one man on his feet the other three have sunk back to sleep.\"  \"Wait until I get over there then!\" called Tom, striding forward.  \"Come along, Conlon!  Don't you lag on me.\"  \"There!  Do you fellows reckon you want Mr. Reade to bump in here and shake you out?\" sounded the warning voice of Evarts.  As Tom and the motor boat's engine tender reached the little, box-like shack from which Evarts's tones proceeded, four men, seated on the floor, were seen to be lacing their shoes by the dim light of a lantern.  \"A nice lot you are!\" called Tom crisply.  \"How many hours does it take you to get awake when you're called in the middle of the night?\"  \"This overtime warn't in the agreement,\" sleepily retorted one of the men.  \"You're wrong there,\" Reade informed him, vehemently.  \"Overtime _is_ in the agreement for every man in this camp when it's wanted of him---from the chief engineer all along the line.  Now, you men oblige me by hustling. I don't want to wait more than sixty seconds for the last man of you.\"  \"I've a good mind to crawl back into my bunk,\" growled another of the men.  \"All right,\" retorted Tom Reade, with suspicious cheerfulness.  \"Try it and see what kind of fireworks I carry concealed on my person.  Or, just lag a little bit on me, and you'll see the same thing.  Men, do you realize that there's foul play afoot out on the retaining wall?  We've got to go out there in time to stop anything more happening.  Now, you've got your shoes on; grab the rest of your clothing and hustle it on as we make for the beach.  Come along!\"  Tom fairly got behind the men and pushed them outside.  They would have liked to complain, but they didn't.  Some of them were larger and heavier than the chief engineer, but they knew quite well that, at sign of any trifling mutiny to-night, Reade would thrash them all.

But if you had been near enough to have seen his keen eyes, you would never have suspected him of even thinking of a nap. Just as soon as he felt sure that the two little brown-coated scamps were out of sight, he stretched his long neck up until he was almost twice as tall as he had been a minute before. He looked this way and that way to make sure that no danger was near, spread his great wings, flapped heavily up into the air, and then, with his head once more tucked back between his shoulders and his long legs straight out behind him, he flew out over the Green Meadows, and making a big circle, headed straight for the Smiling Pool.  All this time Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter had not been so far away as Longlegs supposed. They had been hiding where they could watch him, and the instant he spread his wings, they started back up the Laughing Brook towards the Smiling Pool to see what would happen there. You see they knew perfectly well that Longlegs was flying up to the Smiling Pool in the hope that he could catch Grandfather Frog for his breakfast. They didn't really mean that any harm should come to Grandfather Frog, but they meant that he should have a great fright. You see, they were like a great many other people, so heedless and thoughtless that they thought it fun to frighten others.  \"Of course we'll waken Grandfather Frog in time for him to get away with nothing more than a great scare,\" said Little Joe Otter, as they hurried along. \"It will be such fun to see his big goggly eyes pop out when he opens them and sees Longlegs just ready to gobble him up! And won't Longlegs be hopping mad when we cheat him out of the breakfast he is so sure he is going to have!\"  They reached the Smiling Pool before Longlegs, who had taken a roundabout way, and they hid among the bulrushes where they could see and not be seen.  \"There's the old fellow just as I left him, fast asleep,\" whispered Billy Mink.  Sure enough, there on his big green lily-pad sat Grandfather Frog with his eyes shut. At least, they seemed to be shut. And over on top of his big house sat Jerry Muskrat. Jerry seemed to be too busy opening a fresh-water clam to notice anything else; but the truth is he was watching all that was going on. You see, he had suspected that Billy Mink was going to play some trick on Grandfather Frog, so he had warned him. When he had seen Longlegs coming towards the Smiling Pool, he had given Grandfather Frog another warning, and he knew that now he was only pretending to be asleep.  Straight up to the Smiling Pool came Longlegs the Blue Heron, and on the very edge of it, among the bulrushes, he dropped his long legs and stood with his toes in the water, his long neck stretched up so that he could look all over the Smiling Pool. There, just as Little Joe Otter had said, sat Grandfather Frog on his big green lily-pad, fast asleep. At least, he seemed to be fast asleep. The eyes of Longlegs sparkled with hunger and the thought of what a splendid breakfast Grandfather Frog would make. Very slowly, putting each foot down as carefully as he knew how, Longlegs began to walk along the shore so as to get opposite the big green lily-pad where Grandfather Frog was sitting. And over in the bulrushes on the other side, Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink nudged each other and clapped their hands over their mouths to keep from laughing aloud.     IV  THE PATIENCE OF LONGLEGS THE BLUE HERON    Patience often wins the day   When over-haste has lost the way.   If there is one virtue which Longlegs the Heron possesses above another it is patience. Yes, Sir, Longlegs certainly has got patience. He believes that if a thing is worth having, it is worth waiting for, and that if he waits long enough, he is sure to get it. Perhaps that is because he has been a fisherman all his life, and his father and his grandfather were fishermen. You know a fisherman without patience rarely catches anything. Of course Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter laugh at this and say that it isn't so, but the truth is they sometimes go hungry when they wouldn't if they had a little of the patience of Longlegs.  Now Grandfather Frog is another who is very, very patient. He can sit still the longest time waiting for something to come to him. Indeed, he can sit perfectly still so long, and Longlegs can stand perfectly still so long, that Jerry Muskrat and Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter have had many long disputes as to which of the two can keep still the longest.  \"He will make a splendid breakfast,\" thought Longlegs, as very, very carefully he walked along the edge of the Smiling Pool so as to get right opposite Grandfather Frog. There he stopped and looked very hard at Grandfather Frog. Yes, he certainly must be asleep, for his eyes were closed. Longlegs chuckled to himself right down inside without making a sound, and got ready to wade out so as to get within reach.  Now all the time Grandfather Frog was doing some quiet chuckling himself. You see, he wasn't asleep at all. He was just pretending to be asleep, and all the time he was watching Longlegs out of a corner of one of his big goggly eyes. Very, very slowly and carefully, so as not to make the teeniest, weeniest sound, Longlegs lifted one foot to wade out into the Smiling Pool. Grandfather Frog pretended to yawn and opened his big goggly eyes. Longlegs stood on one foot without moving so much as a feather. Grandfather Frog yawned again, nodded as if he were too sleepy to keep awake, and half closed his eyes. Longlegs waited and waited. Then, little by little, so slowly that if you had been there you would hardly have seen him move, he drew his long neck down until his head rested on his shoulders.  \"I guess I must wait until he falls sound asleep again,\" said Longlegs to himself.  But Grandfather Frog didn't go to sleep. He would nod and nod and then, just when Longlegs would make up his mind that this time he really was asleep, open would pop Grandfather Frog's eyes. So all the long morning Longlegs stood on one foot without moving, watching and waiting and growing hungrier and hungrier, and all the long morning Grandfather Frog sat on his big green lily-pad, pretending that he was oh, so sleepy, and all the time having such a comfortable sun-bath and rest, for very early he had had a good breakfast of foolish green flies.  Over in the bulrushes on the other side of the Smiling Pool two little scamps in brown bathing suits waited and watched for the great fright they had planned for Grandfather Frog, when they had sent Longlegs to try to catch him. They were Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter. At first they laughed to themselves and nudged each other at the thought of the trick they had played. Then, as nothing happened, they began to grow tired and uneasy. You see they do not possess patience. Finally they gave up in disgust and stole away to find some more exciting sport. Grandfather Frog saw them go and chuckled harder than ever to himself.     V  GRANDFATHER FROG JUMPS JUST IN TIME   Back and forth over the Green Meadows sailed Whitetail the Marsh Hawk. Like Longlegs the Blue Heron, he was hungry. His sharp eyes peered down among the grasses, looking for something to eat, but some good fairy seemed to have warned the very little people who live there that Whitetail was out hunting. Perhaps it was one of Old Mother West Wind's children, the Merry Little Breezes. You know they are always flitting about trying to do some one a good turn.    They love to dance and romp and play   From dawn to dusk the livelong day,   But more than this they love to find     A chance to do some favor kind.  Anyway, little Mr. Green Snake seemed to know that Whitetail was out hunting and managed to keep out of sight. Danny Meadow Mouse wasn't to be found. Only a few foolish grasshoppers rewarded his patient search, and these only served to make him feel hungrier than ever. But old Whitetail has a great deal of persistence, and in spite of his bad luck, he kept at his hunting, back and forth, back and forth, until he had been all over the Green Meadows. At last he made up his mind that he was wasting time there.  \"I'll just have a look over at the Smiling Pool, and if there is nothing there, I'll take a turn or two along the Big River,\" thought he and straightway started for the Smiling Pool. Long before he reached it, his keen eyes saw Longlegs the Blue Heron standing motionless on the edge of it, and he knew by the looks of Longlegs that he was watching something which he hoped to catch.  \"If it's a fish,\" thought Whitetail, \"it will do me no good, for I am no fisherman. But if it's a Frog--well, Frogs are not as good eating as fat Meadow Mice, but they are very filling.\"  With that he hurried a little faster, and then he saw what Longlegs was watching so intently. It was, as you know, Grandfather Frog sitting on his big green lily-pad. Old Whitetail gave a great sigh of satisfaction. Grandfather Frog certainly would be very filling, very filling, indeed.  Now Longlegs the Blue Heron was so intently watching Grandfather Frog that he saw nothing else, and Grandfather Frog was so busy watching Longlegs that he quite forgot that there might be other dangers. Besides, his back was toward old Whitetail. Of course Whitetail saw this, and it made him almost chuckle aloud. Ever so many times he had tried to catch Grandfather Frog, but always Grandfather Frog had seen him long before he could get near him.  Now, with all his keen sight, old Whitetail had failed to see some one else who was sitting right in plain sight. He had failed because his mind was so full of Grandfather Frog and Longlegs that he forgot to look around, as he usually does. Just skimming the tops of the bulrushes he sailed swiftly out over the Smiling Pool and reached down with his great, cruel claws to clutch Grandfather Frog, who sat there pretending to be asleep, but all the time watching Longlegs and deep down inside chuckling to think how he was"]]]
