In all the strenuous life and immense wealth of this great city, to which European enterprise first gave and still gives the chief impulse, Indians are taking an increasing share. The Bengalees themselves still hold very much aloof from modern developments of trade and industry, but they were the first to appreciate the value of Western education, and the Calcutta University with all its shortcomings has maintained the high position which Lord Dalhousie foreshadowed for it nearly seventy years ago. In art and literature the modern Bengalee has often known how to borrow from the West without sacrificing either his own originality or the traditions of his race or the spirit of his creed. Some of the finest Bengalee brains have taken for choice to the legal profession and have abundantly justified themselves both as judges in the highest court of the province and as barristers and pleaders. In every branch of the public services open to Indians and in all the liberal professions, as well as in the civic and political life of their country, the Bengalees have played a leading part, not restricted even to their own province, and in the very distinguished person of Lord Sinha, Bengal has just provided for the first time an Indian to represent the King-Emperor as governor of a province--the neighbouring province of Behar and Orissa. Nor have the women of Bengal been left behind as in so many other parts of India. In Calcutta many highly educated ladies have won such complete release from the ancient restraints imposed upon their sex that they preside to-day over refined and cultured homes from which the subtle atmosphere of the East does not exclude the ease and freedom of Western habits of mind and body.  Yet these are still exceptions, and even in such a progressive city as Calcutta and even amongst the highest classes the social and domestic life of the majority of Hindus is still largely governed by the laws of Hinduism, and not least with regard to marriage and the seclusion of women. I was once allowed to attend a sort of \"scripture lesson\" for little high-caste Hindu girls, organised by a benevolent old Brahman lady, who has devoted herself to the cause of infant education on orthodox lines. None of these 40 or 50 little girls had of course reached the age, usually ten, at which they would be cut off from all contact with the other sex except in marriage. They had bright and happy faces, and as it was a Hindu festival most of them were decked out in all their finery with gold and silver bangles on their dainty arms and ankles, sometimes with jewelled nose-rings as well as ear-rings. They went through an elaborate and picturesque ritual with great earnestness and reverence and carefully followed the injunctions of the Brahman, a cultured and Western-educated gentleman who presided over the ceremony. It was an attractive scene, and would have been entirely pleasant but for the painful contrast afforded by some eight or ten poor little mites with shaven heads and drab-coloured dresses, almost ragged and quite unadorned. They were infant widows, condemned according to the laws of Hinduism by the premature death of their husbands to whom they had been wedded, but whom they had never known, to lifelong widowhood, and therefore in most cases to lifelong contempt and drudgery. For they were debarred henceforth from fulfilling the supreme function of Hindu womanhood, _i.e._ securing the continuity of family rites from father to son by bearing children in legitimate wedlock, itself terribly circumscribed by the narrow limits within which inter-marriage is permissible even between different septs of the same caste. Happily those I saw were probably still too young to realise the full significance of the unkind fate that already differentiated them so markedly from their more fortunate caste-sisters.  Nor has one to go so very far from the heart of Calcutta to be reminded that the \"premier city\" of modern India derives its name from Kali, the most sinister of Indian goddesses. She was the tutelary deity of Kali-Kata, one of the three villages to which Job Charnock removed the first British settlement in Bengal when he abandoned Hugli in 1690, and her shrine has grown in wealth and fame with the growth of Calcutta. Kali-Kata is to-day only a suburb of the modern city, but in entering it one passes into another world--the world of popular Hinduism. In its narrow streets every shop is stocked with the paraphernalia that Hindus require for their devotions, for everything centres in Kali-Kata round the popular shrine sacred to Kali, the black goddess of destruction, with a protruding blood-red tongue, who wears a necklace of human skulls and a belt of human hands and tongues, and, holding in one of her many hands a severed human head, tramples under foot the dead bodies of her victims. From the _ghats_, or long flights of steps, that descend to the muddy waters of a narrow creek which claims a more or less remote connection with the sacred Ganges, crowds of pious Hindus go through their ablutions in accordance with a long and complicated ritual, whilst high-caste ladies perform them in mid-stream out of covered boats and behind curtains deftly drawn to protect their _purdah_. Past an ancient banyan tree, from whose branches streamers of coloured stuffs depend with other votive offerings from grateful mothers who have not prayed for male offspring in vain, past the minor shrines of many favourite deities, a road lined with closely packed beggars and ascetics, thrusting forth their sores and their shrivelled limbs in the hope of a few coppers, leads up to the place of sacrifice in front of the temple. The pavement is still red with the blood of goats immolated to the Great Goddess, and her devotees who may have just missed the spectacle can at least embrace the posts to which the victims were tied. On an open pillared platform facing the holy of holies some of the high-caste worshippers await in prayer and meditation the moment when its ponderous bronze doors are from time to time thrown open. One old Brahman lady of singularly refined appearance presses her fingers alternately on her right and her left nostril, whilst she expels through the other, keeping her lips all the time tightly closed, the unhallowed air which may have contaminated her lungs on her way to the temple. Another worshipper lies full length with his face pressed to the ground in motionless adoration. Between them flit about laughing, bright-eyed little girls, the \"daughters\" of the temple, still unconscious of the life of temple prostitution to which they have been dedicated from their birth. The court-yard all around is packed with a surging, howling mob of pilgrims, many of them from a great distance, fighting for a vantage point from which they may get a glimpse of the Great Goddess in her inner sanctuary, even if they cannot hope to penetrate into it.  At last, after much clanging of bells and fierce altercations between the Brahman priests and the faithful as to payment of necessary fees, the bronze doors roll back, and in the dim religious twilight one catches a glint of gold and precious stones, the head-dress of Kali, whose terrific image barely emerges from the depth of the inner sanctuary in which it stands, accessible only to its serving Brahmans. They alone, though strangely enough temple Brahmans as a class enjoy little credit with their fellow-castemen, can approach the idol and wash and dress and feed it with offerings. Whilst the doors are open the frenzy and the noise increases, as the mob of worshippers struggle for a front place and bawl out their special supplications at the top of their voices. Then when they are closed again there is a general unravelling of the tangled knots of perspiring humanity, and those who have achieved the supreme purpose of their pilgrimage gradually disperse to make room for another crowd, one stream succeeding another the whole day long on special festivals, but on ordinary days mostly between sunrise and noon. At the back of the shrine, as I came away, some privileged worshippers were waiting to drink a few drops of the foul water which trickles out of a small conduit through the wall from the holy of holies. It is the water in which the feet of the idol--and those of the serving Brahmans--have been washed!  It was in this same temple of Kali that only some fifteen years ago, during the violent agitation provoked by the Partition of Bengal, vast crowds used to assemble and take by the name of the Great Goddess the vow of _Swadeshi_ as the first step to _Swaraj_, and Bengalee youths, maddened by an inflammatory propaganda, learned to graft on to ancient forms of worship the very modern cult of the bomb. To this same temple resorted only the other day Mr. Gandhi's followers to seek the blessing of the Great Goddess for the more harmless forms of protest by which he exhorted the inhabitants of Calcutta to bring home to the Duke of Connaught during his stay in Calcutta their indignant rejection of the boon which he had been sent out by the King-Emperor to confer on the people of India.  Must we then be driven to the conclusion that there is a gulf never to be bridged between India's ancient civilisation and the modern civilisation which we have brought to her out of the West? In that case the great constitutional adventure on which we have just embarked would be, unlike all our other great adventures in India, foredoomed to failure, and those Englishmen would be right who shudder at its rashness and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15592"],["title","Old-Fashioned Fairy Tales (#1)"],["body","head, if not with his hands,\" said Good Luck, \"and I can show you a district where the earth only wants mining to be flooded with wealth. Besides, there are a thousand opportunities that can be turned to account and influence. By wits and work, and with Good Luck to help him, many a poorer man than you has risen to greatness.\"  \"Wits and work!\" cried the indignant godson. \"You speak well--truly! A hillman would have made a better godfather. Give me as much gold as will fill three meal-bins, and you may keep the rest of your help for those who want it.\"  Now at this moment by Good Luck stood Dame Fortune. She likes handsome young men, and there was some little jealousy between her and the godfather so she smiled at the quarrel.  \"You would rather have had me for your gossip?\" said she.  \"If you would give me three wishes, I would,\" replied the farmer boldly, \"and I would trouble you no more.\"  \"Will you make him over to me?\" said Dame Fortune to the godfather.  \"If he wishes it,\" replied Good Luck. \"But if he accepts your gifts he has no further claim on me.\"  \"Nor on me either,\" said the Dame. \"Hark ye, young man, you mortals are apt to make a hobble of your three wishes, and you may end with a sausage at your nose, like your betters.\"  \"I have thought of it too often,\" replied the farmer, \"and I know what I want. For my first wish I desire imperishable beauty.\"  \"It is yours,\" said Dame Fortune, smiling as she looked at him.  \"The face of a prince and the manners of a clown are poor partners,\" said the farmer. \"My second wish is for suitable learning and courtly manners, which cannot be gained at the plough-tail.\"  \"You have them in perfection,\" said the Dame, as the young man thanked her by a graceful bow.  \"Thirdly,\" said he, \"I demand a store of gold that I can never exhaust.\"  \"I will lead you to it,\" said Dame Fortune; and the young man was so eager to follow her that he did not even look back to bid farewell to his godfather.  He was soon at court. He lived in the utmost pomp. He had a suit of armour made for himself out of beaten gold. No metal less precious might come near his person, except for the blade of his sword. This was obliged to be made of steel, for gold is not always strong enough to defend one's life or his honour. But the Princess still loved the Prince of Moonshine.  \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said the King. \"I shall give you to the Prince of Gold.\"  \"I wish I had the good luck to please her,\" muttered the young Prince. But he had not, for all his beauty and his wealth. However, she was to marry him, and that was something.  The preparations for the wedding were magnificent.  \"It is a great expense,\" sighed the King, \"but then I get the Prince of Gold for a son-in-law.\"  The Prince and his bride drove round the city in a triumphal procession. Her hair fell over her like sunshine, but the starlight of her eyes was cold.  In the train rode the Prince of Moonshine, dressed in silver, and with no colour in his face.  As the bridal chariot approached one of the city gates, two black ravens hovered over it, and then flew away, and settled on a tree.  Good Luck was sitting under the tree to see his godson's triumph, and he heard the birds talking above him.  \"Has the Prince of Gold no friend who can tell him that there is a loose stone above the archway that is tottering to fall?\" said they. And Good Luck covered his face with his mantle as the Prince drove through.  Just as they were passing out of the gateway the stone fell on to the Prince's head. He wore a casque of pure gold, but his neck was broken.       \"We can't have all this expense for nothing,\" said the King:     so he married his daughter to the Prince of Moonshine. If one     can't get gold one must be content with silver.   \"Will you come to the funeral?\" asked Dame Fortune of the godfather.  \"Not I,\" replied Good Luck. \"I had no hand in _this_ matter.\"  The rain came down in torrents. The black feathers on the ravens' backs looked as if they had been oiled.  \"Caw! caw!\" said they. \"It was an unlucky end.\"  However, the funeral was a very magnificent one, for there was no stint of gold.     THE HILLMAN AND THE HOUSEWIFE.   It is well known that the Good People cannot abide meanness. They like to be liberally dealt with when they beg or borrow of the human race; and, on the other hand, to those who come to them in need, they are invariably generous.  Now there once lived a certain Housewife who had a sharp eye to her own interests in temporal matters, and gave alms of what she had no use for, for the good of her soul. One day a Hillman knocked at her door.  \"Can you lend us a saucepan, good Mother?\" said he. \"There's a wedding in the hill, and all the pots are in use.\"  \"Is he to have one?\" asked the servant lass who had opened the door.  \"Aye, to be sure,\" answered the Housewife. \"One must be neighbourly.\"  But when the maid was taking a saucepan from the shelf, she pinched her arm, and whispered sharply--\"Not that, you slut! Get the old one out of the cupboard. It leaks, and the Hillmen are so neat, and such nimble workers, that they are sure to mend it before they send it home. So one obliges the Good People, and saves sixpence in tinkering. But you'll never learn to be notable whilst your head is on your shoulders.\"  Thus reproached, the maid fetched the saucepan, which had been laid by till the tinker's next visit, and gave it to the dwarf, who thanked her, and went away.  In due time the saucepan was returned, and, as the Housewife had foreseen, it was neatly mended and ready for use.  At supper-time the maid filled the pan with milk, and set it on the fire for the children's supper. But in a few minutes the milk was so burnt and smoked that no one could touch it, and even the pigs refused the wash into which it was thrown.  \"Ah, good-for-nothing hussy!\" cried the Housewife, as she refilled the pan herself, \"you would ruin the richest with your carelessness. There's a whole quart of good milk wasted at once!\"  \"_And that's twopence_,\" cried a voice which seemed to come from the chimney, in a whining tone, like some nattering, discontented old body going over her grievances.  The Housewife had not left the saucepan for two minutes, when the milk boiled over, and it was all burnt and smoked as before.  \"The pan must be dirty,\" muttered the good woman, in great vexation; \"and there are two full quarts of milk as good as thrown to the dogs.\"  \"_And that's fourpence_,\" added the voice in the chimney.  After a thorough cleaning, the saucepan was once more filled and set on the fire, but with no better success. The milk was hopelessly spoilt, and the housewife shed tears of vexation at the waste, crying, \"Never before did such a thing befall me since I kept house! Three quarts of new milk burnt for one meal!\"  \"_And that's sixpence_,\" cried the voice from the chimney. \"_You didn't save the tinkering after all Mother_!\"  With which the Hillman himself came tumbling down the chimney, and went off laughing through the door.  But thenceforward the saucepan was as good as any other.     THE NECK.  A Legend of a Lake.   On a certain lake there once lived a Neck, or Water Sprite, who desired, above all things, to obtain a human soul. Now when the sun shone this Neck rose up and sat upon the waves and played upon his harp. And he played so sweetly that the winds stayed to listen to him, and the sun lingered in his setting, and the moon rose before her time. And the strain was in praise of immortality.  Furthermore, out of the lake there rose a great rock, whereon dwelt an aged hermit, who by reason of his loneliness was afflicted with a spirit of melancholy; so that when the fit was on him, he was constantly tempted to throw himself into the water, for his life was burdensome to him. But one day, when this gloomy madness had driven him to the edge of the rock to cast himself down, the Neck rose at the same moment, and sitting upon a wave, began to play. And the strain was in praise of immortality. And the melody went straight to the heart of the hermit as a sunbeam goes into a dark cave, and it dispelled his gloom, and he thought all to be as well with him as before it had seemed ill. And he called to the Neck and said, \"What is that which thou dost play, my son?\"  And the Neck answered, \"It is in praise of immortality.\"  Then said the hermit, \"I beg that thou wilt play frequently beneath this rock; for I am an aged and solitary man, and by reason of my loneliness, life becomes a burden to me, and I am tempted to throw it away. But by this gracious strain the evil has been dispelled. Wherefore I beg thee to come often and to play as long as is convenient. And yet I cannot offer thee any reward, for I am poor and without possessions.\"  Then the Neck replied, \"There are treasures below the water as above, and I desire no earthly riches. But if thou canst tell me how I may gain a human soul, I will play on till thou shalt bid me cease.\"  And the hermit said, \"I must consider the matter. But I will return to-morrow at this time and answer thee.\"  Then the next day he returned as he had said, and the Neck was waiting impatiently on the lake, and he cried, \"What news, my father?\"  And the hermit said, \"If that at any time some human being will freely give his life for thee, thou wilt gain a human soul. But thou also must die the selfsame day.\"  \"The short life for the long one!\" cried the Neck; and he played a melody so full of happiness that the blood danced through the hermit's veins as if he were a boy again. But the next day when he came as usual the Neck called to him and said, \"My father, I have been thinking. Thou art aged and feeble, and at the most there are but few days of life remaining to thee. Moreover, by reason of thy loneliness even these are a burden. Surely there is none more fit than thou to be the means of procuring me a human soul. Wherefore I beg of thee, let us die to-day.\"  But the hermit cried out angrily, \"Wretch! Is"]]]
