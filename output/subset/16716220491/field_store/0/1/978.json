The first thing to be undertaken in this weighty work, is a _watchfulness over the failings_ and an _inlargement of the dominion_, of the Senses.  To which end it is requisite, first, That there should be a _scrupulous_ choice, and a _strict examination_, of the reality, constancy, and certainty of the Particulars that we admit: This is the first rise whereon truth is to begin, and here the most severe, and most impartial diligence, must be imployed; the storing up of all, without any regard to evidence or use, will only tend to darkness and confusion. We must not therefore esteem the riches of our Philosophical treasure by the _number_ only, but chiefly by the _weight_; the most _vulgar_ Instances are not to be neglected, but above all, the most _instructive_ are to be entertain’d; the footsteps of Nature are to be trac’d, not only in her _ordinary course_, but when she seems to be put to her shifts, to make many _doublings_ and _turnings_, and to use some kind of art in indeavouring to avoid our discovery.  The next care to be taken, in respect of the Senses, is a supplying of their infirmities with _Instruments_, and, as it were, the adding of _artificial Organs_ to the _natural_; this in one of them has been of late years accomplisht with prodigious benefit to all sorts of useful knowledge, by the invention of Optical Glasses. By the means of _Telescopes_, there is nothing so _far distant_ but may be represented to our view; and by the help of _Microscopes_, there is nothing so _small_, as to escape our inquiry; hence there is a new visible World discovered to the understanding. By this means the Heavens are open’d, and a vast number of new Stars, and new Motions, and new Productions appear in them, to which all the antient Astronomers were utterly Strangers. By this the Earth it self, which lyes so neer us, under our feet, shews quite a new thing to us, and in every _little particle_ of its matter; we now behold almost as great a variety of Creatures, as we were able before to reckon up in the whole _Universe_ it self.  It seems not improbable, but that by these helps the subtilty of the composition of Bodies, the structure of their parts, the various texture of their matter, the instruments and manner of their inward motions, and all the other possible appearances of things, may come to be more fully discovered; all which the antient _Peripateticks_ were content to comprehend in two general and (unless further explain’d) useless words of _Matter_ and _Form_. From whence there may arise many admirable advantages, towards the increase of the _Operative_, and the _Mechanick_ Knowledge, to which this Age seems so much inclined, because we may perhaps be inabled to discern all the secret workings of Nature, almost in the same manner as we do those that are the productions of Art, and are manag’d by Wheels, and Engines, and Springs, that were devised by humane Wit.  In this kind I here present to the World my imperfect Indeavours; which though they shall prove no other way considerable, yet, I hope, they may be in some measure useful to the main Design of a _reformation_ in Philosophy, if it be only by shewing, that there it not so much requir’d towards it, any strength of _Imagination_, or exactness of _Method_, or depth of _Contemplation_ (though the addition of these, where they can be had, must needs produce a much more perfect composure) as a sincere _Hand_, and a _faithful_ Eye, to examine, and to record, the things themselves as they appear.  And I beg my Reader, to let me take the boldness to assure him, that in this present condition of knowledge, a man so qualified, as I have indeavoured to be, only with resolution, and integrity, and plain intentions of imploying his _Senses_ aright, may venture to compare the reality and the usefulness of his services, towards the true Philosophy, with those of other men, that are of much stronger, and more acute _speculations_, that shall not make use of the same method by the Senses.  The truth is, the Science of Nature has been already too long made only a work of the _Brain_ and the _Fancy_: It is now high time that it should return to the plainness and soundness of _Observations_ on _material_ and _obvious_ things. It is said of great Empires, That _the best way to preserve them from decay, is to bring them back to the first Principles, and Arts, on which they did begin_. The same is undoubtedly true in Philosophy, that by wandring far away into _invisible Notions_, has almost quite destroy’d it self, and it can never be recovered, or continued, but by returning into the same _sensible paths_, in which it did at first proceed.  If therefore the Reader expects from me any infallible Deductions, or certainty of _Axioms_, I am to say for my self, that those stronger Works of Wit and Imagination are above my weak Abilities; or if they had not been so, I would not have made use of them in this present Subject before me: Whenever he finds that I have ventur’d at any small Conjectures, at the causes of the things that I have observed, I beseech him to look upon them only as _doubtful Problems_, and _uncertain ghesses_, and not as unquestionable Conclusions, or matters of unconfutable Science; I have produced nothing here, with intent to bind his understanding to an _implicit_ consent; I am so far from that, that I desire him, not absolutely to rely upon these Observations of my eyes, if he finds them contradicted by the future Ocular Experiments of sober and impartial Discoverers.  As for my part, I have obtained my end, if these my small Labours shall be thought fit to take up some place in the large stock of _natural Observations_, which so many hands are busie in providing. If I have contributed the _meanest foundations_ whereon others may raise nobler _Superstructures_, I am abundantly satisfied; and all my ambition is, that I may serve to the great Philosophers of this Age, as the makers and the grinders of my Glasses did to me; that I may prepare and furnish them with some _Materials_, which they may afterwards _order_ and _manage_ with better skill, and to far greater advantage.  The next remedies in this universal cure of the Mind are to be applied to the _Memory_, and they are to consist of such Directions as may inform us, what things are best to be _stor’d up_ for our purpose, and which is the best way of so _disposing_ them, that they may not only be _kept in safety_, but ready and convenient, to be at any time _produc’d_ for use, as occasion shall require. But I will not here prevent my self in what I may say in another Discourse, wherein I shall make an attempt to propose some Considerations of the manner of compiling a Natural and Artificial History, and of so ranging and registring its Particulars into Philosophical Tables, as may make them most useful for the raising of _Axioms_ and _Theories_.  The last indeed is the most _hazardous_ Enterprize, and yet the most _necessary_; and that is, to take such care that the _Judgment_ and the _Reason_ of Man (which is the third Faculty to be repair’d and improv’d) should receive such assistance, as to avoid the dangers to which it is by nature most subject. The Imperfections, which I have already mention’d, to which it is lyable, do either belong to the _extent_, or the _goodness_ of its knowledge; and here the difficulty is the greater, least that which may be thought a _remedy_ for the one should prove _destructive_ to the other, least by seeking to inlarge our Knowledge, we should render it weak and uncertain; and least by being too scrupulous and exact about every Circumstance of it, we should confine and streighten it too much.  In both these the middle wayes are to be taken, nothing is to be_ omitted_, and yet every thing to pass a _mature deliberation_: No _Intelligence_ from Men of all Professions, and quarters of the World, to be _slighted_, and yet all to be so _severely examin’d_, that there remain no room for doubt or instability; much _rigour_ in admitting, much _strictness_ in comparing, and above all, much _slowness_ in debating, and _shyness_ in determining, is to be practised. The _Understanding_ is to _order_ all the inferiour services of the lower Faculties; but yet it is to do this only as a _lawful Master_, and not as a _Tyrant._ It must not _incroach_ upon their Offices, nor take upon it self the employments which belong to either of them. It must _watch_ the irregularities of the Senses, but it must not go before them, or _prevent_ their information. It must _examine_, _range_, and _dispose_ of the bank which is laid up in the Memory: but it must be sure to make _distinction_ between the _sober_ and _well collected heap_, and the _extravagant Ideas_, and _mistaken Images_, which there it may sometimes light upon. So many are the _links_, upon which the true Philosophy depends, of which, if any one be _loose_, or _weak_, the whole _chain_ is in danger of being dissolv’d; it is to _begin_ with the Hands and Eyes, and to _proceed_ on through the Memory, to be _continued_ by the Reason; nor is it to stop there, but to _come about_ to the Hands and Eyes again, and so, by a _continual passage round_ from one Faculty to another, it is to be maintained in life and strength, as much as the body of man is by the _circulation_ of the blood through the several parts of the body, the Arms, the Feet, the Lungs, the Heart, and the Head.  If once this method were followed with diligence and attention, there is nothing that lyes within the power of human Wit (or which is far more effectual) of human Industry, which we might not compass; we might not only hope for Inventions to equalize those of _Copernicus_, _Galileo_, _Gilbert_, _Harvy_, and of others, whose Names are almost lost, that were the Inventors of _Gun-powder_, the _Seamans Compass_, _Printing_, _Etching_, _Graving_, _Microscopes_, &c. but multitudes that may far exceed them:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15491"],["title","Micrographia (#2)"],["body","even those discoveries seem to have been the products of some such method, though but imperfect; What may not be therefore expected from it if thoroughly prosecuted? _Talking_ and _contention of Arguments_ would soon be turn’d into _labours_; all the fine _dreams_ of Opinions, and _universal metaphysical natures_, which the luxury of subtil Brains has devis’d, would quickly vanish, and give place to _solid Histories_, _Experiments_ and _Works._ And as at first, mankind _fell_ by _tasting_ of the forbidden Tree of Knowledge, so we, their Posterity, may be in part _restor’d_ by the same way, not only by _beholding_ and _contemplating_, but by _tasting_ too those fruits of Natural knowledge, that were never yet forbidden.  From hence the World may be assisted with _variety_ of Inventions, _new_ matter for Sciences may be _collected_, the _old improv’d_, and their _rust_ rubb’d away; and as it is by the benefit of Senses that we receive all our Skill in the works of Nature, so they also may be wonderfully benefited by it, and may be guided to an easier and more exact performance of their Offices; ’tis not unlikely, but that we may find out wherein our Senses are deficient, and as easily find wayes of repairing them.  The Indeavours of Skilful men have been most conversant about the assistance of the Eye, and many noble Productions have followed upon it; and from hence we may conclude, that there is a way open’d for advancing the operations, not only of all the other Senses, but even of the Eye it self; that which has been already done ought not to content us, but rather to incourage us to proceed further, and to attempt greater things in the same and different wayes.  ’Tis not unlikely, but that there may be yet invented several other helps for the eye, at much exceeding those already found, as those do the bare eye, such as by which we may perhaps be able to discover _living Creatures_ in the Moon, or other Planets, the _figures_ of the compounding Particles of matter, and the particular _Schematisms_ and _Textures_ of Bodies.  And as _Glasses_ have highly promoted our _seeing_, so ’tis not improbable, but that there may be found many _Mechanical Inventions_ to improve our other Senses, of _hearing_, _smelling_, _tasting_, _touching._ ’Tis not impossible to hear a _whisper_ a _furlongs_ distance, it having been already done; and perhaps the nature of the thing would not make it more impossible, though that furlong should be ten times multiply’d. And though some famous Authors have affirm’d it impossible to hear through the _thinnest plate_ of _Muscovy-glass_; yet I know a way, by which ’tis easie enough to hear one speak through a _wall a yard thick_. It has not been yet thoroughly examin’d, how far _Otocousticons_ may be improv’d, nor what other wayes there may be of _quickning_ our hearing, or _conveying_ sound through _other bodies_ then the _Air_: for that that is not the only _medium_, I can assure the Reader, that I have, by the help of a _distended wire_, propagated the sound to a very considerable distance in an _instant_, or with as seemingly quick a motion as that of light, at least, incomparably swifter then that, which at the same time was propagated through the Air; and this not only in a straight line, or direct, but in one bended in many angles.  Nor are the other three so perfect, but that _diligence_, _attention_, and many _mechanical contrivances_, may also highly improve them. For since the sense of _smelling_ seems to be made by the _swift passage_ of the _Air_ (_impregnated_ with the steams and _effluvia_ of several odorous Bodies) through the grisly _meanders_ of the Nose whose surfaces are _cover’d_ with a very sensible _nerve_, and _moistned_ by a _transudation_ from the _processus mamillares_ of the Brain, and some adjoyning _glandules_, and by the moist _steam_ of the _Lungs_, with a Liquor convenient for the reception of those _effluvia_ and by the adhesion and mixing of those steams with that liquor, and thereby affecting the nerve, or perhaps by insinuating themselves into the juices of the brain, after the same manner, as I have in the following Observations intimated, the parts of Salt to pass through the skins of Effs, and Frogs. Since, I say, smelling seems to be made by some such way, ’tis not improbable, but that some contrivance, for making a great quantity of Air pass quick through the Nose, might as much promote the sense of smelling, as the any wayes hindring that passage does dull and destroy it. Several tryals I have made, both of hindring and promoting this sense, and have succeeded in some according to expectation; and indeed to me it seems capable of being improv’d, for the judging of the constitutions of many Bodies. Perhaps we may thereby also judge (as other Creatures seem to do) what is wholsome, what poyson; and in a word, what are the specifick properties of Bodies.  There may be also some other mechanical wayes found out, of sensibly perceiving the _effluvia_ of Bodies; several Instances of which, were it here proper, I could give of Mineral steams and exhalations; and it seems not impossible, but that by some such wayes improved, may be discovered, what Minerals lye buried under the Earth, without the trouble to dig for them; some things to confirm this Conjecture may be found in _Agricola_, and other Writers of Minerals, speaking of the Vegetables that are apt to thrive, or pine, in those steams.  Whether also those steams, which seem to issue out of the Earth, and mix with the Air (and so to precipitate some _aqueous_ Exhalations, wherewith ’tis impregnated) may not be by some way detected before they produce the effect, seems hard to determine; yet something of this kind I am able to discover, by an Instrument I contriv’d to shew all the minute variations in the pressure of the Air; by which I constantly find, that before, and during the time of rainy weather, the pressure of the Air is less, and in _dry weather_, but especially when an _Eastern Wind_ (which having past over vast tracts of Land is heavy with Earthy Particles) blows, it is much more, though these changes are varied according to very odd Laws.      The Instrument is this. I prepare a pretty capacious Bolt-head AB, with     a small stem about two foot and a half long DC; upon the end of this D     I put on a small bended Glass, or brazen _syphon_ DEF (open at D, E and     F, but to be closed with cement at F and E, as occasion serves) whose     stem F should be about six or eight inches long, but the bore of it not     above half an inch diameter, and very even; these I fix very strongly     together by the help of very hard Cement, and then fit the whole Glass     ABCDEF into a long Board, or Frame, in such manner, that almost half     the head AB may lye buried in a concave Hemisphere cut into the Board     RS; then I place it so on the Board RS, as is exprest in the first     figure of the first Scheme; and fix it very firm and steady in that     posture, so as that the weight of the _Mercury_ that is afterwards to     be put into it, may not in the least shake or stir it; then drawing a     line XY on the Frame RT, so that it may divide the ball into two equal     parts, or that it may pass, as ’twere, through the center of the ball.     I begin from that, and divide all the rest of the Board towards UT into     inches, and the inches between the 25 and the end E (which need not be     above two or three and thirty inches distant from the line XY) I     subdivide into Decimals; then stopping the end F with soft Cement, or     soft Wax, I invert the Frame, placing the head downwards, and the     Orifice E upwards; and by it, with a small Funnel, I fill the whole     Glass with Quicksilver; then by stopping the small Orifice E with my     finger, I oftentimes erect and invert the whole Glass and Frame, and     thereby free the Quicksilver and Glass from all the bubbles or parcels     of lurking Air; then inverting it as before, I fill it top full with     clear and well strain’d Quicksilver, and having made ready a small ball     of pretty hard Cement, by heat made very soft, I press it into the hole     E, and thereby stop it very fast; and to secure this Cement from flying     out afterward, I bind over it a piece of Leather, that is spread over     in the inside with Cement, and wound about it while the Cement is hot:     Having thus fastned it, I gently erect again the Glass after this     manner: I first let the Frame down edge-wayes, till the edge RV touch     the Floor, or ly horizontal; and then in that edging posture raise the     end RS; this I do, that if there chance to be any Air hidden in the     small Pipe E, it may ascend into the Pipe F, and not into the Pipe DC:     Having thus erected it, and hung it by the hole Q, or fixt it     perpendicularly by any other means, I open the end F, and by a small     _Syphon_ I draw out the _Mercury_ so long, till I find the surface of     it AB in the head to touch exactly the line XY; at which time I     immediately take away the _Syphon_, and if by chance it be run somewhat     below the line XY, by pouring in gently a little _Mercury_ at F, I     raise it again to its desired height, by this contrivance I make all     the sensible rising and falling of the _Mercury_ to be visible in the     surface of the _Mercury_ in the Pipe F, and scarce any in the head AB.     But because there really is some small change of the upper surface     also, I find by several Observations how much it rises in the Ball, and     falls in the Pipe F, to make the distance between the two surfaces an     inch greater then it was before; and the measure that it falls in the     Pipe is the length of the inch by which I am to mark the parts of the     Tube F, or the Board on which it lyes, into inches and Decimals: Having     thus justned and divided it, I have a large Wheel MNOP, whose outmost     limb is divided into two hundred equal parts; this by"]]]
