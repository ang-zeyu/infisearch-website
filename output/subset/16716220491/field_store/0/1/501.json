[Illustration: GENERAL MARTIN FIELD. _Eugene Field's Grandfather._]  But before taking up the thread of Roswell Martin Field's strange and unique story, let me give a letter written by his father to his sister, Miss Mary Field, then at the school of Miss Emma Willard in Troy, N.Y., as exhibit number one, that Eugene Field came by his peculiarities, literary and otherwise, by direct lineal descent. Roswell was a phenomenal scholar, as his own eldest son was not. At the age of eleven he was ready for college, and entered Middlebury with his brother Charles, his senior by four years. How they conducted themselves there may be judged from this letter to their sister:    Newfane, March 31st, 1822.    Dear Mary:    I sit down to write you my last letter while you remain at Troy.   Yours by Mr. Read was received, in which I find you allude to the   \"severe and satyrical language\" of mine in a former letter. That   letter was written upon the conduct of my children, which is an   important subject to me. If children are disobedient, a parent has a   right to be severe with them. If I recollect right I expressed to   you that your two oldest brothers' conduct was very reprehensible,   and I there predicted their ruin. But I then little thought that I   should soon witness the sad consequences of their ill-conduct. I   received a letter from President Bates about two weeks since and   another from Charles the same day, that Charles had been turned away   and forever dismissed from the college for his misconduct; Roswell   must suffer a public admonition and perhaps more punishment for his   evil deeds. Charles was turned out of college the 7th of March, and   I wrote on the week after to have him come directly home, but we   have heard nothing from him since. Where he is we can form no   conjecture. But probably he is five hundred miles distant without   money and without friends. I leave you to conjecture the rest.   Roswell is left alone at the age of fifteen to get along, if he is   permitted to stay through college.    These, Mary, are the consequences of dissipation and bad conduct.   And seeing as I do the temper and disposition of my children, that   they \"are inclined to evil and that continually,\" can you wonder   that I write with severity to them? Our hopes are blasted as relates   to Charles and Roswell, and you cannot conceive the trouble which   they have given us. Your mother is almost crazy about them; nor are   we without fears as to you. I say now, as I said in my former   letter, that I wish my children were all at home at work. I am   convinced that an education will only prove injurious to them. If I   had as many sons as had the patriarch Jacob not one should ever   again go nigh a college. It is not a good calculation to educate   children for destruction. The boys' conduct has already brought a   disgrace upon our family which we can never outgrow. They   undoubtedly possess respectable talents and genius, but what are   talents worth when wholly employed in mischief?    I have expended almost two thousand dollars in educating the boys,   and now just at the close they are sent off in disgrace and infamy.   The money is nothing in comparison to the disgrace and ruin that   must succeed. Mary, think of these things often, and especially when   you feel inclined to be gay and airy. Let your brother's fate be a   striking lesson to you. For you may well suppose that you possess   something of the same disposition that he does, but I hope that you   will exercise more prudence than he has. You must now return home   with a fixed resolution to become a steady, sober, and industrious   girl. Give up literary pursuits and quietly and patiently follow   that calling which I am convinced is most proper for my children.    It does appear to me that if children would consider how much   anxiety their parents have for them they would conduct themselves   properly, if it was only to gratify their parents. But it is not so.   Many of them seem determined not only to wound the feelings of the   parents in the most cruel manner but also to ruin themselves.    Remember us respectfully to Dr. and Mrs. Willard, and I am your   affectionate father    MARTIN FIELD.  That Mary did return home to be the mediator between her incensed and stern father and his wayward and mischievous, but not incorrigible sons, is part of the sequel to this letter. What her daughter, Mary Field French, afterwards became to the sons of the younger of the reprehensible pair of youthful collegians will appear later on in this narrative. It is beautifully acknowledged in the dedication of Eugene Field's \"Little Book of Western Verse,\" which I had the honor of publishing for the subscribers in 1889, more than three score years after the date of the foregoing letter. In that dedication, with the characteristic license of a true artist, Field credited the choice of Miss French for the care of his youthful years to his mother:    _A dying mother gave to you     Her child a many years ago;   How in your gracious love he grew,     You know dear, patient heart, you know._         *       *       *       *       *    _To you I dedicate this book,     And, as you read it line by line.   Upon its faults as kindly look     As you have always looked on mine._  In truth, however, it was the living bereaved father who turned in the bewilderment of his grief to the \"dear patient heart\" of his sister, to find a second mother for his two motherless boys. To Martin Field, Mary was a guardian daughter, to Charles K. and Roswell M. 1st, she was a loyal and mediating sister, and to Eugene and Roswell M. 2d, she was a loving aunt, as her daughter Mary was an indulgent mother and unfailing friend. The last name survived \"the love and gratitude\" of Eugene's dedication ten years.  As may have been surmised the parental forebodings of the grieved and satirical General Field were not realized in the eternal perdition of his two sons. Education did not prove their destruction. With more than respectable talents Charles was reinstated at Middlebury, and four months later graduated with high honors, while Roswell took his degree when only fifteen years old, the plague and admiration of his preceptors, and, we may well suppose, the pride and joy of the agonized parents, who welcomed the graduates to Newfane with all the profusion of a prodigal father and the love of a distracted but doting mother. They never had any reason to doubt the nature of sister Mary's reception.  Charles and Roswell studied law with their father in the quaint little office detached from the Field homestead at Newfane. The word edifice might fittingly be applied to this building which, though only one room square and one story high, has a front on the public square, with miniature Greek columns to distinguish it from the ordinary outbuildings that are such characteristic appendages of New England houses. The troubles of General Field with his two sons were not to end when he got them away from the temptations of college life, for they were prone to mischief, \"and that continually,\" even under his severe and watchful eye. This took one particular form which is the talk of Windham County even yet. By reason of their presence in General Field's office they were early apprised of actions at law which he was retained to institute; whereupon they sought out the defendant and offered their services to represent him gratis. Thus the elder counsellor frequently found himself pitted in the justice's courts against his keen-witted and graceless sons, who availed themselves of every obsolete technicality, quirk, and precedent of the law to obstruct justice and worry their dignified parent, whom they addressed as \"our learned but erring brother in the law.\" Not infrequently these youthful practitioners triumphed in these legal tilts, to the mortification of their father, who, in his indignation, could not conceal his admiration for the ingenuity of their misdirected professional zeal.  [Illustration: ESTHER S. FIELD. _Eugene Field's Grandmother._]  Two years after his graduation, and when only seventeen years of age, Eugene Field's father was sufficiently learned in the law to be admitted to the bar of Vermont. They wasted no time in those good old days. Before he was thirty, Roswell M. Field had represented his native town in the General Assembly, had been elected several times State's Attorney, and in every way seemed destined to play a notable part in the affairs of Vermont, if not on a broader field. He was not only a lawyer of full and exact learning, an ingenious pleader, and a powerful advocate, but an exceptionally accomplished scholar. His knowledge of Greek, Latin, French, and German rendered their literature a perennial source upon which to draw for the illumination and embellishment of the pure and virile English of which he was master. It was from him that Eugene inherited his delight in queer and rare objects of vertu and that \"rich, strong, musical and sympathetic voice\" which would have been invaluable on the stage, and of which he made such captivating use among his friends. Would that he had also inherited that \"strong and athletic\" frame which, according to his aged preceptor, enabled Roswell M. Field to graduate at the age of fifteen. It is not, however, for his learning and accomplishments of mind and person that we are interested in Roswell Martin Field, but for the strange incident in his life that uprooted him from the congenial environments of New England and the career opening so temptingly before him, to transplant him to Missouri, there to become"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],["title","Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions — Volume 2 (#1)"],["body"," Lincoln Park.  By arrangement with the business office, Field's salary was paid to Mrs. Field weekly, she having the management of the finances of the family. Field, Ballantyne, and I were the high-priced members of the News staff at that time, but our pay was not princely, and two of us were engaged in a constant conspiracy to jack it up to a level more nearly commensurate, as we \"opined,\" with our respective needs and worth. The third member of the trio, who personally sympathized with our aspirations and acknowledged their justice, occupied an executive position, where he was expected to exercise the most rigorous economy. Moreover, he had a Scotsman's stern and brutal sense of his duty to get the best work for the least expenditure of his employer's money. It was not until Field and I learned that Messrs. Lawson & Stone were more appreciative of the value of our work that our salaries gradually rose above the level where Ballantyne would have condemned them to remain forever in the sacred name of economy.  I have said that Field's weekly salary--\"stipend,\" he called it--was paid regularly to Mrs. Field. I should have said that she received all of it that the ingenious and impecunious Eugene had not managed to forestall. Not a week went by that he did not tax the fertility of his active brain to wheedle Collins Shackelford, the cashier, into breaking into his envelope for five or ten dollars in advance. These appeals came in every form that Field's fecundity could invent. When all other methods failed the presence of \"Pinny\" or \"Melvin\" in the office would afford a messenger and plan of action that was always crowned with success. \"Pinny\" especially seemed to enter into his father's schemes to move Shackelford's sympathy with the greatest success. He was also very effective in moving Mr. Stone to a consideration of Field's requests for higher pay.  In his \"Eugene Field I Knew,\" Francis Wilson has preserved a number of these touching \"notes\" to Shackelford, in prose and verse, but none of them equals in the shrewd, seductive style, of which Field was master, the following, which was composed with becoming hilarity and presented with befitting solemnity:    _A SONNET TO SHEKELSFORD    Sweet Shekelsford, the week is near its end,     And, as my custom is, I come to thee;   There is no other who has pelf to lend,     At least no pelf to lend to hapless me;   Nay, gentle Shekelsford, turn not away--   I must have wealth, for this is Saturday.    Ah, now thou smil'st a soft relenting smile--     Thy previous frown was but a passing joke,   I knew thy heart would melt with pity while     Thou heardst me pleading I was very broke.   Nay, ask me not if I've a note from Stone,     When I approach thee, O thou best of men!   I bring no notes, but, boldly and alone,     I woo sweet hope and strike thee for a ten.    December 3d, 1884._  There is no mistaking the touch of the author of \"Mr. Billings of Louisville\" in these lines, in which humor and flattery robbed the injunction of Mr. Stone against advancing anything on Field's salary of its binding force. Having once learned the key that would unlock the cashier's box, he never let a week go by without turning it to some profitable account. But it is only fair to say that he never abused his influence over Mr. Shackelford to lighten the weekly envelope by more than the \"necessary V\" or the \"sorely needed X.\"  I have dwelt upon these conditions because they explain to some extent our relations, and why, after we had entered upon our study of early English ballads and the chronicles of knights and tourneys, Field always referred to himself as \"the good but impecunious Knight, _sans peur et sans monnaie_,\" while I was \"Sir Slosson,\" \"Nompy,\" or \"Grimesey,\" as the particular roguery he was up to suggested.  It was while I was visiting my family in the province of New Brunswick, in the fall of 1884, that I received the initial evidence of a particular line of attack in which Field delighted to show his friendship and of which he never wearied. It came in shape of an office postal card addressed in extenso, \"For Mr. Alexander Slason Thompson, Fredericton, New Brunswick\"--the employment of the baptismal \"Alexander\" being intended to give zest to the joke with the postal officials in my native town. The communication to which the attention of the curious was invited by its form read:    CHICAGO, October 6th, 1884.    GRIMESEY:    Come at once. We are starving! Come and bring your wallet with you.    EUGENE F----D.   JOHN F. B----E.  Of course the postmaster at Fredericton read the message, and I was soon conscious that a large part of the community was consumed with curiosity as to my relations with my starving correspondents.  But this served merely as a prelude to what was to follow. My visit was cut short by an assignment from the Daily News to visit various towns in Maine to interview the prominent men who had become interested, through James G. Blaine, in the Little Rock securities which played such a part in the presidential campaigns of 1876 and 1884. For ten days I roved all over the state, making my headquarters at the Hotel North, Augusta, where I was bombarded with postal cards from Field. They were all couched in ambiguous terms and were well calculated to impress the inquisitive hotel clerk with the impecuniosity of my friends and with the suspicion that I was in some way responsible for their desperate condition. Autograph hunters have long ago stripped me of most of these letters of discredit, but the following, which has escaped the importunity of collectors of Fieldiana, will indicate their general tenor:    CHICAGO, October 10th, 1884.    If you do not hasten back we shall starve. Harry Powers has come to   our rescue several times, but is beginning to weaken, and the   outlook is very dreary. If you cannot come yourself, please send   certified check.    Yours hungrily,    E.F.   J.F.B.  The same postal importunities awaited me at the Parker House while in Boston, and came near spoiling the negotiations in which I was engaged, for the News, for the, till then, unpublished correspondence between Mr. Blaine and Mr. Fischer, of the Mulligan letters notoriety. My assignment as staff correspondent called for visits to New York, Albany, and Buffalo on my way home, and wherever I stopped I found proofs that Field was possessed of my itinerary and was bound that I should not escape his embarrassing attentions.  There is no need to tell that of all anniversaries of the year Christmas was the one that appealed most strongly to Eugene Field's heart and ever-youthful fancy. It was in his mind peculiarly the children's festival, and his books bear all the testimony that is needed, from the first poem he acknowledged, \"Christmas Treasures,\" to the last word he wrote, that it filled his heart with rejoicings and love and good will. But there is an incident in our friendship which shows how he managed to weave in with the blessed spirit of Christmas the elfish, cheery spirit of his own.  We had spent Christmas Eve, 1884, together, and, as usual, had expended our last dime in providing small tokens of remembrance for everyone within the circle of our immediate friends. I parted from him at the midnight car, which he took for the North Side. Going to the Sherman House, I caught the last elevator for my room on the top floor, and it was not long ere I was oblivious to all sublunary things.  Before it was fairly light the next morning I was disturbed and finally awakened by the sound of voices and subdued tittering in the corridor outside my door. Then there came a knock, and I was told that there was a message for me. Opening the door, my eyes were greeted with a huge home-knit stocking tacked to it with a two-pronged fork and filled with a collection of conventional presents for a boy--a fair idea of which the reader can glean from the following lines in Field's handwriting dangling from the toe:    _I prithee, gentle traveller, pause   And view the work of Santa Claus.   Behold this sock that's brimming o'er   With good things near our Slason's door;   Before he went to bed last night   He paddled out in robe of white,   And hung this sock upon the wall   Prepared for Santa Claus's call.   And said, \"Come, Santa Claus, and bring   Some truck to fill this empty thing.\"   Then back he went and locked the door,   And soon was lost in dream and snore.    The Saint arrived at half-past one--   Behold how well his work is done:   See what a wealth of food and toy   He brought unto the sleeping boy:   An apple, fig, and orange, too,   A jumping-jack of carmine hue,   A book, some candy, and a cat,   Two athletes in a wrestling spat,   A nervous monkey on a stick,   And honey cake that's hard and thick.   Oh, what a wealth of joy is here   To thrill the soul of Slason dear!    Touch not a thing, but leave them all   Within this sock upon the wall;   So when he wakes and comes, he may   Find all these toys and trinkets gay,   And thank old Santa that he came   Up all these stairs with all this game._  If I have succeeded in conveying any true impression of Eugene Field's nature, the reader can imagine the pleasure he derived from this game, in planning it, in providing the old-fashioned sock, toys, and eatables, and in toiling up six flights of stairs after he knew I was asleep, to see that everything was arranged so as to attract the attention of the passing traveller. The success of his game was fully reported to him by his friend, the night clerk--now one of the best known hotel managers in Chicago--and mightily he enjoyed the report that I had been routed out by the early wayfarer before the light of Christmas broke upon the slumbering city.
