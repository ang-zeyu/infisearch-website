Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice to see that Snow-White still lived; and she dressed herself up again in a disguise, but very different from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb, When she reached the dwarf's cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, \"Fine wares to sell!\" but Snow-White said, \"I dare not let anyone in.\" Then the queen begged, \"Only look at my beautiful combs;\" and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless.  \"There you may lie,\" said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs returned very early that evening; and when they saw Snow-White lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when they took it away, she recovered, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone.  [Illustration]  Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and trembled with rage when she received exactly the same answer as before; and she said \"Snow-White shall die, if it costs me my life.\" So she went secretly into a chamber, and prepared a poisoned apple; the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whosoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a peasant's wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs' cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snow-White put her head out of the window, and said, \"I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not to.\" \"Do as you please,\" said the old woman, \"but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will make you a present of it.\" \"No,\" said Snow-White, \"I dare not take it.\" \"You silly girl!\" answered the other, \"what are you afraid of? Do you think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.\" Now the apple was so prepared that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then Snow-White was very much tempted to taste, for the apple looked exceedingly nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could refrain no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground. \"This time nothing will save thee,\" said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it said,        \"Thou, Queen, art the fairest of all the fair.\"  And then her envious heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be.  When evening came, and the dwarfs returned home, they found Snow-White lying on the ground; no breath passed her lips, and they were afraid that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they proposed to bury her; but her cheeks were still rosy, and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, \"We will never bury her in the cold ground.\" And they made a coffin of glass so that they might still look at her, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she was a king's daughter. And the coffin was placed upon the hill, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snow-White. First of all came an owl, and then a raven, but at last came a dove.  And thus Snow-White lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she were asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs' house; and he saw Snow-White, and read what was written in gold letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and earnestly prayed them to let him take her away; but they said, \"We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.\" At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snow-White awoke, and said, \"Where am I?\" And the prince answered, \"Thou art safe with me.\" Then he told her all that had happened, and said, \"I love you better than all the world; come with me to my father's palace, and you shall be my wife.\" And Snow-White consented, and went home with the prince; and everything was prepared with great pomp and splendour for their wedding.  To the feast was invited, among the rest, Snow-White's old enemy, the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine, rich clothes, she looked, in the glass, and the glass answered,        \"Thou, lady, art the loveliest _here_, I ween;       But lovelier far is the new-made queen.\"  When she heard this, she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And when she arrived, and saw that it was none other than Snow-White, who she thought had been dead a long while, she choked with passion, and fell ill and died; but Snow-White and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years.  [Illustration]      [Illustration]  CINDERELLA   The wife of a rich man fell sick: and when she felt that her end drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bedside, and said, \"Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.\" Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her. And the snow spread a beautiful white covering over the grave: but by the time the sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her: they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl. \"What does the good-for-nothing thing want in the parlour?\" said they; \"they who would eat bread should first earn it; away with the kitchen maid!\" Then they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an old frock to put on, and laughed at her and turned her into the kitchen.  Then she was forced to do hard work; to rise early, before daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that, the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways and laughed at her. In the evening, when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made to sleep by the hearth among the ashes; and then, as she was of course always dusty and dirty, they called her Cinderella.  It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his wife's daughters what he should bring them. \"Fine clothes,\" said the first: \"Pearls and diamonds,\" said the second. \"Now, child,\" said he to his own daughter, \"what will you have?\" \"The first sprig, dear father, that rubs against your hat on your way home,\" said she. Then he bought for the two first the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home as he rode through a green copse, a sprig of hazel brushed against him, and almost pushed off his hat; so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it and went to her mother's grave and planted it there, and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three times every day she went to it and wept; and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her and watched over her, and brought her whatever she wished for.  Now it happened that the king of the land held a feast which was to last three days, and out of those who came to it his son was to choose a bride for himself; and Cinderella's two sisters were asked to come. So they called her up and said, \"Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king's feast.\" Then she did as she was told, but when all was done she could not help crying, for she thought to herself, she would have liked to go to the dance too; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go. \"You! Cinderella?\" said she; \"you who have nothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to the ball?\" And when she kept on begging--to get rid of her, she said at last, \"I will throw this basinful of peas into the ash heap, and if you have picked them all out in two hours' time you shall go to the feast too.\" Then she threw the peas into the ashes; but the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out--        \"Hither, hither, through the sky.       Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!       Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,       Hither, hither, haste away!       One and all, come help me quick,       Haste ye, haste ye--pick, pick, pick!\"  [Illustration]  Then first came two white doves flying in at the kitchen window; and next came two turtle-doves; and after them all the little birds under heaven came chirping and fluttering in, and flew down into the ashes; and the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick; and picked out all the good grain and put it in a dish, and left the ashes. At the end of one hour the work was done, and all flew out again at the windows. Then Cinderella brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the feast. But she said, \"No, no! Girl, you have no clothes and cannot dance, you shall not go.\" And when Cinderella begged very hard to go, she said, \"If you can in one hour's time pick two of these dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go too.\" And thus she thought she should at last get rid of her.

A \"straight\" or double thread is used to join various parts of the work, and forms very beautiful patterns. Without the straight thread we should be unable to imitate point lace patterns, or, indeed, to execute any designs but those composed of circles, ovals, &c. To use this straight thread 2 shuttles are required; they should be of different colours. Sometimes one end of thread is left attached to the reel instead of using the second shuttle. In commencing a loop the straight thread is held between the second and third fingers of the left hand, about 2 or 3 inches from the work; the other shuttle is held as usual in the right hand, and the stitches and purls worked with it upon the foundation of the straight thread of the second shuttle.         *       *       *       *       *   TATTING.   1.--_Pine Pattern Collar in Tatting._  [Illustration: I.--Pine Pattern Collar in Tatting.]  Materials: Messrs.
