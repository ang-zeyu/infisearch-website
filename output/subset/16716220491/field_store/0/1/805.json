The first step in this process is to impress on the student's mind that systematic preparation in the history class is as necessary as in Latin, physics, or geometry. Then let the following or similar instructions be given him:--       1. Provide yourself with an envelope of small cards or pieces of         note paper. Label each with the subject of the lesson and the         date of its preparation. These envelopes should be always at         hand during your study and preparation. They should be preserved         and filed from day to day.       2. Read the lesson assigned for the day in the textbook, including         all notes and fine print.       3. Write on a sheet of note paper all the unfamiliar words,         allusions, or expressions. Later, look these up in the         dictionary or other reference.       4. Record the dates which you think worthy to be remembered.       5. Discover and make a note of all the apparent contradictions,         inconsistencies, or inaccuracies in the author's statements.       6. Use the map for all the places mentioned in the lesson. Be able         to locate them when you come to class.       7. In nearly every text there is a list of books for library use,         given at the beginning or end of each chapter. Make yourself         familiar with this bibliography.       8. Read the special questions assigned for the day by the teacher.       9. Go to the library. If the book for which you are in search is         not to be found, try another.      10. Learn to use an index. If the topic for which you are looking         does not appear in the index, try looking for the same thing         under another name; or under some related topic.      11. Having found the material in one book, use more than one if         your time permits. When you feel that you have secured the         material which will make a complete answer to the question,         _write the answer on one of your cards for keeping notes._      12. Remember that the teacher will ask constantly _what_ was done,         _when_ was it done, and, most important of all, _why_ it was         done. Make a list of the questions which you think most likely         to be asked on the lesson and ascertain whether you can answer         them without the use of your notes or text.      13. If possible practice your answers aloud. It will make you the         more ready when called on in class.      14. Keep a list of things which are not clear to you and about         which you wish to ask questions.      15. Before completing your preparation, read over these instructions         and be sure that you have complied with them.   It may be claimed that no high school student can be expected to follow such instructions and that to secure such a daily preparation is impossible; in answer to which it must be admitted that merely a perfunctory talk on methods of preparation will accomplish little. If the instruction just suggested is to bear fruit, the teacher must take pains to see that it is followed. Carefully to prepare his lesson according to a definite plan must become a _habit_ with the student. Facility, accuracy, and thoroughness are impossible otherwise. Haphazard methods are wasteful of time and unproductive of results. The teacher can afford to emphasize method during the first few weeks of the course. The time thus spent in assisting the pupil to develop definite habits of study will pay rich dividends for the remainder of the student's life. Daily inquiry as to the method of study pursued, frequent examination of the student's notes, questions on the important dates selected, the books used for preparation, new words discovered, and so on, will keep the importance of the plan before the class and do much to foster the habit of systematic preparation.   _The question of note-taking_  On the question of notebook work, there will always be a considerable difference of opinion. It is much easier to state what notebook work should not be than to outline precisely how it should be conducted. Certainly it should not be overdone. It should not be an exercise usurping time disproportionate to its value. It should not be required primarily for exhibition purposes, although such notes as are kept should be kept neatly and spelled correctly.  Students should be encouraged to keep their envelope of note paper always at hand during recitation and while reading. The habit of jotting down facts, opinions, statistics, comparisons, and contradictions _while they are being read_ is most desirable and worthy of cultivation. The student should be taught the wisdom of keeping his notes in a neat, legible, and easily available form. Shorthand methods should be discouraged. With a little tactful direction early in the year, the student may be led to form a most useful habit. The greater the proportion of intelligent note-taking that is done without compulsion, the better. No more notes should be _required_ than the teacher can honestly look over, correct, and grade. It is better to require no notes at all than to accept careless, superficial inaccuracies as honest work. One curse of high school history teaching is the tendency of young teachers trained in college history classes to assign more work than the student can honestly do or the teacher properly correct.  As has already been intimated, history notes should not be kept in a book. The required notes should be kept on separate sheets of paper. The topics should be clearly indicated at the top of each sheet. The authorities used in arriving at the answer should always be given, with the volume, chapter, and page. The notes on related topics should be put into an envelope and properly labeled. After the recitation the student can make any necessary corrections in his notes without spoiling their appearance. He will simply substitute a new sheet for the old. If the teacher discovers in his periodic examination of the notes that some of the matter asked for has not been properly covered or that errors have not been corrected, the notes needing revision can be detained for use in a conference with the student, while the others are returned. If at any time after completing his high school work the student desires to use the data contained in his notes or to add to them matter which he may later read, they are in available form. For convenience and neatness, for present use, and future reference this device is far superior to the formal notebook. It has the further advantage of accustoming the student to the method of note-taking which will be required of those who go to college.  It would save much valuable time, at present frequently wasted in writing useless notes, if the teacher constantly squared his notebook requirements with questions such as these:--       1. Is the notebook work as I am conducting it calculated to develop         the habit of critical reading?       2. Does the time spent in writing up notes justify itself by fixing         in the child's mind new and really relevant information not         given in the text?       3. Is it teaching students to combine facts, opinions, and         statistics, to form conclusions really their own?       4. Is the amount of work required reasonable when it is remembered         that the child has three other subjects to prepare, that he is         from thirteen to eighteen years of age, and more or less         unfamiliar with a library?       5. Am I able carefully and punctually to correct all the notes         required?  Whatever the method the teacher thinks best to be used should be explained early in the course and thereafter the student should be held scrupulously responsible for such requirements as are made.   _Instruction in the use of the library and indexes_  Having discussed with the class the questions assigned on the day of enrollment and explained the method of study recommended for their use, it will be well for the teacher to devote some time to instruction in the use of the library. It is possible that the older classes will require very little of this, but there are few classes where an hour, at least, cannot well be spent in a discussion of indexes, titles, and relative value of the works on various subjects. This hour need not be the regular recitation period. A session before or after school could be devoted to the purpose. The teacher's instruction, however, will be greatly assisted if the students are asked to prepare answers before coming to class to such questions as the following:--       1. How much previous work have you done in the library?       2. Of what use do you think the library should be to you in the         course you are just entering?       3. What is a source book? Of what use are source books?       4. What source books on this period of history are in the library?       5. What do you think will be the best references for questions on         the artistic, industrial, political, social, economic, and         military phases of the history you are about to study?       6. What encyclopedias and works of general reference are in your         library?  The preparation of answers to such questions as these will present to the student some of the difficulties inevitable to his future library work and will send him to class prepared to ask intelligent questions. It will enable the teacher accurately to gauge how much his students already know about a library and its uses.  The value and advantage of library work should be carefully explained to the class. It is a great error to allow pupils to think of their library work as drudgery, assigned solely to keep them busy or to make the course difficult. There are too few boys to-day with a genuine love of books, partly no doubt due to the fact that a reference library has become for them, not a rich mine of interesting matter, but a hydra-headed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14577"],["title","The Teaching of History (#2)"],["body","point. A great good has been done the student who has been taught the pleasure of using books. Nor is such a thing impossible. Nothing gives greater satisfaction to the normal high school boy than to find an error in the text, the teacher's statements, or the map. He takes pleasure in confuting the statistics or judgments quoted in class, by others of opposite trend, encountered in his reading. He enjoys asking keen questions. If the student is told that the library work is for the purpose of cultivating his powers of investigation and adding to the matter in the text many interesting details; if the library requirements are reasonable and wisely directed; if he is given an opportunity to _use_ the information he has gathered from his reading, his interest in books will steadily increase.  The teacher should explain the value of remembering accurately the titles and the authors of books used for reference. The silly habit of referring to an authority as \"the book bound in green\" or \"the large book by what's his name\" is easily prevented if taken in time.  The teacher should discover by assignments made in class what degree of proficiency in the use of an index is already possessed by his pupils. There are few classes where the use of an index is thoroughly understood. Time should be taken to demonstrate the quickest possible methods of finding what a book contains. The use of the catalogue and card index should be carefully explained and illustrated.  Attention should be called to the best sources on the various phases of the history to be studied. There ought to be no poor histories in the library, but if there are any to which the students have access, warning should be given against their use.  The value of periodicals and current literature for work in history should be illustrated and the use of _Poole's Index_ and the _Readers Guide_ explained.  The class should be acquainted with the rules of the library and cautioned against the misuse of books. The necessity of leaving reference books where all the class can use them should be made apparent.  Direction in the use of the library, like instruction in the method of study, is a prerequisite to the best results in high school history classes, for no matter how conscientious the teacher, the recitation will be deadly if the student has no working knowledge of the library nor proper method of preparation. A class unable to ask intelligent questions about the work is not ready for the presentation of additional matter by the teacher. It is no difficult matter for a teacher to entertain his class for an hour with interesting incidents of the period in which the lesson occurs. A history teacher who cannot talk interestingly for an hour on any of the great periods of history has surely missed his calling. But to keep a class quiet, to retain their attention, to amuse and entertain, is far from making history vital. If the recitation is to be really vital, the students must do most of the talking, the criticizing, and the questioning. There can be none of these worth while without proper preparation.     III  THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE LESSON   _Careful assignment will reveal to the student the relation of geography and history_  The recitation can never hope to achieve its maximum helpfulness unless the lesson be intelligently assigned. The work required must be reasonable in amount, and not so exacting as to discourage interest. Daily direction to look up unfamiliar words, expressions, and allusions must be given until the habit becomes fixed. Warning against possible geographical misconceptions should be given when necessary, together with directions to use the map for places, routes, and boundaries. A few questions asked in advance, with the purpose of bringing out the relation of the geography to the history in the lesson, will be of great assistance. For example, if the class are to study the Louisiana Purchase, the full significance of that revolutionary event will be made much clearer if the student is asked to prepare answers before coming to class to such questions as the following:--       1. What States are included in the purchase?       2. What is its area? How does it compare with the area of the         original thirteen States?       3. What geographical reasons caused Napoleon to sell it?       4. What influence did the purchase have on our retention of the         territory east of the Mississippi? Why?       5. How many people live to-day in the territory included in the         purchase?   _His power of analysis and criticism will be stimulated_  A lesson should be so assigned that the student will read the text with his eye critically open to inconsistencies, contradictions, and inaccuracies. With a text of six hundred pages, and with a hundred and eighty recitations in which to cover them, it is not too much to expect that the average of three or four pages daily shall be studied so thoroughly that the student can analyze and summarize each day's lesson. The teacher should not make such analysis in advance of the recitation, but he should so assign the lesson that the student will be prepared to give one when he comes to class. A word in advance by the teacher will prompt the student who is studying the American Revolution, to classify its causes as direct and indirect, economic and political, social and religious. There is no difficulty in finding good authorities who disagree as to the effect on America of the English trade restrictions. Callendar's _Economic History of the United States_ quotes five of the best authorities on this point, and covers the case in a few pages. A reference by the teacher to this or some other authority will bring out a lively discussion on the justice of the American resistance. Let the class be asked to account for the colonial opposition to the Townshend Acts, when the Stamp Act Congress had declared that the regulation of the Colonies' external trade was properly within the powers of Parliament. Let the class be asked to explain a statement that the Declaration of Independence does not mention the real underlying causes of the Revolution. A few suggestions and advanced questions of this sort will stimulate a critical analysis of the statements in the text, and send the student to class keen for an intelligent discussion.  Ordinarily, when a class is averaging three or four pages of the text daily, it is an error for the teacher to point out in advance certain dates and statistics that need not be memorized. Such selection should be left to the student. During the recitation the teacher will discover what dates, statistics, and other matter the student has selected as worthy to be memorized, and if correction is necessary it may then be made. It dulls the edge of the pupil's enthusiasm to be told in advance that some of the text is not worthy to be remembered. Furthermore such instruction does nothing to develop the student's sense of historical proportion, for it substitutes the judgment of the teacher for that of the pupil.  Advance questions asking explanation of statements made in the text, or by other authors dealing with the same period, insure that the lesson will be read understandingly and that the author's statements will be carefully analyzed. Such declarations as the following are illustrations of statements whose explanation might profitably be required in advance:--       1. \"The Constitution was extracted by necessity from a reluctant         people.\"       2. \"Oregon was a make-weight for Texas.\"       3. \"The greatest evil of slavery was that it prevented the South         from accumulating capital.\"       4. \"The day that France possesses New Orleans we must marry         ourselves to the British fleet.\"       5. \"The cause of free labor won a substantial triumph in the         Missouri Compromise.\"       6. \"The second war with England was not one of necessity, policy,         or interest on the part of the Americans; it was rather one of         party prejudice and passion.\"   _The conditions in other countries will add to his comprehension of the facts in the lesson_  In so far as the next lesson requires an understanding of the history or conditions of another country, the attention of the class should be directed in advance to such necessity. Special references or brief reports may be advisable. A few well-selected advance questions will send the class to recitation prepared to discuss what otherwise the teacher must explain. A few questions on the character of James II, his ideals of government, the chief causes of the revolution of 1688, and its most important results will do much to explain the colonial resistance to Andros. A few questions designed to bring out the imperative necessity of English resistance to Napoleon will make clear the hostile commercial decrees, impressment, and interference with the rights of neutral ships. Such questions reduce the necessity of explanation by the teacher to a minimum.   _His disposition to study intensively will be encouraged_  If the teacher expects the class to deal more intensively than the text with the matters discussed in the lesson, a few advance questions will be of great assistance. Suppose, for example, that the text contents itself with saying that for political reasons the first United States Bank was not rechartered, and shortly after informs the reader that the second United States Bank was rechartered because the State banks had suspended specie payments. The student may or may not be curious about the failure of the first bank to receive a new charter, the operation of State banks, or why they suspended payment in 1814. If he has been properly taught, he probably will be, but if the teacher wishes to discuss these considerations in detail at the next recitation it will be infinitely better to have the facts contributed by the class than for the teacher to do the reciting. It is quite possible that the individual answers"]]]
