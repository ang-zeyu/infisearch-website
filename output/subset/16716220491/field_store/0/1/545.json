Now, Jacob knew the ways of stock--that's most uncommon clear--   For when he got to Laban's Run, they made him overseer;   He didn't ask a pound a week, but bargained for his pay   To take the roan and strawberry calves--the same we'd take to-day.    The duns and blacks and “Goulburn roans” (that's brindles), coarse and hard,   He branded them with Laban's brand, in Old Man Laban's yard;   So, when he'd done the station work for close on seven year,   Why, all the choicest stock belonged to Laban's overseer.    It's often so with overseers--I've seen the same thing done   By many a Queensland overseer on many a Queensland run.   But when the mustering time came on old Laban acted straight,   And gave him country of his own outside the boundary gate.    He gave him stock, and offered him his daughter's hand in troth;   And Jacob first he married one, and then he married both;   You see, they weren't particular about a wife or so--   No more were we up Queensland way a score of years ago.    But when the stock were strong and fat with grass and lots of rain,   Then Jacob felt the call to take the homeward road again.   It's strange in every creed and clime, no matter where you roam,   There comes a day when every man would like to make for home.    So off he set with sheep and goats, a mighty moving band,   To battle down the homeward track along the Overland--   It's droving mixed-up mobs like that that makes men cut their throats.   I've travelled rams, which Lord forget, but never travelled goats.    But Jacob knew the ways of stock, for (so the story goes)   When battling through the Philistines--selectors, I suppose--   He thought he'd have to fight his way, an awkward sort of job;   So what did Old Man Jacob do? of course, he split the mob.    He sent the strong stock on ahead to battle out the way;   He couldn't hurry lambing ewes--no more you could to-day--   And down the road, from run to run, his hand 'gainst every hand,   He moved that mighty mob of stock across the Overland.    The thing is made so clear and plain, so solid in and out,   There isn't any room at all for any kind of doubt.   It's just a plain straightforward tale--a tale that lets you know   The way they lived in Palestine three thousand years ago.    It's strange to read it all to-day, the shifting of the stock;   You'd think you see the caravans that loaf behind the flock,   The little donkeys and the mules, the sheep that slowly spread,   And maybe Dan or Naphthali a-ridin' on ahead.    The long, dry, dusty summer days, the smouldering fires at night;   The stir and bustle of the camp at break of morning light;   The little kids that skipped about, the camels' dead-slow tramp--   I wish I'd done a week or two in Old Man Jacob's camp!    _But if I keep the narrer path, some day, perhaps, I'll know   How Jacob bred them strawberry calves three thousand years ago._     The Reverend Mullineux      I'd reckon his weight at eight-stun-eight,    And his height at five-foot-two,   With a face as plain as an eight-day clock   And a walk as brisk as a bantam-cock--    Game as a bantam, too,   Hard and wiry and full of steam,   That's the boss of the English Team,    Reverend Mullineux.    Makes no row when the game gets rough--    None of your “Strike me blue!”    “You's wants smacking across the snout!”    Plays like a gentleman out-and-out--    Same as he ought to do.   “Kindly remove from off my face!”    That's the way that he states his case--    Reverend Mullineux.    Kick!  He can kick like an army mule--    Run like a kangaroo!   Hard to get by as a lawyer-plant,   Tackles his man like a bull-dog ant--    Fetches him over too!   _Didn't_ the public cheer and shout   Watchin' him chuckin' big blokes about--    Reverend Mullineux.    Scrimmage was packed on his prostrate form,    Somehow the ball got through--   Who was it tackled our big half-back,   Flinging him down like an empty sack,    Right on our goal-line too?   Who but the man that we thought was dead,   Down with a score of 'em on his head,    Reverend Mullineux.     The Wisdom of Hafiz      My son, if you go to the races to battle with Ikey and Mo,   Remember, it's seldom the pigeon can pick out the eye of the crow;   Remember, they live by the business; remember, my son, and go slow.    If ever an owner should tell you, “Back mine”--don't you be such a flat.   He knows his own cunning, no doubt--does he know what the others are at?   Find out what he's frightened of most, and invest a few dollars on that.    Walk not in the track of the trainer, nor hang round the rails at his stall.   His wisdom belongs to his patron--shall he give it to one and to all?   When the stable is served he may tell you--and his words     are like jewels let fall.    Run wide of the tipster who whispers that Borak is sure to be first,   He tells the next mug that he corners a tale with the placings reversed;   And, remember, of judges of racing, the jockey's the absolute worst.    When they lay three to one on the field, and the runners are twenty-and-two,   Take a pull on yourself; take a pull--it's a mighty big field     to get through.   Is the club handicapper a fool?  If a fool is about, p'raps it's you!    Beware of the critic who tells you the handicap's absolute rot,   For this is chucked in, and that's hopeless, and somebody ought to be shot.   How is it he can't make a fortune himself when he knows such a lot?    From tipsters, and jockeys, and trials, and gallops, the glory has gone,   For this is the wisdom of Hafiz that sages have pondered upon,   “The very best tip in the world is to see the commission go on!”     Saltbush Bill, J.P.      Beyond the land where Leichhardt went,    Beyond Sturt's Western track,   The rolling tide of change has sent    Some strange J.P.s out back.    And Saltbush Bill, grown old and grey,    And worn with want of sleep,   Received the news in camp one day    Behind the travelling sheep    That Edward Rex, confiding in    His known integrity,   By hand and seal on parchment skin    Had made him a J.P.    He read the news with eager face    But found no word of pay.   “I'd like to see my sister's place    And kids on Christmas day.    “I'd like to see green grass again,    And watch clear water run,   Away from this unholy plain,    And flies, and dust, and sun.”    At last one little clause he found    That might some hope inspire,   “A magistrate may charge a pound    For inquest on a fire.”    A big blacks' camp was built close by,    And Saltbush Bill, says he,   “I think that camp might well supply    A job for a J.P.”    That night, by strange coincidence,    A most disastrous fire   Destroyed the country residence    Of Jacky Jack, Esquire.    'Twas mostly leaves, and bark, and dirt;    The party most concerned   Appeared to think it wouldn't hurt    If forty such were burned.    Quite otherwise thought Saltbush Bill,    Who watched the leaping flame.   “The home is small,” said he, “but still    The principle's the same.    “Midst palaces though you should roam,    Or follow pleasure's tracks,   You'll find,” he said, “no place like home,    At least like Jacky Jack's.    “Tell every man in camp 'Come quick,'    Tell every black Maria   I give tobacco half a stick--    Hold inquest long-a fire.”    Each juryman received a name    Well suited to a Court.   “Long Jack” and “Stumpy Bill” became    “John Long” and “William Short”.    While such as “Tarpot”, “Bullock Dray”,    And “Tommy Wait-a-While”,   Became, for ever and a day,    “Scott”, “Dickens”, and “Carlyle”.    And twelve good sable men and true    Were soon engaged upon   The conflagration that o'erthrew    The home of John A. John.    Their verdict, “Burnt by act of Fate”,    They scarcely had returned   When, just behind the magistrate,    Another humpy burned!    The jury sat again and drew    Another stick of plug.   Said Saltbush Bill, “It's up to you    Put some one long-a Jug.”    “I'll camp the sheep,” he said, “and sift    The evidence about.”    For quite a week he couldn't shift,    The way the fires broke out.    The jury thought the whole concern    As good as any play.   They used to “take him oath” and earn    Three sticks of plug a day.    At last the tribe lay down to sleep    Homeless, beneath a tree;   And onward with his travelling sheep    Went Saltbush Bill, J.P.    The sheep delivered, safe and sound,    His horse to town he turned,   And drew some five-and-twenty pound    For fees that he had earned.    And where Monaro's ranges hide    Their little farms away--   His sister's children by his side--    He spent his Christmas Day.    The next J.P. that went out back    Was shocked, or pained, or both,   At hearing every pagan black    Repeat the juror's oath.    No matter though he turned and fled    They followed faster still;   “You make it inkwich, boss,” they said,    “All same like Saltbush Bill.”    They even said they'd let him see    The fires originate.   When he refused they said that he    Was “No good magistrate.”    And out beyond Sturt's Western track,    And Leichhardt's farthest tree,   They wait till fate shall send them back    Their Saltbush Bill, J.P.     The Riders in the Stand      There's some that ride the Robbo style, and bump at every stride;   While others sit a long way back, to get a longer ride.   There's some that ride like sailors do, with legs and arms, and teeth;   And some ride on the horse's neck, and some ride underneath.    But all the finest horsemen out--the men to Beat the Band--   You'll find amongst the crowd that ride their races in the Stand.   They'll say “He had the race in hand, and lost it in the straight.”    They'll show how Godby came too soon, and Barden came too late.    They'll say Chevalley lost his nerve, and Regan lost his head;   They'll tell how one was “livened up” and something else was “dead”--   In fact, the race was never run on sea,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1317"],["title","Saltbush Bill, J. P. (#2)"],["body"," sky, or land,   But what you'd get it better done by riders in the Stand.    The rule holds good in everything in life's uncertain fight;   You'll find the winner can't go wrong, the loser can't go right.   You ride a slashing race, and lose--by one and all you're banned!   Ride like a bag of flour, and win--they'll cheer you in the Stand.     Waltzing Matilda        (Carrying a Swag.)      Oh! there once was a swagman camped in the Billabong,    Under the shade of a Coolabah tree;   And he sang as he looked at his old billy boiling,    “Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me.”        Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda, my darling,        Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?       Waltzing Matilda and leading a water-bag--        Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?    Down came a jumbuck to drink at the water-hole,    Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him in glee;   And he sang as he put him away in his tucker-bag,    “You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me!”    Down came the Squatter a-riding his thorough-bred;    Down came Policemen--one, two, and three.   “Whose is the jumbuck you've got in the tucker-bag?    You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me.”    But the swagman, he up and he jumped in the water-hole,    Drowning himself by the Coolabah tree;   And his ghost may be heard as it sings in the Billabong,    “Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?”     An Answer to Various Bards      Well, I've waited mighty patient while they all came rolling in,   Mister Lawson, Mister Dyson, and the others of their kin,   With their dreadful, dismal stories of the Overlander's camp,   How his fire is always smoky, and his boots are always damp;   And they paint it so terrific it would fill one's soul with gloom,   But you know they're fond of writing about “corpses” and “the tomb”.   So, before they curse the bushland they should let their fancy range,   And take something for their livers, and be cheerful for a change.    Now, for instance, Mr. Lawson--well, of course, we almost cried   At the sorrowful description how his “little 'Arvie” died,   And we lachrymosed in silence when “His Father's Mate” was slain;   Then he went and killed the father, and we had to weep again.   Ben Duggan and Jack Denver, too, he caused them to expire,   And he went and cooked the gander of Jack Dunn, of Nevertire;   So, no doubt, the bush is wretched if you judge it by the groan   Of the sad and soulful poet with a graveyard of his own.    And he spoke in terms prophetic of a revolution's heat,   When the world should hear the clamour of those people in the street;   But the shearer chaps who start it--why, he rounds on them in blame,   And he calls 'em “agitators” who are living on the game.   But I “over-write” the bushmen!  Well, I own without a doubt   That I always see a hero in the “man from furthest out”.   I could never contemplate him through an atmosphere of gloom,   And a bushman never struck me as a subject for “the tomb”.    If it ain't all “golden sunshine” where the “wattle branches wave”,   Well, it ain't all damp and dismal, and it ain't all “lonely grave”.   And, of course, there's no denying that the bushman's life is rough,   But a man can easy stand it if he's built of sterling stuff;   Tho' it's seldom that the drover gets a bed of eider-down,   Yet the man who's born a bushman, he gets mighty sick of town,   For he's jotting down the figures, and he's adding up the bills   While his heart is simply aching for a sight of Southern hills.    Then he hears a wool-team passing with a rumble and a lurch,   And, although the work is pressing, yet it brings him off his perch.   For it stirs him like a message from his station friends afar   And he seems to sniff the ranges in the scent of wool and tar;   And it takes him back in fancy, half in laughter, half in tears,   To a sound of other voices and a thought of other years,   When the woolshed rang with bustle from the dawning of the day,   And the shear-blades were a-clicking to the cry of “Wool away!”    Then his face was somewhat browner and his frame was firmer set--   And he feels his flabby muscles with a feeling of regret.   But the wool-team slowly passes, and his eyes go sadly back   To the dusty little table and the papers in the rack,   And his thoughts go to the terrace where his sickly children squall,   And he thinks there's something healthy in the bush-life after all.   But we'll go no more a-droving in the wind or in the sun,   For our fathers' hearts have failed us and the droving days are done.    There's a nasty dash of danger where the long-horned bullock wheels,   And we like to live in comfort and to get our reg'lar meals.   For to hang around the townships suits us better, you'll agree,   And a job at washing bottles is the job for such as we.   Let us herd into the cities, let us crush and crowd and push   Till we lose the love of roving and we learn to hate the bush;   And we'll turn our aspirations to a city life and beer,   And we'll slip across to England--it's a nicer place than here;    For there's not much risk of hardship where all comforts are in store,   And the theatres are plenty and the pubs are more and more.   But that ends it, Mr. Lawson, and it's time to say good-bye,   We must agree to differ in all friendship, you and I;   So we'll work our own salvation with the stoutest hearts we may,   And if fortune only favours we will take the road some day,   And go droving down the river 'neath the sunshine and the stars,   And then return to Sydney and vermilionize the bars.     T.Y.S.O.N.      Across the Queensland border line    The mobs of cattle go;   They travel down in sun and shine    On dusty stage, and slow.   The drovers, riding slowly on    To let the cattle spread,   Will say:  “Here's one old landmark gone,    For old man Tyson's dead.”    What tales there'll be in every camp    By men that Tyson knew;   The swagmen, meeting on the tramp,    Will yarn the long day through,   And tell of how he passed as “Brown”,    And fooled the local men:   “But not for me--I struck the town,   And passed the message further down;    That's T.Y.S.O.N.!”    There stands a little country town    Beyond the border line,   Where dusty roads go up and down,    And banks with pubs combine.   A stranger came to cash a cheque--    Few were the words he said--   A handkerchief about his neck,    An old hat on his head.    A long grey stranger, eagle-eyed--    “Know me?  Of course you do?”    “It's not my work,” the boss replied,    “To know such tramps as you.”    “Well, look here, Mister, don't be flash,”     Replied the stranger then,   “I never care to make a splash,   I'm simple--but I've got the cash,    I'm T.Y.S.O.N.”    But in that last great drafting-yard,    Where Peter keeps the gate,   And souls of sinners find it barred,    And go to meet their fate,   There's one who ought to enter in,    For good deeds done on earth;   Such deeds as merit ought to win,    Kind deeds of sterling worth.    Not by the strait and narrow gate,    Reserved for wealthy men,   But through the big gate, opened wide,   The grizzled figure, eagle-eyed,    Will travel through--and then   Old Peter'll say:  “We pass him through;   There's many a thing he used to do,   Good-hearted things that no one knew;    That's T.Y.S.O.N.”     As Long as your Eyes are Blue      Wilt thou love me, sweet, when my hair is grey    And my cheeks shall have lost their hue?   When the charms of youth shall have passed away,    Will your love as of old prove true?    For the looks may change, and the heart may range,    And the love be no longer fond;   Wilt thou love with truth in the years of youth    And away to the years beyond?    Oh, I love you, sweet, for your locks of brown    And the blush on your cheek that lies--   But I love you most for the kindly heart    That I see in your sweet blue eyes.    For the eyes are signs of the soul within,    Of the heart that is leal and true,   And mine own sweetheart, I shall love you still,    Just as long as your eyes are blue.    For the locks may bleach, and the cheeks of peach    May be reft of their golden hue;   But mine own sweetheart, I shall love you still,    Just as long as your eyes are blue.     Bottle-O!      I ain't the kind of bloke as takes to any steady job;    I drives me bottle cart around the town;   A bloke what keeps 'is eyes about can always make a bob--    I couldn't bear to graft for every brown.   There's lots of handy things about in everybody's yard,    There's cocks and hens a-runnin' to an' fro,   And little dogs what comes and barks--we take 'em off their guard    And we puts 'em with the Empty Bottle-O!                Chorus--        So it's any “Empty bottles!  Any empty bottle-O!”        You can hear us round for a half a mile or so.        And you'll see the women rushing        To take in the Monday's washing       When they 'ear us crying, “Empty Bottle-O!”    I'm drivin' down by Wexford-street and up a winder goes,    A girl sticks out 'er 'ead and looks at me,   An all-right tart with ginger 'air, and freckles on 'er nose;    I stops the cart and walks across to see.   “There ain't no bottles 'ere,” says she, “since father took the pledge;”     “No bottles 'ere,” says I, “I'd like to know   What right you 'ave to stick your 'ead outside the winder ledge,    If you 'aven't got no Empty Bottle-O!”    I sometimes gives the 'orse a spell, and then the push and me    We takes a little trip to Chowder Bay.   Oh! ain't it nice the 'ole day long a-gazin' at the sea    And a-hidin' of the tanglefoot away.   But when the booze gits 'old of us, and fellows starts to “scrap”,    There's some what likes blue-metal for to throw:   But as for me, I always says for layin' out a “trap”     There's nothin' like an Empty Bottle-O!     The Story of Mongrel Grey      This is the story the stockman told,    On the cattle camp, when the stars were bright;   The moon rose up like a globe of gold    And flooded"]]]
