Their eyes were full; their hair, of raven blackness, grew thick and close and curly.  Their figures were massive and typical of strength.  \"The thick black hair, growing low down on the neck, told of vast physical strength and endurance.  But the most remarkable characteristic is the eyes.  Black, piercing, almost unendurable, they seem to contain in themselves a remarkable will power which there is no gainsaying.  It is a power that is partly racial and partly individual: a power impregnated with some mysterious quality, partly hypnotic, partly mesmeric, which seems to take away from eyes that meet them all power of resistance--nay, all power of wishing to resist.  With eyes like those, set in that all-commanding face, one would need to be strong indeed to think of resisting the inflexible will that lay behind.  \"You may think, Adam, that all this is imagination on my part, especially as I have never seen any of them.  So it is, but imagination based on deep study.  I have made use of all I know or can surmise logically regarding this strange race.  With such strange compelling qualities, is it any wonder that there is abroad an idea that in the race there is some demoniac possession, which tends to a more definite belief that certain individuals have in the past sold themselves to the Devil?  \"But I think we had better go to bed now.  We have a lot to get through to-morrow, and I want you to have your brain clear, and all your susceptibilities fresh.  Moreover, I want you to come with me for an early walk, during which we may notice, whilst the matter is fresh in our minds, the peculiar disposition of this place--not merely your grand-uncle's estate, but the lie of the country around it.  There are many things on which we may seek--and perhaps find--enlightenment.  The more we know at the start, the more things which may come into our view will develop themselves.\"     CHAPTER III--DIANA'S GROVE   Curiosity took Adam Salton out of bed in the early morning, but when he had dressed and gone downstairs; he found that, early as he was, Sir Nathaniel was ahead of him.  The old gentleman was quite prepared for a long walk, and they started at once.  Sir Nathaniel, without speaking, led the way to the east, down the hill. When they had descended and risen again, they found themselves on the eastern brink of a steep hill.  It was of lesser height than that on which the Castle was situated; but it was so placed that it commanded the various hills that crowned the ridge.  All along the ridge the rock cropped out, bare and bleak, but broken in rough natural castellation. The form of the ridge was a segment of a circle, with the higher points inland to the west.  In the centre rose the Castle, on the highest point of all.  Between the various rocky excrescences were groups of trees of various sizes and heights, amongst some of which were what, in the early morning light, looked like ruins.  These--whatever they were--were of massive grey stone, probably limestone rudely cut--if indeed they were not shaped naturally.  The fall of the ground was steep all along the ridge, so steep that here and there both trees and rocks and buildings seemed to overhang the plain far below, through which ran many streams.  Sir Nathaniel stopped and looked around, as though to lose nothing of the effect.  The sun had climbed the eastern sky and was making all details clear.  He pointed with a sweeping gesture, as though calling Adam's attention to the extent of the view.  Having done so, he covered the ground more slowly, as though inviting attention to detail.  Adam was a willing and attentive pupil, and followed his motions exactly, missing--or trying to miss--nothing.  \"I have brought you here, Adam, because it seems to me that this is the spot on which to begin our investigations.  You have now in front of you almost the whole of the ancient kingdom of Mercia.  In fact, we see the whole of it except that furthest part, which is covered by the Welsh Marches and those parts which are hidden from where we stand by the high ground of the immediate west.  We can see--theoretically--the whole of the eastern bound of the kingdom, which ran south from the Humber to the Wash.  I want you to bear in mind the trend of the ground, for some time, sooner or later, we shall do well to have it in our mind's eye when we are considering the ancient traditions and superstitions, and are trying to find the _rationale_ of them.  Each legend, each superstition which we receive, will help in the understanding and possible elucidation of the others.  And as all such have a local basis, we can come closer to the truth--or the probability--by knowing the local conditions as we go along.  It will help us to bring to our aid such geological truth as we may have between us.  For instance, the building materials used in various ages can afford their own lessons to understanding eyes.  The very heights and shapes and materials of these hills--nay, even of the wide plain that lies between us and the sea--have in themselves the materials of enlightening books.\"  \"For instance, sir?\" said Adam, venturing a question.  \"Well, look at those hills which surround the main one where the site for the Castle was wisely chosen--on the highest ground.  Take the others. There is something ostensible in each of them, and in all probability something unseen and unproved, but to be imagined, also.\"  \"For instance?\" continued Adam.  \"Let us take them _seriatim_.  That to the east, where the trees are, lower down--that was once the location of a Roman temple, possibly founded on a pre-existing Druidical one.  Its name implies the former, and the grove of ancient oaks suggests the latter.\"  \"Please explain.\"  \"The old name translated means 'Diana's Grove.'  Then the next one higher than it, but just beyond it, is called '_Mercy_'--in all probability a corruption or familiarisation of the word _Mercia_, with a Roman pun included.  We learn from early manuscripts that the place was called _Vilula Misericordiae_.  It was originally a nunnery, founded by Queen Bertha, but done away with by King Penda, the reactionary to Paganism after St. Augustine.  Then comes your uncle's place--Lesser Hill.  Though it is so close to the Castle, it is not connected with it.  It is a freehold, and, so far as we know, of equal age.  It has always belonged to your family.\"  \"Then there only remains the Castle!\"  \"That is all; but its history contains the histories of all the others--in fact, the whole history of early England.\"  Sir Nathaniel, seeing the expectant look on Adam's face, went on:  \"The history of the Castle has no beginning so far as we know.  The furthest records or surmises or inferences simply accept it as existing. Some of these--guesses, let us call them--seem to show that there was some sort of structure there when the Romans came, therefore it must have been a place of importance in Druid times--if indeed that was the beginning.  Naturally the Romans accepted it, as they did everything of the kind that was, or might be, useful.  The change is shown or inferred in the name Castra.  It was the highest protected ground, and so naturally became the most important of their camps.  A study of the map will show you that it must have been a most important centre.  It both protected the advances already made to the north, and helped to dominate the sea coast.  It sheltered the western marches, beyond which lay savage Wales--and danger.  It provided a means of getting to the Severn, round which lay the great Roman roads then coming into existence, and made possible the great waterway to the heart of England--through the Severn and its tributaries.  It brought the east and the west together by the swiftest and easiest ways known to those times.  And, finally, it provided means of descent on London and all the expanse of country watered by the Thames.  \"With such a centre, already known and organised, we can easily see that each fresh wave of invasion--the Angles, the Saxons, the Danes, and the Normans--found it a desirable possession and so ensured its upholding.  In the earlier centuries it was merely a vantage ground.  But when the victorious Romans brought with them the heavy solid fortifications impregnable to the weapons of the time, its commanding position alone ensured its adequate building and equipment.  Then it was that the fortified camp of the Caesars developed into the castle of the king.  As we are as yet ignorant of the names of the first kings of Mercia, no historian has been able to guess which of them made it his ultimate defence; and I suppose we shall never know now.  In process of time, as the arts of war developed, it increased in size and strength, and although recorded details are lacking, the history is written not merely in the stone of its building, but is inferred in the changes of structure.  Then the sweeping changes which followed the Norman Conquest wiped out all lesser records than its own.  To-day we must accept it as one of the earliest castles of the Conquest, probably not later than the time of Henry I.  Roman and Norman were both wise in their retention of places of approved strength or utility.  So it was that these surrounding heights, already established and to a certain extent proved, were retained.  Indeed, such characteristics as already pertained to them were preserved, and to-day afford to us lessons regarding things which have themselves long since passed away.  \"So much for the fortified heights; but the hollows too have their own story.  But how the time passes!  We must hurry home, or your uncle will wonder what has become of us.\"  He started with long steps towards Lesser Hill, and Adam was soon furtively running in order to keep up with him.     CHAPTER IV--THE LADY ARABELLA MARCH   \"Now, there is no hurry, but so soon as you are both ready we shall start,\" Mr."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],["title","Ronicky Doone (#1)"],["body","was ruining his chances of getting to Stillwater before the train, Bill Gregg watched in marvel and delight the horsemanship of the stranger. Ronicky Doone, if this were he, was certainly the prince of all wild riders.  Even as the mare stopped in answer to the signal of her owner, Ronicky Doone sent his mount over the edge of a veritable cliff, flung him back on his haunches and slid down the gravelly slope, careening from side to side. With a rush of pebbles about him and a dust cloud whirling after, Ronicky Doone broke out into the road ahead of the mare, and she whinnied softly again to greet him.  Bill Gregg found himself looking not into the savage face of such a gunfighter as he had been led to expect, but a handsome fellow, several years younger than he, a high-headed, straight-eyed, buoyant type. In his seat in the saddle, in the poise of his head and the play of his hand on the reins Bill Gregg recognized a boundless nervous force. There was nothing ponderous about Ronicky Doone. Indeed he was not more than middle size, but, as he reined his horse in the middle of the road and looked with flashing eyes at Bill Gregg, he appeared very large indeed.  Gregg was used to fighting or paying his way, or doing both at the same time, as occasion offered. He decided that this was certainly an occasion for much money and few words.  \"You're Doone, I guess,\" he said, \"and you know that I've played a pretty bad trick on you, taking your hoss this way. But I wanted to pay for it, Doone, and I'll pay now. I've got to get to Stillwater before that train. Look at her! I haven't hurt her any. Her wind isn't touched. She's pretty wet, but sweat never hurt nothing on four feet, eh?\"  \"I dunno,\" returned Ronicky Doone. \"I'd as soon run off with a man's wife as his hoss.\"  \"Partner,\" said Bill Gregg desperately, \"I have to get there!\"  \"Then get there on your own feet, not the feet of another gent's hoss.\"  Gregg controlled his rising anger. Beyond him the train was looming larger and larger in the plain, and Stillwater seemed more and more distant. He writhed in the saddle.  \"I tell you I'll pay--I'll pay the whole value of the hoss, if you want.\"  He was about to say more when he saw the eyes of Ronicky Doone widen and fix.  \"Look,\" said the other suddenly, \"you've been cutting her up with the spurs!\"  Gregg glanced down to the flank of the bay to discover that he had used the spurs more recklessly than he thought. A sharp rowel had picked through the skin, and, though it was probably only a slight wound indeed, it had brought a smear of red to the surface.  Ronicky Doone trembled with anger.  \"Confound you!\" he said furiously. \"Any fool would have known that you didn't need a spur on that hoss! What part d'you come from where they teach you to kill a hoss when you ride it? Can you tell me that?\"  \"I'll tell you after I get to Stillwater.\"  \"I'll see you hung before I see you in Stillwater.\"  \"You've talked too much, Doone,\" Gregg said huskily.  \"I've just begun,\" said Doone.  \"Then take this and shut up,\" exclaimed Bill Gregg.  Ordinarily he was the straightest and the squarest man in the world in a fight. But a sudden anger had flared up in him. He had an impulse to kill; to get rid of this obstacle between him and everything he wanted most in life. Without more warning than that he snatched out his revolver and fired point blank at Ronicky Doone. Certainly all the approaches to a fight had been made, and Doone might have been expecting the attack. At any rate, as the gun shot out of Gregg's holster, the other swung himself sidewise in his own saddle and, snapping out his revolver, fired from the hip.  That swerve to the side saved him, doubtless, from the shot of Gregg; his own bullet plowed cleanly through the thigh of the other rider. The whole leg of Gregg went numb, and he found himself slumping helplessly to one side. He dropped his gun, and he had to cling with both hands to lower himself out of the saddle. Now he sat in the dust of the trail and stared stupidly, not at his conqueror, but at the train that was flashing into the little town of Stillwater, just below them.  He hardly heeded Ronicky Doone, as the latter started forward with an oath, knelt beside him and examined the wound. \"It's clean,\" Doone said, as he started ripping up his undershirt to make bandages. \"I'll have you fixed so you can be gotten into Stillwater.\"  He began to work rapidly, twisting the clothes around Gregg's thigh, which he had first laid bare by some dexterous use of a hunting knife.  Then Gregg turned his eyes to those of Doone. The train had pulled out of Stillwater. The sound of the coughing of the engine, as it started up, came faintly to them after a moment.  \"Of all the darned fools!\" said the two men in one voice.  And then they grinned at each other. Certainly it was not the first fight or the first wound for either of them.  \"I'm sorry,\" they began again, speaking together in chorus.  \"Matter of fact,\" said Ronicky Doone, \"that bay means a pile to me. When I seen the red on her side--\"  \"Can't be more than a chance prick.\"  \"I know,\" said Ronicky, \"but I didn't stop to think.\"  \"And I should of give you fair warning before I went for the gat.\"  \"Look here,\" said Ronicky, \"you talk like a straight sort of a gent to me.\"  \"And you thought I was a cross between a hoss thief and a gunfighter?\"  \"I dunno what I thought, except that I wanted the mare back. Stranger, I'm no end sorry this has happened. Maybe you'd lemme know why you was in such a hurry to get to Stillwater. If they's any trouble coming down the road behind you, maybe I can help take care of it for you.\" And he smiled coldly and significantly at Bill Gregg.  The latter eyed with some wonder the man who had just shot him down and was now offering to fight for his safety. \"Nothing like that,\" said Bill. \"I was going to Stillwater to meet a girl.\"  \"As much of a rush as all that to see a girl?\"  \"On that train.\"  Ronicky Doone whistled softly. \"And I messed it up! But why didn't you tell me what you wanted?\"  \"I didn't have a chance. Besides I could not waste time in talking and explaining to everybody along the road.\"  \"Sure you couldn't, but the girl'll forgive you when she finds out what happened.\"  \"No, she won't, because she'll never find out.\"  \"Eh?\"  \"I don't know where she is.\"  \"Riding all that way just to see a girl--\"  \"It's a long story, partner, and this leg is beginning to act up. Tell you the best thing would be for you to jump on your mare and jog into Stillwater for a buckboard and then come back and get me. What d'you say?\"  Twenty minutes after Ronicky Doone had swung into the saddle and raced down the road, the buckboard arrived and the wounded man was helped on to a pile of blankets in the body of the wagon.  The shooting, of course, was explained by the inevitable gun accident. Ronicky Doone happened to be passing along that way and saw Bill Gregg looking over his revolver as he rode along. At that moment the gun exploded and--  The two men who had come out in the buckboard listened to the tale with expressionless faces. As a matter of fact they had already heard in Stillwater that no less a person than Ronicky Doone was on his way toward that village in pursuit of a man who had ridden off on the famous bay mare, Lou. But they accepted Ronicky's bland version of the accident with perfect calm and with many expressions of sympathy. They would have other things to say after they had deposited the wounded man in Stillwater.  The trip in was a painful one for Bill Gregg. For one thing the exhaustion of the long three days' trip was now causing a wave of weariness to sweep over him. The numbness, which had come through the leg immediately after the shooting, was now replaced by a steady and continued aching. And more than all he was unnerved by the sense of utter failure, utter loss. Never in his life had he fought so bitterly and steadily for a thing, and yet he had lost at the very verge of success.     Chapter Three   _At Stillwater_  The true story was, of course, known almost at once, but, since Ronicky Doone swore that he would tackle the first man who accused him of having shot down Bill Gregg, the talk was confined to whispers. In the meantime Stillwater rejoiced in its possession of Ronicky Doone. Beyond one limited section of the mountain desert he was not as yet known, but he had one of those personalities which are called electric. Whatever he did seemed greater because he, Ronicky Doone, had done it.  Not that he had done a great many things as yet. But there was a peculiar feeling in the air that Ronicky Doone was capable of great and strange performances. Men older than he were willing to accept him as their leader; men younger than he idolized him.  Ronicky Doone, then, the admired of all beholders, is leaning in the doorway of Stillwater's second and best hotel. His bandanna today is a terrific yellow, set off with crimson half-moon and stars strewn liberally on it. His shirt is merely white, but it is given some significance by having nearly half of a red silk handkerchief falling out of the breast pocket. His sombrero is one of those works of art which Mexican families pass from father to son, only his was new and had not yet received that limp effect of age. And, like the gaudiest Mexican head piece, the band of this sombrero was of purest gold, beaten into the forms of various saints. Ronicky Doone knew nothing at all about saints, but he approved very much of the animation of the martyrdom scenes and felt reasonably sure that his hatband could not be improved upon in the entire length and breadth of Stillwater, and the young men of the town agreed with him, to say nothing of the girls.  They also admired his riding gloves which, a strange affectation in a country of buckskin, were always the softest and the smoothest and the most comfortable kid that could be obtained.  Truth to tell, he did not handle a rope. He could"]]]
