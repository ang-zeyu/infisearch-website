A few nights later the groom goes to the girl's home carrying with him an empty jar with which he makes the final payment (p. 73). The customary rice ceremony [17] follows and he is then entitled to his bride (p. 73). Should the house or anything in it break at this time, it foretells misfortune for the couple, hence precautions are taken lest such a sign should, by accident, be given (p. 60).  In all but two cases mentioned the girl and her husband go to live with his people. In the first instance their failure to do so raises a protest; in the second, the girl's parents are of much more importance than those of the groom, and this may explain their ability to retain their daughter (pp. 138, 159).  When the bride reaches her future home, she sits on the bamboo floor with her legs stretched out in front of her. The slats which she covers are counted and a string of agate beads, equal in length to the combined width of the slats, is given to her. She now becomes a full member of the family and seems to be under the orders of her mother-in-law (p. 60).  The tales give constant sanction for the marriage of near relatives. Dumanau, we are told, marries his cousin [18], while we frequently meet with such statements as, \"We are relatives and it is good for us to be married\", or \"They saw that they were related and that both possessed magical power, so they were married (p. 35)\". It appears that a man may live with his sweetheart and have children by her, yet leave her, and, without reproach, marry another better fitted to be his wife (p. 54). He may also accept payment for a wife who has deserted him, apparently without loss of prestige (p. 64). No objection seems to be raised to a man having two wives so long as one of these is an inhabitant of the upper world (p. 111), but we find Kanag telling his former sweetheart that he cannot marry her since he is now married to another (p. 138). Again, when two women lay claim to Aponitolau, as their husband, they undergo a test and the loser returns to her former home (p. 94). However, this rule does not prevent a man from having several concubines (p. 120). Gawigawen, we are told, is accompanied to a _pakálon_ by eighteen young girls who are his concubines (p. 59).  Divorce is twice mentioned, but it seems to call out protest only from the cast off wife (pp. 63, 149).  Closely associated with the celebration of a marriage seems to be a ceremony known as _Sayang_, during the progress of which a number of small structures--the largest known as _balaua_--are built. Judging by their names and descriptions, we are justified in considering them \"spirit houses\" as they are to-day.  The details of the extended _Sayang_ ceremony are nowhere given, but so much is made plain:--At its beginning many people pound rice, for use in the offerings and for food, and _da-eng_ [19] is danced (p. 40). After the _Libon_ [20] invitations are sent out, by means of betel-nuts covered with gold, to those whose presence is especially desired (p. 62). When the guests arrive at the village spring or gate they are offered food or drink, and then while they dance they are sprinkled with water or rice, after which all go up to the town (p. 41 note 2). A medium who knows the customs and desires of the spirits constructs a bamboo mat, which is known as _talapitap_, and on it offers food. To call their attention she frequently strikes the ground with the _dakidak_--split sticks of bamboo and _lono_ [21] (p. 40). The guests are not neglected, so far as regards food, for feasting and dancing occupy a considerable portion of their time. The ceremonial dance _da-eng_ is mentioned, but the _tadek_ [22] seems to be the one in special favor (pp. 41, 59).  One tale tells us that the _Sayang_ was held immediately following a head hunt; and another, that Aponitolau went out to get the head of an old man before he started this ceremony (pp. 69, 76); however, the evidence is by no means conclusive that it is related to warfare.  On page 105 we are told that Kanag's half sister is a medium, and the description of her method of summoning the spirits tallies with that of to-day. At the _Sayang_ ceremony she is called to perform the _Dawak_ [23], with the assistance of the old woman Alokotán (p. 106). The _Dawak_ is also held in order to stop the flow of blood from Aponitolau's finger (p. 113). The only other ceremony mentioned is that made in order to find a lost switch (p. 91).  Certain well-known customs are strongly brought out in our material. The first, and apparently most important, is the necessity of offering liquor and food, both to strangers and to guests (p. 58). Refusal is so keenly resented that in one instance a couple decline to allow their daughter to marry a man whose emissaries reject this gift (p. 73). Old quarrels are closed by the tender of food or drink, and friendships are cemented by the drinking of _basi_ [24] (p. 134). People meeting for the first time, and even friends who have been separated for a while, chew betel-nut together and tell their names and places of residence. We are repeatedly told that it is necessary to chew the nut and make known their names, for \"we cannot tell our names unless we chew,\" and \"it is bad for us if we do not know each other's names when we talk.\" A certain etiquette is followed at this time: old men precede the younger; people of the home town, the visitors; and men always are before the women (pp. 45, 133). The conduct of Awig when he serves liquor to the _alzados_ [25] is that of to-day, i.e., the person who serves always drinks before passing it to others (p. 156).  Certain other rules of etiquette or restrictions on conduct come out in the tales. We learn that it is not considered proper for a man to eat with the wife of another during his absence, nor should they start the meal before he comes in (p. 52). The master of a dance is deeply chagrined and chides his wife severely, because she insists on dancing before he has invited all the others to take their turns (p. 70). Greediness is reproved in children and Aponitolau causes the death of his concubines whose false tales had led him to maltreat his wife (p. 116). Unfaithfulness seems to be sufficient justification for a man to abandon his wife and kill her admirer (p. 78); but Kanag appears as a hero when he refuses to attack his father who has sought his life (p. 121).  Of the ceremonies connected with death we learn very little except that the women discard their arm beads, the mourners don old clothing, and all wail for the dead (pp. 44, 90). Three times we are told that the deceased is placed on a _tabalang_, or raft, on which a live rooster is fastened before it is set adrift on the river. In the tales the raft and fowl are of gold, but this is surprising even to the old woman Alokotán, past whose home in Nagbotobotán all these rafts must go (p. 131).  Up to this time in our reconstruction of the life of \"the first times\" we have mentioned nothing impossible or improbable to the present day Tinguian, although, as we shall see later, there are some striking differences in customs and ideas. We have purposely left the description of the people and their practice of magic to the last, although their magical practices invade every activity of their lives, for it is here that the greatest variations from present conditions apparently occur.  These people had intimate relations with some of the lesser spirits, especially with the _liblibayan_ [26], who appear to be little more than their servants, with the evil spirits known as _banbanáyo_, and with the _alan_ (p. 123). The _alan_, just mentioned, are to-day considered as deformed spirits who live in the forests: \"They are as large as people but have wings and can fly; their toes are at the back of their feet and their fingers point backwards from their wrists.\" The several references to them in the tales such as \"you _alan_ girls whose toes on your feet turn out\" indicate they were so considered in the first times (p. 161). Some of them are addressed as \"you _alan_ of the springs,\" and in one instance a man dives down into the water where the _alan_ live (p. 148), but in general their homes seem to be similar to but much finer than those of the people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan. These spirits appear time after time as the foster mothers of the leading characters: Generally they secure a drop of menstrual blood, a miscarriage, or the afterbirth, and all unknown to the real parents, change them into children and raise them (p. 83). These foster children are pictured as living in houses of gold situated near springs, the pebbles of which are of gold or beads; [27] the places where the women set the pots while dipping water are big plates or dishes, while similar dishes form the stepping stones leading up to the house. Articles of gold are found in the dwellings and valuable jars are numerous. When the true relationships of these children are established they always go to their blood parents, carrying with them these riches, which are a source of wonder and comment (pp. 43, 64).  The people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan have many dealings with the celestial bodies. The big star Bagbagak appears as the husband of Sinag--the moon--and father of the star maiden Gaygayóma, who, Aponitolau assures his wife, is a spirit. When this girl comes down to steal sugar-cane she takes off her star dress and appears as a beautiful maiden; [28] she becomes enamored with Aponitolau and takes him to the sky, where he lives with her. They have a child, who later marries in Kadalayapan and thereafter stays below. Upon the occasion when Aponitolau visits his first wife and fails to return to the sky at the appointed time, a great company of stars are sent to fetch him, with orders to devour him if he refuses to obey (p. 109, ff.).

I had for years cherished the wish to undertake a journey to the Holy Land; years are, indeed, required to familiarise one with the idea of so hazardous an enterprise.  When, therefore, my domestic arrangements at length admitted of my absence for at least a year, my chief employment was to prepare myself for this journey.  I read many works bearing on the subject, and was moreover fortunate enough to make the acquaintance of a gentleman who had travelled in the Holy Land some years before.  I was thus enabled to gain much oral information and advice respecting the means of prosecuting my dangerous pilgrimage.  My friends and relations attempted in vain to turn me from my purpose by painting, in the most glowing colours, all the dangers and difficulties which await the traveller in those regions.  \"Men,\" they said, \"were obliged gravely to consider if they had physical strength to endure the fatigues of such a journey, and strength of mind bravely to face the dangers of the plague, the climate, the attacks of insects, bad diet, etc.  And to think of a woman's venturing alone, without protection of any kind, into the wide world, across sea and mountain and plain,--it was quite preposterous.\"  This was the opinion of my friends.  I had nothing to advance in opposition to all this but my firm unchanging determination.  My trust in Providence gave me calmness and strength to set my house in every respect in order.  I made my will, and arranged all my worldly affairs in such a manner that, in the case of my death (an event which I considered more probable than my safe return), my family should find every thing perfectly arranged.  And thus, on the 22d of March 1842, I commenced my journey from Vienna.  At one o'clock in the afternoon I drove to the Kaisermuhlen (Emperor's Mills), from which place the steamboats start for Pesth. I was joyfully surprised by the presence of several of my relations and friends, who wished to say farewell once more.  The parting was certainly most bitter, for the thought involuntarily obtruded itself, \"Should we ever meet again in this world?\"  Our mournful meditations were in some degree disturbed by a loud dispute on board the vessel.  At the request of a gentleman present, one of the passengers was compelled, instead of flying, as he had intended, with bag and baggage to Hungary, to return to Vienna in company of the police.  It appeared he owed the gentleman 1300 florins, and had wished to abscond, but was luckily overtaken before the departure of the boat.  This affair was hardly concluded when the bell rang, the wheels began to revolve, and too soon, alas, my dear ones were out of sight!  I had but few fellow-passengers.  The weather was indeed fine and mild; but the season was not far enough advanced to lure travellers into the wide world, excepting men of business, and those who had cosmopolitan ideas, like myself.  Most of those on board were going only to Presburg, or at farthest to Pesth.  The captain having mentioned that a woman was on board who intended travelling to Constantinople, I was immediately surrounded by curious gazers.  A gentleman who was bound to the same port stepped forward, and offered his services in case I should ever stand in need of them; he afterwards frequently took me under his protection.  The fine mild weather changed to cold and wind as we got fairly out into the great Danube.  I wrapped myself in my cloak, and remained on deck, in order to see the scenery between Vienna and Presburg, which, no doubt, appears lovely enough when nature is clad in the garment of spring; but now I only saw leafless trees and fallow ground--a dreary picture of winter.  Hainburg with its old castle on a rock, Theben with its remarkable fortress, and farther on the large free city of Presburg, have all a striking appearance.  In three hours' time we reached Presburg, and landed in the neighbourhood of the Coronation-hill, an artificial mound, on which the king must stand in his royal robes, and brandish his sword towards the four quarters of the heavens, as a token that he is ready to defend his kingdom against all enemies, from whatever direction they may approach.  Not far from this hill is situate the handsome inn called the \"Two Green Trees,\" where the charges are as high, if not higher, than in Vienna.  Until we have passed Pesth, passengers going down the river are not allowed to remain on board through the night.  March 23d.  This morning we continued our journey at six o'clock.  Immediately below Presburg the Danube divides into two arms, forming the fertile island of Schutt, which is about forty-six miles long and twenty- eight in breadth.  Till we reach Gran the scenery is monotonous enough, but here it improves.  Beautiful hills and several mountains surround the place, imparting a charm of variety to the landscape.  In the evening, at about seven o'clock, we arrived at Pesth. Unfortunately it was already quite dark.  The magnificent houses, or rather palaces, skirting the left bank of the Danube, and the celebrated ancient fortress and town of Ofen on the right, form a splendid spectacle, and invite the traveller to a longer sojourn. As I had passed some days at Pesth several years before, I now only stayed there for one night.  As the traveller must change steamers here, it behoves him to keep a careful eye upon the luggage he has not delivered up at the office in Vienna.  I put up at the \"Hunting-horn,\" a fine hotel, but ridiculously expensive.  A little back room cost me 45 kreutzers (about one shilling and eightpence) for one night.  The whole day I had felt exceedingly unwell.  A violent headache, accompanied by nausea and fever, made me fear the approach of a fit of illness which would interrupt my journey.  These symptoms were probably a consequence of the painful excitement of parting with my friends, added to the change of air.  With some difficulty I gained my modest chamber, and immediately went to bed.  My good constitution was luckily proof against the attacks of all enemies, and waking the next morning, on  March 24th,  in tolerable health, I betook myself on board our new steamboat the Galata, of sixty-horse power:  this boat did not, however, appear to me so tidy and neat as the Marianna, in which we had proceeded from Vienna to Pesth.  Our journey was a rapid one; at ten o'clock in the morning we were already at Feldvar, a place which seems at a distance to be of some magnitude, but which melts away like a soap- bubble on a nearer approach.  By two o'clock we had reached Paks; here, as at all other places of note, we stopped for a quarter of an hour.  A boat rows off from the shore, bringing and fetching back passengers with such marvellous speed, that you have scarcely finished the sentence you are saying to your neighbour before he has vanished.  There is no time even to say farewell.  At about eight o'clock in the evening we reached the market-town of Mohacs, celebrated as the scene of two battles.  The fortress here is used as a prison for criminals.  We could distinguish nothing either of the fortress or the town.  It was already night when we arrived, and at two o'clock in the morning of  March 25th  we weighed anchor.  I was assured, however, that I had lost nothing by this haste.  Some hours afterwards, our ship suddenly struck with so severe a shock, that all hastened on deck to see what was the matter.  Our steersman, who had most probably been more asleep than awake, had given the ship an unskilful turn, in consequence of which, one of the paddles was entangled with some trunks of trees projecting above the surface of the water.  The sailors hurried into the boats,"]]]
