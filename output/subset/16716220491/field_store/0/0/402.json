The Slave-trade, in this point of view, must strike us as an immense mass of evil on account of the criminality attached to it, as displayed in the various branches of it, which have already been examined. For, to take the counterpart of the evil in the first of these, can we say, that no moral turpitude is to be placed to the account of those, who living on the continent of Africa give birth to the enormities, which take place in consequence of the prosecution of this trade? Is not that man made morally worse, who is induced to become a tiger to his species, or who, instigated by avarice, lies in wait in the thicket to get possession of his fellow-man? Is no injustice manifest in the land, where the prince, unfaithful to his duty, seizes his innocent subjects, and sells them for slaves? Are no moral evils produced among those communities, which make war upon other communities for the sake of plunder, and without any previous provocation or offence? Does no crime attach to those, who accuse others falsely, or who multiply and divide crimes for the sake of the profit of the  punishment, and who for the same reason, continue the use of barbarous and absurd ordeals as a test of innocence or guilt?  In the second of these branches the counterpart of the evil is to be seen in the conduct of those, who purchase the miserable natives in their own country, and convey them to distant lands. And here questions, similar to the former, may be asked. Do they experience no corruption of their nature, or become chargeable with no violation of right, who, when they go with their ships to this continent, know the enormities which their visits there will occasion, who buy their fellow-creature man, and this, knowing the way in which he comes into their hands, and who chain, and imprison, and scourge him? Do the moral feelings of those persons escape without injury, whose hearts are hardened? And can the hearts of those be otherwise than hardened, who are familiar with the tears and groans of innocent strangers forcibly torn away from every thing that is dear to them in life, who are accustomed to see them on board their vessels in a state of suffocation and in the agonies of despair, and who are themselves in the habits of the cruel use of arbitrary power?  The counterpart of the evil in its third branch is to be seen in the conduct of those, who, when these miserable people have been landed, purchase and carry them to their respective homes. And let us see whether a mass of wickedness is not generated also in the present case. Can those have nothing to answer for, who separate the faithful ties which nature and religion have created? Can their feelings be otherwise than corrupted, who consider their fellow-creatures as brutes, or treat those as cattle, who may become the temples of the Holy Spirit, and in whom the Divinity disdains not himself to dwell? Is there no injustice in forcing men to labour without wages? Is there no breach of duty, when we are commanded to clothe the naked, and feed the hungry, and visit the sick and in prison, in exposing them to want, in torturing them by cruel punishment, and in grinding them down, by hard labour, so as to shorten their days? Is there no crime in adopting a system, which keeps down all the noble faculties of their souls, and which positively debases and corrupts their nature? Is there no crime in perpetuating these evils among their innocent offspring? And finally, besides all these crimes, is there not naturally in the familiar sight of the exercise, but more especially in the exercise itself, of uncontrolled power, that which vitiates the internal man? In seeing misery stalk daily over the land, do not all become insensibly hardened? By giving birth to that misery themselves, do they not become abandoned? In what state of society are the corrupt appetites so easily, so quickly, and so frequently indulged, and where else, by means of frequent indulgence, do these experience such a monstrous growth? Where else is the temper subject to such frequent irritation, or passion to such little control? Yes--If the unhappy slave is in an unfortunate situation, so is the tyrant who holds him. Action and reaction are equal to each other, as well in the moral as in the natural world. You cannot exercise an improper dominion over a fellow-creature, but by a wise ordering of Providence you must necessarily injure yourself.  Having now considered the nature of the evil of the Slave-trade in its three separate departments of suffering, and in its corresponding counterparts of guilt, I shall make a few observations on the extent of it.  On this subject it must strike us, that the misery and the crimes included in the evil, as it has been found in Africa, were not like common maladies, which make a short or periodical visit and then are gone, but that they were continued daily. Nor were they like diseases, which from local causes attack a village or a town, and by the skill of the physician, under the blessing of Providence, are removed, but they affected a whole continent. The trade with all its horrors began at the river Senegal, and continued, winding with the coast, through its several geographical divisions to Cape Negro; a distance of more than three thousand miles. In various lines or paths formed at right angles from the shore, and passing into the heart of the country, slaves were procured and brought down. The distance, which many of them travelled, was immense. Those, who have been in Africa, have assured us, that they came as far as from the sources of their largest rivers, which we know to be many hundred miles in-land, and the natives have told us, in their way of computation, that they came a journey of many moons.  It must strike us again, that the misery and the crimes, included in the evil, as it has been shown in the transportation, had no ordinary bounds. They were not to be seen in the crossing of a river, but of an ocean. They did not begin in the morning and end at night, but were continued for many weeks, and sometimes by casualties for a quarter of the year. They were not limited to the precincts of a solitary ship, but were spread among many vessels; and these were so constantly passing, that the ocean itself never ceased to be a witness of their existence.  And it must strike us finally, that the misery and crimes, included in the evil as it has been found in foreign lands, were not confined within the shores of a little island. Most of the islands of a continent, and many of these of considerable population and extent, were filled with them. And the continent itself, to which these geographically belong, was widely polluted by their domain. Hence, if we were to take the vast extent of space occupied by these crimes and sufferings from the heart of Africa to its shores, and that which they filled on the continent of America and the islands adjacent, and were to join the crimes and sufferings in one to those in the other by the crimes and sufferings which took place in the track of the vessels successively crossing the Atlantic, we should behold a vast belt as it were of physical and moral evil, reaching through land and ocean to the length of nearly half the circle of the globe.  The next view, which I shall take of this evil, will be as it relates to the difficulty of subduing it.  This difficulty may be supposed to have been more than ordinarily great. Many evils of a public nature, which existed in former times, were the offspring of ignorance and superstition, and they were subdued of course by the progress of light and knowledge. But the evil in question began in avarice. It was nursed also by worldly interest. It did not therefore so easily yield to the usual correctives of disorders in the world. We may observe also, that the interest by which it was thus supported, was not that of a few individuals, nor of one body, but of many bodies of men. It was interwoven again into the system of the commerce and of the revenue of nations. Hence the merchant--the planter--the mortgagee--the manufacturer--the politician--the legislator--the cabinet-minister--lifted up their voices against the annihilation of it. For these reasons the Slave-trade may be considered, like the fabulous hydra, to have had a hundred heads, every one of which it was necessary to cut off before it could be subdued. And as none but Hercules was fitted to conquer the one, so nothing less than extraordinary prudence, courage, labour, and patience, could overcome the other. To protection in this manner by his hundred interests it was owing, that the monster stalked in security for so long a time. He stalked too in the open day, committing his mighty depredations. And when good men, whose duty it was to mark him as the object of their destruction, began to assail him, he did not fly, but gnashed his teeth at them, growling savagely at the same time, and putting himself into a posture of defiance.  We see then, in whatever light we consider the Slave-trade, whether we examine into the nature of it, or whether we look into the extent of it, or whether we estimate the difficulty of subduing it, we must conclude that no evil more monstrous has ever existed upon earth. But if so, then we have proved the truth of the position, that the abolition of it ought to be accounted by us as one of the greatest blessings, and that it ought to be one of the most copious sources of our joy. Indeed I do not know, how we can sufficiently express what we ought to feel upon this occasion. It becomes us as individuals to rejoice. It becomes us as a nation to rejoice. It becomes us even to perpetuate our joy to our posterity.

Briefly defined the chief objects of these studies are:  (1) To introduce the men and women of to-day to that which is most vital in the literature and thought of the Old Testament.  (2) To interpret the often neglected Old Testament into the language of modern life simply and directly and in the light of that which is highest in the teachings of Christianity.  (3) To present the constructive results of the modern historical and literary study of the Bible, not dogmatically but tentatively, so that the reader and student may be in a position to judge for himself regarding the conclusions that are held by a large number of Biblical scholars and to estimate their practical religious value.  (4) To show how closely the Old Testament is related to the life of to-day and how it helps to answer the pressing questions now confronting the nations.  (5) To lead strong men to think through our national, social and individual problems, and to utilize fearlessly and practically the constructive results of modern method and research in the fields of both science and religion.    THE PLAN OF WORK.  These studies are planned to meet the needs of college students and adult Bible classes.  Those who are able to command more time and wish to do more thorough work will find in the list of _Parallel Readings_ on the first page of each study carefully selected references to the best authorities on the subject treated.  For their guidance are also provided _Subjects for Further Study_.  In using this text-book the student may proceed as follows:  (1) Read carefully the Biblical passage indicated in connection with each title; for example, in the first study, Genesis 1 and 2.  (2) Read the Biblical and other quotations on the first page of each study.  Unless otherwise indicated the Biblical quotations are from the American Revised Version.  They include the most important Biblical passages.  The other quotations embody some of the best contributions of ancient and modern writers to the subject under consideration.  (3) Read and think through the material presented under each paragraph.  This material is arranged under six headings for the convenience of those who wish to follow the plan of daily reading and study.    BOOKS OF REFERENCE.

God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them.  And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.--_Gen. 1:27, 28_.   When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,  The moon and the stars which thou hast ordained;  What is man, that thou art mindful of him?  And the son of man that thou visitest him?  For thou hast made him but little lower than God,  And crownest him with glory and honor.  Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thine hands,  Thou hast put all things under his feet.--_Ps. 8: 8-6_.   God clothed men with strength like his own,  And made them according to his own image.  He put the fear of them upon all flesh,  That they should have dominion over beasts and birds.  Mouth and tongue, eyes and ears,  And a mind with which to think he gave them;  With insight and wisdom he filled their minds,  Good and evil he taught them.  Ben Sira. 17, 3-7 (_Hist. Bible_).  All things were made through him; and without him was not any thing made that hath been made.--John 1:3.   I.  DIFFERENT THEORIES OF CREATION.  Every early people naturally asked the questions, How were things made?  How were men created?  First of all, Who made the world? They necessarily answered them according to their own dawning knowledge.  The most primitive races believed that some great animal created the earth and man.  In the Alaskan collection in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania there is a huge crow, sitting upon the mask of a man's face.  This symbolizes the crude belief of the Alaskan Indians regarding the way man was created.  The early Egyptians thought that the earth and man were hatched out of an egg.  In one part of Egypt it was held that the artisan god Ptah broke the egg with his hammer.  In another part of the land and probably at a later date the tradition was current that Thoth the moon god spoke the world into existence.  The earliest Babylonian record states that:    The god Marduk laid a reed on the face of the waters,   He formed dust and poured it out beside the reed;   That he might cause the gods to dwell in the dwellings     of their heart's desire,   He formed mankind.  Later he formed the grass and the rush of the marsh and the forest. Then he created the animals and their young.  The Parsee teachers held that the rival gods, Ahriman and Ormuzd, evolved themselves out of primordial matter and then through the long ages created their attendant hierarchies of angels.  The philosophers of India anticipated in some respects our modern evolutionary theory.  Brahma is thought of as self-existent and eternal.  He gradually condenses himself into material objects, such as ether, fire, water, earth and the elements.  Last of all he manifests himself in man.  The Greek philosophers were the first to attempt to describe creation as a purely physical, generative process.  They taught the evolution of the more complex from the simpler forms.  Plato and Aristotle believed in a transcendental deity and found in the world indications of a vital impulse toward a higher manifestation of life--man.  Michael Angelo, with wonderful dramatic power, in his painting in the Sistine Chapel at Rome has portrayed how lifeless clay in form of man, when touched by the finger of God, by sheer vitalizing power is transformed into a living soul.  Very different yet equally impressive is the modern scientific view.  The origin of matter and of life is so absolutely unknown that scientists have not as yet"]]]
