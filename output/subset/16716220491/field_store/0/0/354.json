I stumbled up after my guide, feeling my way by the hand-rail, and on the first floor followed him into a room similar in size to the one below and very barely furnished, though less squalid than the other. A single candle at the farther end threw its feeble light on a figure in the bed, leaving the rest of the room in a dim twilight.  As Mr. Weiss tiptoed into the chamber, a woman--the one who had spoken to me below--rose from a chair by the bedside and quietly left the room by a second door. My conductor halted, and looking fixedly at the figure in the bed, called out:  \"Philip! Philip! Here is the doctor come to see you.\"  He paused for a moment or two, and, receiving no answer, said: \"He seems to be dozing as usual. Will you go and see what you can make of him?\"  I stepped forward to the bedside, leaving Mr. Weiss at the end of the room near the door by which we had entered, where he remained, slowly and noiselessly pacing backwards and forwards in the semi-obscurity. By the light of the candle I saw an elderly man with good features and a refined, intelligent and even attractive face, but dreadfully emaciated, bloodless and sallow. He lay quite motionless except for the scarcely perceptible rise and fall of his chest; his eyes were nearly closed, his features relaxed, and, though he was not actually asleep, he seemed to be in a dreamy, somnolent, lethargic state, as if under the influence of some narcotic.  I watched him for a minute or so, timing his slow breathing by my watch, and then suddenly and sharply addressed him by name; but the only response was a slight lifting of the eyelids, which, after a brief, drowsy glance at me, slowly subsided to their former position.  I now proceeded to make a physical examination. First, I felt his pulse, grasping his wrist with intentional brusqueness in the hope of rousing him from his stupor. The beats were slow, feeble and slightly irregular, giving clear evidence, if any were needed, of his generally lowered vitality. I listened carefully to his heart, the sounds of which were very distinct through the thin walls of his emaciated chest, but found nothing abnormal beyond the feebleness and uncertainty of its action. Then I turned my attention to his eyes, which I examined closely with the aid of the candle and my ophthalmoscope lens, raising the lids somewhat roughly so as to expose the whole of the irises. He submitted without resistance to my rather ungentle handling of these sensitive structures, and showed no signs of discomfort even when I brought the candle-flame to within a couple of inches of his eyes.  But this extraordinary tolerance of light was easily explained by closer examination; for the pupils were contracted to such an extreme degree that only the very minutest point of black was visible at the centre of the grey iris. Nor was this the only abnormal peculiarity of the sick man's eyes. As he lay on his back, the right iris sagged down slightly towards its centre, showing a distinctly concave surface; and, when I contrived to produce a slight but quick movement of the eyeball, a perceptible undulatory movement could be detected. The patient had, in fact, what is known as a tremulous iris, a condition that is seen in cases where the crystalline lens has been extracted for the cure of cataract, or where it has become accidentally displaced, leaving the iris unsupported. In the present case, the complete condition of the iris made it clear that the ordinary extraction operation had not been performed, nor was I able, on the closest inspection with the aid of my lens, to find any trace of the less common \"needle operation.\" The inference was that the patient had suffered from the accident known as \"dislocation of the lens\"; and this led to the further inference that he was almost or completely blind in the right eye.  This conclusion was, indeed, to some extent negatived by a deep indentation on the bridge of the nose, evidently produced by spectacles, and by marks which I looked for and found behind the ears, corresponding to the hooks or \"curl sides\" of the glasses. For those spectacles which are fitted with curl sides to hook over the ears are usually intended to be worn habitually, and this agreed with the indentation on the nose; which was deeper than would have been accounted for by the merely occasional use of spectacles for reading. But if only one eye was useful, a single eye-glass would have answered the purpose; not that there was any weight in this objection, for a single eye-glass worn constantly would be much less convenient than a pair of hook-sided spectacles.  As to the nature of the patient's illness, only one opinion seemed possible. It was a clear and typical case of opium or morphine poisoning. To this conclusion all his symptoms seemed to point with absolute certainty. The coated tongue, which he protruded slowly and tremulously in response to a command bawled in his ear; his yellow skin and ghastly expression; his contracted pupils and the stupor from which he could hardly be roused by the roughest handling and which yet did not amount to actual insensibility; all these formed a distinct and coherent group of symptoms, not only pointing plainly to the nature of the drug, but also suggesting a very formidable dose.  But this conclusion in its turn raised a very awkward and difficult question. If a large--a poisonous--dose of the drug had been taken, how, and by whom had that dose been administered? The closest scrutiny of the patient's arms and legs failed to reveal a single mark such as would be made by a hypodermic needle. This man was clearly no common morphinomaniac; and in the absence of the usual sprinkling of needlemarks, there was nothing to show or suggest whether the drug had been taken voluntarily by the patient himself or administered by someone else.  And then there remained the possibility that I might, after all, be mistaken in my diagnosis. I felt pretty confident. But the wise man always holds a doubt in reserve. And, in the present case, having regard to the obviously serious condition of the patient, such a doubt was eminently disturbing. Indeed, as I pocketed my stethoscope and took a last look at the motionless, silent figure, I realized that my position was one of extraordinary difficulty and perplexity. On the one hand my suspicions--aroused, naturally enough, by the very unusual circumstances that surrounded my visit--inclined me to extreme reticence; while, on the other, it was evidently my duty to give any information that might prove serviceable to the patient.  As I turned away from the bed Mr. Weiss stopped his slow pacing to and fro and faced me. The feeble light of the candle now fell on him, and I saw him distinctly for the first time. He did not impress me favourably. He was a thick-set, round-shouldered man, a typical fair German with tow-coloured hair, greased and brushed down smoothly, a large, ragged, sandy beard and coarse, sketchy features. His nose was large and thick with a bulbous end, and inclined to a reddish purple, a tint which extended to the adjacent parts of his face as if the colour had run. His eyebrows were large and beetling, overhanging deep-set eyes, and he wore a pair of spectacles which gave him a somewhat owlish expression. His exterior was unprepossessing, and I was in a state of mind that rendered me easily receptive of an unfavourable impression.  \"Well,\" he said, \"what do you make of him?\" I hesitated, still perplexed by the conflicting necessities of caution and frankness, but at length replied:  \"I think rather badly of him, Mr. Weiss. He is in a very low state.\"  \"Yes, I can see that. But have you come to any decision as to the nature of his illness?\"  There was a tone of anxiety and suppressed eagerness in the question which, while it was natural enough in the circumstances, by no means allayed my suspicions, but rather influenced me on the side of caution.  \"I cannot give a very definite opinion at present,\" I replied guardedly. \"The symptoms are rather obscure and might very well indicate several different conditions. They might be due to congestion of the brain, and, if no other explanation were possible, I should incline to that view. The alternative is some narcotic poison, such as opium or morphia.\"  \"But that is quite impossible. There is no such drug in the house, and as he never leaves his room now, he could not get any from outside.\"  \"What about the servants?\" I asked.  \"There are no servants excepting my housekeeper, and she is absolutely trustworthy.\"  \"He might have some store of the drug that you are not aware of. Is he left alone much?\"  \"Very seldom indeed. I spend as much time with him as I can, and when I am not able to be in the room, Mrs Schallibaum, my housekeeper, sits with him.\"  \"Is he often as drowsy as he is now?\"  \"Oh, very often; in fact, I should say that is his usual condition. He rouses up now and again, and then he is quite lucid and natural for, perhaps, an hour or so; but presently he becomes drowsy again and doses off, and remains asleep, or half asleep, for hours on end. Do you know of any disease that takes people in that way?\"  \"No,\" I answered. \"The symptoms are not exactly like those of any disease that is known to me. But they are much very like those of opium poisoning.\"  \"But, my dear sir,\" Mr. Weiss retorted impatiently, \"since it is clearly impossible that it can be opium poisoning, it must be something else. Now, what else can it be? You were speaking of congestion of the brain.\"  \"Yes. But the objection to that is the very complete recovery that seems to take place in the intervals.\"  \"I would not say very complete,\" said Mr. Weiss. \"The recovery is rather comparative. He is lucid and fairly natural in his manner, but he is still dull and lethargic. He does not, for instance, show any desire to go out, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12192"],["title","The Long Shadow (#1)"],["body","-smoked half of his cigarette into the ashes and felt not a quiver of regret. He knew who she was, now; she was the daughter he had heard about, and who belonged to the place where the stove was black and shining and the table had a red cloth with knotted fringe. It must have been her mother whom he had seen there--but she had looked very young to be mother of a young lady.  Charming Billy brought himself rigidly to consider the duties of a host; swept his arm across a bench to clear it of sundry man garments, and asked her again to sit down. When she did so, he saw that her fingers were clasped tightly to hold her from shivering, and he raved inwardly at his shiftlessness the while he hurried to light a fire in the stove.  \"Too bad your horse fell,\" he remarked stupidly, gathering up the handful of shavings he had whittled from a piece of pine board. \"I always hate to see a horse get hurt.\" It was not what he had wanted to say, but he could not seem to put just the right thing into words. What he wanted was to make her feel that there was nothing out of the ordinary in her being there, and that he was helpful and sympathetic without being in the least surprised. In all his life on the range he had never had a young woman walk into a line-camp at dusk--a strange young woman who tried pitifully to be at ease and whose eyes gave the lie to her manner--and he groped confusedly for just the right way in which to meet the situation.  \"I know your father,\" he said, fanning a tiny blaze among the shavings with his hat, which had been on his head until he remembered and removed it in deference to her presence. \"But I ain't a very good neighbor, I guess; I never seem to have time to be sociable. It's lucky your horse fell close enough so yuh could walk in to camp; I've had that happen to me more than once, and it ain't never pleasant--but it's worse when there ain't any camp to walk to. I've had that happen, too.\"  The fire was snapping by then, and manlike he swept the ashes to the floor. The girl watched him, politely disapproving. \"I don't want to be a trouble,\" she said, with less of constraint; for Charming Billy, whether he knew it or not, had reassured her immensely. \"I know men hate to cook, so when I get warm, and the water is hot, I'll cook supper for you,\" she offered. \"And then I won't mind having you help me to get home.\"  \"I guess it won't be any trouble--but I don't mind cooking. You--you better set still and rest,\" murmured Charming Billy, quite red. Of course, she would want supper--and there were dried apricots, and a very little tapioca! He felt viciously that he could kill the Pilgrim and be glad. The Pilgrim was already two days late with the supplies he had been sent after because he was not to be trusted with the duties pertaining to a line-camp--and Billy had not the wide charity that could conjure excuses for the delinquent.  \"I'll let you wash the dishes,\" promised Miss Bridger generously. \"But I'll cook the supper--really, I want to, you know. I won't say I'm not hungry, because I am. This Western air does give one _such_ an appetite, doesn't it? And then I walked miles, it seems to me; so that ought to be an excuse, oughtn't it? Now, if you'll show me where the coffee is--\"  She had risen and was looking at him expectantly, with a half smile that seemed to invite one to comradeship. Charming Billy looked at her helplessly, and turned a shade less brown.  \"The--there isn't any,\" he stammered guiltily. \"The Pilgrim--I mean Walland--Fred Walland--\"  \"It doesn't matter in the least,\" Miss Bridger assured him hastily. \"One can't keep everything in the house all the time, so far from any town. We're often out of things, at home. Last week, only, I upset the vanilla bottle, and then we were completely out of vanilla till just yesterday.\" She smiled again confidingly, and Billy tried to seem very sympathetic--though of a truth, to be out of vanilla did not at that moment seem to him a serious catastrophe. \"And really, I like tea better, you know. I only said coffee because father told me cowboys drink it a great deal. Tea is so much quicker and easier to make.\"  Billy dug his nails into his palms. \"There--Miss Bridger,\" he blurted desperately, \"I've got to tell yuh--there isn't a thing in the shack except some dried apricots--and maybe a spoonful or two of tapioca. The Pilgrim--\" He stopped to search his brain for words applicable to the Pilgrim and still mild enough for the ears of a lady.  \"Well, never mind. We can rough it--it will be lots of fun!\" the girl laughed so readily as almost to deceive Billy, standing there in his misery. That a woman should come to him for help, and he not even able to give her food, was almost unbearable. It were well for the Pilgrim that Charming Billy Boyle could not at that moment lay hands upon him.  \"It will be fun,\" she laughed again in his face. \"If the--the grubstake is down to a whisper (that's the way you say it, isn't it?) there will be all the more credit coming to the cook when you see all the things she can do with dried apricots and tapioca. May I rummage?\"  \"Sure,\" assented Billy, dazedly moving aside so that she might reach the corner where three boxes were nailed by their bottoms to the wall, curtained with gayly flowered calico and used for a cupboard. \"The Pilgrim,\" he began for the third time to explain, \"went after grub and is taking his time about getting back. He'd oughta been here day before yesterday. We might eat his dawg,\" he suggested, gathering spirit now that her back was toward him.  Her face appeared at one side of the calico curtain. \"I know something better than eating the dog,\" she announced triumphantly. \"Down there in the willows where I crossed the creek--I came down that low, saggy place in the hill--I saw a lot of chickens or something--partridges, maybe you call them--roosting in a tree with their feathers all puffed out. It's nearly dark, but they're worth trying for, don't you think? That is, if you have a gun,\" she added, as if she had begun to realize how meagre were his possessions. \"If you don't happen to have one, we can do all right with what there is here, you know.\"  Billy flushed a little, and for answer took down his gun and belt from where they hung upon the wall, buckled the belt around his slim middle and picked up his hat. \"If they're there yet, I'll get some, sure,\" he promised. \"You just keep the fire going till I come back, and I'll wash the dishes. Here, I'll shut the dawg in the house; he's always plumb crazy with ambition to do just what yuh don't want him to do, and I don't want him following.\" He smiled upon her again (he was finding that rather easy to do) and closed the door lingeringly behind him. Having never tried to analyze his feelings, he did not wonder why he stepped so softly along the frozen path that led to the stable, or why he felt that glow of elation which comes to a man only when he has found something precious in his sight.  \"I wish I hadn't eat the last uh the flour this morning,\" he regretted anxiously. \"I coulda made some bread; there's a little yeast powder left in the can. Darn the Pilgrim!\"     CHAPTER II.  _Prune Pie and Coon-can._   Of a truth, Charming Billy Boyle, living his life in the wide land that is too big and too far removed from the man-made world for any but the strong of heart, knew little indeed of women--her kind of women. When he returned with two chickens and found that the floor had been swept so thoroughly as to look strange to him, and that all his scattered belongings were laid in a neat pile upon the foot of the bunk which was unfamiliar under straightened blankets and pitifully plumped pillows, he was filled with astonishment. Miss Bridger smiled a little and went on washing the dishes.  \"It's beginning to storm, isn't it?\" she remarked. \"But we'll eat chicken stew before we--before I start home. If you have a horse that I can borrow till morning, father will bring it back.\"  Billy scattered a handful of feathers on the floor and gained a little time by stooping to pick them up one by one. \"I've been wondering about that,\" he said reluctantly. \"It's just my luck not to have a gentle hoss in camp. I've got two, but they ain't safe for women. The Pilgrim's got one hoss that might uh done if it was here, which it ain't.\"  She looked disturbed, though she tried to hide it. \"I can ride pretty well,\" she ventured.  Without glancing at her, Charming Billy shook his head. \"You're all right here\"--he stopped to pick up more feathers--\"and it wouldn't be safe for yuh to try it. One hoss is mean about mounting; yuh couldn't get within a rod of him. The other one is a holy terror to pitch when anything strange gets near him. I wouldn't let yuh try it.\" Charming Billy was sorry--that showed in his voice--but he was also firm.  Miss Bridger thoughtfully wiped a tin spoon. Billy gave her a furtive look and dropped his head at the way the brightness had gone out of her face. \"They'll be worried, at home,\" she said quietly.  \"A little worry beats a funeral,\" Billy retorted sententiously, instinctively mastering the situation because she was a woman and he must take care of her. \"I reckon I could--\" He stopped abruptly and plucked savagely at a stubborn wing feather.  \"Of course! You could ride over and bring back a horse!\" She caught eagerly at his half-spoken offer. \"It's a lot of bother for you, but I--I'll be very much obliged.\" Her face was bright again.  \"You'd be alone here--\"  \"I'm not the least bit afraid to stay alone. I wouldn't mind that at all.\"  Billy hesitated, met a look in her eyes that he did not like to see there, and yielded. Obviously, from her viewpoint that was the only thing to do. A cowpuncher who has ridden the range since he was sixteen should not shirk a night ride in a blizzard, or fear losing the trail. It was not storming so hard a man might not ride ten miles--that is, a man like Charming Billy Boyle.  After that he was in great haste to"]]]
