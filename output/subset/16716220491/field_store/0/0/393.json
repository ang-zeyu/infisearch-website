Soon, ah, soon the shy birds Will be at their fluting, And the morning planet Rise above the garden;                                                   10 For there is a measure Set to all things mortal.     XIV   Hesperus, bringing together All that the morning star scattered,—  Sheep to be folded in twilight, Children for mothers to fondle,—  Me too will bring to the dearest,                                         5 Tenderest breast in all Lesbos.     XV   In the grey olive-grove a small brown bird Had built her nest and waited for the spring. But who could tell the happy thought that came To lodge beneath my scarlet tunic’s fold?  All day long now is the green earth renewed                               5 With the bright sea-wind and the yellow blossoms. From the cool shade I hear the silver plash Of the blown fountain at the garden’s end.     XVI   In the apple boughs the coolness Murmurs, and the grey leaves flicker Where sleep wanders.  In this garden all the hot noon I await thy fluttering footfall                                           5 Through the twilight.     XVII   Pale rose leaves have fallen In the fountain water; And soft reedy flute-notes Pierce the sultry quiet.  But I wait and listen,                                                    5 Till the trodden gravel Tells me, all impatience, It is Phaon’s footstep.     XVIII   The courtyard of her house is wide And cool and still when day departs. Only the rustle of leaves is there   And running water.  And then her mouth, more delicate                                         5 Than the frail wood-anemone, Brushes my cheek, and deeper grow   The purple shadows.     XIX   There is a medlar-tree Growing in front of my lover’s house,   And there all day The wind makes a pleasant sound.  And when the evening comes,                                               5 We sit there together in the dusk,   And watch the stars Appear in the quiet blue.     XX   I behold Arcturus going westward Down the crowded slope of night-dark azure, While the Scorpion with red Antares Trails along the sea-line to the southward.  From the ilex grove there comes soft laughter,—                          5 My companions at their glad love-making,— While that curly-headed boy from Naxos With his jade flute marks the purple quiet.     XXI   Softly the first step of twilight Falls on the darkening dial, One by one kindle the lights   In Mitylene.  Noises are hushed in the courtyard,                                       5 The busy day is departing, Children are called from their games,—   Herds from their grazing.  And from the deep-shadowed angles Comes the soft murmur of lovers,                                         10 Then through the quiet of dusk   Bright sudden laughter.  From the hushed street, through the portal, Where soon my lover will enter, Comes the pure strain of a flute                                         15   Tender with passion.     XXII   Once you lay upon my bosom, While the long blue-silver moonlight Walked the plain, with that pure passion   All your own.  Now the moon is gone, the Pleiads                                         5 Gone, the dead of night is going; Slips the hour, and on my bed   I lie alone.     XXIII   I loved thee, Atthis, in the long ago, When the great oleanders were in flower In the broad herded meadows full of sun. And we would often at the fall of dusk Wander together by the silver stream,                                     5 When the soft grass-heads were all wet with dew, And purple-misted in the fading light. And joy I knew and sorrow at thy voice, And the superb magnificence of love,— The loneliness that saddens solitude,                                    10 And the sweet speech that makes it durable,— The bitter longing and the keen desire, The sweet companionship through quiet days In the slow ample beauty of the world, And the unutterable glad release                                         15 Within the temple of the holy night. O Atthis, how I loved thee long ago In that fair perished summer by the sea!     XXIV   I shall be ever maiden, If thou be not my lover, And no man shall possess me Henceforth and forever.  But thou alone shalt gather                                               5 This fragile flower of beauty,— To crush and keep the fragrance Like a holy incense.  Thou only shalt remember This love of mine, or hallow                                             10 The coming years with gladness, Calm and pride and passion.     XXV   It was summer when I found you In the meadow long ago,— And the golden vetch was growing   By the shore.  Did we falter when love took us                                           5 With a gust of great desire? Does the barley bid the wind wait   In his course?     XXVI   I recall thy white gown, cinctured With a linen belt, whereon Violets were wrought, and scented With strange perfumes out of Egypt.  And I know thy foot was covered                                           5 With fair Lydian broidered straps; And the petals from a rose-tree Fell within the marble basin.     XXVII   Lover, art thou of a surety Not a learner of the wood-god? Has the madness of his music   Never touched thee?  Ah, thou dear and godlike mortal,                                         5 If Pan takes thee for his pupil, Make me but another Syrinx   For that piping.     XXVIII   With your head thrown backward In my arm’s safe hollow, And your face all rosy With the mounting fervour;  While the grave eyes greaten                                              5 With the wise new wonder, Swimming in a love-mist Like the haze of Autumn;  From that throat, the throbbing Nightingale’s for pleading,                                              10 Wayward, soft, and welling Inarticulate love-notes,  Come the words that bubble Up through broken laughter, Sweeter than spring-water,                                               15 “Gods, I am so happy!”     XXIX   Ah, what am I but a torrent, Headstrong, impetuous, broken, Like the spent clamour of waters   In the blue canyon?  Ah, what art thou but a fern-frond,                                       5 Wet with blown spray from the river, Diffident, lovely, sequestered,   Frail on the rock-ledge?  Yet, are we not for one brief day, While the sun sleeps on the mountain,                                    10 Wild-hearted lover and loved one,   Safe in Pan’s keeping?     XXX   Love shakes my soul, like a mountain wind   Falling upon the trees, When they are swayed and whitened and bowed   As the great gusts will.  I know why Daphne sped through the grove                                  5   When the bright god came by, And shut herself in the laurel’s heart   For her silent doom.  Love fills my heart, like my lover’s breath   Filling the hollow flute,                                              10 Till the magic wood awakes and cries   With remembrance and joy.  Ah, timid Syrinx, do I not know   Thy tremor of sweet fear? For a beautiful and imperious player                                     15   Is the lord of life.     XXXI   Love, let the wind cry On the dark mountain, Bending the ash-trees And the tall hemlocks, With the great voice of                                                   5 Thunderous legions, How I adore thee.  Let the hoarse torrent In the blue canyon, Murmuring mightily                                                       10 Out of the grey mist Of primal chaos, Cease not proclaiming How I adore thee.  Let the long rhythm                                                      15 Of crunching rollers, Breaking and bellowing On the white seaboard, Titan and tireless, Tell, while the world stands,                                            20 How I adore thee.  Love, let the clear call Of the tree-cricket, Frailest of creatures, Green as the young grass,                                                25 Mark with his trilling Resonant bell-note, How I adore thee.  Let the glad lark-song Over the meadow,                                                         30 That melting lyric Of molten silver, Be for a signal To listening mortals, How I adore thee.                                                        35  But more than all sounds, Surer, serener, Fuller with passion And exultation, Let the hushed whisper                                                   40 In thine own heart say, How I adore thee.     XXXII   Heart of mine, if all the altars Of the ages stood before me, Not one pure enough nor sacred Could I find to lay this white, white   Rose of love upon.                                                      5  I who am not great enough to Love thee with this mortal body So impassionate with ardour, But oh, not too small to worship   While the sun shall shine,—                                           10  I would build a fragrant temple To thee, in the dark green forest, Of red cedar and fine sandal, And there love thee with sweet service   All my whole life long.                                                15  I would freshen it with flowers, And the piney hill-wind through it Should be sweetened with soft fervours Of small prayers in gentle language   Thou wouldst smile to hear.                                            20  And a tinkling Eastern wind-bell, With its fluttering inscription, From the rafters with bronze music Should retard the quiet fleeting   Of uncounted hours.                                                    25  And my hero, while so human, Should be even as the gods are, In that shrine of utter gladness, With the tranquil stars above it   And the sea below.                                                     30     XXXIII  Never yet, love, in earth’s lifetime, Hath any cunningest minstrel Told the one seventh of wisdom, Ravishment, ecstasy, transport, Hid in the hue of the hyacinth’s   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],["title","The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#1)"],["body","herself free, and leaped away from him. Her face was bright now, and the promise of smiles was made good.  \"Behave yourself, sir.\" She tossed her head with a familiar backward motion to throw the chestnut hair from her face, and looked at him with eyes veiled slightly under their lashes. \"You will go with Kate and me?\"  Before he could answer, a cry from some one on the plain below attracted their attention. They turned and saw another wagon-train pulling into the settlement. The children were shooting and running alongside the weary oxen; men and women went forward expectantly.  \"That must be the train uncle expected. Let us go down,\" said Nell.  Joe did not answer; but followed her down the path. When they gained a clump of willows near the cabins he bent forward and took her hand. She saw the reckless gleam in his eyes.  \"Don't. They'll see,\" she whispered.  \"If that's the only reason you have, I reckon I don't care,\" said Joe.  \"What do you mean? I didn't say--I didn't tell--oh! let me go!\" implored Nell.  She tried to release the hand Joe had grasped in his broad palm, but in vain; the more she struggled the firmer was his hold. A frown wrinkled her brow and her eyes sparkled with spirit. She saw the fur-trader's wife looking out of the window, and remembered laughing and telling the good woman she did not like this young man; it was, perhaps, because she feared those sharp eyes that she resented his audacity. She opened her mouth to rebuke him; but no words came. Joe had bent his head and softly closed her lips with his own.  For the single instant during which Nell stood transfixed, as if with surprise, and looking up at Joe, she was dumb. Usually the girl was ready with sharp or saucy words and impulsive in her movements; but now the bewilderment of being kissed, particularly within view of the trader's wife, confused her. Then she heard voices, and as Joe turned away with a smile on his face, the unusual warmth in her heart was followed by an angry throbbing.  Joe's tall figure stood out distinctly as he leisurely strolled toward the incoming wagon-train without looking backward. Flashing after him a glance that boded wordy trouble in the future, she ran into the cabin.  As she entered the door it seemed certain the grizzled frontiersman sitting on the bench outside had grinned knowingly at her, and winked as if to say he would keep her secret. Mrs. Wentz, the fur-trader's wife, was seated by the open window which faced the fort; she was a large woman, strong of feature, and with that calm placidity of expression common to people who have lived long in sparsely populated districts. Nell glanced furtively at her and thought she detected the shadow of a smile in the gray eyes.  \"I saw you and your sweetheart makin' love behind the willow,\" Mrs. Wentz said in a matter-of-fact voice. \"I don't see why you need hide to do it. We folks out here like to see the young people sparkin'. Your young man is a fine-appearin' chap. I felt certain you was sweethearts, for all you allowed you'd known him only a few days. Lize Davis said she saw he was sweet on you. I like his face. Jake, my man, says as how he'll make a good husband for you, and he'll take to the frontier like a duck does to water. I'm sorry you'll not tarry here awhile. We don't see many lasses, especially any as pretty as you, and you'll find it more quiet and lonesome the farther West you get. Jake knows all about Fort Henry, and Jeff Lynn, the hunter outside, he knows Eb and Jack Zane, and Wetzel, and all those Fort Henry men. You'll be gettin' married out there, won't you?\"  \"You are--quite wrong,\" said Nell, who all the while Mrs. Wentz was speaking grew rosier and rosier. \"We're not anything---\"  Then Nell hesitated and finally ceased speaking. She saw that denials or explanations were futile; the simple woman had seen the kiss, and formed her own conclusions. During the few days Nell had spent at Fort Pitt, she had come to understand that the dwellers on the frontier took everything as a matter of course. She had seen them manifest a certain pleasure; but neither surprise, concern, nor any of the quick impulses so common among other people. And this was another lesson Nell took to heart. She realized that she was entering upon a life absolutely different from her former one, and the thought caused her to shrink from the ordeal. Yet all the suggestions regarding her future home; the stories told about Indians, renegades, and of the wild border-life, fascinated her. These people who had settled in this wild region were simple, honest and brave; they accepted what came as facts not to be questioned, and believed what looked true. Evidently the fur-trader's wife and her female neighbors had settled in their minds the relation in which the girl stood to Joe.  This latter reflection heightened Nell's resentment toward her lover. She stood with her face turned away from Mrs. Wentz; the little frown deepened, and she nervously tapped her foot on the floor.  \"Where is my sister?\" she presently asked.  \"She went to see the wagon-train come in. Everybody's out there.\"  Nell deliberated a moment and then went into the open air. She saw a number of canvas-covered wagons drawn up in front of the cabins; the vehicles were dusty and the wheels encrusted with yellow mud. The grizzled frontiersman who had smiled at Nell stood leaning on his gun, talking to three men, whose travel-stained and worn homespun clothes suggested a long and toilsome journey. There was the bustle of excitement incident to the arrival of strangers; to the quick exchange of greetings, the unloading of wagons and unharnessing of horses and oxen.  Nell looked here and there for her sister. Finally she saw her standing near her uncle while he conversed with one of the teamsters. The girl did not approach them; but glanced quickly around in search of some one else. At length she saw Joe unloading goods from one of the wagons; his back was turned toward her, but she at once recognized the challenge conveyed by the broad shoulders. She saw no other person; gave heed to nothing save what was to her, righteous indignation.  Hearing her footsteps, the young man turned, glancing at her admiringly, said:  \"Good evening, Miss.\"  Nell had not expected such a matter-of-fact greeting from Joe. There was not the slightest trace of repentance in his calm face, and he placidly continued his labor.  \"Aren't you sorry you--you treated me so?\" burst out Nell.  His coolness was exasperating. Instead of the contrition and apology she had expected, and which was her due, he evidently intended to tease her, as he had done so often.  The young man dropped a blanket and stared.  \"I don't understand,\" he said, gravely. \"I never saw you before.\"  This was too much for quick-tempered Nell. She had had some vague idea of forgiving him, after he had sued sufficiently for pardon; but now, forgetting her good intentions in the belief that he was making sport of her when he should have pleaded for forgiveness, she swiftly raised her hand and slapped him smartly.  The red blood flamed to the young man's face; as he staggered backward with his hand to his cheek, she heard a smothered exclamation behind her, and then the quick, joyous barking of a dog.  When Nell turned she was amazed to see Joe standing beside the wagon, while a big white dog was leaping upon him. Suddenly she felt faint. Bewildered, she looked from Joe to the man she had just struck; but could not say which was the man who professed to love her.  \"Jim! So you followed me!\" cried Joe, starting forward and flinging his arms around the other.  \"Yes, Joe, and right glad I am to find you,\" answered the young man, while a peculiar expression of pleasure came over his face.  \"It's good to see you again! And here's my old dog Mose! But how on earth did you know? Where did you strike my trail? What are you going to do out here on the frontier? Tell me all. What happened after I left---\"  Then Joe saw Nell standing nearby, pale and distressed, and he felt something was amiss. He glanced quickly from her to his brother; she seemed to be dazed, and Jim looked grave.  \"What the deuce--? Nell, this is my brother Jim, the one I told you about. Jim, this is my friend, Miss Wells.\"  \"I am happy to meet Miss Wells,\" said Jim, with a smile, \"even though she did slap my face for nothing.\"  \"Slapped you? What for?\" Then the truth dawned on Joe, and he laughed until the tears came into his eyes. \"She took you for me! Ha, ha, ha! Oh, this is great!\"  Nell's face was now rosy red and moisture glistened in her eyes; but she tried bravely to stand her ground. Humiliation had taken the place of anger.  \"I--I--am sorry, Mr. Downs. I did take you for him. He--he has insulted me.\" Then she turned and ran into the cabin.    Chapter II.  Joe and Jim were singularly alike. They were nearly the same size, very tall, but so heavily built as to appear of medium height, while their grey eyes and, indeed, every feature of their clean-cut faces corresponded so exactly as to proclaim them brothers.  \"Already up to your old tricks?\" asked Jim, with his hand on Joe's shoulder, as they both watched Nell's flight.  \"I'm really fond of her, Jim, and didn't mean to hurt her feelings. But tell me about yourself; what made you come West?\"  \"To teach the Indians, and I was, no doubt, strongly influenced by your being here.\"  \"You're going to do as you ever have--make some sacrifice. You are always devoting yourself; if not to me, to some other. Now it's your life you're giving up. To try to convert the redskins and influence me for good is in both cases impossible. How often have I said there wasn't any good in me! My desire is to kill Indians, not preach to them, Jim. I'm glad to see you; but I wish you hadn't come. This wild frontier is no place for a preacher.\"  \"I think it is,\" said Jim, quietly.  \"What of Rose--the girl you were to marry?\"  Joe glanced quickly at his brother. Jim's face"]]]
