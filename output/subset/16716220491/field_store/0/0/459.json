They had succeed in mastering the comparatively simple art of assaying gold and silver.  So now, with the summer past, we find our young engineers out in Nevada, taking a little more rest just because no new engineering task of sufficient importance had presented itself.  \"If we're going to be engineers out West, though, Harry, we simply must know a good deal about assaying precious metals,\" Tom had declared.  So, though the chums were \"taking a rest,\" as they phrased it, they had brought with them a small furnace and the rest of the outfit for assaying minerals in small quantities.  Today, however, was altogether too fine for thoughts of work.  Just after breakfast Harry Hazelton had borrowed the only horse in camp, belonging to Jim Ferrers, their cook and guide, and had ridden away for the day.  Barely had Hazelton departed when Alf Drew, hungry, lonely and wistful, had happened along.  He asked for \"a job.\"  There really wasn't one for him, but good-natured Reade created one, offering five dollars a month and board.  \"No telling, young man, how long the job will last,\" Tom warned him. \"We may at any hour break camp and get away.\"  But Alf had taken the job and gratefully.  Not until after the noon meal had the little fellow revealed his unfortunate vice for cigarette smoking.  \"You've simply got to give up that habit, Alf\" Tom urged, as they walked along.  \"You can't make me,\" retorted young Drew.  \"You've no right to.\"  \"No, I haven't,\" Tom admitted soberly.  \"If I had any real rights over you I'm afraid I'd turn you over my knee and spank you, three times a day, until you gave up the beastly habit.\"  \"You're not going to bounce me, are you?\" asked Alf.  \"No; I'll keep you here as long as we can use a boy.  But, mark me, Alf, somehow, and before very long, I'm going to break you from your cigarettes.  I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I'm going to do it just the same!\"  Alf Drew looked uncommonly solemn, but he said nothing.  For five minutes more they walked on, then came suddenly out from under a line of trees and stood at the edge of a low cliff, gazing down in astonishment at the gully below them.  \"What on earth-----\" began Tom Reade, in amazement.  \"Let's scoot!\" begged Alf tremulously.  \"There's going to be some killing right down there!\"  It certainly looked that way.  In the gully three automobiles, showing the effects of long travel over hard roads, stood close together.  More than a dozen people, all but two of whom were dressed in \"eastern\" clothes, stood by the machines.  Two of the party were women, and one a girl of twelve.  The two men who belonged to the party, but did not appear to be \"eastern,\" had drawn revolvers, and now stood facing four sullen-looking men who stood with the butts of their rifles resting on the ground.  \"Gracious!  We can't have any shooting with women and children standing around to get hit!\" gasped Tom Reade.     CHAPTER II  TROUBLE BREWS ON THE TRAIL   So silent had been the approach of Tom and his waif companion that those below had not perceived them.  Moreover, judging from the expressions on the faces of the people almost at Reade's feet, they were all too deeply absorbed in their own business to have any eyes or ears for outside matters.  Through the scene below was one of armed truce that might, at any moment, break into hostilities, with human lives at stake, Tom glanced coolly downward for a few seconds after his first startled, unheard remark.  \"I'm going, to duck out of this,\" whispered Alf Drew, whose slim little figure was shaking in a way suggestive of chills.  \"Don't be in a hurry,\" Tom murmured.  \"We may be of some use to some of these people.\"  \"Tote those guns away, friends,\" spoke one of the revolver-armed men with the automobile party, \"and march yourselves under the guns.  Remember, we have women here.\"  \"They can get away,\" returned one of the sullen-faced men with rifles. \"We won't hinder 'em.  We'll give 'em two full minutes to get where it's safe.  Then we're going to turn our talking machines loose.\"  From the top of the low cliff came Tom Meade's drawling voice:  \"Oh, I say, friends!\"  Startled, all below glanced quickly upward.  \"There seems to be trouble down there,\" Tom suggested.  \"There sure is,\" nodded one of the armed men with the automobile party.  \"Now, it's too glorious a day to spoil it with fighting,\" Reade went on.  \"Can't we arbitrate?\"  \"The first move for you, young man,\" warned one of the four men, raising his rifle, \"is to face about and git outer here.\"  \"Not while there are women and children present who might get hurt,\" Tom dissented, with a shake of his head.  \"Git, I tell you!\" shouted the man, now aiming his rifle full at Tom's chest.  Git---before I count five.\"  \"Save your cartridge,\" proposed Tom.  \"I'm too poor game, and I'm not armed, either.  Surely you wouldn't shoot a harmless orphan like me.\"  Saying which the young engineer, having found a path down the cliff nearby, started slowly to descend.  \"Get back there!  Another step, and I'll put a ball through you!\" roared the man who had Reade covered with his rifle.  \"That wouldn't prove anything but your marksmanship,\" Suggested Tom, and coolly continued to descend.  \"Going to get back?\" howled the man behind the gun.  Without further answer Reade quickened his pace somewhat, reaching the flat bottom of the gully on a run.  Though he felt that the chances were eight out of ten that he would be shot at any second, Tom didn't betray any outward fear.  The truth was that even if he wanted to stop, he would have found it somewhat difficult on that steep incline.  Where he landed, on his feet, Tom stood between the hostile parties. Had hostilities opened at that moment he would have been in a bad position between the two fires.  \"Great Scott!\" gasped the frightened Alf, peering down.  That youngster had thrown himself flat on his stomach his head behind a bush.  He was trying to make himself as small as possible. \"Whew!  But Reade has the real grit!\"  First of all Tom gazed curiously at the four men, who glared back at him with looks full of hate.  \"Who are you, anyway?\" demanded the spokesman of the sullen four.  \"I might be the sheriff,\" Tom replied placidly.  \"Huh!\" retorted the spokesman.  \"But I'm not,\" Tom went on, rather genially.  \"I'm just an inquisitive tourist.\"  \"Heard o' Bald Knob?\" demanded the leader of the four.  \"No,\" admitted Reade, opening his eyes with interest.  \"Who is he, and how did he become bald?\"  \"Bald Knob is a place,\" came the information.  \"It's the place where inquisitive tourists are buried in these parts.\"  \"I'll look it up some day,\" Tom promised, good-humoredly.  \"You'll look it up before dark if we have time to pack you there,\" growled the leader of the men.  \"Now, are you going to stand aside?\"  Tom shook his head.  \"Let's shake hands all around and then sit down for a nice little talk,\" the young engineer suggested.  \"There's been too much talk already,\" snarled Tom's antagonist.  The men of the automobile party were silent.  They had scented in Tom an ally who would help their cause materially.  \"Then you won't be sociable?\" Reade demanded, as if half offended.  \"Git out and go about your business,\" ordered the leader of the four men.  \"It's always my business when women and children appear to be in danger,\" returned Tom.  He turned on his heel, presenting his broad back as a target to the rifles as he stepped over to automobile party.  Oddly the four men, though they had the look of being desperate, did not offer to shoot.  Tom's audacity had almost cowed them for the moment.  \"I hope I can be of some use to you,\" suggested Tom, raising his hat out of respect to the women.  \"I reckon you can, if you're a good hand with a gun,\" replied the older of the two armed men with the motor party.  \"Got any shooting irons about you?\"  \"Nothing in that line,\" Tom admitted.  \"Then reach under the cushion, left-hand front seat of that car,\" returned the same speaker.  \"You'll find an automatic revolver there.\"  Reade, however, chose to ignore the advice.  He had small taste for the use of firearms.  Seeing, the young engineer's reluctance the younger of the two armed men went himself to the car, taking out the revolver and offering it to this cool young stranger.  \"Thank you,\" was Tom's smiling reply.  \"But that tool is not for me.  I'm the two-hundred-and-thirteenth vice president of the Peace Society.\"  \"You'd better fight, or hike,\" advised the older of the two men. \"This isn't going to be a safe place for just nothing but chin. And, ladies, I ask you to get behind one of the cars, since you won't leave here.  Throw yourselves flat on your faces.  We don't want any good women hit by any such mean rascals as that crowd over there.\"  The men with the rifles scowled dangerously.  \"Now, listen to me---all hands,\" begged Tom, raising his right hand. \"It's none of my business, as I very well know, but may I inquire what all this trouble is about?\"  A rather portly, well dressed and well-groomed man of sixty, who had been leaning against the side of one of the cars, now spoke up promptly enough:  \"I am head of the company that has legally staked out a claim here, young man.  Ours is a mining company.  The men yonder say that they own the claim---that they found it first, and that it is theirs.  However, they never staked it off---never filed their claim.\"  \"It's our claim, just the same,\" spoke up the at the four men. \"And we won't have it jumped by any gang of tenderfeet on earth. So get out of here, all of you, or the music will start at once. We don't want to hit any woman or children, but we're going to hold our own property.  If the women and the child won't get out of here, then they'll have to take their chances.\"  \"That's the case, and the line of action!\" growled"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12778"],["title","The Young Engineers in Mexico; Or, Fighting the Mine Swindlers (#1)"],["body"," enemies to-day,\" cried the Mexican.  \"Why should I?  I am generous and indulgent, and the soul of honor. No one has just reason to disagree with me.  Here I give all men the round trade--no, what in your country you call the square deal.  But you shall see.  You are now associated with me in a great, a gr-r-rand enterprise.  You shall soon see how just and generous I can be--am always.  You shall understand why the son of a noble house need have no foes.  Senor Tomaso, I have taken one great liking to you in the few hours that we have been together. And as for you, Senor Henrico--\"  With a courtly flourish Don Luis wheeled about to face young Hazelton. But the sound of deep breathing was all that came from Harry. Fatigued by the long, rough automobile ride, that young engineer had dropped fast asleep in the broad porch rocker.  \"Your friend is much fatigued,\" spoke Don Luis, with fine consideration. \"If you deem it best, Senor Tomaso, we will arouse him and he shall go to his room for an hour's sleep before the evening meal.\"  \"If his sleeping in the chair doesn't annoy you, Don Luis, my friend will wake up, refreshed, in twenty minutes or so.\"  \"So be it, then.  Let him sleep where he is.  But you, Senor Tomaso, would you not like to step inside and lie down for a while?\"  \"No, I thank you,\" Reade answered.  \"Unlike Hazelton, I feel very wide awake.  When shall we go to the mine?\"  \"To-morrow, or the next day,\" replied the Mexican, with a gesture which almost said that \"any day\" would do.  \"First, you must both rest until you are wholly refreshed.  Then you may want to stroll about the country a bit, and see the odd bits of natural beauty in these mountains, before you give too serious thought to work.\"  \"But that is not our way, Don Luis,\" Tom objected.  \"When we are paid a thousand dollars a month apiece we expect to do an honest day's work six days in every week.\"  \"Ah, then, to-morrow, perhaps we will talk about the work.  And now, if you will pardon me, I will go inside for a few minutes in order to see about some business matters.\"  Readers of the \"_Grammar School Boys Series_,\" the \"_High School Boys Series_\" and of the preceding volumes in the present series, will feel that they are already intimately acquainted with Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, a pair of young civil engineers who, through sheer grit, persistence and hard study had already made themselves well known in their profession.  In the first volume of the \"_Grammar School Boys Series_,\" Dick Prescott and his five boy chums, Greg Holmes, Dave Darrin, Dan Dalzell, Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, were introduced under the name of Dick & Co. These six chums, standing shoulder to shoulder, made a famous sextette in school athletics.  Their start was made during their grammar school days, when they had many adventures and did much in the field of junior sport.  Their high school life, as set forth in the series of that name, was one of athletics, mixed with much study and efforts to find their true paths in life.  In high school athletics the members of Dick & Co. won a statewide reputation, as to-day members of winning high school athletic teams are bound to do.  It was during their high school days that Dick & Co. determined on their professions through life. Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes both secured competitive appointments to the United States Military Academy, and their further doings are set forth in the \"_West Point Series_.\"  Dave Darrin and Dalzell, with a burning desire for naval life, obtained appointments to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.  What befell them is fully told in the \"_Annapolis Series_.\"  As for Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, while still in high school they became seized with a strong desire for careers as civil engineers.  They were fortunate enough to secure their first practice and training in a local engineering office in the home town of Gridley.  Then, with vastly more courage than training, Tom and Harry went forth into the world to stand or fall as engineers.  Their first experiences are told in the opening volume of this series, \"_The Young Engineers In Colorado_.\"  Joining a western engineering force as \"cub\" engineers, at first the laughing-stock of the older engineers on the staff of a new railroad then building in Colorado, the two boys did their best to make good.  How well they succeeded is known to readers of that volume.  Their adventures in the Rocky Mountains were truly astounding; some of them, especially those with \"Bad Pete,\" a braggart and scoundrel of the old school, were sometimes mirth-provoking and sometimes tragic.  Other adventures were vastly more serious.  When the boys reached the crisis of their work it seemed as though every tree in the mountains concealed an enemy.  All these and many more details are told in that first volume.  In \"_The Young Engineers In Arizona_,\" we found the pair engaged in a wholly new task--that of filling up an apparently unfillable quicksand in the desert so that a railway roadbed might be built safely over the dangerous quicksand that had justly earned the name of the \"Man-killer.\"  Here, too, adventures quickly appeared and multiplied, until even the fearful quicksand became a matter of smaller importance to the chums.  How the two young engineers persevered and fought pluckily all the human and other obstacles to their success the readers of the second volume now know fully.  Then Tom and Harry, who had been putting in many spare hours, days and weeks on the study of metallurgy and the assaying of precious metals, went, for a \"vacation,\" to Nevada, there further to pursue their studies.  Quite naturally they became interested in gold mining itself, and all their adventures, their mishaps, failures, fights and final successes were fully chronicled in the third volume, entitled \"_The Young Engineers in Nevada_.\"  The mine that finally proved a dividend payer was named \"The Ambition Mine.\"  A staunch Nevadan, Jim Ferrers, by name, became their partner in the Ambition.  Jim, who was an old hand at Nevada mining, was now managing the mine while Tom and Harry, after going East and establishing an engineers' office in a large city not far from New York, had traveled to other states, studying mines and assay methods.  Within the last few months, so rapid had been their progress in mine engineering, that they had been consulted by a number of mine owners.  Articles that they had written had appeared in journals devoted to mining and engineering, and the fame of our two friends had been rapidly spreading.  Both scrupulously honest in all things, Reade and Hazelton had also won a reputation as \"square\" mining men.  With their skill and honesty established, the opinions of the two partners on mining problems were generally respected wherever they happened to be known.  So, in time, Luis Montez had heard of them, and had decided that he needed their services at _El Sombrero_ (The Hat) Mine in the Mexican state of Bonista.  After some correspondence the two engineers had been speedily engaged, and the opening of this volume deals with the time of their arrival at the handsome country house of Senor Montez.  After his host had gone inside, and Harry Hazelton slept on, Tom, who had risen--to bow to Senor Montez, remained on his feet, pacing slowly and thoughtfully up and down the porch.  \"Now that I've seen my new employer,\" mused Tom, under his breath, \"I wonder just how much I really like him.  He's a polished man, and a charming fellow from the little that I've seen of him. But his talk of ruling these hills, even in life and death--does that speak well for him.  Is he a knave, or only a harmless braggart? Is he a man against whom one should be seriously on his guard? Don Luis's manners, in general, I admire, but I don't quite like the cruel expression about his month when he laughs.  However, that may be the way of the country, and I may be the victim of prejudice.  Anyway, as far as Harry and I are concerned, we needn't worry much about the kind of man Don Luis is.  The few thousands of dollars that he will owe us as his engineers we are pretty certain to get, for Don Luis is a very wealthy man, and he couldn't afford to cheat us.  For the rest, all he wants us to do is to work hard as engineers and show him how to get more valuable ore out of his mines.  So, no matter what kind of man Don Luis may be, we have nothing to fear from him--not even being cheated out of our pay.\"  Having settled this in his mind, Tom Reade sank into one of the roomy porch chairs, half closing his eyes.  He was soon in danger of being as sound asleep as was Harry Hazelton.  Certainly Reade would have been intensely interested had he been able to render himself invisible and thus to step into one of the rooms of the big, handsome house.  In a room that was half office, half library, Senor Luis Montez was now closeted with another man, whom neither of the engineers had yet met.  This man was short, slight of build and nervous of action and gesture--a young man perhaps twenty-six years of age.  Carlos Tisco was secretary to Don Luis.  Tisco was a graduate of a university at the capital City of Mexico, a doctor of philosophy, no mean chemist, a clever assayer of precious metals and an engineer. In a word Dr. Tisco had been so well trained in many fields of science that it was a wonder that Don Luis should feel the need of employing the two young American engineers.  \"You have seen my new engineers, Carlos?\" queried Don Luis, almost in a whisper, as the two men, bending forward, faced each other over a flat-top desk.  \"Through the window shutters--yes, Don Luis,\" nodded the secretary, a strange look in his eyes.  \"Then what do you think of the Gringo pair, my good Carlos?\" pursued Don Luis.  \"Gringo\" is a word of contempt applied by some Mexicans to Americans.  \"I--I hardly like to tell you, Don Luis,\" replied the younger man, with an air of pretended embarrassment.  \"Ah!  Then no"]]]
