The only drawback to Dab's happiness that day was that his acquaintances hardly seemed to know him. He had had almost the same trouble with himself, when he looked in the glass that morning.  Ordinarily, his wrists were several inches through his coat-sleeves, and his ankles made a perpetual show of his stockings. His neck, too, seemed to be holding his head as far as possible from his coat-collar, and his buttons had no favors to ask of his button-holes.  Now, even as the tailor had promised, he had received his \"first fit.\" He seemed to himself, to tell the truth, to be covered up in a prodigal waste of new cloth. Would he ever, ever, grow too big for such a suit of clothes as that? It was a very painful thought, and he did his best to put it away from him.  Still, it was a little hard to have a young lady, whom he had known since before she began to walk, remark to him,--  \"Excuse me, sir, but can you tell me if Mr. Dabney Kinzer is here?\"  \"No, Jenny Walters,\" sharply responded Dab, \"he isn't here.\"  \"Why, Dabney!\" exclaimed the pretty Jenny. \"Is that you? I declare, you have scared me out of a year's growth!\"  \"I wish you'd scare me, then,\" said Dab. \"Then my clothes would stay fitted.\"  Every thing had been so well arranged beforehand, thanks to Mrs. Kinzer, that the wedding had no chance at all except to go off well. Ham Morris was rejoiced to find how entirely he was relieved of every responsibility.  \"Don't worry about your house,\" the widow said to him, the night before the wedding. \"We'll go over there, as soon as you and Miranda get away, and it'll be all ready for you by the time you get back.\"  \"All right,\" said Ham. \"I'll be glad to have you take the old place in hand. I've only tried to live in a corner of it. You don't know how much room there is. I don't, I must say.\"  Dabney had longed to ask her if she meant to have it moved over to the Kinzer side of the north fence, but he had doubts as to the propriety of it; and just then the boy came in from the tailor's with his bundle of new clothes.      CHAPTER II.  DAB'S OLD CLOTHES GET A NEW BOY TO FIT.   Hamilton Morris was a very promising young man, of some thirty summers. He had been an \"orphan\" for a dozen years; and the wonder was that he should so long have lived alone in the big, square-built house his father left him. At all events, Miranda Kinzer was just the wife for him.  Miranda's mother had seen that at a glance, the moment her mind was settled about the house. As to that and his great, spreading, half-cultivated farm, all either of them needed was ready money and management.  These were blessings Ham was now made reasonably sure of, on his return from his wedding-trip, and he was likely to appreciate them.  As for Dabney Kinzer, he was in no respect overcome by the novelty and excitement of the wedding-day. All the rest of it, after the departure of Ham Morris and the bride, he devoted himself to such duties as were assigned him, with a new and grand idea steadily taking shape in his mind. He felt as if his brains too, like his body, were growing. Some of his mother's older and more intimate friends remained with her all day, probably to comfort her for the loss of Miranda; and two or three of them, Dab knew, would stay to tea, so that his services would be in demand to see them safely home.  All day long, moreover, Samantha and Keziah and Pamela seemed to find themselves wonderfully busy, one way and another, so that they paid even less attention than usual to any of the ins and outs of their brother.  Dabney was therefore able, with little difficulty, to take for himself whatever of odd time he might require for putting his new idea into execution.  Mrs. Kinzer herself noticed the rare good sense with which her son hurried through with his dinner, and slipped away, leaving her in undisturbed possession of the table and her lady guests, and neither she nor either of the girls had a thought of following him.  If they had done so, they might have seen him draw a good-sized bundle out from under the lilac-thicket in the back yard, and hurry down through the garden.  A few moments more, and Dabney had appeared on the fence of the old cross-road leading down to the shore. There he sat, eying one passer-by after another, till he suddenly sprang from his perch, exclaiming,--  \"That's just the chap! Why, they'll fit him, and that's more'n they ever did for me.\"  Dab would probably have had to search along the coast for miles before he could have found a human being better suited to his present charitable purposes than the boy who now came so lazily down the road.  There was no doubt about his color, or that he was all over of about the same shade of black. His old tow trowsers and calico shirt revealed the shining fact in too many places to leave room for a question, and shoes he had none.  \"Dick,\" said Dabney, \"was you ever married?\"  \"Married!\" exclaimed Dick, with a peal of very musical laughter, \"is I married? No. Is you?\"  \"No,\" replied Dabney; \"but I was very near it, this morning.\"  \"Dat so?\" asked Dick, with another show of his white teeth. \"Done ye good, den; nebber seen ye I look so nice afore.\"  \"You'd look nicer'n I do if you were only dressed up,\" said Dab. \"Just you put on these.\"  \"Golly!\" exclaimed the black boy. But he seized the bundle Dab threw him, and he had it open in a twinkling.  \"Any t'ing in de pockets?\" he asked.  \"Guess not,\" said Dab; \"but there's lots of room.\"  \"Say dar was,\" exclaimed Dick. \"But won't dese t'ings be warm?\"  It was quite likely; for the day was not a cool one, and Dick never seemed to think of getting off what he had on, before getting into his unexpected present. Coat, vest, and trousers, they were all pulled on with more quickness than Dab had ever seen the young African display before.  \"I's much obleeged to ye, Mr. Kinzer,\" said Dick very proudly, as he strutted across the road. \"On'y I dasn't go back fru de village.\"  \"What'll you do, then?\" asked Dab.  \"S'pose I'd better go a-fishin',\" said Dick. \"Will de fish bite?\"  \"Oh! the clothes won't make any odds to them,\" said Dabney. \"I must go back to the house.\"  And so he did: while Dick, on whom the cast-off garments of his white friend were really a pretty good fit, marched on down the road, feeling grander than he ever had before in all his life.  \"That'll be a good thing to tell Ham Morris, when he and Miranda get home again,\" muttered Dab, as he re-entered the house.  Late that evening, when Dabney returned from his final duties as escort to his mother's guests, she rewarded him with more than he could remember ever receiving of motherly commendation.  \"I've been really quite proud of you, Dabney,\" she said, as she laid her plump hand on the collar of his new coat, and kissed him. \"You've behaved like a perfect little gentleman.\"  \"Only, mother,\" exclaimed Keziah, \"he spent too much of his time with that sharp-tongued little Jenny Walters.\"  \"Never mind, Kezi,\" said Dab: \"she didn't know who I was till I told her. I'm going to wear a label with my name on it when I go over to the village to-morrow.\"  \"And then you'll put on your other suit in the morning,\" said Mrs. Kinzer. \"You must keep this for Sundays and great occasions.\"  \"Any more weddings coming, right away?\" said Dab, with a sharp glance around upon what remained of the family; but the girls were all very busy just then, with their books and their sewing, and he did not get any direct reply. Even his mother walked away after something she had left in the dining-room.  When the next morning came, Dabney Kinzer was a more than usually early riser, for he felt that he had waked up to a very important day.  \"Dabney,\" exclaimed his mother, when he came in to breakfast, \"did I not tell you to put on your other suit?\"  \"So I have, mother,\" replied Dab: this is my other suit.\"  \"That?\" exclaimed Mrs. Kinzer.  \"So it is!\" cried Keziah.  \"So it isn't,\" added Samantha. \"Mother, that is not what he had on yesterday.\"  \"He's been trading again,\" mildly suggested Pamela.  \"Dabney,\" said Mrs. Kinzer, \"what does this mean?\"  \"Mean!\" replied Dabney. \"Why, these are the clothes you told me to buy. The lot I wore yesterday were a present from Ham Morris. He's a splendid fellow. I'm glad he got the best of the girls.\"  That was a bad thing for Dabney to say just then, for it was vigorously resented by the remaining three. As soon as quiet was restored, however, Mrs. Kinzer remarked,--  \"I think Hamilton should have consulted me about it, but it's too late now. Anyhow, you may go and put on your other clothes.\"  \"My wedding suit?\" asked Dab.  \"No, indeed! I mean your old ones,--those you took off night before last.\"  \"Dunno where they are,\" slowly responded Dab.  \"Don't know where they are?\" responded a chorus of four voices.  \"No,\" said Dab. \"Bill Lee's black boy had em on all yesterday afternoon, and I reckon he's gone a-fishing again to-day. They fit him a good sight better 'n they ever did me.\"  If Dabney had expected a storm to come from his mother's end of the table, he was pleasantly mistaken; and his sisters had it all to themselves for a moment. Then, with an admiring glance at her son, the thoughtful matron remarked,--  \"Just like his father, for all the world! It's no use, girls: Dabney's a growing boy in more ways than one. Dabney, I shall want you to go over to the Morris house with me after breakfast. Then you may hitch up the ponies, and we'll do some errands around the village.\"  Dab Kinzer's sisters looked at one another in blank astonishment, and Samantha would have left the table if she had only finished her breakfast.  Pamela, as being nearest to Dab in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10340"],["title","Dab Kinzer: A Story of a Growing Boy (#2)"],["body"," and sympathy, gave a very admiring look at her brother's second \"good fit,\" and said nothing.  Even Keziah finally admitted, in her own mind, that such a change in Dabney's appearance might have its advantages. But Samantha inwardly declared war.  The young hero himself was hardly used to that second suit, as yet, and felt any thing but easy in it.  \"I wonder,\" he said to himself, \"what Jenny Walters would say to me now. Wonder if she'd know me.\"  Not a doubt of it. But after he had finished his breakfast, and gone out, his mother remarked,--  \"It's really all right, girls. I almost fear I have been neglecting Dabney. He isn't a little boy any more.\"  \"He isn't a man yet,\" exclaimed Samantha. \"And he talks slang dreadfully.\"  \"But then, he does grow so!\" remarked Keziah.  \"Mother,\" said Pamela, \"couldn't you get Dab to give Dick Lee the slang, along with the old clothes?\"  \"We'll see about it,\" replied Mrs. Kinzer.  It was very clear that Dabney's mother had begun to take in a new idea about her son.  It was not the least bit in the world unpleasant to find out that he was \"growing in more ways than one,\" and it was quite likely that she had indeed kept him too long in roundabouts.  At all events, his great idea had been worked out into a triumphant success; and, before the evening was over, Pamela replied to a remark of Samantha's,--  \"I don't care. He's taller than I am, and I'd ever so much rather have a frock-coat walk beside me to meeting.\"      CHAPTER III.  A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE OLDEST FAMILIES MEETS A YOUNG GENTLEMAN FROM THE CITY.   Dick Lee had been more than half right about the village being a dangerous place for him, with such an unusual amount of clothing over his ordinary uniform.  The very dogs, every one of whom was an old acquaintance, barked at him on his way home that night; and, proud as were his ebony father and mother of the improvement in their son's appearance, they yielded to his earnest entreaties, first, that he might wear his present all the next day, and, second, that he might betake himself to the \"bay\" early in the morning, and so keep out of sight \"till he got used to it.\"  \"On'y, you jist mind wot yer about!\" said his mother, \"and see't you keep dem clo'es from gettin' wet. I jist can't 'foard to hab dem spiled right away.\"  The fault with Dab Kinzer's old suit, after all, had lain mainly in its size rather than its materials; for Mrs. Kinzer was too good a manager to be really stingy.  Dick succeeded in reaching the boat-landing without falling in with any one who seemed disposed to laugh at him; but there, right on the wharf, was a white boy of about his own age, and he felt a good deal like backing out.  \"Nebber seen him afore, either,\" said Dick to himself. \"Den I guess I ain't afeard ob him.\"  The stranger was a somewhat short and thick-set, but bright and active-looking boy, with a pair of very keen, greenish-gray eyes. But, after all, the first word he spoke to poor Dick was,--  \"Hullo, clothes! Where are you going with all that boy?\"  \"I knowed it, I knowed it!\" groaned Dick. But he answered as sharply as he knew how,--  \"I's goin' a-fishin'. Any ob youah business?\"--  \"Where'd you learn how to fish?\" the stranger asked, \"Down South? Didn't know they had any there.\"  \"Nebbah was down Souf,\" was the somewhat surly reply.  \"Father run away, did he?\"  \"He nebber was down dar, nudder.\"  \"Nor his father?\"  \"'Tain't no business ob yourn,\" said Dick, \"but we's allers lived right heah, on dis bay.\"  \"Guess not,\" said the white boy knowingly. Dick was right, nevertheless; for his people had been slaves among the very earliest Dutch settlers, and had never \"lived South\" at all. He was now busily getting one of the boats ready to shove off; but his white tormentor went at him again, with,--  \"Well, then, if you've lived round here as long as that, you must know everybody.\"  \"Reckon I do.\"  \"Are there any nice fellows around here? Any like me?\"  \"De nicest young gen'lman round dis bay,\" replied Dick, \"is Mr. Dab Kinzer. But he ain't like you. Not nuff to hurt him.\"  \"Dab Kinzer,\" exclaimed the stranger. \"Where'd he get his name?\"  \"In de bay, I 'spect,\" said Dick, as he shoved his boat off; \"caught 'im wid a hook.\"  \"Anyhow,\" said the strange boy to himself, \"that's probably the kind of fellow my father would wish me to associate with. Only it's likely he's very ignorant.\"  And he walked away towards the village, with the air of a man who had forgotten more than the rest of his race were ever likely to find out.  At all events, Dick Lee had managed to say a good word for his benefactor, little as he could guess what might be the consequences.  Meantime Dab Kinzer, when he went out from breakfast, had strolled away to the north fence, for a good look at the house which was thenceforth to be the home of his favorite sister. He had seen it before, every day since he could remember; but it seemed to have a fresh and almost mournful interest for him just now.  \"Hullo!\" he exclaimed, as he leaned against the fence. \"Putting up ladders? Oh, yes, I see! That's old Tommy McGrew, the house-painter. Well, Ham's house needs a new coat as badly as I did. Sure it'll fit too. Only it ain't used to it, any more'n I am.\"  \"Dabney!\"  It was his mother's voice, and Dab felt like \"minding\" very promptly that morning.  \"Dabney, my boy, come here to the gate.\"  \"Ham Morris is having his house painted,\" he remarked, as he walked towards his mother.  \"Is he?\" she said. \"We'll go and see about it.\"  The gate between the two \"side-yards\" had been there from time immemorial, and-they walked right through. As they drew nearer the Morris house, however, Dabney discovered that carpenters as well as painters were plying their trade in and about the old homestead. There were window-sashes piled here, and blinds there; a new door or so, ready for use, a great stack of bundles of shingles, some barrels of lime, and a heap of sand. Whichever way Dab looked, there were visible signs of an approaching renovation.  \"Going to fix it all over,\" he remarked.  \"Yes,\" replied his mother: \"it'll be as good as new. It was well built, and will bear mending. I couldn't say that of some of the shackling things they've been putting up around the village.\"  When they entered the house it became more and more evident that the \"shabby\" days of the Morris mansion were numbered. There were men at work in almost every room.  Ham's wedding-trip would surely give plenty of time, at that rate, for an immense amount of \"mending;\" and his house would be, as the widow had promised, \"all ready for him on his return.\"  There was nothing wonderful to Dabney in the idea of his mother going about and inspecting work, and finding fault, and giving directions. He had never seen her do any thing else, and he had the greatest confidence in her knowledge and ability. He noticed too, before they left the place, that the customary farm-work was going ahead with even more regularity and energy than if the owner himself had been present.  \"Ham's farm'll look something like ours, one of these days,\" he said, \"if things go on at this rate.\"  \"I mean it shall,\" replied his mother, a little sharply. \"Now go and get out the ponies, and we'll do the rest of our errands.\"  Dab started for the barn at a half trot; for, if there was one thing he liked better than another, it was to have the reins in his hands and that pair of ponies before him. Time had been when Mrs. Kinzer did her own driving, and only permitted Dab to \"hold the horses\" while she made her calls, business or otherwise; but that day had been safely put away among Dab's unpleasant memories for a good while.  It was but a few minutes before the neat buggy held the widow and her son, and the ponies were taking them briskly down the road towards the village.  It they had only known it, at that very moment Ham Morris and his blooming bride were setting out for a drive, at the fashionable watering-place where they had made their first stop in their wedding-tour.  \"Ham,\" said Miranda, \"it seems to me as if we were a thousand miles from home.\"  \"We shall be a good deal farther before we get any nearer,\" said Ham.  \"But I wonder what they are doing there, this morning,--mother, and the girls, and dear little Dabney.\"  \"Little Dabney!\" exclaimed Ham, with a queer sort of laugh on his face. \"Why, Miranda, do you think Dab is a baby yet?\"  \"No, not a baby, but\"--  \"Well, he's a boy, that's a fact; but he'll be as tall as I am in three years.\"  \"Will he? Do you think so? But will he ever get fat?\"  \"Not till after he gets his full length,\" said Ham. \"We must have him at our house a good deal, after we get home, and feed him up. I've taken a liking to Dab.\"  \"Feed him up!\" said Miranda. \"Do you think we starve him?\"  \"No, I suppose not; but how many meals a day does he get?\"  \"Three, of course, like the rest of us; and he never misses one of them.\"  \"Exactly,\" said Ham: \"I shouldn't suppose he would. I never miss a meal, myself, if I can help it. But don't you think three meals a day is rather short allowance for a boy like Dab?\"  Miranda thought a moment, but then she answered positively,--  \"No, I don't. Not if he does as well at each one of them as Dabney is sure to.\"  \"Well,\" said Ham, \"that was in his old clothes, that were too tight for him. Now he's got a good loose fit, with plenty of room, you don't know how much more he may need. No, Miranda, I'm going to have an eye on Dab.\"  \"You're a dear good fellow, anyway,\" said Miranda, with one of her very best smiles, \"and I hope mother'll have the house all ready for us when we get back.\"  \"She will,\" replied Ham, after a moment spent in somewhat thoughtful silence. \"Do you know, Miranda, I shall hardly be easy about that till I see what she's done with it? It was in a dreadfully baggy condition.\"      CHAPTER IV.  TWO BOYS, ONE PIG, AND AN UNFORTUNATE RAILWAY-TRAIN.   \"That's him!\"  Dab was standing by his ponies, in front of a store in the village."]]]
