Do you like mysteries? Gee, that's one thing I'm crazy about--mysteries-- mysteries and pineapple sodas. Oh, Oh!  Then Sandy left us and went off to catch cash-on-delivery fish--that's COD fish. Oh, boy, but it was fine rocking away out there. Pretty soon I got supper because I'm cook. I know how to make flapjacks and hunters' stew, and a lot of things. After supper the fellows decided to go ashore to St. George and get some sodas and take in a movie show. I said I'd stay on the houseboat because I had to write up the troop-book. Maybe I forgot to tell you that I'm troop historian. Most of the things in this story are out of our troop book.  You'd better not skip the next chapter, because something is going to happen.    CHAPTER II  TELLS YOU HOW I HAD A VISITOR  We weren't anchored very far from shore, so it didn't take long for all the troop to row over, even though we only had one small boat. Mr. Ellsworth went with them so he could look after Skinny.  As soon as I had finished clearing up after supper, I got out the troop book and began writing it up. I was behind about two weeks with it and so I had about ten pages to do. Oh, but it was dandy sitting there on the deck with my feet up on the railing, writing. I mean I was writing with my hand. Pretty soon it began getting dark and I could see the lights coming out on all the different boats just like stars. It's kind of fun being alone sometimes. I could see all the lights in the town, too, but what did I care? I said I'd rather be alone where I was. Pretty soon it was too dark to write and so I just sat there thinking. Maybe you think it's no fun just thinking. But I was thinking how pretty soon we'd be hiking up from Catskill Landing to Black Lake, and how I'd see Jeb Rushmore, and how I'd take a hike and find out if the robin's nest was just where it was last year. That robin is a member of our patrol--he's an honorary member.  All of a sudden I saw it was pitch dark and I couldn't see any boats at all, only lights, moving a little on account of the boats rocking.  In a little while I heard oars splashing and the sound seemed to be coming nearer and nearer, so I knew it was the first boat-load of fellows coming back. I thought it was awful soon for them to be getting back. It seemed funny that they weren't talking, especially if it was the Raving Ravens (that's what we call the Raven Patrol) because Pee-wee Harris would be sure to be running on high. That's the way he always does, especially coming home from the movies. And if it was the Elk Patrol I'd be sure to hear Bert McAlpin because he's a human victrola record.  Pretty soon I could make out a black spot coming nearer and then I knew for sure it was headed for the house-boat. But there wasn't any sound except the splashing of the oars and I thought that was mighty funny. In a couple of minutes the boat came alongside and I heard someone say, \"_Pst_\" very quiet like. I went and looked over the rail and there I saw a fellow all alone in a rowboat. I couldn't see him very well, but I could see he had on an old hat and was pretty shabby.  Then he sort of whispered, \"Anybody up there, Skeezeks?\"  I told him no, and asked him who he was and what he wanted, but he didn't say anything, only tied his boat, and climbed up over the rail. Then I could see him better by the light shining through the cabin window, and his clothes were all ragged and greasy. He looked pretty tough, but one thing, anyway, he smiled an awful nice kind of a smile and hit me a whack on the shoulder and said: \"Don't get excited, Skeezeks; you're all right and I won't hurt you. How are you, anyway?\"  I told him I was very well, but I'd like for him please to tell me who he was, so I'd know.  Then he gave me another push, and I don't know, there was something about him that kind of made me like him, and I wasn't scared of him at all.  \"Don't you know who I am?\" he said.  \"I kind of think maybe you're the fellow that jumped out of this boat and ran away, when it was up the creek near Little Valley. You look kind of like him.\"  \"Right the first time,\" he said, \"and I bet you're a bully little scout. What do you say?\" Then he looked out over the water to be sure nobody was coming.  \"I'm a first class scout, and I've got nine merit badges, and I'm a patrol leader,\" I told him. \"Anyway I'd like to know what you want here.\"  \"_Patrol leader! No!_\" he said, and I could see he was only trying to get on the right side of me, and that he didn't know what a patrol leader is at all.  \"Can patrol leaders keep secrets?\" he said.  I told him if it was a good secret, they could. Then he hit me a good whack on the shoulder and he winked at me awful funny and said:      They are fools who go and tell       Wisely has the poet sung.     Man may hold all sorts of jobs       If he'll only hold his tongue.  \"Are you a tramp?\" I asked him.  \"_A tramp!_\" he said, \"that's pretty good. I dare say I look like one.\"  Then he jumped up on the railing and began laughing so hard I was afraid he'd fall backwards into the water. I told him he'd better look out, but he only laughed more, and said I was a great kid. Then all of a sudden he happened to think and he looked around to see if anyone was coming. Then he said,  \"Are you game to help me in a dark plot?\"  Gee, I didn't know what to tell him. \"It depends upon how dark it is,\" I said. Because, jiminy, I wanted to be careful and watch my step. But that only made him laugh a lot. Then he said,  \"Well, it isn't exactly a black plot, but it's a kind of a dark brown.\"  \"One thing sure,\" I said, \"you're not a tramp, I know that--I can tell.\"  \"You're a wise little gazabo,\" he said. \"Would you really like to know who I am?\"  I told him sure I would.  \"Do you think I look like a tramp?\" he asked me.  \"I think you kind of look like one,\" I said; \"but you don't act like one, and you don't laugh like one.\"  \"I've got blamed little reason to laugh,\" he said, \"because I'm in Dutch, and you've got to do me a good turn. Will you?\"  \"Good turns are our middle names,\" I told him, \"but anyway, I'd like to know who you are--that's sure.\"  Then he said, \"I'm Lieutenant Donnelle, Mr. Donnelle's son. And I guess I had a right to run away from the boat, didn't I?\"  \"G-o-o-d night!\" I said.    CHAPTER III  TELLS HOW I MADE A PROMISE  Then he said, \"Were you one of the kids who were coming along with my father when I jumped out of the boat?\" And I told him yes. Then he said, \"You don't think he saw me, do you?\" I said, \"Yes, he saw you, but I guess he didn't know who you were, he didn't see your face, that's sure.\"  \"Thank goodness for that,\" he said, \"because I've caused the old gent a lot of trouble.\"  \"Anyway,\" I told him, \"I don't see why you don't wear your uniform. Gee, if I had a lieutenant's uniform you bet I'd wear it.\"  \"Would you?\" he said, and he began to laugh. Then he said, \"Well, now, let's sit down here on this bench and I'll tell you what _you're_ going to do, and then I'll tell you what _I'm_ going to do, and we'll have to be quick about it.\" Then he looked out over the water and listened and as soon as he was sure nobody was coming, he put his arm over my shoulder and made me sit down on the bench beside him. I have to admit I kind of liked that fellow, even though I kind of thought he was, you know, wild, sort of. It seemed as if he was the kind of a fellow to have a lot of adventures and to be reckless and all that.  \"Maybe you can tell me what you're going to do,\" I told him, \"but you can't tell me what _I'm_ going to do--that's one sure thing.\"  \"Oh, yes I can,\" he said, \"because you're a bully kid and you're an A-1 sport, and you and I are going to be pals. What do you say?\"  \"I can't deny that I like you,\" I said, \"and I bet you've been to a lot of places.\"  \"France, Russia, South America, Panama and Montclair, New Jersey,\" he said, \"and Bronx Park.\" Gee, I didn't know how to take him, he was so funny.  \"Ever been up in an airplane?\" he said.  \"Cracky, I'd like to,\" I told him.  \"I went from Paris to the Channel in an airplane,\" he said.  Then he gave me a crack on the back and he put his arm around my shoulder awful nice and friendly like, and it made me kind of proud because I knew him.  \"Now, you listen here,\" he said, \"I'm in a dickens of a fix. You live in Bridgeboro; do you know Jake Holden?\"  \"Sure I know him, he's a fisherman,\" I said; \"the very same night your father told us we could use this boat I saw him, and the next day I went to try to find him for a certain reason, and he was gone away down the bay after fish. He taught me how to fry eels.\"  \"Get out,\" he said, \"really?\"  \"Honest, he did,\" I told him.  \"Well, some day I'll show you how to cook bear's meat. There's something you don't know.\"  \"Did you ever cook bear's meat?\" I asked him.  \"Surest thing you know,\" he said; \"black bears, gray bears, grisly bears--\"  \"Jiminy,\" I said.  Then he went on and this is what he told me, keeping his arm around my shoulder and every minute or so listening and looking out over the water. \"Here's something you didn't know,\" he said. Gee, I can remember every word almost, because you bet I listened. A fellow couldn't help listening to him. He said, \"When Jake Holden went down the bay, your Uncle Dudley was with him.\"  I said, \"You mean you?\"  \"I mean _me_,\" he said. \"I was home from Camp Dix on a short leave and was on my way to see the old gent and the rest of the folks, when who should I run plunk into but that old water rat. It was five o'clock in the morning, and I was just taking a hop, skip and a jump off the train. 'Come on down the bay fishing,' he says. 'What, in these togs?' I told him. 'I'll get 'em all greased up and what'll Uncle Sam say?' 'Go home and get some old ones,' he said. ''Gainst the rules,' I said, 'can't be running around in civilized clothes.' 'You should worry about civilized clothes,' he said. 'Go up to your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10316"],["title","Roy Blakeley's Adventures in Camp (#2)"],["body","d's old house-boat in the marshes and get some fishin' duds on--the locker's full of 'em.' 'Thou hast said something,' I told him; 'go and get your old scow ready and I'm with you.'\"  Then he hit me a good rap on the shoulder and said, \"So you see how it was, kiddo? Instead of going home to hear how handsome I looked, I just beat it up that creek and fished this suit of greasy rags out of one of the lockers. There was a key in the padlock and I just took off my uniform and stuffed it in the locker and beat it over to Little Landing in Bridgeboro.\"  \"You locked the padlock and took the key, didn't you?\" I said.  \"Righto,\" he said, \"and I thought I'd be back that same night and down to Dix again by morning. See? But instead of that, here I am and blamed near a week gone by and Uncle Sam on the hunt for me. A nice pickle I'm in. What do you say?\"  \"Gee, I wouldn't want to be you,\" I said; \"anyway, I'm sorry for you. But I don't see why you didn't go back like you said.\" Then he went over to the railing and looked all around in a hurry.  \"I guess they won't be back for an hour yet,\" I told him; \"they went to the movies.\"  So he came back and sat down beside me again and began talking very excited, as if I was kind of a friend of his, the way he talked. You know what I mean. And, cracky, any fellow would be glad to be a friend of his, that's sure, even if he _was_ kind of reckless and--you know.  He said, \"I had so many adventures, old top, that I couldn't tell 'em to you. Jakey and I have Robinson Crusoe tearing his hair from jealousy. Kiddo, this last week has been a whole sea story; in itself-- just one hair's-breadth escape after another. Ever read _Treasure Island?_\"  \"_Did I!_\" I said.  Then he said, \"Well _Treasure Island_ is like a church social compared to what I've been through. Some day I'm going to tell you about it.\"  I said, \"I wish you'd tell me now.\"  \"Some night around the camp-fire I'll tell you,\" he said. \"We were fishing off Sea Gate and the fish just stood on line waiting for a chance to bite. We sold three boatfuls in the one day and whacked up about seventy dollars--what do you think of that? Then we chugged around into Coney for gas and on the way back we got mussed up with the tide and were carried out to sea--banged around for three days, bailing and trying to fry fish on the muffler. On the fourth day we were picked up by a fishing schooner about fifty miles off Rockaway and towed in. I said to Jakey, I'm Mike Corby, remember that, and if you give your right name I'll kill you--you've got to protect me,' I said, 'because I'm in bad.' You see how it was, kiddo? I was three days overdue at camp and didn't even have my uniform. I was so tired bailing and standing lookout that when they set us down on the wharf at Rockaway, I could have slept standing on my head. And I've gone without sleep fifty hours at a stretch on the West Front in France--would you believe it?\"  \"Sure, I believe it,\" I told him.  \"I'll tell you the whole business some day when you and I are on the hike.\"  I said, \"Cracky, you can bet I'd like to go on a hike with you.\"  \"That's what we will,\" he said, \"and we'll swap adventures.\"  I told him I didn't have any good ones like he had to swap, but anyway, I was glad he got home all right.  \"_All right!_\" he said, \"you mean all _wrong_. Maybe you saw the accounts in the papers of the two fishermen who were picked up after a _harrowing experience_--Mike Corby and Dan McCann. That was us. I left Jakey down at Rockaway to wait for his engine to be fixed and beat it out to Jersey. _No house-boat_! Was I up in the air? Didn't even dare to go up to the house and ask about it. That rotten little newspaper in Bridgeboro had a big headliner about me disappearing--'_never seen after leaving Camp Dix; whereabouts a mystery_'--that's what it said, '_son of Professor Donnelle_.' What'd you think of that?\"  I told him I was mighty sorry for him, and I was, too.  Then he said how he went to New York in those old rags, and tried not to see anybody he knew and even he hid his face when he saw Mr. Cooper on the train. And then he telephoned out to Bridgeboro and Little Valley and made believe he was somebody else, and said he heard the houseboat was for sale and in that way he found out about his father loaning it to our troop, and how we were probably anchored near St. George at Staten Island. Oh, boy, didn't he hurry up to get there, because he was afraid we might be gone.  So then he waited till night and he was just wondering whether it would be safe to wait till we were all asleep and then sneak onto the boat, when all of a sudden he saw the fellows coming ashore and he got near and listened and he heard them speak about going to the movies, and he heard one fellow say something about how Roy would be sorry he didn't come. And do you want to know what he told me? This is just what he said; he said, \"When I heard your name was Roy, I knew you'd be all right--see? Because look at Rob Roy,\" he said; \"wasn't he a bully hero and a good scout and a fellow you could trust with a secret--wasn't he?\" That's just what he said. \"You take a fellow named Roy,\" he said, \"and you'll always find him true and loyal.\" He said there was a fellow named Roy on the West Front and he gave up his life before he'd tell on a comrade.  Then he said, \"You see how it is with me, Skeezeks, I'm in a peck of trouble and I've got to get those army duds on and toddle back to camp as soon as I can get there and face the music. I've got to make an excuse--I've got to get that blamed uniform pressed somehow--I suppose it's creased from the dampness in that locker. I've got to straighten matters out if I can. I just managed to save my life, and by heck, I'll be lucky if I can just save my honor and that's the plain truth.\"  \"So you see I've got a lot to do,\" he said, \"and you've got just the one thing to do, and that's a cinch. It's to keep your mouth shut--see? Suppose the old gent knew about this. Suppose my sister knew I was within a quarter of a mile of the house and didn't go to see them. You know what girls are.\"  I told him, \"Sure, because I've got two sisters. And I bet they'd like you, too. I bet they'd say you were good looking.\" Then he began to laugh and he said, \"Well, I bet I'd like them too, if they're anything like you. So now will you keep your mouth shut? Ever hear of the scouts' oath? The Indian scouts' oath, I mean--loyalty for better or worser? Don't say I was here. Don't say you know anything about me. Keep your mouth shut. If my name should be mentioned, keep still. You don't know anything. Nobody was here, see?\"  I said, \"Suppose Mr. Ellsworth or somebody should ask me?\"  \"Who's going to ask you?\" he said; \"you say nothing and they'll say nothing. I fought for my country, kiddo, and I've got two wounds. You don't want to spoil it all for me now, do you?\"  I said, \"I bet you're brave, anyhow.\"  \"I'd rather face two German divisions than what I've got to face to-morrow,\" he said; \"but if I know it's all right at this end, I won't worry. Are you straight?\"  \"I wouldn't tell,\" I told him; \"cracky, why should _I_ tell? And I can see you've got a lot of trouble and you're not exactly all to blame, anyway. Only I hope I'll see you again sometime because, anyway, whatever you did I kind of like you. It's one of our laws that a fellow has to be loyal. Only sometime will you tell me some of the things you did--I mean your adventures?\"  \"I'll tell you all about the jungles and the man-eating apes down in Central America,\" he said.  So then he went into the cabin in a big hurry and he took the key out of his pocket and he opened the locker and took out his uniform. It was all wrinkled and damp, but anyway, he looked fine in it, you can bet. After he got it all on and fixed right, he stuffed his old clothes into the place and locked it up again. I bet any girl would say he looked fine, that's one thing sure.  Just before he climbed over the railing he put his hand in his pocket and took out some change and he was in such a hurry that he dropped some of it and it went all over the deck. I started to pick it up for him, but he only said, \"Never mind, let it go, you can have all you find, and here's a quarter to get a couple of sodas.\"  I said, \"We don't take anything for a service, scouts don't.\"  \"Well, you can have a soda on me, can't you?\" he said, trying to make me take the quarter.  \"If you want me to be loyal to you, I have to be loyal if I make a promise, don't I?\" I said.  He said, \"What promise?\"  And I said, \"I can't take anything for a service.\"  Then he hit me a rap on the shoulder and laughed and he punched me in the chest, not hard, only kind of as if to show me that he liked me. Then he said, \"Bully for you, kiddo, you're one little trump.\" Then, all of a sudden he was gone.  Sometimes you can't tell just why you like a fellow, but, anyway, I liked him just the same.    CHAPTER IV  TELLS ABOUT THE PAPER I FOUND  One thing, I bet it was Pee-wee Harris that the lieutenant heard talking, while he was hiding on shore. Anyway, it was Pee-wee that I heard first when they were on their way back--that's sure. You know how plain you can hear voices on the water. And believe me, before those fellows were half way out I knew all about the bandit of Red Hallow. That was the fellow in the movies, I suppose, and he must have been some bandit, because he saved a school teacher from about twenty other bandits, and shot them all. I guess everybody was shooting pistols at everybody else, like they mostly do in the movies. Pee-wee was sticking up for the poor school teacher, and it made me laugh because he hasn't got much use for school teachers on account of they're always keeping him in for talking. Anyway, what fun is there in everybody shooting pistols at each other. Me for stalking, that's what _I_ say.  When Mr. Ellsworth came on board he said, \"Well, Roy, alone in your glory, eh?\" I didn't say anything and I"]]]
