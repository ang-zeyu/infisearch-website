These thoughts occupied but a few moments, and he at once started at the top of his speed for his long run across the country.  Had Cuthbert been running in a race of hare and hound, he would assuredly have borne away the prize from most boys of his age. At headlong pace he made across the country, every foot of which, as far as the edge of Langholm Chase, he knew by heart.  The distance to the woods was some twelve miles, and in an hour and a half from the moment of his starting Cuthbert was deep within its shades. Where he would be likely to find the outlaws he knew not; and, putting a whistle to his lips, he shrilly blew the signal, which would, he knew, be recognized by any of the band within hearing.  He thought that he heard an answer, but was not certain, and again dashed forward, almost as speedily as if he had but just started.  Five minutes later a man stood in the glade up which he was running. He recognized him at once as one of Cnut's party.  \"Where are the band?\" he gasped.  \"Half a mile or so to the right,\" replied the man.  Guided by the man, Cuthbert ran at full speed, till, panting and scarce able to speak, he arrived at the spot where Cnut's band were gathered.  In a few words he told them what had happened, and although they had just been chased by the father of the captured child, there was not a moment of hesitation in promising their aid to rescue her from a man whom they regarded as a far more bitter enemy, both of themselves and their race.  \"I fear we shall be too late to cut them off,\" Cnut said, \"they have so long a start; but at least we will waste no time in gossiping.\"  Winding a horn to call together some of the members of the band who had scattered, and leaving one at the meeting-place to give instructions to the rest, Cnut, followed by those assembled there, went off at a swinging trot through the glades towards Wortham Castle.  After a rapid calculation of distances, and allowing for the fact that the baron's men--knowing that Sir Walter's retainers and friends were all deep in the forest, and even if they heard of the outrage could not be on their traces for hours--would take matters quietly, Cnut concluded that they had arrived in time.  Turning off, they made their way along the edge of the wood to the point where the road from Evesham ran through the forest.  Scarcely had the party reached this point when they heard a faint clatter of steel.  \"Here they come!\" exclaimed Cuthbert.  Cnut gave rapid directions, and the band took up their posts behind the trees, on either side of the path.  \"Remember,\" Cnut said, \"above all things be careful not to hit the child, but pierce the horse on which she is riding. The instant he falls, rush forward. We must trust to surprise to give us the victory.\"  Three minutes later the head of a band of horsemen was seen through the trees. They were some thirty in number, and, closely grouped as they were together, the watchers behind the trees could not see the form of the child carried in their midst.  When they came abreast of the concealed outlaws, Cnut gave a sharp whistle, and fifty arrows flew from tree and bush into the closely gathered party of horsemen. More than half their number fell at once; some, drawing their swords, endeavoured to rush at their concealed foes, while others dashed forward in the hope of riding through the snare into which they had fallen. Cuthbert had levelled his crossbow, but had not fired; he was watching with intense anxiety for a glimpse of the bright-coloured dress of the child. Soon he saw a horseman separate himself from the rest and dash forward at full speed. Several arrows flew by him, and one or two struck the horse on which he rode.  The animal, however, kept on its way.  Cuthbert levelled his crossbow on the low arm of a tree, and as the rider came abreast of him touched the trigger, and the steel-pointed quarrel flew true and strong against the temple of the passing horseman. He fell from his horse like a stone and the well-trained animal at once stood still by the side of his rider.  Cuthbert leapt forward, and to his delight the child at once opened her arms and cried in a joyous tone,--  \"Cuthbert!\"  The fight was still raging fiercely, and Cuthbert, raising her from the ground, ran with her into the wood, where they remained hidden until the combat ceased, and the last survivors of the Baron's band had ridden past towards the castle.  Then Cuthbert went forward with his charge and joined the band of outlaws, who, absorbed in the fight, had not witnessed the incident of her rescue, and now received them with loud shouts of joy and triumph.  \"This is a good day's work indeed for all,\" Cuthbert said; \"it will make of the earl a firm friend instead of a bitter enemy; and I doubt not that better days are dawning for Evesham Forest.\"  A litter was speedily made with boughs, on this Margaret was placed, and on the shoulders of two stout foresters started for home, Cnut and Cuthbert walking beside, and a few of the band keeping at a short distance behind, as a sort of rear-guard should the Baron attempt to regain his prey.  There was now no cause for speed, and Cuthbert in truth could scarce drag one foot before another, for he had already traversed over twenty miles, the greater portion of the distance at his highest rate of speed.  Cnut offered to have a litter made for him also, but this Cuthbert indignantly refused; however, in the forest they came upon the hut of a small cultivator, who had a rough forest pony, which was borrowed for Cuthbert's use.  It was late in the afternoon before they came in sight of Evesham Castle. From the distance could be seen bodies of armed men galloping towards it, and it was clear that only now the party were returning from the wood, and had learned the news of the disappearance of the Earl's daughter, and of the finding of the bodies of her attendants.  Presently they met one of the mounted retainers riding at headlong speed.  \"Have you heard or seen anything,\" he shouted, as he approached, \"of the Lady Margaret? She is missing, and foul play has taken place.\"  \"Here I am, Rudolph,\" cried the child, sitting up on the rude litter.  The horseman gave a cry of astonishment and pleasure, and without a word wheeled his horse and galloped past back at headlong speed towards the castle.  As Cuthbert and the party approached the gate, the earl himself, surrounded by his knights and followers, rode out hastily from the gate and halted in front of the little party. The litter was lowered, and as he dismounted from his horse his daughter sprang out and leapt into his arms.  For a few minutes the confusion and babble of tongues were too great for anything to be heard, but Cuthbert, as soon as order was somewhat restored, stated what had happened, and the earl was moved to fury at the news of the outrage which had been perpetrated by the Baron of Wortham upon his daughter and at the very gates of his castle, and also at the thought that she should have been saved by the bravery and devotion of the very men against whom he had so lately been vowing vengeance in the depths of the forest.  \"This is not a time,\" he said to Cnut, \"for talking or making promises, but be assured that henceforth the deer of Evesham Chase are as free to you and your men as to me. Forest laws or no forest laws, I will no more lift a hand against men to whom I owe so much. Come when you will to the castle, my friends, and let us talk over what can be done to erase your outlawry and restore you to an honest career again.\"  Cuthbert returned home tired, but delighted with his day's work, and Dame Editha was surprised indeed with the tale of adventure he had to tell. The next morning he went over to the castle, and heard that a grand council had been held the evening before, and that it had been determined to attack Wortham Castle and to raze it to the ground.  Immediately on hearing of his arrival, the earl, after again expressing his gratitude for the rescue of his daughter, asked him if he would go into the forest and invite the outlaws to join their forces with those of the castle to attack the baron.  Cuthbert willingly undertook the mission, as he felt that this alliance would further strengthen the position of the forest men.  When he arrived there was some considerable consultation and discussion between the outlaws as to the expediency of mixing themselves in the quarrels between the Norman barons. However, Cnut persuaded them that as the Baron of Wortham was an enemy and oppressor of all Saxons, it was in fact their own quarrel that they were fighting rather than that of the earl, and they therefore agreed to give their aid, and promised to be at the rendezvous outside the castle to be attacked, soon after dawn next morning. Cuthbert returned with the news, which gave great satisfaction to the earl.  The castle was now a scene of bustle and business; armourers were at work repairing head-pieces and breastplates, sharpening swords and battle-axes, while the fletchers prepared sheaves of arrows. In the courtyard a number of men were engaged oiling the catapults, ballistas, and other machines for hurling stones. All were discussing the chances of the assault, for it was no easy matter which they had set themselves to do. Wortham Hold was an extremely strong one, and it needed all and more than all the machines at their disposal to undertake so formidable an operation as a siege.  The garrison, too, were strong and desperate; and the baron, knowing what must follow his outrage of the day before, would have been sure to send off messengers round the country begging his friends to come to his assistance. Cuthbert had begged permission of his mother to ask the earl to allow him to join as a volunteer, but she would not hear of it. Neither would she suffer him to mingle with the foresters.

And we sewed him in his hammock,     And we slipped him o'er the side,     And we sunk him in the Low Lands, Low!     The Low Lands!  The Low Lands!     And we sunk him in the Low Lands, Low!  Old Boozer Smith--a dirty gin-sodden bundle of rags on the floor in the corner with its head on a candle box, and covered by a horse rug--old Boozer Smith is supposed to have been dead to the universe for hours past, but the chorus must have disturbed his torpor; for, with a suddenness and unexpectedness that makes the next man jump, there comes a bellow from under the horse rug:      Wot though!--I wear!--a rag!--ged coat!     I'll wear it like a man!  and ceases as suddenly as it commenced. He struggles to bring his ruined head and bloated face above the surface, glares round; then, no one questioning his manhood, he sinks back and dies to creation; and subsequent proceedings are only interrupted by a snore, as far as he is concerned.  Little Jimmy Nowlett, the bullock-driver, is inspired. “Go on, Jimmy! Give us a song!”      In the days when we were hard up      For want of wood and wire-- Jimmy always blunders; it should have been “food and fire”--      We used to tie our boots up      With lit--tle bits--er wire;  and--      I'm sitting in my lit--tle room,      It measures six by six;     The work-house wall is opposite,      I've counted all the bricks!  “Give us a chorus, Jimmy!”  Jimmy does, giving his head a short, jerky nod for nearly every word, and describing a circle round his crown--as if he were stirring a pint of hot tea--with his forefinger, at the end of every line:      Hall!--Round!--Me--Hat!     I wore a weepin' willer!  Jimmy is a Cockney.  “Now then, boys!”      Hall--round--me hat!  How many old diggers remember it?  And:      A butcher, and a baker, and a quiet-looking quaker,     All a-courting pretty Jessie at the Railway Bar.  I used to wonder as a child what the “railway bar” meant.  And:      I would, I would, I would in vain     That I were single once again!     But ah, alas, that will not be     Till apples grow on the willow tree.  A drunken gambler's young wife used to sing that song--to herself.  A stir at the kitchen door, and a cry of “Pinter,” and old Poynton, Ballarat digger, appears and is shoved in; he has several drinks aboard, and they proceed to “git Pinter on the singin' lay,” and at last talk him round. He has a good voice, but no “theory”, and blunders worse than Jimmy Nowlett with the words. He starts with a howl--      Hoh!     Way down in Covent Gar-ar-r-dings      A-strolling I did go,     To see the sweetest flow-ow-wers      That e'er in gardings grow.  He saw the rose and lily--the red and white and blue--and he saw the sweetest flow-ow-ers that e'er in gardings grew; for he saw two lovely maidens (Pinter calls 'em “virgings”) underneath (he must have meant on top of) “a garding chair”, sings Pinter.      And one was lovely Jessie,     With the jet black eyes and hair,  roars Pinter,      And the other was a vir-ir-ging,     I solemn-lye declare!  “Maiden, Pinter!” interjects Mr. Nowlett.  “Well, it's all the same,” retorts Pinter. “A maiden IS a virging, Jimmy. If you're singing, Jimmy, and not me, I'll leave off!” Chorus of “Order! Shut up, Jimmy!”      I quicklye step-ped up to her,      And unto her did sa-a-y:     Do you belong to any young man,      Hoh, tell me that, I pra-a-y?  Her answer, according to Pinter, was surprisingly prompt and unconventional; also full and concise:      No; I belong to no young man--       I solemnlye declare!     I mean to live a virging      And still my laurels wear!  Jimmy Nowlett attempts to move an amendment in favour of “maiden”, but is promptly suppressed. It seems that Pinter's suit has a happy termination, for he is supposed to sing in the character of a “Sailor Bold”, and as he turns to pursue his stroll in “Covent Gar-ar-dings”:      “Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Oh, no!” she cried,     “I love a Sailor Bold!”  “Hong-kore, Pinter! Give us the 'Golden Glove', Pinter!”  Thus warmed up, Pinter starts with an explanatory “spoken” to the effect that the song he is about to sing illustrates some of the little ways of woman, and how, no matter what you say or do, she is bound to have her own way in the end; also how, in one instance, she set about getting it.  Hoh!      Now, it's of a young squoire near Timworth did dwell,     Who courted a nobleman's daughter so well--  The song has little or nothing to do with the “squire”, except so far as “all friends and relations had given consent,” and--      The troo-soo was ordered--appointed the day,     And a farmer were appointed for to give her away--  which last seemed a most unusual proceeding, considering the wedding was a toney affair; but perhaps there were personal interests--the nobleman might have been hard up, and the farmer backing him. But there was an extraordinary scene in the church, and things got mixed.      For as soon as this maiding this farmer espied:     “Hoh, my heart!  Hoh, my heart!     Hoh, my heart!” then she cried.  Hysterics? Anyway, instead of being wed--     This maiden took sick and she went to her bed.  (N.B.--Pinter sticks to 'virging'.)  Whereupon friends and relations and guests left the house in a body (a strange but perhaps a wise proceeding, after all--maybe they smelt a rat) and left her to recover alone, which she did promptly. And then:      Shirt, breeches, and waistcoat this maiding put on,     And a-hunting she went with her dog and her gun;     She hunted all round where this farmier did dwell,     Because in her own heart she love-ed him well.  The cat's out of the bag now:      And often she fired, but no game she killed--  which was not surprising--      Till at last the young farmier came into the field--  No wonder. She put it to him straight:      “Oh, why are you not at the wedding?” she cried,     “For to wait on the squoire, and to give him his bride.”  He was as prompt and as delightfully unconventional in his reply as the young lady in Covent Gardings:      “Oh, no! and oh, no!  For the truth I must sa-a-y,     I love her too well for to give her a-w-a-a-y!”  which was satisfactory to the disguised “virging”.      “.... and I'd take sword in hand,     And by honour I'd win her if she would command.”  Which was still more satisfactory.      Now this virging, being-- (Jimmy Nowlett: “Maiden, Pinter--” Jim is thrown on a stool and sat on by several diggers.)      Now this maiding, being please-ed to see him so bold,     She gave him her glove that was flowered with gold,  and explained that she found it in his field while hunting around with her dog and her gun. It is understood that he promised to look up the owner. Then she went home and put an advertisement in the local 'Herald'; and that ad. must have caused considerable sensation. She stated that she had lost her golden glove, and      The young man that finds it and brings it to me,     Hoh! that very young man my husband shall be!  She had a saving clause in case the young farmer mislaid the glove before he saw the ad., and an OLD bloke got holt of it and fetched it along. But everything went all right. The young farmer turned up with the glove. He was a very respectable young farmer, and expressed his gratitude to her for having “honour-ed him with her love.” They were married, and the song ends with a picture of the young farmeress milking the cow, and the young farmer going whistling to plough. The fact that they lived and grafted on the selection proves that I hit the right nail on the head when I guessed, in the first place, that the old nobleman was “stony”.  In after years,     ... she told him of the fun,     How she hunted him up with her dog and her gun.  But whether he was pleased or otherwise to hear it, after years of matrimonial experiences, the old song doesn't say, for it ends there.  Flash Jack is more successful with “Saint Patrick's Day”.      I come to the river, I jumped it quite clever!     Me wife tumbled in, and I lost her for ever,     St. Patrick's own day in the mornin'!  This is greatly appreciated by Jimmy Nowlett, who is suspected, especially by his wife, of being more cheerful when on the roads than when at home.      .   .   .   .   .  “Sam Holt” was a great favourite with Jimmy Nowlett in after years.      Oh, do you remember Black Alice, Sam Holt?      Black Alice so dirty and dark--     Who'd a nose on her face--I forget how it goes--      And teeth like a Moreton Bay shark.  Sam Holt must have been very hard up for tucker as well as beauty then, for      Do you remember the 'possums and grubs     She baked for you down by the creek?  Sam Holt was, apparently, a hardened flash Jack.      You were not quite the cleanly potato, Sam Holt.  Reference is made to his “manner of holding a flush”, and he is asked to remember several things which he, no doubt, would rather forget, including     ... the hiding you got from the boys.  The song is decidedly personal.  But Sam Holt makes a pile and goes home, leaving many a better and worse man to pad the hoof Out Back. And--Jim Nowlett sang this with so much feeling as to make it appear a personal affair between him and the absent Holt--      And, don't you remember the fiver, Sam Holt,     You borrowed so careless and free?     I reckon I'll whistle a good many tunes  (with increasing feeling)      Ere you think of that fiver and me.  For the chances will be that Sam Holt's old mate      Will be humping his drum on the Hughenden Road     To the end of the chapter of fate.      .   .   .   .   .
