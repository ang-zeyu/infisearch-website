All my family gathers here in the spring to sing, so of course I come too.\"  Old Mr. Toad filled out his queer music bag under his chin and began to sing again. Peter watched him. Now it just happened that Old Mr. Toad was facing him, and so Peter looked down straight into his eyes. He never had looked into Mr. Toad's eyes before, and now he just stared and stared, for it came over him that those eyes were very beautiful, very beautiful indeed.  \"Oh!\" he exclaimed, \"what beautiful eyes you have, Mr. Toad!\"  \"So I've been told before,\" replied Old Mr. Toad. \"My family always has had beautiful eyes. There is an old saying that every Toad has jewels in his head, but of course he hasn't, not real jewels. It is just the beautiful eyes. Excuse me, Peter, but I'm needed in that chorus.\" Old Mr. Toad once more swelled out his throat and began to sing.  Peter watched him a while longer, then hopped away to the dear Old Briarpatch, and he was very thoughtful.  \"Never again will I call anybody homely and ugly until I know all about him,\" said Peter, which was a very wise decision. Don't you think so?     VII   A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE SMILING POOL    Here's what Mr. Toad says;     Heed it well, my dear:   \"Time to watch for clouds is    When the sky is clear.\"  He says that that is the reason that he lives to a good old age, does Old Mr. Toad. I suppose he means that when the sky is cloudy, everybody is looking for rain and is prepared for it, but when the sun is shining, most people forget that there is such a thing as a storm, so when it comes suddenly very few are prepared for it. It is the same way with danger and trouble. So Old Mr. Toad very wisely watches out when there seems to be the least need of it, and he finds it always pays.  It was a beautiful spring evening. Over back of the Purple Hills to which Old Mother West Wind had taken her children, the Merry Little Breezes, and behind which jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had gone to bed, there was still a faint, clear light. But over the Green Meadows and the Smiling Pool the shadows had drawn a curtain of soft dusk which in the Green Forest became black. The little stars looked down from the sky and twinkled just to see their reflections twinkle back at them from the Smiling Pool. And there and all around it was perfect peace. Jerry Muskrat swam back and forth, making little silver lines on the surface of the Smiling Pool and squeaking contentedly, for it was the hour which he loves best. Little Friend the Song Sparrow had tucked his head under his wing and gone to sleep among the alders along the Laughing Brook and Redwing the Blackbird had done the same thing among the bulrushes. All the feathered songsters who had made joyous the bright day had gone to bed.  But this did not mean that the glad spring chorus was silent. Oh, my, no! No indeed! The Green Meadows were silent, and the Green Forest was silent, but as if to make up for this, the sweet singers of the Smiling Pool, the hylas and the frogs and Old Mr. Toad, were pouring out their gladness as if they had not been singing most of the departed day. You see it was the hour they love best of all, the hour which seems to them just made for singing, and they were doing their best to tell Old Mother Nature how they love her, and how glad they were that she had brought back sweet Mistress Spring to waken them from their long sleep.  It was so peaceful and beautiful there that it didn't seem possible that danger of any kind could be lurking near. But Old Mr. Toad, swelling out that queer music bag in his throat and singing with all his might, never once forgot that wise saying of his, and so he was the first to see what looked like nothing so much as a little detached bit of the blackness of the Green Forest floating out towards the Smiling Pool. Instantly he stopped singing. Now that was a signal. When he stopped singing, his nearest neighbor stopped singing, then the next one and the next, and in a minute there wasn't a sound from the Smiling Pool save the squeak of Jerry Muskrat hidden among the bulrushes. That great chorus stopped as abruptly as the electric lights go out when you press a button.  Back and forth over the Smiling Pool, this way and that way, floated the shadow, but there was no sign of any living thing in the Smiling Pool. After awhile the shadow floated away over the Green Meadows without a sound.  \"Hooty the Owl didn't get one of us that time,\" said Old Mr. Toad to his nearest neighbor with a chuckle of satisfaction. Then he swelled out his music bag and began to sing again. And at once, as abruptly as it had stopped, the great chorus began again as joyous as before, for nothing had happened to bring sadness as might have but for the watchfulness of Old Mr. Toad.     VIII   OLD MR. TOAD'S BABIES    The Smiling Pool's a nursery     Where all the sunny day   A thousand funny babies     Are taught while at their play.  Really the Smiling Pool is a sort of kindergarten, one of the most interesting kindergartens in the world. Little Joe Otter's children learn to swim there. So do Jerry Muskrat's babies and those of Billy Mink, the Trout and Minnow babies, and a lot more. And there you will find the children and grandchildren of Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad.  Peter Rabbit had known for a long time about the Frog babies, but though he knew that Old Mr. Toad was own cousin to Grandfather Frog, he hadn't known anything about Toad babies, except that at a certain time in the year he was forever running across tiny Toads, especially on rainy days, and each little Toad was just like Old Mr. Toad, except for his size. Peter had heard it said that Toads rain down from the sky, and sometimes it seems as if this must be so. Of course he knew it couldn't be, but it puzzled him a great deal. There wouldn't be a Toad in sight. Then it would begin to rain, and right away there would be so many tiny Toads that it was hard work to jump without stepping on some.  He remembered this as he went to pay his daily call on Old Mr. Toad in the Smiling Pool and listen to his sweet song. He hadn't seen any little Toads this year, but he remembered his experiences with them in other years, and he meant to ask about them.  Old Mr. Toad was sitting in his usual place, but he wasn't singing. He was staring at something in the water. When Peter said \"Good morning,\" Old Mr. Toad didn't seem to hear him. He was too much interested in what he was watching. Peter stared down into the water to see what was interesting Old Mr. Toad so much, but he saw nothing but a lot of wriggling tadpoles.  \"What are you staring at so, Mr. Sobersides?\" asked Peter, speaking a little louder than before.  Old Mr. Toad turned and looked at Peter, and there was a look of great pride in his face. \"I'm just watching my babies. Aren't they lovely?\" said he.  Peter stared harder than ever, but he couldn't see anything that looked like a baby Toad.  \"Where are they?\" asked he. \"I don't see any babies but those of Grandfather Frog, and if you ask me, I always did think tadpoles about the homeliest things in th' world.\"  Old Mr. Toad grew indignant. \"Those are not Grandfather Frog's children; they're mine!\" he sputtered. \"And I'll have you know that they are the most beautiful babies in th' world!\"  Peter drew a hand across his mouth to hide a smile. \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Toad,\" said he. \"I--I thought all tadpoles were Frog babies. They all look alike to me.\"  \"Well, they're not,\" declared Old Mr. Toad. \"How any one can mistake my babies for their cousins I cannot understand. Now mine are beautiful, while--\"  \"Chug-arum!\" interrupted the great deep voice of Grandfather Frog. \"What are you talking about? Why, your babies are no more to be compared with my babies for real beauty than nothing at all! I'll leave it to Peter if they are.\"  But Peter wisely held his tongue. To tell the truth, he couldn't see beauty in any of them. To him they were all just wriggling pollywogs. They were more interesting now, because he had found out that some of them were Toads and some were Frogs, and he hadn't known before that baby Toads begin life as tadpoles, but he had no intention of being drawn into the dispute now waxing furious between Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad.     IX   THE SMILING POOL KINDERGARTEN    Play a little, learn a little, grow a little too;   That's what every pollywoggy tries his best to do.  Of course. That's what a kindergarten is for. And you may be sure that the babies of Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad and Stickytoes the Tree Toad did all of these things in the kindergarten of the Smiling Pool. They looked considerably alike, did these little cousins, for they were all pollywogs to begin with. Peter Rabbit came over every day to watch them. Always he had thought pollywogs just homely, wriggling things, not the least bit interesting, but since he had discovered how proud of them were Grandfather Frog and Old Mr. Toad, he had begun to wonder about them and then to watch them.  \"There's one thing about them, and that is they are not in danger the way any babies are,\" said Peter, talking to himself as is his way when there is no one else to talk to. Just then a funny little black pollywog wriggled into sight, and while Peter was watching him, a stout-jawed water-beetle suddenly rushed from among the water grass, seized the pollywog by his tail, and dragged him down. Peter stared. Could it be that that ugly-looking bug was as dangerous an enemy to the baby Toad as Reddy Fox is to a baby Rabbit? He began to suspect so, and a little later he knew so, for there was that same little pollywog trying hard to swim and making bad work of it, because he had lost half of his long tail.  That set Peter to watching sharper than ever, and presently he discovered that pollywogs have to keep their eyes open quite as much as do baby Rabbits, if they would live to grow up. There were several kinds of queer, ugly-looking bugs forever darting out at the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12633"],["title","A Happy Boy (#1)"],["body"," thick and nice;       Four small bits of fish       Stole I from a dish;       Well-filled am I and sleek,       Am very languid and meek,'       Says the pussie.\"[1]  [Footnote 1: Auber Forestier's translation.]  Then the cock came strutting up with all the hens.  \"What does the cock say?\" asked Oyvind, clapping his hands.  The mother sang,--       \"Mother-hen her wings now are sinking,       Chanticleer on one leg stands thinking:      'High, indeed,       You gray goose can speed;       Never, surely though, she       Clever as a cock can be.       Seek your shelter, hens, I pray,       Gone is the sun to his rest for to-day,'--       Says the rooster.\"[1]  [Footnote 1: Auber Forestier's translation.]  Two small birds sat singing on the gable.  \"What are the birds saying?\" asked Oyvind, and laughed.      \"'Dear Lord, how pleasant is life,       For those who have neither toil nor strife,'--       Say the birds.\"[2]  --was the answer.  [Footnote 2: Translated by H.R.G.]  Thus he learned what all were saying, even to the ant crawling in the moss and the worm working in the bark.  The same summer his mother undertook to teach him to read.  He had had books for a long time, and wondered how it would be when they, too, should begin to talk.  Now the letters were transformed into beasts and birds and all living creatures; and soon they began to move about together, two and two; _a_ stood resting beneath a tree called _b_, _c_ came and joined it; but when three or four were grouped together they seemed to get angry with one another, and nothing would then go right. The farther he advanced the more completely he found himself forgetting what the letters were; he longest remembered _a_, which he liked best; it was a little black lamb and was on friendly terms with all the rest; but soon _a_, too, was forgotten, the books no longer contained stories, only lessons.  Then one day his mother came in and said to him,--  \"To-morrow school begins again, and you are going with me up to the gard.\"  Oyvind had heard that school was a place where many boys played together, and he had nothing against that.  He was greatly pleased; he had often been to the gard, but not when there was school there, and he walked faster than his mother up the hill-side, so eager was he.  When they came to the house of the old people, who lived on their annuity, a loud buzzing, like that from the mill at home, met them, and he asked his mother what it was.  \"It is the children reading,\" answered she, and he was delighted, for thus it was that he had read before he learned the letters.  On entering he saw so many children round a table that there could not be more at church; others sat on their dinner-pails along the wall, some stood in little knots about an arithmetic table; the school-master, an old, gray-haired man, sat on a stool by the hearth, filling his pipe.  They all looked up when Oyvind and his mother came in, and the clatter ceased as if the mill-stream had been turned off. Every eye was fixed on the new-comers; the mother saluted the school-master, who returned her greeting.  \"I have come here to bring a little boy who wants to learn to read,\" said the mother.  \"What is the fellow's name?\" inquired the school-master, fumbling down in his leathern pouch after tobacco.  \"Oyvind,\" replied the mother, \"he knows his letters and he can spell.\"  \"You do not say so!\" exclaimed the school-master.  \"Come here, you white-head!\"  \"Oyvind walked up to him, the school-master took him up on his knee and removed his cap.  \"What a nice little boy!\" said he, stroking the child's hair.  Oyvind looked up into his eyes and laughed.  \"Are you laughing at me!\"  The old man knit his brow, as he spoke.  \"Yes, I am,\" replied Oyvind, with a merry peal of laughter.  Then the school-master laughed, too; the mother laughed; the children knew now that they had permission to laugh, and so they all laughed together.  With this Oyvind was initiated into school.  When he was to take his seat, all the scholars wished to make room for him; he on his part looked about for a long time; while the other children whispered and pointed, he turned in every direction, his cap in his hand, his book under his arm.  \"Well, what now?\" asked the school-master, who was again busied with his pipe.  Just as the boy was about turning toward the school-master, he espied, near the hearthstone close beside him, sitting on a little red-painted box, Marit with the many names; she had hidden her face behind both hands and sat peeping out at him.  \"I will sit here!\" cried Oyvind, promptly, and seizing a lunch-box he seated himself at her side.  Now she raised the arm nearest him a little and peered at him from under her elbow; forthwith he, too, covered his face with both hands and looked at her from under his elbow.  Thus they sat cutting up capers until she laughed, and then he laughed also; the other little folks noticed this, and they joined in the laughter; suddenly a voice which was frightfully strong, but which grew milder as it spoke, interposed with,--  \"Silence, troll-children, wretches, chatter-boxes!--hush, and be good to me, sugar-pigs!\"  It was the school-master, who had a habit of flaring up, but becoming good-natured again before he was through.  Immediately there was quiet in the school, until the pepper grinders again began to go; they read aloud, each from his book; the most delicate trebles piped up, the rougher voices drumming louder and louder in order to gain the ascendency, and here and there one chimed in, louder than the others. In all his life Oyvind had never had such fun.  \"Is it always so here?\" he whispered to Marit.  \"Yes, always,\" said she.  Later they had to go forward to the school-master and read; a little boy was afterwards appointed to teach them to read, and then they were allowed to go and sit quietly down again.  \"I have a goat now myself,\" said Marit.  \"Have you?\"  \"Yes, but it is not as pretty as yours.\"  \"Why do you never come up to the cliff again?\"  \"Grandfather is afraid I might fall over.\"  \"Why, it is not so very high.\"  \"Grandfather will not let me, nevertheless.\"  \"Mother knows a great many songs,\" said Oyvind.  \"Grandfather does, too, I can tell you.\"  \"Yes, but he does not know mother's songs.\"  \"Grandfather knows one about a dance.  Do you want to hear it?\"  \"Yes, very much.\"  \"Well, then, come nearer this way, that the school-master may not see us.\"  He moved close to her, and then she recited a little snatch of a song, four or five times, until the boy learned it, and it was the first thing he learned at school.       \"Dance!\" cried the fiddle;       Its strings all were quaking,       The lensmand's son making       Spring up and say \"Ho!\"      \"Stay!\" called out Ola,       And tripped him up lightly;       The girls laughed out brightly,       The lensmand lay low.       \"Hop!\" said then Erik,       His heel upward flinging;       The beams fell to ringing,       The walls gave a shriek.      \"Stop!\" shouted Elling,       His collar then grasping,       And held him up, gasping:      \"Why, you're far too weak!\"       \"Hey!\" spoke up Rasmus,       Fair Randi then seizing;      \"Come, give without teasing       That kiss.  Oh! you know!\"      \"Nay!\" answered Randi,       And boxing him smartly,       Dashed off, crying tartly:      \"Take that now and go!\"[1]  [Footnote 1: Auber Forestier's translation.]  \"Up, youngsters!\" cried the school-master; \"this is the first day, so you shall be let off early; but first we must say a prayer and sing.\"  The whole school was now alive; the little folks jumped down from the benches, ran across the floor and all spoke at once.  \"Silence, little gypsies, young rascals, yearlings!--be still and walk nicely across the floor, little children!\" said the school-master, and they quietly took their places, after which the school-master stood in front of them and made a short prayer.  Then they sang; the school-master started the tune, in a deep bass; all the children, folding their hands, joined in.  Oyvind stood at the foot, near the door, with Marit, looking on; they also clasped their hands, but they could not sing.  This was the first day at school.     CHAPTER III.   Oyvind grew and became a clever boy; he was among the first scholars at school, and at home he was faithful in all his tasks.  This was because at home he loved his mother and at school the school-master; he saw but little of his father, who was always either off fishing or was attending to the mill, where half the parish had their grinding done.  What had the most influence on his mind in these days was the school-master's history, which his mother related to him one evening as they sat by the hearth.  It sank into his books, it thrust itself beneath every word the school-master spoke, it lurked in the school-room when all was still.  It caused him to be obedient and reverent, and to have an easier apprehension as it were of everything that was taught him.  The history ran thus:--  The school-master's name was Baard, and he once had a brother whose name was Anders.  They thought a great deal of each other; they both enlisted; they lived together in the town, and took part in the war, both being made corporals, and serving in the same company.  On their return home after the war, every one thought they were two splendid fellows.  Now their father died; he had a good deal of personal property, which was not easy to divide, but the brothers decided, in order that this should be no cause of disagreement between them, to put the things up at auction, so that each might buy what he wanted, and the proceeds could be divided between them.  No sooner said than done. Their father had owned a large gold watch, which had a wide-spread fame, because it was the only gold watch people in that part of the country had seen, and when it was put up many a rich man tried to get it until the two brothers began to take part in the bidding; then the rest ceased.
