So you see you are up against it\"  Hal and Chester looked at each other, and both smiled faintly.  \"I see we are,\" said Chester.  \"Now, I'll tell you what I can do,\" continued the ambassador. \"I can let you have enough money to keep you until such a time as you will be allowed to leave the country; or, better still, you can come and live with me. What do you say?\"  \"I'm sure we appreciate your kindness very much,\" said Hal, \"and we may be forced to take advantage of it. We shall look about the city this afternoon, and, if nothing else turns up, we shall be glad to stay with you.\"  \"Let me hear from you before night, anyhow,\" said the ambassador, rising.  \"We certainly shall. Come, Chester, let's go out and look around a bit.\"  The boys left the embassy.  The streets of the city were even more densely thronged than they had been the night before. Thousands and thousands of people paraded up and down--war the sole topic of their conversation.  Late in the afternoon, as Hal and Chester were walking along Strassburga Strasse, a hand was suddenly laid on the former's arm, and a voice exclaimed:  \"I thought you boys were on your way to Brussels. How does it happen you are still in Berlin?\"  Turning, Hal perceived that the person who had accosted him was none other than Lieutenant Anderson, and with him was Captain Derevaux.  All four expressed their pleasure at this unexpected meeting, and the boys explained their misfortune.  \"How is it you and Captain Derevaux didn't get away?\" Chester finally asked.  Captain Derevaux smiled.  \"We were so unfortunate as to be recognized by a member of the German general staff at the station this morning,\" he explained, \"and we were detained. But,\" he added grimly, \"we are not figuring upon remaining in Berlin overnight.\"  \"What do you propose to do?\" asked Hal and Chester in a breath.  \"Oh, Anderson and I have a little plan whereby we shall make ourselves scarce on this side of the border,\" answered the captain. \"We are planning to get out of Berlin soon after nightfall.\"  \"How?\" asked Hal.  \"Well,\" said Lieutenant Anderson, \"we haven't perfected our plans yet, but we have an idea that we believe will take us safely out of Germany. It may be successful, and it may not. But we are going to take a chance at it.\"  \"Is it dangerous?\" questioned Chester.  \"That all depends upon how you look at it,\" replied the lieutenant, with a smile. \"It may mean a fight,\" he added seriously, \"but we are prepared for that,\" tapping the pocket of his civilian coat significantly.  \"Yes, it may mean a fight,\" agreed the French captain, \"but an officer of the French army will not shirk an encounter with these German aggressors.\"  \"No, nor an English officer,\" declared the lieutenant. \"War between England and Germany has not been declared yet, but it seems only a question of hours until it will be.\"  Hal was suddenly struck with an idea. He turned to the lieutenant.  \"Why cannot we go with you?\" he asked. \"We must get to Brussels as soon as possible. If we wait here until after the mobilization of all the German forces, and are unable to send a message to mother, she will be frantic. Why cannot we go with you?\"  The lieutenant was taken aback.  \"Why, I know no reason,\" he said, \"except that your presence in our company, if ill fortune should befall us, would probably mean your arrest as enemies of Germany. You might even be convicted as spies, and shot.\"  \"We are willing to take any chances necessary to get us to Brussels and put an end to mother's worries,\" declared Hal stoutly. \"Aren't we, Chester?\"  \"You bet we are,\" replied Chester.  The lieutenant turned to Captain Derevaux. \"What do you say?\" he asked.  The captain shook his head.  \"It's a bad business,\" he replied slowly. \"If we are caught it will go hard with our young friends, I am afraid. Of course, I am willing to do anything in my power to aid them, but this--this, I fear, is impossible.\"  \"Don't say no,\" implored Hal. \"Just think how mother must be worrying. Why, we would go through anything to save her pain. Besides, you don't expect to be captured, do you?\"  The captain shook his head.  \"You have a good plan of escape, I am sure, or you would not tackle it. Isn't that so?\" continued Hal.  The captain admitted it.  \"Would our presence make it more dangerous for you?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then, I ask you again, if you won't allow us to go with you, sharing whatever dangers may arise. Besides,\" and Hal smiled, \"you know that four are sometimes better than two.\"  The captain reflected.  \"You are right,\" he said at length. \"If Anderson is agreeable, I shall be glad of your company; yes, and your aid,\" he added, after a pause.  \"I agree with the boys,\" said the lieutenant. \"Four are sometimes better than two, and in an adventure, such as this promises to be, four are always better than two. I say, let them come with us, by all means.\"  And so it was decided. A meeting-place was arranged for eight o'clock that night, and, with this parting injunction, the officers left:  \"Say nothing to anyone. Do not talk, even between yourselves, and, if you can, buy a revolver apiece,\" for the purchase of which the lieutenant tendered Hal a bill.     CHAPTER III.  TOWARD THE FRONTIER.   It was a long afternoon for Hal and Chester, and they waited impatiently for the time when they were to meet the two young men who were to be their companions on the journey.  After several futile attempts the lads finally gave up their attempt to buy revolvers, as it caused too many questions, and, in spite of their eagerness to get away, it was with no little anxiety that they made their way to the rendezvous that night.  Captain Derevaux and Lieutenant Anderson were waiting when the lads arrived.  \"I am glad you are prompt,\" said the former. \"We must hurry. Even now we may be followed,\" and he glanced about furtively.  \"Which way do we go?\" asked Hal, of the young Englishman, as the four moved along the street.  \"North,\" was the reply. \"We are heading for Kolberg, on the Baltic Sea. From there we will try to get across into Denmark. The thing to do is to get out of Germany at the earliest possible moment, and, with good luck in getting a boat of some kind at Kolberg, that is the quickest route.\"  \"Won't we have trouble getting a boat?\"  \"I am afraid we shall; but we must leave something to chance.\"  \"Well, I guess we won't be any worse off in Kolberg than in Berlin,\" said Hal. \"How do you figure to get there?\"  \"Automobile! We have arranged for a car to pick us up on the northern outskirts of the city, just inside the line.\"  \"Won't the place be guarded?\"  \"Of course; but, by a little ingenuity and a bold dash, we should be able to get through. If not--\"  The lieutenant shrugged his shoulders expressively.  \"Well,\" said Hal, \"I won't object to a little excitement.\"  \"Don't worry,\" replied the young officer; \"you will have all the excitement you want, and more, too, or I miss my guess.\"  They continued their walk in silence.  Beyond getting into Denmark, the young officers had formulated no plan. But, once out of Germany, the rest would be easy. A ship to England, and from there into France for the young Frenchman, and the two American boys would telegraph to their mother, or continue their journey alone. Lieutenant Anderson was bound direct for London, where he would join his regiment.  The officers had decided to make their attempt at escape by way of Denmark because, in all likelihood, the country between Berlin and Kolberg would be less closely guarded than any other part of the German Empire. Troops were being rushed to the French and Russian borders, and they realized it was practically impossible for them to journey in those directions without being captured. Also the southern route offered little hope of success.  The streets became more and more deserted as the four friends continued their walk toward the northern outskirts. They passed several detachments of rapidly moving troops, but they were unchallenged.  Suddenly the young Englishman called a halt.  \"The automobile is waiting at the next corner,\" he explained. \"Just beyond is the northern limit of the city. Go quietly and we may not be molested.\"  Hal and Chester were greatly excited by this time, but they obeyed instructions as well as they could, and climbed into the big car that was waiting for them, without even being seen. The driver immediately started the machine, and our boys were on their way at last.  On toward the city line the big car rushed, and it was just as the four friends were breathing a sigh of relief at having passed the first danger safely, that a harsh voice rang out:  \"Halt!\"  Almost directly ahead stood a squad of armed men, their rifles leveled straight at the occupants of the oncoming car.  \"The patrol!\" exclaimed Captain Derevaux, as the auto came to a stop.  An officer approached the side of the machine.  \"Give an account of yourselves,\" he demanded. \"Your passports, please.\"  \"We have none,\" replied Captain Anderson. \"We are just taking a little spin.\"  \"You cannot pass here,\" said the officer. \"Either return at once, or I shall be forced to place you under arrest.\"  There was no use arguing.  \"Home it is, then,\" said the young Englishman aloud, and then in a whisper to the driver: \"Ahead! Full speed!\"  \"To the bottom of the car!\" he cried, as the machine jumped forward with a lurch.  He dived to the floor of the car, the young Frenchman and Hal following his example.  Chester, however, had been so surprised at the suddenness of this maneuver, that for a moment he was unable to move; but, while his momentary inaction placed him in great danger, it nevertheless saved his companions from capture, or even death.  As the automobile lunged away, hurling the officer to the side of the street, the latter shouted a command:  \"Fire! Shoot the driver!\"  One man only was in a position to obey. The others were forced to jump for their"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12661"],["title","Canada under British Rule 1760-1900 (#1)"],["body","of Quebec with its many memorials of the French régime; whether we travel over the rich prairies with their sluggish, tortuous rivers, and memories of the French Canadians who first found their way to that illimitable region. In fact, Canada has a rich heritage of associations that connect us with some of the most momentous epochs of the world's history. The victories of Louisbourg and Quebec belong to the same series of brilliant events that recall the famous names of Chatham, Clive, and Wolfe, and that gave to England a mighty empire in Asia and America. Wolfe's signal victory on the heights of the ancient capital was the prelude to the great drama of the American revolution. Freed from the fear of France, the people of the Thirteen Colonies, so long hemmed in between the Atlantic Ocean and the Appalachian range, found full expression for their love of local self-government when England asserted her imperial supremacy. After a struggle of a few years they succeeded in laying the foundation of the remarkable federal republic, which now embraces forty-five states with a population of already seventy-five millions of souls, which owes its national stability and prosperity to the energy and enterprise of the Anglo-Norman race and the dominant influence of the common law, and the parliamentary institutions of England. At the same time, the American Revolution had an immediate and powerful effect upon the future of the communities that still remained in the possession of England after the acknowledgement of the independence of her old colonies. It drove to Canada a large body of men and women, who remained faithful to the crown and empire and became founders of provinces which are now comprised in a Dominion extending for over three thousand miles to the north and east of the federal republic.  The short review of the French régime, with which I am about to commence this history of Canada, will not give any evidence of political, economic, or intellectual development under the influence of French dominion, but it is interesting to the student of comparative politics on account of the comparisons which it enables us to make between the absolutism of old France which crushed every semblance of independent thought and action, and the political freedom which has been a consequence of the supremacy of England in the province once occupied by her ancient rival. It is quite true, as Professor Freeman has said, that in Canada, which is pre-eminently English in the development of its political institutions, French Canada is still \"a distinct and visible element, which is not English,--an element older than anything English in the land,--and which shows no sign of being likely to be assimilated by anything English.\" As this book will show, though a hundred and forty years have nearly passed since the signing of the treaty of Paris, many of the institutions which the French Canadians inherited from France have become permanently established in the country, and we see constantly in the various political systems given to Canada from time to time--notably in the constitution of the federal union--the impress of these institutions and the influence of the people of the French section. Still, while the French Canadians by their adherence to their language, civil law and religion are decidedly \"a distinct and visible element which is not English\"--an element kept apart from the English by positive legal and constitutional guarantees or barriers of separation,--we shall see that it is the influence and operation of English institutions, which have made their province one of the most contented communities of the world. While their old institutions are inseparably associated with the social and spiritual conditions of their daily lives, it is after all their political constitution, which derives its strength from English, principles, that has made the French Canadians a free, self-governing people and developed the best elements of their character to a degree which was never possible under the depressing and enfeebling conditions of the French régime.   SECTION 2.--Discovery and settlement of Canada by France.  Much learning has been devoted to the elucidation of the Icelandic Sagas, or vague accounts of voyages which Bjorne Heriulfson and Lief Ericsson, sons of the first Norse settlers of Greenland, are supposed to have made at the end of the tenth century, to the eastern parts of what is now British North America, and, in the opinion of some writers, even as far as the shores of New England. It is just possible that such voyages were made, and that Norsemen were the first Europeans who saw the eastern shores of Canada. It is quite certain, however, that no permanent settlements were made by the Norsemen in any part of these countries; and their voyages do not appear to have been known to Columbus or other maritime adventurers of later times, when the veil of mystery was at last lifted from the western limits of what was so long truly described as the \"sea of darkness.\" While the subject is undoubtedly full of interest, it is at the same time as illusive as the _fata morgana_, or the lakes and rivers that are created by the mists of a summer's eve on the great prairies of the Canadian west.  Five centuries later than the Norse voyagers, there appeared on the great field of western exploration an Italian sailor, Giovanni Caboto, through whose agency England took the first step in the direction of that remarkable maritime enterprise which, in later centuries, was to be the admiration and envy of all other nations. John Cabot was a Genoese by birth and a Venetian citizen by adoption, who came during the last decade of the fifteenth century, to the historic town of Bristol. Eventually he obtain from Henry VII letters-patent, granting to himself and his three sons, Louis, Sebastian, and Sancio, the right, \"at their own cost and charges, to seek out and discover unknown lands,\" and to acquire for England the dominion over the countries they might discover. Early in May, 1497, John Cabot sailed from Bristol in \"The Matthew,\" manned by English sailors. In all probability he was accompanied by Sebastian, then about 21 years of age, who, in later times, through the credulity of his friends and his own garrulity and vanity, took that place in the estimation of the world which his father now rightly fills. Some time toward the end of June, they made a land-fall on the north-eastern coast of North America. The actual site of the land-fall will always be a matter of controversy unless some document is found among musty archives of Europe to solve the question to the satisfaction of the disputants, who wax hot over the claims of a point near Cape Chidley on the coast of Labrador, of Bonavista, on the east shore of Newfoundland, of Cape North, or some other point, on the island of Cape Breton. Another expedition left Bristol in 1498, but while it is now generally believed that Cabot coasted the shores of North America from Labrador or Cape Breton as far as Cape Hatteras, we have no details of this famous voyage, and are even ignorant of the date when the fleet returned to England.  The Portuguese, Gaspar and Miguel Cortereal, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, were lost somewhere on the coast of Labrador or Newfoundland, but not before they gave to their country a claim to new lands. The Basques and Bretons, always noted for their love of the sea, frequented the same prolific waters and some of the latter gave a name to the picturesque island of Cape Breton. Giovanni da Verrazzano, a Florentine by birth, who had for years led a roving life on the sea, sailed in 1524 along the coasts of Nova Scotia and the present United States and gave a shadowy claim of first discovery of a great region to France under whose authority he sailed. Ten years later Jacques Cartier of St. Malo was authorised by Francis I to undertake a voyage to these new lands, but he did not venture beyond the Gulf of St. Lawrence, though he took possession of the picturesque Gaspé peninsula in the name of his royal master. In 1535 he made a second voyage, whose results were most important for France and the world at large. The great river of Canada was then discovered by the enterprising Breton, who established a post for some months at Stadacona, now Quebec, and also visited the Indian village of Hochelaga on the island of Montreal. Here he gave the appropriate name of Mount Royal to the beautiful height which dominates the picturesque country where enterprise has, in the course of centuries, built a noble city. Hochelaga was probably inhabited by Indians of the Huron-Iroquois family, who appear, from the best evidence before us, to have been dwelling at that time on the banks of the St. Lawrence, whilst the Algonquins, who took their place in later times, were living to the north of the river.  The name of Canada--obviously the Huron-Iroquois word for Kannata, a town--began to take a place on the maps soon after Cartier's voyages. It appears from his _Bref Récit_ to have been applied at the time of his visit, to a kingdom, or district, extending from Ile-aux-Coudres, which he named on account of its hazel-nuts, on the lower St. Lawrence, to the Kingdom of Ochelay, west of Stadacona; east of Canada was Saguenay, and west of Ochelay was Hochelaga, to which the other communities were tributary. After a winter of much misery Cartier left Stadacona in the spring of 1536, and sailed into the Atlantic by the passage between Cape Breton and Newfoundland, now appropriately called Cabot's Straits on modern maps. He gave to France a positive claim to a great region, whose illimitable wealth and possibilities were never fully appreciated by the king and the people of France even in the later times of her dominion. Francis, in 1540, gave a commission to Jean François de la Roque, Sieur de Roberval, to act as his viceroy and lieutenant-general in the country discovered by Cartier,"]]]
