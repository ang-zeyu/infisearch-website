Add slowly   2 cups milk, scalded, and cook over boiling water 20 minutes, stirring until thickened and occasionally afterward. Pour over   2 eggs well beaten, chill, and add   2 cups cream beaten stiff   1 teaspoon vanilla and   1 cup syrup drained from canned raspberries or strawberries, and freeze.  If frozen in a vacuum freezer, put mixture in center can of freezer; cover, invert freezer, and fill outer compartment with finely crushed ice mixed with half the amount of rock salt. Open the freezer occasionally, scrape cream from sides and mix well, using a long-bladed knife. If frozen in an ordinary freezer, it is not necessary to beat the cream.

Remove from hot water, and continue folding over gently until of the desired stiffness.    MARSHMALLOW FROSTING  Use above mixture with or without figs and nuts as a cake filling or frosting.
