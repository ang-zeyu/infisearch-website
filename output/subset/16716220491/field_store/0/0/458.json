Dan reported his own arrival in similar terms.  \"My name is Trent,\" replied the officer of the deck, as he extended his right hand to each, in turn.  \"I hope you will like all of us; I know we shall like you.\"  Then to the messengers Lieutenant Trent gave the order to carry the suit cases to the rooms assigned to the two new ensigns. Dave and Dan followed the messengers through a corridor that led past the ward-room.  The messengers halted before the curtained doorways of adjoining rooms, bags in left hands, their right hands up in salute.  \"This is your room, sir,\" announced the messenger, in the precise tones of the service, while Dan's messenger indicated the other room.  \"Some kind fate must have given us adjoining rooms,\" laughed Dave, when he realized that the two doors stood side by side.  As Darrin passed into his new quarters his first glance rested lovingly on the breech of a huge gun that pierced the armored side of the dreadnought.  \"That's great!\" thought the young ensign, jubilantly.  \"I shall have an emblem and a constant reminder of my duty to the United States!\"  His second glance took in the polished top of a desk, over which hung an electric light.  There is no door to an officer's room; instead, a curtain hangs in place, screening the room from outside view.  At one side, in the cabin, was another curtain, this screening the alcove in which lay the berth.  But Darrin did not stop to study his new quarters just then. There was a duty first to be performed.  Opening his suit case, he took out the trousers and blouse of the blue undress uniform. Into this he changed as rapidly as he could, after which he brushed his hair before the little mirror, then put on his cap.  Next he fastened on his sword belt, after which he hung his sword at his side.  An anxious head-to-foot glance followed, and Ensign Darrin found himself spick and span.  Now he stepped to Dan's door, calling in:  \"May I come in, old fellow?\"  \"I'll be in a strange state of mind if you don't,\" Danny Grin answered.  Ensign Dalzell was putting the finishing touches to his own rapid toilet.  \"I'm going to help myself to your card case,\" announced Dave, who already held a card of his own.  Adding Dan's to that, Ensign Darrin stepped to the doorway, glancing quickly about him.  \"Sentry!\" Dave called.  \"Sir!\" answered a marine, stepping forward and giving the customary salute.  \"Pass the word for a messenger, sentry!\"  \"Aye, aye, sir.\"  In a twinkling the messenger arrived, saluting.  \"Take these cards to the captain, with the respectful compliments of Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell, and state that they await his permission to report to him.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir.\"  In less than a minute the messenger returned, stating that the captain would receive them at once.  Captain Gales, a heavily-built, stately-looking man of fifty, rose from his desk in his office as the two young ensigns stepped through the door.  The young men saluted their commander, then stood rigidly at attention.  \"Mr. Darrin?\" asked the captain, extending his hand, which Dave promptly clasped.  Then Dan was greeted.  \"Glad to have you with us,\" was all the captain said.  Then, to the marine orderly who stood just within the door: \"Show these gentlemen to the executive officer.\"  \"He didn't ask after our folks, nor even if we liked the looks of the ship,\" Dalzell complained, in a whisper, as they followed the orderly.  \"Be silent, Danny Grin!\" urged Darrin, rebukingly.  \"This is no time for jesting.\"  Commander Bainbridge, the executive officer, received the young officers in his quarters.  He proved to be more communicative, talking pleasantly with them for fully a minute and a half after the young men had introduced themselves, and had turned over to him the official papers connecting them with this dreadnought's personnel.  \"Let me see, Mr. Dalzell,\" said Lieutenant Commander Bainbridge, referring to a record book on his desk, \"you will be in Lieutenant Trent's division.  Find Mr. Trent on the quarter deck and report to him.  Mr. Darrin, you are assigned to Lieutenant Cantor's division. I will have an orderly show you to Mr. Cantor.\"  Dan departed first, walking very erect and feeling unusually elated, for Dalzell had thoroughly liked the appearance of Trent in their brief meeting, and believed that he would be wholly contented in serving under that superior.  While Dave's quarters were on the port side of the ship, Cantor's proved to be on the right side.  The messenger halted before a curtained doorway, rapping.  \"Who's there?\" called a voice inside.  \"Messenger, sir, showing Ensign Darrin to Lieutenant Cantor, sir.\"  \"Then you may go, messenger.  Darrin, wait just an instant won't you, until I finish my toilet.\"  \"Very good, sir.\"  A moment later the hail came from within.  \"Right inside, Darrin!\"  Dave entered, to find a somewhat older officer standing with extended hand.  But Ensign Darrin could not believe his eyes when he found himself faced by the man who had annoyed the young woman on the night before---and that annoyer standing there erect and handsome in the uniform of a Navy lieutenant!     CHAPTER II  AT THE MERCY OF A BULLY   Their hands met, but in light clasp, without pretense of warmth.  Then Darrin fell back, bringing his right hand mechanically to a salute as he mumbled:  \"I am Ensign Darrin, sir, and have been ordered, by the executive officer, to report to you for duty in your division.\"  \"Very good, Mr. Darrin,\" rejoined the lieutenant.  \"My division goes on watch at eight bells noon.  You will report to me on the quarter deck at that time.\"  \"Very good, sir.\"  With a quick step Lieutenant Cantor reached the curtain, holding it slightly aside and peering out into the passage-way.  His face was red, but there was one portion that was redder still.  \"I see,\" Dave reflected, \"that Cantor still wears the welt that I printed on his cheek last night.  But it staggers me,\" he thought, gravely, \"to find such a fellow holding an officer's commission in the Navy.\"  Satisfied that there were no eavesdroppers near, Lieutenant Cantor stepped back, facing the young ensign, whom he looked over with an expression of mingled hate and distress.  \"I believe we have met before,\" said Cantor, with a quick, hissing indrawing of his breath.  \"To my very great regret, we have, sir,\" Darrin answered, coldly.  \"Last night!\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And you behaved abominably, Darrin!\"  \"Indeed, sir?\"  \"You interfered,\" Lieutenant Cantor continued, \"with one of the most important affairs of my life.\"  \"Yes, sir?  With one of the most shameful, I should imagine, sir.\"  Ensign Darrin's tone was officially respectful, but his glance cold.  He felt no respect for Cantor, and could see no reason why he should pretend respect.  \"I had a strong belief that I should see you again,\" Cantor continued, his gleaming eyes turned on the new ensign.  \"You knew me to be of the Navy, sir?\"  \"I did not, Darrin, nor did you know me to be of the Navy.  Otherwise, it is not likely that you would have behaved as you did.\"  \"If I had known you to be the fleet admiral, Mr. Cantor, my conduct could not have been different, under the circumstances.\"  \"Darrin, you are a fool!\" hissed the division officer.  \"I am much obliged to you, sir, for your good opinion,\" Dave answered, in an even voice.  For an instant the lieutenant frowned deeply.  Then his face cleared. His glance became almost friendly as he continued:  \"Darrin, I think it probable that you will have a chance to repair your bad work of last night.\"  \"Sir?\"  \"Last night you told me that you had noted the number of the taxicab in which the young woman escaped me.\"  \"I did, sir.\"  \"Perhaps you still remember that number.  Indeed, I am sure that you must.\"  \"I do remember the number, sir.\"  \"What was it?\" asked Cantor, eagerly.  \"That number, sir, so far as I am concerned,\" Ensign Darrin answered, tranquilly, \"is a woman's secret.\"  \"It is a secret which I have a right to know,\" Lieutenant Cantor went on pressingly.  \"The number, sir, I would not dream of giving you without the permission of the young woman herself,\" Darrin answered, slowly. \"As I do not even know her name, it is unlikely that I shall be able to secure that permission.\"  \"Darrin, it is my right to receive an answer to my question,\" insisted Cantor, his eyes glittering coldly.  \"You will have to find out from some one other than myself, then,\" was Dave's calm answer.  \"Darrin, you force me to tell you more than I really ought to tell.  I am going to marry that young woman!\"  \"Is the young woman aware of your intentions, sir?\" Dave demanded, quietly.  \"Yes!  Darrin, I tell you, I am going to marry that young woman, and it is most imperative that I should see her as early as possible. Give me the number of that taxicab, and I can find the driver and learn where he took her.  Now, what are you smiling at, Darrin?\"  \"It struck me, sir, that you should already know the address of a young woman whom you are engaged to marry.\"  Lieutenant Cantor repressed an exclamation of impatience and bit his lips.  \"Of course I know her home address,\" he deigned to reply, \"but she is not a New Yorker.  Her home is at a considerable distance, and I do not know where to find her in New York.  Give me that taxicab number and I shall be able to secure shore leave.  By this evening I shall have found her.\"  \"You do not expect me to wish you luck in a matter like this, sir?\" Ensign Darrin inquired.  \"I expect you to give me the number of that taxicab, and at once,\" replied Cantor.  He did not raise his voice, but there was compelling fury in his tone.  \"I have already declined to do that, sir,\" Dave insisted.  \"Darrin, do you realize that I am your superior?\" demanded the lieutenant.  \"I am aware, sir, that you are my superior officer,\" Darrin answered, with strong emphasis on the word \"officer.\"  \"And you refuse to please me in a trifling matter?\"  \"Pardon me,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12777"],["title","The Young Engineers in Nevada; Or, Seeking Fortune on the Turn of a Pick (#1)"],["body","r, but Alf was soon panting.  \"Let's stop, now,\" proposed Tom, in a kindly voice.  \"After you've rested a couple of minutes I'm going to show you how to breathe right and fill your lungs with air.\"  Soon they were trying this most sensible \"stunt.\"  Alf, however, didn't succeed very well.  Whenever he tried hard it set him to coughing.  \"You see, it's mostly due to the cigarettes,\" said Tom gravely. \"Alf, you've simply got to turn over a new leaf.  You're headed just right to have consumption.\"  \"Cigarettes don't give a fellow consumption!\" retorted the younger boy sullenly.  \"I don't believe they do,\" Tom admitted, thoughtfully.  \"Consumption is caused by germs, I've heard.  But germs take hold best in a weakened part of the body, and your lungs, Alf, are weak enough for any germ to find a good place to lodge.  What you've got to do is to make your lungs so strong that they'll resist germs.\"  \"You talk like a doctor!\"  \"No; I'm trying to talk like an athlete.  I used to be a half-way amateur athlete, Drew, and I'm still taking care of my body. That's why I've never allowed any white-papered little 'coffin-nails' to fool around me.  Bad as your lungs are, Alf, they're not one whit worse than your nerves.  You'll go to pieces if you find yourself under the least strain.  You'll get to shivering and crying, if you don't stop smoking cigarettes.\"  \"Don't you believe it,\" muttered the boy, sullenly.  \"Alf,\" smiled Tom, laying a hand gently on the boy's shoulder, \"you don't know me yet.  You haven't any idea how I can hang to a thing until I win.  I'm going to keep hammering at you until I make you throw your cigarettes away.\"  \"I'm never going to stop smoking 'em,\" retorted Drew.  \"There wouldn't be any comfort in life if I stopped.\"  \"Is it as bad as that?\" queried Tom, with ready sympathy.  \"Then all the more reason for stopping.  Come; let's finish our walk.\"  \"Say, I don't want to go down and through that thick brush,\" objected Alf Drew, slowing his steps.  \"Why not?\"  \"Snakes!\"  \"Are you afraid of snakes, Alf?\"  \"Some kinds.\"  \"What kinds?\"  \"Well, rattlers, f'r instance.\"  \"There are none of that kind on this part of the Indian Smoke Range,\" Reade rejoined.  \"Come along with me.\"  There was something mildly though surely compelling in Tom's manner.  Alf Drew went along, though he didn't wish to.  The two were just at the fringe of the thick underbrush when there came a warning sound just ahead of them.  Click! cl-cl-click!  \"Whee!  Me for outer this!\" gasped Alf, going whiter than ever as he turned.  But Tom caught him by the shoulder.  \"What's the matter?\" demanded Reade.  Click cl-cl-click!  \"There it is again,\" cried Alf, in fear.  \"What on earth are you talking about?\" Tom demanded.  Once more the dread sound smote the air.  \"Rattlers!\" wailed Drew, perspiring from fear.  \"Lemme get away from this.\"  \"Nonsense!\" retorted Reade, retaining a strong clutch on the boy's shoulder, though once more the sound reached their ears.  \"It's all your nerves, Alf,\" Tom insisted.  \"You just imagine such things.  That's what cigarettes do to your nerves.\"  \"But don't you hear the rattlesnake?\"  \"I don't,\" Tom gravely informed him, though once more the nerve-disturbing sound rose clearly on the air.  \"See here, Alf, rattlers, whatever their habits, certainly don't climb trees.  I'll put you up on that limb.\"  Tom's strong young arms lifted Alf easily until he could clutch at the lowest limb of a tree.  \"Climb up there and sit down,\" Reade ordered.  Drew sat on the limb, shaking with terror.  \"Now, I'll show you that there isn't a snake anywhere in that clump of brush,\" Tom proposed, and forthwith stepped into the thicket, beating about lustily with his heavy boots.  \"L-l-l-look out!\" shivered Drew.  \"You'll be bitten!\"  \"Nonsense, I tell you.  There isn't a rattler anywhere on this part of the Range.  It's your nerves, Alf.  Cigarettes are destroying 'em.  There!  I've beaten up every bit of this brush and you see that I've not been bitten.  Now I'll help you down to the ground, and you want to get a good, steadying grip on your nerves.\"  Alf Drew permitted himself to be helped to the ground.  No sooner, however, had his feet touched the earth than there came that ominous rattling sound.  \"There, you big idiot!\" howled Alf. \"There it is again!\"  \"Just your bad nerves, Alf,\" Tom smiled.  \"They're so bad that I'll overlook your lack of respect calling me an idiot!\"  \"Don't you s'pose I know rattlers when I hear 'em?\" asked Drew, sullenly.  \"I was almost bitten by one once, and that's why I'm so afraid of 'em.\"  \"I _was_ bitten once,\" Tom replied.  \"Yet you see that I'm not very nervous about them, especially in a part of the country where none are ever found.  It's your nerves, Alf---and cigarettes!\"  \"I wish I had one now,\" sighed the younger boy.  \"A rattlesnake?\" Tom inquired innocently.  \"No---of course not!  A cigarette.\"  \"But you're going to forget those soul-destroying little coffin-nails,\" Reade suggested.  \"You're going to become a man and act like one. You're going to learn how much more fun it is to have your lungs filled with pure air instead of stifling cigarette smoke.\"  \"Maybe I am!\" muttered the boy.  \"Oh, yes; I'm sure of it,\" said Reade cheerfully.  Cl-cl-cl-click!  \"O-o-o-ow!\" shrilled Alf, jumping at least two feet.  \"Now, what's the matter with you?\" inquired Tom in feigned astonishment.  \"Don't tell me you didn't hear the rattler just now,\" cried young Drew fiercely.  \"No; I didn't,\" Tom assured him.  \"And how could we find a rattler--_here_?  We're crossing open ground now.  There is no place within three hundred feet of us for a rattlesnake to move without our seeing him.\"  Cl-cl-cl-click!  Alf Drew held back, trembling.  \"I'm not going forward another step,\" he insisted.  \"This ground is full of rattlers.\"  \"Let's go back to camp, then, if your nerves are so unstrung,\" Reade proposed.  They turned, starting backward.  Again the warning rattle sounded, seemingly just in front of Alf, though there was no place for a snake to conceal itself nearby.  Alf, however, turned paler still, halted and started off at right angles to his former course.  Again the rattle sounded.  \"Hear that snake?\" demanded young Drew.  \"No; and there isn't one,\" Tom assured him.  \"Why will you be so foolish---so nervous?  In other words, why do you destroy your five senses with cigarettes in this fashion?\"  Cl-cl-click!  Alf Drew halted, trembling so that he could hardly stand.  \"I'm going to quit camp---going to get out of this place,\" he shivered.  \"The ground is full of rattlers.  O-o-o-oh!  There's another tuning up.\"  Tom laughed covertly.  The disturbing sound came again.  \"I never saw a place like this part of the range,\" Alf all but sobbed, his breath catching.  \"Oh, won't I be glad to see a city again!\"  \"Just so you can find a store where you can buy cigarettes?\" Tom Reade queried.  \"I wish I had one, now,\" moaned the young victim.  \"It would steady me.\"  \"The last ones that you smoked didn't appear to steady you,\" the young engineer retorted.  \"Just see how unstrung you are.  Every step you take you imagine you hear rattlers sounding their warning.\"  \"Do you tell me, on your sacred honor,\" proposed Alf, \"that you haven't heard a single rattler this afternoon?\"  \"I give you my most solemn word that I haven't,\" Tom answered. \"Come, come, Alf!  What you want to do is to shake off the trembles. Let me take your arm.  Now, walk briskly with me.  Inflate your chest with all the air you can get in as we go along.  Just wait and see if that isn't the way to shake off these horrid cigarette dreams.\"  Something in Reade's vigorous way of speaking made Alf Drew obey. Tom put him over the ground at as good a gait as he judged the cigarette victim would be able to keep up.  Readers of the preceding volumes of this series, and of other, earlier series, need not the slightest introduction to Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton.  Our readers of the \"_Grammar School Series_\" know Tom and Harry as two of the members of that famous sextette of schoolboy athletes who, under the leadership of Dick Prescott, were known as Dick & Co.  In the \"_High School Boys Series_,\" too, our readers have followed the fortunes of Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, through all their triumphs on football fields, on baseball diamonds and in all the school sports.  Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes succeeded in winning appointments to the United States military Academy, and their adventures are fully set forth in the \"_West Point Series_.\"  Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell \"made\" the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, and what befell them there has been fully set forth in the \"_Annapolis Series_.\"  Reade and Harry Hazelton elected to go through life as civil engineers. In \"_The Young Engineers in Colorado_\" has been fully set forth the extraordinary work of these young men at railroad building through the mountains wilds.  In \"_The Young Engineers in Arizona_\" we have followed Tom and Harry through even more startling adventures, and have seen how they handled even greater problems in engineering.  Up to date the careers of these two bright young men had not been humdrum ones.  The surroundings in which their professional lives had been passed had been such as to supply them with far more startling adventures than either young man had ever looked for.  And now they were in Nevada, the state famous for its gold and silver mines.  Yet they had come ere solely in search of a few weeks of rest. Rest?  There was anything but rest immediately ahead of the young engineers, but the curtain had not been lifted.  Immediately after the completion of their great work in Arizona, Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton had gone back east to the good old home town of Gridley.  While there they had encountered Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes, their old school chums, at that time cadets at the United States Military Academy.  The doings of the four old chums at that time in Gridley are set forth "]]]
