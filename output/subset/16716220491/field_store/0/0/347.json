A third knock sounded through the house.  \"What's that?\"  cried the old woman, starting up.  \"A rat,\" said the old man in shaking tones--\"a rat.  It passed me on the stairs.\"  His wife sat up in bed listening.  A loud knock resounded through the house.  \"It's Herbert!\"  she screamed.  \"It's Herbert!\"  She ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by the arm, held her tightly.  \"What are you going to do?\"  he whispered hoarsely.  \"It's my boy; it's Herbert!\"  she cried, struggling mechanically. \"I forgot it was two miles away.  What are you holding me for?  Let go. I must open the door.\"  \"For God's sake don't let it in,\" cried the old man, trembling.  \"You're afraid of your own son,\" she cried, struggling.  \"Let me go.  I'm coming, Herbert; I'm coming.\"  There was another knock, and another.  The old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room.  Her husband followed to the landing, and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs.  He heard the chain rattle back and the bottom bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket.  Then the old woman's voice, strained and panting.  \"The bolt,\" she cried, loudly.  \"Come down.  I can't reach it.\"  But her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw.  If he could only find it before the thing outside got in.  A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated through the house, and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage against the door.  He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back, and at the same moment he found the monkey's paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.  The knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the house.  He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened.  A cold wind rushed up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him courage to run down to her side, and then to the gate beyond.  The street lamp flickering opposite shone on a quiet and deserted road."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12139"],["title","The Gringos (#1)"],["body","n't buy him back. Then he came into Billy Wilson's place and sat into a game at the table next to mine; and some kind of a quarrel started. He'd overlooked that gun on the saddle, it seems, and so he only had a knife. He whipped it out, first pass, but a bullet got him in the heart. The fellow that did it--\" Jack blew two more rings and watched them absently--\"the Committee rounded him up and took him out to the oak, next morning. Trial took about fifteen minutes, all told. They had him hung, in their own minds, before the greaser quit kicking. I _know_ the man shot in self-defense; I saw the Spaniard pull his knife and start for him with blood in his eye. But some of the Committee had it in for Sandy, and so--it was adios for him, poor devil. They murdered him in cold blood. I told them so, too. I told them--\"  \"Yes, I haven't the slightest doubt of that!\" Dade flung away a half-smoked cigarette and agitatedly began to roll another one. \"That's one reason why I want you to come down to Palo Alto, Jack. You know how things are going here, lately; and Perkins hates you since you took the part of that peon he was beating up,--and, by the way, I saw that same Injun at Don Andres' rancho. Now that Perkins is Captain, you'll get into trouble if you hang around this burg without some one to hold you down. This ain't any place for a man that's got your temper and tongue. Say, I heard of a horse--\"  \"No, you don't! You can't lead me out like that, old boy. I'm all right; Bill Wilson and I are pretty good friends; and Bill's almost as high a card as the Committee, if it ever came to a show-down. But it won't. I'm not a fool; I didn't quarrel with them, honest. They had me up for a witness and I told the truth--which didn't happen to jibe with the verdict they meant to give. The Captain as good as said so, and I just pleasantly and kindly told him that in my opinion Sandy was a better man than any one of 'em. That's all there was to it. The Captain excused me from the witness chair, and I walked out of the tent. And we're friendly enough when we meet; so you needn't worry about me.\"  \"Better come, anyway,\" urged Dade, though he was not hopeful of winning his way.  Jack shook his head. \"No, I don't want anything of country life just yet. I had all the splendid solitude my system needs, this last summer. You like it; you're a kind of a lone rider anyway. You never did mix well. You go back and honor Don Andres with your presence--and he is honored. If the old devil only knew it! Maybe, later on--So you like your new horse, huh? What you going to call him?\"  Dade grinned a little. \"Remember that picture in Shakespeare of 'White Surry'? Or it was in Shakespeare till you tore it out to start a fire, that wet night; remember? The arch in his neck, and all? I hadn't gone a mile on him till I was calling him Surry; and say, Jack, he's a wonder! Come out and take a look at him. Can't be more than four years old, and gentle as a kitten. That poor devil knew how to train a horse, even if he didn't have any sense about whisky. I'll bet money couldn't have touched him if the man had been sober.\"  He stopped in the doorway and looked up and down the street with open disgust. \"Come on down to Picardo's, Jack; what the deuce is there here to hold you? How a man that knows horses and the range, can stand for this--\" he waved a gloved hand at the squalid street--\"is something I can't understand. To me, it's like hell with the lid off. What's holding you anyway? Another señorita?\"  \"I'm making more money here lately than I did in the mine.\" Jack evaded smoothly. \"I won a lot last night. Whee-ee! Say, you played in some luck yourself, old man, when you bought that outfit. That saddle and bridle's worth all you paid for the whole thing. White Surry, eh? He has got a neck--and, Lord, look at those legs!\"  \"Climb on and try him out once!\" invited Dade guilefully. If he could stir the horseman's blood in Jack's veins, he thought he might get him away from town.  \"Haven't time right now, Dade. I promised to meet a friend--\"  Dade shrugged his shoulders and painstakingly smoothed the hair tassel which dangled from the browband. The Spaniard had owned a fine eye for effect when he chose jet black trappings for Surry, who was white to his shining hoofs.  \"All right; I'll put him in somewhere till after dinner. Then I'm going to pull out again. I can't stand this hell-pot of a town--not after the Picardo hacienda.\"  \"I wonder,\" grinned Jack slyly, \"if there isn't a señorita at Palo Alto?\"  He got no answer of any sort. Dade was combing with his fingers the crinkled mane which fell to the very chest of his new horse, and if he heard he made no betraying sign.     CHAPTER II  THE VIGILANTES   Bill Wilson came to the door of his saloon and stood with his hands on his hips, looking out upon the heterogeneous assembly of virile manhood that formed the bulk of San Francisco's population a year or two after the first gold cry had been raised. Above his head flapped the great cloth sign tacked quite across the rough building, heralding to all who could read the words that this was BILL WILSON'S PLACE. A flaunting bit of information it was, and quite superfluous; since practically every man in San Francisco drifted towards it, soon or late, as the place where the most whisky was drunk and the most gold lost and won, with the most beautiful women to smile or frown upon the lucky, in all the town.  The trade wind knew that Bill Wilson's place needed no sign save its presence there, and was loosening a corner in the hope of carrying it quite away as a trophy. Bill glanced up, promised the resisting cloth an extra nail or two, and let his thoughts and his eyes wander again to the sweeping tide of humanity that flowed up and down the straggling street of sand and threatened to engulf the store which men spoke of simply as \"Smith's.\"  A shipload of supplies had lately been carted there, and miners were feverishly buying bacon, beans, \"self-rising\" flour, matches, tea--everything within the limits of their gold dust and their carrying capacity--which they needed for hurried trips to the hills where was hidden the gold they dreamed of night and day.  To Bill that tide meant so much business; and he was not the man to grudge his friend Smith a share of it. When the fog crept in through the Golden Gate--a gate which might never be closed against it--the tide of business would set towards his place, just as surely as the ocean tide would clamor at the rocky wall out there to the west. In the meantime, he was not loath to spend a quiet hour or two with an empty gaming hall at his back.  His eyes went incuriously over the familiar crowd to the little forest of flag-foliaged masts that told where lay the ships in the bay below the town. Bill could not name the nationality of them all; for the hunting call had reached to the far corners of the earth, and strange flags came fluttering across strange seas, with pirate-faced adventurers on the decks below, chattering in strange tongues of California gold. Bill could not name all the flags, but he could name two of the bonds that bind all nations into one common humanity. He could produce one of them, and he was each night gaining more of the other; for, be they white men or brown, spoke they his language or one he had never heard until they passed through the Golden Gate, they would give good gold for very bad whisky.  Even the Digger Indians, squatting in the sun beside his door and gazing stolidly at the town and the bay beyond, would sell their souls--for which the gray-gowned padres prayed ineffectively in the chapel at Dolores--their wives or their other, dearer possessions for a very little bottle of the stuff that was fast undoing the civilizing work of the Mission. The padres had come long before the hunting cry was raised, and they had labored earnestly; but their prayers and their preaching were like reeds beneath the tread of elephants, when gold came down from the mountains, and whisky came in through the Golden Gate.  Jack Allen, coming lazily down through the long, deserted room, edged past Bill in the doorway.  \"Hello,\" Bill greeted with a carefully casual manner, as if he had been waiting for the meeting, but did not want Jack to suspect the fact. \"Up for all day? Where you headed for?\"  \"Breakfast--or dinner, whichever you want to call it. Then I'm going to take a walk and get the kinks out of my legs. Say, old man, I'm going to knock a board off the foot of that bunk, to-night, or else sleep on the floor. Was wood scarce, Bill, when you built that bed?\"  \"Carpenter was a little feller,\" chuckled Bill, \"and I guess he measured it by himself. Charged a full length price, though, I remember! I meant to tell you when you hired that room, Jack, that you better take the axe to bed with you. Sure, knock a board off; two boards, if you like. Take _all_ the boards off!\" urged Bill, in a burst of generosity. \"You might better be making that bunk over, m'son, than trying to take the whole blamed town apart and put it together again, like you was doing last night.\" In this way Bill tactfully swung to the subject that lay heavy on his mind.  Jack borrowed a match, cupped his fingers around his lips that wanted to part in a smile, and lighted his before-breakfast cigarette--though the sun hung almost straight overhead.  \"So that's it,\" he observed, when the smoke took on the sweet aroma of a very mild tobacco. \"I saw by the back of your neck that you had something on your mind. What's the matter, Bill? Don't you think the old town needs taking apart?\"  \"Oh, it needs it, all right. But it's too big a job for one man to tackle. You leave that to Daddy Time; he's the only reformer--\"  \"Say, Bill, I never attempted to reform anybody or anything in my life; I'd hate to begin with a job the size of this.\" He waved his cigarette toward the shifting crowd. \"But I do think--\"  \"And right there's where you make a big mistake."]]]
