You see, in two years of the awful grind a fellow, if he lasts that long, has learned how to study in the right way. I'm going to get two tickets, Belle, so that you and your mother can go to see the game. And of course good old Dick can do as much for Laura Bentley and her mother. You'll come, of course, to root your hardest for the Navy, just as Laura will go and root for the Army. By the way, have you heard whether Dick and Greg expect to play on the Army eleven?\"  \"When they were here this summer they said they hoped to play football with the Army. That's all I know, Dave, about the plans of Dick and Greg.\"  \"I hope they do play,\" cried Midshipman Darrin cheerily. \"Even with two such old gridiron war horses as Dick and Greg against us, I believe that the Navy team, this year, has some fellows who can take the Army scalp with neatness and despatch.\"  Dave rambled on, for some time now, with of the athletic doings at the Naval Academy. It was not that he was so much interested in the subject--at that particular moment--but it was certainly fine to have Belle Meade for an interested listener.  \"Well, you're half way through your course,\" put in Belle at last. \"You passed your last annual examinations in June.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How did you stand in your exams?\"  \"I came through with honors,\" Dave declared unblushingly.  \"Honors?\" repeated Belle delightedly. \"Oh, Dave, I didn't know you were one of the honor men of your class.\"  \"Yes,\" laughed Midshipman Dave, though there was a decidedly serious look in his fine face. \"Belle, I consider that any fellow who gets by the examiners has passed with honors. So we're all honor men that are now left in the class. Several of the poor fellows had to write home last June asking their parents for the price of a ticket homeward.\"  \"But, now that you've got half way through, you're pretty sure to go the rest of the way safely,\" Belle insisted.  \"That's almost too much of a brag to make, Belle. The truth is, no fellow is safe until he has been commissioned as an ensign, and that's at least two years after he has graduated from the Naval Academy. Why even after examination, you know, a fellow has to go to sea for two years, as a midshipman, and then take another and final examination at sea. A whole lot of fellows who managed to get through the Academy find themselves going to pieces on that examination at sea.\"  \"And then--\" went on Belle.  \"Why, if a fellow can't pass his exams, he's dropped from the service.\"  \"After he has already graduated from Academy? That isn't fair,\" cried Belle Meade.  \"No, it isn't quite fair,\" assented Midshipman Dave, with a shrug of his shoulders. \"Yet what is one going to do about it? It's all in the game--to take or leave.\"  \"Who ever made the Naval Academy and the service so hard as that?\" the girl wanted to know.  \"Congress, I guess,\" laughed Dave, \"but acting, very likely, on the advice of a lot of old admirals who are through themselves, and who expect the youngsters to know as much as the very admirals. Why, Belle, when I was a few years younger, and first began to dream about going to the Naval Academy I had a mental picture of a very jolly life, in which we sailed the seas and absorbed our knowledge. I had an idea that the midshipman's life was made up mainly of jolly larks ashore and afloat, with plenty of athletics to keep us from ever feeling dull. Of course, I knew we had to do some studying, but I didn't imagine the studies would be hard for a chap who had already gone through a good High School.\"  \"Your High School studies did help, didn't they?\" demanded Belle.  \"They helped somewhat in the exams, to enter Annapolis, but they've never helped me with any of the studies that I've had to tackle as a midshipman.\"  \"Oh, well, you'll get through,\" the girl predicted with cheery confidence.  \"I shall, if it's really in me,\" Dave promised. \"But I'm not going to do any bragging, Belle, until I'm safely through and have been out of the woods for a long time.\"  \"And you won't do any bragging then, either. It isn't in your line. What's Dan Dalzell going to do while he's home on leave?\"  \"Sleep, he says.\"  \"The lazy boy!\"  \"No, he's a tired boy, Belle. I think the past year has been even just a little harder on him than it has on me. However, of course Dan won't really sleep. He'll be out by this afternoon. Just now I imagine that he's talking like wildfire with his mother.\"  It was a wrong guess, however. Just then the telephone sounded in the next room, and Belle went to answer it.  \"It's your shipmate, Dan,\" she called laughingly. \"He wants to talk with you, Dave.\"  \"I wonder how the fellow ever guessed that I was here,\" smiled Darrin, as he hastily joined Belle at the 'phone.  \"Hello,\" hailed Dalzell at the other end of the wire. \"Going to do anything in particular this afternoon, David, little giant?\"  \"Yes; I hope to make myself more or less agreeable to Miss Meade.\"  \"A small crowd won't be any bar to that, eh?\" Dan wanted to know.  \"Not if the crowd and the occasion are agreeable to Miss Meade.\"  \"Well, you know Foss and Canty?\"  \"Two of our old High School boys? Yes.\"  \"Foss has a new gasoline launch; he says it's a beauty, and he wants us to invite Miss Meade and Miss Bentley, to join them and a couple of the former High School girls for a couple of hours' cruise on the river. What say you?\"  \"What does Belle say, you mean. Wait a moment, and I'll ask her.\"  Darrin explained the invitation.  \"Why, if it will be pleasant for you, Dave, I shall be delighted to go,\" Belle answered.  \"It's all right,\" Dave called back over the 'phone. \"What's the hour for the start!\"  \"Two o'clock,\" Dan answered.  \"All right, then; will you ask Laura Bentley, or shall we, from here?\"  \"I've already asked Laura,\" Dalzell replied. \"She accepted on condition that Belie did. Now I'll ring up Laura and tell her that it's all arranged.\"  \"It'll be a pleasant trip for you, won't it!\" inquired Belle, half-anxiously. \"Or do you get too much of boats in your working year?\"  \"I shall be glad to be anywhere that you are,\" Dave replied gallantly. \"The form of entertainment doesn't matter to me as long as it appeals to you.\"  At two o'clock the young people met at the float of the Boat Club house on the river's bank.  On the way across town Dave had been noting the direction and force of the wind. He didn't altogether like it, but didn't say anything. At the float he found Tom Foss, Ab Canty, Ella Wright and Susie Danes awaiting the midshipmen and their fair companions.  \"All ready and waiting for you amateur sailors,\" called Foss laughingly. \"And here's the boat. Say, isn't she really a beauty?\"  \"Good lines,\" nodded Dave Darrin. \"And she looks speedy. But you've changed your mind about going out this afternoon, haven't you, Foss?\"  \"Why?\" demanded the young fellow, in very evident astonishment.  \"Look at the water,\" responded Dave, pointing to the white-caps, which were running rather high for an inland stream.  \"Pooh! You're not afraid of a little foam on top of the water, are you?\" demanded Foss.  \"The waves are running pretty high for the inches of freeboard that your boat has,\" remarked Darrin quietly. \"And look at the sky to windward. There's a bit more blow coming out of those clouds yet.\"  \"Say, what do they teach you at Annapolis?\" grinned Foss. \"To go sailing only in calm weather?\"  \"Since you ask,\" Dave replied as quietly as before, though a slight flush mounted to his face, \"one of the things they teach us at the Naval Academy is consideration for women. Now, if just we four fellows were going out, I wouldn't say a word.\"  \"Don't think we girls are afraid,\" broke in Belle with spirit.  \"I'm well aware that you're not afraid,\" Darrin replied turning and looking at her. \"But I'm afraid, Belle of what I might think of myself afterwards, if I were a party to taking you out in this boat when the river is running so much to whitecaps.\"  \"Do you think the boat is one of the kind that will turn turtle and sink the crowd?\" demanded Tom Foss, flushing in turn. \"I tell you, Darrin, the craft is as tight and sound, and as manageable, as any boat of her length to be found anywhere on fresh water.\"  \"She is a fine boat,\" Dave assented; \"but I don't feel like being responsible for what may happen to the young lady who is more especially under my escort and care. There's too big a chance of danger this afternoon, Foss.\"  \"Pooh, Mr. Sailor!\" laughed Ella Wright. \"I'll show you that some folks who don't know what Annapolis looks like are not frightened by toy waves.\"  Miss Ella thereupon stepped into the launch and seated herself. Miss Susie followed.  \"Aren't you people going?\" asked Ab Canty.  \"I'm not going if Dave considers it so unwise that he'd be worried about our safety,\" Belle answered promptly.  \"Going, Laura?\" called Foss.  \"No, though I thank you,\" Miss Bentley replied. \"If Mr. Darrin objects on the score of safety I'm not going to torment him by disregarding his opinion.\"  \"I'm of about the same opinion as Darrin, if anyone cares to know,\" broke in Dan Dalzell.  Tom Foss looked at the other half of his party quizzically, then called to Canty.  \"Cast off, Ab. Ha, ha! I never thought to see United States sailors and embryo Naval officers so much afraid of a little tossing water.\"  Chug-chug! Ella and Susie were laughing a bit teasingly as the motor started and the little craft darted away from the float and took to the waves beyond.  Dave did not answer. Instead, he gripped Dan's nearer wrist, muttering:  \"Don't you say it, Danny!\"  \"Say what?\"  \"Whatever hot words were coming to your lips. As long as we feel that we're right in not risking Belle and Laura, never mind what the others think and say.\"  \"This breeze is so fine,\" suggested Laura, \"what do you say if we seat ourselves here and watch the river for a while?\"  Accordingly the four young people seated themselves. The launch was the only craft in sight that was away from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10319"],["title","Dave Darrin's Third Year at Annapolis; Or, Leaders of the Second Class (#2)"],["body"," moorings. A sailboat and three canoes lay tied to the lee side of the float, that is the off-side from the weather. Even they rocked a good deal.  \"What kind of weather is coming?\" asked Belle.  \"It's going to be pretty squally, in all probability,\" spoke up Midshipman Dan. \"Do you see the big puffs of wind in the clouds yonder?\"  \"It must take a sailor to see that sort of thing,\" remarked Belle. \"What I see in the cloud looks like big, fluffy masses of cotton, streaked with something darker.\"  \"That's the wind,\" nodded Dave Darrin. \"Now, girls, I don't want you to think me a muff. That wind may swerve, and not come this way, although in all probability the wind will get this way and the water will be rougher. If it does get rougher on the river, and if we had taken you two out, and the boat had capsized, then by some chance we might not have been able to get you to shore. What would your folks then say to us if we had had the miserable luck to survive you?\"  \"You did just right,\" Laura declared promptly. \"To tell the truth, I didn't want to disappoint either of you boys this afternoon, but I didn't believe the wind was quiet enough for boating on the river. But mother reminded me that I was going with two young men who had been trained as sailors, and that I ought to be as safe as I would in the home parlor.\"  \"Well, aren't you?\" smiled Belle Meade.  \"Did you really want to go out on the river, Belle?\" Dave asked.  \"Not when you don't believe it to be safe.\"  \"I suppose Foss will be joking around town about our being afraid of the water,\" muttered; Dan.  \"What do you care!\" asked Dave quietly. \"You're responsible to the United States Government--not to a few private citizens on the streets of Gridley.\"  \"You'll take us out on the water before your leave is over, won't you?\" urged Belle.  \"A dozen of times, if you care to go,\" Dave; replied quickly.  \"In a sailboat?\" quizzed Belle. \"It must; be great fun to sail, and I've never been in a sailboat.\"  \"I'd rather take you out in a good, solid rowboat,\" Dave answered slowly.  \"Why, haven't you had much sailboat practice at Annapolis yet?\"  \"We've had some,\" Darrin nodded. \"But I'm afraid I don't believe much in small sailboats for girls' parties.\"  \"Oh, very well.\"  \"Now, Belle, you will begin to believe that I'm a muff at heart,\" Darrin remonstrated.  \"I won't anyway, Dave,\" Laura broke in. \"I can see that you're merely determined that we shall take no risks when we go out with you. I shall feel very safe in whatever you propose for water sports.\"  \"It's a good deal better to be safe, than sorry, when you have girls under your care,\" Dan Dalzell added.  The motor boat, a fast though a low-hulled craft, had been long out of sight up the river. Presently there came a new turn to the wind. Dan wet a forefinger and held it up to the breeze.  \"I hope Foss has sense enough to run in somewhere and tie up until the coming squall blows over,\" Dalzell remarked.  \"Are we going to have a storm?\" Belle asked quickly.  \"Not rain, if that's what you mean,\" Darrin replied. \"But I believe the river is going to be pretty rough before long.\"  Ere two minutes more had passed Dave suddenly rose and straightened himself.  \"Look downstream, girls,\" he cried. \"Do you see the big rollers coming?\"  In truth the surface of the river was now beginning to behave in an unusual way. Where, heretofore, the water had been choppy and whitecapped, the water now broke in longer, foam-crested waves. Owing to the course of the wind the waves were rolling upstream. Within five minutes from the time when Dave first called attention to the rougher water the waves had considerably increased in size.  \"Oh, I'm glad I'm not out on the water,\" shivered Laura.  \"So am I,\" Belle admitted candidly.  \"Do you believe Tom Foss can bring his boat down against such waves!\" Laura inquired.  \"Oh, no doubt, he has had sense enough to run in somewhere and tie up,\" predicted Midshipman Dan charitably.  \"I hope so,\" murmured Belle. \"But Tom is an awfully stubborn fellow.\"  Toot! too-oo-oot! sounded a whistle up the river.  \"By ginger, there comes Foss's boat now!\" muttered Dan, standing up and staring. \"Why doesn't the idiot make land?\"  \"He's got his craft away on the other side of the river, looking for quieter water,\" muttered Dave uneasily.  \"Well, isn't that right?\" asked Belle.  \"Right, yes, unless he makes the mistake of trying to cross the stream,\" nodded Darrin. \"Then he'll run his craft into the trough of the sea, and--\"  \"Well, what?\" demanded Belle as Dave paused.  \"Then, when he's in the trough, a big wave may roll his small boat over,\" Dan finished for his comrade.  \"Do you really think there's danger of that?\" demanded Laura, looking anxious.  \"I don't know,\" murmured Dave. \"But I wish I had some way of signaling Foss, some way so that he could understand the signals.\"  \"What good would it do?\" demanded Midshipman Dalzell, grimly. \"Tom would only laugh and say it was more old maidishness on the part of Navy men.\"  \"There--confound the idiot!\" suddenly blazed Dave Darrin. \"He is crossing. Look at that boat wallow in the trough. Jupiter! There she goes over--nearly!\"  All four young people on the float held their breath for an instant. The motor launch, after almost having turned turtle, righted itself.  \"I wish I were at the wheel of the boat for about three minutes,\" muttered Darrin hoarsely.  At that moment Laura and Belle both screamed, while Dan Dalzell shouted:  \"There she goes--for sure, this time!\"  A bigger wave than usual had half filled the launch and caused it to careen. Before the little craft could right itself a second and a third wave, rolling along, had completed the work. The launch had sunk!     CHAPTER II  PROVING THEIR TRAINING   In the same instant, without a word to each other, Dave Darrin and Dalzell had done the same thing. That is, they started to run and at the same time doffed coats and vests, leaving these garments to flutter behind them.  As they reached the sailboat both midshipmen cast off their shoes. Dave leaped into the boat while Dalzell threw off the bowline, then boarded.  Like a flash both youngsters went at the lashings of the mainsail.  \"There isn't a reef in,\" Dan discovered. \"Going to take time for a close reef, Dave?\"  \"There isn't time,\" Darrin muttered, with drops of cold perspiration on his forehead as he toiled. \"We'll have to go out under a full sail, Dan.\"  \"Great Scott!\" muttered Dalzell.  \"We may be too late to save any one as it is. There! Jump to the halyard. I've got the sheet.\"  Dan Dalzell began to hoist with a will. In an incredibly short time he had the sail hoisted all the way up, while Darrin, stern and whitefaced, crouched and braced himself by the tiller, gripping the sheet with his left hand.  In a twinkling Darrin had the wind in his canvas. They had nearly a fair wind as they bounded away from the float.  During these few instants of preparation neither Belle nor Laura had spoken. Both girls realized the gravity of the situation, and they knew that a word from them might distract the rescuers from the work in hand.  Knowing that he had the high, fast wind with him, Dave steered straight for the last spot where he had seen the motor launch. Though the boat was no longer visible, and the distance too great for seeing the heads of the swimmers, if there were any, Darrin had taken his bearings by trees on the further shore upstream.  At first, to keep the sailboat from capsizing, the young skipper at the helm let the sheet well out. Then, when Dan hurriedly rejoined him, Darrin passed the sheet over to his comrade as to one who would know exactly what to do with it. Dan perched himself on the weather gunwale, his weight there serving as ballast to keep the craft from capsizing. Yet, even so, everything had to be done with the utmost skill, for, with the mainsail up, the least fluke in handling the boat would send her over.  \"We've got to go fast and take all the chances,\" muttered Dave.  \"Sure,\" nodded Midshipman Dan understandingly. \"It would be no great scare to us if we did heel over into the drink. It might mean a different story, though, for those who are already sopping up the wet.\"  \"Aren't they splendid fellows?\" cried Laura.  \"Yes,\" answered Belle, her eyes snapping and her face glowing. \"Though I won't claim that they're any finer than your own West Point boys.\"  That brought an added flush to the color in Laura Bentley's face, and her eyes sparkled her gratitude, for Dick Prescott, now at West Point with his chum, Greg Holmes, had been her High School sweetheart, and doubtless was to become her Army sweetheart after he had made sure of his career.  \"Dave and Dan are experts,\" glowed Miss Bentley. \"They'll know just what to do.\"  \"They're better than mere experts,\" returned Belle Meade. \"They're strong and manly to the core, and with them there's no such word as fear when there's a duty to be done.\"  Both Dave and Dan were peering fixedly ahead all the time that they drove the sailboat toward the scene of the late disaster.  \"I think I see a head,\" cried Darrin.  \"Boy or girl!\" demanded Midshipman Dalzell.  \"Can't tell at this distance. And now the next wave has blotted out what I thought I saw.\"  \"We've got to be patient,\" uttered Dan.  The position of the midshipmen was far from being free of danger. With all their coolness and their undoubted skill in boat handling, there was grave danger, with the mainsail set, that, at any instant, wind and wave would capsize the boat.  Indeed, Dave was running the lee gunwale under water half the time, trusting to the human ballast supplied by his comrade to keep them afloat.  \"See anything now?\" demanded Dave.  \"No,\" uttered Dan, \"though I'm working my eyes three shifts to try to make out something. I'll have to go to an oculist as soon as I get through with this. This eyestrain is awful.\"  Midshipman Dan Dalzell was really unconscious of the fact that he was joking. It was second nature with"]]]
