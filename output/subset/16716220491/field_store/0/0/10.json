All right; we'll find the way, and we'll punish you into the bargain. Dan, get a piece of paper from the other room.\"  Dalzell was quickly back with the desired item. On the paper Dave wrote a name and a telephone number.  \"It's near the end of the doctor's office hours,\" murmured Dave. \"Go to a telephone and ask the doctor to meet you at the corner above. Tell him it's vastly important, and ask him to meet you on the jump.\"  \"Shall I tell him what's up!\" asked Dan cautiously.  \"Yes; you'd better. Then he'll be sure to bring the necessary remedies with him.\"  Dan Dalzell was off like a shot.  Chow tried to edge around toward the door.  \"Here, you get back there,\" cried Dave, seizing the Chinaman and slamming him back against the wall. \"Don't you move again, until we tell you that you may--or it will be the worse for you.\"  Ten minutes passed ere Dan returned with Dr. Lawrence.  \"You see the job that's cut out for you,\" said Darrin, pointing to the unconscious figure in the bunk. \"Can you do it, Doctor?\"  The medical man made a hasty examination of the unconscious midshipman before he answered briefly:  \"Yes.\"  \"Will it be a long job, Doctor?\"  \"Fifteen minutes, probably.\"  \"Oh, good, if you can do it in that time!\"  \"Me go now?\" asked Chow, with sullen curiosity, as the medical man opened his medicine-case.  \"Yes; if you don't try to leave the joint,\" agreed Dave. \"And I'm going outside with you.\"  Chow looked very much as though he did not care for company, but Midshipman Darrin kept at his side.  \"Now, see here, Chow,\" warned Dave, \"this is the last day you sell opium for white men to smoke!\"  \"You heap too flesh (fresh)\" growled the Chinaman.  \"It's the last day you'll sell opium to white men,\" insisted Dave, \"for, as soon as I'm through here I'm going to the police station to inform against you. They'll go through here like a twelve-inch shot.\"  \"You alle same tell cop?\" grinned Chow, green hatred showing through his skin. \"Then I tell evelybody about you fliend in there.\"  \"Do just as you please about that,\" retorted Dave with pretended carelessness. \"For one thing, you don't know his name.\"  \"Oh, yes, I do,\" swaggered Chow impudently. \"Know heap 'bout him. His name alle same Pen'ton.\"  Seizing a marking brush and a piece of paper, Chow Hop quickly wrote out Pennington's name, correctly spelled. His ability to write English with a good hand was one of Chow's great vanities, anyway.  \"You go back to your ironing board, yellow-face,\" warned Darrin, and something in the young third classman's face showed Chow that it would be wise to obey.  Then Hallam drew Darrin to one side, to whisper earnestly in his ear:  \"Look out, old man, or you will get Pen into an awful scrape!\"  \"I shan't do it,\" maintained Darrin. \"If it happens it will have been Pen's own work.\"  \"You'd better let the chink go, just to save one of our class.\"  \"Is a fellow who has turned opium fiend worth saving to the class!\" demanded Dave, looking straight into Hallam's eyes.  \"Well, er--er--\" stammered the other man.  \"You see,\" smiled Dave, \"the doubt hits you just as hard as it does me!\"  \"Oh, of course, a fellow who has turned opium fiend is no fellow ever to be allowed to reach the bridge and the quarter-deck,\" admitted Hallam. \"But see here, are you going to report this affair to the commandant of midshipmen, or to anyone else in authority?\"  \"I've no occasion to report,\" replied Dave dryly. \"I am not in any way in command over Pennington. But I mean to persuade him to report himself for what he has done!\"  \"But that would ruin him!\" protested Hallam, aghast. \"He wouldn't even be allowed to start on the cruise. He'd be railroaded home without loss of a moment.\"  \"Yet you've just said that an opium-user isn't fit to go on in the brigade,\" retorted Darrin.  \"Hang it, it's hard to know what to do,\" rejoined Hallam, wrinkling his forehead. \"Of course we want to be just to Pen.\"  \"It doesn't strike me as being just exactly a question of justice to Pennington,\" Darrin went on earnestly. \"If this is anything it's a question of midshipman honor. We fellows are bound to see that all the unworthy ones are dropped from the service. Now, a fellow who has fastened the opium habit on himself isn't fit to go on, is he?\"  \"Oh, say, but this is a hard one to settle!\" groaned Hallam.  \"Then I'll take all the responsibility upon myself,\" said Dave promptly. \"I don't want to make any mistake, and I don't believe I'm going to. Wait just a moment.\"  Going to the rear room, Dave faced his three comrades there with the question:  \"You three are enough to take care of everything here for a few minutes, aren't you?\"  \"Yes,\" nodded Dan. \"What's up?\"  \"Hallam and I are going for a brief walk.\"  Then, stepping back into the front room, Darrin nodded to his classmate, who followed him outside.  \"Just come along, and say nothing about the matter on the street,\" requested Dave. \"It might be overheard.\"  \"Where are you going?\" questioned Hallam wonderingly.  \"Wait and see, please.\"  From Chow Hop's wretched establishment it was not far to the other building that Dave had in mind as a destination.  But when they arrived, and stood at the foot of the steps, Hallam clutched Darrin's arm, holding him back.  \"Why, see here, this is the police station!\"  \"I know it,\" Dave replied calmly.  \"But see here, you're not--\"  \"I'm not going to drag you into anything that you'd object to,\" Darrin continued. \"Come along; all I want you for is as a witness to what I am going to say.\"  \"Don't do it, old fel--\"  \"I've thought that over, and I feel that I must,\" replied Dave firmly. \"Come along. Don't attract attention by standing here arguing.\"  In another instant the two midshipmen were going swiftly up the steps.  The chief of police received his two callers courteously. Dave told the official how their attention had been called to the fact that one of their number was in an opium joint. Dave named the place, but requested the chief to wait a full hour before taking any action.  \"That will give us a chance to get out a comrade who may have committed only his first offense,\" Dave continued.  \"If there's any opium being smoked in that place I'll surely close the joint out!\" replied the chief, bringing his fist down upon his desk. \"But I understand your reasons, Mr.--\"  \"Darrin is my name, sir,\" replied Dave quietly.  \"So, Mr. Darrin, I give you my word that I won't even start my investigations before this evening. And I'll keep all quiet about the midshipman end of it.\"  \"Thank you very much, sir,\" said Dave gratefully.  As the two midshipmen strolled slowly back in the direction of Chow Hop's, Dave murmured:  \"Now, you see why I took this step?\"  \"I'm afraid not very clearly,\" replied Midshipman Hallam.  \"That scoundrelly Chow made his boast that other midshipmen patronized his place. I don't believe it. Such a vice wouldn't appeal to you, and it doesn't to me. But there are more than two hundred new plebes coming in just now, and many of these boys have never been away from home before. Some of them might foolishly seek the lure of a new vice, and might find the habit fastened on them before they were aware of it. Chow's vile den might spoil some good material for the quarter-deck, and, as a matter of midshipman honor, we're bound to see that the place is cleaned out right away.\"  \"I guess, Darry, you come pretty near being right,\" assented Hallam, after thinking for a few moments.  By the time they reached Chow Hop's again they found that Dr. Lawrence had brought the unfortunate Pennington to. And a very scared and humiliated midshipman it was who now stood up, a bit unsteadily, and tried to smooth down his uniform.  \"How do you feel now?\" asked Dave.  \"Awful!\" shuddered Pennington. \"And now see here, what are you fellows going to do? Blab, and see me driven out of the Navy?\"  \"Don't do any talking in here,\" advised Dave, with a meaning look over his shoulder at the yellow men in the outer room. \"Doctor, is our friend in shape to walk along with us now?\"  \"He will be, in two or three minutes, after he drinks something I'm going to give him,\" replied the medical man, shaking a few drops from each of three vials into a glass of water. \"Here, young man, drink this slowly.\"  Three minutes later the midshipmen left the place, Dave walking beside Pennington and holding his arm lightly for the purpose of steadying him.  \"How did this happen, Pen?\" queried Dave, when the six men of the third class at last found themselves walking down Maryland Avenue. \"How long have you been at this 'hop' trick?\"  \"Never before to-day,\" replied Midshipman Pennington quickly.  \"Pen, will you tell me that on your honor?\" asked Dave gravely.  The other midshipman flared up.  \"Why must I give you my word of honor?\" he demanded defiantly. \"Isn't my plain word good enough?\"  \"Your word of honor that you had never smoked opium before to-day would help to ease my mind a whole lot,\" replied Darrin. \"Come, unburden yourself, won't you, Pen?\"  \"I'll tell you, Darry, just how it happened. To-day _was_ the first time, on my word of honor, I came out into Annapolis with a raging toothache. Now, you know how a fellow gets to hate to go before the medical officers of the Academy with a tale about his teeth.\"  \"Yes, I do,\" nodded Darrin. \"If a fellow is too much on the medical report for trouble with his teeth, then it makes the surgeons look his mouth over with all the more caution, and in the end a fellow may get dropped from the brigade just because he has invited over zeal from the dentist. But what has all this to do with opium smoking?\"  \"Just this,\" replied Pennington,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10045"],["title","Dave Darrin's Second Year at Annapolis (#2)"],["body"," his head. \"I went into a drug store and asked a clerk that I know what was the best thing for toothache. He told me the best he knew was to smoke a pipe of opium, and told me where to find Chow Hop, and what to say to the chink. And it's all a lie about opium helping a sore tooth,\" cried the wretched midshipman, clapping a hand to his jaw, \"for there goes that fiendish tooth again! But say! You fellows are not going to leak about my little mishap?\"  \"No,\" replied Darrin with great promptness. \"You're going to do that yourself.\"  \"What?\" gasped Midshipman Pennington in intense astonishment. \"What are you talking about?\"  \"You'll be wise to turn in a report, on what happened,\" pursued Dave, \"for it's likely to reach official ears, anyway, and you'll be better off if you make the first report on the subject.\"  \"Why is it likely to reach official ears, if you fellows keep your mouths shut?\"  \"You see,\" Darrin went on very quietly, \"I reported the joint at the police station, and Chow Hop threatened that, if I did, he'd tell all he knew about everybody. So you'd better be first----\"  \"You broke the game out to the police!\" gasped Pennington, staring dumfoundedly at his comrade. \"What on earth----\"  \"I did it because I had more than one satisfactory reason for considering it my duty,\" interposed Dave, speaking quietly though firmly.  \"You--you--bag of wind!\" exploded Midshipman Pennington.  \"I'll accept your apology when you've had time to think it all over,\" replied Dave, with a smile, though there was a brief flash in his eyes.  \"I'll make no apology to you--at any time, you--you--greaser!\"  Marks for efficiency or good conduct, which increase a midshipman's standing, are called \"grease-marks\" or \"grease\" in midshipman slang. Hence a midshipman who is accused of currying favor with his officers in order to win \"grease\" is contemptuously termed a \"greaser.\"  \"I don't want to talk with you any more, Mr. Darrin,\" Pennington went on bitterly, \"or walk with you, either. When I get over this toothache I'll call you out--you greaser!\"  Burning with indignation, Midshipman Pennington fell back to walk with Hallam.     CHAPTER II   DAVE'S PAP-SHEET ADVICE  When our party reached the landing a lively scene lay before them.  Fully a hundred midshipmen, belonging to the first, second and third classes, were waiting to be transported out to one or another of the great, gray battleships.  Several launches were darting back and forth over the water. The baggage of the midshipmen had already been taken aboard the battleships. Only the young men themselves were now awaited.  Near-by stood a lieutenant of the Navy, who was directing the embarkation of the midshipmen of the different classes.  Five minutes after our party arrived a launch from the \"Massachusetts\" lay in alongside the landing.  \"Third classmen, this way!\" shouted the lieutenant. \"How many of you?\"  Turning his eyes over the squad that had moved forward, the officer continued:  \"Twenty-two. You can all crowd into this launch. Move quickly, young gentlemen!\"  In another couple of minutes the puffing launch was steaming away to the massive battleship that lay out in the stream.  Dave stood well up in the bow. Once he barely overheard Pennington mutter to a comrade:  \"The rascally greaser!\"  \"That means me,\" Dave muttered under his breath. \"I won't take it up now, or in any hurry. I'll wait until Pen has had time to see things straight.\"  As soon as the launch lay alongside, the young midshipmen clambered nimbly up the side gangway, each raising his cap to the flag at the stern as he passed through the opening in the rail.  Here stood an officer with an open book in his hand. To him each midshipman reported, saluting, stated his name, and received his berthing.  \"Hurry away to find your berthings, and get acquainted with the location,\" ordered this officer. \"Every midshipman will report on the quarter-deck promptly at five p.m. In the meantime, after locating your berthings, you are at liberty to range over the ship, avoiding the ward room and the staterooms of officers.\"  The latest arrivals saluted. Then, under the guidance of messengers chosen from among the apprentice members of the crew, the young men located their berthings.  \"I'm going to get mine changed, if I can,\" growled Pennington, wheeling upon Dave Darrin. \"I'm much too close to a greaser. I'm afraid I may get my uniforms spotted, as well as my character.\"  \"Stop that, Pen!\" warned Dave, stationing himself squarely before the angry Pennington. \"I don't know just how far you're responsible for what you're saying now. To-morrow, if you make any such remarks to me, you'll have to pay a mighty big penalty for them.\"  \"You'll make me pay by going to the commandant and telling him all you know, I suppose?\" sneered Pennington.  \"You know better, Pen! Now, begin to practise keeping a civil tongue behind your teeth!\"  With that, Darrin turned on his heel, seeking the deck.  This left \"Pen\" to conjecture as to whether he should report his misadventure, and, if so, how best to go about it.  \"See here, Hallam,\" began the worried midshipman, \"I begin to feel that it will be safer to turn in some kind of report on myself.\"  \"Much safer,\" agreed Hallam. \"It will show good faith on your part if you report yourself.\"  \"And get me broken from the service, too, I suppose,\" growled the unhappy one.  \"I hardly think it will, if you report yourself first,\" urged Hallam. \"But you'll be about certain to get your walking papers if you wait for the first information to come from other sources.\"  \"Hang it,\" groaned Pennington, \"I wish I could think, but my head aches as though it would split and my tooth is putting up more trouble than I ever knew there was in the world. And, in this racked condition, I'm to go and put myself on the pap-sheet. In what way shall I do it, Hallam? Can't you suggest something?\"  \"Yes,\" retorted Hallam with great energy. \"Go to the medical officer and tell him how your tooth troubles you. Tell him what you tried on shore. I'll go with you, if you want.\"  \"Will you, old man? I'll be a thousand times obliged!\"  So the pair went off in search of the sick-bay, as the hospital part of a battleship is called. The surgeon was not in his office adjoining, but the hospital steward called him over one of the ship telephones, informing him that a midshipman was suffering with an ulcerated tooth.  Dr. Mackenzie came at once, turned on a reflector light, and gazed into Midshipman Pennington's mouth.  \"Have you tried to treat this tooth yourself, in any way?\" queried the ship's surgeon.  \"Yes, sir; I was so crazy with the pain, while in Annapolis, that I am afraid I did something that will get me into trouble,\" replied Pennington, with a quiver in his voice.  \"What was that?\" asked Dr. Mackenzie, glancing at him sharply. \"Did you try the aid of liquor?\"  \"Worse, I'm afraid, sir.\"  \"Worse?\"  Pennington told of his experience with the opium pipe.  \"That's no good whatever for a toothache, sir,\" growled Dr. Mackenzie. \"Besides, it's a serious breach of discipline. I shall have to report you, Mr. Pennington.\"  \"I expected it, sir,\" replied Pennington meekly.  \"However, the report won't cure your toothache,\" continued Dr. Mackenzie in a milder tone. \"We'll attend to that first.\"  The surgeon busied himself with dissolving a drug in a small quantity of water. This he took up in a hypodermic needle and injected into the lower jaw.  \"The ache ought to stop in ten minutes, sir,\" continued the surgeon, turning to enter some memoranda in his record book.  After that the surgeon called up the ship's commander over the 'phone, and made known Pennington's report.  \"Mr. Pennington, Captain Scott directs that you report at his office immediately,\" said the surgeon, as he turned away from the telephone.  \"Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.\"  Both midshipmen saluted, then left the sick-bay.  \"This is where you have to go up alone, I guess,\" hinted Midshipman Hallam.  \"I'm afraid so,\" sighed Pennington.  \"However, I'll be on the quarter-deck, and, if I'm wanted, you can send there for me.\"  \"Thank you, old man. You're worth a brigade of Darrins--confound the greasing meddler!\"  \"Darrin acted according to his best lights on the subject of duty,\" remonstrated Mr. Hallam mildly.  \"His best lights--bah!\" snarled Pennington. \"I'll take this all out of him before I'm through with him!\"  Pennington reported to the battleship's commander. After some ten minutes a marine orderly found Hallam and directed him to go to Captain Scott's office. Here Hallam repeated as much as was asked of him concerning the doings of the afternoon. Incidentally, the fact of Midshipman Darrin's report to the police was brought out.  \"Mr. Pennington, I shall send you at once, in a launch, over to the commandant of cadets to report this matter in person to him,\" said Captain Scott gravely. \"Mr. Hallam, you will go with Mr. Pennington.\"  Then, after the two had departed, an apprentice messenger went through the ship calling Dave's name. That young man was summoned to Captain Scott's office.  \"I am in possession of all the facts relating to the unfortunate affair of Midshipman Pennington, Mr. Darrin,\" began Captain Scott, after the interchange of salutes. \"Will you tell me why you reported the affair to the police?\"  \"I went to the police, sir,\" Dave replied, \"because I was aware that many members of the new fourth class are away from home for the first time in their lives. I was afraid, sir, that possibly some of the new midshipmen might, during one of their town-leaves, be tempted to try for a new experience.\"  \"A very excellent reason, Mr. Darrin, and I commend you heartily for it. I shall also report your exemplary conduct to the commandant of midshipmen. You have, in my opinion, Mr. Darrin, displayed very good judgment, and you acted upon that judgment with promptness and decision. But I am afraid,\" continued the Navy captain dryly, \"that you have done something that "]]]
