This method of introducing the characters is bad enough. But the new snoopopathic way of describing them is still worse. The Man is always detailed as if he were a horse. He is said to be \"tall, well set up, with straight legs.\"  Great stress is always laid on his straight legs. No magazine story is acceptable now unless The Man's legs are absolutely straight. Why this is, I don't know. All my friends have straight legs--and yet I never hear them make it a subject of comment or boasting. I don't believe I have, at present, a single friend with crooked legs.  But this is not the only requirement. Not only must The Man's legs be straight but he must be \"clean-limbed,\" whatever that is; and of course he must have a \"well-tubbed look about him.\" How this look is acquired, and whether it can be got with an ordinary bath and water are things on which I have no opinion.  The Man is of course \"clean-shaven.\" This allows him to do such necessary things as \"turning his clean-shaven face towards the speaker,\" \"laying his clean-shaven cheek in his hand,\" and so on. But every one is familiar with the face of the up-to-date clean-shaven snoopopathic man. There are pictures of him by the million on magazine covers and book jackets, looking into the eyes of The Woman--he does it from a distance of about six inches--with that snoopy earnest expression of brainlessness that he always wears. How one would enjoy seeing a man--a real one with Nevada whiskers and long boots--land him one solid kick from behind.  Then comes The Woman of the snoopopathic story. She is always \"beautifully groomed\" (who these grooms are that do it, and where they can be hired, I don't know), and she is said to be \"exquisitely gowned.\"  It is peculiar about The Woman that she never seems to wear a _dress_--always a \"gown.\" Why this is, I cannot tell. In the good old stories that I used to read, when I could still read for the pleasure of it, the heroines --that was what they used to be called--always wore dresses. But now there is no heroine, only a woman in a gown. I wear a gown myself--at night. It is made of flannel and reaches to my feet, and when I take my candle and go out to the balcony where I sleep, the effect of it on the whole is not bad. But as to its \"revealing every line of my figure\"--as The Woman's gown is always said to--and as to its \"suggesting even more than it reveals\"--well, it simply does _not_. So when I talk of \"gowns\" I speak of something that I know all about.  Yet, whatever The Woman does, her \"gown\" is said to \"cling\" to her. Whether in the street or in a _cabaret_ or in the drawing-room, it \"clings.\" If by any happy chance she throws a lace wrap about her, then it clings; and if she lifts her gown--as she is apt to--it shows, not what I should have expected, but a _jupon_, and even that clings. What a _jupon_ is I don't know. With my gown, I never wear one. These people I have described, The Man and The Woman--The Snoopopaths--are, of course, not husband and wife, or brother and sister, or anything so simple and old-fashioned as that. She is some one else's wife. She is _The Wife of the Other Man_. Just what there is, for the reader, about other men's wives, I don't understand. I know tons of them that I wouldn't walk round a block for. But the reading public goes wild over them. The old-fashioned heroine was unmarried. That spoiled the whole story. You could see the end from the beginning. But with Another Man's Wife, the way is blocked. Something has got to happen that would seem almost obvious to anyone.  The writer, therefore, at once puts the two snoopos--The Man and The Woman--into a frightfully indelicate position. The more indelicate it is, the better. Sometimes she gets into his motor by accident after the theatre, or they both engage the drawing-room of a Pullman car by mistake, or else, best of all, he is brought accidentally into her room at an hotel at night. There is something about an hotel room at night, apparently, which throws the modern reader into convulsions. It is always easy to arrange a scene of this sort. For example, taking the sample beginning that I gave above, The Man, whom I left sitting at the _cabaret_ table, above, rises unsteadily --it is the recognised way of rising in a _cabaret_--and, settling the reckoning with the waiter, staggers into the street. For myself I never do a reckoning with the waiter. I just pay the bill as he adds it, and take a chance on it.  As The Man staggers into the \"night air,\" the writer has time--just a little time, for the modern reader is impatient--to explain who he is and why he staggers. He is rich. That goes without saying. All clean-limbed men with straight legs are rich. He owns copper mines in Montana. All well-tubbed millionaires do. But he has left them, left everything, because of the Other Man's Wife. It was that or madness--or worse. He had told himself so a thousand times. (This little touch about \"worse\" is used in all the stories. I don't just understand what the \"worse\" means. But snoopopathic readers reach for it with great readiness.) So The Man had come to New York (the only place where stories are allowed to be laid) under an assumed name, to forget, to drive her from his mind. He had plunged into the mad round of--I never could find it myself, but it must be there, and as they all plunge into it, it must be as full of them as a sheet of Tanglefoot is of flies.  \"As The Man walked home to his hotel, the cool night air steadied him, but his brain is still filled with the fumes of the wine he had drunk.\" Notice these \"fumes.\" It must be great to float round with them in one's brain, where they apparently lodge. I have often tried to find them, but I never can. Again and again I have said, \"Waiter, bring me a Scotch whisky and soda with fumes.\" But I can never get them.  Thus goes The Man to his hotel. Now it is in a room in this same hotel that The Woman is sitting, and in which she has crumpled up the telegram. It is to this hotel that she has come when she left her husband, a week ago. The readers know, without even being told, that she left him \"to work out her own salvation\"--driven, by his cold brutality, beyond the breaking-point. And there is laid upon her soul, as she sits there with clenched hands, the dust and ashes of a broken marriage and a loveless life, and the knowledge, too late, of all that might have been.  And it is to this hotel that The Woman's Husband is following her.  But The Man does not know that she is in the hotel, nor that she has left her husband; it is only accident that brings them together. And it is only by accident that he has come into her room, at night, and stands there--rooted to the threshold. Now as a matter of fact, in real life, there is nothing at all in the simple fact of walking into the wrong room of an hotel by accident. You merely apologise and go out. I had this experience myself only a few days ago. I walked right into a lady's room--next door to my own. But I simply said, \"Oh, I beg your pardon, I thought this was No. 343.\"  \"No,\" she said, \"this is 341.\"  She did not rise and \"confront\" me, as they always do in the snoopopathic stories. Neither did her eyes flash, nor her gown cling to her as she rose. Nor was her gown made of \"rich old stuff.\" No, she merely went on reading her newspaper.  \"I must apologise,\" I said. \"I am a little short-sighted, and very often a _one_ and a _three_ look so alike that I can't tell them apart. I'm afraid--\"  \"Not at all,\" said the lady. \"Good evening.\"  \"You see,\" I added, \"this room and my own being so alike, and mine being 343 and this being 341, I walked in before I realised that instead of walking into 343 I was walking into 341.\"  She bowed in silence, without speaking, and I felt that it was now the part of exquisite tact to retire quietly without further explanation, or at least with only a few murmured words about the possibility of to-morrow being even colder than to-day. I did so, and the affair ended with complete _savoir faire_ on both sides.  But the Snoopopaths, Man and Woman, can't do this sort of thing, or, at any rate, the snoopopathic writer won't let them. The opportunity is too good to miss. As soon as The Man comes into The Woman's room--before he knows who she is, for she has her back to him--he gets into a condition dear to all snoopopathic readers.  His veins simply \"surged.\" His brain beat against his temples in mad pulsation. His breath \"came and went in quick, short pants.\" (This last might perhaps be done by one of the hotel bellboys, but otherwise it is hard to imagine.)  And The Woman--\"Noiseless as his step had been, she seemed to _sense_ his presence. A wave seemed to sweep over her --She turned and rose fronting him full.\" This doesn't mean that he was full when she fronted him. Her gown--but we know about that already. \"It was a coward's trick,\" she panted.  Now if The Man had had the kind of _savoir faire_ that I have, he would have said: \"Oh, pardon me! I see this room is 341. My own room is 343, and to me a _one_ and a _three_ often look so alike that I seem to have walked into 341 while looking for 343.\" And he could have explained in two words that he had no idea that she was in New York, was not following her, and not proposing to interfere with her in any way. And she would have explained also in two sentences why and how she came to be there. But this wouldn't do. Instead of it, The Man and The Woman go through the grand snoopopathic scene which is so intense that it needs what is really a new kind of language to convey it.  \"Helene,\" he croaked, reaching out his arms--his voice tensed with the infinity of his desire.  \"Back,\" she iced. And then, \"Why have you come here?\" she hoarsed. \"What business have you here?\"  \"None,\" he glooped, \"none. I have no business.\" They stood sensing "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11504"],["title","Further Foolishness (#2)"],["body","another.  \"I thought you were in Philadelphia,\" she said--her gown clinging to every fibre of her as she spoke.  \"I was,\" he wheezed.  \"And you left it?\" she sharped, her voice tense.  \"I left it,\" he said, his voice glumping as he spoke. \"Need I tell you why?\" He had come nearer to her. She could hear his pants as he moved.  \"No, no,\" she gurgled. \"You left it. It is enough. I can understand\"--she looked bravely up at him--\"I can understand any man leaving it.\"  Then as he moved still nearer her, there was the sound of a sudden swift step in the corridor. The door opened and there stood before them The Other Man, the Husband of The Woman--Edward Dangerfield.  This, of course, is the grand snoopopathic climax, when the author gets all three of them--The Man, The Woman, and The Woman's Husband--in an hotel room at night. But notice what happens.  He stood in the opening of the doorway looking at them, a slight smile upon his lips.  \"Well?\" he said. Then he entered the room and stood for a moment quietly looking into The Man's face.  \"So,\" he said, \"it was you.\" He walked into the room and laid the light coat that he had been carrying over his arm upon the table. He drew a cigar-case from his waistcoat pocket.  \"Try one of these Havanas,\" he said.  Observe the _calm_ of it. This is what the snoopopath loves--no rage, no blustering--calmness, cynicism. He walked over towards the mantelpiece and laid his hat upon it. He set his boot upon the fender.  \"It was cold this evening,\" he said. He walked over to the window and gazed a moment into the dark.  \"This is a nice hotel,\" he said. (This scene is what the author and the reader love; they hate to let it go. They'd willingly keep the man walking up and down for hours saying \"Well!\")  The Man raised his head! \"Yes, it's a good hotel,\" he said. Then he let his head fall again.  This kind of thing goes on until, if possible, the reader is persuaded into thinking that there is nothing going to happen. Then:  \"He turned to The Woman. 'Go in there,' he said, pointing to the bedroom door. Mechanically she obeyed.\" This, by the way, is the first intimation that the reader has that the room in which they were sitting was not a bedroom. The two men were alone. Dangerfield walked over to the chair where he had thrown his coat.  \"I bought this coat in St. Louis last fall,\" he said. His voice was quiet, even passionless. Then from the pocket of the coat he took a revolver and laid it on the table. Marsden watched him without a word.  \"Do you see this pistol?\" said Dangerfield.  Marsden raised his head a moment and let it sink.  Of course the ignorant reader keeps wondering why he doesn't explain. But how can he? What is there to say? He has been found out of his own room at night. The penalty for this in all the snoopopathic stories is death. It is understood that in all the New York hotels the night porters shoot a certain number of men in the corridors every night.  \"When we married,\" said Dangerfield, glancing at the closed door as he spoke, \"I bought this and the mate to it--for her--just the same, with the monogram on the butt--see! And I said to her, 'If things ever go wrong between you and me, there is always this way out.'\"  He lifted the pistol from the table, examining its mechanism. He rose and walked across the room till he stood with his back against the door, the pistol in his hand, its barrel pointing straight at Marsden's heart. Marsden never moved. Then as the two men faced one another thus, looking into one another's eyes, their ears caught a sound from behind the closed door of the inner room--a sharp, hard, metallic sound as if some one in the room within had raised the hammer of a pistol--a jewelled pistol like the one in Dangerfield's hand.  And then--  A loud report, and with a cry, the cry of a woman, one shrill despairing cry--  Or no, hang it--I can't consent to end up a story in that fashion, with the dead woman prone across the bed, the smoking pistol, with a jewel on the hilt, still clasped in her hand--the red blood welling over the white laces of her gown--while the two men gaze down upon her cold face with horror in their eyes. Not a bit. Let's end it like this:  \"A shrill despairing cry--'Ed! Charlie! Come in here quick! Hurry! The steam coil has blown out a plug! You two boys quit talking and come in here, for heaven's sake, and fix it.'\" And, indeed, if the reader will look back he will see there is nothing in the dialogue to preclude it. He was misled, that's all. I merely said that Mrs. Dangerfield had left her husband a few days before. So she had--to do some shopping in New York. She thought it mean of him to follow her. And I never said that Mrs. Dangerfield had any connection whatever with The Woman with whom Marsden was in love. Not at all. He knew her, of course, because he came from Brick City. But she had thought he was in Philadelphia, and naturally she was surprised to see him back in New York. That's why she exclaimed \"Back!\" And as a matter of plain fact, you can't pick up a revolver without its pointing somewhere. No one said he meant to fire it.  In fact, if the reader will glance back at the dialogue--I know he has no time to, but if he does--he will see that, being something of a snoopopath himself, he has invented the whole story.     III. Foreign Fiction in Imported Instalments.  Serge the Superman: A Russian Novel  (Translated, with a hand pump, out of the original Russian)     SPECIAL EDITORIAL NOTE, OR, FIT OF CONVULSIONS INTO    WHICH AN EDITOR FALLS IN INTRODUCING THIS SORT OF    STORY TO HIS READERS. We need offer no apology to    our readers in presenting to them a Russian novel.    There is no doubt that the future in literature lies    with Russia. The names of Tolstoi, of Turgan-something,    and Dostoi-what-is-it are household words in America.    We may say with certainty that Serge the Superman is    the most distinctly Russian thing produced in years.    The Russian view of life is melancholy and fatalistic.    It is dark with the gloom of the great forests of the    Volga, and saddened with the infinite silence of the    Siberian plain. Hence the Russian speech, like the    Russian thought, is direct, terse and almost crude in    its elemental power. All this appears in Serge the    Superman. It is the directest, tersest, crudest thing    we have ever seen. We showed the manuscript to a friend    of ours, a critic, a man who has a greater Command of    the language of criticism than perhaps any two men in    New York to-day. He said at once, \"This is big. It is    a big thing, done by a big man, a man with big ideas,    writing at his very biggest. The whole thing has a    bigness about it that is--\" and here he paused and    thought a moment and added--\"big.\" After this he sat    back in his chair and said, \"big, big, big,\" till we    left him. We next showed the story to an English critic    and he said without hesitation, or with very little,    \"This is really not half bad.\" Last of all we read    the story ourselves and we rose after its perusal--itself    not an easy thing to do--and said, \"Wonderful but    terrible.\" All through our (free) lunch that day we    shuddered.   CHAPTER I  As a child. Serge lived with his father--Ivan Ivanovitch --and his mother--Katrina Katerinavitch. In the house, too were Nitska, the serving maid. Itch, the serving man, and Yump, the cook, his wife.  The house stood on the borders of a Russian town. It was in the heart of Russia. All about it was the great plain with the river running between low banks and over it the dull sky.  Across the plain ran the post road, naked and bare. In the distance one could see a moujik driving a three-horse tarantula, or perhaps Swill, the swine-herd, herding the swine. Far away the road dipped over the horizon and was lost.  \"Where does it go to?\" asked Serge. But no one could tell him.  In the winter there came the great snows and the river was frozen and Serge could walk on it.  On such days Yob, the postman, would come to the door, stamping his feet with the cold as he gave the letters to Itch.  \"It is a cold day,\" Yob would say.  \"It is God's will,\" said Itch. Then he would fetch a glass of Kwas steaming hot from the great stove, built of wood, that stood in the kitchen.  \"Drink, little brother,\" he would say to Yob, and Yob would answer, \"Little Uncle, I drink your health,\" and he would go down the road again, stamping his feet with the cold.  Then later the spring would come and all the plain was bright with flowers and Serge could pick them. Then the rain came and Serge could catch it in a cup. Then the summer came and the great heat and the storms, and Serge could watch the lightning.  \"What is lightning for?\" he would ask of Yump, the cook, as she stood kneading the _mush_, or dough, to make _slab_, or pancake, for the morrow. Yump shook her _knob_, or head, with a look of perplexity on her big _mugg_, or face.  \"It is God's will,\" she said.  Thus Serge grew up a thoughtful child.  At times he would say to his mother, \"Matrinska (little mother), why is the sky blue?\" And she couldn't tell him.  Or at times he would say to his father, \"Boob (Russian for father), what is three times six?\" But his father didn't know.  Each year Serge grew.  Life began to perplex the boy. He couldn't understand it. No one could tell him anything.  Sometimes he would talk with Itch, the serving man.  \"Itch,\" he asked, \"what is morality?\" But Itch didn't know. In his simple life he had never heard of it.  At times people came to the house--Snip, the schoolmaster, who could read and write, and Cinch, the harness maker, who made harness.  Once there came Popoff, the inspector of police, in his blue coat with fur on it. He stood in front of the fire writing down the names of all the people in the house. And when he came to Itch, Serge noticed how Itch trembled and cowered before Popoff, cringing as he brought a three-legged stool and saying, \"Sit"]]]
