Visioned the herd huddled together in the night while the heavens were split with lightning, and the rain came down in white-lighted streamers of water. Visioned the cattle humped in the snow, tails to the biting wind, and the riders plodding with muffled heads bent to the drive of the blizzard, the fine snow packing full the wrinkles in their sourdough coats.  It could be done. He, Luck Lindsay, could do it; in his heart he knew that he could. In his heart he felt that all of these months--yes, and years--of picture-making had been but a preparation for this great picture of the range. All these one-reel pioneer pictures had been merely the feeble efforts of an apprentice learning to handle the tools of his craft, the mental gropings of his mind while waiting for this, his big idea. His work with the Indians was the mere testing and trying of certain photographic effects, certain camera limitations. He felt like an athlete taught and trained and tempered and just stepping out now for the big physical achievement of his life.  He grew chilled as the night advanced, but he did not know that he was cold. He was wondering, as a man always wonders in the face of an intellectual birth, why this picture had not come to him before; why he had gone on through these months and years of turning out reel upon reel of Western pictures, with never once a glimmering of this great epic of the range land; why he had clung to his Indians and his one-reel Indian pictures with now and then a three-reel feature to give him the elation of having achieved something; why he had left them feeling depressedly that his best work was in the past; why he had looked upon real range-men as a substitute only for those lean-bodied bucks and those fat, stupid-eyed squaws and dirty papooses.  With the spell of his vision deep upon his soul, Luck sat humiliated before his blindness. The picture he saw as he stared out across the moonlit plain was so clean-cut, so vivid, that he marvelled because he had never seen it until this night. Perhaps, if the dried little man had not talked of the old range--  Luck took a long breath and flung his cigar out over the platform rail. The dried little man? Why, just as he stood he was a type! He was the Old Man who owned this herd that should trail north and on through scene after scene of the picture! No make-up needed there to stamp the sense of reality upon the screen. Luck looked with the eye of his imagination and saw the dried little man climbing, with a stiffness that could not hide his accustomedness, into the saddle. He saw him ride out with his men, scattering his riders for the round-up; the old cowman making sharper the contrast of the younger men, fixing indelibly upon the consciousness of those who watched that this same dried little man had grown old in the saddle; fixing indelibly the fact that not in a day did the free ranging of cattle grow to be one of the nation's great industries.  Of a sudden Luck got up and stood swaying easily to the motion of the car while he took a long, last look at the moon-bathed plain where had been born his great, beautiful picture. He stretched his arms as does one who has slept heavily, and went inside and down to the beginning of the narrow aisle where were kept telegraph forms in their wooden-barred niches in the wall. He went into the smoking compartment and wrote, with a sureness that knew no crossed-out words, a night letter to the dried little man who had sat on the baggage truck and talked of the range. And this is what went speeding back presently to the dried little man who slept in a cabin near the track and dreamed, perhaps, of following the big herds:   Baggage man, Sioux, N.D.  Report at once to me at Dry Lake. Can offer you good position Acme Film Company, good salary working in big Western picture. Small part, some riding among real boys who know range life. Want you bad as type of cowman owning cattle in picture. Salary and expenses begin when you show up. For references see Indian Agent.  LUCK LINDSAY, Dry Lake, Mont.   If you count, you will see that he ran eight words over the limit of the flat rate on night letters, but he would have over-run the limit by eighty words just as quickly if he had wanted to say so much. That was Luck's way. Be it a telegram, instructions to his company, or a quarrel with some one who crossed him, Luck said what he wanted to say--and paid the price without blinking.  I don't know what the dried little man thought when the operator handed him that message the next morning; but I can tell you in a few words what he did: He arrived in Dry Lake just two trains behind Luck.  Luck did not sleep that night. He lay in his berth with the shade pushed up as high as it would go, and stared out at the tamed plain, and perfected the details of his Big Picture. Into the spell of the range he wove a story of human love and human hate and danger and trouble. So it must be, to carry his message to the world who would look and marvel at what he would show them in the drama of silence. He had not named his picture yet. The name would come in its own good time, just as the picture had come when the time for its making was ripe.  The next day he did not talk with the men whose elbows he touched in the passing intimacy of travel; though Luck was a companionable soul who was much given to talking and to seeing his listeners grow to an audience,--an appreciative audience that laughed much while they listened and frowned upon interruption. Instead, he sat silent in his seat, since on this train there was no observation car, and he stared out of the window without seeing much of what passed before his eyes, and made notes now and then, and covered all the margins of his time-table with figures that had to do with film. Once, I know, he blackened his two front teeth with pencil tappings while he visualized a stampede and the probable amount of footage it would require, and debated whether it should be \"shot\" with two cameras or three to get scenes from different angles. A stampede it should be,--a real stampede of fear-frenzied range cattle in the mad flight of terror; not a bunch of galloping tame cows urged to foreground by shouting and rock-throwing from beyond the side lines of the scene. It would be hard to get, and it could not be rehearsed before the camera was turned on it. Luck decided that it should be shot from three angles, at least, and if he could manage it he would have a \"panoram\" of the whole thing from a height.  The porter came apologetically with his big whisk broom and told Luck that they would all presently be gazing at Dry Lake, or words which carried that meaning. So Luck permitted himself to be whisked from a half dollar while his thoughts were \"in the field\" with his camera men and company, shooting a real stampede from various angles and trying to manage so that the dust should not obscure the scene. After a rain--of course! Just after a soaking rain, he thought, while he gathered up his time-table and a magazine that held his precious figures, and followed the porter out to the vestibule while the train slowed.  It was in this mood that Luck descended to the Dry Lake depot platform and looked about him. He had no high expectation of finding here what he sought. He was simply making sure, before he left the country behind him, that he had not \"overlooked any bets.\" His mind was open to conviction even while it was prepared against disappointment; therefore his eyes were as clear of any prejudice as they were of any glamour. He saw things as they were.  On the side track, then, stood a string of cars loaded with wool, as his nose told him promptly. Farms there were none, but that was because the soil was yellow and pebbly and barren where it showed in great bald spots here and there; you would not expect to raise cabbages where a prairie dog had to forage far for a living. Behind the depot, the prairie humped a huge, broad shoulder of bluff wrinkled along the forward slope of it like the folds of a full fashioned skirt. There, too, the soil was bare,--clipped to the very grass roots by hundreds upon hundreds of hungry sheep whose wool, very likely, was crowding those cars upon the siding. Luck wasted neither glances nor thought upon the scene. Dry Lake was like many, many other outworn \"cow towns\" through which he had passed; changed without being bettered; all of the old life taken out of it in the process of its taming.  He threw his grip into the waiting, three-seated spring wagon that served as a hotel bus, climbed briskly after it, and glanced ahead to where he saw the age-blackened boards of the stockyards. Cattle--and then came the sheep. So runs the epitaph of the range, and it was written plainly across Dry Lake and its surroundings.  They went up a dusty trail and past the yawning wings of the stockyards where a bunch of sheep blatted now in the thirst of mid-afternoon. They stopped before the hotel where, in the old days, many a town-hungry puncher had set his horse upon its haunches that he might dismount in a style to match his eagerness. Luck climbed out and stood for a minute looking up and down the sandy street that slept in the sun and dreamed, it may be, of rich, unforgotten moments when the cow-punchers had come in off the range and stirred the sluggish town to a full, brief life with their rollicking. Across the street was Rusty Brown's place, with its narrow porch deserted of loafers and its windows blinking at the street with a blankness that belied the things they had looked upon in bygone times.  A less experienced man than Luck would have been convinced by now that here was no place to go seeking \"real boys.\" But Luck had been a range man himself before he took to making motion pictures; he knew range towns as he knew men,--which was very well indeed. He looked, as he stood there, not disgusted but mildly speculative.

THE MEADOW       Here when the cloudless April days begin,         And the quaint crows flock thicker day by day,     Filling the forests with a pleasant din,         And the soiled snow creeps secretly away,     Comes the small busy sparrow, primed with glee,         First preacher in the naked wilderness,         Piping an end to all the long distress     From every fence and every leafless tree.      Now with soft slight and viewless artifice         Winter's iron work is wondrously undone;     In all the little hollows cored with ice         The clear brown pools stand simmering in the sun,     Frail lucid worlds, upon whose tremulous floors         All day the wandering water-bugs at will,         Shy mariners whose oars are never still,     Voyage and dream about the heightening shores.      The bluebird, peeping from the gnarlèd thorn,         Prattles upon his frolic flute, or flings,     In bounding flight across the golden morn,         An azure gleam from off his splendid wings.     Here the slim-pinioned swallows sweep and pass         Down to the far-off river; the black crow         With wise and wary visage to and fro     Settles and stalks about the withered grass.      Here, when the murmurous May-day is half gone,         The watchful lark before my feet takes flight,     And wheeling to some lonelier field far on,         Drops with obstreperous cry; and here at night,     When the first star precedes the great red moon,         The shore-lark tinkles from the darkening field,         Somewhere, we know not, in the dusk concealed,     His little creakling and continuous tune.      Here, too, the robins, lusty as of old,         Hunt the waste grass for forage, or prolong     From every quarter of these fields the bold,         Blithe phrases of their never-finished song.     The white-throat's distant descant with slow stress         Note after note upon the noonday falls,         Filling the leisured air at intervals     With his own mood of piercing pensiveness.      How often from this windy upland perch,         Mine eyes have seen the forest break in bloom,     The rose-red maple and the golden birch,         The dusty yellow of the elms, the gloom     Of the tall poplar hung with tasseled black;         Ah, I have watched, till eye and ear and brain         Grew full of dreams as they, the moted plain,     The sun-steeped wood, the marsh-land at its back,      The valley where the river wheels and fills,         Yon city glimmering in its smoky shroud,     And out at the last misty rim the hills         Blue and far off and mounded like a cloud,     And here the noisy rutted road that goes         Down the slope yonder, flanked on either side         With the smooth-furrowed fields flung black and wide,     Patched with pale water sleeping in the rows.      So as I watched the crowded leaves expand,         The bloom break sheath, the summer's strength uprear,     In earth's great mother's heart already planned         The heaped and burgeoned plenty of the year,     Even as she from out her wintry cell         My spirit also sprang to life anew,         And day by day as the spring's bounty grew,     Its conquering joy possessed me like a spell.      In reverie by day and midnight dream         I sought these upland fields and walked apart,     Musing on Nature, till my thought did seem         To read the very secrets of her heart;     In mooded moments earnest and sublime         I stored the themes of many a future song,         Whose substance should be Nature's, clear and strong,     Bound in a casket of majestic rhyme.      Brave bud-like plans that never reached the fruit,         Like hers our mother's who with every hour,     Easily replenished from the sleepless root,         Covers her bosom with fresh bud and flower;     Yet I was happy as young lovers be,         Who in the season of their passion's birth         Deem that they have their utmost worship's worth,     If love be near them, just to hear and see.     IN MAY       Grief was my master yesternight;         To-morrow I may grieve again;         But now along the windy plain           The clouds have taken flight.      The sowers in the furrows go;         The lusty river brimmeth on;         The curtains from the hills are gone;           The leaves are out; and lo,      The silvery distance of the day,         The light horizons, and between         The glory of the perfect green,           The tumult of the May.      The bobolinks at noonday sing         More softly than the softest flute,         And lightlier than the lightest lute           Their fairy tambours ring.      The roads far off are towered with dust;         The cherry-blooms are swept and thinned;         In yonder swaying elms the wind           Is charging gust on gust.      But here there is no stir at all;         The ministers of sun and shadow         Horde all the perfumes of the meadow           Behind a grassy wall.      An infant rivulet wind-free         Adown the guarded hollow sets,         Over whose brink the violets           Are nodding peacefully.      From pool to pool it prattles by;         The flashing swallows dip and pass,         Above the tufted marish grass,           And here at rest am I.      I care not for the old distress,         Nor if to-morrow bid me moan;         To-day is mine, and I have known           An hour of blessedness.     LIFE AND NATURE       I passed through the gates of the city,       The streets were strange and still,     Through the doors of the open churches       The organs were moaning shrill.      Through the doors and the great high windows       I heard the murmur of prayer,     And the sound of their solemn singing       Streamed out on the sunlit air;      A sound of some great burden       That lay on the world's dark breast,     Of the old, and the sick, and the lonely,       And the weary that cried for rest.      I strayed through the midst of the city       Like one distracted or mad.     \"Oh, Life! Oh, Life!\" I kept saying,       And the very word seemed sad.      I passed through the gates of the city,       And I heard the small birds sing,     I laid me down in the meadows       Afar from the bell-ringing.      In the depth and the bloom of the meadows       I lay on the earth's quiet breast,     The poplar fanned me with shadows,       And the veery sang me to rest.      Blue, blue was the heaven above me,       And the earth green at my feet;     \"Oh, Life! Oh, Life!\" I kept saying,       And the very word seemed sweet.     WITH THE NIGHT       O doubts, dull passions, and base fears,       That harassed and oppressed the day,     Ye poor remorses and vain tears,       That shook this house of clay:      All heaven to the western bars       Is glittering with the darker dawn;     Here with the earth, the night, the stars,       Ye have no place: begone!     JUNE       Long, long ago, it seems, this summer morn         That pale-browed April passed with pensive tread         Through the frore woods, and from its frost-bound bed     Woke the arbutus with her silver horn;             And now May, too, is fled,     The flower-crowned month, the merry laughing May,         With rosy feet and fingers dewy wet,     Leaving the woods and all cool gardens gay         With tulips and the scented violet.      Gone are the wind-flower and the adder-tongue         And the sad drooping bellwort, and no more         The snowy trilliums crowd the forest's floor;     The purpling grasses are no longer young,             And summer's wide-set door     O'er the thronged hills and the broad panting earth         Lets in the torrent of the later bloom,     Haytime, and harvest, and the after mirth,         The slow soft rain, the rushing thunder plume.      All day in garden alleys moist and dim,         The humid air is burdened with the rose;         In moss-deep woods the creamy orchid blows;     And now the vesper-sparrows' pealing hymn             From every orchard close     At eve comes flooding rich and silvery;         The daisies in great meadows swing and shine;     And with the wind a sound as of the sea         Roars in the maples and the topmost pine.      High in the hills the solitary thrush         Tunes magically his music of fine dreams,         In briary dells, by boulder-broken streams;     And wide and far on nebulous fields aflush             The mellow morning gleams.     The orange cone-flowers purple-bossed are there,         The meadow's bold-eyed gypsies deep of hue,     And slender hawkweed tall and softly fair,         And rosy tops of fleabane veiled with dew.      So with thronged voices and unhasting flight         The fervid hours with long return go by;         The far-heard hylas piping shrill and high     Tell the slow moments of the solemn night             With unremitting cry;     Lustrous and large out of the gathering drouth         The planets gleam; the baleful Scorpion     Trails his dim fires along the droused south;         The silent world-incrusted round moves on.      And all the dim night long the moon's white beams         Nestle deep down in every brooding tree,       "]]]
