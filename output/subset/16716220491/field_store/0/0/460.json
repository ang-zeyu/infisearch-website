It may be better if they be not too clever.\"  \"It--it is that which I fear, Don Luis,\" replied the secretary, in a still lower voice.  \"I have been studying their faces--especially their eyes as they spoke.  Don Luis, I much fear that they are very clever young men.\"  \"Ah!  Then again that is not bad,\" laughed the master gayly. \"If they be clever, then they will not need so much explanation.\"  Now the secretary became bolder.  \"Don Luis, though you have spent many years in the United States, I fear you do not at all understand some traits of the Gringo character,\" warned Dr. Tisco.  \"For example, you want these young men for a special service, and you are willing to pay them generously--lavishly in fact.  Has it escaped you, Don Luis, that some of these obstinate, mule-headed Gringos are guilty of an especial form of ingratitude which they term honor?\"  \"I know that some Gringos make much bombastic use of that term, while other Gringos scoff at the word 'honor,'\" replied the mine owner, thoughtfully.  \"But even suppose that these Gringos have absurdly fanciful ideas of honor?  They will never guess for what I really want them.  Their work will be done, to my liking, and they will go away from here with never a suspicion of the kind of service they have performed for me.\"  \"Pardon me, Don Luis,\" murmured Dr. Tisco, \"but to me they do not look like such fools.  They will suspect; they will even know.\"  \"It matters little what they suspect, if they hold their tongues,\" replied the mine owner.  \"You will have to appeal to their love of money, then,\" suggested the secretary.  \"You will have to pay them extremely well.  Even then they may balk and refuse.\"  \"Refuse?\" repeated Don Luis opening his eyes wide.  \"Carlos, you do not seem to understand how hopeless it would be for them to refuse.  I am master here.  None knows better than you that I hold life and death in my hand in these mountains.  Do not all men hereabouts obey my orders?  Will _el gobernador_ ask any awkward questions if two Gringos should stroll through these mountains and never be heard from again?  Who can escape the net that I am able to spread in these mountains?  The Gringos refuse me--betray me?  Are they such fools as to refuse me when they find that I hold their lives in the palm of my hand?\"  \"They may even refuse your bait with death as the alternative,\" persisted the secretary.  \"Don Luis, you know that there are such foolish men among the Gringos.\"  \"Then let them refuse me,\" proposed Don Luis, jestingly, though his white teeth shone in a savage smile.  \"If they are difficult to manage--these two young Gringos--then they will quickly disappear, and other Gringos shall come until I find those that will serve me and be grateful for their rewards.\"  \"I wish you good fortune with your great schemes, Don Luis,\" sighed young Dr. Tisco.  \"Carlos, you have not eaten for hours.  You are so famished that the whole world is colored blue before your eyes.  Come, it is close to the hour for the meal.  You shall meet and talk with my Gringos. You will then be able to judge whether I shall be able to tame them.\"     CHAPTER II  THE WOLF WHO SHOWED HIS TEETH   A rare host at table was Don Luis Montez.  He possessed the manner, even if not the soul, of a great nobleman.  His daughter, Francesca, reputed to be a beauty, did not appear at table.  So far the young engineers had not met her.  They would be presented, however, within a day or two, after the Mexican custom, for Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton were to be guests in the white palace during their residence in this part of Mexico.  Dr. Tisco, too, tried to be most entertaining, and succeeded.  \"You are the surgeon at the mine?\" Harry ventured.  \"A _medico_?\" suggested Dr. Tisco, with a bow of humility.  \"Ah, no, senor, I have not that honor.  I am a doctor of philosophy, not of medicine.\"  \"Then you may be a scientific expert,\" Harry hazarded.  \"You are the expert here at the mine?\"  \"Not so,\" broke in Don Luis, gently.  \"It is true that Carlos has some knowledge of chemistry, but he is not a mining expert.  He is my secretary, my man of affairs.\"  \"Oh, really the manager of the mine, then?\" pursued Harry.  \"Pardon me if I ask too many questions.  I do not mean to be impertinent. But, as we are going to work here I wish to know who's who is Senor Montez' representative.\"  \"Carlos,\" broke in Don Luis, again, \"is rather more than the mine manager.  He serves me in a variety of interests, and the mine is only one of them.\"  \"If you wish to know whether you are to be under my instructions,\" Dr. Tisco continued, \"I can assure you that you are not.  I seldom give orders except as the direct--I might say the directed--mouthpiece of Don Luis.\"  \"I have a separate manager at the mine,\" added Don Luis.  \"You shall meet him to-morrow.  His name is Pedro Gato.  You will find him a self-opinionated fellow, and one used to having his own way.  He has to be somewhat turbulent, or he would never hold some of my _peons_ (laborers) in check.  But under the surface you will find Pedro Gato an excellent fellow if you do not rub him too hard the wrong way.\"  \"Gato will not attempt to give us any orders, of course?\"  Tom asked very quietly.  \"Possibly not,\" dubiously replied Don Luis.  \"I really do not know.  That point has not before come up to me for consideration.\"  \"Then I hope you will make it clear to Senor Gato, Don Luis, that we are engineers, wholly in charge of our own work; that we have been engaged as experts and that we manage our own work in the way that appears to us best to serve our employer's interests.\"  \"That can all be arranged very amicably, I am certain,\" replied Don Luis, as though to dismiss the matter for the present.  Dr. Tisco, covertly, was intently watching the eyes and faces of the young engineers.  The secretary was most anxious to take an accurate measure of these two young Americans, who were now highly \\ important to his plans.  After the evening meal, Don Luis summoned a number of his home retainers, who played mandolins and guitars.  Some of them sang with considerable sweetness and power.  The full moon, soon to wane, shed lustrous light over the tropical scene of beauty. It was a delightful evening.  Tom and Harry, when they retired, found themselves ready to sleep instantly.  Their bedrooms opened into a common parlor.  Early in the morning they were astir.  \"What shall we wear, Tom?\" inquired Hazelton, going toward his trunks.  \"Eh?\"  \"I wonder what people wear in Mexico,\" Harry continued.  \"I don't want to make any mistake in my clothing.\"  \"The best clothing for engineers about to go down into a mine will be top-boots, khaki trousers and flannel shirts.\"  \"But will that be suitable to go to breakfast in?\" Harry asked. \"Will it be showing sufficient courtesy to our host?  And suppose the daughter should be at table?\"  \"That's so,\" Reade nodded.  \"I am sorry that we didn't fish for points last evening.\"  A knock came at the door.  \"Aqui!\" (here) Tom answered.  The door opened slowly.  A man servant of perhaps twenty-five years, attired in clean white clothes, but bare-footed, stood in the doorway, bowing very low.  \"_Buenos dias_, _caballeros_!\" (good morning, gentlemen) was his greeting.  Tom invited him to enter.  \"_Caballeros_,\" announced the _peon_, \"I am your servant, your slave, your dog!  My name is Nicolas.\"  \"How do you do, Nicolas,\" responded Tom, holding out his hand, which the Mexican appeared too dazed, or too respectful to take. \"We may find a servant useful.  But we never kept slaves, and we wouldn't dream of calling any man a dog.\"  \"I am your dog, _caballeros_,\" Nicolas asserted.  \"I am yours to do with as you wish.  Beat me, if I do not perform my work well.\"  \"But I wouldn't beat a dog.  Almost any dog is too fine a fellow to be served in that fashion,\" Tom explained.  \"_Caballeros_, I am here to receive your pleasure and commands concerning breakfast.\"  \"Is it ready?\" demanded Harry hopefully.  \"The kitchen is open, and the cooks there,\" Nicolas responded. \"When your excellency's orders have been given the cooks will prepare your meal with great dispatch.\"  \"Has Don Luis come down yet?\" Tom inquired.  \"No; for his great excellency has not yet eaten,\" answered the _peon_.  \"Oh!  Then your master eats in his own room?\" Tom asked.  \"Don Luis eats always his breakfast in bed,\" Nicolas told them.  \"Then I guess we were too fresh, Tom, in getting up,\" laughed Harry.  As this was spoken in English, Nicolas, not understanding, paid no heed.  Tom and Harry, on the other hand, had a conversational smattering of Spanish, for in Arizona they had had a large force of Mexican laborers working under them.  \"Nicolas, my good boy,\" Tom went on, \"we are quite new to the ways of Mexico.  We shall have to ask you to explain some matters to us.\"  \"I am a dog,\" said Nicolas, gravely, \"but even a dog may speak according to his knowledge.\"  \"Then of what does the breakfast here usually consist?\"  \"Of anything in Don Luis's larder,\" replied the _peon_ grandly.  \"Yet surely there must be some rule about the meal.\"  \"The only rule, excellency, is the pleasure of the host.\"  \"What does Don Luis, then, usually order?\"  \"Chocolate,\" replied the servant.  \"Nothing else?\"  \"And a roll or two, excellency.\"  \"What does he eat after that?\" Harry demanded, rather anxiously.  \"Nothing, _caballero_, until the next meal.\"  \"Chocolate and a roll or two,\" muttered Harry.  \"I am afraid that wouldn't hold me through a day's work.  Not even a forenoon's toil.  I never did like to diet on a plan of tightening my belt.\"  \"Anything for which the _caballero_ will ask shall be brought,\" replied Nicolas, with another bow.  \"How about a steak, Tom?\" Harry asked, turning to his chum.  \"Pardon, excellency, but we have no such thing here,\" Nicolas interposed, meekly.  \"Eggs?\" Harry guessed.  \"Exce"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1278"],["title","Penelope's English Experiences (#1)"],["body","tious; we are too glad to get rid of the bill. If our united thirds make four or five shillings in excess, we divide them equally; if it comes the other way about, we make it up in the same manner; always meeting the sneers of masculine critics with Dr. Holmes's remark that a faculty for numbers is a sort of detached-lever arrangement that can be put into a mighty poor watch.    Chapter II. The powdered footman smiles.    Salemina is so English! I can't think how she manages. She had not been an hour on British soil before she asked a servant to fetch in some coals and mend the fire; she followed this Anglicism by a request for a grilled chop, 'a grilled, chump chop, waiter, please,' and so on from triumph to triumph. She now discourses of methylated spirits as if she had never in her life heard of alcohol, and all the English equivalents for Americanisms are ready for use on the tip of her tongue. She says 'conserv't'ry' and 'observ't'ry'; she calls the chambermaid 'Mairy,' which is infinitely softer, to be sure, than the American 'Mary,' with its over-long a; she ejaculates 'Quite so!' in all the pauses of conversation, and talks of smoke-rooms, and camisoles, and luggage-vans, and slip-bodies, and trams, and mangling, and goffering. She also eats jam for breakfast as if she had been reared on it, when every one knows that the average American has to contract the jam habit by patient and continuous practice.  This instantaneous assimilation of English customs does not seem to be affectation on Salemina's part; nor will I wrong her by fancying that she went through a course of training before she left Boston. From the moment she landed you could see that her foot was on her native heath. She inhaled the fog with a sense of intoxication that the east winds of New England had never given her, and a great throb of patriotism swelled in her breast when she first met the Princess of Wales in Hyde Park.  As for me, I get on charmingly with the English nobility and sufficiently well with the gentry, but the upper servants strike terror to my soul. There is something awe-inspiring to me about an English butler. If they would only put him in livery, or make him wear a silver badge; anything, in short, to temper his pride and prevent one from mistaking him for the master of the house or the bishop within his gates. When I call upon Lady DeWolfe, I say to myself impressively, as I go up the steps: 'You are as good as a butler, as well born and well bred as a butler, even more intelligent than a butler. Now, simply because he has an unapproachable haughtiness of demeanour, which you can respectfully admire, but can never hope to imitate, do not cower beneath the polar light of his eye; assert yourself; be a woman; be an American citizen!' All in vain. The moment the door opens I ask for Lady DeWolfe in so timid a tone that I know Parker thinks me the parlour-maid's sister who has rung the visitors' bell by mistake. If my lady is within, I follow Parker to the drawing-room, my knees shaking under me at the prospect of committing some solecism in his sight. Lady DeWolfe's husband has been noble only four months, and Parker of course knows it, and perhaps affects even greater hauteur to divert the attention of the vulgar commoner from the newness of the title.  Dawson, our butler at Smith's private hotel, wields the same blighting influence on our spirits, accustomed to the soft solicitations of the negro waiter or the comfortable indifference of the free-born American. We never indulge in ordinary democratic or frivolous conversation when Dawson is serving us at dinner. We 'talk up' to him so far as we are able, and before we utter any remark we inquire mentally whether he is likely to think it good form. Accordingly, I maintain throughout dinner a lofty height of aristocratic elegance that impresses even the impassive Dawson, towards whom it is solely directed. To the amazement and amusement of Salemina (who always takes my cheerful inanities at their face value), I give an hypothetical account of my afternoon engagements, interlarding it so thickly with countesses and marchionesses and lords and honourables that though Dawson has passed soup to duchesses, and scarcely ever handed a plate to anything less than a baroness, he dilutes the customary scorn of his glance, and makes it two parts condescending approval as it rests on me, Penelope Hamilton, of the great American working class (unlimited).  Apropos of the servants, it seems to me that the British footman has relaxed a trifle since we were last here; or is it possible that he reaches the height of his immobility at the height of the London season, and as it declines does he decline and become flesh? At all events, I have twice seen a footman change his weight from one leg to the other, as he stood at a shop entrance with his lady's mantle over his arm; twice have I seen one stroke his chin, and several times have I observed others, during the month of July, conduct themselves in many respects like animate objects with vital organs. Lest this incendiary statement be challenged, levelled as it is at an institution whose stability and order are but feebly represented by the eternal march of the stars in their courses, I hasten to explain that in none of these cases cited was it a powdered footman who (to use a Delsartean expression) withdrew will from his body and devitalised it before the public eye. I have observed that the powdered personage has much greater control over his muscles than the ordinary footman with human hair, and is infinitely his superior in rigidity. Dawson tells me confidentially that if a footman smiles there is little chance of his rising in the world. He says a sense of humour is absolutely fatal in that calling, and that he has discharged many a good footman because of an intelligent and expressive face.  I tremble to think of what the powdered footman may become when he unbends in the bosom of the family. When, in the privacy of his own apartments, the powder is washed off, the canary-seed pads removed from his aristocratic calves, and his scarlet and buff magnificence exchanged for a simple neglige, I should think he might be guilty of almost any indiscretion or violence. I for one would never consent to be the wife and children of a powdered footman, and receive him in his moments of reaction.    Chapter III. Eggs a la coque.    Is it to my credit, or to my eternal dishonour that I once made a powdered footman smile, and that, too, when he was handing a buttered muffin to an earl's daughter?  It was while we were paying a visit at Marjorimallow Hall, Sir Owen and Lady Marjorimallow's place in Surrey. This was to be our first appearance in an English country house, and we made elaborate preparations. Only our freshest toilettes were packed, and these were arranged in our trunks with the sole view of impressing the lady's-maid who should unpack them. We each purchased dressing-cases and new fittings, Francesca's being of sterling silver, Salemina's of triple plate, and mine of celluloid, as befitted our several fortunes. Salemina read up on English politics; Francesca practised a new way of dressing her hair; and I made up a portfolio of sketches. We counted, therefore, on representing American letters, beauty, and art to that portion of the great English public staying at Marjorimallow Hall. (I must interject a parenthesis here to the effect that matters did not move precisely as we expected; for at table, where most of our time was passed, Francesca had for a neighbour a scientist, who asked her plump whether the religion of the American Indian was or was not a pure theism; Salemina's partner objected to the word 'politics' in the mouth of a woman; while my attendant squire adored a good bright-coloured chromo. But this is anticipating.)  Three days before our departure, I remarked at the breakfast-table, Dawson being absent: “My dear girls, you are aware that we have ordered fried eggs, scrambled eggs, buttered eggs, and poached eggs ever since we came to Dovermarle Street, simply because we do not know how to eat boiled eggs prettily from the shell, English fashion, and cannot break them into a cup or a glass, American fashion, on account of the effect upon Dawson. Now there will certainly be boiled eggs at Marjorimallow Hall, and we cannot refuse them morning after morning; it will be cowardly (which is unpleasant), and it will be remarked (which is worse). Eating them minced in an egg-cup, in a baronial hall, with the remains of a drawbridge in the grounds, is equally impossible; if we do that, Lady Marjorimallow will be having our luggage examined, to see if we carry wigwams and war-whoops about with us. No, it is clearly necessary that we master the gentle art of eating eggs tidily and daintily from the shell. I have seen English women--very dull ones, too--do it without apparent effort; I have even seen an English infant do it, and that without soiling her apron, or, as Salemina would say, 'messing her pinafore.' I propose, therefore, that we order soft-boiled eggs daily; that we send Dawson from the room directly breakfast is served; and that then and there we have a class for opening eggs, lowest grade, object method. Any person who cuts the shell badly, or permits the egg to leak over the rim, or allows yellow dabs on the plate, or upsets the cup, or stains her fingers, shall be fined 'tuppence' and locked into her bedroom for five minutes.”  The first morning we were all in the bedroom together, and, there being no blameless person to collect fines, the wildest civil disorder prevailed.  On the second day Salemina and I improved slightly, but Francesca had passed a sleepless night, and her hand trembled (the love-letter mail had come in from America). We were obliged to tell her, as we collected 'tuppence' twice on the same egg, that she must either remain at home, or take an oilcloth pinafore to Marjorimallow Hall.  But 'ease "]]]
