Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,   His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal.  Milton, _Paradise Lost_, v. 896, etc. (1665).  ABELARD and ELOISE, unhappy lovers, whose illicit love was succeeded by years of penitence and remorse. Abelard was the tutor of Heloise (or Eloise), and, although vowed to the church, won and returned her passion. They were violently separated by her uncle. Abelard entered a monastery and Eloise became a nun. Their love survived the passage of years, and they were buried together at _Père la Chaise.--Eloise and Abelard_. By Alexander Pope (1688-1744).  ABENSBERG (_Count_), the father of thirty-two children. When Heinrich II. made his progress through Germany, and other courtiers presented their offerings, the count brought forward his thirty-two children, \"as the most valuable offering he could make to his king and country.\"  ABES'SA, the impersonation of abbeys and convents in Spenser's _Faëry Queen_, i. 3. She is the paramour of Kirkrapine, who used to rob churches and poor-boxes, and bring his plunder to Abessa, daughter of Corceca (_Blindness of Heart_).  ABIGAIL, typical name of a maid.--See Beaumont and Fletcher, Swift, Fielding, and many modern writers.  ABNEY, called _Young Abney_, the friend of colonel Albert Lee, a royalist.--Sir W. Scott, _Woodstock_ (time, the Commonwealth).  ABON HASSAN, a young merchant of Bag dad, and hero of the tale called \"The Sleeper Awakened,\" in the _Arabian Nights' Entertainments_. While Abon Hassan is asleep he is conveyed to the palace of Haroun-al-Raschid, and the attendants are ordered to do everything they can to make him fancy himself the caliph. He subsequently becomes the caliph's chief favorite.  Shakespeare, in the induction of _Taming of the Shrew_, befouls \"Christopher Sly\" in a similar way, but Sly thinks it was \"nothing but a dream.\"  Philippe _le Bon_, duke of Burgundy, on his marriage with Eleonora, tried the same trick.--Burton, _Anatomy of Melancholy_, ii. 2,4.  ABOU BEN ADHEM, \"awakening one night from a deep dream of peace,\" sees an angel writing the names of those who love the Lord. Ben Adhem's name is registered as \"one who loves his fellow-men.\" A second vision shows his name at the head of the list.  _Abou Ben Adhem_. By Leigh Hunt (1784-1859).    ABRA, the most beloved of Solomon's concubines.   Fruits their odor lost and meats their taste,   If gentle Abra had not decked the feast;   Dishonored did the sparkling goblet stand,   Unless received from gentle Abra's hand; ...   Nor could my soul approve the music's tone   Till all was hushed, and Abra sang alone.  M. Prior, _Solomon_ (1664-1721).  AB'RADAS, the great Macedonian pirate.  Abradas, the great Macedonian pirate, thought every one had a letter of mart that bare sayles in the ocean.--Greene, _Penelope's Web_ (1601).  ABROC'OMAS, the lover of An'thia in the Greek romance of _Ephesi'aca_, by Xenophon of Ephesus (not the historian).  AB'SALOM, in Dryden's _Absalom and Achitophel_, is meant for the duke of Monmouth, natural son of Charles II. _(David)_. Like Absalom, the duke was handsome; like Absalom, he was beloved and rebellious; and like Absalom, his rebellion ended in his death (1649-1685).  AB'SOLON, a priggish parish clerk in Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_. His hair was curled, his shoes slashed, his hose red. He could let blood, cut hair, and shave, could dance, and play either on the ribible or the gittern. This gay spark paid his addresses to Mistress Alison, the young wife of John, a rich but aged carpenter: but Alison herself loved a poor scholar named Nicholas, a lodger in the house.--_The Miller's Tale_ (1388).  ABSOLUTE _(Sir Anthony)_, a testy but warm-hearted old gentleman, who imagines that he possesses a most angelic temper, and when he quarrels with his son, the captain, fancies it is the son who is out of temper, and not himself. Smollett's \"Matthew Bramble\" evidently suggested this character. William Dowton (1764-1851) was the best actor of this part.  _Captain Absolute_, son of sir Anthony, in love with Lydia Languish, the heiress, to whom he is known only as ensign Beverley. Bob Acres, his neighbor, is his rival, and sends a challenge to the unknown ensign; but when he finds that ensign Beverley is captain Absolute, he declines to fight, and resigns all further claim to the lady's hand.--Sheridan, _The Rivals_ (1775).  ABSYRTUS, brother of Medea and companion of her flight from Colchis. To elude or delay her pursuers, she cut him into pieces and strewed the fragments in the road, that her father might be detained by gathering up the remains of his son.  _Abu'dah_, in the drama called _The Siege of Damascus_, by John Hughes (1720), is the next in command to Caled in the Arabian army set down before Damascus. Though undoubtedly brave, he prefers peace to war; and when, at the death of Caled, he succeeds to the chief command, he makes peace with the Syrians on honorable terms.  ABU'DAH, in the _Tales of the Genii_, by H. Ridley, is a wealthy merchant of Bag dad, who goes in quest of the talisman of Oroma'nes, which he is driven to seek by a little old hag, who haunts him every night and makes his life wretched. He finds at last that the talisman which is to free him of this hag [_conscience_] is to \"fear God and keep his commandments.\"  ACADE'MUS, an Attic hero, whose garden was selected by Plato for the place of his lectures. Hence his disciples were called the \"Academic sect.\"  The green retreats of Academus. Akenside, _Pleasures of Imagination_, i (1721-1770).  ACAS'TO (_Lord_), father of Seri'no, Casta'lio, and Polydore; and guardian of Monimia \"the orphan.\" He lived to see the death of his sons and his ward. Polydore ran on his brother's sword, Castalio stabbed himself, and Monimia took poison.--Otway, _The Orphan_ (1680).  ACES'TES (3 _syl_.). In a trial of skill, Acestes, the Sicilian, discharged his arrow with such force that it took fire from the friction of the air.--_The Æneid_, Bk. V.    Like Acestes' shaft of old,   The swift thought kindles as it flies.  Longfellow, _To a Child_.  ACHATES [_A-ka'-teze_], called by Virgil \"fidus Achates.\" The name has become a synonym for a bosom friend, a crony, but is generally used laughingly.--_The Æneid_.    He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb.  Byron, _Don Juan_, i. 159.  ACHER'IA, the fox, went partnership with a bear in a bowl of: milk. Before the bear arrived, the fox skimmed off the cream and drank the milk; then, filling the bowl with mud, replaced the cream atop. Says the fox, \"Here is the bowl; one shall have the cream, and the other all the rest: choose, friend, which you like.\" The bear told the fox to take the cream, and thus bruin had only the mud.--_A Basque Tale_.  A similar tale occurs in Campbell's _Popular Tales of the West Highlands_ (iii. 98), called \"The Keg of Butter.\" The wolf chooses the _bottom_ when \"oats\" were the object of choice, and the _top_ when \"potatoes\" were the sowing.  Rabelais tells the same tale about a farmer and the devil. Each was to have on alternate years what grew _under_ and _over_ the soil. The farmer sowed turnips and carrots when the _under_-soil produce came to his lot, and barley or wheat when his turn was the _over_-soil produce.  ACHILLE GRANDISSIME, \"A rather poor specimen of the Grandissime type, deficient in stature, but not in stage manner.\"--_The Grandissimes_, by George W. Cable (1880).  ACHIL'LES (3 _syl_.), the hero of the allied Greek army in the siege of Troy, and king of the Myr'midons.--See _Dictionary of Phrase and Fable_.  _The English Achilles_, John Talbot, first earl of Shrewsbury (1373-1453).  The duke of Wellington is so called sometimes, and is represented by a statue of Achilles of gigantic size in Hyde Park, London, close to Apsley House (1769-1852).  _The Achilles of Germany_, Albert, elector of Brandenburg (1414-1486).  _Achilles of Rome_, Sicin'ius Denta'tus (put to death B.C. 450).  ACHIT'OPHEL, \"Him who drew Achitophel,\" Dryden, author of the famous political satire of _Absalom and Achitophel_. \"David\" is Charles II.; his rebellious son \"Absalom\" is the king's natural son, the handsome but rebellious James duke of Monmouth; and \"Achitophel,\" the traitorous counsellor, is the earl of Shaftesbury, \"for close designs and crooked counsels fit.\"    Can sneer at him who drew Achitophel.  Byron, _Don Juan_, iii. 100.  There is a portrait of the first earl of Shaftesbury (Dryden's \"Achitophel\") as lord chancellor of England, clad in ash-colored robes, because he had never been called to the bar.--E. Yates, _Celebrities_, xviii.  A'CIS, a Sicilian shepherd, loved by the nymph Galate'a. The monster Polypheme (3 _syl_.), a Cyclops, was his rival, and crushed him under a huge rock. The blood of Acis was changed into a river of the same name at the foot of mount Etna.  Not such a pipe, good reader, as that which Acis did sweetly tune in praise of his Galatea, but one of true Delft manufacture.--W. Irving (1783-1859).  ACK'LAND (_Sir Thomas_), a royalist.--Sir W. Scott, _Woodstock_ (time, the Commonwealth).  AC'OE (3 _syl_.), \"hearing,\" in the New Testament sense (_Rom_. x. 17), \"Faith cometh by hearing.\" The nurse of Fido [_faith_]. Her daughter is Meditation. (Greek,[Illustration], \"hearing.\")    With him [_Faith_] his nurse went, careful Acoë,   Whose hands first from his mother's womb   did take him,   And ever since have fostered tenderly.   Phin. Fletcher, _The Purple Island_, ix. (1633).  ACRAS'IA, Intemperance personified. Spenser says she is an enchantress living in the \"Bower of Bliss,\" in \"Wandering Island.\" She had the power of transforming her lovers into monstrous shapes; but sir Guyon (_temperance_), having caught her in a net and bound her, broke down her bower and burnt it to ashes.--_Faëry Queen_, ii. 12 (1590).  ACRA'TES (3 _syl_.), Incontinence personified in _The Purple Island_, by Phineas Fletcher. He had two sons (twins) by "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11431"],["title","Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 1 (#2)"],["body","Caro, viz., Methos (_drunkenness_) and Gluttony, both fully described in canto vii. (Greek, _akrates_, \"incontinent.\")  _Acra'tes_ (3 _syl_.), Incontinence personified in _The Faëry Queen_, by Spenser. He is the father of Cymoch'lês and Pyroch'lês.--Bk. ii. 4 (1590).  ACRES (_Bob_), a country gentleman, the rival of ensign Beverley, _alias_ captain Absolute, for the hand and heart of Lydia Languish, the heiress. He tries to ape the man of fashion, gets himself up as a loud swell, and uses \"sentimental oaths,\" _i. e_. oaths bearing on the subject. Thus if duels are spoken of he says, _ods triggers and flints_; if clothes, _ods frogs and tambours_; if music, _ods minnums_ [minims] _and crotchets_; if ladies, _ods blushes and blooms_. This he learnt from a militia officer, who told him the ancients swore by Jove, Bacchus, Mars, Venus, Minerva, etc., according to the sentiment. Bob Acres is a great blusterer, and talks big of his daring, but when put to the push \"his courage always oozed out of his fingers' ends.\" J. Quick was the original Bob Acres.--Sheridan, _The Rivals_ (1775).    As thro' his palms _Bob Acres_' valor oozed,   So Juan's virtue ebbed, I know not how.  Byron, _Don Juan_.  Joseph Jefferson's impersonation of Bob Acres is inimitable for fidelity to the spirit of the original, and informed throughout with exquisite humor that never degenerates into coarseness.  ACRIS'IUS, father of Dan'aê. An oracle declared that Danaê would give birth to a son who would kill him, so Acrisius kept his daughter shut up in an apartment under ground, or (as some say) in a brazen tower. Here she became the mother of Per'seus (2 _syl_.), by Jupiter in the form of a shower of gold. The king of Argos now ordered his daughter and her infant to be put into a chest, and cast adrift on the sea, but they were rescued by Dictys, a fisherman. When grown to manhood, Perseus accidentally struck the foot of Acrisius with a quoit, and the blow caused his death. This tale is told by Mr. Morris in _The Earthly Paradise_ (April).  ACTAE'ON, a hunter, changed by Diana into a stag. A synonym for a cuckold.    Divulge Page himself for a secure and wilful   Actæon [cuckold].  Shakespeare, _Merry Wives_, etc., act iii. sc. 2 (1596).  ACTE'A, a female slave faithful to Nero in his fall. It was this hetæra who wrapped the dead body in cerements, and saw it decently interred.    This Actea was beautiful. She was seated on   the ground; the head of Nero was on her lap,   his naked body was stretched on those winding-sheets   in which she was about to fold him, to lay   him in his grave upon the garden hill.--Ouida,   _Ariadnê_, i. 7.  ACTORS AND ACTRESSES. The last male actor that took a woman's character on the stage was Edward Kynaston, noted for his beauty (1619-1687). The first female actor for hire was Mrs. Saunderson, afterwards Mrs. Betterton, who died in 1712.  AD, AD'ITES (2 _syl_.). Ad is a tribe descended from Ad, son of Uz, son of Irem, son of Shem, son of Noah. The tribe, at the Confusion of Babel, went and settled on Al-Ahkâf [_the Winding Sands_], in the province of Hadramant. Shedâd was their first king, but in consequence of his pride, both he and all the tribe perished, either from drought or the Sarsar (_an icy wind_).--Sale's _Koran_, 1.    Woe, woe, to Irem! Woe to Ad!   Death, has gone up into her palaces!....   They fell around me. Thousands fell around.   The king and all his people fell;   All, all, they perished all.    Southey, _Thalaba the Destroyer_, i. 41, 45 (1797).  A'DAH, wife of Cain. After Cain had been conducted by Lucifer through the realms of space, he is restored to the home of his wife and child, where all is beauty, gentleness, and love. Full of faith and fervent in gratitude, Adah loves her infant with a sublime maternal affection. She sees him sleeping, and says to Cain--    How lovely he appears! His little cheeks   In their pure incarnation, vying with   The rose leaves strewn beneath them.   And his lips, too,   How beautifully parted! No; you shall not   Kiss him; at least not now. He will awake soon--   His hour of midday rest is nearly over.    Byron, _Cain_.  ADAM. In _Greek_ this word is compounded of the four initial letters of the cardinal quarters:    Arktos, [Greek: _arktos_]. north.   Dusis, [Greek: _dusis_]. west.   Anatolê, [Greek: _anatolae_]. east.   Mesembria, [Greek: _mesaembria_]. south.  The _Hebrew_ word ADM forms the anagram of A [dam], D [avid], M [essiah].  _Adam, how made_. God created the body of Adam of _Salzal_, _i.e._ dry, unbaked clay, and left it forty nights without a soul. The clay was collected by Azrael from the four quarters of the earth, and God, to show His approval of Azrael's choice, constituted him the angel of death.--Rabadan.  _Adam, Eve, and the Serpent_. After the fall _Adam_ was placed on mount Vassem in the east; _Eve_ was banished to Djidda (now Gedda, on the Arabian coast); and the _Serpent_ was exiled to the coast of Eblehh.  After the lapse of 100 years Adam rejoined Eve on mount Arafaith [_place of Remembrance_], near Mecca.--D'Ohsson.  _Death of Adam_. Adam died on Friday, April 7, at the age of 930 years. Michael swathed his body, and Gabriel discharged the funeral rites. The body was buried at Ghar'ul-Kenz [_the grotto of treasure_], which overlooks Mecca.  His descendants at death amounted to 40,000 souls.--D'Ohsson.  When Noah, entered the ark (the same writer says) he took the body of Adam in a coffin with him, and when he left the ark restored it to the place he had taken it from.  _Adam_, a bailiff, a jailer.  Not that Adam that kept the paradise, but that Adam that keeps the prison.--Shakespeare, _Comedy of Errors_, act iv. sc. 3 (1593).  _Adam_, a faithful retainer in the family of sir Eowland de Boys. At the age of fourscore, he voluntarily accompanied his young master Orlando into exile, and offered to give him his little savings. He has given birth to the phrase, \"A Faithful Adam\" [_or man-servant_].--Shakespeare, _As You Like It_ (1598).  ADAM BELL, a northern outlaw, noted for his archery. The name, like those of Clym of the Clough, William of Cloudesly, Robin Hood, and Little John, is synonymous with a good archer.  ADAMASTOR, the Spirit of the Cape, a hideous phantom, of unearthly pallor; \"erect his hair uprose of withered red, his lips were black, his teeth blue and disjointed, his beard haggard, his face scarred by lightning, his eyes shot livid fire, his voice roared.\" The sailors trembled at sight of him, and the fiend demanded how they dared to trespass \"where never hero braved his rage before?\" He then told them \"that every year the shipwrecked should be made to deplore their foolhardiness.\"--Camöens, _The Lusiad_, v. (1569).  ADAM'IDA, a planet on which reside the unborn spirits of saints, martyrs, and believers. U'riel, the angel of the sun, was ordered at the crucifixion to interpose this planet between the sun and the earth, so as to produce a total eclipse.  Adamida, in obedience to the divine command, flew amidst overwhelming storms, rushing clouds, falling mountains, and swelling seas. Uriel stood on the pole of the star, but so lost in deep contemplation on Golgotha, that he heard not the wild uproar. On coming to the region of the sun, Adamida slackened her course, and advancing before the sun, covered its face and intercepted all its rays.--Klopstock, _The Messiah_, viii. (1771).  ADAMS _(John)_, one of the mutineers of the _Bounty_ (1790), who settled in Tahiti. In 1814 he was discovered as the patriarch of a colony, brought up with a high sense of religion and strict regard to morals. In 1839 the colony was voluntarily placed under the protection of the British Government.  _Adams (Parson)_, the beau-ideal of a simple-minded, benevolent, but eccentric country clergyman, of unswerving integrity, solid learning, and genuine piety; bold as a lion in the cause of truth, but modest as a girl in all personal matters; wholly ignorant of the world, being \"_in_ it but not _of_ of it.\"--Fielding, _Joseph Andrews_ (1742).  His learning, his simplicity, his evangelical purity of mind are so admirably mingled with pedantry, absence of mind, and the habit of athletic ... exercise ... that he may be safely termed one of the richest productions of the muse of fiction. Like Don Quixote, parson Adams is beaten a little too much and too often, but the cudgel lights upon his shoulders ... without the slightest stain to his reputation.--Sir W. Scott.  AD'DISON OF THE NORTH, Henry Mackenzie, author of _The Man of Feeling_ (1745-1831).  ADELAIDE, daughter of the count of Narbonne, in love with Theodore. She is killed by her father in mistake for another.--Robt. Jephson, _Count of Narbonne_ (1782).  ADELAIDE FISHER, daughter-in-law of Grandpa and Grandma Fisher in Sallie Pratt McLean Greene's _Cape Cod Folks_. She has a sweet voice and an edged temper, and it would seem from certain cynical remarks of her own, and Grandma's \"Thar, daughter, I wouldn't mind!\" has a history she does not care to reveal (1881).  ADELAIDE YATES, the wife of Steve Yates and mother of Little Moses in Charles Egbert Craddock's _In the \"Stranger People's\" Country_. Her husband has been seized and detained by the \"moonshiners\" in the mountains, and the impression is that he has wilfully deserted her. She cannot discredit it, but \"She's goin' ter stay thar in her cabin an' wait fur him,\" said Mrs. Pettengill. \"Sorter seems de-stressin', I do declar'. A purty, young, good, r'ligious 'oman a-settin' herself ter spen' a empty life a-waitin' fur Steve Yates ter kum back!\" (1890.)  ADELINE _(Lady)_, the wife of lord Henry Amun'deville (4 _syl_.), a highly educated aristocratic lady, with all the virtues and weaknesses of the upper ten. After the parliamentary sessions this noble pair filled their house with guests, amongst which were the duchess of Fitz-Fulke, the duke of D----, Aurora Raby, and don Juan, \"the Russian envoy.\" The tale not being finished, no key to these "]]]
