In many offering chambers there is a small hole in the wall, either in the offering niche or in another place.  If this hole be properly lighted and the space beyond has not been changed by decay or violation, the light falls on the face of a statue of the dead looking forth to the world of the living.  For behind the wall is another chamber, closed except for this small hole.  This hidden chamber contains statues of the dead often accompanied by statues of his family and his servants.  These statues of the dead are labeled with his name, and are said to be the abode of his spirit, his _ka_, as the Egyptians called it.  Moreover, all the offering formulas named the _ka_ as the recipient of the food and drink.  The duplicate spirit of the man is his _ka_.  In these statues we have, then, a simulacrum of the man provided for use of his _ka_--perhaps to assist the _ka_ to the persistence of his earthly form, and to the remembrance of his name.  But what were the uses of the subsidiary statues?  What spirit resided in them?  The man's son in his turn died, and a similar room was made for him with his statue and his subsidiary statues.  Did his _ka_ live both in the statue placed with his father's statue and also in the statue in his own grave?  We have no answer.  Probably the Egyptian mind never formulated the difficulty.  But the new idea is clearly expressed.  It is no longer necessary to fill the burial chamber with a mass of household furniture for the use of the dead.  All these things can be carved on the wall of the burial chamber and so made effective for his use.  It was in any case necessary to supply his food by means of the offerings, and it was quite as easy to supply all his other necessities in the same way.  In other words, there is a distinct growth in the use of magic to benefit the dead.  At the same time, we find the growth of the custom of supplying a special abode for the _ka_--a simulacrum of the man, which assisted the _ka_ to retain the form of the living man and to remember his identity.  The tendency of this period is then to place a greater dependence on magic than on food, drink, and grave furniture.  It is, therefore, not surprising to find introduced, for the first time, the use of magical texts in the burial chamber,--the so-called Pyramid Texts.  In the burial chamber in the pyramid of Unas, last king of the Fifth Dynasty, and in the pyramids of the kings of the Sixth Dynasty, the walls are covered with long magical texts or chapters--the oldest form of the so-called book of the dead or \"book of the going forth by day.\" The texts were probably somewhat older, but are now used for the first time in this manner, no doubt owing to the increased facility in carving stone.  In these the various powers of the other world are invoked by the incidents of the Osiris-Isis legend, to preserve the dead body, to feed the _ka_, and to assist the other spirit, the _ba_, in its struggles with supernatural powers.  The pyramid texts introduce us to three important ideas,--(1) a curious plurality of the spirit existence, (2) a condition of immortality better than that of the old underworld or Earu, and (3) most important of all, the identification of the king with Osiris according to the terms of the Osiris-Isis legend.  In all the older offering formulas it is only the _ka_ spirit which is mentioned.  Here is the body perishable and destructible; here is the life, the _ka_ which fills every limb and vessel of the body and must, therefore, have the same form.  When death comes, the _ka_ spirit, the image of the man, remains near the body, and this spirit it was which was the object of the rites and offerings in the funerary chapel.  But besides this _ka_, it appears for the first time that the king at any rate possesses also a soul called a _ba_.  In later times we see that every man possessed a _ba_, and we learn that each god possessed several _ba's_.  But it is in the pyramid texts that we learn for the first time of the _ba_ of a man, and that man is a king.  When death comes, the _ba_ takes flight in the form of a bird or whatever form it wills.  All seems confused.  The _ka_ was near the body, the _ka_ was in the field of Earu, under the earth ploughing and sowing; the _ba_ is fluttering on the branches of the tree on earth, the _ba_ has fled like a falcon to the heavens, and has been set as a star among the stars.  The dead king lives with the gods and is fed by them.  The goddesses give him the breast.  He lives in the Island of Food.  He lives in Earu, the Underworld, a land like Egypt, with fields and canals and flood and harvest.  He shares with the gods in the offerings made in the great temples on earth.  It is quite clear that all this is an expression of dissatisfaction with the old belief in the simple duplicate world, the world of Earu under the earth.  It is noteworthy that this first appears in royal tombs.  These texts are written for kings alone.  It is only many centuries later that the texts of the book of the dead showed similar possibilities open to the common man.  This is the usual course of all advances in Egypt,-- architecture, sculpture, writing, whatever gain in skill or knowledge there is, appears first in the service of the royal family.  Thus, even in the conception of immortality, the new ideas, the better immortality was first thought out for the benefit of the king.  The basis for this lay simply in the life on earth.  The king had come early to have a sort of divinity ascribed to him.  His chief name was the Horus name.  Menes was the Horus Aha; Cheops was the Horus Mejeru; Pepy II was the Horus Netery-khau.  But he was also the son of Ra, the sun-god, endued with life forever.  The king was a god, and it could only be that in his future life he shared the life of the gods.  Thus, all is no more confused or mysterious than is the conception of the life of the gods themselves.  But the texts go even further than this and identify the dead god-man, who as Horus was king on earth, with the father of Horus, the dead god of the earth, Osiris.  This identification of the dead man with the dead god Osiris was later enlarged to include all men, and became in the Ptolemaic period the most characteristic feature of the Egyptian conception of life after death.  The Osiris story as it can be pieced together from the pyramid texts [See A. Erman: _Die Aegyptische Religion_, p. 38 ff.] was briefly thus: Keb, the earth-god, and Nut, the goddess of the sky, had four children,--Osiris and Isis, Seth and Nephthys,-- who were thus paired in marriage.  Keb gave Osiris his dominion, the earth, and made him the god of the earth, and he ruled justly and powerfully.  Seth, his brother, was jealous, and by treachery enticed Osiris into a box, which he closed and threw into the water.  Isis sought for the body of her husband until she found it, and Isis and Nephthys, her sister, sat at his head and feet and bewailed him.  Re, the greatest of the gods, heard Isis's complaint; his heart was touched, and he sent Anubis to bury Osiris.  Anubis re-joined his separated bones, bound him with cloths, and prepared him for burial,--that is, mummified him. This is the form in which Osiris is represented,--as a mummy. Isis then fanned her wings, and the air from her wings caused the mummy to live.  His life on earth, however, was over, could not be recalled, so that his new life could only be passed in the other world, the world of the dead.  Here Osiris became king, as he had been king on earth.  But Isis conceived from the dead-living Osiris, bore a child in secret, and suckled him, hidden in a swamp.  When the child, the sun-god Horus, grew up, he fought against Seth to recover his father's kingdom, and to avenge his death.  Both gods were injured in the fight.  Horus lost an eye. But Thoth intervened, separated the fighters, and healed their wounds.  Thoth spat upon the eye of Horus and it became whole. Horus, however, gave his eye to Osiris to eat, and thereby Osiris became endowed with life, soul, and power (i.e. in the underworld). But Seth disputed the legitimacy of the birth of Horus, and the great gods held a court in the house of Keb.  In this court, justice was done, the truth of Horus's claims was established, and he was placed on the throne of his father. Osiris became the ruler in the land of the dead, Horus in the land of the living.  The kernel of the story appears to be this: Osiris is the god of the earth, and his life is the life of the vegetation, dying and reviving with the course of the seasons, mourned by his wife Isis and succeeded by his son Horus, the sun-god.  It is apparently a form of the common Tammuz or Adonis story of the Semites.  This fact brings with it a suggestion which requires consideration.  The racial connection of the Egyptians may seem to have little to do with immortality.  But I beg a moment's consideration.  The two great dominating ideas of immortality are those held by the Christians and by the Mohammedans, and these are essentially the same idea.  Both these religions are creations of the Semitic race.  It is, therefore, decidedly of importance to find that the Egyptian race, the creator of a third great religion, has also a large Semitic strain.  In fact, the investigations of the last ten years appear to show that this Semitic strain it was which gave the Egyptian race its creative power and made possible the development of the Egyptian civilization.  The Egyptian language furnishes us with indisputable proof of the Semitic affinity, as Professor Adolf Erman showed years ago.  The anatomical examination by Professor Elliot Smith of a large number of skeletons, dated by careful excavations, has given us a further clue.  There is a prehistoric race found in the earliest cemeteries--neither Negroid nor Asiatic in characteristics.  In the late predynastic and the early dynastic periods, when the great "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12261"],["title","Balder the Beautiful, Volume I. (#1)"],["body","seem that the riven and blackened oaks must indeed be favourites of the sky-god, who so often descended on them from the murky cloud in a flash of lightning and a crash of thunder.  This change of view as to the great Aryan god necessarily affects my interpretation of the King of the Wood, the priest of Diana at Aricia, if I may take that discarded puppet out of the box again for a moment. On my theory the priest represented Jupiter in the flesh, and accordingly, if Jupiter was primarily a sky-god, his priest cannot have been a mere incarnation of the sacred oak, but must, like the deity whose commission he bore, have been invested in the imagination of his worshippers with the power of overcasting the heaven with clouds and eliciting storms of thunder and rain from the celestial vault. The attribution of weather-making powers to kings or priests is very common in primitive society, and is indeed one of the principal levers by which such personages raise themselves to a position of superiority above their fellows. There is therefore no improbability in the supposition that as a representative of Jupiter the priest of Diana enjoyed this reputation, though positive evidence of it appears to be lacking.  Lastly, in the present edition I have shewn some grounds for thinking that the Golden Bough itself, or in common parlance the mistletoe on the oak, was supposed to have dropped from the sky upon the tree in a flash of lightning and therefore to contain within itself the seed of celestial fire, a sort of smouldering thunderbolt. This view of the priest and of the bough which he guarded at the peril of his life has the advantage of accounting for the importance which the sanctuary at Nemi acquired and the treasure which it amassed through the offerings of the faithful; for the shrine would seem to have been to ancient what Loreto has been to modern Italy, a place of pilgrimage, where princes and nobles as well as commoners poured wealth into the coffers of Diana in her green recess among the Alban hills, just as in modern times kings and queens vied with each other in enriching the black Virgin who from her Holy House on the hillside at Loreto looks out on the blue Adriatic and the purple Apennines. Such pious prodigality becomes more intelligible if the greatest of the gods was indeed believed to dwell in human shape with his wife among the woods of Nemi.  These are the principal points on which I have altered my opinion since the last edition of my book was published. The mere admission of such changes may suffice to indicate the doubt and uncertainty which attend enquiries of this nature. The whole fabric of ancient mythology is so foreign to our modern ways of thought, and the evidence concerning it is for the most part so fragmentary, obscure, and conflicting that in our attempts to piece together and interpret it we can hardly hope to reach conclusions that will completely satisfy either ourselves or others. In this as in other branches of study it is the fate of theories to be washed away like children's castles of sand by the rising tide of knowledge, and I am not so presumptuous as to expect or desire for mine an exemption from the common lot. I hold them all very lightly and have used them chiefly as convenient pegs on which to hang my collections of facts. For I believe that, while theories are transitory, a record of facts has a permanent value, and that as a chronicle of ancient customs and beliefs my book may retain its utility when my theories are as obsolete as the customs and beliefs themselves deserve to be.  I cannot dismiss without some natural regret a task which has occupied and amused me at intervals for many years. But the regret is tempered by thankfulness and hope. I am thankful that I have been able to conclude at least one chapter of the work I projected a long time ago. I am hopeful that I may not now be taking a final leave of my indulgent readers, but that, as I am sensible of little abatement in my bodily strength and of none in my ardour for study, they will bear with me yet a while if I should attempt to entertain them with fresh subjects of laughter and tears drawn from the comedy and the tragedy of man's endless quest after happiness and truth.
