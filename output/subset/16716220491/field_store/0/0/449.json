Greg and Dan were at his heels, while Dave and Harry went around the other side of the cottage, Tom remaining well to the rear to watch.  Some low, vague sounds came from within the cottage. These were not such noises as scurrying rats would make, so the boys were quick to conclude that human beings were moving inside.  But what could possibly be going on? The noises that the Grammar School boys heard were hard to classify.  At last Dick and Dave met before the door of the little cottage. Nor were they much surprised at finding that the door of the cottage stood perhaps a half an inch ajar.  This, however, did not furnish light enough to give a glimpse of what was happening inside.  \"Two or three of us may as well slip inside, eh?\" whispered Dave to Dick.  \"Wait! Listen!\" counseled Prescott. \"We don't want to please that crowd by stepping right into a trap. And I've an idea that by this time they must know that we're around here.\"  \"If they knew, they'd be out here making faces at us,\" retorted Darrin wisely.  \"And ordering us to get off the earth,\" supplemented Greg, in a whisper.  \"Listen,\" whispered Dick. \"Perhaps we can guess what they're doing.\"  \"I can guess what they're doing,\" murmured Reade, who had now moved around to the front with his chums. \"I've been watching the smoke of that fire come up through the chimney. Humph! I don't believe Rip and Dodge are doing anything worse than a little camping. There must be a stove in there, and they're cooking some supper---playing at camping out.\"  \"I don't smell anything cooking in there,\" rejoined Dick with a shake of his head. \"We can't hear anything sizzling over the fire, either.\"  \"Then what-----\" began Harry curiously.  Bang! interrupted a crashing explosion inside the building. Boom! Then the door flew wide open, followed by a single great belching of white smoke.  Through the center of this cloud was hurled a human figure. A man struck the ground and lay there, senseless or lifeless, a pool of blood quickly forming on the ground beside him.     Chapter II  THE VANISHING MAN   For the first few seconds the Grammar School boys stood as if chained to the ground, their eyes staring with alarm and horror.  They stared at the man, apparently of middle age, who lay there, and they beheld the blood.  What on earth could have happened?  Boom! It was a lesser explosion that now sounded inside, yet it was enough to galvanize the boys into action.  \"Come on!\" cried Tom Reade, setting off in the lead. \"We don't know nor care what's in there!\"  \"The house may blow up next,\" added Greg, following him.  All the members of Dick & Co. were now in full retreat. They were courageous lads, but, with the immediate landscape in seeming danger of blowing up, getting away was the wisest possible course.  \"Say, what do you make of that?\" demanded Greg breathlessly, when the Grammar School boys had halted, well out of sight of the cottage and down in the woods.  \"Bang!\" replied Tom dryly. \"That's all I heard.\"  \"And blood,\" almost chattered Hazelton.  \"But what it means is a big puzzle,\" Dick added. \"If Rip and his crowd are or were in the cottage, they would hardly explode anything purposely and perhaps kill a man. That man appeared to be dead---he must be dead. Rip and Dodge are mean fellows, but they're hardly up to killing people.\"  \"There was an explosion,\" remarked Tom judicially, though his voice was still husky. \"Now, while I don't know everything, I believe there always has to be an explosive in order to bring about an explosion. Am I right?\"  \"You stand on ground that no one can dispute,\" nodded Dick. \"But how did the explosive come to be in a building that belongs to the water company, and which is supposed not to have been occupied in some years?\"  \"What was the man doing in there, for that matter?\" demanded Tom.  \"He wasn't very well dressed,\" observed Harry.  \"Yet he didn't look like a tramp,\" Dave put in.  \"But the man himself, and the fact that he's hurt or dead, are our two first points to consider,\" spoke Dick quickly. \"If he's hurt we are bound to bring him help. If he's dead, we'll have to notify---some one.\"  \"I'd like to go back there and have a look at him,\" quoth Tom, \"but the biggest explosion of all may come out of that cottage at any moment now.\"  \"Yet the facts are that another explosion hasn't come, and that the man ought to have help, as a matter of common decency,\" Dick urged.  \"I'll run to the nearest house where people are living,\" suggested Tom, pulling off his jacket and making ready for a run.  \"What are you going to tell the folks?\" Prescott queried. \"That the poor fellow is living or dead? I'm going back to find out which.\"  \"We'll all go,\" offered Dave.  \"But what happened to Rip and his mean crew?\" asked Hazelton.  \"We haven't seen any signs that they were in the cottage at all,\" Dick responded. \"If they were, as none of them came out, they must be badly hurt---perhaps worse.\"  As a matter of fact, Ripley and his party had not gone into the cottage, but had continued directly towards their homes.  That grisly thought gave all the boys a shudder as they plodded up the slope, between the bushes and thence stepped into the clearing.  \"Talk about dreaming!\" muttered Dick, halting abruptly and staring hard at the ground around the cottage.  In the first place, the cottage door was closed. There was no smoke now coming out of the chimney, and all looked peaceful and deserted, save for the presence of the Grammar School intruders. There was no injured man lying on the ground.  \"Crackey!\" gasped Greg. \"Yet we didn't all dream together, did we?\"  \"Certainly not,\" muttered Dick, again starting forward. The others followed him.  \"This is where we saw the man fall, isn't it?\" asked Dick.  \"Yes,\" nodded Greg.  \"But there was blood on the ground then,\" urged Dave. \"I don't see any now.\"  \"It must have been goblin blood, then,\" laughed Tom rather unsteadily, for this mystery began to look unearthly.  \"Hold on,\" hinted Dick. \"Doesn't it look as though fresh earth had been sprinkled here?\"  \"Of course it does,\" nodded Harry. \"And the earth has soaked up the blood.\"  \"I don't see any soaked-up blood,\" objected  Greg.  \"No; because it's so well covered and soaked up,\" argued Hazelton. \"But wait until I find a stick, and we'll stir up that dirt. Then we'll find the red stuff mixed to a sort of mud, and-----\"  \"Come along out of this, you ghoul!\" uttered Tom almost wrathfully, as he seized his friend by the arm.  \"We'll go to the door,\" Dick suggested. \"Perhaps we can get inside. At any rate, we can find out whether there is any one inside who wants help.\"  Dick put his hand on the doorknob, giving it a turn and a hard push.  \"Door's locked tightly now,\" he announced.  \"And it takes human hands to lock a door,\" Reade observed sagely.  \"Is there anyone inside who needs any help?\" Prescott called loudly.  All was silent inside. Then Dick played a tattoo on the locked door with his fists. Still no sound from inside.  \"All together, now,\" urged Dick. \"Any---one---want---help?\" bawled six lusty young voices in unison.  \"There is only one voice that answers,\" continued Dick, after a pause, as he turned to the others. \"That's the silent voice of good sense.\"  \"What does it say, then,\" challenged Dave.  \"That we've done about all we can do here,\" Dick replied. \"All we know is that a man seemed to have been hurt here. If he was, he was able to take himself away, and to conceal the signs of his hurt before going. Therefore we've no further excuse for meddling around here that I can see.\"  \"Let's get along then,\" Tom urged. \"And---whew! It's after half past six!\"  \"You'd better run, then,\" jeered Dave. \"Your stomach won't allow any more fooling!\"  \"Now, what ought I to say to a crank like Darry?\" demanded Reade, turning to Prescott.  \"You'd better overwhelm him, by saying what the man on the clubhouse steps said,\" urged Dick.  \"And what was that?\" asked Tom eagerly.  \"We-ell,\" hesitated Dick, \"I believe that's still a secret.\"  The Grammar School boys were now walking rapidly through the woods, but at mention of the clubhouse topic all had gathered close to their young leader.  \"Aren't you going to tell us now?\" demanded Greg.  \"I'm afraid not right away,\" responded Prescott slowly.  \"See here, Dickins,\" growled Dave Darrin, \"for months you've been stringing us about what the man on the clubhouse steps said. Time and again you've sprung that on us, and you've never given us the slightest satisfaction. Now, you'd either better tell us, or shut up about the man on the clubhouse steps.\"  \"All right,\" sighed Dick. \"I'll-----\"  \"Well?\" insisted five boys in the same breath.  \"I reckon I'll shut up,\" Dick rejoined.  \"Say, somebody ought to hit Dickins!\" grunted Reade.  \"That's right,\" grinned Dan. \"Well---let Tom do it.\"  Dick continued to smile mysteriously. He enjoyed this good-natured teasing of his chums.  \"What are we going to tell folks about what we saw at the cottage?\" queried Dan after another five minutes of trudging.  \"If we tell anything at all,\" suggested Prescott, \"I'll tell you how we can win a prize.\"  \"How?\" demanded Tom innocently. \"By telling the truth,\" Dick smiled. Soon after the Grammar School boys came out on the road.  \"See that group 'way ahead there?\" asked Tom, pointing down the road.  \"Yes,\" nodded Dick. \"That's Rip's crowd, so we know they didn't get hurt.\"  \"Then the only one who did get hurt,\" Tom added, \"was the man who was very soon able to take mighty good care of himself.\"  \"So we don't need to bother about the matter any more,\" Greg hinted. \"And, gracious! I hope mother has saved some supper for me.\"  \"It'll be a cold hand-out for me,\" groaned Hazelton.  The Grammar School boys were soon on Main Street now. They hurried along, as they had not yet come to the point of parting.  \"Look at that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12741"],["title","Risen from the Ranks; Or, Harry Walton's Success (#1)"],["body","necessarily omitted many interesting details, to be found in \"Bound to Rise,\" I have given the reader all the information required to enable him to understand the narrative of Harry's subsequent fortunes.     CHAPTER 11.  THE PRINTING OFFICE.  Jotham Anderson, editor and publisher of the \"Centreville Gazette,\" was sitting at his desk penning an editorial paragraph, when the office door opened, and Harry Walton entered.  \"Good-morning, Mr. Anderson,\" said our hero, removing his hat.  \"Good-morning, my friend.  I believe you have the advantage of me,\" replied the editor.  Our hero was taken aback.  It didn't occur to him that the engagement was a far less important event to the publisher than to himself.  He began to be afraid that the place had not been kept open for him.  \"My name is Harry Walton,\" he explained.  \"I was travelling with Prof. Henderson last winter, and called here to get some bills printed.\"  \"Oh yes, I remember you now.  I agreed to take you into the office,\" said the editor, to Harry's great relief.  \"Yes, air.\"  \"You haven't changed your mind, then?--You still want to be a printer?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You have left the Professor, I suppose.\"  \"I left him yesterday.\"  \"What did he pay you?\"  \"Five dollars a week.  He offered me six, if I would stay with him.\"  \"Of course you know that I can't pay you any such wages at present.\"  \"Yes, sir.  You agreed to give me my board the first month, and two dollars a week for six months afterward.\"  \"That is all you will be worth to me at first.  It is a good deal less than you would earn with Professor Henderson.\"  \"I know that, sir; but I am willing to come for that.\"  \"Good.  I see you are in earnest about printing, and that is a good sign.  I wanted you to understand just what you had to expect, so that you need not be disappointed.\"  \"I sha'n't be disappointed, sir,\" said Harry confidently.  \"I have made up my mind to be a printer, and if you didn't receive me into your office, I would try to get in somewhere else.\"  \"Then no more need be said.  When do you want to begin?\"  \"I am ready any time.\"  \"Where is your trunk?\"  \"At the tavern.\"  \"You can have it brought over to my house whenever you please.  The hotel-keeper will send it over for you.  He is our expressman.  Come into the house now, and I will introduce you to my wife.\"  The editor's home was just across the street from his printing office.  Followed by Harry he crossed the street, opened the front door, and led the way into the sitting-room, where a pleasant-looking lady of middle age was seated.  \"My dear,\" he said, \"I bring you a new boarder.\"  She looked at Harry inquiringly.  \"This young man,\" her husband explained, \"is going into the office to learn printing.  I have taken a contract to make a second Benjamin Franklin of him.\"  \"Then you'll do more for him than you have been able to do for yourself,\" said Mrs. Anderson, smiling.  \"You are inclined to be severe, Mrs. Anderson, but I fear you are correct.  However, I can be like a guide-post, which points the way which it does not travel.  Can you show Harry Walton--for that is his name--where you propose to put him?\"  \"I am afraid I must give you a room in the attic,\" said Mrs. Anderson.  \"Our house is small, and all the chambers on the second floor are occupied.\"  \"I am not at all particular,\" said Harry.  \"I have not been accustomed to elegant accommodations.\"  \"If you will follow me upstairs, I will show you your room.\"  Pausing on the third landing, Mrs. Anderson found the door of a small but comfortable bed-room.  There was no carpet on the floor, but it was painted yellow, and scrupulously clean.  A bed, two chairs, a bureau and wash-stand completed the list of furniture.  \"I shall like this room very well,\" said our hero.  \"There is a closet,\" said the lady, pointing to a door in the corner. \"It is large enough to contain your trunk, if you choose to put it in there.  I hope you don't smoke.\"  \"Oh, no, indeed,\" said Harry, laughing.  \"I haven't got so far along as that.\"  \"Mr. Anderson's last apprentice--he is a journeyman now--was a smoker.  He not only scented up the room, but as he was very careless about lights, I was continually alarmed lest he should set the house on fire.  Finally, I got so nervous that I asked him to board somewhere else.\"  \"Is he working for Mr. Anderson now?\"  \"Yes; you probably saw him in the office.\"  \"I saw two young men at the case.\"  \"The one I speak of is the youngest.  His name is John Clapp.\"  \"There is no danger of my smoking.  I don't think it would do me any good.  Besides, it is expensive, and I can't afford it.\"  \"I see we think alike,\" said Mrs. Anderson, smiling.  \"I am sure we will get along well together.\"  \"I shall try not to give you any trouble,\" said our hero, and his tone, which was evidently sincere, impressed Mrs. Anderson still more favorably.  \"You won't find me very hard to suit, I hope.  I suppose you will be here to supper?\"  \"If it will he quite convenient.  My trunk is at the tavern, and I could stay there till morning, if you wished.\"  \"Oh, no, come at once.  Take possession of the room now, if you like, and leave an order to have your trunk brought here.\"  \"Thank you.  What is your hour for supper?\"  \"Half-past five.\"  \"Thank you.  I will go over and speak to Mr. Anderson a minute.\"  The editor looked up as Harry reappeared.  \"Well, have you settled arrangements with Mrs. Anderson?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir, I believe so.\"  \"I hope you like your room.\"  \"It is very comfortable.  It won't take me long to feel at home there.\"  \"Did she ask you whether you smoked?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I thought she would.  That's where Clapp and she fell out.\"  Harry's attention was drawn to a thin, sallow young man of about twenty, who stood at a case on the opposite side of the room.  \"Mrs. Anderson was afraid I would set the house on fire,\" said the young man thus referred to.  \"Yes, she felt nervous about it.  However, it is not surprising.  An uncle of hers lost his house in that way.  I suppose you don't smoke, Walton?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Clapp smokes for his health.  You see how stout and robust he is,\" said the editor, a little satirically.  \"It doesn't do me any harm,\" said Clapp, a little testily.  \"Oh, well, I don't interfere with you, though I think you would be better off if you should give up the habit.  Ferguson don't smoke.\"  This was the other compositor, a man of thirty, whose case was not far distant from Clapp's.  \"I can't afford it,\" said Ferguson; \"nor could Clapp, if he had a wife and two young children to support.\"  \"Smoking doesn't cost much,\" said the younger journeyman.  \"So you think; but did you ever reckon it up?\"  \"No.\"  \"Don't you keep any accounts?\"  \"No; I spend when I need to, and I can always tell how much I have left.  What's the use of keeping accounts?\"  \"You can tell how you stand.\"  \"I can tell that without taking so much trouble.\"  \"You see we must all agree to disagree,\" said Mr. Anderson.  \"I am afraid Clapp isn't going to be a second Benjamin Franklin.\"  \"Who is?\" asked Clapp.  \"Our young friend here,\" said the editor.  \"Oh, is he?\" queried the other with a sneer.  \"It'll be a great honor I'm sure, to have him in the office.\"  \"Come, no chaffing, Clapp,\" said Mr. Anderson.  Harry hastened to disclaim the charge, for Clapp's sneer affected him disagreeably.  \"I admire Franklin,\" he said, \"but there isn't much danger of my turning out a second edition of him.\"  \"Professional already, I see, Walton,\" said the editor.  \"When shall I go to work, Mr. Anderson?\"  \"Whenever you are ready.\"  \"I am ready now.\"  \"You are prompt.\"  \"You won't be in such a hurry to go to work a week hence,\" said Clapp.  \"I think I shall,\" said Harry.  \"I am anxious to learn as fast as possible.\"  \"Oh, I forgot.  You want to become a second Franklin.\"  \"I sha'n't like him,\" thought our hero.  \"He seems to try to make himself disagreeable.\"  \"Mr. Ferguson will give you some instruction, and set you to work,\" said his employer.  Harry was glad that it was from the older journeyman that he was to receive his first lesson, and not from the younger.     CHAPTER III.  HARRY STUMBLES UPON AN ACQUAINTANCE.  After supper Harry went round to the tavern to see about his trunk. A group of young men were in the bar-room, some of whom looked up as he entered.  Among these was Luke Harrison, who was surprised and by no means pleased to see his creditor.  Harry recognized him at the same instant, and said, \"How are you, Luke?\"  \"Is that you, Walton?\" said Luke.  \"What brings you to Centreville? Professor Henderson isn't here, is he?\"  \"No; I have left him.\"  \"Oh, you're out of a job, are you?\" asked Luke, in a tone of satisfaction, for we are apt to dislike those whom we have injured, and for this reason he felt by no means friendly.  \"No, I'm not,\" said Harry, quietly.  \"I've found work in Centreville.\"  \"Gone back to pegging, have you?  Whose shop are you in?\"  \"I am in a different business.\"  \"You don't say!  What is it?\" asked Luke, with some curiosity.  \"I'm in the office of the 'Centreville Gazette.'  I'm going to learn the printing business.\"  \"You are?  Why, I've got a friend in the office,--John Clapp.  He never told me about your being there.\"  \"He didn't know I was coming.  I only went to work this afternoon.\"  \"So you are the printer's devil?\" said Luke, with a slight sneer.  \"I believe so,\" answered our hero, quietly.  \"Do you get good pay?\"  \"Not much at first.  However, I can get along with what money I have, _and what is due me_.\"  Luke Harrison understood the last allusion, and turned away abruptly. He had no wish to pay up the money which he owed Harry, and for this reason was sorry to see him in the village.  He feared, if the conversation were continued, Harry would be asking for the money, and this would be disagreeable.  At this moment John Clapp entered the bar-room.  He nodded slightly to Harry, but walked up to Luke, and greeted him cordially.  There were many points of"]]]
