They walked up to the bar, and they were soon pledging each other in a fiery fluid which was not very likely to benefit either of them. Meanwhile Harry gave directions about his trunk, and left the room.  \"So you've got a new 'devil' in your office,\" said Luke, after draining his glass.  \"Yes.  He came this afternoon.  How did you hear?\"  \"He told me.\"  \"Do you know him?\" asked Clapp, in some surprise.  \"Yes.  I know him as well as I want to.\"  \"What sort of a fellow is he?\"  \"Oh, he's a sneak--one of your pious chaps, that 'wants to be an angel, and with the angels stand.'\"  \"Then he's made a mistake in turning 'devil,'\" said Clapp.  \"Good for you!\" said Luke, laughing.  \"You're unusually brilliant to-night, Clapp.\"  \"So he's a saint, is he?\"  \"He set up for one; but I don't like his style myself.  He's as mean as dirt.  Why I knew him several months, and he never offered to treat in all that time.  He's as much afraid of spending a cent as if it were a dollar.\"  \"He won't have many dollars to spend just at present.  He's working for his board.\"  \"Oh, he's got money saved up,\" said Luke.  \"Fellows like him hang on to a cent when they get it.  I once asked him to lend me a few dollars, just for a day or two, but he wouldn't do it.  I hate such mean fellows.\"  \"So do I.  Will you have a cigar?\"  \"I'll treat this time,\" said Luke, who thought it polite to take his turn in treating once to his companion's four or five times.  \"Thank you.  From what you say, I am sorry Anderson has taken the fellow into the office.\"  \"You needn't have much to say to him.\"  \"I shan't trouble myself much about him.  I didn't like his looks when I first set eyes on him.  I suppose old Mother Anderson will like him.  She couldn't abide my smoking, and he won't trouble her that way.\"  \"So; he's too mean to buy the cigars.\"  \"He said he couldn't afford it.\"  \"That's what it comes to.  By the way, Clapp, when shall we take another ride?\"  \"I can get away nest Monday afternoon, at three.\"  \"All right.  I'll manage to get off at the same time.  We'll go to Whiston and take supper at the hotel.  It does a fellow good to get off now and then.  It won't cost more than five dollars apiece altogether.\"  \"We'll get the carriage charged.  The fact is, I'm little low on funds.\"  \"So am I, but it won't matter.  Griffin will wait for his pay.\"  While Harry's character waa being so unfavorably discussed, he was taking a walk by himself, observing with interest the main features of his new home.  He had been here before with Professor Henderson, but had been too much occupied at that time to get a very clear idea of Centreville, nor had it then the interest for him which it had acquired since.  He went upon a hill overlooking the village, and obtained an excellent view from its summit.  It was a pleasant, well-built village of perhaps three thousand inhabitants, with outlying farms and farm-houses.  Along the principal streets the dwellings and stores were closely built, so as to make it seem quite city-like.  It was the shire town of the county, and being the largest place in the neighborhood, country people for miles around traded at its stores.  Farmers' wives came to Centreville to make purchases, just as ladies living within a radius of thirty miles visit New York and Boston, for a similar purpose.  Altogether, therefore, Centreville was quite a lively place, and a town of considerable local importance.  The fact that it had a weekly paper of its own, contributed to bring it into notice.  Nor was that all. Situated on a little hillock was a building with a belfry, which might have been taken for a church but for a play-ground near by, which indicated that it had a different character.  It was in fact the Prescott Academy, so called from the name of its founder, who had endowed it with a fund of ten thousand dollars, besides erecting the building at his own expense on land bought for the purpose.  This academy also had a local reputation, and its benefits were not confined to the children of Centreville.  There were about twenty pupils from other towns who boarded with the Principal or elsewhere in the town, and made up the whole number of students in attendance--about eighty on an average.  Standing on the eminence referred to, Harry's attention was drawn to the Academy, and he could not help forming the wish that he, too, might share in its advantages.  \"There is so much to learn, and I know so little,\" he thought.  But he did not brood over the poverty which prevented him from gratifying his desire.  He knew it would do no good, and he also reflected that knowledge may be acquired in a printing office as well as within the walls of an academy or college.  \"As soon as I get well settled,\" he said to himself, \"I mean to get some books and study a little every day.  That is the way Franklin did.  I never can be an editor, that's certain, without knowing more than I do now.  Before I am qualified to teach others, I must know something myself.\"  Looking at the village which lay below him, Harry was disposed to congratulate himself on his new residence.  \"It looks like a pleasant place,\" he said to himself, \"and when I get a little acquainted, I shall enjoy myself very well, I am sure.  Of course I shall feel rather lonely just at first.\"  He was so engrossed by his thoughts that he did not take heed to his steps, and was only reminded of his abstraction by his foot suddenly coming in contact with a boy who was lying under a tree, and pitching headfirst over him.  \"Holloa!\" exclaimed the latter, \"what are you about?  You didn't take me for a foot-ball, did you?\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" said Harry, jumping up in some confusion.  \"I was so busy thinking that I didn't see you.  I hope I didn't hurt you.\"  \"Nothing serious.  Didn't you hurt yourself?\"  \"I bumped my head a little, but it only struck the earth.  If it had been a stone, it might have been different.  I had no idea there was any one up here except myself.\"  \"It was very kind of you to bow so low to a perfect stranger,\" said the other, his eyes twinkling humorously.  \"I suppose it would only be polite for me to follow your example.\"  \"I'll excuse you,\" said Harry laughing.  \"Thank you.  That takes a great burden off my mind.  I don't like to be outdone in politeness, but really I shouldn't like to tumble over you.  My head may be softer than yours.  There's one thing clear.  We ought to know each other.  As you've taken the trouble to come up here, and stumble over me, I really feel as if we ought to strike up a friendship.  What do you say?\"  \"With all my heart,\" said our hero.     CHAPTER IV.  OSCAR VINCENT.  \"Allow me to introduce myself,\" said the stranger boy.  \"My name is Oscar Vincent, from Boston, at present a student at the Prescott Academy, at your service.\"  As he spoke, he doffed his hat and bowed, showing a profusion of chestnut hair, a broad, open brow, and an attractive face, lighted up by a pleasant smile.  Harry felt drawn to him by a feeling which was not long in ripening into friendship.  Imitating the other's frankness, he also took off his hat and replied,--  \"Let me introduce myself, in turn, as Harry Walton, junior apprentice in the office of the 'Centreville Gazette,' sometimes profanely called 'printer's devil.'\"  \"Good!\" said Oscar, laughing.  \"How do you like the business?\"  \"I think I shall like it, but I have only just started in it.  I went into the office for the first time to-day.\"  \"I have an uncle who started as you are doing,\" said Oscar.  \"He is now chief editor of a daily paper in Boston.\"  \"Is he?\" said Harry, with interest.  \"Did he find it hard to rise?\"  \"He is a hard worker.  I have heard him say that he used to sit up late of nights during his apprenticeship, studying and improving himself.\"  \"That is what I mean to do,\" said Harry.  \"I don't think he was as lazy as his nephew,\" said Oscar.  \"I am afraid if I had been in his place I should have remained in it.\"  \"Are you lazy?\" asked Harry, smiling at the other's frankness.  \"A little so; that is, I don't improve my opportunities as I might. Father wants to make a lawyer of me so he has put me here, and I am preparing for Harvard.\"  \"I envy you,\" said Harry.  \"There is nothing I should like so much as entering college.\"  \"I daresay I shall like it tolerably well,\" said Oscar; \"but I don't _hanker_ after it, as the boy said after swallowing a dose of castor oil.  I'll tell you what I should like better--\"  \"What?\" asked Harry, as the other paused.  \"I should like to enter the Naval Academy, and qualify myself for the naval service.  I always liked the sea.\"  \"Doesn't your father approve of your doing this?\"  \"He wouldn't mind my entering the navy as an officer, but he is not willing to have me enter the merchant service.\"  \"Then why doesn't he send you to the Naval Academy?\"  \"Because I can't enter without receiving the appointment from a member of Congress.  Our member can only appoint one, and there is no vacancy.  So, as I can't go where I want to, I am preparing for Harvard.\"  \"Are you studying Latin and Greek?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Have you studied them long?\"  \"About two years.  I was looking over my Greek lesson when you playfully tumbled over me.\"  \"Will you let me look at your book?  I never saw a Greek book.\"  \"I sometimes wish I never had,\" said Oscar; \"but that's when I am lazy.\"  Harry opened the book--a Greek reader--in the middle of an extract from Xenophon, and looked with some awe at the unintelligible letters.  \"Can you read it?  Can you understand what it means?\" he asked, looking up from the book.  \"So-so.\"  \"You must know a great deal.\"  Oscar laughed.  \"I wonder what Dr. Burton would say if he heard you,\" he said.  \"Who is he?\"  \"Principal of our Academy.

So, when the clause enacting a Sacramental Test was put in execution, it was given out in England, that half the justices of peace through this kingdom had laid down their commissions; whereas upon examination, the whole number was found to amount only to a dozen or thirteen, and those generally of the lowest rate in fortune and understanding, and some of them superannuated. So, when the Earl of Pembroke was in Ireland and the Parliament sitting, a formal story was very gravely carried to his Excellency by some zealous members, of a priest newly arrived from abroad to the north-west parts of Ireland, who had publicly preached to his people, to fall a-murdering the Protestants; which, though invented to serve an end they were then upon, and are still driving at, it was presently handed over, and printed with shrewd remarks by your worthy scribblers. In like manner, the account of that person who was lately expelled our university for reflecting on the memory of King William, what a dust it raised, and how foully it was related, is fresh enough in memory.[2] Neither would people be convinced till the university was at the pains of publishing a Latin paper to justify themselves. And, to mention no more, this story of the persecution at Drogheda, how it hath been spread and aggravated, what consequences have been drawn from it, and what reproaches fixed on those who have least deserved them, we are already informed. Now if the end of all this proceeding were a secret and mystery, I should not undertake to give it an interpretation, but sufficient care hath been taken to give it sufficient explanation.[3] First, by addresses artificially (if not illegally) procured, to shew the miserable state of the dissenters in Ireland by reason of the Sacramental Test, and to desire the Queen's intercession that it might be repealed. Then it is manifest that our Speaker, when he was last year in England, solicited, in person, several members of both Houses, to have it repealed by an act there, though it be a matter purely national, that cannot possibly interfere with the trade and interest of England, and though he himself appeared formerly the most zealous of all men against the injustice of binding a nation by laws to which they do not consent. And lastly, those weekly libellers, whenever they get a tale by the end relating to Ireland, without ever troubling their thoughts about the truth, always end it with an application against the Sacramental Test, and the absolute necessity there is of repealing it in both kingdoms. I know it may be reckoned a weakness to say anything of such trifles as are below a serious man's notice; much less would I disparage the understanding of any party to think they would choose the vilest and most ignorant among mankind, to employ them for assertors of a cause. I shall only say, that the scandalous liberty those wretches take would hardly be allowed, if it were not mingled with opinions that _some men_ would be glad to advance. Besides, how insipid soever those papers are, they seem to be levelled to the understandings of a great number; they are grown a necessary part in coffee-house furniture, and some time or other may happen to be read by customers of all ranks, for curiosity and amusement; because they lie always in the way. One of these authors (the fellow that was pilloried I have forgot his name)[4] is indeed so grave, sententious, dogmatical a rogue, that there is no enduring him; the _Observator_[5] is much the brisker of the two, and I think farther gone of late in lies and impudence, than his Presbyterian brother. The reason why I mention him, is to have an occasion of letting you know, that you have not dealt so gallantly with us, as we did with you in a parallel case: Last year, a paper was brought here from England, called, \"A Dialogue between the Archbishop of Canterbury and Mr. Higgins,\" which we ordered to be burnt by the common hangman, as it well deserved; though we have no more to do with his Grace of Canterbury[6] than you have with the Archbishop of Dublin[7]; nor can you love and reverence your prelate more than we do ours, whom you tamely suffer to be abused openly, and by name, by that paltry rascal of an _Observator_; and lately upon an affair wherein he had no concern; I mean the business of the missionary at Drogheda, wherein our excellent primate was engaged, and did nothing but according to law and discretion. But because the Lord Archbishop of Dublin hath been upon several occasions of late years, misrepresented in England, I would willingly set you right in his character. For his great sufferings and eminent services he was by the late King promoted to the see of Derry. About the same time, he wrote a book to justify the Revolution, wherein was an account of King James's proceedings in Ireland, and the late Archbishop Tillotson recommended it to the King as the most serviceable treatise that could have been published at such a juncture.[8] And as his Grace set out upon those principles, he has proceeded so ever since, as a loyal subject to the Queen, entirely for the succession in the Protestant line, and for ever excluding the Pretender; and though a firm friend to the Church, yet with indulgence toward dissenters, as appears from his conduct at Derry, where he was settled for many years among the most virulent of the sect; yet upon his removal to Dublin, they parted from him with tears in their eyes, and universal acknowledgments of his wisdom and goodness. For the rest, it must be owned, he does not busy himself by entering deep into any party, but rather spends his time in acts of hospitality and charity, in building of churches, repairing his palace, in introducing and preferring the worthiest persons he can find, without other regards; in short, in the practice of all virtues that can become a public or private life. This and more, if possible, is due to so excellent a person, who may be justly reckoned among the greatest and most learned prelates of his age, however his character may be defiled by such mean and dirty hands as those of the _Observator_ or such as employ him.[9]  [Footnote 2:  The Provost and Fellows of Trinity College, Dublin, had lately expelled Edward Forbes for the cause mentioned in the text.

He was also the author of a play entitled, \"The Unfortunate Shepherd.\" Pope refers to these punishments meted out to Defoe and Tutchin, in the second book of the \"Dunciad\":    \"Earless on high, stood unabashed De Foe,   And Tutchin flagrant from the scourge below.\" [T.S.]]  [Footnote 6: Dr. Thomas Tenison (1636-1715), born at Cottenham, Cambridgeshire.

I must begin by telling you, we are generally surprised at your wonderful kindness to us on this occasion, it being so very industrious to teach us to see our interest in a point where we are so unable to see it ourselves. This hath given us some suspicion; and though in my own particular, I am hugely bent to believe, that whenever you concern yourselves in our affairs, it is certainly for our good, yet I have the misfortune to be something singular in this belief, and therefore I never attempt to justify it, but content myself to possess my own opinion in private, for fear of encountering men of more wit or words than I have to spare.
