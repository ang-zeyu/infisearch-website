In 1885, in the First Congress, Mr. P. Rangiah Naidu pointed out that military expenditure had been £1,463,000 in 1857 and had risen to £16,975,750 in 1884. Mr. D.E. Wacha ascribed the growth to the amalgamation scheme of 1859, and remarked that the Company in 1856 had an army of 254,000 men at a cost of 11-1/2 millions, while in 1884 the Crown had an army of only 181,000 men at a cost of 17 millions. The rise was largely due to the increased cost of the European regiments, overland transport service, stores, pensions, furlough allowances, and the like, most of them imposed despite the resistance of the Government of India, which complained that the changes were “made entirely, it may be said, from Imperial considerations, in which Indian interests have not been consulted or advanced.” India paid nearly, £700,000 a year, for instance, for “Home Depôts”--Home being England of course--in which lived some 20,000 to 22,000 British soldiers, on the plea that their regiments, not they, were serving in India. I cannot follow out the many increases cited by Mr. Wacha, but members can refer to his excellent speech.  Mr. Fawcett once remarked that when the East India Company was abolished       the English people became directly responsible for the      Government of India. It cannot, I think, be denied that this      responsibility has been so imperfectly discharged that in many      respects the new system of Government compares unfavourably      with the old.... There was at that time an independent control      of expenditure which now seems to be almost entirely wanting.  Shortly after the Crown assumed the rule of India, Mr. Disraeli asked the House of Commons to regard India as “a great and solemn trust committed to it by an all-wise and inscrutable Providence.” Mr. George Yule, in the Fourth Congress, remarked on this: “The 650 odd members had thrown the trust back upon the hands of Providence, to be looked after as Providence itself thinks best.” Perhaps it is time that India should remember that Providence helps those who help themselves.  Year after year the Congress continued to remonstrate against the cost of the army, until in 1902, after all the futile protests of the intervening years, it condemned an increase of pay to British soldiers in India which placed an additional burden on the Indian revenues of £786,000 a year, and pointed out that the British garrison was unnecessarily numerous, as was shown by the withdrawal of large bodies of British soldiers for service in South Africa and China. The very next year Congress protested that the increasing military expenditure was not to secure India against internal disorder or external attack, but in order to carry out an Imperial policy; the Colonies contributed little or nothing to the Imperial Military Expenditure, while India bore the cost of about one-third of the whole British Army in addition to her own Indian troops. Surely these facts should be remembered when India’s military services to the Empire are now being weighed.  In 1904 and 1905, the Congress declared that the then military expenditure was beyond India’s power to bear, and in the latter year prayed that the additional ten millions sterling sanctioned for Lord Kitchener’s reorganisation scheme might be devoted to education and the reduction of the burden on the raiyats. In 1908, the burdens imposed by the British War Office since 1859 were condemned, and in the next year it was pointed out that the military expenditure was nearly a third of the whole Indian revenue, and was starving Education and Sanitation.  Lord Kitchener’s reorganisation scheme kept the Indian Army on a War footing, ready for immediate mobilisation, and on January 1, 1915, the regular army consisted of 247,000 men, of whom 75,000 were English; it was the money spent by India in maintaining this army for years in readiness for War which made it possible for her to go to the help of Great Britain at the critical early period to which I alluded. She spent over £20 millions on the military services in 1914-15. In 1915-16 she spent £21.8 millions. In 1916-17 her military budget had risen to £12 millions, and it will probably be exceeded, as was the budget of the preceding year by £1-2/3 million.  Lord Hardinge, the last Viceroy of India, who is ever held in loving memory here for his sympathetic attitude towards Indian aspirations, made a masterly exposition of India’s War services in the House of Lords on the third of last July. He emphasised her pre-War services, showing that though 19-1/4 millions sterling was fixed as a maximum by the Nicholson Committee, that amount had been exceeded in 11 out of the last 13 budgets, while his own last budget had risen to 22 millions. During these 13 years the revenue had been only between 48 and 58 millions, once rising to 60 millions. Could any fact speak more eloquently of India’s War services than this proportion of military expenditure compared with her revenue?  The Great War began on August 4th, and in that very month and in the early part of September, India sent an expeditionary force of three divisions--two infantry and one cavalry--and another cavalry division joined them in France in November. The first arrived, said Lord Hardinge, “in time to fill a gap that could not otherwise have been filled.” He added pathetically: “There are very few survivors of those two splendid divisions of infantry.” Truly, their homes are empty, but their sons shall enjoy in India the liberty for which their fathers died in France. Three more divisions were at once sent to guard the Indian frontier, while in September a mixed division was sent to East Africa, and in October and November two more divisions and a brigade of cavalry went to Egypt. A battalion of Indian infantry went to Mauritius, another to the Cameroons, and two to the Persian Gulf, while other Indian troops helped the Japanese in the capture of Tsingtau. 210,000 Indians were thus sent overseas. The whole of these troops were fully armed and equipped, and in addition, during the first few weeks of the War, India sent to England from her magazines “70 million rounds of small-arm ammunition, 60,000 rifles, and more than 550 guns of the latest pattern and type.”  In addition to these, Lord Hardinge speaks of sending to England       enormous quantities of material,... tents, boots, saddlery,      clothing, etc., but every effort was made to meet the      ever-increasing demands made by the War Office, and it may be      stated without exaggeration that India was bled absolutely      white during the first few weeks of the war.  It must not be forgotten, though Lord Hardinge has not reckoned it, that all wastage has been more than filled up, and 450,000 men represent this head; the increase in units has been 300,000, and including other military items India had placed in the field up to the end of 1916 over a million of men.  In addition to this a British force of 80,000 was sent from India, fully trained and equipped at Indian cost, India receiving in exchange, many months later, 34 Territorial battalions and 29 batteries, “unfit for immediate employment on the frontier or in Mesopotamia, until they had been entirely re-armed and equipped, and their training completed.”  Between the autumn of 1914 and the close of 1915, the defence of our own frontiers was a serious matter, and Lord Hardinge says:       The attitude of Afghanistan was for a long time doubtful,      although I always had confidence in the personal loyalty of our      ally the Amir; but I feared lest he might be overwhelmed by a      wave of fanaticism, or by a successful Jehad of the tribes....      It suffices to mention that, although during the previous three      years there had been no operations of any importance on the      North-West frontier, there were, between November 29, 1914, and      September 5, 1915, no less than seven serious attacks on the      North-West frontier, all of which were effectively dealt with.  The military authorities had also to meet a German conspiracy early in 1915, 7,000 men arriving from Canada and the United States, having planned to seize points of military vantage in the Panjab, and in December of the same year another German conspiracy in Bengal, necessitating military preparations on land, and also naval patrols in the Bay of Bengal.  Lord Hardinge has been much attacked by the Tory and Unionist Press in England and India, in England because of the Mesopotamia Report, in India because his love for India brought him hatred from Anglo-India. India has affirmed her confidence in him, and with India’s verdict he may well rest satisfied.  I do not care to dwell on the Mesopotamia Commission and its condemnation of the bureaucratic system prevailing here. Lord Hardinge vindicated himself and India. The bureaucratic system remains undefended. I recall that bureaucratic inefficiency came out in even more startling fashion in connection with the Afghan War of 1878-79 and 1879-80. In February 1880, the war charges were reported as under £4 millions, and the accounts showed a surplus of £2 millions. On April 8th the Government of India reported: “Outgoing for War very alarming, far exceeding estimate,” and on the 13th April “it was announced that the cash balances had fallen in three months from thirteen crores to less than nine, owing to ‘excessive Military drain’ ... On the following day (April 22) a despatch was sent out to the Viceroy, showing that there appeared a deficiency of not less than 5-1/4 crores. This vast error was evidently due to an underestimate of war liabilities, which had led to such mis-information being laid before Parliament, and to the sudden discovery of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12823"],["title","Joe's Luck; Or, Always Wide Awake (#1)"],["body","excite an unpleasant degree of attention.  Joe did not appear to be overwhelmed with the magnificence of the gift.  “If it is so good, why don’t Oscar wear it?” he asked.  Major Norton regarded Joe with displeasure.  “It cannot matter to you how Oscar chooses to dress,” he said. “I apprehend that you and he are not on a level.”  “He is your son, and I am your hired boy,” said Joe. “I admit that. But I don’t see how you can ask me to wear a suit like that.”  “I apprehend that you are unsuitably proud, Joseph.”  “I hope not, sir; but I don’t want to attract everybody’s notice as I walk the streets. If I had stained the suit myself, I should have felt bound to wear it, but it was Oscar’s carelessness that destroyed its appearance, and I don’t think I ought to suffer for that. Besides, it is much too small for me. Let me show you.”  Joe pulled off his coat and put on the stained one. The sleeves were from two to three inches too short, and it was so far from meeting in front, on account of his being much broader than Oscar, that his shoulders seemed drawn back to meet each other behind.  “It doesn’t exactly fit,” said the major; “but it can be let out easily. I will send it to Miss Pearce--the village tailoress--to fix it over for you.”  “Thank you, Major Norton,” said Joe, in a decided tone, “but I hope you won’t go to that expense, for I shall not be willing to wear it under any circumstances.”  “I cannot believe my ears,” said Major Norton, with dignified displeasure. “How old are you, Joseph?”  “Fifteen, sir.”  “It is not fitting that you, a boy of fifteen, should dictate to your employer.”  “I don’t wish to, Major Norton, but I am not willing to wear that suit.”  “You are too proud. Your pride needs taking down.”  “Major Norton,” said Joe firmly, “I should like to tell you how I feel. You are my employer, and I am your hired boy. I try to do my duty by you.”  “You are a good boy to work, Joseph. I don’t complain of that.”  “You agreed to give me board and clothing for my services.”  “So I have.”  “Yes, sir; but you have dressed me in such a way that I attract attention in the street for my shabbiness. I don’t think I am very proud, but I have been mortified! more than once when I saw people looking at my patched clothes and shoes out at the toes. I think if I work faithfully I ought to be dressed decently.”  “Joseph,” said Major Norton uneasily, “you look at the thing too one-sided. You don’t expect me to dress you like Oscar?”  “No, sir; I don’t. If you would spend half as much for my clothes as you do for Oscar’s I would be contented.”  “It seems to me you are very inconsistent. Here is a suit of clothes that cost me thirty-four dollars, which I offer you, and you decline.”  “You know why well enough, sir,” said Joe, “You did not tell me you intended to dress me in Oscar’s castoff clothes, too small, and stained at that. I would rather wear the patched suit I have on till it drops to pieces than wear this suit.”  “You can go, Joseph,” said Major Norton, in a tone of annoyance. “I did not expect to find you so unreasonable. If you do not choose to take what I offer you, you will have to go without.”  “Very well, sir.”  Joe left the room, his face flushed and his heart full of indignation at the slight which had been attempted on him.  “It is Oscar’s doings, I have no doubt,” he said to himself. “It is like his meanness. He meant to mortify me.”  If there had been any doubt in Joe’s mind, it would soon have been cleared up. Oscar had been lying in wait for his appearance, and managed to meet him as he went out into the yard.  “Where are your new clothes?” he asked mockingly.  “I have none,” answered Joe.  “Didn’t my father give you a suit of mine?”  “He offered me the suit which you stained so badly with acid.”  “Well, it’s pretty good,” said Oscar patronizingly. “I only wore it about a month.”  “Why don’t you wear it longer?”  “Because it isn’t fit for me to wear,” returned Oscar.  “Nor for me,” said Joe.  “You don’t mean to say you’ve declined?” exclaimed Oscar, in surprise.  “That is exactly what I have done.”  “Why?”  “You ought to know why.”  “It is better than the one you have on.”  “It is too small for me. Besides, it would attract general attention.”  “Seems to me somebody is getting proud,” sneered Oscar. “Perhaps you think Annie Raymond wouldn’t walk with you in that suit?”  “I think it would make no difference to her,” said Joe. “She was willing to walk with me in this ragged suit.”  “I don’t admire her taste.”  “She didn’t walk with my clothes; she walked with me.”  “A hired boy!”  “Yes, I am a hired boy; but I don’t get very good pay.”  “You feel above your business, that’s what’s the matter with you.”  “I hope some time to get higher than my business,” said Joe. “I mean to rise in the world, if I can.”  Oscar shrugged his shoulders.  “Perhaps you would like to be a wealthy merchant, or a member of Congress,” he said.  “I certainly should.”  Oscar burst into a sneering laugh, and left Joe alone.  Joe’s work was done, and, being left free to do as he liked, he strolled over to the village store.     CHAPTER III  THE RETURNED CALIFORNIAN   The village store, in the evening, was a sort of village club-house, where not only the loungers, but a better class, who desired to pass the evening socially, were wont to congregate. About the center of the open space was a large box-stove, which in winter was kept full of wood, ofttimes getting red-hot, and around this sat the villagers. Some on wooden chairs, some on a wooden settee, with a broken back, which was ranged on one side.  Joe frequently came here in the evening to pass a social hour and kill time. At the house of Major Norton he had no company. Oscar felt above him, and did not deign to hold any intercourse with his father’s drudge, while the housekeeper--Major Norton being a widower--was busy about her own special work, and would have wondered at Joe if he had sought her company. I make this explanation because I do not wish it to be understood that Joe was a common village lounger, or loafer.  When Joe entered the store he found the usual company present, but with one addition.  This was Seth Larkin, who had just returned from California, whither he had gone eighteen months before, and was, of course, an object of great attention, and plied with numerous questions by his old acquaintances in regard to the land of promise in the far West, of which all had heard so much.  It was in the fall of the year 1851, and so in the early days of California.  Seth was speaking as Joe entered.  “Is there gold in California?” repeated Seth, apparently in answer to a question. “I should say there was. Why, it’s chock full of it. People haven’t begun to find out the richness of the country. It’s the place for a poor man to go if he wants to become rich. What’s the prospects here? I ask any one of you. A man may go working and plodding from one year’s end to another and not have ten dollars at the end of it. There’s some here that know that I speak the truth.”  “How much better can a man do in California?” asked Daniel Tompkins.  “Well, Dan,” said Seth, “it depends on the kind of man he is. If he’s a man like you, that spends his money for rum as fast as he gets it, I should say it’s just as well to stay here. But if he’s willing to work hard, and to put by half he makes, he’s sure to do well, and he may get rich. Why, I knew a man that landed in California the same day that I did, went up to the mines, struck a vein, and--well, how much do you think that man is worth to-day?”  “A thousand dollars?” suggested Dan Tompkins.  “Why, I’m worth more than that myself, and I wasn’t lucky, and had the rheumatism for four months. You’ll have to go higher.”  “Two thousand?” guessed Sam Stone.  “We don’t make much account of two thousand dollars in the mines, Sam,” said Seth.  “It’s of some account here,” said Sam. “I’ve been workin’ ten years, and I ain’t saved up a third of it.”  “I don’t doubt it,” said Seth; “and it ain’t your fault, either. Money’s scarce round here, and farmin’ don’t pay. You know what I was workin’ at before I went out--in a shoe shop. I just about made a poor livin’, and that was all. I didn’t have money enough to pay my passage out, but I managed to borrow it. Well, it’s paid now, and I’ve got something left.”  “You haven’t told us yet how much the man made that you was talkin’ about,” said Tom Sutter. “It couldn’t be five thousand dollars, now, could it?”  “I should say it could,” said Seth.  “Was it any more?” inquired Dan Tompkins.  “Well, boys, I s’pose I may as well tell you, and you may b’lieve it or not, just as you like. That man is worth twenty thousand dollars to-day.”  There was a chorus of admiring ejaculations.  “Twenty thousand dollars! Did you ever hear the like?”  “Mind, boys, I don’t say it’s common to make so much money in so short a time. There isn’t one in ten does it, but some make even more. What I do say is, that a feller that’s industrious, and willin’ to work, an’ rough it, and save what he makes, is sure to do well, if he keeps well. That’s all a man has a right to expect, or to hope for.”  “To be sure it is.”  “What made you come home, Seth, if you were gettin’ on so well?” inquired one.  “That’s a fair question,” said Seth, “and I’m willin’ to answer it. It was because of the rheumatics. I had ’em powerful bad at the mines, and I’ve come home to kinder recuperate, if that’s the right word. But I’m goin’ back ag’in, you may bet high on that. No more work in the shoe shop for me at the old rates. I don’t mean that I’d mind bein’ a manufacturer on a big scale. That’s a little more stiddy and easy than bein’ at the mines, but that takes more capital than I’ve got.”  “How much does it cost to go out there?” asked Dan Tompkins.  “More money than you can scare together, Dan. First-class, nigh on to three hundred dollars, I believe.”  This statement rather dampened the ardor of more than one of the listeners. Three hundred"]]]
