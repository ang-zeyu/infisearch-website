He stroked her head with his calloused, sunburned hand and his eyes filmed with a distant gaze.  \"I might have knowed it!\" he said over and over again; \"I might have knowed it! Hush, my silly gal.\"  Her sobbing ceased with magic suddenness.  \"Then you won't send him away?\"  \"Listen to me while I talk to you straight,\" said Joe Cumberland, \"and accordin' to the way you take it will depend whether Dan goes or stays. Will you listen?\"  \"Dear Dad, with all my heart!\"  \"Humph!\" he grunted, \"that's just what I don't want. This what I'm goin' to tell you is a queer thing--a mighty lot like a fairy tale, maybe. I've kept it back from you years an' years thinkin' you'd find out the truth about Dan for yourself. But bein' so close to him has made you sort of blind, maybe! No man will criticize his own hoss.\"  \"Go on, tell me what you mean. I won't interrupt.\"  He was silent for a moment, frowning to gather his thoughts.  \"Have you ever seen a mule, Kate?\"  \"Of course!\"  \"Maybe you've noticed that a mule is just as strong as a horse--\"  \"Yes.\"  \"--but their muscles ain't a third as big?\"  \"Yes, but what on earth--\"  \"Well, Kate, Dan is built light an' yet he's stronger than the biggest men around here.\"  \"Are you going to send him away simply because he's strong?\"  \"It doesn't show nothin',\" said the old man gently, \"savin' that he's different from the regular run of men--an' I've seen a considerable pile of men, honey. There's other funny things about Dan maybe you ain't noticed. Take the way he has with hosses an' other animals. The wildest man-killin', spur-hatin' bronchos don't put up no fight when them long legs of Dan settle round 'em.\"  \"Because they know fighting won't help them!\"  \"Maybe so, maybe so,\" he said quietly, \"but it's kind of queer, Kate, that after most a hundred men on the best hosses in these parts had ridden in relays after Satan an' couldn't lay a rope on him, Dan could jest go out on foot with a halter an' come back in ten days leadin' the wildest devil of a mustang that ever hated men.\"  \"It was a glorious thing to do!\" she said.  Old Cumberland sighed and then shook his head.  \"It shows more'n that, honey. There ain't any man but Dan that can sit the saddle on Satan. If Dan should die, Satan wouldn't be no more use to other men than a piece of haltered lightnin'. An' then tell me how Dan got hold of that wolf, Black Bart, as he calls him.\"  \"It isn't a wolf, Dad,\" said Kate, \"it's a dog. Dan says so himself.\"  \"Sure he says so,\" answered her father, \"but there was a lone wolf prowlin' round these parts for a considerable time an' raisin' Cain with the calves an' the colts. An' Black Bart comes pretty close to a description of the lone wolf. Maybe you remember Dan found his 'dog' lyin' in a gully with a bullet through his shoulder. If he was a dog how'd he come to be shot--\"  \"Some brute of a sheep herder may have done it. What could it prove?\"  \"It only proves that Dan is queer--powerful queer! Satan an' Black Bart are still as wild as they ever was, except that they got one master. An' they ain't got a thing to do with other people. Black Bart'd tear the heart out of a man that so much as patted his head.\"  \"Why,\" she cried, \"he'll let me do anything with him!\"  \"Humph!\" said Cumberland, a little baffled; \"maybe that's because Dan is kind of fond of you, gal, an' he has sort of introduced you to his pets, damn 'em! That's just the pint! How is he able to make his man-killers act sweet with you an' play the devil with everybody else.\"  \"It wasn't Dan at all!\" she said stoutly, \"and he _isn't_ queer. Satan and Black Bart let me do what I want with them because they know I love them for their beauty and their strength.\"  \"Let it go at that,\" growled her father. \"Kate, you're jest like your mother when it comes to arguin'. If you wasn't my little gal I'd say you was plain pig-headed. But look here, ain't you ever felt that Dan is what I call him--different? Ain't you ever seen him get mad--jest for a minute--an' watched them big brown eyes of his get all packed full of yellow light that chases a chill up and down your back like a wrigglin' snake?\"  She considered this statement in a little silence.  \"I saw him kill a rattler once,\" she said in a low voice. \"Dan caught him behind the head after he had struck. He did it with his bare hand! I almost fainted. When I looked again he had cut off the head of the snake. It was--it was terrible!\"  She turned to her father and caught him firmly by the shoulders.  \"Look me straight in the eye, Dad, and tell me just what you mean.\"  \"Why, Kate,\" said the wise old man, \"you're beginnin' to see for yourself what I'm drivin' at! Haven't you got somethin' else right on the tip of your tongue?\"  \"There was one day that I've never told you about,\" she said in a low voice, looking away, \"because I was afraid that if I told you, you'd shoot Black Bart. He was gnawing a big beef bone and just for fun I tried to take it away from him. He'd been out on a long trail with Dan and he was very hungry. When I put my hand on the bone he snapped. Luckily I had a thick glove on and he merely pinched my wrist. Also I think he realized what he was doing for otherwise he'd have cut through the glove as if it had been paper. He snarled fearfully and I sprang back with a cry. Dan hadn't seen what happened, but he heard the snarl and saw Black Bart's bared teeth. Then--oh, it was terrible!\"  She covered her face.  \"Take your time, Kate,\" said Cumberland softly.  \"'Bart,' called Dan,\" she went on, \"and there was such anger in his face that I think I was more afraid of him than of the big dog.  \"Bart turned to him with a snarl and bared his teeth. When Dan saw that his face turned--I don't know how to say it!\"  She stopped a moment and her hands tightened.  \"Back in his throat there came a sound that was almost like the snarl of Black Bart. The wolf-dog watched him with a terror that was uncanny to see, the hair around his neck fairly on end, his teeth still bared, and his growl horrible.  \"'Dan!' I called, 'don't go near him!'  \"I might as well have called out to a whirlwind. He leaped. Black Bart sprang to meet him with eyes green with fear. I heard the loud click of his teeth as he snapped--and missed. Dan swerved to one side and caught Black Bart by the throat and drove him into the dust, falling with him.  \"I couldn't move. I was weak with horror. It wasn't a struggle between a man and a beast. It was like a fight between a panther and a wolf. Black Bart was fighting hard but fighting hopelessly. Those hands were settling tighter on his throat. His big red tongue lolled out; his struggles almost ceased. Then Dan happened to glance at me. What he saw in my face sobered him. He got up, lifting the dog with him, and flung away the lifeless weight of Bart. He began to brush the dust from his clothes, looking down as if he were ashamed. He asked me if the dog had hurt me when he snapped. I could not speak for a moment. Then came the most horrible part. Black Bart, who must have been nearly killed, dragged himself to Dan on his belly, choking and whining, and licked the boots of his master!\"  \"Then you _do_ know what I mean when I say Dan is--different?\"  She hesitated and blinked, as if she were shutting her eyes on a fact. \"I _don't_ know. I know that he's gentle and kind and loves you more than you love him.\" Her voice broke a little. \"Oh, Dad, you forget the time he sat up with you for five days and nights when you got sick out in the hills, and how he barely managed to get you back to the house alive!\"  The old man frowned to conceal how greatly he was moved.  \"I haven't forgot nothin', Kate,\" he said, \"an' everything is for his own good. Do you know what I've been tryin' to do all these years?\"  \"What?\"  \"I've been tryin' to hide him from himself! Kate, do you remember how I found him?\"  \"I was too little to know. I've heard you tell a little about it. He was lost on the range. You found him twenty miles south of the house.\"  \"Lost on the range?\" repeated her father softly. \"I don't think he could ever have been lost. To a hoss the corral is a home. To us our ranch is a home. To Dan Barry the whole mountain-desert is a home! This is how I found him. It was in the spring of the year when the wild geese was honkin' as they flew north. I was ridin' down a gulley about sunset and wishin' that I was closer to the ranch when I heard a funny, wild sort of whistlin' that didn't have any tune to it that I recognized. It gave me a queer feelin'. It made me think of fairy stories--an' things like that! Pretty soon I seen a figure on the crest of the hill. There was a triangle of geese away up overhead an' the boy was walkin' along lookin' up as if he was followin' the trail of the wild geese.  \"He was up there walkin' between the sunset an' the stars with his head bent back, and his hands stuffed into his pockets, whistlin' as if he was goin' home from school. An' such whistlin'.\"  \"Nobody could ever whistle like Dan,\" she said, and smiled.  \"I rode up to him, wonderin',\" went on Cumberland.  \"'What're you doin' round here?' I says.  \"Says he, lookin' at me casual like over his shoulder: 'I'm jest takin' a stroll an' whistlin'. Does it bother you, mister?'  \"'It doesn't bother me none,' says I. 'Where do you belong, sonny?'  \"'Me?' says he, lookin' sort of surprised, 'why, I belong around over there!' An' he waved his hand careless over to the settin' sun.  \"There was somethin' about him that made my heart swell up inside of me. I looked down into them big brown eyes and wondered--well, I don't know what I wondered; but I remembered all at once that I didn't have no son.  \"'Who's your folks?' says I, gettin' more an' more curious.  \"He jest looked at me sort of bored.  \"'Where does your folks "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10886"],["title","The Untamed (#2)"],["body","at?' says I.  \"'Oh, they live around here,' says he, an' he waved his hand again, an' this time over towards the east.  \"Says I: 'When do you figure on reachin' home?'  \"'Oh, most any day,' says he.  \"An' I looked around at them brown, naked hills with the night comin' down over them. Then I stared back at the boy an' there was something that come up in me like hunger. You see, he was lost; he was alone; the queer ring of his whistlin' was still in my ears; an' I couldn't help rememberin' that I didn't have no son.  \"'Then supposin' you come along with me,' says I, 'an' I'll send you home in a buckboard tomorrow?'  \"So the end of it was me ridin' home with the little kid sittin' up before me, whistlin' his heart out! When I got him home I tried to talk to him again. He couldn't tell me, or he wouldn't tell me where his folks lived, but jest kept wavin' his hand liberal to half the points of the compass. An' that's all I know of where he come from. I done all I could to find his parents. I inquired and sent letters to every rancher within a hundred miles. I advertised it through the railroads, but they said nobody'd yet been reported lost. He was still mine, at least for a while, an' I was terrible glad.  \"I give the kid a spare room. I sat up late that first night listenin' to the wild geese honkin' away up in the sky an' wonderin' why I was so happy. Kate, that night there was tears in my eyes when I thought of how that kid had been out there on the hills walkin' along so happy an' independent.  \"But the next mornin' he was gone. I sent my cowpunchers out to look for him.  \"'Which way shall we ride?' they asked.  \"I don't know why, but I thought of the wild geese that Dan had seemed to be followin'.  \"'Ride north,' I said.  \"An' sure enough, they rode north an' found him. After that I didn't have no trouble with him about runnin' away--at least not durin' the summer. An' all those months I kept plannin' how I would take care of this boy who had come wanderin' to me. It seemed like he was sort of a gift of God to make up for me havin' no son. And everythin' went well until the next fall, when the geese began to fly south.  \"Sure enough, that was when Dan ran away again, and when I sent my cowpunchers south after him, they found him and brought him back. It seemed as if they'd brought back half the world to me, when I seen him. But I saw that I'd have to put a stop to this runnin' away. I tried to talk to him, but all he'd say was that he'd better be movin' on. I took the law in my hands an' told him he had to be disciplined. So I started thrashin' him with a quirt, very light. He took it as if he didn't feel the whip on his shoulders, an' he smiled. But there came up a yellow light in his eyes that made me feel as if a man was standin' right behind me with a bare knife in his hand an' smilin' jest like the kid was doin'. Finally I simply backed out of the room, an' since that day there ain't been man or beast ever has put a hand on Whistlin' Dan. To this day I reckon he ain't quite forgiven me.\"  \"Why!\" she cried, \"I have never heard him mention it!\"  \"That's why I know he's not forgotten it. Anyway, Kate, I locked him in his room, but he wouldn't promise not to run away. Then I got an inspiration. You was jest a little toddlin' thing then. That day you was cryin' an awful lot an' I suddenly thought of puttin' you in Dan's room. I did it. I jest unlocked the door quick and then shoved you in an' locked it again. First of all you screamed terrible hard. I was afraid maybe you'd hurt yourself yellin' that way. I was about to take you out again when all at once I heard Dan start whistlin' and pretty quick your cryin' stopped. I listened an' wondered. After that I never had to lock Dan in his room. I was sure he'd stay on account of you. But now, honey, I'm gettin' to the end of the story, an' I'm goin' to give you the straight idea the way I see it.  \"I've watched Dan like--like a father, almost. I think he loves me, sort of--but I've never got over being afraid of him. You see I can't forget how he smiled when I licked him! But listen to me, Kate, that fear has been with me all the time--an' it's the only time I've ever been afraid of any man. It isn't like being scared of a man, but of a panther.  \"Now we'll jest nacherally add up all the points we've made about Dan--the queer way I found him without a home an' without wantin' one--that strength he has that's like the power of a mule compared with a horse--that funny control he has over wild animals so that they almost seem to know what he means when he simply looks at them (have you noticed him with Black Bart and Satan?)--then there's the yellow light that comes in his eyes when he begins to get real mad--you an' I have both seen it only once, but we don't want to see it again! More than this there's the way he handles either a knife or a gun. He hasn't practiced much with shootin' irons, but I never seen him miss a reasonable mark--or an unreasonable one either, for that matter. I've spoke to him about it. He said: 'I dunno how it is. I don't see how a feller can shoot crooked. It jest seems that when I get out a gun there's a line drawn from the barrel to the thing I'm shootin' at. All I have to do is to pull the trigger--almost with my eyes closed!' Now, Kate, do you begin to see what these here things point to?\"  \"Tell me what you see,\" she said, \"and then I'll tell you what I think of it all.\"  \"All right,\" he said. \"I see in Dan a man who's different from the common run of us. I read in a book once that in the ages when men lived like animals an' had no weapons except sticks and stones, their muscles must have been two or three times as strong as they are now--more like the muscles of brutes. An' their hearin' an' their sight an' their quickness an' their endurance was about three times more than that of ordinary men. Kate, I think that Dan is one of those men the book described! He knows animals because he has all the powers that they have. An' I know from the way his eyes go yellow that he has the fightin' instinct of the ancestors of man. So far I've kept him away from other men. Which I may say is the main reason I bought Dan Morgan's place so's to keep fightin' men away from our Whistlin' Dan. So I've been hidin' him from himself. You see, he's my boy if he belongs to anybody. Maybe when time goes on he'll get tame. But I reckon not. It's like takin' a panther cub--or a wolf pup--an tryin' to raise it for a pet. Some day it gets the taste of blood, maybe its own blood, an' then it goes mad and becomes a killer. An' that's what I fear, Kate. So far I've kept Dan from ever havin' a single fight, but I reckon the day'll come when someone'll cross him, and then there'll be a tornado turned loose that'll jest about wreck these parts.\"  Her anger had grown during this speech. Now she rose.  \"I won't believe you, Dad,\" she said. \"I'd sooner trust our Dan than any man alive. I don't think you're right in a single word!\"  \"I was sure loco,\" sighed Cumberland, \"to ever dream of convincin' a woman. Let it drop, Kate. We're about to get rid of Morgan's place, an' now I reckon there won't be any temptation near Dan. We'll see what time'll do for him. Let the thing drop there. Now I'm goin' over to the Bar XO outfit an' I won't be back till late tonight. There's only one thing more. I told Morgan there wasn't to be any gun-play in his place today. If you hear any shootin' go down there an' remind Morgan to take the guns off'n the men.\"  Kate nodded, but her stare travelled far away, and the thing she saw was the yellow light burning in the eyes of Whistling Dan.     CHAPTER III   SILENT SHOOTS  It was a great day and also a sad one for Morgan. His general store and saloon had been bought out by old Joe Cumberland, who declared a determination to clear up the landscape, and thereby plunged the cowpunchers in gloom. They partially forgave Cumberland, but only because he was an old man. A younger reformer would have met armed resistance. Morgan's place was miles away from the next oasis in the desert and the closing meant dusty, thirsty leagues of added journey to every man in the neighbourhood. The word \"neighbourhood,\" of course, covered a territory fifty miles square.  If the day was very sad for this important reason, it was also very glad, for rustling Morgan advertised the day of closing far and wide, and his most casual patrons dropped all business to attend the big doings. A long line of buckboards and cattle ponies surrounded the place. Newcomers gallopped in every few moments. Most of them did not stop to tether their mounts, but simply dropped the reins over the heads of the horses and then went with rattling spurs and slouching steps into the saloon. Every man was greeted by a shout, for one or two of those within usually knew him, and when they raised a cry the others joined in for the sake of good fellowship. As a rule he responded by ordering everyone up to the bar.  One man, however, received no more greeting than the slamming of the door behind him. He was a tall, handsome fellow with tawny hair and a little smile of habit rather than mirth upon his lips. He had ridden up on a strong bay horse, a full two hands taller than the average cattle pony, and with legs and shoulders and straight back that unmistakably told of a blooded pedigree. When he entered the saloon he seemed nowise abashed by the silence, but greeted the turned heads with a wave of the hand and a good-natured \"Howdy, boys!\" A volley of greetings replied to him, for in the mountain-desert men cannot be strangers after the first word.  \"Line up and hit the red-eye,\" he went on, and leaning against the bar as he spoke, his habitual smile broadened into one of actual invitation. Except for a few groups who watched the gambling in the corners of the big room, there was a general movement towards the bar.  \"And make it a tall one, boys,\" went on the genial stranger. \"This is the"]]]
