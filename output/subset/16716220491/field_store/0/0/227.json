I would rather be mad than to fear things like that.  1st Sentry: [looking straight before him]  Hush.      [Enter King and retinue. He sits on the throne. Enter from     other side Ichtharion, Ludibras, and Harpagas, each with his     wife beside him, hand in hand. Each couple bows before the     King, still hand in hand; then they seat themselves. The King     nods once to each couple.]  King: [To Tharmia]  Well, your Sincerity, I trust that you are glad to have come to Thek.  Tharmia:  Very glad, your Majesty.  King: [To Arolind]  This is pleasanter, is it not, than Barbul-el-Sharnak?  Arolind:  Far pleasanter, your Majesty.  King:  And you, princely lady Carolyx, find all that you need in Thek?  Carolyx: More than all, your Majesty.  King: [To Harpagas]  Then we can stay here long, can we not?  Harpagas:  There are reasons of State why that were dangerous.  King:  Reasons of State? Why should we not stay here?  Harpagas:  Your Majesty, there is a legend in the World, that he who is greatest in the city of Barbul-el-Sharnak is the greatest in the world.  King:  I had not heard that legend.  Harpagas:  Your Majesty, little legends do not hive in the sacred ears of kings; nevertheless they hum among lesser men from generation to generation.  King:  I will not go for a legend to Barbul-el-Sharnak.  Harpagas:  Your Majesty, it is very dangerous....  King: [To Ladies]  We will discuss things of State which little interest your Sincerities.  Tharmia: [rising]  Your Majesty, we are ignorant of these things.      [Exeunt.]  King: [To Ichtharion and Ludibras]  We will rest from things of State for awhile, shall we not? We will be happy, (shall we not?) in this ancient beautiful palace.  Ludibras:  If your Majesty commands, we must obey.  King:  But is not Thek most beautiful? Are not the jungle orchids a wonder and a glory?  Ludibras:  They have been thought so, your Majesty; they were pretty in Barbul-el-Sharnak where they were rare.  King:  But when the sun comes over them in the morning, when the dew is on them still; are they not glorious then? Indeed, they are very glorious.  Ludibras:  I think they would be glorious if they were blue, and there were fewer of them.  King:  I do not think so. But you, Ichtharion, you think the city beautiful?  Ichtharion:  Yes, your Majesty.  King:  Ah. I am glad you love it. It is to me adorable.  Ichtharion:  I do not love it, your Majesty. I hate it very much. I know it is beautiful because your Majesty has said so.  Ludibras:  This city is dangerously unhealthy, your Majesty.  Harpagas:  It is dangerous to be absent from Barbul-el-Sharnak.  Ichtharion:  We implore your Majesty to return to the centre of the world.  King:  I will not go again to Barbul-el-Sharnak.      [Exeunt King with attendants. Ichtharion, Ludibras and Harpagas     remain.]      [Enter Arolind and Carolyx; each goes up to her husband, very     affectionate.]  Arolind:  And you talked to the King?  Ludibras:  Yes.  Arolind:  You told him he must go back to Barbul-el-Sharnak at once?  Ludibras:  Well, I----  Arolind:  When does he start?  Ludibras:  He did not say he will start.  Arolind:  What?  Carolyx:  We are not going?      [Arolind and Carolyx weep and step away from their husbands.]  Ludibras:  But we spoke to the King.  Arolind:  O, we must stay and die here.  Ludibras:  But we did what we could.  Arolind:  O, I shall be buried in Thek.  Ludibras:  I can do no more.  Arolind:  My clothes are torn, my hair is old. I am in rags.  Ludibras:  I am sure you are beautifully dressed.  Arolind: [full height]  Beautifully dressed! Of course I am beautifully dressed! But who is there to see me? I am alone in the jungle, and here I shall be buried.  Ludibras:  But----  Arolind:  Oh, will you not leave me alone? Is nothing sacred to you? Not even my grief?      [Exeunt Arolind and Carolyx.]  Harpagas: [To Ludibras]  What are we to do?  Ludibras:  All women are alike.  Ichtharion:  I do not allow my wife to speak to me like that.      [Exeunt Harpagas and Ludibras.]  I hope Tharmia will not weep; it is very distressing to see a woman in tears.      [Enter Tharmia.]  Do not be unhappy, do not be at all unhappy. But I have been unable to persuade the King to return to Barbul-el-Sharnak. You will be happy here after a little while.  Tharmia: [breaks into loud laughter]  _You_ are the King's adviser. Ha-ha-ha! _You_ are the Grand High Vizier of the Court. Ha-ha-ha. _You_ are the warder of the golden wand. Ha-ha-ha O, go and throw biscuits to the King's dog.  Ichtharion:  What!  Tharmia:  Throw little ginger biscuits to the King's dog. Perhaps he will obey you. Perhaps you will have some influence with the King's dog if you feed him with little biscuits. You----      [Laughs and exits. Ichtharion sits with his miserable head in his     hands.]      [Reenter Ludibras and Harpagas.]  Ludibras:  Has her Sincerity, the princely Lady Tharmia, been speaking with you?  Ichtharion:  She spoke a few words.      [Ludibras and Harpagas sigh.]  We must leave Thek. We must depart from Thek.  Ludibras:  What, without the King?  Harpagas:  No.  Ichtharion:  No. They would say in Barbul-el-Sharnak \"these were once at Court,\" and men that we have flogged would spit in our faces.  Ludibras:  Who can command a King?  Harpagas:  Only the gods.  Ludibras:  The gods? There are no gods now. We have been civilised over three thousand years. The gods that nursed our infancy are dead, or gone to nurse younger nations.  Ichtharion:  I refuse the listen to---- O, the sentries are gone. No, the gods are no use to us; they were driven away by the decadence.  Harpagas:  We are not in the decadence here. Barbul-el-Sharnak is in a different age. The city of Thek is scarcely civilised.  Ichtharion:  But everybody lives in Barbul-el-Sharnak.  Harpagas:  The gods----  Ludibras:  The old prophet is coming.  Harpagas:  He believes as much in the gods as you or I do.  Ludibras:  Yes, but we must not speak as though we knew that.      [Voice-of-the-Gods (a prophet) walks across the stage.]  Ichtharion, Ludibras, and Harpagas: [rising]  The gods are good.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  They are benignant. [exit]  Ichtharion:  Listen! Let him prophesy to the King. Let him bid the King go hence lest they smite the city.  Ludibras:  Can we make him do it?  Ichtharion:  I think we can make him do it.  Harpagas:  The King is more highly civilised even than we are. He will not care for the gods.  Ichtharion:  He cannot ignore them; the gods crowned his forefather and if there are no gods who made him King?  Ludibras:  Why, that is true. He must obey a prophecy.  Ichtharion:  If the King disobeys the gods the people will tear him asunder, whether the gods created the people or the people created the gods.      [Harpagas slips out after the Prophet.]  Ludibras:  If the King discovers this we shall be painfully tortured.  Ichtharion:  How can the King discover it?  Ludibras:  He knows that there are no gods.  Ichtharion:  No man knows that of a certainty.  Ludibras:  But if there are----!      [Enter Prophet with Harpagas. Ichtharion quickly sends Ludibras and     Harpagas away.]  Ichtharion:  There is a delicate matter concerning the King.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  Then I can help you little for I only serve the gods.  Ichtharion:  It also concerns the gods.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  Ah. Then I hearken.  Ichtharion:  This city is for the King, whose body is fragile, a very unhealthy city. Moreover, there is no work here that a King can profitably do. Also it is dangerous for Barbul-el-Sharnak to be long without a King, lest----  Voice-of-the-Gods:  Does this concern the gods?  Ichtharion:  In this respect it does concern the gods--that if the gods knew this they would warn the King by inspiring you to make a prophecy. As they do not know this----  Voice-of-the-Gods:  The gods know all things.  Ichtharion:  The gods do not know things that are not true. This is not strictly true----  Voice-of-the-Gods:  It is written and hath been said that the gods cannot lie.  Ichtharion:  The gods of course cannot lie, but a prophet may sometimes utter a prophecy that is a good prophecy and helpful to men, thereby pleasing the gods, although the prophecy is not a true one.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  The gods speak through my mouth; my breath is my own breath, I am human and mortal, but my voice is from the gods and the gods cannot lie.  Ichtharion:  Is it wise in an age when the gods have lost their power to anger powerful men for the sake of the gods?  Voice-of-the-Gods:  It _is_ wise.  Ichtharion:  We are three men and you are alone with us. Will the gods save you if we want to put you to death and slip away with your body into the jungle?  Voice-of-the-Gods:  If you should do this thing the gods have willed it. If they have not willed it you cannot.  Ichtharion:  We do not wish to do it. Nevertheless you will make this prophecy--you will go before the King and you will say that the gods have spoken and that within three days' time, for the sake of vengeance upon some unknown man who is in this city, they will overthrow all Thek unless every man is departed.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  I will not do it, for the gods cannot lie.  Ichtharion:  Has it not been the custom since unremembered time for a prophet to have two wives?  Voice-of-the-Gods:  Most certainly. It is the law.      [Ichtharion holds up three fingers.]  What!  Ichtharion:  Three.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  Do not betray me. It was long ago.  Ichtharion:  You will be allowed to serve the gods no more if men know this. The gods will not protect you in this matter for you have offended also against the gods.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  It is worse that the gods should lie. Do not betray me.  Ichtharion:  I go to tell the others what I know.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  I will make"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11283"],["title","Plays of Gods and Men (#2)"],["body","false prophecy.  Ichtharion:  Ah. You have chosen wisely.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  When the gods punish me who make them lie, they will know what punishment to give to you.  Ichtharion:  The gods will not punish us. It is long ago that the gods used to punish men.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  The gods will punish us.  Act II      [Same scene.]      [Same day.]  King Karnos: [pointing off L.]  Look at them now, are they not beautiful? They catch the last rays of the lingering sun. Can you say that the orchids are not beautiful now?  Ichtharion:  Your majesty, we were wrong, they are most beautiful. They tower up from the jungle to take the sun. They are like the diadem of some jubilant king.  King Karnos:  Ah. Now you have come to love the beauty of Thek.  Ichtharion:  Yes, yes, your Majesty, I see it now. I would live in this city always.  King Karnos:  Yes, we will live here always. There is no city lovelier than Thek. Am I not right?  Ludibras:  Your Majesty, no city is like it.  King Karnos:  Ah. I am always right.  Tharmia:  How beautiful is Thek.  Arolind:  Yes, it is like a god.      [Three notes are stricken on a sonorous gong.]  Whispers: [on]  There has been a prophecy. There has been a prophecy.  King Karnos:  Ah! there has been a prophecy. Bring in the prophet. [Exit attendant.]      [Enter mournfully with dejected head and walking very slowly      Voice-of-the-Gods.]  King Karnos:  You have made a prophecy.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  I have made a prophecy.  King Karnos:  I would hear that prophecy. [A pause.]  Voice-of-the-Gods:  Your Majesty, the gods in three days' time----  King Karnos:  Stop! Is it not usual to begin with certain words? [A pause.]  Voice-of-the-Gods:  It is written and hath been said... that the gods cannot lie.  King Karnos:  That is right.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  That the gods cannot lie.  King Karnos:  Yes. Yes.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  In three days' time the gods will destroy this city for vengeance upon some man, unless all men desert it.  King Karnos:  The gods will destroy Thek!  Voice-of-the-Gods:  Yes.  King Karnos:  When will this happen?  Voice-of-the-Gods:  It must be in three days' time.  King Karnos:  How will it happen?  Voice-of-the-Gods:  Why. It will happen.  King Karnos:  How?  Voice-of-the-Gods:  Why... there will be a sound... as the riving of wood... a sound as of thunder coming up from the ground. A cleft will run like a mouse across the floor. There will be a red light, and then no light at all, and in the darkness Thek shall tumble in.      [The King sits in deep thought. Exit Prophet slowly; he begins to     weep, then casts his cloak over his face. He stretches out his arms     to grope his way and is led by the hand. The King sits thinking.]  Tharmia:  Save us, your Majesty.  Arolind:  Save us.  Ichtharion:  We must fly, your Majesty.  Ludibras:  We must escape swiftly.      [The King sits still in silence. He lifts a stick on his     right to beat a little silver bell; but puts it down again. At     last he lifts it up and strikes the bell. An Attendant     enters.]  King Karnos:  Bring back that prophet. [Attendant bows and exits.]      [The King looks thoughtful. The rest have a frightened     look. Re-enter Prophet.]  King Karnos:  When the gods prophesy rain in the season of rain, or the death of an old man, we believe them. But when the gods prophesy something incredible and ridiculous, such as happens not nowadays, and hath not been heard of since the fall of Bleth, then our credulity is overtaxed. It is possible that a man should lie; it is not possible that the gods should destroy a city nowadays.  Voice-of-the-Gods:  O King, have mercy.  King Karnos:  What, would you be sent safe away while your King is destroyed by the gods?  Voice-of-the-Gods:  No, no, your Majesty. I would stay in the city, your Majesty. But if the gods do not destroy the city, if the gods have misled me.  King Karnos:  If the gods have misled you they have chosen your doom. Why ask for mercy from me?  Voice-of-the-Gods:  If the gods have misled me, and punish me no further, I ask mercy from you, O King.  King Karnos:  If the gods have misled you, let the gods protect you from my executioner.  1st Sentry: [Laughs aside to 2nd Sentry]  Very witty.  2nd Sentry:  Yes, yes. [Laughs too.]  King Karnos:  If the doom fall not at sunset, why then the executioner----  Voice-of-the-Gods:  Your Majesty!  King Karnos:  No more! No doubt the gods will destroy the whole city at sunset.      [The sentries titter. The Prophet is led away.]  Ichtharion:  Your Majesty! Is it safe to kill a prophet, even for any guilt? Will not the people----  King Karnos:  Not while he is a prophet; but if he has prophesied falsely his death is due to the gods. The people once even burned a prophet themselves because he had taken three wives.  Ichtharion: [Aside to Ludibras]  It is most unfortunate, but what can we do?  Ludibras: [Aside to Ichtharion]  He will not be killed if he betray us instead.  Ichtharion: [Aside]  Why... that is true.      [All are whispering.]  King Karnos:  Why do you whisper?  Tharmia:  Your Majesty, we fear that the gods will destroy us all and...  King Karnos:  You do not fear it?      [Dead silence. A plaintive lament off. Enter the Queen. Her     face is pale as paper.]  Queen: [loq.]  O your Majesty. Your Majesty. I have heard the lutanist, I have heard the lutanist.  King Karnos:  She means the lute that is heard by those about to die.  Queen:  I have heard Gog-Owza, the lutanist, playing his lute. And I shall die, O I shall die.  King Karnos:  No. No. No. You have not heard Gog-Owza. Send for her maidens, send for the Queen's maidens.  Queen:  I have heard Gog-Owza playing, and I shall die.  King Karnos:  Hark. Why, I hear it too. That is not Gog-Owza, it is only a man with a lute; I hear it too.  Queen:  O the King hears it too. The King will die. The great King will die. My child will be desolate for the King will die. Mourn, people of the jungle. Mourn, citizens of Thek. And thou, O Barbul-el-Sharnak, O metropolitan city, mourn thou in the midst of the nations, for the great King will die.  King Karnos:  No. No. No. [To oldest present.] Listen you. Do you not hear it?  The Oldest:  Yes, your Majesty.  King Karnos:  You see it is a real lute. That is no spirit playing.  Queen:  O but he is old; in a few days he will die; it is Gog-Owza, and the King will die.  King Karnos:  No, no, it is only a man. Look out of the window there. [To any Young Man.]  The Young Man:  It is dark, your Majesty, and I cannot see.  Queen:  It is the spirit Gog-Owza.  The Young Man:  I can hear the music clearly.  King Karnos:  He is young.  Queen:  The young are always in danger; they go about among swords. He will die too and the great King and I. In a few days we will be buried.  King Karnos:  Let us all listen; we cannot all die in a few days' time.  Tharmia:  I hear it clearly.  Queen:  Women are blossoms in the hand of Death. They are often close to Death. She will die too.  All:  I hear it. I hear it. And I. And I. And I. It is only a man with a lute.  Queen: [pacified]  I should like to see him, then I should know for certain.      [She looks out of the casement.]  No, it is too dark.  King Karnos:  We will call the man if you wish it.  Queen:  Yes, I shall be easy then, and then I shall sleep.      [King instructs Attendants to enquire without. Queen at window still.]  King Karnos:  It is some man down by the river playing his lute. I am told that sometimes a man will play all night.  Tharmia: [Aside]  That's their amusement here.  Arolind: [Aside]  Well, really, its almost all the music we get.  Tharmia: [Aside]  It really is.  Arolind: [Aside]  O how I cry for the golden Hall of Song in Barbul-el-Sharnak. I think it would almost hold the city of Thek.      [Re-enter Attendant]  Attendant:  It is only a common lute, your Majesty. All hear it except one man.  King Karnos:  All except one, did you say? Ah, thank you.      [To Queen at window.]  It is only a common lute.  Queen:  One man did not hear it. Who was he? Where is he? Why didn't he?  Attendant:  He was riding back again to Barbul-el-Sharnak. He was just starting. He said he did not hear it.  Queen:  Oh, send for him here.  Attendant:  He is gone, your Majesty.  Queen:  Overtake him quick. Overtake him.      [Exit Attendant.]  Tharmia: [Aside to Arolind]  I wish that I were going back to Barbul-el-Sharnak.  Arolind:  O to be again at the centre of the world!  Tharmia:  Were we not talking of the golden hall?  Arolind:  Ah, yes. How lovely it was! How beautiful it was when the King was there and strange musicians came from the heathen lands with huge plumes in their hair, and played on instruments that we did not know.  Tharmia:  The Queen was better then. The music eased her.  Arolind:  This lute player is making her quite mad.  Tharmia:  Well. Well. No wonder. He has a mournful sound. Listen!  Arolind:  Do not let us listen. It makes me feel cold.  Tharmia:  He cannot play like Nagra or dear Trehannion. It is because we have heard Trehannion that we do not like to listen.  Arolind:  I do not like to listen because I feel cold.  Tharmia:  We feel cold because the Queen has opened the casement.  King Karnos: [To Attendant]  Find the man that is playing the lute and give him this and let him cease to play upon his lute.      [Exit Attendant]  Ichtharion:  Hark! He is playing still.  King Karnos:  Yes, we all hear him; it is only a man.      [To another or same Attendant]  Let him stop playing.  Attendant:  Yes, your Majesty. [Exit]      [Enter an Attendant with another]  Attendant:  This is the man that does not hear the lute.  King Karnos:  Ah. You are deaf, then, are you not?  Man:  No, your Majesty.  King Karnos:  You hear me clearly?  Man:  Yes, your Majesty.  King Karnos:  Listen! ...Now you hear the lute?  Man:  No, your Majesty.  King Karnos:  Who sent you to Barbul-el-Sharnak?  Man:  The captain of the camel-guard sent me, your Majesty."]]]
