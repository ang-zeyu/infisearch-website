With sharp thongs adroop the junior one awaits The word to uplift.           “Untie him—so! Submission is enough, Man, you may go.” Then, promenading aft, brushing fat Purser Smart, “Flog? Never meant it—hadn’t any heart. Degrade that tall fellow? “—Such, wife, was he, Old Captain Turret, who the brave wine could stow. Magnanimous, you think?—But what does Dick see? Apron to your eye! Why, never fell a blow; Cheer up, old wifie, ’t was a long time ago.  But where’s that sore one, crabbed and-severe, Lieutenant Lon Lumbago, an arch scrutineer? Call the roll to-day, would he answer—_Here!_ When the _Blixum’s_ fellows to quarters mustered How he’d lurch along the lane of gun-crews clustered, Testy as touchwood, to pry and to peer. Jerking his sword underneath larboard arm, He ground his worn grinders to keep himself calm. Composed in his nerves, from the fidgets set free, Tell, Sweet Wrinkles, alive now is he, In Paradise a parlor where the even tempers be?  Where’s Commander All-a-Tanto? Where’s Orlop Bob singing up from below? Where’s Rhyming Ned? has he spun his last canto? Where’s Jewsharp Jim? Where’s Ringadoon Joe? Ah, for the music over and done, The band all dismissed save the droned trombone! Where’s Glenn o’ the gun-room, who loved Hot-Scotch— Glen, prompt and cool in a perilous watch? Where’s flaxen-haired Phil? a gray lieutenant? Or rubicund, flying a dignified pennant?  But where sleeps his brother?—the cruise it was o’er, But ah, for death’s grip that welcomed him ashore! Where’s Sid, the cadet, so frank in his brag, Whose toast was audacious—“_Here’s Sid, and Sid’s flag!_” Like holiday-craft that have sunk unknown, May a lark of a lad go lonely down? Who takes the census under the sea? Can others like old ensigns be, Bunting I hoisted to flutter at the gaff— Rags in end that once were flags Gallant streaming from the staff?  Such scurvy doom could the chances deal To Top-Gallant Harry and Jack Genteel? Lo, Genteel Jack in hurricane weather, Shagged like a bear, like a red lion roaring; But O, so fine in his chapeau and feather, In port to the ladies never once _jawing;_ All bland _politesse,_ how urbane was he— _“Oui, mademoiselle”—“Ma chère amie!”_  ’T was Jack got up the ball at Naples, Gay in the old _Ohio_ glorious; His hair was curled by the berth-deck barber, Never you’d deemed him a cub of rude Boreas; In tight little pumps, with the grand dames in rout, A-flinging his shapely foot all about; His watch-chain with love’s jeweled tokens abounding, Curls ambrosial shaking out odors, Waltzing along the batteries, astounding The gunner glum and the grim-visaged loaders.  Wife, where be all these blades, I wonder, Pennoned fine fellows, so strong, so gay? Never their colors with a dip dived under; Have they hauled them down in a lack-lustre day, Or beached their boats in the Far, Far Away? Hither and thither, blown wide asunder, Where’s this fleet, I wonder and wonder. Slipt their cables, rattled their adieu, (Whereaway pointing? to what rendezvous?) Out of sight, out of mind, like the crack _Constitution,_ And many a keel time never shall renew— _Bon Homme Dick_ o’ the buff Revolution, The _Black Cockade_ and the staunch _True-Blue._  Doff hats to Decatur! But where is his blazon? Must merited fame endure time’s wrong— Glory’s ripe grape wizen up to a raisin? Yes! for Nature teems, and the years are strong, And who can keep the tally o’ the names that fleet along!  But his frigate, wife, his bride? Would blacksmiths brown Into smithereens smite the solid old renown? Rivetting the bolts in the iron-clad’s shell, Hark to the hammers with _a rat-tat-tat;_ “Handier a _derby_ than a laced cocked hat! The _Monitor_ was ugly, but she served us right well, Better than the _Cumberland,_ a beauty and the belle.”  _Better than the Cumberland!_—Heart alive in me! That battlemented hull, Tantallon o’ the sea, Kicked in, as at Boston the taxed chests o’ tea! Ay, spurned by the _ram,_ once a tall, shapely craft, But lopped by the Rebs to an iron-beaked raft— A blacksmith’s unicorn in armor _cap-a-pie_.  Under the water-line a _ram’s_ blow is dealt: And foul fall the knuckles that strike below the belt. Nor brave the inventions that serve to replace The openness of valor while dismantling the grace.  Aloof from all this and the never-ending game, Tantamount to teetering, plot and counterplot; Impenetrable armor—all-perforating shot; Aloof, bless God, ride the war-ships of old, A grand fleet moored in the roadstead of fame; Not submarine sneaks with _them_ are enrolled; Their long shadows dwarf us, their flags are as flame.  Don’t fidget so, wife; an old man’s passion Amounts to no more than this smoke that I puff; There, there, now, buss me in good old fashion; A died-down candle will flicker in the snuff.  But one last thing let your old babbler say, What Decatur’s coxswain said who was long ago hearsed, “Take in your flying-kites, for there comes a lubber’s day When gallant things will go, and the three-deckers first.”  My pipe is smoked out, and the grog runs slack; But bowse away, wife, at your blessed Bohea; This empty can here must needs solace me— Nay, sweetheart, nay; I take that back; Dick drinks from your eyes and he finds no lack!     TOM DEADLIGHT   During a tempest encountered homeward-bound from the Mediterranean, a grizzled petty-officer, one of the two captains of the forecastle, dying at night in his hammock, swung in the sick-bay under the tiered gun-decks of the British _Dreadnaught, 98,_ wandering in his mind, though with glimpses of sanity, and starting up at whiles, sings by snatches his good-bye and last injunctions to two messmates, his watchers, one of whom fans the fevered tar with the flap of his old sou’wester. Some names and phrases, with here and there a line, or part of one; these, in his aberration, wrested into incoherency from their original connection and import, he voluntarily derives, as he does the measure, from a famous old sea-ditty, whose cadences, long rife, and now humming in the collapsing brain, attune the last flutterings of distempered thought.  Farewell and adieu to you noble hearties,—     Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain, For I’ve received orders for to sail for the Deadman,     But hope with the grand fleet to see you again.  I have hove my ship to, with main-top-sail aback, boys;     I have hove my ship to, for the strike soundings clear— The black scud a’flying; but, by God’s blessing, dam’ me,     Right up the Channel for the Deadman I’ll steer.  I have worried through the waters that are called the Doldrums,     And growled at Sargasso that clogs while ye grope— Blast my eyes, but the light-ship is hid by the mist, lads:—     _Flying Dutchman_—odds bobbs—off the Cape of Good Hope!  But what’s this I feel that is fanning my cheek, Matt?     The white goney’s wing?—how she rolls!— ’t is the Cape!— Give my kit to the mess, Jock, for kin none is mine, none;     And tell _Holy Joe_ to avast with the crape.  Dead reckoning, says _Joe_, it won’t do to go by;     But they doused all the glims, Matt, in sky t’ other night. Dead reckoning is good for to sail for the Deadman;     And Tom Deadlight he thinks it may reckon near right.  The signal!—it streams for the grand fleet to anchor.     The captains—the trumpets—the hullabaloo! Stand by for blue-blazes, and mind your shank-painters,     For the Lord High Admiral, he’s squinting at you!  But give me my _tot_, Matt, before I roll over;     Jock, let’s have your flipper, it’s good for to feel; And don’t sew me up without _baccy_ in mouth, boys,     And don’t blubber like lubbers when I turn up my keel.     JACK ROY   Kept up by relays of generations young Never dies at halyards the blithe chorus sung; While in sands, sounds, and seas where the storm-petrels cry, Dropped mute around the globe, these halyard singers lie. Short-lived the clippers for racing-cups that run, And speeds in life’s career many a lavish mother’s-son.  But thou, manly king o’ the old _Splendid’s_ crew, The ribbons o’ thy hat still a-fluttering, should fly— A challenge, and forever, nor the bravery should rue. Only in a tussle for the starry flag high, When ’tis piety to do, and privilege to die. Then, only then, would heaven think to lop Such a cedar as the captain o’ the _Splendid’s_ main-top: A belted sea-gentleman; a gallant, off-hand Mercutio indifferent in life’s gay command. Magnanimous in humor; when the splintering shot fell, “Tooth-picks a-plenty, lads; thank ’em with a shell!”  Sang Larry o’ the _Cannakin,_ smuggler o’ the wine, At mess between guns, lad in jovial recline: “In Limbo our Jack he would chirrup up a cheer, The martinet there find a chaffing mutineer; From a thousand fathoms down under hatches o’ your Hades, He’d ascend in love-ditty, kissing fingers to your ladies!”  Never relishing the knave, though allowing for the menial, Nor overmuch the king, Jack, nor prodigally genial. Ashore on liberty he flashed in escapade, Vaulting over life in its levelness of grade, Like the dolphin off Africa in rainbow a-sweeping— Arch iridescent shot from seas languid sleeping.  Larking with thy life, if a joy but a toy, Heroic in thy levity wert thou, Jack Roy.     SEA PIECES     THE HAGLETS   By chapel bare, with walls sea-beat The lichened urns in wilds are lost About a carved memorial stone That shows, decayed and coral-mossed, A form recumbent, swords at feet, Trophies at head, and kelp for a winding-sheet.  I invoke thy ghost, neglected fane, Washed by the waters’ long lament; I adjure the recumbent effigy To tell the cenotaph’s intent— Reveal why fagotted swords are at feet, Why trophies appear and weeds are the winding-sheet.  By open ports the Admiral sits, And shares repose with guns that tell Of power that smote the arm’d Plate Fleet Whose sinking flag-ship’s colors fell; But over the Admiral floats in light His squadron’s flag, the red-cross Flag of the White.

I would have it known that I can well trust him to write even as I speak, though he has full leave to set aside all hard words and unseemly, such as a sailor is apt to use unawares; and where my Danish way of speaking goeth not altogether with the English, he may alter the wording as he will, so long as the sense is always the same. Then, also, will he read over to me what he has written, and therefore all may be sure that this is indeed my true story.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Now, as it is needful that one begins at the beginning, it happens that the first thing to be told is how I came to be Havelok's foster-brother, and that seems like beginning with myself after all. But all the story hangs on this, and so there is no help for it.  If it is asked when this beginning might be, I would say, for an Englishman who knows not the names of Danish kings, that it was before the first days of the greatness of Ethelbert of Kent, the overlord of all England, the Bretwalda, and therefore, as Father Wislac counts, about the year of grace 580. But King Ethelbert does not come into the story, nor does the overlord of all Denmark; for the kings of whom I must speak were under-kings, though none the less kingly for all that. One must ever be the mightiest of many; and, as in England, there were at that time many kings in Denmark, some over wide lands and others over but small realms, with that one who was strong enough to make the rest pay tribute to him as overlord, and only keeping that place by the power of the strong hand, not for any greater worth.  Our king on the west coast of Denmark, where the story of Havelok the Dane must needs begin, was Gunnar Kirkeban--so called because, being a heathen altogether, as were we all in Denmark at that time, he had been the bane of many churches in the western isles of Scotland, and in Wales and Ireland, and made a boast thereof. However, that cruelty of his was his own bane in the end, as will be seen. Otherwise he was a well-loved king and a great warrior, tall, and stronger than any man in Denmark, as was said. His wife, the queen, was a foreigner, but the fairest of women. Her name was Eleyn, and from this it was thought that she came from the far south. Certainly Gunnar had brought her back from Gardariki,[2] whither he had gone on a trading journey one year. Gunnar and she had two daughters and but one son, and that son was Havelok, at this time seven years old.  Next to the king came our own lord, Jarl Sigurd, older than Gunnar, and his best counsellor, though in the matter of sparing harmless and helpless church folk his advice was never listened to. His hall was many miles from the king's place, southward down the coast.  Here, too, lived my father, Grim, with us in a good house which had been his father's before him. Well loved by Jarl Sigurd was Grim, who had ever been his faithful follower, and was the best seaman in all the town. He was also the most skilful fisher on our coasts, being by birth a well-to-do freeman enough, and having boats of his own since he could first sail one. At one time the jarl had made him steward of his house; but the sea drew him ever, and he waxed restless away from it. Therefore, after a time, he asked the jarl's leave to take to the sea again, and so prospered in the fishery that at last he bought a large trading buss from the Frisian coast, and took to the calling of the merchant.  So for some years my father, stout warrior as he proved himself in many a fight at his lord's side, traded peacefully---that is, so long as men would suffer him to do so; for it happened more than once that his ship was boarded by Vikings, who in the end went away, finding that they had made a mistake in thinking that they had found a prize in a harmless trader, for Grim was wont to man his ship with warriors, saying that what was worth trading was worth keeping. I mind me how once he came to England with a second cargo, won on the high seas from a Viking's plunder, which the Viking brought alongside our ship, thinking to add our goods thereto. Things went the other way, and we left him only an empty ship, which maybe was more than he would have spared to us. That was on my second voyage, when I was fifteen.  Mostly my father traded to England, for there are few of the Saxon kin who take ship for themselves, and the havens to which he went were Tetney and Saltfleet, on the Lindsey shore of Humber, where he soon had friends.  So Grim prospered and waxed rich fast, and in the spring of the year wherein the story begins was getting the ship ready for the first cruise of the season, meaning to be afloat early; for then there was less trouble with the wild Norse Viking folk, for one cruise at least. Then happened that which set all things going otherwise than he had planned, and makes my story worth telling.  We---that is my father Grim, Leva my mother, my two brothers and myself, and our two little sisters, Gunhild and Solva---sat quietly in our great room, busy at one little thing or another, each in his way, before the bright fire that burned on the hearth in the middle of the floor. There was no trouble at all for us to think of more than that the wind had held for several weeks in the southwest and northwest, and we wondered when it would shift to its wonted springtide easting, so that we could get the ship under way once more for the voyage she was prepared for. Pleasant talk it was, and none could have thought that it was to be the last of many such quiet evenings that had gone before.  Yet it seemed that my father was uneasy, and we had been laughing at him for his silence, until he said, looking into the fire, \"I will tell you what is on my mind, and then maybe you will laugh at me the more for thinking aught of the matter. Were I in any but a peaceful land, I should say that a great battle had been fought not so far from us, and to the northward.\"  Then my mother looked up at him, knowing that he had seen many fights, and was wise in the signs that men look for before them; but she asked nothing, and so I said, \"What makes you think this, father?\"  He answered me with another question.  \"How many kites will you see overhead at any time, sons?\"  I wondered at this, but it was easy to answer---to Raven, at least.  \"Always one, and sometimes another within sight of the first,\" Raven said.  \"And if there is food, what then?\"  \"The first swoops down on it, and the next follows, and the one that watches the second follows that, and so on until there are many kites gathered.\"  \"What if one comes late?\"  \"He swings overhead and screams, and goes back to his place; then no more come.\"  \"Ay,\" he said; \"you will make a sailor yet, son Raven, for you watch things. Now I will tell you what I saw today. There was the one kite sailing over my head as I was at the ship garth, and presently it screamed so that I looked up. Then it left its wide circles over the town, and flew northward, straight as an arrow. Then from the southward came another, following it, and after that another, and yet others, all going north. And far off I could see where others flew, and they too went north. And presently flapped over me the ravens in the wake of the kites, and the great sea eagles came in screaming and went the same way, and so for all the time that I was at the ship, and until I came home.\"  \"There is a sacrifice to the Asir somewhere,\" I said, \"for the birds of Odin and Thor have always their share.\"  My father shook his head.  \"The birds cry to one another, as I think, and say when the feast is but enough for those that have gathered. They have cried now that there is room for all at some great feasting. Once have I seen the like before, and that was when I was with the ship guard when the jarl fought his great battle in the Orkneys; we knew that he had fought by the same token.\"  But my mother said that I was surely right. There was no fear of battle here, and indeed with Gunnar and Sigurd to guard the land we had had peace for many a long year on our own coasts, if other lands had had to fear them. My father laughed a little, saying that perhaps it was so, and then my mother took the two little ones and went with them into the sleeping room to put them to rest, while I and my two brothers went out to the cattle garth to see that all was well for the night.  Then, when our eyes were used to the moonlight, which was not very bright, away to the northward we saw a red glow that was not that of the sunset or of the northern lights, dying down now and then, and then again flaring up as will a far-off fire; and even as we looked we heard the croak of an unseen raven flying thitherward overhead.  \"Call father,\" I said to Withelm, who was the youngest of us three. The boy ran in, and presently my father came out and looked long at the glow in the sky.  \"Even as I thought,\" he said. \"The king's town is burning, and I must go to tell the jarl. Strange that we have had no message. Surely the king's men must be hard pressed if this is a foe's work.\"  So he went at once, leaving us full of wonder and excited, as boys will be at anything that is new and has a touch of fear in it. But he had hardly gone beyond the outbuildings when one came running and calling him. The jarl had sent for him, for there was strange news from the king. Then he and this messenger hastened off together.  In half an hour the war horns were blowing fiercely, and all the quiet town was awake, for my father's forebodings were true, and the foe was on us. In our house my mother was preparing the food that her husband should carry with him, and I was putting a last polish on the arms that should keep him, while the tramp of men who went to the gathering rang down the street, one by one at first, and then in twos and threes. My mother neither wept nor trembled, but worked with a set face that would not show fear."]]]
