Whereupon the subscriber took the editor by his collar and waistband and heaved him, neck and crop, into the river. Edison swam to shore, wet, but otherwise undisturbed, discontinued the publication of _Paul Pry_, and bade good-by to journalism forever!  \"While young Edison was wading through such mammoth works as Sears's _History of the World_, Burton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_, and the _Dictionary of Sciences_ (and had begun to wrestle desperately with Newton's _Principia_!) he was showing a rare passion for chemistry. He 'annexed' the cellar for a laboratory. His mother said she counted, at one time, no less than two hundred bottles of chemicals, all shrewdly marked POISON, so that no one but himself would dare to touch them. Before long the lad took up so much room in his mother's cellar with his 'mess,' as she called it, that she told him to take it out, 'bag and baggage.'  \"He once stated that his great desire to make money was largely because he needed the cash to buy materials for experiments. Therefore, in this emergency, he took keen pleasure in buying all the chemicals, appliances and apparatus he wished, and installing them in his real 'bag and baggage' car. As the railroad authorities had allowed him to set up a printing press, in addition to his miscellaneous stock in trade, why should he not have his laboratory there also? So his stock of batteries, chemicals and other 'calamity' grew apace.  \"One day, after several weeks of happiness in his moving laboratory, he was 'dead to the world' in an experiment. Suddenly the car gave a lurch and jolted the bottle of phosphorus off its shelf. It broke, flamed up, set fire to the floor and endangered the whole train. While the boy was frantically fighting the fire, the Scotch conductor, red-headed and wrathy, rushed in and helped him to put it out.  \"By this time they were stopping at Mt. Clemens, where the indignant Scotchman boxed the boy's ears and put him out also. Then the man threw the lad's bottles, apparatus and batteries after him, as if they were unloading a carload of freight there.  \"These blows on his ears were the cause of the inventor's life-long deafness. But there never was a gamer sport than Thomas A. Edison. Once, long after this, he saw the labor of years and the outlay of at least two million dollars at the seashore washed away in a single night by a sudden storm. He only laughed and said that was 'spilt milk, not worth crying over.' Disappointments of that sort were 'the fortunes of war' or 'all for the best' to him. The injury so unjustly inflicted on him by that irate conductor was not a defect to him. Many years afterwards he said:  \"'This deafness has been of great advantage to me in various ways. When in a telegraph office I could hear only the instrument directly on the table at which I sat, and, unlike the other operators, I was not bothered by the other instruments.  \"'Again, in experimenting on the telephone, I had to improve the transmitter so that I could hear it. This made the telephone commercial, as the magneto telephone receiver of Bell was too weak to be used as a transmitter commercially.'  \"It was the same with the phonograph. The great defect of that instrument was the rendering of the overtones in music and the hissing consonants in speech. Edison worked over one year, twenty hours a day, Sundays and all, to get the word 'specie' perfectly recorded and reproduced on the phonograph. When this was done, he knew that everything else could be done,--which was a fact.  \"'Again,' Edison resumed, 'my nerves have been preserved intact. Broadway is as quiet to me as a country village is to a person with normal hearing.'\"  The talk suddenly ceased. Then another voice announced from out of the horn: \"The second installment of the lectures on Edison will be given at 3 P.M. next Friday. We will now hear a concert by Wayple's band.\"     CHAPTER V   OPINIONS   The boys and girls filed out, after most of them had expressed appreciation of Professor Gray's interest in their enjoyment, and on the street a lively discussion started. Terry Watkins was laughing derisively at some remark of Cora Siebold, who, arm in arm with her chum \"Dot\" Myers, had paused long enough to fire a broadside at him.  \"Why don't some of you smarties who talk so much about the wonderful things you can do make yourselves receiving sets! Too lazy? Baseball and swimming and loafing around are all you think about. But leave it to the girls; Dot and I are going to tackle one.\"  \"What? You two? Won't it be a mess? Bet you can't hear yourselves think on it. Girls building a radio! Ho, ho, ho!\"  \"Bet there'll be a looking-glass in it somewhere,\" laughed Ted Bissell.  \"Well, we aren't planning to ask advice from either of you,\" Cora said.  \"No, and it would be worth very little if you got any,\" Bill Brown offered, as he and Gus, who had been detained a moment by Professor Gray, joined the loitering group.  \"Thanks, Mr. Brown,\" said Dot, half shyly.  \"Who asked you for your two cents' worth?\" Terry demanded.  \"I'm donating it, to your service. Go and do something yourself before you make fun of others,\" Bill said.  \"That's right, too, Billy. Terry can't drive a carpet tack, nor draw a straight line with a ruler.\" Ted was always in a bantering mood and eager for a laugh at anybody. \"I'll bet Cora's radio will radiate royally and right. You going to make one--you and Gus?\"  \"I guess we can't afford it,\" Bill replied quickly. \"We're both going to work in the mill next Monday. Long hours and steady, and not too much pay, either. But we need the money; eh, Gus?\"  \"We do,\" agreed Gus, smiling.  Bill's countenance was altogether rueful. Life had not been very kind to him and he very naturally longed for some opportunity to dodge continued hardship. He wished that he might, like the boy Edison, make opportunity, but that sounded more plausible in lectures than in real life. He was moodily silent now, while the others engaged in a spirited discussion started by Dot's saying kindly:  \"Well, lots of boys and girls have to work and they often are the better for it. Edison did--and was.\"  \"Oh, I guess he could have been just as great, or greater if he hadn't worked,\" remarked Terry sententiously. \"It isn't only poor boys that amount to----\"  \"Mostly,\" said Bill.  \"Oh, of course, _you'd_ say that. We'll charge your attitude up to envy.\"  \"When I size up some of the rich men's sons I know, I'm rather glad I'm poor,\" said Bill, \"and I would rather make a thousand dollars all by my own efforts than inherit ten thousand.\"  \"I guess you'd take what you could get,\" Terry offered, and Bill was quick to reply:  \"We know there'll be a lot coming to you and it will be interesting to know what you'll do with it and how long you'll have it.\"  \"He will never add anything to it,\" said Ted, who also was the son of wealth, but not in the least snobbish. The others all laughed at this and Terry turned away angrily.  Bill, further inspired by what he deemed an unfair reference to Edison, began to wax eloquent to the others concerning his hero.  \"I don't believe Edison would have amounted to half as much as he has if he hadn't had the hard knocks that a poor fellow always gets. Terry makes me tired with his high and mighty----\"  \"Oh, don't you mind him!\" said Cora.  \"You've read a lot about Edison, haven't you, Bill?\" asked Dot, knowing that the lame boy possessed a hero worshiper's admiration for the wizard of electricity and an overmastering desire to emulate the great inventor. The girl sat down on the grassy bank, pulled Cora down beside her and in her gentle, kindly way, continued to draw Bill out. \"When only quite a little fellow he had become a great reader, the lecturer said.\"  \"I should say he was a reader!\" Bill declared. \"Why, when he was eleven years old he had read Hume's History of England all through and--\"  \"Understood about a quarter of it, I reckon,\" laughed Ted.  \"Understood more than you think,\" Bill retorted. \"He did more in that library than just read an old encyclopedia; he got every book off the shelves, one after the other, and dipped into them all, but of course, some didn't interest him. He read a lot on 'most every subject; mostly about science and chemistry and engineering and mechanics, but a lot also on law and even moral philosophy and what you call it? oh--ethics--and all that sort of thing. He had to read to find out things; there seemed to be no one who could tell him the half that he wanted to know, and I guess a lot of people got pretty tired of having him ask so many questions they couldn't answer. And when they would say, 'I don't know,' he'd get mad and yell: '_Why_ don't you know?'\"  \"Hume's history,--why, we have that at home, in ten volumes. If he got outside of all of that he was going some!\" declared Ted.  \"Well, he did, and all of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, too.\"  \"Holy cats! What stopped him?\" Ted queried.  \"He didn't stop--never stopped. But he had to earn his living--didn't he? He couldn't read all the books and find out about everything right off. But you bet he found out a lot, and he believes that after a fellow gets some rudiments of education he can learn more by studying in his own way and experimenting than by just learning by rote and rule. Maybe he's not altogether right about that, for education is mighty fine and I'd like to go to a technical school; Gus and I both are aiming for that, but we're going to read and study a lot our own way, too, and experiment; aren't we, Gus? Nobody can throw Edison's ideas down when they stop to think how much he knows and what he's done.\"  \"He certainly has accomplished a great deal,\" the usually reticent Gus offered.  \"And yet he seems to be very modest about it,\" was Cora's contribution.  \"Of course, he is; every man who does really big things is never conceited,\" declared Bill.  \"Oh, I don't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],["title","The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#1)"],["body"," be a thing by itself; and if it is not too ungrateful to kindly and enterprising publishers, I would confess I would much prefer to see each printed expensively alone, and left in a little brown-paper cover to lie about a room against the needs of a quite casual curiosity. And I would rather this volume were found in the bedrooms of convalescents and in dentists' parlours and railway trains than in gentlemen's studies. I would rather have it dipped in and dipped in again than read severely through. Essentially it is a miscellany of inventions, many of which were very pleasant to write; and its end is more than attained if some of them are refreshing and agreeable to read. I have now re-read them all, and I am glad to think I wrote them. I like them, but I cannot tell how much the associations of old happinesses gives them a flavour for me. I make no claims for them and no apology; they will be read as long as people read them. Things written either live or die; unless it be for a place of judgment upon Academic impostors, there is no apologetic intermediate state.  I may add that I have tried to set a date to most of these stories, but that they are not arranged in strictly chronological order.  H. G. WELLS.    CONTENTS.       I. THE JILTING OF JANE      II.

THE BEAUTIFUL SUIT       I.    THE JILTING OF JANE.   As I sit writing in my study, I can hear our Jane bumping her way downstairs with a brush and dust-pan. She used in the old days to sing hymn tunes, or the British national song for the time being, to these instruments, but latterly she has been silent and even careful over her work. Time was when I prayed with fervour for such silence, and my wife with sighs for such care, but now they have come we are not so glad as we might have anticipated we should be. Indeed, I would rejoice secretly, though it may be unmanly weakness to admit it, even to hear Jane sing \"Daisy,\" or, by the fracture of any plate but one of Euphemia's best green ones, to learn that the period of brooding has come to an end.  Yet how we longed to hear the last of Jane's young man before we heard the last of him! Jane was always very free with her conversation to my wife, and discoursed admirably in the kitchen on a variety of topics--so well, indeed, that I sometimes left my study door open--our house is a small one--to partake of it. But after William came, it was always William, nothing but William; William this and William that; and when we thought William was worked out and exhausted altogether, then William all over again. The engagement lasted altogether three years; yet how she got introduced to William, and so became thus saturated with him, was always a secret. For my part, I believe it was at the street corner where the Rev. Barnabas Baux used to hold an open-air service after evensong on Sundays. Young Cupids were wont to flit like moths round the paraffin flare of that centre of High Church hymn-singing. I fancy she stood singing hymns there, out of memory and her imagination, instead of coming home to get supper, and William came up beside her and said, \"Hello!\" \"Hello yourself!\" she said; and etiquette being satisfied, they proceeded to talk together.  As Euphemia has a reprehensible way of letting her servants talk to her, she soon heard of him. \"He is _such_ a respectable young man, ma'am,\" said Jane, \"you don't know.\" Ignoring the slur cast on her acquaintance, my wife inquired further about this William.  \"He is second porter at Maynard's, the draper's,\" said Jane, \"and gets eighteen shillings--nearly a pound--a week, m'm; and when the head porter leaves he will be head porter. His relatives are quite superior people, m'm. Not labouring people at all. His father was a greengrosher, m'm, and had a churnor, and he was bankrup' twice. And one of his sisters is in a Home for the Dying. It will be a very good match for me, m'm,\" said Jane, \"me being an orphan girl.\"  \"Then you are engaged to him?\" asked my wife.  \"Not engaged, ma'am; but he is saving money to buy a ring--hammyfist.\"  \"Well, Jane, when you are properly engaged to him you may ask him round here on Sunday afternoons, and have tea with him in the kitchen;\" for my Euphemia has a motherly conception of her duty towards her maid-servants. And presently the amethystine ring was being worn about the house, even with ostentation, and Jane developed a new way of bringing in the joint so that this gage was evident. The elder Miss Maitland was aggrieved by it, and told my wife that servants ought not to wear rings. But my wife looked it up in _Enquire Within_ and _Mrs. Motherly's Book of Household Management_, and found no prohibition. So Jane remained with this happiness added to her love.  The treasure of Jane's heart appeared to me to be what respectable people call a very deserving young man. \"William, ma'am,\" said Jane one day suddenly, with ill-concealed complacency, as she counted out the beer bottles, \"William, ma'am, is a teetotaller. Yes, m'm; and he don't smoke. Smoking, ma'am,\" said Jane, as one who reads the heart, \"_do_ make such a dust about. Beside the waste of money. _And_ the smell. However, I suppose they got to do it--some of them...\"  William was at first a rather shabby young man of the ready-made black coat school of costume. He had watery gray eyes, and a complexion appropriate to the brother of one in a Home for the Dying. Euphemia did not fancy him very much, even at the beginning. His eminent respectability was vouched for by an alpaca umbrella, from which he never allowed himself to be parted.  \"He goes to chapel,\" said Jane. \"His papa, ma'am----\"  \"His _what_, Jane?\"  \"His papa, ma'am, was Church: but Mr. Maynard is a Plymouth Brother, and William thinks it Policy, ma'am, to go there too. Mr. Maynard comes and talks to him quite friendly when they ain't busy, about using up all the ends of string, and about his soul. He takes a lot of notice, do Mr. Maynard, of William, and the way he saves his soul, ma'am.\"  Presently we heard that the head porter at Maynard's had left, and that William was head porter at twenty-three shillings a week. \"He is really kind of over the man who drives the van,\" said Jane, \"and him married, with three children.\" And she promised in the pride of her heart to make interest for us with William to favour us so that we might get our parcels of drapery from Maynard's with exceptional promptitude.  After this promotion a rapidly-increasing prosperity came upon Jane's young man. One day we learned that Mr. Maynard had given William a book. \"'Smiles' 'Elp Yourself,' it's called,\" said Jane; \"but it ain't comic. It tells you how to get on in the world, and some what William read to me was _lovely_, ma'am.\"  Euphemia told me of this, laughing, and then she became suddenly grave. \"Do you know, dear,\" she said, \"Jane said one thing I did not like. She had been quiet for a minute, and then she suddenly remarked, 'William is a lot above me, ma'am, ain't he?'\"  \"I don't see anything in that,\" I said, though later my eyes were to be opened.  One Sunday afternoon about that time I was sitting at my writing-desk-- possibly I was reading a good book--when a something went by the window. I heard a startled exclamation behind me, and saw Euphemia with her hands clasped together and her eyes dilated. \"George,\" she said in an awe-stricken whisper, \"did you see?\"  Then we both spoke to one another at the same moment, slowly and solemnly: \"_A silk hat! Yellow gloves! A new umbrella!_\"  \"It may be my fancy, dear,\" said Euphemia; \"but his tie was very like yours. I believe Jane keeps him in ties. She told me a little while ago, in a way that implied volumes about the rest of your costume, 'The master _do_ wear pretty ties, ma'am.' And he echoes all your novelties.\"  The young couple passed our window again on their way to their customary walk. They were arm in arm. Jane looked exquisitely proud, happy, and uncomfortable, with new white cotton gloves, and William, in the silk hat, singularly genteel!  That was the culmination of Jane's happiness. When she returned, \"Mr. Maynard has been talking to William, ma'am,\" she said, \"and he is to serve customers, just like the young shop gentlemen, during the next sale. And if he gets on, he is to be made an assistant, ma'am, at the first opportunity. He has got to be as gentlemanly as he can, ma'am; and if he ain't, ma'am, he says it won't be for want of trying. Mr. Maynard has took a great fancy to him.\"  \"He _is_ getting on, Jane,\" said my wife.  \"Yes, ma'am,\" said Jane thoughtfully; \"he _is_ getting on.\"  And she sighed.  That next Sunday as I drank my tea I interrogated my wife. \"How is this Sunday different from all other Sundays, little woman? What has happened? Have you altered the curtains, or re-arranged the furniture, or where is the indefinable difference of it? Are you wearing your hair in a new way without warning me? I perceive a change clearly, and I cannot for the life of me say what it is.\"  Then my wife answered in her most tragic voice, \"George,\""]]]
