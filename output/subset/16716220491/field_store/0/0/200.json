When the stores were all safely housed, Mrs. M'Kree insisted on their drinking a cup of hot coffee before they returned; and just as she was lifting the coffee pot from the stove her husband came in.  He was tall, thin, and sombre of face, as men who live in the woods are apt to be, but he had a genial manner, and that he was no tyrant could be seen from the way his children clung about his legs.  \"Dear me, these youngsters!\" he exclaimed, sitting down on the nearest bench with a child on each knee.  \"I wish they were old enough to go to your school, Miss Radford, then I'd get some peace for part of the day at least.\"  \"I wish they were old enough, too,\" sighed Katherine.  \"It is really quite dreadful to think what a long time I have got to wait before all the small children in the neighbourhood are of an age to need school.\"  \"By which time I expect you won't be wanting to keep school at all,\" said Mrs. M'Kree with a laugh.  Then to her husband she said: \"Mr. Radford brought some letters, Astor; perhaps you'll want to read them before he goes back.\"  \"Ah! yes, I'd better perhaps, though there will be no hurry about the answers, I guess, for this will be the last mail that will get through the Strait before the spring.\"  He stood up as he spoke, sliding the babies on to the ground at his feet, for he could not read his letters with the small people clutching and clawing at his hands.  The others went on talking, to be interrupted a few minutes later by a surprised exclamation from the master of the house.  \"Now, would you believe it! The Company has been bought out!\"  \"What company?\" asked 'Duke Radford.  \"Why, the fishing-fleet owners, Barton and Skinner and that lot,\" rejoined Astor M'Kree abstractedly, being again buried in his letter.  He was a boat-builder by trade, and this change in things might make a considerable difference to him.  \"Who is it that has bought the company out?\" demanded Mrs. M'Kree anxiously.  Life was quite hard enough for her already; she did not want it to become more difficult still.  \"An Englishman named Oswald Selincourt,\" replied Astor.  \"He is rich, too, and means to put money into the business.  He wants me to have four more boats ready by the time the waters are open, and says he is coming himself next summer to see into matters a bit. Now that looks hopeful.\"  Katherine chanced at that moment to glance across at her father, and was startled by the look on his face; it was just as if something had made him desperately afraid.  But it was only for a moment, and then he had got his features into control, so she hastily averted her head lest he should see her looking, and think that she was trying to pry into what did not concern her.  He swallowed down the rest of his coffee at a gulp and rose to go. But his manner now was so changed and uneasy that Katherine must have wondered at it, even if she had not caught a glimpse of that dreadful look on his face when Astor M'Kree announced the change in the ownership of the fishing fleet.  The journey home was taken in a different style from the journey out: the two sledges were tied together, and both pairs of snowshoes piled on the hindmost; then, Katherine and her father taking their places on the first, the dogs started off at a tearing gallop, which made short work of the two miles of level track, and gave Katherine and her father plenty of occupation in holding on. But when they reached the broken ground the pace grew steadier, and conversation became possible once more.  'Duke Radford began to talk then with almost feverish haste, but he carefully avoided any mention of the news contained in the boatbuilder's letter, and a sickening fear of something, she knew not what, crept into the heart of Katherine and spoiled for her the glory of that winter afternoon.  The sun went down in flaming splendours of crimson and gold, a young moon hung like a sickle of silver above the dark pine forest, and everywhere below was the white purity of the fresh-fallen snow.  Supper was nearly ready when they got back to Roaring Water Portage, but there were two or three customers in the store, and Katherine went to help her father with them, while Miles unharnessed and fed the four dogs.  Oily Dave was one of the people gathered round the stove waiting to be served with flour and bacon, and it was his voice raised in eager talk which Katherine heard when she came back from the sitting-room into the store.  \"If it's true what they are saying, that Barton, Skinner, & Co. are in liquidation, then things is going to look queer for some of us when the spring comes, and the question will be as to who can claim the boats, though some of them ain't much good.\"  \"I suppose that you'll stick to your'n, seeing that it is by far the best in the fleet,\" said another man, who had a deep, rumbling laugh.  Katherine looked at her father in dumb surprise.  She had been expecting him to announce the news of the fishing boats having been bought by the Englishman with the remarkable name, instead of which he was just going on with his work, and looking as if he had no more information than the others.  Lifting his head at that moment he caught his daughter's perplexed glance, and, after a moment, said hastily: \"I wouldn't be in too much hurry about appropriating the boats if I were you.\"  \"Why not?\" chorused the listeners.  \"Barton & Skinner have been bought out, and the new owner might not approve of his property being made off with in that fashion,\" 'Duke Radford replied.  \"Who's bought it?  Who told you? Look here, we want to know,\" one man burst out impatiently.  \"Then you had better go up to the second portage and ask Astor M'Kree,\" rejoined 'Duke Radford slowly.  \"It was he who told me about it, and he has got the order to build four more boats.\"  \"Now that looks like business, anyhow.  Who is the man?\" demanded Rick Portus, who was younger than the others, and meant \"to make things hum\" when he got a chance.  'Duke Radford fumbled with the head of a flour barrel, and for a moment did not answer.  It was an agonizing moment for Katherine, who was entering items in the ledger, and had to be blind and deaf to what was passing round her, yet all the time was acutely conscious that something was wrong somewhere.  The head of the barrel came off with a jerk, and then 'Duke answered with an air of studied indifference: \"An Englishman, Astor M'Kree said he was; Selincourt or some such name, I think.\"  A burst of eager talk followed this announcement, but, her entries made in the ledger, Katherine slipped away from it all and hurried into the sitting-room, where supper was already beginning.  But the food had lost its flavour for her, and she might have been feeding on the sawdust and pine cones of which Mrs. M'Kree had spoken for all the taste her supper possessed.  She had to talk, however, and to seem cheerful, yet all the time she was shrinking and shivering because of this mysterious mood displayed by her father at the mention of a strange man's name.  'Duke Radford did not come in from the store until it was nearly time for night school, so Katherine saw very little more of him, except at a distance, for that evening; but he was so quiet and absorbed that Mrs. Burton asked more than once if he were feeling unwell.  She even insisted on his taking a basin of onion gruel before he went to bed, because she thought he had caught a chill. He swallowed the gruel obediently enough, yet knew all the time that the chill was at his heart, where no comforting food nor drink could relieve him.     CHAPTER II  A Curious Accident  The nearest Hudson's Bay store to Roaring Water Portage was fifteen miles away by land, but only five by boat, as it stood on an angle of land jutting into the water, three miles from the mouth of the river.  'Duke Radford's business took him over to this place, which was called Fort Garry, always once a week, and sometimes oftener. Usually either Miles or Phil went with him, although on rare occasions Katherine took the place of the boys and helped to row the boat across the inlet to the grim old blockhouse crowning the height.  It was a week after the trip to the house of Astor M'Kree that the storekeeper announced his intention of going to Fort Garry, and said that he should need Miles to help him.  \"I must go by land to-day, which is a nuisance, for it takes so much longer,\" he declared, as he sat down to breakfast, which at this time of the year had always to be taken by lamplight.  \"Shall I come instead?\" asked Katherine, who was frying potatoes at the stove.  \"I am quicker on snowshoes than Miles, and he has got such a bad cold.\"  \"You can if you like, though it isn't work for a girl,\" he answered in a dispirited tone.  \"It is work for a girl if a girl has got it to do,\" she rejoined, with a merry laugh; \"and I shall just love to come with you, Father.  When will you start?\"  \"At dawn,\" he replied brusquely; and, finishing his meal in silence, he went into the store.  \"Katherine, what is the matter with Father?  Do you think he is ill?\" Mrs. Burton asked in a troubled tone.  \"He has been so quiet and gloomy for the last few days; he does not eat well, and he does not seem to care to talk to any of us.\"  Katherine shivered and hesitated.  She knew the moment from which the change in her father's manner dated, but she could not speak of it even to her sister.  \"Perhaps the cold weather tries him a great deal just at first; it has come so suddenly, and we are not seasoned to it yet, you know,\" she answered evasively.  \"I hope it is only that,\" answered Mrs. Burton, brightening up at the suggestion.  \"And really the cold has been terribly trying for the last week, though it won't seem so bad when we get used"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11110"],["title","A Countess from Canada: A Story of Life in the Backwoods (#2)"],["body"," it. I am glad you are going with Father, though, for Miles has such a dreadful cold, poor boy.\"  \"His own fault,\" laughed Katherine.  \"If he will go and sit in a tub half the day, in the hope of shooting swans, he must expect to get a cold.\"  \"Boys will do unwise things, I fancy.  They can't help it, so it is of no use to blame them,\" Mrs. Burton said with a sigh.  Katherine laughed again.  Mrs. Burton had a way of never blaming anyone, and slipped through life always thinking the very best of the people with whom she came in contact, crediting them with good intentions however far short they might prove of good in reality. The sisters were alike in features and in their dainty, womanly ways, but in character they were a wide contrast.  Katherine, under her girlish softness and pretty winning manner, had hidden a firm will and purpose, a sound judgment, and a resourcefulness which would stand her in good stead in the emergencies of life.  She liked to decide things for herself, and choose what she would do; but Mrs. Burton always needed someone to lean upon and to settle momentous questions for her.  'Duke Radford was ready to start by the time dawn arrived, and Katherine was ready too.  It was so very cold that she had twisted a cloud of brilliant scarlet wool all over her head and ears, in addition to her other wrappings.  There were some stores to take to Fort Garry, and there would be others to bring back, as considerable trading was done between the fort and the settlement. Very often when 'Duke Radford ran out of some easy-to-sell commodity he was able to replenish his stock from the fort, while he in his turn accepted furs in barter from his customers, which he disposed of to the agent when next he visited the fort.  As on the journey to the second portage, 'Duke Radford went first, drawing a laden sledge, followed by Katherine, who looked after the dogs. There would be no riding either way to-day, and the daylight would be only just long enough for the work, the snow on the trail not being hard enough as yet to make the going very easy.  Fort Garry was reached without incident, although, to Katherine's secret dismay, her father had not spoken to her once, but had just gone moodily forward with his head hanging down, and dragging the sledge after him.  He roused up a little when the fort was reached, and talked to Peter M'Crawney, the agent, an eager-faced Scot with an insatiable desire for information on all sorts of subjects. Mrs. M'Crawney was an Irishwoman who was always sighing for the mild, moist climate and the peat reek of her childhood's home.  But Peter knew when he was well off, and meant to stick to his post until he had saved enough money to live without work.  \"Teaching school, are you?  Well it's myself that would like to be one of your scholars, for it's bonny you look with that scarlet thing wrapped round your head!\" exclaimed Mrs. M'Crawney in an admiring tone, when Katherine sat down to have a talk with her whilst 'Duke Radford did his business with the agent.  \"You can come if you like; we don't have any age limit at Roaring Water Portage,\" Katherine answered with a laugh.  She had to be bright and vivacious despite the heaviness of her heart, for it would never do to display her secret uneasiness on her father's account, or to betray his changed condition to strangers.  \"And pretty I should look at my age, sitting among the babies learning to do strokes and pothooks,\" the Irishwoman said, echoing the laugh.  Then she began to question Katherine eagerly concerning the news which had filtered through into the solitudes from the great world outside.  \"They are saying that the Mr. Selincourt who has bought the fishing fleet will come here when the waters open; but wherever will he stay?\"  \"I don't know; perhaps he will have one of the huts down at Seal Cove, although they are very dirty.  I think if I were in his place I should have a new hut built, or else live in a tent,\" Katherine answered.  \"He will have a hut built, I expect; then perhaps if he likes the place he will come every year.  Although it's funny the whims rich people have, to be coming to a place like this, when they might be living in a civilized country, with everything that heart could desire within a hand's reach,\" said Mrs. M'Crawney with a toss of her head.  \"I suppose being able to have all they want spoils them so much that they are always wanting a change.  But if we don't start we shall be late in getting home, and travelling is very bad over the broken ground at the end of the bay,\" Katherine said, as she rose and began to draw her scarlet cloud closer round her head again.  Her father was still talking to Peter M'Crawney when she came in search of him, but he looked so much relieved at the interruption that she could only suppose the agent had been talking overmuch about the rich Englishman who was expected in that remote quarter of the world next spring, when the waters were open.  \"Are you ready to go now?\" Katherine asked, a sudden pang of pity stabbing at her heart, for in the strong light her father's face looked worn and furrowed, more than she had ever seen it before; indeed, a look of age had crept over his countenance during the last few days that was very marked, while his dark hair showed streaks of grey which had certainly not been there a week ago.  He had momentarily taken off his cap, to do something to one of the lappets which was not comfortable; but now he put it on again, covering his head, ears, and a good part of his face as well.  \"Yes, I am ready, and rather keen on starting, for there is a damp smell coming in the air which may mean a slight thaw or more fall, and either would be bad for us to-day,\" he answered, lifting his head and sniffing, like a dog that scents a trail.  \"Can't the dogs pull you a piece, Miss?\" asked the agent in a tone of concern.  \"It is a shocking long way for a bit of a girl, even though she is on snowshoes.\"  \"It is not longer for me than for Father, and I don't even have to drag the sledge as he does,\" Katherine replied brightly, as she fitted her moccasined feet into the straps of her snowshoes.  The dogs were in a great hurry to start, and one, a great brown-and-white beast which always followed next the leader, kept flinging up its head and howling in the most dismal manner until they were well on their way.  The noise got on Katherine's nerves to such an extent that she was tempted to use her whip to the dog, and only refrained because it seemed so cruel to thrash a creature for just being miserable.  To cheer the animals for the heavy work before them, she talked to them as if they were human beings, encouraging them so much that they took the first ten miles at a tremendous rate, following so close on the track of the first sledge that presently 'Duke Radford held up his hand as a signal for stopping, then turned round to expostulate in a peevish tone: \"What do you mean by letting the dogs wear themselves out at such a rate?  We shall have one of them dropping exhausted presently, and then we shall be in a nice fix.\"  \"I haven't used the whip once, Father, but I thought it was better to get them on as fast as I could, for I have felt and seen ever so many snowflakes in the last half-hour,\" Katherine said penitently.  'Duke Radford turned his face rather anxiously windward, and was considerably worried to find that a few small snowflakes came dancing slowly down, and that the slight draught of the morning was changing to a raw, cold wind from off the water.  \"It is a fall coming, and by the look of it, it may be heavy.  You had better keep the dogs coming as fast as you can.  But stop if I throw up my hand, or you will be running me down.\"  \"Shall we change places for a time?\" asked Katherine.  \"I am not a bit tired, but you look just worn out.\"  \"No, no, I can't have you dragging a sledge.  But be careful and keep the dogs from rushing down the slopes and overrunning me,\" he answered, then started forward again.  The flakes were falling faster now, but they were so fine that they would have scarcely counted had it not been for the number of them. At the end of the next half-hour the fall was like a fog of whirling atoms, and the travellers looked like moving snow figures. The dogs were still running well, and Katherine found it hard work to keep them back, especially on the slopes, where they would persist in trying to make rushes, so getting thoroughly out of hand.  She was keeping them back down one long bad slope which abounded in pitfalls, when to her horror she heard her father cry out, then saw him and his sledge disappear, shooting into a whirling smother of snow.    [Illustration:  'Duke Radford meets with an accident]  With a sharp order to the dogs to stop, which they promptly obeyed by dropping in four panting heaps on the snow, she went forward alone to see what had happened to her father.  It was a simple enough accident, and one that had to be constantly guarded against in drawing a sledge when travelling on snowshoes.  In going down the slope the sledge had travelled proportionally faster than the man, and, catching against the framework of one of the snowshoes, had flung him with tremendous force between two trees. The trees, which were really two shoots from one root, grew so close together that when 'Duke Radford was pitched in between them he was wedged fast by the force of the impact, while the sledge, coming on behind, bounded on to his prostrate body.  He groaned when Katherine dragged the sledge away, and cried out with the pain when she tried to help him out.  \"Did it hurt you so badly?  Oh, I am sorry!  But I will be more careful next time,\" she said; and, stepping carefully backwards after that first vain attempt, she slipped her feet clear of the snowshoes and went closer to the tree, so that she might try to lift him out of the fork by sheer strength of arm.  But the snow was so soft that she sank in over her ankles, going"]]]
