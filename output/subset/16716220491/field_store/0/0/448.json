As for myself, when I _do_ try to get fresh with you, you won't have to do any guessing.  You'll be sure of it.\"  Bad Pete took a step forward, dropping his right hand, as though unconsciously, to the butt of the revolver in the holster.  He fixed his burning gaze savagely on the boy's face as he muttered, in a low, ugly voice:  \"Tenderfoot, when I'm around after this you shut your mouth and keep it shut!  You needn't take the trouble to call me Peter again, either.  My name is Bad Pete, and I am bad.  I'm poison!  Understand? Poison!\"  \"Poison?\" repeated Tom dryly, coolly.  \"No; I don't believe I'd call you that.  I think I'd call you a bluff---and let it go at that.\"  Bad Pete scowled angrily.  Again his hand slid to the butt of his revolver, then with a muttered imprecation he turned and stalked away, calling back threateningly over his shoulder:  \"Remember, tenderfoot.  Keep out of my way.\"  Behind the boys, halted a man who had just stepped into the camp over the natural stone wall.  This man was a sun-browned, smooth-faced, pleasant-featured man of perhaps thirty-two or thirty-three years. Dressed in khaki trousers, with blue flannel shirt, sombrero and well-worn puttee leggings, he might have been mistaken for a soldier.  Though his eyes were pleasant to look at, there was an expression of great shrewdness in them.  The lines around his mouth bespoke the man's firmness.  He was about five-feet-eight in height, slim and had the general bearing of a strong man accustomed to hard work.  \"Boys,\" he began in a low voice, whereat both Tom and Harry faced swiftly about, \"you shouldn't rile Bad Pete that way.  He's an ugly character, who carries all he knows of law in his holsters, and we're a long way from the sheriff's officers.\"  \"Is he really bad?\" asked Tom innocently.  \"Really bad?\" laughed the man in khaki.  \"You'll find out if you try to cross him.  Are you visiting the camp?\"  \"Reade!  Hazelton!\" called a voice brusquely from the big tent.  \"That's Mr. Thurston calling us, I guess,\" said Tom quickly. \"We'll have to excuse ourselves and go and report to him.\"  \"Yes, that was Thurston,\" nodded the slim man.  \"And I'm Blaisdell, the assistant engineer.  I'll go along with you.\"  Throwing aside the canvas flap, Mr. Blaisdell led the boys inside the big tent.  At one end a portion of the tent was curtained off, and this was presumably the chief engineer's bedroom.  Near the centre of the tent was a flat table about six by ten feet. Just at present it held many drawings, all arranged in orderly piles.  Not far from the big table was a smaller one on which a typewriting machine rested.  The man who sat at the large table, and who wheeled about in a revolving chair as Tom and Harry entered, was perhaps forty-five years of age.  His head was covered with a mass of bushy black hair.  His face was as swarthy, in its clean-shaven condition, as though the owner had spent all of his life under a hot sun. His clothing like that of all the rest of the engineers in camp was of khaki, his shirt of blue flannel, with a long, flowing black tie.  \"Mr. Thurston,\" announced the assistant engineer, \"I have just encountered these young gentlemen, who state that they are under orders from the New York offices to report to you for employment.\"  Mr. Thurston looked both boys over in silence for a few seconds. His keen eyes appeared to take in everything that could possibly concern them.  Then he rose, extending his hand, first to Reade, next to Hazelton.  \"From what technical school do you come?\" inquired the engineer as he resumed his chair.  \"From none, sir,\" Tom answered promptly \"We didn't have money enough for that sort of training.\"  Mr. Thurston raised his eyebrows in astonished inquiry.  \"Then why,\" he asked, \"did you come here?  What made you think that you could break in as engineers?\"     CHAPTER II  BAD PETE BECOMES WORSE   Timothy Thurston's gaze was curious, and his voice a trifle cold. Yet he did not by any means treat the boys with contempt.  He appeared simply to wonder why these young men had traveled so far to take up his time.  \"We couldn't afford to take a college course in engineering, sir,\" Tom Reade continued, reddening slightly.  \"We have learned all that we possibly could in other ways, however.\"  \"Do you expect me, young men, to detail an experienced engineer to move about with you as instructor until you learn enough to be of use to us?\"  \"No, indeed, we don't, sir,\" Tom replied, and perhaps his voice was sharper than usual, though it rang with earnestness.  \"We believe, sir, that we are very fair engineers.  We are willing to be tried out, sir, and to be rated exactly where you find that we belong.  If necessary we'll start in as helpers to the chainmen, and we have pride enough to walk back over the trail at any moment when you decide that we're no good.  We have traveled all the way from the east, and I trust, sir, that you'll give us a fair chance to show if we know anything.\"  \"It won't take long to find that out,\" replied Mr. Thurston gravely. \"Of course you both understand that we are doing real engineering work and haven't any time to instruct amateurs or be patient with them.\"  \"We don't want instruction, Mr. Thurston,\" Hazelton broke in. \"We want work, and when we get it we'll do it.\"  \"I hope your work will be as good as your assurance,\" replied the chief engineer, with a slight twinkle in his eyes.  \"What can you do?\"  \"We know how to do ordinary surveying, sir,\" Tom replied quickly. \"We can run our courses and supervise the chaining.  We know how to bring in field notes that are of some use.  We can do our work well within the limits of error allowed by the United States Government.  We also consider ourselves competent at leveling. Give us the profile plan and the notes on an excavation, and we can superintend the laborers who have to make an excavation. We have a fair knowledge of ordinary road building.  We have the strength of usual materials at our finger's ends, and for beginners I think we may claim that we are very well up in mathematics. We have had some all-around experience.  Here is a letter, sir, from Price & Conley, of Gridley, in whose offices we have done quite a bit of work.\"  Mr. Thurston took the letter courteously, though he did not \\ immediately glance at it.  \"Country surveyors, these gentlemen, I suppose?\" he asked, looking into Tom's eyes.  \"Yes, sir,\" nodded Reade, \"though Mr. Price is also the engineer for our home county.  Both Mr. Price and Mr. Conley paid us the compliment of saying that we were well fitted to work in a railway engineering camp.\"  \"Well, we'll try you out, until you either make good or convince us that you can't,\" agreed the chief engineer, without any show of enthusiasm.  \"You may show them where they are to live, Mr. Blaisdell, and where they are to mess.  In the morning you can put these young men at some job or other.\"  The words sounded like a dismissal, but Blaisdell lingered a moment.  \"Mr. Thurston,\" he smiled, \"our young men ran, first thing, into Bad Pete.\"  \"Yes?\" inquired the chief.  \"Did Pete show these young men his fighting front?\"  Blaisdell repeated the dialogue that had taken place between Tom and Bad Pete.  The chief listened to his assistant in silence.  Tom flushed slightly under the penetrating glance Mr. Thurston cast upon him during the recital.  When the assistant had finished, the chief merely remarked: \"Blaisdell, I wish you could get rid of that fellow, Bad Pete.  I don't like to have him hanging about the camp.  He's an undesirable character, and I'm afraid that some of our men will have trouble with him. Can't you get rid of him?\"  \"I'll do it if you say so, Mr. Thurston,\" Blaisdell answered quietly.  \"How?\" inquired his chief.  \"I'll serve out firearms to five or six of the men, and the next time Pete shows his face we'll cover him and march him miles away from camp.\"  \"That wouldn't do any good,\" replied Mr. Thurston, with a shake of his head.  \"Pete would only come back, uglier than before, and he'd certainly shoot up some of our men.\"  \"You asked me, a moment ago, Mr. Thurston, what I could do,\" Tom broke in.  \"Give me a little time, and I'll agree to rid the camp of Peter.\"  \"How?\" asked the chief abruptly.  \"Not with any gun-play!  Pete would be too quick for you at anything of that sort.\"  \"I don't carry a pistol, and don't wish to do so,\" Tom retorted. \"In my opinion only a coward carries a pistol.\"  \"Then you think Bad Pete is a coward, young man?\" returned the chief.  \"If driven into a corner I'm pretty sure he'd turn out to be one, sir,\" Tom went on earnestly.  \"A coward is a man who's afraid. If a fellow isn't afraid of anything, then why does he have to carry firearms to protect himself?\"  \"I don't believe that would quite apply to Pete,\" Mr. Thurston went on.  \"Pete doesn't carry a revolver because he's afraid of anything.  He knows that many other men are afraid of pistols, and so he carries his firearms about in order that he may enjoy himself in playing bully.\"  \"I can drive him out of camp,\" Tom insisted.  \"All I'll wait for will be your permission to go ahead.\"  \"If you can do it without shooting,\" replied the chief, \"try your hand at it.  Be careful, however, Reade.  There are plenty of good natural lead mines in these mountains.\"  \"Yes---sir?\" asked Reade, looking puzzled.  \"Much as we'd like to see Pete permanently out of this camp, remember that we don't want you to give the fellow any excuse for turning you into a lead mine.\"  \"If Peter tries anything like that with me,\" retorted Tom solemnly, \"I shall be deeply offended.\"  \"Very good.  Take the young men along with you, Blaisdell.  I'll hear your report on them tomorrow night.\"  The assistant engineer took Tom and Harry over to a seven by nine tent.  \"You'll bunk in here,\" he explained, \"and store your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12735"],["title","The Grammar School Boys in Summer Athletics (#1)"],["body"," country had roused his digestion a bit, and had left him in just that state where he could contentedly lie on the grass and doze half of the time.  On this bright Sunday all six of our Grammar School boys had attended church and Sunday school as usual. Then, the day being so fine, they had met and gone away on this tramp, which had ended in a \"resting match\" on the cool grass under the shade of trees.  All of our readers are familiar with these six fine American boys. Our readers were first introduced to Dick & Co., as Prescott and his chums were locally known, in the first volume in this series, \"_The Grammar School Boys Of Gridley_.\" Therein the reader made the acquaintance of six average American boys of thirteen, and followed them through their sports and adventures---which latter were many and startling indeed.  In the second volume of the series, \"_The Grammar School Boys Snowbound_,\" the same six were shown at winter sports just before Christmas. The detection, on Main Street, of a trio of Christmas shopping thieves led to a long chain of rousing adventures. Right after Christmas, Dick & Co., securing permission from their parents, went for a few days of forest camping in an old log cabin of which they had been given the use. Another phase of their adventure with the shopping district thieveries turned up in the woods and contributed greatly to the excitement of their experience. While still camping in the old, but weather-proof cabin, the Grammar School boys found themselves snowbound in one of the greatest blizzards that had happened in that section in years. Being hardy boys from much outdoor life, however, Dick & Co., as our readers know, turned hardship into jolly fun, and incidentally made a great discovery in the woods that turned their camping expedition into the local sensation of the hour. The reader also remembers how some of the poorer specimens of High School boys and a few local young \"toughs,\" under the leadership of Fred Ripley and Bert Dodge, tried to drive them from their forest camp.  In the third volume of the series, \"_The Grammar School Boys In The Woods_,\" Dick Prescott and his chums, each now fourteen years of age, found the most startling of all the exciting happenings that had been crowded into their short lives. How they came upon two dangerous, tattered specimens of humanity in the woods, how these two contrived to make Dick and Greg take unwilling part in an attempt to rob one of the local banks, the mystery of the haunted schoolhouse, and a host of other lively incidents---all these are so familiar to the reader of these volumes as to need no repetition. And Dick & Co., through the series of exciting adventures they had encountered, had become the best-known boys in and around the little city of Gridley. Being leaders of other boys, they had naturally made some enemies, but that is to be expected in the case of all who are born to lead, or who fit themselves for leadership.  And now, on this glorious June Sunday afternoon, we find our schoolboy friends enjoying the sacred day quietly, yet looking forward to the opening of the contests on the diamond between the three local Grammar Schools, the North, Central, and South Grammars.  The road they had chosen on this Sunday afternoon was one over which they had seldom traveled. It was not the road to Norton's Woods, to the great forest, nor yet the one that went by the \"haunted schoolhouse.\" It was in a wholly different direction from Gridley.  \"It's a long way home, this,\" complained Tom Reade, as the boys plodded along the dusty highway. \"And I'm hungry.\"  \"Hungry?\" snorted Darrin. \"Of course you are. You fellows sang a verse to me a while ago. Tom, how do you and your fellow-porkers like this lay?\"  Taking a deep breath, Dave started to sing a travesty, to the air of \"America.\"  _\"My stomach, 'tis of thee, Sweet gland of gluttony, To thee I sing!  Gland---\"_  \"Stop it,\" ordered Tom threateningly, as he advanced upon Darrin.  \"Stings, does it?\" inquired Dave sarcastically.  \"Yes, it does,\" Reade retorted bluntly. \"To my mind 'America' is as sacred as any hymn ever written, and I won't hear it guyed! That's no decent occupation for an American boy.\"  \"That's right,\" nodded Greg Holmes.  \"Well, I won't yield to any of you in being American to the backbone,\" Dave retorted hotly.  \"Prove it,\" said Tom more quietly.  \"I'll prove it by my whole life, if need be,\" Darrin went on warmly. \"Tom Reade, I'll be glad to meet you when we're sixty years old, talk it all over and see who has been the better American through life!\"  \"Great!\" laughed Dick Prescott approvingly. \"That'll be a fine time to settle the question. And that time is---let me see---forty-six years away.\"  The other boys were grinning now, and Dave and Tom, catching the spirit of the thing, laughed good-humoredly.  \"But this does seem a mighty long way home,\" Dan complained.  \"I can show you fellows a shorter way, if you want it,\" Prescott proposed.  \"We all live on Missouri Avenue. Show us,\" begged Hazelton.  \"It's through the woods,\" Dick continued. \"I warn you that you'll find some of it rough going.\"  \"Then I don't know about it,\" Greg replied with fine irony. \"We fellows are not very well used to the woods.\"  \"It's twenty minutes of six,\" declared Dan, glancing at his watch. \"Some of us are in danger of eating nothing but cold potatoes tonight if we don't get over the ground faster. Find the short cut, Dick.\"  \"It starts down here, just a little way,\" Prescott answered. \"I'll turn in when we come to the right place.\"  Dick and Darrin were now walking side by side in advance. Right behind them came Greg and Dan, while Tom and Harry, paired, brought up the rear.  \"In this way,\" called Dick, turning sharply to the left and going in under an archway of trees. It was over velvety grass that he led his chums at first. After something like an eighth of a mile the Grammar School boys came to deeper woods, where they had to thrust branches aside in making their way through the tangle.  \"My Sunday suit will look like a hand-me-down by the time I get home,\" muttered Greg Holmes.  \"It does now,\" Dave called back to him consolingly.  \"We suspected that Darry's grouch was due to dyspepsia,\" laughed Holmes. \"Now I am sure of it. David, little giant, take my advice---fast to-night.\"  \"I will, if the rest of you fellows will,\" challenged Darrin quickly.  \"The truth is out,\" Tom burst out laughing. \"Darry, by that slip of the tongue you admitted that you've been eating too much and that you're all out of sorts.\"  Dave did not deny. He merely snorted, from which sign of defiance his chums could gain no information.  They had gone another quarter of a mile through the woods when Dick, now alone in the lead, suddenly halted, holding up one hand as a signal to halt, while he rested the fingers of his other hand over his lips as a command for silence.  \"What is it?\" whispered Darrin, stepping close.  \"Fred Ripley, Bert Dodge and some of their fellows,\" Dick whispered, at the same time pointing through the leaves.  \"Well, we don't have to halt, just because they're around,\" retorted Darrin, snorting. \"If they try to pick any trouble with us we can give 'em as good as they send. We've done it once or twice already.\"  \"But we don't want to go to fighting on Sunday, if there's any way to avoid it,\" young Prescott urged, at which four of his chums nodded their heads approvingly.  \"I'm not looking for any fight, either,\" muttered Dave. \"Yet it goes against the grain to halt just in order to let that gang slip by without seeing us.\"  \"There are five of us against your single vote, Darry,\" Dick reminded him. \"Let us have our way.\"  \"Well, we don't need to skulk, do we?\" queried Dave.  \"Oh, no,\" Dick assured him. \"All we will do is to keep quiet and not bring on a fight with that tough lot.\"  \"Huh!\" muttered Darrin, as though he could not see the difference between that and skulking.  Presently, after holding a hand behind him to signal silence and stealth, Prescott started on in the lead. He wanted, if possible, to see just where Ripley, Dodge and their crowd went, so that the Grammar School boys would not run too suddenly into them. The \"Co.\" trailed on in Indian file behind their leader.  Finally Dick halted again, his chums crowding on his heels. They looked out into a clearing beyond. There, amid trees, stood a small three-room house, looking still quite new in its trim paint, though the building had stood there idle for some five years. At one time the city had planned a new reservoir site on a hill just above, and this little cottage had been intended for the reservoir tender. Then a better site for the reservoir had been found, and, to date, the cottage had not been removed.  \"Ripley and his crew went around that cottage to the door side,\" Dick whispered.  \"Are they in the cottage?\" Dave demanded.  \"I don't know. They went around to the other side. Let's wait and see if we can guess what's up.\"  So, forgetful of their suppers for the time being, Dick & Co. waited, screened by the bushes.  \"There's smoke coming up out of the chimney,\" whispered Tom Reade.  \"Yes,\" nodded Dick. \"I had just noticed that. I'm wondering what it can mean. No one has any right to break into the cottage.\"  \"Fred Ripley and Bert Dodge, because they have a lawyer and a bank officer for fathers, don't feel that they need any rights when they want to do a thing,\" muttered Darrin resent fully.  It was impossible to see what might be going on inside the cottage, for the simple reason that all of the windows were shuttered tightly.  \"Let's go ahead,\" begged Dave, after a few more moments spent in idle watching. \"I want to know why that crowd has broken into the cottage.\"  Truth to tell, even the leader of Dick & Co., usually very discreet, felt himself a victim of curiosity.  \"Shall we try to find out the secret, fellows?\" Prescott inquired.  \"That's just what we ought to do,\" responded Greg. \"Especially as Ripley and"]]]
