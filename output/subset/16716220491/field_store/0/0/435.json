Nothing could be more first-rate than the royal Edward's ingenuousness. One does not know which to admire most--the delicacy of his attachment to Madame St. Laurent, the refinement of his sentiments towards the Duke of Clarence, or his own perfect disinterestedness in pecuniary matters.\"  As it turned out, both the brothers decided to marry. The Duke of Kent, selecting the Princess of Saxe-Coburg in preference to the Princess of Baden, was united to her on May 29, 1818. On June 11, the Duke of Clarence followed suit with a daughter of the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. But they were disappointed in their financial expectations; for though the Government brought forward proposals to increase their allowances, together with that of the Duke of Cumberland, the motions were defeated in the House of Commons. At this the Duke of Wellington was not surprised. \"By God!\" he said, \"there is a great deal to be said about that. They are the damnedest millstones about the necks of any Government that can be imagined. They have insulted--PERSONALLY insulted--two-thirds of the gentlemen of England, and how can it be wondered at that they take their revenge upon them in the House of Commons? It is their only opportunity, and I think, by God! they are quite right to use it.\" Eventually, however, Parliament increased the Duke of Kent's annuity by L6000. The subsequent history of Madame St. Laurent has not transpired.  IV  The new Duchess of Kent, Victoria Mary Louisa, was a daughter of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and a sister of Prince Leopold. The family was an ancient one, being a branch of the great House of Wettin, which since the eleventh century had ruled over the March of Meissen on the Elbe. In the fifteenth century the whole possessions of the House had been divided between the Albertine and Ernestine branches: from the former descended the electors and kings of Saxony; the latter, ruling over Thuringia, became further subdivided into five branches, of which the duchy of Saxe-Coburg was one. This principality was very small, containing about 60,000 inhabitants, but it enjoyed independent and sovereign rights. During the disturbed years which followed the French Revolution, its affairs became terribly involved. The Duke was extravagant, and kept open house for the swarms of refugees, who fled eastward over Germany as the French power advanced. Among these was the Prince of Leiningen, an elderly beau, whose domains on the Moselle had been seized by the French, but who was granted in compensation the territory of Amorbach in Lower Franconia. In 1803 he married the Princess Victoria, at that time seventeen years of age. Three years later Duke Francis died a ruined man. The Napoleonic harrow passed over Saxe-Coburg. The duchy was seized by the French, and the ducal family were reduced to beggary, almost to starvation. At the same time the little principality of Amorbach was devastated by the French, Russian, and Austrian armies, marching and counter-marching across it. For years there was hardly a cow in the country, nor enough grass to feed a flock of geese. Such was the desperate plight of the family which, a generation later, was to have gained a foothold in half the reigning Houses of Europe. The Napoleonic harrow had indeed done its work, the seed was planted; and the crop would have surprised Napoleon. Prince Leopold, thrown upon his own resources at fifteen, made a career for himself and married the heiress of England. The Princess of Leiningen, struggling at Amorbach with poverty, military requisitions, and a futile husband, developed an independence of character and a tenacity of purpose which were to prove useful in very different circumstances. In 1814, her husband died, leaving her with two children and the regency of the principality. After her brother's marriage with the Princess Charlotte, it was proposed that she should marry the Duke of Kent; but she declined, on the ground that the guardianship of her children and the management of her domains made other ties undesirable. The Princess Charlotte's death, however, altered the case; and when the Duke of Kent renewed his offer, she accepted it. She was thirty-two years old--short, stout, with brown eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, cheerful and voluble, and gorgeously attired in rustling silks and bright velvets.  She was certainly fortunate in her contented disposition; for she was fated, all through her life, to have much to put up with. Her second marriage, with its dubious prospects, seemed at first to be chiefly a source of difficulties and discomforts. The Duke, declaring that he was still too poor to live in England, moved about with uneasy precision through Belgium and Germany, attending parades and inspecting barracks in a neat military cap, while the English notabilities looked askance, and the Duke of Wellington dubbed him the Corporal. \"God damme!\" he exclaimed to Mr. Creevey, \"d'ye know what his sisters call him? By God! they call him Joseph Surface!\" At Valenciennes, where there was a review and a great dinner, the Duchess arrived with an old and ugly lady-in-waiting, and the Duke of Wellington found himself in a difficulty. \"Who the devil is to take out the maid of honour?\" he kept asking; but at last he thought of a solution. \"Damme, Freemantle, find out the mayor and let him do it.\" So the Mayor of Valenciennes was brought up for the purpose, and--so we learn from Mr. Creevey--\"a capital figure he was.\" A few days later, at Brussels, Mr. Creevey himself had an unfortunate experience. A military school was to be inspected--before breakfast. The company assembled; everything was highly satisfactory; but the Duke of Kent continued for so long examining every detail and asking meticulous question after meticulous question, that Mr. Creevey at last could bear it no longer, and whispered to his neighbour that he was damned hungry. The Duke of Wellington heard him, and was delighted. \"I recommend you,\" he said, \"whenever you start with the royal family in a morning, and particularly with THE CORPORAL, always to breakfast first.\" He and his staff, it turned out, had taken that precaution, and the great man amused himself, while the stream of royal inquiries poured on, by pointing at Mr. Creevey from time to time with the remark, \"Voila le monsieur qui n'a pas dejeune!\"  Settled down at last at Amorbach, the time hung heavily on the Duke's hands. The establishment was small, the country was impoverished; even clock-making grew tedious at last. He brooded--for in spite of his piety the Duke was not without a vein of superstition--over the prophecy of a gipsy at Gibraltar who told him that he was to have many losses and crosses, that he was to die in happiness, and that his only child was to be a great queen. Before long it became clear that a child was to be expected: the Duke decided that it should be born in England. Funds were lacking for the journey, but his determination was not to be set aside. Come what might, he declared, his child must be English-born. A carriage was hired, and the Duke himself mounted the box. Inside were the Duchess, her daughter Feodora, a girl of fourteen, with maids, nurses, lap-dogs, and canaries. Off they drove--through Germany, through France: bad roads, cheap inns, were nothing to the rigorous Duke and the equable, abundant Duchess. The Channel was crossed, London was reached in safety. The authorities provided a set of rooms in Kensington Palace; and there, on May 24, 1819, a female infant was born.    CHAPTER II. CHILDHOOD  I  The child who, in these not very impressive circumstances, appeared in the world, received but scant attention. There was small reason to foresee her destiny. The Duchess of Clarence, two months before, had given birth to a daughter, this infant, indeed, had died almost immediately; but it seemed highly probable that the Duchess would again become a mother; and so it actually fell out. More than this, the Duchess of Kent was young, and the Duke was strong; there was every likelihood that before long a brother would follow, to snatch her faint chance of the succession from the little princess.  Nevertheless, the Duke had other views: there were prophecies... At any rate, he would christen the child Elizabeth, a name of happy augury. In this, however, he reckoned without the Regent, who, seeing a chance of annoying his brother, suddenly announced that he himself would be present at the baptism, and signified at the same time that one of the godfathers was to be the Emperor Alexander of Russia. And so when the ceremony took place, and the Archbishop of Canterbury asked by what name he was to baptise the child, the Regent replied \"Alexandria.\" At this the Duke ventured to suggest that another name might be added. \"Certainly,\" said the Regent; \"Georgina?\" \"Or Elizabeth?\" said the Duke. There was a pause, during which the Archbishop, with the baby in his lawn sleeves, looked with some uneasiness from one Prince to the other. \"Very well, then,\" said the Regent at last, \"call her after her mother. But Alexandrina must come first.\" Thus, to the disgust of her father, the child was christened Alexandrina Victoria.  The Duke had other subjects of disgust. The meagre grant of the Commons had by no means put an end to his financial distresses. It was to be feared that his services were not appreciated by the nation. His debts continued to grow. For many years he had lived upon L7000 a year; but now his expenses were exactly doubled; he could make no further reductions; as it was, there was not a single servant in his meagre grant establishment who was idle for a moment"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12656"],["title","The Boy Allies at Liège; Or, Through Lines of Steel (#1)"],["body","their way to the side of the victims of the attack, and the four, with their backs to the wall, took a breathing spell.  \"You didn't arrive a moment too soon,\" said one of the young men, with a smile. \"I had begun to think we were due for a trimming.\"  \"There are four of us here,\" returned Hal, \"and we ought to be good for that crowd; but, instead of standing here, when they attack again, let's make a break and fight our way through. There will be more of them along in a minute, and it will be that much harder for us.\"  \"Good!\" returned the second stranger in French. \"Here they come!\"  \"Are you ready?\" asked Hal.  \"All ready,\" came the reply from the other three.  \"All right, then. Now!\"  At the word the four rushed desperately into the throng, which was pressing in on them from three sides. Taken by surprise, the enemy gave way for a moment; then closed in again.  Blows fell thick and fast for the space of a couple of minutes. Then, suddenly, Chester fell to the ground.  Turning, Hal fought his way to the other side of Chester's prostrate body. Then, bending down, he lifted his chum to his feet.  \"Hurt much?\" he asked.  \"No,\" replied Chester, shaking his head like an enraged bull. \"Let me get at them again!\"  He rushed in among his assailants with even greater desperation than before, and two young hoodlums fell before his blows.  In the meantime the strangers were giving a good account of themselves, and the enemy were falling before their smashing fists.  Hal ducked a blow from the closest of his assailants, and, stepping in close, struck him with all his power under the chin. The youth fell to the ground.  As he did so the ruffian nearest him, with a hiss of rage, drew a knife, with which he made a wicked slash at Hal. Hal did not see the movement, being closely pressed elsewhere, but Chester, with a sudden cry, leaped forward and seized the hand holding the knife, just as the weapon would have been buried in Hal's back.  \"You would, would you, you coward!\" he cried, and struck the young German in the face with all the strength of his right arm. The latter toppled over like a log.  All this time the crowd of assailants continued to grow. Attracted by the sounds of the scuffle, reinforcements arrived from all directions, and it is hard to tell what would have happened had not the sudden blast of a whistle interrupted the proceedings.  \"The police!\" yelled someone in the crowd. \"Run!\"  In less time than it takes to tell it, Hal, Chester, and the two other young men were alone, while racing toward them, down the street, were several figures in uniform.  \"Run!\" cried the young Frenchman. \"If they catch us we will all go to jail, and there is no telling when we'll get out. Run!\"  The four took to their heels, and, dodging around corner after corner, were soon safe from pursuit.  \"Well, I guess we are safe now,\" said the Englishman, when they stopped at last. Then, turning to Hal:  \"I don't know how to thank you and your friend. If you had not arrived when you did, I fear it would have fared badly with us.\"  \"No thanks are due,\" replied Hal. \"It's a poor American who would refuse to help anyone in trouble. Shake hands and call it square!\"  The Englishman smiled.  \"As modest as you are bold, eh? Well, all right,\" and he extended his hand, which Hal and Chester grasped in turn.  But the Frenchman was not to be put off so easily. He insisted on embracing both of the boys, much to their embarrassment.  \"I'm Lieutenant Harry Anderson, of the Tenth Dragoons, His Majesty's service,\" explained the Englishman, and then, turning to his friend: \"This is Captain Raoul Derevaux, Tenth Regiment, French Rifle Corps. We were strolling along the street when attacked by the gang from which you saved us. In the morning we shall try to get out of Germany by way of the Belgian frontier. If now, or at any other time, we may be of service to you, command us.\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" put in the Frenchman, \"I consider myself your debtor for life.\"  Hal and Chester thanked their newly-made friends for their good will, and, after a little further conversation, left them to continue their way, while they returned to the hotel, much to the relief of Mrs. Paine, who had become very uneasy at their long absence.     CHAPTER II.  A PERILOUS SITUATION.   \"Come on, Hal. Let's stroll about a few minutes. We've lots of time before the train pulls out.\"  It was Chester who spoke. Mrs. Paine and the two boys were sitting in their compartment of the Brussels express, in the station at Berlin. It still lacked ten minutes of the time set for departure.  \"You don't mind, do you, mother?\" said Hal.  \"No; if you do not go too far,\" was the answer.  The boys descended from the car, and wandered toward the entrance of the station. Just as they were about to step on to the street, a German military officer swung into the doorway. Hal, who was directly in his path, stepped aside, but not quickly enough to entirely avoid him.  With one outstretched arm the officer shoved him violently to one side, and then stopped.  \"What do you mean by blocking my way?\" he demanded. \"Do you know who I am?\"  Hal's temper was aroused.  \"No, I don't; and I don't care,\" was his reply.  \"Well, I'll give you something to care about,\" and, raising his hand, the officer made as though to strike Hal across the face.  \"Don't you strike me,\" said Hal quietly. \"I'm an American citizen, and I give you warning.\"  \"Warning!\" sneered the officer. \"You young American upstart! I'll have you whipped!\" and he turned as though to call someone.  At that moment there was a sudden cry of \"All aboard!\" and the officer, after taking a threatening step toward Hal, made a dash for the train.  \"I guess that is our train, Hal,\" said Chester. \"We had better hurry.\"  The lads retraced their steps toward their train. Reaching the shed, they saw the German officer disappearing into a compartment on the train.  \"That looks like our compartment to me,\" said Hal. \"I hope we don't have to ride with him.\"  \"I hope not,\" agreed Chester, and then broke into a run, as he shouted:  \"Hurry! The train is moving!\"  It was true. The boys had wasted too much time.  The door to one compartment was all that stood open, and that was the one in which Mrs. Paine could be seen gesticulating to them.  \"We just made it,\" panted Hal, as they reached the open door, and started to climb aboard.  At that instant a uniformed arm appeared through the door and pushed Hal away.  \"Go away, you American puppy,\" came a voice.  Hal slipped, and but for the prompt action of Chester, who caught him by the arm, would have fallen beneath the train.  The train gathered momentum, as the boys raced along beside it, in vain seeking an open door by which they might climb aboard. There was none but their own compartment, and that had passed them. It was impossible for them to overtake it, and there was not a train guard in sight.  The boys stopped running and stood still as the remainder of the train slipped past.  On ahead they could see Mrs. Paine and the big German officer, both gazing back toward them, the former gesticulating violently.  Hal stamped his foot with rage.  \"I'd like to get my hands on that big lout!\" he shouted. \"I'd--\"  \"Come, come, old fellow,\" interrupted Chester, \"never mind that, now. I don't blame you, but you can see it's impossible. You'll have to wait.\"  \"You are right, of course,\" replied Hal. \"The thing to do now is to send mother a telegram to the first station and tell her not to worry, that we shall be along on the next train. But, just the same, I'd like to get my hands on that--\"  \"Come, now,\" Chester interrupted again, \"let's send that telegram and find out when the next train leaves.\"  They found the telegraph office, and Hal prepared a message, which he handed through the window.  The clerk glanced at it, and then passed it back.  \"Can't be sent,\" he informed Hal.  \"Can't be sent! Why not?\"  \"Nothing can be sent over this wire but military messages from this time on,\" said the clerk.  \"But we missed the train, and I want to send this message to my mother, so she won't worry,\" pleaded Hal.  \"I'm sorry,\" the clerk returned kindly, \"but it is impossible. I must obey my orders.\"  Hal and Chester were nonplused.  \"What shall we do?\" questioned Chester.  \"The only thing I know to do,\" replied Hal, \"is to take the next train without telegraphing. Mother is sure to be at the Brussels station. I guess she knows we have enough sense to get there.\"  \"All right Let's find out when the next train leaves.\"  On their way to the ticket window, Hal stopped suddenly.  \"What's the matter\" asked Chester.  \"Matter!\" exclaimed Hal. \"The matter is I haven't any money. All I have was enough to send that telegram, and that amount won't get us to Brussels.\"  Chester reached in his pocket, and a startled expression came over his face.  \"Neither have I,\" he exclaimed, feeling first one pocket and then another. \"I have lost my pocketbook. All I have is a little change.\"  The lads looked at each other in silence for several minutes.  \"What shall we do?\" Chester asked finally.  \"I don't know what to do,\" replied Hal; \"but we have got to do something. I guess the best thing is to go back to the embassy and see if we can't raise the price of a couple of tickets. I am sure the ambassador will let us have it.\"  \"A good idea,\" said Chester. \"I guess the sooner we get there the better. Come on.\"  The ambassador received them immediately.  \"I'm awfully sorry, boys,\" he said, after listening to their troubles, \"but I am afraid I can do nothing for you.\"  \"Can't you lend us enough money to get to Brussels?\" asked Hal in surprise. \"You'll get it back, all right.\"  \"Yes, I can lend it to you, and I am not afraid of not getting it back.\"  \"Then why can't you help us?\"  \"The reason is this,\" the ambassador explained, \"this morning's train to Brussels was the last upon which foreigners were allowed to depart. The German government has given orders that all"]]]
