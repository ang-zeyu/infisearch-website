I clung to the office with the true limpet touch for many long months, but, alas, I was combed out at last. Since then I’ve been looking for a job. Now then--your turn.”  “There’s not so much promotion in mine,” said Tommy regretfully, “and a great deal less variety. I went out to France again, as you know. Then they sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded for the second time, and went into hospital out there. Then I got stuck in Egypt till the Armistice happened, kicked my heels there some time longer, and, as I told you, finally got demobbed. And, for ten long, weary months I’ve been job hunting! There aren’t any jobs! And, if there were, they wouldn’t give ‘em to me. What good am I? What do I know about business? Nothing.”  Tuppence nodded gloomily.  “What about the colonies?” she suggested.  Tommy shook his head.  “I shouldn’t like the colonies--and I’m perfectly certain they wouldn’t like me!”  “Rich relations?”  Again Tommy shook his head.  “Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?”  “I’ve got an old uncle who’s more or less rolling, but he’s no good.”  “Why not?”  “Wanted to adopt me once. I refused.”  “I think I remember hearing about it,” said Tuppence slowly. “You refused because of your mother----”  Tommy flushed.  “Yes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know, I was all she had. Old boy hated her--wanted to get me away from her. Just a bit of spite.”  “Your mother’s dead, isn’t she?” said Tuppence gently.  Tommy nodded.  Tuppence’s large grey eyes looked misty.  “You’re a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it.”  “Rot!” said Tommy hastily. “Well, that’s my position. I’m just about desperate.”  “So am I! I’ve hung out as long as I could. I’ve touted round. I’ve answered advertisements. I’ve tried every mortal blessed thing. I’ve screwed and saved and pinched! But it’s no good. I shall have to go home!”  “Don’t you want to?”  “Of course I don’t want to! What’s the good of being sentimental? Father’s a dear--I’m awfully fond of him--but you’ve no idea how I worry him! He has that delightful early Victorian view that short skirts and smoking are immoral. You can imagine what a thorn in the flesh I am to him! He just heaved a sigh of relief when the war took me off. You see, there are seven of us at home. It’s awful! All housework and mothers’ meetings! I have always been the changeling. I don’t want to go back, but--oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?”  Tommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then Tuppence burst out:  “Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night! I dare say it’s mercenary of me, but there it is!”  “Same here,” agreed Tommy with feeling.  “I’ve thought over every imaginable way of getting it too,” continued Tuppence. “There are only three! To be left it, to marry it, or to make it. First is ruled out. I haven’t got any rich elderly relatives. Any relatives I have are in homes for decayed gentlewomen! I always help old ladies over crossings, and pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case they should turn out to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them has ever asked me my name--and quite a lot never said ‘Thank you.’”  There was a pause.  “Of course,” resumed Tuppence, “marriage is my best chance. I made up my mind to marry money when I was quite young. Any thinking girl would! I’m not sentimental, you know.” She paused. “Come now, you can’t say I’m sentimental,” she added sharply.  “Certainly not,” agreed Tommy hastily. “No one would ever think of sentiment in connection with you.”  “That’s not very polite,” replied Tuppence. “But I dare say you mean it all right. Well, there it is! I’m ready and willing--but I never meet any rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard up as I am.”  “What about the general?” inquired Tommy.  “I fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,” explained Tuppence. “No, there it is! Now _you_ could marry a rich girl.”  “I’m like you. I don’t know any.”  “That doesn’t matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I see a man in a fur coat come out of the _Ritz_ I can’t rush up to him and say: ‘Look here, you’re rich. I’d like to know you.’”  “Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?”  “Don’t be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or something like that. If she thinks you want to know her she’s flattered, and will manage it for you somehow.”  “You overrate my manly charms,” murmured Tommy.  “On the other hand,” proceeded Tuppence, “my millionaire would probably run for his life! No--marriage is fraught with difficulties. Remains--to _make_ money!”  “We’ve tried that, and failed,” Tommy reminded her.  “We’ve tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the unorthodox. Tommy, let’s be adventurers!”  “Certainly,” replied Tommy cheerfully. “How do we begin?”  “That’s the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people might hire us to commit crimes for them.”  “Delightful,” commented Tommy. “Especially coming from a clergyman’s daughter!”  “The moral guilt,” Tuppence pointed out, “would be theirs--not mine. You must admit that there’s a difference between stealing a diamond necklace for yourself and being hired to steal it.”  “There wouldn’t be the least difference if you were caught!”  “Perhaps not. But I shouldn’t be caught. I’m so clever.”  “Modesty always was your besetting sin,” remarked Tommy.  “Don’t rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a business partnership?”  “Form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?”  “That was only an illustration. Let’s have a--what do you call it in book-keeping?”  “Don’t know. Never did any.”  “I have--but I always got mixed up, and used to put credit entries on the debit side, and vice versa--so they fired me out. Oh, I know--a joint venture! It struck me as such a romantic phrase to come across in the middle of musty old figures. It’s got an Elizabethan flavour about it--makes one think of galleons and doubloons. A joint venture!”  “Trading under the name of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.? Is that your idea, Tuppence?”  “It’s all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something in it.”  “How do you propose to get in touch with your would-be employers?”  “Advertisement,” replied Tuppence promptly. “Have you got a bit of paper and a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we have hairpins and powder-puffs.”  Tommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence began writing busily.  “Shall we begin: ‘Young officer, twice wounded in the war----’”  “Certainly not.”  “Oh, very well, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort of thing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she might adopt you, and then there would be no need for you to be a young adventurer at all.”  “I don’t want to be adopted.”  “I forgot you had a prejudice against it. I was only ragging you! The papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing. Now listen--how’s this? ‘Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.’ (We might as well make that clear from the start.) Then we might add: ‘No reasonable offer refused’--like flats and furniture.”  “I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a pretty _un_reasonable one!”  “Tommy! You’re a genius! That’s ever so much more chic. ‘No unreasonable offer refused--if pay is good.’ How’s that?”  “I shouldn’t mention pay again. It looks rather eager.”  “It couldn’t look as eager as I feel! But perhaps you are right. Now I’ll read it straight through. ‘Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No unreasonable offer refused.’ How would that strike you if you read it?”  “It would strike me as either being a hoax, or else written by a lunatic.”  “It’s not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning ‘Petunia’ and signed ‘Best Boy.’” She tore out the leaf and handed it to Tommy. “There you are. _Times_, I think. Reply to Box so-and-so. I expect it will be about five shillings. Here’s half a crown for my share.”  Tommy was holding the paper thoughtfully. His faced burned a deeper red.  “Shall we really try it?” he said at last. “Shall we, Tuppence? Just for the fun of the thing?”  “Tommy, you’re a sport! I knew you would be! Let’s drink to success.”  She poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups.  “Here’s to our joint venture, and may it prosper!”  “The Young Adventurers, Ltd.!” responded Tommy.  They put down the cups and laughed rather uncertainly. Tuppence rose.  “I must return to my palatial suite at the hostel.”  “Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the _Ritz_,” agreed Tommy with a grin. “Where shall we meet? And when?”  “Twelve o’clock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that suit you?”  “My time is my own,” replied Mr. Beresford magnificently.  “So long, then.”  “Good-bye, old thing.”  The two young people went off in opposite directions. Tuppence’s hostel was situated in what was charitably called Southern Belgravia. For reasons of economy she did not take a bus.  She was half-way across St. James’s Park, when a man’s voice behind her made her start.  “Excuse me,” it said. “But may I speak to you for a moment?”    CHAPTER II. MR. WHITTINGTON’S OFFER  TUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her tongue remained unspoken, for the man’s appearance and manner did not bear out her first and most natural assumption. She hesitated. As if he read her thoughts, the man said quickly:  “I can assure you I mean no disrespect.”  Tuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him instinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the particular motive which she had at first attributed to him. She looked him up and down. He was a big man, clean shaven, with a heavy jowl. His eyes were small and cunning, and shifted their glance under her direct gaze.  “Well, what is it?” she asked.  The man smiled.  “I happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young gentleman in Lyons’.”  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1155"],["title","The Secret Adversary (#2)"],["body","“Well--what of it?”  “Nothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you.”  Another inference forced itself into Tuppence’s mind:  “You followed me here?”  “I took that liberty.”  “And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?”  The man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a bow.  Tuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the inscription, “Mr. Edward Whittington.” Below the name were the words “Esthonia Glassware Co.,” and the address of a city office. Mr. Whittington spoke again:  “If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o’clock, I will lay the details of my proposition before you.”  “At eleven o’clock?” said Tuppence doubtfully.  “At eleven o’clock.”  Tuppence made up her mind.  “Very well. I’ll be there.”  “Thank you. Good evening.”  He raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence remained for some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a curious movement of her shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes himself.  “The adventures have begun,” she murmured to herself. “What does he want me to do, I wonder? There’s something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I don’t like at all. But, on the other hand, I’m not the least bit afraid of you. And as I’ve said before, and shall doubtless say again, little Tuppence can look after herself, thank you!”  And with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly onward. As a result of further meditations, however, she turned aside from the direct route and entered a post office. There she pondered for some moments, a telegraph form in her hand. The thought of a possible five shillings spent unnecessarily spurred her to action, and she decided to risk the waste of ninepence.  Disdaining the spiky pen and thick, black treacle which a beneficent Government had provided, Tuppence drew out Tommy’s pencil which she had retained and wrote rapidly: “Don’t put in advertisement. Will explain to-morrow.” She addressed it to Tommy at his club, from which in one short month he would have to resign, unless a kindly fortune permitted him to renew his subscription.  “It may catch him,” she murmured. “Anyway, it’s worth trying.”  After handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home, stopping at a baker’s to buy three penny-worth of new buns.  Later, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched buns and reflected on the future. What was the Esthonia Glassware Co., and what earthly need could it have for her services? A pleasurable thrill of excitement made Tuppence tingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had retreated into the background again. The morrow held possibilities.  It was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and, when at length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set her to washing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an unaccountable resemblance to hospital plates!  It wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the block of buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware Co. were situated. To arrive before the time would look over-eager. So Tuppence decided to walk to the end of the street and back again. She did so. On the stroke of eleven she plunged into the recesses of the building. The Esthonia Glassware Co. was on the top floor. There was a lift, but Tuppence chose to walk up.  Slightly out of breath, she came to a halt outside the ground glass door with the legend painted across it “Esthonia Glassware Co.”  Tuppence knocked. In response to a voice from within, she turned the handle and walked into a small rather dirty outer office.  A middle-aged clerk got down from a high stool at a desk near the window and came towards her inquiringly.  “I have an appointment with Mr. Whittington,” said Tuppence.  “Will you come this way, please.” He crossed to a partition door with “Private” on it, knocked, then opened the door and stood aside to let her pass in.  Mr. Whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with papers. Tuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed. There was something wrong about Mr. Whittington. The combination of his sleek prosperity and his shifty eye was not attractive.  He looked up and nodded.  “So you’ve turned up all right? That’s good. Sit down, will you?”  Tuppence sat down on the chair facing him. She looked particularly small and demure this morning. She sat there meekly with downcast eyes whilst Mr. Whittington sorted and rustled amongst his papers. Finally he pushed them away, and leaned over the desk.  “Now, my dear young lady, let us come to business.” His large face broadened into a smile. “You want work? Well, I have work to offer you. What should you say now to £100 down, and all expenses paid?” Mr. Whittington leaned back in his chair, and thrust his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat.  Tuppence eyed him warily.  “And the nature of the work?” she demanded.  “Nominal--purely nominal. A pleasant trip, that is all.”  “Where to?”  Mr. Whittington smiled again.  “Paris.”  “Oh!” said Tuppence thoughtfully. To herself she said: “Of course, if father heard that he would have a fit! But somehow I don’t see Mr. Whittington in the role of the gay deceiver.”  “Yes,” continued Whittington. “What could be more delightful? To put the clock back a few years--a very few, I am sure--and re-enter one of those charming _pensionnats de jeunes filles_ with which Paris abounds----”  Tuppence interrupted him.  “A _pensionnat?_”  “Exactly. Madame Colombier’s in the Avenue de Neuilly.”  Tuppence knew the name well. Nothing could have been more select. She had had several American friends there. She was more than ever puzzled.  “You want me to go to Madame Colombier’s? For how long?”  “That depends. Possibly three months.”  “And that is all? There are no other conditions?”  “None whatever. You would, of course, go in the character of my ward, and you would hold no communication with your friends. I should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being. By the way, you are English, are you not?”  “Yes.”  “Yet you speak with a slight American accent?”  “My great pal in hospital was a little American girl. I dare say I picked it up from her. I can soon get out of it again.”  “On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an American. Details about your past life in England might be more difficult to sustain. Yes, I think that would be decidedly better. Then----”  “One moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent for granted.”  Whittington looked surprised.  “Surely you are not thinking of refusing? I can assure you that Madame Colombier’s is a most high-class and orthodox establishment. And the terms are most liberal.”  “Exactly,” said Tuppence. “That’s just it. The terms are almost too liberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I can be worth that amount of money to you.”  “No?” said Whittington softly. “Well, I will tell you. I could doubtless obtain some one else for very much less. What I am willing to pay for is a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to sustain her part well, and also one who will have sufficient discretion not to ask too many questions.”  Tuppence smiled a little. She felt that Whittington had scored.  “There’s another thing. So far there has been no mention of Mr. Beresford. Where does he come in?”  “Mr. Beresford?”  “My partner,” said Tuppence with dignity. “You saw us together yesterday.”  “Ah, yes. But I’m afraid we shan’t require his services.”  “Then it’s off!” Tuppence rose. “It’s both or neither. Sorry--but that’s how it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington.”  “Wait a minute. Let us see if something can’t be managed. Sit down again, Miss----” He paused interrogatively.  Tuppence’s conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered the archdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came into her head.  “Jane Finn,” she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at the effect of those two simple words.  All the geniality had faded out of Whittington’s face. It was purple with rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And behind it all there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He leaned forward and hissed savagely:  “So that’s your little game, is it?”  Tuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head. She had not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she was naturally quick-witted, and felt it imperative to “keep her end up” as she phrased it.  Whittington went on:  “Been playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and mouse? Knew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the comedy. Is that it, eh?” He was cooling down. The red colour was ebbing out of his face. He eyed her keenly. “Who’s been blabbing? Rita?”  Tuppence shook her head. She was doubtful as to how long she could sustain this illusion, but she realized the importance of not dragging an unknown Rita into it.  “No,” she replied with perfect truth. “Rita knows nothing about me.”  His eyes still bored into her like gimlets.  “How much do you know?” he shot out.  “Very little indeed,” answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note that Whittington’s uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed. To have boasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in his mind.  “Anyway,” snarled Whittington, “you knew enough to come in here and plump out that name.”  “It might be my own name,” Tuppence pointed out.  “It’s likely, isn’t it, then there would be two girls with a name like that?”  “Or I might just have hit upon it by chance,” continued Tuppence, intoxicated with the success of truthfulness.  Mr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang.  “Quit fooling! How much do you know? And how much do you want?”  The last five words took Tuppence’s fancy mightily, especially after a meagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before. Her present part was of the adventuress rather than the adventurous order, but she did not deny its possibilities. She sat up and smiled with the air of one who"]]]
