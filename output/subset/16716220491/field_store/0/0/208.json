But for you, and for the service you are to render in Paris, we have no substitute. _You_ must not be found out. You are invaluable.\"  The spy inclined her head. \"I thank you,\" she said.  The officer sputtered indignantly.  \"It is not a compliment,\" he exclaimed; \"it is an order. You must not be found out!\"  Withdrawn some two hundred yards from the Paris road, the château stood upon a wooded hill. Except directly in front, trees of great height surrounded it. The tips of their branches brushed the windows; interlacing, they continued until they overhung the wall of the estate. Where it ran with the road the wall gave way to a lofty gate and iron fence, through which those passing could see a stretch of noble turf, as wide as a polo-field, borders of flowers disappearing under the shadows of the trees; and the château itself, with its terrace, its many windows, its high-pitched, sloping roof, broken by towers and turrets.  Through the remainder of the night there came from the road to those in the château the roar and rumbling of the army in retreat. It moved without panic, disorder, or haste, but unceasingly. Not for an instant was there a breathing-spell. And when the sun rose, the three spies--the two women and the chauffeur--who in the great château were now alone, could see as well as hear the gray column of steel rolling past below them.  The spies knew that the gray column had reached Claye, had stood within fifteen miles of Paris, and then upon Paris had turned its back. They knew also that the reverberations from the direction of Meaux, that each moment grew more loud and savage, were the French \"seventy-fives\" whipping the gray column forward. Of what they felt the Germans did not speak. In silence they looked at each other, and in the eyes of Marie was bitterness and resolve.  Toward noon Marie met Anfossi in the great drawing-room that stretched the length of the terrace and from the windows of which, through the park gates, they could see the Paris road.  \"This, that is passing now,\" said Marie, \"is the last of our rear-guard. Go to your tower,\" she ordered, \"and send word that except for stragglers and the wounded our column has just passed through Neufchelles, and that any moment we expect the French.\" She raised her hand impressively. \"From now,\" she warned, \"we speak French, we think French, we _are_ French!\"  Anfossi, or Briand, as now he called himself, addressed her in that language. His tone was bitter. \"Pardon my lese-majesty,\" he said, \"but this chief of your Intelligence Department is a _dummer Mensch_. He is throwing away a valuable life.\"  Marie exclaimed in dismay. She placed her hand upon his arm, and the violet eyes filled with concern.  \"Not yours!\" she protested.  \"Absolutely!\" returned the Italian. \"I can send nothing by this knapsack wireless that they will not learn from others; from airmen, Uhlans, the peasants in the fields. And certainly I will be caught. Dead I am dead, but alive and in Paris the opportunities are unending. From the French Legion Etranger I have my honorable discharge. I am an expert wireless operator and in their Signal Corps I can easily find a place. Imagine me, then, on the Eiffel Tower. From the air I snatch news from all of France, from the Channel, the North Sea. You and I could work together, as in Rome. But here, between the lines, with a pass from a village _sous préfet_, it is ridiculous. I am not afraid to die. But to die because some one else is stupid, that is hard.\"  Marie clasped his hand in both of hers.  \"You must not speak of death,\" she cried; \"you know I must carry out my orders, that I must force you to take this risk. And you know that thought of harm to you tortures me!\"  Quickly the young man disengaged his hand. The woman exclaimed with anger.  \"Why do you doubt me?\" she cried.  Briand protested vehemently.  \"I do not doubt you.\"  \"My affection, then?\" In a whisper that carried with it the feeling of a caress Marie added softly: \"My love?\"  The young man protested miserably. \"You make it very hard, mademoiselle,\" he cried. \"You are my superior officer, I am your servant. Who am I that I should share with others--\"  The woman interrupted eagerly.  \"Ah, you are jealous!\" she cried. \"Is that why you are so cruel? But when I _tell_ you I love you, and only you, can you not _feel_ it is the truth?\"  The young man frowned unhappily.  \"My duty, mademoiselle!\" he stammered.  With an exclamation of anger Marie left him. As the door slammed behind her, the young man drew a deep breath. On his face was the expression of ineffable relief.  In the hall Marie met her elderly companion, Bertha, now her aunt, Madame Benet.  \"I heard you quarrelling,\" Bertha protested. \"It is most indiscreet. It is not in the part of the Countess d'Aurillac that she makes love to her chauffeur.\"  Marie laughed noiselessly and drew her farther down the hall. \"He is imbecile!\" she exclaimed. \"He will kill me with his solemn face and his conceit. I make love to him--yes--that he may work the more willingly. But he will have none of it. He is jealous of the others.\"  Madame Benet frowned.  \"He resents the others,\" she corrected. \"I do not blame him. He is a gentleman!\"  \"And the others,\" demanded Marie; \"were they not of the most noble families of Rome?\"  \"I am old and I am ugly,\" said Bertha, \"but to me Anfossi is always as considerate as he is to you who are so beautiful.\"  \"An Italian gentleman,\" returned Marie, \"does not serve in Belgian Congo unless it is the choice of that or the marble quarries.\"  \"I do not know what his past may be,\" sighed Madame Benet, \"nor do I ask. He is only a number, as you and I are only numbers. And I beg you to let us work in harmony. At such a time your love-affairs threaten our safety. You must wait.\"  Marie laughed insolently. \"With the Du Barry,\" she protested, \"I can boast that I wait for no man.\"  \"No,\" replied the older woman; \"you pursue him!\"  Marie would have answered sharply, but on the instant her interest was diverted. For one week, by day and night, she had lived in a world peopled only by German soldiers. Beside her in the railroad carriage, on the station platforms, at the windows of the trains that passed the one in which she rode, at the grade crossings, on the bridges, in the roads that paralleled the tracks, choking the streets of the villages and spread over the fields of grain, she had seen only the gray-green uniforms. Even her professional eye no longer distinguished regiment from regiment, dragoon from grenadier, Uhlan from Hussar or Landsturm. Stripes, insignia, numerals, badges of rank, had lost their meaning. Those who wore them no longer were individuals. They were not even human. During the three last days the automobile, like a motor-boat fighting the tide, had crept through a gray-green river of men, stained, as though from the banks, by mud and yellow clay. And for hours, while the car was blocked, and in fury the engine raced and purred, the gray-green river had rolled past her, slowly but as inevitably as lava down the slope of a volcano, bearing on its surface faces with staring eyes, thousands and thousands of eyes, some fierce and bloodshot, others filled with weariness, homesickness, pain. At night she still saw them: the white faces under the sweat and dust, the eyes dumb, inarticulate, asking the answer. She had been suffocated by German soldiers, by the mass of them, engulfed and smothered; she had stifled in a land inhabited only by gray-green ghosts.  And suddenly, as though a miracle had been wrought, she saw upon the lawn, riding toward her, a man in scarlet, blue, and silver. One man riding alone.  Approaching with confidence, but alert; his reins fallen, his hands nursing his carbine, his eyes searched the shadows of the trees, the empty windows, even the sun-swept sky. His was the new face at the door, the new step on the floor. And the spy knew had she beheld an army corps it would have been no more significant, no more menacing, than the solitary _chasseur à cheval_ scouting in advance of the enemy.  \"We are saved!\" exclaimed Marie, with irony. \"Go quickly,\" she commanded, \"to the bedroom on the second floor that opens upon the staircase, so that you can see all who pass. You are too ill to travel. They must find you in bed.\"  \"And you?\" said Bertha.  \"I,\" cried Marie rapturously, \"hasten to welcome our preserver!\"  The preserver was a peasant lad. Under the white dust his cheeks were burned a brown-red, his eyes, honest and blue, through much staring at the skies and at horizon lines, were puckered and encircled with tiny wrinkles. Responsibility had made him older than his years, and in speech brief. With the beautiful lady who with tears of joy ran to greet him, and who in an ecstasy of happiness pressed her cheek against the nose of his horse, he was unimpressed. He returned to her her papers and gravely echoed her answers to his questions. \"This château,\" he repeated, \"was occupied by their General Staff; they have left no wounded here; you saw the last of them pass a half-hour since.\" He gathered up his reins.  Marie shrieked in alarm. \"You will not leave us?\" she cried.  For the first time the young man permitted himself to smile. \"Others arrive soon,\" he said.  He touched his shako, wheeled his horse in the direction from which he had come, and a minute later Marie heard the hoofs echoing through the empty village.  When they came, the others were more sympathetic. Even in times of war a beautiful woman is still a beautiful woman. And the staff officers who moved into the quarters so lately occupied by the enemy found in the presence of the Countess d'Aurillac"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11144"],["title","Somewhere in France (#2)"],["body","to distress them. In the absence of her dear friend, Madame Iverney, the châtelaine of the château, she acted as their hostess. Her chauffeur showed the company cooks the way to the kitchen, the larder, and the charcoal-box. She, herself, in the hands of General Andre placed the keys of the famous wine-cellar, and to the surgeon, that the wounded might be freshly bandaged, intrusted those of the linen-closet. After the indignities she had suffered while \"detained\" by _les Boches_, her delight and relief at again finding herself under the protection of her own people would have touched a heart of stone. And the hearts of the staff were not of stone. It was with regret they gave the countess permission to continue on her way. At this she exclaimed with gratitude. She assured them, were her aunt able to travel, she would immediately depart.  \"In Paris she will be more comfortable than here,\" said the kind surgeon. He was a reservist, and in times of peace a fashionable physician and as much at his ease in a boudoir as in a field hospital. \"Perhaps if I saw Madame Benet?\"  At the suggestion the countess was overjoyed. But they found Madame Benet in a state of complete collapse. The conduct of the Germans had brought about a nervous breakdown.  \"Though the bridges are destroyed at Meaux,\" urged the surgeon, \"even with a detour, you can be in Paris in four hours. I think it is worth the effort.\"  But the mere thought of the journey threw Madame Benet into hysterics. She asked only to rest, she begged for an opiate to make her sleep. She begged also that they would leave the door open, so that when she dreamed she was still in the hands of the Germans, and woke in terror, the sound of the dear French voices and the sight of the beloved French uniforms might reassure her. She played her part well. Concerning her Marie felt not the least anxiety. But toward Briand, the chauffeur, the new arrivals were less easily satisfied.  The general sent his adjutant for the countess. When the adjutant had closed the door General Andre began abruptly:  \"The chauffeur Briand,\" he asked, \"you know him; you can vouch for him?\"  \"But, certainly!\" protested Marie. \"He is an Italian.\"  As though with sudden enlightenment, Marie laughed. It was as if now in the suspicion of the officer she saw a certain reasonableness. \"Briand was so long in the Foreign Legion in Algiers,\" she explained, \"where my husband found him, that we have come to think of him as French. As much French as ourselves, I assure you.\"  The general and his adjutant were regarding each other questioningly.  \"Perhaps I should tell the countess,\" began the general, \"that we have learned--\"  The signal from the adjutant was so slight, so swift, that Marie barely intercepted it.  The lips of the general shut together like the leaves of a book. To show the interview was at an end, he reached for a pen.  \"I thank you,\" he said.  \"Of course,\" prompted the adjutant, \"Madame d'Aurillac understands the man must not know we inquired concerning him.\"  General Andre frowned at Marie.  \"Certainly not!\" he commanded. \"The honest fellow must not know that even for a moment he was doubted.\"  Marie raised the violet eyes reprovingly.  \"I trust,\" she said with reproach, \"I too well understand the feelings of a French soldier to let him know his loyalty is questioned.\"  With a murmur of appreciation the officers bowed and with a gesture of gracious pardon Marie left them.  Outside in the hall, with none but orderlies to observe, like a cloak the graciousness fell from her. She was drawn two ways. In her work Anfossi was valuable. But Anfossi suspected was less than of no value; he became a menace, a death-warrant.  General Andre had said, \"We have learned--\" and the adjutant had halted him. What had he learned? To know that, Marie would have given much. Still, one important fact comforted her. Anfossi alone was suspected. Had there been concerning herself the slightest doubt, they certainly would not have allowed her to guess her companion was under surveillance; they would not have asked one who was herself suspected to vouch for the innocence of a fellow conspirator. Marie found the course to follow difficult. With Anfossi under suspicion his usefulness was for the moment at an end; and to accept the chance offered her to continue on to Paris seemed most wise. On the other hand, if, concerning Anfossi, she had succeeded in allaying their doubts, the results most to be desired could be attained only by remaining where they were.  Their position inside the lines was of the greatest strategic value. The rooms of the servants were under the roof, and that Briand should sleep in one of them was natural. That to reach or leave his room he should constantly be ascending or descending the stairs also was natural. The field-wireless outfit, or, as he had disdainfully described it, the \"knapsack\" wireless, was situated not in the bedroom he had selected for himself, but in one adjoining. At other times this was occupied by the maid of Madame Iverney. To summon her maid Madame Iverney, from her apartment on the second floor, had but to press a button. And it was in the apartment of Madame Iverney, and on the bed of that lady, that Madame Benet now reclined. When through the open door she saw an officer or soldier mount the stairs, she pressed the button that rang a bell in the room of the maid. In this way, long before whoever was ascending the stairs could reach the top floor, warning of his approach came to Anfossi. It gave him time to replace the dust-board over the fireplace in which the wireless was concealed and to escape into his own bedroom. The arrangement was ideal. And already information picked up in the halls below by Marie had been conveyed to Anfossi to relay in a French cipher to the German General Staff at Rheims.  Marie made an alert and charming hostess. To all who saw her it was evident that her mind was intent only upon the comfort of her guests. Throughout the day many came and went, but each she made welcome; to each as he departed she called \"_bonne chance_.\" Efficient, tireless, tactful, she was everywhere: in the dining-room, in the kitchen, in the bedrooms, for the wounded finding mattresses to spread in the gorgeous salons of the champagne prince; for the soldier-chauffeurs carrying wine into the courtyard, where the automobiles panted and growled, and the arriving and departing shrieked for right of way. At all times an alluring person, now the one woman in a tumult of men, her smart frock covered by an apron, her head and arms bare, undismayed by the sight of the wounded or by the distant rumble of the guns, the Countess d'Aurillac was an inspiring and beautiful picture. The eyes of the officers, young and old, informed her of that fact, one of which already she was well aware. By the morning of the next day she was accepted as the owner of the château. And though continually she reminded the staff she was present only as the friend of her schoolmate, Madame Iverney, they deferred to her as to a hostess. Many of them she already saluted by name, and to those who with messages were constantly motoring to and from the front at Soissons she was particularly kind. Overnight the legend of her charm, of her devotion to the soldiers of all ranks, had spread from Soissons to Meaux, and from Meaux to Paris. It was noon of that day when from the window of the second story Marie saw an armored automobile sweep into the courtyard. It was driven by an officer, young and appallingly good-looking, and, as was obvious by the way he spun his car, one who held in contempt both the law of gravity and death. That he was some one of importance seemed evident. Before he could alight the adjutant had raced to meet him. With her eye for detail Marie observed that the young officer, instead of imparting information, received it. He must, she guessed, have just arrived from Paris, and his brother officer either was telling him the news or giving him his orders. Whichever it might be, in what was told him the new arrival was greatly interested. One instant in indignation his gauntleted fist beat upon the steering-wheel, the next he smiled with pleasure. To interpret this pantomime was difficult; and, the better to inform herself, Marie descended the stairs.  As she reached the lower hall the two officers entered. To the spy the man last to arrive was always the one of greatest importance; and Marie assured herself that through her friend, the adjutant, to meet with this one would prove easy.  But the chauffeur commander of the armored car made it most difficult. At sight of Marie, much to her alarm, as though greeting a dear friend, he snatched his kepi from his head and sprang toward her.  \"The major,\" he cried, \"told me you were here, that you are Madame d'Aurillac.\" His eyes spoke his admiration. In delight he beamed upon her. \"I might have known it!\" he murmured. With the confidence of one who is sure he brings good news, he laughed happily. \"And I,\" he cried, \"am 'Pierrot'!\"  Who the devil \"Pierrot\" might be the spy could not guess. She knew only that she wished by a German shell \"Pierrot\" and his car had been blown to tiny fragments. Was it a trap, she asked herself, or was the handsome youth really some one the Countess d'Aurillac should know. But, as from his introducing himself it was evident he could not know that lady very well, Marie took courage and smiled.  \"_Which_ 'Pierrot'?\" she parried.  \"Pierre Thierry!\" cried the youth.  To the relief of Marie he turned upon the adjutant and to him explained who Pierre Thierry might be.  \"Paul d'Aurillac,\" he said, \"is my dearest friend. When he married this charming lady I was stationed in Algiers, and but for the war I might never have met her.\"  To Marie, with his hand on his heart in a most charming manner, he bowed. His admiration he made no effort to conceal.  \"And so,\" he said, \"I know why there is war!\"  The adjutant smiled"]]]
