I'll eat a bite before I take her up.\"  You've no doubt suspected before now that not even poker, played industriously o' nights, could keep Casey's head above the financial waters that threatened to drown him and his Ford and his reputation. Casey did not mind repair bills, so long as he achieved the speed he wanted. But he did mind not being able to pay the repair bills when they were presented to him. Whatever else were his faults, Casey Ryan had always gone cheerfully into his pocket and paid what he owed. Now he was haunted by a growing fear that an unlucky game or two would send him under, and that he might not come up again.  He began to think seriously of selling his car and going back to horses which, in spite of the high cost of feeding them, had paid their way and his, and left him a pleasant jingle in his pockets. But then he bumped hard into one of those queer little psychological facts which men never take into account until it is too late. Casey Ryan, who had driven horses since he could stand on his toes and fling harness on their backs, could not go back to driving horses. The speed fiend of progress had him by the neck. Horses were too slow for Casey. Moreover, when he began to think about it, he knew that the thirty-mile stretch between Pinnacle and Lund had become too tame for him, too monotonous. He knew in the dark every twist in the road, every sharp turn, and he could tell you offhand what every sharp turn had cost him in the past month, either in repairs to his own car or to the car that had unluckily met him without warning. For Casey, I must tell you, habitually forgot all about that earsplitting klaxon at his left elbow. He was always in too much of a hurry to blow it; and anyway, by the time he reached a turn, he was around it; there either was no car in the road or Casey had scraped paint off it or worse and gone on. So why honk?  Far distances called Casey. In one day, he meditated, he could cover more desert with his Ford than horses could travel in a week. An old, half-buried passion stirred, lifted its head and smiled at him seductively,--a dream he had dreamed of finding some of that wealth which Nature holds so miser-like in her hills. A gold mine, or perhaps silver or copper,--what matter which mineral he found, so long as it spelled wealth for him? Then he would buy a bigger car and a faster car, and he would bore farther and farther into yonder. In his past were tucked away months on end of tramping across deserts and up mountain defiles with a packed burro nipping patiently along in front of him and this same, seductive dream beckoning him over the next horizon. Burros had been slow. While he hurtled down the road from Pinnacle to Lund, Casey pictured himself plodding through sand and sage and over malapai and up dry canyons, hazing a burro before him.  \"No, sir, the time for that is gone by. I could do in a week now what it took me a month to do then. I could get into country a man'd hate to tackle afoot, not knowing the water holes. I'll git me a radiator that don't boil like a teakettle over a pitch fire, and load up with water and grub and gas, and I'll find the Injun Jim mine, mebby. Or some other darn mine that'll put me in the clear the rest of my life. Couldn't before, because I had to travel too slow. But shucks! A Ford can go anywhere a mountain goat can go. You ask anybody.\"  So Casey sold his stage line and the hypothetical good will that went with it, and Pinnacle and Lund breathed long and deep and planned trips they had refrained from taking heretofore, and wished Casey luck. Bill Masters laid a friendly hand on his shoulder and made a suggestion so wise that not even Casey could shut his mind against it.  \"You're starting out where there won't be no Bill handy to fix what you bust,\" he pointed out. \"You wait over a day or two, Casey, and let me show yuh a few things about that car. If you bust down on the desert you'll want to know what's wrong, and how to fix it. It's easy, but you got to know where to look for the trouble.\"  \"Me? Say, Bill, I never had to go lookin' for trouble,\" Casey grinned. \"What do I need to learn how for?\"  Nevertheless he remained all of that day with Bill and crammed on mechanics. He was amazed to discover how many and how different were the ailments that might afflict a Ford. That he had boldly--albeit unconsciously--driven a thing filled with timers, high-tension plugs that may become fouled and fail to \"spark,\" carburetors that could get out of adjustment (whatever that was) spark plugs that burned out and had to be replaced, a transmission that absolutely _must_ have grease or something happened, bearings that were prone to burn out if they went dry of oil, and a multitude of other mishaps that could happen and did happen if one did not watch out, would have filled Casey with foreboding if that were possible. Being an optimist to the middle of his bones, he merely felt a growing pride in himself. He had actually driven all this aggregation of potential internal grief! Whenever anything had happened to his Ford auty-_mo_-bile between Pinnacle and Lund, Casey never failed to trace the direct cause, which had always been external rather than internal, save that time when he had walked in and bought a new car without out probing into the vitals of the other.  \"I'd ruther have a horse down with glanders,\" he sighed, when Bill finally washed the grease off his hands and forearms and rolled down his sleeves. \"But Casey Ryan's game to try anything once, and most things the second and third time. You ask anybody. Gimme all the hootin'-annies that's liable to wear out, Bill, and a load uh tires and patches, and Casey'll come back and hand yuh a diamond big as your fist, some day. Ole Lady Trouble's always tryin' to take a fall outa me, but she's never got me down so't I had to holler 'nough. You ask anybody. Casey Ryan's goin' out to see what he can see. If he meets up with Miss Fortune, he'll tame her, Bill. And this little Ford auty-_mo_-bile is goin' to eat outa my hand. I don't give a cuss if she does git sore and ram her spark plugs into her carburetor now and agin. She'll know who's boss, Bill. I learnt it to the burros, and what you can learn a burro you can learn a Ford, take time enough.\"  Taking that point of view and keeping it, Casey managed very well. Whenever anything went wrong that his vocabulary and a monkey wrench could not mend, Casey sat down on the shadiest running board and conned the Instruction Book which Bill handed him at the last minute. Other times he treated the Ford exactly as he would treat a burro, with satisfactory results.     CHAPTER III   Away out on the high mesas that are much like the desert below, except that the nights are cool and the wind is not fanned out of a furnace, Casey fought sand and brush and rocks and found a trail now and then which he followed thankfully, and so came at last to a short range of mountains whose name matched well their inhospitable stare. The Starvation Mountains had always been reputed rich in mineral and malevolent in their attitude toward man and beast. Even the Joshua trees stood afar off and lifted grotesque arms defensively against them. But Casey was not easily daunted, and eerie places held for him no meaning save the purely material one. If he could find water and the rich vein of ore some one had told him was there, then Casey would be happy in spite of snakes, tarantulas and sinister stories of the place.  Water he found, not too far up a gulch. So he pitched his tent within carrying distance from the spring, thanked the god of mechanics that an automobile neither eats nor drinks when it does not work, and set out to find his fortune.  Casey knew there was a mining camp on the high slope of Barren Butte. He knew the name of the camp, which was Lucky Lode, and he knew the foreman there--knew him from long ago in the days when Casey was what he himself confessed to be wild. In reaching Starvation Mountains, Casey had driven for fifteen miles within plain sight of Lucky Lode. But gas is precious when you are a hundred miles from a garage, and since business did not take him there Casey did not drive up the five-mile hill to the Lucky Lode just to shake hands with the foreman and swap a yarn or two. Instead, he headed down on to the bleached, bleak oval of Furnace Lake and forged across it as straight as he could drive toward Starvation Mountains.  But the next time Casey made the trip--needing supplies, powder, fuse, caps and so on--Fate took him by the ear and led him to a lady. This is how Fate did it,--and I will say it was an original idea:  Casey had a gallon syrup can in the car which he used for extra oil for the engine. Having an appetite for sour-dough biscuits and syrup, he had also a gallon can of syrup in the car. It was a terrifically hot day, and the wind that blew full against Casey's left cheek as he drove burned even his leather skin where it struck. Casey was afraid he was running short of water, and a Ford's comfort comes first,--as every man knows; so that Casey was parched pretty thoroughly, inside and out. Within a mile of Furnace Lake he stopped, took an unsatisfying sip from his big canteen and emptied the rest of the water into the radiator. Then he replenished the oil in the motor generously, cranked and went bumping along down the trail worn rough with the trucks from Lucky Lode.  For a little way he jounced along the trail; then the motor began to labor; and although Casey pulled the gas lever down as far as it would go, the car slowed and stopped dead in the road. After an hour of fruitless monkey-wrenching and swearing and sweating, Casey began to suspect something. He examined both cans, \"hefted\" them, smelt and even tasted the one half-empty, and decided that Ford auty-_mo_-biles do not require two quarts of syrup at one dose. He thought that a little syrup ought not to make much"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1250"],["title","Anthem (#1)"],["body","inventions come from the Home of the       Scholars, such as the newest one, which was found only a hundred       years ago, of how to make candles from wax and string; also, how       to make glass, which is put in our windows to protect us from the       rain. To find these things, the Scholars must study the earth and       learn from the rivers, from the sands, from the winds and the       rocks. And if we went to the Home of the Scholars, we could learn       from these also. We could ask questions of these, for they do not       forbid questions.        And questions give us no rest. We know not why our curse makes us       seek we know not what, ever and ever. But we cannot resist it. It       whispers to us that there are great things on this earth of ours,       and that we can know them if we try, and that we must know them.       We ask, why must we know, but it has no answer to give us. We       must know that we may know.        So we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars. We wished it       so much that our hands trembled under the blankets in the night,       and we bit our arm to stop that other pain which we could not       endure. It was evil and we dared not face our brothers in the       morning. For men may wish nothing for themselves. And we were       punished when the Council of Vocations came to give us our life       Mandates which tell those who reach their fifteenth year what       their work is to be for the rest of their days.        The Council of Vocations came on the first day of spring, and       they sat in the great hall. And we who were fifteen and all the       Teachers came into the great hall. And the Council of Vocations       sat on a high dais, and they had but two words to speak to each       of the Students. They called the Students’ names, and when the       Students stepped before them, one after another, the Council       said: “Carpenter” or “Doctor” or “Cook” or “Leader.” Then each       Student raised their right arm and said: “The will of our       brothers be done.”        Now if the Council has said “Carpenter” or “Cook,” the Students       so assigned go to work and they do not study any further. But if       the Council has said “Leader,” then those Students go into the       Home of the Leaders, which is the greatest house in the City, for       it has three stories. And there they study for many years, so       that they may become candidates and be elected to the City       Council and the State Council and the World Council—by a free and       general vote of all men. But we wished not to be a Leader, even       though it is a great honor. We wished to be a Scholar.        So we awaited our turn in the great hall and then we heard the       Council of Vocations call our name: “Equality 7-2521.” We walked       to the dais, and our legs did not tremble, and we looked up at       the Council. There were five members of the Council, three of the       male gender and two of the female. Their hair was white and their       faces were cracked as the clay of a dry river bed. They were old.       They seemed older than the marble of the Temple of the World       Council. They sat before us and they did not move. And we saw no       breath to stir the folds of their white togas. But we knew that       they were alive, for a finger of the hand of the oldest rose,       pointed to us, and fell down again. This was the only thing which       moved, for the lips of the oldest did not move as they said:       “Street Sweeper.”        We felt the cords of our neck grow tight as our head rose higher       to look upon the faces of the Council, and we were happy. We knew       we had been guilty, but now we had a way to atone for it. We       would accept our Life Mandate, and we would work for our       brothers, gladly and willingly, and we would erase our sin       against them, which they did not know, but we knew. So we were       happy, and proud of ourselves and of our victory over ourselves.       We raised our right arm and we spoke, and our voice was the       clearest, the steadiest voice in the hall that day, and we said:        “The will of our brothers be done.”        And we looked straight into the eyes of the Council, but their       eyes were as cold blue glass buttons.        So we went into the Home of the Street Sweepers. It is a grey       house on a narrow street. There is a sundial in its courtyard, by       which the Council of the Home can tell the hours of the day and       when to ring the bell. When the bell rings, we all arise from our       beds. The sky is green and cold in our windows to the east. The       shadow on the sundial marks off a half-hour while we dress and       eat our breakfast in the dining hall, where there are five long       tables with twenty clay plates and twenty clay cups on each       table. Then we go to work in the streets of the City, with our       brooms and our rakes. In five hours, when the sun is high, we       return to the Home and we eat our midday meal, for which one-half       hour is allowed. Then we go to work again. In five hours, the       shadows are blue on the pavements, and the sky is blue with a       deep brightness which is not bright. We come back to have our       dinner, which lasts one hour. Then the bell rings and we walk in       a straight column to one of the City Halls, for the Social       Meeting. Other columns of men arrive from the Homes of the       different Trades. The candles are lit, and the Councils of the       different Homes stand in a pulpit, and they speak to us of our       duties and of our brother men. Then visiting Leaders mount the       pulpit and they read to us the speeches which were made in the       City Council that day, for the City Council represents all men       and all men must know. Then we sing hymns, the Hymn of       Brotherhood, and the Hymn of Equality, and the Hymn of the       Collective Spirit. The sky is a soggy purple when we return to       the Home. Then the bell rings and we walk in a straight column to       the City Theatre for three hours of Social Recreation. There a       play is shown upon the stage, with two great choruses from the       Home of the Actors, which speak and answer all together, in two       great voices. The plays are about toil and how good it is. Then       we walk back to the Home in a straight column. The sky is like a       black sieve pierced by silver drops that tremble, ready to burst       through. The moths beat against the street lanterns. We go to our       beds and we sleep, till the bell rings again. The sleeping halls       are white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds.        Thus have we lived each day of four years, until two springs ago       when our crime happened. Thus must all men live until they are       forty. At forty, they are worn out. At forty, they are sent to       the Home of the Useless, where the Old Ones live. The Old Ones do       not work, for the State takes care of them. They sit in the sun       in summer and they sit by the fire in winter. They do not speak       often, for they are weary. The Old Ones know that they are soon       to die. When a miracle happens and some live to be forty-five,       they are the Ancient Ones, and the children stare at them when       passing by the Home of the Useless. Such is to be our life, as       that of all our brothers and of the brothers who came before us.        Such would have been our life, had we not committed our crime       which changed all things for us. And it was our curse which drove       us to our crime. We had been a good Street Sweeper and like all       our brother Street Sweepers, save for our cursed wish to know. We       looked too long at the stars at night, and at the trees and the       earth. And when we cleaned the yard of the Home of the Scholars,       we gathered the glass vials, the pieces of metal, the dried bones       which they had discarded. We wished to keep these things and to       study them, but we had no place to hide them. So we carried them       to the City Cesspool. And then we made the discovery.        It was on a day of the spring before last. We Street Sweepers       work in brigades of three, and we were with Union 5-3992, they of       the half-brain, and with International 4-8818. Now Union 5-3992       are a sickly lad and sometimes they are stricken with       convulsions, when their mouth froths and their eyes turn white.       But International 4-8818 are different. They are a tall, strong       youth and their eyes are like fireflies, for there is laughter in       their eyes. We cannot look upon International 4-8818 and not       smile in answer. For this they were not liked in the Home of the       Students, as it is not proper to smile without reason. And also       they were not liked because they took pieces of coal and they       drew pictures upon the walls, and they were pictures which made       men laugh. But it is only our brothers in the Home of the Artists       who are permitted to draw pictures, so International 4-8818 were       sent to the Home of the Street Sweepers, like ourselves.        International 4-8818 and we are friends. This is an evil thing to       say, for it is a transgression, the great Transgression of       Preference, to love any among men better than the others, since       we must love all men and all men are our friends. So       International 4-8818 and we have never spoken of it. But we know.       We know, when we look into each other’s eyes. And when we look       thus without words, we both know other things also, strange       things for which there are no words, and these things frighten       us.        So on that day of the spring before last, Union 5-3992 were       stricken with convulsions on the edge of the City, near the City       Theatre. We left them to lie in the shade of the Theatre"]]]
