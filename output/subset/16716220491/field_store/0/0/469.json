Again Colonel Edwards expressed his thanks, in which the others joined, and then he led the way toward the distant tents.  Fifteen minutes later the four friends were sleeping soundly, with never a care in the world, for it had been long since they had closed their eyes and they were completely worn out.  Darkness shrouded the small tent when Hal opened his eyes. It was several moments before the lad could gain his bearings, but when at last he realized just where he was he bethought himself of the others.  \"Still sleeping, I guess,\" he said.  He arose, moved to the door of the tent and passed out. A steady rumbling sound fell upon his ears and Hal, momentarily, was unable to account for it. But the solution soon came to him.  \"Troops moving,\" he told himself.  He was right. Walking some distance from the tent, he made out, probably half a mile away, the dark forms of many men as they marched swiftly on in the darkness, their figures lighted up ever and anon by the gleam of a flashlight. But the camp in which the lad stood was perfectly quiet.  \"Now I wonder--\" he muttered--gazed silently ahead a moment and then turned back toward the tent, saying to himself: \"Guess I'll wake the others up.\"  Chester and Colonel Anderson were aroused without much trouble. Not so Stubbs.  \"What's the matter?\" came the little man's query, when Hal prodded him gently in the ribs with his foot.  \"Time to get up,\" said Hal, briefly.  For a moment Stubbs opened his eyes and peered into the darkness--for Hal had made no light.  \"Get up?\" he exclaimed. \"What! Anthony Stubbs get up in the middle of the night? Not much!\"  \"But we are going, Stubbs,\" said Hal. \"We don't want to leave you here by yourself.\"  \"Kind of you,\" said Stubbs sarcastically. \"I can remember when you were not so solicitious of my welfare. Don't worry about me. I'll just sleep right along.\"  He turned over and a loud snore a few moments later told that he was again in the land of dreams.  Again Hal prodded him with his foot.  \"Stubbs! I say, Stubbs!\" he called.  Directly Stubbs opened his eyes.  \"And what's the matter this time?\" he demanded aggrievedly.  \"Hurry!\" Hal exclaimed, thinking to get the little man up by a ruse. \"The Austrians are coming.\"  \"Run, then!\" replied Stubbs. \"I'll hide here. They won't bother me.\"  \"Now listen here, Stubs,\" said Chester, \"just when do you want to get up?\"  Again Stubbs allowed his eyes to open and he peered into the darkness sleepily.  \"What day is this?\" he inquired mildly.  \"Tuesday,\" replied Chester; \"but what--\"  \"Then call me Saturday,\" said the little man gently, and closed his eyes in sleep once more.  \"Ha! Ha!\" laughed Colonel Anderson. \"He had you there, Chester.\"  Chester appeared somewhat flustered.  \"Well, he'll have to get up out of there,\" he said wrathfully.  \"Oh, come on and let him be, Chester,\" said Hal. \"I guess nothing will hurt him. We'll be back by daylight and I'll venture to say we will find him here, still snoring.\"  \"Well, all right,\" Chester agreed at length; \"but to tell you the truth, I don't just like that answer he gave me.\"  The three left the tent and Hal led the way toward where he had so recently perceived the passing troops.  Infantry, cavalry and artillery were still passing in dense masses, moving westward.  \"I wonder where they are going?\" said Chester.  \"To the front, I suppose,\" replied Hal.  \"Now do you really suppose they are?\" asked Chester sarcastically. \"I thought perhaps they were on dress parade. Say, just where are we anyhow? Do either of you know?\"  \"By Jove!\" exclaimed Colonel Anderson. \"I meant to ask Edwards, but I forgot all about it. He told us, you remember, he would be in the tent on our left. We'll go back and have him out. Perhaps we can learn a few things.\"  \"Suits me,\" Hal agreed. \"We can't see anything here but troops, and we have seen too many of them to be much interested. Come on.\"  Fifteen minutes later found them seated in the tent Colonel Edwards had commandeered for his temporary headquarters and the colonel himself doing the talking.  \"You are perhaps fifteen miles northwest of Cettinje, the capital of Montenegro,\" he explained.  \"And where are these troops going?\" asked Hal.  \"Reinforcements to the Austrian front,\" said Colonel Edwards. \"Also some of them, can they be spared, will be rushed to the aid of the Serbians, who, from all accounts, are being sorely pressed by the new German offensive.\"  \"New German offensive?\" exclaimed Hal.  \"Why, yes. Haven't you heard of it?\"  \"No. Will you explain?\"  \"I'll try,\" said Colonel Edwards. \"I'll revert back to the start. On Friday, August 13, news reached London, where I was then stationed, that an Austro-German army of more than 300,000 men was massing at a point on the Serbian frontier and it was asserted that the Kaiser was about to strike a blow at Serbia in order to improve Teuton prospects in the Balkans, where Roumania and Greece had been reported as waiting a favorable opportunity to join the Allies.  \"The great German victories in Russia, following the fall of Warsaw, had, however, caused the Balkan kingdoms to waver, and Bulgaria was said to have strong pro-German leanings. On August 16 the Austro-German army crossed the frontier and began a bombardment of Belgrade, the capital. This led to a crisis in the Greek parliament, where the Venizelos party caused the downfall of the cabinet, which supported the king's attitude of strict neutrality--a neutrality he had promised his consort, who is the sister of the Kaiser, as you know.  \"On August 21 Serbia made it known that in accordance with the advice of the Allies, she was willing to grant the demands of Bulgaria for the return of territory taken in the last Balkan war, and for a time it seemed that Bulgaria would enter the war on the side of the Allies. However, on September 19 it was said that Bulgaria would join the Central Powers, thus permitting Germany to establish an unbroken line of allies from the Baltic to the Bosporus.  \"On October 5, the Allies, upon invitation of the Greek premier, began the disembarkation of troops at Saloniki to go to the assistance of the Serbians; and, so far as I know, they are still landing.\"  The three friends had listened attentively to this account of the Balkan situation. They had heard some inkling of the seriousness of the Serbian plight, but had not realized until now that Germany had at last set out to crush the little Balkan kingdom as she had crushed Belgium in the early days of the great war.  \"And what is the latest on the Bulgarian attitude?\" asked Colonel Anderson.  \"Well, I haven't heard anything later than I have told you, but my personal opinion is that Bulgaria, sooner or later, will join the Germans.\"  \"Fools,\" said Colonel Anderson, briefly.  \"And Greece?\" inquired Chester.  \"I don't know, but I believe Greece will keep out of the war just as long as she possibly can. Certainly, the Greek people will never consent to aiding the Germans.\"  \"You never can tell,\" said Colonel Anderson sententiously.  Outside the tent it was now growing light, for time had passed swiftly. Hal noticed the light filtering in.  \"Great Scott! I had no idea it was morning,\" he said. \"It must have been after midnight when we awoke. Let's get outside.\"  They left the tent and Hal went into their own quarters a moment, where he found Stubbs up and about to emerge. Together the five walked toward the eastern extremity of the camp.  Came a sudden blaring of trumpets and a body of horse swept toward them. The riders drew rein almost before the friends, dismounted and stood at attention, while a figure who had been in the center also jumped to the ground. This figure of huge stature, a man of advanced age, who dismounted nimbly in spite of his years, walked toward the spot where stood the five friends. Edwards came to attention, as did the others.  \"The king!\" said Colonel Edwards in a low voice.     CHAPTER IV.  INTO THE MOUNTAINS.   Nicholas, king of the Montenegrins, came forward slowly, his head bowed as though in grief, and it seemed for a moment as though he would pass Hal, Chester and the others without seeing them. But even as he drew abreast of the five, he looked up suddenly. His gaze rested upon Colonel Edwards and the Englishman bowed low. Colonel Anderson did likewise. Hal, Chester and Stubbs remained erect.  The king smiled slightly at Colonel Edwards, whom he plainly knew, and glanced inquiringly at the others.  Colonel Edwards approached him.  \"Your majesty,\" he said, \"I would crave your permission to present another of my countrymen and three Americans, who have seen service with your allies in the western theater of war.\"  The king nodded his head affirmatively and Colonel Edwards motioned the others to approach. The king extended a hand to each and spoke a few pleasant words.  \"I hope,\" he said, \"that you will make yourselves perfectly at home in my camp. I am sorry I have no better to offer you.\" He turned to Edwards. \"I have faith in you English,\" he said, \"and for that reason I was about to summon you this morning. I have a mission of importance, and some danger, I would have you undertake.\"  \"I shall be pleased, sire\" replied Colonel Edwards with a bow.  The king smiled.  \"I knew you would be,\" he said. \"Now this mission will necessitate probably more than a single man. You shall pick the others. It seems simple, but I can assure you it is not. Among the Albanian tribesmen, I am told, there is a disposition to doubt the justice of our cause and the cause of our allies. A spirit of unrest is rife there. I would have it looked into. I have faith in the majority of the Albanians, but a few agitators could do much harm right now. The reason I say one man could"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12808"],["title","Frank on a Gun-Boat (#1)"],["body","the idea of serving out their year on the Mississippi River was not an agreeable one. They had hoped to be ordered to the coast. But, as Archie remarked, it was \"too late to back out,\" and they were obliged to submit. When Archie came to bid farewell to his parents, he found it to be a much more difficult task than he had expected. The tears would come to his eyes, in spite of himself, as he embraced his mother; and, as soon as he could disengage himself from her arms, he seized his bag and hammock, and rushed out of the house to conceal his emotion. When they reached the depot, they found that the draft to which they belonged numbered nearly two hundred men, some of whom were old sailors, while others, like themselves, were entirely unacquainted with the life they were about to lead.  The journey to Cairo--which was then the naval depot of the Western rivers--was a long and tedious one. They were treated with the greatest kindness by the officers who accompanied them, and at almost every station the people would flock around the cars with baskets of provisions, which were freely distributed.  Early on the fifth morning they reached their destination, and were immediately marched on board a small steamer which lay alongside of the naval wharf-boat, and carried to the receiving-ship, which lay anchored in the middle of the river.     CHAPTER II.  Learning the Ropes.   As they came on board the receiving-ship they were all drawn up in a line, the roll was called, and they were divided off into messes. The mess to which Frank and his cousin belonged was called \"Number Twenty-five.\" As they were about to be dismissed, the officer who had called the roll said to Archie:  \"You will be cook of this mess.\"  \"Sir?\" said Archie, in surprise.  \"You will be cook of this mess,\" repeated the officer, in a louder tone. \"But what is the matter with you? Are you hard of hearing?\"  \"No, sir; but I can't cook.\"  \"Never mind; you can try. You may go below, lads.\"  The men did as they were ordered, and our heroes seated themselves on one of the broadside guns, and Archie said:  \"I'm in a nice fix, ain't I? I don't know any more about cooking than a hog does about gunpowder.\"  \"I will assist you all I can,\" said Frank; \"but I wonder what we shall have for dinner? I hope it will be something good, for I'm as hungry as a bear.\"  At this moment the whistle of the boatswain's mate sounded through the ship, and that personage passed them and called out, in a low voice:  \"Mess cook Number Twenty-five!\"  \"He means me, don't he?\" inquired Archie, turning to his cousin.  \"I don't know, I'm sure. Ask him.\"  \"Mess cook Number Twenty-five,\" again shouted the mate.  \"Here I am,\" said Archie.  \"Well, you ought to be somewhere else,\" said the mate, sharply. \"Why don't you go and draw your rations?\"  \"I don't know where I should go,\" answered Archie.  \"Then fly around and find out;\" and the mate turned on his heel and walked away.  \"Now, that's provoking,\" exclaimed Archie. \"Why couldn't he tell a fellow where to go? I'll tell that officer that I didn't ship for a cook; I shipped to fight. I wish I was at home again.\"  But regrets were worse than useless, and Archie began to look around to find some one who could tell him where to go to draw his rations. At length he met one of the men who belonged to his mess, whose name was Simpson, who told him that he must go to the paymaster's store-room, and offered to show him the way; and, as he saw that Archie was entirely unacquainted with life on shipboard, Simpson told him to come to him whenever he wanted any advice.  As Archie entered the store-room, the paymaster's steward, a boy about his own age, who was serving out the provisions, after inquiring the number of his mess, said:  \"It's lucky that you came in just as you did, for I have sent the master-at-arms after you. If you don't attend to your business better than this, I shall have you put on the black-list for a week or two.\"  Now, Archie had never been accustomed to being \"ordered about by any boy of his size,\" as he afterward remarked, and he felt very much like making an angry reply. But he knew it would only get him into trouble, and, choking down his wrath, he answered:  \"If any one will tell me what my duty is, I shall be glad to do it.\"  \"You haven't been in the navy a great while, have you?\" inquired the steward, with a laugh.  \"No; this is my first attempt at learning to be a sailor.\"  \"Well, all I have got to say,\" continued the steward, \"is, that you will soon be sorry that you ever made the attempt.\"  \"I am sorry now,\" said Archie; \"and if I ever get home again, you'll never catch me in another scrape like this. I don't like the idea of having everybody order me around, and talk to me as though I was a dog.\"  \"No reflections,\" said the steward sharply. \"Better keep a civil tongue in your head. But now to business. In the first place, here are your dishes,\" and he handed Archie a number of tin pots and plates, a large pan, and a mess-kettle.  \"What shall I do with these?\" asked Archie.  \"Why, eat out of them, to be sure,\" answered the steward; \"what else would you do with them? I shall hold you responsible for them,\" he continued; \"and if any of them are lost, they will be charged to your account. Now go and put them away in your mess-chest, which you will find on the berth-deck, and then come back, and I will give you your rations.\"  Archie accordingly picked up his dishes, and started--he knew not whither, for he had no idea to which part of the vessel he should go in order to find the berth-deck. But he had often boasted that he would have no difficulty in getting along in the world while he had a tongue in his head; so he made inquiries of the first man he met, who told him to go up to the captain, who was always ready to send the executive officer to show landlubbers over the ship. If there was any joke in this, Archie was too angry to notice it, and he was about to make a suitable rejoinder, when a voice close behind him said:  \"Now, shipmate, what's the use of being so hard on the boy?\"  Archie turned, and found Simpson at his side.  \"The youngster hain't been to sea as long as you and I have,\" continued the latter. \"If we were ashore, he would stand a better chance of gettin' along than you nor me.\"  \"Then, shiver his tim'ers, why didn't he stay ashore, where he belongs?\" asked the man, gruffly.  \"Oh, he's got the right stuff in him, and will soon learn the ropes,\" answered Simpson. \"Come, now, my little marlinspike,\" he continued, turning to Archie, \"follow in my wake, and I'll show you where our mess-chest is;\" and the kind-hearted sailor led the way to the berth-deck, and showed Archie the mess-chest, which had \"No. 25\" painted on it. Archie put all his dishes into it, with the exception of the mess-kettle and two plates, which, according to Simpson's directions, he took back to the store-room, to put his rations in. The steward then gave him a large piece of salt beef, some coffee, sugar, butter, and sea-biscuit.  \"Is this all we have to eat?\" inquired Archie, as he picked up his rations and followed Simpson back to his mess-chest.  \"All!\" repeated Simpson; \"yes, my hearty, and you may thank your lucky stars that you have got even this. You'll have to live on worse grub nor this afore your year is out. But I see you don't like the berth of cook, so I'll take it off your hands. Give me the key of the chist.\"  Archie accordingly handed it over, and then went in search of his cousin, whom he found perched upon a coil of rope, engaged in writing a letter.  \"Well,\" exclaimed the latter, as Archie came up, \"how do you get along?\"  \"I don't get along at all,\" said Archie; \"I tell you, we've got ourselves in a fix. What do you suppose we are going to have for dinner?\"  \"I don't know,\" answered Frank. \"Well, we will have a chunk of salt beef, coffee without any milk, butter strong enough to go alone, and crackers so hard that you couldn't break them with an ax. I tell you, the navy is played out.\"  \"Well, it can't be helped,\" said his cousin. \"We are in for it. But we'll soon get accustomed to the food; we are seeing the worst of our year now.\"  \"I certainly hope so,\" said Archie; \"but I know I can stand it if any one else can; and when I fairly get started, I won't ask favors of any one.\"  Frank made no reply, but went on with his letter, and Archie leaned on one of the guns and gazed listlessly into the water. At length they were interrupted by the boatswain's whistle, blown three times in succession, long and loud.  \"What's the matter now, I wonder,\" said Frank, as the sailors commenced running about the ship in all directions.  \"I know,\" answered Archie, as he saw Simpson dive into the cook's galley and reappear bearing the mess-kettle, filled with steaming coffee, in one hand, and a large pan, containing the salt beef, in the other--\"dinner is ready.\"  The cousins walked aft to their mess-chest, and found the berth-deck filled with men, who were sitting around the chests, brandishing their sheath-knives over plates fall of salt beef and \"hard-tack.\"  Coming directly from home, where they had been accustomed to luxurious living, our young sailors thought they could not relish this hard fare but, as they had eaten no breakfast, they were very hungry, and the food tasted much better than they had expected.  When dinner was ended, Simpson began to gather up the dishes belonging to his mess, preparatory in washing them. Frank and Archie offered their assistance, and Simpson directed the former to take the mess-kettle and go up to the galley after some hot water. When he was returning, he saw a man stealing around the deck, holding something behind him that looked very much like a bundle of rope, and keeping a close watch on every one he met. Frank did not know what to make of this, and stepping up to the boatswain's mate, he inquired:  \"What is that man doing with that bundle of rope behind him?\"  \"That ain't a bundle of"]]]
