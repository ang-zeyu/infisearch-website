Pl. 261 (1591).    Mamillaria uncinata  Zucc. in Pfeiff. Enum. 34 (1837).   Mamillaria bihamata  Pfeiff. in Otto and Deitr. Gart. vi. 274 (1840)   Mamillaria adunca  Scheidw. (1845-1849?).   Mamillaria depressa  Scheidw. (1845-1849?).  Usually globose (occasionally depressed or even subcolumnar), 5 to 6 cm. in diameter (doubtless becoming larger): tubercles 8 to 10 mm. long, woolly in the upper axils: radial spines 4 to 6, rigid, 4 to 6 mm. long, the upper one stouter than the rest and sometimes shorter, reddish-brown and horny, straight or slightly curved, the remainder straight and white with dusky tips; central spine stout and horny, reddish-brown, 7 to 10 mm. long: flowers greenish-white or tinged with red: fruit unknown Type unknown.  Entirely Mexican, reported from Chihuahua to Saint Luis Potosi.  Specimens examined: San Luis Potosi (Gregg of 1848; Parry 268; Eschanzier of 1891): Chihuahua (Wislizenus of 1846-47; also Chihuahua specimens cultivated in the Jacoby Garden in 1856 and 1857).  The variations observed in this species do not seem sufficient for the establishment of varieties.  The type form seems to have been globose, with 4 radial spines and a stout central one.  The depressed forms with 6 radials and a more slender central represent var. spinosior Lem. (M. depressa Scheidw.); and the subcolumnar forms with 6 radials (the upper one of which is somewhat curved) and a stout strongly hooked central represent var biuncinata Lem. (M. bihamata Pfeiff.)  Such combinations of characters, however, do not hold, as any one of the plant body forms may display any one of the spine characters referred to.  B. Tubercles terete.    * Central spines none: mostly simple globose plants, with very     numerous straight whitish setaceous radials.  10. Cactus lasiacanthus (Engelm.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 259 (1891).    Mamillaria lasiacantha  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 261 (1856).  Globose or ovate globose, 2 to 2.5 cm. high and 1 to 2 cm. broad: tubercles 4 mm. long, about 2 mm. in diameter, with naked axils: spines 40 to 60, in many series, very unequal, 2 to 4 mm, long, white and pilose, the upper exterior usually longer than the rest, the innermost usually much shorter: flowers 12 mm. long, whitish or pinkish (petals with red median band): fruit 1 to 2 cm. long: seeds about 1 mm. long, blackish and conspicuously pitted. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 3).  Type, the specimens of Wright in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  From western Texas (\"west of time Pecos, on low limestone hills, among herbage\") to Arizona and Chihuahua.  Fl. April, May.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright 121, also of 1852; Parry of 1852): Arizona (Miller of 1881): Chihuahua (Pringle 213, 250,258): also specimens cultivated in St. Louis in 1852 and 1855.  11. Cactus lasiacanthus denudatus (Engelm.).    Mamillaria lasiacantha denudata  Engelm. Cact. Mex. Bound. 5   (1859).  Larger, 2.5 to 3.5 cm. in diameter, with longer tubercles (5 to 6 mm.), and more numerous (50 to 80) longer (3 to 5 mum.) spines which are naked or nearly so. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 4) Type, Wright specimen in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  From western Texas (with the species) to Coahuila.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright of 1852): Coahuila (Palmer of 1880).  In the Syn. Cact. Dr. Engelmann merges this variety with the species, and has been followed in this by subsequent writers, but the characters seem so (distinctive that its varietal rank has been restored.  12. Cactus micromeris (Engelm.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria micromeris  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 260 (1856).  With depressed top and very rarely branching, 1 to 3.5 cm. in diameter: tubercles very small (about 1 mm. long) and wart-like, crowded, shedding the spines with age and giving the base of the plant a tuberculated appearance: spines from white to ashy-gray, 1 to 3 mm. long; in young plants and on lower tubercles of adult plants about 20, equal and radiant; on flower-bearing tubercles 30 to 40, stellate-porrect in every direction, the 6 to 8 upper ones two to four times longer than the rest (4 to 8 mm.), clavate toward the apex and acute (the clavate top at length deciduous), intermixed with loose wool of about the same length and forming a small tuft on the top of the plant which includes and partly hides flowers and fruit: flowers whitish to light pink, almost central, very small (6 mm. in diameter), much reduced (3 to 5 sepals, 5 petals, 10 to 15 stamens, 3 stigmas): fruit 8 to 12 mm. long: seeds 1.5 mm. long, black and shining. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 1 and 2. figs. 1-4)  Type, the specimens of Wright in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  On naked mountain tops and sides, extreme southwestern Texas (Val Verde County to El Paso) and southward into Coahuila and Chihuahua.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright 227 of 1849, also of 1852; Nealley of 1892): Coahuila (Bigelow of 1853): Chihuahua (Pringle 212): also growing in Mo. Bot. Gard. 1893.  The plants densely covered above with delicate ashy-gray spines and with naked tuberculate base are readily recognized.  It still remains an open question whether the flowers are developed from the axils of tubercles of the same season or the last ones of the preceding season.  Dr. Engelmann inclined to the latter view, as all the other characters of the plant associate it with the \"lateral-flowered\" species; and in the absence of definite observation we have retained it there.  If the nearly central flowers indicate that they are produced from growth of the same season the species would seem to be allied to Coryphantha, in which group its small flowers and small tubercles would be anomalous.  13. Cactus micromeris greggii (Engelm.).    Mamillaria micromeris greggii  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 261 (1856).  Larger (2.5 to 5 cm. in diameter) and becoming oblong, with larger globose-ovate tubercles (2 to 2.5 mm. long), fewer rigid spines all radiant (interior 5 to 7 shorter and stouter, 1 to 2 mm. long; the outer 15 to 18, 3 to 4 mm. long), and fruit 1.5 to 2 mm. long. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 2. figs. 5-8)  Type, Gregg 508 in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  Mountain ridges near Saltillo, Coahuila.  Said by Budd to occur within the southern borders of Pecos County, Tex.  Specimens examined: Coahuila (Gregg 508; Palmer of 1880).  It is a question whether this variety does not merely represent an older and better developed plant than those upon which the species is based.  Mr. Harry I. Budd, who has made extensive collections of Texan and Mexican Cacti for the market, reports that it is impossible to separate sharply the variety from the species in the field, and regards the difference merely as one of age.  Unfortunately, only living material of the species could be examined, but its characters seem well sustained even in the most vigorous plants, some of which reach the size of the variety. Through this variety the species is brought very near the following:  14. Cactus bispinus.    Mamillaria microthele  Muhlenpf. Allg. Gart. Zeit. p. 11 (1848),   not Lem. (1838).  Differs from the last form (var. greggii) chiefly in its cespitose habit, much larger tubercles, and two unusually stout and short central spines (fide Engelmann, who examined specimens in Coll. Salm-Dyck).  Credited to Mexico in general, but said by Budd to occur within the southern border of Pecos County, Tex.    ** Central spines present and one or more hooked.   +  Mostly globose and simple plants (occasionally somewhat      cylindrical).  15. Cactus wrightii (Engelm.) Kuntze. Rev. Gen. Pl. 261 (1891).    Mamillaria wrightii  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 262 (1856).  Globose or depressed globose (top-shaped below), 3 to 7.5 cm. in diameter, simple: tubercles 10 to 12 mm. long, with naked axils: radial spines 8 to 12, white (the upper dusky-tipped), pubescent, 8 to 12 mm. long central spines mostly 2 (usually side by side and divergent), rarely 1 or 3, scarcely longer, hooked and reddish-black: flowers 2.5 cm. long, bright purple: fruit about 2.5 cm. long, somewhat subglobose, purple: seeds 1.4 mm long, black and pitted.  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t.8. figs. 1-8)  Type, Wright of 1851 in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  High plains and rocky places, from the Upper Pecos, east of Santa Fe, N. Mex., southward through extreme southwestern Texas (between the Pecos and El Paso), and into Chihuahua (near Lake Santa Maria).  Specimens examined: New Mexico (Wright of 1851; Rusby of 1880): also growing in Mo. Bot. Gard. 1893.  Dr. Engelmann calls attention to the fact that this species is closely allied to the Mexican C. zephranthoides (Scheidw.), but in the absence of material representing the latter species no comparison can be made.  In descriptions of the Mexican species the differently colored flowers and the much longer spines suggest differences that an examination of fruit and seed characters may still further emphasize.  16. Cactus goodrichii (Scheer) Kuntze. Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria goodrichii  Scheer in Salm Cact. Hort. Dyck. 91   (1850).  Globose or ovate, 5 to 7.5 cm. high, subsimple: tubercles ovate, short (3 to 5 mm.), somewhat corky and persistent, with dense wool in the young axils containing 5 to 8 stiff bristles: radial spines 11 to 15 (the uppermost one sometimes wanting), white and rigid, 5 to 7 mm. long, entangled with adjoining clusters; central spines 3 or 4 (often solitary in young plants), brownish-black,the upper ones divergent and straight (rarely showing a tendency to hook), the lower longer (9 to 10 mm.), stouter and hooked (usually upwards): flowers 12 to 18 mm, long, the petals yellowish-white with red midribs: fruit clavate and scarlet. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 8. figs. 9-14)  Type: Scheer says that the plant was brought from the Island of \"Corros\" (Cedros?) by Dr. Goodrich, and \"unfortunately perished in the gardens,\" which generally means that there is not a fragment of the type in existence.  In dry ravines, from San Diego County, California, southward throughout Lower California"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],["title","Tales of lonely trails (#1)"],["body","thing for a man to use three mounts on this trip. Then two of our Indians disappeared. But Wetherill waited for us and so did Nas ta Bega, the Piute who first took Wetherill down into Nonnezoshe Boco. As I came up I thought we had indeed reached the end of the world.  \"It's down in there,\" said Wetherill, with a laugh.  Nas ta Bega made a slow sweeping gesture. There is always something so significant and impressive about an Indian when he points anywhere. It is as if he says, \"There, way beyond, over the ranges, is a place I know, and it is far.\" The fact was that I looked at the Piute's dark, inscrutable face before I looked out into the void.  My gaze then seemed impelled and held by things afar, a vast yellow and purple corrugated world of distance, apparently now on a level with my eyes. I was drawn by the beauty and grandeur of that scene; and then I was transfixed, almost by fear, by the realization that I dared to venture down into this wild and upflung fastness. I kept looking afar, sweeping the three-quarter circle of horizon till my judgment of distance was confounded and my sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the next.  Wetherill was pointing and explaining, but I had not grasped all he said.  \"You can see two hundred miles into Utah,\" he went on. \"That bright rough surface, like a washboard, is wind-worn rock. Those little lines of cleavage are canyons. There are a thousand canyons down there, and only a few have we been in. That long purple ragged line is the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. And there, that blue fork in the red, that's where the San Juan comes in. And there's Escalante Canyon.\"  I had to adopt the Indian's method of studying unlimited spaces in the desert--to look with slow contracted eyes from near to far.  The pack-train and the drivers had begun to zigzag down a long slope, bare of rock, with scant strips of green, and here and there a cedar. Half a mile down, the slope merged in what seemed a green level. But I knew it was not level. This level was a rolling plain, growing darker green, with lines of ravines and thin, undefined spaces that might be mirage. Miles and miles it swept and rolled and heaved, to lose its waves in apparent darker level. Round red rocks stood isolated. They resembled huge grazing cattle. But as I gazed these rocks were strangely magnified. They grew and grew into mounds, castles, domes, crags, great red wind-carved buttes. One by one they drew my gaze to the wall of upflung rock. I seemed to see a thousand domes of a thousand shapes and colors, and among them a thousand blue clefts, each of which was a canyon.  Beyond this wide area of curved lines rose another wall, dwarfing the lower; dark red, horizon-long, magnificent in frowning boldness, and because of its limitless deceiving surfaces incomprehensible to the gaze of man. Away to the eastward began a winding ragged blue line, looping back upon itself, and then winding away again, growing wider and bluer. This line was San Juan Canyon. I followed that blue line all its length, a hundred miles, down toward the west where it joined a dark purple shadowy cleft. And this was the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. My eye swept along with that winding mark, farther and farther to the west, until the cleft, growing larger and closer, revealed itself as a wild and winding canyon. Still farther westward it split a vast plateau of red peaks and yellow mesas. Here the canyon was full of purple smoke. It turned, it closed, it gaped, it lost itself and showed again in that chaos of a million cliffs. And then it faded, a mere purple line, into deceiving distance.  I imagined there was no scene in all the world to equal this. The tranquillity of lesser spaces was here not manifest. This happened to be a place where so much of the desert could be seen and the effect was stupendous Sound, movement, life seemed to have no fitness here. Ruin was there and desolation and decay. The meaning of the ages was flung at me. A man became nothing. But when I gazed across that sublime and majestic wilderness, in which the Grand Canyon was only a dim line, I strangely lost my terror and something came to me across the shining spaces.  Then Nas ta Bega and Wetherill began the descent of the slope, and the rest of us followed. No sign of a trail showed where the base of the slope rolled out to meet the green plain. There was a level bench a mile wide, then a ravine, and then an ascent, and after that, rounded ridge and ravine, one after the other, like huge swells of a monstrous sea. Indian paint brush vied in its scarlet hue with the deep magenta of cactus. There was no sage. Soap weed and meager grass and a bunch of cactus here and there lent the green to that barren, and it was green only at a distance.  Nas ta Bega kept on at a steady gait. The sun climbed. The wind rose and whipped dust from under the mustangs. There is seldom much talk on a ride of this nature. It is hard work and everybody for himself. Besides, it is enough just to see; and that country is conducive to silence. I looked back often, and the farther out on the plain we rode the higher loomed the plateau we had descended; and as I faced ahead again, the lower sank the red-domed and castled horizon to the fore.  It was a wild place we were approaching. I saw piñon patches under the circled walls. I ceased to feel the dry wind in my face. We were already in the lee of a wall. I saw the rock squirrels scampering to their holes. Then the Indians disappeared between two rounded corners of cliff.  I rode round the corner into a widening space thick with cedars. It ended in a bare slope of smooth rock. Here we dismounted to begin the ascent. It was smooth and hard, though not slippery. There was not a crack. I did not see a broken piece of stone. Nas ta Bega and Wetherill climbed straight up for a while and then wound round a swell, to turn this way and that, always going up. I began to see similar mounds of rock all around me, of every shape that could be called a curve. There were yellow domes far above and small red domes far below. Ridges ran from one hill of rock to another. There were no abrupt breaks, but holes and pits and caves were everywhere, and occasionally deep down, an amphitheater green with cedar and piñon. We found no vestige of trail on those bare slopes.  Our guides led to the top of the wall, only to disclose to us another wall beyond, with a ridged, bare, and scalloped depression between. Here footing began to be precarious for both man and beast. Our mustangs were not shod and it was wonderful to see their slow, short, careful steps. They knew a great deal better than we what the danger was. It has been such experiences as this that have made me see in horses something besides beasts of burden. In the ascent of the second slope it was necessary to zigzag up, slowly and carefully, taking advantage of every bulge and depression.  Then before us twisted and dropped and curved the most dangerous slopes I had ever seen. We had reached the height of the divide and many of the drops on this side were perpendicular and too steep for us to see the bottom.  [Illustration: THIS IMMENSE CAVE WOULD HOLD TRINITY CHURCH. IN IT LIES THE RUINED CLIFF DWELLING CALLED BETATAKIN]  At one bad place Wetherill and Nas ta Bega, with Joe Lee, a Mormon cowboy with us, were helping one of the pack-horses named Chub. On the steepest part of this slope Chub fell and began to slide. His momentum jerked the rope from the hands of Wetherill and the Indian. But Joe Lee held on. Joe was a giant and being a Mormon he could not let go of anything he had. He began to slide with the horse, holding back with all his might.  [Illustration: THE WIND-WORN TREACHEROUS SLOPES ON THE WAY TO NONNEZOSHE]  It seemed that both man and beast must slide down to where the slope ended in a yawning precipice. Chub was snorting or screaming in terror. Our mustangs were frightened and rearing. It was not a place to have trouble with horses.  I had a moment of horrified fascination, in which Chub turned clear over. Then he slid into a little depression that, with Joe's hold on the lasso, momentarily checked his descent. Quick as thought Joe ran sidewise and down to the bulge of rock, and yelled for help. I got to him a little ahead of Wetherill and Nas ta Bega; and together we pulled Chub up out of danger. At first we thought he had been choked to death. But he came to, and got up, a bloody, skinned horse, but alive and safe. I have never seen a more magnificent effort than Joe Lee's. Those fellows are built that way. Wetherill has lost horses on those treacherous slopes, and that risk is the only thing about the trip which is not splendid.  We got over that bad place without further incident, and presently came to a long swell of naked stone that led down to a narrow green split. This one had straight walls and wound away out of sight. It was the head of a canyon.  \"Nonnezoshe Boco,\" said the Indian.  This then was the Canyon of the Rainbow Bridge. When we got down into it we were a happy crowd. The mode of travel here was a selection of the best levels, the best places to cross the brook, the best places to climb, and it was a process of continual repetition. There was no trail ahead of us, but we certainly left one behind. And as Wetherill picked out the course and the mustangs followed him I had all freedom to see and feel the beauty, color, wildness and changing character of Nonnezoshe Boco.  My experiences in the desert did not count much in the trip down this strange, beautiful lost canyon. All canyons are not alike. This one did not widen, though the walls grew higher. They began to lean and bulge, and the narrow strip of sky above resembled a flowing blue river. Huge caverns had been hollowed out by water or wind. And when the brook ran close under one of these overhanging places the running water made a singular indescribable sound. A crack from a hoof on a stone rang like"]]]
