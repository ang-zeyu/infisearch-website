And he was perfectly frank about the intimate processes of mastication.  And when he dropped a batch of scalloped oysters into his watch pocket he solemnly fished them-out with a souvenir after-dinner coffee spoon having the Statue of Liberty for a handle and Brooklyn Bridge in the bowl.  And the wretch's wife was so nervous that she talked all the time about people the others had never seen or heard of.  And she said she \"never used tomattus.\"  And she wasn't ashamed of what she was chewing either.  Mrs. Stubblebine would have felt much obliged to fate if she had been presented with an apoplectic stroke.  But she had to sit the dinner out.  From what she said to her poor husband afterward, however, one might have gathered that he picked out those relatives just to spite her, when as a matter of fact he had always loathed them and regretted them and the next day he borrowed enough money to lend them and send them back to the soil.  Mrs. Budlong had constituted herself Entertainment Committee for all sorts of visitors.  If a young girl came home from boarding school with a classmate, the real hostess had hardly time to show her to the spare room, and say, \"This is the bathroom, round here; watch out for the step.  And if the water don't run just wait--\" when the telephone would go Brrrrr!  And there would be Mrs. Budlong brandishing an invitation to a dinner party.  When the supply of guests ran low she would visit the sick.  If a worn-out housewife slept late some morning to catch up, Mrs. Budlong would hear of it and rush over with a broth or something.  It is said that old Miss Malkin got out of bed with an unfinished attack of pneumonia, just to keep from eating any more of Mrs. Budlong's wine jellies.  In Carthage one pays for the telephone by the year.  The company lost money on Mrs. Budlong's wire.  As a telephoner she was simply interminable.  She would spend a weekend at the instrument while the prisoner at the other extreme of the wire shifted from ear to ear, sagged along the wall, postponed household duties, made signals of distress to other members of the family, and generally cursed Mr. Alexander Graham Bell for his ingenuity.  Three wall telephones were changed to table phones on Mrs. Budlong's account, and Mrs. Talbot had hers put by the bed.  She used to take naps while Mrs. Budlong talked and she trained herself to murmur, \"Yes, dear,\" at intervals in her sleep.  By means like this Mrs. Budlong kept Carthage more or less under her thumb.  Carthage squirmed but it could not crawl out from under.  This is the story of how the thumb was removed for good and all.  It was Mrs. Budlong herself that removed it.  Carthage could never have pried it up.  And strange to say the thumb came off because it grew popular.  Hitherto Mrs. Budlong had never been truly popular.  People were merely afraid of her.  She was a whipper-in, a social bush-beater, driving the populace from cover like partridges.  She would not let the town rest.  The merchants alone admired her, for she was the cause of much buying of new shoes, new hats, new clothes, fine groceries, olives, Malaga grapes, salted almonds, raisins, English walnuts and other things that one eats only at parties.  She was the first woman in Carthage that ever gave a luncheon and called it breakfast, as years before she had been the first hostess to give a dinner at any time except in the middle of the day.  Also, she was the first person there to say, \"Come to me\" when she meant \"Come to our house.\"  It had a Scriptural sound and was thought shocking until Carthage grew used to it.  It was due to her that several elderly men were forced into their first evening dress.  They had thought to escape through life without that ordeal.  Old Clute would have preferred to be fitted for a pine box, and would have felt about as comfortable in it.  He tried to compromise with the tailor on a garment that could serve as a Prince Albert by day and a \"swaller tail\" by night, but Mr. Kweskin could not manage it even though his Christian name was Moses.  So Mr. Clute blamed Mrs. Budlong for yet another expense.  Husbands all over town were blaming Mrs. Budlong for running their families into fool extravagances.  Mothers were blaming her for dragging them round by the nose and leaving them no rest.  But everybody in town resentfully obeyed Mrs. Budlong, though Mrs. Roscoe Detwiller wanted to organize a HomeKeepers Union, and strike.  For the women never dared trust themselves about the house in a wrapper, since Mrs. Budlong might happen in as like as not--rather liker than not.  And then, just as the town was fermenting for revolt, Mrs. Budlong came into a lot of money.     IV  ONLY A MILLIONAIRE  That is, Mr. Budlong came into a lot of money.  Which meant that Mr. Budlong would be permitted to take care of it while his wife got rid of it.  One of those relatives, very common in fiction, and not altogether unknown in real life, finally let go of her money at the behest of her impatient undertaker.  The Budlongs had the pleasure of seeing the glorious news of their good fortune in big headlines in the Carthage papers.  It was the only display Mr. Budlong ever received in that paper without paying for it--excepting the time when he ran for Mayor on the opposition ticket and was referred to in letters an inch high as \"Candidate Nipped-in-the-Budlong.\"  But now the cornucopia of plenty had burst wide open on the front porch.  It seemed as if they would have to wade through gold dollars to get to their front gate--when the money was collected.  When the money was collected.  And now it was Mrs.  Budlong's telephone that rang and rang.  It was she that was called up and called up.  It was she that sagged along the wall and shifted from foot to foot, from elbow to elbow and ear to ear.  After living in Carthage all her life she was suddenly, as it were, welcomed to the city as a distinguished visiting stranger.  And now she had no need to invite people to return their calls.  They came spontaneously.  Sometimes there were a dozen calling at once.  It was a reception every day.  There were overflow meetings in the room which Mrs. Budlong called Mr. Budlong's \"den.\" This was the place where she kept the furniture that she didn't dare keep in the parlor.  People who had never come to see her in spite of her prehensile telephone, dropped in to pay up some musty old call that had lain unreturned for years.  People who had always come formally, even funereally, rushed in as informally and with as devouring an enthusiasm as old chums.  People who used to run in informally now drove up in vehicles from MacMulkin's livery stable; or if they came in their own turn-outs they had the tops washed and the harness polished, and the gardener and furnaceman who drove, had his hat brushed, was not allowed to smoke, and was urged to sit up straight and for heaven's sake to keep his foot off the dashboard.  People who had been in the habit of devoting a day or two to cleaning up a year's social debts and went up and down the streets dropping doleful calls like wreaths on headstones, walked in unannounced of mornings.  It was now Mrs. Budlong that had to keep dressed up all day. Everybody accepted the inevitable invitations to have a cup of tea, till the cook struck.  Cook said she had conthracted to cuke for a small family, not to run a continurous bairbecue.  Besides she had to answer the doorbell so much she couldn't get her hands into the dough, before they were out again.  And dinner was never ready.  The amount of tea consumed and bakery cake and the butter, began to alarm Mrs. Budlong.  And Carthage people were so nervous at taking tea with a millionairess that they kept dropping cups or setting saucers down too hard.  Mrs. Budlong had never a moment the whole day long to leave the house, and she suddenly found herself without a call returned.  She had so many invitations to dinners and luncheons, that her life became a hop, skip and jump.  During the first ecstasy of the good news, Mrs. Budlong had raved over the places she was going to travel,--Paris (now pronounced Paree), London, Vienna, St. Marks, the Lion of Lucerne--she talked like a handbook of Cook's Tours.  To successive callers she told the story over and over till the rhapsody finally palled on her own tongue.  She began to hate Paree, London, Vienna, St. Marks, and to loathe the Lion of Lucerne.  All she wanted to do was to get out of town to some quiet retreat.  Carthage was no longer quiet.  It simmered to the boiling-over point.  Once it had been Mrs. Budlong's pride to be the social leader of Carthage.  Now that her husband was worth (or to be worth) a hundred thousand dollars Carthage seemed a very petty parish to be the social leader of.  She began to read New York society notes with expectancy, as one cons the Baedeker of a town one is approaching.  She lay awake nights wondering what she should wear at Mrs. Stuyvesant Square's next party and at Mrs. Astor House's sociable.  She fretted the choice whether she should take a letter from her church to St. Bartholomew's or to Grace or St. John's the Divine's.  And all the while she was pouring tea for the wives of harness makers and druggists, dentists and grocers.  The more reason for not appearing before them in the same clothes incessantly.  But with a dinner or a reception or a tea or a ball every night, her two dressy-up dresses became so familiar that at one party when she was coming downstairs from laying off her cloak people spoke to her dress before they could see her face.  And she could"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12884"],["title","Reed Anthony, Cowman: An Autobiography (#1)"],["body","home, and inside a few months I was assigned to the commissary department with the army in Virginia. It was while in the latter service that I made the acquaintance of many Texans, from whom I learned a great deal about the resources of their State,--its immense herds of cattle, the cheapness of its lands, and its perpetual summer. During the last year of the war, on account of their ability to handle cattle, a number of Texans were detailed to care for the army's beef supply. From these men I received much information and a pressing invitation to accompany them home, and after the parole at Appomattox I took their address, promising to join them in the near future. On my return to the old homestead I found the place desolate, with burnt barns and fields laid waste. The Shenandoah Valley had experienced war in its dread reality, for on every hand were the charred remains of once splendid homes. I had little hope that the country would ever recover, but my father, stout-hearted as ever, had already begun anew, and after helping him that summer and fall I again drifted west to my brother's farm.  The war had developed a restless, vagabond spirit in me. I had little heart to work, was unsettled as to my future, and, to add to my other troubles, after reaching Missouri one of my wounds reopened. In the mean time my brother had married, and had a fine farm opened up. He offered me every encouragement and assistance to settle down to the life of a farmer; but I was impatient, worthless, undergoing a formative period of early manhood, even spurning the advice of father, mother, and dearest friends. If to-day, across the lapse of years, the question were asked what led me from the bondage of my discontent, it would remain unanswered. Possibly it was the advantage of good birth; surely the prayers of a mother had always followed me, and my feet were finally led into the paths of industry. Since that day of uncertainty, grandsons have sat upon my knee, clamoring for a story about Indians, the war, or cattle trails. If I were to assign a motive for thus leaving a tangible record of my life, it would be that my posterity--not the present generation, absorbed in its greed of gain, but a more distant and a saner one--should be enabled to glean a faint idea of one of their forbears. A worthy and secondary motive is to give an idea of the old West and to preserve from oblivion a rapidly vanishing type of pioneers.  My personal appearance can be of little interest to coming generations, but rather what I felt, saw, and accomplished. It was always a matter of regret to me that I was such a poor shot with a pistol. The only two exceptions worthy of mention were mere accidents. In my boyhood's home, in Virginia, my father killed yearly a large number of hogs for the household needs as well as for supplying our slave families with bacon. The hogs usually ran in the woods, feeding and thriving on the mast, but before killing time we always baited them into the fields and finished their fattening with peas and corn. It was customary to wait until the beginning of winter, or about the second cold spell, to butcher, and at the time in question there were about fifty large hogs to kill. It was a gala event with us boys, the oldest of whom were allowed to shoot one or more with a rifle. The hogs had been tolled into a small field for the killing, and towards the close of the day a number of them, having been wounded and requiring a second or third shot, became cross. These subsequent shots were usually delivered from a six-shooter, and in order to have it at hand in case of a miss I was intrusted with carrying the pistol. There was one heavy-tusked five-year-old stag among the hogs that year who refused to present his head for a target, and took refuge in a brier thicket. He was left until the last, when we all sallied out to make the final kill. There were two rifles, and had the chance come to my father, I think he would have killed him easily; but the opportunity came to a neighbor, who overshot, merely causing a slight wound. The next instant the stag charged at me from the cover of the thickety fence corner. Not having sense enough to take to the nearest protection, I turned and ran like a scared wolf across the field, the hog following me like a hound. My father risked a running shot, which missed its target. The darkies were yelling, \"Run, chile! Run, Mars' Reed! Shoot! Shoot!\" when it occurred to me that I had a pistol; and pointing it backward as I ran, I blazed away, killing the big fellow in his tracks.  The other occasion was years afterward, when I was a trail foreman at Abilene, Kansas. My herd had arrived at that market in bad condition, gaunted from almost constant stampedes at night, and I had gone into camp some distance from town to quiet and recuperate them. That day I was sending home about half my men, had taken them to the depot with our wagon, and intended hauling back a load of supplies to my camp. After seeing the boys off I hastened about my other business, and near the middle of the afternoon started out of town. The distance to camp was nearly twenty miles, and with a heavy load, principally salt, I knew it would be after nightfall when I reached there. About five miles out of town there was a long, gradual slope to climb, and I had to give the through team their time in pulling to its summit. Near the divide was a small box house, the only one on the road if I remember rightly, and as I was nearing it, four or five dogs ran out and scared my team. I managed to hold them in the road, but they refused to quiet down, kicking, rearing, and plunging in spite of their load; and once as they jerked me forward, I noticed there was a dog or two under the wagon, nipping at their heels. There was a six-shooter lying on the seat beside me, and reaching forward I fired it downward over the end gate of the wagon. By the merest accident I hit a dog, who raised a cry, and the last I saw of him he was spinning like a top and howling like a wolf. I quieted the team as soon as possible, and as I looked back, there was a man and woman pursuing me, the latter in the lead. I had gumption enough to know that they were the owners of the dog, and whipped up the horses in the hope of getting away from them. But the grade and the load were against me, and the next thing I knew, a big, bony woman, with fire in her eye, was reaching for me. The wagon wheel warded her off, and I leaned out of her reach to the far side, yet she kept abreast of me, constantly calling for her husband to hurry up. I was pouring the whip into the horses, fearful lest she would climb into the wagon, when the hub of the front wheel struck her on the knee, knocking her down. I was then nearing the summit of the divide, and on reaching it, I looked back and saw the big woman giving her husband the pommeling that was intended for me. She was altogether too near me yet, and I shook the lines over the horses, firing a few shots to frighten them, and we tore down the farther slope like a fire engine.  There are two events in my life that this chronicle will not fully record. One of them is my courtship and marriage, and the other my connection with a government contract with the Indian department. Otherwise my life shall be as an open book, not only for my own posterity, but that he who runs may read. It has been a matter of observation with me that a plain man like myself scarcely ever refers to his love affairs. At my time of life, now nearing my alloted span, I have little sympathy with the great mass of fiction which exploits the world-old passion. In no sense of the word am I a well-read man, yet I am conscious of the fact that during my younger days the love story interested me; but when compared with the real thing, the transcript is usually a poor one. My wife and I have now walked up and down the paths of life for over thirty-five years, and, if memory serves me right, neither one of us has ever mentioned the idea of getting a divorce. In youth we shared our crust together; children soon blessed and brightened our humble home, and to-day, surrounded by every comfort that riches can bestow, no achievement in life has given me such great pleasure, I know no music so sweet, as the prattle of my own grandchildren. Therefore that feature of my life is sacred, and will not be disclosed in these pages.  I would omit entirely mention of the Indian contract, were it not that old friends may read this, my biography, and wonder at the omission. I have no apologies to offer for my connection with the transaction, as its true nature was concealed from me in the beginning, and a scandal would have resulted had I betrayed friends. Then again, before general amnesty was proclaimed I was debarred from bidding on the many rich government contracts for cattle because I had served in the Confederate army. Smarting under this injustice at the time the Indian contract was awarded, I question if I was thoroughly _reconstructed._ Before our disabilities were removed, we ex-Confederates could do all the work, run all the risk, turn in all the cattle in filling the outstanding contracts, but the middleman got the profits. The contract in question was a blanket one, requiring about fifty thousand cows for delivery at some twenty Indian agencies. The use of my name was all that was required of me, as I was the only cowman in the entire ring. My duty was to bid on the contract; the bonds would be furnished by my partners, of which I must have had a dozen. The proposals called for sealed bids, in the usual form, to be in the hands of the Department of the Interior before noon on a certain day, marked so and so, and to be opened at high noon a week later. The contract was a large one, the competition was ample. Several other Texas drovers besides myself had submitted bids; but they stood no show--_I had been furnished the figures of every competitor._ The ramifications of the"]]]
