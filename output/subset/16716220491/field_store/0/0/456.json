It's nine-fourteen.  What do you say if we step promptly over to the administration building and plunge into what's ahead of us?\"  \"Good enough,\" nodded one of the new acquaintances.  \"Suppose you lead the way?\"  So, with Dan by his side, Dave piloted the others over to the administration building, just beyond the chapel.  As they stepped inside, and found themselves in a hallway, a marine orderly confronted them.  \"Candidates, gentlemen?  Walk right upstairs.  An orderly there will direct you to the office of the superintendent's aide.\"  \"Thank you,\" replied Dave, with a bow, and led the way upstairs.  Near the head of the stairs another marine, in spick-and-span uniform, wearing white gloves and with a bayonet at his belt, called out quietly:  \"Candidates?  First two, step this way please.\"  He swung open a door.  Dave and Dan stepped into an office where they found a young-looking though slightly bald gentleman in uniform, seated behind a flat-top desk.  \"We have come to report, sir, according to our instructions,\" announced Dave Darrin, happily.  \"You are candidates, then?\" asked Lieutenant-Commander Graham, reaching for a pile of bound sheets.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Names?  \"David Darrin and Daniel Dalzell, sir.\"  \"Have you your papers, Mr. Darrin?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  Dave drew an official-looking envelope from an inner pocket and handed it to Lieutenant-Commander Graham.  These the Naval aide scanned closely, after which he looked up.  \"You have your papers, Mr. Dalzell?\"  \"Yes,\" nodded Dan.  A more than perceptible frown flashed across the face of the officer.  \"Mr. Dalzell, whenever you answer an officer you will say 'yes, sir,' or 'very good, sir.'\"  Rather red in the face Dan handed over his envelope.  Mr. Graham examined these papers, too.  Then, pulling a pile of blanks before him, he filled out two, bearing the names of the young men, and signed them, after which he handed one of the signed blanks to each.  \"Mr. Darrin, you will inquire of the orderly downstairs your way to the office of the commandant of midshipmen.  You will then at once present yourself before the commandant, handing him this paper.\"  \"Yes, sir; thank you, sir,\" replied Dave, with a slight bow.  \"Mr. Dalzell, stick close to your friend and you will find out what to do.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" murmured Dan, again reddening.  The orderly below directed the two young men how to proceed to the main entrance of Bancroft Hall, there to turn to their left and inquire again their way to the commandant's office.  \"You see,\" lectured Dave pleasantly, as the chums plodded along one of the walks, \"you have already received your first lesson. You answered the superintendent's aide without saying 'sir.'  You'll have to work out of this freshness.\"  \"That wasn't freshness; it was ignorance,\" protested Dalzell. \"Don't you worry, Dave; I shall soon get the Naval trotting gait to such an extent that I shall be saying 'sir' at every other word.\"  This declaration was more prophetic than Dalzell could guess at that moment.  Each lad had a queer feeling at heart as he began to climb the long series of white steps that lead to the main entrance to Bancroft Hall.  What would be the outcome?  Were they hence-forth to find this huge pile \"home\" for four years to come?  Would they, through all after life, look back upon this great government training school as their alma mater?  It all seemed to depend, now, on the verdict of the examining Naval surgeons!  But there was little time for thought.  Once inside, they were ushered, by a white-gloved midshipman, into the office of Commander Jephson, commandant of midshipmen.  That gentleman, also in uniform, as were all Navy officers on duty at the Academy, looked briefly as the two young men stood before him.  \"Candidates, gentlemen?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Dave.  \"Your orders?\"  Each young man handed over the slip given him by the aide.  Commander Jephson scanned each sheet closely, then made some entries on a set of papers of his own.  Next the commandant touched a button on his desk.  Almost immediately footsteps were heard outside.  Another white-gloved midshipman entered, raising his hand smartly to his cap in salute.  This salute the commandant acknowledged in kind.  \"Mr. Salisbury, conduct Candidates Darrin and Dalzell outside. Ascertain how soon the surgeons will be ready to examine them, and conduct the candidates to the Board Room at the time assigned for their examination.\"  \"Very good, sir,\" replied Midshipman Salisbury, in measured tones. Again the inter-change of salutes, after which Midshipman Salisbury led Dave and Dan to an outer office.  \"Wait here,\" directed the midshipman briefly, \"I'll let you know when it's time to go to the Board Room.\"  Five minutes later the midshipman again approached them.  By this time there were seven more candidates in the room.  The aide to the superintendent and the commandant were passing the young men quickly through the mill.  \"Mr. Darrin, Mr. Dalzell!\" called the midshipman master of ceremonies. As Dave and Dan started to their feet their conductor added:  \"Follow me to the Board Room.\"  Down the corridor and into the Board Room the two chums were led. There, awaiting them, they found three Naval medical officers, all in their proper uniform and one of them seated at a desk.  \"Strip, with the least delay possible,\" ordered the senior surgeon.  In a very short space of time Dave and Dan stood forth, minus clothes and, it must be confessed, both very nervous as to what these medical men might or might not find.  Thorough, indeed, was the examination, which began with the heart. But it went much further, including the hair, scalp, eyes, teeth, the condition of the tonsils, the appearance of the tongue, and so on, by regular stages, down to the soles of their feet.  \"If there's a square quarter of an inch these fellows have missed, I didn't notice it,\" muttered Dan to himself.  \"You may dress, Mr. Darrin,\" announced the senior surgeon, and Dave went to the chair on which his clothing lay.  \"Mr. Dalzell, come here a moment\"  Dan began to feel queer.  What had they missed?  On what point was his physical condition doubtful?  \"Open your mouth,\" directed one of the surgeons.  Then followed some more exploration of his teeth.  \"Oh,\" murmured Dan, when the medical men gave him a rest for a moment.  \"It's only my teeth, eh?  That's not a vitally important point, is it, sir?\"  \"We reject candidates for what might seem very slight defects of the teeth,\" replied the senior surgeon, with emphasis.  \"Open your mouth again.\"  The cold ooze stood out on Dan's brow this time.  Joke as he might, he did not want to be dropped out of the Navy.  Were these medical officers going to find, in his mouth, the clue his disqualification?  \"Hm!\" said the senior surgeon, watching while another medical officer did the probing and the holding of the dental mirrors.  That \"hm!\" sent a cold chill of dread coursing down young Daniel's spine.  \"Your teeth just about pass,\" remarked the senior officer.  \"You may dress, Mr. Dalzell.\"  It was not long before Dave and Dan both had their clothing on. As Dan was finishing, Dave turned to the senior surgeon.  \"Is it improper, sir, for me to ask whether we have passed?\" asked Darrin quietly.  \"You have both passed,\" nodded the surgeon.  \"Mr. Dalzell, however, will do well to take the most wholesome care of his teeth hereafter.\"  Just then the door opened and two more candidates were shown in.  \"Come with me,\" directed the same midshipman master of ceremonies.  Dan was indiscreet enough to range up alongside their conductor, just missing a vigorous nudge that Dave tried to give him.  \"Well, we slipped by the drug-store sign all right,\" Dan confided to the white-gloved midshipman.  \"Now, how soon do we get our messenger-boy uniforms?  \"Never, I hope,\" replied their conductor frigidly, \"unless you can learn to speak of the uniform of the service with more respect.\"  Dan fell back abashed.  His style of humor, he was fast discovering, did not seem to make a hit at Annapolis.  Back in the same waiting room the two young men lingered until nearly eleven o'clock.  More than two score of candidates had passed the medical examiners by this time, and some others had failed to pass.  Yet many of these successful candidates had yet to take their scholastic examinations over in Academic Hall, and so did not wait with Dave and Dan, who had now passed in everything.  By eleven there were fully a dozen young men who, like Dave and Dan, were ready to be sworn in.  These were now led to the commandant's office.  Here each signed a paper agreeing to serve in the United States Navy for a term of eight years, unless sooner legally discharged. Each also signed a statement to the effect that he took this step with the full permission of parents or guardian.  Then the commandant of cadets ordered them to form in a line facing his desk.  A notary appeared, who administered to them the oath of loyalty and obedience.  These young men were at last actual members of the brigade of midshipmen.  Commander Jephson now delivered a short address to the lined-up dozen.  He pointed out where the lines of their duty lay, and exhorted them to seek their duty and to perform it at all times. In closing the commandant put emphasis on these words:  \"One word more, young gentlemen.  Until this moment perhaps all of you have been wont to look upon yourself as boys.  That time has passed.  From the moment that you were sworn into the Navy of the United State--remember--you became men.  All of your superior officers will now look to you to realize most fully that you are men--men in word,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12775"],["title","Dave Darrin's Fourth Year at Annapolis: Headed for Graduation and the Big Cruise (#1)"],["body","ments.  The midshipmen visitors waited patiently, knowing that, from this comrade, they could be sure of a wholly candid reply.  \"Have you found the answer, Darry?\" pressed Wolgast at last.  \"Yes,\" said Dave slowly; \"I think I have.  The reason, as I see it, is that there are no decidedly star players on this year's probable eleven.  The men are all pretty nearly equal, which doesn't give you a chance to tower head and shoulders above the other players.  Usually, in the years that I know anything of, it has been the other way.  There have been only two or three star players in the squad, and the captain was usually one of the very best. You're plenty good enough football man, Wolgast, but there are so many other pretty good ones that you don't outshine the others as much as captains of poorer teams have done in other years.\"  \"By Jupiter!  Darry has hit it!\" cried Farley, leaping from his seat.  \"Wolly, you have the luck to command an eleven in which most of the men are nearly, if not quite, as good as the captain. You're not head and shoulders over the rest, and you don't tower---that's all.  Wolly, I apologize for my criticisms.  Darry has shown me the truth.\"  \"Then you look for a big slaughter list for us this year, Darry?\" Wolgast asked.  \"Yes; unless the other elevens that we're to play improve as much as the Navy is going to do.\"  At this moment Page and Jetson rapped and then entered.  Ten minutes later there were fully twenty midshipmen in the room, all talking animatedly on the one subject at the United States Naval Academy in October---football.  So the time sped.  Dave lost his chance to read his novel, but he did not mind the loss.  It was Jetson who, at last, discovered the time.  \"Whew, fellows!\" he muttered.  \"Only ten minutes to taps.\"  That sent most of the midshipmen scuttling away.  Page and Farley, however, whose quarters were but a few doors away on the same deck, remained.  \"Farl,\" murmured Darrin, \"for the first time tonight I'm feeling a bit worried.\"  \"Over Danny?\"  \"The same.\"  \"What's up?\" Page wanted to know.  \"Why, he hasn't been around all evening.  Surely Dalzell would be coming back by this time, unless-----\"  \"Didn't he have leave to visit town?\" demanded Midshipman Page.  \"Not that I've heard of,\" Dave Darrin answered quickly.  \"Nor do I see how he could have done so.  You see, Wednesday he received some demerits, and with them went the loss of privileges for October.\"  \"Whew!\" whistled Page.  \"What?\" demanded Dave, his alarm increasing.  \"Why, not long after supper I saw Danny heading toward the wall on the town side.\"  \"I have been afraid of that for the last two or three minutes,\" exclaimed Dave Darrin, his uneasiness now showing very plainly. \"Dan didn't say a word to me about going anywhere, but-----\"  \"You think, leave being impossible, Danny has Frenched it over the wall?\" demanded Farley.  \"That's just what I'm afraid of,\" returned Dave.  \"But why-----\"  \"I don't know any reason.\"  \"Then-----\"  \"Farl\", broke in Dave hurriedly, almost fiercely, \"has anyone a doughface?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Who has it?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"Find it---on the jump!\"  \"But-----\"  \"There's no time for 'buts,'\" retorted Darrin, pushing Farley toward the door.  \"Find it!\"  \"And I-----\" added Page, springing toward the door.  \"You'll stay here,\" ordered Dave.  Darrin was already headed toward his friend's alcove, where Dalzell's cot lay.  Page followed.  \"The dummy,\" explained Darrin briefly.  Every midshipman at Annapolis, doubtless, is familiar with the dummy.  Not so many, probably, are familiar with the doughface, which, at the time this is written, was a new importation.  Swiftly Dave and Page worked.  First they turned down the clothing, after having hurriedly made up the cot.  Now, from among the garments hanging on the wall nearby the two midshipmen took down the garments that normally lay under others.  With these they rigged up a figure not unlike that of a human being.  At least, it looked so after the bed clothes had been drawn up in place.  Then, glancing at the time, Dave Darrin waited---breathless.  Farley hastened into the room without losing time by knocking. Under one arm he bore, half hidden, some roundish object, wrapped in a towel.  Without a word, but with a heart full of gratitude, Dave Darrin snatched out from its wrapping the effigy of a male human head. It was done in wax, with human hair on the head.  Dave Darrin neatly fitted this at the top of the outlines of a figure under the bed clothing.  Under the full light the doughface looked ghostly.  In a dimmer light it would do very well.  \"Thank you a thousand times, fellows,\" trembled Dave Darrin.  \"Now hustle to your own quarters before the first stroke of taps sounds.\"  The two useful visitors were gone like a flash.  Ere they had quite closed the door, Dave Darrin was removing his own uniform and hanging up trousers and blouse.  Next off came the underclothing and on went pajamas.  Just then taps sounded.  Out went the electric light, turned off at the master switch.  Dave Darrin dived under the bed clothes on his own cot and tried to still the beating of his own heart.  Two minutes later a brisk step sounded on the corridor of the \"deck.\"  Door after door was opened and closed.  Then the door to Dave's room swung open, and a discipline officer and a midshipman looked into the room.  \"All in?\" the midshipman called.  A light snore from Dave Darrin's throat answered.  In his left hand the discipline officer carried an electric pocket light. A pressure of a button would supply a beam of electric light that would explore the bed of either midshipman supposed to be in this room.  But the officer saw Midshipman Darrin plainly enough, thanks to beams of light from the corridor.  Over in the opposite alcove the discipline officer made out, more vaguely, the lay figure and the doughface intended to represent Midshipman Dan Dalzell.  \"Both in.  Darrin and Dalzell never give us any trouble, at any rate,\" thought the discipline officer to himself, then closed the door, and his footsteps sounded further down the corridor.  \"Oh, Danny boy, I wish I had you here right at this minute!\" muttered Dave Darrin vengefully.  \"Maybe I wouldn't whang your head off for the fright that you've given me!  I'll wager half of my hairs have turned gray in the last minute!\"  However, Midshipman Dan Dalzell was not there, as Darrin knew to his own consternation.  Dave did not go to sleep.  Well enough he knew that he was on duty indefinitely through the hours until Dan should return.  If Midshipman Darrin fell into a doze this night he would be as bad as any sentry falling asleep on any other post.  So Darrin lay there and fidgeted.  Twenty times he tried to solve, in his own mind, the riddle of why Dalzell should be away, and where he was.  But it was a hopeless puzzle.  \"Of course, Danny didn't hint that he was going to French it tonight,\" thought Dave bitterly.  \"Good reason why, too!  He knew that, if I got wind of his intention, I'd thrash him sooner than let him take such a chance.  Oh, Dan!  Dan, you idiot!  To take such a fool chance in your last year here, when detection probably means your being dropped from brigade, and your career ended!\"  For Dave Darrin knew the way of discipline officers too well to imagine that that one brief inspection of the room was positively all the look-in that would be offered that night.  Some discipline officers have a way of looking in often during the night.  Being themselves graduates of the Naval Academy, officers are sure to know that the inspection immediately after taps does not always suffice.  Midshipmen have been known to be in bed at taps, and visiting in quarters of other midshipmen ten minutes later.  True, the electric light in rooms is turned off at taps---but midshipmen have been known to keep candles hidden, and to be experts in clouding doors and windows so that no ray of light gets through into a corridor after taps.  Just how often discipline officers were accustomed to look in through the night, Dave Darrin did not know from his own knowledge. Usually, at the times of such extra visits, Darrin was too blissfully asleep.  Tonight, however, despite the darkness of the room at present, Dave lay wide awake.  No sleep for him before daylight---perhaps not then---unless Dan turned up in the meantime.  After an interval that seemed several nights long, the dull old bell of the clock over on academic Hall began tolling.  Dave listened and counted.  He gave an almost incredulous snort when the total stopped at eleven.  Then another long period of waiting.  Darrin did not grow drowsy. On the contrary, he became more wide awake.  In fact, he began to imagine that he was becoming possessed of the vision of the cat.  Dark as it was in the room, Dave began to feel certain that he could distinguish plainly the ghostly figure of the saving doughface in the alcove opposite.  Twelve o'clock struck.  Then more waiting.  It was not so very long, this time, however, before there came a faint tapping at the window.  Dave Darrin was out of bed as though he had been shot out.  Like a flash he was at the window, peering out.  Where, after all, was the cat's vision of which he had thought himself possessed?  Some one was outside the window.  Dave thought he recognized the Naval uniform, but he could not see a line of the face.  Tap-tap-tap! sounded softly.  Dave threw the window up stealthily.  \"You, Dan?\" he whispered.  \"Of course,\" came the soft answer.  \"Stand aside.  Let me in---on the double-quick!\"  Dave pushed the window up the balance of the way, then stepped aside.  Dan Dalzell landed on his feet in the room, cat-like, from the terrace without.  Then Dave, without loss of an instant, closed the window and wheeled about in the darkness.  \"Hustle!\" commanded Dave.  \"What about?\"  \"Get off your uniform!  Get into pajamas.  Then I'll-----\"  Dave's jaws snapped together resolutely.  He did not finish, just then, for "]]]
